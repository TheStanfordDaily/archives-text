"We have the power to assert no
annihilation without representa
tion/ " veteran anti-war activist Daniel
Ellsoerg said at a noun iall\ iiere yes
terday.
"We need not be cogs in a dooms
day machine," he told a crowd of
about 1000.
President Jimmy Carter's State of
the Union address was a veiled threat
to the Soviet Union that he is consid
ering "first use of nuclear weapons,"
Ellsberg said.
Carter is hoping for "silent assent"
trom the American people, he said.
"It is not bluff; it is not rhetoric."
Ellsberg compared Carter asking
young people to register for the draft
to |im jones asking his Guyana cult
members to practice drinking Kool-
Aid in preparation for death.
Genocide policy
"The president does not have the
power to damn us to a policy of
genocide. It is for us to free ourselves
from that," he said.
Ellsberg received an enthusiastic
response from a much larger crowd
than the 600 persons who heard anti
dratt activist David Harris here
Thursday. Many students held pro
test signs such as "Stop the Draft Be
fore It Stops You," "I Don't Want to
Die in a Gas Line," and "Iran Would
Be a Crude Death." But there was no
chanting or demonstration such as
last week's symbolic burning of a
draft card.
Other world leaders such as Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev and Pakis
tani leader Mohammed /ia Ul-Haq
have joined Carter in making this
world "one huge lonestown in which
they assert the right to line us up and
rehearse taking the Kool-Aid. It's
mutiny time in Jonestown," Ellsberg

said.
He received an immediate stand
ing ovation when he concluded that
if there is an anti-draft movement in
this country, "a lot of you will be part
of it, and I'll be proud to be with
you."
Ellsberg said a possible reinstate
ment draft must be resisted now. He
also called for an immediate
moratorium on the testing, produc
tion and deployment of nuclear
weapons.
Nuclear power games
According to Ellsberg, "our de
termination to play the game of nuc
i"supM-pTßfcer" assured that ttrere
would eventually be two nuclear
superpowers. Now that the United
States and the Soviet Union are still
playing nuclear power games, "the
day is bound to come when third par
ties would also become nuclear
superpowers."
That day is coming soon, he ad
ded.
"The world is at this moment more
dangerous than ever before in the
history of humanity," he said.
Ellsberg noted that rallies similar to
the one yesterday had a definite ef
fect in ending the Vietnam War.
'Enough freedom'
Fortunately, "there's enough
freedom left in this country" tor
people to be heard and have an im
pact on policy decisions," he added.
The noon rally, sponsored by the
Stanford Peace Collective, also fea
tured Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, Med School Prof. Halsted
Holman, and several student speak
ers.
Leenda Gonzalez, a student speak
ing tor the Women's Center, read a
statement voicing a feminist

perspective on the draft.
"We seek to build a new society, a
new world in which this basic equal
ity is a fundamental value and not an
afterthought as in Jimmy Carter's
State of the Union address," she told
a cheering crowd.
'No draft'
"We believe there should be no
draft, no registration, for women or
men, now or at any time," she con
tinued.
Another woman student, Lisa
Catanzarite, was booed, however,
when she told the audience that men
are characteristally violent, women
are characteristically cooperative,
and women are being unfairly sub
jected to war decisions made by

Holman explained to the crowd
the effects ot nuclear weapons. Ten
1-megaton bombs targeted over the
Bay Area would totally obliterate
buildings over a 500,000 square-mile
area, would cause fires to spread to
an even greater distance, and would
result in millions o! deaths, he said.
Enormous effects
Holman said the enormity of the
possible effects is enough to make
pne numb. "But numbness is an invi
tation to death. It's far better that we
resist," he concluded.
\ Bernstein stressed that Carter "is
in a failure, not a suc
cess," his popularity is in
creasing although he has still not sol
ved the Iranian crisis.

reinstate draft registration. Veteran anti-war protester Daniel Ellsberg, History
Prof. Bernstein and several students also spoke.
Although Bernstein said the Un
ited States should openly condemn
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
"we need not and should not see it as
a threat to the United States" calling
for military response.
The decision to use military ag
gression and conscription as a solu
tion has been made by "an administ
ration serving its own partisan politi
cal interest," he said.
"It's time once more to think
abour resisting," Bernstein said.
"For it is through resistance that you
may save yourself, other Americans
and those abroad."

reinstate draft registration. Veteran anti-war protester Daniel Ellsberg, History
Prof. Bernstein and several students also spoke.
Although Bernstein said the Un
ited States should openly condemn
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
"we need not and should not see it as
a threat to the United States" calling
for military response.
The decision to use military ag
gression and conscription as a solu
tion has been made by "an administ
ration serving its own partisan politi
cal interest," he said.
"It's time once more to think
abour resisting," Bernstein said.
"For it is through resistance that you
may save yourself, other Americans
and those abroad."
"We have the power to assert no
annihilation without representa
tion/ " veteran anti-war activist Daniel
Ellsoerg said at a noun iall\ iiere yes
terday.
"We need not be cogs in a dooms
day machine," he told a crowd of
about 1000.
President Jimmy Carter's State of
the Union address was a veiled threat
to the Soviet Union that he is consid
ering "first use of nuclear weapons,"
Ellsberg said.
Carter is hoping for "silent assent"
trom the American people, he said.
"It is not bluff; it is not rhetoric."
Ellsberg compared Carter asking
young people to register for the draft
to |im jones asking his Guyana cult
members to practice drinking Kool-
Aid in preparation for death.
Genocide policy
"The president does not have the
power to damn us to a policy of
genocide. It is for us to free ourselves
from that," he said.
Ellsberg received an enthusiastic
response from a much larger crowd
than the 600 persons who heard anti
dratt activist David Harris here
Thursday. Many students held pro
test signs such as "Stop the Draft Be
fore It Stops You," "I Don't Want to
Die in a Gas Line," and "Iran Would
Be a Crude Death." But there was no
chanting or demonstration such as
last week's symbolic burning of a
draft card.
Other world leaders such as Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev and Pakis
tani leader Mohammed /ia Ul-Haq
have joined Carter in making this
world "one huge lonestown in which
they assert the right to line us up and
rehearse taking the Kool-Aid. It's
mutiny time in Jonestown," Ellsberg

said.
He received an immediate stand
ing ovation when he concluded that
if there is an anti-draft movement in
this country, "a lot of you will be part
of it, and I'll be proud to be with
you."
Ellsberg said a possible reinstate
ment draft must be resisted now. He
also called for an immediate
moratorium on the testing, produc
tion and deployment of nuclear
weapons.
Nuclear power games
According to Ellsberg, "our de
termination to play the game of nuc
i"supM-pTßfcer" assured that ttrere
would eventually be two nuclear
superpowers. Now that the United
States and the Soviet Union are still
playing nuclear power games, "the
day is bound to come when third par
ties would also become nuclear
superpowers."
That day is coming soon, he ad
ded.
"The world is at this moment more
dangerous than ever before in the
history of humanity," he said.
Ellsberg noted that rallies similar to
the one yesterday had a definite ef
fect in ending the Vietnam War.
'Enough freedom'
Fortunately, "there's enough
freedom left in this country" tor
people to be heard and have an im
pact on policy decisions," he added.
The noon rally, sponsored by the
Stanford Peace Collective, also fea
tured Assoc. History Prof. Barton
Bernstein, Med School Prof. Halsted
Holman, and several student speak
ers.
Leenda Gonzalez, a student speak
ing tor the Women's Center, read a
statement voicing a feminist

perspective on the draft.
"We seek to build a new society, a
new world in which this basic equal
ity is a fundamental value and not an
afterthought as in Jimmy Carter's
State of the Union address," she told
a cheering crowd.
'No draft'
"We believe there should be no
draft, no registration, for women or
men, now or at any time," she con
tinued.
Another woman student, Lisa
Catanzarite, was booed, however,
when she told the audience that men
are characteristally violent, women
are characteristically cooperative,
and women are being unfairly sub
jected to war decisions made by

Holman explained to the crowd
the effects ot nuclear weapons. Ten
1-megaton bombs targeted over the
Bay Area would totally obliterate
buildings over a 500,000 square-mile
area, would cause fires to spread to
an even greater distance, and would
result in millions o! deaths, he said.
Enormous effects
Holman said the enormity of the
possible effects is enough to make
pne numb. "But numbness is an invi
tation to death. It's far better that we
resist," he concluded.
\ Bernstein stressed that Carter "is
in a failure, not a suc
cess," his popularity is in
creasing although he has still not sol
ved the Iranian crisis.
