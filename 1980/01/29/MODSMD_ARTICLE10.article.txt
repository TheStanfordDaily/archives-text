# Earthquake survey leads to predictions

Los Angeles (AP) —
Concerned about rock
layer changes beneath
Southern California, espe
cially near Palmdale, scien
tists soon plan to mount an
intensive survey of the reg
ion that could lead to
cautionary yet non-panicky
quake predictions.
Such advisories and
shock preparedness will be
discussed in a two-day con
ference here this week
sponsored by the U.S.
Geological Survey. And
next month the newly
formed National Ear
thquake Prediction Evalua
tion Council, which is re
sponsible for assessing any
prediction deemed likely to
cause public concern, will
hold its first meeting in
Washington, D.C. to dis
cuss what scientists are find
ing. "In about six weeks
from now, we should have a
much better idea of what's
happening in the Palmdale
area," said Barry Raleigh of
the USCS Menlo Park
center.
The Geological Survey
plans to bring its laser
ranging equipment back to
Southern California early
next month to remeasure
the extent and directions of
strain patterns in the rock
layers. And California Insti
tute ofTechnology plans to
use eight trailer-mounted

seismometers in the
Palmdale area this week to
record small tremors and
any effects they may have in
the plane of the San An
dreas fault.
The reason: Scientists
would like to believe that
large quakes elicit signs of
their development, for
example, in the form of st
rain changes or odd surface
tilts. If the changes do in fact
always occur before a
shock, and if they can be re
corded and interpreted in
time, then scientists hope
they cai. someday predict 01
at least suggest where and
how hard a tremor will
strike.
The stress changes have
been measured, among
other methods, by using ar
rival times of distant quasar
signals in space. A Jet Prop
ulsion Laboratory team
found — after two mea
surements 19 months apart,
the latter last November —
that the |PL station in
Pasadena had moved 4.3 in
ches west.
But no scientist is suggest
ing that the changes taking
place under Southern
California warrant a red, or
even a pink, alert. "These
are not seasonal or even
yearly changes we're se
eing," said Karen McNally, a
Cal Tech researcher.
