## David Sartoris Is there intelligent life on Earth?

The current President ot
Romania could not have put it
more succinctly. With inno
cent Americans held captive in
Iran, bloodshed in Afghanis
tan. and Soviet troops massing
at the borders of Pakistan, Iran,
Czechoslovakia and his own
nation, this individual recently
commented that the world
political situation has not been
as tense since World War 11.
Tragically, despite the many
persistent grim reminders ot
this most recent "war to end all
wars," mankind once again
unds itselt poised for massive
ultra-species conflict.
Every thinking human being
is aware of the undeniable fact

Reflecting on the course of .. . history, it
becomes . . . apparent that mankind has not
long existed without . . . war.

that whenever we collectively
play the game ot war, no one
emerges a Winner. The
triumph ot a government or
ideology is inevitably scarred
by the horrible sacrifices ot in
nocent people.
(irim testimony to that tact is
attorded by a visit to any Un
ited States Veterans Administ
ration hospital, where count
less tormer soldiers who have
given their irreplaceable limbs
or intellects are to be lound.
Or in hospitals on another con
tinent, where, lor example,
lapanese citizens sutler
radiation-induced leukemia
today because ol a senseless
conflict whu h ended in a
blinding tiash while Ihe> were
still in the womb. Examples
such as these justify such ironic
questions as "Is there intelli
gent lite on the planet Earth?."
Reflecting on the course ot
human history, it becomes
readily apparent that mankind
has not long existed without
the plague ol war. Historians
and philosophers have pon

dered for centuries the di
lemma of just why our species
cannot live in peace. Most
would agree with the conclu
sion that aggressive tendencies
are an integral part of human
nature, and that these are the
ultimate driving lorce behind
mass conflict. To explain such a
serious problem in this manner
torces us to accept war and its
consequences as givens, with
out any hope ot eventual
eradication.
Simultaneously, numerous
creative writers have
suggested that the only entity
which could ever succeed at
bringing mankind together
would be a common enemy.

However, lew have recognized
that such a thing already exists:
the inner human mood which
unpredictably expresses itself
as the teelings of hatred, envy
and violence which we all
know so well. That such emo
tions can and often do over
power rationality is undeni
able: the gamut runs trom
meaningless disagreements in
daily social interactions
through child abuse and mur
der to its culmination in the
hell that is war.
The key to overcoming this
tragic torce which incessantly
leads men and nations to light
lies in greater collective em
phasis on attempting to under
stand one another. Regardless
ot race, sex, religion or ideol
ogy, we as human beings share
a single common quest: the
nebulous, olten-elusive leel
ing known as happiness. This
entity is usually achieved
through tultillment ot a de
lined purpose in existence,
and our basic problem as a
species appears to be a dis

torted set of values.
We otten tail to realize that
the needs ot others are not the
same as our own, resulting in a
tendency toward imposition,
opposition and exploitation.
That relatively tew of us can
honestly claim to have found
true happiness in our daily
existence speaks for the fact
that we seek it in the wrong
ways. Particularly in the United
States during the past several
decades, the image ot success
has been detined in terms of
personal gain, usually in the
torm ot financial status and
material wealth.
Contentment becomes an
obvious impossibility in a
world where people are con
ditioned to always want more
lor themselves than feel grate
lul that they do not have less.
Consider again the crippled
American veteran: he has lost
torever man's greatest gift, his
health, all because some ot his
lellow species wanted more.
Personal satisfaction should
instead be sought via sincere
ettorts to interact construc
tively with those around us
each day; whenever we inflict
our own aggressive impulses
on those around us, we only
add fuel to the tire which

reaches its culmination in mass
conflict. The irony of war lies in
the tact that although millions
may tight and die, the causative
decisions result from the emo
tions of relatively few individu
als in positions of prominence.
Appealing to all of the ra
tionality which mankind can
muster, we must not again
allow ourselves to tall into the
grips of a global tragedy. Addi
tion of more missiles to exist
ing senseless arsenals brings
the human race one step closer
to massive annihilation. In
stead, if we must go to war, let
it be against our real enemy â€”
described in the preceding
paragraphs.
Whether or not we will win
will depend upon the sincerity
ot our commitment to making
peaceful interaction a world
priority. Rather than strive to
topple those above us, let us in
the future work toward bring
ing those below us up to our
level.
Time will tell whether our
species has fhe courage to ac
cept this challenge, which will
truly be the "war to end all
wars."
