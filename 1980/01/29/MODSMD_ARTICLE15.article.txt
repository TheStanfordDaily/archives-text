## Clericals on the rise 
### 
The Oltice Staff Organizing
Committee is alive and well.
O.SOC (O sock it to 'em!) has
simply moved into a quieter
phase of its campaign to or
ganize clericals at Stanlord into
a collective bargaining unit.
We are holding dozens ol
small meetings all over the
University and distributing lit
erature dealing with issues.
Next month we plan to show
tilms and sponsor speakers
addressing work-related topics
ot interest to office staff.
OSOC currently has au
thorization cards trom more
than one-third ol the ottice
statl. We have decided to wait
until we have cards trom a
strong majority before peti
tioning the National labor Re
lations Board to authorize an
election here. The reason we
are waiting is simple: we want
to be sure that a majority ot
those voting in the election will
vote "yes" to join United Stan
tord Employees as an au
tonomous bargaining unit ot
clerical employees.
The election campaign can
take months, and we are quite
sure that the administration
will hire the best "consulting
firm" they can tind to convince
people to vote "no." Our
strategy is to build up our
strength as best we can before
taking the steps leading to the
election. The cards keep flow
ing in. Keep em coming.
Now tor some hot stutl.
Since I've been involved in this
organizing drive, I've been

learning. One tact, which in my
ignorance surprised me, is that
we are lar trom being alone.
Clericals are organized all over
the Bay Area! And around the
country.
The ottice stall ot the City ot
Palo Alto are part ol a union
(local 715 ot Service
Employees International Un
ion, ot which U.S.E. is local
680). Also unionized are ottice
workers ol Santa Clara County
and the city ot San )ose! Boston
University has its union for ot
lice stall, and clericals are in
the process ot organizing in
the University ot California sys
tem. Ottice employees in the
Cupertino and Campbell
school districts are unionized.
In private business, espe
cially in banks, ottice workers
are organizing all over this
land. Besides the labor unions,
there are also national associa
tions such as Working Women
and Nine to 112 ive, which are en
couraging and aiding clericals
everywhere to organize them
selves. The movement is upon
us.
Ottice workers, primarily
women, are deciding that they
no longer wish to play the role,
lor their employers, of a
"hedge against inflation."
They want to be paid as much
as the (primarily male)
employees in other tields
whose skills, education, re
sponsibilities are no greater,
and sometimes less, than their
own.
It is time that a secretary be

paid as much as a deliverer or
tree trimmer, time that an ad
ministrative assistant bepaidas
much as a lab technician.
Wages are the most striking is
sue. The principle here is one
of equal pay for work of equal
value.
At the University there are is
sues other than straight wages
to consider, such as being paid
at the level ol the work actually
done. Often, people temporar
ily ior occasionally even per
manently) must take on work
ol someone at a higher classifi
cation, but their salaries re
main at the lower level.
The is called "out ot class"
work and should be compen
sated at the higher level lor
whatever length ol time the
employee is doing the extra
work. The Santa Clara County
union contract provides lor
this compensation.
Another issue is one of job
advancement, almost nil tor
clerical workers here. (Usually,
to advance one has to transfer
to another job.)
And let's address the
nonexempt stall grievance
procedure. What kind ol a
grievance procedure do we
have when the administration
unilaterally makes the rules
and can change them at will,
without consulting those af
fected — the employees!
The University withdrew the
use ol outside arbitration (ex
cept it you are tired or laid oil)
when an employee insisted on
using it against the University's
wishes. The case went to court
and the court ruled that the
University's grievance proce
dure was not a legal right ol
employees, but a dispensation
ol the University.
At present, a sole University
hearing oiticer decides the
outcome ol your grievance and
you have no recourse to chal
lenge the decision. Also, you
cannot contest a policy but can
lile a grievance only if you
think a policy is being violated
by the policymaker (the Uni
versity). There is no provision
lor peer review and no
employee involvement in set
ting the policies.
These are just some of the is
sues to be addressed when we
are in the position to negotiate
our contract, as equals with the
University, at the bargaining
table. The contract between
employer and union is upheld "
by law, and cannot be changed
unilaterally. A union contract is
an employee's protection and
guarantee — and that is what
we want, what our organizing
campaign is all about.

The Oltice Staff Organizing
Committee is alive and well.
O.SOC (O sock it to 'em!) has
simply moved into a quieter
phase of its campaign to or
ganize clericals at Stanlord into
a collective bargaining unit.
We are holding dozens ol
small meetings all over the
University and distributing lit
erature dealing with issues.
Next month we plan to show
tilms and sponsor speakers
addressing work-related topics
ot interest to office staff.
OSOC currently has au
thorization cards trom more
than one-third ol the ottice
statl. We have decided to wait
until we have cards trom a
strong majority before peti
tioning the National labor Re
lations Board to authorize an
election here. The reason we
are waiting is simple: we want
to be sure that a majority ot
those voting in the election will
vote "yes" to join United Stan
tord Employees as an au
tonomous bargaining unit ot
clerical employees.
The election campaign can
take months, and we are quite
sure that the administration
will hire the best "consulting
firm" they can tind to convince
people to vote "no." Our
strategy is to build up our
strength as best we can before
taking the steps leading to the
election. The cards keep flow
ing in. Keep em coming.
Now tor some hot stutl.
Since I've been involved in this
organizing drive, I've been

learning. One tact, which in my
ignorance surprised me, is that
we are lar trom being alone.
Clericals are organized all over
the Bay Area! And around the
country.
The ottice stall ot the City ot
Palo Alto are part ol a union
(local 715 ot Service
Employees International Un
ion, ot which U.S.E. is local
680). Also unionized are ottice
workers ol Santa Clara County
and the city ot San )ose! Boston
University has its union for ot
lice stall, and clericals are in
the process ot organizing in
the University ot California sys
tem. Ottice employees in the
Cupertino and Campbell
school districts are unionized.
In private business, espe
cially in banks, ottice workers
are organizing all over this
land. Besides the labor unions,
there are also national associa
tions such as Working Women
and Nine to 112 ive, which are en
couraging and aiding clericals
everywhere to organize them
selves. The movement is upon
us.
Ottice workers, primarily
women, are deciding that they
no longer wish to play the role,
lor their employers, of a
"hedge against inflation."
They want to be paid as much
as the (primarily male)
employees in other tields
whose skills, education, re
sponsibilities are no greater,
and sometimes less, than their
own.
It is time that a secretary be

paid as much as a deliverer or
tree trimmer, time that an ad
ministrative assistant bepaidas
much as a lab technician.
Wages are the most striking is
sue. The principle here is one
of equal pay for work of equal
value.
At the University there are is
sues other than straight wages
to consider, such as being paid
at the level ol the work actually
done. Often, people temporar
ily ior occasionally even per
manently) must take on work
ol someone at a higher classifi
cation, but their salaries re
main at the lower level.
The is called "out ot class"
work and should be compen
sated at the higher level lor
whatever length ol time the
employee is doing the extra
work. The Santa Clara County
union contract provides lor
this compensation.
Another issue is one of job
advancement, almost nil tor
clerical workers here. (Usually,
to advance one has to transfer
to another job.)
And let's address the
nonexempt stall grievance
procedure. What kind ol a
grievance procedure do we
have when the administration
unilaterally makes the rules
and can change them at will,
without consulting those af
fected — the employees!
The University withdrew the
use ol outside arbitration (ex
cept it you are tired or laid oil)
when an employee insisted on
using it against the University's
wishes. The case went to court
and the court ruled that the
University's grievance proce
dure was not a legal right ol
employees, but a dispensation
ol the University.
At present, a sole University
hearing oiticer decides the
outcome ol your grievance and
you have no recourse to chal
lenge the decision. Also, you
cannot contest a policy but can
lile a grievance only if you
think a policy is being violated
by the policymaker (the Uni
versity). There is no provision
lor peer review and no
employee involvement in set
ting the policies.
These are just some of the is
sues to be addressed when we
are in the position to negotiate
our contract, as equals with the
University, at the bargaining
table. The contract between
employer and union is upheld "
by law, and cannot be changed
unilaterally. A union contract is
an employee's protection and
guarantee — and that is what
we want, what our organizing
campaign is all about.
