Protesting what?
On Thursday, |an. 24, ap
proximately <>00 Stanlord stu
dents attended what was
labeled an anti war rally with its
main speaker, anti-Vietnam ac
tivist, David Harris. Harris
warned oi the implications ot
dralt registration and ot the
possibility oi World War III. He
mentioned that one oj the
primary reasons tor the rally
was to cultivate, at an early
stage, a deep appreciation tor
what the dratt can bring since
many ot us were born too early
to gain that appreciation from
Vietnam.
Harris' points are both timely
and well-taken. It is important
tor the public to analyze in as
rational a manner as is possible
the consequences ot dratt re
gistration.
Yet one must seriously ques
tion whether such an analysis
prevailed at a rally where a
dratt card was symbolically
burned and students chanted
"Hell no, we won't go!" — the
slogan oi the Vietnam era. Was
it an anti-war rally or was it an
anti-Vietnam rally held tor
those ot us who missed out on
the peace movement ot the
60s?
Harris urged us to learn les
sons irom Vietnam since those
who lorget the past are con
demned to repeat it. But it les
sons are to be learned trom the
past, we need to take into con
sideration the dilterent cir
cumstances that surround
each anti-war movement.
Furthermore, we need to
leali/e that there may be sev
eral lessons to be drawn trom
experiences such as Vietnam,
including the otten harmful
bandwagon ellect.
It is true that student rallies,
ex penally those held on the
steps ot Old Union lend them
selves by their very nature to a
bandwagon ellect. What we
must realize is the possibility ot
such a leeling carrying over
into other situations. What is

needed now is not reactionism
nor apathy. The issue is a seri
ous one demanding immediate
attention and caretul scrutiny.
While there are lew predict
able outcomes in the lield ol
internatonal relations, one can
say with a fair deal ol certainty
that the lan. 24 rally marks
merely the beginning ot such
protest movements on cam
pus.
WhaNis more uncertain is
whether that protest move
ment will become an anti-
Vietnam statement complete
with an irrational bandwagon
ettect or whether it will mark a
time ol anti-war sentiment
which has been the by-product
ol individual retlection and
questioning.

Cot it tough?
So another quarter has be
gun; we're all back from ski va
cations, blow-out parties and
holiday leasts, and already
we're worrying and complain
ing. We complain about it rain
ing too much, about the high
cost ol school and of gas and
about lood-service tood. In
short, we're always complain
ing about something. And wor
rying, too.
We worry about our grades,
about this or that assignment,
about boyfriends or
girltriends, about jobs and
about creating the right image.
Mainly we worry about our
own satisfaction, about making
the "best" years this or that;
making them whatever one's
"best" years are supposed to
be.
To a certain extent, ot
course, this is normal. And I'm
not demanding, or even ask
ing, that we change.
I'm just saying, think;
through all our complaints and
worries a young Atghan armed
with a machine gun and a hand
grenade stalks a Russian tank

across fields of snow, engaged
in a real struggle between
basics, between the only
things that really matter — liv
ing and dying.
Keep things in perspective.

Foreign relations?
What Chris Heftel says in his
column (Daily, |an. 8) on the
ignorance of Americans about
what is really going on in the
world is true. But this ignor
ance is not the cause of the
worldwide hatred of America.
No.
It is planned that way by
those who control our gov
ernment. Our foreign service
is well-trained and capable;
but they must follow directives
from above.
This comes out clearly in the
memoirs of Suzanne Albertson
appearing in the Camarillo
(California) Daily News
()an. 13). She is the widow of
Major Robert Perry who was
killed by Palestinian guerillas.
As defense attache to the
American embassy in Jordan
he was supposed to cultivate
good relations between the
United States and Jordanian
military elements by "frequent
cocktail parties." It is no secret
that Jordan is a Moslem coun
try and that Moslems are op
posed to the use of alcohol.
This could not have been
merely ignorance or stupidity.
No. It had to be a deliberate
slap in the face of the Jorda
nians, a deliberate insult.
Albertson says: "Because
the United States had sided
with the Israelis, there was a lot
ot anti-American sentiment in
Jordan." This again is not due
to ignorance. It is deliberate
policy. The American govern
ment sides with the Israelis
while knowing very well that
this infuriates the Moslems.
Looking at the course of his-

Tory from a long-range
perspective, one is inclined to
teel that the state of Israel,
which can never support itself
and must always depend on
subsidies from American lews
and the American government,
must have been created and
maintained primarily in order
to create hostility toward
America in the formerly pro-
American Moslem world.
America is in deep trouble,
both at home and abroad. But
there is a way out. "If my
people, which are called by my
name (Christ), shall humble
themselves, and pray, and seek
my face, and turn from their
wicked ways; then will I hear
from heaven, and will forgive
their sin, and will heal their
land" (2 Chronicles 7:14) .

'Guide' succeeds
Teresa Butzerin, in her letter
on "A Woman's Guide to Stan
ford" (Daily, (an. 22), writes
that she recognizes sexism at
the University and in society
generally, and supports "any
organization which specifically
addresses the problems
women face in our society."
Strangely, however, she says
that she has "never felt any re
stricting sexual barriers."
Her statements, especially
when followed by a comment
on the "stigma of woman
hood," exemplify the con
tradictory feelings many
women have about the effect
sexism has on our lives. But
when it comes down to it, ad
mitting the sexist nature of our
society (and the University's
reflection of it) demands that
we personally face the fact that
we, too, have been distorted
by its disease. Only then can
we begin to effectively resist
sexism.
Butzerin complained about
the negative quality of the quo
tations about men included in
the "Guide." Those statements

were carefully collected last
year from women at Stanford
who spoke of things they really
believe or that really happened
in their lives. Their purpose
was not to vility men (as Butze
rin suggests), but to help wo
men.
While I did not help produce
the "Guide," it was my under
standing from those who did
thatitspurposedid not include
duplication of Approaching
Stanford's efforts to make Stan
ford look attractive to prospec
tive freshpeople.
Rather, I believe it serves an
important (and earlier unfilled)
need by letting women know
both about problems they can
expect to face here and re
sources available to help over
come them. In this, I believe it
succeeded.

Tennis
The Department of Athletics,
Physical Education and Recrea
tion is going to up-grade our
recreational tennis offerings.
We are presented with two op
tions and want to know which
the Stanford community
favors. The two options are:
1) light the existing six Encina
courts (By indicating your pre
ference for this option, would
you use these lighted courts on
an ongoing basis for evening/
night time play?), and
2) build four new courts (ac
ross the street from the Cam
pus Shell station) to be used for
recreational teams only — no
classes, teams.

Rationalizing theft
When I casually inquired of a
cashier at the Stanford

Bookstore why the prices of
books were inscribed indelibly
so that they could be read only
under a special lamp, I was
told, "We have to keep ahead
of the students; they had taken
to erasing and writing in lower
prices."
Also, it was apparent to me
that unusual security measures
have been taken to lessen out
right theft.
Several students and a
couple of faculty members to
whom I mentioned this matter,
rationalized, "Well, the
Bookstore is a special case. It
makes plenty of money; stu
dents are forced to buy the
books; it's a rip-off, etc."
These rationalizations trou
ble me. They are very much
like those of shoplifters (in

Washington, D.C., where I
live) many of whom are men
tally and culturally bereft, aim
less and jobless.
Why is such behavior (and
also the theft of books or pages
from the libraries) by even a
lew students dealt with lightly
and why is it rationalized —
even defended — by other
members of the Stanford
community.
The students and faculty at
Stanford are gifted and to them
much has been given; of them
much is expected.
Why shouldn't dishonesty
by such favored men and
women be a cause of indigna
tion, rather than rationaliza
tion?
