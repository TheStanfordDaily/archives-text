# DG sorority national allows more autonomy

### Jane West 
A recent letter from the national
organization of Delta Gamma soror
ity to Associate Dean of Residential
Education Norman Robinson has
placed new light on the possibility of
official University recognition of
sororities here.
"The letter," said Robinson, "gives
the Delta Gamma sorority blanket
approval to admit whoever it wishes.
But, it is unclear how other aspects of
the conflict between University
guidelines for selective groups and
the sororities' national constitutions
are affected."
The issue of local autonomy and
control over membership choice was
the deciding factor in the University
decision in December to refuse to
grant sorority recognition.
Following that denial, sororities
received letters from Robinson and
the Residential Education evaluating
committee detailing the areas of
their constitutions that needed qual
ification, exemption or revision.
Terri Dobbels, president of Delta
Gamma, said that her national sorori
ty's letter to Robinson rectified one
problem mentioned by the Univer
sity. "A clause in our national con
stitution, stating that re-pledges,
graduateand married students could

not pledge admission to the sorority,
was waived," she said.
"Vet," she added, "two other
problems that were also stated in the
letter from Robinson must be cleared
up."
Positive
"I think this is a step in the right
direction," said Robinson. "My feel
ing is positive, but there are still
some unanswered questions in areas
that involve local autonomy."
If Delta Gamma does receive rec
ognition, the sorority will face a
major decision, whether or not to
break with other local sororities.
When Stanford sororities were
first organized under the Inter Soror
ity Council, they agreed to remain a
unit. Although each of their applica
tions for recognition was treated in
dividually by Robinson and the
Committee on Student Services, the
sororities, aware that their national
constitutions would pose different
problems, all chose to abide by the
same University decision.
Rift potential
Dobbels said, however, that "if the
DC.s are recognized, we will accept
recognition but continue to have
off-campus rush. We want to be able
to have functions on campus, but we
