# DG sorority national allows more autonomy
## 
### Jane West 
A recent letter from the national
organization of Delta Gamma soror
ity to Associate Dean of Residential
Education Norman Robinson has
placed new light on the possibility of
official University recognition of
sororities here.
"The letter," said Robinson, "gives
the Delta Gamma sorority blanket
approval to admit whoever it wishes.
But, it is unclear how other aspects of
the conflict between University
guidelines for selective groups and
the sororities' national constitutions
are affected."
The issue of local autonomy and
control over membership choice was
the deciding factor in the University
decision in December to refuse to
grant sorority recognition.
Following that denial, sororities
received letters from Robinson and
the Residential Education evaluating
committee detailing the areas of
their constitutions that needed qual
ification, exemption or revision.
Terri Dobbels, president of Delta
Gamma, said that her national sorori
ty's letter to Robinson rectified one
problem mentioned by the Univer
sity. "A clause in our national con
stitution, stating that re-pledges,
graduateand married students could

not pledge admission to the sorority,
was waived," she said.
"Vet," she added, "two other
problems that were also stated in the
letter from Robinson must be cleared
up."
Positive
"I think this is a step in the right
direction," said Robinson. "My feel
ing is positive, but there are still
some unanswered questions in areas
that involve local autonomy."
If Delta Gamma does receive rec
ognition, the sorority will face a
major decision, whether or not to
break with other local sororities.
When Stanford sororities were
first organized under the Inter Soror
ity Council, they agreed to remain a
unit. Although each of their applica
tions for recognition was treated in
dividually by Robinson and the
Committee on Student Services, the
sororities, aware that their national
constitutions would pose different
problems, all chose to abide by the
same University decision.
Rift potential
Dobbels said, however, that "if the
DC.s are recognized, we will accept
recognition but continue to have
off-campus rush. We want to be able
to have functions on campus, but we
also want to be fair to other
sororities." She said that if her soror
ity led the way, other sororities might
follow that direction.
Other sorority leaders viewed the
situation somewhat differently.
Delta Gamma acceptance of rec
ognition "would be a breach of the
Inter Sorority Council, and it might
even hurt the sorority," said Pam
Hutchcraft, the president of Kappa
Alpha Theta.
Maureen Doherty, president of
Alpha Omicron Pi, said, "A sense of
unity must be upheld. One recog
nized sorority will not be all that suc
cessful."
Mixed emotions
"It could be very positive," said
Alpha Phi president Kathy Kohrman.
"Other nationals might feel forced to
compromise. But,itcouldalsobede
trimental to the system and the
group. A bias might develop towards
the one recognized group because
they will be able to meet on campus
and attact more people for rush.
Women should not pledge a sorority
for matters of convenience," she
said.
Triangular trade
The nationals, the local sororities
and the University are involved in a
delicate triangle of compromise and
conciliation, as they seek solutions
for recognition. Representatives of
the local sororities serve as inter
mediary forces between the Univer
sity and the national bodies.
"As the University representative
in this matter, I will not get involved
with the national organizations,"
Robinson said. "The interaction will
occur between the students and the
nationals."
Doherty reported that she recently
received a letter from her national
indicating that no changes would be

made in its constitution. "No waiver
will be sent because an exception
cannot be made. It appears no one
will get a total waiver," she said.
The presidents of the sororities
met yesterday with Diana Conklin,
associate dean of Residential Educa
tion to discuss future plans.
"I intend to meet with each presi
dent and to discuss in detail what the
problems are. I want to make it very
clear what presents a conflict and
what are possible strategies," Con
klin said.
"They (the sororities) are eager for
resolution and so are we. I'm giving it
high priority at this moment," she
added.

"I think this is a step in the right
direction," said Robinson. "My feel
ing is positive, but there are still
some unanswered questions in areas
that involve local autonomy."
If Delta Gamma does receive rec
ognition, the sorority will face a
major decision, whether or not to
break with other local sororities.
When Stanford sororities were
first organized under the Inter Soror
ity Council, they agreed to remain a
unit. Although each of their applica
tions for recognition was treated in
dividually by Robinson and the
Committee on Student Services, the
sororities, aware that their national
constitutions would pose different
problems, all chose to abide by the
same University decision.
Rift potential
Dobbels said, however, that "if the
DC.s are recognized, we will accept
recognition but continue to have
off-campus rush. We want to be able
to have functions on campus, but we
also want to be fair to other
sororities." She said that if her soror
ity led the way, other sororities might
follow that direction.
Other sorority leaders viewed the
situation somewhat differently.
Delta Gamma acceptance of rec
ognition "would be a breach of the
Inter Sorority Council, and it might
even hurt the sorority," said Pam
Hutchcraft, the president of Kappa
Alpha Theta.
Maureen Doherty, president of
Alpha Omicron Pi, said, "A sense of
unity must be upheld. One recog
nized sorority will not be all that suc
cessful."
Mixed emotions
"It could be very positive," said
Alpha Phi president Kathy Kohrman.
"Other nationals might feel forced to
compromise. But,itcouldalsobede
trimental to the system and the
group. A bias might develop towards
the one recognized group because
they will be able to meet on campus
and attact more people for rush.
Women should not pledge a sorority
for matters of convenience," she
said.
Triangular trade
The nationals, the local sororities
and the University are involved in a
delicate triangle of compromise and
conciliation, as they seek solutions
for recognition. Representatives of
the local sororities serve as inter
mediary forces between the Univer
sity and the national bodies.
"As the University representative
in this matter, I will not get involved
with the national organizations,"
Robinson said. "The interaction will
occur between the students and the
nationals."
Doherty reported that she recently
received a letter from her national
indicating that no changes would be

made in its constitution. "No waiver
will be sent because an exception
cannot be made. It appears no one
will get a total waiver," she said.
The presidents of the sororities
met yesterday with Diana Conklin,
associate dean of Residential Educa
tion to discuss future plans.
"I intend to meet with each presi
dent and to discuss in detail what the
problems are. I want to make it very
clear what presents a conflict and
what are possible strategies," Con
klin said.
"They (the sororities) are eager for
resolution and so are we. I'm giving it
high priority at this moment," she
added.
A recent letter from the national
organization of Delta Gamma soror
ity to Associate Dean of Residential
Education Norman Robinson has
placed new light on the possibility of
official University recognition of
sororities here.
"The letter," said Robinson, "gives
the Delta Gamma sorority blanket
approval to admit whoever it wishes.
But, it is unclear how other aspects of
the conflict between University
guidelines for selective groups and
the sororities' national constitutions
are affected."
The issue of local autonomy and
control over membership choice was
the deciding factor in the University
decision in December to refuse to
grant sorority recognition.
Following that denial, sororities
received letters from Robinson and
the Residential Education evaluating
committee detailing the areas of
their constitutions that needed qual
ification, exemption or revision.
Terri Dobbels, president of Delta
Gamma, said that her national sorori
ty's letter to Robinson rectified one
problem mentioned by the Univer
sity. "A clause in our national con
stitution, stating that re-pledges,
graduateand married students could

not pledge admission to the sorority,
was waived," she said.
"Vet," she added, "two other
problems that were also stated in the
letter from Robinson must be cleared
up."

"I think this is a step in the right
direction," said Robinson. "My feel
ing is positive, but there are still
some unanswered questions in areas
