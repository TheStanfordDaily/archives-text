# Toy contest inspires inventors

Boxes beeped, slime oozed
trom plastic garbage cbns, and
a miniature tractor trailer
careened wildly into a wall.
Doas this sound like a story of
technology gone bad? No, this
all took place peacefully in
Terman Engineering Cepter
last week as Mattel presehted
an introduction of its fourth
annual design competition for
University students. Electronic
games, "Slime" and remote
control trucks were only a few
ot the toys that Mattel brought
to inspire future inventors.
The contest is meant to en
courage student designers to
invent, design, construct and
demonstrate a recreational
product tor adults or children.
Mattel initiated the Univer
sity competition in 1977 in
order to generate ideas from
an outside source, one not
familiar with the operation of a
toy company. The perfect
source seemed to be Stanford
students, because they often
work for the company in the
summer and about 25 are hired
each year for permanent
employment.
Stanford is the only school at
which Mattel runs the competi
tion.
An audience of about 100 lis
tened as Mattel representa
tives gave a history of the com
pany, from its initial product —
a moderately successful au
tomatic cap gun — to its top
selling Barbie doll, which has
grossed $1.5 billion in its 21-
year lifetime.
A film on tops shown during
the presentation de
monstrated that even some
thing which is 2000 or 3000
years old can be re-worked and
improved.
Cathy Chalmars, a 1979 Uni
versity graduate, showed
slides detailing the whole pro
duction ot a crawling doll. The
film spanned the entire pro
duction process — from the
brainstorming session of the
inventors, to the intricate
blueprints of the doll's insides,
to the completed package.
Finally, Gene Kilroy, director
of preliminary design for the
company, outlined the rules of
the contest.
"It's a learning experience,"
he said, "but it's painless —100
percent fun."
He suggested that if students

think ot an idea early, then just
spend 10 or 15 minutes a day on
it, they can develop it for the
contest.
"Look at the Sears catalog for
ideas. It's an encyclopedia of
toys," Kilroy said. "Dream,
visit a museum, or just improve
on an old idea."
Guidelines for the competi
tion are simple. The idea
should be a unique concept
that is entertaining and excit
ing, and it should be a safe,
durable product. The concept
should be easy to comumuni
cate through the promotional

media, and it should be man
utacturable at a reasonable
cost.
All University students are
eligible to compete, judging
will take place on April 17 and
18, as students give 10-minute
presentations of their pro
ducts. Prizes range from $2000
for first place to $500 for fourth.
Three-time winner Scott
Waketield, a fifth-year student
in electrical engineering, says
he went the first time just to
help a triend. Their invention
was a bicycle speedometer that
took third prize. The next year

Wakefield took second place
with a steerable truck with
memory. But he says, "My
lavorite was 'Toss me Tony,' a
doll that sang whenever it de
tected that it was in free-fall."
"Tony" was awarded honora
ble mention.
So if you've ever had an idea
for a toy or a game, this is your
big chance to get out the
sketch pad or blowtorch and
create it. There is always the
chance that you'll be like the
man who re-designed the top
— and made enough money in
royalties to retire for life.
