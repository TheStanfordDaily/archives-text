# Students protest Soviet aggression
## New group back tough moves 
### Joel Irby 
There are still many people
who never express their views
on current politics. A small
group of students on campus
decided to remove themselves
from that category this past
week.
They call themselves Stu
dents Against Soviet Aggres
sion (SASA). They joined to
gether just last Thursday in re
sponse to the dissidence that
suddenly cropped up after
President jimmy Carter's State
of the Union address in which
he advocated registration for
the draft.
"We feel that now is the time
to stand behind the president
in this time of crisis," said
Frank Daly, a junior and one of
the founders of the group.
They're backing Carter's
stand on the Olympic boycott
and they say that his move on
the registration issue is not a
move toward war but a means
of showing national will, unity
and preparedness against
Soviet aggression in Afghanis
tan.
"Appeasement is no way to
world peace," said Pete Pierce,
a sophomore and SASA
member. "We support Carter's
firm stand against the Soviet
aggression as a show of solidar
ity in this time of national di
lemma."
Yet the members stress that
they are not advocating Car
ter's re-election, just public
support for his tough stance on
Soviet aggression.

"We don't want to see this
country go to war, and we
hope what this president is
doing will avoid a war," Daly
said. "I think what is funda
mentally important in this situ
ation is that we show our sup
port, because that is the only
way we can avoid a war."
SASA members believe this
support will avoid a war be
cause U.S. adversaries will be
come aware and cautious of
America's national will and de
termination to stop Soviet ag
gression now.
Members are trying to find
prominent national figures
who are willing to speak out in
support of actions against the
Soviets.
Senior Jim Issacs, a group
member, said the organization
hopes to receive funds from
the Stanford Committee On
Political Education (SCOPE) to
pay for an eminent speaker in
the near future.
"We are also in the process
of making organizational con

tacts with other sympathetic
political groups on campus,"
he added.
In this way they hope to in
crease community support for
the government's foreign pol
icy and thereby increase its ef
fectiveness.
Daly said, "It's a sad reflec
tion of this campus thatyou see
no demonstrations in support
of the 50 hostages and no up
roar over the genocide that the
Vietnamese are practicing in
Cambodia. The only time you
can get a reaction out of this
campus is when it affects the
students personally."
Although they have had no
organizational meetings thus
far, they have been able to gain
a membership of 22 students
through word of mouth.
Isaacs said, "We hope our
views will extend to groups on
other campuses as well. We've
had an excellent start and the
potential of many of our pre
sently confidential contacts
makes us very optimistic."
