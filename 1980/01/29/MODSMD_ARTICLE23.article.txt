# Nuclear power necessary for short-term says Richter
## 
### Krisan Froelich 
Nik lear power is the only short-term solu
tion to the energy t risis, according to Nobel
laureate Burton Richter.
"I see no other way lor the next 20 or 10
years," Richtei told a group ot 15 students in
a llorence Moore sherry Hour last Thurs
day- "We need nuclear power lor an interim
period. When we can switch to something
less dangerous, we'll do it."
'Greenhouse effect'
In a talk called "Bargaining With The Devil
— tner»y Sources lor a I inite World,' Kich
ter named problems with all energy alterna
tives. But his mam emphasis concerned the
"greenhouse ellect."
Burning lossil tuel increases the carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Since carbon
dioxide retains heat, it will raise the average
world temperature, changing the areas
where lood ran be grown.
' The amount oi CO(2i will double by

about 2040 without any increase in energy
use," Kichter said, "from my point oi view,
carbon dioxide is our biggest time bomb."

Laboratory, and became a protessor in 1%0.

He shared the 197b Nobel Pri/e lor Physics
with protessor Samuel Ting of MIT for their
independent discoveries ot a lamily ol sub
atomic particles.
Kichter listed tour alternatives to the
energy crisis conservation (which he said
should be done regardless), fission, fu

sion and solar power generation. However,
lusion and solai are not yet technically and
economically possible, he said.
"Solar power is a very diiluse source. The
most difficult things tor solar to develop are
centrally generated power. The easy thing
lor solar is heating and cooling applications.
It could potentially handle about 20 percent
ol the U.S. energy demand, but it would not
take about if) years to install."
Fusion reactions
According to Kichter, energy from lusion
reactions — turning heavy hydrogen into
helium — is no closer. The next "big test"
will prove scientitic leasibility. "Ol course,
they've been saying that lor years, but I think
they're right now," Richter said. "However,
alter that they must prove engineering and
economic leasibility."
The most optimistic estimate dates the
lirst demonstration ot a lusion reactor at
1995. "It will be 20 to 50 years alter that until

they're on the market."
Richter's linal alternative was tisston. "But
that's close to being unacceptable in society,
and it takes a long time to build a nuclear
plant," he said.
Radioactive waste
Though he acknowledges the danger,
Richter thinks safety and radioactive waste

'The message is not that I love
nuclear reactors. I don't see
any other alternative/

disposal problems are solvable. He calls
waste disposal more a "political" than a
technical problem.
"We need to train operators better, make

plants better and make the regulations bet
ter." Kichter said. "Nuclear power is
dangerous. It must bevery carelully handled
and controlled."
Kichter considered starting a group
named "Environmentalists lor Nuclear
Power,'' but dropped the idea alter teed
back trom his tamily.
No alternative
"The message is not that I love nuclear
reactors. I don't see any other alternative,"
Kichter explained. "We're playing dice with
the environment putting CO(2) up there.
Carbon dioxide is a problem not well under
stood, but we're looking at it from the best
model we've got. Can we attord to say it's
wrong?"
Because students are the "backbone" of
people against nuclear power, Kichter con
cluded with a challenge to them to lace the
energy problem. "It anything is going to get
done, it must be you wi.o are going to do it."

energy problem. "It anything is going to get
done, it must be you wi.o are going to do it."
Nik lear power is the only short-term solu
tion to the energy t risis, according to Nobel
laureate Burton Richter.
"I see no other way lor the next 20 or 10
years," Richtei told a group ot 15 students in
a llorence Moore sherry Hour last Thurs
day- "We need nuclear power lor an interim
period. When we can switch to something
less dangerous, we'll do it."
'Greenhouse effect'
In a talk called "Bargaining With The Devil
— tner»y Sources lor a I inite World,' Kich
ter named problems with all energy alterna
tives. But his mam emphasis concerned the
"greenhouse ellect."
Burning lossil tuel increases the carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere. Since carbon
dioxide retains heat, it will raise the average
world temperature, changing the areas
where lood ran be grown.
' The amount oi CO(2i will double by

about 2040 without any increase in energy
use," Kichter said, "from my point oi view,
carbon dioxide is our biggest time bomb."
Nobel pri/e winner
Kichter came to Stanford in 1956 as a re
search associate in the High Energy Physics
Laboratory, and became a protessor in 1%0.

'From my point of view,
carbon dioxide is our biggest
time bomb/

He shared the 197b Nobel Pri/e lor Physics
with protessor Samuel Ting of MIT for their
independent discoveries ot a lamily ol sub
atomic particles.
Kichter listed tour alternatives to the
energy crisis conservation (which he said
should be done regardless), fission, fu

sion and solar power generation. However,
lusion and solai are not yet technically and
economically possible, he said.
"Solar power is a very diiluse source. The
most difficult things tor solar to develop are
centrally generated power. The easy thing
lor solar is heating and cooling applications.
It could potentially handle about 20 percent
ol the U.S. energy demand, but it would not
take about if) years to install."
Fusion reactions
According to Kichter, energy from lusion
reactions — turning heavy hydrogen into
helium — is no closer. The next "big test"
will prove scientitic leasibility. "Ol course,
they've been saying that lor years, but I think
they're right now," Richter said. "However,
alter that they must prove engineering and
economic leasibility."
The most optimistic estimate dates the
lirst demonstration ot a lusion reactor at
1995. "It will be 20 to 50 years alter that until

they're on the market."
Richter's linal alternative was tisston. "But
that's close to being unacceptable in society,
and it takes a long time to build a nuclear
plant," he said.
Radioactive waste
Though he acknowledges the danger,
Richter thinks safety and radioactive waste

'The message is not that I love
nuclear reactors. I don't see
any other alternative/

disposal problems are solvable. He calls
waste disposal more a "political" than a
technical problem.
"We need to train operators better, make

plants better and make the regulations bet
ter." Kichter said. "Nuclear power is
dangerous. It must bevery carelully handled
and controlled."
Kichter considered starting a group
named "Environmentalists lor Nuclear
Power,'' but dropped the idea alter teed
back trom his tamily.
No alternative
"The message is not that I love nuclear
reactors. I don't see any other alternative,"
Kichter explained. "We're playing dice with
the environment putting CO(2) up there.
Carbon dioxide is a problem not well under
stood, but we're looking at it from the best
model we've got. Can we attord to say it's
wrong?"
Because students are the "backbone" of
people against nuclear power, Kichter con
cluded with a challenge to them to lace the
energy problem. "It anything is going to get
done, it must be you wi.o are going to do it."
