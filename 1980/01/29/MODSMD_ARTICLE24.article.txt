## Fierce-swinging, lyrical Joe Pass 
### 
Soaring soloing and subtle
hi.mor on Sunday night were
all lor l\i*< needed to convince
mam in ihe nearly sold-out
audieihi- :hat he is one ot the
most eloquent perlormers to
bestow Ins total virtuosity on
the st.inloid campus in quite
some time.
However, betore Pass could
display that virtuosity in his
one-hour sets, another
guitarist, Tuck Andress, and a
soulful singer, Patti Cathcart,
pleasantly surprised the audi
ence with an array ot songs
ranging from Jimi Hendrix to
Stevie Wonder to Sara Vaughn
selections. They were very
good, although they didn't
quite complement one another
perfectly. Cathcart's voice has
limited range, and Andress
seems to lack either skill or
confidence when playing the
slower, quieter passages.
It was in these kinds ot pas
sages that Andress could have
taken a lesson trom Pass. And
indeed, he might have, as he
came out in the second set and
played a creative, fluent solo
rendition ot Billy loel's "lust
the Way You Are" alter Pass
had made the same song come
alive in his first set. Cathcart is a
pretty good scat singer, and

she seems capable, as she was
Sunday, ol expressing her sin
cerity. They were warmly re
ceived and in the second show
even got called back for an en
core.
Andress was a music majorat
Stanford, entering in 1972, and
now he is playing gigs lot .tlly
with Cathcart. They can be
heard for the next couple ol
weeks at the Antique on Friday
nights.
"Would you please welcome
|oe Pass," was all the introduc
tion the master guitarist
needed as he carefully stepped
onto the stage. Without saying
a word he began to tine-tune
his guitar, playing a lew notes.
Then he played a tew more,
and then a few more, until
quite unexpectedly he was into
his first ballad of the evening,
the jazz classic " Round Mid
night."
Continuing to play jazz clas
sics all night, the small, bald
headed man with a moustache
matching the color ot his gray
slacks never let up. Fhe man is
incomparable, a total virtuoso.
He is a sensitive, lyrical soloist
with a warm and sonorous
tone. He is capable ol swinging
fiercely at fast tempos and of
exceptional harmonic imagina

tion on ballads.
He chose on this night to
stick almost exclusively with
his ballads. "On Green Dol
phin Street," "How High the
Moon," "As Time Goes By,"
and a Porgy and Hess medley
were a few selections Pass per
formed. Several of these selec
tions were played in the first
show, repeated in the second
show, and first played when he
performed at Stanlord last
year. Vet each version was just
as fresh and exciting as the
others.
An outstanding example of
the guitarist's creativity was his
treatment ot the John Coltrane
classic, "As Time Goes By."
Pass played it as his encore
selection in the lirsf set and as
part ol his regular second set.
In the encore it was a delicate,
fragile item that produced a
sentimentality matched by
lew, il any other, guitar solos I
have experienced. In the sec
ond set the tune was played
up-tempo with wild improvisa
!>iiM. Both were great. Both
produced emotion. Both were
the same but so very different.
Born in New Brunswick,
New lersey, during the Depre
ssion, Joseph Anthony Pas
salaqua has seen and played

through a variety of jazz eras.
Throughout the years he has
played with such diverse com
pany as frank Sinatra, les
McCann, Benny Goodman,
Ella Fitzgerald and Duke El
lington. He has played profes
sionally since the '40s and re
ally only recently has gained
the fame due him.
At 51 years of age, Pass has
lost none ol his sensitivity or
his humor. He still plays bal
lads that make you think about
sitting in Iront of a crackling
lire on a cold winter night with
someone you love, listening to
his gentleness of sound. The
ballads that come from his
guitar are so mesmerizing and
relaxing that while you strain to
make sure you catch every
priceless note, it is not un
common to find yourseli melt
ing away.
But Pass won't allow that to
go on for too long, as he will
suddenfly shift into high speed
and get everyone snapping
their fingers or keeping the
beat with their feet, or just
moving their heads around.
Often he will be flailing away
on his guitar strings with his
incredible improvisational im
agination, and suddenly out of
nowhere, he will uo into a com

ically simple, slowed-down
vamp.
He rarely speaks, but when
he does it's usually to discuss
the songs he has played, to
share a simple anecdote or to
throw out an even simpler pun.
He is subtle in all that he does,
making everything seem much
easier than it is.
As he gently picks at his
strings, his intensity is re
flected in the constant contor
tions oi his facial exprassions.
As the notes soar from his
amplified extension, they are
accompanied only by the
rhythmic thud of a shoeless
loot keeping beat on a wooden
stage.
In the simplest sense he is a
soloist. A soloist others would
do well to emulate. He creates,
contours and captures the
notes, the audience, an aura.
His music is jazz, the kind of
music many people didn't even
know they could like.
He is not really a soloist,
though. He is a big band. He is
a blues band or a pop band. He
is a trio or sometimes a duo.
|oe Pass stands alone, but that
doesn't mean he's just a sol
oist.

Then he played a tew more,
and then a few more, until
quite unexpectedly he was into
his first ballad of the evening,
the jazz classic " Round Mid
night."
Continuing to play jazz clas
sics all night, the small, bald
headed man with a moustache
matching the color ot his gray
slacks never let up. Fhe man is
incomparable, a total virtuoso.
He is a sensitive, lyrical soloist
with a warm and sonorous
tone. He is capable ol swinging
fiercely at fast tempos and of
exceptional harmonic imagina

tion on ballads.
He chose on this night to
stick almost exclusively with
his ballads. "On Green Dol
phin Street," "How High the
Moon," "As Time Goes By,"
and a Porgy and Hess medley
were a few selections Pass per
formed. Several of these selec
tions were played in the first
show, repeated in the second
show, and first played when he
performed at Stanlord last
year. Vet each version was just
as fresh and exciting as the
others.
An outstanding example of
the guitarist's creativity was his
treatment ot the John Coltrane
classic, "As Time Goes By."
Pass played it as his encore
selection in the lirsf set and as
part ol his regular second set.
In the encore it was a delicate,
fragile item that produced a
sentimentality matched by
lew, il any other, guitar solos I
have experienced. In the sec
ond set the tune was played
up-tempo with wild improvisa
!>iiM. Both were great. Both
produced emotion. Both were
the same but so very different.
Born in New Brunswick,
New lersey, during the Depre
ssion, Joseph Anthony Pas
salaqua has seen and played

through a variety of jazz eras.
Throughout the years he has
played with such diverse com
pany as frank Sinatra, les
McCann, Benny Goodman,
Ella Fitzgerald and Duke El
lington. He has played profes
sionally since the '40s and re
ally only recently has gained
the fame due him.
At 51 years of age, Pass has
lost none ol his sensitivity or
his humor. He still plays bal
lads that make you think about
sitting in Iront of a crackling
lire on a cold winter night with
someone you love, listening to
his gentleness of sound. The
ballads that come from his
guitar are so mesmerizing and
relaxing that while you strain to
make sure you catch every
priceless note, it is not un
common to find yourseli melt
ing away.
But Pass won't allow that to
go on for too long, as he will
suddenfly shift into high speed
and get everyone snapping
their fingers or keeping the
beat with their feet, or just
moving their heads around.
Often he will be flailing away
on his guitar strings with his
incredible improvisational im
agination, and suddenly out of
nowhere, he will uo into a com

ically simple, slowed-down
vamp.
He rarely speaks, but when
he does it's usually to discuss
the songs he has played, to
share a simple anecdote or to
throw out an even simpler pun.
He is subtle in all that he does,
making everything seem much
easier than it is.
As he gently picks at his
strings, his intensity is re
flected in the constant contor
tions oi his facial exprassions.
As the notes soar from his
amplified extension, they are
accompanied only by the
rhythmic thud of a shoeless
loot keeping beat on a wooden
stage.
In the simplest sense he is a
soloist. A soloist others would
do well to emulate. He creates,
contours and captures the
notes, the audience, an aura.
His music is jazz, the kind of
music many people didn't even
know they could like.
He is not really a soloist,
though. He is a big band. He is
a blues band or a pop band. He
is a trio or sometimes a duo.
|oe Pass stands alone, but that
doesn't mean he's just a sol
oist.

Soaring soloing and subtle
hi.mor on Sunday night were
all lor l\i*< needed to convince
mam in ihe nearly sold-out
audieihi- :hat he is one ot the
most eloquent perlormers to
bestow Ins total virtuosity on
the st.inloid campus in quite
some time.
However, betore Pass could
display that virtuosity in his
one-hour sets, another
guitarist, Tuck Andress, and a
soulful singer, Patti Cathcart,
pleasantly surprised the audi
ence with an array ot songs
ranging from Jimi Hendrix to
Stevie Wonder to Sara Vaughn
selections. They were very
good, although they didn't
quite complement one another
perfectly. Cathcart's voice has
limited range, and Andress
seems to lack either skill or
confidence when playing the
slower, quieter passages.
It was in these kinds ot pas
sages that Andress could have
taken a lesson trom Pass. And
indeed, he might have, as he
came out in the second set and
played a creative, fluent solo
rendition ot Billy loel's "lust
the Way You Are" alter Pass
had made the same song come
alive in his first set. Cathcart is a
pretty good scat singer, and

she seems capable, as she was
Sunday, ol expressing her sin
cerity. They were warmly re
ceived and in the second show
even got called back for an en
core.
Andress was a music majorat
Stanford, entering in 1972, and
now he is playing gigs lot .tlly
with Cathcart. They can be
heard for the next couple ol
weeks at the Antique on Friday
nights.

needed as he carefully stepped
