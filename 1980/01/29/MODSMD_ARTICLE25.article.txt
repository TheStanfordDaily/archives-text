# Rock critic on the run
## 
### 
The fact that rock criticism is
largely populated by hacks,
who plainly just don't know or
care about the music, causes
many fans — justifiably — to
not pay any attention to it.
As its many flops indicate,
rock criticism is a high-wire af
fair. The record audience, in
dustry and performer all lend
to be mercurial in their
"tastes"; the shifts come with
out warning and, sometimes,
they're unfathomable. It's a sea
of rhetorical excess that you've
got to struggle through, and
it's all a critic can do to keep
some degree of consistency;
indeed, a remarkable number
of critics throw in the towel
well before such a battle is
even joined.
So, where compromise
often is equated with survival,
Dave Marsh keeps up the fight.
Marsh, who is most widely
known for his criticism for Rol
ling Stone, recently published
a book, Born to Run: The Bruce
Springsteen Story.
Marsh, 29, went to work at
and later became editor of
Creem at 19. This move fol
lowed an abortive stint at
Wayne State University. After
leaving Creem in 1973, he took
jobs at Newsday and Boston's
Real Paper. In 1975, Marsh
went to work at Rolling Stone.
He quit his editorial duties at
the magazine in 1978 in order
to devote himself to writing.
As a critic, Marsh is maturing
rapidly; at present, he's argu
ably the best rock reviewer in
the country. His writing is
pointed, tough-minded — he's
hardly a consensus seeker. His
favorite artists range from Sly
Stone to The Who.
Marsh's sharpness often is
polarizing, and he seems to re
lish this. His celebrated com
ment that "Bob Dylan is ir
relevant" after the release of
1978's Street-Legal, and his
panning of the Rolling Stones
in a concert review that same

year placed Marsh in the
center of considerable con
troversy.
Not surprisingly, Marsh
sticks by his statements. "Dy
lan is irrelevant. That's not to
dismiss everything he's ever
done — that's just to say, right
now, Bob Dylan doesn't have
anything to do with what's
going on. He's not in tune with
anything except for his own
solipsistic mind.
"I mean, Kris Kristofferson
wrote ')esus was a carpenter
and now Bob Dylan can write
'lesus was a solipsist' and he
will have really performed his
function.
As for the Stones, Marsh said
that they should have been
"forcibly retired" five years
ago. Their last album, Some
Girls was "a fairly lousy album
— for the Stones," according
to Marsh. "If somebody else
had their name on that record
— say, Sandburg and Weisman
nobody would have gotten
worked up over that music.
Marsh also is critical of Rol
ling Stone magazine. He has
never really liked the magazine
and said that it's "gotten
worse," largely because editor
lann Wenner is less involved in
the magazine than he has been
in the past. "The other prob
lem at Rolling Stone is that
their editors mostly don't like
music."
Marsh was especially upset
at the recent Rolling Stone
cover story about the tragedy
at The Who concert in Cincin
nati. Marsh called the cover
picture of the 11 victims
"exploitative and disgusting."
But most of the conversation
centered on Springsteen and
Marsh's book. Marsh said that
the book is an "unauthorized"
biography because "I wanted
to make clear that what I was
saying was what I was saying,
not what Bruce would have
said. There were things in the


Dave Marsh
hook winch I didn't think
Bruce wanted to endorse
about other performers
mostly." In the book, Marsh is
typically uncompromising in
his negative view ot people like
Linda Ronstadt. Springsteen is
the same.
He admits that he doesn't
hide his "messianic regard" lor
Springsteen in the book.
that's pretty well unhideable.
Besides I wrote this book for
people who already liked
Springsteen. If the fans are
happy, then I'm happy."
Springsteen 'likes the
book, I think,'' said Marsh. "At
least he said he did. Bruce had
a really tunny reaction to mak
ing the trade best-seller list. He
went out and bought The New
York Times for one ot the lew
times in Ins lite because he
didn't believe me."
Marsh wasn't sure why
Springsteen got involved in the

recent MUSf (Musicians Un
ited lor Safe Energy) anti
nuclear concerts and album,
but he guessed that il was be
( ause "three Mile Island upset
him a lot." Marsh pointed out
that Springsteen's silence on
Ins motives meant "that Bruce
is too smart to say anything."
Springsteen's live shows are
olten bootlegged, and he re
cently initiated action to sue
various groups responsible lor
the recordings. Marsh de
tended Springsteen's a< tion,
saying thai "bootlegging is
morally wrong, because it's
stealing a guy s labor. Also,
bootleggers don't seem to
realize how bootlegging slows
down the recording process.
"Everybody bitches about
why Bruce doesn't put out par
ticular songs, Marsh con
tinued. "The bootlegs are part
ot the reason. People listen to
the new songs on the boot
legs; when you put il on you're

new studio release, they're al
ready bored with it.
Marsh ridiculed a suggestion
that Springsteen, iO, may be
slowing down. "That point is
way on down the road" for
"The Boss." Marsh, too, seems
to have many great writing years
left; indeed, he seems
nowhere near his peak yet.
The great gilt thai Marsh has,
and it's a rare one, is his ability
to give articulate expression to
that crystalline moment in rock
when an artist and audience
come together in a seemingly
indescribable emotional fu
sion. It's a very pure moment,
when you know that finally, for
some miraculous reason,
you're at the right place at the
right time.
Artists like Springsteen and
The Who have supplied many
ot those moments, and gutsy
critics like Marsh have made
sure that people don't forget

The fact that rock criticism is
largely populated by hacks,
who plainly just don't know or
care about the music, causes
many fans — justifiably — to
not pay any attention to it.
As its many flops indicate,
rock criticism is a high-wire af
fair. The record audience, in
dustry and performer all lend
to be mercurial in their
"tastes"; the shifts come with
out warning and, sometimes,
they're unfathomable. It's a sea
of rhetorical excess that you've
got to struggle through, and
it's all a critic can do to keep
some degree of consistency;
indeed, a remarkable number
of critics throw in the towel
well before such a battle is
even joined.
So, where compromise
often is equated with survival,
Dave Marsh keeps up the fight.
Marsh, who is most widely
known for his criticism for Rol
ling Stone, recently published
a book, Born to Run: The Bruce
Springsteen Story.
Marsh, 29, went to work at
and later became editor of
Creem at 19. This move fol
lowed an abortive stint at
Wayne State University. After
leaving Creem in 1973, he took
jobs at Newsday and Boston's
Real Paper. In 1975, Marsh
went to work at Rolling Stone.
He quit his editorial duties at
the magazine in 1978 in order
to devote himself to writing.
As a critic, Marsh is maturing
rapidly; at present, he's argu
ably the best rock reviewer in
the country. His writing is
pointed, tough-minded — he's
hardly a consensus seeker. His
favorite artists range from Sly
Stone to The Who.
Marsh's sharpness often is
polarizing, and he seems to re
lish this. His celebrated com
ment that "Bob Dylan is ir
relevant" after the release of
1978's Street-Legal, and his
panning of the Rolling Stones
in a concert review that same

year placed Marsh in the
center of considerable con
troversy.
Not surprisingly, Marsh
sticks by his statements. "Dy
lan is irrelevant. That's not to
dismiss everything he's ever
done — that's just to say, right
now, Bob Dylan doesn't have
anything to do with what's
going on. He's not in tune with
anything except for his own
solipsistic mind.
"I mean, Kris Kristofferson
wrote ')esus was a carpenter
and now Bob Dylan can write
'lesus was a solipsist' and he
will have really performed his
function.
As for the Stones, Marsh said
that they should have been
"forcibly retired" five years
ago. Their last album, Some
Girls was "a fairly lousy album
— for the Stones," according
to Marsh. "If somebody else
had their name on that record
— say, Sandburg and Weisman
nobody would have gotten
worked up over that music.
Marsh also is critical of Rol
ling Stone magazine. He has
never really liked the magazine
and said that it's "gotten
worse," largely because editor
lann Wenner is less involved in
the magazine than he has been
in the past. "The other prob
lem at Rolling Stone is that
their editors mostly don't like
music."
Marsh was especially upset
at the recent Rolling Stone
cover story about the tragedy
at The Who concert in Cincin
nati. Marsh called the cover
picture of the 11 victims
"exploitative and disgusting."
But most of the conversation
centered on Springsteen and
Marsh's book. Marsh said that
the book is an "unauthorized"
biography because "I wanted
to make clear that what I was
saying was what I was saying,
not what Bruce would have
said. There were things in the


Dave Marsh
hook winch I didn't think
Bruce wanted to endorse
about other performers
mostly." In the book, Marsh is
typically uncompromising in
his negative view ot people like
Linda Ronstadt. Springsteen is
the same.
He admits that he doesn't
hide his "messianic regard" lor
Springsteen in the book.
that's pretty well unhideable.
Besides I wrote this book for
people who already liked
Springsteen. If the fans are
happy, then I'm happy."
Springsteen 'likes the
book, I think,'' said Marsh. "At
least he said he did. Bruce had
a really tunny reaction to mak
ing the trade best-seller list. He
went out and bought The New
York Times for one ot the lew
times in Ins lite because he
didn't believe me."
Marsh wasn't sure why
Springsteen got involved in the

recent MUSf (Musicians Un
ited lor Safe Energy) anti
nuclear concerts and album,
but he guessed that il was be
( ause "three Mile Island upset
him a lot." Marsh pointed out
that Springsteen's silence on
Ins motives meant "that Bruce
is too smart to say anything."
Springsteen's live shows are
olten bootlegged, and he re
cently initiated action to sue
various groups responsible lor
the recordings. Marsh de
tended Springsteen's a< tion,
saying thai "bootlegging is
morally wrong, because it's
stealing a guy s labor. Also,
bootleggers don't seem to
realize how bootlegging slows
down the recording process.
"Everybody bitches about
why Bruce doesn't put out par
ticular songs, Marsh con
tinued. "The bootlegs are part
ot the reason. People listen to
