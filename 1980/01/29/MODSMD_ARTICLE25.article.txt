# Rock critic on the run
## 
### 
The fact that rock criticism is
largely populated by hacks,
who plainly just don't know or
care about the music, causes
many fans — justifiably — to
not pay any attention to it.
As its many flops indicate,
rock criticism is a high-wire af
fair. The record audience, in
dustry and performer all lend
to be mercurial in their
"tastes"; the shifts come with
out warning and, sometimes,
they're unfathomable. It's a sea
of rhetorical excess that you've
got to struggle through, and
it's all a critic can do to keep
some degree of consistency;
indeed, a remarkable number
of critics throw in the towel
well before such a battle is
even joined.
So, where compromise
often is equated with survival,
Dave Marsh keeps up the fight.
Marsh, who is most widely
known for his criticism for Rol
ling Stone, recently published
a book, Born to Run: The Bruce
Springsteen Story.
Marsh, 29, went to work at
and later became editor of
Creem at 19. This move fol
lowed an abortive stint at
Wayne State University. After
leaving Creem in 1973, he took
jobs at Newsday and Boston's
Real Paper. In 1975, Marsh
went to work at Rolling Stone.
He quit his editorial duties at
the magazine in 1978 in order
to devote himself to writing.
As a critic, Marsh is maturing
rapidly; at present, he's argu
ably the best rock reviewer in
the country. His writing is
pointed, tough-minded — he's
hardly a consensus seeker. His
favorite artists range from Sly
Stone to The Who.
Marsh's sharpness often is
polarizing, and he seems to re
lish this. His celebrated com
ment that "Bob Dylan is ir
relevant" after the release of
1978's Street-Legal, and his
panning of the Rolling Stones
in a concert review that same

year placed Marsh in the
center of considerable con
troversy.
Not surprisingly, Marsh
sticks by his statements. "Dy
lan is irrelevant. That's not to
dismiss everything he's ever
done — that's just to say, right
now, Bob Dylan doesn't have
anything to do with what's
going on. He's not in tune with
anything except for his own
solipsistic mind.
"I mean, Kris Kristofferson
wrote ')esus was a carpenter
and now Bob Dylan can write
'lesus was a solipsist' and he
will have really performed his
function.
As for the Stones, Marsh said
that they should have been
"forcibly retired" five years
ago. Their last album, Some
Girls was "a fairly lousy album
— for the Stones," according
to Marsh. "If somebody else
had their name on that record
— say, Sandburg and Weisman
nobody would have gotten
worked up over that music.
Marsh also is critical of Rol
ling Stone magazine. He has
never really liked the magazine
and said that it's "gotten
worse," largely because editor
lann Wenner is less involved in
the magazine than he has been
in the past. "The other prob
lem at Rolling Stone is that
their editors mostly don't like
music."
Marsh was especially upset
at the recent Rolling Stone
cover story about the tragedy
at The Who concert in Cincin
nati. Marsh called the cover
picture of the 11 victims
"exploitative and disgusting."
But most of the conversation
centered on Springsteen and
Marsh's book. Marsh said that
the book is an "unauthorized"
biography because "I wanted
to make clear that what I was
saying was what I was saying,
not what Bruce would have
said. There were things in the
