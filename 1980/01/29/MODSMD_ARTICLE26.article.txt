# Holmes and Watson live again in ACT's Crucifer
## 
### 
When Peter Donat as Sher
lock Holmes first comes on
stage in A.C.T's Crucifer ot
Blood, he heads straight tor the
cocaine he has hidden inside a
book. To Dr. Watson's (Daniel
Davis) objections, Holmes re
sponds that his mind is only
sharpened by the drug. For
proof, he reads the entire life
history of Watson's brother off
the various marks on a pocket
watch.
This, I suppose, as well as
anything prepares us for Paul
Giovanni's rendition of Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle's fantasy
world of Victorian London and
its master detective, Sherlock
Holmes. When the play ended,
I felt as if I had just closed the
cover of one of Doyle's books,
which is just the effect the
show is supposed to present.
The play opens, with proper
mystery, late at night at an out
post in the sprawling fort at
Arga India on the eve of the
Great Mutiny of 1857. Two
British officers, foolish and ar
rogant, stumble upon a
maharaja's treasure as two na
tives try to sneak it into the fort.
Overcome by greed they kill
the Indians and make a sacred
pact of blood between them
selves and a British private to

smuggle the fortune back to
England and divvy it up.
The bulk of the play takes
place 30 years later in and
around London. A distressed
Irene St. Claire (Susan Pelleg
rino), the daughter of a retired
army officer, comes to Holmes
with a mysterious piece of
paper she believes is part of a
threat to her father's life.
Holmes must track down the
secret curse written in blood
on the tattered piece of Indian
parchment.
The personalities in the play,
while not particularly deep, are
certainly interesting English
eccentrics. Major Ross, Ret.
(William McKereghan) is a fat
old man, crippled because he
has had no need to walk since
he brought home his beloved
treasure. William Paterson is
Captain St. Claire, Ret., Irene's
lather, and an opium addict try
ing to lorget a past over which
he has incredible guilt.
Opposed to Holmes' con
stant stream ot brilliant deduc
tions is Inspector lestrade
(Gerald Lancaster) ot Scotland
Yard, whose overwhelming
ability to overlook every scrap
ot evidence serves to highlight
Holmes' legendary skill.
The only player who seemed

to have difficulty presenting a
completely convincing charac
ter was Pellegrino as Irene,
though the fault was not en
tirely hers. She was saddled
with a slew of pompous lies of
the type that well-fit the scho
larly Holmes but were ill-suited
a young and frightened girl.
No murder mystery should
be without a good, disorient
ing dream scene, and Crucifer
is no exception. In what is one

of the best scenes ot the play,
St. Claire passes out in an
opium den near the foggy
banks ot the Thames and as
bodies and mist tloat across a
dimly lighted stage, we dis
cover the stange turn of events
and the awful betrayal perpet
rated by Ross and St. Claire in
India years before.
Those on stage, ot course,
are not privy to St. Claire's sec
rets and must wait until the end

when Holmes, true to form,un
ravels the mystery. Well, al
most unravels it. For there is a
linal twist to the old maharaja's
curse that will keep you gues
sing until the great detective
pulls one last trick.
