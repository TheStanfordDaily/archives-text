# Elizabeth I was not a royal show
## 
### 
in this production anything
is possible/' exclaimed an ac
tress during I he Acting Com
pany's production ot Paul Fos
ter's historical potpourri
I.
Many people expected a
serious historical piece on the
lite and long reifn of
"Gloriana." Instead they were
treated to a long series of skits
and spools on the intrigues of
the various courts of Europe in
a tree style reminiscent otFel
lini.
What virtue there is in the
play is thanks to the innovative
production and I iviu Ciulei's
direction. The actors work
wonders on the hare stage,
there is dance, song and mime
which your keeps interest in
spurts. There is a historical
thread that tried to hold the
play together as it lollows
Elizabeth's long lite but that is a
little artificial. Foster concen
trates on the great events of
Clloriana's reign, the behead
ing ol Mary and the defeat of
the Armada.
112 osier s play is a play within a
play, (it seems in fat t that it is a
play which tries to incorporate
ev ervbit ol tec hnique tried and
theorized over the age). It tells
the story ol a young company
ol actors eager to please the
great queen. So, the queen is
really not Hie queen but an ac

tress playing the queen in the
play within the play (I hope you
still follow.)
Elizabeth ( Ihe Player Queen i
gives us the inner workings,
the inner emotions ot the real
Elizabeth. We see her acting
out her uncertainty and vacil
lation over the execution ol
Mary, Queen of Scots, and the
dangerous new path lor Eng
land that she chooses. She
makes a long sp ech about her
love ol peace and we all hope
that this will be developed la
ter, but this is not a serious
play. All the serious questions
are left hanging in the air.
There is no message although
we are given every reason to
expect one. lust as we think
that some point is being made
about Elizabeth's marital dif
ficulties and the difficulties ol
ruling a male dominated soci
ety which may scintillate our
appetites lor some comment
on woman's role in socieU
Elizabeth breaks out into lock
and roll.
Why pick on Elizabeth? II is
hard to understand what the
historical context has to do
with the play's essence which
is to provide entertainment
Lisa Banes who plays
Elizabeth (The Playet Queen
plays with a great deal ot
spunk. She is much more
beautitul than the real

Elizabeth ever was and never
pretends to have any ol the
aristocratic composure that
one imagines Elizabeth had.
Banes plays in a play written by
an American about Americans,
not about the Elizabethan age.
While there is some serious
ness to Elizabeth, the portrayal
ot Philip li s court in the Esco
ria.l is farcial. Catherine de
Medici ot France is portrayed
as "da dimwit," mouthing the
words ot the prophet Nos
tradamus, who is dressed as a
clown.
Saint Bartholomew's day
Massacre sends chills down
your spine as the actors throw
dolls down the steps ot the
stage to symbolize the mas
sacre ol innocent Huguenots
but it is hard to understand the
connection between
Catherine, the idiot on the
I rench throne, and such a cold
blooded act. An equally dumb
Pope Pius could not be blamed
tor anything either.
The Spanish Armada is rep
resented by paper boats tloat
ing in a shallow tub ol water
and are put to the torch to
symbolize its destruction.
!l is difficult to understand
why I osier received a Tony
nomination lor this play and
why the Acting Company
chose to perform it.
Liviu Ciulei, the director and

designer lor the play, who i< an
acclaimed director both in his
native Romania and New York
has gone along with the play's
lack ol ditec tion and dissipated
energv thai charaterized some
ol the innovation ol the sixties.
Mill, thanks to him die audi
ence was entertained, there
was an occasional laugh or two
although most sounds are
deadened by the vastness ol
Mem Aud.
There was one distinctive
sound, however, lhat con
tinued to impinge on my ears
that ol a man behind me
snoring.
from reliable sources this
was by tar the better ot the two
performances thai The Acting
Company have performed dur
ing then passing visit here,
the other was a comedy,
Broadway.
The Acting Company is a
company ol young acu.. .nut
actresses selected from lead
ing professional theatei ain
ing programs. It ha . com
mitment to the development ol
skilled actors and toward 112»• -
inging classical as wen as con
temporary plays to theaters
throughout the country.
Their production ol
Elizabeth I premiered in Oc
tober at the lohn I . Kennedy
Center in Washington D.C.
