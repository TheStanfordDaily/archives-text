Washington — President Jimmy
Carter sent Congress today a no
growth $615.8 billion budget for fis
cal 1981, designed to portray him as
tough on inflation-fighting and de
fense while providing some modest
increases in a few popular social
programs.
Despite predictions of a recession,
the election-year spending plan
would allow spending to rise by what
is needed to keep pace with infla
tion.
Carter once again would constrain
federal pay increases — this time to
6.2 percent for civilian workers and
7.4 percent for military personnel.
Last year he proposed a 5.5 percent
federal pay hike, which he later
raised to 7 percent.
The $615.8 billion spending figure
marks a rise of $52.2 billion, or 9.3
percent, from the current year's out
lays, which now are estimated at
$563.6 billion — a figure that itself is
$16 billion higher than projected ear
lier.
$15.8 billion deficit
The deficit would be $15.8 billion
— the lowest red-ink figure since
1974 — down from a revised $39.8
billion now estimated for the current
year. Fiscal 1981 begins next October
1 and runs through the following
September 30.
Of the $52.2 billion spending rise,
$15.3 billion would go to defense and
$37 billion to automatic increases in
entitlement programs —$19.5 billion
to Social Security, $5 billion for Med
icare and $3.9 billion for welfare
payments.
With an eye toward the coming
presidential election campaign, the
budget provides for visible, though
still relatively modest increases in
politically sensitive programs for the
poor — housing, education and
medical care.
Some small cuts
Carter also is proposing some
small cuts — in programs such as im
pact aid to public schools, school
lunch subsidies and some higher
education grants. And he's seeking
added savings from proposals to
streamline other programs.

As the president disclosed earlier,
he is forgoing any proposal for a tax
cut, primarily as an anti-inflation
move. Whiu House policymakers
argued that to cut taxes now would
only heighten inflation fears.
The decision not to cut taxes
would swell federal tax receipts to
21.7 percent of the gross national
product — up from 18.5 percent in
1976 — pushing Americans' tax bur
dens to their highest level since the
peak of World War 11.
Reaction
Reaction to Carter's budget prop
osals was predictably along partisan
lines. Democratic congressional
leaders praised the plan as workable,
while Republicans criticized the
White House for failing to call for a
tax cut.
The budget includes these high
lights:
— Carter essentially abandoned
last year's effort to cut big Democra
tic social programs such as food
stamps, public jobs, Social Security
benefits and welfare payments. In
stead, these would be allowed to rise
in line with inflation.
— The White House is proposing
modest, but nevertheless highly vis
ible increases in research and de
velopment grants and in key prog
rams that aid the poor — particularly
housing, education and medical
care.
— Defense spending would soar
by $15.3 billion, primarily in re
sponse to the Middle East
emergency. Military outlays would
climb to $142.7 billion — 3.3
percentage-points faster than infla
tion — with bigger increases in fu
ture years.
— Budget cuts this time would be
concentrated on politically less
important domestic programs that
are not linked to vocal constituent
groups. Domestic spending overall
would lag $6 8 billion or 1
percentage-point behind inflation.
— The budget contains only one
new initiative — a widely touted
youth unemployment program de
signed to develop back-to-school
programs that coordinate remedial
