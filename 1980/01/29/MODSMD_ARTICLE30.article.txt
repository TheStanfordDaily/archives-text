# Pink Floyd's Wall is less than par
## 
### 
The W.ill
Pink Floyd
Columbia
Throughout the Seventies,
Pink I loyd was regarded by
many as the space cadet's
hand, the perfect group to lis
ten to il you wanted to till your
head with chemicals, forget
life's problems, and escape to
the dark side of the moon. The
ironic thing is that the whole
time the band was making this
particular spai ey, escapist kind
ol music, it was also mak
ing very strong political, social
and economic statements. On
albums such as Wish You Were
Here, Animals, and D.irA Side
ol the Moon, the band's musi
cal wizardry was otten so
impressive that most were
satisfied just to listen without
thinking about what they were
listening to.
On its new two-record set,
I he Wall, Pink I loyd once
igain provides the listener with
nany strong statements about
'■e present condition ol lite.
On this album, however, there

might well be a tew more
people thinking, not necessar
ily because the statements are
that much stronger, but rather
because the music is not quite
ol the intensity that forces
one to torget about the words.
There are indeed moments
on the album when David Gil -
mour's guitar work sends one
into a synthesized tren/y, or
when the various background
noises might make those in
drug-induced states appreciate
their trips a little more, but
these moments are lewer than
one comes to expect trom a
Pink I loyd album.
The W t ill is not an album
about escaping, but rather
about the impossibility ot es
cape in a world where people's
demands are so high that they
can never be satisfied. The al
bum, like every other Pink
Moyd album in the Seventies,
has a great deal to say about the
alienated individual. Ihesame
kind ot cynicism which
brought about such a biting
line as "the band is just tantas

tic, that is really what I think,
oli by the way, which one is
Pink?", on Wish You Were
Here, manifests itself on The
W.ill as well: "The child is
grown, the dream is gone, and
I have become comfortably
numb.
The individual has traded his
heroes lor ghosts, and wound
up "just another brick in the
wall."
All ot the lyrics were written
by bassist Roger Waters. Wat
ers also contributes to the voc
als a great deal more than on
other of the band's albums,
leaving The Wall with a more
realistic sound than it David
("iilniour had sung must ot the
songs (Cilmour's voice can
make any song sound as
though it were written in a dif
ferent galaxy).
Many ol Waters' lyrics are
lull ot insight and even at
times poetic, but he neverthe
less tails in getting
his point across effectively;
alter listening to the album
many times, I lound mysell

wondering it being a rock star
is really as hard as Waters
makes it out to be, and ii life in
general has really reached the
contused state which the
album portrays.
The Wall starts ott with the
song "In the Flesh" as though it
were going to be another Pink
Floyd classic. By the time one
gets to listening to the tourth
side, however, it seems as it
the music is just there to ac
company Waters' plot; the
sound effects are overdone
and even at times trite, and one
teels as it he or she is listening
to a story rather than music.
Nevertheless The Wall is a
concept album and like Yes'
Tales from Topographic
Oceans requires a lot of listen
ing it it is going to be ap
preciated to the tullest.
A lot ot negative comments
about this album may spring
trom the tact that tor a while
back in the Seventies, it looked
as though Pink Floyd were
never going to make a less
than-pertect album, and so
tinding flaws with an album
like The Wall is rather like
watching the Pittsburgh Steel
ers lose.
