But director Andy Cohn's
production telegraphs its in

Cotton's Hedda
I he c ast works around these
problems, some with more
sue i ess and grace. Sally Cotton
plays a Irazzled but winning
Hedda, much livelier than the
usual daik, constricted one

epi tomi/ed by Glenda lackson.
Cotton adds a tlightiness like
that of Nora in A Doll's House.
She'satraid tolive, lest herank
les ilegs, in this version) show;
but instead of swallowing each
anxiety in pre-suicidal silence,
she giggles n oft like a spoiled
kid. This makes her death more
ot a puzzle than it should be.
Leon Forbes' judge Brack
also wears a lighter-than-usual
characterization. He's been
made into the most likeable fel
low in the play — we really
can't believe he wants to
blackmail Hedda into an attair.
'Auntie |u-|u'
Koss Holcomb and laura
Met laity stand out as Loev
borg and Ihea. Richard Titus,
as Hedda's husband, comes off
as a babyish bumpkin, espe
cially when he calls tor his
"Auntie |u-|u" (usually known
as Aunt lulia).
Michael Meyer's new trans
lation is at lault here. Several
other dialogue changes don't
seem to work and these, added
to the problems elsewhere, are
costly to such an economical
play.
