Senate urges snub of Olympics
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted 14-0 yesterday to urge American
athletes and sports tans to snub the 1980 Olympics
in Moscow it the International Olympics Commit
tee allows the Games to proceed.
The panel called on the international committee
to agree to the request made by the United States
Olympic Committee on Saturday that the games
be canceled or transferred if Soviet troops remain
in Atghanistan beyond the Feb. 20 deadline set by
President Jimmy Carter.
The Senate committee also urged that the inter
national committee "give urgent consideration to
the creation of permanent homes for the Summer
and Winter Olympic Games, including one in
Greece, the country of their origin." That move
came after a plea tor a permanent Olympic site in
Greece from Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who com
peted in the 1964 Olympics and was a professional
basketball star.
Debate on the resolution began almost im
mediately on the Senate floor, but a vote was not
expected until today at the earliest.
Chairman Frank Church (D-ldaho) said the
committee's primary concern was that the Soviets
would use the Olympics to put "the stamp of ap
proval on the invasion of Afghanistan and the
stamp of indifference on the world's reaction to
that brutal and dangerous act of aggression."
Church said that unlike the House version, pas
sed last week by a 386-12 vote, the Senate resolu
tion does not propose that other Games be set up
as an alternative to the Moscow Olympics.
Vance offers to work with Bani-Sadr
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
offered yesterday to work with the newly elected
president in Iran to end the crisis over American
hostages and tace "the grave situation" caused by
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
But he said in an Associated Press interview he
could not predict the effect of the election of
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr on the situation at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, which was seized by militants
Nov. 4.
"We hope that Iran will decide to end the crisis
so that it can begin to address the serious threats
and problems Iran faces," Vance said.
These, he added, are not only domestic "but
from outside their borders as a result of actions
which the Soviets have taken in invading Afghanis
tan."
Vance reaffirmed U.S. support for the indepen
dence of Iran and all other countries in the region,
including Afghanistan.
Bani-Sadr, elected with some 75 percent of the
vote, was acting foreign minister after the seizure
of the U.S. Embassy and the capture of American
hostages there. He was replaced as foreign minis
ter atter trying to arrange negotiations to settle the
dispute.
With U.S. efforts to gain release of the hostages
at a standstill, clearly the Carter administration
hopes Bani-Sadr's election may lead to a settle
ment.
Kennedy condemns conscription
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy, seeking to
rejuvenate his presidential campaign, blamed
('resident |immy Carter for the Iranian crisis yes
terday and said restoring draft registration is a
"step across the threshhold of Cold War II."
In his own state of the union message, Kennedy
also called lor a six-month wage and price freeze
and immediate gasoline rationing.
And the Massachusetts Democrat, whose loss to
Carter in the lowa precinct caucuses last week

prompted speculation about the 112 uture of his can
didacy, declared he was in the race to stay.
There was no immediate response from the
White House, but Carter has opposed mandatory
wage-price controls.
Kennedy's gasoline rationing plan follows the
lines of the president's standby proposal which
Congress approved last year. Kennedy supported
the standby rationing plan.
But this was the first time he has advocated
mandatory wage and price controls. "The volun
tary guidelines have run their course and failed,"
he said.
Kennedy delivered his speech before an audi
ence of Georgetown University students one
week after he lost to Carter in lowa by a 2-1 margin.
That was the first test before voters in the battle for
Democratic National Convention delegates.
Carter's new policy criticized
Washington — House and Senate Republican
leaders criticized President )immy Carter's Persian
Gulf manifesto last night, saying that the United
States lacked the military means to enforce it and
that nations in the region first should have
pledged their own defense against Soviet attack.
"I think Republicans are going to want to take a
good, long look at this," said Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska, the acting Senate Republican leader, in an
ABC-TV interview that comprised part of a GOP
response to Carter's State of the Union speech last
week.
Appearing with Stevens was the House Republi
can leader, )ohn Rhodes of Arizona. Both accused
Carter of failing to consult adequately with Con
gress, U.S. allies and Middle East governments in
developing his new Persian Gulf policy.
Carter's policy commits the United States to use
military force, if necessary, to repel "an attempt by
any outside force to gain control of the Persian
Gulf region."
Stevens said that Carter has "committed us ap
parently to a conventional defense of the Persian
Gulf region when we don't have conventional
capability now to do that."
Syrian troops approach Israel
Jerusalem — Syria moved troops yesterday to an
area about 21 miles north of the Israel border.
According to sources in Beirut, Israel in response
sent armored units into areas of southern Lebanon
controlled by its Christian-rightist allies.
Israeli military sources would neither confirm
nor deny the Beirut reports.
Maj. Saad Haddad, leader of the Israeli
supported "Free Lebanon" forces north of the Is
raeli border, said that the Syrians had advanced to
within "three to six miles of our lines." Haddad's
enclave averages six miles in width. Troops of the
U.N. peacekeeping force are deployed between
Haddad's area and the Syrian units.
But othersources here indicated the Syrians had
shifted an armored brigade of several thousand
men trom Lebanese coastal areas near Sidon and
Damur to an area near Lake Qeraun, which is due
north of the Israeli border town of Metulla.
S. Arabia hikes price of crude oil
New York — Saudi Arabia, the largest member of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries and the supplier of about 7.4 percent of U.S.
oil needs, told customers yesterday it has in
creased its base crude oil price by $2 to $26, Exxon
Corp. announced.
The 8.3 percent increase in the price of Arabian
light crude, the traditional benchmark on which
other OPEC prices are based, was retroactive to
)an. 1 and has been expected by many analysts.

The move lifted the average price of a 42-gallon
barrel of OPEC oil to about $28 trom $26.83. A year
ago, OPEC oil sold for an average of $13.50.
The December announcement touched off a
wave of increases by other OPEC members that
raised the U.S. price of a gallon of gasoline or
heating oil by 14 cents or more in recent weeks.
Yesterday's increase could add up to a penny more
to fuel prices here.
Pakistan awaits U.S. diplomats
Washington — The United States is sending a
high-level diplomatic and military mission to
Pakistan later this week to demonstrate support
for that endangered country and to work out de
tails of a proposed $400 million U.S. aid program,
according to informed sources.
The mission, to be headed by presidential Na
tional Security Adviser /bigniew Brzezinski and
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is
scheduled to leave for Islamabad Thursday. The
high officials may also visit Saudi Arabia before
returning to Washington early next week.
A military delegation headed by Assistant Sec
retary of Defense David McGiffert also will go to
Pakistan late this week and is likely to remain there
for technical discussions after the senior political
officials depart, according to the sources.
Pakistan's president, Cen. Mohammed /ia Ul-
Haq, has been bluntly critical of the U.S. aid offer,
which was tendered to the top Pakistani foreign
affairs official, Agha Shahi, in Washington Jan. 12.
War objectors group revitalized
Philadelphia — The Central Committee for Con
cientious Objectors has announced revival of its
nationwide draft counseling network.
"The U.S. has never had a draft registration
without a draft, and we have rarely had a draft
without a war," said Jon Landau, staff attorney for
the committee, which has been providing infor
mation on the draft since 1948.
The committee, headquartered in Philadelphia,
with an office in San Francisco, said in a news
release that it plans to take immediate steps to
inform young Americans of draft alternatives.
"The first step will be to fight the return of re
gistration by letting Congress know of the millions
of young Americans who object to dying for the
Persian Gulf," the committee said.
The group said it has recorded more than 2600
men and women as concientious objectors in the
past three months. It said it will be training people
to go around the country to counsel potential draf
tees and give them an opportunity to list them
selves as war objectors.

Vance reaffirmed U.S. support for the indepen
dence of Iran and all other countries in the region,
including Afghanistan.
Bani-Sadr, elected with some 75 percent of the
vote, was acting foreign minister after the seizure
of the U.S. Embassy and the capture of American
hostages there. He was replaced as foreign minis
ter atter trying to arrange negotiations to settle the
dispute.
With U.S. efforts to gain release of the hostages
at a standstill, clearly the Carter administration
hopes Bani-Sadr's election may lead to a settle

Kennedy condemns conscription
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy, seeking to
rejuvenate his presidential campaign, blamed
('resident |immy Carter for the Iranian crisis yes
terday and said restoring draft registration is a
"step across the threshhold of Cold War II."
In his own state of the union message, Kennedy
also called lor a six-month wage and price freeze
and immediate gasoline rationing.
And the Massachusetts Democrat, whose loss to
Carter in the lowa precinct caucuses last week

prompted speculation about the 112 uture of his can
didacy, declared he was in the race to stay.
There was no immediate response from the
White House, but Carter has opposed mandatory
wage-price controls.
Kennedy's gasoline rationing plan follows the
lines of the president's standby proposal which
Congress approved last year. Kennedy supported
the standby rationing plan.
But this was the first time he has advocated
mandatory wage and price controls. "The volun
tary guidelines have run their course and failed,"
he said.
Kennedy delivered his speech before an audi
ence of Georgetown University students one
week after he lost to Carter in lowa by a 2-1 margin.
That was the first test before voters in the battle for
Democratic National Convention delegates.
Carter's new policy criticized
Washington — House and Senate Republican
leaders criticized President )immy Carter's Persian
Gulf manifesto last night, saying that the United
States lacked the military means to enforce it and
that nations in the region first should have
pledged their own defense against Soviet attack.
"I think Republicans are going to want to take a
good, long look at this," said Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska, the acting Senate Republican leader, in an
ABC-TV interview that comprised part of a GOP
response to Carter's State of the Union speech last
week.
Appearing with Stevens was the House Republi
can leader, )ohn Rhodes of Arizona. Both accused
Carter of failing to consult adequately with Con
gress, U.S. allies and Middle East governments in
developing his new Persian Gulf policy.
Carter's policy commits the United States to use
military force, if necessary, to repel "an attempt by
any outside force to gain control of the Persian
Gulf region."
Stevens said that Carter has "committed us ap
parently to a conventional defense of the Persian
Gulf region when we don't have conventional
capability now to do that."
Syrian troops approach Israel
Jerusalem — Syria moved troops yesterday to an
area about 21 miles north of the Israel border.
According to sources in Beirut, Israel in response
sent armored units into areas of southern Lebanon
controlled by its Christian-rightist allies.
Israeli military sources would neither confirm
nor deny the Beirut reports.
Maj. Saad Haddad, leader of the Israeli
supported "Free Lebanon" forces north of the Is
raeli border, said that the Syrians had advanced to
within "three to six miles of our lines." Haddad's
enclave averages six miles in width. Troops of the
U.N. peacekeeping force are deployed between
Haddad's area and the Syrian units.
But othersources here indicated the Syrians had
shifted an armored brigade of several thousand
men trom Lebanese coastal areas near Sidon and
Damur to an area near Lake Qeraun, which is due
north of the Israeli border town of Metulla.
S. Arabia hikes price of crude oil
New York — Saudi Arabia, the largest member of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries and the supplier of about 7.4 percent of U.S.
oil needs, told customers yesterday it has in
creased its base crude oil price by $2 to $26, Exxon
Corp. announced.
The 8.3 percent increase in the price of Arabian
light crude, the traditional benchmark on which
other OPEC prices are based, was retroactive to
)an. 1 and has been expected by many analysts.

The move lifted the average price of a 42-gallon
barrel of OPEC oil to about $28 trom $26.83. A year
ago, OPEC oil sold for an average of $13.50.
The December announcement touched off a
wave of increases by other OPEC members that
raised the U.S. price of a gallon of gasoline or
heating oil by 14 cents or more in recent weeks.
Yesterday's increase could add up to a penny more
to fuel prices here.
Pakistan awaits U.S. diplomats
Washington — The United States is sending a
high-level diplomatic and military mission to
Pakistan later this week to demonstrate support
for that endangered country and to work out de
tails of a proposed $400 million U.S. aid program,
according to informed sources.
The mission, to be headed by presidential Na
tional Security Adviser /bigniew Brzezinski and
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is
scheduled to leave for Islamabad Thursday. The
high officials may also visit Saudi Arabia before
returning to Washington early next week.
A military delegation headed by Assistant Sec
retary of Defense David McGiffert also will go to
Pakistan late this week and is likely to remain there
for technical discussions after the senior political
officials depart, according to the sources.
Pakistan's president, Cen. Mohammed /ia Ul-
Haq, has been bluntly critical of the U.S. aid offer,
which was tendered to the top Pakistani foreign
affairs official, Agha Shahi, in Washington Jan. 12.
War objectors group revitalized
Philadelphia — The Central Committee for Con
cientious Objectors has announced revival of its
nationwide draft counseling network.
"The U.S. has never had a draft registration
without a draft, and we have rarely had a draft
without a war," said Jon Landau, staff attorney for
the committee, which has been providing infor
mation on the draft since 1948.
The committee, headquartered in Philadelphia,
with an office in San Francisco, said in a news
release that it plans to take immediate steps to
inform young Americans of draft alternatives.
"The first step will be to fight the return of re
gistration by letting Congress know of the millions
of young Americans who object to dying for the
Persian Gulf," the committee said.
The group said it has recorded more than 2600
men and women as concientious objectors in the
past three months. It said it will be training people
to go around the country to counsel potential draf
tees and give them an opportunity to list them
selves as war objectors.
Dow Jones loses at 878.50
New York — Oil, defense and corn-processing
stocks rang up some of the best gains as the stock
market extended its early-1980 rally in another
busy session yesterday.
The laggard Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which is still more than 170 points below its 1973
peak of 1051.70, gained 2.39 to 878.50 in yester
day's trading.
Yesterday's volume on the Big Board totaled
.62 million shares, up from 47.10 million Friday,
as trading maintained the record-breaking pace of
the past three weeks.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through Wednesday with lows in the

Senate urges snub of Olympics
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted 14-0 yesterday to urge American
athletes and sports tans to snub the 1980 Olympics
in Moscow it the International Olympics Commit
tee allows the Games to proceed.
The panel called on the international committee
to agree to the request made by the United States
Olympic Committee on Saturday that the games
be canceled or transferred if Soviet troops remain
in Atghanistan beyond the Feb. 20 deadline set by
President Jimmy Carter.
The Senate committee also urged that the inter
national committee "give urgent consideration to
the creation of permanent homes for the Summer
and Winter Olympic Games, including one in
Greece, the country of their origin." That move
came after a plea tor a permanent Olympic site in
Greece from Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who com
peted in the 1964 Olympics and was a professional
basketball star.
Debate on the resolution began almost im
mediately on the Senate floor, but a vote was not
expected until today at the earliest.
Chairman Frank Church (D-ldaho) said the
committee's primary concern was that the Soviets
would use the Olympics to put "the stamp of ap
proval on the invasion of Afghanistan and the
stamp of indifference on the world's reaction to
that brutal and dangerous act of aggression."
Church said that unlike the House version, pas
sed last week by a 386-12 vote, the Senate resolu
tion does not propose that other Games be set up
as an alternative to the Moscow Olympics.
Vance offers to work with Bani-Sadr
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
offered yesterday to work with the newly elected
president in Iran to end the crisis over American
hostages and tace "the grave situation" caused by
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
But he said in an Associated Press interview he
could not predict the effect of the election of
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr on the situation at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, which was seized by militants
Nov. 4.
"We hope that Iran will decide to end the crisis
so that it can begin to address the serious threats
and problems Iran faces," Vance said.
These, he added, are not only domestic "but
from outside their borders as a result of actions
which the Soviets have taken in invading Afghanis

Appearing with Stevens was the House Republi
can leader, )ohn Rhodes of Arizona. Both accused
Carter of failing to consult adequately with Con
gress, U.S. allies and Middle East governments in
developing his new Persian Gulf policy.
Carter's policy commits the United States to use
military force, if necessary, to repel "an attempt by
any outside force to gain control of the Persian
Gulf region."
Stevens said that Carter has "committed us ap
parently to a conventional defense of the Persian
Gulf region when we don't have conventional
capability now to do that."
Syrian troops approach Israel
Jerusalem — Syria moved troops yesterday to an
area about 21 miles north of the Israel border.
According to sources in Beirut, Israel in response
sent armored units into areas of southern Lebanon
controlled by its Christian-rightist allies.
Israeli military sources would neither confirm
nor deny the Beirut reports.
Maj. Saad Haddad, leader of the Israeli
supported "Free Lebanon" forces north of the Is
raeli border, said that the Syrians had advanced to
within "three to six miles of our lines." Haddad's
enclave averages six miles in width. Troops of the
U.N. peacekeeping force are deployed between
Haddad's area and the Syrian units.
But othersources here indicated the Syrians had
shifted an armored brigade of several thousand
men trom Lebanese coastal areas near Sidon and
Damur to an area near Lake Qeraun, which is due
north of the Israeli border town of Metulla.
S. Arabia hikes price of crude oil
New York — Saudi Arabia, the largest member of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Coun
tries and the supplier of about 7.4 percent of U.S.
oil needs, told customers yesterday it has in
creased its base crude oil price by $2 to $26, Exxon
Corp. announced.
The 8.3 percent increase in the price of Arabian
light crude, the traditional benchmark on which
other OPEC prices are based, was retroactive to
)an. 1 and has been expected by many analysts.

The move lifted the average price of a 42-gallon
barrel of OPEC oil to about $28 trom $26.83. A year
ago, OPEC oil sold for an average of $13.50.
The December announcement touched off a
wave of increases by other OPEC members that
raised the U.S. price of a gallon of gasoline or
heating oil by 14 cents or more in recent weeks.
Yesterday's increase could add up to a penny more
to fuel prices here.
Pakistan awaits U.S. diplomats
Washington — The United States is sending a
high-level diplomatic and military mission to
Pakistan later this week to demonstrate support
for that endangered country and to work out de
tails of a proposed $400 million U.S. aid program,
according to informed sources.
The mission, to be headed by presidential Na
tional Security Adviser /bigniew Brzezinski and
Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher, is
scheduled to leave for Islamabad Thursday. The
high officials may also visit Saudi Arabia before
returning to Washington early next week.
A military delegation headed by Assistant Sec
retary of Defense David McGiffert also will go to
Pakistan late this week and is likely to remain there
for technical discussions after the senior political
officials depart, according to the sources.
Pakistan's president, Cen. Mohammed /ia Ul-
Haq, has been bluntly critical of the U.S. aid offer,
which was tendered to the top Pakistani foreign
affairs official, Agha Shahi, in Washington Jan. 12.
War objectors group revitalized
Philadelphia — The Central Committee for Con
cientious Objectors has announced revival of its
nationwide draft counseling network.
"The U.S. has never had a draft registration
without a draft, and we have rarely had a draft
without a war," said Jon Landau, staff attorney for
the committee, which has been providing infor
mation on the draft since 1948.
The committee, headquartered in Philadelphia,
with an office in San Francisco, said in a news
release that it plans to take immediate steps to
inform young Americans of draft alternatives.
"The first step will be to fight the return of re
gistration by letting Congress know of the millions
of young Americans who object to dying for the
Persian Gulf," the committee said.
The group said it has recorded more than 2600
men and women as concientious objectors in the
past three months. It said it will be training people
to go around the country to counsel potential draf
tees and give them an opportunity to list them
selves as war objectors.
Dow Jones loses at 878.50
New York — Oil, defense and corn-processing
stocks rang up some of the best gains as the stock
market extended its early-1980 rally in another
busy session yesterday.
The laggard Dow Jones average of 30 industrials,
which is still more than 170 points below its 1973
peak of 1051.70, gained 2.39 to 878.50 in yester
day's trading.
Yesterday's volume on the Big Board totaled
.62 million shares, up from 47.10 million Friday,
as trading maintained the record-breaking pace of
the past three weeks.
Today's weather
Mostly fair through Wednesday with lows in the
upper 20s to near 40. Highs in the upper 40s to low
50s. Thursday through Saturday: increasing
clouds with chance of rain northwest. Rainy
periods Thursday through Saturday with snow in
the mountains.
Senate urges snub of Olympics
Washington — The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee voted 14-0 yesterday to urge American
athletes and sports tans to snub the 1980 Olympics
in Moscow it the International Olympics Commit
tee allows the Games to proceed.
The panel called on the international committee
to agree to the request made by the United States
Olympic Committee on Saturday that the games
be canceled or transferred if Soviet troops remain
in Atghanistan beyond the Feb. 20 deadline set by
President Jimmy Carter.
The Senate committee also urged that the inter
national committee "give urgent consideration to
the creation of permanent homes for the Summer
and Winter Olympic Games, including one in
Greece, the country of their origin." That move
came after a plea tor a permanent Olympic site in
Greece from Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.), who com
peted in the 1964 Olympics and was a professional
basketball star.
Debate on the resolution began almost im
mediately on the Senate floor, but a vote was not
expected until today at the earliest.
Chairman Frank Church (D-ldaho) said the
committee's primary concern was that the Soviets
would use the Olympics to put "the stamp of ap
proval on the invasion of Afghanistan and the
stamp of indifference on the world's reaction to
that brutal and dangerous act of aggression."
Church said that unlike the House version, pas
sed last week by a 386-12 vote, the Senate resolu
tion does not propose that other Games be set up
as an alternative to the Moscow Olympics.
Vance offers to work with Bani-Sadr
Washington — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance
offered yesterday to work with the newly elected
president in Iran to end the crisis over American
hostages and tace "the grave situation" caused by
Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
But he said in an Associated Press interview he
could not predict the effect of the election of
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr on the situation at the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran, which was seized by militants
Nov. 4.
"We hope that Iran will decide to end the crisis
so that it can begin to address the serious threats
and problems Iran faces," Vance said.
These, he added, are not only domestic "but
from outside their borders as a result of actions
which the Soviets have taken in invading Afghanis
tan."
Vance reaffirmed U.S. support for the indepen
dence of Iran and all other countries in the region,
including Afghanistan.
Bani-Sadr, elected with some 75 percent of the
vote, was acting foreign minister after the seizure
of the U.S. Embassy and the capture of American
hostages there. He was replaced as foreign minis
ter atter trying to arrange negotiations to settle the
dispute.
With U.S. efforts to gain release of the hostages
at a standstill, clearly the Carter administration
hopes Bani-Sadr's election may lead to a settle
ment.
Kennedy condemns conscription
Washington — Sen. Edward Kennedy, seeking to
rejuvenate his presidential campaign, blamed
('resident |immy Carter for the Iranian crisis yes
terday and said restoring draft registration is a
"step across the threshhold of Cold War II."
In his own state of the union message, Kennedy
also called lor a six-month wage and price freeze
and immediate gasoline rationing.
And the Massachusetts Democrat, whose loss to
Carter in the lowa precinct caucuses last week

prompted speculation about the 112 uture of his can
didacy, declared he was in the race to stay.
There was no immediate response from the
White House, but Carter has opposed mandatory
wage-price controls.
Kennedy's gasoline rationing plan follows the
lines of the president's standby proposal which
Congress approved last year. Kennedy supported
the standby rationing plan.
But this was the first time he has advocated
mandatory wage and price controls. "The volun
tary guidelines have run their course and failed,"
he said.
Kennedy delivered his speech before an audi
ence of Georgetown University students one
week after he lost to Carter in lowa by a 2-1 margin.
That was the first test before voters in the battle for
Democratic National Convention delegates.
Carter's new policy criticized
Washington — House and Senate Republican
leaders criticized President )immy Carter's Persian
Gulf manifesto last night, saying that the United
States lacked the military means to enforce it and
that nations in the region first should have
pledged their own defense against Soviet attack.
"I think Republicans are going to want to take a
good, long look at this," said Sen. Ted Stevens of
Alaska, the acting Senate Republican leader, in an
ABC-TV interview that comprised part of a GOP
response to Carter's State of the Union speech last
week.
Appearing with Stevens was the House Republi
can leader, )ohn Rhodes of Arizona. Both accused
