# Carter pushes record-high military spending

The Washington Post
Washington â€” President Jimmy Carter certified
himself yesterday as a big booster of higher de
tense spending by urging Congress to approve
record high peacetime military budgets over the
next five years.
The same president who came into office three
years ago with high hopes of lowering defense
spending and of improving relations with the
Soviet Union unfurled a banner from the Cold War
to justify his new direction.
"Our forces must be increased if they are to
contain Soviet aggression," said Carter.
In contrast to his 1976 call for reducing defense
spending by $5 billion to $7 billion a year, the
president told Congress that "I am committed as a
matter of fundamental policy to continued real
increases in defense."
Only the beginning
He said his new defense program is only the
start of a sharp climb, declaring he wanted Con
gress to heap $90 billion on top of his new defense
budget in the subsequent four years.
Defense Secretary Harold Brown, at a budget
briefing on Saturday, said that even that may not
be enough. It the Soviets break through the ceil
ings in the Strategic Arms Limitations Treaty
(SALT-II) pending before the Senate, Brown said
the United States would have to follow suit with a
"substantial expansion" of its own strategic
weaponry.
Pentagon comptroller Fred Wacker said at the
same Pentagon budget briefing that there will be
"steady, sustained growth" under the five-year
defense plan even without a step-up in strategic

spending.
Carter's fiscal 1981 budget calls for $158.7 billion
to be made available to the Pentagon to spend. But
above half of that total will go to pay military
people and civilians on the Pentagon payroll
rather than to defense contracts.
The weapons' buying account within that total,
procurement, is $40.5 billion, or about one-fourth
of the fiscal 1981 total. Research and development
is $16.5 billion.
The government expresses the dollar totals for
defense in a number of ways. But all of them in the
new Carter five-year plan point upward.
Further increases
In the White House category called national de
fense, which includes everything from the nuclear
warheads the Energy Department makes for mis
siles to the General Services Administrations
guards at the Pentagon, the Carter budget calls for
zooming from $161.8 billion in fiscal 1981 to $253.2
billion in fiscal 1985, up 56 percent.
Spending in the national defense category
would jump in that same period from $146.2 billion
to $229.7 billion, a hike of 57 percent.
Congress in assessing how much is enough for
defense concentrates on the money requested for
the Pentagon itself to buy weapons, pay soldiers
and operate the military forces all over the world.
These figures do not include contributions from
the Energy Department, CSA and other agencies.
In the Carter budget, money available to the
Pentagon would jump from $139.3 billion in fiscal
1980 to $158.7 billion in fiscal 1981, a 14-percent
boost. The Pentagon figures that the "real" in
crease would be 5.4 percent because of the money

eaten up by inflation. Carter proposes to keep
raising this budget authority category every year
until it hits $248.9 billion in fiscal 1985. This would
represent real increases, according to the Penta
gon, ranging from 4.2 to 4.8 percent.
12 percent increase
Spending, which is lower than the money avail
able for obligations because bills for a weapon are
paid over a number of years rather than all at once,
would climb from $127.4 billion to $142.7 billion
between fiscal 1980 and 1981, a 12 percent rise. The
real increase, the Pentagon computes, would be
3.3 percent in that one-year period.
The annual increases Carter is proposing
beyond fiscal 1981 would push the spending total
to $224.8 billion by 1985. The annual hikes, after
allowing for inflation, would run from 3.3 to 4.4
percent by Pentagon calculations.
As recently as September, Carter and Defense
Secretary Harold Brown were resisting congres
sional demands to increase the defense budget by
the 5 percent now recommended by the presi
dent. Several senators, when notified of Carter's
reversal, said the president was trying to buy votes
for the SALT-II treaty. Carter has since called off his
campaign to get early ratification of the pact.
The president's defense budget was signed off
before the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. But the
higher spending requested is expected to receive
a big assist from that invasion as Congress tries to
express resolve.
Big ticket items within the Carter fiscal 1981
budget include $1.6 billion for the MX nuclear
missile, 17 new ships for the Navy and stepped up
production of the XM-1 tank for the army.
