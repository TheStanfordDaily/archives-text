# Faculty panels organize new requirements
## 
### Jill Liscom 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has begun working
out details of the new distribution
requirements approved by the Fa
culty Senate last week.
Under the new system, to become
effective in September, students
must take one course in each of
seven different areas plus a three
quarter sequence in Western Cul
ture.
At least one of the courses chosen
must focus on a non-Western civili
zation.
The seven areas are:
—Literature and the fine arts;
—Philosophical, social and religi
ous thought;
—Human development, behavior
and language;
—Social processes and institu
tions;
—Mathematical sciences;

—Natural sciences;
—Technology and applied sci
ences.
CUS is nowaccepting nominations
for faculty panels for each of the
seven areas. One member on each
panel will come from an unrelated
academic area.
Beginning Feb. 13, the faculty
panels will evaluate department re
commendations for courses to fulfill
the requirements, according to His
tory Prof. Carolyn Lougee, chairman
of CUS.
The departments are being asked
"to review their offerings and prop
ose new courses if necessary," she
said.
Under the current system, stu
dents must take three courses in
each of three general areas: social
science; humanities; and math, sci
ence and technology.
About 2200 courses now serve to

fulfill one or more of those require
ments, according to Herant Katch
adourian, dean of undergraduate
studies. He said the number of such
classes should be reduced to
"somewhere in the hundreds" next
year.
In the reviewing process, how
ever, the departments will be "work
ing up from zero rather than cutting
down the number" of courses which
meet the requirements, he said.
Lougee said the new requirements
will likely cause several changes in
the departmental course offerings.
For example, "some of the de
partments that are very highly struc
tured may find themselves devoting
more of their courses to general
education," she said. Likewise, more
loosely structured departments may
begin offering more specialized
courses.

Lougee also acknowledged that
the "mick" courses which have be
come popular because they fulfill
distribution requirements may "be
come smaller electives or else disap
pear" if they no longer meet the re
quirements.
"Part of the intention is to certify
only worthwhile and very substan
tive courses," she said.
By making the requirements more
specific, the University "wanted to
make sure that students were diver
sifying their experience" at Stanford
and that students "acquired a sub
stantial acquaintance with the
specified fields," she explained.
After the faculty panels have com
pleted reviewing the proposed
courses, they will make final recom
mendations to CUS. The whole pro
cess should be complete by May,
Lougee said.
