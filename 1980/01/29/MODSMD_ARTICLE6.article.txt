# New hope for scarred patients

Marinated cow hide.
Somehow it just doesn't
seem the sort of thing anyone
in a right state of mind would
patent.
But in 1975, four young re
searchers from the Medical
Center staked their claim on a
sticky, odorless, whitish mate
rial extracted from the hide,
and now, just five years later,
the strange substance has been
termed the silicone of the
1980s.
The extracted material, col
lagen, is one of the body's
most übiquitous substances. It
forms the basic structural
building block of skin, bone,
tendon and cartilage, con
stituting about 30 percent of
the human body's proteins.
Palo Alto-based Collagen
Corporation has devised a
series of processes that trans
form collagen into a sort of
wonder product trade-named
"/yderm." Someday, /yderm
may be injected to rebuild
faces and bodies damaged by
disease or injury. By implant
ing the substance under the
ravaged areas, depressed le
sions can be tilled.
For the time being, however,
/yderm's marketing approval
makes it available to physicians
on a limited basis only, and

Collagen Corp. has placed
even more stringent restric
tions on distribution.
/yderm is currently being
marketed as a method ot treat
ing tissue lost because ot acne,
trauma, aging and other condi
tions. Small amounts of
purified collagen are injected
under the skin and as it warms
to body temperature, the col
lagen condenses to form a
stationary, flesh-like mass.
Eventually, a series of /yderm
implants build up the depre
ssed facial contour from with
in. The injected mass is "col
onized" by blood vessels and
eventually draws natural tissue
to the site that was filled in arti
ficially. A critical reason for
/yderm's success is that the
company's process "slices" off
the telopeptides on both ends of
the collagen molecule. The al
tered molecular structure is
similar to human's; theretore,
neither tissue rejection nor
immune response occurs.
In this respect, /yderm is un
like silicone, a liquid rubber
product that is used strictly to
augment body tissue. Silicone
never joins with the body's
own tissue, a problem that
leads to silicone's worst disad
vantage. Over time, it tends to
move away trom where it was
intended to be. The phenome

non, called "migration," is
what discredited silic one in the
mid-19705, though some plas
tic surgeons are still using
it."/yderm's potential," said
Howard Palefsky, president of
Collagen Corp., "is really in
credible." Someday, it may be
used to repair small blood ves
sels and nerves, help mend
broken bones, or even replace
natural bone. Utilized along
surgical incisions, it could has
ten healing, and injected into
the chest cavity, it could repair
defective heart valves.
How probable are all these
developments?
"It's all very do-able," said
Palefsky, "it's just a matter of
getting it done. But getting it
done is a matter of obtaining
the funding we need to ex
pand."
The current vision ot poten
tial products for Collagen
Corp. has evolved considera
bly since those original exper
iments five years ago. In 1978,
Palo Alto ear specialist Dr.
Rodney Perkins, and his assis
tant, Edward luck, a medical
student, were working with
collagen to develop an artificial
eardrum. The two were ap
proached by Dr. Terry Knapp, a
plastic surgeon at Stanford,
who told them that he and Dr.
)ohn Daniels, an internist.

were at work on an injectable
form of collagen. By merging
their research, the tour were
able to establish Collagen
Corp. with its patent-protected
processes.
At first, the group concen
trated on devising collagen
burn dressings. According to
Palefsky, the burn dressing
market was "noble, but a sure
way to lose money." Two years
ago, the company switched its
emphasis to development of
collagen tor implantation,
which has evolved into the
marketable product
"/yderm."
For :he next two or three
years, /yderm will be used by
physicians in a carefully con
trolled study recording the
material's effect upon acne
scarred patients. The study has
already begun in California,
where Collagen Corp. has ob
tained state approval to market
the material.
So lar, the >tudy has involved
305 patients. People seeking
treatment are required to sign
a series ot consent forms, in
cluding one waiver in which
they give up the right to sue the
company or doctor if they are
dissatisfied. Despite the condi
tions placed on the study, Col
lagen Corp. has had no trouble

"All in all, I've been pleas
antly pleased with /yderm's ef
lect upon facial defects, espe
cially the deeper, wider type
acne scar," said Dr. William
Watson, a dermatologist at the
Medical Center and one ot the
doctors involved in the study.
Reports from the study dis
play a 60 to K0 percent im
provement rate, figures which
have lead Watson to believe
that, "/yderm's potential is
super, but as it now stands, it's
no panacea.
"Realistically speaking,
/yderm is a useful adjunct to
other things available, but it's
not the total answer," he said.

Many patients are attracted
to /yderm as a complement to,
or replacement tor, the pain
lul, costly process of dermab
rasion — the tacial planing
process in which the outer
layers ol skin are literally
sanded off the lace.
"Instead of the pain and ex
tended convalescence ot the
dermabrasion method,
/yderm smooths out scars and
becomes a part ol the living tis
sue it supports," said Watson.
Sometime early next year,
the company will submit an
application to the U.S. Food
and Drug Admimstrtion for
approval to distribute /yderm
experimentally in the rest of
the country. Despite the tact
that its product licensing in

California permits tull
scale marketing, in some
sense, /yderm is still an ex
perimental material.
Following injection, a
/yderm implant shrinks by as
much as 70 percent. That
makes it necessary to repeat
the collagen implantation on
different occasions over a 12-
week period — ranging any
where from two to five injec
tions at each repair site.
After that, the size of the
/yderm mass stays the same
lor at least two years.
"Collagen Corp.'s research
has not tracked a case tor
longer, and it is uncertain it the
effect is completely perma
nent," said Watson.
The question ot whether
/yderm's effect lasts is a seri
ous one lor Collagen Corp. No
one will claim the repair is
completely permanent, be
cause the product simply
hasn't been in use longenough
to guarantee a definitive ans
wer.
"I don't expect to see any
long-term problems develop
ing since collagen is such a be
nign substance to begin with,"
said Paletsky, "But I'll tell you
lor sure in 10 years."
Temporary or perma
nent,Paletsky probably won't
have to worry about it in 10
years. Presuming a dependa
ble cash llow from the acne
product, Collagen Corp. plans
to turn its other product ideas
into realities.
With raw material costs at
about $42 per cow hide, and
considering that it takes only 12
hides to produce about $4 mill
ion worth ot collagen, these
applications could translate
into annual sales estimates at
well over $100 million.

Marinated cow hide.
Somehow it just doesn't
seem the sort of thing anyone
in a right state of mind would
patent.
But in 1975, four young re
searchers from the Medical
Center staked their claim on a
sticky, odorless, whitish mate
rial extracted from the hide,
and now, just five years later,
the strange substance has been
termed the silicone of the
1980s.
The extracted material, col
lagen, is one of the body's
most übiquitous substances. It
forms the basic structural
building block of skin, bone,
tendon and cartilage, con
stituting about 30 percent of
the human body's proteins.
Palo Alto-based Collagen
Corporation has devised a
series of processes that trans
form collagen into a sort of
wonder product trade-named
"/yderm." Someday, /yderm
may be injected to rebuild
faces and bodies damaged by
disease or injury. By implant
ing the substance under the
ravaged areas, depressed le
sions can be tilled.
For the time being, however,
/yderm's marketing approval
makes it available to physicians
on a limited basis only, and

Collagen Corp. has placed
even more stringent restric
tions on distribution.
/yderm is currently being
marketed as a method ot treat
ing tissue lost because ot acne,
trauma, aging and other condi
tions. Small amounts of
purified collagen are injected
under the skin and as it warms
to body temperature, the col
lagen condenses to form a
stationary, flesh-like mass.
Eventually, a series of /yderm
implants build up the depre
ssed facial contour from with
in. The injected mass is "col
onized" by blood vessels and
eventually draws natural tissue
to the site that was filled in arti
ficially. A critical reason for
/yderm's success is that the
company's process "slices" off
the telopeptides on both ends of
the collagen molecule. The al
tered molecular structure is
similar to human's; theretore,
neither tissue rejection nor
immune response occurs.
In this respect, /yderm is un
like silicone, a liquid rubber
product that is used strictly to
augment body tissue. Silicone
never joins with the body's
own tissue, a problem that
leads to silicone's worst disad
vantage. Over time, it tends to
move away trom where it was
intended to be. The phenome

non, called "migration," is
what discredited silic one in the
mid-19705, though some plas
tic surgeons are still using
it."/yderm's potential," said
Howard Palefsky, president of
Collagen Corp., "is really in
credible." Someday, it may be
used to repair small blood ves
sels and nerves, help mend
broken bones, or even replace
natural bone. Utilized along
surgical incisions, it could has
ten healing, and injected into
the chest cavity, it could repair
defective heart valves.
How probable are all these
developments?
"It's all very do-able," said
Palefsky, "it's just a matter of
getting it done. But getting it
done is a matter of obtaining
the funding we need to ex
pand."

were at work on an injectable
form of collagen. By merging
their research, the tour were

At first, the group concen

burn dressings. According to
Palefsky, the burn dressing
market was "noble, but a sure
way to lose money." Two years
ago, the company switched its
emphasis to development of
collagen tor implantation,
which has evolved into the
marketable product
"/yderm."
For :he next two or three
years, /yderm will be used by
physicians in a carefully con

scarred patients. The study has

"Realistically speaking,

Many patients are attracted

layers ol skin are literally

"Instead of the pain and ex

Sometime early next year,

California permits tull
scale marketing, in some

Following injection, a

Marinated cow hide.
Somehow it just doesn't
seem the sort of thing anyone
in a right state of mind would
patent.
But in 1975, four young re
searchers from the Medical
Center staked their claim on a
sticky, odorless, whitish mate
rial extracted from the hide,
and now, just five years later,
the strange substance has been
termed the silicone of the
1980s.
The extracted material, col
lagen, is one of the body's
most übiquitous substances. It
forms the basic structural
building block of skin, bone,
tendon and cartilage, con
stituting about 30 percent of
the human body's proteins.
Palo Alto-based Collagen
Corporation has devised a
series of processes that trans
form collagen into a sort of
wonder product trade-named
"/yderm." Someday, /yderm
may be injected to rebuild
faces and bodies damaged by
disease or injury. By implant
ing the substance under the
ravaged areas, depressed le
sions can be tilled.
For the time being, however,
/yderm's marketing approval
makes it available to physicians
on a limited basis only, and

Collagen Corp. has placed
even more stringent restric
tions on distribution.
/yderm is currently being
marketed as a method ot treat
ing tissue lost because ot acne,
trauma, aging and other condi
tions. Small amounts of
purified collagen are injected
under the skin and as it warms
to body temperature, the col
lagen condenses to form a
stationary, flesh-like mass.
Eventually, a series of /yderm
implants build up the depre
ssed facial contour from with
in. The injected mass is "col
onized" by blood vessels and
eventually draws natural tissue
to the site that was filled in arti
ficially. A critical reason for
/yderm's success is that the
company's process "slices" off
the telopeptides on both ends of
the collagen molecule. The al
tered molecular structure is
similar to human's; theretore,
neither tissue rejection nor
immune response occurs.
In this respect, /yderm is un
like silicone, a liquid rubber
product that is used strictly to
augment body tissue. Silicone
never joins with the body's
own tissue, a problem that
leads to silicone's worst disad
vantage. Over time, it tends to
move away trom where it was
intended to be. The phenome

non, called "migration," is
what discredited silic one in the
mid-19705, though some plas
tic surgeons are still using
it."/yderm's potential," said
Howard Palefsky, president of
Collagen Corp., "is really in
credible." Someday, it may be
used to repair small blood ves
sels and nerves, help mend
broken bones, or even replace
natural bone. Utilized along
surgical incisions, it could has
ten healing, and injected into
the chest cavity, it could repair
defective heart valves.
How probable are all these
developments?
"It's all very do-able," said
Palefsky, "it's just a matter of
getting it done. But getting it
done is a matter of obtaining
the funding we need to ex
pand."
The current vision ot poten
tial products for Collagen
Corp. has evolved considera
bly since those original exper
iments five years ago. In 1978,
Palo Alto ear specialist Dr.
Rodney Perkins, and his assis
tant, Edward luck, a medical
student, were working with
collagen to develop an artificial
eardrum. The two were ap
proached by Dr. Terry Knapp, a
plastic surgeon at Stanford,
who told them that he and Dr.
)ohn Daniels, an internist.

were at work on an injectable
form of collagen. By merging
their research, the tour were
able to establish Collagen
Corp. with its patent-protected
processes.
At first, the group concen
trated on devising collagen
burn dressings. According to
Palefsky, the burn dressing
market was "noble, but a sure
way to lose money." Two years
ago, the company switched its
emphasis to development of
collagen tor implantation,
which has evolved into the
marketable product
"/yderm."
For :he next two or three
years, /yderm will be used by
physicians in a carefully con
trolled study recording the
material's effect upon acne
scarred patients. The study has
already begun in California,
where Collagen Corp. has ob
tained state approval to market
the material.
So lar, the >tudy has involved
305 patients. People seeking
treatment are required to sign
a series ot consent forms, in
cluding one waiver in which
they give up the right to sue the
company or doctor if they are
dissatisfied. Despite the condi
tions placed on the study, Col
lagen Corp. has had no trouble

"All in all, I've been pleas
antly pleased with /yderm's ef
lect upon facial defects, espe
cially the deeper, wider type
acne scar," said Dr. William
Watson, a dermatologist at the
Medical Center and one ot the
doctors involved in the study.
Reports from the study dis
play a 60 to K0 percent im
provement rate, figures which
have lead Watson to believe
that, "/yderm's potential is
super, but as it now stands, it's
no panacea.
"Realistically speaking,
/yderm is a useful adjunct to
other things available, but it's
not the total answer," he said.

Many patients are attracted
to /yderm as a complement to,
or replacement tor, the pain

process in which the outer
layers ol skin are literally
sanded off the lace.

tended convalescence ot the
dermabrasion method,
/yderm smooths out scars and
becomes a part ol the living tis

the company will submit an
application to the U.S. Food
