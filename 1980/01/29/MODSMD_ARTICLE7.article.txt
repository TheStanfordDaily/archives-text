# OSU beats Stanford's slowdown, 18-16

Call it the Super Bore. Call it
bush league basketball. Call il
great strategy — but whatever
you call it, the Stanford Cardi
nals almost upset the second
ranked Oregon State Beavers,
losing 18-16 before an unbe
lieving Maples Pavilion crowd

ot 5097 and a regional TV audi
ence.
Using a slowdown strategy
that brought Oregon State
down to their level, Stanford
was still in a ball game they had
no business being in when a
questionable traveling call on
Brian Welch with nine seconds

left sent the Cards to their 14th
loss in 17 games.
But they could not go down
without a non-tight. The Cards
figured they could not lose the
light if they refused to attack —
so they didn't, relying instead
on a delay game to wear down
OSU.

The Cards had been practic
ing the stall game for a week in
anticipation of ambushing the
Beavers, who are now 19-1 and
undefeated in Pac-10 play
(Stanford is 1-8). And though
they were never ahead, Stan
ford controlled the pace of the
game for 40 minutes.
"Why the delay? Because
we're the last-place team in the
conference and they're the
second-best team in the na
tion," a weary Dick Dißiaso
said. The Stanford head coach
had not planned to use the stall
the entire game, butwhystopa
good thing?
"As long as (Oregon State)
played the zone (defense) we
were willing to delay," he said.
But we would play a
controlled-tempo when they
switched to man-to-man. They
have great qu^kness."
Great quickness is some
thing the Cards greatly lack.
The only way they had a chance
to win was to make Oregon
State play the way Stanford
wanted to play — slowly. In the
end, winning head coach
Ralph Miller was happy they
did.
"I was pleased with our per
formance. It was our first ex
perience with this type of
ballgame," Miller said over the
noisy locker room crowd. "I
didn't really expect them (Stan
ford) to come out with this type
of game. But you play the best

way you can win.'
The only portion of the game
played normally was the 30
seconds following the first tip.
After OSU missed three shots,
Stanford was off and stalling.
Though there were kinks in the
first eight minutes, the slow
down was working. The be
fuddled Beavers hurried their
shots when they got the ball,
probably out of excitement
over having the ball at all.
Nonetheless they had crept
out to a 6-0 lead with 11:30 left
and the Cards were not catch
ing up. They were not even
shooting.
"Our strategy Was to stay in
the delay, even if we were
down by as many as six toeight
points," Dißiaso said. Their
patience paid off. Forward
Brian Welch canned a 25-footer
with 10 minutes left — the only
initial basket ever to get a
standing ovation — and the
Cards began clicking.
Welch tied the score with
three seconds left in the half at
12 on a 20-foot jumper. Stan
ford wasted no time at all in
stalling, continuing once the
second half began. When
Maity, who led all scorers with
eight points, hit a lay-up with
17 minutes left, the Cards led
14-12.
After OSU tied it up quickly,
neither team scored for six mi
nutes, Stanford controlling the
ball for the majority of the
time. They traded baskets
quickly and then Beaver center
Tony Martin hit a backdoor
lay-up with 9:58 to make it
18-16. That was the last basket.

With a secure two-point
lead, the Beavers went into a
stall of their own, holding pos
session for seven minutes
without shooting.
Stanford then fouled in suc

cession the Beavers' two worst
foul-shooters, Dwayne Allen
and Martin. The strategy
worked, Kimberly Belton (who
did not take a shot the whole
game) pulled down Martin's
shot with 1:34 to play.
"It was our goal to come
down to the final two minutes.
We were not trying to go for
the last shot. We wanted to try
and get Brian taking a jump
shot or get Kim inside," Di-
Biaso said.
It failed to happen. The
Cards ended up holding for
one shot and with nine sec
onds left, Welch was called for
traveling at the foul line. It was
a judgment call — Welch was
fouled by one of the three
Beavers surrounding him —
but referee Irv Brown judged it
for Oregon State.
DiBiaso was philosophical in
losing. "Each coach has to do
what he has to do. We didn't
necessarily want to stall."
