The Los Angeles Times
Despite the concerns ot some that the stres
ses ol working may increase women's heart at
tat k rates, a new study indicates that working
women generally are no more likely to develop
coronary heart disease than women who stay at
home.
But there 1 is one group of working women tor
whom the general linding does not apply
clerical workers, especially those who are or
have been married and who have children.
I or this group, researchers Irom the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute who did the
study say, the risk ol heart disease is twu e that ol
other working women or housewives.
Ihe study by Suzanne Haynes, an
epidemiologist, and Dr. Manning Feinleib will
appear in the February issue of the American
Journal ol l'uhli< I it\ilth.
It involved <50 housewives and <87 working
women who li\e in I ramingham, Mass., the site
ol an extensive heart disease study ol males,
which has been under way lor about H) years.
The women ranged in age Irom 45 to 64 and were
followed lor eight years tor signs ol heart dis
ease alter having been given an extensive
psycho-social questionnaire in the mid-l%()s.
Speculating on the reasons why only clerical

workers were more susceptible, the researchers
suggest that it might be explained by combined
job and home circumstances.
Compared to professional, executive or other
higher echelon women workers, as well as to
housewives, the results ol the psycho-social
study showed that secretaries and other clerical
workers had the most suppressed anger.
Women who said they had dilliculty getting
anger oil their chest or that they seldom talked
to a Iriend or relative about angry teelings were
most apt to be cleric al workers and most likely to
get < oronary artery disease, the investigators
said.
They also complained the most about unsup
portive bosses, and they had a tendency to stay
on the same job tor 10 years or longer. "They
had almost no control over their jobs. They were
told what to do and when to do it. They had no.
freedom ol movement," Haynes said in a tele
phone interview.
But the higher heart disease rate occurred
only among women workers in clerical jobs who
had children, for single women in those jobs,
the disease rate was no higher than tor house
wives or tor women doing other kinds ot work.
Clerical workers with children whose husbands
had blue-collar jobs were in the highest risk ot
all.
