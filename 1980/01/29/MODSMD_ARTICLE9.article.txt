# Rand says alcoholics can drink moderately

### 
Sanfa Monica (AP) — A new
Rand Corp. study promises
another round of bitter debate
over the idea that some al
coholics can drink moderately
without wrecking their lives.
The report, released last
week, was a follow-up to a 1976
study that was harshly con
demned by many treatment
groups when it suggested
"some alcoholics can return to
moderate drinking with no
greater chance of relapse than
if they abstain totally."
"You can say the earlier find
ings are modified (by the new
study). . . but it is certainly not
a reversal," said David Armor
ot the Santa Monica research
center.
But the Rand researchers
and the National Institute for
Alcohol Abuse and Al
coholism, which paid $549,000
for the study, seem to find dif
ferent messages in the data.
Much of the problem, how
ever, may be only differences
in emphasis and in the defini
tion of "alcoholic."
The NIAAA said the study
"reinforces our contention
that abstinence must be the
appropriate goal in the treat
ment of alcoholism."
Chief researcher J. Michael
Polich of Rand said the data
show that for one group of al
coholics — men under age 40
who are not yet severely de
pendent on alcohol —"Re-
lapse rates were lower among
nonproblem drinkers (those

who drink moderately) than
among abstainers."
He said the opposite is true
tor older and more heavily de
pendent alcoholics, "for
whom (moderatedrinking)can
be a very risky behavior."
And, he emphasized, "We
said in this report, and in our
previous report as well, that
based on these data we do not
recommend that any alcoholic
resume drinking."
The research involved 781
men admitted to federally
funded alcoholism treatment
programs in 1973. The 1976 re
port was based on a study
made 18 months after treat
ment began, while the new re
search studied the men again
tour years later.
