Did yon know
we can find
abreast cancer
as small as the
head of a pin?
Such a tiny cancer can
almost always be cured
Mammography, a technique
of low dose breast x-ray. can
detect a cancer long before a
lump can be felt. While it is
still highly curable
If you are over 50 or
have special reasons to be
concerned with breast
cancer, ask your doctor
about mammography
