Three students Irom the three most prestigious
universities in California were talking about
holidays The San Jose State student re
marked he liked Easter because it was the day
that we honor our nation s forefather s who
signed the Declaration ol Independence, shot
oil fireworks, and got drunk The student Irom
the University ol San Franicsco interrupted
saying You have it all wrong l Easter is the
holiday when we eat turkey, watch football
games and honor the pilgrims and the In
dians The Stanford student calmly resolved
the issue by saying. You driveling cretins are
both misinformed Easter is the holiday when
the Chnstians honor Jesus Chirst, who was
crucified on a cross, his enshrouded body was
interred in a cave in front ol winch a large
boulder was placed After three days Jesus
rose from the dead, pushed aside the boulder
and it he sees his shadow there s si* more
weeks ol winter
