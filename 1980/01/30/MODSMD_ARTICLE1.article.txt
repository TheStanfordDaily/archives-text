# Affirmative action goals missed
## Hiring deficiencies cited 
### Jill Liscom 
The University has been given a
30-day grace period, ending in mid-
February, to respond to deficiencies
in its hiring and retention of women
and minority faculty members
here.
In a recent federal report, the Uni
versity was charged with failure dur
ing the past six years to meet its own
affirmative action goals for hiring
Medical School faculty. Other
schools within the University met fa
cully hiring goals, but were charged
with not meeting retention and
promotion goals for faculty women
and minorities.
The report, based on a three
month review by two compliance of
ficers on campus, was issued bv the
San Jose regional office of the Fed
eral Contract Compliance Program
(FCCP).
According to Santiago Rodriguez,
affirmative action officer here, the
University will seek an extension of
the 30-day limit.
Although most of the items should
be met by the deadline, Rodriguez
said, "it appears that two or three ot
the items require more staff time."
Rodriguez said the University has
made a special effort to maintain a
"good working relationship" with
the FCCP officers.
The University will ask tor an ex
tension informally, he said, and then
go through a formal petition process
it necessary. It the petition is rejected
and the University cannot meet the
given deadline, the "ultimate sanc
tion" would be withdrawal of federal
funds to the University, Rodriguez
said.
Although it would be very rare for
this to happen, Rodriguez said this is
a "legitimate threat" which could
possibly hinder new contracts de
pendent on federal grant money.
According to Rodriguez, one of
the main items requiring extra time is
determining what percentage of
minority applicants is available tor
any specified job area. This involves
collecting data, analyzing that data,
and then using it to get availability
percentages, he said.
Based on the calculated av
ailabilities, the University must set
new goals and timetables for affirma
tive action policies to remedy its past

deficiencies.
This is a "lengthier process" which
will take about 45 days, Rodriguez
said.
One of the problems in meeting
affirmative action goals, said Rod
riguez, is that the University has not
delined the job areas narrowly
enough.
One ot the corrective actions de
manded by the FCCP is revising job
groups for faculty and other
academic stall "to include faculty
positions from departments having
similar academic disciplines and
common administrative control (un
der a single dean)."
Within these related areas, job
groups should be further broken
down into separate areas for tenured
faculty, nontenured faculty, lectur
ers and research associates, the re
port mandates.
Rodriguez said the University also
must set affirmative action goals
within each vice-presidential area,
with objectives for hiring and promo
lions to be met in no more than five
years.
In the past, some areas have met or
exceeded their goals while others
have not, Rodriguez explained, so
that "one area could theoretically
carry the rest of the University be
cause it looks good overall."
By establishing separate goals for
each area, "we can make sure the

other areas carry their own burden,"
he added.
Other corrective actions de
manded by the FCCP include:
— Revising internal reporting sys
tems to measure the effectiveness of
the total affirmative action program,
including data on all applicants, new
hires, promotions, terminations,
transfers, layoffs and recalls; and
Including performance on
equal employment opportunity in
the performance reviews of super
visors, managers, department chair
persons and deans.
Although hiring gains were made
in several other areas within the
Medical School, they were offset by
subsequent losses.
According to Bliss Carnochan,
dean of graduate studies, the basic
problem in not hiring more
minorities was that "we did not find
qualified applicants."
However, the question remains
whether thare were qualified applic
ants who the University did not tind
in its search, Carnochan added.
In the luture, hiring officers here
will rely on three newly formed task
forces and present faculty here for
information on possible applicants,
Carnochan said.
"One of the extra-curricular
duties" that minority faculty here are
willing to take on is a continuous
search tor qualified minorities.

The report, based on a three
month review by two compliance of
ficers on campus, was issued bv the
San Jose regional office of the Fed
eral Contract Compliance Program
(FCCP).
According to Santiago Rodriguez,
affirmative action officer here, the
University will seek an extension of
the 30-day limit.
Although most of the items should
be met by the deadline, Rodriguez
said, "it appears that two or three ot
the items require more staff time."
Rodriguez said the University has
made a special effort to maintain a
"good working relationship" with
the FCCP officers.
The University will ask tor an ex
tension informally, he said, and then
go through a formal petition process
it necessary. It the petition is rejected
and the University cannot meet the
given deadline, the "ultimate sanc
tion" would be withdrawal of federal
funds to the University, Rodriguez
said.
Although it would be very rare for
this to happen, Rodriguez said this is
a "legitimate threat" which could
possibly hinder new contracts de
pendent on federal grant money.
According to Rodriguez, one of
the main items requiring extra time is
determining what percentage of
minority applicants is available tor
any specified job area. This involves
collecting data, analyzing that data,
and then using it to get availability
percentages, he said.
Based on the calculated av
ailabilities, the University must set
new goals and timetables for affirma
tive action policies to remedy its past

deficiencies.
This is a "lengthier process" which
will take about 45 days, Rodriguez
said.
One of the problems in meeting
affirmative action goals, said Rod
riguez, is that the University has not
delined the job areas narrowly
enough.
One ot the corrective actions de
manded by the FCCP is revising job
groups for faculty and other
academic stall "to include faculty
positions from departments having
similar academic disciplines and
common administrative control (un
der a single dean)."
Within these related areas, job
groups should be further broken
down into separate areas for tenured
faculty, nontenured faculty, lectur
ers and research associates, the re
port mandates.
Rodriguez said the University also
must set affirmative action goals
within each vice-presidential area,
with objectives for hiring and promo
lions to be met in no more than five
years.
In the past, some areas have met or
exceeded their goals while others
have not, Rodriguez explained, so
that "one area could theoretically
carry the rest of the University be
cause it looks good overall."
By establishing separate goals for
each area, "we can make sure the

other areas carry their own burden,"
he added.
Other corrective actions de
manded by the FCCP include:
— Revising internal reporting sys
tems to measure the effectiveness of
the total affirmative action program,
including data on all applicants, new
hires, promotions, terminations,
transfers, layoffs and recalls; and
Including performance on
equal employment opportunity in
the performance reviews of super
visors, managers, department chair
persons and deans.
Although hiring gains were made
in several other areas within the
Medical School, they were offset by
subsequent losses.
According to Bliss Carnochan,
dean of graduate studies, the basic
problem in not hiring more
minorities was that "we did not find
qualified applicants."
However, the question remains
whether thare were qualified applic
ants who the University did not tind
in its search, Carnochan added.
In the luture, hiring officers here
will rely on three newly formed task
forces and present faculty here for
information on possible applicants,
Carnochan said.
"One of the extra-curricular
duties" that minority faculty here are
willing to take on is a continuous
search tor qualified minorities.

The University has been given a
30-day grace period, ending in mid-
February, to respond to deficiencies
in its hiring and retention of women
and minority faculty members
here.
In a recent federal report, the Uni
versity was charged with failure dur
ing the past six years to meet its own
affirmative action goals for hiring
Medical School faculty. Other
schools within the University met fa
cully hiring goals, but were charged
with not meeting retention and
promotion goals for faculty women
and minorities.
