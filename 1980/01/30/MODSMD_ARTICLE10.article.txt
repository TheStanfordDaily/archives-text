The Los Angeles Times
lubti, Equatorial Guinea —
The Soviet Union, in another
Alrican setback, has lost its
military base here on the (>ult
of Biatra and the lucrative fish
ing rights it held lor six years.
The losses are a result of the
coup last August that brought
to power a pro-Western gov
ernment in this tormer Spanish
colony. Bui they also reflect a
belief, widely held in Africa,
that Moscow takes lar more
out of these impoverished
countries that it puts in.
During the 1975 Angolan civil
War, the small base here at
Luba was a staging area lor
Soviet advisers and Cuban
troops who helped the pro-
Moscow taction ioyal to Agos
tinho Neto win control. In re
tent years the base has been
used as a Soviet communica
tions and intelligence post lor
the South Atlantic and as a
logistical depot for the Soviet
fishing tleet.
The Soviets rented the base,
which consists of several old
warehouses and a floating
dock, tor $(>OO a year, govern
ment sources said. The lishing
agreement, which was not re
newed when it expired Dec.
51, permitted the Russians to
keep 75 percent of their catch
and sell the remainder to the
Guineans lor hard currency.
The Guineans complain that
they got mostly rotten fish.
In Guinea-Bissau, another
West African country, the
Soviet Union negotiated a simi
larly favorable monopoly in
1976, except that the lish are
processed on board a Soviet
vessel offshore, then sold to
the Guinea-Bissauans in cans
labeled "Caught in Russian
Waters."
'Vacuum-clean'
On Africa's east coast, Spain
pays Marxist Mozambique $2.4
million a year lor fishing
rights. The Soviet Union gets
them tree. It "vacuum-cleans'"
the country's 1500—mile
coastline, keeping 75 percent
of the catch and giving
Mozambique the least saleable
25 percent.

Although the Soviet Union
retains great influence in
Mozambique, Angola and
Ethiopia, its position on the
continent as a whole seems to
have deteriorated in recent
years; 27 African countries
voted tor the U.N. reoslution
deploring the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
Egypt, Ghana, Sudan and
Somalia have all pulled out oi
alliances with the Soviet Union
in the past 15 years. In 1977, flu?
Russians were expelled from
Somalia and kicked out ot then
Indian Ocean base at Berbera!
last year they lost their loot
hold in Uganda when Presi
dent Idi Amin was overthrown.
Another West African coun»
try falling out of the Soviet
sphere of influence is Guinea,
also an important staging area
during the Angolan c ivil war.
Guinea's president, Sekou
Toure, no longer allows Soviet
reconnaissance planes to fly
out ol Conakry to track U.S.
lleel movements in the Atlan
tic, as they did from 197 5 tc)
197 K. He turned down a Soviet
request, two years ago, to
build a naval base on Tamara
Island.
Longer runway
Toure grumbles privately
that nearly two decades of al
liance with Moscow got
Guinea little more than a sports
stadium, a lew small office
buildings, a military academy
(now empty) and a longer run
way at the international air
port.
The Soviet Union, however,
got important military facilities
in Guinea, a lishing monopoly
with the right lo keep b0 per
cent oi the catch, and signific
ant supplies ol bauxite lor
which il pays about hall the
world price.

The Los Angeles Times
lubti, Equatorial Guinea —
The Soviet Union, in another
Alrican setback, has lost its
military base here on the (>ult
of Biatra and the lucrative fish
ing rights it held lor six years.
The losses are a result of the
coup last August that brought
to power a pro-Western gov
ernment in this tormer Spanish
colony. Bui they also reflect a
belief, widely held in Africa,
that Moscow takes lar more
out of these impoverished
countries that it puts in.
During the 1975 Angolan civil
War, the small base here at
Luba was a staging area lor
Soviet advisers and Cuban
troops who helped the pro-
Moscow taction ioyal to Agos
tinho Neto win control. In re
tent years the base has been
used as a Soviet communica
tions and intelligence post lor
the South Atlantic and as a
logistical depot for the Soviet
fishing tleet.
The Soviets rented the base,
which consists of several old
warehouses and a floating
dock, tor $(>OO a year, govern
ment sources said. The lishing
agreement, which was not re
newed when it expired Dec.
51, permitted the Russians to
keep 75 percent of their catch
and sell the remainder to the
Guineans lor hard currency.
The Guineans complain that
they got mostly rotten fish.
In Guinea-Bissau, another
West African country, the
Soviet Union negotiated a simi
larly favorable monopoly in
1976, except that the lish are
processed on board a Soviet
vessel offshore, then sold to
the Guinea-Bissauans in cans
labeled "Caught in Russian
Waters."
'Vacuum-clean'
On Africa's east coast, Spain
pays Marxist Mozambique $2.4
million a year lor fishing
rights. The Soviet Union gets
them tree. It "vacuum-cleans'"
the country's 1500—mile
coastline, keeping 75 percent
of the catch and giving
Mozambique the least saleable
25 percent.

Although the Soviet Union
retains great influence in
Mozambique, Angola and
Ethiopia, its position on the
continent as a whole seems to
have deteriorated in recent
years; 27 African countries
voted tor the U.N. reoslution
deploring the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
Egypt, Ghana, Sudan and
Somalia have all pulled out oi
alliances with the Soviet Union
in the past 15 years. In 1977, flu?
Russians were expelled from
Somalia and kicked out ot then
Indian Ocean base at Berbera!
last year they lost their loot
hold in Uganda when Presi
dent Idi Amin was overthrown.
Another West African coun»
try falling out of the Soviet
sphere of influence is Guinea,
also an important staging area
during the Angolan c ivil war.
Guinea's president, Sekou
Toure, no longer allows Soviet
reconnaissance planes to fly
out ol Conakry to track U.S.
lleel movements in the Atlan
tic, as they did from 197 5 tc)
197 K. He turned down a Soviet
request, two years ago, to
build a naval base on Tamara
Island.
