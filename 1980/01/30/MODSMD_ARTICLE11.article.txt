# Listeners huddle in Iran as well
## VOA radio catches the world's ears

Washington (AP) — A group ol anti-
Khomeini demonstrators huddles over a
radio in Tabriz, Iran, listening to someone
in a studio on Independence Avenue in
Washington describe events occurring <00
yards from where they stand.
Officials of the Voice of America cite the
incident to illustrate that the Voice is find
ing an audience, even where America is
considered the enemy.*
Recently, the Voice boosted its daily
Iranian airtime from 10 minutes to three
hours, and intends to double that soon.
To catch the world's ears, America
speaks not only in Farsi, the language ot
Iran, but also in Tatar and Turkish, Azeri
and Arabic, Latvian and Lao, Hindi and
Hausa, Swahili and Spanish —and in a few
dozen other languages.
There are three "voices:" the Voice ot
America, Radio free Europe and Radio
Liberty.
VOA's mission is to explain America to

the world. RLE, which beams into Eastern
Europe, and RL, which aims its broadcasts
into the Soviet Union, try to operate as
though they were internal organs ot the
countries they address.
The two "Radios" were up as CIA
operations. They came in Irom the Cold
War six years ago to be openly acknow
ledged as instruments of the U.S. govern
ment.
Responding to the Soviet move into At
ghanistan, Radio Liberty doubled its et
torts to reach the Moslems of Soviet Uz
bekistan but still broadcasts to them only
\l minutes a day in each ol seven lan
guages.
In its Iranian broadcasts, VOA stresses
that most of the world has condemned
Iran. It carried the Security Council de
bates, sent a correspondent to the World
Court and broadcast profiles ol six ol the
hostages so Iranians would think ot them
as individuals, not symbols.

In its broadcasts on Afghanistan, says
acting director Hans Tuch, the VOA had
three objeclives — to alert the Islamic
world about the Soviet action, "to tell the
Soviet people what their government had
done" and to stress to non-aligned coun
tries how their leader, Cuba, had sided
with the Soviet Union at the United Na
tions.
The Voice started with World War 11.
Seventy-nine days after Pearl I tarbor, VOA
went on the air with this pledge:
"Daily at this time, we shall speak to you
about America and the war; the news may
be good or bad; we shall tell you the
truth."
Tuch says his agency still tries to tell the
truth, good or bad. He served VOA in
Brazil during Watergate, and says he feels
VOA established its credibility during that
era: every night on his shortwave radio, he
heard a U.S. government agency describe
ettorts to oust a U.S. president trom offke.
