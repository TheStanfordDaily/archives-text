# Fellowship student here accuses in book
## Bundy case shows law weakness 
### Laura Erickson 
The Ted Bundy case has "highlighted the
weaknesses ot the law-entorcement sys
tem,'' according to Steve Winn, co-author ot
the newly-released book, Ted Bundy: The Kil
ler Next Door. Winn is at the University on a
Stegner writing fellowship.
In the mid-1970s more than 50 young
women trom around the country disap
peared. Latei, the police tound many ot their
mutilated corpses, hut very tew clues regard
ing the murderer. The most memorable
crime involved the strangling ol two college
coeds in a sorority at the University of
Florida. Alter a long search, police arrested
Bundy. He escaped twice, was twice recap
tured, and was eventually convicted and sen
tenced to death. Bundy has maintained his
innocence all along.
"The police search tor and conviction o!
Bundy is a prime example ot goal-oriented
law enforcement," said Winn. He said that
the police mishandled the case many times. A
prime eyewitness identified Bundy as the as
sailant only alter much police suggestion.
In Washington, the skeletons ot two girls
were so mishandled th.it they could not be
used as evidence. In Florida, Bundy was not
allowed to see a lawyer in one instance and
one lawyer who wanted to be Bundy's lawyer
was not allowed to tor "poor reasons," Winn
said.
"People working in police departments as
sure me that this is typu al. I'm convinced that
this is the way police usually operate. We're
not in good hands." Headded, however, that
"this is not so much an indictment ot the
police they're undertrained and under
prepared. We subliminally believe that
police are always right, but this is just not
true."
Winn also said he felt that the "rights ol the
defendant have been eroded over the last ten
years." He said that the Bundy trial had been
very publicized and that he doubted that
Bundy could get a tair trial anywhere. "Doing
the book c hanged my ideas on the individu

al's rights. The sad thing is that it all this
happens to a well-spoken law student, what
happens to the poor blacks in the ghettos("
Interestingly, Winn said he believed that
Bundy did commit the crimes. "I believe he's
guilty. I'm caught una bind)by detending the
murderer." Commenting on Bundy himselt,
Winn said, "It there is a lesson to be learned,
it is that we cannot trust appearances. Bundy
is very persuasive and well-spoken. When I
spoke to him in a phone interview, he was
delight!ul. The women he murdered all went
with him ol their volition."
When asked about Bundy's reputed men
tal disorders, Winn said, "Bundy's a sick per
son, but there's no clinical evidence to sup
port schizophrenia. His behavior isn't incon
sistent with that of a psychopath."
Winn said, "In all my wildest dreams, I
never thought my first book would be on a
subject likethis. It'soneof thosecases where
a story just tails into your lap." His publisher
lirst suggested it to him, and although "I had
no intrinsic interest in the story," Winn be
came more interested as he did" research.
"The book was purely a journalistic en
deavor." FHis tirst contacts were with police,
Bundy's lawyer and iriends, and tamilies ol
victims in Washington, where Bundy had
committed his early crimes and where Winn
lived.
"Writing the book was emotionally drain
ing. It changed my hie; it put me in touch
with a depth ot emotion that I hadn't experi
enced before." In his book, Winn said that he
was "trying to put these crimes in a larger
context and look at their human aspects â€”
how they affected the victims' families, the
police. The book is a mirror ot life."
Presently, Winn is writing short stories
while at Stanford on his fellowship. He re
ceived his M.A. trom the University of
Washington and worked as a journalist in
Seattle tor three years before coming here.
Winn said he hopes to stay in the Bay Area
and write liction.
