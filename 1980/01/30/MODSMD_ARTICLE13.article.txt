# Ujamaa: is 'familyhood’ strong at the black theme house here?
## 
### Karen Reynolds 
The legitimacy ot Ujamaa,
the black theme house here,
has been questioned in the
past by the dorm's most severe
critics. They claim there is no
need tor such a theme house
on campus. Vet others say that
the dorm's function can be
better understood ii Ujamaa is
regarded as a tamily.
This year, tamilyhood, which
is the meaning ot "ujamaa," is
the atmosphere that an
energetic statt ot house as
sociates iRAs) is trying to create
lor the residents. As one stu
dent remarked, "Ujamaa has a
very comfortable environ
ment, not only tor blacks, but
lor everyone, because people
here generally have a very
good attitude and are very
triendly."
Another student com
mented, "I'm a transter stu
dent and when I lirst moved in
here, I wasn't too happy to lind
myselt in the black theme
house. But it's been great! I've
made good friends here and
this is where I spend all my
time outside ot classes."
The only major complaint
many students have against
Ujamaa is that the dorm is tar
too noisy and that they have to
go elsewhere to study.
There are 115 residents at
Ujamaa, 50 percent ot whom
are black. This situation is in
timidating for many white stu
dents, but most feel that it is an
obstacle which is easily over
come, according to Jet I Raikes,
RA and Ujamaa resident lor
three years. "Part ot the ex
perience is learning to deal
with the feeling that you are
not in the majority," he said.
For many black students,
Ujamaa is a learning experi
ence in much the same way,
only from the opposite

standpoint.
"Most of the 'integrated'
dorms on campus usually have
live or six minority students liv
ing there, two or three of
whom might be black," said
resident Julie Henry. "Ujamaa
otters many black students
their lirst opportunity to live
together and to learn some
thing about black culture."
Ujamaa, as the black theme
house, otters both black and
white students the opportunity
to learn more about them
selves and another culture.
Aside Irom the tour RAs, there
are live theme associates who
coordinate programs designed
to enlighten the interested

student about some aspects of
black culture.
Earlier in the year, Dr. Asa
Hilliard, a professor of history
at San Francisco State Univer
sity, discussed black history
with students in the Ujamaa
lounge.
Movies relating to the his
tory ot black culture have also
been shown there, and, in the
past, various black performers
and artists have often used the
Ujamaa facilities to conduct
their lectures and perfor
mances.
Also, the walls and stairwells
ot Ujamaa are decorated with
posters of prominent black in
dividuals and historical events.

Aside from these cultural ac
tivities, the dorm sponsors a
variety ot more typical dorm
functions. Not only have they
sported several study breaks,
but house members decorated
the place as a Haunted House
lor Halloween, and the dorm
has also sponsored a '60s party,
and contributed to the
Lagunita Court party.
finally, Ujamaa has a prog
ram, "Outreach," in which }()
to 40 students trom Ujamaa eat
in another dining hall once a
week. This program is de
signed to remind other black
students that they are not
alone and to one ourage people
to come to Ujamaa.
