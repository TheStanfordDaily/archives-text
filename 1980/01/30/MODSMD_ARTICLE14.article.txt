Austin, Texas — The industri
ous (apanese, who filled U.S.
highways with Datsun com
pacts and Honda two
wheelers, are looking at Texas'
wide-open spaces as potential
territory lor another transpor
tation import — the high
speed "bullet" train.
Since 1853, when Commo
dore Perry visited their Pacific
island nation with a gift ot a
scale-model train, the
Japanese have become masters
of the rails by perfecting an
electric-tueled train system
which transports millions of
passengers a year at speeds of
up to 135 miles ner hour. AnH

even faster ones are on the
drawing board.
American-based representa
tives of the lapanese National
Railways believe that same
technology can be applied to
Texas and they are picking up
enthusiastic support among
state officials.
After hearing a presentation
by )NR officials last week,
Texas Railroad Commission
Chairman )ohn Poerner has
launched an aggressive com
paign to make Texas the na
tion's "proving ground" tor a
japanese-style train system.
The Railroad Commission
chairman plans to seek con
gressional support for a De
partment of Transportation
feasibility study for a high

speed train network in Texas. If
approved, and after years of
further study and construc
tion, the most likely first linkup
would be a 240-mile line bet
ween the state's two largest
cities, Dallas and Houston.
Using the plodding stop
and-start service now provided
by Amtrak as a contrasting
example, JNR officials build a
convincing argument for im
porting their style of rail travel
to Texas. "It will save time, if
will save gasoline, it will save
lives," says Takeshi Tamura,
the New York director of |NR.
Sincegoing into operation in
October 1964, the Japanese rail
network, called the Shinkan
sen, has transported 1.5 billion

passengers without a serious
mishap. The trains glide trom
city to city at up to 135 miles per
hour, covering the 345-mile
route between Tokyo and
Osaka in about three hours.
And unlike the deficit-ridden
Amtrak, the system has consis
tently recorded a profit, earn
ing $3 biiiion in income in 1978
compared to $1.7 billion in ex
penses.
Tamura also cites energy
conservation as another selling
point. In 1977, he says, the sys
tem used 4.4 million barrels of
oil for converted electricity to
run the line — neat !y one-tenth
the amount that would have
been used for gasoline to
transport the same number of
riders in automobiles.
