## Conserve oil, deter Soviets 
### 
The problem of how to respond to
both the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the instability in the Persian Gulf
region does not yield itself to easy
answers. President Jimmy Carter's call
for a renewal of draft registration has
brought this complex, polarizing issue
to a head.
In this situation, a reactionary jump
into an anti-Vietnam-style protest
movement is just as anachronistic as Car
ter's seeming shift toward a 19505-style
policy of containment.
The Soviet motives for the subjugation
of Afghanistan are not completely un
derstood as yet, but the possibility of
Soviet domination of the oil-rich Persian
Gulf region obviously has been en
hanced.
Clearly, America's heavv dependence
on foreign oil has placed us in a potential
no-option position. A sudden cut-off of
Persian Gulf oil would deal a crippling
blow to the economies of the United
States, Western Europe and lapan. War
might then seem inescapable.
Reduction of oil imports would in
crease our maneuverability. Immediate,
serious steps toward conservation are
absolutely vital. Right now. Anything
that obscures the real issue — that the
enemy at the present time is in large
measure ourselves — only delays this
process.
There is no military "solution."
Rhetoric about "defending spheres of
influence" doesn't change the fact that
we waste a fantastic amount of energy. If
a return to militarism leads people to
think they can go on guzzling energy,
then the future looks very bleak indeed.
Much of the current activism here and
elsewhere lacks substantial impact on
the root of the problem. Avoiding regist
ration won't make our energy problem
go away. Since one of the concrete ways
to avoid both war and the draft is to save
energy, we urge everyone to cut energy
consumption substantially.
Group activism is also needed,because
the need for conservation must be
socialized throughout America. Saving
energy, among other things, aids our al
lies, helps our economy, puts more
money into consumers' hands, reduces
pollution, decreases the need for nuc
lear power plants and begins to stabilize
a very dangerous world situation.
Conservation can produce immediate
results. But to completely free ourselves
from our dependence on foreign oil, al
ternative energy sources must be fi

nanced and developed, homes must be
converted to other energy sources, etc.
To gain time, we must be prepared to
deter foreign powers from threatening
the sovereignty of nations in the Persian
Gulf region. Currently, our conventional
deterrent lacks adequate support. Our
only effective military response is thus a
nuclear first-strike.
This is unacceptable.
Deterrence ideally convinces an op
ponent that peace is preferable to in
creased pressure. Deterrence becomes
a much less effective policy if you take
the capability to increase pressure in
small increments. Moving from
economic sanctions to a nuclear first
strike is clearly not a small step. In such a
climate, the potential for hurried, irra
tional decisions is increased.
Exclusive reliance on our nuclear de
terrent is extremely dangerous. Without
a strong non-nuclear capability, nuclear
war may seem inescapable.
A show of complete unwillingness to
develop an adequate conventional force
will only encourage the Soviets to make
further aggressive moves. This is espe
cially true in an unstable Iran. The suc
cess of Iran's Islamic revolution encour
ages Moslems in the bordering Soviet
provinces to seek autonomy, and the
Soviets view this as dangerous to their
security.
We therefore support the current
proposal for registration, which calls for
youths, probably between the ages of 18
and 26, to inform the government of
their present address. We strongly be
lieve that women as well as men should
participate in this process.
We do not support a draft at this time.
We realize that to allow any kind of re
gistration increases the chances for a
draft, but we feel this is a necessary
price.
We need time to initiate strong con
servation measures, and we must avoid
dependence solely on our nuclear de
terrent.
These measures may not make war
unavoidable. Soviet intentions are not
completely predictable, and to be self
sufficient in energy should not lead to
isolationism. We cannot turn away from
the genocide of the peoples of Afghanis
tan and Cambodia.
But the United States must extricate
itself from the potential nightmare de
veloping in the Persian Gulf and begin to
create some viable options. Conserva
tion and registration help to do this.

a return to militarism leads people to
think they can go on guzzling energy,
then the future looks very bleak indeed.
Much of the current activism here and
elsewhere lacks substantial impact on
the root of the problem. Avoiding regist
ration won't make our energy problem
go away. Since one of the concrete ways
to avoid both war and the draft is to save
energy, we urge everyone to cut energy
consumption substantially.
Group activism is also needed,because
the need for conservation must be
socialized throughout America. Saving
energy, among other things, aids our al
lies, helps our economy, puts more
money into consumers' hands, reduces
pollution, decreases the need for nuc
lear power plants and begins to stabilize
a very dangerous world situation.
Conservation can produce immediate
results. But to completely free ourselves
from our dependence on foreign oil, al
ternative energy sources must be fi

nanced and developed, homes must be
converted to other energy sources, etc.
To gain time, we must be prepared to
deter foreign powers from threatening
the sovereignty of nations in the Persian
Gulf region. Currently, our conventional
deterrent lacks adequate support. Our
only effective military response is thus a
nuclear first-strike.
This is unacceptable.
Deterrence ideally convinces an op
ponent that peace is preferable to in
creased pressure. Deterrence becomes
a much less effective policy if you take
the capability to increase pressure in
small increments. Moving from
economic sanctions to a nuclear first
strike is clearly not a small step. In such a
climate, the potential for hurried, irra
tional decisions is increased.
Exclusive reliance on our nuclear de
terrent is extremely dangerous. Without
a strong non-nuclear capability, nuclear
war may seem inescapable.
A show of complete unwillingness to
develop an adequate conventional force
will only encourage the Soviets to make
further aggressive moves. This is espe
cially true in an unstable Iran. The suc
cess of Iran's Islamic revolution encour
ages Moslems in the bordering Soviet
provinces to seek autonomy, and the
Soviets view this as dangerous to their
security.
We therefore support the current
proposal for registration, which calls for
youths, probably between the ages of 18
and 26, to inform the government of
their present address. We strongly be
lieve that women as well as men should
participate in this process.
We do not support a draft at this time.
We realize that to allow any kind of re
gistration increases the chances for a
draft, but we feel this is a necessary
price.
We need time to initiate strong con
servation measures, and we must avoid
dependence solely on our nuclear de
terrent.
These measures may not make war
unavoidable. Soviet intentions are not
completely predictable, and to be self
sufficient in energy should not lead to
isolationism. We cannot turn away from
the genocide of the peoples of Afghanis
tan and Cambodia.
But the United States must extricate
itself from the potential nightmare de
veloping in the Persian Gulf and begin to
create some viable options. Conserva
tion and registration help to do this.
The problem of how to respond to
both the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the instability in the Persian Gulf
region does not yield itself to easy
answers. President Jimmy Carter's call
for a renewal of draft registration has
brought this complex, polarizing issue
to a head.
In this situation, a reactionary jump
into an anti-Vietnam-style protest
movement is just as anachronistic as Car
ter's seeming shift toward a 19505-style
policy of containment.
The Soviet motives for the subjugation
of Afghanistan are not completely un
derstood as yet, but the possibility of
Soviet domination of the oil-rich Persian
Gulf region obviously has been en
hanced.
Clearly, America's heavv dependence
on foreign oil has placed us in a potential
no-option position. A sudden cut-off of
Persian Gulf oil would deal a crippling
blow to the economies of the United
States, Western Europe and lapan. War
might then seem inescapable.
Reduction of oil imports would in
crease our maneuverability. Immediate,
serious steps toward conservation are
absolutely vital. Right now. Anything
that obscures the real issue — that the
enemy at the present time is in large
measure ourselves — only delays this
process.
There is no military "solution."
Rhetoric about "defending spheres of
influence" doesn't change the fact that
we waste a fantastic amount of energy. If
a return to militarism leads people to
think they can go on guzzling energy,
then the future looks very bleak indeed.
