## Mark Albertson Olympic boycott tolls bell for NBC 
### 
The program opens with a
stunning panorama ot Red
Square. Quickly, the director
cuts to Moscow's Olympic
Stadium where, yes, Gary Col
eman is about to compete in
(he Hi" meter hurdles.
But wait! Shirley Jones has
just racked up an unbelievable
store on the parallel bars, and
Johnny Carson comes on the
screen to tell us about it. Live,
trom Russia, NBC and the 1%0
Olympics are on the air.
An amusing scenario lor
some, but in the corridors and
boardrooms ot NBC, nobody is
laughing. The crisis in Af

ghanistan and President Jimmy
Carter's threats ol a U.S.
boycott have sent shock waves
through much ol the corporate
world, particularly NBC. Al
though the network is insured
by Lloyd's ot London in case
the games are cancelled,
NBC's loss exceeds monetary
tactors.
NBC President Fred Silver
man and his cohorts have been
counting on the massive view
ing audience the Olympics at
tracts to pull NBC trom the
depths ol Nielsen mediocrity.
Would NBC be so desperate as
to export its stable ot prime

time stars to Moscow just so
the network would have some
thing, anything to televise to
the folks back home?
Perhaps. But tor the mo
ment, reaction to Carter's
saber rattling has taken a
strangely irrational course.
Especially galling have been
statements by some of the
athletes and Olympic officials
that politics should be kept out
ot the Games and not be per
mitted to taint the purity of in
ternational sport.
This is nonsense. The Sum
mer Games are a quadrennial
atfair that allows every nation
to practice its own special
brand of political gamesman
ship. One need only look at the
performance of Jesse Owens in
Hitler's Germany, or the brutal
massacre of the Israeli team, or
the black power salutes of I%tt
to understand how political the
Games have become.
There is also an economic
side to the Summer Olympics.
Many corporate sponsors at
tach themselves to the Games
by asserting that their product
is the "official" product of the
Moscow Olympics.
The advertising executives
on Madison Avenue believe
that the Olympic emblem adds
prestige to their clients' pro
ducts. Through most of 1980,
supermarkets and drug stores
will begin to look like souvenir

shops in the Olympic Village,
Everything, from vitamins to
motor oil, will be decorated
with the familiar five ring insig
nia.
But a boycott of the Games
by the United States will take
some ot the attractiveness
away from this advertising
ploy, to say nothing ol the
commercial revenue that NBC
will lose it they do not broad
cast the Olympics.
Money and politics. That's
what the Olympic Games
seem to boil down to every
tour years. Indeed, the pre
carious position of NBC has
added a new twist to this year's
Olympic saga.
There is a bell in the middle
of the hall where Lloyd's ot
London conducts its insurance
business. Whenever there is a
major disaster involving one of
the firm's clients, the bell is
rung toannounce the calamity.
Since the prestigious firm has
underwritten NBC's coverage
of the Summer Olympics,
chances are good that any an
nouncement ot a U.S. with
drawal Irom the Games could
cause Lloyd's famous bell to
ring again.
For whom does the bell toll ?
Alas, it tolls tor NBC.
