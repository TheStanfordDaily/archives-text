# Group discusses outreach
## SAC plans anti-draft actions 
### Carl Johnston 
Registration used to be something
one did with a checkbook and a
P.T.R.
Not anymore. Last night more than
160 members ot Stanlord Against
Conscription (SAC) met to organize
protest against registration tor the
military draft.
In a tightly organized two-hour
agenda, the group discussed out
reach and educational programs
ranging from teach-ins to non
violence training clinics.
Members ot SAC helped orches
trate Monday's anti-registration rally
St which anti-war activist Daniel
Fllsberg spoke and that attracted
more than 1000 people. The event
was covered by 18 newspapers, tour
television and three radio stations —
largely through the efforts ot SAC's
"media collective."
After an initial period of discus
sion, the 160 participants broke into 15
such "collectives," each of which

specializes in one phase of the
group's activity.
The "collective for cogent argu
ment," for example, composes
pamphlets, leaflets and position
papers that support SAC's positions.
Another collective coordinates pro
test efforts with other colleges and
universities across the country.
In addition to the 15 collectives al
ready in existence, organizers con
templated the creation of several
more including a group to recruit
new members and a group to oper
ate an informational table outside
the Post Office 24-hours-a-day.
Most interestingly, they consi
dered forming a "Rapid Deployment
Strike Force" whose job it would be
to "be ready to react any time any
where" to events which affect the
anti-registration movement when
there's no time for a meeting of the
entire group.
Although SAC has been in exis

tence tor more than a year, it was
only after President Jimmy Carter's
State ot the Union address on )an. 23
that the group began to gain
strength.
"A year ago there were only 20
people in the group," said Anne
Posthuma, one ot the meeting's or
ganizers, "but within 48 hours after
Carter's announcement, we had 100
people in the Columbae living room
at Friday's SAC meeting."
Other matters discussed were
plans to meet Rep. Pete McClos
key (R-Menlo Park) when he comes
to this area Feb. 10 and a similar pla.i
to greet Carter when he visits San
Francisco on Feb. 8.
The group characterizes itself as a
collective ol people of no particular
political belief, but who all for one
reason or another oppose the dratt
and wish to "pool energies," accord
ing to Posthuma.
