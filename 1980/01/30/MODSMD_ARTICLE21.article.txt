## Nat'l draft registration unjustified 
### 
I am angry and I am afraid,
really afraid. I am angry be
cause my president is using the
invasion of Afghanistan and
the consequent threat to two
of my tavorite nations — Pakis
tan and Iran — to reinstate the
Selective Service System in a
time of peace.
I am atraid because renewal
of registration is so easily fol
lowed by resumption of the
draft. Once the draft is
reinstated, it is all too easy to
send young Americans over
seas to fight for our "strategic
interests."
Registration is justifiable
only in terms of national
emergency; the Constitution
guarantees that at no other
time can our civil liberties be
taken from us. Threats to a por
tion of our often ill-used oil
supply are no rationale for
usurping our freedoms. The
current outcry has very nearly
become "give me liberty or
give me oil."
No America-, I am not pre
pared to give up two years of
my life — or an arm, or my life
itself — to protect "our
strategic interests." They are

not my strategic interests; I do
not believe they are really
America's.
My interests are growing up
and raising a family, working
hard to better our world, and,
most ot all, doing justice to the
precious gift of life Cod has
given me. I will not betray that
responsibility by lighting in
Iran or Pakistan for a supply of
oil which can never stabilize
our economy, simply because
that oil is possessed by nations
which can and do use it against
us. Let Europe or America be
attacked, and I will be the tirst
to volunteer.
I retuse to join the ranks,
however, of those who burn
draft cards and perform
guerilla theater. While I am
sure they take their responsi
bility to defend our freedoms
as seriously as I, I deplore their
childish, immature and un
realistic tactics. Only when
they begin toad like adults will
they be treated as adults; only

when they begin to use mod
eration and the arguments of
reason will they attract wide
spread support.
My generation grew up
watching on television the
struggles of the late 60s and
early 70s. Older brothers and
sisters fought in the streets for
the same freedoms which a
politically-motivated president
seeks to take from me now.
We all have to learn from
their experiences and tight
through the channels ot
reason — pressure on Con
gress and the courts. I am pre
pared to fight on the same
streets and campuses which
were only so recently vacated;
I only pray that I can avoid that
eventuality.
Only those who are pre
pared and willing to risk their
lives, to trade their lives for the
security of our oil supply,
should register for the draft. I
can survive without oil, as dif
ficult as that may be, if war is

the other alternative.
Fitty-thousand Americans
died in Vietnam; I have yet tp
discover the treasure for which
they sacrificed their lives. They
died in a war that was unneces
sary, one that should have
been avoided. There remains a
long list of alternatives to war
in the Persian Gulf.
May no American die while
lighting lor anybody's "stray
tegic interests" in the Persian
Cult region; may no American
allow the violation of his civil
liberties by registering for a
dratt which has not yet been
justified.
I have sent letters to Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) and Senators
S.l.Hayakawa (R-Ca.) and Alan
Cranston (D-Ca.) I urge all of
you to express your own opin
ions; you will be the ones sub
ject to the dralt.
Write your Congressmen!

my life — or an arm, or my life
itself — to protect "our
strategic interests." They are

not my strategic interests; I do
not believe they are really
America's.
My interests are growing up
and raising a family, working
hard to better our world, and,
most ot all, doing justice to the
precious gift of life Cod has
given me. I will not betray that
responsibility by lighting in
Iran or Pakistan for a supply of
oil which can never stabilize
our economy, simply because
that oil is possessed by nations
which can and do use it against
us. Let Europe or America be
attacked, and I will be the tirst
to volunteer.
I retuse to join the ranks,
however, of those who burn
draft cards and perform
guerilla theater. While I am
sure they take their responsi
bility to defend our freedoms
as seriously as I, I deplore their
childish, immature and un
realistic tactics. Only when
they begin toad like adults will
they be treated as adults; only

when they begin to use mod
eration and the arguments of
reason will they attract wide
spread support.
My generation grew up
watching on television the
struggles of the late 60s and
early 70s. Older brothers and
sisters fought in the streets for
the same freedoms which a
politically-motivated president
seeks to take from me now.
We all have to learn from
their experiences and tight
through the channels ot
reason — pressure on Con
gress and the courts. I am pre
pared to fight on the same
streets and campuses which
were only so recently vacated;
I only pray that I can avoid that
eventuality.
Only those who are pre
pared and willing to risk their
lives, to trade their lives for the
security of our oil supply,
should register for the draft. I
can survive without oil, as dif
ficult as that may be, if war is

the other alternative.
Fitty-thousand Americans
died in Vietnam; I have yet tp
discover the treasure for which
they sacrificed their lives. They
died in a war that was unneces
sary, one that should have
been avoided. There remains a
long list of alternatives to war
in the Persian Gulf.
May no American die while
lighting lor anybody's "stray
tegic interests" in the Persian
Cult region; may no American
allow the violation of his civil
liberties by registering for a
dratt which has not yet been
justified.
I have sent letters to Rep.
Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) and Senators
S.l.Hayakawa (R-Ca.) and Alan
Cranston (D-Ca.) I urge all of
you to express your own opin
ions; you will be the ones sub
ject to the dralt.
Write your Congressmen!
