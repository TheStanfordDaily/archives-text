## Carter must face failures 
### 
In response to the Daily's ar
ticle, "Students tor Kennedy
losing support," (|an. 21), I
otter the following assertions.
An individual would be
near-sighted to interpret one
meeting's unusually low atten
dance as waning support for
the Kennedy campaign on
campus. We, as a nation,
would be equally near-sighted
to deem President jimmy Car
ter's last three months in the
White House sufficient to
comprise a term of otlice
worthy of his re-election. I cer
tainly hope America's electoral
locus will not be'so narrow.
Such blind affirmation
would be the equivalent of
handing Carter a second four
years by default. I urge all
Americans to put this election
into its proper perspective. We
must support the presidency
while not forgetting to choose
the best American to fill the
job.
In reference to a discussion
ol Carter's pertormance as
president, David Bender, a
Kennedy staffer speaking at
our recent meeting, heralded
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-
Mass.) as a clear voice on
where the present administra
tion has tailed. The Daily went
on to report that Bender "was
carelul not to mention what
those failures might be." I'm
afraid I will not be so "careful."
The president, in his recent
State of the Union address,
said that "to be strong abroad
we must remain strong at
home. And in order to be
strong, we must continue to
tace up to the difficult issues
that contront us as a nation to
day."
Carter, as president, has
"remained strong" and "faced
up to the issues" in the follow
ing manner.
Inflation has risen trom 4.9
to 13.3 percent. Unemploy
ment remains at 5.8 percent.
Under his presidency the
world has lost faith in the dol
lar. At home, interest rates
have been driven to 15 per
cent.
We still have no Equal Rights
Amendment while women
continue to earn only 59 cents
for every dollar paid to men.
National Health Care legis
lation was not even introduced
by the Carter administration
until four months ago.
Piecemeal and totally devoid of
cost-control, this attempt at a

1976 campaign promise will be
short-lived.
But most outrageously, no
viable energy policy has been
realized.
The reality of Carter's energy
strategy thus far has been the
consumer's burden ol oil de
regulation prior to the passage
ol a windfall profits tax. Consis
tently the American public has
been the victim of a drought of
executive effectiveness.
Many people, including the
president himsell, react to lac
ing such truths by arguing that
Carter has been the victim of
an uncooperative Congress,
Initially, Carter should begin
by taking a lesson trom Harry
Truman concerning where the
Buck stops. Eventually, he
must admit his failures.
It Carter could only captivate
the legislature half as well as
he has our attention, in this an
election year, this expose
would be unwarranted — as
would be the candidacy of the
president's lellow Democrat,
Kennedy.
The president laces a politi
ral challenge which under
normal circumstances would
bring attention to the succes
ses and failures of his entire
term in office. Yet the presi
dent has discounted the elec
toral forum, contending that it
would not be in the nation's
best interest. An open and ob
jective field ol debate would
demand answers to the ques
tions of bow we have reached a
domestic quagmire and an in
ternational crisis.

Nevertheless, the president
has taken leave trom the "dis
tractions" of politics — or has
he? A clear message has
sounded from the Oval Office
that this is no time to mix poli
tics with international crises.
Yet the Carter campaign is
somehow exempt from this
edict.
The television highlight of
the President's political
crusade in lowa implored the
American public, "Do we or
do we not support the presi
dent as he makes the hard de
cisions in response to the chal
lenges trom Iran and Soviet ag
gression in Afghanistan?" Car
ter, the politician, is in this way
asking what his country can do
for him!
There are times when we
should all support the "office"
of the president. We are ob
liged, however, to preserve
that office's greatness through
•he all-important electoral pro
cess. Sadly enough, this very
process is now tethered by an
international situation which,
in fact, our evolved weakness
helped to foster.
Vet, the greater the price we
pay for our past short
sightedness, the more fer
vently we should demand a
political forum to bring us
proven leaders. When this oc
curs, I earnestly believe Ken
nedy will stand as the sustained
excellence which the presi
dency so desperately needs.
