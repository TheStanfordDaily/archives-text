Dissent reviewed
Every opinion expressed has
its dissenters. Regarding |ohn
Hochheimer and Anna
McDonnell's critique (Daily,
Jan. 28) ot our concert review
iDaily, Jan. 17), we make the
following points:
1) "Sunshine Daydream" is a
lyric in "Sugar Magnolia," not a
separate song. We regret the
error, which was due to two
heads writing one review, not
lack of knowledge.
2) The Grateful Dead was not
the only act in the show, nor
even necessarily its high point.
Propaganda was not the pur
pose ot our review, a co-author
ot which is a dedicated Elead
fan.
of the

Dead-He.ids and clouds of
cannibis smoke were not in
tended to be derogatory,
"square" or "hip."
There are enough people in
and around campus who know
what the music is, and what it's
about, to write half-decent re
views of loan Baez, the Beach
Boys, Jefferson Starship and
Carlos Santana, as well as The
Grateful Dead. Two of them
did volunteer their time and ta
lents to writing a sincere, if un
acceptable to some, review of a
worthy benefit concert.
