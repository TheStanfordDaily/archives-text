# Tenants register frequent complaints
## Housing discrimination: area problem 
### Chris Mills 
The Bay Area s tight hous
ing market is bringing land
lords and tenants tace to
face over discrimination
against families with chil
dren.
Discrimination in housing
practices on the basis ot
race, color, religion, na
tional origin, ancestry, sex,
marital status or physical
handicap are already prohi
bited by state or federal
laws. Now fair-housing ad
vocates are pushing to end
child dis< rimination.
"We all know that we
need more housing, but we
can't forget that whatever
housing is around has to be
made available to
everyone," housing advo
cate Ann Marquart said.
Marquart is director of Op
eration Sentinel, a project
of the Stanford Mid-
Peninsula Urban Coalition
in Escondido Village. Her
organization receives hun
dreds of housing com
plaints each month, about
iS of which involve illegal
discrimination.
Marquart said that since
last year, when discrimina
tion based on marital status
was outlawed, she has been
getting twice as many com
plaints on this type of dis
crimination as on racial dis
crimination. She criticized
those landlords who believe
that all single people throw
wild, noisy and destructive
parties.
"We tind all of that un
founded," Marquart said.
"You can't use what one
person has done to classify a
whole group of people."
Unknown discrimination
Child discrimination is
also a frequent complaint
heard at the Mid-Peninsula

Citizens tor Fair Housing in
Palo Alto, according to
coordinator Fllen Byrne.
She estimated that three
fourths of the housing unit-,
between Redwood City and
Sunnyvale are unavailable
to families with children.
Desperate families have
been known to commute
enormous distances, live in
their cars or even camp out
in city parks, said Byrne.
"Most people in today's
market don't even know
they are being discrimi
nated against," Byrne said.
She said landlords tell home
seekers that apartments are
unavailable, demand job re
lerences or take too long to
check credit, rather than
admit their prejudices out
right.
"The case ot discrimina
tion against Iranians shows
how irrational discrimina
tion can be, how it comes
and goes with people's feel
ings and prejudices," Byrne
continued, also recalling
that not long ago men wear
ing long hair or beards were
often denied housing.
Stanlord's Rental Hous
ing Office rarely receives
complaints of discrimina
tion, according to director
lune Becker, she said that
only one this year was from
three black students who
suspected discrimination
when they were told the
apartment they had seen
listed was no longer availa
ble. Bet ker said apartments
listed at her of fit e are often
rented by the time students
get to them.
Escondido housing
Students must be legally
married to be eligible lor
married student housing in
Escondido Village, accord

ing to Housing Center di
rector Roger Whitney. He
said Stantord s dorms and
apartments are exempt
from the fair housing laws,
but his office gives special
attention to students with
children, because ot child
discrimination in surround
ing c ommunities.
Ihe Tri-County Apart
ment Association in San
lose is a landlord group that
supports ettorts to stop il
legal discrimination in hous
ing. But vice-president E.C.
Christenson believes land
lords should have the right
to exclude children.
"I raised my children, I
have grandkids, but I don t
want them living with me
anymore," Christenson
explained. "I want the
privilege to live with
adults."
i
Landlords' rights
He cited a 1979 California
opinion poll in which 66
percent of the respondents
tavored the right ol land
lords to exclude children.
But that same poll also
showed that Calilornians
have some sympathy lor
families with children. Ol
those questioned, -14 per
cent said all tamilies should
have access to any housing
they want and can afford.
Dwight Newton ol the
lair Housing tor Children
Coalition in Oakland said he
has experienc ed disc rimina
tion lirst hand. He said he
and his c hildren, ages 2 and
9, were repeatedly turned
down by landlords who
c laimed they would tear up
the property and bother
neighbors.
Newton joined the coali
tion to heli) push lor a city

ordinance banning such
discrimination. The effort is
>ne of many underway.
Bill rejected
In Sacramento, the
California Senate last week
rejected a bill that would ex
tend the state's fair housing
laws to parents with chil
dren. In Santa Clara County,
Ihe Board ot Supervisors
passed an ordinance against
child discrimination, but it
has been bogged down in
the courts.
In 1975, San francisco be
came the iirst and only city
in the nation to pass such an
ordinance. Assistant district
attorney David Moon said
he handles tive to 10 cases
ot suspected ( hild discrimi
nation per month. Some
have resulted in lines of up
to $41)00.
The manager of an
"adults onlv" apartment
complex in Mountain View
said her main concern is for
children's satety.
"I do love children," she
said, "and we did allow
them at other apartments I
managed. But there we had
a tenced-in pool and a sepa
rate play area away from the
balconies."
■\t another complex ac
ross the street, a sign prom
ises "Children Welcome."
Ironically, the manager
there said children are too
noisy and destructive and
added she would rather live
in an adults-only commun

"Whatever the reasons

disc rimination is no hous

Citizens tor Fair Housing in
Palo Alto, according to
coordinator Fllen Byrne.
She estimated that three
fourths of the housing unit-,
between Redwood City and
Sunnyvale are unavailable
to families with children.
Desperate families have
been known to commute
enormous distances, live in
their cars or even camp out
in city parks, said Byrne.
"Most people in today's
market don't even know
they are being discrimi
nated against," Byrne said.
She said landlords tell home
seekers that apartments are
unavailable, demand job re
lerences or take too long to
check credit, rather than
admit their prejudices out
right.
"The case ot discrimina
tion against Iranians shows
how irrational discrimina
tion can be, how it comes
and goes with people's feel
ings and prejudices," Byrne
continued, also recalling
that not long ago men wear
ing long hair or beards were
often denied housing.
Stanlord's Rental Hous

complaints of discrimina
tion, according to director
lune Becker, she said that
only one this year was from
three black students who
suspected discrimination
when they were told the
apartment they had seen
listed was no longer availa

listed at her of fit e are often
rented by the time students
get to them.

He cited a 1979 California
opinion poll in which 66
percent of the respondents
tavored the right ol land

But that same poll also

Dwight Newton ol the

Bill rejected
In Sacramento, the
California Senate last week
rejected a bill that would ex
tend the state's fair housing
laws to parents with chil
dren. In Santa Clara County,
Ihe Board ot Supervisors
passed an ordinance against
child discrimination, but it
has been bogged down in
the courts.
In 1975, San francisco be
came the iirst and only city
in the nation to pass such an
ordinance. Assistant district
attorney David Moon said
he handles tive to 10 cases
ot suspected ( hild discrimi
nation per month. Some
have resulted in lines of up
to $41)00.
The manager of an
"adults onlv" apartment
complex in Mountain View
said her main concern is for
children's satety.
"I do love children," she
said, "and we did allow
them at other apartments I
managed. But there we had
a tenced-in pool and a sepa
rate play area away from the
balconies."
■\t another complex ac
ross the street, a sign prom
ises "Children Welcome."
Ironically, the manager
there said children are too
noisy and destructive and
added she would rather live
in an adults-only commun

"Whatever the reasons
lor it, the bottom line with
disc rimination is no hous
ing, Marquart said.
"Communities must be

their people's housing
needs."
The Bay Area s tight hous

lords and tenants tace to

against families with chil

Discrimination in housing
practices on the basis ot
race, color, religion, na

marital status or physical
handicap are already prohi

laws. Now fair-housing ad

"We all know that we
need more housing, but we
can't forget that whatever
housing is around has to be
made available to
everyone," housing advo
cate Ann Marquart said.
Marquart is director of Op
eration Sentinel, a project
of the Stanford Mid-
Peninsula Urban Coalition
in Escondido Village. Her
organization receives hun
dreds of housing com
plaints each month, about
iS of which involve illegal
discrimination.
Marquart said that since
last year, when discrimina
tion based on marital status
was outlawed, she has been
getting twice as many com
plaints on this type of dis
crimination as on racial dis
crimination. She criticized
those landlords who believe
that all single people throw
wild, noisy and destructive
parties.
"We tind all of that un

"You can't use what one
