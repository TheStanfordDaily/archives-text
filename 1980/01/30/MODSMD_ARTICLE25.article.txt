# People like system, not politicians

The Los Angeles Times
Professors, pundits and politicians often
complain that America's system of nominating
Us presidential candidates is too drawn out, too
awkward, too exhausting, too costly and unfair.
But the voters like it just tine.
They like the primaries, the polls, the debates,
the national conventions and even using their
lax money to help finance campaigns.
They like the press coverage ol the current
race, but are a bit tired ol stories about Chap
paquiddick.
They like the political system, but not the
politicians especially.
They think the voters in primary elections
should have more influence over who become
the nominees, and feel that contributors, politi
cal leaders and special interest groups now have
too much.
Ihey admit to learning little during the
primaries about a candidate's leadership qual
ities, administrative abilities, solutions to prob
lems and trustworthiness.
When pressed, nearly halt do not even know
whether their state holds a primary — as op
posed to a series ol caucuses or a state conven
tion — to choose delegates to the national con
ventions.
And "taking everything into consideration,"
eight in 10 say the nation has a "good" way ot
"choosing the people who are going to run tor
president."
The Los Angeles Times Poll interviewed 1047
adults, including 766 registered voters, on Dec.
16-IH in an effort to measure the attitude ol
Americans toward the primaries, the politicians,
the parties, the press and the political system
generally.
lor the most part, their attitude was upbeat.
The opportunities tor direct citizen participa
tion in the presidential nominating process
clearly are on the increase, due largely to politi
cal "reforms" initiated in the late 19605. In 1968,
lor example, only about 40 percent ol the na
tional convention delegates were chosen in
primaries. I his year, about 75 percent will be.
I he voters obviously welcomed the trend.

I hose surveyed were asked whether Itiey were
satisfied or dissatisfied with these elements ol
the American political process: political parties,
debates between candidates, public financing
of campaigns, national nominating conven
tions, opinion polls, and primaries.
Kating particularly high were primaries, polls,
c onventions and debates. People were more di
vided over parties. Ihe results, among all adults
(numbers are percentages):

Democrats were more enthusiastic than were
Republicans about polls, debates and the par
ties.
higher proportion ot Democrats than Repub
licans also ien uiai, overall, "the way we go
about choosing the people who are going to run
for president" is a "good" one.
When measured against America's "system ol
business and industry," the presidential
nominating process rated virtually as high. It
was more highly regarded than the political sys
tem generally and far surpassed in esteem the
nation's system ol administering justice."
The results:

Ihe political system was particularly lavored
by people with at least some college education
and those whose lamilies earned more than
$25,000 annually.
