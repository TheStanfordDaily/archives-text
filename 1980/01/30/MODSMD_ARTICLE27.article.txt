# Chicago's financial future still in question

m The Los Angeles Times
Chicago — With the public school
system here paralyzed by a fiscal crisis
that lett classrooms virtually empty
Monday, talk has now turned to con
cern about how long city government
can keep its own head above the red
ink.
City officials and bankers are working
overtime, trying to prevent Chicago
trom going the way ot Cleveland and
New York. Disclosures this week indi
cate that Chicago, like the other two
cities, is in fiscal hot water because it
concealed deficits and used money
earmarked tor principal and interest on
debts to instead pay tor day to day
operating expenses.
"We've got troubles,'' admitted Al
derman Roman Pucinski, a member ot
the city council's nnance committee.
"But we have time to pull it together."
"for 20 years the 'city that works' was
the city that |uggled its books," Alder
man Edward Vrdolyak said Monday, re
terring to recent revelations about
■ mismanaged school tunds and hidden

deficits in city budgets.
But while city officials worked to
keep Chicago solvent, the teachers
dominated the spotlight Mondav.
With their paychecks three weeks
late, and angered by slow and, at times,
indecisive deliberations ot both the
school board and the city council, most
ot this city's 25,500 teachers retused to
report to work Monday. Their boycott
was supported by most ot the system's
472,452 students, who also staved away
trom classrooms.
Instead, thousands ot teachers
braved 10-degree temperatures to de
monstrate their dissatistaction and to
voice their determination to stav ott the
job at a rails across trom Chicago s city
hall. t
Singing protest songs and toting
signs — sav eral oi which had a bullseye
target printed over a picture ot Mayor
lane Byrne — the teachers heard their
union president, Kobeh Healey, tell
them:
"To work tor nothing degrades not
only ourselves but our protession. We

are not greedy. We are human beings
with dignity and selt-respect and we
will be treated with dignity and -.ell
respect."
lust when paychecks tor the board ot
education's approximately 48,000
employees will be ready was still in
question Monday. Teachers and other
hoard employees are owed about $100
million in back wages, more than there
is in the board ot education's bank ac
count.
Meanwhile, over at city hall,
employees were beginning to worry
about their own pay checks.
"My boss told me I might not get paid
next month," said an aide to an alder
man who sits on the city ot Chicago's
nnance committee.
The most immediate problem lacing
Mayor Bvrne's administration was
whether the city would be able to bor
row enough money before Friday to
meet its own payrolls and to pay city
bills, some of them months overdue.
Without a loan, Chicago could have a
bare financial cupboard by next week.

Once that loan lias been secured, the
city then must borrow enough money
to help bail out the board of education,
which has no credit ot its own with the
nation's banking community.
As oi Dec. <1, 1979, the citv had sulii
cient cash on hand, with receipts an
ticipated in the month ot January, to
meet its needs during Januarv.
City budget specialists and bankers
were in New York Monday trying to ar
range tor that sale. Once completed,
the citv would then attempt to raise
5225 million to loan to the board ot
education through a bond sale ap
proved late Monday by the city council.
That would give the schools enough
cash to operate through mid-March
when a complicated bail out proposal
involving city, state and bank participa
tion expectedly would be in place.
Over the long range, Chicago will
have to find cash to cover $102 million
in deficits that Mayor Byrne inherited
when she took office last April. The city
also plans to borrow $180 million to
consolidate past debts.

m The Los Angeles Times
Chicago — With the public school
system here paralyzed by a fiscal crisis
that lett classrooms virtually empty
Monday, talk has now turned to con
cern about how long city government
can keep its own head above the red
ink.
City officials and bankers are working
overtime, trying to prevent Chicago
trom going the way ot Cleveland and
New York. Disclosures this week indi
cate that Chicago, like the other two
cities, is in fiscal hot water because it
concealed deficits and used money
earmarked tor principal and interest on
debts to instead pay tor day to day
operating expenses.
"We've got troubles,'' admitted Al
derman Roman Pucinski, a member ot
the city council's nnance committee.
"But we have time to pull it together."
"for 20 years the 'city that works' was
the city that |uggled its books," Alder
man Edward Vrdolyak said Monday, re
terring to recent revelations about
■ mismanaged school tunds and hidden

deficits in city budgets.
But while city officials worked to
keep Chicago solvent, the teachers
dominated the spotlight Mondav.
With their paychecks three weeks
late, and angered by slow and, at times,
indecisive deliberations ot both the
school board and the city council, most
ot this city's 25,500 teachers retused to
report to work Monday. Their boycott
was supported by most ot the system's
472,452 students, who also staved away
trom classrooms.
Instead, thousands ot teachers
braved 10-degree temperatures to de
monstrate their dissatistaction and to
voice their determination to stav ott the
job at a rails across trom Chicago s city
hall. t
Singing protest songs and toting
signs — sav eral oi which had a bullseye
target printed over a picture ot Mayor
lane Byrne — the teachers heard their
union president, Kobeh Healey, tell
them:
"To work tor nothing degrades not
only ourselves but our protession. We

are not greedy. We are human beings
with dignity and selt-respect and we
will be treated with dignity and -.ell
respect."
lust when paychecks tor the board ot
education's approximately 48,000
employees will be ready was still in
question Monday. Teachers and other
hoard employees are owed about $100
million in back wages, more than there
is in the board ot education's bank ac
count.
Meanwhile, over at city hall,
employees were beginning to worry
about their own pay checks.
"My boss told me I might not get paid
next month," said an aide to an alder
man who sits on the city ot Chicago's
nnance committee.
The most immediate problem lacing
Mayor Bvrne's administration was
whether the city would be able to bor
row enough money before Friday to
meet its own payrolls and to pay city
bills, some of them months overdue.
Without a loan, Chicago could have a
bare financial cupboard by next week.

Once that loan lias been secured, the
city then must borrow enough money
to help bail out the board of education,
which has no credit ot its own with the
nation's banking community.
As oi Dec. <1, 1979, the citv had sulii
cient cash on hand, with receipts an
ticipated in the month ot January, to
meet its needs during Januarv.
City budget specialists and bankers
were in New York Monday trying to ar
range tor that sale. Once completed,
the citv would then attempt to raise
5225 million to loan to the board ot
education through a bond sale ap
proved late Monday by the city council.
That would give the schools enough
cash to operate through mid-March
when a complicated bail out proposal
involving city, state and bank participa
tion expectedly would be in place.
Over the long range, Chicago will
have to find cash to cover $102 million
in deficits that Mayor Byrne inherited
when she took office last April. The city
also plans to borrow $180 million to
consolidate past debts.
