# Computer searches aid library research

The day may not be far when lib
rary users here will confront screens
with the message, "This is the Stan
ford on-line catalog. Would you like
to search a) by title, b) by author, c)
by subject ?"
The University library system is in
stalling computer terminals that will
provide catalog access to books in a
nationwide network of libraries.
"Eventually, there will be no card
catalogs," said David McDonald, sys
tems librarian. The traditional card
catalogs at Green Library and other
campus branches fa'-e the challenge
ot a faster, more responsive young
competitor â€” the computer. A
dozen computer search terminals
now function in libraries all over
campus, with four more to be instal
led in the next few weeks.
Students, lac ulty and staff may use
the terminals with a librarian's assis
tance. The Research Libraries Group
(RLG), an inter-university organiza
tion, of which Stanford is a member,
has been designing a Patron Access
Program which will allow library
users to do searches on their own.
Doug Ferguson ot RLG says these
terminals should be installed in test
sites sometime next year.
"There is a high possibility that
Stanford will be one of the test sites.
It Stanford were a test site, people
who use Green can expect to see
computer terminals near the card
catalog," said Ferguson. The program
would contain the equivalent of card
tiles tor all books acquired from 1972
on.
The eventual goal is to stop tiling
newentries in the card catalog, a step
that would save much in labor costs.
The Patron Access Program will in
clude instructions for people un
familiar with the system,
supplemented by library staff in
struction and explanatory signs, said
Ferguson. "It's really quite an easy
system. We're talking about people
getting on and off the terminals very
quickly."
Indexing
You don't have to know very
much to find what you're looking
for," said McDonald. The computer
indexes by author, title and subject.
Unlike the card catalog, however, it
responds to incomplete titles and au
thor's names and to new terms in the

language.
In addition, the list of publications
is not limited to Stanford's holdings.
They cover the resources of Colum
bia, Vale, Princeton, Dartmouth, the
New York Public Library, Brown and
nine other member universities of
RLG. Periodicals are being added to
the computer listings.
Users of any member system will
be able to borrow books from any
where in the library group, said Fer
guson.
The "self-service" programs will
output slightly different displays
trom the programs in use now. In
structions will be added and order
ing information will be deleted. The

searcher will be able to see a brows
ing display first, then a location dis
play and finally, a full display with
information about the book, au
thors), subject headings and pub
lisher.
'Enthusiastic'
Ferguson says the librarians' re
sponse to the terminals has been
"enthusiastic." The quickness of the
computer enables the staff to help
many more people.
The terminals perform fast and
thorough searches, they print the
output for the researcher and their
convenient locations save legwork.
The computer also prints catalog
cards, purchase orders and other

tedious paperwork.
"Stanford is very much in the lead
m terms of putting these terminals in
public areas, but there are a lot of
universities turning to it," said
McDonald. Compared to Stanford's
16 terminals, johns Hopkins has one,
University of Pennsylvania, two, and
University of Michigan, a "few," said
McDonald.
Money
Funds for the University's 16 ter
minals come out of the library sys
tem's regular budget, said Richard
Smith, assistant director for adminis
trative services. RLC is supported by
fees from member institutions,
