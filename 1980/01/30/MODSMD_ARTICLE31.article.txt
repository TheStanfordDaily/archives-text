## Stanford's Dick DiBiaso — not the culprit, but the victim 
###

At mealtimes, excited
students ask each other if
they felt the latest ear
thquake. In between clas
ses, they try to guess the
identity of Stanford's next
head football coach or pres
ident. During lunchtimes or
evenings they alert each
other to the reality that this
earth is teetering on doom's
precipice and the necessity
of resisting the imminent
draff registration.
These recent develop
ments have swallowed up
the negative attention paid
in the local press earlier this
month to Stanford's men's
basketball team and its
•coach, Dick Dißiaso.
Now, however, Cardinal
basketball followers must
spit out the bitter facts. Hav
ing reached the halfway
point in the Pacific-10 Con
ference season, Stanford
Owns a 5-14 overall won-loss
record and a 1 -8 conference
mark. Not since 1952-53,
when the Cards also lost 14
of their tirst 17 games, has a
basketball team on the Farm
tared so poorly.
The answers to this di
lemma come easily to the
lay observer: fire Dißiaso
and obtain a coach who
knows how to recruit good
talent.
Those who subscribe to
these solutions probably
also study by putting books
underneath their pillows
belore going to sleep.
Though he has certainly not
performed his coaching
duties flawlessly, Dißiaso
alone cannot be blamed for
Stanford's basketball
malaise. And luring talented

basketball players to Stan
lord is about as easy as exp
laining that dent in the car
lender to your tather.
Admittedly, Dißiaso
hasn't ostensibly done
much to improve Stanford's
basketball fortunes in his
4>'t seasons here. His 50-75
career record blatantly
speaks tor itself.
What Dißiaso has tailed to
accomplish is what most
successful teams have
achieved — establish a team
"identity" or style.
As Dißiaso himself
pointed out belore the sea
son began, many teams
have their own unique style.
Oregon State, for example,
relies on quickness offen
sively and defensively.
Nevada-Las Vegas, in its
heyday, emphasized of
fense, while Oregon, when
Dick Harter coached there,
concentrated on deter
mined defense.
"We never have had
enough depth to sustain a
style of play," Dißiaso said
in November. "Now we like
to think we can have an
identifiable style."
That style, explained Di-
Biaso, is "c haracterized by
high intensity and hard play
ing."
The problem with this
philosophy, however, is
that in college basketball,
high intensity and hard play
ing — two obviously related
and perhaps redundant
elements — are givens.
Practically every team plays
hard and intensely. Sheer
ferocity of effort is too sim
ple a doctrine to follow for
success. What distinguishes

the better teams is theirabil
ity to incorporate some sort
of strategy within a
framework of hard, hustling
play.
Moreover, what distin
guishes the better coaches
is an ability to quickly iden
tify a problem when it ar
rises and solve it effectively.
After enduring four losses
by three points or less laul
season, Dißiaso surely
began practice for the
1979-80 campaign prepared
to eliminate the mistakes
that create the difference in
such close games.
Therefore, it was unnerv
ing to behold a momentarily
nonplussed Dißiaso when
he was asked what the
biggest problem was on last
season's team.
"Jeez, if a team is 12-15, it
should be rather obvious,"
Dißiaso said sheepishly. In
an effort to answer the
question, he stared at the
ceiling his eyes periodically
wincing. Perhaps Dißiaso
was wincing at the memory
of last year's on-court trans
gressions. Eventually Di-
Biaso gave a satisfactory
answer, but he should have
been able to articulate more
easily something that ought
to be in the forefont of his
mind.
What should be in the
forefront of everyone's
mind is the tact that Dißiaso
has not done a bad job.
Stanford simply does not
possess enough overall ta
lent to play winning basket
ball in the Pac-10. Not even
John Wooden could con
vert the Cards into a suc
cess.

In striving to concoct a
winning formula, Dißiaso
has been forced to use an
awkward conglomeration of
personnel: a forward who
can do everything except
shot outside (Kimberly Bel
ton), another forward who
can shoot outside but still
needs to develop other ph
ases of his game (Brian

Welch), a woefully-short
center who belongs at for
ward (Orlando Ward) and
an earnest but moderately
talented corps of guards
(Doug Marty, Doug Barnes,
Terry Smith).
Thus, Dißiaso has had to
tinker with his lineup. For
(he most part, he tinkers
well. An example of this is

his tactic ot shitting de
fenses back and forth from
man-to-man to zone. This
strategy often keeps oppo
nents off-balance.
Monday night's deceler
ated 18-16 loss to Oregon
State provided the most re
cent instance ot Dißiiso's
astuteness. Though the
slow-down game Stanford
employed certainly bored
many fans and annoyed
Beaver players — "A high
school team could beat us
like that," complained
guard Mark Radtord it
was the smartest move Di-
Biaso could have made.
Recognizing the pro
nounced disparities in
quickness and quality bet
ween his club and the Beav
ers, Dißiaso knew that
tiguratively placing them in
quicksand represented
Stanford's only possible
chance for victory. It almost
worked.
What almost never works
well enough, unfortunately
for Dißiaso and the Cards, is
Stanford's recruiting effort.
Many wonder why the
football team has so much
more success recruiting
than the basketball team.
The reasons are obvious:
the hallowed tradition of
quarterbacks and receivers,
the consistently winning
teams, the comfortable fall
weather, the number of
Cards in professional foot
ball. Compare these attrac
tions to those of the basket
ball team: no winning
squad since 1973, one
NCAA championship (1942),
only two active graduates in
the NBA.

Convincing the top high
school stars in the country
to come to Stanford is
common practice for the
football team. For the bas
ketball team, such a fact is
almost unheard ot.
To understand this, con
sider Dißiaso's comparison
that to match the tootball
team's getting John Elway,
the basketball team would
have had to recruit Ralph
Sampson, the 7-toot
-4 freshman star now playing
for Virginia and the most
sought-after high-school
eager a year ago.
Getting a Sampson-type
player would cure most of
Stanford's basketball ills,
according to Dißiaso.
"Your dominating center
— which there are very few
of — can help you to recruit
better players. You can get a
good point guard automati
cally," Dißiaso said.
However, that kind ot
player is always wooed by
hundreds of schools, and
Stanford has never been
able to beat such astronom
ically long odds.
The biggest obstacle in
Dißiaso's way, however, is
academics. Dißiaso doesn't
look at academics as a hin
drance — "It's a credit to
Stanford," he said proudly.
Still, Stanford's high admis
sions standards place an in
creased burden on the bas
ketball operations.
Whereas most coaches
probably concern them
selves with a prospect's
height, weight and scoring
average, Dißiaso must also
spend time and energy find
ing out his grade-point av

erage.
"Obtaining their grades is
the toughest thing (about
recruiting)," Dißiaso
explained. "We have one
phone at all times calling the
school of the top prospects
and asking what their
grades are."
Dißiaso and his statf even
hand out Dean of Admis
sions Fred Hargadon's
guidelines for taking the
proper high school courses
to eighth graders at their
basketball camp.
Most schools enjoy the
luxury ot recruiting players
from their own geographi
cal area. Admissions re
quirements, however, force
Dißiaso to search across the
country tor players who
have both talent and good
grades.
"You're always stronger
closer to home, but we have
to go away from home in
order to find enough
people," Dißiaso lamented,
"because there aren't that
many who have the grades
and can play Pac-10 basket
ball."
Though he faces enorm
ous disadvantages com
pared to most other
coaches, Dißiaso does not
make any excuses. "I ac
cepted all this when I came
here," he said.
What Dißiaso has to do is
get more tall, strong high
school seniors to accept
Stanford. Otherwise, the
Cards will just have to ac
cept more victory-lean sea
sons like this one.
