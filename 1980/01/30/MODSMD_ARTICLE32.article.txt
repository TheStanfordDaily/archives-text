# Dowhower gets Denver's attention

Denver (AP) — The fanfare
that greeted Rod Dowhower's
arrival in Denver caught the
former Stanford head coach bv
surprise.
"I had anticipated I would
slip in under the cover ot dark
ness, and that I'd look at film
and begin talking with Coach
((Red) Miller and the othp
coaches," said Dowhowei t.n •
ing a battery of sports wi iters
and the electronic media in his
first day on the job Monday.
"After all, assistant coaches
are hired and fired every day. I
never thought my first expo
sure to Denver would be like
this."
But to Denver Bronco
loyalists, the Jb-year-old
Dowhower is no mere assistant
coach. He is the National Foot
ball League team's new offen
sive coordinator, and he brings
considerable expertise to an
area of the Broncos which has
drawn heavy criticism.
Denver's punchless often

sive attack last season promp
ted Miller, who had served as
the team's offensive coor
dinator the past three seasons,
to surrender those additional
duties and seek an offensive
specialist, especially one
grounded in the passing game.
In Dowhower, Miller
selec ted a man who has helped
tutor three straight NCAA pas
sing leaders and who has
worked with some of the most

respected offensive minds in
tootball, including current NFL
head coaches Don Coryell of
San Diego, Dick Vermeil of
Philadelphia and Bill Walsh of
San Francisco.
"I'm an advocate of a con
trolled passing game,"
Dowhower said Monday. "The
idea is to utilize your receivers
downfield in combination with
your running backs. The sys
tem has a lot ot flexibility. It's
sort ot like punch, counter
punch, in the way it attempts to
probe defenses.
"The quarterback, obvi
ously, is the focal point. And
the system is only as limited as
your quarterback — in what he
can handle mentally more than
anything else.
"The system requires a lot of
discipline. You shoot for the
high completion percentage,
but you also have the ability to
throw downfield and make the
big play when you can."
Does Dowhower's presence

on the Bronco staff mean De
nver's offense will resemble
San Diego's next season?
"It might be more like what
San Francisco is doing, but
hopefully with better results,"
he said. "Of course, you have
to take into account the per
sonnel you have. I've only just
begun the process ot
familiarizing myself with the
Bronco players. But again,
there's a lot of flexibility inhe
rent in the system to do what
you want with various
players."
Dowhower, who said he was
lured from Stanford by the
promise of having significant
input into the Bronco offense,
said he will call the offensive
plays from a scouting booth
next season.
"Red wants to take advan
tage of the new NFL rules
which make it more difficult to
defend against the pass, and
that's what I'm here for," he
said.
