## Olympians' dreams die hard 
### 
The Washington Post
As certainly as it is right for
American athletes to stay out of
Moscow this summer, so is it
right for Americans to say
thanks to them. The farmers
will get their grain money, and
the computers will be sold
somewhere, but an athlete's
dream comes without a selling
price. It limmy Carter asks that
those dreams be given up, he
should be ready to say thanks.
Strike a medal, Mr. Presi
dent.
Set a table for 550 guests.
And on July 19, when the
Olympics begin in Moscow,
the president should have as
his dinner guests, with medals
for each, the 550 American

athletes who, by their perfor
mances in trials this summer,
would have earned spots on
the U.S. Olympic team. This is
a team without games; it need
not be a team without honor.
A strong voice was heard on
Capitol Hill earlier this week.
All the hurt, dispirited athletes
should have heard it. Four
times a gold medal winner,
now 42 years old but in training
tor a fifth Olympics 12 years
after he "retired," Al Oerter
told the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, "It is time for
the athletes to put aside their
personal feelings . . .If we
show unity, it would bode well
for the athletic community and
for the United States Olympic

Committee."
Inevitably, the athletes' feel
ings have been disappointment
and anger that so precious a
dream has been denied them,
denied, in their eyes, unfairly.
Theirs is an insulated life. How
they're doing in life is not mea
sured in their grasp of diplo
macy; it is measured in tenths
of seconds and in quarters of
an inch. They chase their
dream until someone better
beats them to it. They don't
mind losing to someone bet
ter, but to lose by proclama
tion, to lose because idiots roll
tanks across a border, to lose
that way is maddening.
And they cry out. Anita De-
Frantz did. She's a rower who
lias been training tor six years
with Moscow her dream. She
came before Ihe Foreign Rela
tions Committee and said in an
athlete's mind Moscow is not a
city, it is just a place. "Inconse
quential,'' is the adjective she
used tor the city that sent the
tanks rolling.
"Three weeks ago," the
rower told the senators, "my
lite was by most estimations
unremarkable. No one other
than my rowing partner was
particularly interested in how I
utilized my tree time."
"Suddenly, my desire to
compete in the Olympic
games, which is unquestiona
bly the primary motivation to
train, became an unpatriotic

act. I was stunned, shocked
and, quite frankly, I felt bet
rayed."
The chairman of the Senate
committee, Frank Church, (D-
Idaho) said he had received a
letter from an athlete who de
clared he would use $1,900 ot
his own money to go to Mos
cow, whether or not the presi
dent, Congress or the majority
ot Americans wanted him to.
The dream is powerful. "What
is a gold medal worth?" asked
Sen. David Pryor, (D-Ark.),
who two weeks ago introduced
a resolution supporting Presi
dent Carter's call for a boycott.
What is a gold medal worth?
It's worth fame, which can be
translated into money, as done
by Bruce Jennerand Mark Spitz
and Johnny Weismuller. Sonja

Heme, who walked at Hitler's
side during the 1956 Olympics
in Berlin, is said to have made
$47 million alter the games
made her an international star.
Kurt Thomas today would
use the Olympics to get rich.
Cosmetic surgery on Linda
Fratianne's nose was not done
to help her skate better. It Bill
Rodgers is moaning over Mos
cow, it's not that he needs to
win another marathon, it's just
that an Olympic champion
sells a whole lot more running
shoes than the winner at
Caribou, Maine.
But what the Olympics are,
and what a gold medal is truly
worth, are the dreams ot
anonymous rowers who will
never get rich and 42-year-old
discus throwers for whom

sport is a nice part ot lite but
hardly the whole thing. These
are the people the Olympic
movement created, these are
people Americans should
thank.
Not that Oerter needs
thanks. He's okay. He had
been out ot the discus
throwing business for eight
years after winning at Mexico
City, eight years after throw ng
the discus 212-teet-6-inches,
his best up till then.
Oerter quit to be with his
daughters, then 8 and 10, and
when they grew into young
women, he went back to train
ing.
Not to get rich.
Because he liked it.
His weight, once down to
2 50, came back to 280 Oerter

became stronger than ever,
able to lift 525 pounds when, in
1968, he stopped at 450. A
month ago, he threw the dis
cus 221 feet, about live feel
shorter than the distance he fi
gured he'd need to make the
Olympic team.
An astonishing comeback.
"Not really," Oerter said.
"Once I got a year into it, it was
just a matter ot breaking men
tal barriers. 'I can't run that far,'
'I can't throw that far,' 'Age is
catching up with me.' Thai's
nonsense."
Before work every day, Oer
ter rides a stationary bicycle. At
lunchtime, he throws, al night,
he lilts weights. It has been
done at a cost in pain.

Frantz did. She's a rower who
lias been training tor six years
with Moscow her dream. She
came before Ihe Foreign Rela
tions Committee and said in an
athlete's mind Moscow is not a
city, it is just a place. "Inconse
quential,'' is the adjective she
used tor the city that sent the
tanks rolling.
"Three weeks ago," the
rower told the senators, "my
lite was by most estimations
unremarkable. No one other
than my rowing partner was
particularly interested in how I
utilized my tree time."
"Suddenly, my desire to
compete in the Olympic
games, which is unquestiona
bly the primary motivation to
train, became an unpatriotic

act. I was stunned, shocked
and, quite frankly, I felt bet
rayed."
The chairman of the Senate
committee, Frank Church, (D-
Idaho) said he had received a
letter from an athlete who de
clared he would use $1,900 ot
his own money to go to Mos
cow, whether or not the presi
dent, Congress or the majority
ot Americans wanted him to.
The dream is powerful. "What
is a gold medal worth?" asked
Sen. David Pryor, (D-Ark.),
who two weeks ago introduced
a resolution supporting Presi
dent Carter's call for a boycott.
What is a gold medal worth?
It's worth fame, which can be
translated into money, as done
by Bruce Jennerand Mark Spitz
and Johnny Weismuller. Sonja

Heme, who walked at Hitler's
side during the 1956 Olympics
in Berlin, is said to have made
$47 million alter the games
made her an international star.
Kurt Thomas today would
use the Olympics to get rich.
Cosmetic surgery on Linda
Fratianne's nose was not done
to help her skate better. It Bill
Rodgers is moaning over Mos
cow, it's not that he needs to
win another marathon, it's just
that an Olympic champion
sells a whole lot more running
shoes than the winner at
Caribou, Maine.
But what the Olympics are,
and what a gold medal is truly
worth, are the dreams ot
anonymous rowers who will
never get rich and 42-year-old
discus throwers for whom

sport is a nice part ot lite but
hardly the whole thing. These
are the people the Olympic
movement created, these are
people Americans should
thank.
Not that Oerter needs
thanks. He's okay. He had
been out ot the discus
throwing business for eight
years after winning at Mexico
City, eight years after throw ng
the discus 212-teet-6-inches,
his best up till then.
Oerter quit to be with his
daughters, then 8 and 10, and
when they grew into young
women, he went back to train
ing.
Not to get rich.
Because he liked it.
His weight, once down to
2 50, came back to 280 Oerter

became stronger than ever,
able to lift 525 pounds when, in
1968, he stopped at 450. A
month ago, he threw the dis
cus 221 feet, about live feel
shorter than the distance he fi
gured he'd need to make the
Olympic team.
An astonishing comeback.
"Not really," Oerter said.
"Once I got a year into it, it was
just a matter ot breaking men
tal barriers. 'I can't run that far,'
'I can't throw that far,' 'Age is
catching up with me.' Thai's
nonsense."
Before work every day, Oer
ter rides a stationary bicycle. At
lunchtime, he throws, al night,
he lilts weights. It has been
done at a cost in pain.
The Washington Post
As certainly as it is right for
American athletes to stay out of
Moscow this summer, so is it
right for Americans to say
thanks to them. The farmers
will get their grain money, and
the computers will be sold
somewhere, but an athlete's
dream comes without a selling
price. It limmy Carter asks that
those dreams be given up, he
should be ready to say thanks.
Strike a medal, Mr. Presi
dent.
Set a table for 550 guests.
And on July 19, when the
Olympics begin in Moscow,
the president should have as
his dinner guests, with medals
for each, the 550 American

athletes who, by their perfor
mances in trials this summer,
would have earned spots on
the U.S. Olympic team. This is
a team without games; it need
not be a team without honor.
A strong voice was heard on
Capitol Hill earlier this week.
All the hurt, dispirited athletes
should have heard it. Four
times a gold medal winner,
now 42 years old but in training
tor a fifth Olympics 12 years
after he "retired," Al Oerter
told the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, "It is time for
the athletes to put aside their
personal feelings . . .If we
show unity, it would bode well
for the athletic community and
for the United States Olympic

Committee."
Inevitably, the athletes' feel
ings have been disappointment
and anger that so precious a
dream has been denied them,
denied, in their eyes, unfairly.
Theirs is an insulated life. How
they're doing in life is not mea
sured in their grasp of diplo
macy; it is measured in tenths
of seconds and in quarters of
an inch. They chase their
dream until someone better
beats them to it. They don't
mind losing to someone bet
ter, but to lose by proclama
tion, to lose because idiots roll
tanks across a border, to lose
that way is maddening.
