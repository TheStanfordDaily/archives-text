## Olympians' dreams die hard 
### 
The Washington Post
As certainly as it is right for
American athletes to stay out of
Moscow this summer, so is it
right for Americans to say
thanks to them. The farmers
will get their grain money, and
the computers will be sold
somewhere, but an athlete's
dream comes without a selling
price. It limmy Carter asks that
those dreams be given up, he
should be ready to say thanks.
Strike a medal, Mr. Presi
dent.
Set a table for 550 guests.
And on July 19, when the
Olympics begin in Moscow,
the president should have as
his dinner guests, with medals
for each, the 550 American

athletes who, by their perfor
mances in trials this summer,
would have earned spots on
the U.S. Olympic team. This is
a team without games; it need
not be a team without honor.
A strong voice was heard on
Capitol Hill earlier this week.
All the hurt, dispirited athletes
should have heard it. Four
times a gold medal winner,
now 42 years old but in training
tor a fifth Olympics 12 years
after he "retired," Al Oerter
told the Senate Foreign Rela
tions Committee, "It is time for
the athletes to put aside their
personal feelings . . .If we
show unity, it would bode well
for the athletic community and
for the United States Olympic

Committee."
Inevitably, the athletes' feel
ings have been disappointment
and anger that so precious a
dream has been denied them,
denied, in their eyes, unfairly.
Theirs is an insulated life. How
they're doing in life is not mea
sured in their grasp of diplo
macy; it is measured in tenths
of seconds and in quarters of
an inch. They chase their
dream until someone better
beats them to it. They don't
mind losing to someone bet
ter, but to lose by proclama
tion, to lose because idiots roll
tanks across a border, to lose
that way is maddening.
And they cry out. Anita De-
