# 1980 season opener
## Stanford snuffs out Pacific, 5-1 
### Chris Haft 
Playing in unexciting but
satisfactory fashion, Stantord
snuffed out University of the
Pacific 5-1 yesterday in a non
conference baseball opener at
Sunken Diamond.
The Cardinals' youthful
lineup, which included three
freshmen and three sopho
mores, produced a two-run
tirst inning tor all the scoring
Stanford needed. A three-run
uprising in the fourth inning
sealed the Cards' triumph.
Scoring runs shouldn't be a
problem for Stanford this sea
son. What has plagued the
Cards in recent years is their
pitching.
Yesterday, however, the trio
of Lee Cline, Bob Boatman and
Larry Kuhn limited the Tigers to
four hits and allowed only two
runners to reach third base.
Though it wasn't as unclut
tered a performance as the low
numbers indicate — UOP left
12 runners on base — the Card
hurlers became most unyield
ing when they had to be.
"They walked a few more
batters than we would like to,
but they got tough in crucial
situations," Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess said ot

liis pitchers.
Each pitcher had to survive a
minor crisis or two. Alter Cline
retired the lirsi two batters of
the game, UOP put runners on
first and third before Cline
tanned outfielder Koy Gaebel.
Boatman, who relieved Cline
in the fourth, walked the first
batter he faced on tour pi tches.
After a forceout, Boatman hit
outfielder Joe Carrozzi with a
pitch to put runners on first
and second.
Bui the stocky left-hander
then eliminated Konrad Meyer
on a line drive to left field and
Steve Green on a force play.
Kuhn spenl almost the entire
seventh and eighth innings
pitching from the stretch posi
tion, allowing two runners to
reach base in each frame be
fore finally retiring the side.
The senior right-hander
ended the game handsomely,
however. After walking lead
off batter Bob Brzezinski, Kuhn
struck out Steve Voight and Pat
Tobin.
The next batter, catcher Wal
ter Poole, shot one to the left of
third base and Steve Buechele,
who dove, neatly gloved the
ball and threw out Poole to
conclude matters.

Stantord wasted no time in
establishing itst'll offensively.
With one out in the first inning,
UOP starter Greg Unger hit
righttielder John Elway with a
pitch.
Moments later Mike Tooth
man chopped a single over
third base. Elway, running on
the pitch, steamed into third
base as Toothman took second
on the ill-advised throw to
third.
Working carefully, Unger

walked Paul /uvella to load the
bases. Shortstop Dave Meier
then lofted a llyball to deep
right field, which Steve Jones
misplayed into a long single,
scoring Elway.
Buechele fanned on a i-2
pitch, but fust baseman Loring
Davies walked to force in the
eventual winning run.
1 he Cards gave themselves a
comfortable cushion in the
fourth inning, greeting reliever
Dave Hoftmeister with con-

secutive hits by Buechele (in
tield single). Davies (double)
and designated hitter Bob De-
Costa (single), scoring a run.
One out later left tielder
Mike Dotterer skipped a single
past UOP's intield, scoring the
final two runs.
