# Bollards to cost $90,000
## Post placement controls traffic 
### Karen Springen 
The intercampus vehicle con
trol program is completing a
$120,000 satety project designed
to eliminate unauthorized vehi
cles, according to Max Mazenko,
campus planner.
Physical barriers — posts set at
intervals to control traffic (includ
ing bollards), guidelines and
stepped-up police entorcement
constitute the basic plan. "Our
whole intent is to make Stanford a
sater place," said Mazenko.
Elimination of inner-campus
motor traffic is the goal, said
Mazenko. The better-looking bol
lards are replacing the old metal
pipes, he added.
A contractor has been working
for the last three or four months
on the bollards, he said, and they
should be done by the end of the
week.
Driving impossible
Bollards theoretically should
make driving vehicles in the
inner-campus impossible. Trucks
ram into them, however, and it
costs &JOO to replace each con
crete bollard, said Mazenko.
According to ]ohn Lerry,
facilities engineer, plain wooden
bollards cost $55.
Complete bollard construction

will cost $90,000, said Lerry.
Two new automated gates, in
addition to the current gate behind
Memorial Church, will add
another $35,000 to the price of the
program.
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation plans for one gate
on Galvez St. on the north side of
the CERAS building and one on
the north side of the Varian Labs
building.
Lerry said the plan may add a
third new gate tor an estimated
$7000 or $8000.
"Not more than a dozen bol
lards have had to be replaced," he
said. As examples, Lerry cited
some damaged bollards in the
area between Tresidder and the
Faculty Club.
According to Mazenko,
wooden bollards are cheaper than
the concrete and more able to ab
sorb damage. Concrete is the
program's first choice, however.
Concrete posts have been instal
led for architectural preservation,
but the replacement cost is too
high, said Mazenko.
The campus vehicle control
program and the bicycle safety
committee are working together.
For example, reflectors have been
put on some bollards to increase

their visibility, Mazenko said. He
added that they are reluctant to
paint the bollards with candy
stripe colors similar to those on
the old pipes "because it would
harm the aesthetic look.''
Alternatives
The committee is seeking alter
natives to the use of chains, which
are a bike hazard. According to
Mazenko, they can either con
struct more bollards or use chains
only in locations with no pave
ment.
"I'm aware of accidents from
running into chains," said Lerry.
He added that construction plans
include removing the Escondido
chains within the next 30 days.
The committee replaced the
break-away bollard with a remov
able bollard padlocked down. The
removable bollards are strictly for
emergency fire and police.
Firemen must remove the key
less lock with bolt-cutters.
Green preservative paint covers
the wooden bollards. In time, the
green should turn brown or gray.
Avoidable
The concrete bollards are not
impassable. Fire trucks can jump
curbs and run over cars to pass the
obstacles, said Mazenko.

Now concrete bollards are being placed around the University in an effort
to prohibit cars and trucks from driving through the center of campus.
Students should not drive over
the bollards. However, Lerry said,
"We do have a number of student
cowboys who like to give running
them down a try."
But, he warned, "The break
aways dented even big tire trucks,
so any clown who tries to run over
them in his Porsche or Audi will
damage his car."

"Stanford has one ot the worst
vehicle control problems of any
major university. We want to
maintain the campus tor pedest
rians and bicycles," Lerry added.
According to Mazenko, the
committee is looking lor a system
of tying up automobiles with a
"boot." The boot is a gadget that
would make the illegally parked
vehicle immobile so that the of
fender would have to go to the
police station and pay.
"The point is that Stanford is a
residential college," said
Mazenko.
"We just want to get the vehi
cles controlled. People block traf
fic and make it impossible for
students to walk safely."
Bollards are a good solution,
Mazenko said. "Bollards are on
most major university campuses.
They are a standard vehicle con
trol device."

them down a try."
But, he warned, "The break
aways dented even big tire trucks,
so any clown who tries to run over
them in his Porsche or Audi will
damage his car."

"Stanford has one ot the worst
vehicle control problems of any
major university. We want to
maintain the campus tor pedest
rians and bicycles," Lerry added.
According to Mazenko, the
committee is looking lor a system
of tying up automobiles with a
"boot." The boot is a gadget that
would make the illegally parked
vehicle immobile so that the of
fender would have to go to the
police station and pay.
"The point is that Stanford is a
residential college," said
Mazenko.
"We just want to get the vehi
cles controlled. People block traf
fic and make it impossible for
students to walk safely."
Bollards are a good solution,
Mazenko said. "Bollards are on
most major university campuses.
They are a standard vehicle con
trol device."
The intercampus vehicle con
trol program is completing a
$120,000 satety project designed
to eliminate unauthorized vehi
cles, according to Max Mazenko,
campus planner.
Physical barriers — posts set at
intervals to control traffic (includ
ing bollards), guidelines and
stepped-up police entorcement
constitute the basic plan. "Our
whole intent is to make Stanford a
sater place," said Mazenko.
Elimination of inner-campus
motor traffic is the goal, said
Mazenko. The better-looking bol
lards are replacing the old metal
pipes, he added.
A contractor has been working
for the last three or four months
on the bollards, he said, and they
should be done by the end of the
week.
Driving impossible
Bollards theoretically should
make driving vehicles in the
inner-campus impossible. Trucks
ram into them, however, and it
costs &JOO to replace each con
crete bollard, said Mazenko.
According to ]ohn Lerry,
facilities engineer, plain wooden
bollards cost $55.
Complete bollard construction

will cost $90,000, said Lerry.
Two new automated gates, in
addition to the current gate behind
Memorial Church, will add
another $35,000 to the price of the
program.
The Committee on Parking and
Transportation plans for one gate
on Galvez St. on the north side of
the CERAS building and one on
the north side of the Varian Labs
building.
Lerry said the plan may add a
third new gate tor an estimated
$7000 or $8000.
"Not more than a dozen bol
lards have had to be replaced," he
said. As examples, Lerry cited
some damaged bollards in the
area between Tresidder and the
Faculty Club.
According to Mazenko,
wooden bollards are cheaper than
the concrete and more able to ab
sorb damage. Concrete is the
program's first choice, however.
Concrete posts have been instal
led for architectural preservation,
but the replacement cost is too
high, said Mazenko.
The campus vehicle control
program and the bicycle safety
committee are working together.
For example, reflectors have been
put on some bollards to increase

their visibility, Mazenko said. He
added that they are reluctant to
paint the bollards with candy
stripe colors similar to those on
the old pipes "because it would
harm the aesthetic look.''
Alternatives
The committee is seeking alter
natives to the use of chains, which
are a bike hazard. According to
Mazenko, they can either con
struct more bollards or use chains
only in locations with no pave
ment.
"I'm aware of accidents from
running into chains," said Lerry.
He added that construction plans
include removing the Escondido
chains within the next 30 days.
The committee replaced the
break-away bollard with a remov
able bollard padlocked down. The
removable bollards are strictly for
emergency fire and police.
Firemen must remove the key
less lock with bolt-cutters.
Green preservative paint covers
the wooden bollards. In time, the
green should turn brown or gray.
Avoidable
The concrete bollards are not
impassable. Fire trucks can jump
curbs and run over cars to pass the
obstacles, said Mazenko.

Now concrete bollards are being placed around the University in an effort
to prohibit cars and trucks from driving through the center of campus.
Students should not drive over
the bollards. However, Lerry said,
"We do have a number of student
cowboys who like to give running
them down a try."
But, he warned, "The break
