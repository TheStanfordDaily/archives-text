Moslems blame Iran for crisis
Islamabad, Pakistan — Six Moslem nations
have blamed Iran itself for the current U.S-
Iranian crisis by seizing the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran on Nov. -1 and holding 50 American
hostages.
By implication it not directly, fellow Moslem
nations told Iran at the foreign ministers' meet
ing Tuesday it should release the hostages
quickly both tor its own good and the peace ot
the world, according to sources who were in
the closed conference hall.
While many nations such as Pakistan have
informed Iran privately that it was wrong to
hold the hostages, this was the first time that
view has been put to Iran in clear and un
equivocal language by other Moslem coun
tries in a torum, though closed, where a lull
account could become public quickly.
Underscoring the criticism of Iran during the
debate, which conference chairman Agha
Shahi, foreign policy advise to Pakistan Presi
dent Mohammed /ia ul-Haq, described as
"sharp and vigorous," the foreign ministers
handed Iran a setback by watering down con
siderably a resolution it insisted on that op
posed the use of force or economic sanctions
by the United States.
The key item in the resolution was a parag
raph expressing the conferees' "sincere wish
that the Islamic republic of Iran and the U.S.A.
would resolve the outstanding problems bet
ween themselves by peaceful means." The
statement trying to bridge the gap between the
United States and Iran was inserted at the urg
ing of Pakistan.
When some delegates said they also wanted
to consider the hostage taking, sources said,
Iran replied that was purely a domestic matter
but, sources continued, some nations insisted
that it had international repercussions that
threatened other Moslem states since the Un
ited States now has a fleet sailing the Indian
Ocean and the Soviets have moved into Af
ghanistan, on Iran's borders.
While Iran's deputy foreign minister, Kamal
Kharazi, said the resolution met his country's
objectives, sources close to the delegation
said it was a far cry from what Iran expected
from the Islamic Foreign Ministers.
Iran dismissed its fellow Islamic nations who
criticized keeping the hostages as being in col
laboration with the United States.
Carter backs UN hostage plan
Washington — The Carter administration has
agreed to let United Nations officials pursue a
"package deal" that would give c ustody of the
American hostages in Tehran to an interna
tional agency like the Red Cross while a U.N.
commission investigates Iran's complaints
against deposed Shah Mohammed Re/a
Pah lav i.
Diplomatic sources said Tuesday the plan is
intended to allow Iranian President-elect
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, a moderate on the hos
tage issue, a possible way of ending the hos
tage crisis while satisfying Iranian demands
that his country's grievances against the shah
be aired publicly.
According to the sources, the plan was
worked out by U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim and members ol the Security Coun
cil with the approval ol the U.S. government.
As described by the sources, it is a reworking
ot an earlier U.N. proposal to negotiate release

of the hostages in'exchange for a commission
being named under U.N. auspices to look into
Iranian complaints against the shah and the
United States.
Under the new proposal, the sources said,
the United States tentatively is willing to allow
the hostages to be kept in Tehran under the
care and protection of the International Red
Cross or a similar agency while a U.N. commis
sion goes there and c onducts an investigation.
However, the sources continued, the hos
tages would be released and taken out of the
country before the commission publicly re
ports its lindings. In its work, the commission
would be restricted both from condemning
Iran for taking the hostages and calling for
extradition ot the shah back to Iran.
Congress OKs Olympic boycott
Washington — With renewed denunciations
ol the Soviet invasion of Atghanistan, the Se
nate voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to join the
House in urging a boycott ot the 1980 Summer
Olympic Games it they remain in Moscow.
By an 88-4 vote, the Senate adopted a resolu
tion that calls on all Americans, tourists as well
as athletes, to stay away from the Moscow
Games if Olympic officials refuse to transfer,
postpone or cancel them.
The International Olympic Committee has
indicated that the Olympics will be held in
Moscow as scheduled.
Since the resolutions adopted by the two
houses represent only the "sense of Con
gress," they have no binding effect in law.
Unlike the resolution adopted last week by
the House on a 386-12 vote, the Senate version
does not link a decision on a boycott to the
Feb. 29 deadline set by Carter for the with
drawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
Brown warns of Soviet threat
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold
Brown yesterday raised the specter that the
Soviet Union could cut the west's jugular in
wartime by sinking oil tankers with anti-ship
missiles fired from Backfire bombers already
patrolling the sea lanes.
Brown portrayed the anti-ship version of the
Backfire bomber as an even bigger threat to
shipping than submarines in a 30-page assess
ment of the world military situation sent to
Congress.
In other parts of his "posture statement,"
the defense secretary conceded that arms con
trol efforts had stalled, and that the United
States would have to keep spending more and
more billions to combat a growing Soviet arse
nal.
He said the Soviet arms buildup goes well
beyond any reasonable need for that nation's
own security, leading to speculation that the
Kremlin has adopted a "three-contingency
strategy'' that would give it the capability to
fight as many as three wars at once.
The posture statement is an attempt by the
Carter administration to convince Congress
that the Pentagon needs the $158.2 billion in
new spending authority tor tiscal 1981 —a 19.5
percent increase over fiscal 1980 — that the
president called for in his budget Monday.
The tresh attention given to the anti-ship
version comes at a time of new administration
concern over whether the United States can
protect its vital supplies ot oil in the Middle
East and elsewhere.

U.S. diplomats flee Iran
Washington — Six American diplomats who
escaped capture when the U.S. Embassy was
seized Nov. 4 slipped out of Tehran after 12
weeks in hiding, helped by the Canadian Em
bassy and an elaborate ruse of false identities
and forged documents, it was disclosed yes
terday.
The Montreal newspaper La Presse pub
lished an article in its Tuesday editions saying
some U.S. diplomats had been harbored in the
Canadian mission and were spirited out in the
previous day or two under cover of false Cana
dian passports.
U.S. and Canadian officials later confirmed
the basics of the report. State Department offi
cials said the Americans had been in "friendly
embassies," but the Canadians said all were at
the Canadian mission. This seemed to indicate
that some not originally at the Canadian mis
sion apparently gathered there later.
Ihe State Department identified the six who
escaped as Mark Lijek, a consular officer; his
wife, Cora Amburn Lijek, who was employed
by Ihe embassy as consular assistant; Roger
Anders, a consular officer; Henry Schatz, an
agricultural attache; Joseph Stafford, a consu
lar officer, and his wife, Kathleen Stafford, who
also was employed as a consular assistant. The
department did not release their hometowns.
U.S. officials in Washington, who declined
to be identified, said the six were in Europe.
They would not say where.
Khomeini supports Bani Sadr
Tehran, Iran — Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini Tuesday gave his full sup
port to president-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr,
who had been heading toward a confrontation
with the Shiite Moslem clergy over the range of
his powers.
"I ask all groups and Iranians from all walks
of life to heed the appeal of he who won the
mandate of the people," the ayatollah said in a
television and radio broadcast taped from his
hospital bed.
His statement came at a time when Bani Sadr
was being challenged by Shiite clergymen for
his post-election declaration that he wanted to
"govern alone" with no interference from "de
facto powers."
Bani Sadr, a 46-year-old Western-trained
economist, won 76 percent of the vote in Fri
day's presidential elaction, far outdistancing
Adm. Ahmad Madani and Hassan Habibi, can
didate of the Islamic Republican Party.
The IRP, party of the mullahs, or Moslem
priests, earlier Tuesday acknowledged its de
feat but said it will be vigilant against "those
who would like to divert the revolution from its
goals."
The mullahs said they would watch to make
sure that Bani Sadr does not move to augment
his powers, while the 79-year-old Khomeini is
recovering from heart trouble.
According to the Iranian constitution, Bani
Sadr still takes second place to Khomeini, who
retains control of the armed forces and can fire
the president in consultation with the parlia
ment. But the president-elect, currently fi
nance and economy minister, has made it clear
he intends to dissolve Iran's ruling Revolutio
nary Council. FHe has already begun building a
political organization in hopes of winning con
trol of the new parliament in the elections
scheduled to be held in a few weeks.

Census to reassign House seats
Washington — The massive population
movement to the West and South during the
1970s could mean a gain of eight seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives tor Western
states and six seats for the South after the 1980
Census, the Census Bureau said yesterday.
It predicted that California would pick up
two seats, giving it 45.
According to the Bureau, the South and
West will have a majority of the 435 House
seats — 224 — compared to 211 for the
Nortwestern and North Central States after the
reapportionment based on the April, 1980,
census takes effect.
The "snowbelt" states of the Northeast and
North Central region now have a combined
majority of 225 House seats to 210 for the
"sunbelt" South and West.
The region likely to lose the most is the
Northeast, particularly New York, which has
sutfered a 3.2 percent population loss during
the decade. The Census Bureau predicted that
the Northeast could lose eight seats, four of
them in New York State alone.
While the nation as a whole showed an 8.3
percent population rise in the 19705, the West
with an 18.1 percent gain, and the South with
13.9 percent, increased much faster than the
national average. The Census Bureau said the
North Central states showed only a 3.2 percent
gain, while the Northeastern states had a 0.1
percent population decline from 1970 to 1979.

edian, singer, actor and dancer, who contri
buted mightily to the mangled richness of the

netism defied the decades, died at St. John's
Hospital in Santa Monica of pneumonitis.
He was 86 and had been admitted to the
hospital Jan. 7 for treatment of the latest in a
series of illness that started with a stroke in
1972.
The bald, wizened "schnozzola," who had

His career was a virtual capsule-history of
show business in this century: saloons,
speakeasies, vaudeville, motion pictures,
radio, television .

Khomeini supports Bani Sadr
Tehran, Iran — Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini Tuesday gave his full sup
port to president-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr,
who had been heading toward a confrontation
with the Shiite Moslem clergy over the range of
his powers.
"I ask all groups and Iranians from all walks
of life to heed the appeal of he who won the
mandate of the people," the ayatollah said in a
television and radio broadcast taped from his
hospital bed.
His statement came at a time when Bani Sadr
was being challenged by Shiite clergymen for
his post-election declaration that he wanted to
"govern alone" with no interference from "de

Bani Sadr, a 46-year-old Western-trained
economist, won 76 percent of the vote in Fri
day's presidential elaction, far outdistancing
Adm. Ahmad Madani and Hassan Habibi, can
didate of the Islamic Republican Party.

Census to reassign House seats
Washington — The massive population
movement to the West and South during the
1970s could mean a gain of eight seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives tor Western
states and six seats for the South after the 1980
Census, the Census Bureau said yesterday.
It predicted that California would pick up

West will have a majority of the 435 House

"sunbelt" South and West.
The region likely to lose the most is the
Northeast, particularly New York, which has
sutfered a 3.2 percent population loss during
the decade. The Census Bureau predicted that
the Northeast could lose eight seats, four of
them in New York State alone.
While the nation as a whole showed an 8.3
percent population rise in the 19705, the West
with an 18.1 percent gain, and the South with
13.9 percent, increased much faster than the
national average. The Census Bureau said the

Moslems blame Iran for crisis
Islamabad, Pakistan — Six Moslem nations
have blamed Iran itself for the current U.S-
Iranian crisis by seizing the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran on Nov. -1 and holding 50 American
hostages.
By implication it not directly, fellow Moslem
nations told Iran at the foreign ministers' meet
ing Tuesday it should release the hostages
quickly both tor its own good and the peace ot
the world, according to sources who were in
the closed conference hall.
While many nations such as Pakistan have
informed Iran privately that it was wrong to
hold the hostages, this was the first time that
view has been put to Iran in clear and un
equivocal language by other Moslem coun
tries in a torum, though closed, where a lull
account could become public quickly.
Underscoring the criticism of Iran during the
debate, which conference chairman Agha
Shahi, foreign policy advise to Pakistan Presi
dent Mohammed /ia ul-Haq, described as
"sharp and vigorous," the foreign ministers
handed Iran a setback by watering down con
siderably a resolution it insisted on that op
posed the use of force or economic sanctions
by the United States.
The key item in the resolution was a parag
raph expressing the conferees' "sincere wish
that the Islamic republic of Iran and the U.S.A.
would resolve the outstanding problems bet
ween themselves by peaceful means." The
statement trying to bridge the gap between the
United States and Iran was inserted at the urg
ing of Pakistan.
When some delegates said they also wanted
to consider the hostage taking, sources said,
Iran replied that was purely a domestic matter
but, sources continued, some nations insisted
that it had international repercussions that
threatened other Moslem states since the Un
ited States now has a fleet sailing the Indian
Ocean and the Soviets have moved into Af
ghanistan, on Iran's borders.
While Iran's deputy foreign minister, Kamal
Kharazi, said the resolution met his country's
objectives, sources close to the delegation
said it was a far cry from what Iran expected
from the Islamic Foreign Ministers.
Iran dismissed its fellow Islamic nations who
criticized keeping the hostages as being in col
laboration with the United States.
Carter backs UN hostage plan
Washington — The Carter administration has
agreed to let United Nations officials pursue a
"package deal" that would give c ustody of the
American hostages in Tehran to an interna
tional agency like the Red Cross while a U.N.
commission investigates Iran's complaints
against deposed Shah Mohammed Re/a
Pah lav i.
Diplomatic sources said Tuesday the plan is
intended to allow Iranian President-elect
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, a moderate on the hos
tage issue, a possible way of ending the hos
tage crisis while satisfying Iranian demands
that his country's grievances against the shah
be aired publicly.
According to the sources, the plan was
worked out by U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim and members ol the Security Coun
cil with the approval ol the U.S. government.
As described by the sources, it is a reworking
ot an earlier U.N. proposal to negotiate release

of the hostages in'exchange for a commission
being named under U.N. auspices to look into
Iranian complaints against the shah and the
United States.
Under the new proposal, the sources said,
the United States tentatively is willing to allow
the hostages to be kept in Tehran under the
care and protection of the International Red
Cross or a similar agency while a U.N. commis
sion goes there and c onducts an investigation.
However, the sources continued, the hos
tages would be released and taken out of the
country before the commission publicly re
ports its lindings. In its work, the commission
would be restricted both from condemning
Iran for taking the hostages and calling for
extradition ot the shah back to Iran.
Congress OKs Olympic boycott
Washington — With renewed denunciations
ol the Soviet invasion of Atghanistan, the Se
nate voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to join the
House in urging a boycott ot the 1980 Summer
Olympic Games it they remain in Moscow.
By an 88-4 vote, the Senate adopted a resolu
tion that calls on all Americans, tourists as well
as athletes, to stay away from the Moscow
Games if Olympic officials refuse to transfer,
postpone or cancel them.
The International Olympic Committee has
indicated that the Olympics will be held in
Moscow as scheduled.
Since the resolutions adopted by the two
houses represent only the "sense of Con
gress," they have no binding effect in law.
Unlike the resolution adopted last week by
the House on a 386-12 vote, the Senate version
does not link a decision on a boycott to the
Feb. 29 deadline set by Carter for the with
drawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
Brown warns of Soviet threat
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold
Brown yesterday raised the specter that the
Soviet Union could cut the west's jugular in
wartime by sinking oil tankers with anti-ship
missiles fired from Backfire bombers already
patrolling the sea lanes.
Brown portrayed the anti-ship version of the
Backfire bomber as an even bigger threat to
shipping than submarines in a 30-page assess
ment of the world military situation sent to
Congress.
In other parts of his "posture statement,"
the defense secretary conceded that arms con
trol efforts had stalled, and that the United
States would have to keep spending more and
more billions to combat a growing Soviet arse
nal.
He said the Soviet arms buildup goes well
beyond any reasonable need for that nation's
own security, leading to speculation that the
Kremlin has adopted a "three-contingency
strategy'' that would give it the capability to
fight as many as three wars at once.
The posture statement is an attempt by the
Carter administration to convince Congress
that the Pentagon needs the $158.2 billion in
new spending authority tor tiscal 1981 —a 19.5
percent increase over fiscal 1980 — that the
president called for in his budget Monday.
The tresh attention given to the anti-ship
version comes at a time of new administration
concern over whether the United States can
protect its vital supplies ot oil in the Middle
East and elsewhere.

U.S. diplomats flee Iran
Washington — Six American diplomats who
escaped capture when the U.S. Embassy was
seized Nov. 4 slipped out of Tehran after 12
weeks in hiding, helped by the Canadian Em
bassy and an elaborate ruse of false identities
and forged documents, it was disclosed yes
terday.
The Montreal newspaper La Presse pub

some U.S. diplomats had been harbored in the

previous day or two under cover of false Cana

Carter backs UN hostage plan
Washington — The Carter administration has
agreed to let United Nations officials pursue a
"package deal" that would give c ustody of the
American hostages in Tehran to an interna

commission investigates Iran's complaints
against deposed Shah Mohammed Re/a

Diplomatic sources said Tuesday the plan is
intended to allow Iranian President-elect
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, a moderate on the hos

that his country's grievances against the shah
be aired publicly.
According to the sources, the plan was
worked out by U.N. Secretary General Kurt

As described by the sources, it is a reworking
ot an earlier U.N. proposal to negotiate release

the United States tentatively is willing to allow
the hostages to be kept in Tehran under the

However, the sources continued, the hos

Congress OKs Olympic boycott
Washington — With renewed denunciations
ol the Soviet invasion of Atghanistan, the Se

Moscow as scheduled.
Since the resolutions adopted by the two

Unlike the resolution adopted last week by
the House on a 386-12 vote, the Senate version
does not link a decision on a boycott to the

Brown warns of Soviet threat
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold
Brown yesterday raised the specter that the
Soviet Union could cut the west's jugular in
wartime by sinking oil tankers with anti-ship
missiles fired from Backfire bombers already
patrolling the sea lanes.
Brown portrayed the anti-ship version of the
Backfire bomber as an even bigger threat to
shipping than submarines in a 30-page assess
ment of the world military situation sent to
Congress.
In other parts of his "posture statement,"
the defense secretary conceded that arms con
trol efforts had stalled, and that the United
States would have to keep spending more and
more billions to combat a growing Soviet arse
nal.
He said the Soviet arms buildup goes well
beyond any reasonable need for that nation's
own security, leading to speculation that the
Kremlin has adopted a "three-contingency
strategy'' that would give it the capability to
fight as many as three wars at once.
The posture statement is an attempt by the
Carter administration to convince Congress
that the Pentagon needs the $158.2 billion in
new spending authority tor tiscal 1981 —a 19.5
percent increase over fiscal 1980 — that the
president called for in his budget Monday.
The tresh attention given to the anti-ship

U.S. diplomats flee Iran
Washington — Six American diplomats who
escaped capture when the U.S. Embassy was
seized Nov. 4 slipped out of Tehran after 12
weeks in hiding, helped by the Canadian Em
bassy and an elaborate ruse of false identities
and forged documents, it was disclosed yes
terday.
The Montreal newspaper La Presse pub
lished an article in its Tuesday editions saying
some U.S. diplomats had been harbored in the
Canadian mission and were spirited out in the
previous day or two under cover of false Cana
dian passports.
U.S. and Canadian officials later confirmed
the basics of the report. State Department offi
cials said the Americans had been in "friendly
embassies," but the Canadians said all were at
the Canadian mission. This seemed to indicate
that some not originally at the Canadian mis

Ihe State Department identified the six who
escaped as Mark Lijek, a consular officer; his
wife, Cora Amburn Lijek, who was employed
by Ihe embassy as consular assistant; Roger
Anders, a consular officer; Henry Schatz, an
agricultural attache; Joseph Stafford, a consu

also was employed as a consular assistant. The
department did not release their hometowns.
U.S. officials in Washington, who declined

Khomeini supports Bani Sadr
Tehran, Iran — Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini Tuesday gave his full sup
port to president-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr,
who had been heading toward a confrontation
with the Shiite Moslem clergy over the range of
his powers.
"I ask all groups and Iranians from all walks
of life to heed the appeal of he who won the
mandate of the people," the ayatollah said in a
television and radio broadcast taped from his
hospital bed.
His statement came at a time when Bani Sadr
was being challenged by Shiite clergymen for
his post-election declaration that he wanted to
"govern alone" with no interference from "de
facto powers."
Bani Sadr, a 46-year-old Western-trained
economist, won 76 percent of the vote in Fri
day's presidential elaction, far outdistancing
Adm. Ahmad Madani and Hassan Habibi, can
didate of the Islamic Republican Party.
The IRP, party of the mullahs, or Moslem
priests, earlier Tuesday acknowledged its de
feat but said it will be vigilant against "those
who would like to divert the revolution from its
goals."
The mullahs said they would watch to make
sure that Bani Sadr does not move to augment
his powers, while the 79-year-old Khomeini is
recovering from heart trouble.
According to the Iranian constitution, Bani
Sadr still takes second place to Khomeini, who
retains control of the armed forces and can fire
the president in consultation with the parlia
ment. But the president-elect, currently fi
nance and economy minister, has made it clear
he intends to dissolve Iran's ruling Revolutio
nary Council. FHe has already begun building a
political organization in hopes of winning con
trol of the new parliament in the elections
scheduled to be held in a few weeks.

Census to reassign House seats
Washington — The massive population
movement to the West and South during the
1970s could mean a gain of eight seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives tor Western
states and six seats for the South after the 1980
Census, the Census Bureau said yesterday.
It predicted that California would pick up
two seats, giving it 45.
According to the Bureau, the South and
West will have a majority of the 435 House
seats — 224 — compared to 211 for the
Nortwestern and North Central States after the
reapportionment based on the April, 1980,
census takes effect.
The "snowbelt" states of the Northeast and
North Central region now have a combined
majority of 225 House seats to 210 for the
"sunbelt" South and West.
The region likely to lose the most is the
Northeast, particularly New York, which has
sutfered a 3.2 percent population loss during
the decade. The Census Bureau predicted that
the Northeast could lose eight seats, four of
them in New York State alone.
While the nation as a whole showed an 8.3
percent population rise in the 19705, the West
with an 18.1 percent gain, and the South with
13.9 percent, increased much faster than the
national average. The Census Bureau said the
North Central states showed only a 3.2 percent
gain, while the Northeastern states had a 0.1
percent population decline from 1970 to 1979.

Ihe State Department identified the six who
escaped as Mark Lijek, a consular officer; his
wife, Cora Amburn Lijek, who was employed
by Ihe embassy as consular assistant; Roger
Anders, a consular officer; Henry Schatz, an
agricultural attache; Joseph Stafford, a consu

also was employed as a consular assistant. The
department did not release their hometowns.
U.S. officials in Washington, who declined

They would not say where.
Khomeini supports Bani Sadr
Tehran, Iran — Iranian leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini Tuesday gave his full sup
port to president-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr,
who had been heading toward a confrontation
with the Shiite Moslem clergy over the range of
his powers.
"I ask all groups and Iranians from all walks
of life to heed the appeal of he who won the
mandate of the people," the ayatollah said in a
television and radio broadcast taped from his
hospital bed.
His statement came at a time when Bani Sadr
was being challenged by Shiite clergymen for
his post-election declaration that he wanted to
"govern alone" with no interference from "de
facto powers."
Bani Sadr, a 46-year-old Western-trained
economist, won 76 percent of the vote in Fri
day's presidential elaction, far outdistancing
Adm. Ahmad Madani and Hassan Habibi, can
didate of the Islamic Republican Party.
The IRP, party of the mullahs, or Moslem
priests, earlier Tuesday acknowledged its de
feat but said it will be vigilant against "those
who would like to divert the revolution from its
goals."
The mullahs said they would watch to make
sure that Bani Sadr does not move to augment
his powers, while the 79-year-old Khomeini is
recovering from heart trouble.
According to the Iranian constitution, Bani
Sadr still takes second place to Khomeini, who
retains control of the armed forces and can fire
the president in consultation with the parlia
ment. But the president-elect, currently fi
nance and economy minister, has made it clear
he intends to dissolve Iran's ruling Revolutio
nary Council. FHe has already begun building a
political organization in hopes of winning con
trol of the new parliament in the elections
scheduled to be held in a few weeks.

Census to reassign House seats
Washington — The massive population
movement to the West and South during the
1970s could mean a gain of eight seats in the
U.S. House of Representatives tor Western
states and six seats for the South after the 1980
Census, the Census Bureau said yesterday.
It predicted that California would pick up
two seats, giving it 45.
According to the Bureau, the South and
West will have a majority of the 435 House
seats — 224 — compared to 211 for the
Nortwestern and North Central States after the
reapportionment based on the April, 1980,
census takes effect.
The "snowbelt" states of the Northeast and
North Central region now have a combined
majority of 225 House seats to 210 for the
"sunbelt" South and West.
The region likely to lose the most is the
Northeast, particularly New York, which has
sutfered a 3.2 percent population loss during
the decade. The Census Bureau predicted that
the Northeast could lose eight seats, four of
them in New York State alone.
While the nation as a whole showed an 8.3
percent population rise in the 19705, the West
with an 18.1 percent gain, and the South with
13.9 percent, increased much faster than the
national average. The Census Bureau said the
North Central states showed only a 3.2 percent
gain, while the Northeastern states had a 0.1
percent population decline from 1970 to 1979.

Moslems blame Iran for crisis
Islamabad, Pakistan — Six Moslem nations
have blamed Iran itself for the current U.S-
Iranian crisis by seizing the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran on Nov. -1 and holding 50 American
hostages.
By implication it not directly, fellow Moslem
nations told Iran at the foreign ministers' meet
ing Tuesday it should release the hostages
quickly both tor its own good and the peace ot
the world, according to sources who were in
the closed conference hall.
While many nations such as Pakistan have
informed Iran privately that it was wrong to
hold the hostages, this was the first time that
view has been put to Iran in clear and un
equivocal language by other Moslem coun
tries in a torum, though closed, where a lull
account could become public quickly.
Underscoring the criticism of Iran during the
debate, which conference chairman Agha
Shahi, foreign policy advise to Pakistan Presi
dent Mohammed /ia ul-Haq, described as
"sharp and vigorous," the foreign ministers
handed Iran a setback by watering down con
siderably a resolution it insisted on that op
posed the use of force or economic sanctions
by the United States.
The key item in the resolution was a parag
raph expressing the conferees' "sincere wish
that the Islamic republic of Iran and the U.S.A.
would resolve the outstanding problems bet
ween themselves by peaceful means." The
statement trying to bridge the gap between the
United States and Iran was inserted at the urg
ing of Pakistan.
When some delegates said they also wanted
to consider the hostage taking, sources said,
Iran replied that was purely a domestic matter
but, sources continued, some nations insisted
that it had international repercussions that
threatened other Moslem states since the Un
ited States now has a fleet sailing the Indian
Ocean and the Soviets have moved into Af
ghanistan, on Iran's borders.
While Iran's deputy foreign minister, Kamal
Kharazi, said the resolution met his country's
objectives, sources close to the delegation
said it was a far cry from what Iran expected
from the Islamic Foreign Ministers.
Iran dismissed its fellow Islamic nations who
criticized keeping the hostages as being in col
laboration with the United States.
Carter backs UN hostage plan
Washington — The Carter administration has
agreed to let United Nations officials pursue a
"package deal" that would give c ustody of the
American hostages in Tehran to an interna
tional agency like the Red Cross while a U.N.
commission investigates Iran's complaints
against deposed Shah Mohammed Re/a
Pah lav i.
Diplomatic sources said Tuesday the plan is
intended to allow Iranian President-elect
Abolhassan Bani Sadr, a moderate on the hos
tage issue, a possible way of ending the hos
tage crisis while satisfying Iranian demands
that his country's grievances against the shah
be aired publicly.
According to the sources, the plan was
worked out by U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim and members ol the Security Coun
cil with the approval ol the U.S. government.
As described by the sources, it is a reworking
ot an earlier U.N. proposal to negotiate release

of the hostages in'exchange for a commission
being named under U.N. auspices to look into
Iranian complaints against the shah and the
United States.
Under the new proposal, the sources said,
the United States tentatively is willing to allow
the hostages to be kept in Tehran under the
care and protection of the International Red
Cross or a similar agency while a U.N. commis
sion goes there and c onducts an investigation.
However, the sources continued, the hos
tages would be released and taken out of the
country before the commission publicly re
ports its lindings. In its work, the commission
would be restricted both from condemning
Iran for taking the hostages and calling for
extradition ot the shah back to Iran.
Congress OKs Olympic boycott
Washington — With renewed denunciations
ol the Soviet invasion of Atghanistan, the Se
nate voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to join the
House in urging a boycott ot the 1980 Summer
Olympic Games it they remain in Moscow.
By an 88-4 vote, the Senate adopted a resolu
tion that calls on all Americans, tourists as well
as athletes, to stay away from the Moscow
Games if Olympic officials refuse to transfer,
postpone or cancel them.
The International Olympic Committee has
indicated that the Olympics will be held in
Moscow as scheduled.
Since the resolutions adopted by the two
houses represent only the "sense of Con
gress," they have no binding effect in law.
Unlike the resolution adopted last week by
the House on a 386-12 vote, the Senate version
does not link a decision on a boycott to the
Feb. 29 deadline set by Carter for the with
drawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
Brown warns of Soviet threat
Washington — Defense Secretary Harold
Brown yesterday raised the specter that the
Soviet Union could cut the west's jugular in
wartime by sinking oil tankers with anti-ship
missiles fired from Backfire bombers already
patrolling the sea lanes.
Brown portrayed the anti-ship version of the
Backfire bomber as an even bigger threat to
shipping than submarines in a 30-page assess
ment of the world military situation sent to
Congress.
In other parts of his "posture statement,"
the defense secretary conceded that arms con
trol efforts had stalled, and that the United
States would have to keep spending more and
more billions to combat a growing Soviet arse
nal.
He said the Soviet arms buildup goes well
beyond any reasonable need for that nation's
own security, leading to speculation that the
Kremlin has adopted a "three-contingency
strategy'' that would give it the capability to
fight as many as three wars at once.
The posture statement is an attempt by the
Carter administration to convince Congress
that the Pentagon needs the $158.2 billion in
new spending authority tor tiscal 1981 —a 19.5
percent increase over fiscal 1980 — that the
president called for in his budget Monday.
The tresh attention given to the anti-ship
version comes at a time of new administration
concern over whether the United States can
protect its vital supplies ot oil in the Middle
East and elsewhere.

U.S. diplomats flee Iran
Washington — Six American diplomats who
escaped capture when the U.S. Embassy was
seized Nov. 4 slipped out of Tehran after 12
weeks in hiding, helped by the Canadian Em
bassy and an elaborate ruse of false identities
and forged documents, it was disclosed yes
terday.
The Montreal newspaper La Presse pub
lished an article in its Tuesday editions saying
some U.S. diplomats had been harbored in the
Canadian mission and were spirited out in the
previous day or two under cover of false Cana
dian passports.
U.S. and Canadian officials later confirmed
the basics of the report. State Department offi
cials said the Americans had been in "friendly
embassies," but the Canadians said all were at
the Canadian mission. This seemed to indicate
that some not originally at the Canadian mis
sion apparently gathered there later.
Ihe State Department identified the six who
escaped as Mark Lijek, a consular officer; his
wife, Cora Amburn Lijek, who was employed
by Ihe embassy as consular assistant; Roger
Anders, a consular officer; Henry Schatz, an
agricultural attache; Joseph Stafford, a consu
lar officer, and his wife, Kathleen Stafford, who
also was employed as a consular assistant. The
department did not release their hometowns.
U.S. officials in Washington, who declined
