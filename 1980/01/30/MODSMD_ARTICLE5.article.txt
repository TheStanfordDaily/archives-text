# Student group backs Bush for president
## 
### Mike Vaska 
The newest in a series of several
presidential campaign groups here,
Stanford Students for George Bush
attracted about 75 students to its first
informational meeting Monday
night.
Two members of the state Bush or
ganization, Tony Peet, coordinator
for Northern California and Harry
McGrath, Santa Clara County chair
man, addressed the gathering on the
possibilities and problems that the
Bush campaign will face in this state.
Peet cited the existence of the
winner-take-all primary for the Re
publican nomination as a major obs
tacle to an extensive and successful
campaign in California. Under the
system, the Republican candidate
who gets the most votes in the June
primary will take all of California's
168 delegates to the COP conven
tion.
Ronald Reagan is the current favo
rite to win the primary.
A state initiative to eliminate the
winner-take-all primary failed to
make the )une ballot by 8000 signa
tures, Peet said. It is being contested
in court and there is the possibility
that it may get on the )une ballot, he
added.
Even if the present system re
mains, Bush "might have the last
laugh" and win the California prim

nry, thus getting all the delegate
votes, Peet said. He cited the lowa
straw poll in which Bush beat
Reagan, as an indication that the
front-runner can be stopped.
Bush's California challenge will be
a "no trills" campaign at least for the
time being, with most of his financial
resources flowing into the early East
ern contests, Peet said. It will resem
ble a "war with limited resources
when the opposition (Reagan) has
tanks," he said.
The Stanford organization should
concentrate on registering voters,
raising money and attracting media
attention in its early stages, Peet said.
He suggested that Stanford students
hold rallies, staff an information ta
ble, and have speakers come to the
campus to support Bush.
Peet said Bush "almost guarantees
that he will speak here," probably in
mid-March or early April.
Adam Newar, the freshman who
organized the first meeting, said he is
surprised at the turnout. The com
mittee has not yet selected a chair
man.
Newar worked on John Connally's
presidential campaign this summer,
but switched to Bush when he be
came disillusioned with the former
Texas governor.
There will be an organizational
meeting on Feb. 13 to formally set up
the committee, he said.
