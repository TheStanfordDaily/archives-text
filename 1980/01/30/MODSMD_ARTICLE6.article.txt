## Panama 'obscures' shah policy 
### 
flw Washington Posl
Panama City â€” I he Panama
nian government, sixth host to
the exiled shah ot Iran, ap
pears anxious to obscure its
policy towards the deposed
monarch and has thrown up a
smokescreen ot ambiguous
legal language, contusing
statements about his status
quo and reports ot high level
phone calls and secret mis
sions between Panama and
Iran.
Having granted the Shah
political asylum here live
weeks ago, the government
now retuses to st.ite categori
cally whether or not it will ac
cept Iran's demand that the
shah be extradited to lace trial
in Iran.
Instead, it insists on lollow
inga legal process that eventu
ally will he sub jet t to a political
decision by the executive, and
that decision, in the view ol
many Panamanians inside and
outside the government, is that
Panama does not plan to extra
dite the shah.
Diplomats believe that
Panama's move serves to avoid
further Iru tion with Iran, it
buys time and oilers a potential
lace-saving device that might
help to enable Iran's incoming
government to release the hos
tages.
U.S. counsel?
Opposition lawyers who
have been poring over the dip
lomatic exchanges between
Panama C ity and Tehran are
convinced that these are the
result ol American counseling.
U.S. officials here deny any
special knowledge or involve

ment in the case.
Panama apparently has be
come entangled in the con
troversy over the shah because
ol its need tor U.S. support lor
both the recovery ol its depre
ssed economy and the im
plementation ol the new
Panama Canal treaties in which
Panama teels the United States
is dragging its teet.
Although Panamanian
strongman Hrig. Cen. Omar
Torrijos got a U.S. image ol
being an anti-American letlist,
his government has rallied
around the United States in re
cent months.
No surprise
Farly last year, as the shah
was in need ol exile, Torrijos
sent word privately that he
would be welcome here.
Well-placed sources here
said that "the shah had a stand
ing invitation here .ill along.
His coming here was no sud
den decision Irom Panama.'"
Panamanian President Aris
tides Koyo has at knowledges!
speaking twice by telephone to
Iranian Foreign Minister
Sadegh (ihotb/adeh, who an
nounced last week that Koyo
had said the shah was under
arrest. Persons c lose to Koyo
said Cihotb/adeh "exaggerated
and was clearly whipping il up
for his election campaign."
A Panamanian spokesman
has repeatedly denied that the
shall was under arrest.
'Diplomatic warning'
Iran made use ol a Panama
nian law that s.iys ,i "diplomatic
warning" ol an impending ex
tradition request requires ar
rest ol the person concerned.

Koyo then cabled Tehran
that llie shah "remains under
the care ot the security au
thorities" and that Panama had
"adopted precautionary mea
sures pertinent to his stay."
A person tamiliar with the
proceedings said, "Ambiguity
lias an important lunction in
diplomacy."
On the one hand, lawyers
here argue, Panama has a way
out, because its law forbids ex
tradition of a loreigner tor
political reasons or it the per
son will tat e a death penalty at
home.
On the other hand, the gov
ernment is aware that Panama,
with its many embassies ab
road, its canal and numerous
ships carrying the Panamanian
ilag ot convenience, is vulner
able to an angry Iran. Panama
nian students have been prom
ised in Iran they will get copies
of the documents detailing the
shah's alleged crimes, which
will be sent to the Panamanian
government.
