Tokyo — U.S. Ambassador Mike Mansiield
warned Monday thai |apan s rising auto exports
to Hit' United Slates constitute a "c lear and pre
sent danger" lo U.S. Japan relations.
"All ol the ingredients oi an explosion are
there," he lold .1 luncheon meeting at the lapan
National I'ress Club.
To loreslall protectionist curbs on imports,
Mansiield urged lapan's big two automakers,
Toyota and Nissan, to tollow Honda's lead m
establishing manufacturing lacilities 111 the Un
tied Slates. He said Toyota sold 500,000 velm i< •-
in the United Slates last year while Nissan sold
400,000, and added: "I would say there is plenty
ol room lor them lo (produce) in the United
States on the order ol 200,000 units, or up lo
250,(KM) units a year."
On )an. 11, Honda announced that a feasibil
ity study to build an auto plant 111 Ohio lo pro
duce 120,000 units a year had entered "a final
stage" and that construction ol a plant to employ
about 2000 workers could begin belore the end
ol Ibis year.
While both loyota and Nissan have said (hey
are studying the possibility of establishing
American passenger-car plants, neither lirm has
made any delinite commitment to do so.
U.S. labor questioned
Privately, top lapanese auto officials have ex
pressed concern about whether unionized
American labor could duplicate the quality ol
manufacture I hey believe they at hieve in plants
in lapan.
Mansfield's comments added a note of t risis
lo earlier statements made by Reubin Askew,
the former Florida governor who assumed the
post o! President jimmy Carter's special trade
representative in November.
like Askew, Mansfield said investment was
needed to forestall protectionist legislation in
Congress. But unlike Askew, the ambassador
warned that action was needed immediately.

"I hope thi' big Japanese c ompanies are giving
some thought to the seriousness of the situa
tion, because 11 something is not done —and I
do not utter these words lightly — you are going
to tind in this campaign year a great swell lor
protectionist legislation which will be directed
against those who import too much, too
quickly," he said.
Planls closing
Mansiield pointed out that U.S. automakers
are 1 'osing plants, putting as many as 200,000
woikers out ol work while foreign makers,
largely lapanese, look 22 percent ol the U.S.
aulo market last year "rather than the usual lb to
Ifi percent."
lapanese exports to the United Slates, he said,
increased by 10 percent in 1978 and increased
again last year by nine percent.
"The projection lor this year even exceeds
that ligure," he added. Mansiield said a 22 per
cent share ol the U.S. market for foreign autos
constituted "an exorbitant rate," which invest
ment 111 U.S. production lac ilities would reduce.
"I hope this t lear and present danger lot pro
tectionism) would be laced up to with under
standing on both sides," Mansiield said, "and
that this difficulty, which is now economic,
would not become a political issue.
"Hie strength ol the relationship between our
two t ounlries is too important to allow a matter
like this to gel in the way."
Hgures compiled by the U.S.-Japan Trade
Council in Washington, a lobbying and
inlormation-gathering organization lor the
lapanese government, showed that 1.76 million
Japanese autos or I6.f> percent ol all cars sold
in the United Slates — were sold in the Ameri
can market last year, $0.5 percent more than in
197 H.
In 1978 , retail sales ot Japanese autos in the
United Stales declined by 2.2 percent irom the
previous year and constituted only 12 percent of
all U.S. auto sales.
