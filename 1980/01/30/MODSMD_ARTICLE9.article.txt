Thirty-tour of the world's 41 Is
lamic nations yesterday de
manded the immediate, un
conditional withdrawal ol all
Soviet troops irom Afghanistan
and suspended Afghanistan's
membership in their organiza
tion.
Foreign ministers of Ihe 54
nations plus the Palestine Lib
eration Organization also
urged boycotting the Moscow
Olympics, breaking relations

with Afghanistan, solidarity
with the Afghan Moslem re
bels, aid to Afghan relugees
and helping Afghanistan's
Moslem neighbors withstand
any threat to their security.
Seven members of the Or
ganization of the Islamic Con
ference boycotted the meeting
in Islamabad: Afghanistan,
Syria, South Yemen, Uganda,
Upper Volta, Guinea Bissau
and Egypt, which has been os
tracized by most Islamic coun
tries because ol its peace treaty
with Israel.
But President Anwar Sadat ot
Egypt, militarily the most pow
erful of Islam's leaders, en
dorsed the Carter Doctrine and
said Egypt's "11111 facilities"
would be available to U.S.
forces il they had to defend any
of the Persian Gulf countries.
Following adoption ol the
resolution condemn.ng the
Soviet action in Afghanistan,
the foreign ministers took up
an anti-American resolution
dealing with "toreign pressure
being everted against Iran," a
general resolution "on foreign

pressures being exerted
against the Moslem coun
tries," another anti-Soviet re
solution on "foreign inter
ference in the Horn of Africa,
and the status of Jerusalem and
Palestine.
The conference took no ac
tion on a proposal by President
Mohammed /ia ul-Haq of
Pakistan for joint defense ac
tion by the Islamic countries.
Kassim /ahiri, the assistant
secretary-general of the or
ganization, said the suggestion
needed detailed consideration
before it could be debated.
The Soviet Union has sent up
to 100,000 troops into At
ghanistan to help the pro-
Soviet Afghan government in
its tight against anti
communist Moslem rebels.
The Afghan resolution re
iterates that Soviet troops
should retrain from acts of op
pression and tyranny against
the Afghan people and their
struggling sons . . . and urges
all countries and peoples to
secure the Soviet withdrawal
through all possible means."
