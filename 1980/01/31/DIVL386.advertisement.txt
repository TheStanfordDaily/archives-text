[ Over the past several years, Stanford students have reduced
electrical consumption by 15-20 percent. This represents a savings of
$50,000 or 100,000 gallons of oil.
By unplugging waterbeds, refrigerators, clocks and other electrical
items during Christmas break students saved $2,000 or 40,000 lbs of
coal.
Within the next year, the Energy Conservation Center will spend over
one million dollars from a federally funded loan for energy conservation
projects in dorms and row houses. These projects will save about
$200,000 annually.
Through these combined conservation efforts there has been
considerable energy savings, but energy costs are predicted to
increase 300 percent within the next five years.
The Energy Conservation Center is grateful for student conservation
efforts and we encourage everyone to eliminate energy waste at
Stanford.
