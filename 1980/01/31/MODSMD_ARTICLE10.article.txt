## Misguided policy 
### 
Bad as this country's energy
crisis is, governmental energy
policy is far worse. With oil
supplies dwindling, solar
power uncertain, fusion unde
veloped and nuclear power po
tentially unsafe, it appears that
but one remaining option can
solve the shortage: conserva
tion. But governmental plan
ners have given only lip service
to conservation, and for the
most part they ignore it.
Conservation is ignored be
cause it is misunderstood.
People cannot simply stop driv
ing, because the vast majority
of all auto trips are job-related
and therefore essential; plea
sure driving has, in the past
several months, been strictly
curtailed.
If the government is going to
make its advice to conserve
be taken seriously, it will have
to back up that advice with
substantial subsidy for build
ing an alternative to the private
auto: public transportation.
But this commitment has not
been made.
President jimmy Carter's
energy policy, for example, al
locates $88 billion for synthetic
fuel development and a scant
$10 billion for mass transit.
Synthetic fuel production
would probably harm the envi
ronment. It would, for a li
mited amount of time, give us
more gasoline.
Therefore, this program
does not attack the central
problem, which is America's
dependence on gas. It merely
forestalls for a decade or two
the ultimate energy crisis,
when our supply of both
synthetic and natural gasolines
is exhausted.
Ten billion dollars, on the
other hand, is about enough to
build 100 miles of subway
track, hardly enough to cure
the transit mess in our auto
dependent urban areas. Only
when the statistics are re
versed, when $88 billion is
spent for transit and $10 billion
is spent for synfuels, will this
country come up with a real,
lasting solution to its energy
problem.
To my mind, Americans are
ready for more efficient mass

transit. The idea that Ameri
cans will never get out of their
cars and into buses has been
proven a myth. For example,
bus ridership in Los Angeles,
often termed the nation's most
auto-centered city, climbed
about 25 percent during the
May-june '79 gas crunch, and
this high level of patronage has
been sustained despite the
gradual easingof tuel supplies.
If the country has ever had
an opportunity to build mean
ingtul, permanent public
transportation, this is it. furth
ermore, efficient transporta
tion would help revitalize de
cayed downtown areas.
But the federal Urban Mass
Transit Administration (UMTA)
does not appear to provide a
coherent, logical transporta
tion policy. Huge sums are
spent in some cities, while
others are neglected.
Washington, D.C.'s Metio
subway, for example, will have
a total price tag of $7 billion
plus. That amount could build
"starter" rail lines in six or
seven cities or could improve
innumerable bus systems. By
concentrating so much money
on one district, UMTA has fa
vored two million Americans at
the expense of the other 200
million.
Furthermore, transportation
policy in the United States
smacks of regionalism. Aside
from BART, no newly built
UMTA project is west of the
Atlantic seaboard. Miami, At
lanta, Washington, Baltimore
and Buffalo all have rail sys
tems under construction. De
troit, Los Angeles and Hous
ton, all with larger popula
tions, have been neglected.
Such regional prejudices have
got to be put aside, as the
energy crisis is truly a national
problem.
To find a culprit for the con
tinued energy dilemma here,
you needn't look so far as the
Middle fast. But you'll have to
look farther than the car in
your driveway. The problem, I
think, lies in Washington, and
it will be solved or inflamed
there.

Bad as this country's energy
crisis is, governmental energy
policy is far worse. With oil
supplies dwindling, solar
power uncertain, fusion unde
veloped and nuclear power po
tentially unsafe, it appears that
but one remaining option can
solve the shortage: conserva
tion. But governmental plan
ners have given only lip service
to conservation, and for the
most part they ignore it.
Conservation is ignored be
cause it is misunderstood.
People cannot simply stop driv
ing, because the vast majority
of all auto trips are job-related
and therefore essential; plea
sure driving has, in the past
several months, been strictly
curtailed.
If the government is going to
make its advice to conserve
be taken seriously, it will have
to back up that advice with
substantial subsidy for build
ing an alternative to the private
auto: public transportation.
But this commitment has not
been made.
President jimmy Carter's
energy policy, for example, al
locates $88 billion for synthetic
fuel development and a scant
$10 billion for mass transit.
Synthetic fuel production
would probably harm the envi
ronment. It would, for a li
mited amount of time, give us
more gasoline.
Therefore, this program
does not attack the central
problem, which is America's
dependence on gas. It merely
forestalls for a decade or two
the ultimate energy crisis,
when our supply of both
synthetic and natural gasolines
is exhausted.
Ten billion dollars, on the
other hand, is about enough to
build 100 miles of subway
track, hardly enough to cure
the transit mess in our auto
dependent urban areas. Only
when the statistics are re
versed, when $88 billion is
spent for transit and $10 billion
is spent for synfuels, will this
country come up with a real,
lasting solution to its energy
problem.
To my mind, Americans are
ready for more efficient mass

transit. The idea that Ameri
cans will never get out of their
cars and into buses has been
proven a myth. For example,
bus ridership in Los Angeles,
often termed the nation's most
auto-centered city, climbed
about 25 percent during the
May-june '79 gas crunch, and
this high level of patronage has
been sustained despite the
gradual easingof tuel supplies.
If the country has ever had
an opportunity to build mean
ingtul, permanent public
transportation, this is it. furth
ermore, efficient transporta
tion would help revitalize de
cayed downtown areas.
But the federal Urban Mass
Transit Administration (UMTA)
does not appear to provide a
coherent, logical transporta
tion policy. Huge sums are
spent in some cities, while
others are neglected.
Washington, D.C.'s Metio
subway, for example, will have
a total price tag of $7 billion
plus. That amount could build
"starter" rail lines in six or
seven cities or could improve
innumerable bus systems. By
concentrating so much money
on one district, UMTA has fa
vored two million Americans at
the expense of the other 200
million.
Furthermore, transportation
policy in the United States
smacks of regionalism. Aside
from BART, no newly built
UMTA project is west of the
Atlantic seaboard. Miami, At
lanta, Washington, Baltimore
and Buffalo all have rail sys
tems under construction. De
troit, Los Angeles and Hous
ton, all with larger popula
tions, have been neglected.
Such regional prejudices have
got to be put aside, as the
energy crisis is truly a national
problem.
To find a culprit for the con
tinued energy dilemma here,
you needn't look so far as the
Middle fast. But you'll have to
look farther than the car in
your driveway. The problem, I
think, lies in Washington, and
it will be solved or inflamed
there.
