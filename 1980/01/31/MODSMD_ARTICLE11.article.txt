## How deep is the world oil 'well'? 
### 
In the energy debate in this
country, one critical assump
tion has been largely over
looked — the assumption re
garding the availability of un
discovered oil. After all the talk
about the windfall profits tax
and deregulation, wouldn't it
be ironic if there weren't much
more oil out there to find?
To date, the world has con
sumed approximately 400 bill
ion barrels of oil, and it cur
rently burns about 19 billion
per year. Another 600 billion
barrels are classified as proven
or probable reserves, though
only a fraction (30-50 percent)
is extractable, even using sec
ondary or tertiary recovery
techniques.
Most experts claim that
another 1000 billion (1 trillion)
barrels remain to be disco
vered. The consensus view of 2
trillion barrels is the sum of
these proven, probable and
potential reserves.
If the world is able to main
tain current consumption
rates, these figures imply that
only about 12 years of reserves
ana 33 years of ultimately re
coverable resources remain, at
40 percent recovery. If global
consumption rises, there's

even less time left.
Recently, however, another
school of thought within the
geologic community has main
tained that closer to 5 trillion
barrels (105 years'worth) re
main undiscovered.
Moreover, they claim that
these resources are widely dis
persed, as opposed to concen
trated in a few key countries.
If the latter view is correct,
the economic, political and so
cial implications for all nations
are enormous. If lesser
developed countries can look
forward to finding indigenous
oil resources, they need not
plan on the burden of continu
ing oil payments deficits, and
short-term deficits imply a
dramatically different de
velopment strategy than per
petual deficits.
If there are vastly greater re
serves than previously esti
mated, the need to switch to
alternative and renewable
energy supplies is less compel
ling.
The two camps are com
monly referred to as "Nehr
ing" and "Grossling," after
their major proponents.
Richard Nehring, a researcher
with the RAND Corporation,

spearheads the 2 trillion barrel
school. In "The Outlook for
Conventional Petroleum Re
sources," he points out that
whenever potential oil regions
(provinces) have been
explored, the giant and
super-giant fields (those con
taining greater than 500 million
and 5 billion barrels, respec
tively) have been discovered
early in the exploration pro
cess.
Furthermore, the vast major
ity (over 80 percent) of the
world's consumed, proven and
probable reserves are in these
two field types.
In addition, Nehring indi
cates that the most significant
caches of oil are detectable
without actually drilling (e.g.
by surface and seismic map
ping), and that largely undril
led areas (South America, Af
rica and much of Asia) have
been sufficiently explored to
rule out the possibility of a
large number of undiscovered
giant or super-giant fields
there.
On the other side are the
maverick views of Bernardo
Grossling, a geologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey. In his
essay "Window on Oil."

Crossling points out that find
ing rates for oil in South
America and Africa have ex
ceeded those in the United
States in recent years, even
though many more holes con
tinue to be drilled in the United
States.
Crossling claims that the ul
timate recovery per square
mile of prospective area in the
less explored areas should be
in the range of that for the
more explored areas, and
places ultimately recoverable
crude oil reserves in the 4-6
trillion barrel range.
It will probably take many
years and dollars to determine
whether the viewpoint of
Nehring or Crossling is closer
to the truth. In the meantime,
however, we cannot afford to
take a bet on Crossling. We
must redouble our efforts to
develop renewable energy re
sources and make real com
mitments to conserve the fossil
fuels we think we know we
have.

If the latter view is correct,
the economic, political and so

short-term deficits imply a
dramatically different de
velopment strategy than per

The two camps are com

their major proponents.
Richard Nehring, a researcher
with the RAND Corporation,

spearheads the 2 trillion barrel
school. In "The Outlook for
Conventional Petroleum Re
sources," he points out that
whenever potential oil regions
(provinces) have been
explored, the giant and
super-giant fields (those con
taining greater than 500 million
and 5 billion barrels, respec
tively) have been discovered
early in the exploration pro
cess.
Furthermore, the vast major
ity (over 80 percent) of the
world's consumed, proven and
probable reserves are in these
two field types.
In addition, Nehring indi
cates that the most significant
caches of oil are detectable
without actually drilling (e.g.
by surface and seismic map
ping), and that largely undril
led areas (South America, Af
rica and much of Asia) have
been sufficiently explored to
rule out the possibility of a
large number of undiscovered
giant or super-giant fields
there.
On the other side are the
maverick views of Bernardo
Grossling, a geologist with the
U.S. Geological Survey. In his
essay "Window on Oil."

Crossling points out that find
ing rates for oil in South
America and Africa have ex
ceeded those in the United
States in recent years, even
though many more holes con
tinue to be drilled in the United
States.
Crossling claims that the ul
timate recovery per square
mile of prospective area in the
less explored areas should be
in the range of that for the
more explored areas, and
places ultimately recoverable
crude oil reserves in the 4-6
trillion barrel range.
It will probably take many
years and dollars to determine
whether the viewpoint of
Nehring or Crossling is closer
to the truth. In the meantime,
however, we cannot afford to
take a bet on Crossling. We
must redouble our efforts to
develop renewable energy re
sources and make real com
mitments to conserve the fossil
fuels we think we know we
have.

In the energy debate in this
country, one critical assump
tion has been largely over
looked — the assumption re
garding the availability of un
discovered oil. After all the talk
about the windfall profits tax
and deregulation, wouldn't it
be ironic if there weren't much
more oil out there to find?
To date, the world has con
sumed approximately 400 bill
ion barrels of oil, and it cur
rently burns about 19 billion
per year. Another 600 billion
barrels are classified as proven
or probable reserves, though
only a fraction (30-50 percent)
is extractable, even using sec
ondary or tertiary recovery
techniques.
Most experts claim that
another 1000 billion (1 trillion)
barrels remain to be disco
vered. The consensus view of 2
trillion barrels is the sum of
these proven, probable and
potential reserves.
If the world is able to main
tain current consumption
rates, these figures imply that
only about 12 years of reserves
ana 33 years of ultimately re
coverable resources remain, at
40 percent recovery. If global
consumption rises, there's

even less time left.
Recently, however, another
school of thought within the
geologic community has main
tained that closer to 5 trillion
barrels (105 years'worth) re
main undiscovered.
Moreover, they claim that
these resources are widely dis
persed, as opposed to concen
trated in a few key countries.
If the latter view is correct,
the economic, political and so
cial implications for all nations
are enormous. If lesser
developed countries can look
forward to finding indigenous
oil resources, they need not
plan on the burden of continu
ing oil payments deficits, and
short-term deficits imply a
dramatically different de
velopment strategy than per
petual deficits.
