## Energy Forum Jonathan Raab Carter's solar promise 
### 
President Jimmy Carter's
continuous flaunting of the
solar banner and condemna
tion of nuclear power as "the
last resort" during his cam
paign convinced many Ameri
cans that a Carter presidency
would bring a new energy
prioritization on the federal
level. But three years later we
find that the federal govern
ment, under Carter's leader
ship, has taken only meager
steps in this direction while
continuing to stress non
renewable energy sources
such as oil, coal, nuclear and
now synfuels.
Carter's commitment to
solar energy has been predo
minantly rhetorical, producing
only a few of the bold prog
rams requisite to increasing
our utilization of solar energy.
Perhaps we should have
been forewarned that the solar
promise of Carter's campaign
would not be realized, when as
his first act as president he ap
pointed )ames Schlesinger as
the Secretary of Energy. It cer
tainly seemed strange that Car
ter would pick the former head
of the Atomic Energy Com
mission, a man who has al
ways stood for centralized,
big-business energy sour.ces
like oil, coal, and nuclear
power to direct the country's
energy future down the solar
path.
The forced resignation of
Schlesinger and the accep
tance of a 20 percent solar goal
by the year 2000 (we presently

derive approximately 6 percent
of our energy from solar
sources) indicated that Carter
might finally be moving in the
right direction. Even though
this commitment was consi
dered low by groups such as
The Solar Lobby, led by Denis
Hayes — who believed that 25
percent was an achievable goal
— as well as the president's
own Council on Environmental
Quality, which advocated set
ting a goal of 23 percent, it was
still a start.
Vet, goals without programs
are empty phrases. The solar
budget is the best example of
this phenomenon. Though it
has grown over the past few
years, the solar budget remains
too low to provide even the in
centives of Carter's own 20
percent goal. At its 1980 level of
$844 million, the solar budget
is still way below the nuclear
budget.
Of course the federal budget
is not solely the president's re
sponsibility; however, it is im
portant to note that the Con
gress has continuously in
creased the solar budget above
the White House's request.
Even the Congress thinks Car
ter's solar budget is in
adequate.
As Hayes points out, if the
energy crisis deserves "the
moral equivalent of war," as
Carter claims, then surely the
renewable solar answers to
that crisis deserve the financial
equivalent of one small
weapons system. Ironically,
Carter's solar budget for 1981

will probably not even increase
above the rate of inflation
while the defense budget rises
five percent above inflation.
Certainly solar's largest
problem right now is that it is
competing with artificially
cheap conventional fuels re
sulting from over $200 biflion in
government subsidies. While
some measures such as dere
gulation are being sought to
smooth out these price
anomalies, Carter's proposed
Energy Mobilization Board will
undoubtedly undermine a sig
nificant portion of these at
tempts.
By empowering the Board to
cut through the red tape and
insure the rapid development
of new (mainly conventional)
energy plants and projects,
much of the environmental
legislation will undoubtedly be
circumvented. As a result, the
cost of these non-renewable
fuels to the consumer will con
tinue to inadequately reflect
the social cost of environmen
tal degradation.
In the end, solar energy for
Carter seems little more than
colorful wrapping paper which
can be used to encase other
more controversial programs.
When Carter proposed his
windfall profits tax, he conve
niently incorporated the Solar
Bank into the plan, which
would provide low-interest
loans for solar installations and
is almost unanimously sup
ported in Washington. This fu
sion of a popular and an un
popular issue typifies Carter's
exploitation of solar energy.
Similarly, the administration
is now trying to appease the
more vocal opponents of the
MX-missile project by promis
ing to make all of the 4600 MX
missile silos totally powered by
solar energy. Yet, when con
gress authorized a large
photovoltaic purachase in 1978
which could have significantly
decreased the market prices of
photovoltaics, Carter refused
to support the program.
What are we, the people,
supposed to conclude as Car
ter continues to pay solar
energy lip-service while ac
tively supporting non
renewable, centralized energy
sources?
Nuclear power, which he
claimed in his campaign to be
only "the last resort" is now
expected to "play an important
role in the United States to in
sure our energy future," and
synfuel technology, which is
unproved and sure to be en
vironmentally destructive, Car
ter has decided deserves "the
most massive peacetime com
mitment of funds in our na
tion's history." Meanwhile, the
sun patiently awaits federal
leadership.
