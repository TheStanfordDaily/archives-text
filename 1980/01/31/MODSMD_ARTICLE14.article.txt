# Energy and undergraduate opportunities Jobs, enrollment booming in earth sciences
## 
### Andrea James 
It's a $20,000-a-year job it you
have a bachelor's degree,
$25,000 if you have a master's.
You'll probably end up getting
a dozen or more job offers and
after a week of weighing them
all, you'll have the enviable
task of writing 11 letters that
turn down those that pay only
$19,000. And then once you're
secure in your first job choice,
you'll spend yourworkingdays
climbing mountains, hiking in
fields and traveling all over the
world in search of energy
sources.
It's no wonder that earth sci
ences is a growing field here at
Stanford, now that many of the
school's graduates are enjoy
ing this kind of lifestyle. Total
undergraduate enrollment in
that school increased more last
year than in any other school
on campus.
Political and social factors
are important considerations
for students engaged in all
energy-related studies prog
rams here, but the open
employment market and de
veloped curriculum have at
tracted the greatest number of
these students to the earth sci
ences program.
Today's 140 Stanford under
graduates who have declared
majors in applied earth sci
ences, geology, geophysics,
petroleum engineering or a
combination of these earth
science fields are looking for
ward to enormous employ
ment prospects and some of
the highest-paid salaries
earned by fresh college
graduates, said School of Earth
Sciences Dean Allan Cox.
For some students, that's an
offer that's too good to pass
up.
"I got into earth sciences be
cause I knew that I could get a
job when I left school that
wasn't going to be selling in
surance," said Mark MacLeod,
now in his first year of Stan

ford's master's program in
earth sciences.
After two summers of work
experience in geology-related
fields, MacLeod decided to go
on for a graduate degree. But
he didn't need it in order to get
a job that demanded responsi
bility and offered challenge
and diversity. In fact, he'd al
ready experienced that with his
last summer job at Rainbow
Resources, a small, indepen
dent oil company based in
Montana.
At Rainbow, MacLeod, then
a newly graduated senior,
compiled and analyzed
geologic data from the
southwest-comer region of
Montana. At the end of the
summer, he made a presenta
tion to company management,
showing them two areas where
oil might be located.
Management looked care

fully at MacLeod's data and
then risked the company in
vestments on one of the sites.
They found oil.
"It's a tremendous amount
ot responsibility," MacLeod
said, remembering his presen
tation.
Scientists still haven't de
veloped a sure-fire way of de
tecting underground oil de
posits. Today's geologists are
interpreting seismic data,
sound waves and acoustical
radar waves to try to find po
tential energy sources.
"All this just gives us hints as
to where the oil is," MacLeod
explained. "The more data you
get, the more you solve the
riddle ot what's down there.
But until you drill, you never
know tor sure."
Many ot the internships
earth sciences students get for
the three summer months have

as much responsibility as Mac-
Leod's. Chris MacAskill,
another M.S. student, last
summer analyzed $1 million in
data obtained trom an area oft
the California coast, near San
Diego. He also made a presen
tation to management, and his
conclusions are still being con
sidered by the company (Chev
ron).
Both MacLeod and MacAskill
said they telt their Stanford
education left them in "pretty
good shape" tor taking on the
jobs at Rainbow and Chevron.
Undergraduate courses, they
said, teach the theory ot earth
sciences and then practical ap
plication is learned during the
internships.
Moreover, the curriculum
offers enough geology,
physics and math so that
graduates have the skills to
search for just about any
energy source an employer
wants.
"You're so broadly trained
that you can use what you
know to look tor hot steam or
minerals as well as oil,"
MacAskill said. "You can move
trom field to field."
And that's what oil com
panies are starting to look for,
he added.

'You're so broadly trained that you can use
what you know to look for hot steam or
minerals as well as oil/

Searching for oil or other
energy sources isn't the only
job awaiting an earth sciences
student. For example, oil com
panies look for people who can
design better ways to extract
the precious fluid; today's
technology can remove only 25
percent of the oil in an under
ground source.
Stanford has its own project
tor researching extraction
methods. At the Stanford Uni
versity Petroleum Research In

stitute, scientists are studying
the effects ot pumping steam
and detergent into oil sites and
of cracking the rocks around
an oil source.
While most of the money
and job opportunities lie in the
technical aspects ot energy,
the world is beginning to note
the many political and social
implications of energy — both
in its acquisition and in its con
servation.
One student who started
with the technical and moved
to the political is lohn Raab,
now a senior here majoring in
social sciences with emphasis
on political science.
Shying away from petroleum
and other "earthly sources,"
Raab is examining solar energy
and its implications tor the
world.
"I first got involved in solar
energy through architecture,"
Raab recalls. "In Connecticut,
our class designed and built a
solar house, and it was then
that I realized the importance
ot solar energy."
Raab dropped out ot school
for a year and a halt to work
with the organizers ot the first
nationally recognized Sun Day
in Washington, D.C. He then
transferred here, where he

teaches a SWOPM course on
the social aspects of solar
energy while finishing the re
quirements tor his degree.
Linlike the thorough cur
riculum in fields like pet
roleum engineering and
geophysics, solar energy has a
scarce class list.
"Solar energy classes here
are completely inadequate,"
he said. "There are only three
or tour classes that discuss


Mark MacLeod
solar energyat all. That's pretty
sad lor something I believe has
lo be in the future tor the Un
ited States it we are to survive i
.«! all."
Other students seem to j
agree with Raab that solar !
( energy may be an important :
I topic in upcoming years. Civil
Engineering Adjunct Prof. Gil 1
Masters teaches a solar energy
course each spring that attracts
I about 150 students, and Raab's
SWOPSI course, taught tor the
tirst time this year, attracted 40
students to its lirst session.
There are more students en
rolling in the class each year,"
! said Masters, who has taught
! "Small Scale Energy Systems"
j tor five years. "Classes here
I that discuss solar energy sys
tems are experiencing fantastic
| growth. More students are
i working on solar energy pro
jects, and in general there
i seems to be more enthusiasm
tor the subject."
The tact that solar energy is a
renewable energy source that
easily lends itself to conserva
tion measures makes it an at
tractive field for many of to
day's concerned young
people, he said.
Raab, however, sees solar
power as being more than just
an energy source.
"Solar power has the poten
tial for assisting in social and
political change in the United
States," he explained. Solar
energy creates more jobs than
do other energy sources, mak
ing it more labor intensive, and
it's a more "decentralized"
form ot energy both because
it's used right where it's pro-
J duced and because it creates
j more small businesses.
It can help make a more
democratic society by putting
energy closer to the people,"
lie said, comparing this system
| with the current one that is
enmeshed in the politics ot in
ternational trade and mutual
dependency.
Hence, he said, political bar
riers are the most serious prob
lems tacing solar energy, not
the technological aspects, as is
the situation with petroleum
engineering.
Solar energy dilters from

petroleum engineering in at
least one other way — the
money and jobs that await col
lege graduates.
"Solar energy isn't a good
thing to get into if you want to
make a lot ol money," Raab
admitted. "Right now, my in
volvement is a labor of love. It
will probably be that way for
the next 10 years or so."
Professor and Associate
Chairman of Mechanical En
gineering Thomas Connolly
presented another view. He
said that energy has become so
entrenched in politics that soc
iety has ended up "looking for
trivial solutions to a very seri
ous problem."
"We have to appreciate the
need tor several different ap
proaches," he stressed. "Say
ing you don't need nuclear
energy or oil because you have
solar power is like saying your
house doesn't need a roof be
cause it has windows. Each is
meeting different needs."
Connolly believes that stu
dents who want a career in an
energy-related field can come
from a variety of disciplines,
including chemical engineer
ing, mechanical engineering
and, to a smaller extent, elec
trical engineering. The field is
not limited to earth science
majors, he said.
"Working in energy is a
mixed bag," he said. "Energy
involves politics, mechanical
engineering, economics, ev
erything."
So he does not advocate the
initiation of an energy major
here at Stantord, even though
he does see the need for a
more organized, packaged
program tor students in
terested in specific energy
fields.
Nuclear energy is one field,
however, that probably won't
be one of those organized,
packaged programs. There are
only three classes at Stanford
that deal with nuclear en
gineering, and there are no
plans to change, Connolly
said.
"We dropped nuclear here
about 10 years ago," he
explained. "It was just too ex
pensive a program."

Synergy House built their solar water heating system (above) in 1972
to supply hot water to the third floor bathroom and showers. A second
system for the rest of the house is currently under construction. The
Synergy solar greenhouse (below) operates on a similar system:
water-filled barrels collect heat and re-radiate it at night.
