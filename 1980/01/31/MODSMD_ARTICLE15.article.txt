Shooting the exhaust from a
coal-powered rocket engine
through the field of a super
conducting magnet may seem
like an unlikely way to ease
America's energy woes. So
may beaming solar energy
down from earth orbit in laser
beams, or gathering together
groups of academics and
executives to discuss the
idiosyncracies of computer
programs. But unlikely as they
may seem, those projects are
among those technologies
being developed here in an at
tempt to boost this country's
ability to produce its own
energy.

Twenty years ago, when
Mechanical Engineering Prof.
Robert Eustis first moved his
research group into the build
ing, it was filled with the latest
in turn-of-the-century boilers.
But now it houses what is in
effect a small-scale experimen
tal electric power station based
on a revolutionary concept cal
led magnetohydrodynamics
(MHD).
Last century, British physicist
Michael Faraday discovered
that moving a conductor, such
as a piece of copper wire,
through the field of a magnet
will produce electricity. This
moving conductor idea is the
basis of all modern oil, coal and
nuclear power plants.

In a conventional power
plant coal or oil is burned to
heat water into high pressure
steam. This steam spins a tur
bine which in turns rotates a
coil of copper wires inside a
generator. This mass of wires
spins in a magnetic field and
the electricity flows out. But it
takes a lot of wire to light a city
and the equipment needed is
heavy. It takes large amounts
of coal, soot and steam to keep
the generators spinning.
The MHD generator, how
ever, has no moving parts.
What is essentially the hot ex
panding smoke from burning
coal shoots down a tube much
like a rocket nozzle. Simple
chemicals are added to make
the gases conduct electricity,
and the resulting spray passes
between the poles of a magnet.

What Faraday discovered tells
us that this moving conductor
in a magnetic field should pro
duce electricity, and that is
exactly what happens.
Eustis said that the MHD
generator is promising be
cause in an actual plant, a batch
of coal will be used twice by
attaching a conventional plant
on the tail end of the MFHD
one. After the hot gases have
passed through the magnet,
they will still be warm enough
to heat steam to spin a conven
tional turbine. By using the
burning coal to heat two diffe
rent plants operating in tan
dem, the overall efficiency —
how much energy from the
coal is actually converted into
electricity — will climb by 50

percent.
This means less coal needs to
be mined to produce a given
amount ot power, fewer pol
lutants will be released into the
air and less waste heat will be
dumped into rivers and bays.
Though Westinghouse,
Avco Evert Lab and General
Electric will eventually be the
companies building the first
operational MHD generators,
Eustis and his team are the
ones answering the questions
that must be solved before
production can start. Eustis
said his group is the research
arm of the Department Ot
Energy (DOE) studying the ef
fects of the large magnetic
fields that will be needed for
actual power generation and
how the machinery should be
built to ensure maximum
lifetime.
A site for a test plant,
scheduled to be completed in
1992, is already being prepared
in Montana by the DOE in an
ticipation of the successful
completion of the research
here. Eustis seems confident in
MHD. Its only drawback, he
said, is that it is not yet fully
developed.
Solar satellite
Other energy-related pro
jects here are still on the draw
ing boards though. Bob Colson
is an acting professor here in
theoretical physics working
undera grant from NASA. He is
visiting from Rice University
where he is a member of the
Center for Space Physics and a
part of a group studying the
possibility of putting large
satellites in earth orbit to col
lect solar energy and beam it
back to earth.
The difficulty with lighting a
city with land-based solar
energy is that — even assuming
perfect weather — it is night
half the time. But a satellite

22,000 miles up could hover
above a city in perpetual sun
shine. An orbiting solar panel
10 miles long and 3 to 5 miles
wide could produce enough
power to supply the needs of a
city the size of Houston, ac
cording to Colson.
This power, however, must
somehow be conveyed to
earth. One way is to beam it
down in microwaves — similar
to the ones in kitchen ovens.
But microwaves have very long
wavelengths which means they
spread out as they travel
through space. After speeding
22,000 miles the microwaves
would cover a 10-square mile
area — requiring an antenna of
that size on the earth to collect
the energy.
Colson is developing a de

vice which NASA hopes may be
an alternative to using mic
rowaves, a new highly efficient
laser called the free-electron
laser. A normal laser is basically
a gas-filled tube with mirrors at
both ends. The electrons in the
gas atoms vibrate and emit
light. This light bounces back
and forth between the mirrors,
causing more and more elec
trons to vibrate emitting more
light. When the beam is strong
enough, it is let out of the
chamber in the form of a laser
beam.
This standard laser works
well enough, but it has some
problems. While the vibrating
electrons are the only things
that actually contribute to the
output of light, the gas is full of
