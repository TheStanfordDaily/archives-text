# Institute provides funds

Though it is not a tangible
laboratory or department, the
Stanford University Institute
for Energy Studies (SUIES) af
fects energy research
throughout the campus by
channeling resources and
funds earmarked for energy to
appropriate departments.
A major aim ot the Institute
founded in 1973, according to
Chairman William Reynolds
(also chairman of the Mechani
cal Engineering Department),
is to provide research "seed
ing" funds to stimulate new
areas of research.
SUIES provides one-time
amounts of from $5000 to
$20,000 to help energy resear
chers get started. Topic areas
funded in the past include coal
sciences, solar energy (such as
photovoltaics), energy model
ing and energy policy. Over
the past six years, Reynolds
said, about 25 faculty groups
received such "seed grants"
after their proposals were
selected by a SUIES faculty
panel.
SUIES also conducts a semi
nar program in conjunction
with the Systems Optimization
Laboratory, the Energy Model
ing Forum and the Interna
tional Energy Program. In addi
tion, a visiting professor prog
ram has brought energy ex
perts to Stanford. And SUIES
operates the Energy Informa
tion Center, an energy library
located on Panama Street.
SUIES is.also the central
source for energy fellowships
and traineeships, totaling
about 30 this year, Reynolds
said. Standard Oil has spon
sored 60 engineering and earth
science fellowships over the
past six years.
The Institute now receives
.about $250,000 a year from the
Department of Energy (DOE)
for innovative, energy-related
research. Another $250,000
comes from the Exxon Founda
tion, Standard Oil of Califor
nia, General Electric and
alumni contributions.
According to Susan Missner,
research associate for the In
ternational Energy Program
(lEP), the Institute is "the
grandfather of energy policy at
Stanford." Missner compiled a
report, just released last week,
called The Status of Energy Pol
icy Research at Stanford, in
which she describes two other
research groups SUIES helped
found: the Energy Modeling
Forum, which is connected
with the Engineering-
Economic Systems Dept. and
the Operations Research

Dept., and the International
Energy Program, itself a part of
the Business School.
The lEP was organized last
year by Prof. Henry Rowen of
the Business School with a
two-year, $500,000 grant from
the DOE. The program has

three principal projects, Mis
sner said. First, the program is
working on an international
energy supply/demand fore
cast for projections through
the beginning of the next cen

tury. To do this, ICP is also
building a computerized
database of standardized
world-wide energy supply/
demand estimates.
Second, the group hopes to
complete a study called "The
Energy Security Project" by
early 1981 to analyze policy op
tions such as stockpiling, im
port quotas, tariffs and alter
nate energies to reduce Per
sian Gulf oil dependency. The
study will include several
hypothetical scenarios dealing
with possible sudden interrup
tions of the American oil sup
ply.
The third project, to be
completed in the next two
months, deals with techniques
to assess underground oil
supplies. Several graduate stu
dents from the Business
School, the Engineering-
Economic Systems Dept., and
the Operations Research Dept.
are participating in -the prog
ram, according to Missner.

One of the most attractive University buildings, Terman Engineering was also constructed in accordance with
principles of passive solar design. Adjustment of the louvered windows is used to regulate temperature, saving
cooling and heating costs.
