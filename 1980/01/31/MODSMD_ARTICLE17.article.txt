# Answer energy questions at EIC

Like to know when and
where an energy-related meet
ing will be held? Find out more
about U.S. energy research?
Or learn how to obtain energy
research funds?
There's a place on campus,
the Energy Information Center
(EIC), designed to answer just
such questions.
Located on Panama Street
near the Old Union, the center
is open to students, faculty and
the general public.
The EIC is operated by the
Institute for Energy Studies
here as part of its goal to coor
dinate energy research and
funding at Stanford.
The EIC contains more than
10,000 books, documents,
monographs and government
publications. The collection
also includes more than 100
magazine titles, and more than
2000 reports on microfiche. In
addition, the EIC has access to
other Bay Area energy lib
raries. According to Director
Marian Rees, about 20 people
use the EIC facilities each day
and researchers sometimes
work on outdoor patio tables,
or overflow into other parts of
the building.
Black-and-white videotapes
of energy seminars given at
Stanford are also available for
use by individuals and groups.
Off-campus groups must pay a

fee to use the tapes, however.
Some tapes are highly techni
cal, while others focuson more
general issues.
The EIC library also houses
reserve readings for energy
related courses, such as Ap
propriate Technology, Energy
from Plants, Energy Mod
elin,and The Politics of Solar
Energy. Rees also helps profes
sors compile reading lists for
energy-related topics.
A microfiche reader/printer
was installed recently. Almost
all government reports on
energy will now be available,
and approximately 2000 more
items per year will be added to
the collection. A computer
searching service for bibliog
raphic entries and numerical
energy data will be installed by
the end of 1980.
The Energy Information
Center has a $40,000-a-year
budget, funded by the De
partment of Energy, corporate
sponsors, and individual dona
tions, according to Mechanical
Engineering Prof. William
Reynolds, chairman of the In
stitute of Energy Studies.
The institute also provides
"seed" funds for innovative
energy research, conducts
seminar programs, supports
energy fellowships, sponsors
visiting professors and pub
lishes The Stanford Energy Re
port and books dealing with
energy policy.
