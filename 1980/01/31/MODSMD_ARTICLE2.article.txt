# Coordinator's note
## 
### 
It is unnecessary to elaborate on the importance of energy
today; the economic repercussions and political implications of
U. S. dependence on foreign oil are evident to anyone who has
read a newspaper lately.
Energy is the most critical issue lacing the world at the present
time; hence the motivation behind this publication. However, it
is beyond the resources and capabilities of this paper to do
anything resembling a "complete" job on such a complex and
tar-reaching issue.
What you hold in tront of you is the best form of a compromise
we could devise.
Hopefully, there will be something of interest for everyone
presented here. I hope this magazine succeeds in at least one
thing, however. I hope it serves to raise your awareness of the use
of energy at Stanford as much as it has raised mine.
Finally, I would like to acknowledge a few people in particular
who helped this project become reality. The beautiful cover was
done by Gary, and I thank him for his helptul advice throughout
this venture. I also express my gratitude to Vic, jimmy, Ron and
Seth for their help and advice. And the dedication of Bev and
Mary Rose and the rest of the backshop crew was appreciated —
especially since we got to bed belore the sun came up!
And my most sincere thanks and love to Sara for her patience
and copy editing. Without her help, this whole thing would have
never happened. Good night!
