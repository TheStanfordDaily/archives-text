# Swaim battles waste problem

Within the University's
strongly pre-med-oriented
biology program, ASSU Recycl
ing Center Co-Manager Katy
Swaim has found what she
considers a more constructive
aim for her major.
Since taking a SWOPSI
course on waste reduction in
the fall of 1976, the senior has
been actively directing her
own education in that area,
playing a major role in the
growth of the University's re
cycling program. In addition,
Swaim is helping to teach a
counterpart of that 1976
SWOPSI course this quarter
entitled "Solid Waste Man
agement."
In fact, after a year of travel
ing abroad in 1977 and 1978,
Swaim returned to Stanford
convinced that she wished to
design her own major in solid
waste management
"Being overseas, I saw the
results of American consump
tion — how other nations pick
up the bad side," she said.
"We throw an awful lot away."
Although she changed her
mind about an individually de
signed major, she didn't aban
don her interest.
"Before I was in the SWOPSI
class I never really thought
about recycling," she said.
"But it seems Tike common
sense. We work to save trees
and then use paper like it's
going out of style.
"Solid waste is something
people don't think about. They
throw (waste) away and it's
gone — they think. But it is
there, especially in the Bay

Area," she said. San Francisco
already trucks its garbage to
Mountain View because city
dumps are nearly full.
For this reason, Swaim feels
that informing the public is one
of the most pressing problems
faced in waste management
and recycling.
Publicity ranks among the
priority projects for both the
Recycling Center, which is
sending out information letters
to dorms and offices, and the
SWOPSI course, which is look
ing into advertising and public
awareness techniques.
SWOPSI students are prepar
ing dorm presentations and
the Recycling Center has a
slide show in the works.
Vet, unofficial estimates in
dicate that the Recycling
Center processes close to 10
percent of the University's
garbage, in relative terms a
very high proportion, accord
ing to Swaim.
"I think Stanford has one of
the best or the best recycling
program in the country. People
have written us from places
like Philadelphia, asking for
tips on how to start a recycling
center," she said.
The center has the advantage
of working closely with the city
of Palo Alto's highly successful
recycling program, including
"one of the best curbside
programs in the nation," ac
cording to Swaim. The
curbside program entails the
pickup of recyclables in con
tainers set on curbs in residen
tial areas of Palo Alto.
One of the SWOPSI-initiated
concepts in motion at the pre
sent time is "precycling" in var

iousPaloAltosupermarkets. In
this program, labels on market
shelves inform customers
which containers are recycla
ble before they buy goods.
Yet the most successful pro
ject to come out of that first
SWOPSI class is the ASSU Re
cycling Center itself.
Currently under the direc
tion of Swaim and subsequent
SWOPSI class graduates Lisa
joyce and Terry Barton, the
center has more than doubled
its volume — as well as its staff
— since officially opening in
the winter of 1978, according to
Swaim. The contents of the
widely-recognized green re
cycling bins are now collected
around campus eight hours a
day from Monday through
Saturday.
The three co-managers are
currently waiting for Escon
dido Village to finish clearing
its former recreational vehicle

storage lot, which the housing
complex turned over to the
ASSU to allow for further ex
pansion of the recycling opera
tion.
Graduating in June, how
ever, Swaim also must begin
thinking about her own per
sonal future.
"I think when I get out of
school I just want to travel. I'd
love to get a job in interna
tional solid waste manage
ment," she said.
Swaim said the three senior
project managers are aware of
the impact of their graduation
on the future of the recycling
program.
"We're starting to look right
now for project managers
among the staff and the
SWOPSI class. It's no problem
getting staff," said Swaim.
Getting excited project man
agers is even more important,
according to Swaim, "but I

don't think that will be that
much of a problem because
we're starting now.
"We realize that we're
graduating so we're trying to
make sure our knowledge is
passed on. All the notes for the
SWOPSI class and the hand
outs are being kept so that they
can be improved and the class
can be taught again," she said.
Reliability is the greatest
concern for the future, accord
ing to Swaim. As long as the
program was relatively new,
minor slip-ups could be to
lerated. But as the recycling
center becomes a more impor
tant service to the community
it has to become equally more
reliable if it is to remain suc
cessful, said Swaim.
"That's what we're working
on now, reorganizing in order
to leave greater efficiency to
the new people who take
over."

SWOPSI-initiated plan to improve an existing, private recycling operation.
