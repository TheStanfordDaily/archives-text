# Radioactive wastes here handled with care
## Stanford prevention system 'one of the best'

Between Maples Pavilion
and the police station stands a
low, inconspicuous shed that
is locked, protected by an
elaborate alarm system. For
merly a storage space for gar
dening tools, it now houses
Stanford's radioactive waste
handling facility.
Although the University's
waste-handling procedures
and guidelines are not particu
larly complicated or danger
ous, extra care is taken to en
sure the safety and protection
of radioactivity usage (mostly
low-level) here.

. . . the University exposure limits to
radiation are one-tenth those of the federal
and state governments'.

According to (he two gov
ernment safety officers who
monitor the University's com
pliance with federal and state
salety and health standards,
Stanford has one of the best
and most reliable systems in
the state.
Associate Health Physicist
Jack Brown of the California
Department of Health in Ber
keley said the University has
"one of the best programs in
the state — in safety, know
ledge and adequacy."
Calvin Jackson of the U.S. j
Department of Energy, who in- !
spects the Stanford Linear Ac- I
(elerator Center (SI AC), con- i
curred, adding he has never I

discovered a violation of
radioactive materials proce
dure there.
The University has a total of
about 300 research projects
that involve radioactive
isotopes and approximately
140 machines and instruments
that generate radiation.
The radioactive isotopes
used are mostly forms ot phos
phorous, iodine, carbon and
hydrogen. There is also a small
number of larger, stronger
sources that require heavy
shielding and are used for
deep-irradiation treatment of
patients at the Medical Center.
The machines are used for

such purposes as X-ray crystal
lography and diffraction. Both
the machines and the isotopes
are covered by Stanford's
"broad license," an authoriza
tion from the State Department
of Health that allows the Uni
versity to issue permits to its
staff to use radioactive mate
rials and administer its own
program with periodic inspec
tions from the state regulatory
officials.
Broad licenses are given to
institutions with large usages
ot radioactive chemicals which
have a group set up that is con
cerned with the management
of the health risks involved.
The University's Panel on

Radiological Hazards, a com
mittee appointed by the Uni
versity president and chaired
by Biology Prof. Philip
Hanawalt, makes the rules
governing the handling of
radioactive materials. The
Health Physics Department
administers the guidelines de
termined by the panel.
The Health Physics Depart
ment monitors safety at the
Medical Center and the Vete
rans Administration Hospital
as well as the University
proper, but SLAC has its own
team that ensures observance
of regulations from the De
partment of Energy in Oak
land.
The regulatory officials from
the government agencies con
cerned inspect procedures
here periodically, lackson, of
the Department of Energy, said
he visits SLAC about three to
six times a year, notifying them
only one day in advance.
Richard McCall, radiation
safety officer at SLAC, said,
however, that Jackson visits
only once or twice annually.
Brown, of the state Health
Department, said he inspects
the University about once a
year or year and a half.
Furthermore, the Depart
ment of Health reviews the
procedures and licenses every
few years, Brown said.
When radioactive materials
are delivered to the LJniversity,
they arrive via normal com
mercial carriers. Health Physics
personnel will inspect them for
leakage or contamination if
they are high-level sources,

strength that can be aimed at the machinery that is being tested.
said John Holmes, senior
health physicist at Health
Physics. The samples then pro
ceed through regular channels
to the department that ordered
the material.
The Biochemistry Depart
ment samples of radioactive
phosphorous arrive in vials en
cased in lead shielding. The
vials are stored in a central
plexiglass cabinet, which is sut
ficient to block the kind of
radiation, beta rays, that
Phosphorous-32 emits.
Whenever radioactive mate
rial is taken from the shielded
cabinet, the precise volume
and amount of radioactivity is
logged out, said Terrence
Trobough, who manages
radioactive material tor the de
partment. Other substances
that are not used as commonly
are stored similarly in indi
vidual labs, he said.
If the quality of radioactivity
exceeds a certain level depen
dent upon the material used, it
must be used in a hood, and if
it exceeds a higher level, a
glove-box must he employed
to isolate the experimenter
from the radioactive isotopes.
Holmes said there was one
instance last year in which a
woman worked with a radioac
tive source outside a hood,
contrary to instructions she

had received. She absorbed
nearly her entire yearly
government-established
maximum radiation dose in
three months, but there is no
health hazard to her, Holmes
added. She has been prohi
bited from using radioactive
materials because of the inci
! dent.
In another case last year,
| Brown found a bag of slightly
I radioactive waste in the wrong
I container, an instance of "user
error," Holmes said. He called
both these incidents "rela
tively minor."
According to Holmes, the Uni
versity exposure limits to radia
tion are one-tenth those ol the
federal and state governments.'
Holmes explained that setting
stringent but reasonable goals
helps minimize employees'
exposure to radioactivity.
The University's philosophy
in this matter is set forth in a
report by the Panel on
Radiological Hazards: "There
appears to be no such thing as
a safe level of exposure to radi
ation. It is assumed that every
increment of ionizing radiation
i carries some increment of
risk."
Brown said, however, that
"it is hard to prove what are the
effects of low-level radiation.''

The bags of low-level radioactive waste (above) are brought to the Health Physics waste facility near Maples
Pavilion. They are dumped onto this stainless steel table (below) and inspected for liquids before they are
packed into 55-gallon drums.
sence of even small amounts of
radioactivity, Health Physics
personnel check for radioac
tive contamination in the labs
with geiger counters and
gamma ray monitors. Viola
tions are found infrequently,
and then usually only of Uni
versity, not government stan
dards. Holmes said, adding
"the excess contamination is
so low you could clean the
level up and eat it and it would
do you no harm."
There are two kinds of
radioactive waste — dry and
wet. Wet waste (solutions con
taining radioactive isotopes)
are treated by putting them in a

coffee can and pouring quick
setting cement on tnem. By ab
sorption, the cement elimi
nates the main hazard of wet
waste, which is evaporation
and spillage. Liquids are more
difficult to contain than dry
waste, which is a combination
of disposable glassware, paper
towels and similar materials.
Dry waste is placed in three
foot-high boxes inside plexig
lass containers, and a log is
kept of what is deposited and
how radioactive it is. When the
box fills up, specially trained
Health Physics personnel carry
it away to the facility near
Maples Pavilion. They check
the waste log and dump the

trash onto a stainless steel
table and examine it. This pro
cedure was instituted because
the dump the University uses
requires an inspection to make
sure no liquid waste is being
shipped, Holmes said. "It (ex
amining the waste) is a very
manageable risk," he added.
The inspection requirement
has just been instituted, he
said, and soon the ventilation
in the room will be increased to
keep levels of radioactivity
down.
The waste is packed into bar
rels and compacted. Every
three or four months a truck
picks up 150 barrels and takes
them to a private dump site in

Washington.
SLAC has a similar disposal
system, but it processes much
less waste. They have only
generated 12 55-gallon barrels
full in the past two years, ac
cording to McCall. Their ship
ments are sent to the Depart
ment of Energy dumping site in
Idaho.
Brown said that the Univer
sity uses about as many
radioactive isotopes as UC-
Berkeley, but has many fewer
problems with safety.
"In general, the state seems
to have less money or place
less importance on safety"
than Stanford does, he said.

After the waste is inspected, it is placed in barrels and compacted with a hyraulic ram (left). When barrels fill
up, they join tens of others outside (above). Half-hidden behind the trees is Maples Pavilion.

plexiglass cabinet, which is sut
ficient to block the kind of
radiation, beta rays, that
Phosphorous-32 emits.
Whenever radioactive mate
rial is taken from the shielded
cabinet, the precise volume
and amount of radioactivity is
logged out, said Terrence
Trobough, who manages
radioactive material tor the de
partment. Other substances
that are not used as commonly
are stored similarly in indi
vidual labs, he said.
If the quality of radioactivity
exceeds a certain level depen
dent upon the material used, it
must be used in a hood, and if
it exceeds a higher level, a
glove-box must he employed
to isolate the experimenter
from the radioactive isotopes.
Holmes said there was one
instance last year in which a
woman worked with a radioac
tive source outside a hood,
contrary to instructions she

had received. She absorbed
nearly her entire yearly
government-established
maximum radiation dose in
three months, but there is no
health hazard to her, Holmes
added. She has been prohi
bited from using radioactive
materials because of the inci
! dent.
In another case last year,
| Brown found a bag of slightly
I radioactive waste in the wrong
I container, an instance of "user
error," Holmes said. He called
both these incidents "rela
tively minor."
According to Holmes, the Uni
versity exposure limits to radia
tion are one-tenth those ol the
federal and state governments.'
Holmes explained that setting
stringent but reasonable goals
helps minimize employees'
exposure to radioactivity.
The University's philosophy
in this matter is set forth in a
report by the Panel on
Radiological Hazards: "There
appears to be no such thing as
a safe level of exposure to radi
ation. It is assumed that every
increment of ionizing radiation
i carries some increment of
risk."
Brown said, however, that
"it is hard to prove what are the
effects of low-level radiation.''

The bags of low-level radioactive waste (above) are brought to the Health Physics waste facility near Maples
Pavilion. They are dumped onto this stainless steel table (below) and inspected for liquids before they are
packed into 55-gallon drums.
sence of even small amounts of
radioactivity, Health Physics
personnel check for radioac
tive contamination in the labs
with geiger counters and
gamma ray monitors. Viola
tions are found infrequently,
and then usually only of Uni
versity, not government stan
dards. Holmes said, adding
"the excess contamination is
so low you could clean the
level up and eat it and it would
do you no harm."
There are two kinds of
radioactive waste — dry and
wet. Wet waste (solutions con
taining radioactive isotopes)
are treated by putting them in a

coffee can and pouring quick
setting cement on tnem. By ab
sorption, the cement elimi
nates the main hazard of wet
waste, which is evaporation
and spillage. Liquids are more
difficult to contain than dry
waste, which is a combination
of disposable glassware, paper
towels and similar materials.
Dry waste is placed in three
foot-high boxes inside plexig
lass containers, and a log is
kept of what is deposited and
how radioactive it is. When the
box fills up, specially trained
Health Physics personnel carry
it away to the facility near
Maples Pavilion. They check
the waste log and dump the

trash onto a stainless steel
table and examine it. This pro
cedure was instituted because
the dump the University uses
requires an inspection to make
sure no liquid waste is being
shipped, Holmes said. "It (ex
amining the waste) is a very
manageable risk," he added.
The inspection requirement
has just been instituted, he
said, and soon the ventilation
in the room will be increased to
keep levels of radioactivity
down.
The waste is packed into bar
rels and compacted. Every
three or four months a truck
picks up 150 barrels and takes
them to a private dump site in

Washington.
SLAC has a similar disposal
system, but it processes much
less waste. They have only
generated 12 55-gallon barrels
full in the past two years, ac
cording to McCall. Their ship
ments are sent to the Depart
ment of Energy dumping site in
Idaho.
Brown said that the Univer
sity uses about as many
radioactive isotopes as UC-
Berkeley, but has many fewer
problems with safety.
"In general, the state seems
to have less money or place
less importance on safety"
than Stanford does, he said.

After the waste is inspected, it is placed in barrels and compacted with a hyraulic ram (left). When barrels fill
up, they join tens of others outside (above). Half-hidden behind the trees is Maples Pavilion.
Between Maples Pavilion
and the police station stands a
low, inconspicuous shed that
is locked, protected by an
elaborate alarm system. For
merly a storage space for gar

Stanford's radioactive waste

Although the University's
waste-handling procedures
and guidelines are not particu
larly complicated or danger
ous, extra care is taken to en

of radioactivity usage (mostly
low-level) here.

radiation are one-tenth those of the federal
and state governments'.

According to (he two gov
ernment safety officers who
monitor the University's com
pliance with federal and state
salety and health standards,
Stanford has one of the best
and most reliable systems in
the state.
Associate Health Physicist
Jack Brown of the California
Department of Health in Ber
keley said the University has
"one of the best programs in
the state — in safety, know
ledge and adequacy."
Calvin Jackson of the U.S. j
Department of Energy, who in- !
spects the Stanford Linear Ac- I
(elerator Center (SI AC), con- i
curred, adding he has never I

discovered a violation of
radioactive materials proce
dure there.
The University has a total of
about 300 research projects
that involve radioactive
isotopes and approximately
140 machines and instruments
that generate radiation.
The radioactive isotopes
used are mostly forms ot phos
phorous, iodine, carbon and
hydrogen. There is also a small
number of larger, stronger
sources that require heavy
shielding and are used for
deep-irradiation treatment of
patients at the Medical Center.
The machines are used for

such purposes as X-ray crystal
lography and diffraction. Both
the machines and the isotopes
are covered by Stanford's
"broad license," an authoriza
tion from the State Department
of Health that allows the Uni
versity to issue permits to its
staff to use radioactive mate
rials and administer its own
program with periodic inspec
tions from the state regulatory
officials.
Broad licenses are given to
institutions with large usages
ot radioactive chemicals which
have a group set up that is con
cerned with the management
of the health risks involved.
The University's Panel on

Radiological Hazards, a com
mittee appointed by the Uni
versity president and chaired
by Biology Prof. Philip
Hanawalt, makes the rules
governing the handling of
radioactive materials. The
Health Physics Department
administers the guidelines de
termined by the panel.
The Health Physics Depart
ment monitors safety at the
Medical Center and the Vete
rans Administration Hospital
as well as the University
proper, but SLAC has its own
team that ensures observance
of regulations from the De
partment of Energy in Oak
land.
The regulatory officials from
the government agencies con
cerned inspect procedures
here periodically, lackson, of
the Department of Energy, said
he visits SLAC about three to
six times a year, notifying them
only one day in advance.
Richard McCall, radiation
safety officer at SLAC, said,
however, that Jackson visits
only once or twice annually.
Brown, of the state Health
Department, said he inspects
the University about once a
year or year and a half.
Furthermore, the Depart
ment of Health reviews the
procedures and licenses every
few years, Brown said.

ment of Energy dumping site in

Brown said that the Univer
sity uses about as many
radioactive isotopes as UC-
Berkeley, but has many fewer
problems with safety.
"In general, the state seems
to have less money or place
less importance on safety"
than Stanford does, he said.

After the waste is inspected, it is placed in barrels and compacted with a hyraulic ram (left). When barrels fill
up, they join tens of others outside (above). Half-hidden behind the trees is Maples Pavilion.
Between Maples Pavilion
and the police station stands a
low, inconspicuous shed that
is locked, protected by an
elaborate alarm system. For
merly a storage space for gar
dening tools, it now houses
Stanford's radioactive waste
handling facility.
Although the University's
waste-handling procedures
and guidelines are not particu
larly complicated or danger
ous, extra care is taken to en
sure the safety and protection
of radioactivity usage (mostly
low-level) here.

. . . the University exposure limits to
radiation are one-tenth those of the federal
and state governments'.

According to (he two gov
ernment safety officers who
monitor the University's com
pliance with federal and state
salety and health standards,
Stanford has one of the best
and most reliable systems in
the state.
Associate Health Physicist
Jack Brown of the California
Department of Health in Ber
keley said the University has
"one of the best programs in
the state — in safety, know
ledge and adequacy."
Calvin Jackson of the U.S. j
Department of Energy, who in- !
spects the Stanford Linear Ac- I
(elerator Center (SI AC), con- i
curred, adding he has never I

discovered a violation of
radioactive materials proce
dure there.
The University has a total of
about 300 research projects
that involve radioactive
isotopes and approximately
140 machines and instruments
that generate radiation.
The radioactive isotopes
used are mostly forms ot phos
phorous, iodine, carbon and
hydrogen. There is also a small
number of larger, stronger
sources that require heavy
shielding and are used for
deep-irradiation treatment of
patients at the Medical Center.
The machines are used for

such purposes as X-ray crystal
lography and diffraction. Both
the machines and the isotopes
are covered by Stanford's
"broad license," an authoriza
tion from the State Department
of Health that allows the Uni
versity to issue permits to its
staff to use radioactive mate
rials and administer its own
program with periodic inspec
tions from the state regulatory
officials.
Broad licenses are given to
institutions with large usages
ot radioactive chemicals which
have a group set up that is con
cerned with the management
of the health risks involved.
The University's Panel on

Radiological Hazards, a com
mittee appointed by the Uni
versity president and chaired
by Biology Prof. Philip
Hanawalt, makes the rules
governing the handling of
radioactive materials. The
Health Physics Department
administers the guidelines de
termined by the panel.
The Health Physics Depart
ment monitors safety at the
Medical Center and the Vete
rans Administration Hospital
as well as the University
proper, but SLAC has its own
team that ensures observance
of regulations from the De
partment of Energy in Oak
land.
The regulatory officials from
the government agencies con
cerned inspect procedures
here periodically, lackson, of
the Department of Energy, said
he visits SLAC about three to
six times a year, notifying them
only one day in advance.
Richard McCall, radiation
safety officer at SLAC, said,
however, that Jackson visits
only once or twice annually.
Brown, of the state Health
Department, said he inspects
the University about once a
year or year and a half.
Furthermore, the Depart
ment of Health reviews the
procedures and licenses every
few years, Brown said.
When radioactive materials
are delivered to the LJniversity,
they arrive via normal com
mercial carriers. Health Physics
personnel will inspect them for
leakage or contamination if
they are high-level sources,

Health Physics Department uses to calibrate its radiation monitors.
This Cyclops-like device holds several radioactive sources of known
strength that can be aimed at the machinery that is being tested.
said John Holmes, senior
health physicist at Health
Physics. The samples then pro
ceed through regular channels
to the department that ordered
the material.
The Biochemistry Depart
ment samples of radioactive
phosphorous arrive in vials en
cased in lead shielding. The
vials are stored in a central
plexiglass cabinet, which is sut
ficient to block the kind of
radiation, beta rays, that
Phosphorous-32 emits.
Whenever radioactive mate
rial is taken from the shielded
cabinet, the precise volume
and amount of radioactivity is
logged out, said Terrence
Trobough, who manages
radioactive material tor the de
partment. Other substances
that are not used as commonly
are stored similarly in indi
vidual labs, he said.
If the quality of radioactivity
exceeds a certain level depen
dent upon the material used, it
must be used in a hood, and if
it exceeds a higher level, a
glove-box must he employed
to isolate the experimenter
from the radioactive isotopes.
Holmes said there was one
instance last year in which a
woman worked with a radioac
tive source outside a hood,
contrary to instructions she

had received. She absorbed
nearly her entire yearly
government-established
maximum radiation dose in
three months, but there is no
health hazard to her, Holmes
added. She has been prohi
bited from using radioactive
materials because of the inci
! dent.
In another case last year,
| Brown found a bag of slightly
I radioactive waste in the wrong
I container, an instance of "user
error," Holmes said. He called
both these incidents "rela
tively minor."
According to Holmes, the Uni
versity exposure limits to radia
tion are one-tenth those ol the
federal and state governments.'
Holmes explained that setting
stringent but reasonable goals
helps minimize employees'
exposure to radioactivity.
The University's philosophy
in this matter is set forth in a
report by the Panel on
Radiological Hazards: "There
appears to be no such thing as
a safe level of exposure to radi
ation. It is assumed that every
increment of ionizing radiation
i carries some increment of
risk."
Brown said, however, that
"it is hard to prove what are the
effects of low-level radiation.''

The bags of low-level radioactive waste (above) are brought to the Health Physics waste facility near Maples
Pavilion. They are dumped onto this stainless steel table (below) and inspected for liquids before they are
packed into 55-gallon drums.
sence of even small amounts of
radioactivity, Health Physics
personnel check for radioac
tive contamination in the labs
with geiger counters and
gamma ray monitors. Viola
tions are found infrequently,
and then usually only of Uni
versity, not government stan
dards. Holmes said, adding
"the excess contamination is
so low you could clean the
level up and eat it and it would
do you no harm."
There are two kinds of
radioactive waste — dry and
wet. Wet waste (solutions con
taining radioactive isotopes)
are treated by putting them in a

coffee can and pouring quick
setting cement on tnem. By ab
sorption, the cement elimi
nates the main hazard of wet
waste, which is evaporation
and spillage. Liquids are more
difficult to contain than dry
waste, which is a combination
of disposable glassware, paper
towels and similar materials.
Dry waste is placed in three
foot-high boxes inside plexig
lass containers, and a log is
kept of what is deposited and
how radioactive it is. When the
box fills up, specially trained
Health Physics personnel carry
it away to the facility near
Maples Pavilion. They check
the waste log and dump the

trash onto a stainless steel
table and examine it. This pro
cedure was instituted because
the dump the University uses
requires an inspection to make
sure no liquid waste is being
shipped, Holmes said. "It (ex
amining the waste) is a very
manageable risk," he added.
The inspection requirement
has just been instituted, he
said, and soon the ventilation
in the room will be increased to
keep levels of radioactivity
down.
The waste is packed into bar
rels and compacted. Every
three or four months a truck
picks up 150 barrels and takes
them to a private dump site in

Washington.
SLAC has a similar disposal
system, but it processes much
less waste. They have only
generated 12 55-gallon barrels
full in the past two years, ac
cording to McCall. Their ship
ments are sent to the Depart
ment of Energy dumping site in
Idaho.
Brown said that the Univer
sity uses about as many
radioactive isotopes as UC-
Berkeley, but has many fewer
problems with safety.

to have less money or place
less importance on safety"
