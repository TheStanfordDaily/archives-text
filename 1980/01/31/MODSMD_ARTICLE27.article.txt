# Radioactive wastes here handled with care
## Stanford prevention system 'one of the best'

Between Maples Pavilion
and the police station stands a
low, inconspicuous shed that
is locked, protected by an
elaborate alarm system. For
merly a storage space for gar
dening tools, it now houses
Stanford's radioactive waste
handling facility.
Although the University's
waste-handling procedures
and guidelines are not particu
larly complicated or danger
ous, extra care is taken to en
sure the safety and protection
of radioactivity usage (mostly
low-level) here.

. . . the University exposure limits to
radiation are one-tenth those of the federal
and state governments'.

According to (he two gov
ernment safety officers who
monitor the University's com
pliance with federal and state
salety and health standards,
Stanford has one of the best
and most reliable systems in
the state.
Associate Health Physicist
Jack Brown of the California
Department of Health in Ber
keley said the University has
"one of the best programs in
the state — in safety, know
ledge and adequacy."
Calvin Jackson of the U.S. j
Department of Energy, who in- !
spects the Stanford Linear Ac- I
(elerator Center (SI AC), con- i
curred, adding he has never I

discovered a violation of
radioactive materials proce
dure there.
The University has a total of
about 300 research projects
that involve radioactive
isotopes and approximately
140 machines and instruments
that generate radiation.
The radioactive isotopes
used are mostly forms ot phos
phorous, iodine, carbon and
hydrogen. There is also a small
number of larger, stronger
sources that require heavy
shielding and are used for
deep-irradiation treatment of
patients at the Medical Center.
The machines are used for

such purposes as X-ray crystal
lography and diffraction. Both
the machines and the isotopes
are covered by Stanford's
"broad license," an authoriza
tion from the State Department
of Health that allows the Uni
versity to issue permits to its
staff to use radioactive mate
rials and administer its own
program with periodic inspec
tions from the state regulatory
officials.
Broad licenses are given to
institutions with large usages
ot radioactive chemicals which
have a group set up that is con
cerned with the management
of the health risks involved.
The University's Panel on

Radiological Hazards, a com
mittee appointed by the Uni
versity president and chaired
by Biology Prof. Philip
Hanawalt, makes the rules
governing the handling of
radioactive materials. The
Health Physics Department
administers the guidelines de
termined by the panel.
The Health Physics Depart
ment monitors safety at the
Medical Center and the Vete
rans Administration Hospital
as well as the University
proper, but SLAC has its own
team that ensures observance
of regulations from the De
partment of Energy in Oak
land.
The regulatory officials from
the government agencies con
cerned inspect procedures
here periodically, lackson, of
the Department of Energy, said
he visits SLAC about three to
six times a year, notifying them
only one day in advance.
Richard McCall, radiation
safety officer at SLAC, said,
however, that Jackson visits
only once or twice annually.
Brown, of the state Health
Department, said he inspects
the University about once a
year or year and a half.
Furthermore, the Depart
ment of Health reviews the
procedures and licenses every
few years, Brown said.
When radioactive materials
are delivered to the LJniversity,
they arrive via normal com
mercial carriers. Health Physics
personnel will inspect them for
leakage or contamination if
they are high-level sources,

Underneath the front porch of Encina Hall lurks the apparatus the
Health Physics Department uses to calibrate its radiation monitors.
This Cyclops-like device holds several radioactive sources of known
strength that can be aimed at the machinery that is being tested.
