# Soviet nuclear power program faces delays
## Less than half of generating capacity realized 
### 
The Los Angeles Times
Moscow — The Soviet Un
ion's nuclear power program,
which the government has
been counting on to ease the
increasing strain on its re
sources ot oil and other fossil
fuels, is slipping far behind
schedule.
A top Soviet official has con
firmed that two large nuclear
reactors that had been
scheduled for commissioning
in 1979 will not go into service
until the first qyarter of this
year at the earliest. Work on a
third, smaller, reactor has been
criticized in the official press in
recent days, suggesting that it,
too, failed to go into operation
on schedule.
As a result, the country's
nuclear power generating
capacity now is apparently rio
more than 11,400 megawatts —
an increase of only about 5200
megawatts over the last four
years and equal to about five
percent of Soviet electrical
generating capacity.
The Kremlin had planned to
add nearly 15,000 megawatts of
new nuclear generating capac
ity during the five-year period
ending this year. But it now ap
pears that it will be lucky to
achieve half that much growth.
The official target has been

lowered twice, but even the
latest goal, set a year ago, will
he missed by about 25 percent,
it appears.
Soviet economic planners
were counting on the buildup
of nuclear generation of elec
tricity during the period of the
nation's present five-year plan
to replace the equivalent of
one million barrels of oil a day
in conventional fuels. The elec
tricity is required to spur
economic growth, and the fai
lure to meet the nuclear
growth targets puts a major
crimp in those plans.
"They either have to lower
the planned rate of economic
growth or burn more fossil
fuels than they want to," one
Western expert here said. The
setback might also force Mos
cow to cut back on its plans to
export electrical power to its
Eastern European satellite na
tions, this expert added.
The Soviet Union's nuclear
power problems, meanwhile,
are clearly not limited to the
current five-year period. A
huge, 1600-acre factory com
plex called Atommash, de
signed to build standardized
1000-megawatt pressurized
water reactors on three parallel
assembly lines, appears to be
at least two years behind
schedule, Western experts say.

The plant is the key to the
nuclear power buildup that
was to have boosted Soviet
nuclear generating capacity by
the end of the next decade to
100,000 megawatts — nearly
nine times the present figure.
As recently as mid-1978, the
Soviets were predicting that
the first standardized Atom
mash reactor would come off
the assembly line in 1981. A re
cent Western visitor to the
complex said that otficials
there now are saying that they
will build one reactosin 1982 —
using key components pro
duced at another plant — and
none in 1983.
Those officials would not
discuss plans for 1984 and
beyond, the visitor said. The
original plan was for Atom
mash to manufacture all its
own key components and to
turn out three reactors a year
shortly after startup, with the
total gradually increasing to as
many as eight annually.
The latest Soviet nuclear
plants to be set back are at the
Voronezh nuclear complex,
about 300 miles south of Mos
cow, and another near
Sverolovsk, in the Urals about
900 miles east of the capital.
A fifth reactor at Voronezh
was originally due to go on line
at the end of 1975. After many

delays, officials said in mid
-1978 that it would begin operat
ing in 1979. However, An
dronik Petrosyants, chairman
of the state Committee on
Atomic Energy, has told the Los
Angeles Times that the unit
now is not expected to go into
service until sometime this
year.
Earlier, Petrosyants had told
a press conference at the
Soviet Academy of Sciences
that a 600-megawatt fast
breeder reactor planned at Be
loyarsk, near Sverdlovsk, is
now scheduled to go into op
eration in the first quarter of
this year. That plant — key to
the progress of an ambitious
Soviet breeder reactor prog
ram — originally was due to
start up in early 1973.
A smaller, 405-megawatt
pressurized water reactor has
also been expected to go into
operation this year near Yere
van, capital of Soviet Armenia.
However, progress on the pro
ject was criticized in the press
recently, which may indicate
setbacks there as well.
It thus appears that the
Soviets will add only 2000 to
2400 megawatts of new nuclear
capacity this year, compared
with the planned 4400

megawatts. To achieve their
nuclear targets for the next de
cade, they must build an aver
age of at least 8500 megawatts
of new capacity annually dur
ing the 1980s — an extraordi
nary pace that would probably
be unachievable even if the
Atommash facility were com
pleted on time.
Soviet officials have blamed
their atomic power setbacks on
several factors. Costs have shot
up, and nuclear specialists
admit that fast breeder reactors
have proved to be much more
complex to build than had.

new nuclear generating capac
ity during the five-year period
ending this year. But it now ap
pears that it will be lucky to
achieve half that much growth.
The official target has been

lowered twice, but even the
latest goal, set a year ago, will
he missed by about 25 percent,
it appears.
Soviet economic planners
were counting on the buildup
of nuclear generation of elec
tricity during the period of the
nation's present five-year plan
to replace the equivalent of
one million barrels of oil a day
in conventional fuels. The elec
tricity is required to spur
economic growth, and the fai
lure to meet the nuclear
growth targets puts a major
crimp in those plans.
"They either have to lower
the planned rate of economic
growth or burn more fossil
fuels than they want to," one
Western expert here said. The
setback might also force Mos
cow to cut back on its plans to
export electrical power to its
Eastern European satellite na
tions, this expert added.
The Soviet Union's nuclear
power problems, meanwhile,
are clearly not limited to the
current five-year period. A
huge, 1600-acre factory com
plex called Atommash, de
signed to build standardized
1000-megawatt pressurized
water reactors on three parallel
assembly lines, appears to be
at least two years behind
schedule, Western experts say.

The plant is the key to the
nuclear power buildup that
was to have boosted Soviet
nuclear generating capacity by
the end of the next decade to
100,000 megawatts — nearly
nine times the present figure.
As recently as mid-1978, the
Soviets were predicting that
the first standardized Atom
mash reactor would come off
the assembly line in 1981. A re
cent Western visitor to the
complex said that otficials
there now are saying that they
will build one reactosin 1982 —
using key components pro
duced at another plant — and
none in 1983.
Those officials would not
discuss plans for 1984 and
beyond, the visitor said. The
original plan was for Atom
mash to manufacture all its
own key components and to
turn out three reactors a year
shortly after startup, with the
total gradually increasing to as
many as eight annually.
The latest Soviet nuclear
plants to be set back are at the
Voronezh nuclear complex,
about 300 miles south of Mos
cow, and another near
Sverolovsk, in the Urals about
900 miles east of the capital.
A fifth reactor at Voronezh
was originally due to go on line
at the end of 1975. After many

delays, officials said in mid
-1978 that it would begin operat
ing in 1979. However, An
dronik Petrosyants, chairman
of the state Committee on
Atomic Energy, has told the Los
Angeles Times that the unit
now is not expected to go into
service until sometime this
year.
Earlier, Petrosyants had told
a press conference at the
Soviet Academy of Sciences
that a 600-megawatt fast
breeder reactor planned at Be
loyarsk, near Sverdlovsk, is
now scheduled to go into op
eration in the first quarter of
this year. That plant — key to
the progress of an ambitious
Soviet breeder reactor prog
ram — originally was due to
start up in early 1973.
A smaller, 405-megawatt
pressurized water reactor has
also been expected to go into
operation this year near Yere
van, capital of Soviet Armenia.
However, progress on the pro
ject was criticized in the press
recently, which may indicate
setbacks there as well.
It thus appears that the
Soviets will add only 2000 to
2400 megawatts of new nuclear
capacity this year, compared
with the planned 4400

megawatts. To achieve their
nuclear targets for the next de
cade, they must build an aver
age of at least 8500 megawatts
of new capacity annually dur
ing the 1980s — an extraordi
nary pace that would probably
be unachievable even if the
Atommash facility were com
pleted on time.
Soviet officials have blamed
their atomic power setbacks on
several factors. Costs have shot
up, and nuclear specialists

Moscow — The Soviet Un

which the government has
been counting on to ease the
increasing strain on its re

schedule.
A top Soviet official has con

reactors that had been

in 1979 will not go into service
until the first qyarter of this

third, smaller, reactor has been
criticized in the official press in
recent days, suggesting that it,
too, failed to go into operation
on schedule.
As a result, the country's
nuclear power generating
capacity now is apparently rio
more than 11,400 megawatts —
an increase of only about 5200
megawatts over the last four
years and equal to about five
percent of Soviet electrical
generating capacity.
