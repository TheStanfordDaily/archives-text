Hostages may suffer due to escapes
Iran's foreign minister, angered by the daring
; Canadian rescue of six Americans trapped in Tehran,
declared yesterday he expects the U.S. Embassy hos
lages to suffer for Canada's "duplicity."
The estimated 50 hostages most probably will now
be treated more harshly, Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh said, and the responsibility will be
j Canada's.
Ghotbzadeh, at a Tehran news conference, de
j nounced the secret Canadian operation as a "flagrant
violation" of international law and warned that re
tribution would be exacted from the Canadians
sooner or later.
But the Moslem militants who have held the em
i bassy and hostages for 88 days refrained from im
mediately endorsing Ghotbzadeh's threat of tougher
' conditions for their captives. Some reports quoted
militants as saying they would not treat the hostages
any differently. A State Department spokesman said
Tuesday such a reprisal would be irrational.
Meanwhile, Iran's domestic political troubles
flared into new fighting.
Reports reaching Tehran said at least 10 persons
were killed and 20 others injured yesterday in clashes
between the central regime's revolutionary guards
and Kurdish militants in western Iran.
The official Iranian news agency said two army of
ficers held hostage since Monday by unidentified
insurgents in the Kurdish town of Salmas were killed.
The six Americans who escaped Iran with the help
of the Canadian embassy returned to the United
States yesterday, Air Force officials said.
Carter won't defend Caribbean
Washington — President |immy Carter says he sees
no outside threat to the Caribbean are and therefore
will not promise to use military force to defend it.
Carter thus declined to place the neighboring
Caribbean in the same "vital interest" category as the
Persian Gulf. He also asserted that the United States
would not be able, now or in the future, to defend the
Persian Gulf area by itself.
The president made the statements Tuesday in a
question and answer session with visiting editors and
broadcasters. The White House released a transcript
on the session yesterday.
Asked if "we do indeed have what it takes militar
ily" to redeem his pledge to repel any Soviet threat to
the Persian Gulf area, Carter said:

"I don't think it would be accurate for me to claim that
at this time, or in the future, we expect to have
enough military strength and enough military pre
sence there to defend the region unilaterally."
U.S. favors alternate Olympics
Washington — The Carter administration wants to
make sure American athletes can show their skills but
dot*> not want the United States to be the site of an
alternative to the Moscow Olympic games, a con
gressional panel was told yesterday.
Nelson Ledsky, deputy assistant secretary of state
for congressional relations, said, "We want our
athletes to be able to compete. They have worked
very hard, often tor years, to perfect their skills."
But he also said the administration is determined
that the Soviet Union must withdraw its military
forces from Afghanistan or face a refusal by the Un
ited States to take part in the competition."
"The United States would favor organizing some
form of alternate games in the fall or summer of
1980," he said.
"We will join as appropriate in working with other
governments to organize such alternative games,"
Ledsky said, adding:
"Our preference is that such games not be held in
the United States. ... At the same time, the United
States would be ready if necessary to host such
games."
Oil price hike could hurt economy
Washington — Another sharp increase in world oil
prices could seriously worsen the already gloomy
outlook for the nation's economy this year, President
jimmy Carter and his advisers said yesterday.
In addition, the president said inflation almost cer
tainly will be worse if workers try to recover all of the
increase in last year's energy costs through higher
wages this year.
"The most immediate problem in 1980 is to ensure
that last year's sharp increase in energy prices does
not result in a new siral of price and wage increases
that would worsen the underlying inflation rate tor
many years to come," Carter said in his annual
economic report to Congress.
The report repeated the administration's forecasts
of a mild recession in the first half of 1980 with un
employment rising to 7.5 percent and consumer
prices increasing 10.4 percent this year and 8.6 per

cent in 1981. Prices increased 13.3 percent last year.
Those forecasts assume world oil prices will in
crease only slightly more than the rate of inflation, or
not much more than 10 percent. The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting (OPEC) countries doubled its
price in the past 12 months.
In addition, Saudi Arabia and several other oil pro
ducers announced new increases in their oil prices of
about 8 percent just this week.
13 killed in winter storms
A winter storm that left Southern California mired
in mud and some Western states buried under
knee-deep snow pushed into the nation's midsection
yesterday, spreading treacherous ice into Dixie.
Hundreds of schools closed, lights went out and
cars slammed together as the storm that produced
Utah's heaviest snowfall in six years pushed intg Kan
sas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Il
linois, Tennessee and northern Alabama.
In Southern California, where five people died in
earlier rainstorms, mud was 10 feet deep on one
street in San Bernardino and overflow from a dam in
neighboring Tijuana, Mexico, flooded parts of San
Diego, drowning 15 horses. A mudslide in the Los
Angeles suburb of Malibu blocked the northbound
lanes of the Pacific Coast Highway.
