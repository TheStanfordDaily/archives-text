## Physicist suggests plan Colonies in space urged 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
Colonization of massive
space satellites and the collec
tion of solar energy in space
should be the answers to some
of this planet's most pressing
problems, according to physi
cist Gerard O'Neill, director of
the Space Studies Institute,
Princeton University.
The human condition is mov
ing toward increasing poverty,
overpopulation, scarcity of re
sources and warfare, O'Neill
said here Tuesday. In outlining
the necessity of space coloni
zation to more than 600 listen
ers in Memorial Auditorium,
the featured speaker of the
Space Symposium predicted,
"One solution is a static soci
ety; and there would be one
final, knockdown war to see
who would run that society."
With the help of films and
slides, the "father of space
colonization" attempted to
persuade the audience that
"space can free us."
O'Neill's bestselling book,
The High Frontier, which de
scribes in layman's terms how
space colonies might be estab
lished, won the Phi Beta Kappa
award for best non-fiction pub
lication in 1977. In scientific
and popular articles, in lec
tures and on television talk
shows, O'Neill has become the
strongest advocate of space
colonization.
Environmentally controlled
space stations, complete with
mountains, fauna and flora,
and solar power stations could
be built within 10 to 15 years,
according to O'Neill. All would
be powered by solar energy
cells and constructed ' from
materials and metals gathered
from the moon and asteroids.
Solar potential
"Solar energy is quite con
stant and reliable outside the
shadow of the earth," O'Neill
said. Also, lunar soil and as
teroids have proven rich in
iron, aluminum, silicon,
titanium, and oxygen — mate
rials he said are "fine if you
want to make solar cells."

All the required materials to
colonize space are located "in
our own back yard," O'Neill
commented. "It we don't do
it,"he said of space coloniza
tion feasibility, "someone elst
will."
Central to O'Neill's plans is
the development of the mass
driver reaction engine, a
space-age mining machine to
aid in the extraction and trans
portation of metals necessary
forsohrcell building. Working
models of the mass driver,
which operates on Newton's
principle of action and reac
tion, have been constructed.
O'Neill showed films of the
engine models, including one
which shot a payload bucket
out with an acceleration from
zero to 250 miles per hour in
one-fourtieth of a second.
Based on the findings of a joint
Princeton-Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology program,
O'Neill claims that such a de
vice, once installed in the vac
uum of space, could transport
700 tons of ore at a time.
Large colonies
The first persons to inhabit
any space station would be
"repair and maintenance per
sons" in O'Neill's view. But la
ter, tens of thousands or even
millions might inhabit the
space stations.
The most efficient colonies
would be small, autonomous
villages with 10,000 inhabitants
each, he said. He called them
"crystal palace habitats" and
said, "that's my idea of the fu
ture — what I 'd like to leave my
children."
Although the colonization of
space might seem grander in
scale, O'Neill said he was less
sure about the possibility of re
laying energy back to earth
from solar power stations col
lecting the sun's energy out
side this planet's atmosphere.
Citing an estimated research
and development cost of six to
10 billion dollars for coloniza
tion projects, about the same
as the cost of the Alaska
pipeline, O'Neill said the Un
ited States is not moving fast
enough toward space de

velopment. "The Russians are
investing in it,"he quipped,
"and the Russians, obviously,
have a long term commitment
to expansion."
Solar energy collected in
space would be converted into
"low density microwaves" by
the orbiting stations. That
energy would then be sent
down to earth, he said.
In a panel discussion, Dr.
John Billingham, director of
NASA's Life Sciences Divisions
at Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, questioned
O'Neill about the problems of
radiation, particularly prob
lems caused by the unknown
effects of cosmic rays on
biological systems.
O'Neill, who has also
worked at Ames, responded
that, "all of the designs we've
been working on have shells
thick enough to equal the at
mosphere of the earth."
