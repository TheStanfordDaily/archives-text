# Senate votes for meeting on draft
## 
### Fran Miller 
The ASSU Senate voted last
night to co-sponsor a public
meeting on Feb. 12 to discuss
draft registration.
"The purpose of this meet
ing is to stimulate discussion
and increase the general know
ledge of the issues concerning
and the reinstatement of a re
gistration process," the resolu
tion stated.
The senate also voted to
postpone further action on
draft registration until a stu
dent opinion poll has been
taken through the registrar's
office. The poll will ask stu
dents if they support or oppose
draft registration and the draft.
Up to $150 was allocated to
the poll, and an additional
funding up to $100 was ap
proved for the public discus
sion. A meeting will be held
Friday at noon in the ASSU of
fice to plan the event.
Also at last night's meeting
guest speaker Jim Lyons, dean
of student affairs, discussed
housing and other student is
sues.
Lyons began by explaining
plans for the new on-campus
housing facilities. He said they
should bring supply and de
mand for housing into equilib
rium.
Lyons said that after new
housing is available, the frater
nities will no longer have a
quota system, under which the
fraternities must take their
share of undergraduate males.
This would force fraternities
to find new ways of attracting
members, Lyons said, because
male students would no longer
join simply to have a place to
live.
Lyons also said the new
housing would allow for ex
perimentation in breaking the

barriers between graduate and
undergraduate students here.
Earlier at the meeting, the
senate voted to support the in
clusion of a student activities
center in the plans for the new
complex.
Lyons commented that he
was "a little surprised that
some sororities haven't been
recognized yet," but said rec
ognition for some is "right
around the corner."
Lyons said that although he
feels good about the Universi
ty's ability to attract minority
students, there are "questions
of social policy which are not
being addressed."
When questioned by Senate
Chair Mark Breier about a
student-run Tresidder, Lyons
said that "with a sweep of a pen
you can involve students." It
would be up to the union
board and various student
groups such as the Coffee
House Task Force to address
the concerns, he said.
In other business, the senate
allocated funds to the Con
sumers Affairs Bureau, a new
consumer "hotline," the
Asian-American Theater Pro
ject and the Graduate
Philosophy Association.
Council of Presidents (COP)
member Mary Leßlanc re
ported that she and Deputy
Chair Yvonne Hiltz are forming
a task force to investigate the
hiring and tenure of female
professors here and encour
aged senate support.
Aflernate Sen. Julie Johnson
announced that the athletic
survey on the use of recrea
tional facilities here will be dis
tributed to various dorms at
random next week. According
to Johnson, a booth will be set
up in White Plaza to encourage
greater student participation in
the survey.
