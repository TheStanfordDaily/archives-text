# University housing secure
## Anti-fire devices installed 
### Todd Pickett 
In an effort to minimize the
potential risksoffireincampus
residences, University and
local fire officials are nearing
completion of numerous fire
prevention improvements in
21 Row houses and three dor
mitories: Roble, Branner and
Toyon.
Over the past 10 months,
most attention has been di
rected toward Roble, the old
est of the three.
According to Palo Alto De
puty Fire Marshall Peter Irish,
the most common and poten
tially dangerous hazard arises
when fire doors are propped
open (a misdemeanor by law),
making them unable tocontain
a blaze. To eliminate this prob
lem, electromagnetic
doorholders have been instal
led in many of the residences.
These devices consist of a
small metal box attached to the
wall, which holds the door

open by means of a magnetic
current received by a metal at
tachment on the door. When
the fire alarm is activated, the
magnetic current shuts off and
the door is allowed to fall shut.
In Roble alone over 35 of
these doorholders have been
installed along with high
powered lights over the exits
and a number of new fire
doors.
Exits
Much of the concern over
this 62-year-old structure in
volves the 100 or so students
who inhabit its third floor,
making efficient emergency
exiting a necessity. "Adequate
fire exits are essential," said
Irish, "for it is during evacua
tion that most injuries occur."
The construction of addi
tional fire doors on the second
and third floors allows stu
dents in the upper floors to
evacuate safely down the back
exits. In addition to these pre
cautionary measures, crews of
firemen are making regular vis

its to Roble, planning the most
effective means of battling a
fire should one occur.
Some Roble residents admit
to being somewhat suspicious
about the amount of attention
the dorm is receiving; how
ever, most agree that they feel
a little more secure because of
the work being done.
Responsibilities
Although extensive precau
tions are being taken by the
University to protect its stu
dents from damage and injury,
the most responsibility lies
with the students themselves.
"Unfortunately, " said Irish,
"among students there is an
ignorance of fire prevention
which is completely unwar
ranted in a center of education
like Stanford."
"Irish suggested that stu
dents be particularly careful
with smoking materials, as that
is the cause of one-third of all
fires. Furthermore, tampering
with the fire doors and alarms
is prohibited
