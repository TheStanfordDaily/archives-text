Saving energy at Stanford can be achieved in many ways: from the
highly technical methods, such as Karl Johnson's electric car (top), to
the more simple and pragmatic, such as the solar heating process
employed in Columbae House (bottom). The water-filled barrels col
lect heat during the day, then re-radiate it at night, saving on heating
costs.
