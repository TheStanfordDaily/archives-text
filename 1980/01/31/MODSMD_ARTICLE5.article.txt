# Energy and the Stanford administration:
## 'Savings in energy means savings in money' Conservation center leads 'grassroots' effort here 
### Joan O'Connell 
A hallway illuminated only
by the light from an open door
leads to room 33, Crothers
Hall. Turning into the office,
one confronts the silhouette of
Karl Johnson, his face lost in
the glaring backlight of the
window behind his desk . . .
the only afternoon light source
for the small room.
But as one's eyes become
accustomed to the dim light,
the stenciled letters on a
mound of charts and posters
identify the mysterious office:
the University's Energy Con
servation Center (ECC).
Perhaps it is only right that
the ECC should operate in such
a setting, a symbolic reminder
of both the need to conserve
and also the behind-the
! scenes efforts which leave
many observers "in the dark"
as to the actual energy policies
| and programs here.
lohnson, director of the ECC,
and his part-time staff are best
| labeled the "grass-roots" ef
forts of a University energy
program which winds its way
upward through various ad
ministrative ranks, ultimately
overseen by Vice-President for
Business and Finance William
Massy.
This link to business and fi
nance becomes the key to any
study of energy conservation
on campus. It soon becomes
obvious to the curious inves

tigator that energy conserva
tion receives high priority
status here for one simple
reason: A savings in energy
represents a savings in money.
The ECC appears to be the
University's most visible com
mitment to energy reduction
on campus, Johnson, a 30-year
old graduate in product design
and mechanical engineering,
runs what he calls a "commun
ity outreach" program, attack
ing people's "personal habits
(not turning off lights,
appliances) which produce
waste in energy."
He estimates that lighting
constitutes about 40 percent of
the University's total electricity
use, and that a 10 percent re
duction could save $150,000 a
year.
The ECC, working under the
authority of the Housing and
Food Services Department, is
responsible for the energy-use
charts in the dorms, distribut
ing posters and leaflets, and
preparing film presentations
concerning energy waste.
lohnson said that energy
conservation is currently re
ceiving a fairly high amount of
attention from the administra
tion, although he still thinks it
should be "much more of a
priority."
lohnson said, "The '80s is the
decade of energy and resource
conservation. The effects of
not doing it in the '70s will
show up in the '80s." But he

also indicated that the main
reason energy is important
here is economic.
"Inflation is not going to lift"
for the Housing and Food Ser
vices Department, Johnson
said. Because Housing and
Food services is "financially
timeless," that is, it supports
itself from room and board
fees, as energy rates increase,
there will be no additional
source of income for the de
partment unless those fees are
raised.
Hence, unless energy con
sumption in the student resi
dences decreases, room and

hoard rates will rise propor
tionately with energy costs, he
said.
The ECC's main function is
working with students to in
crease energy awareness and
conservation, but lohnson de
nied that Stanford is "laying
the burden" of conservation
on students while using
energy on a more massive scale
in heating and other systems.
However, he said he sees why
students might say, "Hell,
I'm not going to put out all this
effort if the University won't
even fix the damn heating sys
tem," he said.

To learn more about exactly
what the University is doing on
a large scale to conserve means
entering yet another office, al
though this one is easier to find
and certainly better lit. On the
second floor of the Old Pavil
ion is the office of Energy Prog
ram Manager, Linda Weisberg.
While Johnson perhaps has
the most contact with the
academic community in
energy-related concerns,
Weisberg works with six other
administrative departments
under Facilities and Services,
including Utilities, Engineer
