# Energy and the Stanford administration:
## 'Savings in energy means savings in money' Conservation center leads 'grassroots' effort here 
### Joan O'Connell 
A hallway illuminated only
by the light from an open door
leads to room 33, Crothers
Hall. Turning into the office,
one confronts the silhouette of
Karl Johnson, his face lost in
the glaring backlight of the
window behind his desk . . .
the only afternoon light source
for the small room.
But as one's eyes become
accustomed to the dim light,
the stenciled letters on a
mound of charts and posters
identify the mysterious office:
the University's Energy Con
servation Center (ECC).
Perhaps it is only right that
the ECC should operate in such
a setting, a symbolic reminder
of both the need to conserve
and also the behind-the
! scenes efforts which leave
many observers "in the dark"
as to the actual energy policies
| and programs here.
lohnson, director of the ECC,
and his part-time staff are best
| labeled the "grass-roots" ef
forts of a University energy
program which winds its way
upward through various ad
ministrative ranks, ultimately
overseen by Vice-President for
Business and Finance William
Massy.
This link to business and fi
nance becomes the key to any
study of energy conservation
on campus. It soon becomes
obvious to the curious inves

tigator that energy conserva
tion receives high priority
status here for one simple
reason: A savings in energy
represents a savings in money.
The ECC appears to be the
University's most visible com
mitment to energy reduction
on campus, Johnson, a 30-year
old graduate in product design
and mechanical engineering,
runs what he calls a "commun
ity outreach" program, attack
ing people's "personal habits
(not turning off lights,
appliances) which produce
waste in energy."
He estimates that lighting
constitutes about 40 percent of
the University's total electricity
use, and that a 10 percent re
duction could save $150,000 a
year.
The ECC, working under the
authority of the Housing and
Food Services Department, is
responsible for the energy-use
charts in the dorms, distribut
ing posters and leaflets, and
preparing film presentations
concerning energy waste.
lohnson said that energy
conservation is currently re
ceiving a fairly high amount of
attention from the administra
tion, although he still thinks it
should be "much more of a
priority."
lohnson said, "The '80s is the
decade of energy and resource
conservation. The effects of
not doing it in the '70s will
show up in the '80s." But he

also indicated that the main
reason energy is important
here is economic.
"Inflation is not going to lift"
for the Housing and Food Ser
vices Department, Johnson
said. Because Housing and
Food services is "financially
timeless," that is, it supports
itself from room and board
fees, as energy rates increase,
there will be no additional
source of income for the de
partment unless those fees are
raised.
Hence, unless energy con
sumption in the student resi
dences decreases, room and

hoard rates will rise propor
tionately with energy costs, he
said.
The ECC's main function is
working with students to in
crease energy awareness and
conservation, but lohnson de
nied that Stanford is "laying
the burden" of conservation
on students while using
energy on a more massive scale
in heating and other systems.
However, he said he sees why
students might say, "Hell,
I'm not going to put out all this
effort if the University won't
even fix the damn heating sys
tem," he said.

To learn more about exactly
what the University is doing on
a large scale to conserve means
entering yet another office, al
though this one is easier to find
and certainly better lit. On the
second floor of the Old Pavil
ion is the office of Energy Prog
ram Manager, Linda Weisberg.
While Johnson perhaps has
the most contact with the
academic community in
energy-related concerns,
Weisberg works with six other
administrative departments
under Facilities and Services,
including Utilities, Engineer

Ihis electrical sub-station is located on Panama Street across from Roble Gym at the end of the High Energy
Physics Lab. Campus sub-stations like this transform large amounts of electricity, reducing it to more usable
ing, Building Maintenance,
Procurement, Facilities and
Housing.
She was hi red over a year ago
to "pick up" what had been a
rather informal energy prog
ram. Stanford's initial focus on
the energy crisis began in 1973
during the first oil embargo
and achieved fairly substantial
energy reductions until about
1975, according to Weisberg.
Up to 1975, energy consump
tion in some dorms had drop
ped as much as 30 percent and
the "winter shut-down" pol
icy, which closed dorms over
the Christmas break, began.
From 1975 through 1978, how
ever, prices stabilized and
"flattened" and consumption
began to rise.
Weisberg, a former energy
consultant for a Boston man
agement consulting firm, was
hired by William Massy to basi
cally revamp the program. In
the year and a halt since she
was hired, Weisberg and her
staff have been "consciously
behind the scenes,, collect
ing missing data and doing
studies on the energy use of
campus facilities.
Her work has resulted in a
complicated report citing

costs, research data, new prog
rams and methods of lowering
energy consumption. But once
again the bottom line is
economics.
The energy program seeks to
keep "the rate of growth of
purchased electricity and gas
costs equal to the rate of
growth of the operating
budget" over the next three
years, according to the report.
"The difference in total out
lay for purchased gas and elec-

tricity represented by this
three year effort," it continues,
"would be $2,164,000.
Currently over 50 percent of
the University's operating
budget is supported by student
tuition and tees, the rest from
investment income, a small
percentage from research
grants and profits from campus
stores.
For the fiscal year 79-80, the
forecast is that $6,803,000 will

be spent on purchased utility
costs: a 3.3 percent increase in
consumption, but a 25.4 per
cent increase in utility rates
trom '78-'79 through'79-'BO.
According to Weisberg, the
j first step in studying energy
related questions at Stanford is
to divide "energy consump
tion" into three areas: produc
tion, distribution and end-use.
Production of Stanford's
energy, (which, by the way,
does not include SLAC), comes

Hence, unless energy consumption in student
residences decreases, room and board rates
will rise proportionately with energy costs.

from basically three sources:
the steam plant, the chilled
water plant, and the on
campus electricity sub-station.
Natural gas is used to create
the steam utilized in heating,
while electricity cools the
water used tor air condition
ing.
Energy is distributee) by the
central power plant.
The energy used in the build
ings themselves — both hous-

ing and academic — comes
under Weisberg's heading of
"end-use."
At the present time, accord
ing to Weisberg, reducing
energy consumption in
academic buildings is a target
area for the program. In the
academic buildings, the
purchased utility costs are ex
pected to rise from $3.1 million
to $3.9 million in end-use costs
from '78-79 to '79-' BO.
In the past, upgrading the
steam plant has actually re
sulted in the single-biggest sav
ings in energy consumption.
The University does appear
to be doing its part to reduce
energy consumption on a large
scale.
"Since 1973," said Weisberg,
"there has been a much larger
reduction in energy use at the
primary sources — production
and distribution — than in
end-use."
According to the energy
program's "Summary of
energy conservation programs
to date," the largest expendi
tures in this area, more than $2
million, have been spent to
"improve the efficiency in the
production, distribution and
recovery of energy."
Projects have included mod

ifications in the steam plant
and distribution systems, and
the conversion to a central chil
led water facility. Also in each
of these areas has evolved the
practice of metering the sys
tem — detined as "developing
! a database of consumption," it
is listed as one ot the primary
goals tor the '79-' BO period.
Each proposed, energy
related project is evaluated on
the basis of savings value, im
plementation cost and payback
period. The payback period for
these projects, the time in
which the University can re
coup its initial expenditure, is
often surprisingly short. Form
stance, the improvement ot
air-handling and temperature
controls in the Graduate
School of Business will cost
$134,000. It is estimated to
save $72,000 per year in energy
costs and so the payback
period is 1.9 years.
"Projects with payback
periods ot less than three years
are usually routinely ap
proved," said Weisberg.
"We are trying through per
manent changes to technically
modify the buildings so
programs are not harmed, but
energy is saved," she said ot
the program's project policies.
Weisberg explained that the
energy program itself does not
have the power to enforce its
energy policies over other
campus departments. In most
cases, she explained, energy
savings is weighed against
safety, comfort, aesthetics and
most importantly, whether it
affects "teaching or research in
any way.
"We don't tell a department
'turn off the light,' " she said,
"We hope to create an incen
tive whereby people will be
more energy aware."
One source, who asked not
to be identified, mentioned
another economic considera
tion which might affect the im
plementation of Stanford's
energy policies. Individuals or
departments which bring in a
high amount of money for the
University often can influence
the kind of work done. "For
instance, energy-saving lights
could be installed in offices,
but if some doctor in the Med
Center didn't like them, out
they would go," the source
said.

Once again, Weisberg saw
the role of the program as
"public awareness so that each
individual can take their small
action," she said.
One of the most important
developments in the energy
program is a reorganization
which, according to Weisberg,
is seeking increased cohesive
ness between the six other de
partments under Facilities and
Services.
A problem in the past has
been a lack of communication
between the various depart
ments, resulting in projects
and repairs carried out with no
concern for energy conserva
tion.
"It (energy) is a tunny beast
with fingers in a lot ot pots,"
said Weisberg.
This same "finger"analogy
was also used by Facilities
Coordinator Lucille Maravilla
who agreed that the different
departments were sometimes
like "tingers without a hand"
when it comes to energy con
cerns.
" There is no one central au
thority; it takes a lot ot people
to come to a decision . There is
a lot of bureaucracy involved,"

j she said.
"We try to make it a practice
to involve the energy people,
but a part of it is education.
They've got to let us know
1 about an account (project) that
should take energy conserva
tion into account," she said.
One of Maravilla's most re
cent projects was there

lamping of Meyer Library with
energy-efficient, Watt-Miser
lamps. In the project, she was
able to involve Weisberg and
the energy program. But she
described another project, re
pairs on one of the Stauffer
chemical labs, where "energy
wasn't even a consideration,
their lights went out, and we just

went in and fixed them."
Maravilla said she felt that
the lack of standards for light
ing, such as a specific number
of footcandles which would be
energy-efficient for a specific
building, is an obstacle in try
ing to conserve energy, espe
cially in repairs.

Weisberg answered this
charge by explaining that there
presently is not enough infor
mation to make standards pos
sible. "We need a better un
derstanding about what hap
pens in buildings" before they
can set those kinds of stan
dards, " she said.
Facilities Engineer Bill
Macomber also discounted a
common theory that simply by
"turning down the thermostat
in a building you can expect to
save energy," he said.
"It takes energy to maintain a
space at other than the outside
temperature," he said. Drop
ping the thermostat can otten
result in activating the cooling
system and no energy is saved.
In fact, former President Ni
xon's plan to turn down ther
mostats in 1974 actually
ended up using more energy
and costing more money in this
area, Macomber said.
Macomber is currently work
ing on a project to redo the
heating system ot the Graduate
School ot Business. "It's not
tunctioning — (it's) over
cooling and under-heating,"
he said.
"We're attempting to meet
academia's needs and at the
same time prevent wasteful
temperatures," he added.
But "meeting academia's
needs'' takes money, and the
GSB project is no exception.
The energy program has
applied to the Department ot

Energy (DOE) for matching
tunds to complete the poten
tially energy-conserving pro
ject.
The study on the building
which pinpointed the
problems and the measures
needed to correct them, cost
$40,000 alone. "It takes a lot ot
money to get that money"
(from the DOE) said Weisberg.
"It took $.3500 just to prepare
the application (a thick, two
volume report)," she said.
. . which could have been
denied," added Macomber.
There can be no doubt that
Stanford's Energy Conserva
tion Program is commanding
the attention of the administra
tion, especially in the face of
the $2 million which stands to
be saved if the plan is success
ful.
"Saving energy is the best
investment you can make with
your dollars," said Weisberg.
