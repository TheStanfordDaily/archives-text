# Human 'energy cell' works to promote conservation here
## 
### Dianne Cahoon 
Karl Johnson may not be the
best-known man among the
students here, but he is cer
tainly one of the most influen
tial. In his attempts to trans
form people here into
energy-conscious beings, he
has laden the student popula
tion with, among other things,
new showerheads and solar
heating units.
As director of the Energy
Conservation Center (ECC)
and energy consultant to the
Planning Office, Johnson is the
driving force behind almost all
University conservation ef
forts, particularly those con
cerning student housing and
food services.
Johnson, a compact, bearded
energy cell in himself, spends
much of his time putting
around campus in his electric
car or submerged in the unlit
depths of the ECC office in
Crothers Memorial Hall. He
stepped into his current posi
tion after receiving a 1976 Stan
ford bachelor's degree in pro
duct design and mechanical
engineering.
"I was project manager for
Engineering 235, Energy Alter
natives for Stanford, and one
of the energy managers on
campus called me," he said.
"So in November, 1976 I
started work for him."
The following spring, he
started a pilot energy conserva
tion project in the Lagunita
dormitories which resulted in a
33 percent annual savings in
electrical use. That initial prog
ram expanded to the Florence
Moore complex, and Johnson
opened the ECC in the fall of
1977 to oversee the energy
utilization of dorms and
cafeterias.
Joined this year in the ECC
operation by John Eaton,
another University graduate,

Johnson's primary concern is
educating students to use
energy more efficiently and
sparingly. He emphasizes
minor modifications in day
to-day life, such as turning off
lights to reduce energy con
sumption.
"The small personal things
are the things that make us
(Americans) use 50 percent
more energy than any other
people," he said. Lights com
prise 30 to 40 percent of all
electricity use. By replacing
one higher-watt bulb for two
bulbs, the ECC saved 20 to 30
percent in energy costs in
dorms, Johnson said.
To spark personal interest in
conservation measures, the
ECC began a public awareness
campaign last year. About six
students employed by the ECC
visit each dorm in the fall to
inform students about ways to
fight spiraling energy costs
and, in effect, save themselves
even higher room and tuition
payments.
Johnson estimates that the
ECC has saved between 17 and
20 percent in electricity in un
dergraduate residences in the
past year by posting monthly
electric meter readings.
Johnson attributes this savings
to the charts, which provide di
rect feedback on energy use.
The savings is a reduction of
about one million kilowatts, or
$50,000 per year, he said.
Funded by the University
Housing and Food Services of
fice, the ECC has embarked on
several short-term payback
construction projects. Last
year's infamous showerhead
switch idea originated in
Johnson's office.
That highly-touted affair has
"made a tremendous differ
ence," according to Johnson,
by saving up to $100,000 per
year in heating and water (40
million gallons), or an equiva

lent energy decrease of 3.5
million pounds of coal.
In retrospect, lohnson said
that the showerhead undertak
ing taught him that people
don't like change. "But we
would have lost tens of
thousands of dollars if we had
waited until summer to imple
ment that change," he said.
Two summers ago, groupsof
students led by the ECC insu
lated 130,000 square feet of re
sidences' attics at an estimated
savings of $2000 per year. The
project involved 40 hours a
week of student labor, coordi
nation and direction, which
grew out of one of )ohnson's
SWOPSI classes. "That was
nice in that we could provide
on-campus jobs," lohnson
said of the project. "We saved
the University money as well as
involving people."
The Roth House solar project
also derived from a SWOPSI
course. The 171 square foot
domestic hot water solar col
lectors now supply 30 percent
of the house's hot water.
Last summer the ECC insu
lated campus hot water pipes
at a cost of $1300 and a savings
of $600 per year. "That's
great!" exclaimed Eaton. "Af
ter two years, you're almost
making money."
Overall, lohnson surmised
that the ECC projects save
close to four times their operat
ing costs. On top of that,
lohnson just finished negotiat
ing a $1.2 million federal Hous
ing and Urban Development
(HUD) loan for the ECC, to be
paid back at 3 percent over 40
years.
lohnson said his pipe dream
for years has been the inven
tion of solar cells for electric
cars. If energy researchers are
as eager and vigorous as
lohnson, that dream may not
remain unfulfilled for long.

domestic hot water solar col
lectors now supply 30 percent
of the house's hot water.
Last summer the ECC insu
lated campus hot water pipes
at a cost of $1300 and a savings
of $600 per year. "That's
great!" exclaimed Eaton. "Af
ter two years, you're almost
making money."
Overall, lohnson surmised
that the ECC projects save
close to four times their operat
ing costs. On top of that,
lohnson just finished negotiat
ing a $1.2 million federal Hous
ing and Urban Development
(HUD) loan for the ECC, to be
paid back at 3 percent over 40
years.
lohnson said his pipe dream
for years has been the inven
tion of solar cells for electric
cars. If energy researchers are
as eager and vigorous as
lohnson, that dream may not
remain unfulfilled for long.

K.irl Johnson stands atop the roof of Roth House where, in collabora
tion with his SWOPSI course in 1978, he constructed the solar panels
seen in the background.
Karl Johnson may not be the
best-known man among the
students here, but he is cer
tainly one of the most influen
tial. In his attempts to trans
form people here into
energy-conscious beings, he
has laden the student popula
tion with, among other things,
new showerheads and solar
heating units.
As director of the Energy
Conservation Center (ECC)
and energy consultant to the
Planning Office, Johnson is the
driving force behind almost all
University conservation ef
forts, particularly those con
cerning student housing and
food services.
Johnson, a compact, bearded
energy cell in himself, spends
much of his time putting
around campus in his electric
car or submerged in the unlit
depths of the ECC office in
Crothers Memorial Hall. He
stepped into his current posi
tion after receiving a 1976 Stan
ford bachelor's degree in pro
duct design and mechanical
engineering.
"I was project manager for
Engineering 235, Energy Alter
natives for Stanford, and one
of the energy managers on
campus called me," he said.
"So in November, 1976 I
started work for him."
The following spring, he
started a pilot energy conserva
tion project in the Lagunita
dormitories which resulted in a
33 percent annual savings in
electrical use. That initial prog
ram expanded to the Florence
Moore complex, and Johnson
opened the ECC in the fall of
1977 to oversee the energy
utilization of dorms and
cafeterias.
Joined this year in the ECC
operation by John Eaton,
another University graduate,

Johnson's primary concern is
educating students to use
energy more efficiently and
sparingly. He emphasizes
minor modifications in day
to-day life, such as turning off
lights to reduce energy con
sumption.
"The small personal things
are the things that make us
(Americans) use 50 percent
more energy than any other
people," he said. Lights com
prise 30 to 40 percent of all
electricity use. By replacing
one higher-watt bulb for two
bulbs, the ECC saved 20 to 30
percent in energy costs in
dorms, Johnson said.
To spark personal interest in
conservation measures, the
ECC began a public awareness
campaign last year. About six
students employed by the ECC
visit each dorm in the fall to
inform students about ways to
fight spiraling energy costs
and, in effect, save themselves
even higher room and tuition
payments.
Johnson estimates that the
ECC has saved between 17 and
20 percent in electricity in un
dergraduate residences in the
past year by posting monthly
electric meter readings.
Johnson attributes this savings
to the charts, which provide di
rect feedback on energy use.
The savings is a reduction of
about one million kilowatts, or
$50,000 per year, he said.
Funded by the University
Housing and Food Services of
fice, the ECC has embarked on
several short-term payback
construction projects. Last
year's infamous showerhead
switch idea originated in
Johnson's office.
That highly-touted affair has
"made a tremendous differ
ence," according to Johnson,
by saving up to $100,000 per
year in heating and water (40
million gallons), or an equiva

lent energy decrease of 3.5
million pounds of coal.
In retrospect, lohnson said
that the showerhead undertak
ing taught him that people
don't like change. "But we
would have lost tens of
thousands of dollars if we had
waited until summer to imple
ment that change," he said.
Two summers ago, groupsof
students led by the ECC insu
lated 130,000 square feet of re
sidences' attics at an estimated
savings of $2000 per year. The
project involved 40 hours a
week of student labor, coordi
nation and direction, which
grew out of one of )ohnson's
SWOPSI classes. "That was
nice in that we could provide
on-campus jobs," lohnson
said of the project. "We saved
the University money as well as
involving people."
The Roth House solar project
also derived from a SWOPSI
course. The 171 square foot

lectors now supply 30 percent
