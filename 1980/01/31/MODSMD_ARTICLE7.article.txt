## Energy Forum Theresa Simons Independents' role crucial 
### 
Most Americans are up in
arms over gas shortages and
high prices. Some blame this
situation on the mammoth oil
companies. Others attribute
the dilemma to the greed of
OPEC.
However, one of the most
important suppliers of our oil
and natural gas receives virtu
ally no attention in most dis
cussions of the energy prob
lem. These suppliers are the
independent oil companies
which produce one-third of
the total crude oil and natural
gas.
They financeBo percent of all
wells and about 90 percent of
all exploratory wells in the U.S.
Though the independents'
role in energy production is ex
tremely important, they are
supplying only a fraction of
what they could under more
favorable political and
economic conditions. Right
now, there are half as many in
dependent producers as the
20,000 that were in operation in
1956.
Significantly, all the de
creases in petroleum explora
tion in the United States that
have occurred since 1957 are
directly attributable to the re
duced activity of independent
producers. This is because the
small scale on which indepen
dents operate makes their ac
tivities much more susceptible
to small changes in their ex
penses, in taxes or in regula
tions.
For example, independents
operate most of the 369,000
stripper wells in this country.
Stripper wells produce an av
erage of 10 barrels a day. While
total stripper production con
stitutes 14 percent of domestic
supply, strippers are easily ren
dered uneconomical by a
small change in prices. If strip
per oil were not exempt from
price controls, most stripper
wells would be forced off pro
duction.
The independent producer
is a price taker, but his price

setter is not the market. It is the
government.
The great price squeeze that
has resulted from artificially
low, government-set energy
prices has plagued the inde
pendents since 1954 and is the
primary reason that half of the
independent producers have
left the business since then.
A common myth is that the
United States is running out of
oil and gas reserves. In fact,
while "proved" reserves
(crude oil recoverable with
reasonable certainty under
existing economic and operat
ing conditions) are predicted
to last about 10 more years, es
timates of "potential" crude oil
resources indicate adequate
domestic supplies for between
82 and 130 years.
The energy problem is not
yet one of resources. It is one
of economics. Given today's
oil and gas prices, about half of
the the U.S. petroleum re
source base, and one-sixth of
the natural gas resource base
falls into the category of "sub

economic" old and new fields.
This means that although the
reserves have been found and
the companies have the
technology to develop them,
low prices render production
unprofitable, and therefore it
does not take place.
Generally, independents
have established an aggressive
plowing back, on the average,
of more than 100 percent of
their gross revenues to pro
duce more oil and gas. But
fewer revenues means less
production. To the extent that
revenues are reduced , less in
vestment occurs and con
sequently, less energy is
supplied.
To a large degree, govern
ment intervention is the cause
of our energy problems. Taxes
and price controls have hin
dered the free marketing of
energy for 20 years, and
neither the consumers nor the
producers have benefitted as a
result.
