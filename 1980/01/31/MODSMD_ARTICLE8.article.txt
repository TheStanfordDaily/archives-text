## EMB menaces earth 
### 
Does the thought of oil dril
ling just offshore a scenic
coastline, or a nuclear power
plant situated on an ear
thquake fault, make you stop
and wonder? Vou may be se
eing many more of these
"wonders" in the near future.
Energy developers and en
vironmentalists have long
been pitted against each other,
in open confrontation over the
question of how best to satisfy
our energy appetite without
seriously degrading the envi
ronment. It has been a seesaw
battle. Now, it appears that the
environmental cause is on the
downswing.
It all began back in mid-|uly,
when President Jimmy Carter
proposed to the nation the
formation of an Energy Mobili
zation Board (EMB). The av
owed purpose of this board
would be to cut through
bureaucratic red tape and speed
up what were considered
high-priority energy projects.
Pipelines, refineries, synthe
tic fuel plants, nuclear power
plants, coal-burning plants and
off-shore oil drilling are all pro
jects that would likely be
placed on the high priority, or
"fast track," list. The primary
impetus for accelerating the
licensing and construction of
key energy projects was the
desire to reduce the nation's
dependence on foreign
supplies of oil.
This all sounds like a very
noble pursuit until one realizes
how much has to be given up in
the bargain. The House version
of the bill, passed in
November, would empower
the EMB tooverrideany tederal
environmental laws which

tnreatened to delay the com
pletion of important energy
projects.
Protective legislation
enacted in the last 20 years,
such as the Clean Air, Clean
Water, and Endangered
Species Acts, would be effec
tively nullified.
The Senate version, while
not quite as objectionable to
environmentalists as the
House bill, still contains many
undesirable provisions. If the
federal, state or local agencies
responsible for the energy pro
ject were not meeting the
deadlines imposed by the
EMB, the board could step in
and take control of the timeta
ble.
However, it is often these
regulations, passed after the
misfortunes of experience,
that offer the most protection.
More importantly, perhaps,
the EMB would have power to
waive procedural laws. Pro
cedural matters, such as en
vironmental impact state
ments, public hearings and
public access to information,
could be streamlined or elimi
nated altogether. But it is pre
cisely these procedural matters
that are the watchdog of our
society.
Only by continual public
scrutiny can we be sure that oil
companies, utilities, mining
industries and power con
glomerates are not lulling us
into a false sense of well-being.
The EMB bill is now in the
House-Senate conference
committee, where differences
between the two versions will
be iToned out. No matter
which version of the bill is fi
nally reported out of confer-'
ence, however, the environ
ment wi// surely suffer a severe
setback.
Is the need to further de
velop domestic energy sources
so great that we should aban
don all caution?
Rather than go blindly ahead
with such untried technologies
as synthetic fuels and breeder
reactors, might not it be wiser
to proceed with care?The envi
ronment includes much more
than just fish, birds and flowers
—it also includes you. An ar
ticle in the latest issue of Sierra
magazine stated, "Politicians
have thought of the environ
ment as trees, waterways and
endangered species — none of
which register to vote. In 1980
we must force them to think of
the environment as also com
prising thousands and hun
dreds of thousands of deter
mined voters."

bureaucratic red tape and speed
up what were considered
high-priority energy projects.
Pipelines, refineries, synthe
tic fuel plants, nuclear power
plants, coal-burning plants and
off-shore oil drilling are all pro
jects that would likely be
placed on the high priority, or
"fast track," list. The primary
impetus for accelerating the
licensing and construction of
key energy projects was the
desire to reduce the nation's
dependence on foreign
supplies of oil.
This all sounds like a very
noble pursuit until one realizes
how much has to be given up in
the bargain. The House version
of the bill, passed in
November, would empower
the EMB tooverrideany tederal
environmental laws which

tnreatened to delay the com
pletion of important energy
projects.
Protective legislation
enacted in the last 20 years,
such as the Clean Air, Clean
Water, and Endangered
Species Acts, would be effec
tively nullified.
The Senate version, while
not quite as objectionable to
environmentalists as the
House bill, still contains many
undesirable provisions. If the
federal, state or local agencies
responsible for the energy pro
ject were not meeting the
deadlines imposed by the
EMB, the board could step in
and take control of the timeta
ble.
However, it is often these
regulations, passed after the
misfortunes of experience,
that offer the most protection.
More importantly, perhaps,
the EMB would have power to
waive procedural laws. Pro
cedural matters, such as en
vironmental impact state
ments, public hearings and
public access to information,
could be streamlined or elimi
nated altogether. But it is pre
cisely these procedural matters
that are the watchdog of our
society.
Only by continual public
scrutiny can we be sure that oil
companies, utilities, mining
industries and power con
glomerates are not lulling us
into a false sense of well-being.
The EMB bill is now in the
House-Senate conference
committee, where differences
between the two versions will
be iToned out. No matter
which version of the bill is fi
nally reported out of confer-'
ence, however, the environ
ment wi// surely suffer a severe
setback.
Is the need to further de
velop domestic energy sources
so great that we should aban
don all caution?
Rather than go blindly ahead
with such untried technologies
as synthetic fuels and breeder
reactors, might not it be wiser
to proceed with care?The envi
ronment includes much more
than just fish, birds and flowers
—it also includes you. An ar
ticle in the latest issue of Sierra
magazine stated, "Politicians
have thought of the environ
ment as trees, waterways and
endangered species — none of
which register to vote. In 1980
we must force them to think of
the environment as also com
prising thousands and hun
dreds of thousands of deter
mined voters."
