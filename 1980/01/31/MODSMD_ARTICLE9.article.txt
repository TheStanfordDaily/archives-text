## U.S. energy gluttony a threat to world peace 
### 
Viewed as leading to reduc
tion in the American standard
of living, energy conservation
has long been resisted. How
ever, the main thrust of energy
conservation focuses on in
creased efficiency and less
waste rather than on strict cur
tailments of lifestyles.
Currently the United States
wastes 50 percent of its energy.
Sweden, with a CNP compara
ble to that of the United States,
uses 40 percent less energy.
The tact that the United States
uses 35 percent of the world's
resources with only six percent
of the world's population is a
result of our inefficiency rather
than an indication of our suc
cess as a nation.
Americans have been told
that increased consumption is

the key to a healthy economy.
However, each additional bar
rel of oil costs more to produce
than the previous one, making
increased energy consumption
the major tactor in rising infla
tion.
The current energy industry
is extremely capital intensive
while employing only a few
highly skilled workers. To
realize profits, utility com
panies urge the public to con
sume more and more, and the
spiral of growth continues.
It is now up to the individual
to realize that we live in a world
ot tinite space and resources.
Energy-gobbling Americans
are stealing not only from
other countries, but from fu
ture generations as well.
Conservation can help

stretch the remaining fossil
luel reserves until the transi
tion to a new age of nonpollut
ing, renewable energy sources
is completed. Since the Uni
versity opened the Energy
Conservation Center in 1975,
the average student electricity
usage has declined 15 to 20
percent. Yet utility rates have
more than tripled. There needs
to be an even greater personal
commitment to conservation
among students.
Last year's furor over the in
stallation of water and energy
saving shower heads de
monstrated an appalling lack of
concern for the energy situa
tion.
There are many ways in
which an individual can reduce
his or her energy consump

tion; itcanbeassimpleasturn
ing off unnecessary lights. If
everyone at Stanford turned
off one 100 watt bulb for one
hour each day, the University
would save 1825 barrels of oil
per year.
Transportation needs ac
count for 25 percent ot U.S.
energy use; you can ride a bike
or take public transit. A free
shuttle on campus connects
with the train depot and major
bus lines.
Wear an extra sweater, and
recycle all re-usable trash. You
can share refrigerators, as each
small refrigerator uses $15 per
year, which equals 28 gallons
of oil, and you can insulate
your waterbeds with foam pads
instead ot using heaters, saving
125 gallons per year.

As President Jimmy Carter
made so clear in his State ot the I
Union address, our depen
dence on oil and on foreign
imports is the major cause ot
our (altering economy. The j
possibility ot military torce to
obtain that oil is becoming
more and more a reality.
It we continue in a litestyleot
mindless consumption, we
may have to tight tor it. In the
interests ot world peace, each
ot us must take the responsibil
ity to consume less, use energy
more etticientlv and minimize
our impact upon the earth.
