Three students from the three most prestigious
universities in California were talking about
holidays The San Jose State student re
marked he liked Easter because it was the day
that we honor our nation s forefather s who
signed the Declaration of Independence, shot
off fireworks, and got drunk The student from
the University of San Franicsco interrupted
saying You have it all wrong! Easter is the
holiday when we eat turkey watch football
games and honor the pilgrims and the In
dians The Stanford student calmly resolved
the issue by saying. You driveling cretins are
both misinformed Easter is the holiday when
the Christians honor Jesus Chirst. who was
crucified on a cross, his enshrouded body was
interred in a cave in front of which a large
boulder was placed After three days Jesus
rose from the dead, pushed aside the boulder
and if he sees his shadow there s si* more
