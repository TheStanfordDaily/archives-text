it may not look like much,
tuc keel away in a small room at
the Eating Clubs complex, but
the Stanford Women s Center
is more a< tive than e\er.
According to one o! its stat
lers, this is the tirst year in its
10-year history that the Wo
men's Center has ever been so
well organized or made sue h a
good attempt at informing the
public.
The Women's Center is
mainly a resource center
whose books, magazines, job
listings, tilms, slides and bulle
tin board are available to any
women's group on campus.

Women (< R<)W), the lo<al
chapter of the National Or

and several SWOI'SI courses

I lie Women's Center also
sponsors a variety ot tree prog
rams ,nul workshops, con
torts, art displays and Monday
morning bagel breaktasts.
Junior Kim Bancrott and
senior Debbie DeNott, both
stallers at the center, c onsider
the organization essential be
cause ol male domination on
campus. Bancrott called the
University a "real male bas
tion," (iling traternities, toot
ball games and i lasses that take
a male perspec ti\eas examples
ot ibis male orientation.
"Cirad students tell us that
students are now more con
servative. There's less ot a

feminist consciousness," Ban
; rott added.
"A place is needed to discuss
problems unique to women,
whether it's tinding work,
reaching orgasm or tixing a
bike," she said.
Workshops
For example, Bancrott
noted, most women will get a
man to tix their bike.

Accordingly, the Women's
Center sponsors a lour-week
bike repair workshop. In addi
tion a course in preventive
medicine was ottered in
January, and a journal-writing

workshop is being ottered
rhursday alternoons this quar
ter.
Thursdays at 7:50 p.m. in
lormal learning sessions are
held al the center. Past topics
have been "Women and
Work, "Men Against Sexist
Violence" and "Working
Against Rape." Upcoming to

and Nonsexist Relationships"

ally include a t Mm or slide show
and subsequent discussion.
I he c enter has recently been
involved in women's orienta

meet with women new to the
University. They acquaint them
with women's organizations
on campus, talk to them about
rape protection and sexual har
rassment, and distribute tree
copies ol Won Jen's C.mde, a
booklet written by Stanlord

"Support" seems to tie the

encouraged others to "come

DeNott estimated that live to
10 percent of the Women's
Center's 500 to 500 partic ipants

Some programs are c losecl to
men, like the assertiveness
training and gynecological
workshops. But the Thursday

("women don't talk as much;
they've been socialized to be

Women's Studies
• The Women's Center is in
volved in changing campus
policies as well as personal re

tionships. Its main concern
right now is getting a Women's
Studies program at Stanford.
On Wednesday CROW plans
to send a report to the Univer
sity recommending the estab
lishment of such a program.
The report is the result ot one
year's research.
Gary Goodman, who works
at CROW, expects the prop
osal to be accepted, owing to
the University's current in
terest in interdisciplinary prog
rams and Provost Donald Ken
nedy's commitment to affirma
tive action.
"A lot of universities have al
ready recognized Women's
Studies. Stanford is behind,"
said DeNott. The reason, she
added, is that "Stanford is into
academic rigor, and some feel
women's studies isn't real
academics".
DeNott and Bancroft are also
dissatisfied with the small
number of women piotessors

here. According to Bancroft,
there are 752 tenured male pro
fessors here, but only 35 wo
men. There is only one tenured
woman professor in the Politi
cal Science Dept.
A major goal of the organiza
tion is toget University funding
lor the Center,'something we
could count on every year,"
members said. This year, for
the first time, it received a
one-quarter ASSU fee assess

spread out the $10,000 over the
next several years.

Women's Studies
• The Women's Center is in
volved in changing campus
policies as well as personal re

tionships. Its main concern
right now is getting a Women's
Studies program at Stanford.
On Wednesday CROW plans
to send a report to the Univer
sity recommending the estab
lishment of such a program.
The report is the result ot one
year's research.
Gary Goodman, who works
at CROW, expects the prop
osal to be accepted, owing to
the University's current in
terest in interdisciplinary prog
rams and Provost Donald Ken
nedy's commitment to affirma
tive action.
"A lot of universities have al
ready recognized Women's
Studies. Stanford is behind,"
said DeNott. The reason, she
added, is that "Stanford is into
academic rigor, and some feel
women's studies isn't real
academics".
DeNott and Bancroft are also
dissatisfied with the small
number of women piotessors

here. According to Bancroft,
there are 752 tenured male pro
fessors here, but only 35 wo
men. There is only one tenured
woman professor in the Politi
cal Science Dept.
A major goal of the organiza
tion is toget University funding
lor the Center,'something we
could count on every year,"
members said. This year, for
the first time, it received a
one-quarter ASSU fee assess
ment and members plan to
spread out the $10,000 over the
next several years.

the Eating Clubs complex, but
the Stanford Women s Center
is more a< tive than e\er.
According to one o! its stat
lers, this is the tirst year in its
10-year history that the Wo
men's Center has ever been so
well organized or made sue h a
good attempt at informing the
public.
The Women's Center is
mainly a resource center
whose books, magazines, job
listings, tilms, slides and bulle
tin board are available to any
women's group on campus.

I lie Women's Center also
sponsors a variety ot tree prog
rams ,nul workshops, con
torts, art displays and Monday
morning bagel breaktasts.
Junior Kim Bancrott and
senior Debbie DeNott, both
stallers at the center, c onsider
the organization essential be
cause ol male domination on
campus. Bancrott called the
University a "real male bas
tion," (iling traternities, toot
ball games and i lasses that take
a male perspec ti\eas examples
ot ibis male orientation.
"Cirad students tell us that
students are now more con
servative. There's less ot a

feminist consciousness," Ban
; rott added.
"A place is needed to discuss
problems unique to women,
whether it's tinding work,
reaching orgasm or tixing a
bike," she said.
Workshops
For example, Bancrott
noted, most women will get a
man to tix their bike.

Accordingly, the Women's
Center sponsors a lour-week
bike repair workshop. In addi
tion a course in preventive
medicine was ottered in
January, and a journal-writing

workshop is being ottered
rhursday alternoons this quar
ter.
Thursdays at 7:50 p.m. in
lormal learning sessions are
held al the center. Past topics
have been "Women and
Work, "Men Against Sexist
Violence" and "Working
Against Rape." Upcoming to
pics are "Women and Body
Images, rhursday and "love
and Nonsexist Relationships"
on leb. 14. The sessions usu
ally include a t Mm or slide show
and subsequent discussion.

meet with women new to the
University. They acquaint them
with women's organizations
on campus, talk to them about
rape protection and sexual har
rassment, and distribute tree
copies ol Won Jen's C.mde, a
booklet written by Stanlord
women last year.

The center was instrumental
in beginning the lesbian dis
cussion series, vvhn h meets
weekly over lunch •'> H-scuss
topics like "Dealing with
Straight Men ami Women,"
"How lesbians Relate to C.ay
Men," antl "Lesbians and Re
ligion."
The lesbian group, which
has about 20 regular members,
also plans dances, parties jnd
sottball games.
"Support" seems to tie the
overwhelming reason lor les
bians participating, members
say. At one meeting, a woman
encouraged others to "come
out" and say, "I'm gay and I'm
proud. It's your duty to be a
positive spokesperson tor
other lesbians."
Men
DeNott estimated that live to
10 percent of the Women's
Center's 500 to 500 partic ipants
are male.
Some programs are c losecl to
men, like the assertiveness
training and gynecological
workshops. But the Thursday
night sessions are open to
everyone, and about two thirds
ol those attending the sexist
violence session, which was
presented by a man, were
male.
"Everyone should know
about women worker*- rape,
pornography, etc., " s«ict Ban
c rott. "And men should also be
involved in changing these
situations."
Sophomore Phi I Ansell, who
attended the 1 session on sexist
violence, agrees. He came be
cause a temale triend in the
center recommended it. He
guessed that almost all men,
once they came, would be in
terested, but he said that the
i hallenge is getting them to
walk through the doors lor the
lirst time.
Ansell said he sees sexism
"everywhere" at Stantord. He
c ited traternities' "little sis
ters," Dollies, parties ("lots ol
guys go to them to pic k up
women"), and seminars
("women don't talk as much;
they've been socialized to be
less assertive") as manifesta
tions.
But he added that men also

as "machismo, objectifying
women, the need lor power
and holding in feelings." He
