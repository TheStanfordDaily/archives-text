# Editor's perspective
## Reflecting on the volume 
### 
It's been great. Always challenging, many
times trustrating, usually rewarding, but
never, never dull.
Today marks my last issue as editor of the
Daily. And this final editor's viewpoint is a
sort ot tradition with Doily editors — a time to
say thanks and goodbye.
Putting out a daily paper is a lot ot work at
anytime. At the start ot this year, though, we
were laced with another challenge — a paper
grown suddenly and dramatically larger. As
the business side ot the Daily expanded, so
was the editorial side pushed to adjust to
some long needed changes.
Its been pretty successful. A larger, better
organized stall has produced more local
news articles and pictures.
We've brought in professional journalists
to talk about the field and to give us some
construe five hints on everything from editing
to layout. We've tried a number ot new ven
tures; the monthly Daily Magazine has pro
vided staffers with the chance to try some
thing in-depth and creative. The project has
been well received both inside and outside
the Daily office.
We've also started world news pages in an
attempt to give readers more detailed cover
age of national and international events.
We've sponsored a publicity workshop
and sent letters to academic departments and
various organizations in an effort to reach out
to the community lor suggestions and ideas.
And our readers have been particularly re
sponsive these past months — something we

greatly appreciate.
We've made some successful etlorts to
make the office an enjoyable and productive
place to work.
We've worked hard and well on our two
primary purposes — informing the Stantord
community to the best of our ability and act
ing as an educational workshop lor prospec
tive journalists.
But all this and more couldn't have been
done without the dedicated statt I so enjoyed
in volume 176. From the lirst frustrating and
contusing days through some ot the largest,
papers the Daily has ever produced — these
stalters stayed generally calm, working long,
hard hours. The Daily demanded a lot and
they gave their time generously. So my sin
cerest thanks to Bill, till, Nancy, Susan, Sam,
Andrea, Ken, Chris, Ivan, Rob, Karen,
Dianne, Ron, Setli, Brad, Robert, Rob, lames,
Brad. And most ot all, to Randy.
So I leave the Daily but in good hands, and
with the knowledge that there is a good,
strong stall readv to work on the ever
growing paper.
There are improvements to be made, cer
tainly. There are always more stories that
need to be covered, and more new statters to
train, and more new ideas to try, and more
mistakes to avoid and more time — we always
need more time. But this has been a very
good volume overall, arrd a terrific experi
ence lor me. Thanks.
