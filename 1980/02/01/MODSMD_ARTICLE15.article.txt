## Minorities not getting past letter 'a' 
### 
On )an7 25, I attended a
brown bag meeting in which
representatives from Stanford
shared their impressions about
minority issues discussed at a
national meeting of private col
lege administrators. The meet
ing was sponsored by the Con
sortium of Financing Higher
Education, and the topic was
"Campus Climates for
Minorities." What was good
about the national meeting was
that two ot the tour from Stan
ford were minority (Hispanic).
The informal presentations
by the tour attendees elicited
considerable discussion. I do
not intend to try to report on all
the presentations and discus
sions, but I would like to give
some impressions and opin
ions.
There were introductory
comments about who the at
tendees were at the national
meeting, and gains made by
Third World communities at
Stanford and other institu
tions; ethnics and ethnicity;
integration and those respon
sible for it; faboos; behavior;
increasing the level of con
sciousness of Anglos, increas
ing the level of consciousness
ot Third World people about
themselves, and positive and
negative aspects of the two
taken together; education in a
culturally diverse student envi
ronment, and its relationship
lo the curriculum.
There were comments about
the gains made by the Third
World communities at the Uni
versity being matters of policy
and not being lost through
time, only to be astutely cor
rected by another representa
tive to mean that those gains in
policy may be subject to
change from time to time for
purposes of improvement. (I
was pleased to hear this correc
tion because I distinctly recal
led the University closing
down the Office of Assistant to
the President for Black Affairs,
srt I hope the Chicano com
munity will be sensitive to
"improvements" in leadership
positions within their own
community by the administra
tion.)
There were criticisms about

the lack of institutional support
for programs that the com
munities have tried but which
failed. I readily identified with
that problem, because it
comes closest to what I feel is a
true analytical appreciation of
the causative factors surround
ing all of the issues discussed.
In my opinion, when Third
World communities speak of a
lack of institutional support in
bringing about a program, etc.,
it means in most instances that
they are not an integral part of
the institution's decision
making processes. The frame
of reference is: one or more of
the Third World communities
versus the administration.
One of the four representa
tives stated that minorities had
not gotten beyond the letter
"a": they are assistants, as
sociates, affirmative action,
etc. May I add that they are also
absolutely absent in key posi
tions at Stanford.
Until there are more Third
World people on the faculty
and staff here, this will con
tinue to be a racial, adversarial
situation. Until there are im
provements in these areas,
conferences like this one will
continue to be necessary or
questionable. Specifically,
until there are some, or more
Third World people in line pos
itions in the Provost's Office,
the President's Office and the
deans' offices, the problems
discussed above will remain.
I invite the reader to go
through the positions and
people on pages 5 through 7 of
the University's Faculty/Staff
Directory for 1979-80 and count
the number of Third World
people, particularly staff. I in
vite the reader to ascertain
further the number of Third
World people throughout the
University who are in a posi
tion to obtain and control a
budget. The climate of the
campus at Stanford and
elsewhere will continue to be
bleak until the budget officers
take on some color.
Unless this issue is addres
sed and resolved, there is no
thing to be gained by discus
sing disappointment and sur
prise about who attended the

conference. I wager that if each
of the institutions were to be
polled and asked who chose
the people to attend the na
tional conference, 95 percent
of the selectors would not be
Third World.
Although there are individu
als who wish to see racial har
mony in the world, integration
is a social phenomenon dif
ficult to engineer, and easier to
bungle. Integration is a choice
that should be left to the indi
vidual and not tampered with
by an institution.
On the other hand, an in
stitution can bring about de
segregation, and this is what
the University has not done.
The offices mentioned above
must be desegregated,
whether or not the people in
them get along; the student
body must be further desegre
gated, whether the students
like one another or not.

As I walked away from that
meeting, hearing serious and
sincere inputs from a number
of people, I got the feeling that
perhaps there is a need for the
Third World communities to
confer. I believe there is a lot
we can all learn, including the
writer, about institutional be
havior and decision-making; I
already feel well versed about
institutional misbehavior.

sciousness of Anglos, increas
ing the level of consciousness
ot Third World people about
themselves, and positive and
negative aspects of the two
taken together; education in a
culturally diverse student envi
ronment, and its relationship
lo the curriculum.
There were comments about
the gains made by the Third
World communities at the Uni
versity being matters of policy
and not being lost through
time, only to be astutely cor
rected by another representa
tive to mean that those gains in
policy may be subject to
change from time to time for
purposes of improvement. (I
was pleased to hear this correc
tion because I distinctly recal
led the University closing
down the Office of Assistant to
the President for Black Affairs,
srt I hope the Chicano com
munity will be sensitive to
"improvements" in leadership
positions within their own
community by the administra
tion.)
There were criticisms about

the lack of institutional support
for programs that the com
munities have tried but which
failed. I readily identified with
that problem, because it
comes closest to what I feel is a
true analytical appreciation of
the causative factors surround
ing all of the issues discussed.
In my opinion, when Third
World communities speak of a
lack of institutional support in
bringing about a program, etc.,
it means in most instances that
they are not an integral part of
the institution's decision
making processes. The frame
of reference is: one or more of
the Third World communities
versus the administration.
One of the four representa
tives stated that minorities had
not gotten beyond the letter
"a": they are assistants, as
sociates, affirmative action,
etc. May I add that they are also
absolutely absent in key posi
tions at Stanford.
Until there are more Third
World people on the faculty
and staff here, this will con
tinue to be a racial, adversarial
situation. Until there are im
provements in these areas,
conferences like this one will
continue to be necessary or
questionable. Specifically,
until there are some, or more
Third World people in line pos
itions in the Provost's Office,
the President's Office and the
deans' offices, the problems
discussed above will remain.
I invite the reader to go
through the positions and
people on pages 5 through 7 of
the University's Faculty/Staff
Directory for 1979-80 and count
the number of Third World
people, particularly staff. I in
vite the reader to ascertain
further the number of Third
World people throughout the
University who are in a posi
tion to obtain and control a
budget. The climate of the
campus at Stanford and
elsewhere will continue to be
bleak until the budget officers
take on some color.
Unless this issue is addres
sed and resolved, there is no
thing to be gained by discus
sing disappointment and sur
prise about who attended the

conference. I wager that if each
of the institutions were to be
polled and asked who chose
the people to attend the na
tional conference, 95 percent
of the selectors would not be
Third World.
Although there are individu
als who wish to see racial har
mony in the world, integration
is a social phenomenon dif
ficult to engineer, and easier to
bungle. Integration is a choice
that should be left to the indi
vidual and not tampered with
by an institution.
On the other hand, an in
stitution can bring about de
segregation, and this is what
the University has not done.
The offices mentioned above
must be desegregated,
whether or not the people in
them get along; the student
body must be further desegre
gated, whether the students
like one another or not.

As I walked away from that
meeting, hearing serious and
sincere inputs from a number
of people, I got the feeling that
perhaps there is a need for the
Third World communities to
confer. I believe there is a lot
we can all learn, including the
writer, about institutional be
havior and decision-making; I
already feel well versed about
institutional misbehavior.

On )an7 25, I attended a
brown bag meeting in which
representatives from Stanford
shared their impressions about
minority issues discussed at a
national meeting of private col
lege administrators. The meet
ing was sponsored by the Con
sortium of Financing Higher
Education, and the topic was
"Campus Climates for
Minorities." What was good
about the national meeting was
that two ot the tour from Stan
ford were minority (Hispanic).
The informal presentations
by the tour attendees elicited
considerable discussion. I do
not intend to try to report on all
the presentations and discus
sions, but I would like to give
some impressions and opin
ions.
There were introductory
comments about who the at
tendees were at the national
meeting, and gains made by
Third World communities at
Stanford and other institu
tions; ethnics and ethnicity;
integration and those respon
sible for it; faboos; behavior;
increasing the level of con
sciousness of Anglos, increas
ing the level of consciousness
ot Third World people about
themselves, and positive and
negative aspects of the two
taken together; education in a

ronment, and its relationship
