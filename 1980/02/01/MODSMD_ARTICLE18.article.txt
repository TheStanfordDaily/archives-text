# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Laura Mead Make Tresidder Union Board work 
### 
As a frosh here tour years
ago, I wanted something more
thari a lite revolving around my
dorm. By winter quarter I felt
stagnant. I knew everyone in
my dorm. I tried desperately to
find a way to meet other un
dergraduates, but I was frus
trated by the fact that there was
no formal place on campus to
get acquainted with students
outside of one's dorm.
The tollowing year I personally
experienced one dilemma that
off-campus students often go
through. I did not want to ap
pear like a "hanger-on" in
some dorm lounge; yet I
wasn't convinced that Tresid
der Memorial Union was the
place to meet with friends and
acquaintances.
Even though I was an active
member of STARTS (formerly
the Tresidder Program Board),
I felt alienated from Tresidder:
students were not allowed to
participate in its management

and policy-making.
Students have always been
Tresidder's largest comsumer
group but were not recognized
as such. Consequently, de
spite programming that at
tempted to personalize the Un
ion, it unfortunately was not a
viable student center.
Questions about what Tre
sidder should otfer the Stan
ford community began to
permeatemy conversations. By
the end of my sophomore year,
I was enthusiastic about Tre
sidder's potential as a student
center; however, at that time I
had formulated no concrete
plan of action.
During the fall of my junior
year, I was elected to the As
sociated College Unions
International-Regional Board
as the Bay Area representative.
One of my duties included at
tending Board meetings at
other California and Nevada
universities which enabled me
to observe a variety of union
facilities and see first-hand
how they were managed.
An overwhelming majority
of other school unions were
governed by a "Union Board''
consisting almost entirely of
students. It becameclear to me
that students could have an
impact in policy-making at Tre
sidder if a Union Board existed.
The following is a summary
leading up to the establish
ment of the Union Board.
January 7979 — Tom Virden
(chair, ASSU Consumer Affairs
Task Force), Mark Breier (Pub
lic Interest Research Group-
CRAVE), Betty Gontero (T.A. —
psychology professor Philip
Zimbardo's "Human connec
tion'' class) and I met to discuss
the problem of campus aliena

tion and the role that Tresidder
could play as a campus
"gathering spot." We decided
to coordinate our efforts to in
crease our effectiveness in
lobbying for a change.
We met together and indi
vidually with Tresidder Direc
tor Dan Williams, urging the
establishment of a Union
Board These meetings did not
geneiate any progress. Next
Breier, Virden and I met with
Dean of Student Affairs lames
Lyons.
Lyons said that if a Union
Board was established there
would be a method of sys
tematically providing com
munity input, and a suitable
master plan could be de
veloped for Tresidder remod
eling (one of our goals).
Lyons said that because
well-thought-out plans at
tracted funding, we should
concern ourselves not with
searching for funding but with
developing a system that
would generate a plan of ac
tion.
February 7979 — A joint
meeting of STARTS, the ASSU
Consumer Affairs Task Force,
and the Public Interest Re
search Group-CRAVE was held
with Williams and Ellie Op
penheim, assistant director of
Tresidder. Atthis meeting, Wil
liams promised to convene a
task force to write a Union
Board proposal.
March 7979 — After heavy
lobbying to hasten the pro
cess, the Union Governance
Task Force met to write the
proposal. I wanted a perma
nent process that would insure
student input into Tresidder
management.
At this time, a subcommittee

of the Union Board was insti
tuted to open communications
between Stanford's commun
ity and Tresidder's food retail
ers; Virden was chosen as its
chair with Oppenheim acting
as the committee's manage
ment coordinator.
April 1979 — The task force
continued to work on the
Union Board proposal. We re
searched why the old Union
Board (that was primarily a
faculty-staff board) did not
function efficiently. From our
findings we decided that a
Union Board could be efficient
if it set policy but was not re
sponsible for day-to-day man
agement decisions that were
execution of policy.
November 1979 — Lobbying
for the Union Board's accep
tance was lasting longer than I
had expected; however, con
versations were more "when''
than "if."
December 1979 — The ASSU
Nominations Committee was
authorized to nominate and
recommend the Union Board
student members. The Visiting
Committee, consisting of
other union directors, com
mented in their report, "The
newly-created Union Board is a
highly commendable step
lanuary 1980 — By )an. 16,
the Nominations Committee
had completed their nomina
tions and the senate had
ratified them. The appoint
ments of the Union Board's fa
culty, staff and student mem
bers are pending President
Richard Lyman's action.
We, the Council of Presi
dents, challenge the new
Union Board to provide Tre
sidder with the needed leader
ship to unity it and give it direc
tion. For several years now,
Tresidder decision-making has
been reactions to problems.
No management objectives
presently exist.
The newly-created Union
Board has the responsibility to
set objectives tor the Union
that will increase its respon
siveness to the needs of fa
culty, statt and students. Now
is the lime for selt-evaluation
of its organization and space
usage as well as planning tor
major renovations or relur
bishing.
Student members — Regina
Petty, Tom Virden, |ill Miller,
Jonathan McGee and Doug
Mitchell —wechallengeyouto
represent your tellow students.
You have the primary respon
sibility forstudent involvement
in the Union decision-making
process.
Talk to students who live in
dorms and otf-campus. Listen
to their concerns and then
voice them convincingly to
Tresidder's management and
the University's administra
tion. You are the tirst student
members ot one of only two
University committees with a
student majority. Many stu
dents invested considerable
time and energy for this oppor
tunity to affect the shaping ot
Tresidder's future.
Don't let them down.

continued to work on the
Union Board proposal. We re
searched why the old Union
Board (that was primarily a
faculty-staff board) did not
function efficiently. From our
findings we decided that a
Union Board could be efficient
if it set policy but was not re
sponsible for day-to-day man

execution of policy.
November 1979 — Lobbying
for the Union Board's accep

had expected; however, con

As a frosh here tour years
ago, I wanted something more
thari a lite revolving around my
dorm. By winter quarter I felt
stagnant. I knew everyone in
my dorm. I tried desperately to
find a way to meet other un
dergraduates, but I was frus
trated by the fact that there was
no formal place on campus to
get acquainted with students
outside of one's dorm.
The tollowing year I personally
experienced one dilemma that
off-campus students often go
through. I did not want to ap
pear like a "hanger-on" in
some dorm lounge; yet I
wasn't convinced that Tresid
der Memorial Union was the
place to meet with friends and
acquaintances.
Even though I was an active
member of STARTS (formerly
the Tresidder Program Board),
I felt alienated from Tresidder:
students were not allowed to
participate in its management

and policy-making.
Students have always been
Tresidder's largest comsumer
group but were not recognized
as such. Consequently, de
spite programming that at
tempted to personalize the Un
ion, it unfortunately was not a
viable student center.
Questions about what Tre
sidder should otfer the Stan
ford community began to
permeatemy conversations. By
the end of my sophomore year,
I was enthusiastic about Tre
sidder's potential as a student
center; however, at that time I
had formulated no concrete
plan of action.
During the fall of my junior
year, I was elected to the As
sociated College Unions
International-Regional Board
as the Bay Area representative.
One of my duties included at
tending Board meetings at
other California and Nevada
universities which enabled me
to observe a variety of union
facilities and see first-hand
how they were managed.
An overwhelming majority
of other school unions were
governed by a "Union Board''
consisting almost entirely of
students. It becameclear to me
that students could have an
impact in policy-making at Tre
sidder if a Union Board existed.
The following is a summary
leading up to the establish
ment of the Union Board.
January 7979 — Tom Virden
(chair, ASSU Consumer Affairs
Task Force), Mark Breier (Pub
lic Interest Research Group-
CRAVE), Betty Gontero (T.A. —
psychology professor Philip
Zimbardo's "Human connec
tion'' class) and I met to discuss
the problem of campus aliena

tion and the role that Tresidder
could play as a campus
"gathering spot." We decided
to coordinate our efforts to in
crease our effectiveness in
lobbying for a change.
We met together and indi
vidually with Tresidder Direc
tor Dan Williams, urging the
establishment of a Union
Board These meetings did not
geneiate any progress. Next
Breier, Virden and I met with
Dean of Student Affairs lames
Lyons.
Lyons said that if a Union
Board was established there
would be a method of sys
tematically providing com
munity input, and a suitable
master plan could be de
veloped for Tresidder remod
eling (one of our goals).
Lyons said that because
well-thought-out plans at
tracted funding, we should
concern ourselves not with
searching for funding but with
developing a system that
would generate a plan of ac
tion.
February 7979 — A joint
meeting of STARTS, the ASSU
Consumer Affairs Task Force,
and the Public Interest Re
search Group-CRAVE was held
with Williams and Ellie Op
penheim, assistant director of
Tresidder. Atthis meeting, Wil
liams promised to convene a
task force to write a Union
Board proposal.
March 7979 — After heavy
lobbying to hasten the pro
cess, the Union Governance
Task Force met to write the
proposal. I wanted a perma
nent process that would insure
student input into Tresidder
management.
At this time, a subcommittee

of the Union Board was insti
tuted to open communications
between Stanford's commun
ity and Tresidder's food retail
ers; Virden was chosen as its
chair with Oppenheim acting
as the committee's manage
ment coordinator.
