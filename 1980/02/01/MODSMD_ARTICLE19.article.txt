## Coffee anyone? 
### 
The live major goals ol a
student-run Cotfee House are:
1) Provide valuable work ex
perience for students;
2) Provide the Stanford
community with the food ser
vice they desire;
3) Develop a gathering spot
for students;
4) Provide free cultural
events for the Stanford com
munity (i.e., art exhibits and
musical entertainment);
5) Lower prices!!
Next month, Tresidder
Union will be accepting con
tract proposals for future oper
ation of the food services at the
Union. The ASSU believes that
Tresidder needs to become
more of a student union. We
have received complaints
about high prices and in
adequate food and atmos
phere.
A labor dispute between
Coffee House workers and
TDS Inc. kept many students
away from the Coffee House
this fall. We can see that it is
time for the students to take an
active role in Tresidder opera
tions. We have researched the
feasibility of a student-run Cof
fee House, and we know that it
can work.
How can student manage
ment of the Coffee House
work?
A student-run Coffee House
will work, if you get involved.
We will need to develop a
competitive contract proposal.
We need to develop a man

agement system which will in
clude a Student Board of Direc
tors, long-term managers,
people to handle bookkeep
ing, scheduling, employment,
financing, advertising, and arts
and entertainment program
ming.
Tlje next few months are a
crucial time in the future of
Tresidder Union. A new Union
Board with student representa
tion has been installed. A new
Union Director will be hired.
Two to live-year contracts will
be signed for the operation of
the food service facilities. We
can't wait any longer to get in
volved.
We must commit ourselves
to making Tresidder a better
place for everyone now. Your
ideas and services will help. Do
you want managerial experi
ence? Do you have a financial
knack, or do you know some
thing about food service? We
will be thrilled with any type of
support, from a heavy com
mitment to a vote of approval.
The student-run Coffee
House â€” the building is there,
the bidding is now open, all we
need is you!!
The ASSU CoftepHouseTask
Force meets every Thursday
night at 7 p.m. in the American
Studies House.
