Washington â€” House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.),
publicly cautioned President Jimmy
Carter yesterday not to propose re
gistration of women for the military
draft, warning that such a move
would not make it through Con
gress.
"As I read the Congress," the
speaker told reporters on Capitol
Hill, "it wouldn't go. It would he
anathema around here," and the
White House would be "better off"
dropping the idea.
On the other hand, he said, he
senses a "strong leeling" in Con
gress favoring registration of men.
The president is scheduled to
make known next week it he wants
some 16 million women between the
ages of 18 and 2f> to register for a
possible draft, as well as a roughly

would mean there is virtually no
chance to include women in dratt re

have to provide authority.
In another development, women,
representing almost a score of wo
men's rights, civil rights and anti-war
groups from around the country,
gathered in Washington and told a
news conlerence that they were tlatly
opposed to registration of either
men or women. They further claimed
that women had the political power
to stop such a move.
"Women have always led anti-war
movements, and we must speak out
now against efforts to get us into
another war," warned former
member of Congress Bella Abzug,
who was tired last year as a White
House adviser on women's issues
and is now president of "Women
USA."
The parade of speakers on the
news conference podium de
monstrated, according to Gloria
Steinem, editor ot Ms Magazine, that
this wasn't an attempt to present a
nice, neat statement but rather was
meant to show the depth ot leeling
around the country against registra
tion, the draft and military solutions
to current problems.
Though Steinem and others
termed it ironic that women might be
drafted before they even gained their
"constitutional rights" under an
Equal Rights Amendment to the Con
stitution that is still unadopted, the
tone of the speakers was predomin
