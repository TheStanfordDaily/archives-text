Washington — House Speaker
Thomas "Tip" O'Neill (D-Mass.),
publicly cautioned President Jimmy
Carter yesterday not to propose re
gistration of women for the military
draft, warning that such a move
would not make it through Con
gress.
"As I read the Congress," the
speaker told reporters on Capitol
Hill, "it wouldn't go. It would he
anathema around here," and the
White House would be "better off"
dropping the idea.
On the other hand, he said, he
senses a "strong leeling" in Con
gress favoring registration of men.
The president is scheduled to
make known next week it he wants
some 16 million women between the
ages of 18 and 2f> to register for a
possible draft, as well as a roughly
similar number of young men.
It O'Neill's assessment is correct, it
would mean there is virtually no
chance to include women in dratt re
gistration, because Congress would
have to provide authority.
In another development, women,
representing almost a score of wo
men's rights, civil rights and anti-war
groups from around the country,
gathered in Washington and told a
news conlerence that they were tlatly
opposed to registration of either
men or women. They further claimed
that women had the political power
to stop such a move.
"Women have always led anti-war
movements, and we must speak out
now against efforts to get us into
another war," warned former
member of Congress Bella Abzug,
who was tired last year as a White
House adviser on women's issues
and is now president of "Women
USA."
The parade of speakers on the
news conference podium de
monstrated, according to Gloria
Steinem, editor ot Ms Magazine, that
this wasn't an attempt to present a
nice, neat statement but rather was
meant to show the depth ot leeling
around the country against registra
tion, the draft and military solutions
to current problems.
Though Steinem and others
termed it ironic that women might be
drafted before they even gained their
"constitutional rights" under an
Equal Rights Amendment to the Con
stitution that is still unadopted, the
tone of the speakers was predomin
antly anti-war.
"What we need is Amtrak, not
MX," said 74-year-old Maggie Kuhn,
head of the "Cray Panthers," in a re
ference to the nation's rail system
and a new Pentagon missile system,
respectively.
Hilda Mason, a D.C. city council
woman, said the trouble in the Per
sian Gulf was really "an economic
struggle to preserve corporate
health, rather than a threat to the
people." She wondered "what ever
happened to that man who came to
the White House with a bible in his
hand?"
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.)
did not attend the conference but
submitted a statement saying that
contributing money to the draft in
stead of beefing up the National
Cuard and reserves would send a
much clearer signal to Moscow than
"just compiling a list of American
youth."
Schroeder said the president's de
cision to ask for registration was
made by only a small group in the
White House, was contrary to the ad
vice of experts, and "not one top
Selective Service or Defence De
partment official was brought into

the decision.''
While the United States unques
tionably has key interests in the Per
sian Cult, she said, our allies' in
terests are greater. Yet, the United
States is going ahead with registering
youth "without asking any aid Irom
the countries who stand to lose the
most if oil shipments are interrupted
— Japan and Europe.''
A number ot women said the draft
should be invoked only it the United
States were "attacked."
"l ook," Abzug said at the close of
the conference, "the purpose ot this
press conference is to make clear we
are concerned about what is happen
ing in this country . . . the hysteria,
the return to the Cold War, the use of
the draft and registration for political
purposes to help fan the flames."
Though she condemned the Soviet
moves in Afghanistan, Abzug said
events there and in Iran are not jus
tification for the president's shilt
from a policy of self-reliance in
energy to what she called an "im
moral new Cold War campaign that
would sacrifice American lives to
back up our dependence on foreign
oil and the shamelessly profiteering
American oil monopoly."
