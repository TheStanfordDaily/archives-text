As a feminist, I was disap
pointed with the "feminist"
portion of the noon rally on
Monday, Jan. 28. The speakers
raised several important issues
which were lost in arguments
that bordered on the sexism
we fight against. (I found it
ironic to see sexual warfare it
an anti-war rally promoting
cooperation.)
Non-activists have such li
mited exposure to the opin
ions and concerns of those
who are active. I fear that, in
their use of unfamiliar and
easily-misconstrued jargon,
the speakers propagated an
unfortunate image of
feminism. This jargon also re
duced the issues to feminist
rather than humanistic ones.
In concentrating on the dif
ferential hardships faced by
women in the military, those
faced by men were ignored.
The basic point remains that
the American military system

perpetuates a conventional
ideology that oppresses
everyone involved or exposed,
irrespective of their sex.
This was an anti-war rally,
the main issue concerning the
consequences and nuances of
the draft as related to war.
Whether women should be
drafted or not remains a side
issue to whether anyone
should be drafted.
If we are unable to prevent
the reality of compulsory
draft, we all, both women and
men, must face the responsi

bility and make a conscious
decision concerning our re
sponse.
As I believe in the Equal
Rights Amendment, so I be
lieve there should be no legal
differentiation between the
sexes: the same benefits and
the same disadvantages, if men
are drafted, women should
also be drafted The draft issue,
however, remains, "Should
people be dratted?"
