## Pregnant women counseled at CAPS

Mounting her bicycle and
cursing the cold, the woman
moves out, closing the gap be
tween Lagunita and Cowell
Student Health Center.
Her mind ra< es. "What it it's
positive?" "How could I have
been so stupid?" "What will
my boytriend say?" "What will
I do?"
Mounting her bicycle and
cursing the sunshine, the
woman closes the gap be
tween Cowell and Lagunita.
She is pregnant. The questions
must be answered.
Tomorrow a Cowell coun
selor will help her sitt through
the questions. Soon alter she
will decide whether or not to
proceed with the unplanned
pregnancy.
last year 130 women here
were laced with this decision;
most opted for an abortion.
About 70 of them talked with
Charlotte Siegal or Peggy
Smith at Cowell Counseling
and Psychological Services
(CAPS).
According to Cowell nurse
practitioner Connie starr, there
were 63 unplanned pregnan
cies here in 1975. Smith attri
buted this increased number

ot unwanted pregnancies since
five years ago to "sloppy use of
contraceptives" and to a switch
from the pill to other methods
of contraception which call for
more immediate responsibil
ity.
One Stanford woman, a 19-
year-old sophomore, said she
became pregnant a lew days
before she was to start taking
the pill. Her abortion five
months ago terminated a
three-month pregnancy.
At seven weeks, a pregnancy
test produced a negative re
sult. But, she said, "I knew a
few days after the first test . . .
Vou can feel another being.
You can feel it growing." A
second test at 10 weeks con
firmed her suspicion.
At three months pregnant,
she had an abortion.
Taking a second to think, the
sophomore said she had no
real dilemma.
"I knew I was going to have
an abortion, she said. Having
taken a large amount of hal
lucinogenic drugs and thinking
they could harm the baby
made the sophomore's deci
sion easier.
"I believe in mercy killing,"

she said.
"Until the day of the opera
tion, my boyfriend was not
supportive ( of her decision).
He wanted the baby," she
said. But her lather, she added,
financed the abortion and was
very supportive. "He reacted
like a parent whose child really
had something come down in
her life."
Twisting a lock, the woman
becomes a bit pragmatic and a
bit philosophical.
"Being a teenager is the most
selfish time in your life," she
said. "Vou are creating a per
sonality. If you are at the point
where you're just forming a
sense of yourselt then you
have to put all your energy into
that."
Another Stanford woman
had an abortion a year ago,
during her junior year. Smil
ing, she says that the abortion
led to "an incredible growing
experience" for her and her
boyfriend.
"Of the whole experience,
the only negative thing is the
abortion itself," she said.
Sounding very self-assured,
she talks freely.
"I didn't consider any other

alternative. And I didn't have
any moral dilemma. I think it's
more immoral to have an un
wanted child."
Not using her diaphragm
when she thought it was safe
not to, brought the woman a
new perspective.
"With all the rallies, abortion
is such a political issue. But it's
not such a social, political is
sue. It's more an issue of per
sonal values, personal choice.
"The reason it's a political
issue is because of the
economic question. MediCal,
whoever, should fund abor
tions. They can't make the
moral judgement: 'You we
ren't careful enough so we
aren't going to give you one.' If
it's legal then the government
should support it. There's no
thing worse than making
someone have a child they
don't want."
"I'm very pro-choice," said
her boyfriend. "If we are to
have any control over our de
stiny, then it's important to
exercise whatever civil rights
we have.
"One must come to a deci
sion on a very pragmatic level.
The emotion comes afterward.
The emotion comes in dealing
with the operation."
"We try to be on top of the
physician we refer students to
because how you get re
sponded to when you have a
positive pregnancy test is im
portant," said Siegal at CAPS.
"I try to help the woman not
to be pressured by time . . .It's
important to have a good re
solution."
Siegal said many women
"tussle with something that is
wanted but doesn't fit."
There's a certain level of
feminine conflict but"when
you sift throught the feelings
you can make a more pragma
tic decision," she said.
Starr does the actual testing.
Offering insight on the high
rate of choice of abortion, she
said, "Most of the girls make
the decision based on their
own welfare. They're here to
get an education, and an un
planned pregnancy is not part
of the plan.
