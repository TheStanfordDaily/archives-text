## Civil rights sit-ins recalled 
### 
Greensboro, N.C. (AP) —
Four frightened young black
men, 17 and 18 years old, sat
down at a lunch counter 20
years ago.
What they did changed the
course of American history.
What they have become is a
history lesson itself.
Friday marks the 20th an
niversary of the beginning ot
the lunch counter sit-ins in
Greensboro. Within days, sit
ins for integration of public
tacilities had spread to S4 cities
in nine states. Within a year,
more than 100 cities had de
segregated some public
tacilities.
"In sitting down," the late
Frank Porter Graham, a one
time Democratic senator from
North Carolina, said during the
subsequent years ol protests,
"(the demonstrators) are
standing up for the American
dream."
Ezell Blair |r. — now Jibreel
Khazan — Franklin McCain,
loseph McNeil and David
Richmond left their North
Carolina A&T State College
dormitory about 4 p.m. on Feb.
I, 1960, to walk to the 112 .W.
Woolworth store downtown.
'It took us a while to get the
courage to go," Richmond re
called recently. "The manager
came and told us to leave; the
waitresses told us to leave.
When the police arrived, they
just stood there. They didn't
know what to do.
"I was the most fearful. It
you had said boo,' I probably
would have tallen oft the
stool," he said.
Richmond, now living in
Franklinton, has been un
employed for six months. He
has worked in federal job
programs and does odd jobs.
Richmond is the only one of
the four who did not complete
college.
"A lot ot negative things
have happened to me since,"
he said, but added, "If you take
the risk, you have to be able to
"cept the consequences."
i or McNeil, "The need tor
(the sit-ins) was very obvious.
On his way home from New
York after Christmas, McNeil
was refused service at a lunch
c ounter at the Greensboro bus
station.
"This disturbed him
greatly," said Khazan. "We
discussed this. He suggested a
boycott, but we didn't know
exactly what (to do.)"
The night before the sit-in,

Khazan visited his parents. He
asked it they would be embar
rassed it he got into trouble.
"Whyr' they asked.
"Because tomorrow we're
going to do something that will
shake up this town," he re
plied.
"I had a premonition ... I
had a leeling this was some
thing big, but I didn't have any
idea it would have the ramitica
tions it did," Khazan said last
week. "We were not trained
politically; we knew nothing
about law. Everything we knew
came from church and trom
school."
Khazan said his role in the
sit-ins was a high spot in his
lite. He added, however, "I
consider my contribution just
one drop, no more."

Khazan now lives in New
Bedford, Mass., and works
with the city's federal jobs
program.
When asked whether he
would get as involved again,
Khazan chuckled and quoted
singer 8.8. King "The things I
used to do, Lord, I don't do
them no more."
McNeil is a stockbroker in
Fayetteville. Alter college he
entered the Air Force, rising to
the rank ot major betore he
left.
"It taught you an awful lot
about lite quickly," McNeil
said ol the sit-ins. . . ."What
essentially we were striving tor
was the opportunity to do
things. We never expected it to
be handed to us. To the extent
that we've achieved that, it was
worthwhile."

What they did changed the
course of American history.
What they have become is a
history lesson itself.
Friday marks the 20th an
niversary of the beginning ot
the lunch counter sit-ins in
Greensboro. Within days, sit
ins for integration of public
tacilities had spread to S4 cities
in nine states. Within a year,
more than 100 cities had de
segregated some public
tacilities.
"In sitting down," the late
Frank Porter Graham, a one
time Democratic senator from
North Carolina, said during the
subsequent years ol protests,
"(the demonstrators) are
standing up for the American
dream."
Ezell Blair |r. — now Jibreel
Khazan — Franklin McCain,
loseph McNeil and David
Richmond left their North
Carolina A&T State College
dormitory about 4 p.m. on Feb.
I, 1960, to walk to the 112 .W.
Woolworth store downtown.
'It took us a while to get the
courage to go," Richmond re
called recently. "The manager
came and told us to leave; the
waitresses told us to leave.
When the police arrived, they
just stood there. They didn't
know what to do.
"I was the most fearful. It
you had said boo,' I probably
would have tallen oft the
stool," he said.
Richmond, now living in
Franklinton, has been un
employed for six months. He
has worked in federal job
programs and does odd jobs.
Richmond is the only one of
the four who did not complete
college.
"A lot ot negative things
have happened to me since,"
he said, but added, "If you take
the risk, you have to be able to
"cept the consequences."
i or McNeil, "The need tor
(the sit-ins) was very obvious.
On his way home from New
York after Christmas, McNeil
was refused service at a lunch
c ounter at the Greensboro bus
station.
"This disturbed him
greatly," said Khazan. "We
discussed this. He suggested a
boycott, but we didn't know
exactly what (to do.)"
The night before the sit-in,

Khazan visited his parents. He
asked it they would be embar
rassed it he got into trouble.
"Whyr' they asked.
"Because tomorrow we're
going to do something that will
shake up this town," he re
plied.
"I had a premonition ... I
had a leeling this was some
thing big, but I didn't have any
idea it would have the ramitica
tions it did," Khazan said last
week. "We were not trained
politically; we knew nothing
about law. Everything we knew
came from church and trom
school."
Khazan said his role in the
sit-ins was a high spot in his
lite. He added, however, "I
consider my contribution just
one drop, no more."

Khazan now lives in New
Bedford, Mass., and works
with the city's federal jobs
program.
When asked whether he
would get as involved again,
Khazan chuckled and quoted
singer 8.8. King "The things I
used to do, Lord, I don't do
them no more."
McNeil is a stockbroker in
Fayetteville. Alter college he
entered the Air Force, rising to
the rank ot major betore he
left.
"It taught you an awful lot
about lite quickly," McNeil
said ol the sit-ins. . . ."What
essentially we were striving tor
was the opportunity to do
things. We never expected it to
be handed to us. To the extent
that we've achieved that, it was
worthwhile."
