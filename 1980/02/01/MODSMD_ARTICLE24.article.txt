This just may be the final installation of this
column. Whether you greet this news with
howls ot delight or moans of bereavement, we
would greatly appreciate your input on the mat
ter. After all my very livelihood depends upon it.
Perusing my backlog of questions, I dug out a
lew animated ones tor this momentous, grief
laden occasion.
When I took organic chemistry, my professor
said that drinking heavy water would screw up a
person's metabolic system because some
biochemical processes depend strongly on the
kinetic properties of normal hydrogen.
Deuterium moves a bit more slowly than normal
hydrogen, so reactions involving it don't pro
ceed at quite the same rate What would be the

Dear Water Weight,
Upon tirst reading your question, I perceived
that you were attempting to expose me as a
non-science person, a thought which re-evoked
my haunting Chem. 31 nightmares. I also won
dered it you were alluding to your social pro
wess with your choice ot pseudonym. Further, I
was strangely reminded of an episode of Ho
gan's Heroes, in which Sgt. Schultz unwittingly
consumed large quantities ot heavy water.
Anyway, to answer your query, according to
Dr. Richard McCall, a health physicist at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and
Dr. |ohn DePangher, the senior health physicist
for the campus Risk Management, most D j O is a
controlled substance, like plutonium, and is,
thus, virtually impossible to obtain (should you
have any funny ideas).
My sources contend that it would take con
tinuous ingestion of large quantities of D 2 to
replace body water, at which time some cellular
changes might occur. Still, no mammal ex
periments have been undertaken to either
prove or refute your professor's claim. It is,
however, unlikely that mass quaffing ot heavy
water would produce any appreciable or notice
able effect in man.
Voici a couple ot questions referent to previ
ous columns (pull out all your old, cherished
copies).
Your dietary advice raised one question that
I've been wondering about for some time. What
are the "Sugar Blues?" A lot of people I know say
that "sugar is poison for them; they feel better
when they avoid any food containing any sugar.
Is this related to hypoglycemia by any chance?
- Curious Sweet Tooth
Dear Sugar Baby,
A great deal of conjecture on "Sugar Blues" or
"hypoglycemia" appears frequently in popular
literature, so your question is not unfounded.
There articles claim that sugar consumption
causes states of anxiety, depression and more
harmful disorders.

There is, though, no scientific basis tor such
speculation, according to Dr. Vincent D'Andrea
ot Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS). But, he did add that it is, nonetheless,
true that many people, especially when under
stress, feel better when maintaining high
protein, low-sugar diet (e.g. milk, meat, tish,
cheese, peanuts, peanut butter, rather than sin
tul sweets), when eating frequent small meals
(tive times per day) and when not abstaining
from eating over long periods ot time.
This next question is, I must say, quite ap
propriate to my current mood and the current
status ot this publication.
I read the column about feeling down after
vacation. I teel that way a lot. Sometimes I can
hardly do anything, and I teel alienated by
people, by Stanford and by the world. Is this just
a phase?
-Depressed
Normal ups and downs may include longer
periods ot being "down',' said Dr. D'Andrea. He
did provide the following checklist, which is not
all-inclusive, of signs ot true depression in
young people.
On the psychological side:
DMood of sadness; "a down in the dumps."
2) Slowed thinking
3) Unreasonable guilt about the past.
4) Crying spells tor no apparent reason.
5) Inability to concentrate.
6) Reduced sex drive and interest.
7) Reduced appetite, which leads to weight loss.
8) Suicidal thinking and/or attempts.
Physically:
1) Sleep problems are always present in depres
sion cases; either too much sleep in terms ot
quantity or early morning wake-up accom
panied by guilty, sad or lonely emotions.
2) Constipation (present 70 to 80 percent ot the
time in these cases.)
3) Poor appetite with weight loss (live to 10
pounds per month or more).
4) Feeling tired, characteristically in the morn
ing, a condition which improves as the day prog
resses. This fatigue does not respond to more
rest or a decreased work load.
5) Anxious feelings, palpitations, headache, diz
ziness, dry mouth, shortness of breath, impo
tence or frigidity.
In general, depression seems to afflict two
personality types most frequently: a passive,
helpless, overly dependent person or a rigid,
uncompromising, suspicious, socially isolated
individual. It's also more common among
women than men.
Most depressions will lapse with time (six to
nine months), but treatment shortens the
period and reduces the suffering and instability
of the mood.

On that note, I'll bade you tarewell, tor now or
forever. Please send your condolences or re
monstrances to On Call, c/o The Stantord Daily,
