### Rose Chan 
The premiere ol the dramatic pro
due tion Song for a Nisei Fisherman vyill
top oft the Asian American Art and Cul
ture Series being sponsored jointly by
Okada House and the Asian American
Theatre Project this quarter.
Called "Our Whole Voice," the art
series' weekly programs will bring in
artists "who can portray the experience
ot Asians in America as vividly and
beaulll cjlly as only artists can," said the
proposal.
The series includes presentations on
Asian American film, music, dance,
drama, literature and art. The next
program will teature the pilot ot
Hitohata - Raise the Manner!, a teature
film on the first generation of Japanese
in America. The film's associate pro
ducer, Nancy Araki, will lead a discus
sion on the film.
Japanese instruments such as the
taiko and shakochi joining the familiar
guitar, violin and electric piano, will be
in the Asian American Musicians Or

ganization s presentation on Feb. 12.
"Unbound Feet," a group ot six
Chinese American women poets, will
read original works and complement
them with costuming, staging and
choral treatment. Also coming are the
Asian American Dance Collective, the
Asian American heatre Workshop and
Philippine) American painter Carlos
Villa.
"It's on a much bigger scale this
year," said committee member Leo Liu
about the Art Series which was intro
duced last year at the house.
"As much as possible, these presen
tations are not just performances. They
are definitely educational experiences.
The artist comes and talks about the
process ot his art — how they got in
volved and how they became artists. I
think this is exceptionally important in
the case ot a Third World or ethnic ar
tist," Liu said.
The committee's main setback so tar
has been the ottice of Residential Edu
cation's disappointing tinancial sup

port, said Liu. The residential depart
ment has only agreed to contribute
one-third ot what was requested. More
than one-half ol the funding will come
trom student activities' sources such as
the Office ot Student Activities, the
People's Teahouse, SCIRE and the
Speakers' Bureau.
"We've applied to a lot ot places, but
we haven't heard from them yet," said
housing associate (RA) Linda Shaw.
"Basically, most of the sources have
been impressed with the program and
proposal and are supportive."
It the problems with tunding work
out, Okada will have Philip Gotanda as
artist-in-residence. Gotanda, who
wrote the script and music of Song for a
!\lisei Fisherman, also excels in
ceramics, film and musical perfor
mance. "The artist-in-residence is out
standing," said Liu. "The play we are
doing is commissioned by a major
theater company in Los Angeles and
he's letting us produce it here."
Fhe play will be directed by David

Huang, a 1979 LJniversity graduate who
wrote and dtrec ted last year's Art Series
production, I OH. Huang was one ot Y1
playwrights invited to the Eugene
O'Neill National Playwrights Confer
ence last year, as well as the youngest
writer and the lirst Asian American so
honored.
Nancy Takashshi, the producer, also
heads the year-old Asian American
Theatre Project, a pioneer group in
Asian American student theater. "We
thought it was important lor Asian
Americans to be able to be portrayed in
ways that make them seem like real
people. In mainstream media, the only
exposure we get to Asian faces is Char
lie Chan movies and as caricatures of
Asian people," said Takahashi.
"Also, we want a low-key way ot get
ting people involved in theater. In gen
eral a lot ot Asians don't teel comforta
ble going to Ram's Head or The Com
pany, either because there are no roles
for them or it's too big a jump," she
said.

Hitohata - Raise the Manner!, a teature
film on the first generation of Japanese
in America. The film's associate pro
ducer, Nancy Araki, will lead a discus
sion on the film.
Japanese instruments such as the
taiko and shakochi joining the familiar
guitar, violin and electric piano, will be
in the Asian American Musicians Or

ganization s presentation on Feb. 12.
"Unbound Feet," a group ot six
Chinese American women poets, will
read original works and complement
them with costuming, staging and
choral treatment. Also coming are the
Asian American Dance Collective, the
Asian American heatre Workshop and
Philippine) American painter Carlos
Villa.
"It's on a much bigger scale this
year," said committee member Leo Liu
about the Art Series which was intro
duced last year at the house.
"As much as possible, these presen
tations are not just performances. They
are definitely educational experiences.
The artist comes and talks about the
process ot his art — how they got in
volved and how they became artists. I
think this is exceptionally important in
the case ot a Third World or ethnic ar
tist," Liu said.
The committee's main setback so tar
has been the ottice of Residential Edu
cation's disappointing tinancial sup

port, said Liu. The residential depart
ment has only agreed to contribute
one-third ot what was requested. More
than one-half ol the funding will come
trom student activities' sources such as
the Office ot Student Activities, the
People's Teahouse, SCIRE and the
Speakers' Bureau.
"We've applied to a lot ot places, but
we haven't heard from them yet," said
housing associate (RA) Linda Shaw.
"Basically, most of the sources have
been impressed with the program and
proposal and are supportive."
It the problems with tunding work
out, Okada will have Philip Gotanda as
artist-in-residence. Gotanda, who
wrote the script and music of Song for a
!\lisei Fisherman, also excels in
ceramics, film and musical perfor
mance. "The artist-in-residence is out
standing," said Liu. "The play we are
doing is commissioned by a major
theater company in Los Angeles and
he's letting us produce it here."
Fhe play will be directed by David

Huang, a 1979 LJniversity graduate who
wrote and dtrec ted last year's Art Series
production, I OH. Huang was one ot Y1
playwrights invited to the Eugene
O'Neill National Playwrights Confer
ence last year, as well as the youngest
writer and the lirst Asian American so
honored.
Nancy Takashshi, the producer, also
heads the year-old Asian American
Theatre Project, a pioneer group in
Asian American student theater. "We
thought it was important lor Asian
Americans to be able to be portrayed in
ways that make them seem like real
people. In mainstream media, the only
exposure we get to Asian faces is Char
lie Chan movies and as caricatures of
Asian people," said Takahashi.
"Also, we want a low-key way ot get
ting people involved in theater. In gen
eral a lot ot Asians don't teel comforta
ble going to Ram's Head or The Com
pany, either because there are no roles
for them or it's too big a jump," she
said.
