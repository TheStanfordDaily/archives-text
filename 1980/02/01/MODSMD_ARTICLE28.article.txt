# Brown pledges to push conservation
## 
### 
Los Angeles (AP) — Gov. jerry
Brown's chief of staff said
Wednesday that conservation
will become one of the top
two or three priorities this
year' in the Brown administra
tion.
The state's Energy Conserva
tion Task Force headed by the
governor's aide, Gray Davis,
released a report calling for a
$700 million five-year program
ol energy conservation which
envisions a 16 percent savings
in energy usage by 1985 and a
cost saving to the California
public ot $6.6 million.

"What's new about this
program," Davis said, "is that
we're putting our money
where our mouth is. Conserva
tion in normal times is just
good citizenship, but conser
vation in these times is patrio
tic."
Recommendations made
by the task torce in its report
covered four major areas ot
conservation.
"We're trying to reinforce
trends that are aleady out there
in the marketplace anyway,"
said Adriana Gianturco, head
of the California Department

of Transportation and a
member of the task force.
"We're talking about redi
rection of expenditure (in Cal
trans), no change in the
amount — but rather efforts to
encourage energy conserva
tion."
The most controversial task
force plan calls for the elimina
tion ot the state income tax de
duction for gas tax with that
money going to energy effi
cient transportation users in
the form of payments and cre
dits.
Among the other energy

conservation recommenda
tions in transportation were in
centives tor individuals and
businesses to promote car and
van pools, stricter enforce
ment ot the 55-mph speed limit
through acquisition ot 1325
new radar units, and a state
constitutional amendment to
permit the use ot gasoline tax
revenues for any transporta
tion purpose.
Initiatives aimed at electrical
and natural gas conservation
revolved around proposed
state programs to promote
financing ot solar energy
equipment through public
utilities. John Bryson, head of
the state Public Utilities Com
mission and also member of
the task force, said, "We're try
ing to use the resources of the
state to make conservation
clearly in the individual's self
interest."
Housing proposals included
measures to encourage im
provement in energy efficiency
tor new housing projects as
well as in state buildings.
Russell Schweickart, a
member of the task force who
advises the governor on
energy matters, said the thrust
of the report is to encourage
"better management" by
utilities through audits or their
supplies to the public and
financing programs for weath
erization, diversion of peak
load energy demand periods
and support for low-interest
loans for solar water heaters.
"We're trying to change so
cial behavior," said Davis in
summarizing the report, "and
make tomorrow come faster
than it otherwise could."
