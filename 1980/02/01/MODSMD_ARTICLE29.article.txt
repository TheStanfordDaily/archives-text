# BUG ME

### Andrew Rich 
So you thought this column was silly, light
hearted, and ineffectual, did you? Well, some
times it is. But every now and then something
actually comes of an inquiry to Bug Me. For
example:
Last week I addressed a question about the
signal at Palm Drive and Arboretum. A reader
asked whether the signal cycle could be shor
tened late at night or set to blink after a pre
designated hour.
This week Al Cenevro in Maintenance Opera
tions told me that a contractor has been called to
examine the stoplight. The signal has an old
inoperative blinking unit, and "we're going to
get it back into service," Genevro said.
If you're a senior, you've probably been ap
proached by a friend (or former friend) who
asked you to pledge away a fraction of your
future income for the Farm. Here are a couple of
your classmates who are curious about these
strange solicitors.
Dear Bug Me,
Every year about this time I hear people talking
about the Student Development Program, espe
cially the Senior Pledge Program. Well, I'm one
of those uninformed seniors who is about to be
hit up for some cash and I want to know what it's
all about. Sign me. . . .

Bug Me:
What's the meaning of the slogan "Get a Piece
of the Farm'' which I see everywhere? Does it
mean that if we pledge money, they will give us a
box of soilf
A red ink question
Lisa Sonne, a>> director of student develop
ment, is in charge ot two programs: the Heritage
Fund and the Senior Pledge Program. Both
programs involve fund raising by student volun
teers.
Money for the 25-year-old Heritage Fund is
solicited from Bay Area and Los Angeles
businesses. The fund has provided 300 scholar

ships for Stanlord students to date.
The more visible Senior Pledge Program is an
effort to make students more aware ot the finan
cial needs of the University, as well as to develop
class pride among the soon-to-be graduates.
Sonne points out that tuition, high as it seems,
still only pays for 49 percent of the cost of a
Stanford education.
The Pledge Program involves about 100 stu
dents, including a core committee and at least
one representative from each dorm. The goal of
the program is to contact each senior, including
those who graduated early. This is being done
through mailings, phone-a-thons, and personal
contact.
Senior Heidi Henkel is responsible for the
slogan "Get a Piece ot the Farm." The idea be
hind this theme is that somebody helped each of
us to "get a piece of the farm" by contributing
the missing 51 percent of the education cost at
Stanlord; now it's our chance to help those who
would like a similar scholastic opportunity.
No, contributors will not be given a box of
soil.
The goal ol the program is 100 percent partici
pation, even it the contributions are small. "It's
an exciting program and I feel honored to be
part of it," Sonne said.
Let 's end the column this week with some statis
tics. I have been asked how many students this
year are not from California, and how many are .
from the East Coast.
Not wanting to plague the Registrar's Office
with hours ot research, I simply asked for the
breakdown of the Freshman class. If 25 percent
are from Northern California and 21 percent are
from Southern California, that leaves 54 per
cent, right ? Of these, almost 11 percent are from
the Eastern Region.

sarily those of the editors of this paper. Send

them into the office and save the postage.
