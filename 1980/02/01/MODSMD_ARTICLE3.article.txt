### Richard Martinez 
It all goes as planned, Paul Wiggin,
tormer head toach for the Kansas
City Chiefs, will be named head
coach for Stanford this weekend.
Assistant Athletic Director Gary
Cavalli said that Wiggin headed the
list of persons under consideration.
Cavalli added that there would hi' a
press conference within the next two
days it last night's meeting with Wig
gin was Successful.'
The Peninsula Times Tribune appa
rently jumped the gun when it re
ported yesterday that Wiggin was
hired as Stanford's football coach.
Sports Information Director Bob
Rose emphatically refuted the story.
"We have not hired a coat h," he as
serted. "We are still in the process ol
hiring a coach. We are very in
terested in Paul Wiggin and he in us,
but there are still many wrinkles to be
ironed out before any decisions are
to be made."
Stanford alumnus
The Stanford campus is not an un
familiar place to Wiggin, who played
both offensive and defensive tackle
I K-1 e from 1954 lo 1956, earning All-
America honors at his defensive pos
ition in his junior and senior years.

He spent 11 years witli the Cleveland
Browns and made trips It) the Pro
Bowl in 1966 and 196f1.
He tame to the San I rancisco49ers
in I%H and was promoted to defen
sive coordinator under Dick Nolan in
1 974. He was offered the head coat h
mg job tor the Kansas City Chiefs in
I976and remained there tori 1 /.! years
belore being dismissed tor succes
sive 5-9 seasons. Wiggin then be
came an assistant t oach tor the New
Orleans Saints. He has never
coached on the college level.
Top of the list
Wiggin, who still sports the t rew
cut he wore in his playing days,
heads the list ol six persons under
consideration it)' the post.
The other five are:
lack Elway, the head coach at
San lose state and father of freshman
quarterback John Elway;
Denny Green, receivers and
special teams coach for the 49ers, a
former Stanford assistant under Bill
Walsh and the youngest of the can
didates;
Paul Hackett, the quarterback
coach at DSC;
— lohn Mackovic, head coach <it
Wake and former assistant at
San Jose State;
— Dick Coury, wide receivers

(o.ich tor the Philadelphia Eagles and
former head coach of the Portland
Storm ot the defunt t World football
League.
Wiggin, 4 1 ), returned to his New
Orleans home Wednesday evening
alter spending more than two hours
interviewing with the seven-member
committee, Geiger and interim
coat h Doug Single.
No offensive t redentials
The biggest surprise that comes
with the talk ol Wiggin s appoint
ment is his obvious Ik k ot offensive
credentials, coaching the team with
the most sophisticated college of
fense in the country.
As fie said in an interview trom his
home Wednesday night, "If I got the
job, the lust thing I would do is bring
in an assistant who would he super
with the offense."
Wiggin could, however, be seen as
providing some expertise in an area
where the C ardinals have been lack
ing 11)r a long time defensive
strength.
Community support
According to the S.in /ose Mercury,
the day after Dowhower quit to be
come the offensive coordinator for
the Denver Broncos, a groundswell
of alumni support lor Wiggin was
mounted and Geiger asked him to tly
id from the Pro Howl in Hawaii.
Cieiger had said earlier that the
new Stanford football coach would
have to be "acceptable to I fie Stan
ford community," betausethe coath
could not succeed without local
support.
The panel was not only impressed
with Wiggin's coaching experience
in the National Football l eague but
alst) with his ability to bridge two
generations to tonimuniiate with
what Stanford people call "the un
iqueness of the student-athletes,
according ft) the San /ose Mercury.
The panel also believes that he is
not going to depart, as Dowhower
did, after one yearat the head coach
ing position, th(> Mercury reported.
The rapid departure rate ot Stan
ford head coaches is a recent
phenomenon. John Ralston held the
position from 1964 to 1971 and |atk
Christiansen steered the Stanford
ship from '72 to' 76. Walsh lasted only
the '77 and '78 seasons, however,
and Dowhower remained but a
single year.
The Cardinals recorded a 6-4-1 re
tort) under Dowhower last season.
Although losing to Oregon J3-31, the
Ducks forfeited all conference vic
tories for NCAA infractions.
