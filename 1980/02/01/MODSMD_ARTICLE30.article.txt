# 'Semester at Sea' offers classes on board, look at the world
## Four students here sail the oceans-for academic credit

The sky is streaked with
warm, crimson hues as the
sun rises over a chilled gray
sea. There is a hush on the
deck, broken only by the
muted sounds of Taiwanese
crew members performing
their morning Tai Chi ritual
at the tar end of the ship.
The sting ot salty sea
breezes teels good on your
face. Your thoughts tocus
on the day's plans — a dock
ing in Madras, India, an ex
cursion to the Taj Mahal,
and then . . . perhaps
Nepal > But port is still hours
away, leaving plenty ot time
tor some volleyball, a swim
and suntanning around the
pool with Iriends.
Daydreams ot a Meyer
library captive during mid
term week?
Perhaps. But this was
more than a dream for the
tour Stanford students who
spent fall quarter traveling
around the world, while
earning academic credit.
Participating in a program
called Semester at Sea, 475

students spent 3 x /i months
sailing to 11 countries in
Asia, Atrica and South
America.
Classes on board
The program, which is
administered by the Insti
tute lor Shipboard Educa
tion in Laguna Hills,
Calilornia, is academically
sponsored by the University
of Colorado at Boulder.
Students take tour out of a
possible 60 classes, which
are taught by 30 professors.
Admission requirements
are minimal. An applicant
must have a 2.0 grade point
average — and about $8000
(approximately $6000 for
tuition and another $2000
tor expenses).
But according to.Cheryl
lohnson and )ohn Staen
berg, two ot the four Stan
lord participants, the ex
periences gained are well
worth the expense.
Interaction...
Most valued by both stu
dents were those experi
ences involving interaction
with the natives ot a particu
lar country.
"People everywhere were

incredibly Iriendly and
helptul," said Staenberg.
"There were so many
stories ot students being
taken to natives' houses,
given a meal and taken
around the city."
By way of example,
Staenberg described the
experiences ot two students
who flew up to the Andes,
after the boat had docked in
Venezuela, with the inten
tion of hiking to the top.
"They didn't know what
they were getting into," he
said. "They went up there
with their OP (Ocean
Pacific) shorts and shirts,
without realizing that it
would be freezing cold.
Friendship
"As it turned out, a poor
larmer tound them and took
them in for the night. He
made them dinner and gave
them his own bed. The next
morning he gave them
some mules and actually
made the 25-mile trip with
them.
"The friendship and rap
port they had made in just a
day and a half was amaz
ing."

lohnson experienced her
own sense of rapport with
an elderly rickshaw driver
in India during a brief ex
change of roles. She and a
triend engaged a rickshaw,
which is basically a bicycle
driven carriage, to take
them Irom their hotel to the
Taj Mahal.
"On the way back I asked
the rickshaw driver it I
could drive," said lohnson.
"He was kind of surprised,
but let me have his seat. He
started to walk along beside
until I told him, 'No, no! Get
in. I'll drive you!'
"We kept on passing
other drivers and shopow
ners he knew who laughed
and waved at us They
couldn't believe that this
American, and a female no
less, was driving the
rickshaw!"
Land travel too
In each port, students
were responsible tor devis
ing their own travel plans
during the average four- or
five-day stay. People's plans
depended upon their in
genuity and financial re
sources, said lohnson, and

ranged from a simple walk
around the city, to an elabo
rate train or air excursion to
more distant areas.
The danger of making
such extended travel plans
was the possibility of not
making it back to their port
city before the boat's depar
ture. Such a nightmare be
came reality for two stu
dents who flew from Mad
ras to Nepal and then went
backpacking in the Everest
mountain range, said
Johnson.
Their return flight was
unexpectedly delayed, they
missed the boat, and had to
take a flight to the boat's
next scheduled port three
days later.
In many ports, students
had the option to take a pay
trip pre-arranged by Semes
teratSea. One such trip was
a three-day excursion from
Hong Kong to Canton,
China, for $300.
China trip
One of Staenberg's most
memorable experiences
occurred during the China
trip while visiting the Cul
tural Park (amusement

park). Having heard that the
Chinese are not familiar
with soap bubbles, Staen
berg had brought some
along and began blowing
them in the park.
"I've never seen a crowd
gather so last!" said Staen
berg. "Pretty soon I had
some ot the little kids doing
it and everybody would
cheer and clap if they did it
well."

Later, upon their arrival at
the Park's basketball court,
the students were given a
standing ovation by the
Chinese gathered there.
"They stopped their
game, brought out hot wa
ter, towels and jerseys for
us," said Staenberg. "We
got killed by their team, but
every time we did some
thing well, they just went
wild!"

But according to.Cheryl
lohnson and )ohn Staen
berg, two ot the four Stan
lord participants, the ex
periences gained are well
worth the expense.
Interaction...
Most valued by both stu
dents were those experi
ences involving interaction
with the natives ot a particu
lar country.
"People everywhere were

incredibly Iriendly and
helptul," said Staenberg.
"There were so many
stories ot students being
taken to natives' houses,
given a meal and taken
around the city."
By way of example,
Staenberg described the
experiences ot two students
who flew up to the Andes,
after the boat had docked in
Venezuela, with the inten
tion of hiking to the top.
"They didn't know what
they were getting into," he
said. "They went up there
with their OP (Ocean
Pacific) shorts and shirts,
without realizing that it
would be freezing cold.
Friendship
"As it turned out, a poor
larmer tound them and took
them in for the night. He
made them dinner and gave
them his own bed. The next
morning he gave them
some mules and actually
made the 25-mile trip with
them.
"The friendship and rap
port they had made in just a
day and a half was amaz
ing."

lohnson experienced her
own sense of rapport with
an elderly rickshaw driver
in India during a brief ex
change of roles. She and a
triend engaged a rickshaw,
which is basically a bicycle
driven carriage, to take
them Irom their hotel to the
Taj Mahal.
"On the way back I asked
the rickshaw driver it I
could drive," said lohnson.
"He was kind of surprised,
but let me have his seat. He
started to walk along beside
until I told him, 'No, no! Get
in. I'll drive you!'
"We kept on passing
other drivers and shopow
ners he knew who laughed
and waved at us They
couldn't believe that this
American, and a female no
less, was driving the
rickshaw!"
Land travel too
In each port, students
were responsible tor devis
ing their own travel plans
during the average four- or
five-day stay. People's plans
depended upon their in
genuity and financial re
sources, said lohnson, and

ranged from a simple walk
around the city, to an elabo
rate train or air excursion to
more distant areas.
The danger of making
such extended travel plans
was the possibility of not
making it back to their port
city before the boat's depar
ture. Such a nightmare be
came reality for two stu
dents who flew from Mad
ras to Nepal and then went
backpacking in the Everest
mountain range, said
Johnson.
Their return flight was
unexpectedly delayed, they
missed the boat, and had to
take a flight to the boat's
next scheduled port three
days later.
In many ports, students
had the option to take a pay
trip pre-arranged by Semes
teratSea. One such trip was
a three-day excursion from
Hong Kong to Canton,
China, for $300.
China trip
One of Staenberg's most
memorable experiences
occurred during the China
trip while visiting the Cul
tural Park (amusement

park). Having heard that the
Chinese are not familiar
with soap bubbles, Staen
berg had brought some
along and began blowing
them in the park.
"I've never seen a crowd
gather so last!" said Staen
berg. "Pretty soon I had
some ot the little kids doing
it and everybody would
cheer and clap if they did it
well."

Later, upon their arrival at
the Park's basketball court,
the students were given a
standing ovation by the
Chinese gathered there.
"They stopped their
game, brought out hot wa
ter, towels and jerseys for
us," said Staenberg. "We
got killed by their team, but
every time we did some
thing well, they just went
wild!"
