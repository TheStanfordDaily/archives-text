## Southwest swimmers to meet Cards this weekend 
### Dianne Cahoon 
The swim meets that
•"everyone's been waiting tor
take place this weekend at de-
Guerre Pools, beginning with
the men's contest against a
star-studded Arizona team this
afternoon at 2 p.m.
Then, there will be tireworks
Saturday, according to Card
assistant coach Stu Corliss, as a
teady-to-wrangle pack from
Texas ropes itself into a match
with the women at 1:30 p.m.
"On paper, our meet looks
extremely close," said coach
Skip Kenney of the men's
Arizona duel. Claiming such
VIPs as Greg Jagenberg, Tim
' Shaw and Bob Jackson, the de

7 would say that the four fastest
backstrokers in the nation will be racing'
in tomorrow's Stanford-Texas meet.
-Skip Kenney

sert dusters were ranked
eighth nationally by Swimming
World magazine earlier this
season.
Close matches to watch
should be the 1000 freestyle,
where Stanford's steadily im
proving Bari Weick will test
wits and stamina against foes of
equal ability; the backstroke
events, where the Cards' Wade
Flemons will take on )ackson,
the national 100-yard champ;
and the 100 free, featuring a
horde of similar speeds.
"Diving will be important,"
Kenney foretold. "On paper

we can't win either board, but
we'd still like to split their two
divers." If Bryan McCleve ex
tends his string of classic per
formances, that possibility
could well materialize.
Jagenberg, the national
champion in the 200 butterfly,
looks invincible in that event
and will probably swim to vic
tory in the 200 free as well.
Shaw, the former distance
swimmer and Sullivan winner
turned-backstroker, can be
counted on for rigorous com
petition no matter which
events he chooses to swim.
For Kenney, Shaw's visit is
particularly sentimental. "I
used to coach Tim Shaw,"

Kenney said, "and this will be
the first time in his career that
I've been in a position to root
against him."
The 4(X) medley relay will be
replaced by the 100
backstroke, breaststroke and
butterfly events because,
"They have depth, and we
want good races and the
chance to make NCAA stan
dards," Kenney said.
The women's meet should
be the most exciting and
talented assemblage of the

year at deGuerre.
The Lone Star staters
finished fourth nationally last
year, compared to Stanford's
third. This year, however, both
teams are firmly in the running
in a five-team logjam for top
honors. Tomorrow's meet
could be indicative of that final
outcome.
"On paper Texas is ex
tremely fast because of what
they did against Florida last
week," Kenney said. "What
they did last week" was rest for
the contest, which they lost
anyway to last year's No. 1
squad in the nation. Tomor
row's intrigue, thus, rests upon
one major factor: whether the
Longhorns have continued
their rest period for another
week or whether they have re
turned to the workout poo'.
"I think we have better
athletes," Kenney asserted. "If
the rest is the same, we should
win."
The Texans include Joan
Pennington, the women's col
legiate athlete of the year last
year and one of the few women
in the world vyho could press
the Cards' linda Jezek in the
backstroke. With UT
backstroker Diane Gerard and
Stanfordite Kim Carlisle, "I
would say that the four fastest
backstrokers in the nation will
be racing," Kenney adjudged.
Jill Sterkel, the fastest
woman in water, holding the
AIAW 50-free record in 22.9,
will also punch the clock for
the Longhorns tomorrow.

Jill Sterkel, the fastest
woman in water, holding the
AIAW 50-free record in 22.9,
will also punch the clock for
the Longhorns tomorrow.
The swim meets that
•"everyone's been waiting tor
take place this weekend at de-
Guerre Pools, beginning with
the men's contest against a
star-studded Arizona team this
afternoon at 2 p.m.
Then, there will be tireworks
Saturday, according to Card
assistant coach Stu Corliss, as a
teady-to-wrangle pack from
Texas ropes itself into a match
with the women at 1:30 p.m.
"On paper, our meet looks
extremely close," said coach
Skip Kenney of the men's
Arizona duel. Claiming such
VIPs as Greg Jagenberg, Tim
' Shaw and Bob Jackson, the de

7 would say that the four fastest
backstrokers in the nation will be racing'
in tomorrow's Stanford-Texas meet.
-Skip Kenney

sert dusters were ranked
eighth nationally by Swimming
World magazine earlier this
season.
Close matches to watch
should be the 1000 freestyle,
where Stanford's steadily im
proving Bari Weick will test
wits and stamina against foes of
equal ability; the backstroke
events, where the Cards' Wade
Flemons will take on )ackson,
the national 100-yard champ;
and the 100 free, featuring a
horde of similar speeds.
"Diving will be important,"
Kenney foretold. "On paper

we can't win either board, but
we'd still like to split their two
divers." If Bryan McCleve ex
tends his string of classic per
formances, that possibility
could well materialize.
Jagenberg, the national
champion in the 200 butterfly,
looks invincible in that event
and will probably swim to vic
tory in the 200 free as well.
Shaw, the former distance
swimmer and Sullivan winner
turned-backstroker, can be
counted on for rigorous com
petition no matter which
events he chooses to swim.
For Kenney, Shaw's visit is
particularly sentimental. "I
used to coach Tim Shaw,"

Kenney said, "and this will be
the first time in his career that
I've been in a position to root
against him."
The 4(X) medley relay will be
replaced by the 100
backstroke, breaststroke and
butterfly events because,
"They have depth, and we
want good races and the
chance to make NCAA stan
dards," Kenney said.
The women's meet should
be the most exciting and
talented assemblage of the

year at deGuerre.
The Lone Star staters
finished fourth nationally last
year, compared to Stanford's
third. This year, however, both
teams are firmly in the running
in a five-team logjam for top
honors. Tomorrow's meet
could be indicative of that final
outcome.
"On paper Texas is ex
tremely fast because of what
they did against Florida last
week," Kenney said. "What
they did last week" was rest for
the contest, which they lost
anyway to last year's No. 1
squad in the nation. Tomor
row's intrigue, thus, rests upon
one major factor: whether the
Longhorns have continued
their rest period for another
week or whether they have re
turned to the workout poo'.
"I think we have better
athletes," Kenney asserted. "If
the rest is the same, we should
win."
The Texans include Joan
Pennington, the women's col
legiate athlete of the year last
year and one of the few women
in the world vyho could press
the Cards' linda Jezek in the
backstroke. With UT
backstroker Diane Gerard and
Stanfordite Kim Carlisle, "I
would say that the four fastest
backstrokers in the nation will
be racing," Kenney adjudged.
Jill Sterkel, the fastest
woman in water, holding the
AIAW 50-free record in 22.9,
will also punch the clock for
the Longhorns tomorrow.
