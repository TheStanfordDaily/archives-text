How does a team end up Number
One in its conference even though 95
percent of its -members never com
peted in the sport before they came to
Stanford?
Stanford fencing team coach jean
Helliwell does not hesitate in her re
sponse: "Footwork, form and brains."
Though this may not be the elusive
success formula for every team, it's
hard to question the method of the 16-
year coach whose team just finished
first in its conference after a decisive vic
tory over San Jose State last Friday
evening, 19-17.
"You've got to get out there against a
guy you've never seen before, figure
out his strengths and weaknesses, and
go out and get him at 70 mph. We train
and teach them to either know what
your opposition's going to do, or make
him do it. It's intelligence, and that's
what Stanford has," concludes Hel
liwell.
Stanford's fencing team has been
doing superbly since a victory over
Sonoma opened their official season,
Oct. 27. Competing with San lose
State, San Francisco State, California,
Sonoma and Sacramento State in a
"Dual Meet Season, Home and Home"
(teams play one another twice), Stan
ford lost only one match, a 15-21 capitu
lation to San Francisco State. This de
feat was recouped by a 25-11 victory
over the same team three weeks later.
But Stanford fencers only managed
an 18-18 tie with No. 1 rival and five
year defending Conference Champion
San lose State in a Nov. 2 meet.
Individual statistics for the season

again reflect Card prowess: over 50
percent of the team had at least two
times more points scored than lost, and
all but two team members attained
more points than they lost. (Points are
scored by winning a bout. A bout is
taken by the first fencer who makes five
hits on his opponent.)
Men's foil team captain John Burgess
led the win-loss scoring with an impre
ssive 21-3 average, while women's foil
captain Eva Lohrer's 18-8 record
headed the women's team.
Nonetheless, with only two matches
left in the season Stanford's main ad
versary, San lose State, remained un
defeated. These top-ranked rivals met
here last Friday to determine the con
ference victors.
Stanford was behind 11-4 at the end
of the first two rounds, women's foil
and saber (San jose's women's foil
team has been first in the nation forfive
years). But the tinal rounds, men's foil
and epee, brought the Cards a 19-17
victory.
Why was Stanford able to beat San
lose State this year?
Coach Helliwell explains: "Well, we
were lucky to have our top three men
return as co-terminal students instead
of graduating — that gave the men
strength. And in epee, though two men
had never competed before, they've
done nothing but get better and bet
ter."
Men's foil team member Ray Langley
says it was a combination of things: "A
couple of years ago we had some
people who were great — John
Burgess, Duncan Proudfoot — who
were good examples to follow. We

novices worked hard towards that goal.
Also, San lose State isn't as strong this
year. Their best scholarship fencers
graduated last year."
Peter Costigan, captain of the saber
group, credits the first-year assistant
coach, Buzz Hurst; "Buzz was a lot of it
for the saber team. Also, there was a
good deal of renewed interest in fenc
ing from people in general and (Athle
tic Director) Andy Geiger especially. It
made us really up for it — ready to
win."
The Cards' regular season ended a
day after tha San lose State game in a
17-1 victory over Sacramento State. But
taking the conference is conquering
only the first step in the echelon of
national fencing competition. The
team is now preparing for individual
Championships at San lose Feb. 2,
where nine teams, UCLA, Cal State-
Northridge, Cal State-Los Angeles,
UCSD, Cal State-Long Beach, San lose
State, Air Force Academy, Cal State-
Fullerton and Stanford will compete in
team round roL)ins.
Coach Helliwell seems confident of
Stanford domination at the tourna
ment: "We fully expect to get to the
finals. Beyond that it's individual com
petition. I think we can win the region
al. Of all the teams in the region, we
have the best chance."
Costigan said he is less sure of the
championship's outcome: "It's going
to be tough. We're taking it seriously,
though, especially after the San Jose
State victory. Beating them really made
us come together. We criticize and
compliment, and stick together as a
team."
