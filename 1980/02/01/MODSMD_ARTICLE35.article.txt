# The 						Friday interview
## Players come for a university, not a coach 
### 
In the wake of head coach
Rod Dowhower's sudden res
ignation to accept a coaching
position with the National
Football League's Denver
Broncos, Doug Single has been
serving as interim head coach
for Stanford's football prog
ram. Serving in a similar capac
ity between coaches lack
Christiansen and Bill Walsh
and again between the careers
of Walsh and Rod Dowhower,
Single's experience with these
situations has provided him
with much insight, as Sally len
kins reports.
Jenkins: What kind of respon
sibilities do you see as most
important in your position as
interim head coach?
Single: Initially my most impor
tant responsibility is to recruit
the best student-athlete possi

ble, and to keep the recruiting
effort going. I must say that Ray
Handley, an assistant on the
staff, has done a great job; he's
been tremendously helpful.
I'm just following through on
his suggestions. February 20th
is the date for signing letters of
intent, and we have gotten in
touch with all the recruits.
Things are going very well,
(enkins: In terms of recruiting,
do you really think that the
prospects will be unaffected by
head coach Rod Dowhower's
resignation?
Single: We've contacted all the
prospects, and many of them
have indicated concern over
the situation; they would like
to know who is going to be
coaching here. Certainly some
kids are wavering. But I think
most of them are interested in

the University first, and the
coaching situation second.
Jenkins': Have you had any ex
perience at handling recruit
ing, or this kind of situation be
fore?
Single: Yes. I was recruiting
coordinator during my first
three years here at Stanford. I
was also the transition coach in
the period between Jack Chris
tiansen and Bill Walsh, and be
tween Bill Walsh and Rod
Dowhower. Sometimes I think
that's why they keep me
around. Again I have to say that
this staff has really done a good
job with the recruits, keeping
things together, so that we are
not very far behind in our ef
forts.
Jenkins: What kind of problems
do you anticipate, or have you
already run into? Are you ap

prehensive at all about your
job?
Single: No, I'm not really ap
prehensive. I'm involved in in
terviewing candidates for the
football job, and that really
takes a lot of time. Some of the
assistant coaches, well, we
want them to understand that
we are behind them 100 per
cent. When their boss leaves,
they naturally have doubts
about their futures, and they
need assurances that we want
their efforts on behalf of the
program.
Jenkins: You talked about inter
viewing candidates for the
coaching job. Are there any
specific candidates that you
can name?
Single: No, I'm not allowed to
at this point. I would like to be
able to share it with you, but
there are a lot of people who
naturally want to keep their
name out of print for the mo
ment, in case they don't get the
job. So I don't think I can di
vulge the names of the candi
dates right now.
lenkins: What about spring foot
ball practice? Do you expect to
have named a coach and have
everything tied up in time for
the new coach to direct spring
ball?
Single: Certainly. I think that
within the next 10 days we will
be able to name the new head
coach. We would very much
like to do it that quickly in
order to keep things going. I
think we can do it that quickly,
and yet be thorough as well,
lenkins: It seems strange that
coach Dowhower's resignation
was such a total surprise, espe
cially since he talked to people
from Denver here at Stanford.
Didn't you have any suspicion
at all that he was thinking along
those lines?
Single: No I didn't. And I think
Rod didn't let anyone know
because he wasn't sure until it
was upon him. Professional of
fers are so quick, and you have
little time to decide. It really is
not that unusual to have a
coach leave that quickly. We
were definitely caught by sur
prise. But that's the nature of
coaching positions.
lenkins: How would you
characterize your relationship
with Dowhowert
Single: We were very good
friends. We were assistants to
gether under Bill Walsh, and
spent a lot of time together.
We still are good friends,
lenkins: Why do you think he
would leave a head coaching

job for an assisting job? Do you
think the fact that it's a pro job
compensates for this?
Single: I think so. His reasons
are good ones. I think he felt
that the opportunity was tre
mendous. It's an organization
he thought he would be com
fortable with, it's a fine team
and organization. Maybe he
even thought it was a once
in-a-lifetime chance. So I don't
think it was dissatisfaction with
Stanford as much as it was the
opportunity.

important in your position as
interim head coach?
Single: Initially my most impor
tant responsibility is to recruit
the best student-athlete possi

ble, and to keep the recruiting
effort going. I must say that Ray
Handley, an assistant on the
staff, has done a great job; he's
been tremendously helpful.
I'm just following through on
his suggestions. February 20th
is the date for signing letters of
intent, and we have gotten in
touch with all the recruits.
Things are going very well,
(enkins: In terms of recruiting,
do you really think that the
prospects will be unaffected by
head coach Rod Dowhower's
resignation?
Single: We've contacted all the
prospects, and many of them
have indicated concern over
the situation; they would like
to know who is going to be
coaching here. Certainly some
kids are wavering. But I think
most of them are interested in

the University first, and the
coaching situation second.
Jenkins': Have you had any ex
perience at handling recruit
ing, or this kind of situation be
fore?
Single: Yes. I was recruiting
coordinator during my first
three years here at Stanford. I
was also the transition coach in
the period between Jack Chris
tiansen and Bill Walsh, and be
tween Bill Walsh and Rod
Dowhower. Sometimes I think
that's why they keep me
around. Again I have to say that
this staff has really done a good
job with the recruits, keeping
things together, so that we are
not very far behind in our ef
forts.
Jenkins: What kind of problems
do you anticipate, or have you
already run into? Are you ap

prehensive at all about your
job?
Single: No, I'm not really ap
prehensive. I'm involved in in
terviewing candidates for the
football job, and that really
takes a lot of time. Some of the
assistant coaches, well, we
want them to understand that
we are behind them 100 per
cent. When their boss leaves,
they naturally have doubts
about their futures, and they
need assurances that we want
their efforts on behalf of the
program.
Jenkins: You talked about inter
viewing candidates for the
coaching job. Are there any
specific candidates that you
can name?
Single: No, I'm not allowed to
at this point. I would like to be
able to share it with you, but
there are a lot of people who
naturally want to keep their
name out of print for the mo
ment, in case they don't get the
job. So I don't think I can di
vulge the names of the candi
dates right now.
lenkins: What about spring foot
ball practice? Do you expect to
have named a coach and have
everything tied up in time for
the new coach to direct spring
ball?
Single: Certainly. I think that
within the next 10 days we will
be able to name the new head
coach. We would very much
like to do it that quickly in
order to keep things going. I
think we can do it that quickly,
and yet be thorough as well,
lenkins: It seems strange that
coach Dowhower's resignation
was such a total surprise, espe
cially since he talked to people
from Denver here at Stanford.
Didn't you have any suspicion
at all that he was thinking along
those lines?
Single: No I didn't. And I think
Rod didn't let anyone know
because he wasn't sure until it
was upon him. Professional of
fers are so quick, and you have
little time to decide. It really is
not that unusual to have a
coach leave that quickly. We
were definitely caught by sur
prise. But that's the nature of
coaching positions.
lenkins: How would you
characterize your relationship
with Dowhowert
Single: We were very good
friends. We were assistants to
gether under Bill Walsh, and
spent a lot of time together.
We still are good friends,
lenkins: Why do you think he
would leave a head coaching

job for an assisting job? Do you
think the fact that it's a pro job
compensates for this?
Single: I think so. His reasons
are good ones. I think he felt
that the opportunity was tre
mendous. It's an organization
he thought he would be com
fortable with, it's a fine team
and organization. Maybe he
even thought it was a once
in-a-lifetime chance. So I don't
think it was dissatisfaction with
Stanford as much as it was the
opportunity.
In the wake of head coach
Rod Dowhower's sudden res
ignation to accept a coaching
position with the National
Football League's Denver
Broncos, Doug Single has been
serving as interim head coach
for Stanford's football prog
ram. Serving in a similar capac
ity between coaches lack
Christiansen and Bill Walsh
and again between the careers
of Walsh and Rod Dowhower,
Single's experience with these
situations has provided him
with much insight, as Sally len
kins reports.
