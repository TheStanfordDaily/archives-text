# Gymnasts to swing tonight
## 
### Dean Eyre 
Stanford's men and women
gymnasts swing into doub
leheader action tonight at
Maples Pavilion beginning at
7:30.
The two squads take the
floor under somewhat diffe
rent circumstances. Sadao
Hamada's men, 1-6 overall,
should be healthy and capable
of getting their second win at
the expense of Chico State.
lackie Walker's women,
rated 20th nationally and unde
feated against four opponents,
have an uphill battle ahead ot
them with injuries and Bth
ranked UCLA to overcome.
Among Walker's com
petitors, the most serious
question marks are sopho
mores Trina Wiggins and Karen
Hall. Both gymnasts are tenta
tively listed tor all-around
competition, but whether or
not they actually can enter all
four events tonight depends
on how their legs hold up.
"Trina's ankle is not quite
well and Karen's knee is not
quite well," Walker said yes
terday. "They want to go all
around."
In the Cardinals' last home
appearance, against sth-rated
USC, Wiggins' ankle injury
during vaulting prevented her
from completing her floor
exercise routine. Since that
|an. 12 meet, the ankle injury
has haunted Wiggins, keeping
her out of all-around competi
tion.
Almost the exact story can be
written about Hall's knee. In
tonight's competition, partici
pation by the duo will have to
be played by ear, and there's
more to the decision than
meets the eye.
While it obviously would be
an Achievement to upset the
Bruins, Walker has to weigh
the tradeoff ot resting Wiggins

and Hall for later meets, as the
Cards have to put together
team scores higher than 135 to
qualify for the AIAW nationals.
Entering the two prematurely
could prolong the recovery
from the injuries and jeopar
dize the results in those up
coming meets.
Despite the injuries and
pressure of competing with the
strong Bruin squad, the Stan
ford team is "pretty optimis
tic," Walker said. "They've had
good experiences — last year
they weren't supposed to beat
Arizona State and this year they
were not supposed to beat
USC." But they won both
matches.
In the men's competition,
Hamada predicted that his
squad will hit in the 253 to 258
range while Chico State will be
in the 245 to 250 range. With a

let-up in the pressure faced by
his gymnasts in every meet so
far this season, he changed his
workout strategy over the past
week.
"What we did this week was
to clean up the problem areas,
to aim for better form and
execution," Hamada said. "We
didn't do too many routines, so
I don't know if there will be any
improvement, but they should
look better."
Chico is ranked third in the
Division II and 111 gymnastics
competition, according to
Hamada. He singled out De
nnis Chase as a member of the
opposition to watch. Chase is
capable of hitting 53 points in
all-around, and he leads the
Division II and 111 schools in
all-around, floor exercises,
vaulting and high bar with a
9.00 average.
