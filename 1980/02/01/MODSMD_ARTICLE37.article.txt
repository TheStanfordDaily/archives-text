# Arizona nips Stanford in Tempe overtime, 95-88

### Chris Haft 
Tucson — Both seemed like miracles too big to
be true — first the 14-point lead in the second
half, then Doug Marty's remarkable 35-footer
that sent the game into overtime after the lead
had evaporated.
Well, miracles must not come in groups of
three, at least for Stanford's men's basketball
team. After playing intelligently and ferociously
for more than half the game, the Cardinals suc
cumbed to a similarly spirited Arizona effort and
lost in overtime at McKale Center last night,
95-88.
Stanford, which faces Arizona State at Tempe
in a regionally televised game tomorrow (Chan
nel 4, 2:p.m. PST), has now lost 15 consecutive
contests away from home dating back to last
season.
Record falls
This year, the Cards are 3-15 overall and 1-9 in
the Pacific-10 Conference.
But their woes really shouldn't have con
tinued last night. The Cards shot decently (49
percent), converted five Arizona turnovers into
10 points, received stalwart efforts from for
wards Kimberly Belton (27 points, 12 rebounds)
and Brian Welch (25 points, eight assists) and got
a surprisingly effective performance from sub
stitute Tom Schmalzried (eight points).
"We played with as much road confidence as
I've seen here at Stanford," head coach Dick
Dißiaso said.
Crowd support
However, Stanford's solid performance only
served as an example to Arizona in the late go
ing. Spurred by the crowd of 9475 and conscious
of the fact that they had lost their last four games
at McKale where they had won 87 of 95 before
this season, the Wildcats caught up in almost the
same fashion that Stanford, went ahead.
"We got ahead by 14 points the same way they
came back and took the lead late in the game —
by shooting well and hustling," Dißiaso said.
"That's why they got ahead — we missed some
freethrows and made some key turnovers and
that was it."

Shooting well and grabbing the lion's share of
the rebounds, the Cards opened up an early
22-10 lead and gave every indication of defeating
the Wildcats for the second straight time (Stan
ford blew by Arizona, 95-80 )an. 5 at Maples
Pavilion).
"I started wondering, 'Not this again,' "
Arizona guard )oe Nehls said.
14-point lead
A Stanford collapse appeared unlikely when
Belton, tossed in a short turnaround jumper
while being fouled and hit the ensuing freet
hrow to extend the Cards' advantage to 57-43,
their largest, with 13:22 left.
But then Nehls, who looks like Adonis and
shoots like Annie Oakley, accelerated his march
toward his career-high 35 points.
And 6-toot-11 David Mosebar and 6-7 John
Belobraydick, who looked like the Cookie
Monster and moved like Rocky, began rebound
ing fiercely and often.
The result: Arizona changed a 65-55 deficit
with 8:52 left into a 71-67 led with 3:02 to go,
outscoring Stanford 16-2.
Ward fouls
The Cards fought back but still trailed 74-73
when Orlando Ward fouled Wildcat guard John
Smith deliberately with 9 seconds left.
Smith missed the first freethrowand made the
second for a 75-73 Wildcat lead. Marty brought
the ball down the court and hurriedly passed to
Terry Smith, who bobbled the ball and then
missed a driving lay-in.
The rebound was tipped out to Marty, who
grabbed it in front of Stanford's bench. He
gently shot a 35-footer that swished through
perfectly as the buzzer sounded.
Two freethrowsand a lay-in by Belton gave the
Cards a 79-78 lead early in the overtime period.
However, after Russell Brown's jumper gave the
lead back to Arizona, the Cards' shooters went
cold.
To try to regain possession, Stanford was
forced to foul the Wildcats, who made the most
of their opportunities from the foul line by sink
ing 16 of 20 freethrows during the extra session.
