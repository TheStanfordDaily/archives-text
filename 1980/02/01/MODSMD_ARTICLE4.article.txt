The Los Angeles Times
Now Delhi, India — President Jimmy Carter's
specitil representative Clark Clifford yesterday
raised the possibility of American military advisers
being sent to Pakistan to polk e the deployment
and use ot U.S.-supplied arms.
At the same time, Clifford warned the Soviet
Union that it its troops go beyond the borders of
Afghanistan and "head tor the Persian Gulf, then
that means war."
Clifford made his remarks to reporters following
two days of consultations with Indian government
leaders about the Soviet invasion ot Afghanistan.
Carter dispatched Clifford to explain the U.S. re
sponse to the crisis, which includes a proposed
$400 million worth of military and economic aid to
neighboring Pakistan.
India, which has fought three wars in the past
three decades against Pakistan, fears that U.S.
military equipment could be turned against it.
Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi told Clif
ford that U.S. military aid to Pakistan had led to
"adventurism in the past, an Indian government
spokesman said.
The U.S. would "be present" to ensure that
Pakistan used the military aid against possible ag
gression from Soviet-occupied Afghanistan and
not against India, Clifford said.

"We intend to bp present," he said. "We will be
there to ascertain that arms are used in the way
tHoy are intended. I assume there would be milit
ary advisers."
Clifford told reporters that the arms supplied to
Pakistan would be "designed to repel forays ac
ross the Pak-Afghan border." The arms would not
be sophisticated, he said.
Clifford met with Gandhi for 70 minutes yester
day morning and later had a working lunch with
Foreign Minister Narasimha Rao, whom he had
met with Wednesday.
India has suggested that any arms buildup on
the subcontinent would work to escalate rather
than defuse the present crisis.
While Gandhi has saicJ her country is anxious for
a speedy withdrawal of Soviet troops from Af
ghanistan , she has taken a soft line with the Soviets
in the rjelief that only a relaxing ot tensions will
result in their departure.
According to an Indian foreign ministry
spokesman, Gandhi told Clifford that all countries
should act circumspectly to defuse the situation.
"India doesn't condone the input of arms in its
neighborhood," the spokesman explained.
While Clifford declined to discuss details ot the
talks until he had reported to the president. State
Department aides said they were relaxed despite

rne differences between the two nations.
"Gandhi was in good torm and seemed anxious
to establish a good relationship with the U. 5.," he
said. Clifford departed for Washington early to
' day.
Clifford noted that both the U.S. and India
wanted a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and
that the dose Indo-Soviet relationship "might be
useful in all this."
"Our hope is that India may be helpful in per
suading the Soviet Union to get troops out," he
said.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko is
scheduled to visit India later this month.
Clifford outlined the American position in som"
of the strongest language yet.
" They (the Russians) must know that if they head
for the Persian Gulf, then that means war," he
said. "It there is any temptation to go to Pakistan,
then that will also bring grave difficulties."
Clifford said he was aware the American plan to
provide arms for Pakistan was unpopular in India,
yet "the gravity ot the (Soviet) threat was such that
it must be done." He told Gandhi that the supply
of military equipment would be done only within
the context of the present crisis and that the U.S.
had no intention of long-term military involve
ment in the region.
