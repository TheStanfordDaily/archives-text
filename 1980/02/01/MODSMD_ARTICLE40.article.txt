A lethargic Stanford wo
men's basketball team lost to
18th-ranked University of San
Francisco 57-38 Wednesday
night in a game when the most
exciting part of the evening
was a spirited rendition of the
Star Spangled Banner. The
Cards did not match the an
them in spirit, playing inconsis
tently in lowering their record
to 12-10, 4-2 in NorCal confer
ence play.
The Dons opened the game
with a 3-2 zone defense which
forced the off-tempo Cards to
shoot, and miss, from the out
side. At the other end of the
court, however, USF's Kim
Bachman was a dead-eye from
the outside, hitting live buc
kets in leading USF to a 14-4
lead.
With vocal encouragement
from head coach Dotty McCrea,
the Cards' zone defense tight
ened up and Stanford began to
rebound better. The tight de
tense and a more consistent of
fense allowed the Cards to pull
within one at 14-13, but
Bachman's shooting kept the
Dons ahead at the half, 18-15.

In the second half, Stanford
once again started slowly as an
11-2 USF spurt put the
ahead 29-17. Freshman Kim
Kupferer led a rejuvenated
Stanford however, to an 11-2
spurt of their own and the
Cards were down 31-28. At this
point the more experienced
Dons patiently worked their
game to perfection, running
the Cards all over the court. It
was never close.
All-American candidate
Mary Hile led the Dons with 15
points and a board-dominated
23 rebounds. Melody Clark
and Bachman followed with 14
for USF, 6-0 in NorCal play.
Kupferer led a beleaguered
Card team with eight points
and six rebounds, leanne
Ruark, the NorCal Conterence
Player of the Week, was shut
down effectively by the Dons,
scoring four points and grab
bing but two rebounds.
The Dons outrebounded
Stanford 54-36 and allowed the
Cards to shoot only 26 percent
for the game. That helped to
rectify their own dismal shoot
ing of 34 percent.
