# Volleyball tourney may justify great expectations
## 
### Robert Stone 
"This year we are expecting
to do well. Last year — our first
in the CIVA (California Inter
collegiate Volleyball Associa
tion) — we were hoping to do
well," noted head coach Fred
Sturm about the outlook for his
men's volleyball team this year.
This weekend will provide
the coach with a chance to see
just how great his expectations
should be when his squad
journeys to UC-Santa Barbara
tor the Gaucho's Collegiate
Volleyball Tournament. The
24-team contest is slated to
take place all day Friday and
Saturday.
Sturm should get a good as

sessment of how the Cards will
fare in conference play with
nine of the 10 CIVA schools
scheduled to compete:
California, UCLA, UC-Santa
Barbara, Cal Poly-SLO, Long
Beach State, Loyola-
Marymount, Pepperdine and
San Diego State. USC is the
only CIVA team that won't take
part in the tourney.
Last year's inaugural team
posted a 4-16 record that tied
them with California and
Loyola for eighth place in the
standings. In order to qualify
tor the regionals, Stanford
must finish at least fifth, an ef
fort that Sturm has acknow
ledged will require a good start

at the beginning of the season
and consistent play through
out.
As for the group's progress
to date, assistant coach |ohn
Bekins commented, "We're
much better than last year at
this stage," and also noted that
everyone is healthy.
Eight Cardinal players -
seniors Frank Anderson, Rod
Fletcher, )ack Foxworth, Kim
Lum, and John McColl, juniors
Ruben Nieves and Dave Saeta
and sophomore Bob Dean —
are tentatively expected to
make the trip south. At the
time of this writing the starting
six had not been established,

but any combination of players
that takes the floor saw action
last year. In fact, 12 returners
on the 19-man roster started at
least one game last year.
A position analysis of the
team seems to indicate that ev
erything is set for the season.
Vying for the setter spot will be
Dean, Saeta and Nieves, along
with last season's top setter,
sophomore Kip Engen. Who
ever winds up at the starting
position will be responsible for
calling the plays and running
the offense.
The middle blockers, those
players responsible for stifling
the opposition's offense, will

most likely be Lum and Fox
worth. Lum, a third-year star
ter, is noted for intelligent play
and consistency, while Fox
worth is regarded as the
squad's "best pure blocker."
When asked who has been
playing exceptionally well thus
far, Bekins noted, "In vol
leyball there's not one person
who can put you over the
hump," but added that both
Lum and Foxworth have been
playing especially well.
As for the power hitters, the
players who are involved in
much ot the scoring, Fletcher is
being converted from middle
blocker and will probably see a
good deal of action this sea

son. Anderson and McColl will
also line up as hitters this year,
as will sophomore Corey
Brown.
The coaches pointed out that
it is difficult to tell how the
other conference teams match
up against Stanford, but sing
led out UCLA, USC, San Diego
State and possibly UC-Santa
Barbara as the teams to beat
this season.
"It's going to be a good
chance to take a look at the
players, to see what they'll be
able to do," remarked Bekins
of the upcoming match. With
the number of teams compet
ing, it should give everyone an
idea of what to expect this year.
