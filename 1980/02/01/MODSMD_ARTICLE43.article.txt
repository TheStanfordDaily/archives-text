As part ot his opening lec
tures on civil liberties this quar
ter, political science prolessor
David Danelski spoke ot "the
myth ot the Court," that aura ot
mystery and curiosity which
surrounds the nine justices ot
the Supreme Court ot the Un
ited States. It is one of the
ways, Danelski said, that the
Court derives its power.

The justices . . . are
still people . . . they
still rely on their gut
feelings. . .

The high ceilings, the marble
columns, the justices dressed
in their priestly robes sitting
above the rest ot the people in
the building. The strict rules ot
demeanor and, above all, the
secrecy surrounding delibera
tions. These metaphors tor au
thority all add to that subcon
scious teeling ot awe we sense
when we speak ot the Court.
They make us teel as it their

decisions are prescribed by
some divine guidance,
Danelski said.
The key word in all ot this is,
ot course, "myth." The justices
ot the Supreme Court, though
extraordinary in many ways,
are still people. And though
they try to think and act objec
tively, they still rely on their gut
teelings, their emotions.
This is difficult tor us to be
lieve at times. But Bob Wood
ward and Scott Armstrong give
us some marvelous insights
into the workings ot the Court
in their highly touted book The
Brethren published last month
by Simon and Schuster.
The work attempts to convey
the essence ot the inner work
ings ot the Court through the
tirst eight years ot Chiet justice
Warren Burger, 1969 to 197b.
Each chapter presents a set ot
stories behind the key deci
sions and personalities ot each
term ot the Court.
The book has its weak
points, but it is unique in its
timeliness. The decisions we
read about are recent enough
that any person who has lived
above ground during the past
decade can remember them.
And the tact that the book
was written lor the average
person is also unique. Previ
ously, it seems, most treatises
on the Court concerned
spec ilic justices and were writ

ten long atter their deathi in the
technically pertect, but all-to
otten dry style that charac
terizes more scholarly reviews.
While some may view this as
sloppy and use this "sloppi
ness" to discount the value ot
the work, I regard this feature
as a true plus.
hew books have ever hit the
stands with so much advance
publicity. Excerpted in local

newspapers throughout the
nation, Bay Area readers
caught a glimpse ot the ettort
in an eight-part syndicated
series published in the Son
Inse Mercury. Newsweek put
the book on its cover. Phil
Donahue welcomed the au
thors to his television show.
Simon and Schuster, it was re
ported, paid them hundreds ot
thousands ot dollars in ad
vance to prepare the book.

But despite all the PR, when
the nation tinally got hold ot
The Brethren, the response
was less than enthusiastic.
Don't worry, Simon and Schus
ter has sold plenty of copies.
But reviewers bemoaned the
style and the nation's attorneys
expressed outrage at the "at
tack" on the nation's highest
court.
Perhaps it's me. Despite the

critics, I liked the book. I admit
to being anything but a Warren
Burger tan, so I didn't really
mind the book's characteriza
tion ot him as a power hungry,
petty man, as a legal scholar ot
the lowest order.
It didn't shock me to think
that Supreme Court clerks
would "stoop so low as to
speak openly with a reporter"
about their employers. And I
didn't think it a cop-out when

those same clerks asked not to
be identified. Atter all that is
the way some ot the most im
portant journalistic works in
history have been produced.
The work is tar Irom pertect.
The prose is less than lucid in
parts. There are some conclu
sions drawn which can only be
described as conjecture, (here
are portions ot the book which
elevate Earl Warren to an al
most deitic level. Other por
tions unfairly attack our pre
sent chief justice without even
stating his case (though the au
thors indicate that Burger re
fused to assist them in any way,
so it may have been difficult to
balance the coverage). And
worst ot all, say some c ritics,
no comments are directly attri
buted.
But this is an important
book, and everyone should
read it. All the shortcomings
notwithstanding, the work is
entertaining and educational.
The vignettes presented illus
trate the tact society tends to
torget: these are not gods;
the-.e are people. They are fal
lible (Lord, don't we it).

They (God help us) act politi
cally and emotionally in their
judgments. At times, their per
sonalities clash.
OK, sure, I must agree that
quoting Justice William Bren
nan as calling Burger a
"dummy" won't do anybody
much good. We might
chuckle, but it doesn't add any
thing. Neither about Burger
thrown in here and there. But
these are trivial.
The opening page ol the
book is a quote by Warren
Burger, then a Circuit Court
|udge. It states: "A court which
is tinal and unreviewable
needs more careful scrutiny
than any other. ... In a coun
try like ours, no public institu
tion, or the people who oper
ate it, can tie above public de

bate."
On at least this one issue,
Burger is correct. But it is dit
ticult to scrutinize without that
basic tool ot debate — know
ledge. While 77ie Brethren is no
substitute lor the stricter (and
drier), more scholarly, post
mortem works which will be
written about Warren Burger
and his years on the Court, it
gives us an extremely impor
tant perspective. And it is
much more timely.
More than that, I would be
willing to bet that when those
scholarly works tinally do get
written, they show that
Woodward and Armstrong we
ren't too tar ott the mark with
their conclusions.
