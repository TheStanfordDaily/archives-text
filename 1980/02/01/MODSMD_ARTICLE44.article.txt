## Contraception-why no better way? 
### 
The Politics of Contraception
Carl Djerassi
W. W. Norton and Company
282 pp. $10.95
At one lime or another,
we've all read about, heard ab
out, seen, or used contracep
tives (or, perhaps, wished we'd
used them). But the topic itsell
is not as simple and c ompact as
the package o! pills which the
doctor just prescribed, nor is it
as easily understood as the di
rections (or lac k thereof) on a
box ol condoms.
As Professor Carl Djerassi
says in the opening statements
ol his book, The Politics ol
Contraception,". . .birth con
trol illustrates the dilemma that
modern science and technol
ogy have created — tear ol new
developments accompanied
by the demand lor even newer
and better' methods."
The book is much more than
a standard guide to the effec

tiveness and safety ol con
traceptive practices; while this
aspect is not overlooked, the
book concentrates on the so
cial, cultural and political at
titudes surrounding the topic,
what Djerassi terms the
"sottware."
A heavy emphasis is placed
upon explaining the bureauc
ratic processes surrounding
the creation ol new drugs,
throughout the book, Djerassi
is highly critical of the strin
gent regulations placed upon
the drug industry and the
reader may be led to conclude
that our government is stand
ing in the way ol progress
when it comes to new forms ol
contraception. Djerassi esti
mated that, ideally, any new
development in contraceptive
technology would lake 10.5 to
17.5 years, given present test
ing requirements.
The author is by no means a

casual observer in the lield ol
contraceptives; Djerassi was
the leader ol the team which
synthesized the lirst oral con
traceptive. One chapter of the
book explains the pill's incep
tion, while another discusses
the newly discovered problem
with what, at one time, was
considered the ideal con
traceptive.
On this topic, the search lor
the ideal contraceptive,
Djerassi also expressed his
views ol what lies ahead in this
area — "Birth control a la
1984." His ideas are quite var
ied, including methods to be
used by men, women and en
lire populations. Male pills, re
versible vasec tonnes, and birth
control injections are pre
dicted for the future, 112 lowever,
the lather of the pill claims that
the young woman of today
"will be past menopause be
fore she can depend on her

male partner to use his pill,"
or, for that matter, before a
safer pill will be made available
to her.
Perhaps the Stanford profes
sor is too critical ol our present
system. But, after one reads his
chapter on birth control in
China, it may seem that the Un
ited States is lagging behind in
the race (or crawl) to tind a bet
ter and safer way to control fer
tility.
The Politics ot Contraception
may at times seem a little too
complicated tor the average
reader. However, the limited
amount of chemistry pre
sented should not dissuade
one, because the issues pre
sented should be understood
by every nursery school
teacher, businessman, house
wife and teenager. Birth con
trol is a complicated matter,
encompassing much more
than how effective or sate any

given method is; you've heard
ail ot thai before. What the
book does, quite candidly, is to
answer the question: "Why
isn't there a better way?"

lire populations. Male pills, re
versible vasec tonnes, and birth
control injections are pre
dicted for the future, 112 lowever,
the lather of the pill claims that
the young woman of today
"will be past menopause be

male partner to use his pill,"
or, for that matter, before a
safer pill will be made available
to her.
Perhaps the Stanford profes
sor is too critical ol our present
system. But, after one reads his
chapter on birth control in
China, it may seem that the Un
ited States is lagging behind in
the race (or crawl) to tind a bet
ter and safer way to control fer

The Politics ot Contraception
may at times seem a little too
complicated tor the average
reader. However, the limited
amount of chemistry pre
sented should not dissuade
one, because the issues pre
sented should be understood
by every nursery school
teacher, businessman, house
wife and teenager. Birth con
trol is a complicated matter,
encompassing much more
than how effective or sate any

given method is; you've heard
ail ot thai before. What the
book does, quite candidly, is to
answer the question: "Why
isn't there a better way?"
