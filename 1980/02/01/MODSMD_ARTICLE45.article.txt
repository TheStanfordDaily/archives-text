Critics ol poetry sometimes
said that the poem should go
"beyond the image," hsiang

which the artist responded to
I tensions between Con
tucianism and Taoism — and,
in the 20th century, between
tradition and Westernism and,
later, Communism — between
J craftsmanship and spon
taneity, orthodoxy and indi
vidualism, and between art as
r representation and art as ex
; is what Michael Sulli
van/explores in this eloquent,
lucid text.
. To my knowledge, it is the
■only work outside ol China
Awhich takes an exclusive sur
vey ol the Chinese landscape
painting trom its earliest stages
ot development to the present.
| Ot the other, similar texts,
;Sherman Lee's Chinese Land
scape Painting terminates in
• the 18th century, asserting that
* "by 1800 landscape and all
jpainting has run dry in theme,
'.technique and mood.

Arthur Waley's classic Intro
duction to the Study ol
Chinese Painting (1921), James
Cahill's excellent Chinese
Painting (I%U), notable lor its
plates as well as tor its text, and
Osvald Siren's encyclopedic,
7-volume Chinese Painting <S.
Leading Masters (1958) are all
general and do not venture
past the 19th century.

few people are more qual
itied to write a historv ot this
nature than Dr. Sullivan, who is
a Fellow at St. Catherine's Col
lege, Oxtord, and holder of the
Christensen Chair in Oriental
Art here, fie is one ot the
toremost Chinese art scholars
in the world, and his Arts ol
China is considered to be the
best introduction to Chinese
art.

Symbols ol Eternity: The Art
ot Landscape Painting in
China, is written lor the person
with no background in
Chinese art. It is a revised and
expanded version ot the Slade
Lectures he delivered at Ox
lord University in 1974 and, in
deed, reading the book is as
effortless and informative as at
tending a slide lecture.
Sullivan's writing style —
lucid, probing and as flowing
as a calligraphic line — is simi
lar to that ot Arthur Waley.
Using the personal "we" —
as does Waley — he takes us by
the hand, traces the rhythmical
lines in the landscape to the
volutes on painted pottery in
the late stone age, leads us
through the Han Dynasty, in
which landscape was used sol
ely as background,and into the
Six Dynasties where landscape
painting, due to the influence
of Taoism and Buddhism, came
into its own as valid subject
material.
We explore technique in the
Tang and examine the search
tor- and abandonment ot- ab
solute truth to nature in the
Sung. We look at the ku fu (re
storing of the past) ot the Yuan,
the growth of painting as a
scholarly activity in the Ming,
the orthodoxy and stagnation
of the Ch'ing, and the influ
ence of Western culture and
Communism in the 20th cen
tury.
Sullivan makes the material
more lively and immediate by
quoting various painters and
relating anecdotes about
them.
Pictures illustrating the text
are placed in proximity to the
passages describing them.
The one unfortunate aspect
ot the book is its lack of good
color reproductions. The
book's tew color plates pale
next to those in Cahill's book.
The absence, however, ot
these expensive color plates
makes this book more aftorda
ble.
Symbols of Fternity is an en
lightening account not only ot
landscape painting but ot
Chinese history, culture and
philosophy.

Arthur Waley's classic Intro
duction to the Study ol
Chinese Painting (1921), James
Cahill's excellent Chinese
Painting (I%U), notable lor its
plates as well as tor its text, and
Osvald Siren's encyclopedic,
7-volume Chinese Painting <S.
Leading Masters (1958) are all
general and do not venture
past the 19th century.

few people are more qual
itied to write a historv ot this
nature than Dr. Sullivan, who is
a Fellow at St. Catherine's Col
lege, Oxtord, and holder of the
Christensen Chair in Oriental
Art here, fie is one ot the
toremost Chinese art scholars
in the world, and his Arts ol
China is considered to be the
best introduction to Chinese
art.

Symbols ol Eternity: The Art
ot Landscape Painting in
China, is written lor the person
with no background in
Chinese art. It is a revised and
expanded version ot the Slade
Lectures he delivered at Ox
lord University in 1974 and, in
deed, reading the book is as
effortless and informative as at
tending a slide lecture.
Sullivan's writing style —
lucid, probing and as flowing
as a calligraphic line — is simi
lar to that ot Arthur Waley.
Using the personal "we" —
as does Waley — he takes us by
the hand, traces the rhythmical
lines in the landscape to the
volutes on painted pottery in
the late stone age, leads us
through the Han Dynasty, in
which landscape was used sol
ely as background,and into the
Six Dynasties where landscape
painting, due to the influence
of Taoism and Buddhism, came
into its own as valid subject
material.
We explore technique in the
Tang and examine the search
tor- and abandonment ot- ab
solute truth to nature in the
Sung. We look at the ku fu (re
storing of the past) ot the Yuan,
the growth of painting as a
scholarly activity in the Ming,
the orthodoxy and stagnation
of the Ch'ing, and the influ
ence of Western culture and
Communism in the 20th cen
tury.
Sullivan makes the material
more lively and immediate by
quoting various painters and
relating anecdotes about
them.
Pictures illustrating the text
are placed in proximity to the
passages describing them.
The one unfortunate aspect
ot the book is its lack of good
color reproductions. The
book's tew color plates pale
next to those in Cahill's book.
The absence, however, ot
these expensive color plates
makes this book more aftorda
ble.
Symbols of Fternity is an en
lightening account not only ot
landscape painting but ot
Chinese history, culture and
philosophy.
