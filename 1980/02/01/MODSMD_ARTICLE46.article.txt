The tirst time homicide detective (iabriel
Wager heard the name Covino he was in the
I rontier Bar& Grill. He heard it from Tony O,
the aging ex-jete (chiet) ot the defunct
Chicano neighborhood in which Wager had
grown up. Tony-O said that he'd heard that a
Frank Covino had been involved in the gang
style slaying ot Marco Scorvelli nine months
before. The next day the same Frank Covino
turned up dead. Wager was assigned to the
case.
Rex Burns' Angle ol Attack is a book about
cops. More particularly, it is a book about
Denver cops and the people they deal with,
the racially diverse low-life ot a developing
western city. The book describes a world
which is foreign to most ot us, a world of
informers and drunks, Mafiosi and politically
preoccupied police officials. It tries to make
this world real for those ot us who have never
known it, and it succeeds.
It is the little people who make Angle of
Attack work, the minor characters who barely
affect the plot, the dozens ot personalities
encountered in a routine homicide investiga
tion. They are vivid and persuasively natural.
They make the reader believe in the story.
With this accomplished everything else falls
into place. The mystery of Frank Covino's
death becomes important. The fate ot the
people involved becomes a matter of con
cern. The investigation of that murder be
comes something worth reading about.
The book is realistic, but much more im
portant lor those of us who may never live in
Denver or meet a Denver cop, its realism is
convincing. Burns has created his own De
nver, a full-blooded, believable city; if it is
anything like the real Denver, all the better.
Angle of Attack is well-written, a rare qual
ity among police novels. The style is terse,

almost clipped, the sort ol prose sometimes
associated with Dashiell Hammed. Short de
clarative sentence's are interspersed with
pithy but natural-sounding dialogue. Fhe
characters and situations come across
quickly and clearly. The reader is not forced
to deal with extended meditations or ornate
descriptions. Straightforward writing makes
the book easy to read.
Angle of Attack is a good police novel. II is
not a literary masterpiece. Naturally it sutlers
from many ot the ailments generally as
sociated with police novels.
While the minor characters seem lively
and convincing, the main characters often
seem shallow. Detective Wager, the hero,
comes across as a lonely Hispanic superman,
too tough to live. His Anglo partner is the
bleeding-heart liberal to shame all
bleeding-heart liberals. Their c rusty superior
at homicide smokes cigars and is called the
bulldog (he didn't go to Yale).
The plot, or at least the ending, also leaves
something to be desired. As we reach the
finish,, the murder investigation which has
been generating suspense all along slowly
peters out. The book culminates in an in
completely understood moral dilemma in
which Wager decides to go outside the law.
His partner gets angry at him lor "making the
wrong move."
We never learn n making the wrong move
pays oil or not. Everything gets fuzzy. Wager •
seems to know something the reader doesn't
know. Maybe this is the way it is in "real life.''
Maybe this is where art and "real Ii 1e" should
part company. At any rate, the ending is not
very satislying.
II you like police stories and you're in the
market for some recreational reading, Angle
ot Attack is worth the trouble. It will not
change your life. It will not make you want to
move to Denver. Bui it will give you hours of
good reading.
