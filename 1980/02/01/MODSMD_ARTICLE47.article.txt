The Importance of Being Earnest
* * ★
Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.
Director Anthony Asquith
makes no attempt to cover up the
theatrical origins of the Oscar
Wilde play; rather, he chooses to
underline them with clever, it
anachronistic, end-papers that
show the curtain being pulled up
and let down on this filmed pro
duction.
TIOBE boasts some stunning
performances. Michael Redgrave
plays )ack, Michael Dennis plays
Algernon, with theother roles lil
ted by the likes of Joan Green
wood, who makes a delightful
purring Gwendolyn and Mar
garet Rutherford as a suitably
contused and contusing Miss
Prism.

Kramer vj. Kramer* ★ * 1
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Ben
ton's movie is for the most part an
astonishing one. With the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named lustin Henry as the
movie's heart, Benton constructs
a moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like charat ter study of a
divorced man's struggle to love
and care lor his son land vice
versa).
But there's gnawing (lor me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the
film. Alter all the care and hon
esty Benton's invested through
out, why does he have to load the
dice against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead ot taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little 100 neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slen
der movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. )ane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composi
tion is the work ol cinematog
rapher Neslor Almendros.

The Black Hole ¥
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion pic
ture space race with a brilliant
plunge into the world of outer
space special effects, and falls flat
on its face. The effects are fun in
the beginning but the wires soon
become obnoxiously visible and
people start breathing in space.
The best acting is done by a tin
can named V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that
looks like a cross between Star
Wars' R2-D2 and a beer keg. The
movie plays like Captain Nemo in
space and the religious over
tones probably have Dante spin
ning in his grave.

2001: A Space Odyssey nit *itit
Sunday, Mem Aud. 9 p.m.
Stankey Kubrick's classic lilm
may somehow seem "primitive"
by current sci-fi movie standards,
but this movie still transcends
any genre labels. Kubrick'i
domination ol the medium in this
overwhelmingly visual master
work is so obvious that you may
overlook the importance ot Ar
thur C. Clarke's original idea.
Clarke's conception perfectly fits
the grandeur of Kubrick's style
here, and the results are un
forgettable.
—R.L.
Yojimho it it it *
Tuesday-Wednesday, New Varsity
Pauline Kael called Yojimho
the first great "shaggy man
movie." The shaggy man in ques
tion is Toshiro Miiune, playing a
samurai warrior who comes into
a town ready to be hired by who
ever will pay him the most. It's a
twist on the western, where the
hired gun lights 'or the good
side; here both sides are bad,
and the samurai is happy to assist
them in wiping each other out.
The pace is set by the movie's lirst
scene, where a dog comes trot
ting out carrying not a hone but a
human hand. The very great
Akira Kurosawa directed.
-J.M.
The Great Dictator * * *
Thursday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
Chaplin's satire ot Hitler is
more like an attack, especially in
the closing sequences. Hitler is a
buffoon here, and Mussolini (ol
course) gets even worse treat
ment. Many truly great scenes,
including one where Chaplin as
Hitler wistfully contemplates a
balloon model ol the world,
dreaming of conquest. Chaplin's
too-long speechifying about
peace and love in the closing
moments almost kills the movie;
it's almost as il Chaplin doesn't
realize that everything the movit
has already done is worth lar
more than anything a five-minute
speech could ofter.
—R.L.
le Balon Rouge (The Red Balloonl
it if it *
Saturday, New Varsity
Albert I amorisse wrote arid di
rected this appealing little movie
about a friendless boy who finds
company with a peculiarly ami
able red balloon. You probably
saw this 36-minute tilm in the
third grade, but this children's
fantasy retains its charms for
adults as well. Le Balon Rouge
makes fine use ol its Parisian lo
cations and its music.

Giant * * *
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
At this stage in his career, di
rector George Stevens (S/iane,
Gunga Dm) was obsessed with

making big, slow-moving epics,
regardless ol the subject. On at
least one level, this movie is sup
posed to be "about Texas," but
of the main characters, only
lames Dean rises to larger than
lit'e status. Elizabeth Taylor is in
termittently good, and Rock
Hudson is completely undone by
the sheer size ol the film. Dean's
perlormanc e was his last, not his
best, but he dominates Giant,
playing a seemingly worthless kid
who becomes one of the most
powerful men in Texas.
—R.L.

Electric Horseman it it *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Almost constructed as the vis
ual equivalent of a Willie Nelson
song. The fact that Nelson's one
of the co-stars only enhances the
warm, nearly uneventful, yet
somehow quietly thoughtful feel
ing of this Robert Redford-|ane
Fonda star vehicle. Faded rodeo
slar Redford advertises breakfast
cereal lor a dehumanizing con
glomerate; he rebels by stealing
the corporation s mistreated
symbol — a $12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford tall in
love. The performances, espe
cially Redtord's, are fine, Sydney
Pollack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely ami
able movie, and there's nothing
much wrong with that.
—R.L.

19 41 * # *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion tor Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as a loving
expression of visual comedy,
1941 is the strongest effort in
years. Like a Stennelt or lloyd
two-reeler, 1941 is ail up front;
bodies fly all-too-trequently and
the comedy is generally not ol
the lasting variety. That may par
tially explain the very harsh reac-

tion of most c ritics to this movie;
also, such completely physical,
frenzied comedic action may be
horribly out ot place now.
Despite all that, I like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working today better
than |ohn Belushi, and Dan Ayk
royd, Treat Williams, Toshiro
Mitune and Slim Pickens are all
line here. But Robert Stack, as
General "Vinegar |oe" Stilwell
quietly steals the show as he tear
fully watches Disney's Dumbo as
a full-scale riot goes on outside
the theater.
—R.L.
Tiddler on the Roof * * #
Friday, New Varsity
Norman lewison, who in 1971
was in much better torm than he
is now, directed this vibrant
movie musical, lewison doesn't
attempt to temper the theatrical
ity inherent in the material, yft
the movie doesn't get stagey —
lewison keeps things flowing
smoothly. As Tevye, the main
character, Topol may not be as
brilliant as /ero Mostel was in the

stage version but he still fills the
mighty role with a supreme zest
and vitality.
—R.L.
Animal House * * * *
Park, Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion ot white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of vari
ous forms of trat life in 62 works;
Animal House's approach tifs its
subject matter very well. .
As always, |ohn Belushi gives

an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals" in the "worst
trat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuft.
|ohn Landis directs as if
there's no speed but fast and no
volume but loud, and while that
doesn't hurt him too much here
(although, because of this ten
dency, Animal House has a de
cidedly limited emotional range),
I wonder if Landis can do any
thing else but movies like this.
Actually I wouldn't mind more
movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?
—R.L.
Going in Style it it it
Palo Alio Square
A very touching little movie.
It's been criticized for its slow
pacing and lack of ribald comedy,
but that's largely unjustified.
George Burns, Art Carney and
Lee Strasberg are a compelling
trio to watch, and in his feature
movie debut, 28-year-old
writer-director Martin Brest
makes up for his lack of plot ideas

with a compassionate and gentle
touch. Much of the movie's com
edy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie
is moody, emotionally wrench
ing. Well worth seeing, it only to
watch actors who don't need to
trample you to be effective.
—R.L.
The lerk ♦ *
Old Mill
I love Steve Martin, but this is
more an attempt to cash in on his
present status than an effort to
face tougher creative challenges.
Steve's born a "poor black
child," and several of the skits in
this rags to riches to rags story
revel so wildly in their dumbness
that they simply must be in
spired, but this just isn't the
movie that will make Martin a
memorable movie comedian.
He's got the unique moves and
he perhaps has got the mind, but
he doesn't yet have the material
— The lerk's more a stringing to
gether of sketches than a movie.
Maybe next time, okay?
—R.L.
Citisen Aane » * * *
Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
They call Kane the greatest
movie ever made, but don't let
that scare you away from seeing
it. It's a magnificent film that's
also a hell of a lot of tun to watch.
Orson Welles, who directs, star
red and co-wrote, called movies
the greatest electric train set a
boy ever had, and Kane is un
fused with a sense ot pure joy in
exploiting the capabilities ot the
medium. 1 radition has it that Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, after lind
ing out how similar the life of
Charles Foster Kane was to his
own, had the movie suppressed;
the truth may be that audiences
ot the time were simply unpre
pared for the movie's elliptical
narrative stiucture and
precedent-breaking technique.
Also starring Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead and Everett
Sloane. October, a Sergei Eisens

half of Monday's double bill.

Apocalypse Now * * * *
Old Mill
Century 24, San lose
An amazing work ot maci
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam,
combining frightening energy
and intensity with humor, sensu
ality and overwhelming evil. It's a
journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fas
cinate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I

think, the best American movie
ot the just-ended decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions it con
fronts you with |ustity the seem
ing craziness ot this "impossi
ble," almost nihilistic , vision ot
mankind.

Aquarius, Palo Alto
The sexist ad campaign has
misled many people about this
movie; ii you re looking lor a
semi-pornographic turn-on, 10
may not be right for you. Writer
director Blake Edwards' values
are, tor lack ot a better word,
straight, and this comedy
male mid-lite crisis probably
won't please those who enjoy
watching temales get conquered.
As an over-40 songwriter, Dudley
Moore is an ingratiating hum
bler, and Edwards gives the rest
ot the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except lor Bo
Derek, that is. This poster-star
just may have found her "niche"
as the vacuous "10" the ''tie re
fers to.
—R.L.
The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion ot Star is Horn, except that
this one is clothed with a 1969
setting and centered on a c harac
ter vaguely based on |anis loplin.
But the movie only makes three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
And the music is more aptly de
scribed as trenetic show tunes
with bass and drums than as |anis
loplin s form of blues and rock.'
The performances at times man
age to obscure some ot the
movie's lack ot authenticity, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bales,
Midler comes oil much better,
but it's too little too late.
—R.L.
Star Trek ♦ *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions ol
greed — Paramount Pictures. A
mechanical creation of man
comes back to haunt him as the'
darling creature's quest for
knowledge leads it to finally
search lor its creator. Despite the
seeming epic grandeur of its plot,
the movie really has no climax,
and its ending — where one ol
the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilization by gleefully ag
reeing to some cosmic sex — is
unintentionally hilarious.
Shatner, Nimoy and the rest were
much better on TV; on the 70mm
screen they're almost unbelieva
bly wooden.

Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.
Director Anthony Asquith
makes no attempt to cover up the
theatrical origins of the Oscar
Wilde play; rather, he chooses to
underline them with clever, it
anachronistic, end-papers that
show the curtain being pulled up
and let down on this filmed pro
duction.
TIOBE boasts some stunning
performances. Michael Redgrave
plays )ack, Michael Dennis plays
Algernon, with theother roles lil

Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Ben
ton's movie is for the most part an
astonishing one. With the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named lustin Henry as the
movie's heart, Benton constructs
a moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like charat ter study of a
divorced man's struggle to love
and care lor his son land vice
versa).
But there's gnawing (lor me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the
film. Alter all the care and hon
esty Benton's invested through
out, why does he have to load the
dice against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead ot taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little 100 neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slen

movie of surprising depth and
complexity. )ane Alexander co

Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion pic
ture space race with a brilliant
plunge into the world of outer
space special effects, and falls flat
on its face. The effects are fun in
the beginning but the wires soon
become obnoxiously visible and
people start breathing in space.
The best acting is done by a tin
can named V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that
looks like a cross between Star

Stankey Kubrick's classic lilm

by current sci-fi movie standards,
but this movie still transcends
any genre labels. Kubrick'i
domination ol the medium in this
overwhelmingly visual master

Tuesday-Wednesday, New Varsity
Pauline Kael called Yojimho
the first great "shaggy man
movie." The shaggy man in ques
tion is Toshiro Miiune, playing a
samurai warrior who comes into
a town ready to be hired by who
ever will pay him the most. It's a
twist on the western, where the
hired gun lights 'or the good
side; here both sides are bad,
and the samurai is happy to assist
them in wiping each other out.
The pace is set by the movie's lirst
scene, where a dog comes trot
ting out carrying not a hone but a
human hand. The very great
Akira Kurosawa directed.

Thursday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
Chaplin's satire ot Hitler is
more like an attack, especially in
the closing sequences. Hitler is a
buffoon here, and Mussolini (ol

ment. Many truly great scenes,
including one where Chaplin as
Hitler wistfully contemplates a
balloon model ol the world,
dreaming of conquest. Chaplin's
too-long speechifying about
peace and love in the closing
moments almost kills the movie;
it's almost as il Chaplin doesn't
realize that everything the movit

At this stage in his career, di

Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Almost constructed as the vis

warm, nearly uneventful, yet
somehow quietly thoughtful feel
ing of this Robert Redford-|ane
Fonda star vehicle. Faded rodeo
slar Redford advertises breakfast

glomerate; he rebels by stealing
the corporation s mistreated
symbol — a $12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford tall in
love. The performances, espe
cially Redtord's, are fine, Sydney
Pollack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the

charm and good-naturedness

19 41 * # *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion tor Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as a loving
expression of visual comedy,
1941 is the strongest effort in
years. Like a Stennelt or lloyd
two-reeler, 1941 is ail up front;
bodies fly all-too-trequently and
the comedy is generally not ol
the lasting variety. That may par
tially explain the very harsh reac-

tion of most c ritics to this movie;
also, such completely physical,
frenzied comedic action may be
horribly out ot place now.
Despite all that, I like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working today better
than |ohn Belushi, and Dan Ayk
royd, Treat Williams, Toshiro
Mitune and Slim Pickens are all

Animal House * * * *

A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica

because of this, this story of vari
ous forms of trat life in 62 works;
Animal House's approach tifs its
subject matter very well. .
As always, |ohn Belushi gives

an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals" in the "worst
trat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuft.
|ohn Landis directs as if
there's no speed but fast and no
volume but loud, and while that
doesn't hurt him too much here
(although, because of this ten
dency, Animal House has a de
cidedly limited emotional range),
I wonder if Landis can do any
thing else but movies like this.
Actually I wouldn't mind more
movies like this one; a little

George Burns, Art Carney and
Lee Strasberg are a compelling
trio to watch, and in his feature
movie debut, 28-year-old
writer-director Martin Brest
makes up for his lack of plot ideas

with a compassionate and gentle
touch. Much of the movie's com
edy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie
is moody, emotionally wrench
ing. Well worth seeing, it only to
watch actors who don't need to
trample you to be effective.

Steve's born a "poor black

revel so wildly in their dumbness
that they simply must be in
spired, but this just isn't the
movie that will make Martin a
memorable movie comedian.
He's got the unique moves and

Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by

stunning images of Vietnam,
combining frightening energy
and intensity with humor, sensu

It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie but why
bother. Really just another ver

this one is clothed with a 1969

ter vaguely based on |anis loplin.
But the movie only makes three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
And the music is more aptly de
scribed as trenetic show tunes
with bass and drums than as |anis

The performances at times man
age to obscure some ot the
movie's lack ot authenticity, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi

lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ

Midler comes oil much better,

Director Anthony Asquith
makes no attempt to cover up the
theatrical origins of the Oscar
Wilde play; rather, he chooses to
underline them with clever, it
anachronistic, end-papers that
show the curtain being pulled up

TIOBE boasts some stunning

Writer-director Robert Ben

astonishing one. With the in

movie's heart, Benton constructs
a moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like charat ter study of a

But there's gnawing (lor me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the
film. Alter all the care and hon
esty Benton's invested through
out, why does he have to load the
dice against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead ot taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little 100 neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor

Pauline Kael called Yojimho
the first great "shaggy man

samurai warrior who comes into
a town ready to be hired by who
ever will pay him the most. It's a
twist on the western, where the
hired gun lights 'or the good

and the samurai is happy to assist
them in wiping each other out.
The pace is set by the movie's lirst

Chaplin's satire ot Hitler is

including one where Chaplin as
Hitler wistfully contemplates a

dreaming of conquest. Chaplin's
too-long speechifying about

19 41 * # *

Although it's a decided regres
sion tor Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as a loving
expression of visual comedy,
1941 is the strongest effort in
years. Like a Stennelt or lloyd
two-reeler, 1941 is ail up front;
bodies fly all-too-trequently and
the comedy is generally not ol
the lasting variety. That may par
tially explain the very harsh reac-

tion of most c ritics to this movie;
also, such completely physical,
frenzied comedic action may be
horribly out ot place now.
Despite all that, I like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working today better
than |ohn Belushi, and Dan Ayk
royd, Treat Williams, Toshiro
Mitune and Slim Pickens are all

Animal House's approach tifs its

As always, |ohn Belushi gives

an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals" in the "worst

sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuft.
|ohn Landis directs as if
there's no speed but fast and no
volume but loud, and while that
doesn't hurt him too much here
(although, because of this ten
dency, Animal House has a de

with a compassionate and gentle
touch. Much of the movie's com
edy is contained in the opening

It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion ot Star is Horn, except that
this one is clothed with a 1969
setting and centered on a c harac
ter vaguely based on |anis loplin.
But the movie only makes three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
And the music is more aptly de
scribed as trenetic show tunes
with bass and drums than as |anis
loplin s form of blues and rock.'
The performances at times man
age to obscure some ot the
movie's lack ot authenticity, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bales,
Midler comes oil much better,
but it's too little too late.

Director Anthony Asquith

Writer-director Robert Ben

astonishing one. With the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin

frighteningly correct instincts
named lustin Henry as the
movie's heart, Benton constructs
a moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like charat ter study of a
divorced man's struggle to love

But there's gnawing (lor me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the
film. Alter all the care and hon
esty Benton's invested through
out, why does he have to load the
dice against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead ot taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little 100 neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slen

Pauline Kael called Yojimho
the first great "shaggy man

samurai warrior who comes into

ever will pay him the most. It's a
twist on the western, where the
hired gun lights 'or the good

and the samurai is happy to assist

The pace is set by the movie's lirst

Chaplin's satire ot Hitler is

including one where Chaplin as
Hitler wistfully contemplates a

dreaming of conquest. Chaplin's
too-long speechifying about

Although it's a decided regres
sion tor Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as a loving
expression of visual comedy,
1941 is the strongest effort in
years. Like a Stennelt or lloyd
two-reeler, 1941 is ail up front;
bodies fly all-too-trequently and
the comedy is generally not ol
the lasting variety. That may par
tially explain the very harsh reac-

tion of most c ritics to this movie;
also, such completely physical,
frenzied comedic action may be
horribly out ot place now.
Despite all that, I like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working today better
than |ohn Belushi, and Dan Ayk
royd, Treat Williams, Toshiro
Mitune and Slim Pickens are all

Animal House's approach tifs its

As always, |ohn Belushi gives

an inspired performance as one

sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuft.
|ohn Landis directs as if
there's no speed but fast and no

doesn't hurt him too much here
(although, because of this ten

It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie but why
bother. Really just another ver
sion ot Star is Horn, except that
this one is clothed with a 1969
setting and centered on a c harac
ter vaguely based on |anis loplin.
But the movie only makes three
references to '69, and without
those you'd probably just assume
the movie was set in the present.
And the music is more aptly de
scribed as trenetic show tunes
with bass and drums than as |anis
loplin s form of blues and rock.'
The performances at times man
age to obscure some ot the
movie's lack ot authenticity, but
the much-ballyhooed Bette Mi
dler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than
convincing in the concert sequ
ences. When teamed with either
Frederic Forrest or Alan Bales,
Midler comes oil much better,
but it's too little too late.

The Importance of Being Earnest

Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.
Director Anthony Asquith
makes no attempt to cover up the
theatrical origins of the Oscar
Wilde play; rather, he chooses to
underline them with clever, it
anachronistic, end-papers that
show the curtain being pulled up
and let down on this filmed pro
duction.
TIOBE boasts some stunning
performances. Michael Redgrave
plays )ack, Michael Dennis plays
Algernon, with theother roles lil
ted by the likes of Joan Green
wood, who makes a delightful
purring Gwendolyn and Mar
garet Rutherford as a suitably
contused and contusing Miss
Prism.

Kramer vj. Kramer* ★ * 1
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Ben
ton's movie is for the most part an
astonishing one. With the in
terplay between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named lustin Henry as the
movie's heart, Benton constructs
a moving, compassionate, almost
Truffaut-like charat ter study of a
divorced man's struggle to love
and care lor his son land vice
versa).
But there's gnawing (lor me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the
film. Alter all the care and hon
esty Benton's invested through
out, why does he have to load the
dice against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems
to have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead ot taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is
a little 100 neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Vet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slen
der movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. )ane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composi
tion is the work ol cinematog
rapher Neslor Almendros.

The Black Hole ¥
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion pic
ture space race with a brilliant
plunge into the world of outer
space special effects, and falls flat
on its face. The effects are fun in
the beginning but the wires soon
become obnoxiously visible and
people start breathing in space.
The best acting is done by a tin
can named V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that
looks like a cross between Star
Wars' R2-D2 and a beer keg. The
movie plays like Captain Nemo in
space and the religious over
tones probably have Dante spin
ning in his grave.

Sunday, Mem Aud. 9 p.m.
Stankey Kubrick's classic lilm
may somehow seem "primitive"
by current sci-fi movie standards,
but this movie still transcends
any genre labels. Kubrick'i
domination ol the medium in this
overwhelmingly visual master
work is so obvious that you may
overlook the importance ot Ar
thur C. Clarke's original idea.
Clarke's conception perfectly fits
the grandeur of Kubrick's style
here, and the results are un
forgettable.

Yojimho it it it *
Tuesday-Wednesday, New Varsity
Pauline Kael called Yojimho
the first great "shaggy man
movie." The shaggy man in ques
tion is Toshiro Miiune, playing a
samurai warrior who comes into
a town ready to be hired by who
ever will pay him the most. It's a
twist on the western, where the
hired gun lights 'or the good
side; here both sides are bad,
and the samurai is happy to assist
them in wiping each other out.
The pace is set by the movie's lirst
scene, where a dog comes trot
ting out carrying not a hone but a
human hand. The very great
Akira Kurosawa directed.

The Great Dictator * * *
Thursday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
Chaplin's satire ot Hitler is
more like an attack, especially in
the closing sequences. Hitler is a
buffoon here, and Mussolini (ol
course) gets even worse treat
ment. Many truly great scenes,
including one where Chaplin as
Hitler wistfully contemplates a
balloon model ol the world,
dreaming of conquest. Chaplin's
too-long speechifying about
peace and love in the closing
moments almost kills the movie;
it's almost as il Chaplin doesn't
realize that everything the movit
has already done is worth lar
more than anything a five-minute
speech could ofter.

Albert I amorisse wrote arid di

about a friendless boy who finds
company with a peculiarly ami
able red balloon. You probably
saw this 36-minute tilm in the

adults as well. Le Balon Rouge
makes fine use ol its Parisian lo

Giant * * *
Old Mill, weekend midnight special
At this stage in his career, di
rector George Stevens (S/iane,
Gunga Dm) was obsessed with

making big, slow-moving epics,
regardless ol the subject. On at
least one level, this movie is sup
posed to be "about Texas," but
of the main characters, only
lames Dean rises to larger than
lit'e status. Elizabeth Taylor is in
termittently good, and Rock
Hudson is completely undone by
the sheer size ol the film. Dean's
perlormanc e was his last, not his
best, but he dominates Giant,
playing a seemingly worthless kid
who becomes one of the most
powerful men in Texas.

Electric Horseman it it *
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Almost constructed as the vis
ual equivalent of a Willie Nelson
song. The fact that Nelson's one
of the co-stars only enhances the
warm, nearly uneventful, yet
somehow quietly thoughtful feel
ing of this Robert Redford-|ane
Fonda star vehicle. Faded rodeo
slar Redford advertises breakfast
cereal lor a dehumanizing con
glomerate; he rebels by stealing
the corporation s mistreated
symbol — a $12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford tall in
love. The performances, espe
cially Redtord's, are fine, Sydney
Pollack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely ami
able movie, and there's nothing
much wrong with that.

19 41 * # *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion tor Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any
dramatic tension, but as a loving
expression of visual comedy,
1941 is the strongest effort in
years. Like a Stennelt or lloyd
two-reeler, 1941 is ail up front;
bodies fly all-too-trequently and
the comedy is generally not ol
the lasting variety. That may par
tially explain the very harsh reac-

tion of most c ritics to this movie;
also, such completely physical,
frenzied comedic action may be
horribly out ot place now.
Despite all that, I like this
movie. There isn't a physical
comedian working today better
than |ohn Belushi, and Dan Ayk
royd, Treat Williams, Toshiro
Mitune and Slim Pickens are all
line here. But Robert Stack, as
General "Vinegar |oe" Stilwell
quietly steals the show as he tear
fully watches Disney's Dumbo as
a full-scale riot goes on outside
the theater.

Tiddler on the Roof * * #
Friday, New Varsity
Norman lewison, who in 1971
was in much better torm than he
is now, directed this vibrant
movie musical, lewison doesn't
attempt to temper the theatrical
ity inherent in the material, yft
the movie doesn't get stagey —
lewison keeps things flowing
smoothly. As Tevye, the main
character, Topol may not be as
brilliant as /ero Mostel was in the

stage version but he still fills the
mighty role with a supreme zest
and vitality.

Animal House * * * *
Park, Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion ot white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of vari
ous forms of trat life in 62 works;
Animal House's approach tifs its
subject matter very well. .
As always, |ohn Belushi gives

an inspired performance as one
ot the "animals" in the "worst
trat on campus." I am never quite
sure just what drives Belushi, but
whatever it is, it must be good
stuft.
|ohn Landis directs as if
there's no speed but fast and no
volume but loud, and while that
doesn't hurt him too much here
(although, because of this ten
dency, Animal House has a de
cidedly limited emotional range),
I wonder if Landis can do any
thing else but movies like this.
Actually I wouldn't mind more
movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Going in Style it it it
Palo Alio Square
A very touching little movie.
It's been criticized for its slow
pacing and lack of ribald comedy,
but that's largely unjustified.
George Burns, Art Carney and
Lee Strasberg are a compelling
trio to watch, and in his feature
movie debut, 28-year-old
writer-director Martin Brest
makes up for his lack of plot ideas

with a compassionate and gentle
touch. Much of the movie's com
edy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie
is moody, emotionally wrench
ing. Well worth seeing, it only to
watch actors who don't need to
trample you to be effective.
—R.L.
The lerk ♦ *
Old Mill
I love Steve Martin, but this is
more an attempt to cash in on his
present status than an effort to
face tougher creative challenges.
Steve's born a "poor black
child," and several of the skits in
this rags to riches to rags story
revel so wildly in their dumbness
that they simply must be in
spired, but this just isn't the
movie that will make Martin a
memorable movie comedian.
He's got the unique moves and
he perhaps has got the mind, but
he doesn't yet have the material
— The lerk's more a stringing to
gether of sketches than a movie.
Maybe next time, okay?

Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
They call Kane the greatest
movie ever made, but don't let
that scare you away from seeing
it. It's a magnificent film that's
also a hell of a lot of tun to watch.
Orson Welles, who directs, star
red and co-wrote, called movies
the greatest electric train set a
boy ever had, and Kane is un
fused with a sense ot pure joy in
exploiting the capabilities ot the
medium. 1 radition has it that Wil
liam Randolph Hearst, after lind
ing out how similar the life of
Charles Foster Kane was to his
own, had the movie suppressed;
the truth may be that audiences
ot the time were simply unpre
pared for the movie's elliptical
narrative stiucture and
precedent-breaking technique.
Also starring Joseph Cotten,
Agnes Moorehead and Everett
Sloane. October, a Sergei Eisens
tein movie, makes up the second
half of Monday's double bill.

Apocalypse Now * * * *
Old Mill
Century 24, San lose
An amazing work ot maci
genius that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Cop
pola exhibits a firmly balanced in
telligence in his reworking of
loseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by
the superb cinematographer Vit
torio Storaro, Coppola creates
stunning images of Vietnam,
combining frightening energy
and intensity with humor, sensu
ality and overwhelming evil. It's a
journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fas
cinate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I

think, the best American movie
ot the just-ended decade. It has
almost untenable ambitions, but
the profound questions it con
fronts you with |ustity the seem
ing craziness ot this "impossi
ble," almost nihilistic , vision ot
mankind.
