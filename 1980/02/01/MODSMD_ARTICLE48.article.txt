Peking leadership change seen
Peking — Communist Party Chairman Hua
Guofeng may soon he forced to relinquish his post
as premier as part ot a nationwide campaign to
separate party politics trom administrative affairs,
according to well-placed Chinese sources here.
Cited most often as a possible replacement for
Hua, 59, is the party chief of Sichuan province,
Zhao /iyang, 61. An innovative administrator,
Zhao has earned national acclaim the past year for
pioneering economic, social and political reforms
widely copied elsewhere in China.
A Chinese source said the elevation of Zhao is
being promoted by Vice Premier Deng Xiaophing
and other aging leaders who fear that, after their
deaths, another succession crisis will take place
similar to the one that rocked China after the pas
sing of Mao Tse-tung, who died in 1976.
There is said to be continuing uneasiness among
China's people and leaders about one man's serv
ing simultaneously as premierand partychairman,
as Hua has done since 1976. Even Mao himself
never occupied both top positions.
The changeovers appear to reflect the desire ot
party veterans like Deng to return to the system of
the 19505, where party committees established
policy and left the implementation to separately
organized government bodies. The party would
remain in control, however, tor each new gover
nor would still attend party meetings where — as a
second or third secretary — he would be out
ranked by the local party chief.
Since Zhao was named party c hiet in December
1975, Sichuan in south-central China has set the
pace tor the rest of the country in curbing popula
tion growth, reorganizing industry and repairing
the damage done by tha Cultural Revolution. Al
though unable to feed its own population five
years ago, Sichuan now is not only self-sufficient
in grain but supplies neighboring provinces as
well.
To groom Zhao lor the premiership, a move is
underway to bring him to Peking as a vice premier,
a Chinese source said. II he continues to impress
party elders, he could be promoted to premier
when the National People's Congress, the
Chinese legislature, convenes late this year.
Ali supports Olympic boycott
New Delhi — Former heavyweight boxing
champion Muhammad Ali cut short an exhibition
tour ot India yesterday after President jimmy Car
ter asked him to visit African countries "as soon as
possible" to help gather support for a boycott ot
the Olympii Games in Moscow this summer.
At the same time, the Soviet Olympic Commit
tee called for the world's athletes and Olympic
officials to reject a move that "may split the very
Olympic movement."
Ali, after completing an exhibition bout with
sparring partner |immy Ellis in the south Indian city
of Madras, announced that he would cancel the
remaining three stops ot his six-city tour ot India.
He said he had received a "message from the
White House" Wednesday night.
In an open letter to the people and press oi India
read at a news conference, Ali explained, "I have
to curtail my India tour immediately as President
Carter has asked me to visit some African coun
tries as soon as possible. To them I have to explain
the U.S. stand on the subject ot the Moscow
Olympics."
Smith urges votes for Nkomo
Salislnjry, Rhodesia — Former Prime Minister lan
Smith moved yesterday to break the white minori

ty's political partnership with Bishop Abel
Muzorewa by urging Rhodesian whites to vote for
Patriotic Front guerrilla leader Joshua Nkomo if
that would prevent a Marxist government coming
to power here.
Smith's move caused an immediate uproar
among the leading black parties here. A spokes
man for Muzorewa bitterly denounced the former
political leader of the whites, saying Smith was
being "absolutely dangerous and mischievious."
Many of the 200,000 whites would find it difficult
to support Nkomo, since forces shot down two
Rhodesian airliners in the last 18 months, killing
about 100 whites.
Some whites have threatened to kill the veteran
nationalist leader, who has been surrounded by
heavy security since his return from exile earlier
this month.
Smith has considerable power to affect the out
come of the election, because of the complex vot
ing system established as part of the London peace
settlement signed last month.
His Rhodesia Front Party is certain to win all 20
seats set aside for whites in the 100-member Parli
ament. Thus, if the whites join with a coalition of
black parties having a total of 31 seats, they could
guarantee their black partners an absolute major
ity, even it Mugebe alone won a majority of the
black seats.
40 to 50 die in Kurdish revolts
Tehran, Iran — Between 40 and 50 people died in
clashes during the past three days in the Iranian
provinces ot Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Azer
baijan, informed sources said here yesterday.
Some 15 died on Tuesday in an attack by Kurdish
lighters on trucks carrying revolutionary guards at
Kamiaran, halfway between Kermanshah and
Sanandaj, the Iranian Kurdistan Democratic Party
(IKDP) said.
A different version of the incident, however,
was broadcast by Revolutionary Council member
Ezatolah Sahabi, who heads the government's
special mission on Kirdish problems.
Fie said the casualties followed the intervention
ot revolutionary guards at Kamiaran when fighting
broke out between the rival groups of Kurdish
extremists, the Rastgari and the Maoist Komeleh
group.
According to the IKDP, uncontirmed reports
from Kamiaran, scene ot Tuesday's fighting, said
that there were around 20 deaths in renewed vio
lence yesterday between Kurdish civilians and re
volutionary guards who claimed to be "fighters for
Islamic unity."
The IKDP was not responsible for the past three
days ot violence in Kurdistan, Dariush Foruhar, a
member of the government's mission to Kurdis
tan, told the franian news agency. Pars.
Carter thanks Canada for aid
Washington — President Jimmy Carter tele
phoned Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark yes
terday to thank him for Canada's "tremendous
exhibition of friendship and support" in smuggl
ing six American diplomats out ot Iran last
weekend.
The president added he had been informed that
the formal gesture of thanks expressed by Con
gress Wednesday had been the first time Congress
had shown concern that Iran might retaliate
against the 50 Americans still hostage in Tehran.
Carter replied that he didn't believe revelation of
the escape by the six who had been hiding in the
Canadian embassy "will be damaging to the well
being of our hostages."
U.S. officials are known to be hopeful that Ira
nian President-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr wants

to end the 89-day impasse over the hostages and,
once he has consolidated his power, will begin
seeking a way to negotiate their release.
The six escapes, who were flown back to the
United States Wednesday, spent yesterday under
tight security in officers' qaarters at Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware, awaiting the arrival of
their families.
Hodding Carter said the Untied states hopes to
continue normal relations with the communist
countries of Eastern Europe despite the deteriorat
ing of U.S. ties with the Soviet Union.

be doing something right it neither side likes it."

Peking leadership change seen
Peking — Communist Party Chairman Hua
Guofeng may soon he forced to relinquish his post
as premier as part ot a nationwide campaign to
separate party politics trom administrative affairs,
according to well-placed Chinese sources here.
Cited most often as a possible replacement for
Hua, 59, is the party chief of Sichuan province,
Zhao /iyang, 61. An innovative administrator,
Zhao has earned national acclaim the past year for
pioneering economic, social and political reforms
widely copied elsewhere in China.
A Chinese source said the elevation of Zhao is
being promoted by Vice Premier Deng Xiaophing
and other aging leaders who fear that, after their
deaths, another succession crisis will take place
similar to the one that rocked China after the pas
sing of Mao Tse-tung, who died in 1976.
There is said to be continuing uneasiness among
China's people and leaders about one man's serv
ing simultaneously as premierand partychairman,
as Hua has done since 1976. Even Mao himself
never occupied both top positions.
The changeovers appear to reflect the desire ot
party veterans like Deng to return to the system of
the 19505, where party committees established
policy and left the implementation to separately
organized government bodies. The party would
remain in control, however, tor each new gover
nor would still attend party meetings where — as a
second or third secretary — he would be out
ranked by the local party chief.
Since Zhao was named party c hiet in December
1975, Sichuan in south-central China has set the
pace tor the rest of the country in curbing popula
tion growth, reorganizing industry and repairing
the damage done by tha Cultural Revolution. Al
though unable to feed its own population five
years ago, Sichuan now is not only self-sufficient
in grain but supplies neighboring provinces as
well.
To groom Zhao lor the premiership, a move is
underway to bring him to Peking as a vice premier,
a Chinese source said. II he continues to impress
party elders, he could be promoted to premier
when the National People's Congress, the
Chinese legislature, convenes late this year.
Ali supports Olympic boycott
New Delhi — Former heavyweight boxing
champion Muhammad Ali cut short an exhibition
tour ot India yesterday after President jimmy Car
ter asked him to visit African countries "as soon as
possible" to help gather support for a boycott ot
the Olympii Games in Moscow this summer.
At the same time, the Soviet Olympic Commit
tee called for the world's athletes and Olympic
officials to reject a move that "may split the very
Olympic movement."
Ali, after completing an exhibition bout with
sparring partner |immy Ellis in the south Indian city
of Madras, announced that he would cancel the
remaining three stops ot his six-city tour ot India.
He said he had received a "message from the
White House" Wednesday night.
In an open letter to the people and press oi India
read at a news conference, Ali explained, "I have
to curtail my India tour immediately as President
Carter has asked me to visit some African coun
tries as soon as possible. To them I have to explain
the U.S. stand on the subject ot the Moscow
Olympics."
Smith urges votes for Nkomo
Salislnjry, Rhodesia — Former Prime Minister lan
Smith moved yesterday to break the white minori

ty's political partnership with Bishop Abel
Muzorewa by urging Rhodesian whites to vote for
Patriotic Front guerrilla leader Joshua Nkomo if
that would prevent a Marxist government coming
to power here.
Smith's move caused an immediate uproar
among the leading black parties here. A spokes
man for Muzorewa bitterly denounced the former
political leader of the whites, saying Smith was
being "absolutely dangerous and mischievious."
Many of the 200,000 whites would find it difficult
to support Nkomo, since forces shot down two
Rhodesian airliners in the last 18 months, killing
about 100 whites.
Some whites have threatened to kill the veteran
nationalist leader, who has been surrounded by
heavy security since his return from exile earlier
this month.
Smith has considerable power to affect the out
come of the election, because of the complex vot
ing system established as part of the London peace
settlement signed last month.
His Rhodesia Front Party is certain to win all 20
seats set aside for whites in the 100-member Parli
ament. Thus, if the whites join with a coalition of
black parties having a total of 31 seats, they could
guarantee their black partners an absolute major
ity, even it Mugebe alone won a majority of the
black seats.
40 to 50 die in Kurdish revolts
Tehran, Iran — Between 40 and 50 people died in
clashes during the past three days in the Iranian
provinces ot Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Azer
baijan, informed sources said here yesterday.
Some 15 died on Tuesday in an attack by Kurdish
lighters on trucks carrying revolutionary guards at
Kamiaran, halfway between Kermanshah and
Sanandaj, the Iranian Kurdistan Democratic Party
(IKDP) said.
A different version of the incident, however,
was broadcast by Revolutionary Council member
Ezatolah Sahabi, who heads the government's
special mission on Kirdish problems.
Fie said the casualties followed the intervention
ot revolutionary guards at Kamiaran when fighting
broke out between the rival groups of Kurdish
extremists, the Rastgari and the Maoist Komeleh
group.
According to the IKDP, uncontirmed reports
from Kamiaran, scene ot Tuesday's fighting, said
that there were around 20 deaths in renewed vio
lence yesterday between Kurdish civilians and re
volutionary guards who claimed to be "fighters for
Islamic unity."
The IKDP was not responsible for the past three
days ot violence in Kurdistan, Dariush Foruhar, a
member of the government's mission to Kurdis
tan, told the franian news agency. Pars.
Carter thanks Canada for aid
Washington — President Jimmy Carter tele
phoned Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark yes
terday to thank him for Canada's "tremendous
exhibition of friendship and support" in smuggl
ing six American diplomats out ot Iran last
weekend.
The president added he had been informed that
the formal gesture of thanks expressed by Con
gress Wednesday had been the first time Congress
had shown concern that Iran might retaliate
against the 50 Americans still hostage in Tehran.
Carter replied that he didn't believe revelation of
the escape by the six who had been hiding in the
Canadian embassy "will be damaging to the well
being of our hostages."
U.S. officials are known to be hopeful that Ira
nian President-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr wants

to end the 89-day impasse over the hostages and,
once he has consolidated his power, will begin
seeking a way to negotiate their release.
The six escapes, who were flown back to the
United States Wednesday, spent yesterday under
tight security in officers' qaarters at Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware, awaiting the arrival of
their families.
Hodding Carter said the Untied states hopes to
continue normal relations with the communist
countries of Eastern Europe despite the deteriorat
ing of U.S. ties with the Soviet Union.

Congress that calls tor a three-year halt to new
construction ol nuclear power plants.

it tilts toward industry," Udall concluded. "I must
be doing something right it neither side likes it."

Peking leadership change seen
Peking — Communist Party Chairman Hua
Guofeng may soon he forced to relinquish his post
as premier as part ot a nationwide campaign to
separate party politics trom administrative affairs,
according to well-placed Chinese sources here.
Cited most often as a possible replacement for
Hua, 59, is the party chief of Sichuan province,
Zhao /iyang, 61. An innovative administrator,
Zhao has earned national acclaim the past year for
pioneering economic, social and political reforms
widely copied elsewhere in China.
A Chinese source said the elevation of Zhao is
being promoted by Vice Premier Deng Xiaophing
and other aging leaders who fear that, after their
deaths, another succession crisis will take place
similar to the one that rocked China after the pas
sing of Mao Tse-tung, who died in 1976.
There is said to be continuing uneasiness among
China's people and leaders about one man's serv
ing simultaneously as premierand partychairman,
as Hua has done since 1976. Even Mao himself
never occupied both top positions.
The changeovers appear to reflect the desire ot
party veterans like Deng to return to the system of
the 19505, where party committees established
policy and left the implementation to separately
organized government bodies. The party would
remain in control, however, tor each new gover
nor would still attend party meetings where — as a
second or third secretary — he would be out
ranked by the local party chief.
Since Zhao was named party c hiet in December
1975, Sichuan in south-central China has set the
pace tor the rest of the country in curbing popula
tion growth, reorganizing industry and repairing
the damage done by tha Cultural Revolution. Al
though unable to feed its own population five
years ago, Sichuan now is not only self-sufficient
in grain but supplies neighboring provinces as
well.
To groom Zhao lor the premiership, a move is
underway to bring him to Peking as a vice premier,
a Chinese source said. II he continues to impress
party elders, he could be promoted to premier
when the National People's Congress, the
Chinese legislature, convenes late this year.
Ali supports Olympic boycott
New Delhi — Former heavyweight boxing
champion Muhammad Ali cut short an exhibition
tour ot India yesterday after President jimmy Car
ter asked him to visit African countries "as soon as
possible" to help gather support for a boycott ot
the Olympii Games in Moscow this summer.
At the same time, the Soviet Olympic Commit
tee called for the world's athletes and Olympic
officials to reject a move that "may split the very
Olympic movement."
Ali, after completing an exhibition bout with
sparring partner |immy Ellis in the south Indian city
of Madras, announced that he would cancel the
remaining three stops ot his six-city tour ot India.
He said he had received a "message from the
White House" Wednesday night.
In an open letter to the people and press oi India
read at a news conference, Ali explained, "I have
to curtail my India tour immediately as President
Carter has asked me to visit some African coun
tries as soon as possible. To them I have to explain
the U.S. stand on the subject ot the Moscow
Olympics."
Smith urges votes for Nkomo
Salislnjry, Rhodesia — Former Prime Minister lan
Smith moved yesterday to break the white minori

ty's political partnership with Bishop Abel
Muzorewa by urging Rhodesian whites to vote for
Patriotic Front guerrilla leader Joshua Nkomo if
that would prevent a Marxist government coming
to power here.
Smith's move caused an immediate uproar
among the leading black parties here. A spokes
man for Muzorewa bitterly denounced the former
political leader of the whites, saying Smith was
being "absolutely dangerous and mischievious."
Many of the 200,000 whites would find it difficult
to support Nkomo, since forces shot down two
Rhodesian airliners in the last 18 months, killing
about 100 whites.
Some whites have threatened to kill the veteran
nationalist leader, who has been surrounded by
heavy security since his return from exile earlier
this month.
Smith has considerable power to affect the out
come of the election, because of the complex vot
ing system established as part of the London peace
settlement signed last month.
His Rhodesia Front Party is certain to win all 20
seats set aside for whites in the 100-member Parli
ament. Thus, if the whites join with a coalition of
black parties having a total of 31 seats, they could
guarantee their black partners an absolute major
ity, even it Mugebe alone won a majority of the
black seats.
40 to 50 die in Kurdish revolts
Tehran, Iran — Between 40 and 50 people died in
clashes during the past three days in the Iranian
provinces ot Kurdistan, Kermanshah and Azer
baijan, informed sources said here yesterday.
Some 15 died on Tuesday in an attack by Kurdish
lighters on trucks carrying revolutionary guards at
Kamiaran, halfway between Kermanshah and
Sanandaj, the Iranian Kurdistan Democratic Party
(IKDP) said.
A different version of the incident, however,
was broadcast by Revolutionary Council member
Ezatolah Sahabi, who heads the government's
special mission on Kirdish problems.
Fie said the casualties followed the intervention
ot revolutionary guards at Kamiaran when fighting
broke out between the rival groups of Kurdish
extremists, the Rastgari and the Maoist Komeleh
group.
According to the IKDP, uncontirmed reports
from Kamiaran, scene ot Tuesday's fighting, said
that there were around 20 deaths in renewed vio
lence yesterday between Kurdish civilians and re
volutionary guards who claimed to be "fighters for
Islamic unity."
The IKDP was not responsible for the past three
days ot violence in Kurdistan, Dariush Foruhar, a
member of the government's mission to Kurdis
tan, told the franian news agency. Pars.
Carter thanks Canada for aid
Washington — President Jimmy Carter tele
phoned Canadian Prime Minister Joe Clark yes
terday to thank him for Canada's "tremendous
exhibition of friendship and support" in smuggl
ing six American diplomats out ot Iran last
weekend.
The president added he had been informed that
the formal gesture of thanks expressed by Con
gress Wednesday had been the first time Congress
had shown concern that Iran might retaliate
against the 50 Americans still hostage in Tehran.
Carter replied that he didn't believe revelation of
the escape by the six who had been hiding in the
Canadian embassy "will be damaging to the well
being of our hostages."
U.S. officials are known to be hopeful that Ira
nian President-elect Abolhassan Bani Sadr wants

to end the 89-day impasse over the hostages and,
once he has consolidated his power, will begin
seeking a way to negotiate their release.
The six escapes, who were flown back to the
United States Wednesday, spent yesterday under
tight security in officers' qaarters at Dover Air
Force Base in Delaware, awaiting the arrival of
their families.
Hodding Carter said the Untied states hopes to
continue normal relations with the communist
countries of Eastern Europe despite the deteriorat
ing of U.S. ties with the Soviet Union.

the Environment, yesterday introduced a bill in
Congress that calls tor a three-year halt to new
construction ol nuclear power plants.
Udall's bill lays down three conditions to be met

it tilts toward industry," Udall concluded. "I must
be doing something right it neither side likes it."
