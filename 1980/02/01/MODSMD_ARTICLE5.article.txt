# Quake expert here predicts Big One 'due any day now'

The odds ,ire even that a major
earthquake will occur in Califor
nia during the naxt decade. Ac
cording to Prof. Haresh Shah, di
rector of Blume Earthquake
Center here, an earthquake of
magnitude seven or greater on
the Richter scale, is "due any day
now."
Along with other structural en
gineers and researc hers at Blume.
Shah has done a seismic hazard
analysis of the Bay Area that in
cludes the University campus.
Based on his study, a major ear
thquake occurring in the next 20
years could cause damages of $50
million to the University. Man
zanita Park alone could suffer
$2.31 million
"The trailers are some of the
flimsiest buildings built in terms
of earthquake resistance," said
Shah.

Shah noted that his damage es
timates are based on partial data.
The rate he uses for the risk
analysis is $70 per square foot.
When a building is designed so
that its walls < .in bend without col
lapsing, Shah said, it is a sate rand
more reliable structure Collaps
mg roots are a major cause of
death in earthquakes. By properly
tying together the walls, floor and
roof of a building, the building
can better meet the criteria tor
earthquake safety.
The new wing of the University
hospital has been designed with
great care and a iow probability of
collapse, Shah said, like most
emergency facilities, the hospital
is built to remain operational dur
ing and after an earthquake.
However, Shah was not op
timistic about the benefits of such
stringent hospital construction.
"What good is a hospital it the

doctor can't get there?" he asked.
According to Shah, both the
highrises in Escondido and the
lowrises made of timber are fairly
safe.
Referring to the false impres
sion that there is such a thing as
absolute safety in building design,
Shah said, "Even if Cod comes
and tells me 'here is the ear
thquake for which you're to de
sign, I still can't say there's no
risk."
Robert Beth, director of Insur
ance and Risk Management, said
the most vulnerable buildings on
campus are those in the Quad. In
a study conducted 10 years ago by
Risk Management, it was esti
mated that a major earthquake
could cause 10 percent damage
overall to the campus. But
"people don't realize that 10 per
cent is a huge amount," Shah

chance of another major quake within the next
decade, it's unlikely that another famous physicist
will lose his head in this manner.
