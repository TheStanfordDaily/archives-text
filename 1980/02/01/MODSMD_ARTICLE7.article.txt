Ottawa — Canada's government, bask
ing in unaccustomed international glory,
Wednesday belittled Iranian threats to get
even lor the smuggling of six American
diplomats out of Iran last weekend.
112 sternal Aftairs Minister flora Mac
Donald, in a Toronto television interview,
noted that Canada's relations with Iran
have already "dwindled almost to no
thing" since American hostages were
seized in Tehran 12 weeks ago.
"I didn't expect Mr. Chotbzadeh to
tome out and praise she said, refer
ring to .1 threat by Iranian I oreign Minister
Sadegh C.hotb/adeh to "make Canada
pay' tor spiriting the Americans out ot
Tehran.
The six Americans escaped with Cana
dian passports early Monday morning

after hiding for three months in Canadian
Embassy residences. The six arrived at
Dover Air Force Base in Delaware on
Wednesday, U.S. officials said.
'Canadian caper'
Details ot the cloak-and-dagger mission
trickled out Wednesday in this capital,
where proud Canadians and thankful
Americans have begun lionizing Cana
dian officials for pulling ott wh.it has al
ready been dubbed "the Canadian caper.''
Details were pieced together in inter
views with Canadian officials who coordi
nated the tense three-month diplomatic
effort in Tehran, Ottawa and Washington.
Although the escape had been planned
for two weeks, the story only surfaced
Tuesday with reports that the six Ameri
cans - all believed to be in good health —
and four remaining Canadian diplomats

left fehran by airplane for Europe.
Favorable time
Plans to smuggle out the Americans
began to form about two weeks ago, a time
considered favorable because the Iranians
were distrac ted by the Soviet military inva
sion ot neighboring Afghanistan and their
first presidential election.
Several possibilities were considered in
Ottawa, including disguising the stowa
ways as American businessmen or giving
Ihem passports from a thiid nation. Fi
nally, officials dec ided to give them Cana
dian passports to ease their way through
customs at the Tehran airport.
Issuing the passports to non-Canadian
tifizens required a special Cabinet order.
Once approval was given in Ottawa, the
Canadians were given help by U.S. intelli
gence agencies in producing Iranian visas.
