# 'Will a civilized man eat dog?'
## Hong Kong splits over dog eaters 
### 
The los Angeles Times
Hongkong — Winter, such as it is, has
arrived in Hong Kong, reviving an age
old debate over a tantalizing question:
Will a civili/ed man eat a dog?
The debate, which is renamed practi
cally every year as the temperatures
plunge trom the 90s into the 70s, pits
the dog-loving fnglish who nominally
rule this tiny Crown colony against the
dogmeat-loving Chinese who make up
44 percent ot the populace and insist
there is nothing like a helping ot man's
best friend to ward off a winter chill.
The question should be moot, be
cause sine e 1 l )'5U it has been illegal here
to butcher or consume dogs. But the
law must be the most widely detied law
since Prohibition, tor many Chinese
llatly refuse to torsake the delicacy dis
creetly marketed in alleyways as "frag
rant meat" or hornless goat."
*\ British executive once suggested in
a letter to the editor ot a Hong Kong
newspaper that anyone who eats dog
should be strung up, castrated and
beaten to a veritable pulp."
European arrogance?
From the other side ot the cultural
c hasm came this reply: "Dogmeat is a
natural part ot the traditional Chinese
diet, dignified by ancient custom . . .
This dogmeat business is yet another
example oi the unthinking, unfeeling
arrogance ot the European in Asia."
t his winter's controversy over canine
c uisine was incited by, ot all people, the
HUOO-member Hong Kong chapter ot
the Royal Society tor the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Though normally a
pack ot devout dog lovers, the society
enraged its usual supporters and de
lighted local Chinese by suggesting that

maybe there was nothing so bad about
eating dog, after all, and that maybe the
ban ought to be repealed.
"There is nothing sacred about the
dog," an editorial in the society's an
nual report said. "There is no logical
reason why dogmeat should not be
eaten, provided the dogs are especially
bred for the table (not pets or trained
dogs) and provided the killing method
is humane."
That's when the fur began to fly.
There were immediate demands tor
the resignation ot Michael Webster, the
society vice president who wrote the
editorial. Several society members quit
on the spot, one ot them announcing,
"We no longer want to be associated
with an organization that endorses the
slaughter of dogs where there is no
food shortage."
Hong Kong's many Chinese
language papers c ailed for repeal of the
ban on dog consumption and so, sur
prisingly, did the south China Morning
Post, normally the voice of the colony's
conservative and ever-so-British Estab
lishment.
Old Story
Despite the turor, man-bites-dog is a
very old story in China, the
pharmaceutical virtues of dogmeat are
celebrated in Chinese writings dating
back at least to the 4th Century BC,
when the philosopher Mencius praised
it as a panacea that could cure every
thing from malaria to jaundice.
An emperor who needed more war
riors later offered "a succulent puppy"
to any woman in his kingdom who
would bear a son. Recipes from the Han
Dynasty (202 BC to AD 220) extolled
dog. One common recipe called for the

liver ot a dog to be wrapped in a thin
casing of its own tat and roasted until "a
crackling linisli can be achieved."
Dogs first took on political connota
tions at the beginning of this century,
when Sun Yat-sen's followers hatched
their plans to overthrow the emperor
over plates ot dogmeat, by then a sym
bol of Manchu oppression. Their code
woid tor dog was "three-six meat," be
cause the Cantonese word for the
number nine is thr same as the sound
tor do«.
$1000 tine
In Hong Kong, the custom is for a
small group of triends to band to
gether, raise a puppy especially for the
cooking pot and, when he is about six
months old, prepare a feast. Because
the penalties for eating dog are stiff — a
$1000 fine and six months in jail — only
close-mouthed, completely trustwor
thy guests are invited.
It is impossible to ascertain how
widespread is the consumption of dog.
Some young Westernized Chinese say
they have never tasted dog and never
care to, thank you. But Yu Chong-sang,
a recent arrival from China, says, "Of
course I eat dog occasionally. Doesn't
everybody?"
Though there is growing tolerance
on the British side for old Chinese
habits, many Chinese here still profess
not to understand the "Love me, love
my dog" attitude ot the British.
0 "It's hard for me to hide my feelings
when I visit European or American
friends and see how they let their dogs
climb into their laps and lick their
hands," said Cecila Wong, a well
traveled government worker. "Now
that's really disgusting."

Old Story
Despite the turor, man-bites-dog is a
very old story in China, the
pharmaceutical virtues of dogmeat are
celebrated in Chinese writings dating
back at least to the 4th Century BC,
when the philosopher Mencius praised
it as a panacea that could cure every
thing from malaria to jaundice.
An emperor who needed more war
riors later offered "a succulent puppy"
to any woman in his kingdom who
would bear a son. Recipes from the Han
Dynasty (202 BC to AD 220) extolled
dog. One common recipe called for the

liver ot a dog to be wrapped in a thin
casing of its own tat and roasted until "a
crackling linisli can be achieved."
Dogs first took on political connota
tions at the beginning of this century,
when Sun Yat-sen's followers hatched
their plans to overthrow the emperor
over plates ot dogmeat, by then a sym
bol of Manchu oppression. Their code
woid tor dog was "three-six meat," be
cause the Cantonese word for the
number nine is thr same as the sound
tor do«.

In Hong Kong, the custom is for a
small group of triends to band to

It is impossible to ascertain how

everybody?"

on the British side for old Chinese

not to understand the "Love me, love

Hongkong — Winter, such as it is, has
arrived in Hong Kong, reviving an age
old debate over a tantalizing question:
Will a civili/ed man eat a dog?
The debate, which is renamed practi
cally every year as the temperatures
plunge trom the 90s into the 70s, pits
the dog-loving fnglish who nominally
rule this tiny Crown colony against the
dogmeat-loving Chinese who make up
44 percent ot the populace and insist
there is nothing like a helping ot man's
best friend to ward off a winter chill.
The question should be moot, be
cause sine e 1 l )'5U it has been illegal here
to butcher or consume dogs. But the
law must be the most widely detied law
since Prohibition, tor many Chinese
llatly refuse to torsake the delicacy dis
creetly marketed in alleyways as "frag
rant meat" or hornless goat."
*\ British executive once suggested in
a letter to the editor ot a Hong Kong
newspaper that anyone who eats dog
should be strung up, castrated and
beaten to a veritable pulp."
European arrogance?
From the other side ot the cultural
c hasm came this reply: "Dogmeat is a
natural part ot the traditional Chinese
diet, dignified by ancient custom . . .
This dogmeat business is yet another
example oi the unthinking, unfeeling
arrogance ot the European in Asia."
t his winter's controversy over canine
c uisine was incited by, ot all people, the
HUOO-member Hong Kong chapter ot
the Royal Society tor the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals. Though normally a
pack ot devout dog lovers, the society
enraged its usual supporters and de
lighted local Chinese by suggesting that

maybe there was nothing so bad about
eating dog, after all, and that maybe the
ban ought to be repealed.
"There is nothing sacred about the
dog," an editorial in the society's an
nual report said. "There is no logical
reason why dogmeat should not be
eaten, provided the dogs are especially
bred for the table (not pets or trained
dogs) and provided the killing method
is humane."
