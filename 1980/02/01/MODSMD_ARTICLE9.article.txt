# China's cultural revolution re-examined

### Cameron Smith 
China's cultural revolution
oi the late 1960s was not simply
ihe "feudal revival" de
nounced by the country's
post-Mao leadership, said
Lung-Kee Sun, a doctoral can
didate in history Monday.
" fhe tirst phase (of the revol
ution) . . . lasted Irom 1966 to
1967 when a genuine re
volutionary drive did exist, and
a second phase began when

the revolution had virtually col
lapsed, and the pseudo
radicalism which followed
gradually assumed the aspects
o! a teudal revival," he said to
70 persons at a lecture spon
sored by the Bechtel Interna
tional Center.
The tirst phase was marked
by the Mao-inspired Shanghai
rebellion in lanuary 1967, when
the masses established a com
munal government to give di
rect control ot political power
to the laborers, he said.
According to Sun, the upris
ing was a development ol
Mao's theory of "continuous
revolution," in which the
working class continues to
struggle tor power in order to
avoid "state capitalism" even
alter nationalization ot the
means of production and in
stitution of a planned
economy.
"Thus the Maoist 'second
revolution took the form ol a
direct assault on the state ap
paratus itself," Sun said. "It did
not achieve its goal."
Fiction
First, the masses were torced
to share power with party
cadres and the military in a Re
volutionary Committee, he
said, "but as time went on.

even this kind ol 'people's
power' became more and
more a fiction."
Eventually resistance trom
the party bureaucracy and the
military led to purges of ultra
leftists, the most tragic ot
which was the massacre ot
SO,OOO rebels in Kwangsi in
early 1968.
"It is the supreme irony that
the same bunch of people who
drowned the mass movement
in a bloodbath are now de
nouncing the 'excess' ot the
Cultural Revolution," Sun ad
ded.
The second phase of the re
volution occurred within the
reinstated bureaucratic
Iramework and substituted a
"pseudo-radicalism" for the
original goal of building the
organs of worker power, ac
cording to Sun.
'Feudal reaction'
"The anti-capitalist thrust ot
this pseudo-radicalism more
and more assumed the aspects
of a feudal reaction against
modern life," Sun said.
The new leadership, the so
called "Gang of Four,''
achieved power at the expen' e
of professional "bourgeois"
bureaucrats and began to
promote anti-professional and

anti-intellectual measures.
"Pro were sent to the
countryside to unlearn every*
thing and to turn themselves
into peasants, while people
who flunked the exams were
promoted into positions of
power," Sun said.
Rejection
"This rejection of modernity
stemmed trom China's
ideological rejection ot the
post World War II Western
concept ot modernization,
which stressed the universal
necessity of a West-sponsored
'global development prog
ram,' "he said. To the Western
mind, the resistance of the
traditional, non-Western
societies to modernization is
irrational, he added.
In the light of this theory,
Sun drew comparisons bet
ween the responses of Stalin
ist Russia, the Iranian revolu
tion, Cambodia's Pol Pot re
gime and China's cultural re
volution toward the West and
modernization.
Today, however, by de
i ourici.ig the "feudal revival"
ot the Cultural revolution, the
post-Mao leadership of China
is saying that capitalism is more
progressive than feudalism,
Sun said.

First, the masses were torced
to share power with party
cadres and the military in a Re
volutionary Committee, he
said, "but as time went on.

even this kind ol 'people's
power' became more and
more a fiction."
Eventually resistance trom
the party bureaucracy and the
military led to purges of ultra
leftists, the most tragic ot
which was the massacre ot
SO,OOO rebels in Kwangsi in
early 1968.
"It is the supreme irony that
the same bunch of people who
drowned the mass movement
in a bloodbath are now de
nouncing the 'excess' ot the
Cultural Revolution," Sun ad
ded.
The second phase of the re
volution occurred within the
reinstated bureaucratic
Iramework and substituted a
"pseudo-radicalism" for the
original goal of building the
organs of worker power, ac
cording to Sun.
'Feudal reaction'
"The anti-capitalist thrust ot
this pseudo-radicalism more
and more assumed the aspects
of a feudal reaction against
modern life," Sun said.
The new leadership, the so
called "Gang of Four,''
achieved power at the expen' e
of professional "bourgeois"
bureaucrats and began to
promote anti-professional and

anti-intellectual measures.
"Pro were sent to the
countryside to unlearn every*
thing and to turn themselves
into peasants, while people
who flunked the exams were
promoted into positions of
power," Sun said.
Rejection
"This rejection of modernity
stemmed trom China's
ideological rejection ot the
post World War II Western
concept ot modernization,
which stressed the universal
necessity of a West-sponsored
'global development prog
ram,' "he said. To the Western
mind, the resistance of the
traditional, non-Western
societies to modernization is
irrational, he added.
In the light of this theory,
Sun drew comparisons bet
ween the responses of Stalin
ist Russia, the Iranian revolu
tion, Cambodia's Pol Pot re
gime and China's cultural re
volution toward the West and
modernization.
Today, however, by de
i ourici.ig the "feudal revival"
ot the Cultural revolution, the
post-Mao leadership of China
is saying that capitalism is more
progressive than feudalism,
Sun said.
