# Speculation ends after week-long search
## Paul Wiggin accepts head football post 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
After only a week of searching for someone to
replace former football coach Rod Dowhower, Ath
letic Director Andy Geiger and the Stanford Athletic
Department announced Friday morning that Paul
Wiggin. the defensive coordinator ot the New Or
leans Saints, will assume the head coaching post here.
Wiggin replaced Dowhower, who resigned last
Wednesday to become offensive coordinator of the
Denver Broncos.
"The search was a comprehensive one.' said
Geiger at a press conference held Friday. It was
quick yet thorough. We looked at all the options
carefully.
" I'm thrilled that Paul Wiggin is returning to Stan
ford to direct our football program." Geiger con
tinued. "Paul is recognized as one of the greatest
football minds in America. He represents integrity,
honesty and quality in football coaching."
Wiggin signed a five-year contract, the terms of
which were not disclosed.
Wiggin started three years as defensive tackle tor
Stanford in the mid-'sos, receiving All-America rec
ognition in 1955 and 1956. He returns to his alma
mater after 24 years in the NFL to face, as a defensive
coordinator, a team which has had three coaches in
four years and which has built its reputation on Inn

ing the finest offense in the country.
He is a defensive specialist at a school where the
offense dominates and that has been the biggest prob
lem facing the new coach.
"I know I've got some adjusting to do and some
extensive learning." said Wiggin at the press confer
ence. "But I mean to seek out the best offensive
thinkers I can find. I'm certainly not going to make an
option quarterback out ot someone like John F.l
way."
Wiggin was quick, though, to point out the impor
tance of a strong defense, something Stanford has not
had consistently.
"I'm not a George Allen (former Washington Red
skin coach ). where the perfect game is 2-0." he said,
"but I think you can have both. A good defense will
let the offense on the field a lot longer."
The Athletic Department seemed quite pleased
with the appointment, but Wiggin might be the hap
piest ot anyone, saying that "they didn't have to
convince me to come."
He has been out of college football for quite a
while, but on Friday he seemed exhilerated to be
back.
"Stanford has always been a \ery special place to
me." he said. "I'm excited to be back in a college
environment. I'm impressed with the entire climate
of the Athletic Department and I'm impressed with

their goals.
"I want to be a part of that. I want to be here as the
program grows. I can see being here a long time.
He also added,"l can't see being back in pro toot
ball." which is very comforting to a community which
has seen two coaches go to the NFL in a span ot two
years.
The mix-up of coaches over those years jumbled
this past season's team into losing a number ot games
they had no business losing.
"I want to keep the transition as smooth as possible
and I don't think it will be too hard." said Wiggin.
who will become notorious for his flat-top buzz cut.
"Initially the haircut can scare a player, but when
you get beyond that. I'm a pretty nice guy," he said.
"I really enjoy working with people and I enjoy that
kind of challenge. I feel I get along well with young
people. I kind ot think I should have been a kinder
garten park supers isor or something. 1 enjoy the pros
but it (football) comes closer to tilling my needs on
the college level."
Wiggin is already settling in nicely. He has met a lot
of the players and is taking up wholeheartedly the
recruiting effort which was heaped upon him.
"It'ssomething I've never done before and 1 have a
lot to learn â€”but 1 can't wait." he said. "There are 14
people coming in this weekend and I'm really ex
cited."
