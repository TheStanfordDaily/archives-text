# Former Canal Zone governor sees smooth operation
## Canal expert predicts treaty success 
### Bob Deyling Staff Writer 
I he Panama Canal should
continue to function "reasonably
well" tor the rest of this century,
according to General David
Parker, retired governor of the
Canal Zone. Parker addressed
30 people on the Panama Canal
at a recent discussion at Bolivar
House.
However, Parker said he
foresees problems with the cur
rent treaty to relinquish control
ot the canal. "The main source of
friction is the divided authority
the treaty creates. As the Ameri
can technicians reach the
Panamanians what they need to
know, there is constantly a ques

tion of who the workers are re
sponsible to — the Panamanian
government or the transitional
authority which includes five
Americans and four Panama
nians."
"The Panamanian press does
much to aggravate the situation,
infuriating Americans and
Panamanians at the same time,"
he said.
The real test of the treaty is
whether or not the operation of
the canal has been disturbed, he
said. "The first five months
under the treaty has seen no in
terruption of the canal services,
and the time ships take to go
through the canal has remained
constant," Parker said.
A graduate of West Point in
1940, Parker worked with the
Army Corps of Engineers during
World War 11. the Korean con
flict and in Vietnam. He served
tor two years with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and as
sisted Adlai Stevenson at the
U.N. Security Council during the
Cuban Missile Crisis.
Parker had served as governor
of the Canal Zone and president
of the Panama Canal Company
since March of 1971.
Main problem
Although the United States
was always able to keep the canal
running smoothl), "the main
problem lor the Panamanians
was always the existence of an
area within their country in
which they were subject to U.S.
law," Parker said.
American officials in Panama
recommended in the early "50s
the construction of a road over
the entire Canal Zone which was
to be entirely under Panamanian

jurisdiction. "In my opinion,
such a road would have eased
some of the tension, but all
proposals were defeated in
Congress, presumably in the in
terest of national security," he
said.
Parker said the main impedi
ment in the adjustment of prob
lems concerning the Panama
Canal has consistently been the
United States Congress.
"In the case of the canal and
American foreign policy in gen
eral, the split between the execu
tive branch and the Congress
creates inconsistent policy,"
Parker said. "The president's
views tend to be more progres
sive and more informed than
Congress."
Farsightedness
Parker praised the
farsightedness of American en
gineers in designing the canal.
"The canal was built within
budget, on schedule and to ?he
strictest standards of construc
tion and safety," he said. He de
tended the United States' policy
of allowing passage of ships of all
nations, adding that this policy
was never really tested in war
since no German or Japanese
ships attempted to use the canal
during the war.
Addressing questions on the
strategic value of the canal.
Parker said that today the canal
is so vulnerable to attack by air
that it has lost much of its
strategic importance.
"The reduction of United
States presence in Latin America
since World War II has swung
strategic emphasis away from the
canal. It was very important dur
ing World War II — indeed, it

was the only way the United
States was able to fight a war in
two theaters at the same time,"
he said.
The canal was used for rapid
deployment of troops from bases
in Latin America, ammunition
storage, as an access to ports and
Latin American oil. "Neither
Japanese nor German planes or
submarines could reach the canal
without being detected," making
the canal invulnerable to attack v
Parker noted.
Bases needed
Parker stressed the impor
tance of keeping some type of
American military presence in
Latin America. "We need the
rights to use certain military
bases in and around the Canal
Zone in order to defend the
Caribbean area. One good fea
ture of the treaty is that the Un
ited States has reserved the right
to use the canal to transport
troops," he said.
Parker said he admires many
people in the State Department
and the CIA because they are
"outstanding people" who ad
vise the president well. He also
criticized Congress for letting
political considerations interfere
with their legislative duties.
"Government service is a very
rewarding way to live," Parker
said of his 35 years as a civil ser
vant. "We need more profes
sionals in the government, be
cause Washington is a tough beat
which requires outstanding
people," he said. "Our govern
ment will be better equipped to
deal with the problems of the fu
ture if young people out of col
lege are motivated to seek
careers in government."

terest of national security," he
said.
Parker said the main impedi
ment in the adjustment of prob
lems concerning the Panama
Canal has consistently been the
United States Congress.
"In the case of the canal and
American foreign policy in gen
eral, the split between the execu
tive branch and the Congress
creates inconsistent policy,"
Parker said. "The president's
views tend to be more progres
sive and more informed than
Congress."
Farsightedness
Parker praised the
farsightedness of American en
gineers in designing the canal.
"The canal was built within
budget, on schedule and to ?he
strictest standards of construc
tion and safety," he said. He de
tended the United States' policy
of allowing passage of ships of all
nations, adding that this policy
was never really tested in war
since no German or Japanese
ships attempted to use the canal
during the war.
Addressing questions on the
strategic value of the canal.
Parker said that today the canal
is so vulnerable to attack by air
that it has lost much of its
strategic importance.
"The reduction of United
States presence in Latin America
since World War II has swung
strategic emphasis away from the
canal. It was very important dur
ing World War II — indeed, it

was the only way the United
States was able to fight a war in
two theaters at the same time,"
he said.
The canal was used for rapid
deployment of troops from bases
in Latin America, ammunition
storage, as an access to ports and
Latin American oil. "Neither
Japanese nor German planes or
submarines could reach the canal
without being detected," making
the canal invulnerable to attack v
Parker noted.
Bases needed
Parker stressed the impor
tance of keeping some type of
American military presence in
Latin America. "We need the
rights to use certain military
bases in and around the Canal
Zone in order to defend the
Caribbean area. One good fea
ture of the treaty is that the Un
ited States has reserved the right
to use the canal to transport
troops," he said.
Parker said he admires many
people in the State Department
and the CIA because they are
"outstanding people" who ad
vise the president well. He also
criticized Congress for letting
political considerations interfere
with their legislative duties.
"Government service is a very
rewarding way to live," Parker
said of his 35 years as a civil ser
vant. "We need more profes
sionals in the government, be
cause Washington is a tough beat
which requires outstanding
people," he said. "Our govern
ment will be better equipped to
deal with the problems of the fu
ture if young people out of col
lege are motivated to seek
careers in government."
I he Panama Canal should
continue to function "reasonably
well" tor the rest of this century,
according to General David
Parker, retired governor of the
Canal Zone. Parker addressed
30 people on the Panama Canal
at a recent discussion at Bolivar
House.
However, Parker said he
foresees problems with the cur
rent treaty to relinquish control
ot the canal. "The main source of
friction is the divided authority
the treaty creates. As the Ameri
can technicians reach the
Panamanians what they need to
know, there is constantly a ques

tion of who the workers are re
sponsible to — the Panamanian
government or the transitional
authority which includes five
Americans and four Panama
nians."
"The Panamanian press does
much to aggravate the situation,
infuriating Americans and
Panamanians at the same time,"
he said.
The real test of the treaty is
whether or not the operation of
the canal has been disturbed, he
said. "The first five months
under the treaty has seen no in
terruption of the canal services,
and the time ships take to go
through the canal has remained
constant," Parker said.
A graduate of West Point in
1940, Parker worked with the
Army Corps of Engineers during
World War 11. the Korean con
flict and in Vietnam. He served
tor two years with the Defense
Intelligence Agency, and as
sisted Adlai Stevenson at the
U.N. Security Council during the
Cuban Missile Crisis.
Parker had served as governor
of the Canal Zone and president
of the Panama Canal Company
since March of 1971.
Main problem
Although the United States
was always able to keep the canal
running smoothl), "the main
problem lor the Panamanians
was always the existence of an
area within their country in
which they were subject to U.S.
law," Parker said.
American officials in Panama
recommended in the early "50s
the construction of a road over
the entire Canal Zone which was
to be entirely under Panamanian

jurisdiction. "In my opinion,
such a road would have eased
some of the tension, but all
proposals were defeated in
Congress, presumably in the in
terest of national security," he
said.
