TOKYO — When Paul McCartney, the
rock music idol, was jailed here recently on a
marijuana charge, he was held in a cell next
to one occupied by an accused spy.
McCartney, who had been arrested for try
ing to bring about eight ounces of marijuana
into Japan, was released after 10 days in
custody, but could have been sent to prison
for up to seven years.
The accused spy, retired Maj. Gen. Yukih
isa Miyanaga, admitted passing secret infor
mation to the Soviet Union, and faced a
maximum prison term of one year on a
charge ot tailing to protect state secrets.
Japan has no specific law against spying.
The incident says a lot about Japan's at
titude toward drugs. And. in the eyes of
Japanese police, it says a lot about Japan's
low crime rate.
"The cost of drugs and hallucinations pro
duced by drugs have a close causal effect on
crime,' Yoshitake Shimada. assistant direc
tor ot the Public Security Division of Japan's
National Police, said recently. "Of the crimi
nals in New York City street crime, 60 per
cent are drug users. Drugs constitute a big
reason lor the miserable —at least compared
with Japan — condition of public safety in
the United States."
Japan is one of the world's few advanced
nations where drugs have not become a
major social problem, yet the police are con
cerned. Shimada said, with the trend that has
developed since 1970.
Speed
Although the numbers remain relatively
small, drug arrests have skyrocketed, and the
big problem comes from the spreading use of
hard, dependency-creating drugs like am
phetamines, also known as "speed."
Last year about 18.000 people were ar
rested for violating Japan's anti-stimulant
law. while only slightly more than 1000 were
arrested for violating the marijuana control
law. The police are particularly concerned,

because those arrest levels are two and three
times what they were five years ago.
McCartney's arrest did not help the police
in their battle against a slowly growing body
of public opinion favoring acceptance of
marijuana. Shimada said.
"The 40 or 50 boys and girls who gathered
outside the jail yelling (in an attempt to cheer
up McCartney) skipped school to do that,"
he went on. The arrest made them feel a
repulsion toward the police and probably
stimulated them to do the same thing."
Positive effect
Breaking into a smile, the police officer
said there was probably one positive effect of
McCartney's arrest — it should "diminish
the use (of drugs) by foreigners coming to
Japan."
Most of the drug arrests, Shimada said,
involved pushers, each of whom was believed
to have at least five or six regular customers.
Thus, he estimated that Japan has perhaps
300.000 habitual drug users, less than three
tenths of one percent of the population.
By comparison, a report on drug use in the
United States, submitted to Congress by
President Jimmy Carter in August 1977, es
timated that several hundred thousand
Americans were using heroin and that 11
million were using marijuana.
"We don't want to follow in the steps of
failure of the United States, Europe and Au
stralia," Shimada said.
The main reason for Japan's severity in
connection with drugs, he said, was the wish
to "protect the health of each person in the
nation."
Prevention of crime, he said, is a secondary
but nonetheless major motive, particularly
because drugs have become the No. 1 source
of income for the nation's underworld.
For most of Japan's history, drugs were not
considered a problem. Not until 1948, when
Gen. Douglas A. Mac Arthur, commander of
U.S. occupation forces, ordered it, did Japan
enact a law banning marijuana. And not until

1951 did a ban on hard drugs come into
effect.
Opium war
During the isolationist Tokugawa period
(1603-1868), Japan's leaders frowned on
drugs. The Opium War in China reinforced
their attitude. When they opened Japan to
contacts with the outside world, they ordered
death penalties for smoking opium and took
care to write an anti-opium clause into Ja
pan's first trade treaty with Great Britain.
Stiff jail sentences, combined with man
datory hospitalization for heroin addicts —
they must quit the habit "cold turkey," with
no help trom substitute drugs — ended the
"heroin era" in the mid-19605, Shimada
said.
"Marijuana use is spreading because of
influence from the United States, particu
larly among Japanese who blindly adore any
thing the United States does," Shimada said.
Shimada pointed out that the 1973 at
tempt to make punishment for drug use more
severe made no provision for fines. Many
judges, he said, are reluctant to sentence a
first offender to jail, so many first offenders
are placed on probation.
In 1977, the last year for which statistics
are available, only 44 percent of the defen
dants found guilty of drug offenses were sent
to prison. Among those who were, however,
82 percent were sentenced to more than a
year."Stiff jail sentences are an important
deterrent, but even more important,"
Shimada said, is the "social punishment
meted out to drug offenders. The shame a
youth caught smoking marijuana can bring to
his family often makes it hard for a father to •
keep his job."
Large companies would dismiss an
employee convicted of using drugs, even ■
marijuana. Government regulations require
the dismissal of civil servants jailed for use of
drugs of any kind.
In McCartney's case, the police feel that
he, too, received "social punishment."
