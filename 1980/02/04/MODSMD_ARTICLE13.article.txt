# Recycling groups working to combat waste problems

"Palo Alto and Stanford will
not have a place to put their
waste within 15 years." warned
Bob Wenzlau, a senior here who
works at the Palo Alto Recycling
Center.
The landfills at the Baylands,
where refuse is presently depo
sited, are filling up due to the 200
ton per day waste produced by
Stanford and Palo Alto, accord
ing to Wenzlau.
"They are producing enough
garbage to fill a football field a
yard deep each day,"he
explained.
In response to the problem,
the Palo Alto Recycling Center
has developed a program to re
duce waste 25 percent through
recycling, composting and con
sumer education.
"We have a curbside recycling
plan for the residents. The only
way recycling can work is if you
make it convenient for people
(to deposit their garbage). So we
go to their homes once a week to
collect it,"he said.
The waste is sorted out for re
turnable bottles and other reus
able materials. The remaining
waste is either recycled and sold
to secondary material markets,
or composted and sold as topsoil.
The consumer education
program emphasizes the term
"precycle," Wenzlau said. The
idea is to educate consumers to
shop for containers that can be
re-used, he explained.
"We put labels on shelves that
inform the consumer of the best
package from an environmental
standpoint," he said.
Stanford, too. is working to al
leviate its share of the waste
problem. Wenzlau said. The

Stanford Recycling Center has
placed bins around the campus
for the disposal of glass, metals
and paper.
A staff of 20 paid students
work in four-hour shifts, eight
hours a day, six days a week,
picking up the garbage and
transporting it back to the center
to be sorted out.
Kuty Swaim, one of the pro
ject managers at the center, also
emphasized the need for con
sumer education.
We're working on getting in
formation out to a lot of people,
she said. "They must be made
more aware of all the pos
sibilities for saving."
Swaim added that people must
know not to mix trash in the re
cycling bins, and also, should try
to buy aluminum cans or reusa
ble bottles instead of bi-metal
cans. Bi-metal cans cost more in
labor to collect than diey are
worth when resold, she said.
Although recycling reduces
some of the waste, the rest still
needs to be disposed of. One
possibility is resource recovery,
which entails burning solid waste
for energy use.
A study is being done by sev
eral cities in North Santa Clara
County about the economic and
environmental feasibility of a re
source recovery facility.
Mark Harris, general adminis
trator of the study, said the pro
ject has '"a lot of pitfalls." The
problems that have yet to be re
solved are air pollution, high
economic costs and siting, he
said.
"Even if everything went
smoothly, I couldn't see a facility
like this for at least six vcars." he
added.
In the meantime, more areas
for landfills are beint: sought, ac

cording to Wenzlau. Ox Moun
tain near Half Moon Bay, and
Hellyer Canyon in South County
are possible sites, he said.
"There's no magic answer.
We're just going to have to
tighten our belts. We're either
going to bury ourselves in it or
solve the problem," Wenzlau
said.
