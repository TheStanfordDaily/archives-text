# Native American program small but active
## 
### Jan Mireles Staff Writer 
Ujamaa, Okada, Zapata and
Roble are all dormitories with
something in common. Roble,
however, serves the native
American population in a unique
way.
Unlike the others, Roble is not
a theme house — it is a priority
house.
"One requirement for a
minority theme house is that you
have enough people to fill 50
percent of the house, and we
don't have a large enough
number of students," said Willie
Reid, one of the Roble native
American program assistants.
Unstable past
The native Americans have
had a somewhat unstable past
here. Their original theme house
was in Soto in Wilbur Hall.
When their numbers declined,
they were moved to Gavilan in
Florence Moore Hall.
In 1977 the native Americans
were no longer able to fulfill the
requirements to qualify for a
theme house. Then Roble be

came a priority house and the
native Americans began working
to keep their program active and
growing.
The task has not been an easy
one, according to Roble program
assistant Karen Atkinson.
"Program money is hard to
get. We have to go to outside
sources," she said.
Small numbers
Many of the problems the
native Americans face are re
lated to their small numbers.
Roble houses approximately 300
students, yet only 15 are native
Americans.
Various activities have been
scheduled within the house to
promote the Indian culture. For
example, films, a study break
featuring Indian fry bread and
freshmen orientation workshops
were a few of the projects com
pleted last quarter.

"We could do more if we had
more people," Atkinson said.
Closely affiliated with the
Roble program is the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
SAIO
SAIO originated from a Cul
tural Center Committee. Its con
stitution was officially accepted
in 1973. Prior to that time, the
native American Culture Center
served primarily as a meeting
place for native American stu
dents.
As SAIO developed, it be
came a resource center and now
provides students with informa
tion about different academic
programs.
SAIO is a volunteer organiza
tion run by a steering committee
whose members are selected
each quarter.
"Ideas for projects are pre

sented to the steering committee
and we try to put them into ac
tion," said committee member
Francis Robert.
SAIO is working on a recruit
ment bulletin under the direction
of administrative assistant Fat
French and Atkinson.
Organizational problems
Like any organization, SAIO
is not without its problems.
Size is a major disadvantage
"in that we're a smaller group so
we don't have the people in the
administration. Other groups
have separate individuals who
are specifically working on their
needs and developing programs
for them," Robert explained.
A difficulty unique to the na
tive Americans is the fact that
they must deal with a minority
within a minority. Although
there are many tribes of native
Americans, they are placed in
one category.
"Inner-tribal cultures make a
big difference in our ability to
functions as a unit," said David
Eisenberg, former SAIO presi

dent.
Eisenberg remembers when
SAIO was a more powerful or
ganization.
"There was a time when SAIO
was a viable organization. I
wouldn't say that anymore. Then
we had more interaction. There
was a feeling of camaraderie —
of purpose," Eisenberg said.
Eisenberg also cited reasons
for SAIO's decline in power.
"Now we have to rely on
people in the community to help
out. There aren't enough Indians
around in the general popula
tion. It's too much of a burden
for just a few to carry, he com
mented.
The feelings of closeness how
ever, have not disappeared com
pletely. Freshman Karen Cupp
said she views the Roble prog
ram and SAIO as a vital support.
"They help you along. They're
like your brothers and sisters. It's
like an extension of your family;
you need that sometimes," she
said.

Size is a major disadvantage
"in that we're a smaller group so
we don't have the people in the
administration. Other groups
have separate individuals who
are specifically working on their
needs and developing programs
for them," Robert explained.
A difficulty unique to the na
tive Americans is the fact that
they must deal with a minority
within a minority. Although
there are many tribes of native
Americans, they are placed in
one category.
"Inner-tribal cultures make a
big difference in our ability to
functions as a unit," said David
Eisenberg, former SAIO presi

dent.
Eisenberg remembers when
SAIO was a more powerful or
ganization.
"There was a time when SAIO
was a viable organization. I
wouldn't say that anymore. Then
we had more interaction. There
was a feeling of camaraderie —
of purpose," Eisenberg said.
Eisenberg also cited reasons
for SAIO's decline in power.
"Now we have to rely on
people in the community to help
out. There aren't enough Indians
around in the general popula
tion. It's too much of a burden
for just a few to carry, he com
mented.
The feelings of closeness how
ever, have not disappeared com
pletely. Freshman Karen Cupp
said she views the Roble prog
ram and SAIO as a vital support.
"They help you along. They're
like your brothers and sisters. It's
like an extension of your family;
you need that sometimes," she
said.

Ujamaa, Okada, Zapata and
Roble are all dormitories with
something in common. Roble,
however, serves the native
American population in a unique
way.
Unlike the others, Roble is not
a theme house — it is a priority
house.
"One requirement for a
minority theme house is that you
have enough people to fill 50
percent of the house, and we
don't have a large enough
number of students," said Willie
Reid, one of the Roble native
American program assistants.
Unstable past
The native Americans have
had a somewhat unstable past
here. Their original theme house
was in Soto in Wilbur Hall.
When their numbers declined,
they were moved to Gavilan in
Florence Moore Hall.
In 1977 the native Americans
were no longer able to fulfill the
requirements to qualify for a
theme house. Then Roble be

came a priority house and the
native Americans began working
to keep their program active and
growing.
The task has not been an easy
one, according to Roble program
assistant Karen Atkinson.
"Program money is hard to
get. We have to go to outside
sources," she said.
Small numbers
Many of the problems the
native Americans face are re
lated to their small numbers.
Roble houses approximately 300
students, yet only 15 are native
Americans.
Various activities have been
scheduled within the house to
promote the Indian culture. For
example, films, a study break
featuring Indian fry bread and
freshmen orientation workshops
were a few of the projects com
pleted last quarter.

"We could do more if we had
more people," Atkinson said.
Closely affiliated with the
Roble program is the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO).
SAIO
SAIO originated from a Cul
tural Center Committee. Its con
stitution was officially accepted
in 1973. Prior to that time, the
native American Culture Center
served primarily as a meeting
place for native American stu
dents.
As SAIO developed, it be
came a resource center and now
provides students with informa
tion about different academic
programs.
SAIO is a volunteer organiza
tion run by a steering committee
whose members are selected
each quarter.
"Ideas for projects are pre

sented to the steering committee
and we try to put them into ac
tion," said committee member
Francis Robert.
SAIO is working on a recruit
ment bulletin under the direction
of administrative assistant Fat
French and Atkinson.
Organizational problems
Like any organization, SAIO
is not without its problems.
Size is a major disadvantage
"in that we're a smaller group so
we don't have the people in the
administration. Other groups
have separate individuals who
are specifically working on their
needs and developing programs
for them," Robert explained.
