# Quake clinic helps shaken people

PLEASANTON, Calif. (AP)
â€” Some people were so shaken
up after the recent strong ear
thquakes here that they're at
tending an earthquake clinic to
help them get over their fears.
The group therapy session,
sponsored by the Valley Mental
Health Services in Pleasanton,
has helped out about 60 resi
dents since two strong temblors
shook the Livermore area in
three days.
The first one, measuring 5.5
on the Richter scale, rumbled
through hundreds of miles of
Northern California on Jan.
24. The second, measuring 5.K,
struck two days later. The epi
center of each was near the
Livermore area, which is located
about 35 miles east of San Fran
cisco.
Kathleen McGowan. director
of the clinic, says the purpose of
the sessions is to allow persons
strongly affected by earthquakes
to ventilate their feelings.
"When the earth moves,
people start questioning their
basic beliefs." McGowan said.
"They start asking what is real.
We're trying to get these people
before their trauma gets worse
and tell them that it's all right to
be afraid and talk about their
problems."

During one session, a young
woman held her throat and said
she hadn't been able to swallow
food since the last quake. Two
other women said they felt the
same way.
Others complained they we
ren't able to sleep, although they
had moved their beds into hall
ways and away from windows.
Another said she had to take
medication to get to sleep.
One woman said her curious
son had checked out books about
earthquakes from the public lib
rary, but she hasn't been able to
read them with him. She's think
ing about taking the books back.
Some people said they
couldn't bear to go into the same
room they were in when the
temblors struck. One woman
said she was in her office and
hasn't been able to go to work
since.
Another woman was depre
ssed because she had to keep
things packed in boxes.
"My house looks like I'm get
ting ready to move. Everything I
care about is shut up in boxes.
What's the use of having things if
you can't keep them out?" one
woman remarked.
Others even talked about
moving out of California.

Another woman said she was
more guilty than fearful. She said
that during one quake, she
pushed her children to the floor
of their home and rushed out the
door by herself.
"My first reaction was to save
my own neck,'" she said. I'm still
guilty about that."
