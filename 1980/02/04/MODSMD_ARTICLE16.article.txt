# Drought feared for New England area

CONCORD, N.H. (AP) â€” A
tickle winter that brought preci
ous little snow and spoiled the
fun for skiers may led to a serious
drought in northern New Eng
land this summer.
Federal and state officials are
preparing for the worst.
"There's no precedent for
this," says David Cass of New
Hampshire Civil Defense.
"We've never had a winter with
out snow before so it would be
foolish not to plan for the worst.
The problem is we really don't
know what the worst could be."
No one is panicking. But as
each day passes with little or no
snow, a growing number of
agencies are dusting off
emergency plans and designing
new ones.
The National Weather Ser
vice's monthly prediction for
northern New England in Feb
ruary shows slightly above aver
age precipitation is expected.

But even Joe McCall, the
weather bureau's chief
meteorologist, isn't overly op
timistic. "We've been expecting
it all winter and we haven't got
ten it yet," he said. "I can see no
reason for the emergency plan
ners to stop planning."
Dozens of people, mostly
employees of the U.S. Geologi
cal Survey, have been checking
water levels in New Hampshire,
Maine and Vermont.
John Cotton, a geological sur
vey hvdrologist, said a 30-day
survey released last week indi
cated one area with a water level
below average covering parts of
the three states.
"We've found below average
readings in a belt about 50 miles
wide starting in Vermont at Lake
Champlain, eastward through
Montpelier into Lancaster and
Berlin in New Hampshire and
then onto the Middle Dam area
of Maine," Cotton said.
