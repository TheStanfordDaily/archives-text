# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editor's perspective Good morning 
### 
Far from being just another Monday, today is
a special one lor those ol us at the Daily. 1 his
issue marks the beginning of another volume,
our 177 th.
Editors gene rail} begin their volumes with
ambitious plans and lotty goals lor the news
paper. More comprehensive news coverage, in
creased journalistic training and better com
munis relations are goals every editor I can
remember has set for his or her volume. It's
clear to me that those are ends worth pursuing.
A reorganized news office, combining the
former news and features departments should
provide the Daily with a more efficient news
gathering operation as well as the continuity
necessary to ensure that we are covering what
needs to be covered and that those articles are
appearing in their proper place in the news
paper.
The ingredients for better community rela
tions are as elusive as those of a perfect novel or
movie. An open door to the editor s office is
only one way of opening the channel ol com
munication between the Daily and those per
sons in the community who have something
they want to convey to the Daily. One other vvay
is for the editor to"seek out those persons who
he or she thinks might have something to offer
the Daily. I will trv both of these means.

Please consider this an open invitation to stop
by the Daily offices in the Storke building at
your convenience to talk with me about the
Daily's role in the Stanford community.
Finally, you may already have noticed that
the Daily looks much different today. We have
changed the typeface throughout the paper to
Times Roman. The chance was made tor
primarily asthetic reasons as were most of the
other style changes that have been made. 1 think
the new look will attract our readers to take a
closer look at the product you now hold in your
hands.
Our efforts are for nought if only a small
number of those who pick up a copy of the Daily
in the morning actually read what we print. I
hope v ou find the new sty le attractive and that it
lends you to read what both youand I hope to be
increasingly well-written and well-research ar
ticles.
We will do our best to provide you with the
finest product we can publish. If you want to
beeom : a part of the fine staff here and help us
serve the community while learning an invalu
able skill. 1 hope you will stop by the office at
any time. There's no shortage of work to be
done.
