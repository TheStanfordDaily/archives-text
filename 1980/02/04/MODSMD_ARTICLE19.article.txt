## Life is rarely ever fair 
### 
When 1 was nine or 10 1 used
to complain a lot. If my sister
received a bigger piece of cake
than I. I'd whine, "It's not fair!"
Likewise, any time circumstances
appeared to disfavor me over
someone or something else. I
adopted the same creed. It be
came a way of looking at the
world. A narrow way.
I think I've grown out of that
habit now . . . but maybe not.
Sometimes when life seems to
treat another person roughly,
when we hear of an accident or a
disaster, we all react with "It's
not lair!" (You say that is diffe
rent because it is not a selfish
concern and by now we are
aware that life isn't fair. Our pa
rents taught us tlu.t.)
What is fair? Why do we all. at
least when we're young, some
how believe that life ought to be
just, ought to bring what we ex
pect? How can we confront a
world that does not dole out
shares equally?
- "Fairness" is an ideal, a con
cept. that we all strive for in
many ways every day. We try to
do our part in keeping the house
clean: we take turns at stop
signs. . . . Our society is based on
the attempt to be fair.
Then is fairness voluntary?
Are there some who ignore the
ideal? In order to explain the
answers to these questions, it is
necessary to introduce another
concept: choice. <
Choice is our way of allowing
an individual to pursue his own
goals, to make his world as fair as
he is able. One way of looking at
our society, the United States, is
to view it as based upon the right
to choose, as long as it does not
interfere unduly with the choice
of others.
Why this long reflection, you
ask? All this babble is self
evident. We know that we live in
a free society. Yes. but do we all
take advantage of that freedom?
It seems that we ignore our

freedom until faced by a crisis
that threatens to constrict it. In
the wake of President Jimmy
Carter's State of the Union ad
dress. Americans have suddenly
realized that our society can and
will limit choice. We may not he
allowed to participate in the
Olympics: we may be required to
serve in the military.
Does society have the right to
narrow our choices? People have
debated this question ceaselessly
and haven't yet reached a con
sensus.
Perhaps a better question is
not whether society should or
can constrict us. but how can we
exercise choice in such a situa
tion? After all. challenging our
government's right to enlist us is
a bit like taunting "It's not fair!"
Few of us consider anyone else's
human rights unless their cause
affects us personally.
Human rights relates to
another issue: nevertheless, it
concerns our discussion of
choice. Even in societies that do
not purport freedom — human
rights — some choice still exists.
Choice has always existed,
everywhere. Sometimes it ap
pears not to because alternatives
might not be viable. But what we
must always remember is that no
person, no government, can con
strict someone to the point that
he cannot choose between lov ing
and hating, acting morally or
immorally . . . we choose life or
death. .. .
Deciding, choosing is an act in
itself; as long as wiir minds are
free to think we can have opin
ions. beliefs ... and we can voice
them here in the U.S. Maybe it is
time to do that now.
Accepting the inequality of
the circumstances is not the same
i as resigning ourselves to it.
Reading the newspapers in de
spair or planning to escape to
Canada on the next flight is
choosing — choosing to avoid
the issue rather than confront it.

If you oppose American in
volvement in the Middle East,
say it! Write to your con
gressman. the president, propose
alternatives to the draft. Follow
some of Carter's suggestions to
make us less dependent on oil:
walk, ride a bike, turn down the
heat.
Above all. don't resort to the
childhood adage. "It's not lair!"
Our parents were right. It isn't
fair.
Hut through exercising our
power of choice, we realize the
meaninglessness ol that expres
sion. Life can only be as fair as
we make it.

than I. I'd whine, "It's not fair!"
Likewise, any time circumstances
appeared to disfavor me over
someone or something else. I
adopted the same creed. It be
came a way of looking at the
world. A narrow way.
I think I've grown out of that
habit now . . . but maybe not.
Sometimes when life seems to
treat another person roughly,
when we hear of an accident or a
disaster, we all react with "It's
not lair!" (You say that is diffe
rent because it is not a selfish
concern and by now we are
aware that life isn't fair. Our pa
rents taught us tlu.t.)
What is fair? Why do we all. at
least when we're young, some
how believe that life ought to be
just, ought to bring what we ex
pect? How can we confront a
world that does not dole out
shares equally?
- "Fairness" is an ideal, a con
cept. that we all strive for in
many ways every day. We try to
do our part in keeping the house
clean: we take turns at stop
signs. . . . Our society is based on
the attempt to be fair.
Then is fairness voluntary?
Are there some who ignore the
ideal? In order to explain the
answers to these questions, it is
necessary to introduce another
concept: choice. <
Choice is our way of allowing
an individual to pursue his own
goals, to make his world as fair as
he is able. One way of looking at
our society, the United States, is
to view it as based upon the right
to choose, as long as it does not
interfere unduly with the choice
of others.
Why this long reflection, you
ask? All this babble is self
evident. We know that we live in
a free society. Yes. but do we all
take advantage of that freedom?
It seems that we ignore our

freedom until faced by a crisis
that threatens to constrict it. In
the wake of President Jimmy
Carter's State of the Union ad
dress. Americans have suddenly
realized that our society can and
will limit choice. We may not he
allowed to participate in the
Olympics: we may be required to
serve in the military.
Does society have the right to
narrow our choices? People have
debated this question ceaselessly
and haven't yet reached a con
sensus.
Perhaps a better question is
not whether society should or
can constrict us. but how can we
exercise choice in such a situa
tion? After all. challenging our
government's right to enlist us is
a bit like taunting "It's not fair!"
Few of us consider anyone else's
human rights unless their cause
affects us personally.
Human rights relates to
another issue: nevertheless, it
concerns our discussion of
choice. Even in societies that do
not purport freedom — human
rights — some choice still exists.
Choice has always existed,
everywhere. Sometimes it ap
pears not to because alternatives
might not be viable. But what we
must always remember is that no
person, no government, can con
strict someone to the point that
he cannot choose between lov ing
and hating, acting morally or
immorally . . . we choose life or
death. .. .
Deciding, choosing is an act in
itself; as long as wiir minds are
free to think we can have opin
ions. beliefs ... and we can voice
them here in the U.S. Maybe it is
time to do that now.
Accepting the inequality of
the circumstances is not the same
i as resigning ourselves to it.
Reading the newspapers in de
spair or planning to escape to
Canada on the next flight is
choosing — choosing to avoid
the issue rather than confront it.

If you oppose American in
volvement in the Middle East,
say it! Write to your con
gressman. the president, propose
alternatives to the draft. Follow
some of Carter's suggestions to
make us less dependent on oil:
walk, ride a bike, turn down the
heat.
Above all. don't resort to the
childhood adage. "It's not lair!"
Our parents were right. It isn't
fair.
Hut through exercising our
power of choice, we realize the
meaninglessness ol that expres
sion. Life can only be as fair as
we make it.
