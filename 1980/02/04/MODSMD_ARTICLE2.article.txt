### Jane West Staff Writer 
hred Hargadon. Dean ot Admis
sions, expressed strong opposition
Thursday night toany provision for col
lege determents it the draft is
reinstated.
Hargadon responded to questions
for 30 minutes on a variety of subjects
011 KZSI' s Campus Conference.
As well as being opposed to college
determents. Hargadon said women, if
the situation arises, should not he
dratted. "This does not mean I don't
think women are equal, but equal for
me means different things in different
situations." he >aid.
Hargadon also added that lie has
probably supported more conscienti
ous • tCO) than any other
dean ol udi ns"- ons I'm not a CO iny
self." he said. Hut I honor it. What I
don't believe in is irresponsibility when
one is not a CO."
Hargadon responded to the contents
ot a Ralph Nader study on the Educa
tional Testing Service (ETS). which
claimed in part that ETS tests exclude
minorities and perpetrate class distinc
tions. "I would say (the conclusions)
derive from ignorance. The tests don't
exclude anybody. ETS doesn't exclude
anybody. It's the colleges, not ETS.
that use the test scores."
In the May. article in Ladies
Home Journal (' that scholarly jour
nal. ' said Hargadon) Nader tound
"anecdotal evidence to support conclu
sions he had prior to even making the

study," Ilargadon said.
Commenting on the Lavelle hill, a
law passed recently in New York that
permits high school students to see the
correct responses to admissions tests.
Hargadon said he opposed the bill be
cause it is impractical and costly. •
New tests have to be constantly de
veloped, Hargadon said, and that pro
cess is not simply like "reaching into a
bag of questions. Each one must be
examined thoroughly."
Hargadon. who is chairman ot the
College Board of Trustees, added that
the College Board is looking into ways
to reveal test answers while maintain
ing security.
According to Hargadon. one ot the
ideas discussed was to keep a code
sheet in tiie testing 100 ms lor examina
tion after students took the test. The
sheet would not be allowed to leave the
testing rooms, however.
ITie reason why the University Ad
missions Office sent a memorandum to
10.0(10 secondary schools indicating a
concern for the weak strutcture of col
lege applicants' programs, was because
professors here "found* themselves
teaching juniors what should have been
taught in eleventh and twelfth grades,
Hargadon explained.
"We don't want people to be spend
ing money at college for something
they should have gotten in high
school." Hargadon said.
The memorandum, which has only
received two negative responses out of
7000, is now being used by many

people as a guideline to strengthening
their curriculum.
"When 1 receive a letter from a
sixth-grader asking what courses to
take in order to get into Stanford. 1 can
send him the memo," said Hargadon.
In a recent poll of college freshmen.
63 percent said that being well-off fi
nancial!) was one of their top goals.
Hargadon remarked that there has
been a shift in student attitude due to
the econonn. "In the '60s. it was one
thing to go to a rally decry capitalism
and then, go back to your Porsche, lis
ten to your stereo and get red) for the
rail) the next day. Now. students are
confronting a less generous economy. I
don't think they're materialistic:
tin \'re |ust more concerned with earn
ing a living arm supporting children in
good health "
Responding to the problem of rising
tuitions. Hargadon said that contrary
to expectations, the applicant pool is
larger than ever with approximate!)
12,500 applications this year, and the
percentage of financial aid has con
tinued to rise.
Hargadon also explained that the
essav question on the application was
changed because "we got tired ot read
ing answers to what students would
write a book about."
The application now consists of two
short questions: "What particular ad
jective would you select to describe
\ourself and why," and" What event or
person has most influenced you in vour
life?
