## The
						perilous pitfalls of passion 
### 
Have you noticed that people
have become quite passionate
lately? And I certainly don't
mean passionate in the amorous
sense.
Whether it's the ayatollah or
the shah, the Soviets or OPEC.
Big Business or Big Govern
ment. Americans seem eager to
direct their pent-up anger
against a variety of distant
enemies. In fact, we seem to be in
the middle of an absurd debate
over whom we should hate the
most. (1 try not to shudder at the
Orwellian overtones of such
madness.) We seem to have for
saken our reason for our passion.
Now let me sav that I hold no
thing against passion per sc —
some of life's greatest moments
embrace passion — but I am
wary of misguided passion that
smothers reason. The virtue in
human passion flows from a
flaming heart and a cool head:
the subversion of human passion
radiates from a hot head sup
ported bv a red neck.

I find it disturbing that our tear
and anger are so aroused at a
time when we face decisions that
require calm, clear thinking.
Soon we must cast our votes for
the next president of the United
States in an election already
mired by political white lies and
covered In irresponsible yellow
press. Many of us may even be
forced to decide whether or not
we will register for the military
draft, a rather sobering proposi
tion for any young man or wo
man. Such crucial decisions,
where delineations between
good and bad. or l ight and wrong
are at best fuzzy, demand the
careful consideration born of
patience and prudence.
I ickle emotion has no place in
this process. I distrust those in
otir government who would
wave a sword as a means of per
suasion; such angry displays of
passion can only cloud our vision
and clutter our minds.
But it is not enough to control
one's passion in the face of ad
versity. If the ability to make ra

tional decisions is characteristic
of being human, then assuming
responsibility for those decisions
is characteristic of being
humane. And when we assume
responsibility for our own deci
sions. we tend to see things more
clearly. It becomes much more
difficult to blame a Russian or an
Arab for our own predicament
and much easier to blame ourse
lves for our flamboyantly waste
ful lifestyles. Our distant enemy
becomes a familiar friend.
On a personal level. 1 find this
to be a much more positive way
of viewing my own situation.
After all, there is little 1 can (or
care to) do to change the lives of
people who live halfway around
the globe. However, 1 can (and
must) alter my own behavior. I
can reduce my depended :y on oil
from countries halfway around
the globe simply by driving less.
Given today's price of gas, it lit
erally pays for me to abandon my
old wasteful habits of consump
tion.
Viewed in this light, conserva

lion becomes the most reasona
ble and immediate personal re
sponse to the present political/
economic situation. I or the indi
vidual, and for the nation as a
whole, conservation pays oft.
Conservation should not be an
inconvenience, but rather a wel
come challenge, especially when
compared to the grim alterna
tives. We should channel our
passion away from the grim al
ternatives and toward more
reasonable pursuits.
Ultimately, all logical argu
ments must be reduced to a very
personal level. To survive this
crisis — whether real or im
agined — we must slow down,
calm down and think for ourse
lves. Each crucial decision must
rest on a foundation of sound
conviction.
Though passion may provide
us with the strength and courage
to maintain our convictions, they
must be convictions forged in the
light of reason.
