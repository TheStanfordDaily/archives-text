# Bill 'Early Date' Kemmeries
## 4 easy steps to cure 'Professor Possession' 
### 
It was an important moment in the un
important life of Bill Kemmeries — I
needed some great reeommendations to
have an\ hope for law school, and was in
my ad\ iser's office.
I was a little scared when I asked in a
quivering voice, "Professor, sir. what are
my chances of getting into law school?"
He looked me straight in the eyes and
said sympathetically. "Well. Bob. we'll
just have to see."
Bob! I started sweating uncontrollably,
my body began to shake, and I started
talking like my two-year-old cousin. It
was then I realized that 1 was suffering
from "Professor Possession" (a fancy
psychological term for complete helpless
ness and fear when in the presence of an
ad\ iser or professor).
This sickness usually affects college
age students (although it can also occur in
T.A.s and untenured professors). and can
be found in every academic department at
Stanford. What causes this dreaded dis
ease? Simply the fact that the people we
call "professors" have complete control
over a student's life — whether he gets a
job or not. whether he goes to graduate
school or not. whether he will be at Stan
ford four years or five years.
And that's why you sometimes see a
student nervously crying and talking to his
notebooks as he leaves a professor's room
— the dude is totally helpless to the power
of the grade and the power of the recom
mendation.
Is there any way to cure Professor Pos
session-? As a matter of fact ! have re
ceived a lot of letters from all of my fans
about this disease, and both of them asked
me if I would publish the cure to the other

students. Well, lucky for you 88-brains.
in spite of the fact that all you do is use me,
I've come up with some styles and
techniques that will help you not "tinkle"
every time you talk to your professors
about grades and recommendations.
Now the only way to overcome Profes
sor Possession is by making the prof, think
that you are "something special." You've
got to impress him into thinking you are
smart, witty, personable, and that you are
genuinely interested in him. In other
words. Snow-Job. Brown-Nose, whatever
you want to call it. you gotta do it! Here
are four steps to reach that "something
special" plateau:
1 ) "Mission Impossible Index Cards":
What you do is make a whole box-full of
index cards (like those on "Mission Im
possible") giving you every litt! * fact
about the professors in the department of
your major. These cards should include
personal facts, hobbies, interests, and
should be studied thoroughly. Your con
versations with him will be a breeze! For
example, you can ask your prof, about his
children, and if you are talking to a His
tory prof, you can ask him about his
grandchildren. There are. however, two
things you should remember — a )Always
Keep Your Cards In Order!! I remember
last fall talking about the "hard-hitting
bats of Pittsburgh" to a professor who I
thought was a baseball nut, but in fact was
a nature enthusiast. All he could think
about were thousands of retarded bats
crashing and caromming off the skyscrap
ers of Pittsburgh. I didn't get into Chieo
State Law School because of him. b) Also,
always remember never to talk to your
professor about his physical appearance.
The card says your prof, wears ugly shoes.

fine. You don't have to ask him, "Hey,
where did you find those I lush Puppies?"
Don't bring that stuff up. L ast year a good
friend of mine wrecked a great conversa
tion he was having with his adviser when
he blurted out, "Hey dude, who cut your
hair?" No Can Do!! Ask my buddy, he
works at the San Jose swap meet.
2 )"Clothes Make the Man" Technique:
Your personal appearance, however, is
crucial. You've got to look smart to be
smart. For example, girls, don't go to see
your professor wearing a T-shirt that has
"Foxy Lady" or "I am a virgin — but this
is a very old shirt" or "Baby Under Con
struction" written on it. Wrongo Betty
Boop! You should wear a nice dress or a
pantsuit and jacket. And guys, don't go
see your professors wearing pants so tight
you can't even breathe. You think those
old guys want to see that? Not true.
Do-do Face. Get smart, dress smart!
3) "What He Wants to Hear" Style:
When you are talking to your professor it
is of A-l importance that you tell him
what he wants to hear. LIE! 8.5.! For
example, if your adviser asks you, "What
do you hope most to accomplish here at
Stanford?", don't say something like. "I
want to go all the way with my girlfriend/
boyfriend."LlE! 8.5.! When he asks what
your main goal is, tell him instead some
thing like, "I want to achieve the
academic objectives that will propel me
on to a successful career and well
rounded life." You must impress him.
4) Graduation Picture Technique: Fi
nally, give your adviser your graduation
picture, or some other picture in which
you are wearing something nice. Your
professor has got hundreds of faces to

remember. I low is he going to know your
boring face? One tiling to note here —
don'tcrcr write on the back of * he picture!
1 know it's customary when you exchange
senior pictures to write something, but it
serves no purpose. Lust quarter a friend of
mine gave a professor a picture and
absent-mindedly wrote on the back,
"Dear Prof., we had some good times to
gether. huh? You are one of the coolest
dudes I know, and I hope to see you this
summer. Your bro', Johnny Nogoclass."
Johnny had to switch advisers in his senior
year.
These are the major curcs for Professor
Possession, and I hope that they will help
you this year. II you follow all four of
these steps you should have no trouble
getting a good recommendation in your
senior year, and in fact no problem at all
when you talk to your professors about
grades. If you have any problems with the
latter, however, please write to me and I'll
tell you how to cheat.
Personally, I think the best thing would
be to set up a "Sol I-Advising/Grading
Program" here at Stanford.
You think those professors love to
grade your papers and write hundreds < >
recommendations? Think again, Gomel .
What we should do is eliminate that func
tion from the professors and give it to the
students themselves.
Sure, we might become a little grade
inflated, but at least everyone would get
into the graduate school they wanted to,
everyone would be a lot happier, and
there would be a heck of a lot less "tinkl
ing" going on around here.

friend of mine wrecked a great conversa
tion he was having with his adviser when
he blurted out, "Hey dude, who cut your
hair?" No Can Do!! Ask my buddy, he
works at the San Jose swap meet.
2 )"Clothes Make the Man" Technique:
Your personal appearance, however, is
crucial. You've got to look smart to be
smart. For example, girls, don't go to see
your professor wearing a T-shirt that has
"Foxy Lady" or "I am a virgin — but this
is a very old shirt" or "Baby Under Con
struction" written on it. Wrongo Betty
Boop! You should wear a nice dress or a
pantsuit and jacket. And guys, don't go
see your professors wearing pants so tight
you can't even breathe. You think those
old guys want to see that? Not true.
Do-do Face. Get smart, dress smart!
3) "What He Wants to Hear" Style:
When you are talking to your professor it
is of A-l importance that you tell him
what he wants to hear. LIE! 8.5.! For
example, if your adviser asks you, "What
do you hope most to accomplish here at
Stanford?", don't say something like. "I
want to go all the way with my girlfriend/
boyfriend."LlE! 8.5.! When he asks what
your main goal is, tell him instead some
thing like, "I want to achieve the
academic objectives that will propel me
on to a successful career and well
rounded life." You must impress him.
4) Graduation Picture Technique: Fi
nally, give your adviser your graduation
picture, or some other picture in which
you are wearing something nice. Your
professor has got hundreds of faces to

remember. I low is he going to know your
boring face? One tiling to note here —
don'tcrcr write on the back of * he picture!
1 know it's customary when you exchange
senior pictures to write something, but it
serves no purpose. Lust quarter a friend of
mine gave a professor a picture and
absent-mindedly wrote on the back,
"Dear Prof., we had some good times to
gether. huh? You are one of the coolest
dudes I know, and I hope to see you this
summer. Your bro', Johnny Nogoclass."
Johnny had to switch advisers in his senior
year.
These are the major curcs for Professor
Possession, and I hope that they will help
you this year. II you follow all four of
these steps you should have no trouble
getting a good recommendation in your
senior year, and in fact no problem at all
when you talk to your professors about
grades. If you have any problems with the
latter, however, please write to me and I'll
tell you how to cheat.
Personally, I think the best thing would
be to set up a "Sol I-Advising/Grading
Program" here at Stanford.
You think those professors love to
grade your papers and write hundreds < >
recommendations? Think again, Gomel .
What we should do is eliminate that func
tion from the professors and give it to the
students themselves.
Sure, we might become a little grade
inflated, but at least everyone would get
into the graduate school they wanted to,
everyone would be a lot happier, and
there would be a heck of a lot less "tinkl
ing" going on around here.
(Hill Kemmeries is not playing with a full
deck. His column appears every three
weeks.)
It was an important moment in the un
important life of Bill Kemmeries — I
needed some great reeommendations to
have an\ hope for law school, and was in
my ad\ iser's office.
I was a little scared when I asked in a
quivering voice, "Professor, sir. what are
my chances of getting into law school?"
He looked me straight in the eyes and
said sympathetically. "Well. Bob. we'll
just have to see."
Bob! I started sweating uncontrollably,
my body began to shake, and I started
talking like my two-year-old cousin. It
was then I realized that 1 was suffering
from "Professor Possession" (a fancy
psychological term for complete helpless
ness and fear when in the presence of an
ad\ iser or professor).
This sickness usually affects college
age students (although it can also occur in
T.A.s and untenured professors). and can
be found in every academic department at
Stanford. What causes this dreaded dis
ease? Simply the fact that the people we
call "professors" have complete control
over a student's life — whether he gets a
job or not. whether he goes to graduate
school or not. whether he will be at Stan
ford four years or five years.
And that's why you sometimes see a
student nervously crying and talking to his
notebooks as he leaves a professor's room
— the dude is totally helpless to the power
of the grade and the power of the recom
mendation.
Is there any way to cure Professor Pos
session-? As a matter of fact ! have re
ceived a lot of letters from all of my fans
about this disease, and both of them asked
me if I would publish the cure to the other

students. Well, lucky for you 88-brains.
in spite of the fact that all you do is use me,
I've come up with some styles and
techniques that will help you not "tinkle"
every time you talk to your professors
about grades and recommendations.
Now the only way to overcome Profes
sor Possession is by making the prof, think
that you are "something special." You've
got to impress him into thinking you are
smart, witty, personable, and that you are
genuinely interested in him. In other
words. Snow-Job. Brown-Nose, whatever
you want to call it. you gotta do it! Here
are four steps to reach that "something
special" plateau:
1 ) "Mission Impossible Index Cards":
What you do is make a whole box-full of
index cards (like those on "Mission Im
possible") giving you every litt! * fact
about the professors in the department of
your major. These cards should include
personal facts, hobbies, interests, and
should be studied thoroughly. Your con
versations with him will be a breeze! For
example, you can ask your prof, about his
children, and if you are talking to a His
tory prof, you can ask him about his
grandchildren. There are. however, two
things you should remember — a )Always
Keep Your Cards In Order!! I remember
last fall talking about the "hard-hitting
bats of Pittsburgh" to a professor who I
thought was a baseball nut, but in fact was
a nature enthusiast. All he could think
about were thousands of retarded bats
crashing and caromming off the skyscrap
ers of Pittsburgh. I didn't get into Chieo
State Law School because of him. b) Also,
always remember never to talk to your
professor about his physical appearance.
The card says your prof, wears ugly shoes.

fine. You don't have to ask him, "Hey,
where did you find those I lush Puppies?"
