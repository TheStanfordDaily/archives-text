Bikers beware
Know how irritated you get
when thoughtless motorists park
their sedans smack in the middle
of your hike path?
Take a look at the entrance of
the new Green Library. The
ramp there was built to provide
wheelchair access, not private
parking.
Of course we're all busy, but
thoughtfulness takes incredibly
little time. (Unless, of course,
one is a slow thinker.. . .)

Diplomatie immunity
I regret that Hamad Al-Baadi
(" Misunderstanding prompted
attacks," Daily Jan. 25) still
seeks to obscure and confuse the

issue in the seizure of the Ameri
can Embassy in Tehran. To re
peat. the Iranians are in violation
of international law on diploma
tic immunity, as an examination
of any collection of volumes on
international law will show.
I quoted the Vienna Conven
tion because it in effect codified
already existing law in precise
and explicit language. I do not
know whether Iran —or the Un
ited States for that matter —
ratified the Convention, but that
docs not change anything.
Secondly. I was aware that the
Vienna Convention imposed
limitations on diplomats, as does
international law before it, but
these limitations do not give the
host country any right to seize an
embassy or its diplomatic rep
resentatives, or to ransack em
bassy files.
The only recourse, as I said in

my picce. is to declare a diplomat
"persona non grata" and thereby
require him or her to leave the
country.

Erase stereotypes
I was quite insulted, if not sur
prised. by Lisa Catanzarite's as
sertion at Monday's anti-draft
rally that men are characteristi
cally violent.
Although unfortunately it is
not unusual to hear the most
blatant sexist remarks prop
ounded by so-called feminists —
I use the word "so-called" be
cause I believe a true feminist
would believe in. and realize the
necessity of, eradicating both
male and female stereotypes
from our society — it still hurt to
hear my brethren and myself de

scribed as violent.
Catanzarite's prefatory dis
claimer that she was only going
to discuss the "good" traits of
women and the "bad" traits of
men did not excuse her remarks.
She should realize all too well, as
one concerned with women tak
ing their rightful equal position
in our society, the damage that
sexual stereotypes cause, dis

claimers notwithstanding.
I feel that Catanzarite owes
me and all the men who heard
her remarks, or read them in the
Daily, an apology. If she does not
wish to apologize, she at least
oA'es us an explanation for her
comments.
I await her reply.
