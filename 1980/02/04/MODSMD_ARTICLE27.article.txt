# Students, faculty criticize lack of Arab- related studies here
## 
### Lisa Adler Staff Writer 
A noticeable lack of courses
and opportunities for in-depth
study in Arab-related areas at
the University has been
criticized by both faculty and
students here who feel there is
sufficient need and interest for a
more substantial Middle East
program.
The absence of courses is
rooted in the 19605. Accor
ding to Robert Ward, director ol
the Center lor International Re
lations here, when the Ford
Foundation took an interest in
international studies and gave
out funds, there simply was not
enough interest here in the Mid
dle East.
"Since the University made
that decision to place the Middle
East low 011 the priority list 10 or
15 years ago, an increase of in
terest now can hardly compen
sate for the lack of interest
then," said Michel Nabti, a Mid
tile East specialist who worked
for the Hoover Institute for 15
years.
Nabti called the absence of
Arab-related courses here
"ironic" because of the impor
tance ol the Middle East today in
terms of geopolitics, strategy and
mainly petroleum.

Also, Nabti sees irony in the
fact that the Hoover Institute
possesses a prolific collection of
scholarly works on the Middle
East, hut the University has few
courses in that area.
"Hoover has worked very
hard during the past 30 years try
ing to establish an impressive col
lection on the modern Middle
East. Now. we have one of the
richest collections in North
America of documents, periodi
cals, rare books and well-known
works.
"Unfortunately, the Univer
sity has not matched Hoover's
efforts academically," Nabti
said.
According to Nabti and other
University officials, people are
coming here from across the
country and maybe the world to
use Hoover's resources. How
ever. students who are interested
in studying the Middle East have
been forced to look elsewhere
for courses or to transfer.
Herant Katchadourian, dean
of undergraduate studies,
suggested a possible explana
tion. "I suspect that Stanford
does not try to do everything. In
fact, we do some things well and
some areas little or not at all," he
said.
"While Berkeley has a strong
Middle Eastern studies prog

ram," Katchadourian continued,
"we are very strong in Afro-
Atnerican. Latin American,
Eastern European and Far East
ern studies."
Provost Donald Kennedy cal
led the situation an "historic ac
cident" because interest simply
wasn't here at the right time.
Also, the number of specialists
here with expertise in the Middle
East is not substantial.
Specialists are concentrated in
relatively few places, including
University of Pennsylvania,
Michigan, UC-Berkeley and
other schools. But not Stanford.
"One can hardly ignore the
importance of the Middle East
and the richness of its traditions,
but a Middle East concentration
hasn't developed here," con
cluded Kennedy.
Financial problem
Part of the problem is fi
nances.
"The University is going
through hard times. We have re
cently poured money into much
needed maintenance projects. It
would cost $14 million to
establish a chair in the Middle
East. That kind of money is not
easy to come by," said Ward.
It is possible that someone
would donate money to establish
a chair. However, certain condi
tions would have to he attached

to a financial contribution from
either a country or a person.
Wayne Vucinich, professor
emeritus of history, said he
would like to see a "modest
program" here in Arabic lan
guage and Moslem history and
civilization.
Vucinich acknowledged that
there are financial limitations,
and that it would not be right to
accept money with conditions
and political restrictions.
"The University must have a
say w here money is donated for a
chair. We cannot jeopardize the
University and must act in ac
cordance with the high principles
Stanford promotes," Vucinich

concluded.
Nabti said the problem is not
totally financial. "There has
been no effort to coordinate the
talents available on campus with
minimum expenditure of
money," he said.
"There is no doubt that the
Middle East is important. We
pick up newspapers every day
that contain articles on the Mid
dle East. Understanding the
peoples and the cultures requires
honest, serious historical insights
which cannot be obtained from
reading the Chronicle, Nabti
said.
"Especially in a part of the
world where the U.S. policies

lack drastically in credibility and
depth — the Middle East — one
'vouiii think that educational
centers would become responsi
ble.
"The more brilliant centers
like Stanford need to meet the
challenge and educate its stu
dents in the Middle East," Nabti
continued.
Most University officials ad
mitted that there are not many
courses being offered now.
Larry Berman, professor of re
ligious studies, currently teaches
a course entitled, "Islam." in
which he is trying to describe the
"salient features of the de
velopment of Islam."

An elementary Arabic course
is also being taught through the
special languages section of the
linguistics department.
Clara Bush, linguistics profes
sor here, has recommended that
the University hire a part-time
instructor in Arabic and Heb
rew.
"In general. I think Stanford
should expand its courses in
Arab studies, Islam and other re
lated fields," Berman said.
According to Ward, speakers
on Arab-related topics have
been brought in from outside the
University in an effort to com
pensate for the lack of courses.
