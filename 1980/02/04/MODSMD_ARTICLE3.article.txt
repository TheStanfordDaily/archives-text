# Panel calls for tight money policy
## 
### Todd Pickett Staff Writer 
"Good economics is bad politics and
vice versa." This cliche uttered by
Economics Prof. Robert Hall was
echoed more than once by a panel of
experts during a symposium on infla
tion and unemployment at Annenburg
Auditorium last Thursday night.
Appearing along with Hall were:
(i.l . Bach, a professor at the Business
School. Economics I'rot. Michael Bos
kin and Joe Bisignano. the director of
research at the Federal Reserve in San
Francisco.
1 he speakers, each lecturing in turn,
found little to debate over, concurring
that, in the words of Boskin . "We
must take a longer term view of
economic policy and resist tinkering
with the economy from quarter to

quarter.'
All tour lecturers advocated a policy
involving a tighter flow ot Federal Re
serve funds into the gov eminent, while
encouraging the American people to
endure a temporary slowdown in wage
increases.
Bach pointed to a trend of growing
distrust on the part of the American
people concerning the government's
ability to control inflation, thus causing
Americans to feel they must "get ahead
ol inflation" through increases in
wages and government transfer pay
ments.
Boskin. now in his eighth year here,
accused President Jimmy Carter ol
misjudging the current economic situa
tion. citing the president's State of the
Union comment that, "the single most
important factor in the acceleration ot

inflation is the OPEC price increase."
Estimating that OPEC was only re
sponsible for three to four percent ot
the current inflationary figure. Boskin
suggested that the major cause of infla
tion was "the enormously expanding
fiscal policy and its absorption by the
Federal Reserve.'" By means of tight
ening the money flow, an annual in
flationary decrease of two to three per
cent was seen by Boskin as a "sensible
goal, in spite of its possible effects on
unemployment.
"We must learn that a modest rise in
unemployment is best to be left alone."
Boskins said, so as to avoid the influx ot
inflation-cuasing Federal Reserve
funds.
