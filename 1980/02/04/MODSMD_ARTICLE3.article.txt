# Panel calls for tight money policy
## 
### Todd Pickett Staff Writer 
"Good economics is bad politics and
vice versa." This cliche uttered by
Economics Prof. Robert Hall was
echoed more than once by a panel of
experts during a symposium on infla
tion and unemployment at Annenburg
Auditorium last Thursday night.
Appearing along with Hall were:
(i.l . Bach, a professor at the Business
School. Economics I'rot. Michael Bos
kin and Joe Bisignano. the director of
research at the Federal Reserve in San
Francisco.
1 he speakers, each lecturing in turn,
found little to debate over, concurring
that, in the words of Boskin . "We
must take a longer term view of
economic policy and resist tinkering
with the economy from quarter to

quarter.'
All tour lecturers advocated a policy
involving a tighter flow ot Federal Re
serve funds into the gov eminent, while
encouraging the American people to
endure a temporary slowdown in wage
increases.
Bach pointed to a trend of growing
distrust on the part of the American
people concerning the government's
ability to control inflation, thus causing
Americans to feel they must "get ahead
ol inflation" through increases in
wages and government transfer pay
ments.
Boskin. now in his eighth year here,
accused President Jimmy Carter ol
misjudging the current economic situa
tion. citing the president's State of the
Union comment that, "the single most
important factor in the acceleration ot

inflation is the OPEC price increase."
Estimating that OPEC was only re
sponsible for three to four percent ot
the current inflationary figure. Boskin
suggested that the major cause of infla
tion was "the enormously expanding
fiscal policy and its absorption by the
Federal Reserve.'" By means of tight
ening the money flow, an annual in
flationary decrease of two to three per
cent was seen by Boskin as a "sensible
goal, in spite of its possible effects on
unemployment.
"We must learn that a modest rise in
unemployment is best to be left alone."
Boskins said, so as to avoid the influx ot
inflation-cuasing Federal Reserve
funds.
With the post-war "baby boom's"
babies now entering the job market
and the ever-increasing number of
working women, Boskin said he be
lieves any efforts to substantially de
crease unemployment to be limited.
Additionally, he suggested that the
current unemployment figures could
be misleading, in that those listed as
unemployed are merely temporarily
laid off due to, among other things, a
largely mobile population.
Calling Carter's voluntary wage and
price controls "a joke," Boskin saw
outright controls only working tem
porarily and favored gradual deregula
tions. The economist also blamed
former President Richard Nixon's
price controls for one to I'/: percent of
the current rate of inflation.
More concerned with the United
States' energy policy. Hall viewed the
best policy as none at all. "OPEC will
continue to raise prices no matter what
the government does" stated Hall. The
only policy Hall advocated was that of
charging world oil prices to American
consumers.
Hall viewed the ultimate "night
mare" as a cut off of Saudi Arabian oil,
currently one-fourth of the world's oil
supply. "1 don't know how we'd ac
commodate a shock like that.
Washington would only compound the
problem if they did something."
Having predicted a recession early
last year to hit the American economy
in late 1979, Hall is still not optimistic
about 1980 despite no signs of a reces
sion.
The ASSU Speakers Bureau, the
sponsors of the symposium, will be con
tinuing their series next Thursday night
when Dr. Anne Saldrich of the Hoover
Institution will speak on "Electric
Democracy — Politics and the Media."
Possible speakers as yet unscheduled
include former President Gerald Ford,
Ralph Nader, Andrew Young and
Henry Kissinger.

tion was "the enormously expanding
fiscal policy and its absorption by the
Federal Reserve.'" By means of tight
ening the money flow, an annual in
flationary decrease of two to three per
cent was seen by Boskin as a "sensible
goal, in spite of its possible effects on
unemployment.
"We must learn that a modest rise in
unemployment is best to be left alone."
Boskins said, so as to avoid the influx ot
inflation-cuasing Federal Reserve
funds.
With the post-war "baby boom's"
babies now entering the job market
and the ever-increasing number of
working women, Boskin said he be
lieves any efforts to substantially de
crease unemployment to be limited.
Additionally, he suggested that the
current unemployment figures could
be misleading, in that those listed as
unemployed are merely temporarily
laid off due to, among other things, a
largely mobile population.
Calling Carter's voluntary wage and
price controls "a joke," Boskin saw
outright controls only working tem
porarily and favored gradual deregula
tions. The economist also blamed
former President Richard Nixon's
price controls for one to I'/: percent of
the current rate of inflation.
More concerned with the United
States' energy policy. Hall viewed the
best policy as none at all. "OPEC will
continue to raise prices no matter what
the government does" stated Hall. The
only policy Hall advocated was that of
charging world oil prices to American
consumers.
Hall viewed the ultimate "night
mare" as a cut off of Saudi Arabian oil,
currently one-fourth of the world's oil
supply. "1 don't know how we'd ac
commodate a shock like that.
Washington would only compound the
problem if they did something."
Having predicted a recession early
last year to hit the American economy
in late 1979, Hall is still not optimistic
about 1980 despite no signs of a reces
sion.
