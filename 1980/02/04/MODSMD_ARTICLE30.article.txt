It was swimming at its prover
bial best and most spectacular —
a weekend that ranks as one of
Cardinal swimming's best. It was
a weekend to shatter records, to
dazzle spectators, to reconfirm
hopes and to establish dreams, as
the Card women slaughtered the
Texas Longhorns while the men
dropped a dogfight to the
Arizona Wildcats.
The women dunked the Te
xans from the opening moments
of their Saturday afternoon
competition and never allowed
them up for air, stunning their
formidable opponents 73-40.
"For us, it was a tremendous
meet." summed up Card coach
Claudia Thomas. "I was sur
prised. 1 thought they would be
better."
Yet. the Texans, coming off a
close loss (to last year's No. 1
team, Florida, and an equally
narrow victory over former No. 2
Arizona State, were far from
shabby. The Cards were just
clearly superior.
"We killed them on the first
relay, and we were on our way."
said co-captain Zena Herrmann.
Indeed, as the strains of the
Band's rousing acceppella rendi
tion of the national anthem sub
sided, the 400 yard medley relay
team of Linda Jezek, Patty
Spees. Libby Beaudet and Kelly
Asplund won in a pool record
3:47.22, a mere .4 of a second off
the national record, to set the
tone
After a four-day rest period,
the Cards were ready tf> blaze
ahead. '"We were so psyched all
week." Herrmann claimed.
"Everyone expected good times,
and they were there."
Jezek clocked the fastest time
in the nation this year by swim
ming away with the 200
backstroke (2:00.45) for but one

highlight amid a plethora of per
sonal and pool marks.
Janet Buchan truly wrestled
the Texans to the ground, re
cording three personal bests and
a pool record in the 1000 frees
tyle (9:54.23), the 500 free
(4:53.60)and the 200 individual
medley (2:03.81). Buchan bat
tled Texas star Kim Black, hol
der of the fastest 1000 time of
the year, in both distance events,
being nipped at the wall by
Black's strong 1000 finish but
prevailing in the 500.
Like Buchan, Marie Pease
swam three excruciately de
manding events in personal best
times to meet AIAW qualifying
standards: 1000 free (9:59.64).
200 butterfly (2:04.39) and 500
free (4:55.70). Pease, in fact,
churned out her fastest 500 time
on the way in the 1000, only to
break that mark an hour later in
the actual 500.
Herrmann notched two per
sonal records and national qual
ifying times herself, with an as
tounding 1:51.81 second-place
in the 200 free and a Longhorn
pressing 2:05.24. amongst an
impressive array of talent in the

200 back.
Kelly Asplund. Barbara
Major and Carol Procter kept
pace with " water-speed"
record-holder Jill Sterkel of
Texas in the sprints, as all qual
ified for A 1 AW nationals in both
the 50 and the 100 frees. Major
churned to her best time and a
pool record in the 100 with a
51.53 victory.
"One of the highlights for
me," confessed Thomas, "was to
see Laura Raymond, who has
not been at her best in 1 Vi years,
meet two standards and be back
in there. To me, that's really ex
citing." Co-captain Raymond
placed third in the 200 free in
1.52.72 and turned in a 52.87
swimming unofficially in the 100
free to meet national requisites
in those events.
Beaudet. recuperating from
illness, was nicked by Sterkel's
pool record (2:03.19) in the 200
butterfly to chop to a 2:03.90
second. Her 100 fly split of 56.0
on the 400 medley relay was bet
ter than her best time last season.

"We swam so great, but still

team's heartrending 65-59 loss
to Arizona at dcGuerrc Friday
afternoon. The match was ex
tended down to the wire and de

The Cards, nevertheless, dis

NCAA qualifying standard by

second-best mark in that event
nationally so far this year.
John Simons swam to one of

Mike Anderson shocked

in the top 10 of the NCAA.
It was swimming at its prover
bial best and most spectacular —
a weekend that ranks as one of
Cardinal swimming's best. It was
a weekend to shatter records, to
dazzle spectators, to reconfirm
hopes and to establish dreams, as
the Card women slaughtered the
Texas Longhorns while the men
dropped a dogfight to the
Arizona Wildcats.
The women dunked the Te
xans from the opening moments
of their Saturday afternoon
competition and never allowed
them up for air, stunning their
formidable opponents 73-40.
"For us, it was a tremendous
meet." summed up Card coach
Claudia Thomas. "I was sur
prised. 1 thought they would be
better."
Yet. the Texans, coming off a
close loss (to last year's No. 1
team, Florida, and an equally
narrow victory over former No. 2
Arizona State, were far from
shabby. The Cards were just
clearly superior.
"We killed them on the first
relay, and we were on our way."
said co-captain Zena Herrmann.
Indeed, as the strains of the
Band's rousing acceppella rendi
tion of the national anthem sub
sided, the 400 yard medley relay
team of Linda Jezek, Patty
Spees. Libby Beaudet and Kelly
Asplund won in a pool record
3:47.22, a mere .4 of a second off
the national record, to set the
tone
After a four-day rest period,
the Cards were ready tf> blaze
ahead. '"We were so psyched all
week." Herrmann claimed.
"Everyone expected good times,
and they were there."
Jezek clocked the fastest time
in the nation this year by swim
ming away with the 200
backstroke (2:00.45) for but one

highlight amid a plethora of per
sonal and pool marks.
Janet Buchan truly wrestled
the Texans to the ground, re
cording three personal bests and
a pool record in the 1000 frees
tyle (9:54.23), the 500 free
(4:53.60)and the 200 individual
medley (2:03.81). Buchan bat
tled Texas star Kim Black, hol
der of the fastest 1000 time of
the year, in both distance events,
being nipped at the wall by
Black's strong 1000 finish but
prevailing in the 500.
Like Buchan, Marie Pease
swam three excruciately de
manding events in personal best
times to meet AIAW qualifying
standards: 1000 free (9:59.64).
200 butterfly (2:04.39) and 500
free (4:55.70). Pease, in fact,
churned out her fastest 500 time
on the way in the 1000, only to
break that mark an hour later in
the actual 500.
Herrmann notched two per
sonal records and national qual
ifying times herself, with an as
tounding 1:51.81 second-place
in the 200 free and a Longhorn
pressing 2:05.24. amongst an
impressive array of talent in the

200 back.
Kelly Asplund. Barbara
Major and Carol Procter kept
pace with " water-speed"
record-holder Jill Sterkel of
Texas in the sprints, as all qual
ified for A 1 AW nationals in both
the 50 and the 100 frees. Major
churned to her best time and a
pool record in the 100 with a
51.53 victory.
"One of the highlights for
me," confessed Thomas, "was to
see Laura Raymond, who has
not been at her best in 1 Vi years,
meet two standards and be back
in there. To me, that's really ex
citing." Co-captain Raymond
placed third in the 200 free in
1.52.72 and turned in a 52.87
