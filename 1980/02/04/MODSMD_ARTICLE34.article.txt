"It was raining Stanford gym
nasts," quipped Cardinal gym
nastics coach Jackie Walker.
Borrowing the phrase from
Sports lllustraled's coverage of
December's World Gymnastics
Championships, Walker's refer
ence to her team's nerve
wracking balance beam perfor
mance was more truth than
exaggeration.
But the Stanford women's
team put together enough strong
showings to be reigning terror in
the record books and upset
eighth-ranked UCLA by .35 of a
point Friday night, "the biggest
win in the history of women's
gymnastics at Stanford." accord
ing to Walker.
Sadao Hamada's men scored
their third highest team total of
the season to defeat Chico State
253.10 to 247.60 Friday night

Melcher at 8.80 and second in
floor with an 8.90 tally. Bledsoe
finished second on bars with 8.75

third-place beam routine (8.60)
and Trina Wiggins' fourth on
bars (8.60) and runner-up vault
of 9.30.
Besides winning all-around,
Shapiro also topped the other
entrants in vaulting (9.50), beam
(9.35) and floor (9.30).
Kitabayashi placed fourth in
floor (8.25) and third on bars

overall.
Walker's team edgetf out the
Bruins by a 137.55 to 137.20
margin, breaking the school re
cord of 134.70 set Jan. 12 against
fifth-ranked USC, and keeping
the squad's string of five victories
intact.
The Cards also set new stan
dards in uneven parallel bars
with a 34.70 effort, floor exercise
(33.55) and beam (33.55) im
proving on school marks set
against the Trojans by one, two
or more points.
UCLA's Sharon Shapiro',
third-ranked all-around com
petitor in the nation, won that
category with a 36.65 total. Stan
ford's Karen Hall finished sec
ond with 35.50, followed by
Anne Kitabayashi of UCLA

"1 think it's going to make the
girls work harder," Walker said,
"because they know they can be
one of the best teams in the coun
try.
"Looking at their faces after
the meet, 1 could see that the
closeness made it .'n even more
meaningful win. Long Beach (a
67.30 to 127.95 loser to Stanford
two weeks ago) was not a full
team and the win didn't mean
much," she said.
Currently rated 20th in the
country, Stanford could move up

in the standings with the pair of
convincing victories over USC
and UCLA.
In the men's competition,
Chico State's Dennis Chase took

points, followed by Stanford s
Mike Lee with 51.00 and Link
Franzini of Chico (50.20).

tired," Hamada said. "Mike re
covered from fatigue, David
(Hyde) did very well despite sp-

raining a finger and Rich Rosen
did very well."
Lee placed fourth on rings
(8.75) and high bar (8.95) and
won the pommel horse e\ent
with an 8.75 judging. Bostick

Franzini finished fourth on
parallel bars (7.60) and vaulting

Thornton placed third on horse

"The team is still young and
unpredictable, hopefully unpre
dictable in a good way. They're
like a bomb â€” you never know
when they'll explode," he added.


Karen Hall leaping to her second place finish in the
balance beam is Stanford's best. Her victory in the uneven
parallel bars gave Stanford the boost it needed over UCLA.
