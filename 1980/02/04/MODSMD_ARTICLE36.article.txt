## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
•It was an active weekend for
*
Stanford's men's \olle>ball team
as it split up to compete in two
tournaments: an intercollegiate
tilt at UC-Santa Barbara, and a
United States Volleyball Associ
ation tourney against top
amateur clubs from the area. The
collegiate tourney took place
Friday and Saturday, while the
USVBA match was played
Saturday.
With all ten California ln
terscholastic Volleyball Associa
tion teams play ing at Santa Bar
bara (including late entrv USC).
Ceach Fred Sturm was able to
evaluate his squad against league
cijrnpetition and seemed pleased
with what he saw. "The group
played very well together." the
cijach noted, adding."l expect us
to.be the most improved team in
oyr league this season."
The intercollegiate tourna

ment included 20 teams that
were div ided into four groups of
five. The teams played everyone
in their group twice, with the
winner of the individual groups
going on to compete in double
elimination rounds.
Stanford began the tourna
ment with a pair of wins over
Fresno State, but lost a couple of
close ones to Long Beach State
15-10 and 15-11. The next
match brought on Pepperdine
who took both games 15-12 and
1 5-6. The Cards finished play in
the group with a split against
Santa Clara, taking the first one
15-12 and losing 18-16 in the
next game. Their record was
good for third in the group be
hind Pepperdine and Long
Beach State.
In consolation action Stanford
swept a pair from Arizona, but
lost 11-9 in both games against
I'C-San Diego to finish tourna
ment plav. The spikers played a

total of 14 games over the two
day period.
As for individual perfor
mances. Sturm again expressed
satisfaction. "(Jack) Foxworth
played extremely well. (John)
McColl and (Bob) Dean got
their experience of collegiate
play, and did well. (Frank) An
derson plaved much improved,
and (Kim) Lum was his steadv,
consistent self." he remarked.
Unfortunately these indi
vidual showings were countered
by injuries to a pair of the team's
stalwarts, senior power hitter
Rod Fletcher and junior setter
Dave Saeta. Fletcher suffered a
shoulder injury, but should be
able to return to play by this
weekend. Saeta. felled with a
hyperextended knee, is ques
tionable at this point. As to the
effect that Saeta's absence might
have. Sturm commented.
"Dave's been a two year starter
and played very well in this tour

nament. You hate to see some
thing like this happen." The
coach also pointed out that the
team is deep enough in the setter
spot to work around the injury
for now.
At the USVBA tourney. 10 ot
the best club teams in the area
took part in what Sturm referred
to as "a good opportunity to get
some experience." The Cardi
nals took the first match, but lost
in the second and finished play
with a loss in the loser's bracket.
According to the coach senior
setter Tom Grimes and soph
middle blocker Mark Reagan
continued to show improvement,

while freshman Andrew Dodds
was praised for consistency at
hitter.
As for how much this helped
him assess his squad Sturm said.
•'What was beneficial was that
we were able to see what we're
up against. The difference bet
ween UCLA and UC-San Diego
in talent isn't that great, it's that
they're more consistent . . . we
make cohesive errors; it's just a
li'tle lack of refinement." Sturm
added that these errors can be
overcome and observed that the
team showed improvement on
facets of the game that were
worked on in practice.
