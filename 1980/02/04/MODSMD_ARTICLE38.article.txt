## 
### Richard Martinez Sports Editor 
Stanford's pitching staff — the
brunt of much criticism from
Cardinal baseball fans — turned
in three shining performances
tins weekend as Stanford beat
llumbolt State Friday, 0-0, and
swept the University of Nevada
;it Reno. 1 7-3 and 3-1.
Head coach Mark Marquess
seemed quite satisfied with the
mound performances. "Pitchers,
we salute you. You saved us,"
Marquess announced in the dug
out to his players Friday, after a
closer game than the score indi
cated.
Hie Lumberjacks from Hum
bolt State are no power in
baseball but they held the Cards
to a mere 1-0 lead until Stanford
erupted for five runs in the bot
tom of the eighth inning.
The Cards blew a scoring op
portunity in the bottom of the
first inning when Mike Dotterer
was doubled off of second after
guessing 'hit' on a solid line shot
by Paul Zuvella. Although it was
one of the few mental errors

committed during the game,
Stanford had problems all day
getting runners home. Eleven
Cards were stranded on base.
Sophomore pitcher Brian
Mignano kept the I umberjack's
offense silent. He turned in a
four-pitch second inning fol
lowed by striking out two in the
third with catcher Hill Worden
gunning down a man attempting
to steal second for the final out.
Mignano got out of a sixth in
ning jam when he got Humbolt's

Worden went two for three, and
Dave Meier and John Elway col
lected one hit apiece.
Freshman first baseman Eric
Hardgrave collected a hit and
had a seventh inning grand slam
taken away as the Reno outfiel
der reached up over the fence to
catch the shot.
The pitching was superb as
Lee C'line went a strong seven
innings, fanning four batters
while walking two.
The defense supported C'line
