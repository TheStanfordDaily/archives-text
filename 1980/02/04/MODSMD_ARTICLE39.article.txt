shortstop to fly out with the
bases loaded.
George Lope/ was called in to
relieve Mignano with two men
on base and one man out in the
seventh. After walking the first
batter, he retired the side. Lopez
is not an overpowering pitcher
but he possesses fine control and
a fine assortment of breaking
and off-speed pitches.
He preserved the shutout by
allowing only one hit in the final
two and two-thirds innings and
striking out the last two batters
of the game.
The close game turned into a
laugher when Humbolt relievers
lost sight ol home plate. Walking
six Cards and hitting one. the
Lumberjacks gave up five runs
while only allowing one hit in
Stanford's half of the eighth.
The pitching was not only
superb, the Cards' defense was
\er\ sound. Stanford is fielding a
young squad (one senior, two
juniors, two sophomores and
three freshmen) but it appears to
be well drilled in fundamentals.
"The development of the
youngsters on this squad has
been astonishing," said Mar
quess. "They were super players
when they entered; now they are
disciplined as well as talented."
The only things at question
during Saturday's first game
against the University of Nevada
at Reno were if they could record
their second shutout in a row
(they had only two in three years
previous), and how many times
they could circle the bases.
Everyone seemed to join in
the fun during Stanford's 17-3
rout of the Wolfpack; freshman
Mike Aldrete doubled. All
Facifie-10 second baseman Paul
Zuvella went two for three,
sophomore Mike Toothman
homered, first baseman Loring
Davies went three for three with
a triple and two singles,
freshman third baseman Steve
Buechele went two for four with
a double and a triple, catcher Bill

superbly, turning in five double
plays. The double play combina
tion of shortstop Meier and sec
ond baseman Zuvella is consi
dered one of the best in the
Fac-lOand Bill Worden is one of
the best defensive catchers to
play for Stanford in some time.
The Cards collected 19 hits
with their 17 runs and stranded
1 I men on base. Reno was held
to three runs on seven hits while
leaving seven men on base.
The complexion of the second
game was entirely different.
Reno seemed to be an entirely
different squad as it forgot the
humiliation of the first game and
played with real determination,
holding the score to a close 3-1
margin.
Senior hurler Larry Kuhn
opened his fine performance by
striking out two men in the first
inning and designated hitter Al
dretti homered in the Cards'
half.
The Wolfpack scored a run in
the third but Stanford went
ahead in the fourth as Zuvella
doubled and Meier singled a
side-armed into right, scoring
him from second.
Kuhn, meanwhile, breezed
through the fourth and fifth in
nings on 14 pitches. Elvvay broke
out of a bit of a slump by homer
ing to right in the fifth.
Kuhn completed the seven in
ning game without signs of
fatigue and the Stanford pitching
staff boasted another fine per
formance. Only four runs were
allowed in 25 innings.
Stanford is now 4-0 and faces

shortstop to fly out with the
bases loaded.
George Lope/ was called in to
relieve Mignano with two men
on base and one man out in the
seventh. After walking the first
batter, he retired the side. Lopez
is not an overpowering pitcher
but he possesses fine control and
a fine assortment of breaking
and off-speed pitches.
He preserved the shutout by
allowing only one hit in the final
two and two-thirds innings and
striking out the last two batters
of the game.
The close game turned into a
laugher when Humbolt relievers
lost sight ol home plate. Walking
six Cards and hitting one. the
Lumberjacks gave up five runs
while only allowing one hit in
Stanford's half of the eighth.
The pitching was not only
superb, the Cards' defense was
\er\ sound. Stanford is fielding a
young squad (one senior, two
juniors, two sophomores and
three freshmen) but it appears to
be well drilled in fundamentals.
"The development of the
youngsters on this squad has
been astonishing," said Mar
quess. "They were super players
when they entered; now they are
disciplined as well as talented."
The only things at question
during Saturday's first game
against the University of Nevada
at Reno were if they could record
their second shutout in a row
(they had only two in three years
previous), and how many times
they could circle the bases.
Everyone seemed to join in
the fun during Stanford's 17-3
rout of the Wolfpack; freshman
Mike Aldrete doubled. All
Facifie-10 second baseman Paul
Zuvella went two for three,
sophomore Mike Toothman
homered, first baseman Loring
Davies went three for three with
a triple and two singles,
freshman third baseman Steve
Buechele went two for four with
a double and a triple, catcher Bill

superbly, turning in five double
plays. The double play combina
tion of shortstop Meier and sec
ond baseman Zuvella is consi
dered one of the best in the
Fac-lOand Bill Worden is one of
the best defensive catchers to
play for Stanford in some time.
The Cards collected 19 hits
with their 17 runs and stranded
1 I men on base. Reno was held
to three runs on seven hits while
leaving seven men on base.
The complexion of the second
game was entirely different.
Reno seemed to be an entirely
different squad as it forgot the
humiliation of the first game and
played with real determination,
holding the score to a close 3-1
margin.
Senior hurler Larry Kuhn
opened his fine performance by
striking out two men in the first
inning and designated hitter Al
dretti homered in the Cards'
half.
The Wolfpack scored a run in
the third but Stanford went
ahead in the fourth as Zuvella
doubled and Meier singled a
side-armed into right, scoring
him from second.
Kuhn, meanwhile, breezed
through the fourth and fifth in
nings on 14 pitches. Elvvay broke
out of a bit of a slump by homer
ing to right in the fifth.
Kuhn completed the seven in
ning game without signs of
fatigue and the Stanford pitching
staff boasted another fine per
formance. Only four runs were
allowed in 25 innings.
Stanford is now 4-0 and faces
the University of San Francisco
this .Tuesday at Sunken
Diamond at 2 p.m.
