### Chris Haft Staff Writer 
TEMPI- — Compounding
their frustrations and continuing
their procession ol defeats. Stan
lord's men's basketball team fell
to Arizona State, 9.1-80, Satur
day afternoon at the University
Activity Center.
The Cardinals were frustrated
early by 7-foot Alton Lister,
6-10 Kurt Nimphius and 6-8
Sam Williams, who made re
bounding a Herculean task, de
fending a scramble and scoring a
difficulty.
They were frustrated by 6-0
sophomore guard Lafayette
Lever, who displayed an outside
shooting touch few people
knew he had while scoring a col
legiate career-high 22 points.
More importantly Lever dealt 10
assists and helped thwart Stan
ford's offensive efforts by alertly
clogging the passing lanes.
Finally.the Cards were frus
trated by theirown untimely mis
takes. which prevented them
from continuing the charge that
altered a 20-point deficit to a
mere five-point disadvantage.
Thus Stanford's litany ol fai
lure grows more and more un
pleasant to recite: a 3-16 overall
record. 1-10 and last place in the
Pacific-10 Conference, seven
losses in a row and 15 defeats in
the last 16 games.
ASU improved its league
mark to 9-1. good for first place.
One positive aspect of the
Cards' play has been their ability
to maintain determined perfor
mances. Saturday Stanford could
have totally crumbled upon fal
ling behind by 20 points, but in
stead it staged a strong com
eback.

"A general comment would be
that although we were not satis
lied with the won-loss margin on
this trip, it was probably the most
aggressive play we've had on the
road in a long time," Card head
coach Dick Dißiaso said, refer
ring to the ASU game and also
Thursday night's 95-88 overtime
loss at Arizona.
Stanford's aggression began to
make itself" evident during the
second half, when foul trouble
caused Lister, Nimphius and
Williams, the Sun Devil be
hemoths. to disappear from the
game like mammoths becoming
extinct.
Nimphius, one of the Pac-10's
leading scorers who scored 25
points against Stanford Jan. 3,
collected his third personal foul
one minute into the second half.
With 17:20 remaining, guard
Doug Marty drove on Nimphius
and drew a fourth foul — one
away from automatic expulsion
thus prompting Sun Devil
head coach Ned Wulk to remove
Nimphius.
Williams committed his fourth
foul with 13:28 left, and Wulk
replaced him with Tom Kuyper.
When Lister got his fourth foul
with 9:45 to go, Wulk im
mediately sent Williams to the
scorer's table to replace Lister.
1 i\e seconds later, however. Lis
ter picked up his fifth and final
foul before Williams could save
him.
"That was the all-time disas
ter." Wulk said of the fiasco.
Shortly after Lister fouled out,
ASU's Paul Williams hit an out
side jumper to gi\e the Sun De
vils their biggest lead at 69-49
with 9:25 to go.
Ignoring the large deficit, the

Cards surged back. Orlando
Ward grabbed an offensive re
bound and scored, Kimberly
Belton spun for a three-point
play on a fast break and Brian
Welch bombed in a 21-footer to
bring Stanford within seven,
69-56.
With 6:37 to go, Belton
guided in a one-hander while
being fouled by Kuyper. The 6-7
senior forward sank the follow
ing free throw to cut the Sun De
vils' lead to 73-63 and force
Wulk to reinsert Nimphius into
the lineup.
Even with Nimphius back, the
Cards came closer. Ward sank a
bank shot and Welch hit two free
throws after drawing a fifth and
disqualifying foul from Sam Wil
liams for 73-67.
" I thought we did this (build a
big lead) in a very workmanlike
way," Wulk commented. "We
also did a very workmanlike job
of blowing it."
Johnny Nash tipped in Lever's
missed jump shot to extend
ASU's lead to 75-67. However,
Stanford's Terry Smith hit the
first of two free throws and
Welch followed in the second to
close the gap to 75-70 with 4:25
remaining.
"It was weird because I never
really telt them come back,"
Kuyper said. "All of a sudden 1
looked up at the clock and we
were up by only five."
Then all of a sudden. Smith
missed the first of a one-and
one. Kuyper tipped in a shot
left-handed. Welch shot an air
ball. Kuyper hit two free throws.
Marty threw a pass that Lever
intercepted, and Lever hit two
free throws with 3:06 left to give
ASU an ultimately safe 81-70
lead.

A reporter said to
that he must have been pleased
with Stanford's comeback.
"Yes," Dißiaso began. "But it
also shows we have to have cer
tain combinations (of players) in
the game to do that. It's also the
reason we missed a shot and had
two turnovers in the next three
possessions (after coming within
75-70) — people were tired."
One player who didn't appear
too tired was Belton. His 22-
point performance pushed him
past Tom Dose into the No. 2
all-time Stanford scoring spot
with 1458 career points. Belton
now trails only Claude Terry,
who had 1566 points.
