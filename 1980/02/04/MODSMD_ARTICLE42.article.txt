After taking a break for football, the IM fearless forecasters have
decided to stick our necks out again for basketball season. It seems
little has changed from a year ago, as many familiar names dominate
the rankings.
' Theta Del* basketball powers for many years, top the "A"
league polls, followed closely by Sleep and Dreams, Phred's Phaces
and PACE.
The first, second and fourth teams are all in the Thursday night
Maples league, easily the IM's best. Phred's Phaces, a team com
prised of several football players, has moved up to the "A" league
this year after capturing the "B" title last season. They have already
knocked off last year's "A" champs. Loss Causation. The Bootable:-,,
always contenders, cannot be counted out this year either.
In the "B" league, 8.A.1). Company has soared to a 3-0 record
including lopsided 9K-23 and 79-45 victories. Following close behind
are the Twain Mens, half of last year's runner-ups, the Blue Hens.
The other half of that squad is lodged in the tenth spot and should
move up when it makes up some games. Also in the ,4 B" league are a
pair of Tiny Bubbles teams, ranked third and ninth respectively, but it
should be noted that any of the top 10 teams appears to have a shot at
the crown vacated by Phred's Phaces.
In the "C" division Madera's Sunday team appears to be the best
but there could be some trouble from Hammer's Jammers, another
undefeated powerhouse. The Motos should not be underestimated,
since a tough loss to Madera is the only blemish on their record.
With only one woman's "A" league, this classification provided
our pollsters with their easiest selections. The Substituents are un
beaten and top-ranked after dumping Hockey Red in a probable
preview of the finals. The Californians are third after losing to Hoc
key Red. while 558 Mayfield dropped its lone contest to the Califor
nians.
A Manzanita squad tops the women's "B" polls as SLITS (Stan
ford Liberated Intellectuals for Torrid Sex) is 3-0 in the Roble
Sunday afternoon league. Serra and Branner follow closely and they
square off in a showdown Thursday.
League play ends February 27. with the playoffs, involving the top
two teams in each league, following immediately thereafter.


Perennial A league power Sleep and Dreams is rated second
overall in the Daily poll this week.

After taking a break for football, the IM fearless forecasters have
decided to stick our necks out again for basketball season. It seems
little has changed from a year ago, as many familiar names dominate
the rankings.
' Theta Del* basketball powers for many years, top the "A"
league polls, followed closely by Sleep and Dreams, Phred's Phaces
and PACE.
The first, second and fourth teams are all in the Thursday night
Maples league, easily the IM's best. Phred's Phaces, a team com
prised of several football players, has moved up to the "A" league
this year after capturing the "B" title last season. They have already
knocked off last year's "A" champs. Loss Causation. The Bootable:-,,
always contenders, cannot be counted out this year either.
In the "B" league, 8.A.1). Company has soared to a 3-0 record
including lopsided 9K-23 and 79-45 victories. Following close behind
are the Twain Mens, half of last year's runner-ups, the Blue Hens.
The other half of that squad is lodged in the tenth spot and should
move up when it makes up some games. Also in the ,4 B" league are a
pair of Tiny Bubbles teams, ranked third and ninth respectively, but it
should be noted that any of the top 10 teams appears to have a shot at
the crown vacated by Phred's Phaces.
In the "C" division Madera's Sunday team appears to be the best
but there could be some trouble from Hammer's Jammers, another
undefeated powerhouse. The Motos should not be underestimated,
since a tough loss to Madera is the only blemish on their record.
With only one woman's "A" league, this classification provided
our pollsters with their easiest selections. The Substituents are un
beaten and top-ranked after dumping Hockey Red in a probable
preview of the finals. The Californians are third after losing to Hoc
key Red. while 558 Mayfield dropped its lone contest to the Califor
nians.
A Manzanita squad tops the women's "B" polls as SLITS (Stan
ford Liberated Intellectuals for Torrid Sex) is 3-0 in the Roble
Sunday afternoon league. Serra and Branner follow closely and they
square off in a showdown Thursday.
League play ends February 27. with the playoffs, involving the top
two teams in each league, following immediately thereafter.


Perennial A league power Sleep and Dreams is rated second
overall in the Daily poll this week.
