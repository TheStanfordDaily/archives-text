State prison secured
SANTA FE, N.M. — National Guardsmen and
a police SWAT team recaptured the hurtling New
Mexico State Prison yesterday to free all the re
maining hostages and end a 36-hour bloodbath
that left at least 27 inmates dead and 50 persons
hospitalized.
State Criminal Justice Secretary Adolph Saenz
said the death toll had reached 27 "not counting
the gymnasium," which had been burning for
more than 12 hours.
"The violence was incredible." Saenz said.
One ot the prisoners was beheaded.
There were earlier reports that the gym had
served as a funeral parlor for a large number of
prisoners, but Deputy Warden Robert Montoya
said that was unconfirmed rumor.
A corrections officer. Fred Herrera, said some
of the dead inmates had been mutilated, making
it difficult to identify them.
Without tiring a shot, about 100 Guardsmen
and policemen entered the grounds at 1:45 p.m.
MST. When a group of about 25 defiant inmates
holed up in the administration building began
shouting at the officers, the Guardsmen fixed
their bayonets.
"Shoot us." one of the cons icts yelled. "We've
got no guns."
A short time later. Corrections Commissioner
Chairman Bud Richards announced, "We're in
control right now. Not a shot has been fired."
Corrections officers said the last three of the 15
prison employees originally taken hostage were
found safe. Two guards were found in a gas
chamber which is no longer used and a medical
technician was found hiding in a vault.
About halt of the inmates taken to the hospital
were suffering from drug overdoses as a result of
the rampage that carried prisoners into the facili
ty's hospital and pharmacy supplies.
It was the worst prison riot in the country since
43 people were killed in 1971 at Attica prison in
New York.
FBI probes Congress bribes
WASHINGTON — Eight members of Con
gress have been implicated in an FBI investiga
tion ot political corruption that was carefully
monitored at the highest lev els of the Justice De
partment to avert instances of entrapment,
sources said yesterday.
The sources said that FBI director William
Webster and top Justice Department lawyers
closely policed the probe and that the FBI was
never the first to suggest bribes to public figures.

One source familiar with the investigation said
flatly that videotape evidence will show there was
no entrapment.
"Informants and lawyers who came to them
brought in officials seeking bribes." he said.
Code-named Operation Abscam. the investi
gation used undercover FBI men posing as rep
resentatives of an Arab sheik offering bribes to
win a casino gambling license and other favors.
At least 20 public officials and 10 lawyers and
businessmen were implicated over 14 months.
The eight congressmen were from the states on
the East Coast.
The source, who asked not to be named, said
that FBI agents paid out almost $500,000 in cash
to the officials, although fewer than 10 of them
took money.
"Some arranged meetings or did other favors,"
the source said.
Grand juries are expected to be empaneled this
week to begin hearing evidence — and viewing
videotapes — in the case, which is being called the
largest Capitol Hill corruption investigation ever.
Militant appeal to Khomeini
TEHRAN — Militant students in the U.S.
Embassy, feeling increasingly isolated and vul
nerable by the shift in public attention away from
them and towards a president interested in solv
ing the hostage crisis, have appealed to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini for moral support.
But at the same time they face renewed con
troversy over their attacks on "internal bases of
the U.S." After students allegations against the
Tehran newspaper Bamdad prompted the staff to
close it temporarily.
The students' appeal to Khomeini in an open
letter complained that in the short space of time
since he had been in the hospital they had come
under attack from "beggars . . . who sometimes
also have ambitions of leadership" threatening
"to smash us into pieces."
The letter included a strong reassertion of their
demand that the United States should return the
shah and his wealth as a precondition for obtain
ing release ot the American hostages. "This is
your order." the students maintained, "that we
must get back the shah from the U.S., not by
methods of compromise, but by revolutionary
methods."
The letter is not seen as an attack specifically
on Iran's newly elected president. Abol Hassan
Bani-Sadr.
The students' appeal reflects concern over the
steady erosion of their public influence, upstaged
as they have been by the presidential elections.

and over the emergence of a president who is
evidently willing to settle the hostage crisis on
terms less than those they have been holding out
for.
Americans would fight for oil
NEW YORK — Americans say they are wil
ling to send U.S. troops to the Persian Gult it the
Soviets invade that region, the Associated
Press-NBC News poll shows.
Thus, the public supports the thrust ot the so
called "Carter Doctrine" put forward by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in his State of the Union mes
sage in late January:
"Let our position be absolutely clear.
"An attempt by any outside force to gain con
trol of the Persian Gulf will be regarded as an
assault on the vital interests of the United States
of America and such an assault will be repelled by
any means necessary, including military force."
In fact, the poll found Americans almost as
willing to use U.S. military power to defend the
Persian Gulf as they are to defend Western
Europe.
Sixty-four percent of those questioned l ues
day and Wednesday said they favor sending
troops "if the Soviets invade the Persian Gult,
where most of our imported oil comes from."
Faced with the turbulent world situation.
Americans express a definite willingness to use
U.S. military power to counter Soviet threats,
wherever they may occur.
In line with this willingness to use military force
is another rise in support for increased defense
spending — to yet another high for the decade.
Sixty-nine percent favor a bigger Pentagon
budget. 19 percent fav or no change and 5 percent
want decreases. Seven percent were not sure.
Carter to loosen hold on CIA
WASHINGTON —The Carter administration
intends to propose that a new. secret court be
given power to authorize covert government in
telligence agents to break into homes and offices
and open the mail of certain Americans.
But with President Jimmy Carter's proposal
still at least five days from being made public,
debate already has begun over just which Ameri
cans should be targets of such intrusions.
The question is whether the government can
act against any American believ ed to be an agent
of a foreign power or only against Americans
suspected of criminal activity. Another question
is just how certain of that criminal activity the
government must be.

The issue arises because Carter plans to prop
ose, possibly as early as Friday, a comprehensive
charter to govern a wide range of activities by
U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA,
1 Ml, National Security Agency and others. In his
State of the Union message last month. Carter
said that because of increased U.S.-Soviet ten
sions he wanted to loosen restrictions placed on
these agencies after abuses by them came to light
in the 19705.
Carter's popularity on the rise
WASHINGTON — In a scant three months.
President Jimmy Carter has undergone one of the
most stunning transformations imaginable.
Perceived by many last November as a presi
dent who just couldn't cut it, he is now over
whelmingly viewed as deserving more credit than
he is getting.
Carter is trusted, his character admired, his
policy decisions supported. Huge majorities
think that no one around can do a better job of
handling the nation's most excruciating problem:
obtaining the return of American hostages in
Iran.
Widely regarded last fall as a likely one-term
president. Carter now stands in an awesome posi
tion in his drive for reelection. He holds a lead of
more than 2 to 1 over Sen. Edward Kennedy, for
the Democratic nomination; he holds similar
leads, give or take a little, over the chief Republi
can contenders.
These are among the chief findings of a new
Washington Post poll conducted from Jan. 23 to
Jan. 28. The poll, of course, cannot predict
whether Carter will maintain his standings or take
a tumble in the weeks and months ahead.
Kremlin attacks dissident au
thor
MOSCOW — The Kremlin expanded its
crackdown on internal dissent here yesterday
with an ominous attack on Lev Kopelev, a promi
nent dissident author and friend of Nobel Prize
winning physicist Andrei Sakharov.
The attack came in the form of an article in the
newspaper Soviet Russia. which accused the 67-
year-old former staunch Communist of being a
"Judas" whose two-room Moscow apartment is
"a nest of ideological subversion and meeting
place of Western emissaries."
Kopelev was one of 1 9 Soviet cultural and dis
sident figures who condemned the banishment of
Sakharov less than two weeks ago and said that it
presaged '"a return to the dark times of
Stalinism."

called "Carter Doctrine" put forward by Presi

sage in late January:
"Let our position be absolutely clear.
"An attempt by any outside force to gain con
trol of the Persian Gulf will be regarded as an
assault on the vital interests of the United States
of America and such an assault will be repelled by
any means necessary, including military force."
In fact, the poll found Americans almost as
willing to use U.S. military power to defend the
Persian Gulf as they are to defend Western
Europe.
Sixty-four percent of those questioned l ues
day and Wednesday said they favor sending
troops "if the Soviets invade the Persian Gult,
where most of our imported oil comes from."
Faced with the turbulent world situation.
Americans express a definite willingness to use
U.S. military power to counter Soviet threats,
wherever they may occur.
In line with this willingness to use military force
is another rise in support for increased defense
spending — to yet another high for the decade.
Sixty-nine percent favor a bigger Pentagon
budget. 19 percent fav or no change and 5 percent
want decreases. Seven percent were not sure.
Carter to loosen hold on CIA
WASHINGTON —The Carter administration
intends to propose that a new. secret court be
given power to authorize covert government in
telligence agents to break into homes and offices
and open the mail of certain Americans.
But with President Jimmy Carter's proposal
still at least five days from being made public,
debate already has begun over just which Ameri
cans should be targets of such intrusions.
The question is whether the government can
act against any American believ ed to be an agent
of a foreign power or only against Americans
suspected of criminal activity. Another question
is just how certain of that criminal activity the
government must be.

The issue arises because Carter plans to prop
ose, possibly as early as Friday, a comprehensive
charter to govern a wide range of activities by
U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA,
1 Ml, National Security Agency and others. In his
State of the Union message last month. Carter
said that because of increased U.S.-Soviet ten
sions he wanted to loosen restrictions placed on
these agencies after abuses by them came to light
in the 19705.
Carter's popularity on the rise
WASHINGTON — In a scant three months.
President Jimmy Carter has undergone one of the
most stunning transformations imaginable.
Perceived by many last November as a presi
dent who just couldn't cut it, he is now over
whelmingly viewed as deserving more credit than
he is getting.
Carter is trusted, his character admired, his
policy decisions supported. Huge majorities
think that no one around can do a better job of
handling the nation's most excruciating problem:
obtaining the return of American hostages in
Iran.
Widely regarded last fall as a likely one-term
president. Carter now stands in an awesome posi
tion in his drive for reelection. He holds a lead of
more than 2 to 1 over Sen. Edward Kennedy, for
the Democratic nomination; he holds similar
leads, give or take a little, over the chief Republi
can contenders.
These are among the chief findings of a new
Washington Post poll conducted from Jan. 23 to
Jan. 28. The poll, of course, cannot predict
whether Carter will maintain his standings or take
a tumble in the weeks and months ahead.
Kremlin attacks dissident au
thor
MOSCOW — The Kremlin expanded its
crackdown on internal dissent here yesterday
with an ominous attack on Lev Kopelev, a promi
nent dissident author and friend of Nobel Prize
winning physicist Andrei Sakharov.
The attack came in the form of an article in the
newspaper Soviet Russia. which accused the 67-
year-old former staunch Communist of being a
"Judas" whose two-room Moscow apartment is
"a nest of ideological subversion and meeting
place of Western emissaries."
Kopelev was one of 1 9 Soviet cultural and dis
sident figures who condemned the banishment of
Sakharov less than two weeks ago and said that it
presaged '"a return to the dark times of
Stalinism."
State prison secured
SANTA FE, N.M. — National Guardsmen and
a police SWAT team recaptured the hurtling New
Mexico State Prison yesterday to free all the re
maining hostages and end a 36-hour bloodbath
that left at least 27 inmates dead and 50 persons
hospitalized.
State Criminal Justice Secretary Adolph Saenz
said the death toll had reached 27 "not counting
the gymnasium," which had been burning for
more than 12 hours.
"The violence was incredible." Saenz said.
One ot the prisoners was beheaded.
There were earlier reports that the gym had
served as a funeral parlor for a large number of
prisoners, but Deputy Warden Robert Montoya
said that was unconfirmed rumor.
A corrections officer. Fred Herrera, said some
of the dead inmates had been mutilated, making
it difficult to identify them.
Without tiring a shot, about 100 Guardsmen
and policemen entered the grounds at 1:45 p.m.
MST. When a group of about 25 defiant inmates
holed up in the administration building began
shouting at the officers, the Guardsmen fixed
their bayonets.
"Shoot us." one of the cons icts yelled. "We've
got no guns."
A short time later. Corrections Commissioner
Chairman Bud Richards announced, "We're in
control right now. Not a shot has been fired."
Corrections officers said the last three of the 15
prison employees originally taken hostage were
found safe. Two guards were found in a gas
chamber which is no longer used and a medical
technician was found hiding in a vault.
About halt of the inmates taken to the hospital
were suffering from drug overdoses as a result of
the rampage that carried prisoners into the facili
ty's hospital and pharmacy supplies.
It was the worst prison riot in the country since
43 people were killed in 1971 at Attica prison in
New York.
FBI probes Congress bribes
WASHINGTON — Eight members of Con
gress have been implicated in an FBI investiga
tion ot political corruption that was carefully
monitored at the highest lev els of the Justice De
partment to avert instances of entrapment,
sources said yesterday.
The sources said that FBI director William
Webster and top Justice Department lawyers
closely policed the probe and that the FBI was
never the first to suggest bribes to public figures.

One source familiar with the investigation said
flatly that videotape evidence will show there was
no entrapment.
"Informants and lawyers who came to them
brought in officials seeking bribes." he said.
Code-named Operation Abscam. the investi
gation used undercover FBI men posing as rep
resentatives of an Arab sheik offering bribes to
win a casino gambling license and other favors.
At least 20 public officials and 10 lawyers and
businessmen were implicated over 14 months.
The eight congressmen were from the states on
the East Coast.
The source, who asked not to be named, said
that FBI agents paid out almost $500,000 in cash
to the officials, although fewer than 10 of them
took money.
"Some arranged meetings or did other favors,"
the source said.
Grand juries are expected to be empaneled this
week to begin hearing evidence — and viewing
videotapes — in the case, which is being called the
largest Capitol Hill corruption investigation ever.
Militant appeal to Khomeini
TEHRAN — Militant students in the U.S.
Embassy, feeling increasingly isolated and vul
nerable by the shift in public attention away from
them and towards a president interested in solv
ing the hostage crisis, have appealed to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini for moral support.
But at the same time they face renewed con
troversy over their attacks on "internal bases of
the U.S." After students allegations against the
Tehran newspaper Bamdad prompted the staff to
close it temporarily.
The students' appeal to Khomeini in an open
letter complained that in the short space of time
since he had been in the hospital they had come
under attack from "beggars . . . who sometimes
also have ambitions of leadership" threatening
"to smash us into pieces."
The letter included a strong reassertion of their
demand that the United States should return the
shah and his wealth as a precondition for obtain
ing release ot the American hostages. "This is
your order." the students maintained, "that we
must get back the shah from the U.S., not by
methods of compromise, but by revolutionary
methods."
The letter is not seen as an attack specifically
on Iran's newly elected president. Abol Hassan
Bani-Sadr.
The students' appeal reflects concern over the
steady erosion of their public influence, upstaged
as they have been by the presidential elections.

and over the emergence of a president who is
evidently willing to settle the hostage crisis on
terms less than those they have been holding out
for.

and policemen entered the grounds at 1:45 p.m.
MST. When a group of about 25 defiant inmates
holed up in the administration building began
shouting at the officers, the Guardsmen fixed
their bayonets.
"Shoot us." one of the cons icts yelled. "We've
got no guns."
A short time later. Corrections Commissioner
Chairman Bud Richards announced, "We're in
control right now. Not a shot has been fired."
Corrections officers said the last three of the 15
prison employees originally taken hostage were
found safe. Two guards were found in a gas
chamber which is no longer used and a medical
technician was found hiding in a vault.
About halt of the inmates taken to the hospital
were suffering from drug overdoses as a result of
the rampage that carried prisoners into the facili
ty's hospital and pharmacy supplies.
It was the worst prison riot in the country since
43 people were killed in 1971 at Attica prison in
New York.
FBI probes Congress bribes
WASHINGTON — Eight members of Con
gress have been implicated in an FBI investiga
tion ot political corruption that was carefully
monitored at the highest lev els of the Justice De
partment to avert instances of entrapment,
sources said yesterday.
The sources said that FBI director William
Webster and top Justice Department lawyers
closely policed the probe and that the FBI was
never the first to suggest bribes to public figures.

One source familiar with the investigation said
flatly that videotape evidence will show there was
no entrapment.
"Informants and lawyers who came to them
brought in officials seeking bribes." he said.
Code-named Operation Abscam. the investi
gation used undercover FBI men posing as rep
resentatives of an Arab sheik offering bribes to
win a casino gambling license and other favors.
At least 20 public officials and 10 lawyers and
businessmen were implicated over 14 months.
The eight congressmen were from the states on
the East Coast.
The source, who asked not to be named, said
that FBI agents paid out almost $500,000 in cash
to the officials, although fewer than 10 of them
took money.
"Some arranged meetings or did other favors,"
the source said.
Grand juries are expected to be empaneled this
week to begin hearing evidence — and viewing
videotapes — in the case, which is being called the
largest Capitol Hill corruption investigation ever.
Militant appeal to Khomeini
TEHRAN — Militant students in the U.S.
Embassy, feeling increasingly isolated and vul
nerable by the shift in public attention away from
them and towards a president interested in solv
ing the hostage crisis, have appealed to Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini for moral support.
But at the same time they face renewed con
troversy over their attacks on "internal bases of
the U.S." After students allegations against the
Tehran newspaper Bamdad prompted the staff to
close it temporarily.
The students' appeal to Khomeini in an open
letter complained that in the short space of time
since he had been in the hospital they had come
under attack from "beggars . . . who sometimes
also have ambitions of leadership" threatening
"to smash us into pieces."
The letter included a strong reassertion of their
demand that the United States should return the
shah and his wealth as a precondition for obtain
ing release ot the American hostages. "This is
your order." the students maintained, "that we
must get back the shah from the U.S., not by
methods of compromise, but by revolutionary
methods."
The letter is not seen as an attack specifically
on Iran's newly elected president. Abol Hassan
Bani-Sadr.
The students' appeal reflects concern over the
steady erosion of their public influence, upstaged
as they have been by the presidential elections.

and over the emergence of a president who is
evidently willing to settle the hostage crisis on
terms less than those they have been holding out
for.
Americans would fight for oil
NEW YORK — Americans say they are wil
ling to send U.S. troops to the Persian Gult it the
Soviets invade that region, the Associated
Press-NBC News poll shows.
Thus, the public supports the thrust ot the so
called "Carter Doctrine" put forward by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in his State of the Union mes
sage in late January:
"Let our position be absolutely clear.
"An attempt by any outside force to gain con
trol of the Persian Gulf will be regarded as an
assault on the vital interests of the United States
of America and such an assault will be repelled by
any means necessary, including military force."
In fact, the poll found Americans almost as
willing to use U.S. military power to defend the
Persian Gulf as they are to defend Western
Europe.
Sixty-four percent of those questioned l ues
day and Wednesday said they favor sending
troops "if the Soviets invade the Persian Gult,
where most of our imported oil comes from."
Faced with the turbulent world situation.
Americans express a definite willingness to use
U.S. military power to counter Soviet threats,
wherever they may occur.
In line with this willingness to use military force
is another rise in support for increased defense
spending — to yet another high for the decade.
Sixty-nine percent favor a bigger Pentagon
budget. 19 percent fav or no change and 5 percent
want decreases. Seven percent were not sure.
Carter to loosen hold on CIA
WASHINGTON —The Carter administration
intends to propose that a new. secret court be
given power to authorize covert government in
telligence agents to break into homes and offices
and open the mail of certain Americans.
But with President Jimmy Carter's proposal
still at least five days from being made public,
debate already has begun over just which Ameri
cans should be targets of such intrusions.
The question is whether the government can
act against any American believ ed to be an agent
of a foreign power or only against Americans
suspected of criminal activity. Another question
is just how certain of that criminal activity the
government must be.

The issue arises because Carter plans to prop
ose, possibly as early as Friday, a comprehensive
charter to govern a wide range of activities by
U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA,
1 Ml, National Security Agency and others. In his
State of the Union message last month. Carter
said that because of increased U.S.-Soviet ten
sions he wanted to loosen restrictions placed on
these agencies after abuses by them came to light
in the 19705.
Carter's popularity on the rise
WASHINGTON — In a scant three months.
President Jimmy Carter has undergone one of the
most stunning transformations imaginable.
Perceived by many last November as a presi
dent who just couldn't cut it, he is now over
whelmingly viewed as deserving more credit than
he is getting.
Carter is trusted, his character admired, his
policy decisions supported. Huge majorities
think that no one around can do a better job of
handling the nation's most excruciating problem:
obtaining the return of American hostages in
Iran.
Widely regarded last fall as a likely one-term
president. Carter now stands in an awesome posi
tion in his drive for reelection. He holds a lead of
more than 2 to 1 over Sen. Edward Kennedy, for
the Democratic nomination; he holds similar
leads, give or take a little, over the chief Republi
can contenders.
These are among the chief findings of a new
Washington Post poll conducted from Jan. 23 to
Jan. 28. The poll, of course, cannot predict
whether Carter will maintain his standings or take
a tumble in the weeks and months ahead.
Kremlin attacks dissident au
thor
MOSCOW — The Kremlin expanded its
crackdown on internal dissent here yesterday
with an ominous attack on Lev Kopelev, a promi
nent dissident author and friend of Nobel Prize
winning physicist Andrei Sakharov.
The attack came in the form of an article in the
newspaper Soviet Russia. which accused the 67-
year-old former staunch Communist of being a
"Judas" whose two-room Moscow apartment is
"a nest of ideological subversion and meeting
place of Western emissaries."
Kopelev was one of 1 9 Soviet cultural and dis
sident figures who condemned the banishment of
Sakharov less than two weeks ago and said that it
presaged '"a return to the dark times of
Stalinism."
State prison secured
SANTA FE, N.M. — National Guardsmen and
a police SWAT team recaptured the hurtling New
Mexico State Prison yesterday to free all the re
maining hostages and end a 36-hour bloodbath
that left at least 27 inmates dead and 50 persons
hospitalized.
State Criminal Justice Secretary Adolph Saenz
said the death toll had reached 27 "not counting
the gymnasium," which had been burning for
more than 12 hours.
"The violence was incredible." Saenz said.
One ot the prisoners was beheaded.
There were earlier reports that the gym had
served as a funeral parlor for a large number of
prisoners, but Deputy Warden Robert Montoya
said that was unconfirmed rumor.
A corrections officer. Fred Herrera, said some
of the dead inmates had been mutilated, making
it difficult to identify them.
Without tiring a shot, about 100 Guardsmen
and policemen entered the grounds at 1:45 p.m.
MST. When a group of about 25 defiant inmates
holed up in the administration building began
shouting at the officers, the Guardsmen fixed
their bayonets.
