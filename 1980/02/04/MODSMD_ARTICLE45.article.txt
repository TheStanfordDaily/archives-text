### Robert Reed Staff Writer 
A noon rally in White Plaza analyz
ing the common bonds of struggle bet
ween blacks in America and blacks
around the world will kick off "Black
Liberation Month" here today.
The rally, featuring several student
and faculty speakers, music and poetry,
will be just one ot the month's many
activities aimed at heightening aware
ness of black liberation struggles in the
past, present and future, at home and
abroad.
The theme of the month. 'Common
Bonds of Struggle.' came "from
acknowledging that all of us all over the
world are in some kind of struggle,"
according to Keith Naylor. director of
the Black Community Services Center
(BCSC). The BCSC.' the African and
Afro-American Studies Department.
Ujamaa and all the other black organi

zations here, combine to produce this
month's activitiev
"Black Americans ha\e become
more and more aware of other black
struggles, and as we've done that,
we've come to link our struggle with
their struggle." Naylor said. Naylor
said the recent liberation movements in
southern Africa have increased aware
ness a great deal.
Black Liberation Month will include
films, lectures, discussions, forums, a
soul food dinner and many perfor
mances. An exhibit of African libera
tion movements is on display in the
Hoover Tower Lobby while a photo
graphic exhibit entitled the "Faces of
Mali" is on display at the Bechtel In
ternational Center. Beginning in
March another photographic exhibit
will go on display in Tresidder Union.
Tomorrow, an introductory sym
posium on the "State of the Struggle" is

designed to enlighten the public on just
where blacks are in the world and how
they are faring.
"There's not a whole lot of know
ledge about blacks around the world."
Naylor said. "Some people don't know
where countries are or where (black)
people are actually located." An inter
national panel of black graduate stu
dents will give a "regional update" on
blacks throughout the globe that
should "pave the way for further
analysis during the month." Naylor
said,
This Thursday, the "Black Student
Union Community Night Forum" will
provide an opportunity for local black
community leaders, from such areas as
Menlo Park and East Palo Alto, to dis
cuss informally what's going on in their
communities and how it relates to Stan
ford's community.
On Feb. 11. the uncensored version

of the controversial film. Blacks
Briumnica. will be screened in Bishop
Auditorium. The film is a "searing in
dictment of racism in Britain." accord
ing to Sue Ross, program coordinator
in Humanities and Sciences and the Af
rican and Afro-American Studies
Dept. 112 ollowing the film will be a dis
cussion with the film's co-producer
Musindo Mwinyipembe and Colin Pre
scod and A. Sivanandan. members of
the London Institute of Race Relations
and publishers of the journal. Race and
Class .
Alice Walker, a well-known black
American poet will read here on Feb.
19 as part of Women's Week.
An international black student
forum on Feb. 26 will discuss the transi
tion from a "foreign policy of the
blacks to a black world foreign policy."
Navlor said.
Black Liberation Month officially

winds up March 1 with an all-day sym
posium on " Blacks and Foreign Policy:
Pan-Africanism to PLO." where pro
fessors from Stanford. UC-Berkeley,
Atlanta University and possibly a
senior editor from Ebony magazine
will discuss to what degree blacks are
united around the world and to what
degree blacks are and/or should be in
volved in U.S. foreign policy. Ross
said.
While Black Liberation Month ac
tivities at the University have taken
place only in the last decade, the roots
of this time of "awareness" began in
1926 when Carter G. Woodson, a
noted black historian, founded a na
tional "Negro History Week."
"When school systems were segre
gated, all the black schools would
honor it. although almost all the white
schools did not," Ross explained.
"In the late '60s, with the rise in

black consciousness, calls came to ex
pand Negro History Week into Black
History Month (and from there to
Black Liberation Month in the '705)."
Though the efforts have been strong,
Ross feels Black l iberation Month has
not always achieved its purpose here.
One of the goals of Black Liberation
Month is to bring to light the achieve
ments and struggles of blacks not only
for the black community, but for the
broader Stanford community, Ross
said.
"I don't think we have always gotten
the audience from the broader com
munity that we should have."
Ross said she saw another problem
with the event, as well.
"It's the kind of thing we should be
doing on a regular basis," Ross said,
explaining that Black Liberation
Month should not simply be something
that happens in February.
