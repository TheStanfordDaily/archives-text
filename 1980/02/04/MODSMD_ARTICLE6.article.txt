# Students work against draft
## Organizations active nationwide 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Emerging peace* committees and growing concerns
seem to best characterize the mood on college campuses
across the country in reaction to President Jimmy Car
ter's call for reactivation of the Selective Service Com
mission and. possibly, the draft.
A random survey of colleges nationwide shows a vari
ety ot activities and programs planned to protest draft
reinstatement, with little or no pro-draft sentiment on
the campuses contacted.
The largest single effort to date was a Jan. 25 rally at
the University of California Berkeley which drew an
estimated 2500 people.
Lee Trampleasurc of the Berkeley Students tor Peace
(BSP) told the crowd, "It's important for all to recognize
that registration is the first step towards the draft and
that the draft is a major step toward war."
However Cynthia Harrison of the Daily Cal cited a
poll indicating that 51 percent of the Berkeley students
would serve in the army if drafted. She suggested that
Cal "seems lairly conservative in comparison to some of
the other colleges." I or instance, said Harrison, a poll at
Illinois' Northwestern University indicated that only 2(1
percent of the students there would serve if drafted
"There is certainly not the same fervor as at the height
of the Vietnam war." she said.
Meanwhile, at Harvard, Nobel Prize Winner George
VV ikl spoke to about KOO people at an anti-draft rallv at
Whitner Library on Thursday night. The rally, endorsed
by presidential candidates Edward Kennedy and Jerry
Brown, was "particularly impressive because it is cur
rently 20 degrees below zero at Harvard," said Harvard
Crimson staffer Bill McKibben that night.
Other efforts at Harvard have included small rallies,
circulation ot a petition stating that the students would
not serve if drafted, and an editorial in the Crimson
denouncing both registration and the draft, said McKib
ben.
McKibben said that there were "a lot of old Vietnam
people" at most ol the rallies and anti-draft activities.
Similar activities have taken place at Yale, where
freshman Robert Glaser is national coordinator tor Na
tional Draft Information day to be held on Feb. 12.
The aims of the day — three days after Carter is to
present a bill concerning the draft to Congress —"is to
get people thinking about the draft and what it will
represent. We think information will help defeat the
draft rather than promote it." Glaser explained.
Other nationwide groups supporting the Draft Infor
mation Day are the Friends Peace Committee (1 PC),
the Central Committee for Conscientious Ob jectors and
the Committee Against Registration and the Draft
(CARD), a coalition .ol 42 peace, student, civil and
religious groups.
CARD is a lobbying committee with chapters at many

campuses which is "absolutely committed to an all-out
effort to prevent draft registration from being imposed
in this country," said spokesman Barry Lynn.
At Kent State, the site of a violent anti-war ptotest in
1970 in which the National Guard killed four students.
CARD has been organizing committees "focusing on
the individual and what they can do about getting on the
record early as conscientious objectors," said Mark
Lauffer of the Daily Kent Stater.
"There isn't much anyone can do about registration
right now but they want to get opposition in the air" said
Lauffer.
At Vale, Draft Information Day will take the form of a
"teach-in." featuring seminars on different aspects of
the draft and registration. There will be six to eight
speakers, including Reverend William Sloan Coffin, one
of the clergymen who visited the American hostages in
Iran last month.
Other universities, including Stanford, are also plan
ning activities on or around Feb. 12. UCLA, which lie-Id
a rally last week sponsored by Students for a L ibertarian
Society (no groups have as yet formed on campus speci
fically concerning the draft), plans a similar teach-in for
Feb. I 2 according to Donna Prokop of the Daily liruin
A "Protect Day" is scheduled for Feb. at the I invcr
sity of Pennsylvania, according to Wendy Lucas of the
Peace Action Committee (PAC).
Lucas described the general sentiment .it her school as
one of "fear and uncertainty," adding, "there seems to
be a lot of concern that we are not protecting the country
but rather forcing our will on somebody else." she said.
Lucas, a freshman Peace Science major, said "the
hardest thing for me to deal with is male friends of mine
who are really frightened and just don't know enough
about what is going on," she said.
Pennsylvania's anti-draft efforts have included de
bates, forums discussion sections and "legislative ef forts
aimed at Congressmen regarding anti-draft measures."
Again, Lucas noted that very active in the school's ,mti
draft efforts "are people who were forel'runners against
the Vietnam war," she said.
On campus here. Council of Presidents (COP)
member Sibby Freeman explained that the COP. the
ASSU Senate and the ASSIJ speakers Bureau will be
sponsoring a "town hall meeting" in Kresge Auditorium
on Feb. 12, featuring "speakers, communis figures,
professors and students with pro and con questions re
lated to the draft and registration, and also the relation
ship of women to the draft.
Freeman also said that a statement will likely be for
mulated after the meeting.
"Our position is that we don't want to sway an indi
vidual; we want to see people introspect a bit, a high
quality debate, accurate information, hard questions.
we want to see people ask tough questions about what
this country is all about." he said.


Recent anti-draft rallies here have been duplicated on
college campuses across the country in the past two
weeks. Concern over the draft was rev ived by Presi-

dent Jimmy Carter's State of the Union address Jan
23, in which he called for renewal of registration.

sity of Pennsylvania, according to Wendy Lucas of the
Peace Action Committee (PAC).
Lucas described the general sentiment .it her school as
one of "fear and uncertainty," adding, "there seems to
be a lot of concern that we are not protecting the country
but rather forcing our will on somebody else." she said.
Lucas, a freshman Peace Science major, said "the
hardest thing for me to deal with is male friends of mine
who are really frightened and just don't know enough
about what is going on," she said.
Pennsylvania's anti-draft efforts have included de
bates, forums discussion sections and "legislative ef forts
aimed at Congressmen regarding anti-draft measures."
Again, Lucas noted that very active in the school's ,mti
draft efforts "are people who were forel'runners against
the Vietnam war," she said.
On campus here. Council of Presidents (COP)
member Sibby Freeman explained that the COP. the
ASSU Senate and the ASSIJ speakers Bureau will be
sponsoring a "town hall meeting" in Kresge Auditorium
on Feb. 12, featuring "speakers, communis figures,
professors and students with pro and con questions re
lated to the draft and registration, and also the relation
ship of women to the draft.
Freeman also said that a statement will likely be for
mulated after the meeting.
"Our position is that we don't want to sway an indi
vidual; we want to see people introspect a bit, a high
quality debate, accurate information, hard questions.
we want to see people ask tough questions about what
this country is all about." he said.


Recent anti-draft rallies here have been duplicated on
college campuses across the country in the past two
weeks. Concern over the draft was rev ived by Presi-

dent Jimmy Carter's State of the Union address Jan
23, in which he called for renewal of registration.
Emerging peace* committees and growing concerns
seem to best characterize the mood on college campuses
across the country in reaction to President Jimmy Car
ter's call for reactivation of the Selective Service Com
mission and. possibly, the draft.
A random survey of colleges nationwide shows a vari
ety ot activities and programs planned to protest draft
reinstatement, with little or no pro-draft sentiment on
the campuses contacted.
The largest single effort to date was a Jan. 25 rally at
the University of California Berkeley which drew an
estimated 2500 people.
Lee Trampleasurc of the Berkeley Students tor Peace
(BSP) told the crowd, "It's important for all to recognize
that registration is the first step towards the draft and
that the draft is a major step toward war."
However Cynthia Harrison of the Daily Cal cited a
poll indicating that 51 percent of the Berkeley students
would serve in the army if drafted. She suggested that
Cal "seems lairly conservative in comparison to some of
the other colleges." I or instance, said Harrison, a poll at
Illinois' Northwestern University indicated that only 2(1
percent of the students there would serve if drafted
"There is certainly not the same fervor as at the height
of the Vietnam war." she said.
Meanwhile, at Harvard, Nobel Prize Winner George
VV ikl spoke to about KOO people at an anti-draft rallv at
Whitner Library on Thursday night. The rally, endorsed
by presidential candidates Edward Kennedy and Jerry
Brown, was "particularly impressive because it is cur
rently 20 degrees below zero at Harvard," said Harvard
Crimson staffer Bill McKibben that night.
Other efforts at Harvard have included small rallies,
circulation ot a petition stating that the students would
not serve if drafted, and an editorial in the Crimson
denouncing both registration and the draft, said McKib
ben.
McKibben said that there were "a lot of old Vietnam
people" at most ol the rallies and anti-draft activities.
Similar activities have taken place at Yale, where
freshman Robert Glaser is national coordinator tor Na
tional Draft Information day to be held on Feb. 12.
The aims of the day — three days after Carter is to
present a bill concerning the draft to Congress —"is to
get people thinking about the draft and what it will
represent. We think information will help defeat the
draft rather than promote it." Glaser explained.
Other nationwide groups supporting the Draft Infor
mation Day are the Friends Peace Committee (1 PC),
the Central Committee for Conscientious Ob jectors and
the Committee Against Registration and the Draft
(CARD), a coalition .ol 42 peace, student, civil and
religious groups.
CARD is a lobbying committee with chapters at many

campuses which is "absolutely committed to an all-out
effort to prevent draft registration from being imposed
in this country," said spokesman Barry Lynn.
At Kent State, the site of a violent anti-war ptotest in
1970 in which the National Guard killed four students.
CARD has been organizing committees "focusing on
the individual and what they can do about getting on the
record early as conscientious objectors," said Mark
Lauffer of the Daily Kent Stater.
"There isn't much anyone can do about registration
right now but they want to get opposition in the air" said
Lauffer.
At Vale, Draft Information Day will take the form of a
"teach-in." featuring seminars on different aspects of
the draft and registration. There will be six to eight
speakers, including Reverend William Sloan Coffin, one
of the clergymen who visited the American hostages in
Iran last month.
Other universities, including Stanford, are also plan
ning activities on or around Feb. 12. UCLA, which lie-Id
a rally last week sponsored by Students for a L ibertarian
Society (no groups have as yet formed on campus speci
fically concerning the draft), plans a similar teach-in for
Feb. I 2 according to Donna Prokop of the Daily liruin
