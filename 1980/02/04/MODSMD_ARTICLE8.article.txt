KHYBER PASS Pakistan-
President Jimmy Carter's na
tional security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski peered resolutely
with gun in hand yesterday at
Sov iet : controlled Afghanistan
from the top of a Pakistan milit
ary outpost high above the geos
trategic Khyber Pass.
It looked like a scene from a
grade B movie. one that could be
called "Zbig at the Khyber Pass"
as the high White House aide
hesitated for a second and then
declined an offer to fire the
Chinese light machine-gun to
ward Afghanistan. Instead he in
\ited a Pakistani soldier at the
gunport to shoot the weapon.
The soldier got off one shot,
but then the gun jammed. After
clearing it.he squeezed off a fast
round. But the recoil knocked
the soldier back into Brzezinski.
and the gun started spraying bul
lets wildly out the gunport.
"Thank God the Russians ha
ven't starting firing back." com
mented a Pakistani officer ac
company the Brzezinski
tour.
The madcap scene at the old.
British-built picket post — really
a tiny, stone fort perched atop ol
a hillock 2 miles from the Afghan
border — climaxed a day's tour
of Pakistan's frontier designed to
send a firm signal that America
intends to stop any further Soviet
expansionist aims in this region

at the Pakistan border.
The visit here came just two
hours before Brzezinski went
back tor the second day of
closed-door meetings with the
Pakistanis in an attempt to forge
a new relationship for the sec
urity of this area.
Picket posts
Brzezinski asked to be taken
trom the Khyber Rifles officers'
mess in Landi Kotal to one of a
string of picket posts overlook
ing the Khyber Pass, the route of
invading armies since 1600 B.C.
when the Aryans moved down
from central Asia into what is
now India.
"This would be smashed right
away?" Brzezinski asked Lt.
Gen. Fazle Haq. the military
commander and civil governor of
the Northwest Frontier pro
vince.
"In the first engagement the
artillery would knock down all
these." Fazle said, pointing to
the post he was standing at and
others down the pass. "They are
all right for observation and for
keeping track of tribals. but not
for modern warfare."
Brzezinski clearly enjoyed the
chance to see first hand the fron
tier he has been talking about
Irom Washington since the
Soviets moved more than SO.OOO
troops into Afghanistan on Dec.
26.
Waist dagger
As he strode up the rocky hill
side to the picket post, he opened

his U.S. Army parka to show a
highly ornamental dagger stuck
in his waistband. The dagger, the
type used by tribesmen in this
area, had been presented to him
at lunch by Fazle.
Earlier Brzezinski walked
down a line of maleks — tribal
chiets — who each placed a gaT
land of flowers around his neck.
Before long Brzezinski. up to his
ears in flowers, quipped,
"Friendship is a heavy burden,
especially around the neck."
The tour started with an early
morning helicopter visit to a re
mote refugee camp in the Kur
ram Agency, a finger of Pakistan
that juts into Afghanistan half
way between Jalalabad and Gar
dez. The camp, known as Sad
da. is 12 miles from the Afghan
border.
The poorly clad refugees —
mostly old men. women and
children with no fighting-age
men visible — told Brzezinski
through a translator that they
had been driven from Af
ghanistan within the past six
months because the Soviet
dominated government had bro
ken their mosques, attacked
their mullahs (priests), de
stroyed their villages and at
tempted to change their funda
mental Islamic religious tradi
tions.
40 cents
They now live in tents with 40
cents a day to feed themselves.
One tribal leader acknowledged

that young men come and go ac
ross the open border to fight in
Afghanistan.
The top White House aide was
careful not to promise military
assistance to the rebels, but he
told them of America's support
for the efforts and said "the en
tire world is outraged," by the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, traveling in
the Brzezinski party, added.
"The American people admire
your fight for freedom and be
lieve in the long run you will
persevere."
As if rehearsed, the refugees
replied in chorus. "In'shallah"
(God willing.).

months because the Soviet

They now live in tents with 40
cents a day to feed themselves.
One tribal leader acknowledged

that young men come and go ac
ross the open border to fight in
Afghanistan.
The top White House aide was
careful not to promise military
assistance to the rebels, but he
told them of America's support
for the efforts and said "the en
tire world is outraged," by the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher, traveling in
the Brzezinski party, added.
"The American people admire
your fight for freedom and be
lieve in the long run you will
persevere."
As if rehearsed, the refugees
replied in chorus. "In'shallah"
(God willing.).

KHYBER PASS Pakistan-
President Jimmy Carter's na
tional security adviser Zbigniew
Brzezinski peered resolutely
with gun in hand yesterday at
Sov iet : controlled Afghanistan
from the top of a Pakistan milit
ary outpost high above the geos
trategic Khyber Pass.
It looked like a scene from a
grade B movie. one that could be
called "Zbig at the Khyber Pass"
as the high White House aide
hesitated for a second and then
declined an offer to fire the
Chinese light machine-gun to
ward Afghanistan. Instead he in
\ited a Pakistani soldier at the
gunport to shoot the weapon.
The soldier got off one shot,
but then the gun jammed. After
clearing it.he squeezed off a fast
round. But the recoil knocked
the soldier back into Brzezinski.
and the gun started spraying bul
lets wildly out the gunport.
"Thank God the Russians ha
ven't starting firing back." com
mented a Pakistani officer ac
company the Brzezinski
tour.
The madcap scene at the old.
British-built picket post — really
a tiny, stone fort perched atop ol
a hillock 2 miles from the Afghan
border — climaxed a day's tour
of Pakistan's frontier designed to
send a firm signal that America
intends to stop any further Soviet
expansionist aims in this region

at the Pakistan border.
The visit here came just two
hours before Brzezinski went
back tor the second day of
closed-door meetings with the
Pakistanis in an attempt to forge
a new relationship for the sec
urity of this area.
Picket posts
Brzezinski asked to be taken
trom the Khyber Rifles officers'
mess in Landi Kotal to one of a
string of picket posts overlook
ing the Khyber Pass, the route of
invading armies since 1600 B.C.
when the Aryans moved down
from central Asia into what is
now India.
"This would be smashed right
away?" Brzezinski asked Lt.
Gen. Fazle Haq. the military
commander and civil governor of
the Northwest Frontier pro
vince.
"In the first engagement the
artillery would knock down all
these." Fazle said, pointing to
the post he was standing at and
others down the pass. "They are
all right for observation and for
keeping track of tribals. but not
for modern warfare."
Brzezinski clearly enjoyed the
chance to see first hand the fron
tier he has been talking about
Irom Washington since the
Soviets moved more than SO.OOO
troops into Afghanistan on Dec.
26.
Waist dagger
As he strode up the rocky hill
side to the picket post, he opened

his U.S. Army parka to show a
highly ornamental dagger stuck
in his waistband. The dagger, the
type used by tribesmen in this
area, had been presented to him
at lunch by Fazle.
Earlier Brzezinski walked
down a line of maleks — tribal
chiets — who each placed a gaT
land of flowers around his neck.
Before long Brzezinski. up to his
ears in flowers, quipped,
"Friendship is a heavy burden,
especially around the neck."
The tour started with an early
morning helicopter visit to a re
mote refugee camp in the Kur
ram Agency, a finger of Pakistan
that juts into Afghanistan half
way between Jalalabad and Gar
dez. The camp, known as Sad
da. is 12 miles from the Afghan
border.
The poorly clad refugees —
mostly old men. women and
children with no fighting-age
men visible — told Brzezinski
through a translator that they
had been driven from Af
ghanistan within the past six
months because the Soviet
dominated government had bro
ken their mosques, attacked
their mullahs (priests), de
stroyed their villages and at
tempted to change their funda
mental Islamic religious tradi
