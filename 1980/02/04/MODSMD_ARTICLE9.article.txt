Iran has agreed to set up an
international commission that
will consider alleged crimes of
the deposed shah and "will be
effective in solving the hostage
crisis," a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said yesterday .
Establishment of the commis
sion, proposed by U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim. has been approved by
Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini as well as the rul
ing Revolutionary Council, said
the Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Wassirosadat Salami.
A spokesman for the militants,
reached by telephone at the em
bassy, said he was aware of the
council's decision, announced
Saturday night, but declined
immediate comment. A state

ment might he issued later, the
spokesman for the militants said.
Yesterday was the 92nd day of
captivity for approximately 50
Americans held by Islamic milit
ants at the U.S. Embassy since it
was seized Nov. 4. Three other
U.S. diplomats have heen held
since then under virtual house
arrest by the Foreign Ministry.
The militants have said re
peatedly they will not release the
hostages until deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. living
in Panama, is returned by the
United States to stand trial on
charges of corruption and mass
murder.
The Foreign Ministry spokes
man did not say when the com
mission would come to Tehran,
nor when hearings would begin.
Its members would be selected

by Waldheim and would include
Iranian and foreign representa
tives, Salami said.
He said it would be Wal
dheim's decision whether to in
clude U.S. representatives
among the group. He refused to
comfirm or deny reports that
Waldheim soon would visit Iran.
Added the Foreign Ministry
spokesman: "The international
commission will be effective in
solving the hostage crisis."
News of the commission came
late Saturday following a lengthy
meeting of Iran's ruling Re
volutionary Council. After the
session, council spokesman Has
san Habibi said "the interna
tional investigation commission
will consider the shah's crimes,
his violation of human rights and
the return of his wealth to Iran."
