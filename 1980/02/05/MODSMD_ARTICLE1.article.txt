# Black Liberation Month commences
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
"Racism is alive and well," said
Keith Naylor, director of the Black
Community Services Center, at a noon
rally held here yesterday to commence
Black Liberation Month.
He and two other speakers, addres
sing a crowd of 150 assembled in White
Plaza, presented their views on why
Black Liberation Month is needed.
"People are unaware of the basic
facts about black troubles around the
world," Naylor said.
The month is intended to "focus at
tention on black struggles around the
world," he noted. In addition, it is
hoped that the month will encourage
"involvement and solidarity with sur
rounding black groups" and the Stan
ford community.
"The rich history of artistic contribu
tion to the world scene" by black artists
will be another area of emphasis during
Black Liberation Month, Naylor ad
ded.
"Blacks are not liberated," said
Kenneth Nunn. head of the Black
Pre-Law Society.
The month should be the "prepara
tion for the struggle for liberation," he
said. It is called the month of black
liberation as opposed to black history
or awareness month because "we are
fighting forour liberation," Nunn said.
It also should be a "celebration of
black pride," he said. It is a time for
blacks to say "we are proud to be
black," he added.

Nunn cited recent incidents of racial
violence in this country as evidence to
support his claims that blacks are not
liberated.
Blacks on campus must become
more active in furthering their special
interests, he said. They "should de
mand a say-so in the selection process"
for a replacement of outgoing Presi
dent Richard Lyman. Nunn said.
He accused the administration of
"window dressing" by hiring black ad
ministrators but keeping them from
decision-making positions. He also
claimed that black positions are being
systematically phased out.
Sylvia Wyntcr, chairperson of tho
African and Afro-American studies
program, said that "students must
change the way we think about the way
we live."
"Don't imagine that there are vil
lains doing things to blacks," she said.
She called for blacks to "break out of
that way of thinking."
There is an old saying, she said, that
"every nigger needs a nigger." In ghet
tos where there are no whites to op
press blacks directly, "niggers kill nig
gers," she said.
"We must find and fight for a social
order in which no one needs a nigger,"
she said.
We will only survive if we learn to
respect one another, she said. "It is for
us now to learn to control the social
system that has allowed us to come to
the brink of destroying ourselves,"
Wynter concluded.
