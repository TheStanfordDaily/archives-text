## More OPEC nations boost prices 
### 
NEW YOKK (AP) - Three
members ol the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries
announeed price increases of up
to $4.21 a barrel yesterday, rais
ing to 10 the number of cartel
countries to boost crude oil
prices since late January.
The three countries announc
ing increases — Nigeria. Algeria
and Indonesia — provide about
I I percent of U.S. oil needs. Im
ports Irom OPEC account for
about 30 percent of the nation's
oil supply. The United States

imports half its oil.
The latest moves, which had
been expected, increased
Nigeria's price tor a 42-gallon
barrel of oil by $4.21 to $34.21,
Indonesia's by $2 to $29.50. and
Algeria's by $4.21 to $37.21. the
highest posted price in the cartel.
"They're getting their July 1
increases in early this year." Eck
said of the OPEC members'
price increases.
The round of increases began
Jan. 28 when Saudi Arabia

boosted its crude oil price by $2
to $26 a barrel, in what analysts
said was an apparent bid to bring
a comparatively cheap $24 Saudi
price in line with others in the
I 3-nation cartel.
Iraq. Iran and other OPEC
members then started raising
prices on their own. despite fore
casts that' oil consumption will
drop this year as the U.S.
economy slows, and leasing
Saudi Arabia again as the
lowest-priced member of the

cartel.
OPEC's oil ministers, at their
conference in Caracas. Ven
ezuela. last December, tailed to
agree on a unified oil price struc
ture tor the cartel, leaving each
member free to charge whatever
it wished.
But analysts said Saudi Arabia
may yet be able to enforce the
price discipline in OPEC that it
has not been able to accomplish
for nearly a year.
The Saudis produce 9.5 mill
ion barrels of oil a day, nearly
one-third of OPECs output, and
could maintain its production
rather than cut back despite
slackening demand.
According to Eck. "politics
would dictate (the Saudis) not
starving the world at a time when
Russian tanks are threatening
the Middle East oilfields. If
Saudi Arabia continues above
nine million barrels a day my
guess is that it will be very dif
ficult for OPEC to effect addi
tional increases."
