BANGKOK, Thailand (AP)
— Organizers of the so-called
"March for Survival" to get pub
licity for the plight of the Cam
bodian people yesterday aban
doned plans to try to carry food
into Cambodia and will instead
hold a rally on a bridge at the
Thai-Cambodian frontier.
Robert DeVecchi of the In
ternational Rescue Committee,
a spokesman for the marchers,
said 20 truckloads of supplies
they hoped to deliver inside
Cambodia would be handed over
to the Thai Red Cross for dis
tribution to Cambodian re
fugees.
DeVecchi said. "We had no
intention of crossing into Cam
bodia without a positive re
sponse to our requests to Phnom
Penh. We have had no direct re
spons6 from them, and we con
sider that this amounts to a re
fusal."
Despite the change in plans,
he said, up to 150 international
celebrities, social activists and
politicians plan to spend three
days near the border, visiting re
fugee camps and publicizing the
problem of hunger in Cambodia.
The group changed its plans
because the Vietnamese-backed

Cambodian government in
Phnom Penh said they would not
be allowed to cross the border
and because of increased 112 ighting
between the Vietnamese army
and the Khmer Rouge guerrillas
just inside Cambodia near the
Thai border.
The Thai military command
met yesterday to draw up con
tingency plans in case the fight
ing endangered the marchers.
Among participants who ar
rived are American singer Joan
Baez, Norwegian actress Liv
L'llnian. Sir Winston Churchill's
grandson and namesake, who is a
member of the British Parlia
ment. and U.S. civil rights ac
tivist Bayard Rustin.
Folk singer Baez told a news
conference on the eve of the
march. "If the remainder of the
Cambodian race is not allowed
to sun ive, it will not be through a
lack of food, medicine, love,
compassion. We are here. We
care."
A number of participants
placed the blame for Cambodia's
current woes on Vietnam and the
Phnom Penh regime because
they had not allowed Western
medical teams into a country de
sperately short of doctors and

have limited the channels
through which food and other
aid could be brought in.
One of the main coordinators
of the Cambodian aid program
said Monday "disaster has been
averted" for the time being but a
decisive period of food shortages
is still to come.
James Grant, the new execu
tive director of the United Na
tions Children's Fund, spoke at a
press conference in Bangkok
after returning from a six-day
trip through Cambodia. He said
he was "pleasantly surprised by
the extent of relief taking place."
Unicef. along with the Inter
national Red Cross and the
World Food Program, is coor
dinating a worldwide six-month
SISO million aid program that
began in October and has
reached its half-way point.
Phnom Penh has criticized the
"March for Survival" as an at
tempt to interfere in Cambodia's
internal affairs.
Responding to crificism that
the march was a publicity stunt.
Norwegian actress Liv Ullman
said. "I left my celebrity behind
me. I'm here as a human being.
I'm here as a woman. I'm here as
a mother. I'm very frustrated
over the criticism."
