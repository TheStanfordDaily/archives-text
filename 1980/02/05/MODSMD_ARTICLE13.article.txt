# Observers predict Afghan regime changes

KABUL, Afghanistan — Western diplomats
here confidently predict a new Afghan regime
within six months in view of the chasm-like divi
sions with n the nurrent ruling faction.
Plots, revenge and killings run through
political life here with the complexity and
frequency of the patterns of Afghanistan's
famed carpets on sale in the bazaar.
Three Revolutionary Council members.
Gen. Abdul Qader. Deputy Premier Sultan
Ali Kishthand and Defense Minister Col.
Mohammed Rafie were all jailed under the
previous regime of Nur Mohammed Taraki.
Three other members of the present
cabinet reportedly stood by and watched
them go: council member Col. Mohammed
Watanjar, Transport Minister Sherjan Maz
dooryar and Interior Minister Saved
Mohammed Gulabzoi. A fourth council
member. Deputy Premier Assadullah Sar
wari, was secret police chief at the time, so
must have known what had happened.
With such a pedigree, cabinet unity has to
be hard to achieve. Western observers noted.
Divisions within the Marxist movement,
chiefly between the Khalq (People)and Par
cham (Banner) factions, are the root cause,
despite Taraki's attempt to group them to
gether under the People's Democratic Party
of Afghanistan when he overthrew Moham
med Daud on April 27, 1978.
The country's present ruler. Babrak Kar

mal, 50. is no more than a Soviet figurehead
and commands little following in the country.
He was shunted into a quiet diplomatic post,
as envoy to Czechoslovakia, under the
Taraki regime.
He was a favorite of the intellectuals here
before he came to power. But his reappear
ance on the political scene on Dec. 27 on the
wave of advancing Russian tanks has wiped
out any advantage he could have claimed.
The question of who will replace him is the
most widely discussed topic in Kabul today,
assuming that Moscow will allow Karmal to
fall.
A favorite is Qader. a former defense
minister, who was reportedly tortured under
the regime of Hafizullah Amin. This fact
alone gives him some measure of popularity.
But Qader. in his late 40s, has lost much of
his popularity simply by associating with the
Karmal regime. The general is reported to
have told students not long ago in a moment
of indiscretion that he had a hand in two of
Afghanistan's recent coups and was quite
ready to take part in a third.
Assadullah Sarwari's name has also been
mentioned, but most observers consider him
an outside choice because of his secret-police
past.
Defense Minister Mohammed Rafie's key
ministerial post gives him the right to be
counted, since anyone with the Soviet ear has
a distinct advantage over his colleagues.
But whatever changes take place, the fun
damental problem for the regime remains

how to win over the Moslem population to
what is a Marxist regime following in the
"martyred" footsteps of Taraki, who
launched the country on its revolution in
1978 and unleashed the present rebellion.
Some Afghans do not rule out the possibil
ity of Moscow'sserching for an "acceptable"
Moslem to put in as a figurehead prime
minister, but the fact that such a man would
be acceptable to Moscow would make him
unacceptable to his countrymen, they argue.
The Karmal regime has made some con
cessions to the Moslem community, which
makes up nine-tenths of the country's 15
million population. Radio communiques are
now preceded by the traditional moslem
phrase. "In the name of Allah, the compas
sionate and merciful."
The national red flag, introduced by
Taraki and widely hated, is to be changed,
and it is a safe bet that the Islamic color green
will be incorporated in a new one.
Last weekend the regime ordered all "lef
tist" slogans taken down or painted out and
also ordered all photographs of past heads of
state — and the present one — tobe removed
from public and private buildings.
The twin moves were welcomed, but with
an Islamic Alliance for the Liberation of Af
ghanistan now formed outside the country's
borders, resistance to the regime has taken
solid root, and cosmetic surgery will not save
the day.
