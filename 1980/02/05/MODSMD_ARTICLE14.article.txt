# Yugoslavs bolster non-aligned camp

BELGRADE, Yugoslavia —
The Yugoslav government is plan
ning two quiet diplomatic re
sponses to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan in an effort to
strengthen the non-aligned nations
at a time when they seem most vul
nerable.
At the United Nations, Yugos
lavia wants to revive efforts to
adopt a resolution reaffirming
the organization's unqualified
opposition to intervention by
any nation in the affairs of
another. Within the non-aligned
movement, Yugoslavia wants to
reactivate the Coordinating
Bureau, to broaden the base of
power so narrowly held since
September by Cuba, whose rep
resentative is chairman for the
current three-year period.
When President JosipTito was

critically ill with a circulatory
problem that led to the amputa
tion of his left leg. officials made
a special point of reaffirming
Yugoslavia's permanent com
mitment to the policy of non
alignment. This clearly went
beyond lip service to Tito, the
last surviving founder of the
non-aligned movement.
"Non-alignment remains the
main force in our foreign pol
icy," a Yugoslav affirmed.
Despite the shock of events in
Afghanistan, Yugoslav leaders
remain convinced that only
through non-alignment can the
small nations, along with those
that are not so small, preserve
their national security in a world
dominated by superpowers.
Characteristic posture
Even after the invasion of Af
ghanistan, Yugoslav officials
maintained in public and in pri
vate their characteristic posture
of finding things to criticize
about the West as well as the
East.
One Yugoslav, whose anger
toward Moscow after the Af
ghanistan invasion was well
known, refused nevertheless to
respond directly when asked his
views. First he brought up the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion proposal for new nuclear
weapons in Western Europe.

Then he assailed as unacceptable
the Soviet action in Afghanistan.
Finally he turned to Southeast
Asia, recalling the U.S. action in
Vietnam and noting that the
Chinese had at least kept their
promise to withdraw when they
invaded Vietnam last year.
Officials appear to have taken
some satisfaction that only nine
of the non-aligned nations, by
their count, voted with Moscow
on the Afghanistan resolution in
the United Nations. It is also
noted that 56 of the non-aligned.
Yugoslavia among them, voted
to condemn the invasion.
Cuba's vote with Moscow is
quietly described as a question of
"national consideration out
weighing non-aligned policy."
But that makes it no easier to
rally the non-aligned in an effort
to avoid further Afghanistans,
because the split placed the
chairman of the movement.
Fidel Castro, among the minor
ity.
Non-alignment alive
There is an insistence,
nevertheless, that the non
aligned movement, 19 years
after its first summit conference
here in Belgrade, is not dead.
The matter is complicated for
the Yugoslav leadership by the
Soviet move against Andrei
Sakharov, who was sent off into

internal exile last month. The
raising of the human rights ques
tion is an embarrassment in a na
tion that still restricts the rights
of its citizens and has extensive
repressi\ e machinery on standby
in the event of serious dissent.
Yugoslavia is not yet a democ
racy.
Yugoslav officials are under
stood to regard President Jimmy
Carter's emphasis on human
rights as a failed policy and to
regard the Sakharov affair as "a
small event without any impor
tance in global strategic terms."
Yugoslavs appeared to be
gratified by the nuances of dif
ference they perceived in the re
sponses from four bloc nations
— Romania, Hungary, Poland
and East Germany — to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Only Bulgaria and Czechos
lovakia, it was said here have to
tally embraced the Soviet move.
Little compensation
But that was faint compensa
tion for Yugoslavs who saw in
the invasion of a non-aligned na
tion a major setback to the policy
so carefully constructed bv Tito.
In the months ahead the
Yugoslavs will have an oppor
tunity to find our how many in
the U.N. General Assembly and
how many in the non-aligned
movement share their anxieties.
