# Semester-at-Sea trip broadens students' horizons
## 
### Michelle Vaughen Staff Writer 
The real learning isn't in the
classroom for Cheryl Johnson,
John Staenberg and other stu
dents who go to school while
traveling.
Johnson and Staenberg par
ticipated last fall in a 3'/2-month
Semester at Sea academic prog
ram in which they took classes
while traveling around the world
on a cruise ship.

Second of two parts

The program, which is ad
ministered by the Institute for
Shipboard Education in Laguna
Hills, Calif., is academically
sponsored by the University of
Colorado at Boulder. Students
take four out of a possible 60
classes. They pay $8000 to take
part.
Staenberg's two favorite clas
ses, Economics of Development
and Urban Economics,
examined such situations as exist
in the Furvellas, a poverty stric
ken community in Brazil which
Staenberg likens to Harlem of
the United States.
Following their studies, the
students visited the area, and
were able to experience
firsthand what they had read in
textbooks.
"After each port we'd discuss
what we had seen and the de
velopment chances ofeach coun
try," said Staenberg. "You learn
so much more that way. Instead
of saying, 'God, these people are
really poor,' you're interested in
why they are poor and how they
could get ahead."
Understanding?
Similarly, Johnson found her
course in African history to be
most helpful in understanding

the ongoing elections in Kenya.
"You really felt like you al
ready had a hold on the country
after having studied it — that you
had some identity with it," she
said.
Classes on board the 560 -foot
ship were small in size, ranging
from 20 to 30 students. They
were informally conducted and
generally "easier than Stanford"
in terms of workload and
academic pressure, according to

both Johnson and Staenberg.
Semester at Sea's adminis
trators. however, are trying to
upgrade and stress the academic
aspect of the program, said
Johnson.
"They want to be looked
upon, first and foremost, as a
floating academic campus," he
said, "and not just a big party"
bearing such nicknames as
"mattress-a-float" and "booze
cruise."

In an effort to discourage
those students solely interested
in a leisure cruise, the administ
ration expelled a student from
the trip who had not attended
any of his classes, said Staenberg.
Two other students were also
expelled for possession of drugs,
he said.
Contract
Although students sign a con
tract giving the administration
the right to dismiss them for vio
lating any of the program's regu
lations, the students denounced
these administrative actions in
public hearings held on board,
said Staenberg.
Relations between the ad
ministration and students con
tinued to deteriorate as unan
nounced room searches were
made, according to Staenberg.
These kinds of student prob
lems, including the "China scan
dal," could have been avoided
with a more careful process of
student selection, involving per
sonal interviews to "weed out
the people who ended up being
trouble areas," said Johnson.
'China scandal'
The "China scandal" in
volved some 15 Semester-at-Sea
students who threw bottle roc
kets into a Cantonese hotel plaza
late one night, explained
Johnson.
They happened to be spotted
by a Los Angeles Times reporter
who wrote a derogatory article
entitled, "American Students
Use Disco Diplomacy in China."
The students reponsible for the
incident were consequently dis
missed from the program.
Aside from these few prob
lems, most of the trip was smooth
sailing. Students had a variety of
leisure activities to choose from
while not in classes, including
volleyball, swimming, happy

hours, movies, plays, talent
shows and discussion groups.
Major effect
Both Staenberg and Johnson
said the entire 100-day experi
ence has significantly affected
their general world outlook, as
well as their future plans.
"I came here wanting to be
come a businessman and make a
million dollars," said Staenberg.
"Those goals aren't as important
to me anymore.
"Many of the people (on the
trip) went with an egocentric
view that the United States is the
way things should be done. But
that's not the way it is in other
countries, and it's important to
understand why.
"1 came away with some un
derstanding, but I'm by no
means an expert," he said. "And
1 really want to go back and find

out a lot more."
In a similar manner, Johnson's
interests and perspectives have
changed as a result of the trip. -
"Before, I had absolutely no
interest in politics and would al
ways skip the front page of the
newspaper," she said. "Now I
want to learn more about poli
tics, especially in China and
South Africa.
"It seems kind of corny to say,
but you really do develop a world
view," she continued. "Being
born and raised in the United
States, you think of the U.S. as
being 'it.' Then you realize that
there are all these countries and
people that exist and they
couldn't care less about the Unf
ited States. You're no big deal.
"Thinking back to a realiza
tion like that does really change
your way of looking at yourself
and the world.," she added.

"I came here wanting to be
come a businessman and make a
million dollars," said Staenberg.
"Those goals aren't as important
to me anymore.
"Many of the people (on the
trip) went with an egocentric
view that the United States is the
way things should be done. But
that's not the way it is in other
countries, and it's important to
understand why.
"1 came away with some un
derstanding, but I'm by no
means an expert," he said. "And
1 really want to go back and find

out a lot more."
In a similar manner, Johnson's
interests and perspectives have
changed as a result of the trip. -
"Before, I had absolutely no
interest in politics and would al
ways skip the front page of the
newspaper," she said. "Now I
want to learn more about poli
tics, especially in China and
South Africa.
"It seems kind of corny to say,
but you really do develop a world
view," she continued. "Being
born and raised in the United
States, you think of the U.S. as
being 'it.' Then you realize that
there are all these countries and
people that exist and they
couldn't care less about the Unf
ited States. You're no big deal.
"Thinking back to a realiza
tion like that does really change
your way of looking at yourself
and the world.," she added.

The real learning isn't in the
classroom for Cheryl Johnson,
John Staenberg and other stu
dents who go to school while
traveling.
Johnson and Staenberg par
ticipated last fall in a 3'/2-month
Semester at Sea academic prog
ram in which they took classes
while traveling around the world
on a cruise ship.

Second of two parts

The program, which is ad
ministered by the Institute for
Shipboard Education in Laguna
Hills, Calif., is academically
sponsored by the University of
Colorado at Boulder. Students
take four out of a possible 60
classes. They pay $8000 to take
part.
Staenberg's two favorite clas
ses, Economics of Development
and Urban Economics,
examined such situations as exist
in the Furvellas, a poverty stric
ken community in Brazil which
Staenberg likens to Harlem of
the United States.
Following their studies, the
students visited the area, and
were able to experience
firsthand what they had read in
textbooks.
"After each port we'd discuss
what we had seen and the de
velopment chances ofeach coun
try," said Staenberg. "You learn
so much more that way. Instead
of saying, 'God, these people are
really poor,' you're interested in
why they are poor and how they
could get ahead."
Understanding?
Similarly, Johnson found her
course in African history to be
most helpful in understanding

the ongoing elections in Kenya.
"You really felt like you al
ready had a hold on the country
after having studied it — that you
had some identity with it," she
said.
Classes on board the 560 -foot
ship were small in size, ranging
from 20 to 30 students. They
were informally conducted and
generally "easier than Stanford"
in terms of workload and
academic pressure, according to

both Johnson and Staenberg.
Semester at Sea's adminis
trators. however, are trying to
upgrade and stress the academic
aspect of the program, said
Johnson.
"They want to be looked
upon, first and foremost, as a
floating academic campus," he
said, "and not just a big party"
bearing such nicknames as
"mattress-a-float" and "booze
cruise."

In an effort to discourage
those students solely interested
in a leisure cruise, the administ
ration expelled a student from
the trip who had not attended
any of his classes, said Staenberg.
Two other students were also
expelled for possession of drugs,
he said.
Contract
Although students sign a con
tract giving the administration
the right to dismiss them for vio
lating any of the program's regu
lations, the students denounced
these administrative actions in
public hearings held on board,
said Staenberg.
Relations between the ad
ministration and students con
tinued to deteriorate as unan
nounced room searches were
made, according to Staenberg.
These kinds of student prob
lems, including the "China scan
dal," could have been avoided
with a more careful process of
student selection, involving per
sonal interviews to "weed out
the people who ended up being
trouble areas," said Johnson.
'China scandal'
The "China scandal" in
volved some 15 Semester-at-Sea
students who threw bottle roc
kets into a Cantonese hotel plaza
late one night, explained
Johnson.
They happened to be spotted
by a Los Angeles Times reporter
who wrote a derogatory article
entitled, "American Students
Use Disco Diplomacy in China."
The students reponsible for the
incident were consequently dis
missed from the program.
Aside from these few prob
lems, most of the trip was smooth
sailing. Students had a variety of
leisure activities to choose from
while not in classes, including
volleyball, swimming, happy

hours, movies, plays, talent
shows and discussion groups.
Major effect
Both Staenberg and Johnson
said the entire 100-day experi
ence has significantly affected
their general world outlook, as
well as their future plans.
"I came here wanting to be
come a businessman and make a
million dollars," said Staenberg.
