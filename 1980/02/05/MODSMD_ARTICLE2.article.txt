# Campus annexation considered unlikely
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
After more than nine years of con
sideration. the issue of Stanford's an
nexation by the City of Palo Alto is still
undecided. But indications of the
proposal's defeat have begun to
emerge.
"All indicators point to an un
-â– uconomic situation should Palo Alto
try to annex Stanford," concludes the
latest city staff report. The report,
submitted in early January, outlines
several factors that have changed since
the initial study was completed in 1971.
Crediting the staff with an accurate
assessment of new problems with the
proposed annexation, Councilmem
ber Frances Brenner maintains that
the conclusions "don't resolve the
awkward problem of an island of unin
corporated land.
"There is nothing so special about a
university that it shouldn't belong to a
city," Brenner said. She added she feels
that the city and the University ought
to cooperate over the proposed anne
xation and work to solve the complica
tions.

"If you're trying to make a partner
ship, the costs can be mediated," she
said.
"I think it's an issue of the city having
control over Stanford's land-use
policies," said Naphtali Knox, city
planning director. "On the other side
of the coin, it will cost the city too much
for the privilege of that control. We'd
have to take over all the municipal ser
vices at an enormous cost and there are
a hell of a lot of acres out there," he
added.
A comprehensive study was done by
the city staff in 1971 at the request of
the University to annex the proposed
Frenchman's Terrace, a 225 low- to
moderate-income housing develop
ment near the end of Mayfield Avenue.
Concurrent with the University's move
was an effort by Stanford faculty and
staff residents to research the issues
surrounding annexation of the faculty/
staff housing as a whole.
But the enthusiasm has apparently
died down.
"It's a different ball game now that
Jarvis-Gann has passed," said Bob
Summers, manager of faculty/staff

housing here. "There aren't signs
among residents on campus of a great
deal of interest toward annexation. The
University isn't advocating annexation,
but wouldn't oppose it if the homeow
ners wanted it,"he added.
The* University's primary concern
was a possible "piecemeal" annexation
encompassing only the Peter Coutts
developments near Page Mill Road.
The University's position has consis
tently stipulated that either all or none
of the faculty/staff residences would be
considered. A broader consideration
addressed the question of annexing the
entire campus.
A comprehensive annexation would
give students voting rights in Palo Alto,
"an issue fought by some councilmem
bers," said Gary Fazzino, Palo Alto
councilmember and Stanford alumnus.

"If someone lives in a place, they
should be entitled to vote," he added.
Fazzino noted that one-third of Palo
Alto's residents "turn over" each year
and that the student's transience would
not increase the migrant voting popula
tion.
Brenner shared Fazzino's attitude
tov/ard student participation in city de
cisions.
"I don't view it as a threat. I doubt if
they'd come out in great hordes at elec
tions . . . they're quite as responsible as
their parents," she said.
Other considerations studied by the
city included the cost of providing
municipal services to the University.
Additionally, Palo Alto currently
owns it's own utilities and would have
to purchase the University lines from
PG&E and then connect the systems.
