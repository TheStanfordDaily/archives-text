# Gas plan proposed

The Los Angeles Times
WASHINGTON — The av
erage driver would receive a
gasoline allotment of 40 to 42
gallons a month and could buy
additional fuel for $2.70 a gallon
under an emergency federal ra
tioning plan that President
Jimmy Carter will send to Con
gress next month, Department of
Energy officials said last week.
The average American driver
now uses approximately 60 gal
lons of gasoline a month, but the
plan would not go into effect un
less U.S. supplies dropped 20
percent below normal.
The plan, which must be ap
proved by Congress, would take
up to 21 months to fine-tune and
implement if the government fol
lows normal operating proce
dures, said Hazel Rollins, head
of the Economic Regulatory
Administration in the Depart
ment of Energy, which is writing
the rationing plan.
If Carter ordered an all-out ef
fort, she said, it would still re
quire seven to nine months to
develop the complex system for
allocating gasoline.
Once Congress approves the
president's standby plan, it

would have another chance to
block the imposition of rationing
itself. The president could de
clare his intention to ration
gasoline if supplies appear likely
to fall 20 percent below the pre
vious year's level, but either
house of Congress could block it.
Because the rationing plan
could not be activated in time for
any abrupt cut-off of oil imports
that might trigger a gasoline
shortage, the Department of
Energy is preparing a "quick and
dirty" program to restrict fuel
use, Rollins noted.
Such a program might include
a national odd-even system re
stricting gasoline purchases by
license plates, stickers requiring
a car to be off the road one day a
week, or a request to Congress
for fast passage of a major in
crease in the federal tax on
gasoline, according to Depart
ment of Energy officials.
The need for rationing is "a
real possibility, not fanciful, not
unthinkable any longer," Sen. J.
Bennett Johnston, (D-La.), the
subcommittee chairman said.
"We simply must move faster. If
you need more personnel, we
will give you more personnel."
