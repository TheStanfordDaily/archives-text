## Distribution requirements no solution 
### 
Stanford's concern over the
trend toward increasing
academic narrow-mindedness,
shown in its overhaul of Univer
sity distribution requirements, is
encouraging. However, I feel
that the action taken will fail to
significantly alleviate the prob
lem.
It is important to recognize
that undergraduate specializa
tion is no accident. Students con
sciously choose classes based on
their perceived relative value,
and courses outside one's prim
ary field of interest tend to as
sume a secondary priority.
There are good reasons for
this. First, pre-professional stu
dents easily fall prey to the
philosophy that each class mat
ters not so much for what it con
tains, but for how it will look on
future applications. Pre-med is a
cliche, yet a startling example.
The AIC lists 74-82 units (de
pending on whether one takes
the biology core or the human
biology core) that one needs to
complete before going to medi
cal school, preferably by one's
junior year (to have them
finished before the MCAT).
With such a science load that
does not lead to a degree, it's
easy to see why many pre-meds
feel they don't have time to
branch out and explore new
academic horizons.
But the biggest block to a
well-rounded schedule, espe
cially for freshmen, may well
be ignorance of the plethora of
opportunities here. There are
about 60 departments (not in
cluding the law. business and
medical schools) teaching prob
ably more than 3000 classes, plus
extra-departmental offerings
(e.g. SWOPSI, SCIRE. ARLO.
UGS. UPSE and LAC) that

would add around another 150
choices to be considered. Most
students are not even aware of
the 60 departments, much less
the 3150 or so classes, and
chances are pretty good that they
won't register for them.
New distribution require
ments, however, do not address
these problems. They offer no
new flexibility to pre
professionals or to those who
wish to make themselves as at
tractive as possible to graduate
schools, nor do they inform stu
dents of often-overlooked or
esoteric academic possibilities.
Rather, they present new dif
ficulties of their own. Instead of
being viewed as a tool to help
garner a more valuable educa
tion. they are too often consi
dered an annoyance that must be
dealt with as expeditiously as
possible.
Bear in mind that a "liberal
education" is a very arbitrarily
defined thing. Using existing re
quirements, listening to Bach is
"liberal." while performing his
works is not; reading Goethe in
English is "liberal." but learning
the language in which he wrote is
not; studying what famous artists
have created is "liberal," but
practicing the techniques they
mastered is not. In fact, not a
single studio art. musical per
formance. first-year language,
extra-departmental, athletic or
urban studies course is recog
nized as contributing to a "lib
eral education."
Curiously, the University's
paternal attitude toward our
eduction is inconsistent with its
purported belief that we are re
sponsible young adults. As one
Stanford publication puts it;
"Not long ago, college adminis
trators looked upon themselves

as substitute parents with paren
tal responsibilities for the stu
dents while they were at college.
This is no longer the case at Stan
ford. where very few rules are
placed on students in either the
residences or the classrooms.
The University assumes maturity
on the part of its students." I find
such an outlook incompatible
with detailed academic regula
tions.
Fortunately, where distribu
tion requirements cannot deal
with the underlying enemies of a
well-rounded education, we
have a system available to us that
can; one that suffers from none
of the drawbacks that distribu
tion requirements inherently en
tail. The solution is a stronger
advising system, particularly for
freshmen.
Someone familiar with Stan
ford and the problems under
graduates often encounter can
suggest alternate classes and
sequences for those who feel
bound to a set course schedule.
More importantly, a good ad
viser or advising team can justify
pursuing a truly "liberal" educa
tion, and can help each advisee
decide what the best approach
for him or her is.
I know from my experience as
an advising associate that
people choose their classes care
fully, and a sound argument in
favor of broadening out is effec
tive in preventing terminal
specialization. The key is infor
mation: those who are aware of
all their options and the com
parative advantages and disad
vantages of each will act with
much more foresight than will
those who are uninformed of the
possible paths available to them.
Surveys of Stanford graduates
show that they regret the

academic tunnel-vision of their
undergraduate years. The same
surveys, however, find academic
advising to have been the worst
aspect of their education. 1 con
tend that that is no coincidence;
rectifying the situation that gives
rise to the latter complaint will
go a long way toward eliminating
the former. A strong advising
system that can justify a liberal
education and show students
how to achieve one without
jeopardizing their career aspira
tions will prove to be much more
effective in encouraging a well
rounded study plan than will any
set of guidelines, no matter how
carefully drawn up they are.
