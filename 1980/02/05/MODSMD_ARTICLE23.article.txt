Visa card rip-off
The Stanford Federal Credit
Union, while ottering othersise
excellent benefits and serices —
has begun offering us Visa credit
cards that include a significant
ringer.
They charge interest im
mediately rather than allowing
the cardholder most of a month
after receipt of the statement in
which to pay the charges without
interest.
This is a "ringer" because 1) it
is different from the "custom"
with Visa and Mastercharge
cards, and 2) it is clearly stated
only in the fine print of a full
page of their legalistic fine print.
Even there, the clarity leaves
much to be desired.
When I discovered this (upon
receiving my first statement —
and interest charges), I
suggested to them that their
"immediate interest charge"
should have been more clearly
emphasized in the publicity an
nouncing their offering of Visa
cards. To this, they replied, "Oh,
we do," and sent me a copy of the
legal-eagle fine print.
Since they are choosing not to
amply publicize their unusual
Visa card charging algorithm to
the community they serve, I am
writing this letter to offer it a bit
more exposure. Incidently,
they did offer ample publicity of
the fact that they only charge 12

percent interest, rather then the
usual 18 percent charged by
banks. Thus, for those who
habitually pay interest charges
on their credit cards, the SFCU
Visa card is beneficial — maybe
— 12 percent beginning im
mediately, rather than 18 per
cent a month down the road. (Of
course, the 12 percent and 18
percent are annual rates.)

Harvard emulaton
Stanford's new required
courses have received a great
deal of attention in the Daily and
other area papers. It seems that
every time I read about them.
Harvard's similar action is
brought up.
Since I've been here, I've
noticed a preoccupation with
"keeping up with Harvard" a
number of times. The fact that
Harvard has done something
does not make it right for Stan
ford; this university should de
cide issues based on its own goals
and ideals of education.
The fanfare over the return to
mandatory courses by the big
name schools has ignored the
existence of many fine smaller
colleges which have stuck to ex
tensive requirements all along.
For example, St. Louis Uni
versity requires the following
(out of 120 hours to graduate):
three fine arts, three math, six

literature, six history, six social
science, six natural science, nine
philosophy, nine theology and
10 to 12 foreign language. 1
found such a wide-ranging cur
riculum extremely valuable, and
I'm sure future Stanford students
will too — even those in "pre
professional" programs.

Caps and Gowns
The administration of the
University is preparing to order
caps and gowns for this year's
commencement ceremonies
from a New York company, Cot
rell & Leonard, which is under
investigation by the National
Labor Relations Board (NJ RB)
for unfair labor practices.
The employees of Cotrell &
Leonard have been on strike
since August 8, 1979. The strike
is being supported by Local No.
163 of the International Ladies'
Garment Workers' Union
(ILGWU). AFL-CIO.
Cotrell & Leonard have
waged a persistent war against
union organization in their
shops. The NLRB complaint re
ports threats of closing the shop
if workers choose to organize into
the ILGWU; interrogation of
employees and surveillance of
union activities; threatening of
employees on strike and
threatening of suspected union
sypathizers during the hiring
process.
It would be ironic and disturb
ing if the Stanford graduates
were to celebrate their passing
into the world of work by wear
ing caps and gowns made by
women earning $2.90 an hour in
Victorian sweat shops. Cotrell &
Leonard offered its employees
no retirement benefits, no medi
cal insurance, poor ventilation, a
fire-trap building with no fire es
capes and two unsanitary toilets
for 40 women.

The Stanford University ad
ministration was informed of the
strike situation three months ago
by a letter from the New York
State District of the ILGWU. To
date the union has not received a
reply.
I would like to urge the Stan
ford community (faculty, stu
dents, staff and families) to ex
press a concern to the University
administration about its plans to
do business with Cotrell &
Leonard.
I remind those who saw the
film Norma Rae that such situa
tions are not merely Hollywood
fiction. The workers of Cotrell &
Leonard have sent out a call for
help, and 1 suggest we do our
part.

Bollards 'spiffy'?
Dear Mom and Dad:
I can't wait till you come out
for graduation. You will get to
see the great new bollards all
over campus that cost just
$90,000 — a steal. I like them
because they are neat, pretty,
and nice, and some even have
cool reflectors.
I ran into one without reflec
tors last night on my bike, but
was relieved that it ruined my
bike and not the bollard: the ar
chitecture would have been
compromised. Besides, the harsh
glow of a reflector beaming the
post's existence into the night
would have ruined my aesthetic
appreciation of the posts's grace
and beauty.
The best ones are concrete so
nothing can ever knock them
over, but don't worry; fire trucks
will run over cars instead of the
posts if there is an emergency, so
once again the architecture will

be preserved.
People around here never
cease to amaze me with the spiffy
ways they spend our money. You
will see when you arrive what I
mean by Stanford's well
considered priorities.

Harvard emulaton
Stanford's new required
courses have received a great
deal of attention in the Daily and
other area papers. It seems that
every time I read about them.
Harvard's similar action is
brought up.
Since I've been here, I've
noticed a preoccupation with
"keeping up with Harvard" a
number of times. The fact that
Harvard has done something
does not make it right for Stan
ford; this university should de
cide issues based on its own goals
and ideals of education.
The fanfare over the return to
mandatory courses by the big
name schools has ignored the
existence of many fine smaller
colleges which have stuck to ex
tensive requirements all along.
For example, St. Louis Uni
versity requires the following
(out of 120 hours to graduate):
three fine arts, three math, six

literature, six history, six social
science, six natural science, nine
philosophy, nine theology and
10 to 12 foreign language. 1
found such a wide-ranging cur
riculum extremely valuable, and
I'm sure future Stanford students
will too — even those in "pre
professional" programs.

Caps and Gowns
The administration of the
University is preparing to order
caps and gowns for this year's
commencement ceremonies
from a New York company, Cot
rell & Leonard, which is under
investigation by the National
Labor Relations Board (NJ RB)
for unfair labor practices.
The employees of Cotrell &
Leonard have been on strike
since August 8, 1979. The strike
is being supported by Local No.
163 of the International Ladies'
Garment Workers' Union
(ILGWU). AFL-CIO.
Cotrell & Leonard have
waged a persistent war against
union organization in their
shops. The NLRB complaint re
ports threats of closing the shop
if workers choose to organize into
the ILGWU; interrogation of
employees and surveillance of
union activities; threatening of
employees on strike and
threatening of suspected union
sypathizers during the hiring
process.
It would be ironic and disturb
ing if the Stanford graduates
were to celebrate their passing
into the world of work by wear
ing caps and gowns made by
women earning $2.90 an hour in
Victorian sweat shops. Cotrell &
Leonard offered its employees
no retirement benefits, no medi
cal insurance, poor ventilation, a
fire-trap building with no fire es
capes and two unsanitary toilets
for 40 women.

The Stanford University ad
ministration was informed of the
strike situation three months ago
by a letter from the New York
State District of the ILGWU. To
date the union has not received a
reply.
I would like to urge the Stan
ford community (faculty, stu
dents, staff and families) to ex
press a concern to the University
administration about its plans to
do business with Cotrell &
Leonard.
I remind those who saw the
film Norma Rae that such situa
tions are not merely Hollywood
fiction. The workers of Cotrell &
Leonard have sent out a call for
help, and 1 suggest we do our
part.

Bollards 'spiffy'?
Dear Mom and Dad:
I can't wait till you come out
for graduation. You will get to
see the great new bollards all
over campus that cost just
$90,000 — a steal. I like them
because they are neat, pretty,
and nice, and some even have
cool reflectors.
I ran into one without reflec
tors last night on my bike, but
was relieved that it ruined my
bike and not the bollard: the ar
chitecture would have been
compromised. Besides, the harsh
glow of a reflector beaming the
post's existence into the night
would have ruined my aesthetic
appreciation of the posts's grace
and beauty.
The best ones are concrete so
nothing can ever knock them
over, but don't worry; fire trucks
will run over cars instead of the
posts if there is an emergency, so
once again the architecture will

be preserved.
People around here never
cease to amaze me with the spiffy
ways they spend our money. You
will see when you arrive what I
mean by Stanford's well
considered priorities.

Visa card rip-off
The Stanford Federal Credit
Union, while ottering othersise
excellent benefits and serices —
has begun offering us Visa credit
cards that include a significant
ringer.
They charge interest im
mediately rather than allowing
the cardholder most of a month
after receipt of the statement in
which to pay the charges without
interest.
This is a "ringer" because 1) it
is different from the "custom"
with Visa and Mastercharge
cards, and 2) it is clearly stated
only in the fine print of a full
page of their legalistic fine print.
Even there, the clarity leaves
much to be desired.
When I discovered this (upon
receiving my first statement —
and interest charges), I
suggested to them that their
"immediate interest charge"
should have been more clearly
emphasized in the publicity an
nouncing their offering of Visa
cards. To this, they replied, "Oh,
we do," and sent me a copy of the
legal-eagle fine print.
Since they are choosing not to
amply publicize their unusual
Visa card charging algorithm to
the community they serve, I am
writing this letter to offer it a bit
more exposure. Incidently,
they did offer ample publicity of
the fact that they only charge 12

percent interest, rather then the
usual 18 percent charged by
banks. Thus, for those who
habitually pay interest charges
on their credit cards, the SFCU
Visa card is beneficial — maybe
— 12 percent beginning im
mediately, rather than 18 per
cent a month down the road. (Of
course, the 12 percent and 18
percent are annual rates.)
