# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Scott Olmsted Fed Reserve – legal theft 
### 
Suppose that you went to your bank one day to
make a withdrawal and you observed agents of the
Federal Reserve Board there doing a very strange
thing. They were stopping people as they left the
bank with their money and cutting the corners off
the bills, then stamping new amounts on them. A
one dollar bill becomes a 90 cent bill, a $20
become an $18 bill, and so on.
Suppose further that they were not only devalu
ing the money people were withdrawing but had
similarly reduced the balances of all savings and
checking accounts. And they were also doing it
everywhere, to every dollar in existence. And they
announced that they were going to do this every
year.
What would you think if this happened; indeed,
what would just about everyone in the country
think? Almost certainly the words that would be
formed by a hundred million mouths would be,
"Stop, thief!"
These activities would be universally recognized
as the moral equivalent of the burglar who takes
money from your purse as you sleep.
But suppose that the Federal Reserve replied,
"Wait, we're only doing this for the good of the
country. We're going to take this money and give it
to key industries like banking, housing and the
military. The economy will falter and there might
be a depression if we didn't take your money and
spend it for you this way."
What do you think would happen at this point?
Would everyone say, "Oh, of course. Now that we
know why you're taking our money, and that it's
for a good cause, go ahead. We wouldn't want to
risk a depression."?
Or would they say, "The hell with your good
intentions, these industries will do just fine without
you pumping extra money into them. Why should
they be the privileged ones with access to an end
less supply of cash, while you whittle away our
dollars to nothing?
'"In fact, your actions are likely to cause a depre
ssion since these industries are shielded from the
rigors of the marketplace and take up resources
that ought to go elsewhere. People learn that

you're going to take some of their money, so they
spend it before you get to it. Then you have to take
larger and larger cuts to supply these industries
with their 'fix' of cash.
"If you ever stop providing the 'fix' they'll all go
bankrupt, throwing people out of work and causing
a depression. And if you don't stop this game,
you'll wind up taking all our money and destroying
our savings.
"So knock it off. Your game of' Robin Hood' can
only hurt us, not help us."
I think the latter outcome is far more likely than
the former. I think people would see right through
this charade in an instant and, reacting as much to
the moral wrong of the act as to the bad outcomes it
would produce, demand that it cease.
So why did I tell this story? Because it's true —
except for one little detail which makes the ending
come out different. Instead of clipping the corners
off dollar bills and reducing the balances in savings
accounts, the Federal Reserve simply prints more
dollars identical to those people already have, and
gives them to the favored industries. And that is all
the difference.
The effects of printing more dollars are exactly
the same as I described. The distortions produced
in the economy eventually lead to disaster. As
Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek of the Austrian
school of economics predicted more than 50 years
ago, the expansion of the money supply by the
Federal Reserve, a powergiven to it in 1913, would
lead to depressions like the world had never seen
before.
But the people are fooled. The theft takes place
behind a screen of macro-economic jargon instead
of out in the open.
The only way to end the vicious cycle of boom
and bust, with the inevitable suffering caused by
the periods of high unemployment, is to stop the
systematic thievery that is taking place. Let us re
move forever from the Federal Reserve the power
to print money at will. And the sooner, the better.
Before they bankrupt us all.

Suppose that you went to your bank one day to
make a withdrawal and you observed agents of the
Federal Reserve Board there doing a very strange
thing. They were stopping people as they left the
bank with their money and cutting the corners off
the bills, then stamping new amounts on them. A
one dollar bill becomes a 90 cent bill, a $20
become an $18 bill, and so on.
Suppose further that they were not only devalu
ing the money people were withdrawing but had
similarly reduced the balances of all savings and
checking accounts. And they were also doing it
everywhere, to every dollar in existence. And they
announced that they were going to do this every
year.
What would you think if this happened; indeed,
what would just about everyone in the country
think? Almost certainly the words that would be
formed by a hundred million mouths would be,
"Stop, thief!"
These activities would be universally recognized
as the moral equivalent of the burglar who takes
money from your purse as you sleep.
But suppose that the Federal Reserve replied,
"Wait, we're only doing this for the good of the
country. We're going to take this money and give it
to key industries like banking, housing and the
military. The economy will falter and there might
be a depression if we didn't take your money and
spend it for you this way."
What do you think would happen at this point?
Would everyone say, "Oh, of course. Now that we
know why you're taking our money, and that it's
for a good cause, go ahead. We wouldn't want to
risk a depression."?
Or would they say, "The hell with your good
intentions, these industries will do just fine without
you pumping extra money into them. Why should
they be the privileged ones with access to an end
less supply of cash, while you whittle away our
dollars to nothing?
'"In fact, your actions are likely to cause a depre
ssion since these industries are shielded from the
rigors of the marketplace and take up resources
that ought to go elsewhere. People learn that

you're going to take some of their money, so they
spend it before you get to it. Then you have to take
larger and larger cuts to supply these industries
with their 'fix' of cash.
"If you ever stop providing the 'fix' they'll all go
bankrupt, throwing people out of work and causing
a depression. And if you don't stop this game,
you'll wind up taking all our money and destroying
our savings.
"So knock it off. Your game of' Robin Hood' can
only hurt us, not help us."
I think the latter outcome is far more likely than
the former. I think people would see right through
this charade in an instant and, reacting as much to
the moral wrong of the act as to the bad outcomes it
would produce, demand that it cease.
So why did I tell this story? Because it's true —
except for one little detail which makes the ending
come out different. Instead of clipping the corners
off dollar bills and reducing the balances in savings
accounts, the Federal Reserve simply prints more
dollars identical to those people already have, and
gives them to the favored industries. And that is all
the difference.
The effects of printing more dollars are exactly
the same as I described. The distortions produced
in the economy eventually lead to disaster. As
Nobel laureate Friedrich Hayek of the Austrian
school of economics predicted more than 50 years
ago, the expansion of the money supply by the
Federal Reserve, a powergiven to it in 1913, would
lead to depressions like the world had never seen
before.
But the people are fooled. The theft takes place
behind a screen of macro-economic jargon instead
of out in the open.
The only way to end the vicious cycle of boom
and bust, with the inevitable suffering caused by
the periods of high unemployment, is to stop the
systematic thievery that is taking place. Let us re
move forever from the Federal Reserve the power
