## Liberation, not more discriminaion 
### 
Should blacks be allowed to
have a Black Liberation Month?
If so, then why shouldn't there be
a White Liberation Month? The
whole idea of this black libera
tion stuff slsems to smack of re
verse discrimination.
If we have learned anything,
certainly we have learned from
the U.S. Supreme Court's 1978
Bakke decision and the recent
two-to-one Tuling by the Califor
nia Court of Appeal for the
Third District in the De Ronde
case, which said that race may
not be considered, with or with
out quotas, in University of
California Admissions — that
reverse discrimination simply is
not constitutional.
The feeling is widespread
today that affirmative action
programs, quotas, equal oppor

tunity programs and special con
siderations for the disadvan
taged and underprivileged must
he scrapped and dismantled.
There can be little doubt that
these monetarily inefficient ves
tiges of a bygone era are doing
little to help anyone; they are, in
fact, discriminating against good,
clean, hard-working Americans.
It would seem that blacks
would do better to do as Justice
George Paras, of the De Ronde
decision, suggested when he said
that minorities, like an earlier
generation of immigrant groups,
could achieve equality in the pro
fessions "not by unconscionable
preference but by patience, per
severance and dedication."
However, this is not to say that
all blacks do not understand this.
There are some very good, intel

ligent, fair-minded blacks who
understand the correct way to
get ahead. These are the leaders
of tomorrow.
It is unfortunate that anyone
would be discriminated against,
but two wrongs don't make a
right. All Americans are con
cerned for those who have suf
fered unfairly, but punishing the
present generation of whites for
past wrongs is not the answer.
If you, the reader, have agreed
with the above remarks, you are
a dummy - and what's worst you
are probably a latent racist. If
you are black, the problem is all
the more serious.
Black Liberation Month may
help you if you dare to be
open-minded for an instant. It is
a month of education, not only
for blacks, but for people of all
colors.
When the whites began the
colonization of Africa, they took
an all black but already ethni
cally divided continent and
carved it up even more. They
brought Christianity with them,
but practiced little of what they
preached. They further recruited
and trained black armies and un
leashed them on their black
kinsmen. Villages were turned
against fellow villages, brothers
against father and brothers

against brothers. The whites
plundered a continent in the
name of humanity and the prog
ress of mankind.
To their own advantage ,
within and without this country,
blacks have been a people of
tremendous courage, incredible
endurance and unyielding faith.
Africans were kidnapped from
Africa and taken to the four
courners of the world — oppres
sed and machine-gunned on
their own continent, enslaved for
life across the seas. First divided,
then conquered. Many Won
dered where it would all end. Yet
even amidst hardship their
strength prevailed — unbelieva
ble courage, incredible endur
ance, undying faith.
A beautiful people — whose
strength is intangible, incapable
of being robbed, mutilated or cut
asunder.
Africans sang in resistance in
the villages in Africa. Africans
sang under the whip in America.
Blacks sing in resistance in the
slums and ghettos of today. They
sing in resistance to penniless
schools, joblessness, inadequate
housing, police brutality, welfare
rolls, rats, apathy, neglect, dis
crimination and, yes, even to the
euphemism of reverse discrimi
nation.
They have not been defeated.
The fight has only just begun.
Others have tried to steal their
heritage, their pride, their
families and even their very lives.
But their courage no one has
been able to touch.
As a people, blacks have been
killed, beaten, mutilated,
lynched and humiliated. Yes, it is
time for a change, but not in the
direction of reverse discrimina
tion. No, it is time that this nation
rose to real leadership and lived
out the real meaning of its creed
— that all men are created equal.
Black Liberation Month is sim
ply an educational means to this
end.

Should blacks be allowed to
have a Black Liberation Month?
If so, then why shouldn't there be
a White Liberation Month? The
whole idea of this black libera
tion stuff slsems to smack of re
verse discrimination.
If we have learned anything,
certainly we have learned from
the U.S. Supreme Court's 1978
Bakke decision and the recent
two-to-one Tuling by the Califor
nia Court of Appeal for the
Third District in the De Ronde
case, which said that race may
not be considered, with or with
out quotas, in University of
California Admissions — that
reverse discrimination simply is
not constitutional.
The feeling is widespread
today that affirmative action
programs, quotas, equal oppor

tunity programs and special con
siderations for the disadvan
taged and underprivileged must
he scrapped and dismantled.
There can be little doubt that
these monetarily inefficient ves
tiges of a bygone era are doing
little to help anyone; they are, in
fact, discriminating against good,
clean, hard-working Americans.
It would seem that blacks
would do better to do as Justice
George Paras, of the De Ronde
decision, suggested when he said
that minorities, like an earlier
generation of immigrant groups,
could achieve equality in the pro
fessions "not by unconscionable
preference but by patience, per
severance and dedication."
However, this is not to say that
all blacks do not understand this.
There are some very good, intel

ligent, fair-minded blacks who
understand the correct way to
get ahead. These are the leaders
of tomorrow.
It is unfortunate that anyone
would be discriminated against,
but two wrongs don't make a
right. All Americans are con
cerned for those who have suf
fered unfairly, but punishing the
present generation of whites for
past wrongs is not the answer.
If you, the reader, have agreed
with the above remarks, you are
a dummy - and what's worst you
are probably a latent racist. If
you are black, the problem is all
the more serious.
Black Liberation Month may
help you if you dare to be
open-minded for an instant. It is
a month of education, not only
for blacks, but for people of all
colors.
When the whites began the
colonization of Africa, they took
an all black but already ethni
cally divided continent and
carved it up even more. They
brought Christianity with them,
but practiced little of what they
preached. They further recruited
and trained black armies and un
leashed them on their black
kinsmen. Villages were turned
against fellow villages, brothers
against father and brothers

against brothers. The whites
plundered a continent in the
name of humanity and the prog
ress of mankind.
To their own advantage ,
within and without this country,
blacks have been a people of
tremendous courage, incredible
endurance and unyielding faith.
Africans were kidnapped from
Africa and taken to the four
courners of the world — oppres
sed and machine-gunned on
their own continent, enslaved for
life across the seas. First divided,
then conquered. Many Won
dered where it would all end. Yet
even amidst hardship their
strength prevailed — unbelieva
ble courage, incredible endur
ance, undying faith.
A beautiful people — whose
strength is intangible, incapable
of being robbed, mutilated or cut
asunder.
Africans sang in resistance in
the villages in Africa. Africans
sang under the whip in America.
Blacks sing in resistance in the
slums and ghettos of today. They
sing in resistance to penniless
schools, joblessness, inadequate
housing, police brutality, welfare
rolls, rats, apathy, neglect, dis
crimination and, yes, even to the
euphemism of reverse discrimi
nation.
They have not been defeated.
The fight has only just begun.
Others have tried to steal their
heritage, their pride, their
families and even their very lives.
But their courage no one has
been able to touch.
As a people, blacks have been
killed, beaten, mutilated,
lynched and humiliated. Yes, it is
time for a change, but not in the
direction of reverse discrimina
tion. No, it is time that this nation
rose to real leadership and lived
out the real meaning of its creed
— that all men are created equal.
