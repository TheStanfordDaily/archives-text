## Rock /David Berringer President Willie not bad idea 
### 
I'm not much of a country
music fan. But I like Willie Nel
son. That's how 1 am, and that's
how I found most of the people
around me at last week's concert
in Maples Pavilion. But change
that "like" to "love" and make
that "love" big and wild and
enough to make you drink beer
and scream until you collapse in
a funny kind of ecstasy.
Willie Nelson, as we all know
by now, is the big cult leader of
the renegade Nashville sound.
With his scraggly bandana and a
guitar that can sing or snarl, he
has drawn a following of
cowboy-hatted, holler-happy
fans.
They were out in force Thurs
day night — a sold-out arena
rocked and roared with each
number — and if it weren't for a
slow beginning and an obnoxious
sound system, everyone would
have been floating in heaven.
People tolerated Billy Swan,
an opening act who just had too
much following him. He was
good, sure, but where was Willie?
Kris Kristofferson had a little
better luck. He was looking good
and sounded clean, although his
later songs melted into one
another and he was a little far
removed from his band.
Kristofferson's appeal has al
ways puzzled me. Besides his
good looks and a fair movie
career, he — and wife Rita
Coolidge for that matter — have
made their way hop, skip and big
jump — never quite on top of
anything, but always hanging in
there.
Kristofferson hung in Thurs
day night, although he knew as
well as anyone that the legions
were waiting for someone else.
To his credit, he never let it get
to him — he also braved some
terrible amp kickback and
sound-system quirks that would
have ruined anyone's concentra
tion.
At 9:30, it finally happened.
Onstage came Willie Nelson,
and the place exploded.
Willie and his band — includ
ing Merle Haggard in a Surprise
appearance — ran through the
standard's, whipping up the
crowd, especially on a beautiful

"Stay a Little Longer."
He seemed a little too soft
edged and teary-eyed on a med
ley of ballads, but his "Stardust"
and "Blue Eyes Cryin' in the
Rain" made up for everything.
The crowd went silent, caught off
guard by the sheer power of Nel

son's music and by the silence
itself, which seemed haunting
after the whooping and banging
amplifiers.
Willie's musicians started a lit
tle too fast and slick, hut Mickey
Raphael held his usual fine har
monica, and guitarist Jody Payne
exploded on "Working Man

Blues."
Haggard, of course, was great,
although he didn't join in the
singing until the end of the show.
He joined in "Mama, Don't Let
Your Babies Grow Up to Be
Cowboys," an unofficial theme
song, especially for the Nelson

brand of country rock.
At the end of the song, every
body waved his hat or bottle of
beer, and Willie and Haggard
both doffed their hats.
The last numbers were the
sweetest. Kristofferson and
Haggard each sang a verse, then
Willie swelled with his tradi

tional closer, "Amazing Grace."
But he didn't stop. Driven by
the fans and his own big heart (he
once said he'd never quit playing
it he felt a song coming on), the
show went through encore after
encore.
"Will the Circle Be Unbro
ken" was the clincher, and the
flag of Texas blowing out at the
end was too much.
Well, sir, Kenny Rogers may
be the nation's top country
singer. Robert Redford may
have starred in that Horseman
movie. But Willie Nelson isn't
taking the second seat to anyone.
They were selling "Willie for
President" bumper stickers Fri
day night — and if music be the
way to the ballot box, there'll
soon be a red bandana flying
from the White House flagpole.

one on the left looks more at home?
