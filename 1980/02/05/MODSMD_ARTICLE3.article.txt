# LOTS crash destroys files
## 
### 
A malfunctioning disk drive in the
LOTS computer facility here resulted
in the loss of several storage files last
weekend.
J O. Johnson, systems programmer
at LOTS, said that all information
stored by student users between Satur
day morning and Sunday evening was
rendered unusable when the computer
system suffered what is known as a
"head crash."
Johnson said that a head crash occurs
when the sensing head of a disk drive
hits the disks, destroying them. A disk
drive is used for data storage and con
sists of a stack of metal plates spinning
at high speed on which information is
recorded magnetically. Just above the
plates are the sensing heads, so close to
the plates that a speck of dust could get
caught between them.

Johnson said that Saturday after
noon something, possibly an ant, got
stuck in the disk drive in which all stu
dent work is stored, causing the head
crash, and the subsequent breakdown
of the entire system.
Though all information on the de
stroyed disk was lost, LOTS periodi
cally copies all information from the
disk drives onto magnetic tape to guard
against damages to the disks. The data
on the destroyed disks was last taped
between 8 a.m. and noon Saturday and
all this information has been restored
to the repaired disks.
Johnson said that students using
LOTS will find only that information
stored after Saturday morning has been
lost. Otherwise, Johnson added, the
system is back to normal.
