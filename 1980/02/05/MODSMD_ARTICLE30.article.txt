## Muffled jazz in Mem Aud 
### 
Memorial Auditorium may be
a nice hall for drama, dance and
spectacles such as "Gaieties,"
hut on Saturday night it did con
siderable damage to the Toshiko
Akiyoski/Lew Tabackin Big
Band.
You see, this jazz ensemble is
a glistening gem of subtlety, taste
and inspired improvisations; but
when set against the funeral par
lor acoustics of Mem Aud, it was
rendered dull and synthetic. For
the entire first set, most of the
dynamic contrasts that are essen
tial to the music were lost in the
deadness of the auditorium.
Make no mistake about it, the
band was swinging, the ensemble
playing was tight, and the soloing
was very professional and often
inspired, but the audience was
cheated out of the full impact of
this unique group. This was by no
means a standard hig band out
ing of cliched swing music.
Toshiko's arrangements exuded
a subtle wit and sophistication
that demanded careful listening
attention. By the second and
final set, this became more pos
sible as the sound finally im
proved and the audience's en

thusiasm immediately jumped in
response.
Co-leader Lew Tabackin stole
the show after the intermission
with an exotic, unaccompanied
flute improvisation that fused
elements from Oriental, Indian
and American jazz music into a
very sensitive offering.
The very next tune featured
Tabackin's tenor saxophone . He
brought the concert to its climax
when, fed up with the impotence
of his microphone, he came out
in front of the entire band and

shot the pure, unamplified sound
of his tenor throughout the au
ditorium. In this display of won
derful irony, Tabackin's re
spiratory powers made the Mem
Aud sound system appear as if it
were never plugged in.
Oniy a great big band could
have risen above the pathetic
acoustics and sound production
in Mem Aud. In time, the
Akiyoshi/Tabackin group deli
vered. Too bad they had to leave
just as they were getting jazzed.
