## 
### 
On Sunday , Feb. 24 at 2:30 p.m.. the
Guarneri and Vermeer String Quartets will
appear together at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
in a benefit performance for the Livel> Arts

The concert will be followed by a cham
pagne reception with guest Wallace Stegner,
a longtime fan of the Guarneri. whom he
included in his novel Spectator Bird. He will
be on hand afterwards to autograph copies of

According to Lively Arts director Vicky
Holt, the need for fund-raising events in
creases each year due to the rising cost of

artists' tees. While the University has in
creased its subsid\ of the Lively Arts to
$50,000 for the current season, the series'
budget will be approximately $325,000. The
series is financed primarily from ticket re
venue. individual donations and corporate
and foundation contributions.
The need for additional funds arises
largely from the Liveh Arts' determination
to encourage the de\ elopment and growth of
an appreciation for the arts among students.
The\ offer a 40 percent discount to Stanford
students as well as students at other area
schools, senior centers and community cen

ters. They also sponsor mini-concerts, mas
ter classes and workshops given by artists
appearing in the series.
The program on the 24th will include
Beethoven's Quartet No. 12 in E-flat, Opus
127, played by the Vermeer String Quartet,
and Mendelssohn's Octet in E-flat for Strings,
Opus 20, performed by both groups.
Tickets are available for $35. $27 of which
is tax-deductible and reflects a direct con
tribution to the Lively Arts program. Tickets
are available at the Tresidder Ticket Office,
Stanford Barn and all major Bay Area agen
cies.
