## Zabaleta king of harpists 
### 
In a concert crowned with two
encores and three standing ova
tions, Nicanor Zabaleta dazzled
Lively A\rts patrons last Friday
night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
with his ancient and fascinating
instrument, the harp. Known as
"king of the harpists," Zabaleta
seemed to hold the audience
under a spell as his fingers
coaxed luscious sounds from the
large, yet graceful, instrument.
The first half of the program
was dominated by three pieces
from the classical era. The most
interesting of these was Beeth
oven's Six Easy Variations on c
Swiss Air. The theme and varia
tion form provided an excellent
opportunity for Zabaleta to
show the versatility of his in
strument and the extent of his
technique.
The theme always remained
prominent above the difficult
technical exercises of the varia
tions. The harp slipped out of
tune during this piece, but the
problem was corrected when
Zabaleta produced a key and
quickly tuned the errant strings.
The last piece before intermis
sion was a prelude to the second
half of the program. A neoclassi
cal work by the Spanish com
poser Bacarisse, it was written in
1950 and dedicated to Zabaleta.
Most of the second portion of
the concert was music by con
temporary Spanish composers,
especially those from the Basque
region of northern Spain, of
which Zabaleta is a native. Al
though all the pieces were de
lightful. by far the most interest
ing was the last. Two Preludes by
C. Salzedo.
Salzedo (1885-1961) was a

harpist as well as a composer
who wrote ingenious pieces for
his own instrument. Some of the
unusual sounds that were incor
porated into the preludes in
cluded thumps on the frame of
the harp with fingertips or
knuckles, unconventional use of
the pedals of the harp, and

strumming the strings with the
backs of the fingernails.
Zabaleta gave as flawless a
performance of Salzedo's in
novative composition as he had
of the earlier classical selections.
He is truly a master of his art and
an outstanding contributor to the
Lively Arts season.
