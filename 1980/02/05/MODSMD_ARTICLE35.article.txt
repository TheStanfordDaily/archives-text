U.S. seeks arms for Pakistan
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Zbigniew
Brzezinski, trying to enlist other nations in a
massive build-up of Pakistan's military
strength, conferred yesterday with Saudi Ara
bian leaders, who have taken a leading role in
condemning the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan.
In Washington, meanwhile, a State Depart
ment spokesman said U.S. intelligence infor
mation indicates that some 2500 Soviet troops
have been killed or wounded since the Afghan
operation began in late December.
The spokesman. Hodding Carter, also said it
was learned that Moscow's domination of the
Afghan government is so complete that prior
Soviet approval is required for appointments to
any important government posts.
Before flying here. Brzezinski and Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christopher held
two days of talks in Islamabad with the Pakis
tani president. Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
who previously had rejected as "peanuts" an
offer of $400 million in U.S. military and
economic aid over two years.
Brzezinski described the offer to Zia as only
the first installment of a long-r tnge aid prog
ram. No agreement was reached on an aid
amount, however, pending an overall assess
ment of Pakistan's needs by a Pentagon team
that Brzezinski left behind.
Until then, a Brzezinski spokesman said
after the U.S. party arrived here, the $400
million is "still a possible thing" and has not
been flatly rejected.
An Iranian jet fighter yesterday flew near a
U.S. Air Force 707 carrying Brzezinski and
Christopher while it was flying toward the Per
sian Gulf on its way from Pakistan to Saudi
Arabia.
The fighter flew within 1000 feet — too close
for safety — of the American plane for about 2
minutes before streaking off.
Top American officials on board the plane
said the Iranian jet clearly violated interna
tional air traffic-control regulations and specu
lated Iran took this opportunity to send the
message that its air force is not quite the tooth
less power it was believed.
Americans said they had thought none of the
F-14 interceptor jets that Iran purchased from
the United States was in flying condition.
"That one is a higher percentage of Iran's
F-14s than I thought were fly able." said one
top official on board.
The incident took place at about 10 a.m.
Saudi time (2 a.m. EST) after the U.S. plane

had left Pakistan and was flying over the Gulf
of Oman. It was well over international waters
off Iran's coast, near the port of Chag Bahar,
where the deposed shah of Iran had planned to
build a giant naval base.
Carter to limit registration age
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
will limit his draft registration program to per
sons IS to 20 years old, an anti-draft activist
said yesterday.
Barry Lynn, chairman of the Committee
Against Registration and the Draft, made the
disclosure after a White House briefing.
He quoted a selective ser\ice official as say
ing that the military needs a pool of 4 million or
5 million persons and that would be obtained
by registering IS to 20 year old men.
There is approximately an equal number of
IS to 20 year old women.
At the White House briefing. Lynn said,
three reasons were given for limiting the regist
ration to persons IS to 20 years old:
They are "more easily trainable"; most of
them don't have families; and some older per
sons, say 24 to 26. may have been liable to draft
registration in the past.
The president studied the issue at Camp
Dav id, Md., over the weekend. As he returned
to the White House on Sunday , reporters asked
if he had decided whether to register women.
"Yes, I've decided," he acknowledged, but
declined to say what his decision was.
Khomeini swears in president
Abolhassan Bani Sadr became Iran's first
president last night at the Tehran hospital
where ailing Ayatollah Ruhollah' Khomeini
swore him in and endorsed him before a televi
sion audience.
Earlier in the day the 79-year-old Khomeini
condemned the So\iet intervention in Af
ghanistan and swore "unconditional support"
for the Moslem Afghan rebels.
At the hospital ceremony Bani Sadr pledged
to Khomeini and the broadcast audience that
he would work to rid the country of hundreds
of years of corruption brought on by successive
monarchical governments.
In return, Khomeini promised to endorse
and support Bani Sadr's electoral victory as
long as the new president followed the sacred
principles of Islam, abided by the constitution
and helped the poor and the oppressed.
Khomeini's public display of support for
Bani Sadr should prov ide the 46-year-old pres
ident with enormous political strength at least

in the initial stages of his four-year term.
During his brief tenure as Iran's foreign
minister last fall, Bani Sadr displayed a more
moderate approach to the American hostage
crisis than his successor, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh,
has.
Election of a parliament, expected in about a
month, will complete the transfer of power
from the shah.
Khomeini holds supreme power under the
new Islamic constitution and can dismiss Bani
Sadr if he wishes.
Ali advocates Games boycott
NAIROBI, Kenya — Muhammad Ali yes
terday carried President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign for an Olympic boycott to Kenya, where
he faced an enthusiastic public welcome but
also some comments that he is unsuited to the
job of special presidential envoy.
The Sunday Nation, eastern Africa's
largest-selling newspaper, said editorially that
Carter's decision to send Ali on an African tour
"is certainly a mistake."
Ali. 40, stepped oft the U.S. presidential
jetliner and, in an uncharacteristic diplomatic
style, immediately unleashed a verbal right-left
combination against racism. South Africa,
superpower intervention. Uncle Tomism and
slavery. He ended by admitting that the finer
points of Africa confused him.
"I'm not Carter's whuppin' boy," he de
clared to a delighted news conference of mostly
Kenyan journalists. "I'm not selling America
or American policy. If America did something
wrong against my people in the past, America
was wrong. I'm not here to take the blame.
"I didn't slave nobody, I didn't break no
body. I didn't bribe nobody. I've been invited
three times to South Africa and I didn't go. I'm
against South Africa. But Carter's trying to do
things better. Change things. Best president
we've had.
"Now, I been told and I read in the newspap
ers that Russia is going in by force and taking
Africa and hopes one day probably to impose
its ways, which are atheists, on the world. My
mission is just and right, to help stop a nuclear
war.
Aeroflot jet stalemate ended
NEW YORK — An agreement to end a two
day delay in the takeoff of a Moscow-bound jet
carrying 80 passengers was reached yesterday
between the Soviet airline Aeroflot and
operators of Kennedy International Airport.
Ground crews at the airport, members of the

Teamsters union, had refused for two days to
service the Aerotlot jet as a protest against
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
The plane was expected to depart during the
evening after being serviced by management
officials of a private company, according to a
release from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
"The agreement, which was reached with the
concurrence and participation of the U.S. State
Department, specifies that Aerotlot will not
come into Kennedy Airport on further
scheduled flights until it has made arrange
ments with another carrier already serving the
airport to handle them," the Port Authority
statement said.
The agreement ended a growing dispute be
tween the two governments over the refusal of
crews to service the jet that landed here Sun
day, despite orders from the Port Authority to
land at Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. It
was not known why the plane's crew ignored
the order.
Russians pressure Sakharov
MOSCOW — Soviet authorities have
threatened further sanctions against both dis
sident physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife
in the wake of public comments that he made
through her following his banishment from
Moscow two weeks ago, it was revealed here
yesterday.
But the SS-year-old Nobel Prize winner
nonetheless affirmed in a new statement that
he would "refuse to submit" to what he charac
terized as an illegal and arbitrary deprivation of
his civil and political rights.
The latest Sakharov statement was dated
Sunday and was read to Western reporters by
his wife, Yelana Bonner, in the couples' former
Moscow home yesterday afternoon. Bonner
arrived in the Soviet capital yesterday morning
after spending the weekend with her husband
in the Volga River city of Gorky, to which he
was banished two weeks ago.
Sakharov was apparently banished by execu
tive order, although he has only been allowed
to read a second order of the Supreme Soviet
stripping him of all the state awards and honors
he earned during a 20-year career in the Soviet
nuclear weapons program.
Brown vetoes anti-busing bill
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown vet
oed an anti-busing bill yesterday that would
have required civil rights groups to prove in
court that a school district was no longer inten

tionally segregated.
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys),
labeled Brown's veto of his SB 1244 as "desp
erate presidential politics" and said he ex
pected to seek an override of the democratic
governor's veto.
"By vetoing this bill in the face of over
whelming voter sentiment against lorced bus
ing, he (Brown) is hoping to appear as a hero to
pro-busing political contributors in the East,"
Robbins said.
"The governor's veto shows a contempt for
the voters of California who in November
voted almost 70 percent against forced bus
ing," Robbins said.
The measure would have excluded Califor
nia from U.S. Supreme Court decisions which
have said school districts such as Los Angeles,
where intentional segregation has once been
found, must prove in future court cases that
they are no longer deliberately segregated.
Opponents, such as the American Civil
Liberties Union, have likened the bill to the
attempts by the southern states in the 1950s
and 1960s to pass laws that would exclude
them from federal civil rights statutes and rul
ings.
NFL Raiders near LA move
LOS ANGELES — A lawyer for the Oak
land Raiders said yesterday the National Foot
ball League club is ready to move here next fall
if a federal judge exempts the team from an
NFL rule requiring that the move be approved
by 21 of the 28 NFL team owners.
"As of the weekend, we believe that if the
(Los Angeles Memorial) Coliseum can deliver
what it promises to deliver — and he believes
it can — we have an agreement," said Joseph
Alioto, former mayor of San Francisco, who is
representing the Raiders in their negotiations
with the Coliseum.
"We are prepared to conclude a written con
tract this week and start construction next
week," Alioto told U.S. District Judge Harry
Pregerson.
Both Alioto and Coliseum Commission
lawyer Maxwell Belcher stressed that a quick
and favorable ruling is necessary if the Col
iseum is to complete construction work it has
promised the Raiders in time for the 1980-81
season.
Pregerson did not say when he would make a
decision. However, he ended the hearing by
asking both Belcher and NFL attorney Henry
Thumann how quickly they could be ready to
present arguments at a full trial.

The latest Sakharov statement was dated
Sunday and was read to Western reporters by
his wife, Yelana Bonner, in the couples' former
Moscow home yesterday afternoon. Bonner
arrived in the Soviet capital yesterday morning
after spending the weekend with her husband
in the Volga River city of Gorky, to which he
was banished two weeks ago.
Sakharov was apparently banished by execu

to read a second order of the Supreme Soviet
stripping him of all the state awards and honors
he earned during a 20-year career in the Soviet
nuclear weapons program.
Brown vetoes anti-busing bill
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown vet
oed an anti-busing bill yesterday that would
have required civil rights groups to prove in
court that a school district was no longer inten

tionally segregated.
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys),
labeled Brown's veto of his SB 1244 as "desp
erate presidential politics" and said he ex
pected to seek an override of the democratic
governor's veto.
"By vetoing this bill in the face of over
whelming voter sentiment against lorced bus
ing, he (Brown) is hoping to appear as a hero to
pro-busing political contributors in the East,"
Robbins said.
"The governor's veto shows a contempt for
the voters of California who in November
voted almost 70 percent against forced bus
ing," Robbins said.
The measure would have excluded Califor
nia from U.S. Supreme Court decisions which
have said school districts such as Los Angeles,
where intentional segregation has once been
found, must prove in future court cases that
they are no longer deliberately segregated.
Opponents, such as the American Civil
Liberties Union, have likened the bill to the
attempts by the southern states in the 1950s
and 1960s to pass laws that would exclude
them from federal civil rights statutes and rul
ings.
NFL Raiders near LA move
LOS ANGELES — A lawyer for the Oak
land Raiders said yesterday the National Foot
ball League club is ready to move here next fall
if a federal judge exempts the team from an
NFL rule requiring that the move be approved
by 21 of the 28 NFL team owners.
"As of the weekend, we believe that if the
(Los Angeles Memorial) Coliseum can deliver
what it promises to deliver — and he believes
it can — we have an agreement," said Joseph
Alioto, former mayor of San Francisco, who is
representing the Raiders in their negotiations
with the Coliseum.
"We are prepared to conclude a written con
tract this week and start construction next
week," Alioto told U.S. District Judge Harry
Pregerson.
Both Alioto and Coliseum Commission
lawyer Maxwell Belcher stressed that a quick
and favorable ruling is necessary if the Col
iseum is to complete construction work it has
promised the Raiders in time for the 1980-81
season.
Pregerson did not say when he would make a
decision. However, he ended the hearing by
asking both Belcher and NFL attorney Henry
Thumann how quickly they could be ready to
present arguments at a full trial.

U.S. seeks arms for Pakistan
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Zbigniew
Brzezinski, trying to enlist other nations in a
massive build-up of Pakistan's military
strength, conferred yesterday with Saudi Ara
bian leaders, who have taken a leading role in
condemning the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan.
In Washington, meanwhile, a State Depart
ment spokesman said U.S. intelligence infor
mation indicates that some 2500 Soviet troops
have been killed or wounded since the Afghan
operation began in late December.
The spokesman. Hodding Carter, also said it
was learned that Moscow's domination of the
Afghan government is so complete that prior
Soviet approval is required for appointments to
any important government posts.
Before flying here. Brzezinski and Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christopher held
two days of talks in Islamabad with the Pakis
tani president. Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
who previously had rejected as "peanuts" an
offer of $400 million in U.S. military and
economic aid over two years.
Brzezinski described the offer to Zia as only
the first installment of a long-r tnge aid prog
ram. No agreement was reached on an aid
amount, however, pending an overall assess
ment of Pakistan's needs by a Pentagon team
that Brzezinski left behind.
Until then, a Brzezinski spokesman said
after the U.S. party arrived here, the $400
million is "still a possible thing" and has not
been flatly rejected.
An Iranian jet fighter yesterday flew near a
U.S. Air Force 707 carrying Brzezinski and
Christopher while it was flying toward the Per
sian Gulf on its way from Pakistan to Saudi
Arabia.
The fighter flew within 1000 feet — too close
for safety — of the American plane for about 2
minutes before streaking off.
Top American officials on board the plane
said the Iranian jet clearly violated interna
tional air traffic-control regulations and specu
lated Iran took this opportunity to send the
message that its air force is not quite the tooth
less power it was believed.
Americans said they had thought none of the
F-14 interceptor jets that Iran purchased from
the United States was in flying condition.
"That one is a higher percentage of Iran's
F-14s than I thought were fly able." said one
top official on board.
The incident took place at about 10 a.m.
Saudi time (2 a.m. EST) after the U.S. plane

had left Pakistan and was flying over the Gulf
of Oman. It was well over international waters
off Iran's coast, near the port of Chag Bahar,
where the deposed shah of Iran had planned to
build a giant naval base.
Carter to limit registration age
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
will limit his draft registration program to per
sons IS to 20 years old, an anti-draft activist
said yesterday.
Barry Lynn, chairman of the Committee
Against Registration and the Draft, made the
disclosure after a White House briefing.
He quoted a selective ser\ice official as say
ing that the military needs a pool of 4 million or
5 million persons and that would be obtained
by registering IS to 20 year old men.
There is approximately an equal number of
IS to 20 year old women.
At the White House briefing. Lynn said,
three reasons were given for limiting the regist
ration to persons IS to 20 years old:
They are "more easily trainable"; most of
them don't have families; and some older per
sons, say 24 to 26. may have been liable to draft
registration in the past.
The president studied the issue at Camp
Dav id, Md., over the weekend. As he returned
to the White House on Sunday , reporters asked
if he had decided whether to register women.
"Yes, I've decided," he acknowledged, but
declined to say what his decision was.
Khomeini swears in president
Abolhassan Bani Sadr became Iran's first
president last night at the Tehran hospital
where ailing Ayatollah Ruhollah' Khomeini
swore him in and endorsed him before a televi
sion audience.
Earlier in the day the 79-year-old Khomeini
condemned the So\iet intervention in Af
ghanistan and swore "unconditional support"
for the Moslem Afghan rebels.
At the hospital ceremony Bani Sadr pledged
to Khomeini and the broadcast audience that
he would work to rid the country of hundreds
of years of corruption brought on by successive
monarchical governments.
In return, Khomeini promised to endorse
and support Bani Sadr's electoral victory as
long as the new president followed the sacred
principles of Islam, abided by the constitution
and helped the poor and the oppressed.
Khomeini's public display of support for
Bani Sadr should prov ide the 46-year-old pres
ident with enormous political strength at least

in the initial stages of his four-year term.
During his brief tenure as Iran's foreign
minister last fall, Bani Sadr displayed a more
moderate approach to the American hostage
crisis than his successor, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh,
has.
Election of a parliament, expected in about a
month, will complete the transfer of power
from the shah.
Khomeini holds supreme power under the
new Islamic constitution and can dismiss Bani
Sadr if he wishes.
Ali advocates Games boycott
NAIROBI, Kenya — Muhammad Ali yes
terday carried President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign for an Olympic boycott to Kenya, where
he faced an enthusiastic public welcome but
also some comments that he is unsuited to the
job of special presidential envoy.
The Sunday Nation, eastern Africa's
largest-selling newspaper, said editorially that
Carter's decision to send Ali on an African tour
"is certainly a mistake."
Ali. 40, stepped oft the U.S. presidential
jetliner and, in an uncharacteristic diplomatic
style, immediately unleashed a verbal right-left
combination against racism. South Africa,
superpower intervention. Uncle Tomism and
slavery. He ended by admitting that the finer
points of Africa confused him.
"I'm not Carter's whuppin' boy," he de
clared to a delighted news conference of mostly
Kenyan journalists. "I'm not selling America
or American policy. If America did something
wrong against my people in the past, America
was wrong. I'm not here to take the blame.
"I didn't slave nobody, I didn't break no
body. I didn't bribe nobody. I've been invited
three times to South Africa and I didn't go. I'm
against South Africa. But Carter's trying to do
things better. Change things. Best president
we've had.
"Now, I been told and I read in the newspap
ers that Russia is going in by force and taking
Africa and hopes one day probably to impose
its ways, which are atheists, on the world. My
mission is just and right, to help stop a nuclear
war.
Aeroflot jet stalemate ended
NEW YORK — An agreement to end a two
day delay in the takeoff of a Moscow-bound jet
carrying 80 passengers was reached yesterday
between the Soviet airline Aeroflot and
operators of Kennedy International Airport.
Ground crews at the airport, members of the

Teamsters union, had refused for two days to
service the Aerotlot jet as a protest against
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
The plane was expected to depart during the
evening after being serviced by management
officials of a private company, according to a
release from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
"The agreement, which was reached with the
concurrence and participation of the U.S. State
Department, specifies that Aerotlot will not
come into Kennedy Airport on further
scheduled flights until it has made arrange
ments with another carrier already serving the
airport to handle them," the Port Authority
statement said.
The agreement ended a growing dispute be
tween the two governments over the refusal of
crews to service the jet that landed here Sun
day, despite orders from the Port Authority to
land at Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. It
was not known why the plane's crew ignored
the order.
Russians pressure Sakharov
MOSCOW — Soviet authorities have
threatened further sanctions against both dis
sident physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife
in the wake of public comments that he made
through her following his banishment from
Moscow two weeks ago, it was revealed here
yesterday.
But the SS-year-old Nobel Prize winner
nonetheless affirmed in a new statement that
he would "refuse to submit" to what he charac
terized as an illegal and arbitrary deprivation of
his civil and political rights.
The latest Sakharov statement was dated
Sunday and was read to Western reporters by

NAIROBI, Kenya — Muhammad Ali yes
terday carried President Jimmy Carter's cam

he faced an enthusiastic public welcome but
also some comments that he is unsuited to the
job of special presidential envoy.
The Sunday Nation, eastern Africa's
largest-selling newspaper, said editorially that
Carter's decision to send Ali on an African tour
"is certainly a mistake."
Ali. 40, stepped oft the U.S. presidential
jetliner and, in an uncharacteristic diplomatic
style, immediately unleashed a verbal right-left
combination against racism. South Africa,
superpower intervention. Uncle Tomism and
slavery. He ended by admitting that the finer
points of Africa confused him.
"I'm not Carter's whuppin' boy," he de
clared to a delighted news conference of mostly
Kenyan journalists. "I'm not selling America
or American policy. If America did something
wrong against my people in the past, America
was wrong. I'm not here to take the blame.
"I didn't slave nobody, I didn't break no

Aeroflot jet stalemate ended
NEW YORK — An agreement to end a two
day delay in the takeoff of a Moscow-bound jet
carrying 80 passengers was reached yesterday
between the Soviet airline Aeroflot and
operators of Kennedy International Airport.
Ground crews at the airport, members of the

Teamsters union, had refused for two days to
service the Aerotlot jet as a protest against
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
The plane was expected to depart during the
evening after being serviced by management
officials of a private company, according to a
release from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
"The agreement, which was reached with the
concurrence and participation of the U.S. State
Department, specifies that Aerotlot will not
come into Kennedy Airport on further
scheduled flights until it has made arrange
ments with another carrier already serving the
airport to handle them," the Port Authority
statement said.
The agreement ended a growing dispute be
tween the two governments over the refusal of
crews to service the jet that landed here Sun
day, despite orders from the Port Authority to
land at Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. It
was not known why the plane's crew ignored
the order.
Russians pressure Sakharov
MOSCOW — Soviet authorities have
threatened further sanctions against both dis
sident physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife
in the wake of public comments that he made
through her following his banishment from
Moscow two weeks ago, it was revealed here
yesterday.
But the SS-year-old Nobel Prize winner
nonetheless affirmed in a new statement that
he would "refuse to submit" to what he charac
terized as an illegal and arbitrary deprivation of
his civil and political rights.
The latest Sakharov statement was dated
Sunday and was read to Western reporters by
his wife, Yelana Bonner, in the couples' former
Moscow home yesterday afternoon. Bonner
arrived in the Soviet capital yesterday morning
after spending the weekend with her husband
in the Volga River city of Gorky, to which he
was banished two weeks ago.
Sakharov was apparently banished by execu
tive order, although he has only been allowed
to read a second order of the Supreme Soviet
stripping him of all the state awards and honors
he earned during a 20-year career in the Soviet
nuclear weapons program.
Brown vetoes anti-busing bill
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown vet
oed an anti-busing bill yesterday that would
have required civil rights groups to prove in
court that a school district was no longer inten

tionally segregated.
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys),
labeled Brown's veto of his SB 1244 as "desp
erate presidential politics" and said he ex
pected to seek an override of the democratic
governor's veto.
"By vetoing this bill in the face of over
whelming voter sentiment against lorced bus
ing, he (Brown) is hoping to appear as a hero to
pro-busing political contributors in the East,"
Robbins said.
"The governor's veto shows a contempt for
the voters of California who in November
voted almost 70 percent against forced bus
ing," Robbins said.
The measure would have excluded Califor
nia from U.S. Supreme Court decisions which
have said school districts such as Los Angeles,
where intentional segregation has once been
found, must prove in future court cases that
they are no longer deliberately segregated.
Opponents, such as the American Civil
Liberties Union, have likened the bill to the
attempts by the southern states in the 1950s
and 1960s to pass laws that would exclude
them from federal civil rights statutes and rul
ings.
NFL Raiders near LA move
LOS ANGELES — A lawyer for the Oak
land Raiders said yesterday the National Foot
ball League club is ready to move here next fall
if a federal judge exempts the team from an
NFL rule requiring that the move be approved
by 21 of the 28 NFL team owners.
"As of the weekend, we believe that if the
(Los Angeles Memorial) Coliseum can deliver
what it promises to deliver — and he believes
it can — we have an agreement," said Joseph
Alioto, former mayor of San Francisco, who is
representing the Raiders in their negotiations
with the Coliseum.
"We are prepared to conclude a written con
tract this week and start construction next
week," Alioto told U.S. District Judge Harry
Pregerson.
Both Alioto and Coliseum Commission
lawyer Maxwell Belcher stressed that a quick

promised the Raiders in time for the 1980-81

Pregerson did not say when he would make a

U.S. seeks arms for Pakistan
RIYADH, Saudi Arabia — Zbigniew
Brzezinski, trying to enlist other nations in a
massive build-up of Pakistan's military
strength, conferred yesterday with Saudi Ara
bian leaders, who have taken a leading role in
condemning the Soviet intervention in Af
ghanistan.
In Washington, meanwhile, a State Depart
ment spokesman said U.S. intelligence infor
mation indicates that some 2500 Soviet troops
have been killed or wounded since the Afghan
operation began in late December.
The spokesman. Hodding Carter, also said it
was learned that Moscow's domination of the
Afghan government is so complete that prior
Soviet approval is required for appointments to
any important government posts.
Before flying here. Brzezinski and Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Christopher held
two days of talks in Islamabad with the Pakis
tani president. Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
who previously had rejected as "peanuts" an
offer of $400 million in U.S. military and
economic aid over two years.
Brzezinski described the offer to Zia as only
the first installment of a long-r tnge aid prog
ram. No agreement was reached on an aid
amount, however, pending an overall assess
ment of Pakistan's needs by a Pentagon team
that Brzezinski left behind.
Until then, a Brzezinski spokesman said
after the U.S. party arrived here, the $400
million is "still a possible thing" and has not
been flatly rejected.
An Iranian jet fighter yesterday flew near a
U.S. Air Force 707 carrying Brzezinski and
Christopher while it was flying toward the Per
sian Gulf on its way from Pakistan to Saudi
Arabia.
The fighter flew within 1000 feet — too close
for safety — of the American plane for about 2
minutes before streaking off.
Top American officials on board the plane
said the Iranian jet clearly violated interna
tional air traffic-control regulations and specu
lated Iran took this opportunity to send the
message that its air force is not quite the tooth
less power it was believed.
Americans said they had thought none of the
F-14 interceptor jets that Iran purchased from
the United States was in flying condition.
"That one is a higher percentage of Iran's
F-14s than I thought were fly able." said one
top official on board.
The incident took place at about 10 a.m.
Saudi time (2 a.m. EST) after the U.S. plane

had left Pakistan and was flying over the Gulf
of Oman. It was well over international waters
off Iran's coast, near the port of Chag Bahar,
where the deposed shah of Iran had planned to
build a giant naval base.
Carter to limit registration age
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
will limit his draft registration program to per
sons IS to 20 years old, an anti-draft activist
said yesterday.
Barry Lynn, chairman of the Committee
Against Registration and the Draft, made the
disclosure after a White House briefing.
He quoted a selective ser\ice official as say
ing that the military needs a pool of 4 million or
5 million persons and that would be obtained
by registering IS to 20 year old men.
There is approximately an equal number of
IS to 20 year old women.
At the White House briefing. Lynn said,
three reasons were given for limiting the regist
ration to persons IS to 20 years old:
They are "more easily trainable"; most of
them don't have families; and some older per
sons, say 24 to 26. may have been liable to draft
registration in the past.
The president studied the issue at Camp
Dav id, Md., over the weekend. As he returned
to the White House on Sunday , reporters asked
if he had decided whether to register women.
"Yes, I've decided," he acknowledged, but
declined to say what his decision was.
Khomeini swears in president
Abolhassan Bani Sadr became Iran's first
president last night at the Tehran hospital
where ailing Ayatollah Ruhollah' Khomeini
swore him in and endorsed him before a televi
sion audience.
Earlier in the day the 79-year-old Khomeini
condemned the So\iet intervention in Af
ghanistan and swore "unconditional support"
for the Moslem Afghan rebels.
At the hospital ceremony Bani Sadr pledged
to Khomeini and the broadcast audience that
he would work to rid the country of hundreds
of years of corruption brought on by successive
monarchical governments.
In return, Khomeini promised to endorse
and support Bani Sadr's electoral victory as
long as the new president followed the sacred
principles of Islam, abided by the constitution
and helped the poor and the oppressed.
Khomeini's public display of support for
Bani Sadr should prov ide the 46-year-old pres
ident with enormous political strength at least

in the initial stages of his four-year term.
During his brief tenure as Iran's foreign
minister last fall, Bani Sadr displayed a more
moderate approach to the American hostage
crisis than his successor, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh,
has.
Election of a parliament, expected in about a
month, will complete the transfer of power
from the shah.
Khomeini holds supreme power under the
new Islamic constitution and can dismiss Bani
Sadr if he wishes.

Americans said they had thought none of the
F-14 interceptor jets that Iran purchased from
the United States was in flying condition.
"That one is a higher percentage of Iran's
F-14s than I thought were fly able." said one
top official on board.
The incident took place at about 10 a.m.
Saudi time (2 a.m. EST) after the U.S. plane

had left Pakistan and was flying over the Gulf
of Oman. It was well over international waters
off Iran's coast, near the port of Chag Bahar,
where the deposed shah of Iran had planned to
build a giant naval base.
Carter to limit registration age
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
will limit his draft registration program to per
sons IS to 20 years old, an anti-draft activist
said yesterday.
Barry Lynn, chairman of the Committee
Against Registration and the Draft, made the
disclosure after a White House briefing.
He quoted a selective ser\ice official as say
ing that the military needs a pool of 4 million or
5 million persons and that would be obtained
by registering IS to 20 year old men.
There is approximately an equal number of
IS to 20 year old women.
At the White House briefing. Lynn said,
three reasons were given for limiting the regist
ration to persons IS to 20 years old:
They are "more easily trainable"; most of
them don't have families; and some older per
sons, say 24 to 26. may have been liable to draft
registration in the past.
The president studied the issue at Camp
Dav id, Md., over the weekend. As he returned
to the White House on Sunday , reporters asked
if he had decided whether to register women.
"Yes, I've decided," he acknowledged, but
declined to say what his decision was.
Khomeini swears in president
Abolhassan Bani Sadr became Iran's first
president last night at the Tehran hospital
where ailing Ayatollah Ruhollah' Khomeini
swore him in and endorsed him before a televi
sion audience.
Earlier in the day the 79-year-old Khomeini
condemned the So\iet intervention in Af
ghanistan and swore "unconditional support"
for the Moslem Afghan rebels.
At the hospital ceremony Bani Sadr pledged
to Khomeini and the broadcast audience that
he would work to rid the country of hundreds
of years of corruption brought on by successive
monarchical governments.
In return, Khomeini promised to endorse
and support Bani Sadr's electoral victory as
long as the new president followed the sacred
principles of Islam, abided by the constitution
and helped the poor and the oppressed.
Khomeini's public display of support for
Bani Sadr should prov ide the 46-year-old pres
ident with enormous political strength at least

in the initial stages of his four-year term.
During his brief tenure as Iran's foreign
minister last fall, Bani Sadr displayed a more
moderate approach to the American hostage
crisis than his successor, Sadegh Ghotbzadeh,
has.
Election of a parliament, expected in about a
month, will complete the transfer of power
from the shah.
Khomeini holds supreme power under the
new Islamic constitution and can dismiss Bani
Sadr if he wishes.
Ali advocates Games boycott
NAIROBI, Kenya — Muhammad Ali yes
terday carried President Jimmy Carter's cam
paign for an Olympic boycott to Kenya, where
he faced an enthusiastic public welcome but
also some comments that he is unsuited to the
job of special presidential envoy.
The Sunday Nation, eastern Africa's
largest-selling newspaper, said editorially that
Carter's decision to send Ali on an African tour
"is certainly a mistake."
Ali. 40, stepped oft the U.S. presidential
jetliner and, in an uncharacteristic diplomatic
style, immediately unleashed a verbal right-left
combination against racism. South Africa,
superpower intervention. Uncle Tomism and
slavery. He ended by admitting that the finer
points of Africa confused him.
"I'm not Carter's whuppin' boy," he de
clared to a delighted news conference of mostly
Kenyan journalists. "I'm not selling America
or American policy. If America did something
wrong against my people in the past, America
was wrong. I'm not here to take the blame.
"I didn't slave nobody, I didn't break no
body. I didn't bribe nobody. I've been invited
three times to South Africa and I didn't go. I'm
against South Africa. But Carter's trying to do
things better. Change things. Best president
we've had.
"Now, I been told and I read in the newspap
ers that Russia is going in by force and taking
Africa and hopes one day probably to impose
its ways, which are atheists, on the world. My
mission is just and right, to help stop a nuclear
war.
Aeroflot jet stalemate ended
NEW YORK — An agreement to end a two
day delay in the takeoff of a Moscow-bound jet
carrying 80 passengers was reached yesterday
between the Soviet airline Aeroflot and
operators of Kennedy International Airport.
Ground crews at the airport, members of the

Teamsters union, had refused for two days to
service the Aerotlot jet as a protest against
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
The plane was expected to depart during the
evening after being serviced by management
officials of a private company, according to a
release from the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which runs the airport.
"The agreement, which was reached with the
concurrence and participation of the U.S. State
Department, specifies that Aerotlot will not
come into Kennedy Airport on further
scheduled flights until it has made arrange
ments with another carrier already serving the
airport to handle them," the Port Authority
statement said.
The agreement ended a growing dispute be
tween the two governments over the refusal of
crews to service the jet that landed here Sun
day, despite orders from the Port Authority to
land at Dulles Airport in Washington, D.C. It
was not known why the plane's crew ignored
the order.
Russians pressure Sakharov
MOSCOW — Soviet authorities have
threatened further sanctions against both dis
sident physicist Andrei Sakharov and his wife
in the wake of public comments that he made
through her following his banishment from
Moscow two weeks ago, it was revealed here
yesterday.
But the SS-year-old Nobel Prize winner
nonetheless affirmed in a new statement that
he would "refuse to submit" to what he charac
terized as an illegal and arbitrary deprivation of
his civil and political rights.
The latest Sakharov statement was dated
Sunday and was read to Western reporters by
his wife, Yelana Bonner, in the couples' former
Moscow home yesterday afternoon. Bonner
arrived in the Soviet capital yesterday morning
after spending the weekend with her husband
in the Volga River city of Gorky, to which he
was banished two weeks ago.
Sakharov was apparently banished by execu
tive order, although he has only been allowed
to read a second order of the Supreme Soviet
stripping him of all the state awards and honors
he earned during a 20-year career in the Soviet
nuclear weapons program.
Brown vetoes anti-busing bill
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Jerry Brown vet
oed an anti-busing bill yesterday that would
have required civil rights groups to prove in
court that a school district was no longer inten

tionally segregated.
State Sen. Alan Robbins (D-Van Nuys),
labeled Brown's veto of his SB 1244 as "desp
erate presidential politics" and said he ex
pected to seek an override of the democratic
governor's veto.
"By vetoing this bill in the face of over
whelming voter sentiment against lorced bus
ing, he (Brown) is hoping to appear as a hero to
pro-busing political contributors in the East,"
Robbins said.
"The governor's veto shows a contempt for
the voters of California who in November
voted almost 70 percent against forced bus
ing," Robbins said.
The measure would have excluded Califor
nia from U.S. Supreme Court decisions which
have said school districts such as Los Angeles,
where intentional segregation has once been
found, must prove in future court cases that
they are no longer deliberately segregated.
Opponents, such as the American Civil
Liberties Union, have likened the bill to the
attempts by the southern states in the 1950s
and 1960s to pass laws that would exclude
them from federal civil rights statutes and rul
ings.
NFL Raiders near LA move
LOS ANGELES — A lawyer for the Oak
land Raiders said yesterday the National Foot
ball League club is ready to move here next fall
if a federal judge exempts the team from an
NFL rule requiring that the move be approved
by 21 of the 28 NFL team owners.
"As of the weekend, we believe that if the
(Los Angeles Memorial) Coliseum can deliver
what it promises to deliver — and he believes
it can — we have an agreement," said Joseph
Alioto, former mayor of San Francisco, who is
representing the Raiders in their negotiations
with the Coliseum.
"We are prepared to conclude a written con
tract this week and start construction next
week," Alioto told U.S. District Judge Harry
Pregerson.
Both Alioto and Coliseum Commission
lawyer Maxwell Belcher stressed that a quick
and favorable ruling is necessary if the Col
iseum is to complete construction work it has
promised the Raiders in time for the 1980-81
season.
Pregerson did not say when he would make a
decision. However, he ended the hearing by
asking both Belcher and NFL attorney Henry
Thumann how quickly they could be ready to
present arguments at a full trial.
