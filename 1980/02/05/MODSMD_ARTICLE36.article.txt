# College Bowl champs look to regional competition
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
"What class of metals is classified by
filled d-orbitals?"
No, this was not a question on a
Chemistry 33 midterm but a sample
College Bowl query. Answering ques
tions like this, the Sociopaths defeated
23 other Stanford teams in Tresidder
Union Jan. 26. The team moves on to a
berth in the regional contest in Los
Angeles Feb. 23.
Members of the Sociopaths are
juniors Tom Gazzola (captain). Char
lie Brown. Tom Bellavia and Nina Mil
ler; Bill Carpenter, from the second
place Village Green team, is the team
alternate. The College Bowl tourna
ment here was sponsored by Student
Arts at Stanford (STARTS).

According to Brown, eight to 10
western teams will compete at UCLA,
the College Bowl regional headquar
ters.
The regional winner will fly to the
national competition in either Miami
or Honolulu, said Gazzola. Miami has
been the contest site for the past two
years.
The Sociopaths will play a Stanford
faculty team and a UC-Berkelev stu
dent team in separate meets outside of
the regional competition, said Brown.
According to Jon Reider. a
graduate student here who competed
two years ago. the College Bowl started
as a television game show back in the
19505. The television program fea
tured four-person teams from colleges

around the nation.
11 was one of the only quiz shows left
on the air after the fraud-related TV
game show scandals of the late '50s,
said Reider.
But because of the college protest
program against program sponsor
General Electric's involvement in the
Vietnam war efforts, the program was
ended early in the '70s, he said.
However, Reader's Digest and
Smith-Corona reinstated the program
three years ago as a broad-based inter
collegiate activity.
Reider's team won the nationals two
years ago after beating Yale and Cor
nell and went to the international com
petition in England. "Last year the
Stanford team didn't get past regional
California, though," said Reider.

The Sociopaths won two of their con
tests in the tournament last Saturday by
five points out of 350. "It depends a lot
on where the questions fall," said
Brown.
The Sociopath tfcam members have
played together since freshman year.
Last year they placed second in the
tournament here.
Brown and Miller were on a similar
team together in high school. The
Sociopaths formed when Miller, Bel
lavia and Gazzola lived in a freshman
dorm together.
"People are really fast. If we do at all
well in the regionals we'll be sur
prised," said Miller.
The questions range from finishing a
quote to naming a play, a chemical
formula, or the Seven Dwarfs, she ad

ded.
Gazzola said one question from last
Saturday's contest involved taking the
year of the defeat of the Spanish Ar
mada (1588), adding the number of
notes in a Mendelian scale (12), divid
ing by the number of legs of a curlew
bird (two) and subtracting the number
of hills in Rome (seven).
He guessed the correct number: 793.
Individual team members answer
questions in all areas. However, Brown
basically specializes in science, Miller
in the Bible and chemistry and Gazzola
in philosophy. "Other than that we
don't specialize," said Brown.
Gazzola got the idea for his team's
name which means people who don't
like other people, from his human biol
ogy course.
