Staff lunch
Editors and staffers are urged to at
tend the staff lunch today at noon in
Daily office. Three at-large members
of the editorial board will be elected.
Yummy sandwiches will be served.
Correction
In yesterday's article, "Students, fa
culty criticize lack of Arab-related
studies here," the cost of establishing a
chair in Middle East studies was er
roneously given as $14 million. The fi
gure should have been $1.5 million.
The Daily regrets the error.
