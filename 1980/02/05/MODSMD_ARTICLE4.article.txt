# Bribe charges prompt action
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
The government lodged its first crim
inal charges yesterday in the FBl's
14-month political corruption investi
gation as Congress opened its own in
quiries into the undercover probe that
has implicated seven House members
and a senator.
The FBI reportedly videotaped sev
eral members of Congress taking
money from undercover agents posing
as Arab sheiks or their representatives.
It is part of the U.S. political system
for members of Congress to take
money or things of value legally.
Mostly this is in the form of cam
paign contributions or honorariums.
Often the money is given in the hope
that the receiving member of Congress
will someday vote the giver's way.
Bribes
How is an illegal bribe any different?
For a prosecutor, the essential ques
tion is whether he can prove — beyond
a reasonable doubt — that a suspect
acted corruptly. He has to show intent,
and that is often hard to do (though it
could be less so in this case because of
the videotapes).
The first formal charges arising from
the FBI investigation were filed against
an Immigration and Naturalization
Service investigator in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Alexander Andrews Alexandro Jr.,
29, of Commack, N.Y., was arraigned
before a U.S. magistrate and was for
mally charged with one count of brib
ery and one count of conspiracy.
Officials said the government might
begin presenting evidence against
other public officials to several grand
juries later this week.
All the subjects in the probe, some
20 public officials and 10 businessmen
and lawyers, were visited by the FBI
over the weekend and notified that
they were under investigation, one
source said.
Eight Congressmen
In addition to state and local officials
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
sources said those who became sub
jects of the FBI investigation included
Sen. Harrison Williams Jr. (D-N.J.),
and Reps. John Murphy (D-N.Y.);
Frank Thompson Jr. (D-N.J.); Michael
Myers (D-Pa.); Raymond Lederer
(D-Pa.); John Jenrette (D-S.C.); John
Murtha (D-Pa.); and Richard Kelly
(R-Fla.).
On Capitol Hill, congressional lead
ers expressed shock at reports linking
the eight lawmakers to the FBI investi

gation, and ethics committees in both
the House and Senate announced they
would conduct their own inquiries.
The House ethics committee quickly
called a meeting to begin its probe after
disclosure that FBI agents posed as
aides to a wealthy Arab sheik who was
willing to pay bribes to congressmen
and other officials in exchange for
political favors.
'Thorough investigation'
The chairman of the Senate Ethics
Committee, Sen. Howell Heflin (D-
Ala.), promised a "thorough investiga
tion" and said he had met earlier in the
day with FBI Director William Webs
ter and Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti.
Heflin said he discussed having the
FBI turn the results of its investigation
over to the ethics panel, but the Justice
Department officials did not im
mediately offer to do so.
"The problem is that all the evi
dence, all the tapes, all the videotapes
are in the hands of the Department of
Justice," Heflin said. "We are depen
dent upon them."
The House committee took no ac
tion on a proposal to subpoena the vid
eotapes before they become wrapped
up in grand jury proceedings.
Alexandra's attorney, Joel Winog
rad, told reporters that Alexandro,
whose job is to investigate illegal aliens
and corruption, was arrested Saturday
by the FBI. He said Alexandro was
held in a Manhattan Jail over the
weekend as part of a government effort
to try to get figures in the probe to
cooperate.
He said this treatment was "out
rageous and ironic" and that his client
had been tried in the newspapers. "I
believe that the information here was
leaked by the government to certain
publications and TV stations," Winog
rad said.
Meanwhile, Justice Department
spokesman Robert Smith announced a
separate investigation into how the
story was leaked to the news media.
"The disclosures by the media are
regrettable because they may injure
the reputation of innocent people,"
Smith said. He said the Office of Pro
fessional Responsibility, which polices
the conduct of Justice Department and
FBI employees, "will initiate an inten
sive investigation to see whether delib
erate disclosures have been made by
federal employees."

a reasonable doubt — that a suspect
acted corruptly. He has to show intent,
and that is often hard to do (though it
could be less so in this case because of
the videotapes).
The first formal charges arising from
the FBI investigation were filed against
an Immigration and Naturalization
Service investigator in Brooklyn, N.Y.
Alexander Andrews Alexandro Jr.,
29, of Commack, N.Y., was arraigned
before a U.S. magistrate and was for
mally charged with one count of brib
ery and one count of conspiracy.
Officials said the government might
begin presenting evidence against
other public officials to several grand
juries later this week.
All the subjects in the probe, some
20 public officials and 10 businessmen
and lawyers, were visited by the FBI
over the weekend and notified that
they were under investigation, one
source said.
Eight Congressmen
In addition to state and local officials
in New Jersey and Pennsylvania,
sources said those who became sub
jects of the FBI investigation included
Sen. Harrison Williams Jr. (D-N.J.),
and Reps. John Murphy (D-N.Y.);
Frank Thompson Jr. (D-N.J.); Michael
Myers (D-Pa.); Raymond Lederer
(D-Pa.); John Jenrette (D-S.C.); John
Murtha (D-Pa.); and Richard Kelly
(R-Fla.).
On Capitol Hill, congressional lead
ers expressed shock at reports linking
the eight lawmakers to the FBI investi

gation, and ethics committees in both
the House and Senate announced they
would conduct their own inquiries.
The House ethics committee quickly
called a meeting to begin its probe after
disclosure that FBI agents posed as
aides to a wealthy Arab sheik who was
willing to pay bribes to congressmen
and other officials in exchange for
political favors.
'Thorough investigation'
The chairman of the Senate Ethics
Committee, Sen. Howell Heflin (D-
Ala.), promised a "thorough investiga
tion" and said he had met earlier in the
day with FBI Director William Webs
ter and Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti.
Heflin said he discussed having the
FBI turn the results of its investigation
over to the ethics panel, but the Justice
Department officials did not im
mediately offer to do so.
"The problem is that all the evi
dence, all the tapes, all the videotapes
are in the hands of the Department of
Justice," Heflin said. "We are depen
dent upon them."
The House committee took no ac
tion on a proposal to subpoena the vid
eotapes before they become wrapped
up in grand jury proceedings.
Alexandra's attorney, Joel Winog
rad, told reporters that Alexandro,
whose job is to investigate illegal aliens
and corruption, was arrested Saturday
by the FBI. He said Alexandro was
held in a Manhattan Jail over the
weekend as part of a government effort
to try to get figures in the probe to
cooperate.
He said this treatment was "out
rageous and ironic" and that his client
had been tried in the newspapers. "I
believe that the information here was
leaked by the government to certain
publications and TV stations," Winog
rad said.
Meanwhile, Justice Department
spokesman Robert Smith announced a
separate investigation into how the
story was leaked to the news media.
"The disclosures by the media are
regrettable because they may injure
the reputation of innocent people,"
Smith said. He said the Office of Pro
fessional Responsibility, which polices
the conduct of Justice Department and
FBI employees, "will initiate an inten
sive investigation to see whether delib
erate disclosures have been made by
federal employees."
From the Daily wire services
The government lodged its first crim
inal charges yesterday in the FBl's
14-month political corruption investi
gation as Congress opened its own in
quiries into the undercover probe that
has implicated seven House members
and a senator.
The FBI reportedly videotaped sev
eral members of Congress taking
money from undercover agents posing
as Arab sheiks or their representatives.
It is part of the U.S. political system
for members of Congress to take
money or things of value legally.
Mostly this is in the form of cam
paign contributions or honorariums.
Often the money is given in the hope
that the receiving member of Congress
will someday vote the giver's way.
Bribes
How is an illegal bribe any different?
For a prosecutor, the essential ques
tion is whether he can prove — beyond
a reasonable doubt — that a suspect
acted corruptly. He has to show intent,
and that is often hard to do (though it
could be less so in this case because of
the videotapes).
The first formal charges arising from
the FBI investigation were filed against
