# New Mexico prison riot deaths reach 35

SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) â€” An
execution squad armed with blow
torches and axes tortured and mur
dered fellow inmates during the 36
hours of hell behind the walls of the
New Mexico State Penitentiary, in
mates said yesterday. Officials said 35
and perhaps 39 died and 15 others
were missing.
"I saw some people cutting a dude's
eyes out with a cutting torch," one
prisoner told reporters allowed inside
the smoldering prison that was recap
tured by National Guardsmen and
police Sunday afternoon after a day
and a half of rioting.
The horror encountered during yes
terday's search for more bodies caused
some Guardsmen to vomit.
Many of those targets for violence
apparently were informers, whose
identity became known when confiden
tial records in the administration build
ing were seized, authorities said. The
victims were attacked with cleavers and
burned.
"From what we understand there
was no racial tension involved," said
state police Maj. Charlie Anaya. "It

was getting all the snitchers."
Late Sunday, 32 prisoner deaths had
been confirmed, said Anaya.
Warden Jerry Griffin said late yes
terday afternoon that all fires were out.
He told families of inmates and re
porters that a list of the dead and in
jured was being prepared and said rela
tives of the dead were being notified.
Griffin said he could confirm only 35
deaths, conflicting with reports of 39
dead from Gov. Bruce King.
King said 32 bodies had been found
in the compound and seven other pris
oners were dead on arrival at local hos
pitals suffering overdoses of drugs. Fif
teen inmates were still unaccounted for
in the nation's worst prison riot since
the Attica uprising in 1971 left 43
people dead in New York state.
Officials feared the death toll would
soar when the contents of the prison's
charred gymnasium were known.
Thick smoke still poured from the
gymnasium ruins late Sunday, more
than 12 hours after the blaze began.
Damage to the facility was estimated at
$10 million or more.
A reconstruction of the 36-hour

siege follows:
In the predawm hours Saturday, four
prison guards strolled through the stark
halls of the New Mexico State Peniten
tiary. They had just another two hours
to go before they would be relieved by
the 4 a.m. shift.
Then, without warning, a man dres
sed in a guard uniform and carrying a
flashlight and a homemade knife con
fronted them. As the guards struggled
to grab the knife, they were surrounded
by other inmates who blindfolded, beat
and stabbed them.
The presoner revolt had begun.
After Gov. Bruce King was called
and told the inmates had seized the
prison, he called on the Santa Fe police
special weapons team and the National
Guard to encircle the area.
Inside the huge complex holding
more than 1100 prisoners, convicts
shattered security glass in the prison's
control room, taking charge of the
radio system. Others raided the ad
ministration building, slashing and
tearing down everything in sight.
Fires fueled by confidential records
and prison mattresses were started and

smoke poured out into the frigid night.
Outside the main fence, state offi
cials and reporters were told the in
mates were holding the prison guards
hostage.
Thick smoke billowed from prison
buildings where 14 guards, theircondi
tion unknown, were being held hos
tage. Warden Jerry Griffin appeared at
6 a.m. to tell reporters that fires were
burning in the administration building,
the psychiatric unit and some dor
mitories.
Shortly after noon Saturday, the
governor told reporters that 10 or more
inmates were dead. But radio conver
sations between inmates hi nted of even
greater horrors.
At 1:45 p.m. Sunday the governor
ordered the special weapons team in to
recapture the prison. King said he
made the decision because all the hos
tages were safe.
National Guardsmen marched in
five minutes later to finish securing the
prison. The seige was over. No shots
had been fired.
