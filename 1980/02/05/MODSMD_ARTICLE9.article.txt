# Daily Cal avoids bankruptcy threat
## 
### Cathy Gewertz Staff Writer 
The Daily Californian, UC-Berkeley's student news
paper, can breathe easier now that it is no longer threatened
with bankruptcy and foreclosure.
Increased printing costs and financial mismanagement
nearly caused the Daily Cal to shut down last spring. The
paper was only able to meet its operating costs at the begin
ning of this year with a Berkeley Student Senate loan of
$52,000 obtained last spring.
The paper's financial problems date back to 1971, when
it became independent of the University. Since then, UC-
Berkeley has ceased its subsidies of faculty and staff sub
scriptions.
The Daily Cal was still making money until it decided to
add its own typesetting shop in 1976.
Complicating its financial situation further, revenue from
the paper's advertising began to drop, and the staff disco
vered that a third of the money owed to the paper from
advertisers was not collectable. All of the Daily Cal's finan
cial mishaps left it $117,000 in the hole this past September.
In an effort to save the Daily Cal, the paper's staff began
an energetic fund-raising drive, hoping to raise $87,000.
"We've made about $60,000 so far," said Daily Cal
general manager Craig Gordon, "and we're still pushing for

the rest."
The paper's main source of donations has been from
Berkeley alumni, Gordon said, with students' donations
running a close second.
The donation drive included a raffle, with prizes such as a
full page of space in the Daily Cul, one month ot free
parking near campus .and a tour of local bars. A piece of
land in Colorado which was donated by a Berkeley resident
has yet to be sold, Gordon added, and is expected to bring in
an additional $18,000.
In addition to its fundraising efforts, the newspaper has
done some internal reorganizing in order to use its money
more efficiently. According to associate editor Charles Bur
ress, the paper has cut down its size and increased'advertis
ing.
"We have a very strict advertising quota now," said Bur
ress. "It's a formula — the number of ads determines how
many pages the paper will be, in order to break even."
In addition, the paper has expanded and reorganized its
board of directors, cut back and consolidated its staff posi
tions in the business department and cut back its night staff.
"The students have been really great," said Gordon.
"They've given their money and expressed their support
from the start. They understand that it's been hard for us
here and their support has helped a lot."
