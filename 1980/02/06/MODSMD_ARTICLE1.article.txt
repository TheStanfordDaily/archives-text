# Lax nuke security detailed

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — A re
porter who got himself hired as a guard
at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant
later gained entry through an unlocked
door to the sensitive control room, his
newspaper reported yesterday in an ar
ticle the plant's operators tried to sup
press.
The Guide, a muckraking Harris
burg area weekly, printed copyright
stories about the exploits of cub repor
ter Robert Kapler following a court
battle in which Metropolitan Edison
Co. tried to block publication.
"TMI: it's a Paradise Island for the
saboteur," said one headline. "1 walt
zed into the unlocked control room of
Unit 2," said another.
Kapler said he was hired as an un
armed watchman, a low-level guard
who is not supposed to have access to
the control room. Armed guards, who
have a higher security clearance, do
have such access.
Unit 2 is the facility severely dam
aged last March in the worst accident in
the history of U.S. commercial nuclear
power. Its control room is where vital
reactor functions are still maintained.
The Guide published photographs
by Kapler identified as the interior of
the control room and an unlocked con
trol room door, with the knob missing
so that a piece of rope was used to pull
it open.
The photos were taken, the Guide
said, with a concealed Minox spy cam
era — "the kind the CIA uses."
The newspaper also detailed what it
claimed was laxity in the plant security
operation, which allowed Kapler to get
a job as a security guard with bogus
identification and apparently without
having his background checked.
Sandy Polon, a spokesman for Met
ropolitan Edison Co., declined com
ment on the newspaper articles as did
the contractor that supplies the com
pany with guards, Gregg Security Co.
The stories have thrust the Guide
into international attention. The 26-
year-old Kapler, who had never
worked for a newspaper before the
Guide hired him in November, has
been interviewed on national televi
sion, and the newspaper has received a
deluge of phone calls.
