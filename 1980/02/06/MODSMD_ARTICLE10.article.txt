# Soviets back massacre

### 
BOSTON (AP) — In a five
minute hail of automatic
weapons fire, Afghan soldiers
accompanied by Soviet advisors
allegedly killed more than 1000
men in an Afghanistan village
last year. The Christian Science
Monitor reported Monday.
Within minutes of the re
ported massacre April 20, 1979.
a bulldozer plowed the bodies,
some apparently still alive and
moving, into a field while surviv
ing males and the wives and chil
dren of the dead watched and
wailed, reported Edward Girar
det in an undated dispatch from
the Raghnai Pass on the Pakistan
border.
Girardet's account came from

among 400 families who reached
Pakistan as refugees from the vil
lage of Kerala, about 40 miles
from the Khyber Pass, on the
Pakistan border.
"Overall corroboration of tes
timonies by the survivors, many
of whom live miles apart, con
firms the magnitude of the kil
lings — although the exact
number of victims must remain
an estimate," he said in the
copyrighted article.
The reported shooting occur
red about one year after a
Soviet-backed regime took over
Afghanistan in a coup d'etat and
seven months before Soviet
troops entered the country in
large numbers.
