# State Dept. reports on human rights
## 
### George Gedda The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON —The State
Department, analyzing human
rights around the globe, reported
yesterday that Cambodia, Viet
nam and North Korea were
among the most violently repres
sive countries in the world.
The 154-nation study said
conditions generally have im
proved in Africa and Latin
America. But it was sharply criti
cal of the Soviet Union, estimat
ing the number of political pris
oners at between 2000 and
10,000 and stating that the re
gime "recognizes no right to any
opinion or behavior it chooses to
regard as deviant."
Although torture in the Soviet
Union is "less prevalent" than
before, the report said Soviet
prosecutors have not failed to
convict prisoners accused of
political crimes in the 62-year
history of the revolution.
In summary, the report said,
"impressive strides" were taken
in 1979 in the building of inter
national institutions for protect
ing human rights.
The study cited as one exam
ple a call by African nations for a
permanent Pan-African human
rights body as well as the new
American Convention on human
rights, which sets forth standards
for members of the Organization
of American States.
South Africa
Among non-communist coun
tries, the report was perhaps
most critical of South Africa,
where, it said, the non-white
majority "suffers pervasive dis
crimination in all areas of life;
their basic human rights are sys
tematically violated."
The annual report previously
was limited to analyses of reci
pients of U.S. military and
economic aid but this year was
broadened to include all coun
tries. The report is mandated
each year under a provision of
the Foreign Assistance Act.

China, the report said, has a
mixed record. There has been
"movement in the direction of
greater freedoms" in the years
since the death of Mao Tse-
Tung, including a livelier press, a
formal legal system and some to
lerance of dissent."
"But reforms have not yet
broken the entrenched patterns
of harassment, arbitrary arrest
and harsh punishment for politi
cal dissidents," the department
said.
Little judgment
The report refrains from pas
sing judgment. For the most
part, objective accounts pro
vided by human rights groups
and other sources are outlined
without comment.
Occasionally, however, the
State Department draws its own
subjective conclusions.
As an example, the report
stated flatly that "nowhere in the
world are human rights more be
leaguered than in Cambodia." In
the areas of Cambodia under the
control of Vietnamese occupa
tion troops, the report said, "the
conditions of life regressed to a
level of suffering" reminiscent of
the Khmer Rouge regime of
1975-78.
In Vietnam itself, the report
said tens of thousands are held in
re-education camps under harsh
conditions and that tens of
thousands more died at sea try
ing to escape the country.
Two Koreas
The report said repression in
North Korea is similar to that of
the Stalinist era in the Soviet Un
ion.
Conditions in South Korea
improved somewhat after the
October assassination of Presi
dent Park Chung Hee, although
censorship was continued and
political meetings banned.
Israel was given high marks for
its human rights performance
within the pre-1967 border, but
the report said some basic
guarantees have been suspended
in Israeli-held territories.
