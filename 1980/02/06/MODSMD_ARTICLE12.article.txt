# Americans maintain vigil on tense Korean border

PANMUNJOM, South Korea — His
cheeks pink from the cold, Pfc. James
Wood. 20, of Fulton, N.Y., 6 feet 3'/a
inches tall, 187 pounds, stood at Outpost
5 in the Joint Security Area at Pammun
jom and let his eyes travel over the frozen
brown hills of North Korea, enemy coun
try.
The war ended on this spot seven years
before Wood was born. But there is no
•peace, only an armistice, and despite the
cold. Wood likes it here.
"A place like this looks good on your
record book," he said, not taking his eyes
off the terrain in front of him. "You've got
to be good to get here and stav here."
Wood is one of 250 handpicked U.S.
soldiers — all must be at least 6 feet tall,
weigh at least 180 pounds and have a
high-school education — assigned to the
United Nations Security Command.
Panmunjom is the one place along the
151-mile-long demilitarized zone where
representatives of the two sides meet to
make propaganda, exchange insults, or,
occasionally, do each other a favor, de
pending on the mood at the time.
Recently the North Koreans did the
Americans a rare favor. When a U.S. pla
toon on patrol in the demilitarized zone
became lost in fog and strayed into a
North Korean mine field, the Americans
promptly admitted their error and asked
the communists to help recover the body
of a soldier they had left behind. The
North Koreans obliged, with a minimum
of fuss.
'Decent thing'
"It was only the decent thing for them
to do," an American officer said, "since
we were in the wrong and admitted it. But
the 'decent thing' is what we've learned

not to expect from the North Koreans."
There is a tree stump beside the road
not far from Outpost 5 that is a reminder
of another kind of communist behavior. It
marks the spot where the U.S. officers
were axed to death four years ago while
on a tree-trimming mission.
"I think we were more stunned than
angry at such an incredible display of
savagery," an American who was here at
the time said. "I also think we were a lot
closer to war than any of us realized at the
time."
In the stillness of winter, Korea could
hardly look more peaceful. China has
given its tacit blessing to the continued
presence of U.S. troops in South Korea
and the north is now engaged in one of its
periodic "peace offensives" after the as
sassination of President Park Chung Hee
on Oct. 26.
"We went on the alert the moment it
happened," a senior U.S. officer said.
"Then they went on the alert in response
to our alert. But nothing happened."
Six weeks after Park's death, the coun
try was jolted again when the martial
law commander and other high military
leaders were arrested by rival officers, os
tensibly for investigation of possible in
volvement in the assassination. The dust
still has not settled from this Dec. 12
"coup," which removed many of the older
Japanese-trained generals who had
dominated the army.
100 command changes
Since that date there have been about
100 command changes, down to division
level, with the South Korean army.
"I guess you might call it a changing of
the guard," an American officer said
dryly.
But there is no indication that the

shakeup has damaged the army's fighting
ability. And the hope is that once they
have sorted things out among themselves,
the "young officers" will lift martial law
and allow the country to return to civilian
rule.
But there is no feeling here that this is a
time to relax.
The Soviet invasion and occupation of
Afghanistan had its impact here, not that
anyone seriously thinks there might be a
repeat performance on the Korean Penin
sula.
"Afghanistan was a low-risk operation
for the Russians," a defense analyst said.
"Korea would be a very high-risk opera
tion, for a Soviet-backed invasion by
North Korea would inevitably mean war
with the United States. We would have no
choice but to fight."
After causing a lot of concern among
the South Koreans, the Japanese and U.S.
military men. President Jimmy Carter last
year reversed his earlier decision to with
draw U.S. ground forces from South
Korea.
Change of mind
The change of mind came after the Pen
tagon learned that it had grossly undere
stimated North Korean military strength.
Current U.S. strength in South Korea is
somewhere in excess of 30,000 men, in
cluding the 12,000-man 2nd Division and
four squadrons of F-4 Phantom fighter
planes with 7000 men, plus smaller units.
The 2nd Division is held in reserve as
tride a classic invasion route north of
Seoul. But 2nd Division soldiers still man
two guard posts inside the demilitarized
zone. Another unit provides security for
the U.N. Command at Panmunjom.
"We like to think we would put up a
good fight in the event of an attack," a
senior American officer said. "But the

main purpose of our presence is to serve
as a deterrent. An attack on South Korea
becomes an attack on the United States."
Judged by all the usual criteria, the
520,000-man South Korean army would
be more than a match for the North Ko
reans, even though it may be outclassed in
terms of some types of equipment. Milit
ary sources said North Korean tanks out
number the south's two to one.
In population, the south outnumbers
the north by more than two to one — 35
million to 17 million. But this numerical
advantage is offset by several factors. One
is that the advantage lies with the at
tacker, which in this case would be North
Korea. Another is that the North Korean
economy is geared largely to war while
the south's is a free-enterprise system.
Crucial first days
U.S. sources said North Korea has
enough supplies stockpiled to wage a
short war without outside support. The
first few days of any such war would be
crucial, for Seoul lies only 25 miles from
the demilitarized zone and there would be
little time or terrain for maneuvering.
It is a geopolitical cliche to say that the
political and military interests of four
great powers — the United States, the
Soviet Union, China and Japan — con
verge in northeast Asia. It is also true.
And the focal point of that convergence is
Korea, where nearly a million men are
under arms.
Given the shifting nature of Asian
power politics these days, all that is a
heady combination. No one expects a war
to break out in Korea today. But then,
nobody expected it to happen in 1950.
As for Pfc. J;»mes Wood, he wili be
transferred out of here in another month;
he hopes to go to the U.S. Berlin Brigade.
He will be replaced.
