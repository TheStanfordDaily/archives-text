# Local church group gives food to needy
## 
### Diana Hoffman Staff Writer 
r The word "hunger" tends to
evoke images of malnourished
children in far-off lands; how
ever, hunger poses a very real
threat to many members ol
nearby communities. I he Ecu
menical Hunger Program
(EHP), a local service organiza
tion, seeks to reduce the threat ol
hunger in the East Bayshore
community.
The program was created in
1975 as a project of Church
Women United. EHP, which
serves needy persons from a var
iety of racial and ethnic groups,
relies upon volunteers and a
small stall to accomplish its two
basic tasks: the distribution of
unwanted or surplus food, clo
thing and furniture to those in
need and the development of
community self-help projects
within the East Bayshore area.
EHP's two offices are located
in East Palo Alto and East
Menlo Park. The program is run
by five paid staffers, several of
whom are residents of East
Bayshore, and a board of direc
tors. Volunteers assist with office
work and the procuration, pac
kaging and distribution of food.
Various religious groups, corpo
rations, foundations and indi
viduals provide funds for the
program.
Food is collected from a
number of sources. These in
clude the San Jose Food Bank, a
warehouse which stores food
that would otherwise be wasted,
and the California Food Net
work, which collects food on a
statewide basis. Other sources of
unwanted-but-edible food arc
restaurants, farms, packing
houses, wholesalers and indi
viduals. Finally, EHP buys some
food in bulk to ensure that food
baskets are nutritionally ba
lanced.
After being collected by EHP
volunteers, food is brought to the
First Congregational Church in
Palo Alto for packaging. Pac
kaged food and other items are
then sent to one of the 17 food
"closets" located in Palo Alto,
East Palo Alto and East Menlo
Park. Each closet is run by a
manager — usually a resident of
a, nearby neighborhood— who
allots a week's supply of food to
each eligible household. An es
timated 400 to 500 people
weekly receive food under Ihis
system. " *'
According to Byron Bland,
chairman of EHP's Board of Di
rectors and a minister with the
University Campus Christian
Ministry, persons receiving food
may be divided into two groups:
those who require emergency as
sistance and those with chronic
food needs. Bland said that many
people fall into the latter categ
ory because they must give top
priority to paying bills for shel
ter. energy and health care be
fore beginning to purchase food.
Hunger in nearby com

munities is considered to he a
"very serious" problem by
HHP's executive director, Ayida
Tengemana. According to
Tengemana, rents have nearly
doubled in the last three years;
meanwhile, the unemployment
rate is as high as 60 percent in
some neighborhoods. EHP st
rives to deal with such problems,
which are indirect causes of
hunger, through a number of
community self-help projects.
One proposed strategy for re
ducing dependency on food aid
and promoting self-reliance
among members of the East
Bayshore community would be
the presentation of EHP
sponsored workshops. These
workshops would be planned ac
cording to the needs and desires
of local residents and would
probably deal with topics such as
English as a second language,
nutrition, job-hunting and
health.
Other EHP projects include
the planning of a community
gardening project and a com
munity market. The gardening
project will help members of the
East Bayshore community to es
tablish home gardens, while the
goal of the latter project is the
creation of a non-profit market.
Although the EHP offices are
located in East Bayshore, the
program does desire contact with
the University campus. Three
students here, all members of the
Stanford Committee on I lunger,
are currently preparing to act as
liaisons between the EHP and
the Stanford community. In ad
dition to doing volunteer work
for EHP. assessing its financial
needs and examining its re
sources. the students are helping
to plan a fund-raising dinner that
will benefit EHP. The dinner,
sponsored by the Stanford
Committee on Hunger, will be
given Feb. 9 at El Toro Eating
Club.
The Ecumenical Hunger
Program is expanding rapidly.
The number of food closets has
increased from three or four in
1975 to 17 now and the number
of families receiving Christmas
aid through an EHP-managed
project has risen to over 1500.
