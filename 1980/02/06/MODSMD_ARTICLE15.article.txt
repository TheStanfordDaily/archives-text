# Riots possible for Calif. prisons
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — California Health and
Welfare secretary Mario Obledo warned yesterday
that a prison riot similar to New Mexico's could
happen in California if overcrowding is not re
lieved at state prisons.
"There's no question about it," Obledo said at a
news conference. "A New Mexico prison situation
can very possibly occur here."
Prisons in San Quentin, Soledad and Vacaville
are already overcrowded, Obledo said, and
California has so far avoided the kind of violence
that wracked a prison in Santa Fe, N.M., this
weekend only "because we have been lucky" and
because of outstanding work by prison personnel.
But if prisoners continue to pour into institutions
at current rates, he said, "it'll be one or two months
before we reach capacity."
"The potential for something like that is always
present in a prison. To suggest it couldn't happen is
foolish," Philip Guthrie, a deputy director in the
state Corrections Department, said in an interview
in Sacramento.
He noted that a prison riot caused $1 million in
property damage last year at Susanville, and two
persons were killed in a recent disturbance at Sol
edad.
But he said California prisons have "quite a bit
better staffing" than New Mexico, and the state has
a more extensive systems of appeals for prisoners'
grievances.
The possibility of a prison riot was raised by
Michael Cantrall, executive director of the
California Public Defenders Association.
"If state officials fail to remedy the'lock-em-up'
mentality, and if we fail to improve the grossly

inadequate prison facilities that exist in California,
then we will he dealing with another Attica in no
time." Cantrall said in a statement.
Obledo said he has asked the legislature for S1 20
million to finance new prison planning and con
struction.
Noting that damages from the Santa Fe riot are
estimated at $20 million, he added: "We should he
taking some money and making improvements
rather than seeking money after the fact in order to
rebuild what has already heen destroyed."
New Mexico has not asked California to house
any prisoners while repairs are heing made, Üb
ledo said, hut added that California would proba
bly have to decline any such request because of lack
of space.
'"We have only 500 empty beds," Übledo said.
There are some 22,000 inmates in California pris
ons.
Obledo called the news conference to publicize a
task force conducting statewide hearings on the
reasons behind the recent sharp increase in the
percentage of minority groups in the prisons' popu
lation.
Ten years ago, he said, three out of every 10
prisoners was a minority group member.
"Minorities now constitute 60 to 70 percent of
our prison population," he said.
I ie said some minority communities complain of
being "overpoliced," and minority defendants are
often inadequately represented in the courts and
end up accepting disadvantageous plea bargains.
Minority prisoners "often are view by the system
as high-risk probation candidates," and are there
lore not granted early parole.
