SEATTLE (AP) — A Stan
lord University radiologist and
six other mountain climbers plan
an assault on Pakistan's 26,000-
foot Gasherbrum IV this sum
mer, buoyed by only a small
budget and an old-fashioned al
pine style climbing.
Donald Fredrickson, 3ft, a
radiology physicist with the Stan
lord Medical Center, is a
member of the seven-man
mountain climbing team which
will leave in May for the trek.
Steve Swenson of Seattle, ex
pedition leader, said the pointed
cone mountain in the
Karakoram Range, overlooking
China, has been successfully
climbed onlv once.

That was in 1 95S by an Italian
team, which also ascended in al
pine style — meaning climbers
used no bottled oxygen, porters
or hauling supplies from camp to
camp on the ascent.
While most major expeditions
require big money and fat piles
of equipment, Swenson said the
attack on Gasherbrum IV will
cost a relatively meager $40,000
and use porters only to the
17,000-foot base camp.
Irom there it's"just us against
the mountain — no bottled oxy
gon. no native guides, no yo
yoing up and down the mountain
to various support camps," he
said.
