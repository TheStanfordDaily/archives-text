## Val Runge Bicycle safety matters 
### 
Have you ever wondered who that crazy fool w as
that whizzed by you on his bike at noon in White
Plaza, nearly amputating your arm or leg? 1 have a
confession to make. Maybe it was me. Sure, I scat
ter pedestrians and run stop signs with delight. But
having been elected to the ASSU Senate, I teel I
must reform my evil ways. More importantly, hav
ing been the coordinator with the police depart
ment lor Bicycle Safety Week (Feb. 11-17). it
might be embarrassing to be arrested now.
I've had only one serious accident ($4O and a few
bruises) but I've witnessed quite a few that re
quired an ambulance. And 1 swear on Scout's
Honor (I was never a Scout) that I've never hit a
pedestrian. However I've seen more than a few do
it.
What's wrong with the American way of life?
University students pride themselves on their
maturity, yet ride around like madmen. Is the time
that crucial? Lest I offend all of my audience, if
you're not a madman (or madperson), always ride
your bike like an angel, and have never nearly been
assassinated on your bike, you can stop here. This
article's not for you.
Constructively, what can bicycle riders do to im
prove the situation? First, slow down! Consider
whether it would be better to be one or two minutes
late, and your friends still your friends, or to arrive
in several pieces (or to have left someone else's
nerves in several pieces). Second, be courteous.
Third, remember that rules have reasons behind
them. Stop signs are here for a purpose. And if you
can't think of one. the police might be able to give
you a S2O one in the upcoming weeks.
Signaling to turn is required by law if you can
believe it. but it makes more sense in terms of fewer
broken nerves and bones. Use a light at night, don't
be a turkey. Let's avoid another tragedy like the
one that occurred a number of years ago in front of
Wilbur on Escondido Road. If you are not aware of
Â° that incident, ask one of the old ones around. It was
at night and it wasn't funny: it was a fatality.
On the lighter side, perhaps you might consider
leaving your bike home when it rains. It might just
be safer. And at 1 1 a.m. and noon in White
Plaza, when the sunshine returns, it might make
sense to walk the bike.

Bicycle Safety Week is riot for bicycles alone, but
also for motorcycles and mopeds. The problem has
grown to such proportions in recent years that both
University and ASSU Senate Committees have
considered the issue this year. To set the record
straight, it is illegal to ride a motorcycle any where a
car is not permitted.
The same goes for mopeds, with the one excep
tion that they may be peddled (with the motor off)
any where. This means that most of the inner cam
pus is off limits to motorcycles and mopeds, unless
the moped is being peddled. And I've never seen a
moped being peddled, except once, when I thought
it was being stolen.
To add another technicality, it is illegal to park a
motor vehicle within 100 feet of a building (for fire
safety reasons). So remember the next time you
park your motorcycle that it must be in a place cars
park.
Motorcycles and mopeds on the inner campus
just don't make sense. They are dangerous to
pedestrians and bicycle riders as well. In the con
text of a gas shortage, they are ridiculous when one
can use a bicycle just as well. And in terms of
health, which concerns me as a medical student,
they are insane. The rider passes up the chance to
improve his health (if he rode a bike or walked
instead) and perhaps extend his life a few years. He
also angers and endangers the rest of us who must
breathe his exhaust.
The problem is not small but widespread. I know
varsity athletes. ASSU Senators and even a pleas
antly plump, very famous science professor (who
can ill afford to pass up the exercise) who all ride
their mopeds randomly with delight through the
campus and White Plaza.
The ASSU Senate has developed and organized
Bicycle Safety Week, so take advantage of it.
Around noon in White Plaza, next Monday
through Friday, there will be a booth with bicycle
registration, safety information, bicycle safety
equipment (at cost) and free popcorn! The police
will be stepping up their patrols at.d ticketing as
well, so it's time to behave.
Perhaps the best advice can be given in just three
words. Patient, heal thyself.
