## Records subject to gov search 
### 
Even though the Stanford
Daily has the best journalistic
track record for reporting the
broad issues related to the Sup
reme Court decision in Stanford
Daily vs. Zurcher, the real issue
is the grow ing erosion of the Bill
of Rights by the Supreme Court
through legislation.
The Daily's story of Jan. 9
stated that most journalists "are
not happy with legislation that
protects only the press." It con
tinues. "The press is lobbying for
Congressional legislation that
would . . . protect other profes
sionals . . . and ideally all inno
cent third parties." But in fact, as
the following will show, the press
might be in tacit collusion with
the federal government to not
push for broad protection under
the Bill of Rights.
Search and seizure has be
come widespread in areas other
than the press. No newspaper,
including the Daily, carried the
whole story. The initial phase of
the search with its antecedents
was well publicised, and was the
only issue presented to the Sup
reme Court.
What has been ignored is the
second phase of the original legal
story. Not many weeks after the
first phase, the same District At
torney (DA) sought and re
ceived a search warrant and in
vaded the files of psychiatric pa
tients at the Stanford outpatient
clinic. They sought the records of
one patient who was the com
plainant, not the defendant, in
an alleged homosexual attack or
molestation. The search warrant
covered the medical school clinic
and the car and home of the pa
tient's psychiatrist. The docu
ments indicate that the pretext
for the raid was that Stanford
was in collusion with the defen
dant.
Other avenues for getting the
records were also available be
cause the patient, as the com
plainant, was essentially a client
of the DA.
The facts of the case indicate
there would be no reason for
anyone at Stanford to hide or de
stroy records — the issue in the
Daily search. However, there is a
California law. supported by the
California and U.S. Constitu
tions, that makes such files

privileged and defensible against
subpoenas unless the patient in
vokes his psychiatric condition as
a claim or defense. As the com
plainant for whom the DA was
acting, he does not fit this excep
tion.
Further, with the patient's
permission, which the DA had
apparently, there was a legal
right to access either through
Section 1158 or the general re
lease by the patient who "owns"
the privilege. The continued
search of the files of all patients
was stopped only when the hos
pital officials came to the clinic
and pointed out there were no
additional records other than the
brief notes.
The above facts were then pre
sented to the trial court as an
adjunct to the Stanford Daily
case. 1 presented an affadavit,
along with another psychiatrist,
indicating how such violations of
privacy discourage free expre
sion by patients and have a de
structive effect on the treatment
of all psychiatric patients. It was
on the basis of this second phase
that the federal court then or
dered the imposition of $47,000
in costs and attorney fees. And it
was this penalty that led to the
appeal that reached the Supreme
Court.
The attorneys in the case were
asked to include the evidence of
the second phase in their re
sponse to t he appeal. This would
have allowed psychiatric organi
zations to seek to enter the case
as amici. The attorneys decided
it would detract from what they
saw as an irrefutable violation of
the First Amendment. Hindsight
is clearer.
When the decision was re
leased, there was a flock of
congressional bills to correct the
assault by statute. Quite cor
rectly your story points out that
they would not change the con
stitutional damage. Most of the
bills, especially those of Sen.
Bayh and Congressman Kas
tenmeier, covered broad protec
tion for all non-criminal parties.
Once the media furor stopped,
things began to slow up on the
legislation.
In fact the administration,
supported by otherwise liberal

Senators Javits and Ribicoff,
submitted legislation labelled
"privacy protection," that actu
ally legislated authority to seize
medical information by sub
poena, search warrant and even
bureaucratic fiat. In some cases,
a judge could order that the hol
der of the information must not
warn the subject that the gov
ernment had seized the records
— material presently protected
by law. The San Francisco
Chronicle heralded this move as
protecting liberties, with no
mention of the elements of the
bills that violate rights guaran
teed by the Constitution.
Since the Daily decision, the
California Attorney General
used a search warrant in an at
torney's office in attacking a
political rival. The same District
Attorney of the Daily raid in
famy and the Stanford psychiat
ric clinic raid, used a search war
rant on the Public Defender's of
fice of the same county organiza
tion — under circumstances as
questionable as the first two
raids. The Daily reported these
with indications that other attor
neys' offices have been treated
the same.

ln San Francisco last February
a search warrant was used to
seize the records of the city and
county's methadone treatment
clinic.
Note that raids on clinics, doc
tors' offices and attorneys' of
fices are not directed at those
professionals. They are directed
at people like yourselves who
have private, constitutionally
protected information in those
offices.
What do you learn from his
tory about hazards you face that
were originally warded off by the
Bill of Rights? The press needs
the First Amendment to be able
to keep the public informed, and
thereby protected from their
own government. How well is
the press carrying out this obliga
tion that merits its own protec
tion?
I suspect a concerted drive in
this area by college and univer
sity publications will be more ef
fective than the general press
with its conflict of interest han
gups.
