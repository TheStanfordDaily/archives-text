## Candidates play the numbers game 
### 
As a youngster 1 encountered
adults who offered to mediate
disputes between some an
tagonist (usually my younger
brother) and myself by the
"select a number between one
and 10" technique. Most readers
probably share this memory; for
those who don't, the object of
the game is to select the number
nearest the one that the impartial
and benevolent adult is "think
ing of." I was most fond of this
method during the short period
when my slight advantage in age
and wisdom over my brother en
abled me to brutally exploit him.
He would select seven. I six; he
went for three, I decided on four.
Unfortunately, my brother

caught on rather quickly, and the
flow of cookies and other advan
tages stopped. In addition, a
third sibling entered the act,
making the whole setup a good
deal harder to manipulate.
A reasonably intelligent five
year old can master the princi
ples of this game, but when
played in a different format it
often confuses otherwise normal
adults. It's an election year. Car
ter's advisers, as bright as any
live year old, realize that
whomever the Republicans
nominate (they won't nominate
John Anderson) will be to the
right of Carter on most domestic
and foreign policy issues, and
they will reshape their candidate
accordingly.
Say the Republican nominee is
an eight on a I 0 point scale going
from radical to very conserva
tive, ora nine if it's Reagan. Car
ter will portray himself as a se
ven. Presumably, voters from
seven all the way down to one
will perceive him as the closest
alternative, and the Republican
nominee will find himself iso
lated with just the eights, nines
and 10s.
None of this is very startling,
and that's the point. Why all the
dumbfounded frustration
around election time when
people complain that there's re
ally very little difference bet
ween the candidates? That's the
way the system is structured, the
way the game is played. Or,
that's the way it's correctly
played.
Goldwater and McGovern
were landslide victims because
they refused, probably on prin
ciple, to play the game. Goldwa
ter, a 9'/ 2 , refused to don a seven
costume.
As an enthusiastic Christian, 1
imagine that our current presi
dent also has principles of some
kind. But he has an uncanny abil

ity to separate them from his
politics. Thus I feel safe in pre
dicting that if nominated (which
seems certain). Carter will adopt
a position very close to that of his
opponent on the right, confident
that he will pick up all the voters
on the left who can bring them
selves to vote.
As a result, our choices will be
(for example) between a 5 per
cent and a 10 percent real in
crease in defense spending, and
between very weak and virtually
non-existent programs to com
bat poverty and structural dis
crimination against minorities.
We will be offered no possibility
of an adequate national health
plan, public transportation, or an
energy conservation program.
True, we will be offered
choices; this is indeed a democ
ratic system. But these are not
very meaningful choices, and the
result is not very meaningful
democracy.
No individual or group can be
blamed for this situation, which
follows largely from the struc
ture of our two-party political
system. Thus one obvious solu
tion to the problem is a viable
third party. It is not only "radi
cals" and "liberals." but all
Americans, who would stand to
gain from such a change.
A whole range of possible sol
utions to present domestic and
international difficulties is sim
ply not being discussed in the na
tional debate. The Republicans
and Democrats would have us
believe that the reason for this
silence is that these possibilities
(say, nationalizing oil com
panies) are unreasonable or
"un-American." But the real
reason is simply that there is no
political organization to articu
late the sentiments of a badly
fragmented left.
We of the left must unite be
hind the banner of some third
party, to the left of the Democra

tic party establishment but prob
ably not far enough left to make
most radicals comfortable.
1 encourage radicals who can
not imagine a coalition with lib
erals to contemplate ho.v this in
trasigance has served them (and
those lor whom they presumably,
are concerned) in the past. At
the moment it is far more impor
tant that a viable third party exist
than that its goals fit this or that
radical's Utopian vision.
A national party somewhere
on the left would not have to be
very large in order to begin act
ing like a third sibling, changing
the emerging rule that the best
election-year strategy is to rush
to the center of the right.
Third party movements have
been proposed before, and in the
end they have always failed.
However, certain aspects of the
current social and political scene
give rise to the hope that such a
movement might not be doomed
today. For example, it would
take an impressionable mind to
be convinced that a Carter/Bush
contest is significant.
More fundamentally, there
must be a growing number of
Americans who are starting to
question the " more of the same"
solutions the present parties are
cranking out in a world political
and economic climate that seems
to deteriorate daily.
No matter where one classifies
oneselfon the political spectrum,
it would be hard not to agree that
all Americans would benefit
from a wider-ranging political
debate. Therefore 1 urge all
Stanford students and other
readers of this column to investi
gate, and seriously consider
working for, some third party
movement.

ter, a 9'/ 2 , refused to don a seven
costume.
As an enthusiastic Christian, 1
imagine that our current presi
dent also has principles of some
kind. But he has an uncanny abil

ity to separate them from his
politics. Thus I feel safe in pre
dicting that if nominated (which
seems certain). Carter will adopt
a position very close to that of his
opponent on the right, confident
that he will pick up all the voters
on the left who can bring them
selves to vote.
As a result, our choices will be
(for example) between a 5 per
cent and a 10 percent real in
crease in defense spending, and
between very weak and virtually
non-existent programs to com
bat poverty and structural dis
crimination against minorities.
We will be offered no possibility
of an adequate national health
plan, public transportation, or an
energy conservation program.
True, we will be offered
choices; this is indeed a democ
ratic system. But these are not
very meaningful choices, and the
result is not very meaningful
democracy.
No individual or group can be
blamed for this situation, which
follows largely from the struc
ture of our two-party political
system. Thus one obvious solu
tion to the problem is a viable
third party. It is not only "radi
cals" and "liberals." but all
Americans, who would stand to
gain from such a change.
A whole range of possible sol
utions to present domestic and
international difficulties is sim
ply not being discussed in the na
tional debate. The Republicans
and Democrats would have us
believe that the reason for this
silence is that these possibilities
(say, nationalizing oil com
panies) are unreasonable or
"un-American." But the real
reason is simply that there is no
political organization to articu
late the sentiments of a badly
fragmented left.
We of the left must unite be
hind the banner of some third
party, to the left of the Democra

tic party establishment but prob
ably not far enough left to make
most radicals comfortable.
1 encourage radicals who can
not imagine a coalition with lib
erals to contemplate ho.v this in
trasigance has served them (and
those lor whom they presumably,
are concerned) in the past. At
the moment it is far more impor
tant that a viable third party exist
than that its goals fit this or that
radical's Utopian vision.
A national party somewhere
on the left would not have to be
very large in order to begin act
ing like a third sibling, changing
the emerging rule that the best
election-year strategy is to rush
to the center of the right.
Third party movements have
been proposed before, and in the
end they have always failed.
However, certain aspects of the
current social and political scene
give rise to the hope that such a
movement might not be doomed
today. For example, it would
take an impressionable mind to
be convinced that a Carter/Bush
contest is significant.
More fundamentally, there
must be a growing number of
Americans who are starting to
question the " more of the same"
solutions the present parties are
cranking out in a world political
and economic climate that seems
to deteriorate daily.
No matter where one classifies
oneselfon the political spectrum,
it would be hard not to agree that
all Americans would benefit
from a wider-ranging political
debate. Therefore 1 urge all
Stanford students and other
readers of this column to investi
gate, and seriously consider
working for, some third party
movement.

As a youngster 1 encountered
adults who offered to mediate
disputes between some an
tagonist (usually my younger
brother) and myself by the
"select a number between one
and 10" technique. Most readers
probably share this memory; for
those who don't, the object of
the game is to select the number
nearest the one that the impartial
and benevolent adult is "think
ing of." I was most fond of this
method during the short period
when my slight advantage in age
and wisdom over my brother en
abled me to brutally exploit him.
He would select seven. I six; he
went for three, I decided on four.
Unfortunately, my brother

caught on rather quickly, and the
flow of cookies and other advan
tages stopped. In addition, a
third sibling entered the act,
making the whole setup a good
deal harder to manipulate.
A reasonably intelligent five
year old can master the princi
ples of this game, but when
played in a different format it
often confuses otherwise normal
adults. It's an election year. Car
ter's advisers, as bright as any
live year old, realize that
whomever the Republicans
nominate (they won't nominate
John Anderson) will be to the
right of Carter on most domestic
and foreign policy issues, and
they will reshape their candidate
accordingly.
Say the Republican nominee is
an eight on a I 0 point scale going
from radical to very conserva
tive, ora nine if it's Reagan. Car
ter will portray himself as a se
ven. Presumably, voters from
seven all the way down to one
will perceive him as the closest
alternative, and the Republican
nominee will find himself iso
lated with just the eights, nines
and 10s.
None of this is very startling,
and that's the point. Why all the
dumbfounded frustration
around election time when
people complain that there's re
ally very little difference bet
ween the candidates? That's the
way the system is structured, the
way the game is played. Or,
that's the way it's correctly
played.
