Time to sacrifice
Last week I had the misfor
tune to observe a shot of a scene
on your campus. This photo
graph showed a group of some of
your students burning a facsimile
of a draft card while others stood
around and cheered at the spec
tacle. Obviously this reaction
was based on President Jimmy
Carter's recommendation to re
quire all young males and
females to register for the draft.
This scene disturbed me.
These individuals, most of whom
have never experienced anything
but prosperity (as evidenced by
the bulging waistlines and/or
their sagging breasts swaying
to-n-fro), seem to have lost
touch with reality. They de
mand their freedoms without
any conception of the supreme
sacrifices others before them
have made that enable them to
live comfortably on this spot of
the planet.
I fear for my adopted country,
for it is these types of minds that
will take the reins and lead this
gifted country into the twenty
first century or perhaps into ob
livion. Minds that are more in
terested in the legal right to get
stoned, free contraceptives, and
the right to enjoy the fruits of
freedom that other young pat
riots have spilled their guts for,
while contributing nothing!
It my letter sounds objurgat
ory it's meant to be!
We damn the politicians be
cause they lie, cheat and steal but
we fail to realize that their be
havior can be generally traced
back (i.e., Ted Kennedy cheating
at Harvard, etc.) and today'.s
young reactionaries are the raw
materials of the future.

Our right to exist as a democ
racy will be seriously challenged
in the '80s. I hope that Ameri
cans have not lost their courage.

I would like to clarity a few
things concerning the article that
appeared in last Tuesday's Daily,
(DO sorority national allows
more autonomy). When I was
approached by the reporter I as
sumed the article to be a review
of all the sororities' positions at
this point. I was shocked when I
opened Tuesday's issue and was
confronted with the article that
appeared.
Delta Gamma has not even
met with Norm Robinson as of
yet to discuss our situation. The
article made it appear as if we
were ready to accept recognition
tomorrow.
In my opinion the article pre
sented a very unfair view of
Delta Gamma's stance on the
recognition issue.
If recognized, Delta Gamma
would accept it. However, this
acceptance would not be meant
as a slap in the face to the other
organizations on campus.
If recognized, Delta Gamma
would continue to meet at its
off-campus location and con
tinue to work with the other
sororities in an off-campus rush.
Under no circumstances does
Delta Gamma intend to abandon
the other organizations; it is our
hope and belief that a move by
one group would facilitate action
by the others. Recognized or not,
Delta Gamma will work with the

other sororities until all are rec
ognized.

Who pro-Kennedy?
We are writing in response to
Mark Agnew's Jan. 30 column,
"Carter must face failures."
Judging from the concluding
paragraph of his column, it must
be assumed that the writer's pur
pose was to promote the Ken
nedy for President campaign.
With this in mind, we wish to
raise an objection. This does not *
concern Senator Kennedy's ac
ceptability as our next president,
but rather the technique
employed to convince the reader „
of this fact.
While Agnew offers us many i
possible reasons for not re-elect
ing Carter — some of which are '
rather dubious — he fails to pro- ♦*
vide us with one single reason to »
vote for Kennedy. Heralding
Kennedy as "a clear voice on
where the present administra
tion has failed" does little to im
press us. Destructive criticism
serves little purpose, and the use
of it does not prove Kennedy's .»
worthiness to hold office. »
We feel that the election "by ,*
default" of any candidate would "•
be distressing and do little to
strengthen America. Strong
candidates tell us why they are fit
to be elected, not why their op
ponents are unfit.
