# 'Wonder drug' Valium scrutinized
## 
### B.D. Colen The Washington Post 
NUTLEY, N.J. — Even out
side the heavy double doors, the
roar is deafening as the tiny yel
low tablets of tranquility rush
down stainless steel spouts into
large cardboard cartons below.
Three of the four tablet
stamping machines are operat
ing, spitting out 400 pills a sec
ond, 24,000 a minute, 1,440,000
an hour, not shutting down for
more than 15 hours when they
have produced two lots — 30
million tablets —or enough Val
ium to supply America for only
about five days.
Valium is the most frequently
prescribed drug in the United
States and the world, used by
more persons than penicillin.
Valium has become such a
widely accepted part of the
American culture that it is joked
about in the comic strips and a
one-liner about it in the recent
movie Starting Over regularly
brings down the house.
What Valium does
If Valium is used properly —
and that term is interpreted in
many different ways — it indeed
is a wonder drug.
It is a muscle relaxant. It is a
treatment for alcohol with
drawal. It helps control seizures.
It helps control anxiety. It can be
wsed as a daytime sedative and a
nighttime sleeping pill.
It comes perhaps as close as
any drug can to being all things to
all people. And that may be its
biggest problem.
Its critics contend that because
Valium is viewed as being so
safe, it is treated much too casu
ally by physicians.
Many doctors prescribe Val
ium, particularly for female pa
tients who constitute two-thirds
of the drug's users, rather than
listen to a patient's problems and
provide counseling. It is some
times far easier in a busy office to
dash off a prescription than it is
to take 45 minutes for a patient
with vague complaints.
And perhaps because many
physicians prescribe it so casu
ally, the drug is often passed
around among family members
and friends, many of whom
never get a prescription for Val
ium and never have a doctor
aware that they are taking it.
Surveys show that most
Americans distrust tranquilizers
and that in 60 percent of the
cases, Valium is prescribed for
persons who need it for a purely
medical benefit, such as muscle
relaxation, or for physical prob
lems associated with anxiety.
Yet there are people who mis
use and abuse Valium.
30 percent misused
- There are no hard numbers to
show how many, although esti
mates or misuse run as high as 30
percent of those who take it. Pre

scription data suggest that Val
ium is taken by about 20 million
Americans, and even if only I
percent of them are abusers,
that's still 200,000 Americans
with a Valium problem.
According to the federal Drug
Alert Warning Network, in a
one-year period between 1976
and 1977, 54,400 people sought
emergency room treatment for
problems caused by taking too
much Valium — compared with
only 17,600 persons who had
taken too much aspirin, and
21,500 heroin, methadone or
morphine abusers.
Officials of Hoffmann-
Laßoche, the giant Swiss-based
firm that manufactures the drug
at its sprawling complex here,
argue that the drug is safe, non
addictive and cannot kill, unless
mixed with alcohol or other
drugs.
All that is true if the drug is
taken for short periods of time.
But studies have shown that a
person who takes two or three
times the recommended daily
dose of Valium may become
hooked on it.
Withdrawal symptoms
Some argue that the symptoms
of Valium withdrawal, such as ir
ritability, nervousness and in
somnia, simply mark the reap
pearance of the problems for
which the drug was taken. But
taken in large doses for long
periods of time, Valium can
cause withdrawal reactions simi
lar to those experienced with he
roin or alcohol, including life
threatening seizures.
For most persons, however,
Valium is a kind of psychic aspi
rin, taken occasionally to ease
them over life's rough spots.
How people view their use of the
drug seems to depend on their
views of drugs generally. These
persons include:
— The professional woman
who says she takes Valium "ab
out once a month. If you break
up with a boyfriend, for instance,
it's required. It's like oxygen."
— A woman who went to a
doctor for the first time, comp
laining of severe headaches that
aspirin didn't help. She was given
a cursory examination, then
asked if she was unhappy or hav
ing problems. "I said. 'No, as a
matter of fact, things are going
really well now.' "
The doctor then took out his
pad, wrote something down and
handed the prescription to the
woman, telling her to "try th
ese."
"These" were 5-milligram
Valium tablets. "When I saw
what it was," said the woman, "I
threw away the prescription."
— The woman who can't re
member why her gynecologist
first prescribed Valium, but
eventually built up a 40-
milligram-a-day habit, fed by

prescriptions from three doctors
she visited every three weeks.
Finally her druggist ref used to fill
them.
'Virtually never kills'
She tried to kill herself by tak
ing five times the maximum daily
dose and discovered one of the
medical profession's great open
secrets: Valium virtually never
kills, unless it's mixed with al
cohol or other drugs. She
"walked into walls," however,
one day when she mixed a
Sinutab with a Valium.
— A waiter who became
"psychologically" addicted to
Valium by taking a single
5-milligram tablet each night to
go to sleep." I cut it hack to a half
(tablet) myself," he said, "and I
sleep just as well. But I can't
sleep without it." He has been
taking the drug for four years
now, one a night. For 60 days, he
alternated the Valium with a
placebo — a sugar pill — without
knowing which was which. He
slept just as well.
— A heroin addict called a
Washington, D.C. radio talk
show on Valium and said the
tranquilizer is "like a drug ad
dict's delight. It's a dollar a piece
(on the street) for the blue (10
milligram) ones and 50 cents for
the yellows (5 milligrams).
"It it's fresh, one's enough to
relax you," he told the talk
show's guest host, Dr. Robert

Dupont, former director of the
National Institute of Drug
Abuse. "It's a relaxing drug and
people do need things to make
them relax. What I really crave is
heroin, but that's illegal."
"I had been given Valium
about 10 years ago by my inter
nist," a woman caller told Dup
ont, "and I take it when I need
it."
— Said another caller, "I feel
very guilty when 1 have to help
myself with this pill."
When is it needed?
The last two users best raise
the major questions asked about
Valium specifically and tran
quilizers generally: when does a
person truly need a drug to con
trol anxiety, and how does soci
ety view such drug use?
According to Dr. Dorothy
Starr, a psychiatrist in private
practice and president-elect of
the Medical Society of the Dis
trict of Columbia, "The only
trouble with the ben
zodiazepines (the chemical fam
ily that includes Valium) is they
work too well.
"Anxiety is a normal condi
tion of living," she said. "People
should learn to deal with anxiety
and learn to avoid anxiety, rather
than always blot it out. But cer
tainly, there are lots of times
when there is no point in allow
ing a person to be in pain, and
anxiety, for no reason, is pain
ful."
