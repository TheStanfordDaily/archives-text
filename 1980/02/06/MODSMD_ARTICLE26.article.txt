# Post Office pushing dollar coins

### MIKE CAUSEY The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Americans, who gave
lukewarm welcome to the Susan B. Anthony coin
when it came out. are quietly being force-fed
250,000 of the quarter-sized dollars daily. Instru
ment of the diffusion, which started last Friday, is
the nation's largest chain-store, the U.S. Postal
Service.
If you walk into any of the 35,000 post offices
nowadays and use a big bill to pay for stamps, odds
are your change will come back in S1 coins honor
ing the famous suffragette. It was the Treasury
Department's idea. Treasury has cranked out
about 800 million of the coins — and demand for
them has been, to be charitable, not so great.

"They are moving like green weenies," said one
Treasury aide when asked to comment on the
popularity or lack of some of the coins. Another
said the coins got such "bad press" that "people
who have never seen or used them are making
judgments based on the media." which has tended
to poke tun at the dollars, and highlight gripes from
people, and merchants, who don't like them.
To get more of the coins in circulation, the
Treasury Department asked the U.S. Postal Ser
vice (USPS) to help out. USPS has about 55,000
"windows" that dispense stamps and services, and
ideally, it should be able to make change daily that
would put 250,000 ot the coins into the hands of
people who would — if they take them — presum
ably pass them on.
