# SAC sponsors non-violent protest training
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
Twelve students gathered in
the living room at Terra House
last Sunday morning for a six
hour class in non-violent protest
techniques. Don't bother look
ing it up in Courses and Degrees;
it is not there. The class was
another effort by Stanford
Against Conscription (SAC), the
fast-growing campus anti-draft
group, to prepare the way for re
sistance — peaceful resistance —
against the registration for the
military draft.
All together 43 students — di
vided into three groups including
the one at Terra House and
another group entirely for
women at the Women's Center
— were trained in all aspects of
non-violent protest. These
ranged from strategy and tactics
at peaceful demonstrations, to
how to get consensus among a
large number of people for group
decision making. It also included
a detailed explanation of the
court process and what it is like
to be arrested and jailed.
Such things are a novelty for

most Stanford students, but not
for the two instructors of the
course. Both Steven Mentor, a
teacher at De Anza college and
former graduate student here,
and senior Lisa Catanzarite,
have been arrested and jailed
twice before.
They were first arrested in
May 1977 while protesting Stan
ford's investments in South Af
rica. They were arrested again
while protesting the re-opening
of Rancho Seco after the Three
Mile Island incident on July 3,
1979.
"We see non-violent protest
as an active means of protest that

keeps the means in line with the
ends," Catanzarite explained.
"If the end that you're trying for
is non-violent, peaceful, you
can't use a violent means to
achieve it."
Among the techniques used to
teach the course were extensive
role-playing and acting out of
real-life situations.
In one exercise, for example,
the group was told that a heckler
arrived at their demonstration
and began chanting "Nuke the
Ayatullah!" over the mic
rophones.
The 12 broke into smaller
groups to discuss the issue and

then sent spokespeople from
each group to discuss what to do.
They decided the best thing to
do would be to get together and
form a silent cordon around the
miscreant to isolate the person
and express their disapproval.
Anything more than that, they
decided, would he a denial of the
person's right to free speech.
Such decisions were typical of
the non-violent tactics learned
by the group.
Television and the mass
media weigh heavily in any kind
of mass demonstration, and that
fact was clearly reflected in the
discussion.

"If you're given a 15-second
news slot," said one woman,
"you have to keep it pretty sim
ple. The less you say the less
there is to mess up."
"Ask the reporters questions
back." suggested Catanzarite.
"They're usually so busy think
ing up the next question that they
aren't even listening to you."
More such training sessions
are planned for the future. As for
whether any of the techniques
learned here will ever be used, it
is impossible to say. Only Men
tor seemed certain.
"I'll be in jail again. I'm sure?"
he said.
