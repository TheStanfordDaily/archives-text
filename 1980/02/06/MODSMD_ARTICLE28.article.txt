# Engineer, pediatrician design transport incubator
## 
### Janet Stephens Staff Writer 
' "The most important role of
an engineer is to solve problems
"r— to make things happen," said
Prof. Robert Moffat, chairman
of the Thermosciences Depart
ment in the School of Engineer
ing here.
"At various times for each in
dividual. some problems look
more important to him than
others," he said.
Luckily for some 15,000 chil
dren. when Assoc. Prof. Alvin
Hackel ol the Department of
Pediatrics and Anesthesia in the
Medical Center presented him
with the problem of transporting
newborn babies, Moffat saw it as
very important.

Seven years ago Hackel de
cided that there must he a better
way to transport newborn babies
with urgent medical needs to ap
propriate specialist hospitals.
Existing devices hadn't been
able to maintain sufficient heat
in severe conditions or allow for
direct immediate care.
l ive years later, a joint effort
between Moffat and Hackel
[produced the Stanford Trans
port Incubator.
Moffatt estimated that bet
ween 1 500 and 2000 units are in
use throughout the United States
and the rest of the world. Over
15.000 babies have now been
transported in the Stanford unit.
The current manufactured
model, besides the incubatorand
power pack, contains all the
necessary life support and
monitoring equipment which

Hackel, as an infant care
specialist, requested. "It's now
become essentially a mobile in
tensive care unit," noted I lackel.
The power pack allows tor up
to live hours of operation in
room temperature without being
recharged. Hut the real
"mindblower," explained Mof
lat, is its successful two-hour op
eration in sub-zero temperatures
which often exist outside of
sunny California. He said the un
it's success in this area has
changed federal standards.
Haekel, a pediatric anes
thesiologist concerned with in
fant transport, had originally rig
ged up an electrically heated crib
warmer on a cart for within
hospital trips. He used an exten
sion cord and later added motor
cycle batteries.
Further development of the
incubator began when Moffat
brought a group of graduate stu
dents in engineering to the hospi
tal in search of a summer project.
"I told them I had a couple of
ideas," Hackel recalls.
The "ideas" soon captivated
Moffat himself, who saw the
problem from an engineering
viewpoint.
"Hackel showed me this crib,"
he remarked, "and he said, 'You
know, we really need something
that will do this function but on
longer transports — do you think
we could put something to
gether?" It was pretty clear to me
that we could."
Ideally, Hackel had wanted a
unit that wouldn't hamper caring
for the infant in order to main
tain heat, as did bubbles and
domes. "Our criteria was that it
would have to provide open in
tensive care, be light enough that
we could lift it in and out of am
bulances, and it would have to
provide at least two hours of bat
tery power in a hostile environ
ment."
Moffat, a thermosciences
specialist, described the con
tinual spare-time effort as a "typ
ical engineering process."
"We built what we thought
was a good idea, and then we
would test it in the laboratory
and fix what didn't work," he
said. "Hackel would then test it
in the hospital for a while, and
when it looked safe and reasona
ble he would try it out on trans
port with a baby."

They proceeded through sev
eral prototypes built in their own
labs with the help of technicians
Robin Burch and Lloyd Gano.
They were finally satisfied with
the sixth model, which success
fully incorporated a sliding cover
which could maintain heat and
allow for open care.
They licensed the final model
two years ago with the Univer
sity. The C'avatron Company
then made a manufacturing ag
reement. Cavatron is now paying
royalties for the right to man
ufacture the Stanford Transport
Incubator with the added life
support system built to Hackel's
specifications.
Before that point, however,
the time and money spent on the
project was volunteered. "We
did it evenings; we did it
weekends," said Moffat, "Even

the technicians that worked with
us, Robin Burch in our shop and
Lloyd Gano in the hospital, do
nated their time. We built the
whole first live modifications es
sentially with pocket money."
Despite the establishment of
biomedical engineering
elsewhere, the two colleagues
enjoyed the lack of formality in
working on the project. "It's ac
tually been a lot of fun to do it on
our own time and just pick each
other's brains and see what we
come up with," said Hackel.
The final success of the life
saving transport incubator was
possible only because of constant
enthusiasm, according to Moffat.
He called its construction a sort
of high-technology hobby, a br
inging together of ideas beyond
the drawing board.
"An engineer's first response

if you present him a problem is to
think of a solution," he said.
Motivation and enthusiasm are
needed to turn the problem into
"real hardware."
Hackel provided both,
claimed Moffat. "He's on the
phone all the time, with 'Hey!
Have you done this yet? When
does this thing work?' "
He described the doctor as a
"relentless conscience. It's his
responsibility to keep babies
alive," Moffat said.
The essence of engineering is
finding solutions for problems.
Moffat emphasized that in addi
tion to acquiring skills, an en
gineer must start with the insight
to locate the problem, to foresee
the result and to stick to it.
This need for intuition and in
sight is what Moffat tries to con
vey in his undergraduate and

graduate courses in heat transfer
and experimental methods.
"I think the intuition and in
sight give you the sudden flash —
you know what the problem is,
you know what should be done.
All the engineering education
just makes it possible to under
stand the problem and to execute
the solution," Moffat said.
He said an engineer's educa
tion is like that of a sculptor's
muscle — it's the ability to carry
through what the eye must first
imagine within the stone.
Moffat's teaching career
began in 1967 after completing
10 years of heat transfer research
at General Motors and five years
of study at Stanford to receive his
Ph.D.
"When I was offered the
chance to join the faculty here it
was too good a chance to pass
up," he said. He said he feels
lucky to do what he was trained
for. to be able to write about it, to
teach it and to work with people.
About halt his time as a
teacher is spent on his experi
mental methods development.
"I'm trying to develop
techniques for teaching people
to do experiments, not just the
unit operations of measuring
things, but how to take their in
sight that an experiment ought to
be done and to plan one that will
get the whole answer as quickly
as possible," he said.
Moffat's involvement in teach
ing has cut down on his chance
for his own research in heat
transfer, but he is always talking
with others about it, teaching il
and even "thinking about it in
the shower."
For a long time, Hackel's
constant occupation has been
caring for small infants.
He has worked at the Medical
Center here since 1969 w here he
created the area of Pediatric
Anesthesiology. He also teaches
medical and resident students.
A former undergraduate and
medical student here, Hackel
said he enjoys applying what he
has learned in one field to the
other (pediatrics and anes
thesiology), but especially apply
ing them both to the field of in
fant transport.
"The problem of the transport
unit was just one part of a larger
problem of getting patients from
one hospital to another," he said.

He has played an active role in
the development of the Infant
Medical Dispatch Center here
which serves Northern Califor
nia. The center determines the
nearest available of the 10
specialized hospitals and ar
ranges for transport to it with
specialized teams using the
transport incubator. L.ast year
the center received over 2000
such requests, and Stanford
alone served over 500.
Hackcl said he hopes to
branch out this system to serve
other areas of medicine and is
working out a more efficient
computerized system.
He has gone beyond the
School of Engineering in seeking
resources m the University. "'1
have a project going now with a
grad student in the business
school studying the concept ot
regionalization of newborn care
how effective it is. and search
ing for information for the loca
tion of a new center," Hackel re
ported.

He still maintains ties with
Moftat, however, and said he
hopes he and the engineer will
find time tor their "hobby."
1 lackel has expressed the need
tor a device which will monitor
the airflow characteristics of
small infants. "1 think that it will
probably be our next challenge,"
predicted a busy but interested
Moffat.
For this doctor who accepts
the challenge of keeping babies
alive, and for this engineer who
pursues solutions to problems,
the idea will probably go beyond
that state.

domes. "Our criteria was that it
would have to provide open in
tensive care, be light enough that
we could lift it in and out of am
bulances, and it would have to
provide at least two hours of bat
tery power in a hostile environ
ment."
Moffat, a thermosciences
specialist, described the con
tinual spare-time effort as a "typ
ical engineering process."
"We built what we thought
was a good idea, and then we
would test it in the laboratory
and fix what didn't work," he
said. "Hackel would then test it
in the hospital for a while, and
when it looked safe and reasona
ble he would try it out on trans
port with a baby."

They proceeded through sev
eral prototypes built in their own
labs with the help of technicians
Robin Burch and Lloyd Gano.
They were finally satisfied with
the sixth model, which success
fully incorporated a sliding cover
which could maintain heat and
allow for open care.
They licensed the final model
two years ago with the Univer
sity. The C'avatron Company
then made a manufacturing ag
reement. Cavatron is now paying
royalties for the right to man
ufacture the Stanford Transport
Incubator with the added life
support system built to Hackel's
specifications.
Before that point, however,
the time and money spent on the
project was volunteered. "We
did it evenings; we did it
weekends," said Moffat, "Even

the technicians that worked with
us, Robin Burch in our shop and
Lloyd Gano in the hospital, do
nated their time. We built the
whole first live modifications es
sentially with pocket money."
Despite the establishment of
biomedical engineering
elsewhere, the two colleagues
enjoyed the lack of formality in
working on the project. "It's ac
tually been a lot of fun to do it on
our own time and just pick each
other's brains and see what we
come up with," said Hackel.
The final success of the life
saving transport incubator was
possible only because of constant
enthusiasm, according to Moffat.
He called its construction a sort
of high-technology hobby, a br
inging together of ideas beyond
the drawing board.
"An engineer's first response

if you present him a problem is to
think of a solution," he said.
Motivation and enthusiasm are
needed to turn the problem into
"real hardware."
Hackel provided both,
claimed Moffat. "He's on the
phone all the time, with 'Hey!
Have you done this yet? When
does this thing work?' "
He described the doctor as a
"relentless conscience. It's his
responsibility to keep babies
alive," Moffat said.
The essence of engineering is
finding solutions for problems.
Moffat emphasized that in addi
tion to acquiring skills, an en
gineer must start with the insight
to locate the problem, to foresee
the result and to stick to it.
This need for intuition and in
sight is what Moffat tries to con
vey in his undergraduate and

graduate courses in heat transfer
and experimental methods.
"I think the intuition and in
sight give you the sudden flash —
you know what the problem is,
you know what should be done.
All the engineering education
just makes it possible to under
stand the problem and to execute
the solution," Moffat said.
He said an engineer's educa
tion is like that of a sculptor's
muscle — it's the ability to carry
through what the eye must first
imagine within the stone.
Moffat's teaching career
began in 1967 after completing
10 years of heat transfer research
at General Motors and five years
of study at Stanford to receive his
Ph.D.
"When I was offered the
chance to join the faculty here it
was too good a chance to pass
up," he said. He said he feels
lucky to do what he was trained
for. to be able to write about it, to
teach it and to work with people.
About halt his time as a
teacher is spent on his experi
mental methods development.
"I'm trying to develop
techniques for teaching people
to do experiments, not just the
unit operations of measuring
things, but how to take their in
sight that an experiment ought to
be done and to plan one that will
get the whole answer as quickly
as possible," he said.
Moffat's involvement in teach
ing has cut down on his chance
for his own research in heat
transfer, but he is always talking
with others about it, teaching il
and even "thinking about it in
the shower."
For a long time, Hackel's
constant occupation has been
caring for small infants.
He has worked at the Medical
Center here since 1969 w here he
created the area of Pediatric
Anesthesiology. He also teaches
medical and resident students.
A former undergraduate and
medical student here, Hackel
said he enjoys applying what he
has learned in one field to the
other (pediatrics and anes
thesiology), but especially apply
ing them both to the field of in
fant transport.
"The problem of the transport
unit was just one part of a larger
problem of getting patients from
one hospital to another," he said.

He has played an active role in
the development of the Infant
Medical Dispatch Center here
which serves Northern Califor
nia. The center determines the
nearest available of the 10
specialized hospitals and ar
ranges for transport to it with
specialized teams using the
transport incubator. L.ast year
the center received over 2000
such requests, and Stanford
alone served over 500.
Hackcl said he hopes to
branch out this system to serve
other areas of medicine and is
working out a more efficient
computerized system.
He has gone beyond the
School of Engineering in seeking
resources m the University. "'1
have a project going now with a
grad student in the business
school studying the concept ot
regionalization of newborn care
how effective it is. and search
ing for information for the loca
tion of a new center," Hackel re
ported.

He still maintains ties with
Moftat, however, and said he
hopes he and the engineer will
find time tor their "hobby."
1 lackel has expressed the need
tor a device which will monitor
the airflow characteristics of
small infants. "1 think that it will
probably be our next challenge,"
predicted a busy but interested
Moffat.
For this doctor who accepts
the challenge of keeping babies
alive, and for this engineer who
pursues solutions to problems,
the idea will probably go beyond
that state.

' "The most important role of
an engineer is to solve problems
"r— to make things happen," said
Prof. Robert Moffat, chairman
of the Thermosciences Depart
ment in the School of Engineer
ing here.
"At various times for each in
dividual. some problems look
more important to him than
others," he said.
Luckily for some 15,000 chil
dren. when Assoc. Prof. Alvin
Hackel ol the Department of
Pediatrics and Anesthesia in the
Medical Center presented him
with the problem of transporting
newborn babies, Moffat saw it as
very important.

Seven years ago Hackel de
cided that there must he a better
way to transport newborn babies
with urgent medical needs to ap
propriate specialist hospitals.
Existing devices hadn't been
able to maintain sufficient heat
in severe conditions or allow for
direct immediate care.
l ive years later, a joint effort
between Moffat and Hackel
[produced the Stanford Trans
port Incubator.
Moffatt estimated that bet
ween 1 500 and 2000 units are in
use throughout the United States
and the rest of the world. Over
15.000 babies have now been
transported in the Stanford unit.
The current manufactured
model, besides the incubatorand
power pack, contains all the
necessary life support and
monitoring equipment which

Hackel, as an infant care
specialist, requested. "It's now
become essentially a mobile in
tensive care unit," noted I lackel.
The power pack allows tor up
to live hours of operation in
room temperature without being
recharged. Hut the real
"mindblower," explained Mof
lat, is its successful two-hour op
eration in sub-zero temperatures
which often exist outside of
sunny California. He said the un
it's success in this area has
changed federal standards.
Haekel, a pediatric anes
thesiologist concerned with in
fant transport, had originally rig
ged up an electrically heated crib
warmer on a cart for within
hospital trips. He used an exten
sion cord and later added motor
cycle batteries.
Further development of the
incubator began when Moffat
brought a group of graduate stu
dents in engineering to the hospi
tal in search of a summer project.
"I told them I had a couple of
ideas," Hackel recalls.
The "ideas" soon captivated
Moffat himself, who saw the
problem from an engineering
viewpoint.
"Hackel showed me this crib,"
he remarked, "and he said, 'You
know, we really need something
that will do this function but on
longer transports — do you think
we could put something to
gether?" It was pretty clear to me
that we could."
Ideally, Hackel had wanted a
unit that wouldn't hamper caring
for the infant in order to main
tain heat, as did bubbles and
domes. "Our criteria was that it
would have to provide open in
tensive care, be light enough that
we could lift it in and out of am
bulances, and it would have to
provide at least two hours of bat

to locate the problem, to foresee
the result and to stick to it.
This need for intuition and in
sight is what Moffat tries to con
vey in his undergraduate and

graduate courses in heat transfer
and experimental methods.
"I think the intuition and in
sight give you the sudden flash —
you know what the problem is,
you know what should be done.
All the engineering education
just makes it possible to under
stand the problem and to execute
the solution," Moffat said.
He said an engineer's educa
tion is like that of a sculptor's
muscle — it's the ability to carry
through what the eye must first
imagine within the stone.
Moffat's teaching career
began in 1967 after completing
10 years of heat transfer research
at General Motors and five years
of study at Stanford to receive his
Ph.D.
"When I was offered the
chance to join the faculty here it
was too good a chance to pass
up," he said. He said he feels
lucky to do what he was trained
for. to be able to write about it, to
teach it and to work with people.
About halt his time as a
teacher is spent on his experi
mental methods development.
"I'm trying to develop
techniques for teaching people
to do experiments, not just the
unit operations of measuring
things, but how to take their in
sight that an experiment ought to
be done and to plan one that will
get the whole answer as quickly
as possible," he said.
Moffat's involvement in teach
ing has cut down on his chance
for his own research in heat
transfer, but he is always talking
with others about it, teaching il
and even "thinking about it in
the shower."
For a long time, Hackel's
constant occupation has been
caring for small infants.
He has worked at the Medical
Center here since 1969 w here he
created the area of Pediatric
Anesthesiology. He also teaches
medical and resident students.
A former undergraduate and
medical student here, Hackel
said he enjoys applying what he
has learned in one field to the
other (pediatrics and anes
thesiology), but especially apply
ing them both to the field of in
fant transport.
"The problem of the transport
unit was just one part of a larger
problem of getting patients from
one hospital to another," he said.

He has played an active role in
the development of the Infant
Medical Dispatch Center here
which serves Northern Califor
nia. The center determines the
nearest available of the 10
specialized hospitals and ar
ranges for transport to it with
specialized teams using the
transport incubator. L.ast year
the center received over 2000
such requests, and Stanford
alone served over 500.
Hackcl said he hopes to
branch out this system to serve
other areas of medicine and is
working out a more efficient
computerized system.
He has gone beyond the
School of Engineering in seeking
resources m the University. "'1
have a project going now with a
grad student in the business
school studying the concept ot
regionalization of newborn care
how effective it is. and search
ing for information for the loca
tion of a new center," Hackel re
ported.

He still maintains ties with
Moftat, however, and said he
hopes he and the engineer will
find time tor their "hobby."
1 lackel has expressed the need
tor a device which will monitor
the airflow characteristics of
small infants. "1 think that it will
probably be our next challenge,"
predicted a busy but interested
Moffat.
For this doctor who accepts
the challenge of keeping babies
alive, and for this engineer who
pursues solutions to problems,
the idea will probably go beyond
that state.

' "The most important role of
an engineer is to solve problems
"r— to make things happen," said
Prof. Robert Moffat, chairman
of the Thermosciences Depart
ment in the School of Engineer
ing here.
"At various times for each in
dividual. some problems look
more important to him than
others," he said.
Luckily for some 15,000 chil
dren. when Assoc. Prof. Alvin
Hackel ol the Department of
Pediatrics and Anesthesia in the
Medical Center presented him
with the problem of transporting
newborn babies, Moffat saw it as
very important.

Seven years ago Hackel de
cided that there must he a better
way to transport newborn babies
with urgent medical needs to ap
propriate specialist hospitals.
Existing devices hadn't been
able to maintain sufficient heat
in severe conditions or allow for
direct immediate care.
l ive years later, a joint effort
between Moffat and Hackel
[produced the Stanford Trans
port Incubator.
Moffatt estimated that bet
ween 1 500 and 2000 units are in
use throughout the United States
and the rest of the world. Over
15.000 babies have now been
transported in the Stanford unit.
The current manufactured
model, besides the incubatorand
power pack, contains all the
necessary life support and
monitoring equipment which

Hackel, as an infant care
specialist, requested. "It's now
become essentially a mobile in
tensive care unit," noted I lackel.
The power pack allows tor up
to live hours of operation in
room temperature without being
recharged. Hut the real
"mindblower," explained Mof
lat, is its successful two-hour op
eration in sub-zero temperatures
which often exist outside of
sunny California. He said the un
it's success in this area has
changed federal standards.
Haekel, a pediatric anes
thesiologist concerned with in
fant transport, had originally rig
ged up an electrically heated crib
warmer on a cart for within
hospital trips. He used an exten
sion cord and later added motor
cycle batteries.
Further development of the
incubator began when Moffat
brought a group of graduate stu
dents in engineering to the hospi
tal in search of a summer project.
"I told them I had a couple of
ideas," Hackel recalls.
The "ideas" soon captivated
Moffat himself, who saw the
problem from an engineering
viewpoint.
"Hackel showed me this crib,"
he remarked, "and he said, 'You
know, we really need something
that will do this function but on
longer transports — do you think
we could put something to
gether?" It was pretty clear to me
that we could."
Ideally, Hackel had wanted a
unit that wouldn't hamper caring
for the infant in order to main
tain heat, as did bubbles and
domes. "Our criteria was that it
would have to provide open in
tensive care, be light enough that
we could lift it in and out of am
bulances, and it would have to
provide at least two hours of bat
tery power in a hostile environ
ment."
Moffat, a thermosciences
specialist, described the con
tinual spare-time effort as a "typ
ical engineering process."
"We built what we thought
was a good idea, and then we
would test it in the laboratory
and fix what didn't work," he
said. "Hackel would then test it
in the hospital for a while, and
when it looked safe and reasona
ble he would try it out on trans
port with a baby."

They proceeded through sev
eral prototypes built in their own
labs with the help of technicians
Robin Burch and Lloyd Gano.
They were finally satisfied with
the sixth model, which success
fully incorporated a sliding cover
which could maintain heat and
allow for open care.
They licensed the final model
two years ago with the Univer
sity. The C'avatron Company
then made a manufacturing ag
reement. Cavatron is now paying
royalties for the right to man
ufacture the Stanford Transport
Incubator with the added life
support system built to Hackel's
specifications.
Before that point, however,
the time and money spent on the
project was volunteered. "We
did it evenings; we did it
weekends," said Moffat, "Even

the technicians that worked with
us, Robin Burch in our shop and
Lloyd Gano in the hospital, do
nated their time. We built the
whole first live modifications es
sentially with pocket money."
Despite the establishment of
biomedical engineering
elsewhere, the two colleagues
enjoyed the lack of formality in
working on the project. "It's ac
tually been a lot of fun to do it on
our own time and just pick each
other's brains and see what we
come up with," said Hackel.
The final success of the life
saving transport incubator was
possible only because of constant
enthusiasm, according to Moffat.
He called its construction a sort
of high-technology hobby, a br
inging together of ideas beyond
the drawing board.
"An engineer's first response

if you present him a problem is to
think of a solution," he said.
Motivation and enthusiasm are
needed to turn the problem into
"real hardware."
Hackel provided both,
claimed Moffat. "He's on the
phone all the time, with 'Hey!
Have you done this yet? When
does this thing work?' "
He described the doctor as a
"relentless conscience. It's his
responsibility to keep babies
alive," Moffat said.
The essence of engineering is
finding solutions for problems.
Moffat emphasized that in addi
tion to acquiring skills, an en
gineer must start with the insight
to locate the problem, to foresee
the result and to stick to it.
This need for intuition and in
sight is what Moffat tries to con
vey in his undergraduate and
