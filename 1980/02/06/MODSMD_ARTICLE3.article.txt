# Professors assess Soviet-American crisis
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
U.S. overreaction to the Soviet-
American crisis involving Afghanistan
will have "far more consequences than
the Cuban missile crisis" on American
foreign policy when viewed with the
perspective of history, claims visiting
Prof. Michael Brecher.
Brecher made this assessment last
night during a panel discussion in
Toyon lounge. Prof. Alexander Dallin
of the history and political science de
partments also offered his views on the
current situation between the two
superpowers. Prof. Alexander George,
also of the political science depart
ment, acted as moderator.
The Afghanistan crisis has spurred

the "revival of the Cold Warrior men
tality" in the United States, Brecher
said.
In addition, it has signaled the "end
of the Vietnam War complex," the
much-discussed notion that America
had lost its nerve to play an active
military role in world affairs, he said.
"The ease with which the mood ot
the nation swings from total trust to
total mistrust" of the Soviet Unio l <.
alarming, Brecher said.
"The transformation in the public
mood toone that wills overt conflict" in
the world may, he said, "lead to a
strengthening of the military-industrial
complex."
Brecher said he believes Soviet in
tervention in Afghanistan has been

"taken out of all proportion."
Dallin agreed, adding "It is essential
tor the United States to react" to the
Soviet moves in the Middle East. How
ever, it is equally essential not to over
react.
"It (the Soviet Union) did not see its
actions in Afghanistan as a showdown"
between the two superpowers, Dallin
said.
Us action was "not part of some
grand design" to cut off oil supplies to
the West or to gain a warm water port,
he said. Soviet military intervention in
the affairs of Afghanistan was a "way
to break the encirclement" of the
Soviet Union by the four other major
world forces: China, Japan. Western
Europe and the United States, Dallin
said.
It also was a reaction to the political
instability of a Soviet clicnt state, he
said.
But Moscow miscalculated the cost
of its move into Afghanistan, Dallin
said. He said that the Soviets probably
thought the United States had written
off Afghanistan. It was "a low risk op
eration" in the minds of the Soviets,
Dallin said.
Brecher expanded on this theme,
stating that there was an "astonishing
imbalance in the nature of U.S. reac
tion to Soviet moves in Afghanistan."
He cited the lack of a firm American
response to initial Soviet meddling with
Afghanistan's government in 1978 as
evidence the Soviets "believed that

they would not encounter such a strong
U.S. reaction" in their latest moves.
Brecher termed American reaction
to Soviet movement into Afghanistan
as excessive and said that it was a sharp
contrast to the measured reaction
which followed the hostage crisis in
Iran. The "cumulative frustration" of
simultaneous crises was the reason for
this sharp swing in sentiment, he said.
Commenting that "every crisis offers
opportunities," George said that the
Afghanistan crisis is "forcing us to
learn certain lessons . . . that we must
develop a more sophisticated foreign
policy" to handle the various needs of
U.S. interests in different parts of the
world.
The United States must learn that
"deterrence is an instrument of foreign
policy and not a substitute tor it."he
said.
While "detente is now in a deep
freeze," George said that "both super
powers will come to their senses" and
"the time will come . . . when the two
sides will talk cold turkey about how to
handle their relationship."
"The United States is absolutely in
capable of preventing the Soviets from
moving into Iran," Dallinsaid. Brecher
and George both agreed.
In light of this, Brecher said that
President Jimmy Carter's evident wil
lingness to use military force to oppose
any further Soviet moves in the Middle
East may necessitate the "use of tacti
cal nuclear weapons," should the
U.S.S.R. make a move for Iran.
"The inability of the U.S. to respond
with conventional forces imposes a ter
rible dilemma" for policymakers, he
said.
However, Brecher said he "cannot
believe that the Soviet regime is so ir
responsible to attack the Middle East
area."
Brecher said that the position of Is
rael is stronger as a result of the recent
turmoil in the Middle East. "When the
two superpowers disagree, it is an op
portunity for Israel to improve its bar
gaining position with Washington."
Israel could be a key to an American
defense commitment in the region, he
said.
He warned, however, that the Un
ited States will also have to look to
moderate Arab states to help in this
defense commitment and that this de
pendence, coupled with the existing
requirements for Middle East oil, will
also give them added leverage with
Washington.

Brecher expanded on this theme,
stating that there was an "astonishing
imbalance in the nature of U.S. reac
tion to Soviet moves in Afghanistan."
He cited the lack of a firm American
response to initial Soviet meddling with
Afghanistan's government in 1978 as
evidence the Soviets "believed that

they would not encounter such a strong
U.S. reaction" in their latest moves.
Brecher termed American reaction
to Soviet movement into Afghanistan
as excessive and said that it was a sharp
contrast to the measured reaction
which followed the hostage crisis in
Iran. The "cumulative frustration" of
simultaneous crises was the reason for
this sharp swing in sentiment, he said.
Commenting that "every crisis offers
opportunities," George said that the
Afghanistan crisis is "forcing us to
learn certain lessons . . . that we must
develop a more sophisticated foreign
policy" to handle the various needs of
U.S. interests in different parts of the
world.
The United States must learn that
"deterrence is an instrument of foreign
policy and not a substitute tor it."he
said.
While "detente is now in a deep
freeze," George said that "both super
powers will come to their senses" and
"the time will come . . . when the two
sides will talk cold turkey about how to
handle their relationship."
"The United States is absolutely in
capable of preventing the Soviets from
moving into Iran," Dallinsaid. Brecher
and George both agreed.
In light of this, Brecher said that
President Jimmy Carter's evident wil
lingness to use military force to oppose
any further Soviet moves in the Middle
East may necessitate the "use of tacti
cal nuclear weapons," should the
U.S.S.R. make a move for Iran.
"The inability of the U.S. to respond
with conventional forces imposes a ter
rible dilemma" for policymakers, he
said.
However, Brecher said he "cannot
believe that the Soviet regime is so ir
responsible to attack the Middle East
area."
Brecher said that the position of Is
rael is stronger as a result of the recent
turmoil in the Middle East. "When the
two superpowers disagree, it is an op
portunity for Israel to improve its bar
gaining position with Washington."
Israel could be a key to an American
defense commitment in the region, he
said.
He warned, however, that the Un
ited States will also have to look to
moderate Arab states to help in this
defense commitment and that this de
pendence, coupled with the existing
requirements for Middle East oil, will
also give them added leverage with
Washington.
U.S. overreaction to the Soviet-
American crisis involving Afghanistan
will have "far more consequences than
the Cuban missile crisis" on American
foreign policy when viewed with the
perspective of history, claims visiting
Prof. Michael Brecher.
Brecher made this assessment last
night during a panel discussion in
Toyon lounge. Prof. Alexander Dallin
of the history and political science de
partments also offered his views on the
current situation between the two
superpowers. Prof. Alexander George,
also of the political science depart
ment, acted as moderator.
The Afghanistan crisis has spurred

the "revival of the Cold Warrior men
tality" in the United States, Brecher
said.
In addition, it has signaled the "end
of the Vietnam War complex," the
much-discussed notion that America
had lost its nerve to play an active
military role in world affairs, he said.
"The ease with which the mood ot
the nation swings from total trust to
total mistrust" of the Soviet Unio l <.
alarming, Brecher said.
"The transformation in the public
mood toone that wills overt conflict" in
the world may, he said, "lead to a
strengthening of the military-industrial
complex."
Brecher said he believes Soviet in
tervention in Afghanistan has been

"taken out of all proportion."
Dallin agreed, adding "It is essential
tor the United States to react" to the
Soviet moves in the Middle East. How
ever, it is equally essential not to over
react.
"It (the Soviet Union) did not see its
actions in Afghanistan as a showdown"
between the two superpowers, Dallin
said.
Us action was "not part of some
grand design" to cut off oil supplies to
the West or to gain a warm water port,
he said. Soviet military intervention in
the affairs of Afghanistan was a "way
to break the encirclement" of the
Soviet Union by the four other major
world forces: China, Japan. Western
Europe and the United States, Dallin
said.
It also was a reaction to the political
instability of a Soviet clicnt state, he
said.
But Moscow miscalculated the cost
of its move into Afghanistan, Dallin
said. He said that the Soviets probably
thought the United States had written
off Afghanistan. It was "a low risk op
eration" in the minds of the Soviets,
Dallin said.
