# Just ordinary students with a strong self-image
## An inside spirit sparks Dollies' appeal 
### Richard Hefter Staff Writer 
They were sitting on the grass
in their red sweatsuits, awaiting
practice, giggling and eating
chocolate chip cookies. They
looked so much like ordinary
tun-loving students that this re
porter approached them with
uncertainty and asked: "Are you
the Dollies?"
Although very attractive, they
surely did not seem like the
"goddesses" and "sex symbols"
he'd heard so much about. And
while talking with them, he
realized that his preconceived

image of the "aloof, Dolly" was
wrong.
Certainly, they see themselves
differently.
"Some think of us more on the
terms of the Dallas Cowboy
cheerleader-type image, and we
don't think of ourselves in that
image at all," said sophomore
Wendy Scroggin. "There are
those people in the crowd that
say,' Look at them — they're just
a bunch of.
"But there's also people that
look at any woman like that."
added senior Trinka Geil. "1
think a lot depends on how we
look at ourselves and we don't

see ourselves as sex symbols."
The Dollies said they feel that
much of their audience appeal
comes from their "spirit inside."
Sophomore Carol Game/
explained, "It (the audience ap
peal) comes out through the
dancing — from how much you
really love to dance. It's not that
the Dollies are beautiful or have
to look a certain way or anything
like that. You can show a lot of
your personality just by dancing
and smiling and having a good
time."
T he Dollies admit that some
times they do not have very
much audience appeal. For

example, at a basketball game at
the University of Washington,
they were dancing on the court
during halftime when the band
members from Washington
came onto the floor and began
mocking and imitating them.
"But our band came down
and surrounded us, and escorted
us off the floor. They watch out
for us," said Geil.
On another occasion, the Dol
lies were dancing at a women's
professional basketball game,
and were getting hassled by
feminists in the stands.
"We were doing what we
' wanted to do — what we've been
doing for the entire season,"
Game/, said. "Just because a lit
tle group dislikes us and is
against what we're doing is not
going to stop us."
Geil added, "I think what it
comes down to is that you can't
really worry about what other
people are thinking. You have to
just do it for yourself and hope
that because you're enjoying
yourself, they're enjoying you
too."
Here on campus, the Dollies
said they never get teased or
bothered. And for the most part,
the fans are very receptive to
them.
"There are some that proba
bly get the impression that we're
trying to show off and act really
cutesy. . . . But then there's a lot
of other people who really ap

preciate what we're doing for the
school — that we're standing be
hind Stanford — and we're danc
ing because we're supporting the
team and trying to arouse spirit,"
Gamez said.
Sophomore Dolly Jayne
Sherry explained, "Just the fact
of us being Dollies might make
some lose respect but you know,
you can't please everybody. But
your best friends and room
mates, they know what hard
work you go through. They know
you sweat out there and they re
spect you."
The Dollies practice everyday
during the football season from
after lunch until dinner, and
three times a week during the
basketball season. They have
50 to 60 routines which they de
velop themselves.
Performing at football games
makes up only about 10 percent
of their work, according to
Scroggin. Most of their time is
spent at rallies, alumni functions,
banquets, special athletic events
and breakfasts and luncheons.
"You meet so many people,
and people that are sincere,"
Game/, said. "They are not fake
and don't like you just because
you're a Dolly. They're alums
and other people that are in
terested in the school and they
respect you because you repre
sent Stanford," she added.
The Dollies also do promo
tional work. They appear in sev
eral magazines and have done
commercials for a Japanese elec
tronics company, Hitachi. In ad
dition, they are pictured in
brochures and calendars, and
have modeled for the Athletic
Department.
Will there ever be a Dollies
poster?
"No way!" they unanimously
replied.
Because the job of being a
Dolly obviously requires so
much time away from school
work, it is customary that a
woman only be a Dolly for one
year. And so, the 1979-80 Dol
lies will soon be giving up their
positions.
On Feb. 22, tryouts take place
for next year's Dollies. Each
woman who tries out must per
form a routine that she has made
up. Clinics to help with routines

will take place throughout Feb
ruary before the tryouts.
The judges for the tryouts are
primarily the hand and in addi
tion, some alumni, according to
this year's group. The women are
judged on the originality of their'
routines, and on their appear
ance, appearance being "the way
you handle yourself," Scroggin
said.
"It's hard to say exactly how
each individual judge chooses."
she said. "We really don't know
what they judged us on."
What do the new Dollies have
to look forward to?

According to Sherry, "You
meet so many people, and you
really feel like a part of the Uni
versity. When we go down to the
Athletic Department, we feel
like we're needed and we're
wanted and we're doing some
thing to help out.
"And plus that, you get to
know four other girls so well, and
you get to know yourself too, be
cause you realize how selfish you
can get to be. You realize bad
things about yourself as well as
good things, that you can really
handle a lot of pressure and put
up with a lot of stuff you couldn't
put up with before."

On Feb. 22, tryouts take place
for next year's Dollies. Each
woman who tries out must per
form a routine that she has made
up. Clinics to help with routines

will take place throughout Feb
ruary before the tryouts.
The judges for the tryouts are
primarily the hand and in addi
tion, some alumni, according to
this year's group. The women are
judged on the originality of their'
routines, and on their appear
ance, appearance being "the way
you handle yourself," Scroggin
said.
"It's hard to say exactly how
each individual judge chooses."
she said. "We really don't know
what they judged us on."
What do the new Dollies have
to look forward to?

According to Sherry, "You
meet so many people, and you
really feel like a part of the Uni
versity. When we go down to the
Athletic Department, we feel
like we're needed and we're
wanted and we're doing some
thing to help out.
"And plus that, you get to
know four other girls so well, and
you get to know yourself too, be
cause you realize how selfish you
can get to be. You realize bad
things about yourself as well as
good things, that you can really
handle a lot of pressure and put
up with a lot of stuff you couldn't
put up with before."

The Dollies practice every afternoon during football season,
although only 10 percent of their performance time is devoted
to halftime or pre-game routines such as this one.
They were sitting on the grass
in their red sweatsuits, awaiting
practice, giggling and eating
chocolate chip cookies. They
looked so much like ordinary
tun-loving students that this re
porter approached them with
uncertainty and asked: "Are you
the Dollies?"
Although very attractive, they
surely did not seem like the
"goddesses" and "sex symbols"
he'd heard so much about. And
while talking with them, he
realized that his preconceived

image of the "aloof, Dolly" was
wrong.
Certainly, they see themselves
differently.
"Some think of us more on the
terms of the Dallas Cowboy
cheerleader-type image, and we
don't think of ourselves in that
image at all," said sophomore
Wendy Scroggin. "There are
those people in the crowd that
say,' Look at them — they're just
a bunch of.
"But there's also people that
look at any woman like that."
added senior Trinka Geil. "1
think a lot depends on how we
look at ourselves and we don't

see ourselves as sex symbols."
The Dollies said they feel that
much of their audience appeal
comes from their "spirit inside."
Sophomore Carol Game/
explained, "It (the audience ap
peal) comes out through the
dancing — from how much you
really love to dance. It's not that
the Dollies are beautiful or have
to look a certain way or anything
like that. You can show a lot of
your personality just by dancing
and smiling and having a good
time."
T he Dollies admit that some
times they do not have very
much audience appeal. For

example, at a basketball game at
the University of Washington,
they were dancing on the court
during halftime when the band
members from Washington
came onto the floor and began
mocking and imitating them.
"But our band came down
and surrounded us, and escorted
us off the floor. They watch out
for us," said Geil.
On another occasion, the Dol
lies were dancing at a women's
professional basketball game,
and were getting hassled by
feminists in the stands.
"We were doing what we
' wanted to do — what we've been
doing for the entire season,"
Game/, said. "Just because a lit
tle group dislikes us and is
against what we're doing is not
going to stop us."
Geil added, "I think what it
comes down to is that you can't
really worry about what other
people are thinking. You have to
just do it for yourself and hope
that because you're enjoying
yourself, they're enjoying you
too."
Here on campus, the Dollies
said they never get teased or
bothered. And for the most part,
the fans are very receptive to
them.
"There are some that proba
bly get the impression that we're
trying to show off and act really
cutesy. . . . But then there's a lot
of other people who really ap

preciate what we're doing for the
school — that we're standing be
hind Stanford — and we're danc
ing because we're supporting the
team and trying to arouse spirit,"
Gamez said.
Sophomore Dolly Jayne
Sherry explained, "Just the fact
of us being Dollies might make
some lose respect but you know,
you can't please everybody. But
your best friends and room
mates, they know what hard
work you go through. They know
you sweat out there and they re
spect you."
The Dollies practice everyday
during the football season from
after lunch until dinner, and
three times a week during the
basketball season. They have
50 to 60 routines which they de
velop themselves.
Performing at football games
makes up only about 10 percent
of their work, according to
Scroggin. Most of their time is
spent at rallies, alumni functions,
banquets, special athletic events
and breakfasts and luncheons.
"You meet so many people,
and people that are sincere,"
Game/, said. "They are not fake
and don't like you just because
you're a Dolly. They're alums
and other people that are in
terested in the school and they
respect you because you repre
sent Stanford," she added.
The Dollies also do promo
tional work. They appear in sev
eral magazines and have done
commercials for a Japanese elec
tronics company, Hitachi. In ad
dition, they are pictured in
brochures and calendars, and
have modeled for the Athletic
Department.
Will there ever be a Dollies
poster?
"No way!" they unanimously
replied.
Because the job of being a
Dolly obviously requires so
much time away from school
work, it is customary that a
woman only be a Dolly for one
year. And so, the 1979-80 Dol
lies will soon be giving up their
positions.
