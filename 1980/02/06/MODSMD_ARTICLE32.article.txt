# Black political clout falls short
## 
### Richard Herzfelder 
NEW YORK (AP) — The
NAACP says blacks help elect
many politicians, yet still lack
political clout. One problem is
that politicians don't know what
blacks want them to do.
"We've needed something
that will get their attention," says
Joseph Madison director of voter
education for the National As
sociation for the Advancement
of Colored People.
A new commercial polling or
ganization, Data Black Public
Opinion Polls, proposes to do
just that. On Tuesday, it released
a presidential preference poll of
1146 blacks that showed Presi

dent Jimmy Carter trailing Sen.
Edward Kennedy by 49 percent
to 31 percent among registered
black Democrats. Seventy per
cent of the blacks contacted
identified themselves as democ
rats.
The figures are almost a rever
sal of the latest CBS-New York
Times poll, taken early in
January, which showed that na
tionally Democrats preferred
Carter by a 44-percent to 34-
percent margin.
Data Black was formed to cor
rect what the founders say are
the inadequacies of present na
tional polling organizations
when they turn to blacks.

Chief among those in
adequacies, according to one of
Data Black's founders,
psychologist Kenneth Clark, is
the number of blacks in a typical
sample.
And it is impossible, within
that already small group, to draw
any conclusions on opinions of
even smaller groups, such as
college-educated blacks, he says.
The questions the national
pollsters do ask blacks present
another problem.
"They used to ask questions
like 'What do you people want?'
or' Who are your leaders?" " says
Clark. "As if blacks were Mar
tians."

But, he adds, ordinary polls
can't get significant data for
more specific questions, since
their sample is so small.
Another Data Black founder,
former Manhattan Borough
President Percy Sutton, says
blacks almost naively "put on
American eyes" when respond
ing to general questions. He
points out that when Data Black
asked blacks to name the two or
three most important problems
facing the United States today,
44 percent cited the Iran situa
tion (the poll was almost finished
by the end of December), 30
percent named inflation and 27
percent said unemployment.
