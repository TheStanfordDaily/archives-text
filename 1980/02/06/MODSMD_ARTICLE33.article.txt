mayor of the Winter Olvmpic
Village at Lake Placid.
think it's the best
.rthl etes' village ever provided
forUne Winter Games. Because
it's going to be a minimum sec
urity prison when the Olympics
are over, we have had to put up
with a lot of hostile comment
from the world press."
Some of it does look like a
prison, particularly the small
two-bed rooms with plain brick
walls-and no windows. But the
whole complex at Ray Brook, a
few riples out from Lake Placid
village in the Adirondack Moun
tains. compares well overall with
Innsbruck in 1976 and Sapporo
in 1972.
"It was built as an Olympic
Villagje. not as a prison," Fregoe
said. "We approached the Pris
ons tjureau to build it, they
didn't, approach us. We almost
had to go down on our knees and

beg them to do it."
The committee has endured
some criticism of the planning
for the facilit\. notably last week,
when a Soviet sports official said
that it was "anti-humane" to ex
pect athletes to stay in a building
destined to be a prison.
Some Olympic villages have
apartments for two or three, con
sisting of a bedroom, living room
and kitchen. This one offers the
athletes bedrooms only, with big
communal living rooms.
It means some of the bed
rooms are small and plain. But
Fregoe defended the planning on
grounds that it helps the athletes
to get together more.
"Instead of staying in their
own apartments they go out into
the big rooms," Fregoe said.
"Bobsledders meet downhill
skiers, biathlon competitors
meet skaters. That's what the
Olympic Games are all about."
Fregoe, a Lake Placid resi
dent. is one of the many villagers
who have dedicated themselves

to the Winter Olympics. Two
years ago he temporarily gave up
his job as an insurance salesman
to work full-time on organiza
tion of the athletes' village.
When Lake Placid was
awarded the Games six years ago
it had no firm plans for a village.
Under the rules of the Interna
tional Olvmpic Committee, the
village had to be fenced and well
secured. And in line with Olym
pic traditions, Lake Placid had to
find a permanent use for it when
the Games were over.
" 1 went to see a minimum sec
urity prison at Memphis, Tenn.,
and decided it would be just the
thing," Fregoe said. "And that's
how we came to hit on a prison."
When all the athletes are as
sembled there will be 1 800 living
in the small units that make up
this complex among the snowy
hills. They will be provided en
tertainment day and night, in
cluding a theater and a cinema
and a pinball hall with 20
machines, all free.
