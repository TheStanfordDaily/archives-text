# New talent powers Cards over USF
## 
### Cathy Dickerson Staff Writer 
A couple of towering home
runs marked an otherwise typical
pre-season hasehall game at
Sunken Diamond yesterday as
the Cardinals defeated the Uni
versity of San Francisco Dons,
9-5. The victory extends the
Cards' win streak to five straight
after five games of pre-season
plav.
Catcher Bill Worden, who
transferred here from a junior
college in the Los Angeles area,
hit his first home run as a Cardi
nal in the second inning of yes
terday's game — a solo shot that
ricocheted off the top of the red
wall in left field. Freshman Mike
Aldrete blasted a two-run home
run deep to right center field in
his first trip to the plate yester
day, stepping in as designated
hitter in the fifth inning.
Worden's home run was just a
taste of future sweetness to Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess
who believes the 5-foot-11,
195-pound catcher will add the
power that Stanford has lacked
in the past couple of years. "He's
going to hit a lot more (home
runs)," Marquess stated
matter-of-factly.
Marquess was outwardly
pleased with the offensive per
formance of his club at the con
clusion of yesterday's contest.

Stanford produced nine runs on
1(1 hits although leaving 12 men
stranded. Freshman left fielder
Mike Dotterer ripped a triple to
right center in the tilth inning to
set up Aldrete's two-run home
run. Veteran second baseman
Paul /uvella went two-for-three
and walked twice in his five trips
to the plate. Mike Toothman
doubled down the left-field line
his second time at bat while Dave
Meier and John Elway each
added singles to the list.
Dotterer, whose .5N3 batting
average led the team going into
yesterday's game, continued to
make good contact at the plate,
but ended up one-for-three on
the day. Dotterer has started in
left field in all five of the games
so tar. due to Phil Wilson's arm
injury, and he has worked his
way up to lead-off batter in that
short span of time.
Dotterer claims he started off
"a little slow" this season, not
having practiced with the team in
the fall (because of football).
"1 wasn't hitting the ball as
well as I would have liked," said
Dotterer about starting practice.
"But I feel okay now. and I fi
gure it will only get better. . . for
the whole team. I'm looking for
big things this season," he ad
mits.
Dotterer and Elway have yet
to talk to new football head

coach Paul Wiggin about playing
both baseball and spring foot
ball. However, Dotterer sounds
optimistic about doing both.
Defensively, the Cardinals
weren't as bright as they could
have been. A few instances of
misplaying the ball, although not
recorded as errors in the score
book, made it obvious that the
team is not set the "well-oiled
baseball machine" that it has to
be before league play begins. But
they've played only five games.
The pitching was perhaps the
weakest part of the game against
USF. Brian Mignano, who
pitched well Friday against the
Humboldt State Lumberjacks
couldn't find the strike zone yes
terday and left the game after
two innings hav ing given up four
runs on five hits and walking four
batters.
Sophomore Mike Sullivan, a
hard-firing sidearmer, made his
tirst appearance of the year after
recovering from a sore arm. Sul
livan entered the game in the
third inning, yielded only three
hits and one run during his four
inning stint on the mound and
had most of the batters popping
up.
"1 thought Sullivan turned in a
line performance." commented
Marquess. "There was no pain in
his arm after throwing. That's a
good sign." he said.

George l ope/ pitched the last
two innings for the Cards before
the snail-paced game was called
in the eighth inning on account of
darkness. Lope/ collected three
strike-outs in the two' innings,
but also walked three batters.
The only double-play turned by
the Card defense yesterday
helped get Lopez through his in
nings.
Most of the scoring in the
game came early with USF and
Stanford see-sawing back and
forth into the lead. Three runs in
the bottom of the first put the
Cards out in front for the first
time, 3-1. The Dons matched
those three in the second inning
with a walk, a single and a couple
ot scattered singles, taking the
lead 4-3.
Bill Worden's home run tied
the score at 4-4 in the bottom of the
second. Third baseman Steve
Buechele scored from second on
El way's solid line drive to center
in the third inning, again putting
Stanford on top. But USF first
baseman Kevin Cronin single
handedly knotted the score at
5-5 with a solo home run popped
high over right field fence.
Hie final go-ahead run — the
one that provided the margin of
victory for the Cards — came in
the bottom half of the fourth on a
well-coached set of plays.
Zuvella reached base by beat

ing out a ground ball hit deep in
the hole at short. He then stole
second before the Dons' second
pitcher of the afternoon walked
Toot lima 11.
With Dave Meier at bat and
runners on first and second, the
USF fielders were guessing bunt
all the way and so were charging
in. Meier swung away and laced
the ball past the third baseman
and into left field scoring Zuvella
from second.
Stanford added three insur
ance runs in the fifth with Al
drete's two RBI home run and
Zuvella's double that dropped in
between the USF shortstop, left
fielder and center fielder. From
second, Zuvella stole third and
scored on an error on USF
catcher Dennis Laurel.
The Cardinals take to the road
this weekend. They travel to San
Luis Obispo for a three game
series with Cal PoIySLO. Friday,
the two teams will meet at 2:30
p.m. and Saturday a doub
leheader will begin at noon.
