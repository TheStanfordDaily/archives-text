Karate receives grant
The Stanford Karate Club re
cently received a $4000 grant
from a Stanford alumna to en
courage women to learn the mar
tial arts.
According to club representa
tive George Pegelow. the grant
came from Lois Verbrugge. who
resides in Ann Arbor, Mich.
"The gift is to be used to en
courage women to participate in
the martial arts program, in
order to learn mental and physi

cal skills in self defense," Ver
brugge said in a letter to the Uni
versity in the end of last year.
"If the gift helps one woman
avoid an assault," Verbrugge
said in her letter, "it will be well
worth its dollar amount."
The Stanford Karate Club
teaches a Chinese form of karate
known as kenpo. Its current en
rollment is about 150, of which
20 are women.
It is likely that the money will
be used to subsidize the cluh
dues for women who remain in
the club for more than one quar

ter, Pegelow said. Club dues are
$26 per quarter.
In her letter Verbrugge refer
red to herself as "the victim of a
brutal assault, and the constant
sufferer of its consequences."
She said that her gift to the club is
a way of fighting back on behalf
of herself and all women.
"Women should be encour
aged to take self defense because
the classes are so male
dominated," club member Carla
Arnold said.
