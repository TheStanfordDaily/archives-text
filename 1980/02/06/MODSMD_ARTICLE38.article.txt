# Raiders ready if injunction given
## SPORTS 
### Charles Maher The Los Angeles Times 
LOS ANGELES — A
spokesman for the Oakland
Raiders said in federal court here
Monday that the team would
move to Los Angeles if a judge
would grant an injunction pro
hibiting the National Football
League from vetoing the move.
U.S. District Judge Harry Pre
gerson said he would rule later.
Meanwhile, in Oakland,
negotiations between the Raid
ers and representatives of the
Oakland Coliseum remained in
turmoil. An original offer de
signed to keep the team in the
Bay Area city was withdrawn by
local officials last Friday and a
new offer promised. But the
Raiders said they still had not
received it late Monday after
noon.
A team official accused Oak
land Coliseum representatives of
"arrogance, procrastination, de
ceit (and) misrepresentation."
"When you spend a lot of time
with pigs," he said, referring to
certain local officials, "you've
got to come up smelling like gar
bage."
In Los Angeles, the Raiders
were represented at the court
hearing by attorney Joseph
Alioto, former mayor of San
Francisco.
"It simply boils down to this,"
Alioto said. "We are prepared to
conclude a contract with Los
Angeles this week to start work
next week" on renovation of the
Los Angeles Coliseum.
The Los Angeles Coliseum
Commission had said repeatedly
that the Raiders were on the
verge of moving south. But this
was the first time anyone with
direct authority to speak for the
club had said so.
The purpose of Monday's
court proceeding was to hear the
Coliseum Commission's motion
for a preliminary injunction that
would keep the NFL from en
forcing its team-transfer rule.
The rule requires a team to get
permission of three-fourths of

the league membership before
moving.
Lawyers tor the Coliseum
Commission argued that the rule
violated federal antitrust law by
restraining trade. They said Al
Davis, managing general partner
ot the Raiders, did not want to
ask league approval because he
was convinced he could not get
the necessary 21 affirmative
votes.
Coliseum Commission
lawyers said the rule could have
the effect of keeping a
businessman from doing busi
ness where he wanted to.
The NFL, represented by at
torney Henry Thumann of Los
Angeles, argued that the team
transfer rule was reasonable be

cause all NFL clubs had a legiti
mate interest in where each team
played its home games. Location
could affect attendance and
other matters of general league
interest, he said.
In the absence of a league ag
reement on where games were to
be played, he said, there could be
no league.
Edwin Heafey Jr., attorney for
the Oakland Coliseum, said the
court should consider the dam
age that losing the Raiders would
inflict on the Oakland commun
ity.
"The Oakland-Alameda
County Coliseum was built for
the Raiders," he said. "The
county is in debt $20 million."
Heafey said the Raiders had

been selling out home games for
12 years. And representatives of
the Oakland Coliseum were now
prepared to make "necessary
concessions" to the Raiders, he
said.
The Oakland offer withdrawn
last Friday was believed to be a
package worth $8 million to $10
million. The package offered by
the Los Angeles Coliseum has
been estimated at $17 million.
Both packages would include in
stallation of luxury boxes, a fea
ture sought by the Raiders.
Judge Pregerson's next move
could be to rule on the motion
for a preliminary injunction. Or
he could schedule the matter for
full trial.

The Oakland offer withdrawn
last Friday was believed to be a
package worth $8 million to $10
million. The package offered by
the Los Angeles Coliseum has
been estimated at $17 million.
Both packages would include in
stallation of luxury boxes, a fea
ture sought by the Raiders.
Judge Pregerson's next move
could be to rule on the motion
for a preliminary injunction. Or
he could schedule the matter for
full trial.
