Inmates save prison hostages
SANTA HE, N.M. — While more bodies were hunted in
the still-smouldering ruins of the New Mexico State
Penitentiary, a state official said yesterday many prisoners
risked their lives to save hostages from the horrible at
rocities inflicted on some inmates.
furthermore. Felix Rodriguez, deputy secretary of crim
inal justice, said many of the convicts trapped in the
weekend rioting should not have been there in the first
place.
After revising the death count several times, officials said
yesterday at least 36 inmates died — some of overdoses of
drugs — in the 36-hour reign of terror, the most savage
prison riot of modern times in this country. Thirty-nine had
been reported dead at one time.
Inmates said a convict execution squad armed with blow
torches and axes killed some prisoners in a cellblock that
held men identified as informants.
The murders, torture and mutiliations ended when state
police and National Guardsmen moved in Sunday after
noon.
Warden Jerry Griffin placed the death toll at 33 yester
day. but three other officials said 36 were confirmed dead.
Gov. Bruce King's press secretary, Jill Marron. said Grif
fin's total did not include three bodies found in the
burned-out gymnasium.
Rodriguez and Criminal Justice Secretary Adolph Saenz
also said many of the prisoners inside at the time had been
sentenced for lesser offenses and should not have been in
the maximum-security penitentiary.
" Maybe these people don't need to be in the institution."
Rodriguez said.
Rodriguez said a "hardcore group of 50 inmates only was
involved in the revolt. By intimidation, they did get some
others involved."
Killing, he said, "means nothing" to prisoners who are
sentenced to hundreds of years of prison.
Civiletti comments on FBI probe
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Benjamin
Civ iletti met with House leaders y esterday and indicated his
department will oppose giving evidence in the FBl's politi
cal corruption probe to congressional investigators.
Civ iletti proposed the meeting with congressional leaders
concerned about the FBI investigation, in which eight
members of Congress have been implicated.
Following the session, the attorney general said he had
told the congressmen that the Justice Department will pre
sent to the House ethics committee today "the position of
the department on preserv ing the integrity of the investiga
tion and . . . the role of the ethics committee."

Sources have said FBI undercover men posed as aides to
a wealthy Arab sheik willing to buy favors from con
gressmen and other public officials.
In all. some 20 public officials and 10 businessmen and
lawyers have been implicated, sources say. Undercover
agents paid out almost $500,000 in cash, but sources said
fewer than half the officials actually took money. Some
transactions were videotaped by the FBI agents.
Afghan rebels initiate new attacks
Anti-communist rebels, showing better organization and
equipped with heavy weapons, have launched new attacks
against Soviet troops in northeast Afghanistan's remote
Badakhshan province, inflicting casualties on the Soviet
units there. Western diplomatic sources in India reported
yesterday.
The Soviet news agency Tass confirmed an upsurge in
attacks since last weekend in Badakhshan and two other
eastern provinces, Nangarhar and Paktia, but its report did
not mention Soviet troops, saying instead that Afghan sol
diers were "liquidating" the "bandit gangs."
The Tass report also described the enemy as "well
armed," indicating that the ragtag contingents of Moslem
tribesmen of just a few weeks ago may be giving way to a
better coordinated rebel force.
U.S. issues human rights report
WASHINGTON — Human rights were repressed all
around the world in 1979. Dictatorships, of the left and
right, practiced torture and cracked down on dissent, ac
cording to a State Department report. But here and there,
freedom took a step forward.
In Warsaw Bloc countries, Poland and Hungary, internal
controls were eased. In Argentina, the incidence of people
seized without explanation dropped sharply and may be
near an end. In Egypt, liberalization moved ahead under
President Anwar Sadat.
These are among the findings in the State Department's
annual human rights report, submitted yesterday to Con
gress. For the first time, all 154 countries were surveyed.
The 854-page document is a calatogue of massive viola
tions. Only a few, such as the seizure of an estimated 50
American diplomats in Iran, are well-known. For the most
part, the victims are faceless to the world at large.
The abuses are set down in dry. bureaucratic language.
In Czechoslovakia, "overt opposition in any field is
punished."
In Ethiopia, "it still appears likely that the government
tortures political and military prisoners to extract informa
tion or confessions."
In Iran, "several thousand persons remain in custody for
political reasons."
In Libya, "detainees in criminal and security cases repor
tedly are frequently beaten during interrogation."
In South Africa, "the government reality of life ... is
apartheid."
Ali confers with Kenyan president
NAIROBI. Kenya — Muhammad Ali put some diploma
tic punch into his African tour yesterday when he conferred
with President Daniel Arap Moi and top members of the
Kenyan government.
Despite some verbal blows earlier at the State Depart
ment, Ali — on a five-nation trip for President Jimmy
Carter to w in support for a boy cott of the Moscow Olympics
— was described yesterday by department spokesman
Hodding Carter as "doing a great job on his mission."
Carter said, "the impact he's having is tremendous."
Between engagements, Ali took time out to visit a wild
animal park near Nairobi. The former heavyweight champ
ion said he wanted to box a lion, since he had beaten all the
men on Earth. "I'm out to conquer the animals and
monsters. I'll be the universal champion." Ali said.
He left his car twice, charging after antelope and zebra on
foot. They became frightened and ran away. There were no
lions in sight.
