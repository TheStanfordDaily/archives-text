# Workshop offers couples aid in controlling blood pressure
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
High blood pressure is considered by many Americans to
be an aspect of aging as inevitable as grey hair and wrinkles.
According to Craig Ewart,- a research associate in
psychiatry here, however, there may be simple means by
which an individual can control his blood pressure.
Based on recent studies concerning the effect of interper
sonal relationships on blood pressure, Ewart and Asst.
Psychiatry Prof. C. Barr Taylor are now offering a blood
pressure management workshop for couples.
High blood pressure, which afflicts approximately 20
percent of the American adult population, is a dangerous
condition which can damage arteries and greatly heightens
the risk of heart attack and stroke.
Although high blood pressure seems to be a physical
phenomenon, Ewart said, the condition actually seems to
be particular to industrialized societies. Ewart said he be
lieves this because there are cultures today in which blood
pressure does not rise in conjunction with increasing age.
"There is considerable debate as to why this occurs,"
Ewart said. "It has been proven that salt affects blood
pressure, but there are other factors."
Past research shows that psychological factors can influ
ence high blood pressure. Experiments with mice in over
crowded environments indicate a link between aggression
and increased blood pressure.
"In the '50s and '60s patients' blood pressures were
measured while doctors asked them threatening questions,
and their blood pressure did go up," explained Ewart. "But
these were abnormal situations."
Rather than observe the influence of aggression and ten
sion in situations that one rarely encounters, Taylor and
Ewart examined these factors in the context of family rela
tions.
Husband and wife teams were observed and monitored
for long periods, thus giving the researchers a natural, on
going interpersonal relationship as a base.
When controversial topics were discussed, blood pres-

sure rose significantly.
Subsequently it was found that if the couples practiced
certain social skills recommended by the researchers, in
crease in blood pressure during these controversial discus
sions was almost eliminated.
"If people develop better coping skills, they may also
develop better control of their blood pressure," said Ewart.
The concept of having a partner is crucial to the new
workshop because "these are behavioral skills people have
to practice in their daily lives, and the partner will be the
best person to help," explained Ewart.
The partner is also important in making the other aware
of stress that is sometimes repressed or ignored.
"Many men are influenced by our society's creed not to
show teelings, and professions often reinforce this," Ewart
said. "The wife is often a good observer and can help him
become aware of stress that he has been repressing or
ignoring."
Specific skills the participants will learn include improv
ing listening techniques, checking out and summarizing the
partner's feelings, identifying stress and learning to alter
stressful situations.
"It is not what you talk about, but how you talk about it
that is involved here," said Ewart. "Much frustration arises
from the feeling that one is not being heard."
Though Ewart is optimistic about the success of the prog
ram, he sees this type of blood pressure management as
more of an aid than a cure. Drugs are still vital in dealing
with high blood pressure, he said.
"This will never completely replace drugs," Ewart added.
"But for those who don't respond adequately to these
drugs, this could serve as an additional method."
Blood pressure is not a concern limited only to those over
30 years old. High blood pressure can develop early in life.
Ewart recommended staying away from excessive con
sumption of salt, controlling one's weight and keeping in
mind that there is sufficient evidence that stress has a direct
influence on blood pressure.
