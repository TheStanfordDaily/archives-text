From the Daily wire services
Touring New Hampshire yesterday
on the eve of his 69th birthday, Ronald
Reagan boasted that his age is an asset
and that debate among the GOP presi
dential rivals would help voters deter
mine "where we differ."
As if to demonstrate his resilience,
Reagan criss-crossed the state by bus.
darted into the streets to greet the
people and showed no hesitation to
talk about his age.
"The question is,' Would my age be a
factor against me in the campaign?' "
Reagan told a Plaistow, N.H., high
school audience. "I don't think the
number of years are very important as
long as you retain your faculties, your
physical abilities and so forth. I think 1
have.
"Then," he quickly added, "along
with age goes experience, and hope
fully you've acquired some common
sense along the way."
Reagan said he now favors a debate
with his rivals.
"I'll be debating" in New Hamp
shire, he said. Reagan said he at first
opposed the idea because he felt it
would prove divisive to the Republican
Party.
Now, he said, he feels people have a
right to see the Republican candidates
to find out "if we differ, where we dif

ter.
Elsewhere, Sen. Howard Baker
(R-Tenn.) complained about the
length of time required for presidential
campaigning. And George Bush was
endorsed by William Ruckelshaus, the
former assistant attorney general who
became a victim of the so-called
"Saturday Night Massacre" during the
Watergate scandal. Baker said presi
dential campaigning has turned into "a
lifetime career."
Ruckelshaus said he was backing
Bush because the former U.N. ambas
sador "possesses the essential qualities
of political leadership, experience,
character, energy, wisdom and cour
age."
On the Democratic side. Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy lashed out once more at
President Jimmy Carter's foreign pol
icy. Campaigning in Maine, he accused
Carter of failing to stand up to the Rus
sians.
Kennedy said Carter had reversed
his position refusing to accept the
"status quo" of Soviet troops in Cuba
by failing to do anything about their
continued presence on the island na
tion.
Meanwhile, Carter and some Demo
cratic officials have written off Ken
nedy's chances of winning the party's
presidential nomination. But they are
seriously concerned that the Mas
sachusetts senator may persist in a
hopeless campaign and damage Car
ter's chances in the November general
election.
Because of such worries. Democratic
Party Chairman John White and Carter
political advisers have been quietly
contacting Kennedy's key liberal sup
porters and urging them to support
Carter if the Kennedy campaign col
lapses.
Both the Carter aides and party offi
cials say they believe Kennedy will
come under pressure from some of his
liberal supporters to withdraw. To help
apply that pressure. Carter supporters
have begun conferring with Kennedy
campaign leaders in labor, the civil
rights movement and the Jewish com
munity.
One real threat to Carter, his advis
ers believe, is that a stubborn Kennedy,
his pride wounded by a losing cam
paign. might remain in the race, even if
he does poorly in the early primaries
and caucuses, and cause the Democrats
to polarize into Carter and Kennedi
factions.
Afterlosing toCarter2-l in the lowa
caucuses last month. Kennedy said that
to remain a viable candidate he would
have to win both the Maine caucus ori
Feb. 10 and the New Hampshire prim
ary on Feb. 26.
However, in a speech at Georgetown
University on Jan. 28. reaffirming his
candidacy and sharpening his attack on
Carter and his appeal to the party's
liberal wing, the senator dismissed any
idea of dropping out â€” regardless of
how he does in those contests or later
ones.
