In 1944, Annette Lantos and her
husband, both Hungarian Jews, were
saved from Nazi persecution by
Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenburg.
Backed financially by the U.S. gov
ernment. Wallenburg saved 30,000 to
100,000 Jews in one year before he was
arrested by the Soviets in January 1945
for"protective purposes," Lantos said.
For the last three years, the Free
Raoul Wallenburg Committee has
been working to free the diplomat trom
his 35-year incarceration in a Soviet
prison. Lantos, a resident of Hillsboro,
is secretary of the committee.
Wallenburg's half-brother, Dr. Guy
von Dardel, is currently a visiting pro
fessor at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center from the University of
Lund in Sweden.
He is working on the electron
positron storage ring which will start
operating near the end of March.
Von Dardel said Wallenburg has
stayed alive because of his "unconven
tional manner and his sudden appear
ances."
According to Lantos, one story
which illustrates Wallenburg s "un
conventional manner" is told by
Joseph Lapid. director general of
Radio Israel.
"One day by the end of 1944 or in
January 1945 my mother was called to
work. That meant the gas chambers via
the ghetto or execution by the Danube
river. I was 1 3 years old, a lonely child.
When I said goodbye 1 felt like an or
phan.
"After four hours my mother came

back, saved by Raoul Wallenburg in
person. He was like a legend. He
turned up unexpectedly everywhere."
His ability to save one person or
thousands helped give the Hungarian
Jews the "courage and hope" they
needed, said Lantos.
In his last effort to save Jews, Wal
lenburg convinced General
Schimdthueber, the commander of the
German forces in Budapest, to protect
the Jews against Gestapo and German
troops, by telling the general he would
be held responsible for the deaths of
the Jews after the war, Lantos said.
Less than a month afterward, Wal
lenburg was taken into custody by the
Soviets. There is no particular reason
for the arrest, said von Dardel. Both
Lantos and von Dardel suggested that
the Russians suspected him of espion
age and that they were afraid of his
American backing.
The effort to free him did not begin
for 32 years because it was believed
that Wallenburg had died in a Soviet
prison. After 12 years of declaring that
the Swede had been shot by Germans
while in "protective custody," the
Soviets made a statement in 1957 that
the diplomat had died in a Russian
prison of a heart attack in 1947. Then
in November 1977 Simon Wiesenthal,
the Nazi hunter who found Adolf
Eichmann, announced that he had lo
cated Wallenburg in a Soviet mental
hospital.
Since then U.S. Senators Frank
Church (D-ldaho), Daniel Moynihan
(D-N.Y.), Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.) and
Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) have
