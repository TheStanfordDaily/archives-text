## Effort mounts to free wartime hero held 35 years by Soviets

In 1944, Annette Lantos and her
husband, both Hungarian Jews, were
saved from Nazi persecution by
Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenburg.
Backed financially by the U.S. gov
ernment. Wallenburg saved 30,000 to
100,000 Jews in one year before he was
arrested by the Soviets in January 1945
for"protective purposes," Lantos said.
For the last three years, the Free
Raoul Wallenburg Committee has
been working to free the diplomat trom
his 35-year incarceration in a Soviet
prison. Lantos, a resident of Hillsboro,
is secretary of the committee.
Wallenburg's half-brother, Dr. Guy
von Dardel, is currently a visiting pro
fessor at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center from the University of
Lund in Sweden.
He is working on the electron
positron storage ring which will start
operating near the end of March.
Von Dardel said Wallenburg has
stayed alive because of his "unconven
tional manner and his sudden appear
ances."
According to Lantos, one story
which illustrates Wallenburg s "un
conventional manner" is told by
Joseph Lapid. director general of
Radio Israel.
"One day by the end of 1944 or in
January 1945 my mother was called to
work. That meant the gas chambers via
the ghetto or execution by the Danube
river. I was 1 3 years old, a lonely child.
When I said goodbye 1 felt like an or
phan.
"After four hours my mother came

back, saved by Raoul Wallenburg in
person. He was like a legend. He
turned up unexpectedly everywhere."
His ability to save one person or
thousands helped give the Hungarian
Jews the "courage and hope" they
needed, said Lantos.
In his last effort to save Jews, Wal
lenburg convinced General
Schimdthueber, the commander of the
German forces in Budapest, to protect
the Jews against Gestapo and German
troops, by telling the general he would
be held responsible for the deaths of
the Jews after the war, Lantos said.
Less than a month afterward, Wal
lenburg was taken into custody by the
Soviets. There is no particular reason
for the arrest, said von Dardel. Both
Lantos and von Dardel suggested that
the Russians suspected him of espion
age and that they were afraid of his
American backing.
The effort to free him did not begin
for 32 years because it was believed
that Wallenburg had died in a Soviet
prison. After 12 years of declaring that
the Swede had been shot by Germans
while in "protective custody," the
Soviets made a statement in 1957 that
the diplomat had died in a Russian
prison of a heart attack in 1947. Then
in November 1977 Simon Wiesenthal,
the Nazi hunter who found Adolf
Eichmann, announced that he had lo
cated Wallenburg in a Soviet mental
hospital.
Since then U.S. Senators Frank
Church (D-ldaho), Daniel Moynihan
(D-N.Y.), Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.) and
Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) have

formed the Free Raoul Walienburg
Committee.
In a joint statement commenting on
the humanitarian efforts of the Swedish
diplomat, the senators said, "There is
too much evidence to accept the pat
Soviet statement that he died in 1947.
It appears that the Soviets want to
sweep the Walienburg case under the
rug. They do not want to have to exp
lain why they imprisoned someone
whose only crime was saving lives."
The evidence they refer to consists of
Soviet political ex-prisoners making
statements that they saw or communi
cated with Walienburg while in prison.
Most of the communication involved
codes tapped through prison walls, said
Lantos.
The last piece of evidence that Wal
ienburg is still alive came in December
of last year through a Soviet emigre
who wishes to remain anonymous. On
May 1, 1978 when a highly placed
KGB official told the emigre, "I have
under me a Swede who has been trying
to get out of here for over 30 years and
he is still in jail." The Israeli immigrant
did not realize the importance of the
statement until he heard stories of Wal
ienburg in Israel.
During October of last year Lantos
had the opportunity to talk with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. "We have inquired
into the Walienburg case with the Rus
sians both when I was in Vienna this
year with President (Leonid) Brezhnev
and other Russian leaders," remarked
Carter. "The Soviets maintain their

claim that Walienburg is no longer
alive, but we are not forgetting about
this case," he told Lantos.
Von Dardel has fond memories of
his brother. The physicist remembers
the long walks the two of them took
with their sister, who is now in Sweden.
Though Walienburg is seven years
older than his brother, von Dardel re
calls they had many mutual friends.
Von Dardel likes to tell about a letter
Walienburg wrote to their grandfather
when the diplomat was working in one
of the family banks in Cape Town. He
wrote that he was not doing what he
wanted; he wanted to continue in ar
chitecture. Walienburg had received a
degree with honors from the University
of Michigan in architecture. Von Dar
del likes this story because he thinks
this "frustration," helps to explain why
Walienburg decided to go into Hun
gary.
As the story about Walienburg s in
carceration spreads, the main question
becomes how the current situation with
the Soviet Union will affect Wallen
burg's case. Von Dardel remarked
that, "the Soviets need to polish up
their image which has indeed been tar
nished." He said he hopes that they will
feel releasing his half-brother will help
their image.
On the other hand, he said, it is pos
sible that the Soviets believe it would
be embarrassing to admit that they had
imprisoned an innocent man for 35
years.

Yet his family, those he saved and
the governments he worked for are

striving to free Wailenburg. "He must
not be forgotten by the world," said
Lantos. "We must not allow that to
happen."
Raoul Wailenburg was, according to
Lantos, "the only shining light in an
otherwise blind and deaf world."

In 1944, Annette Lantos and her
husband, both Hungarian Jews, were
saved from Nazi persecution by
Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenburg.
Backed financially by the U.S. gov
ernment. Wallenburg saved 30,000 to
100,000 Jews in one year before he was
arrested by the Soviets in January 1945
for"protective purposes," Lantos said.
For the last three years, the Free
Raoul Wallenburg Committee has
been working to free the diplomat trom
his 35-year incarceration in a Soviet
prison. Lantos, a resident of Hillsboro,
is secretary of the committee.
Wallenburg's half-brother, Dr. Guy
von Dardel, is currently a visiting pro
fessor at the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center from the University of
Lund in Sweden.
He is working on the electron
positron storage ring which will start
operating near the end of March.
Von Dardel said Wallenburg has
stayed alive because of his "unconven
tional manner and his sudden appear
ances."
According to Lantos, one story
which illustrates Wallenburg s "un
conventional manner" is told by
Joseph Lapid. director general of
Radio Israel.
"One day by the end of 1944 or in
January 1945 my mother was called to
work. That meant the gas chambers via
the ghetto or execution by the Danube
river. I was 1 3 years old, a lonely child.
When I said goodbye 1 felt like an or
phan.
"After four hours my mother came

back, saved by Raoul Wallenburg in
person. He was like a legend. He
turned up unexpectedly everywhere."
His ability to save one person or
thousands helped give the Hungarian
Jews the "courage and hope" they
needed, said Lantos.
In his last effort to save Jews, Wal
lenburg convinced General
Schimdthueber, the commander of the
German forces in Budapest, to protect
the Jews against Gestapo and German
troops, by telling the general he would
be held responsible for the deaths of
the Jews after the war, Lantos said.
Less than a month afterward, Wal
lenburg was taken into custody by the
Soviets. There is no particular reason
for the arrest, said von Dardel. Both
Lantos and von Dardel suggested that
the Russians suspected him of espion
age and that they were afraid of his
American backing.
The effort to free him did not begin
for 32 years because it was believed
that Wallenburg had died in a Soviet
prison. After 12 years of declaring that
the Swede had been shot by Germans
while in "protective custody," the
Soviets made a statement in 1957 that
the diplomat had died in a Russian
prison of a heart attack in 1947. Then
in November 1977 Simon Wiesenthal,
the Nazi hunter who found Adolf
Eichmann, announced that he had lo
cated Wallenburg in a Soviet mental
hospital.
Since then U.S. Senators Frank
Church (D-ldaho), Daniel Moynihan
(D-N.Y.), Claiborne Pell (D-R.1.) and
Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) have

Guy von Dardel
formed the Free Raoul Walienburg
Committee.
In a joint statement commenting on
the humanitarian efforts of the Swedish
diplomat, the senators said, "There is
too much evidence to accept the pat
Soviet statement that he died in 1947.
It appears that the Soviets want to
sweep the Walienburg case under the
rug. They do not want to have to exp
lain why they imprisoned someone
whose only crime was saving lives."
The evidence they refer to consists of
Soviet political ex-prisoners making
statements that they saw or communi
cated with Walienburg while in prison.
Most of the communication involved
codes tapped through prison walls, said
Lantos.
The last piece of evidence that Wal
ienburg is still alive came in December
of last year through a Soviet emigre
who wishes to remain anonymous. On
May 1, 1978 when a highly placed
KGB official told the emigre, "I have
under me a Swede who has been trying
to get out of here for over 30 years and
he is still in jail." The Israeli immigrant
did not realize the importance of the
statement until he heard stories of Wal
ienburg in Israel.
During October of last year Lantos
had the opportunity to talk with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. "We have inquired
into the Walienburg case with the Rus
sians both when I was in Vienna this
year with President (Leonid) Brezhnev
and other Russian leaders," remarked
Carter. "The Soviets maintain their

claim that Walienburg is no longer
alive, but we are not forgetting about
this case," he told Lantos.
Von Dardel has fond memories of
his brother. The physicist remembers
the long walks the two of them took
with their sister, who is now in Sweden.
Though Walienburg is seven years
older than his brother, von Dardel re
calls they had many mutual friends.
Von Dardel likes to tell about a letter
Walienburg wrote to their grandfather
when the diplomat was working in one
of the family banks in Cape Town. He
wrote that he was not doing what he
wanted; he wanted to continue in ar
chitecture. Walienburg had received a
degree with honors from the University
of Michigan in architecture. Von Dar
del likes this story because he thinks
this "frustration," helps to explain why
Walienburg decided to go into Hun
gary.
As the story about Walienburg s in
carceration spreads, the main question
becomes how the current situation with
the Soviet Union will affect Wallen
burg's case. Von Dardel remarked
that, "the Soviets need to polish up
their image which has indeed been tar
nished." He said he hopes that they will
feel releasing his half-brother will help
their image.
