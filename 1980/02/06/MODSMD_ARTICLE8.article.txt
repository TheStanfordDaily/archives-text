## Begin denounces vandalism Israeli Christians terrorized 
### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
JERUSALEM — The Israeli
government, stung by charges
that police were "dragging their
feet" in protecting Christian
shrines from vandalism caused
by Jewish extremists, sought
Monday to reassure Christians of
its opposition to "intolerable
criminal acts."
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin issued a public statement
stating that "the authorities will
not tolerate acts of this kind." A
police official has been placed in
charge of combating vandalism
against Christian churches and
facilities. The Foreign Ministry
held a briefing for foreign jour
nalists to assure them that Israel
was doing all it could to half the
recent rash of attacks against
Christian sites.
"Convincing the population
that such acts are unacceptable is
as important as actual police ac
tion." said Jerusalem's mayor.
Teddy Kolleck. "We are now
making the public aware that
these things are dastardly acts."
Walls have been spray
painted with anti-Christian slo
gans. windows broken, stained
glass panels shattered, and
Christian clergymen harassed
and insulted on the street by
young men in incidents attri
buted to a small group of ultra
religious activists.
Last week a statement by
three Christian clergymen not
only decried the recent van
dalism. but also questioned why
there had been no results in the
investigation of the murder last
December of a Greek Orthodox
monk near Nablus, in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank.
"Intimations were made that
the Jewish extremists might have
killed him." said a senior Foreign
Ministry official, "but this is not
the way Jewish extremists be
have. He was murdered very
crudely, with knives and axes.
Jews who knew him were on very
good terms with him."
Christian leaders also decried
the fact that only four young sus
pects have been arrested in con
nection with the rash of anti-
Christian vandalism, and none in
the case of the monk's murder,
while authorities have detained
scores of Arabs in connection
with the shooting in Hebron last
week of a young Israeli soldier
w%iose death was attributed to
Palestinian terrorists.
Kolleck. Jerusalem's blunt
spoken major, considers the
anti-Christian vandals to be in
the same class with the terrorists
— but he pointed out Monday
that it was unusual for such inci
dents to occur in Jerusalem. "We
are saying these things are im
permissible acts on television.

radio, in all languages, and now
the prime minister is saying it
too." said Kolleck.
After the Christians' com
plaints were publicized last
month. Kolleck wrote to Begin,
asking that he take action against
the vandalism. Begin responded
with a letter to Kolleck which,
although strongly worded. Kol
leck considered insufficient to
the need for public action.
On Monday Begin issued a
formal statement that was re
leased widely by the Israeli pub
lic information operation:
"The authorities will not tol
erate acts of this kind. By the
laws of Israel, all faiths enjoy ab
solute freedom of worship, pro
tection of their properties and
freedom of access to their
shrines.
"Indeed, we take pride that
since the reunification of our

capital city. Jerusalem has en
joyed the harmony of co
existence and mutual toleration.
The authorities, therefore, will
do the utmost to prevent the re
currence of such intolerable
criminal acts."
The Foreign Ministry spokes
man said that the Kach (Thus)
movement of Rabbi Meir
Kahane. the oft-arrested foun
der of the Jewish Defense
League in the United States, was
believed responsible for the at
tacks. Kahane's group has de
nied committing the vandalism,
but members have said that it
was a meritorious deed for Jews
to attack those who are "taking
Jews away from their faith."
The vandals who have at
tacked the Christian facilities
have accused the Christians of
seeking to convert Jews to Chris
tianity and of violating the com
mandment against "graven im
ages" in the churches.
