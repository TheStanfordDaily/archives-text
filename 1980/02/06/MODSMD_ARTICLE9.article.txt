# Gandhi foes fear renewed repression

NEW DELHI — In the af
terglow of her election victory.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi
said last month that her govern
ment would seek broad coopera
tion to tackle India's pressing so
cial and economic problems.
Publicly avoiding political re
criminations against the Janata
Partv coalition that brought her
last administration down in
1977, she told a national radio
audience. "Our country needs
the healing touch."
Now. less than a month after
having been returned to office by
a landslide victory at the polls, it
appears that she may be chang
ing her tune.
— Political tension between
the government and the opposi
tion increased sharplv Monday
amid reports that an investiga
tive commission had indicted
members of the families of two
former prime ministers. Morarji
Desai and Charan Singh, on cor
ruption charges. Opposition
members of Parliament charged
that the worst of the corruption
allegations were leaked by the
government to a news agency,
and when Home Minister Zail
Singh refused to make the com
mission's complete findings av
ailable to Parliament, they
stormed out of the upper house.
— Last week, in her first major
parliamentary speech since re
suming office, Mrs. Gandhi ac
cused the former Janata gov
ernment of conducting an or
chestrated, vindictive campaign
to harass her. The government
tried to "humiliate both me and
my family in every way," she
said.
— The majority of her politi
cal appointments appear to re
flect a determination to concen
trate power around herself and

her 33-year-old son, Sanjay.
"There is no one in her cabinet
so far w ho could be considered to
have his own political base," one
observer said. "Only two people
hold power in India now, the
prime minister and her son."
— Last Tuesday, a police of
ficer who led the investigation
that resulted in Sanjay's arrest
and conviction for destroying a
film critical of his mother's rule,
was arrested himself. Mrs. Gan
dhi took credit for personally ob
taining his release, but the inci
dent unnerved those fearing a
period of political retribution.
— A preventive detention bill,
aimed primarily at hoarders and
black marketeers, was rammed
through the lower house of Par
liament by the Gandhi
controlled majority.
All these signs seem to point to
a return of authoritarian rule
under Indira Gandhi. But there
are some in India who take hope
in the prospect of greater

economic and social stability
under her strong central control.
Her mere presence has al
ready tended to slow the pace of
inflation, which was running at
about 17 percent a year.
There has been no official ac
tion to counter inflation since the
election, but the prices of some
essential food items, manipu
lated in the past through artificial
shortages, have dropped sig
nificantly.
The price of onions, a
mainstay of the Indian diet,
dropped from around 60 cents a
kilo (2.2 pounds) to less than 30
cents.
"Just her reputation as some
one who would enforce tough,
anti-hoarding regulations was
enough to empty storage sheds
and drop the prices," a political
observer explained.
So India waits to see if Mrs.
Gandhi can fulfill her election
promise of restoring stability and
if she will revert to the authorita

rian style of rule that charac
terized her last years as prime
minister.
As Sachchi Sahay, editor of a
prominent English-language
newspaper, The Statesman,
wrote last week, "The real
danger is that while civil liberty
may get devalued, the economic
and other goals may yet elude
her."
No one has forgotten the harsh
emergency rule that marked the
last two years of Mrs. Gandhi's
earlier government, which lasted
from 1975 until her defeat by the
Janata coalition in 1977. Sanjay
Gandhi's role during those two
years is particularly remem
bered.
It was Sanjay who ran India's
family planning program in the
earlier Gandhi government. He
was blamed for many of the
program's excesses, which in
cluded incidents of forced sterili
zation.
