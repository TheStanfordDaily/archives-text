You've heard all the wonderful stories ahout the seventies; now
read ahout the real and disturbing stories that we experienced in
the seventies. It's all in the February 1980 special tenth
anniversary issue of IMational Lampoon - plus pages of the
winners of the National Lampoon contest of nude girl friends
with buckets over their heads.
And for fans and collectors, the issue will include a complete
history of IMational Lampoon from its beginning, including its
special projects, sucH as record albums, radio shows, live
comedy productions and, of course, National Lampoon's
Animal House - how they came about and how we cornered
the market on the best comedy performers, such as John
Belushi, Gilda Radner, Chevy Chase, Bill Murray, and many
more.
It's all in the February issue of IMational Lampoon-on sale now.
