SALISBI R> Rhodesia I AP)
Britain introduced stilt mea
sures to curb political violence
that is mounting with the ap
proach of the Feb. 2S-2 1 ' elec
tions and independence.
British Ciov. Lord Soames
signed an ordinance yesterday
empowering him to ban political
meetings, muzzle candidates and
even outlaw parties violating the
cease-fire.
Soames, at a meeting Tuesday
with the election council repre
senting the nine parties in the
campaign, rejected appeals to
postpone the balloting because
of killings ;md threats.
He told them. "This wave of
violence and of intimidation
should be turned back. It would
be intolerable for any party to be
allowed to derive electoral ad
vantage from the use of such tac
tics."
Virtually all the cease-fire vio
lations have been blamed on

rival black parties seeking to
control this country of 6.7 mill
ion blacks and 230.000 whites,
which was under white control
tor nearly a century.
Ihe British sources s;iid no
party at the meeting opposed the
ordinance and all agreed to re
commend that their leaders sign
a declaration re-dedicating their
organizations to the London
sponsored peace pact agreed to
in December, which was to have
ended seven years of guerrilla
warfare.
Meanwhile, Marxist guerrilla
leader Robert Mugabe escaped
injury early yesterday when a
grenade exploded outside the
security wall of his home, but one
of his political associates was
badly hurt in a rocket attack on
Ins home two hours before.
Lour and a halt hours after the
attack on Mugabe's home, the
British governor. Lord Soames,
signed the ordinance.
