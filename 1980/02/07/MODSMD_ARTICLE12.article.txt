# Ghana economy plagues new leaders

### David Lamb The Los Angeles Times 
ACCRA. Ghana — Seven months ago
there was a mutiny 111 the (ihanaian armed
lorees. The rebels won eontrol ol the country
and set oft on a ruthless course.
In the space of a few days three lormer
heads ol state and five other top officials, all
notoriously corrupt, were tried and publicly
executed while the crowds shouted." Action,
action, finish them all."
Do/ens ol others who had swindled this
once-prosperous West African country to
the brink of bankruptcy were brought before
people's tribunals. The military jurors wore
masks. The accused were all lound guilty a nd
shipped oil to prison to start serving sen
tences that ranged up to 300 years.
The 15-man ruling junta fro/e rents and
fixed the price ol food. Vigilante groups pat
rolled the marketplaces, caning women trad
ers who were overcharging. Others' heads
were shaved. Taxi drivers charging more
than 25 cents a mile were taken to the milit
ary barracks where, one ol them recalled.
"They would beat you well.
Such behavior was very un-Cihanaian. lor
few people in Africa seem as gcnjje as the
Ghanaians. Governments have usually been
changed here with hardly a shot being fired.
Someone just walks into the radio station
and announces that he is the new head ol
state.
But the changes in leadership never
changed anything. Whether the new rulers
were soldiers or civilians, Ghana s treasury
always continued to be milked in a style that
would have done justice to the Matia.
'Kalabulc'
So when the junta began executing corrupt
officials and cracking down on kalabulc
(black markctccring). Ghanaians reacted
with a sense ol relic!.

Students spent their time discussing who
should be executed. In less than a week, de
linquent taxpayers lined up outside the col
lector's office with more than SI million for
the government.
Africa, though, was uncharacteristically
shocked at the style of the purge. Nigeria cut
off Ghana's oil supplies, three countries sent
missions to the capital of Accra to protest
and the state-owned limes ol Zambia
editorialized. ". . . The fact must remain
startlingly clear that the situation in (ihana is
symptomatic of a rottenness that is slowly
eating away at the very \itals ol African in
dependence."
l ast Sept. 23. the junta, headed by an air
force lieutenant, Jerry Kawlings, 32. sur
prised a good many people and, as he had
promised, handed over power to an elected
civilian government. Only twice belore in
black Africa — once in ( ihana in I and
once in Nigeria in l ( >7 1 ; — had military offic
ers ever voluntarily stepped aside and re
turned peacefully to the barracks.
1 he new president, Hilla l.imann. 4 l ). in
heritated a disaster area to govern.
l ime bomb
" I .1111 holding a time bomb," I.imann said.
Neither he nor his People's National Party
seem to have any idea how to save their
sinking nation other than to utter some
words ol good faith.
Shortly before l.imann took office, a
Western diplomat asked him what he was
going to do to encourage loreign investment.
"Encourage it?" he replied. "We won't have
to. As soon as we have a civilian government,
foreign investment will pour into Ghana."
It hasn't. Ciliana is $1 billion in debt, is X 9
months behind on its loan repayments, is

coping with an inflation rate of 70 percent
and is once again caught up in official corrup
tion. Shortages are so severe that Nigeria
sent in 23 truckloads ot food, medicine and
essential goods as a Christmas present.
Fatalism
So Ghana's brutal purge appears to have
had little effect, perhaps because it attacked
the creations rather than the causes ot cor
ruption and ineptness. The people seem'to
have accepted the fact that morality cannot
be legislated, and they have settled back into
a national state ot exhaustion and fatalism.
"When I came here two years ago," a
Western businessman said, "people told me
what incredible patience the Ghanaians had.
Then I looked around and said. 'Wait a mi
nute. This isn't patience. It's apathy."
"Over the years Ghana has tried socialism
and capitalism and neither worked. It's had
civilian presidents and military rulers, and
both have been equally corrupt and ineffi
cient.
tor (ihana. which in I 957 became the lirst
Kuropean colony in black Africa to gain its
independence, the downhill road has been an
inglorious one. In the early days, Ghana
proudly proclaimed itselt "the Black Star ot
Africa" and civil-rights leaders Irom
throughout the world came to pay homage to
President Kwanie Nkrumah, an apostle lor
the black-consciousness movement.
Hut Nkrumah allowed a prosperous ag
ricultural sector to deteriorate, and became
increasingly suspicious and repressive. In
1966, after declaring himself president lor
life and stripping the treasury bare, he was
overthrown by his own soldiers while on a
trip to China. The coup started 14 years ot
instability and economic chaos.
