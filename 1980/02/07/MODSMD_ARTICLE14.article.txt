# Soviets settle down in Afghanistan
## 
### Erwan Jourand Agence France-Presse 
KABUI , Afghanistan —
Nearlv si\ weeks after their mas
sive military intervention in Af
ghanistan. the Russians seem
more and more at home in the
Afghan capital.
Kabul and its suburbs have be
come a sort ot vast military
camp. I rom morning to night,
Red Army vehicles make their
way through the streets.
Armored cars, troop trans
ports, half-tracks, mounted
machine-guns, light tanks and
big snowplows on tractor tracks

come and go from one side of the
city to the other.
On the main street through the
Parwan neighborhood, to the
northwest of Kabul, journalists
counted a convoy ot trucks every
10 minutes and a tank every 20
minutes at certain times of day.
With snow on the ground, the
street has been churned into a
bog by the constant movement ol
Soviet tracked vehicles.
Everywhere in Kabul are am
bulances, mess trucks, radio veh
icles and fuel tankers. Otherveh
icles shuttle ceaselessly to a
water supply point near the air
port.
' At regular intervals, canvas
covered trucks full ol armed
Soviet soldiers pass slowly by in
downtown Kabul, on patrol.
Pugnacious posture
The impression of an oc
occupied city in wartime, with
foreign troops maintaining or
der, is sharpened by the sight ol
Soviet soldiers strolling around.
In the Shari-Nao market area,
formerly a rendezvous for hip
pies en route to Nepal or India,
Russian soldiers walk about in

pugnacious posture.
They are seen every day pas
sing among the little lleabag
hotels, the now-deserted guest
houses and the little shops selling
pushtins, the famous Afghan
skin coats.
for the last few days, these
streets have been overrun with
Soviet civilians. The new clients
are buying fox skins, jewels ol
doubtful authenticity and other
local products.
At Shari-Nao. they have
stormed the few boutiques sel
ling Western products. Ameri
can blue jeans and goods marked
"made in Korea" are especially
popular.
Submachine guns
Some of the Soviet civilians do
their shopping in a place called
the "green market" with sub
machine guns slung across their
shoulders.
The Soviet civilians — here to
bolster the demoralized Afghan
administration — appear to have
increased in number during the
past week. The area where they
were lodged near the airport is
overflowing, so another housing

project is under construction for
them nearby. For the last two
weeks, construction equipment
lias been moving about among
the pre-cast concrete buildings
that eventually will hold 1000
apartments.
Part of the project is nearly
complete, and from the outside,
it looks as though Afghan work
ers are installing the plumbing.
Another part is already in
habited. Early in the morning,
men leave for work, warmly
wrapped against the bitter cold,
briefcases in hand. They appear
to be Soviet advisers, waiting for
Afghan vehicles that come to
take them to ministries.
Not one has been seen taking a
taxi.
A little later, the Soviet
schoolchildren are picked up by
school buses. On hoard each is
an armed Russian in civilian clo
thing.
Soviet soldiers and armored
vehicles are also posted in the
housing project, which has its
own stores whose signs are
painted in Cyrillic lettering.
