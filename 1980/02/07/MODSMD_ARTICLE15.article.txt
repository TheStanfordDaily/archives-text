# Tokyo prepares for new 'oil shock'

The Los Angeles times
TOKYO â€” After a two-year reprieve from in
flation, Japan is getting ready tor a new round ot
soaring prices blamed on what is being called the
"second oil shock."
The first shock, which disrupted national
economies around the world, came in 1973-74,
after the oil cartel quadrupled its prices.
The second shock is following much the same
script, lor example, the nation's major electric
power companies recently applied to the govern
ment lor permission to raise rates by a record (>4.4
percent. Two days later the major gas companies
sought approval to raise rates an average ot 52
percent.
The government was expected to approve smal
ler increases, but nonetheless the new gas and elec
tric rates by themselves are threatening to drive
consumer prices up by nearly 3 percent.
1 ast year the entire consumer price index rose by
only 3.6 percent.
The government has forecast that consumer
prices will go up no more than 6.4 percent in the
fiscal year starting' April I. but this appears to be
little more than wishful thinking in view of
scheduled increases in the price of rice, wheat,
tobacco and other commodities, plus higher rail
way fares, postal rates, insurance premiums and
school tuition. Those, combined with the surge in

oil prices, spell trouble lor Japanese industry and
consumers.
Tokyo Electric Power Co. based its request for a
rate increase on calculations that imported oil will
cost $34.70 a barrel, more than twice what it paid
two years ago.
A weakening of the yen's value in relation to the
dollar has compounded the problem.
Two years ago. when the yen's value was rising,
importers were paying less and less in yen tor each
dollar's worth of imports. As a result, the prices
Japan paid in yen for coal, oil and related products
declined 1K.5 percent in l l >7N.
But last year, as the yen lost 3 percent of its value
in relation to the dollar, the yen cost of energy
imports doubled. Prices for imports of all kinds
rose 72.K percent, more than after the first oil
shock.
Usage ol electric ranges, blankets and vacuum
sweepers has risen by 35 percent since the last oil
shock. And almost a third of Japan's households
now have a second color television set. compared
to virtually none six years ago.
If the average household continues to use gas
and electricity at present levels, annual utility bills
could rise by as much as $205. Added toother price
increases, that could drive living expenses up by
$X 33 a year, according to the federation ol Japan
Livelihood Unions, a consumer interest group.
