## 
### Fran Miller Staff Writer 
About $17,000 in equipment was stolen from the
Radiology Department of the Stanford Medical Center yes
terday morning, according to Laura Hofstadter ot the Med
Center news bureau.
Larry Jordan of the Facilities Protection Department said
that the Med Center "has never experienced anything of
this magnitude before."
According to Palo Alto police officer Alan Garcia, the
theft occurred sometime between midnight and 5 a.m. yes
terday morning after an employee gave entrance to a man
claiming to be a repairman. Garcia said that there had been
some problems with the equipment previous to the incident.
He said that the man disappeared and the theft was disco
vered later in the morning when technicians were not able
to use their EMI brain scanner.
According to Hofstadter. the stolen equipment consists
of four small computer circuit boards from the brain scan
ner. Two circuit boards were from the central processing

unit, and two were from the memory bank of the Computer
which operates the scanner. Because these components
form the heart ot the logic system. Hofstadter explained,
the loss put the scanner out of operation.
EMI replacement parts provided by General Electric
from a warehouse in Mountain View allowed the system to
he back in operation by 5 p.m. yesterday. Permanent parts
are on their way from the East Coast company.
Garcia said that the scanner is a very sophisticated piece
of equipment and that one would "have to have a good
understanding of basic electronics, computer programming
and computer science, as well as compatible equipment" in
order to use the stolen property. He said that he has a
number of "very good leads" for possible suspects.
Hofstadter said scanners serve a variety of functions in
eluding measuring the progress of patients who have had
brain su r gery and keeping close track of the brain develop
ment of premature infants.
Director of Risk Management Robert Beth said that the
Med Center is self-insured for theft up to $25,000.
