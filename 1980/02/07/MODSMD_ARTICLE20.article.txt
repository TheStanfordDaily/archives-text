## We love comfort, but it isn't best 
### 
I hope. by now. you've begun lo care. I
hope you v ievv it with ;i broadei perspective.
Do you realize that eonser\;ition and en
vironmental awareness aren't just lot those
who wear Hirkcnstoeks and drink carrot
_juice?
lor now it is a quality-of-lile issue. It is .1
bigger issue than 111st saving trees 01 occa
sional!) riding the Marguerite, I'hcse prob
lems will aliect the quality ol vow life. I lie
environmental problems he lore us must be
confronted 01 we face losing pleasures we
take for granted elect 1 ic blankets to drives
111 Dad's convertible to Santa C'ru/ to blue
skies — just for a start.
To some it is even a moral problem, for
not conserv ing is selfish. It is thinking ol only
ourselves. Some aspire to unity in our conn
try orat least our Stanford community but
no. We are too stingy, too la/y. As we learn
to turn off our lights and ride our bikes, we
must learn to change our entire philosophy.
Conservation can't |ust be a nice thing to do
anymore. It must be a priority. It shouldn't
have to be convenient for you.
The present threat ol vvai determines the
need for conserv ing oil. So I'm hoping this

will lorn you to change your philosophy, it
you haven't already. You'll begin to see it as
a *.|uality-01-lile issue. And once you have,
you'll think and respond seriously not only
about oil conservation, but to other en
vironmental problems that aren't eminent
v<7. I ike air or water pollution, or waste ol
everything from food to gasoline.
Why haven't we gotten our rears-in-gear
sooner? Why am I risking repeating what
everyone has said before?
We've never believed that results of the
problems would affect us. Our sky will look
like I os Angeles' 111 We still don't
realize Windex doesn't clean skies and we
can't get a laddei and paint it blue.
We also don't believe out efforts can make
a diflercncc. We ignore the importance and
impact ol each person turning off their lights
and 1 iding their bicycles.
We are victims ol a false mentality.
We can stop ourselves from going to war
and we can keep our sky blue. II you re
member the drought, you recall California
conserved more water than experts said we
needed to.
Changing y our habits. Dirtv words? We've
got lo face our options, and we've got to
choose the best one. evenil it's tougher 111

the short run.
I irst, conserve all the oil you possibly can.
I sc onl> one light at a time. I urn down any
thermostat you can to (>() degrees, even oil.
Ride youi bicycle and public transmutation
whenever possible. He willing to sacrifice the
hall hour longer that it might take.
Second, [nek an environmental problem
and donate an hour a week toward its re
medy. Work at the Recycling Center, volun
teer at the May Area Pollution Control l)is
trict's oltice. Write your Congressman about
your concerns. I ven go talk to businesses or
industries about ways you think they could
conserve.
I hi id. don't get discouraged. You can get
so tired and cold just thinking about riding
youi bike to the Oasis and wearing your I .1
Bean sweaters in the house that you want to
forget all about conservation. I'm just begin
ning not to drive to school, and ii is the lirst
year I've leit the thermostat oil completely.
It's tough lor everyone. We all love com
lort best. But comfort isn't best for all of us.

To some it is even a moral problem, for
not conserv ing is selfish. It is thinking ol only
ourselves. Some aspire to unity in our conn
try orat least our Stanford community but
no. We are too stingy, too la/y. As we learn
to turn off our lights and ride our bikes, we
must learn to change our entire philosophy.
Conservation can't |ust be a nice thing to do
anymore. It must be a priority. It shouldn't
have to be convenient for you.
The present threat ol vvai determines the
need for conserv ing oil. So I'm hoping this

will lorn you to change your philosophy, it
you haven't already. You'll begin to see it as
a *.|uality-01-lile issue. And once you have,
you'll think and respond seriously not only
about oil conservation, but to other en
vironmental problems that aren't eminent
v<7. I ike air or water pollution, or waste ol
everything from food to gasoline.
Why haven't we gotten our rears-in-gear
sooner? Why am I risking repeating what
everyone has said before?
We've never believed that results of the
problems would affect us. Our sky will look
like I os Angeles' 111 We still don't
realize Windex doesn't clean skies and we
can't get a laddei and paint it blue.
We also don't believe out efforts can make
a diflercncc. We ignore the importance and
impact ol each person turning off their lights
and 1 iding their bicycles.
We are victims ol a false mentality.
We can stop ourselves from going to war
and we can keep our sky blue. II you re
member the drought, you recall California
conserved more water than experts said we
needed to.
Changing y our habits. Dirtv words? We've
got lo face our options, and we've got to
choose the best one. evenil it's tougher 111

the short run.
I irst, conserve all the oil you possibly can.
I sc onl> one light at a time. I urn down any
thermostat you can to (>() degrees, even oil.
Ride youi bicycle and public transmutation
whenever possible. He willing to sacrifice the

Second, [nek an environmental problem
and donate an hour a week toward its re
medy. Work at the Recycling Center, volun

trict's oltice. Write your Congressman about
your concerns. I ven go talk to businesses or
industries about ways you think they could
conserve.
I hi id. don't get discouraged. You can get
so tired and cold just thinking about riding
youi bike to the Oasis and wearing your I .1
Bean sweaters in the house that you want to
forget all about conservation. I'm just begin
ning not to drive to school, and ii is the lirst
year I've leit the thermostat oil completely.
It's tough lor everyone. We all love com
lort best. But comfort isn't best for all of us.
