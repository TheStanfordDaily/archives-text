## Plaza rallies narrow, dangerously misleading 
### 
Last week's anti-draft luillics
in White l'la/;i leave me deeply
troubled. On the one hand. I like
to see the students here in
terested again in world issues.
Hut. on the other hand, David
I larris. Daniel Ellsbergand Prol".
Bernstein have misled the stu
dents in a dangerous way. I et us
note a lew simple tacts.
First, David I larris talks of
those who forget history being
condemned to repeat. But he.
Ellsherg and especially Berns
tein (a history teacher!) make
this very mistake. They speak in
one breath ol the dangers ol nuc
lear war, and in the next ol the
threat of conscription. They tie
these two things together into
one issue. This is wrong. As we
learned too late in the cold war.

the tally way to avoid a nuclear
war is to he able and willing to
light a conventional war when
necessary.
It we resist building a strong
ground force, we invite nuclear
confrontation. With nuclear
weapons our only effective tools,
we face the choice of either being
responsible for starting the
deadly exchange when our
enemies reach our shores or
letting them overrun us. That is
not a good choice.
Perhaps Harris, Lllsberg and
Bernstein do reali/e this. But
then why do they tie the two is
sues together'.' Are they play ing
on the tears ol the students to
advance their own political
ends?
Second, with all the talk at

these rallies ol liberty and self
determination the leaders seem
dangerously shortsighted. Cer
tainly the students should worry
about how the draft will affect
their careers — but this pales
when compared to the way the
Soviets affect the countries they
overrun. The Soviets are our
enemies. With or without de
tente. the rivalry between Com
munism and"the West" goes on.
Those who doubt that the
West stands for a better and freer
system should read the accounts
ol common eiti/ens w ho ha\ e es
caped from Russia, or ponder
why there are walls around
Communist nations at all.
I hey re not to keep the Wester
ners out.
I or the Libertarians to scream

"we own our own lives" is all
well and good. I generally agree
with the l ibertarian positions.
But I ibertarianism fails to ac
count for this very problem ol
national defense. Even David
I reedman, one of the leading
Libertarian philosophers, agrees
that we should resist the Rus
sians — because, he says, the
"taxes'" are much higher under
their system.
Third, we must distinguish the
recent, problems in Southern
Asia from our debacle in Viet
nam. Like it or not, our national
security is 111 danger when the oil
reserves ol the Mid-East fall
within the Soviets' grasp. We
should certainly do all we can to
become less dependent 011 that
energy source. But we are stuck
111 that position now, and we
must live with it.
Compared to what some ;it
least argue about Vietnam, pro
tecting the Mideast is far from
an act of American imperialism.
The Russian move into Af
ghanistan was clearly unpro
voked and unjustified. These are
peace-loving people, eager to
protect their own self
determination. Certainly we pre
serve our own interest by protcct

mg other nations trom turthcr
aggression. Rut this hardly
makes our protecting them
wrong.
Prudence in these times is cru
cial. President Carter must he
wise and strong and careful. The
point is todeterwar, not tocause
it. Rut at this point we can only
trust the president and help him
as we can. Contrary to what Pro
lessor Bernstein says, through
resistance we only endanger our
selves and others.
112 inally, to resist the draft
when it is necessary is simply
elitist. We all have a stake in our
nation's existence, and we
should all do our part — not just
force it on those without any job
alternatives. Women, too, can
serve. They can do many support
and combat jobs equally with
men.
It is good to see the students
here concerned again. But it is
disturbing to think that this con
cern goes only as far as their own
narrow self-interest. It is even
more disturbing to think that the
leaders of the rallies can play on
this narrowness successfully.
