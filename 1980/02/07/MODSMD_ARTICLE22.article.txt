Imitate Sakharov
Most people in the United
States agree it is wrong to im
prison Sakharov, orany man, tor
Ins beliefs. And nobody really
wants to go fight any wars.
But a eontliet occurs when one
realizes the Soviet Union flag
rantly violates human rights
from religion to free speech.
Only when a cause celebre oc
curs do we question the Soviet
actions. We see that a red "Big
Brother" does not like people to
speak out, especially when it de
nounces their government.
Sakharov has essentially died
for his beliefs. In the United
States people have de
monstrated against his impris
onment. and undoubtedly many
of the same people rally against
the draft. There are hundreds of
"Sakharovs" in Afghanistan,
some suffer the same fate, others
are executed.
f he people of Russia live in
chains and it is naive to think
they will be freed by peaceful
demonstrations. We admire a

man who risked his life for his
beliefs, yet some say they would
not fight if the Soviets moved to
overtake the Middle Hast. If we
say we would not fight, yet claim
to be for human rights, we arc
hypocrites. II nobody in the Un
ited States would fight, we would
live in chains.
Think of what we have, and
why we have it. I.et us hope for
the courage Sakharov had, and
think ol the freedom we take for
granted. If drafted, I would go.

Sakharov in jeopardy
Andrei Sakharov is the flicker
ing flame of truth against the
hurricane winds ol systemic lies.
I lis life now is in jeopardy; we
must be one with this courageous
man. For he is, in the deepest
sense, our comrade.
