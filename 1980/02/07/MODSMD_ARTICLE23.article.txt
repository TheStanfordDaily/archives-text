## Beware of macho politics 
### 
President Jimmy Carter brought some new faces
to Washington, but U.S. foreign and military
policies are run by the same old crowd. I he lolks
that gave us Vietnam and gave the Somoza
dynasty to the Nicaraguans. the shah to the
Iranians, Pinochet to the C hileans.
Now they are preparing to edge us closer to
World War 111 I hey want their pawns to get
ready: they want you people to register lor a new
draft, just in case.
And that is not all. President Carter has an
nounced his readiness to use military lorce against
"any attempt by any outside force togain control ol
the Persian (iulf region."
Meanwhile, those great strategic minds in
Washington are now going to try to bolster (iencral
Zia's hated regime in Pakistan with huge shipments
of arms. Perhaps you will soon be asked to go over
there and help /ia keep his people in line.
But the lolks in Washington don't want you to
think about that, lust rally around the flag, please.
Remember the hostages, and don't ask any ques
tions about our foreign policy. Above all. don't
debate the draft; instead, debate whether women,
too, should he drafted!
American presidential election years are becom
ing more and more dangerous for all ol mankind.
Macho politics are at a premium.
With Ins Mr. Nice Ciuy image. President Carter
had been doing badly in the polls, until the ay atol
lah came and rescued him. Domestically, the two
appear to have profited equally from the prot
racted hostage situation.
Then came the Soviet military invasion ol Af
ghanistan. at the invitation til the shaky Soviet
supported regime. Washington's pent-up fury over
the Tehran situation could now be given tree vent
against the USSR. Americananti-SAI I sentiment
could now be appeased by the new Mr. Carter: and

the dream of peace, and the hopes for a de
escalating arms race, could be thrown out of the
window.
That President Carter's new macho-politics
could destroy the Olympic games as a festival of
peace is unfortunate; while he may not succeed,
they are expendable.
Par more serious is his apparent readiness to
place SAI I II on ice indefinitely, and to accelerate
the arms race even beyond all the frightening mea
sures he announced last year. — including over 500
nuclear intermediate-range missiles to he installed
in Western I urope, and the new giant MX lirst
stlike long-range missile systems in North
America.
II we avoid a wider war until past the presidential
elections, w ill cooler heads come to prevail? Or will
we. and more particularly von, be bogged down in
another war in Asia? Or will some irresponsible
jingo even find his way to one ol the many nuclear
triggers, and do all ol us in?
Much could depend 011 what American students
do, or fail to do, in the months and years ahead.
In the 00s. students were in the forefront ol
resisting the American crimes in Indochina. Presi
dent Johnson conceded that the unrest in the uni
\ ersities had much to do with his decision not to run
again, and to seek to negotiate lor peace in Viet
nam.
Will the new generation ol students wake upand
organize a movement to resist the new draft regist
ration before some of you will find yourselves kil
ling and being killed, for 110 good reason, in Iran, or
Pakistan or Saudi Arabia?
Or do you prefer to debate whether or not wo
men. too, should be drafted?
