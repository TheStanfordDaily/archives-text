# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mark Breier Letters question events here 
### 
I've been having a heyday answering my per
sonal mail recently.
It all began about a week ago when there was a
sudden and dramatic increase in the number ol
letters I was getting. Though initially overjoyed. I
was bothered by a sense ol i/eja vti as I ripped open
each envelope
bach time, a newspaper clipping would spill out
containing an AP photo and some inevitably off
base comments about a large Stanford rally at
which a draft caul facsimile was burned.
Now I love hearing from friends, but their com
ments and questions have kept me in hysterics
outside my P.O. box. My brother, a miner in Col
orado. sends a clipping from the Denver Post and
writes that 600 miners are ready to come out to
sunny California and "beat some l&/!? heads
in." My mom asks whether California is safe with
all these tremors, and Dad. succinct as anyone,
sends a clipping from the Washington Star, com
menting only, "Mark, what's this?"
I'm honestly not sure. I write back, but I do know
that il is not what they may be thinking from their
questions.
"Have the students abandoned academics and
taken over University buildings?" they anxiously
ask. Now. off-hand, it's tough to think ol any build
ings under any type ol siege around here, but I
I inally decide that Meyer I .ibrary might qualify as a
general siege, and so I answer in the affirmative.
"Well, what about your campus radio station?
Has it been stormed and taken over by crazies?"
Again. I pause, knowing lull well that the answer is
yes. but that it must have happened long ago be
cause K/SIJ has always been that way. Pressed for
an answer, though, I respond with another "yes."
"How about police/student confrontations . . .
are police parading around campus in armored

personnel carriers?" my melodramatic Iriends ask.
Now, I know for sure that I haven't seen any ar
mored personnel carriers out and about, and so I
decide to end all these ridiculous misconceptions. I
humor them and say the only thing unusual that I
have noticed on campus is a concentration of heavy
construction machinery staunchly positioned in
White Plaza.
"Research it and get back to me," some have
already written back.
Of course you can see why people might jump to
conclusions. My phone rang off the hook yester
day: "Aren't University officials resigning? Enfor
cers being brought it?" they asked. When I paused,
they determinedly pursued the question. "Look,
your president, your union director and your foot
ball coach are all leaving and the latter position
has already been filled by a guy who looks like a
Marine."
It's no use arguing. My most sane discussions
ultimately lead to the question of whether students
are ready for a major confrontation. Lor the life of
me. all I can ever think ol is tail til last year and
memories ol students sneaking booze past stadium
SWAT teams in every conceivable way. I always
answer "yes."
In anticipation of future newspaper clippings
and questions. I've finally developed a pat re
sponse to all inquiries.
" 1 ook," I say," I think that the majority of Stan
lord students are attentive to national affairs but
are still waiting for someone to label the decade.
I he '60s were 'activist.' the '70s were the
'me' decade, and the 'NOs word hasn't gotten
out yet. I hear it will be out by November.
Check back with me then."
