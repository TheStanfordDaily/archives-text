## Boycott the political games 
### 
As a result of being in Britain
this winter, I've developed a
more objective viewpoint from
which to analyze American
foreign policy. Listening in on
debates in the House of Com
mons, watching news and com
mentaries by the British Broad
casting Corp. and reading the
Guardian gives one a different
perspective on the United States.
I was watching David Frost in
terview various politicians,
athletes and Olympicofficials —
from both the U.S. and the Un
ited Kingdom — on the "tely"

about their views concerning
President Carter's recent state
ment that "with Soviet invading
forces in Afghanistan, neither
the American people nor I will
support sending an Olympic
team to Moscow" and was rather
surprised.
The U.S. athletes interviewed
did in fact express their desire to
comply with Carter's statement.
But the British athletes — al
though old Maggie might not
want them to — are definitely
going to Moscow and are quite
enthusiastic about it. "Gonna
knock their blooming blocks off
in the Games" was the general
attitude. You see, the British
at least the athletes and officials
involved with the Games — feel
very strongly that individuals
should not be used for political
ends.
The athletes, like the hostages
in Iran, should be treated as ends
in themselves, and not used as
coercive means. What's going on
in Afghanistan, to be sure, is
worrisome. But it is not as
world-threatening, I think, as
some would have us believe.
In Friday's International
Herald Tribune, an American
paper published in Paris, there
appeared an article that really
made me jump. "Carter is pre
pared to use military force to
protect U.S. 'vital interests' in
the Gulf and he called for the
resumption of registration for
the military draft."
With no prospect ol exemp
tions for students this time
around, here I am between the

ages ot IS and 26. And I had
thought that selective service
had ended. I just missed the Vie
tnam War and figured there was
no way in the world that they
could get away with conscription
again (remember the 13th
Amendment? — Neither slavery
nor involuntary servitude, ex
cept as punishment tor a crime
. . . shall exist within the United
States), at least not so soon!
I can't feel the strong
nationalism that is apparently
arising now hack in the States, ljf
scares me — the lesson of Viet
nam has passed too quickly. Are
we really ready once again to be
come embroiled in a war in some
obscure place hallway across the
world? I can't believe it.
The Russian intervention in
Afghanistan isn't a direct threat
to us. But a government satu
rated with hypocrisy, willing to
use its own citizens as means to
some ill-defined political end, is.
Why should a long struggling,
determined and hard-training
athlete give up the chance of his
or her lifetime for some politi
cian who seeks an Olympic
boycott as a means or excuse to
unite the country behind him be
fore the next election?
I say, let the athletes play in
the games they've worked so
hard towards: let us boycott the
games the politicians have
worked so hard towards: Af
ghanistan, conscription and
Apocalypse Now.
