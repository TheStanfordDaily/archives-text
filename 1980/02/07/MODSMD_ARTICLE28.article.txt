Prediction I valuation Council, meeting for the
liist time, has decided against making any forecast
ol an impending tremor for Southern ( alifornin or
the Ciull ol Alaska.
On Tuesday, the filial dav ol a two-day confer
ence at the headquarters ol the I S. Geological
Suivey in Keston. \ a., the I 2-niaii council listened
as two sciL'iitists summarized all of the changes and
oddities that have been observed during the past
few years in Southern California and Alaska.
These changes in the earth's crust liav e attracted
the attention ol scientists and caused some concern
because they might be premonitory of destruc
tively large earthquakes.
C. Ban) Raleigh, a I'll.I), in geopln sics and the
prediction program coordinator at the Geological
Survey's Office ol l arthquake Studies m Menlo
Park, described the Southern California situation.
Raleigh, also a member of the recently formed
council, noted the phenomena that have been li.ip

I he easing of eompressional stresses across
the San Andreas limit near Palmdalc. Calif., and
the appearance instead ol extension.il strain over
the last IS months. The land masses on opposite
sides ol the fault are now pressing against each
other in an angled, northeast-southwest, direction
The flow of radon, a short-lived radioactive
gas. has increased sharply in several wells since

reported that unusual radon outpourings ha\ e pre
ceded some shocks 111 their countries.
The number of earthquakes greater than
magnitude 3 on the Richter Scale jumped mar
kedly during IO7N and I here were twice as
many aftershocks alter three earthquakes of mag
nitude 5 than any other comparably-si/ed major
earthquakes of the last 35 years.

California have been rising, even through the
summer months when normally they drop.
