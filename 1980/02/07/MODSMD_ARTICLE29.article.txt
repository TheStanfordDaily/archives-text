# Honor Code violations result in suspensions
## 
### My Jeff Barmeyer Staff Writer 
Dear Dean I.yons,
I concur with your recom
mended penalty 01 the llonor
COdc case involving John Doc,
which is that he he suspended
from Stanford University for one
(/uarter.
I'leuse take the steps necessary
to implement this decision.
Sincerely.
Richard W. I.yman
lor eight undergraduates
found guilty of cheating last year,
the Honor Code became more
than words on a bluehook. The
I lonor'Code and the judicial sys
tem that tried them suspended
six o! them from school and gave
two work penalties.
Between 11>72l l >72 and I97 1 ). the
University charged I 2N students
with I lonor C 'ode or fundamen
tal Standard violations, an aver
age of about l<S annually. Most
of the cases involved cheating in
fractions such as plagiarizing,
copying oil another student's
in-class exam, collaborating on a
take home test, submitting an
exam taken by another student,
altering a returned exam and re

questing that it be regraded and
duplicating someone else's com
puter program.
Sanctions
I Established precedent is to
pcnali/e llonoi Code violators
with a one-quarter suspension
and loss of creel it in the course.
This may be accompanied by a
formal reprimand and probated
expulsion. II there are mitigating
circumstances in the ease, work
penalties are sometimes imposed
along with suspended suspen
sions.
"Additional work aggravates
the pressures lelt by already har
ried students, but suspension iso
lates the students from the stres
ses ol university life and at least
encourages reflection and
growth." wrote a former Stan
lord Judicial Council, a group ol
students and faculty members
before whom a violator can pre
sent his case.
According to President
Richard I y man. "the deterrence
value ol a severe and certain
penalty is crucial."
Penalty grading
Although a provision in the
Honor Code stipulates that in
structors may sidestep the judi
cial process and impose
academic penalties with a stu
dent's consent, such behavior is
rarely approved by the administ
ration.
According to James Lyons,
dean ol student allairs. such a
situation between a faculty
member and a student docs not
constitute "a free and open rela
tionship.
" I .el's assume that the student
might be innocent or think that
she is innocent. Who. in the face
of suspension, is going to argue
that?
"(irades cannot and should
not be used as penalties. C irades
ought to be used as a means to
evaluate scholarship. You don't
want to give someone a C 111 L.n
glish because they have bad
eharactei since they submitted
someone else s work as their
own." he continued.

Offenders customarily receive
no credit in the course 111 which
they eheuted.
"Cheating in one part of a
course immediately raises ques
tions about the veracity ol other
work presented in the same
course." Lyons said. "The fa
culty member lias to ask Can I
believe that student's scholar
ship?' Moth student and (acuity
member often prefer to put such
suspicion and mistrust aside by
wiping the slate clean."
Formal procedure
Often the judicial process be
gins when a student observes
cheating firsthand and reports
the incident to a faculty member,
an action the student may
take to comply wllll the Honor
Code. The instructor, then, tries
t.> determine il cheating did oc
cur. perhaps by comparing
exams. He might seek advice
from the Presi'i :nt s on ice or
issue a formal complaint.
"The President's Office, and
specifically one or two ol the
lawyers there, will look at the
complaint and make a decision
on whether there is pretty good
evidence that something hap
pened. and secondly, if the evi
dence poi nts to some sort of v 10-
lation," said I yons.
"II there is a complaint and it
seems to have merit, the presi
dent's office will then formally
charge tl.c student. There will be
a memorandum to me which lavs
out the charges. I will then de
liver this to the student along
with an offer to help in the sense
of providing counsel to clarify
the judicial system." he said.
At this time the student is ol-
Icred counsel, usually a law stu
dent. lie then must decide
whether to present his case be
fore the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil (SJC) or I yons. The Judicial
Charter entitles a student to a
hearing before the SJC il he so
desires. The dean, however, is
not required to hear the case.
II the accused student disag
rees with the allegations, a pro
ceeding is scheduled before a

hearing ollicer chosen from out
side the University who makes a
tietei initiation ol lads and occa
sionally a preliminary determi
nation ol guilt or innocence.
( ascs involv ing a hearing ollicer
are always heard In the S.IC.
which ultimately decides the
question ol guilt and recom
mends a penalty.
Mitigation
"One ol the hettci tests that I
use is v\ lie the r or not the students
found themselves m a situation
not ol their own doing ovei
which they had little control and
in which people would not

lor eight undergraduates
found guilty of cheating last year,
the Honor Code became more
than words on a bluehook. The
I lonor'Code and the judicial sys
tem that tried them suspended
six o! them from school and gave
two work penalties.
Between 11>72l l >72 and I97 1 ). the
University charged I 2N students
with I lonor C 'ode or fundamen
tal Standard violations, an aver
age of about l<S annually. Most
of the cases involved cheating in
fractions such as plagiarizing,
copying oil another student's
in-class exam, collaborating on a
take home test, submitting an
exam taken by another student,
altering a returned exam and re

questing that it be regraded and
duplicating someone else's com
puter program.
Sanctions
I Established precedent is to
pcnali/e llonoi Code violators
with a one-quarter suspension
and loss of creel it in the course.
This may be accompanied by a
formal reprimand and probated
expulsion. II there are mitigating
circumstances in the ease, work
penalties are sometimes imposed
along with suspended suspen
sions.
"Additional work aggravates
the pressures lelt by already har
ried students, but suspension iso
lates the students from the stres
ses ol university life and at least
encourages reflection and
growth." wrote a former Stan
lord Judicial Council, a group ol
students and faculty members
before whom a violator can pre
sent his case.
According to President
Richard I y man. "the deterrence
value ol a severe and certain
penalty is crucial."
Penalty grading
Although a provision in the
Honor Code stipulates that in
structors may sidestep the judi
cial process and impose
academic penalties with a stu
dent's consent, such behavior is
rarely approved by the administ
ration.
According to James Lyons,
dean ol student allairs. such a
situation between a faculty
member and a student docs not
constitute "a free and open rela
tionship.
" I .el's assume that the student
might be innocent or think that
she is innocent. Who. in the face
of suspension, is going to argue
that?
"(irades cannot and should
not be used as penalties. C irades
ought to be used as a means to
evaluate scholarship. You don't
want to give someone a C 111 L.n
glish because they have bad
eharactei since they submitted
someone else s work as their
own." he continued.

Offenders customarily receive
no credit in the course 111 which
they eheuted.
"Cheating in one part of a
course immediately raises ques
tions about the veracity ol other
work presented in the same
course." Lyons said. "The fa
culty member lias to ask Can I
believe that student's scholar
ship?' Moth student and (acuity
member often prefer to put such
suspicion and mistrust aside by
wiping the slate clean."
Formal procedure
Often the judicial process be
gins when a student observes
cheating firsthand and reports
the incident to a faculty member,
an action the student may
take to comply wllll the Honor
Code. The instructor, then, tries
t.> determine il cheating did oc
cur. perhaps by comparing
exams. He might seek advice
from the Presi'i :nt s on ice or
issue a formal complaint.
"The President's Office, and
specifically one or two ol the
lawyers there, will look at the
complaint and make a decision
on whether there is pretty good
evidence that something hap
pened. and secondly, if the evi
dence poi nts to some sort of v 10-
lation," said I yons.
"II there is a complaint and it
seems to have merit, the presi
dent's office will then formally
charge tl.c student. There will be
a memorandum to me which lavs
out the charges. I will then de
liver this to the student along
with an offer to help in the sense
of providing counsel to clarify
the judicial system." he said.
At this time the student is ol-
Icred counsel, usually a law stu
dent. lie then must decide
whether to present his case be
fore the Stanford Judicial Coun
cil (SJC) or I yons. The Judicial
Charter entitles a student to a
hearing before the SJC il he so
desires. The dean, however, is
not required to hear the case.
II the accused student disag
rees with the allegations, a pro
ceeding is scheduled before a

hearing ollicer chosen from out
