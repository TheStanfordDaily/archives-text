# University parking fines raised to $5
## 
### Karen Wada Staff Writer 
Campus parking fines are going up
and traffic officers hope to start crack
ing down.
Effective immediately, parking tic
kets issued here will cost $5, instead ot
$2.
F or years. University officials have
requested such action because, they
said, the $2 fine was too small to deter
violators.
The increase finally was approved by
local judges Tuesday, partly because of
last year's consolidation of the Santa
Clara County court system.
"For many years, the county parking
fine was $5. but Stanford's was $2 by
agreement of local judges." said Phyllis
Anderson, county-court traffic super
visor.
"When the courts consolidated in

July, they thought the bail schedule
should be made uniform throughout
the county."
Local judges approved the fine in
crease at their first post-consolidation
bail review this week.
The stiffer penalty should cut down
new violations and reduce the ticket
backlog at the county clerk's office,
said Marv in Herrington, director of the
University department of public safety.
"It's almost a sure thing that a vio
lator will be ticketed," he said. Before
the $5 fine, though, "People didn't
care. They would throw away the tic
kets or save them up. The risk was
worth it."
Once processing speeds up, "It's al
most a sure thing that they'll have to
pay . . . the impact will be much grea
ter."
Herrington said his department is

sues about 50,000 parking citations
each year. The county court cannot
handle that volume, he said. "Just im
agine, 50.000 from us alone, not count
ing Palo Alto or Mountain View."
A court personnel shortage has so
worsened the problem, that the city of
Palo Alto has hired a clerk to handle its
citations at the county office.
"We've resisted the idea of paying
someone to do that for us." Herrington
said, partly because ticket revenue goes
entirely to the county. As a private in
stitution. the University is not eligible
for a settlement such as UC-
Bcrkeley's, in which the school re
ceives 50 percent of ticket funds.
Campus constructions and remodel
ing have decreased parking spaces,
especially "at the core," Herrington
admitted. "In the last five years, we've
lost 2000 to 3000 places."

But. he added. University planners
had anticipated such conditions and
overbuilt parking lots. "We're about
even now â€” or at least we should be."
California drivers who do not pay
parking tickets have the tines placed on
their master records in Sacramento.
They cannot renew their license with
out paying the accumulated lines, plus
6 percent interest.
Out-of-state drivers are less vulner
able, Herrington said, because other
states have different methods ol traffic
regulation.
But the University can tow the car of
an out-of-state driver with five out
standing tickets.
Drivers are given I 1 days to pay a
ticket. Then, they receive a letterwhich
doubles the bail. If this goes un
answered, a warrant is issued.
