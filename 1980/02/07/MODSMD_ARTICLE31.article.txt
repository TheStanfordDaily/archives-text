Tfic cast nt The Silver lawn'
rehearses every night and
weekend. Some would say
thejfre crazy.
But. "The Silver Tassie is an
incredibly good play." explained
Erirt Dignam. who has one of the
leading roles. "Its war theme has
bec&me increasingly important
recently, with the Afghanistan
crisis and the draft issue. The im
plications ot having your youth
robbed and your dreams post
poned are really potent."
Sot new to the stage. Erin
trained and performed with the
New York City Ballet until an
injured knee "aborted" her
carder at age 1 S.
s(ic describes performing as
"tof.il dedication and sublima
tion." Many ot her friends who
dance are unhappy, she said.
"It'J such a difficult life. You
a re At paid enough to live on.
Als«. to be a dancer, you have to
be underweight and that affects
your mind."
Yet. Erin said, she'snevergot
ten'over leaving ballet and. al
though she feels old. she may go
back.
"Acting does a lot ol what
dancing used to do for me." she
said. "I can't believe how chal
lenging it is intellectually to get
inside of another personality."
J on Landa, who plays the hero
Harry, shares Dignam'.s en
thusiasm. "I like to act. but I
dojn't know anybody who'd pay
me to act. Although I'd rather do
well at acting than anything else.
I try to keep the academics up."
Behind a casual facade. Landa
is serious about pursuing a thea
ter career. He's been interested
in acting since he was 5 or 6. he
saw.l.
Besides traminu here with

Sheila Weber and Pat Ryan.
Landa spent a summer studying
acting at the Royal Academy ol
Dramatic Art in London.
He said he has learned a lot
from Silver Tassie director
Miriam Yahil-Wav "She knows
what an actor needs to hear. She
knows when to leave an actor
alone and when to take control."
His part, as well, has taught
him a lot. he said. "It's difficult
tor me. because my experiences
don't relate to Harry." a soccer
hero who is crippled in the war.
"I don't know what manual
labor, living in a slum and going
to war are like. I have to use
psychological experiences, not
just actual experiences, to un
derstand my character."
Brad Carpenter has similar
problems. His character is blind
and "trying to look blind while
actually being able to see is dif
ficult. I've found it helpful to
focus with my ears. It's almost
like daydreaming. What my eyes
see doesn't register and I get that
blind stare."
Because his character is blind,
"his images are especially v iv id."
Carpenter said. "He can vis
ualize things better than people
can sec them."

Like the rest ot the cast Brad
said. "The idea of people going
to war without questioning it is
really relevant." He praised
O Casey's skill in "making you
laugh, then cry. then laugh
again" and calls the play "a mas
sive catharsis."
Vibrant and enthusiastic, the
sophomore plans to pursue a
theater career, probably on the
West Coast. A drama and com
munication major, he said he
hopes to study this summer at
AC I and. later, get into a
graduate program in drama.
I lav ing performed in Gaieties,
Major Barbara and India Sony• at
Stanford. Carpenter has acted
since lie was 14. Only last year,
though, he discovered ja/z danc
ing. I le studies dance with Berle
Davis in Foster City and takes
classes here with The Ja// Core
and with Juan Valen/uela.
Playing the part of Brad's wife
in the play. Li/ Rossi has an
equally active interest in profes

sional theater. She said she is ap
plying to graduate programs in
the East.
"After working as an actress,"
she said, "I'd like to explore the
conceptual side of the business."
Rossi, who has costumed a number
nl local productions, including
West Bay Opera's Don f'as
qnale. said "Costume design
would be an obvious way I could
go."
She seems to like the plav as
much as everyone else. One of
the reasons she likes it. she said,
is because it has no lead. "It's
about all ol the eight or nine
people. Every character has a
specific and interesting line of
development."
Also, she explained.
"Everyone 111 the play is inno
cent. None of the characters has
wickedness in Ins soul. In a way.
they're almost childlike."
Darrell Duffic. who plays
Harry's neighbor, agreed that
"All the characters are moved by

events beyond their control. My
character especially is pushed
along by circumstances."
He claimed that, in most plays,
he's played the part of'"the foil."
Yet. he explains, that "While
Barney (his character) is the foil
in this play, he shows the leading
character's faults, not only his
good points."
Although Dulfie has per
formed in many shows and plans
to continue acting, he said he
feels he can accomplish more
outside of theater. A graduate of
the University of New
Brunswick in Canada, he is now
a doctoral candidate here in
engineering-economic systems.
Echoing the sentiments of his
fellow cast members, he praised
O'Casey's writing which, he said,
is poetry, not drama, and
Yahil-Wax's direction, which, he
said, has "infected the cast with a
positive attitude."
No. they're not cra/y.
