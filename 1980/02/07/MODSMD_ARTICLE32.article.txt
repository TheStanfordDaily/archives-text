# Director Miriam Yahil-Wax
## Exploring a grim proximity

"We talk about the glory of
war. the hero returning home . . .
Harry refuses to be that hero
in-a-wheelchair." At a dance, lie
wheels alter his old girlfriend
and her new lover: "We find that
pathetic: but Harry's behavior is

is warped — his refusal to be the
wounded hero is all right. The
other view is false social moral
its."

As an Israeli, Miriam Yahil-
Wax has learned to live with war
and "life and death" polities. As
a director, she has explored this
grim proximity in the Drama
Department's production ol
O'Casey's The Silver lassie.
The iy2Npla\ is a multi-edged
treatment of war and its effects
on a town sport, his family and
neighbors. Yahil-Wax has ex
panded this \iew of a plagued
Irish society into associations
with Israel's troubled history,
and with a world which fights he
cause it sees no alternative —
"And that is the real tragedy."
But. "that is the nature of
man, and it's not all his fault,"
Yahil-Wax explained. O'Casey
is careful not to blame anyone
entirely. Nonetheless, the playw
right does indict elements of soc
iety : the church, the country and
its politicians, the rich, but also
the poor. Rarely can one unravel
one's self from what seems to be
the deterministic circumstances
that trap all people but which af
fect the poor most immediately
and deeply.
Yahil-Wax noted that all the
officers in the play are British.
And indeed, the nattily
uniformed messenger from
headquarters who enters and
exits in Act II obviously has
neither seen nor experienced the

horror of the war that his
superiors direct from the rear.
O'Casey focuses on the pi iizht
ol the poor because they have
the fewest choices. Only they
must choose between starvation
and morality. And so in order to
get along in this world — to sur
\ive — "these charming, ignor
ant people must evade reality.
It's always somebody else's
fault" (that war exists, that
people sulfer and die from the
atrocity that is its very exis
tence). "It's always somebody
else's fault. 'We have to go to
war," they say."
O'Casey tried to push people
into seeing alternatives. Yahil-
Wax said. "He shows faults
without condemning, and says
correct them.... He hopes to
educate people to see ways out."
Such frankness elevates The
Silver Tussie from sentimen
talized anti-war message to
stark, poetic drama.
"A lot of it comes out in the
theater. It you read it. it's very
depressing. But in a theater, the
hero becomes stronger. The
life-affirming attitude of
O'Casey comes through."
The play's power lies in decep
tive beauty: "You don't realize
what he's doing as you watch;
but you feel it — terrible things
(social acceptance of war. "con
science money" rehabilitation of
veterans) are shown.
"Terrible things, but he shows
them in the sheer beauty of the
theater. He wants to state some
thing but he must do it in a beaut
iful way. That's artistic limita
tion. II he presented it terribly,
people would run out."
In The Silver Tussie,
Yahil-Wax finds a strange music.
" tc m pe ra me nt a I poe try"
wrought out of everyday Irish.
"Even the illiterate use this
magnificent language. The Irish
have a visual imagination, sen
sual almost."
This language is difficult for

young American actors, many of
whom are trained in The
Method, Yahil-Wax said. "Dur
ing auditions I tried to pick out
these things. ... It's hard.
People here are so structured."
She said they lack the ability to
make this "transposition of
language" without losing it into
prose.
Her cast's progress has
pleased and surprised her, espe
cially in the traditionally difficult
second act. Her reading of the
play differs from most critics,
who see The Silver lassie as
three realistic acts and one glar
ingly expressionistic one.
"I see the whole thing as poe
tic. and the second act as overtly
so. Hut to me, the first act leads
to the second. There is a break in
the story, true, but not in the
style.
"That second act is gorgeous,
and it's working, too. It has
music, a strong group quality
which has developed (for us) in
real life."
Group theater intrigues
Yahil-Wax and after she earns
her doctoral degree here she
hopes to work on such projects,
especially with Joseph Chaikin,
the noted director and a close
friend.
Yahil-Wax said she was lucky
to meet Chaikin and other
English-speaking directors when
they brought summer schools to
Israel.
"I was in theater there from a
very early age," she said. "That's
where I developed my lan
guages." She has earned an act
ing degree and a BA and an MA
in English literature and
philosophy. "The theater de
partment where I was (the Uni
versity of Tel Aviv) was just
starting, starting from scratch. I
didn't need that."
Besides. "I wanted from
drama more and more of the
literary, so I took English. But all
my big work has been around
drama, and poetry." She has
published a book of poems in Is
rael.
Both she and her husband
have served in the Israeli army.
"I have gone through several
wars myself — it's so shocking to
come here and see so many
people who do not understand
what that means, who think Vie
tnam is some kind of science fic
tion."
Because of this, and because
of the play's special power,
Yahil-Wax is directing The Silver
Tossie.
" It's a difficult work to do, and
to see. If O'Casey had done
things a little differently, we
would feel more at ease. But he
doesn't want us at ease, because
he is not at ease."

"We talk about the glory of
war. the hero returning home . . .
Harry refuses to be that hero
in-a-wheelchair." At a dance, lie
wheels alter his old girlfriend
and her new lover: "We find that
pathetic: but Harry's behavior is
normal. Our interpretation of it
is warped — his refusal to be the
wounded hero is all right. The
other view is false social moral
its."

As an Israeli, Miriam Yahil-
Wax has learned to live with war
and "life and death" polities. As
a director, she has explored this
grim proximity in the Drama
Department's production ol
O'Casey's The Silver lassie.
The iy2Npla\ is a multi-edged
treatment of war and its effects
on a town sport, his family and
neighbors. Yahil-Wax has ex
panded this \iew of a plagued
Irish society into associations
with Israel's troubled history,
and with a world which fights he
cause it sees no alternative —
"And that is the real tragedy."
But. "that is the nature of
man, and it's not all his fault,"
Yahil-Wax explained. O'Casey
is careful not to blame anyone
entirely. Nonetheless, the playw
right does indict elements of soc
iety : the church, the country and
its politicians, the rich, but also
the poor. Rarely can one unravel
one's self from what seems to be
the deterministic circumstances
that trap all people but which af
fect the poor most immediately
and deeply.
Yahil-Wax noted that all the
officers in the play are British.
And indeed, the nattily
uniformed messenger from
headquarters who enters and
exits in Act II obviously has
neither seen nor experienced the

horror of the war that his
superiors direct from the rear.
O'Casey focuses on the pi iizht
ol the poor because they have
the fewest choices. Only they
must choose between starvation
and morality. And so in order to
get along in this world — to sur
\ive — "these charming, ignor
ant people must evade reality.
It's always somebody else's
fault" (that war exists, that
people sulfer and die from the
atrocity that is its very exis
tence). "It's always somebody
else's fault. 'We have to go to
war," they say."
O'Casey tried to push people
into seeing alternatives. Yahil-
Wax said. "He shows faults
without condemning, and says
correct them.... He hopes to
educate people to see ways out."
Such frankness elevates The
Silver Tussie from sentimen
talized anti-war message to
stark, poetic drama.
"A lot of it comes out in the
theater. It you read it. it's very
depressing. But in a theater, the
hero becomes stronger. The
life-affirming attitude of
O'Casey comes through."
The play's power lies in decep
tive beauty: "You don't realize
what he's doing as you watch;
but you feel it — terrible things
(social acceptance of war. "con
science money" rehabilitation of
veterans) are shown.
"Terrible things, but he shows
them in the sheer beauty of the
theater. He wants to state some
thing but he must do it in a beaut
iful way. That's artistic limita
tion. II he presented it terribly,
people would run out."
In The Silver Tussie,
Yahil-Wax finds a strange music.
" tc m pe ra me nt a I poe try"
wrought out of everyday Irish.
"Even the illiterate use this
magnificent language. The Irish
have a visual imagination, sen
sual almost."
This language is difficult for

young American actors, many of
whom are trained in The
Method, Yahil-Wax said. "Dur
ing auditions I tried to pick out
these things. ... It's hard.
People here are so structured."
She said they lack the ability to
make this "transposition of
language" without losing it into
prose.
Her cast's progress has
pleased and surprised her, espe
cially in the traditionally difficult
second act. Her reading of the
play differs from most critics,
who see The Silver lassie as
three realistic acts and one glar
ingly expressionistic one.
"I see the whole thing as poe
tic. and the second act as overtly
so. Hut to me, the first act leads
to the second. There is a break in
the story, true, but not in the
style.
"That second act is gorgeous,
and it's working, too. It has
music, a strong group quality
which has developed (for us) in
real life."
Group theater intrigues
Yahil-Wax and after she earns
her doctoral degree here she
hopes to work on such projects,
especially with Joseph Chaikin,
the noted director and a close
friend.
Yahil-Wax said she was lucky
to meet Chaikin and other
English-speaking directors when
they brought summer schools to
Israel.
"I was in theater there from a
very early age," she said. "That's
where I developed my lan
guages." She has earned an act
ing degree and a BA and an MA
in English literature and
philosophy. "The theater de
partment where I was (the Uni
versity of Tel Aviv) was just
starting, starting from scratch. I
didn't need that."
Besides. "I wanted from
drama more and more of the
literary, so I took English. But all
my big work has been around
drama, and poetry." She has
published a book of poems in Is
rael.
Both she and her husband
have served in the Israeli army.
"I have gone through several
wars myself — it's so shocking to
come here and see so many
people who do not understand
what that means, who think Vie
tnam is some kind of science fic
tion."
Because of this, and because
of the play's special power,
Yahil-Wax is directing The Silver
Tossie.
" It's a difficult work to do, and
to see. If O'Casey had done
things a little differently, we
would feel more at ease. But he
doesn't want us at ease, because
he is not at ease."
