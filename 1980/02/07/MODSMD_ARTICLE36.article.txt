"Pippin emerges as an idealist,
searching for fulfillment," said

brother of Pippin, who is willing
to let his mother knock Pippin
out of line for the throne.
Dawn Atkinson will play

grandmother Bertha, a teisty
lady whose idea of enlighten
ment leads Pippin to a brothel.
But. the prince survives this
night out, and others spent at
war, Dii drugs and in love, ending
up as he admits, "trapped hut
happy which isn't had tor the end
ot a musical comedy."
The show is directed hy Jodi
Corwin and produced by Scott
Buchanan, with musical director
Claire Kelm and choreographer
Eric Hoit. Designers are Scooter
