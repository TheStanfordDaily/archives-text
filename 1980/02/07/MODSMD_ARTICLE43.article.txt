Congressional indictments seen
WASHINGTON — The Justice Department ex
pects criminal indictments in 90 days in the corrup
tion scandal that implicates at least eight members ol
Congress and reportedly has spread to high levels ol
the New Jersey state government.
Chagrined by press disclosures til the I HI investi
gation. Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti asked
Congress yesterday not to conduct separate inquiries
that might jeopardize federal prosecutions.
If Congress persists, Civiletti said, "a number ol
guilty individuals may go unprosecuted or un
punished."
Federal prosecutors have already started issuing
grand jury subpoenas in Washington and other cities
for a wide range of financial records. The subpoenas
are evidently designed to trace the funds that were
paid out during the FBI "sting" operation and find
what the money was used for.
In addition, it was learned that prosecutors are
encountering problems in putting together admissi
ble segments of FBI videotapes concerning some ol
the targets, reportedly because til loose statements
and leading questions by some ot the undercover
agents assigned to the investigation.
On Capitol Hill, there was a strong feeling among
both House and Senate members that a cloud had
been cast over Congress in the past week and that the
government shouldn't expect them to just sit around
and wait lor the courts to act as the elections draw
closer.
Acting Senate Minority leader Ted Stevens (R-
Alaska) said he is especially concerned about the fact
that some of the gov ernment'scases are apparently so
weak that the Justice Department won't be able to
prosecute them unless more evidence comes to light.

nate Commerce Committee, did legislative favors tor

real estate transaction, a source familiar with the
inquiry said yesterday.

ask Congress for authority to require young women
to register lor the draft, the former chief of naval
operations told a Virginia legislative committee yes
terday .

Virginia senate candidate, told members of a commit
tee considering the Equal Righ's Amendment that
the president told him of his plans at a White House
meeting last week.
In Washington. White House press secretary Jody
Powell said the president has told no one of his deci
sion on the women's issue. He said the admiral was
part of a group that met with Carter to discuss several
aspects ol the draft question. "The president did not
state at that time w hat he intends to do." Powell said.
The president, returning from Camp David, told
reporters Sunday that he had made up his mind on the
question ol including women in draft registration.

yesterday that it Carter has reached a decision "he
hasn't told me."

Reliance on foreign oil attacked
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — The United States is be
coming increasingly dependent on "hostile oil" from
countries in the Mideast and Africa antagonistic to
ward the West, two Harvard University energy ex
perts warned yesterday.
In an article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs
magazine. Robert Stobaugh and Daniel Yergin also
condemned domestic oil and natural gas price con
trols as "a great disservice" that encourage consump

tion. They recommended conservation measures to
achieve a no-growth U.S. energy policy for the 1980s.
"Our whole industrial sy stem is like a vehicle built
to operate on $3 (a barrel) oil, puffing along with an
inefficient engine and a body leaking vast amounts of
energy ." they said in the article published yesterday.
Imported oil costs around S3t> a 42-gallon barrel,
10 times as much as it did in 1973. and the energy
waste "drives higher the price of future oil purchases,
which in turn makes it easier for OPEC to cut produc
tion and raise prices even more," they said.
Stobaugh. a Harvard Business School professor,
and Yergin. a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School
of Government, headed the six-year Harvard Busi
ness School energy study that resulted in the book
Energy Future published last May.

DOE memo cites dangers of coal
WASHING lON — A U.S. plan to convert more
than 60 oil and gas-fired utilities to coal would boost
air pollution over the Northeast by more than 25
percent and sharply increase so-called "acid rain"
showers flowing across the border into Canada, ac
cording to an Energy Department memo.
The plan, which was outlined in the DOE memo
late last month to James Mclntyre, head of the Office
ol Management and Budget, has heen a source of
particular concern to Canadian officials. The Cana
dians were recently assured by senior U.S. environ
mental officials that coal conversion under the presi
dent s energy program would not increase air pollu
tion.
Acid rain — which is usually caused when coal
tired power plant emissions and automobile exhaust
combine with atmospheric moisture — is an unusu
ally sensitive subject with the Canadians. A Canadian
government study has estimated that acid rain could
kill tish in 48.000 lakes north of the border over the
next 20 years.
