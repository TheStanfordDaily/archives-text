# Libertarian group organizing campaign
## 
### Suzanne Smith Staff Writer 
A group of students supporting
Libertarian presidential candidate Ed
Clark met yesterday to discuss cam
paign strategies and Clark's possible
visit here March 7.
The group, calling itself the Stanford
Community for Clark, drew about 1 I
members to its organizational meeting.
According to Chairman Scott Olm
sted, the organization's goal is to "run a
highly visible, omnipresent campaign
to make clear that there arc three par
tics, not two."
June Genis, a Libertarian who works
at the University's Center for Informa
tion on Technology (CIT), is intent on
getting Clark to come to the University
on March 7. "He's already expressed
some interest," she said.
She believes Clark will come if he's
convinced that he will get national
media exposure. Genis feels this is
likely, noting the coverage Stanford's
anti-draft rallies have already received.
Tentative plans for March 7 call fora
brief press conference at the airport
and a noon rally on campus focusing on
opposition to the draft. The afternoon
would be devoted to conferences and
tapings, and there would be a banquet
and open house in the evening.
Genis said that a visit by Clark would
have "tremendous impact" on campus.

According to Olmsted, Stanford is
leading all other campuses in aware
ness of l ibertarianism.
The Libertarian philosophy holds
that individuals should be free to do as
they choose, as long as they do not try
to impose their values on others by
threats or violence.
Olmsted said the Libertarian group
on campus now is larger than in previ
ous years. There arc currently 150
people on its mailing list, and 30 to 40
others have expressed interest, he said.
"We often have a table set up in
White Plaza, and I've noticed an awful
lot of interest," he said. "Many people
talk with us and say, 'I've always felt
this way, but I thought it was only
me." "
Clark's platform advocates a
minimum of government activity. I le is
opposed to any form of the draft and to
foreign intervention except as a direct
torm ol seft-defense. He favors a re
duction of taxation, an elimination of
the minimum wage and a ban on deficit
spending. He also proposes a ban on
energy subsidies and price controls.
"Clark offers the kind of choice
Americans haven't had for 100 years
â€” one who believes in the right of indi
viduals to live their lives as they
choose," said Olmsted, a graduate stu
dent in Engineering-Economic Sys
tems.
