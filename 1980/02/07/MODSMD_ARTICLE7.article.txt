# 'Self-centered children'
## Bani Sadr raps militants 
### Michael Weisskopf the Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Iran's new pres
ident yesterday issued his harshest at
tack yet against the radical Moslems
occupying the U.S. Embassy in Tehran,
labeling them "self-centered children"
after they engineered the arrest of a
government minister accused of being
a CIA ally.
In an interview with the Tehran daily
newspaper Kuyhun, President
Abolhassan Bani Sadr denounced the
embassy captors tor behaving like "a
government within a government" and
said their practice of making unproven
allegations against Iranian officials
creates chaos.
Last night, the ruling Revolutionary
Council, which appointed Bani Sadr
acting chairman Tuesday, backed his
bitter protest against the militants by
calling for the release of Information
Minister Nasser Minachi, who was ar
rested early yesterday, according to re
ports from Tehran.
Showdown
Since his election last month as Iran's
first president, Bani Sadr, an outspo
ken moderate on the embassy crisis,
has been moving toward a showdown
with the Islamic militants who have
been holding an estimated 50 Ameri
cans hostage for days.
U.S. officials who see Bani Sadr as
the best hope for negotiating an end to
the 13-week-old crisis say the new
president must first consolidate his own
power and isolate the embassy milit
ants who demand the return of Iran's
deposed shah as the price of releasing
the hostages.
Allegations
Minachi, the first Cabinet minister to
be denounced in a series of "revela
tions" by the militants, was arrested at
his home at 2 a.m. yesterday after a
spokesman for the captors said over
national television that embassy docu
ments show he was a collaborator of
the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency.
One document cited was dated Dec.
<S. 197N, a month before Shah
Mohammad Re/a Pahlavi fled Iran, ac
cording to news reports from Tehran.
The documents allegedly said of

Minachi: "He has been very truthful
and frank with the embassy staff and
has been passing information."
The minister was taken to E\in
Prison where officials were reported to
be questioning him about his alleged
CIA contacts. He was arrested on a
warrant signed by the Islamic Re
volutionary Court that apparently was
prompted by the broadcast, observers
said.
In an interview with Reuter after the
broadcast, Minachi described the alle
gations as nonsense, lie said the con
tents of the documents were " just the
personal concept of the political offic
ers of the embassy" whom he met be
fore the shah was overthrown.
Bani Sadr. who has consistently
criticized the embassy takeover and is
believed to have been responsible for
Tuesday's departure from government

scr\ ice til the religious leader closest to
the militants, stepped up his attack in
the Kayhun interview yesterday.
• Why do they always put these chil
dren on the air without consulting the
authorities?" he asked, combining his
denunciation of the militants with
another blast against the state broad
casting complex he claims has unfairly
criticized him and other moderates.
Ot the most recent broadcast, he
said." It is a self-centered action by the
students. How can one rule a country
when a group called 'students following
the path of the I man' acts in a sell
centered way and behaves like a gov
ernment within a government?"
"It is the courts that must investigate
those allegations," Bani Sadr con
tinued. "and then judge whether a per
son is guilty or not. Otherwise, chaos
will be created in the country."
