# Law profs condemn arrests in Taiwan
## 
### Brad Crystal Seth Zuckerman News Editors 
More than 50 law professors here
and at UC-Berkeley last week sent a
telegram to the president of Taiwan
expressing concern over the mass ar
rest of that country's political opposi
tion members.
The arrests stemmed from a Dec. 10
human rights day in a small Taiwanese
port city, which erupted into a riot.
In all, 65 people have reportedly
been arrested. They include almost
every major politician opposing the rul
ing Kuomintang party.
Many observers here and in Taiwan
regard the arrests as a regression in
Taiwan's movement toward democ
racy. Others say the Taiwanese gov
ernment overreacted, especially since
some of the arrested opposition mem
bers did not attend the rally.
" There has been a great deal of
overkill on the part of the Nationalist
government." said Victor Li. one of the
signers of the protest letter and a pro
fessor at the Law School here.
Apparently, Taiwanese officials
were most upset by the demonstrators'
proposal to abandon the idea that the
small island nation represents all of
C liina. Native resentment
According to one signer, who asked
not to be named, the 85 percent of the
country's population who are native
Taiwanese resent the fact that almost
all of Taiwan's rulers are of mainland
Chinese descent. There was an enorm
ous influx of mainland Chinese to
Taiwan after the Chinese communist
revolution in 1949.
The signer added that the mainland
Chinese would always oppose a native
Taiwanese who wanted to be president,
minister of finance or of national de
fense. even though many lesser figures
in Taiwanese politics are of Formosan
origin.
What distressed Li and the signers ot
the letter, however, was the likelihood
that many of the arrested rioters would

be depriv ed of their civil rights by being
tried in military courts.
There is little guarantee of a fair trial
in a military court since Taiwan's two
most active lawyers in defending politi
cal dissidents. Yao Chia-wen and Lin
Yi-hsiung. were themselves arrested.
Li said.
According to Li. "there is virtually
nobody who would be able to act as
counsel for the defendants if they were
tried in a military court."
Although Li said the Taiwanese go\ -
ernment may have a just case in pres
sing criminal charges against some of
those who were present at the riot, he
added they should not be convicted of
treason or seditious conspiracy.
"Criminal charges are one matter."
said Li."But." he added, "'it the riot is
used as a basis of a charge for seditious
conspiracy, that's entirely different."
Cracking down
Another signer of the telegram said
the government seized this opportunity
to crack down on its opposition.
"They are using the national policy
for the reconquering of the mainland as
an excuse for oppression," the signer
said.
Why was the letter written?
According to Li. it demonstrates to
the Taiwanese government that the
United States is not apathetic to what
has happened.
"One letter won't have much effect,
but lots of letters w ill." said Li stressing
that other groups and individuals
shouldn't hesitate to write the
Taiwanese government, provided they
don't have relatives on the island who
might suffer possible repercussions.
One signer said they sent the tele
gram in the hope the Taiwanese gov
ernment "will be a little bit vulnerable
to the pressure."
The signer, who asked not to be
named, said the International Commit
tee of Jurists and the International
League of Human Rights would like to
send a delegation of three people, in
cluding Li. to watch the trials.
