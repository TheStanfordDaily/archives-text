REBATE CHECK!
February is Rebate Month at Pacific Stereo and The Sound Works! Now
you can get a hot deal on name-brand stereo components and get a
hefty rebate check to boot! See, California's Inventory Tax has been
repealed—a tax that cost us $128,000 last year—and Rebate Month is
our way of sharing the tax savings with you. Here's how it works: Buy
any component marked with a rebate tag (the items here are just a
sample). Mail in your rebate postcard and we'll send your check in 4 to
6 weeks. It's simple! Rebate Month at Pacific Stereo and The
Sound Works...your chance to save big on name-brand stereo!
