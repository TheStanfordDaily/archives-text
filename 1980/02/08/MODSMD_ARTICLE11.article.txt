ISLAMABAD. Pakistan —
Moslem guerrillas have killed
more than 2000 Soviet troops in
Afghanistan and will soon unite
to fight for a provisional Islamic
government to be set up next
month, a rebel leader said Wed
nesday.
Soviet authorities, meanwhile,
said that Afghan soldiers had
wiped out a band of rebels in the
northeast Badakhshan Province
and claimed the insurgents were
bearing American arms and had
been trained in China.
In Kabul, the Afghan capital, a
member of the new Soviet
installed regime said that
thousands of prisoners were
summarily executed and some
times buried alive in mass graves
under the previous government
of Hafizullah Amin.
Meanwhile. Prof. Burhanud
din Rabbani. chairman of the Is
lamic Alliance of Afghanistan,
announced formation of a new
rebel provisional government at
a news conference in the Pakis
tani border town of Peshawar.

He said the new government
would be based "somewhere in
Afghanistan." and he appealed
to Islamic countries to provide
weapons, money and relief
goods for guerrillas fighting the
Marxist regime of Babrak Kar
mal.
Tuesday, another insurgent
leader. Zia Khan Nassary, head
of the Islamic National Re
volutionary Council, said a milit
ary government had been set up
in southern Afghanistan backed
by some 15,000 armed men.
Rabbani said Moslem guerril
las. joined by some
20.000 Afghan army deserters,
have killed more than 2000
Soviet troops and captured many
sophisticated weapons since the
Dec. 27 coup.
He said several areas, includ
ing Badakhshan. Bamiyan and
Uruzgan provinces, had
"changed hands frequently."
and the insurgents controlled all
of Kunhar and Paktia provinces
except for Soviet bases.
"The Russians are not tin a
picnic in Afghanistan." Rabbani

said, adding that a unified char
ter for the joint military com
mand of the guerrillas was in the
works.
A United Nations spokesman
in Kabul said the precarious sec
urity situation in Afghanistan
has forced suspension of several
U.N. projects — including a
forestry program and an effort to
restore Islamic monuments in
the Western town of Herat.
In Kabulfa member of the rul
ing Afghan revolutionary coun
cil identified as "Soroya" said
that under the Amin regime
guards at Puli Charki prison out

with lists of prisoners to be shot
or blown up by hand grenades.
The woman, who said she her
self was imprisoned and tor
tured. said the bodies were
placed in mass graves dug by
bulldozers, although many
showed signs of life while they
were being buried.
On the diplomatic front,

international community in forc
ing the Soviet union to withdraw
its troops from Afghanistan.
