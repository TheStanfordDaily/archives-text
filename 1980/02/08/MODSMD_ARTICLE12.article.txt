BANGKOK. Thailand
Vietnamese troops ha\e stepped
up attacks on guerrilla stron
gholds near the Thai border over
the past two weeks in what some
analysts here say is a long
awaited dry-season offensive.
The escalation of the lighting
appears to be the concerted
"police action' that Vietnamese
Vice Foreign Minister Phan
Mien referred to recently in an
interview in Hanoi.
"It'snot spectacular but it's ef
fective." one Western analyst
said. "They're just grinding them
down."
In the past two weeks, large
numbers of Vietnamese troops

supported by artillery have at
tacked two main encampments
of the guerrillas backing ousted
Cambodian Premier Pol Pot.
sources say.
Vietnamese troops drove Pol
Pot from the capital of Phnom
Penh 13 months ago but still
have not defeated the last of his
guerrillas, many of whom have
now dug in near the Thai border.
Thai and Western analysts say
it is difficult to learn what is hap
pening daily and that conflicting
reports have been received from
the border area. They say it is
even more difficult to predict
Vietnamese plans for the area,
and what may happen to the
more than 200.000 Cambodian

refugees camped along the bor
der.
Prom Jan. 25-29. Thai milit
ary sources said, the Vietnamese
attacked the mountainous
Phnom Malai camp just across
the border from the I hai village
of I hap I'rik â€” where the first
huge influx of starving refugees
came last October.
The Vietnamese withdrew
after dri\ ing out Pol Pot's troops,
the sources said, but guerrilla
lighting continues in the area.
Since Jan. 30. about a regi
ment of Vietnamese troops has
battled guerrillas at the moun
tain camp ol Phnom Chat, north
ol Phnom Malai. the sources
said.
