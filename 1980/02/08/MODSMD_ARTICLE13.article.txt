# Israel builds air base with U.S. aid
## 
### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
ELIAT. Israel — Israel and
the United States Wednesday
opened to the foreign press the
site of a $1 billion dollar Israeli
air base being built over a few
miles of desert near Eliat to re
plaee another base to be given
up to Egypt in a couple of years.
Journalists were shown
bulldozers and earth movers
churning up dust — needlessly, it
would seem, because they halted
work as soon as cameras were
lowered.
The newsmen were shown
scores of air-conditioned, white
prefabricated buildings in which
1300 foreign workers are living,
and were lectured in American
militarese about the progress of
work ("within the time frame" ).
What was shown, in fact, was a
facility built to build the ultimate
facility — the air base. It is one of
three bases underconstruction in
the Negev Desert of southern Is
rael to replace airfields which
will be lost to Israel by its with
drawal from Egyptian Sinai.
The base shown reporters
Wednesday is known as Ovda,
and replaces the Etzion base a
few seconds' jet flight southwest
of it in a section of the Sinai
Peninsula that will be returned to
Eg_\pt in March 1982.
Emotion, not logic
"What is ruling the Middle
East is emotion, and not logic."
an Israeli general said. "Obvi
ously, this border could have
been altered to leave Etzion in
Israel. But this is the Middle
East. What applies is emotion."
Because of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's demand for the
return "of every inch" of
Israeli-occupied Egyptian soil,
no such deal was made. The Etz
ion base live miles west of Eliat.
Israel's southernmost city, is
being replaced for $1.04 billion
by Ovda. 24 miles north of Eilat
and a few miles east of the Sinai
line.
Another base being built with
U.S. help is under construction
at Ramon, southwest of
Beersheba, and a third is being
built by Israel.
Work started at Ovda last Ap
ril. and although a press aide was

appointed by the government
and the consortium of four U.S.
firms during the work, virtually
no information was officially re
leased about the project.
An Israeli fund-raising execu
tive said that taking the wraps off
Ovda had been delayed until
leaders of a State of Israel bonds
tour could get the first look.
Something to show
"Also," lie said, "there had to
be something to show."
The first move at Ovda, typical
of the new projects, was to build
roads in. temporary housing and
headquarters facilities, and a
rough air strip. That part of the
job is finished, and now, as work
gets under way on the runways
themselves, facilities to be used
during the construction of the
base itself are being built.
A concrete plant, an asphalt
plant, a steel fabricating plant
and more permanent living quar
ters in which workers will live
until 1982 are now beginning to
go up. Doing the work are 869
Thai laborers, supervised by 380
U.S. and 83 British foremen,
technicians and department
heads. There are four U.S. Air
Force and U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers officers overseeing it
all.
Israel originally asked that the
four U.S. companies in the con
sortium not buy materials in Is
rael or hire Israeli workers in
order to avoid bringing in foreign
currency which would increase
inflation in this country. Now
government measures against Is
rael's three-digit inflation have
shown slight success but with un
employment the result. The con
sortium is now planning to start
hiring Israelis and start buying
materials in Israel to help the
local economy.
"Our men make $800 to
$ 1000-a-month." said Ken
Banchar, 33. a Thai who is per
sonnel manager for his fellow
countrymen. "That'sabout twice
what they make in Thailand.
And there are no taxes, rent,
food bills, medical bills. ar
year everyone will get a 15-day
vacation to go home, and then
we'll see if they sign up for
another year's contract."

Israeli-occupied Egyptian soil,
no such deal was made. The Etz
ion base live miles west of Eliat.
Israel's southernmost city, is
being replaced for $1.04 billion
by Ovda. 24 miles north of Eilat
and a few miles east of the Sinai
line.
Another base being built with
U.S. help is under construction
at Ramon, southwest of
Beersheba, and a third is being
built by Israel.
Work started at Ovda last Ap
ril. and although a press aide was

appointed by the government
and the consortium of four U.S.
firms during the work, virtually
no information was officially re
leased about the project.
An Israeli fund-raising execu
tive said that taking the wraps off
Ovda had been delayed until
leaders of a State of Israel bonds
tour could get the first look.
Something to show
"Also," lie said, "there had to
be something to show."
The first move at Ovda, typical
of the new projects, was to build
roads in. temporary housing and
headquarters facilities, and a
rough air strip. That part of the
job is finished, and now, as work
gets under way on the runways
themselves, facilities to be used
during the construction of the
base itself are being built.
A concrete plant, an asphalt
plant, a steel fabricating plant
and more permanent living quar
ters in which workers will live
until 1982 are now beginning to
go up. Doing the work are 869
Thai laborers, supervised by 380
U.S. and 83 British foremen,
technicians and department
heads. There are four U.S. Air
Force and U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers officers overseeing it
all.
Israel originally asked that the
four U.S. companies in the con
sortium not buy materials in Is
rael or hire Israeli workers in
order to avoid bringing in foreign
currency which would increase
inflation in this country. Now
government measures against Is
rael's three-digit inflation have
shown slight success but with un
employment the result. The con
sortium is now planning to start
hiring Israelis and start buying
materials in Israel to help the
local economy.
"Our men make $800 to
$ 1000-a-month." said Ken
Banchar, 33. a Thai who is per
sonnel manager for his fellow
countrymen. "That'sabout twice
what they make in Thailand.
And there are no taxes, rent,
food bills, medical bills. ar
year everyone will get a 15-day
vacation to go home, and then
we'll see if they sign up for
another year's contract."
ELIAT. Israel — Israel and
the United States Wednesday
opened to the foreign press the
site of a $1 billion dollar Israeli
air base being built over a few
miles of desert near Eliat to re
plaee another base to be given
up to Egypt in a couple of years.
Journalists were shown
bulldozers and earth movers
churning up dust — needlessly, it
would seem, because they halted
work as soon as cameras were
lowered.
The newsmen were shown
scores of air-conditioned, white
prefabricated buildings in which
1300 foreign workers are living,
and were lectured in American
militarese about the progress of
work ("within the time frame" ).
What was shown, in fact, was a
facility built to build the ultimate
facility — the air base. It is one of
three bases underconstruction in
the Negev Desert of southern Is
rael to replace airfields which
will be lost to Israel by its with
drawal from Egyptian Sinai.
The base shown reporters
Wednesday is known as Ovda,
and replaces the Etzion base a
few seconds' jet flight southwest
of it in a section of the Sinai
Peninsula that will be returned to
Eg_\pt in March 1982.
Emotion, not logic
"What is ruling the Middle
East is emotion, and not logic."
an Israeli general said. "Obvi
ously, this border could have
been altered to leave Etzion in
Israel. But this is the Middle
East. What applies is emotion."
Because of Egyptian President
Anwar Sadat's demand for the
return "of every inch" of
Israeli-occupied Egyptian soil,
no such deal was made. The Etz
ion base live miles west of Eliat.
Israel's southernmost city, is
being replaced for $1.04 billion
by Ovda. 24 miles north of Eilat
and a few miles east of the Sinai
line.
