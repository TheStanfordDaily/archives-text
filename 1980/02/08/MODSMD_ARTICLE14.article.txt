# Violence, political splits threaten Turkey

### Dusko Doder The Washington Post 
ANKARA. Turkey — Cot Tee and light
h 111hs ha\e disappeared from Turkish shops,
hut So\ iet-niade Kalashnikov rifles are read
ily available in the bazaars, and the cycle ol
\ lolence that marks life in this country today
already has produced several "liberated
towns in the hands of terrorist armies.
The police in many areas are openly split
along political lines — "right-wing police
forces and "left-wing" police forces.
II the frequent ideological violence were
not enough, there are regular reports in east
ern Turkey of armed clashes involving Kur
dish secessionists. About 7 million Kurds live
in eastern Turkey along the border with Iran.
Iraq and Syria.
112 iercely independent and a secular state
since the revolution ol Kemal Ataturk in
1M23. Turkey today is on the verge of col
lapse. undermined by economic tragility and
torn by political violence.
Officials said that armed leftist groups are
in control of the eastern town of I unceli.
while rightist paramilitary forces are in
charge of the city of Erzurum. a strategic
provincial capital ol 105.000 in Turkish Ar
menia.
Lawlessness
Lawlessness and banditry also are re
ported on the rise throughout Turkey as fac
tories stand idle because of oil shortages and
one out ol four workers is without a job.
The absence of any type of unemployment
insurance or even temporary support for the
jobless has put an enormous strain on the
society.

Those who hold jobs and have seen their
income steadily shrinking because of 70 per
cent inflation were dealt a devastating blow
last week when Prime Minister Suleyman
DemireTs government announced stringent
belt-tightening measures, including price in
creases ol from 50 percent to 300 percent on
virtually all basic commodities.
So far. there have been few mass acts of
ci\ il disobedience. Last Friday, thousands of
Istanbul residents who use ferry boats to
reach work across the Bosporus refused to
pay their fares.
But Turkish and Western officials say the
situation is potentially explosive since wide
spread dissatisfaction could easily turn into
riots and provoke a reluctant military to take
over the government.
Needs help
Demircl said he urgently needs Western
financial assistance to buy oil and get the
economy moving. After two months in of
fice. he has vowed to eliminate anarchy and
restore government control in "liberated
areas." His entire "time and energy" is de
voted to the issues of economy and terrorism,
he said, with the latter getting "70 percent"
of his attention.
Although the government arrested more
than a thousand suspected terrorists in
January, the crackdown has yet to make an
appreciable impact on the political violence.
Since the beginning of the year, there has
been an average of six assassinations daily. In
the 22 months before Demirel took power
last November, 2444 persons were killed and
more than 10.000 others were injured in ter

rorist attacks.
At least nine leftist groups are known to
operate in Istanbul and Ankara, ranging
from the Marxist-Leninist Propaganda
Union to the Turkish Revolutionary Com
munist Union. Officials fear that these
groups are in cooperation with the
Moscow-oriented Kurdish groups.
Rightist armed groups are known to main
tain close association with the ultra-right
Nationalist Action Party.
Attacks
Both sides carry out terrorist attacks
against prominent figures ranging from
businessmen and judges to newspaper
editors, uncooperative police officials and
the Americans in Turkey.
Both sides would like to provoke a military
takeover, but for different reasons.
The rightists would like to see an au
thoritarian government in Ankara that
would stamp out the left and the Kurdish
problem. The leftists believe a military
takeover would be a prelude to a Marxist
revolution.
"This could lead to a terrible end," said
columnist Hasan Carnal, pointing out that
the numbers of unemployed are swelling
with young people who have no prospects of
employment. This year 435,000 high school
graduates have applied to universities, but
only 40,000 were accepted.
An Istanbul industrialist, Mehmet Mer
merci, said, "The middle class is being
crushed by inflation. The rich are getting
richer and the poor are getting poorer, and
that's why I fear we are going to have a
revolution in Turkey."

So far. there have been few mass acts of
ci\ il disobedience. Last Friday, thousands of
Istanbul residents who use ferry boats to
reach work across the Bosporus refused to
pay their fares.
But Turkish and Western officials say the
situation is potentially explosive since wide
spread dissatisfaction could easily turn into
riots and provoke a reluctant military to take
over the government.
Needs help
Demircl said he urgently needs Western
financial assistance to buy oil and get the
economy moving. After two months in of
fice. he has vowed to eliminate anarchy and
restore government control in "liberated
areas." His entire "time and energy" is de
voted to the issues of economy and terrorism,
he said, with the latter getting "70 percent"
of his attention.
Although the government arrested more
than a thousand suspected terrorists in
January, the crackdown has yet to make an
appreciable impact on the political violence.
Since the beginning of the year, there has
been an average of six assassinations daily. In
the 22 months before Demirel took power
last November, 2444 persons were killed and
more than 10.000 others were injured in ter

rorist attacks.
At least nine leftist groups are known to
operate in Istanbul and Ankara, ranging
from the Marxist-Leninist Propaganda
Union to the Turkish Revolutionary Com
munist Union. Officials fear that these
groups are in cooperation with the
Moscow-oriented Kurdish groups.
Rightist armed groups are known to main
tain close association with the ultra-right
Nationalist Action Party.
Attacks
Both sides carry out terrorist attacks
against prominent figures ranging from
businessmen and judges to newspaper
editors, uncooperative police officials and
the Americans in Turkey.
Both sides would like to provoke a military
takeover, but for different reasons.
The rightists would like to see an au
thoritarian government in Ankara that
would stamp out the left and the Kurdish
problem. The leftists believe a military
takeover would be a prelude to a Marxist
revolution.
"This could lead to a terrible end," said
columnist Hasan Carnal, pointing out that
the numbers of unemployed are swelling
with young people who have no prospects of
employment. This year 435,000 high school
graduates have applied to universities, but
only 40,000 were accepted.
An Istanbul industrialist, Mehmet Mer
merci, said, "The middle class is being
crushed by inflation. The rich are getting
richer and the poor are getting poorer, and
that's why I fear we are going to have a
revolution in Turkey."

Lawlessness
Lawlessness and banditry also are re
ported on the rise throughout Turkey as fac
tories stand idle because of oil shortages and
one out ol four workers is without a job.
The absence of any type of unemployment
insurance or even temporary support for the
jobless has put an enormous strain on the
society.

Those who hold jobs and have seen their
income steadily shrinking because of 70 per
cent inflation were dealt a devastating blow

DemireTs government announced stringent
