Fernflack's law ot amateur journalism: there will
always he more questions submitted to Bug Me
during midterms than at any other time, except
finals. Here are a few questions that have been
anxiously awaiting answers.
Dear Bug Me,
Could you please give me some information
about the little golf carts / see roaming around cam
pus? Who is eligible to use them? Do they cost
anything? Where does one go to get them? Thank
you,
Wondering in Larkin
I was under the impression that all you had to do
was stub your toe or break a leg, but it's actually
much easier than that. The carts are available to
any student who wants one and is willing to pay
Ciolt Carts West tor that privilege.
The Student Health Center does not provide the
carts to patients. Cowell will help the students ar
range the rental, but the carts are considered an
auxiliary service. If an injured student chooses to
use a cart, he or she must rent them from the
aforementioned Santa Clara company.
Dear Bug Me,
The mailbox at the corner of Galvez and Escon
dido, which was so convenient for those of lis who
live on that side of campus, disappeared with the
street. Is it going to be replaced?
R.S.
No. The mail receptacle in question was re
peatedly turned over and otherwise abused by
vandals, according to Ron Sodlink of the Stanford
Post Office.
"Evidently, it wasn't needed for the purpose it
was put out there for," Sodlink said. There are no
plans to replace it.
Dear Bug Me,
Mounted on the sandstone outside Geology
Corner is a set of glassed-in display cases. I wish to
remove the year-old poster therein (for my poster
collection). Question is, who has the key to that
case?
Puzzled Poster Picker
That may seem like a simple question. Wrong. I
called Public Events, who suggested the Student
Guide Service, which suggested Public Affairs,
who suggested the Lock Shop, which suggested the
Geology Department, which suggested Lively
Arts.
Lively Arts is part of Public Events. Nobody
seemed to know who was responsible for the dis
play case. I hate to admit defeat, but since Puzzled

has been waiting almost a month while I've been
running in circles, I figured I'd throw it out to the
public.
Will whoever has the key, or knows of its where
abouts. please contact me? Please? Pretty please?
Dear Bug Me,
/am bugged by the potholes on Arboretum Road
between Quarry Road and Galvez Street. Why ha
ven't they been repaired, and when will they be?
They're awfully hard on my little car. And why has
the shoulder not been replaced to create either a
second lane, a hike lane, or sidewalk?
V. W.
"We did repair the potholes about a year ago,"
said Operations Manager Bruce Wiggins. But if
more patching is required, he added, it will be done
as soon as possible.
Repairing or adding to the shoulder is a more
complicated project, according to Wiggins. Be
cause it is a construction problem rather than just
maintenance, it has been referred to another de
partment. where it will be considered with other
general plant improvements.
An interesting inflation note: with the rising
prices of oil and oil products, the asphalt needed to
till a pothole now costs about $15 to $20.
Let's end the info with another round ol statis
tics. These should be immensely interesting to
those brilliant seniors planning to hear from certain
prestigious graduate schools in the immediate fu
ture.
Dear Hug Me,
How many Stanford grads get admitted to the
Stanford law, business and medical schools '
What percent of their entering classes?
The Red Ink Phantom
I really doubWwy grads get admitted to all three.
Seriously, though . . . of the 52N students enrol
led in the Stanford Law School, 57 are Stanford
graduates. What's that, about 1 1 percent? Harvard
supplies half as many, and Yale is the number
three feedet 1 school.
The Biz School has a similar ranking: Stanford
sends the highest percentage, then Harvard. Last
year. Berkeley was third and Dartmouth fourth.
The Med School reports an interesting trend.
For the past four years the percentage of Stanford
grads enrolling there has declined. From 20 per
cent in 1975, down steadily to 7 percent last
year. This is just a decline in enrollment, as Cheryl
LoMaglio of the admissions office points out, and
doesn't necessarily imply that the Med School is
accepting fewer Stanford grads than in the past.
