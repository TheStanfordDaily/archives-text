## Minority graduate enrollment on the rise 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
New enrollment of minority students
in graduate and professional programs
here has increased in the past year, ac
cording to recently published enroll
ment figures.
Total new minority enrollments at
the graduate level increased from I 14
to I 97N to 150 out of INK 6 total new

Achievement Program (MESAP). de
signed to qualify high school students
for college-level engineering.
Rita Duncan, who works for the
Stanford MESAP center (one of I 6
centers in California), said the program
tries to "'get blacks. Chicanos and na
tive Americans to take more math/
science courses in high school."
The program, funded by industrial

enrollments in 1979. a 31 percent in
crease.
The largest increases came in the
engineering and law schools . and the
largest decline came in the School of
Education.
Engineering enrollment increased
Irom 13 minority students to 31 and
law enrollment increased irom 19
minority students to 31. Enrollment in
the School of Education decreased
from 14 minority students to eight.
Although minority enrollments are
higher than last year, they are lower
than those in the early 1970s (see ac
companying table).
'Spectacular"
According to Engineering Dean Wil
liam Kays, the jump in engineering is
due to "spectacular" increases in
minority interest at the undergraduate
level.
Part of this interest is due to the
Ma the ma ties-Engineering Science

companies and universities, prepares
minority students "lor any school."
said Duncan.
Duncan cited the high-paying jobs
and the quickness of getting an en
gineering degree as partial reasons for
the high minority enrollment in the
field.
Arthur Walker, associate professor
of applied physics and associate dean of
the graduate division, attributes the
two-year-old federally furrded
Graduate and Professional Oppor
tunities Program (CiPOP) as a signific
ant factor in the minority graduate stu
dent increase.
This program awards fellowships
which provide funding to be used in
recruitment programs and planning ef
forts.
According to Madelyn Hunt, assis
tant dean in the School of Engineering,
the University enrolled four engineer

Hunt said the program awards the

sity then picks the recipients and pays
the balance required.
National funding increased from $4

increased from 4X9 to SXO.

Dean of Ciraduate Studies Bliss Car

have done is allocate a certain number

Decline
I le added that the decline from I 972
to 1977 could have resulted from more
minorities going directly into industry.
Elizabeth Morris, director ol admis
sions tor the School of Education, at
tributes the decline of new minority en
rollments in that school to "a general
decline in applications." She said the
decline is "across the board." not just
in minority applications.
