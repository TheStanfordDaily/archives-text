## It's too deep for me 
### 
A friend who I'll call Harvey, because that's his
name, took me out to the O (Oasis) the other night
and bought me all the beer I could drink, and then
some. I was afraid he wanted to confess his latest
moral transgression. Moral transgression is Har
vey's second favorite pastime His favorite is con
fession.
But 1 managed with ease to keep the conversa
tion away from Harvey's not-so-personal life until
after 11 p.m. In fact, it was with such great ease that
I became nervous. 1 started to fear the worst.
My fear was well founded. At 11:16 p.m. Harvey
took a stack of papers from his backpack and
handed it to me. It was Harvey's poetry.
For a moment 1 cringed, but I was filled with as
much guilt as beer, so 1 read the poems. 1 did so
carefully enough to need four more beers. Halfway
through. 1 had to leave the table to relieve myself.
When 1 finished. Harvey's eyes lit up.
"Well?" he asked, tentatively.
"The meter is perfect." I said. "You've got some
great images. You use words well. But I'm no
poetry critic. I really can't judge. You should ask
someone who knows about this sort of thing."
"You didn't like any of them, did you? What's
wrong?"
I looked at the floor, blushed, and belched.
"I'm sorry. Harvey. You're a great technician,
but you just don't have any depth."'
"What do you mean? What about that poem
about the sea?"
"Writing a poem about the Marianas Trench
doesn't give you depth, Harvey."
"It doesn't?"
"I'm afraid not, Harvey. You'll just have to face
it. You're as shallow as a pie pan. You live on the
crust. You're too happy."
"What rotten luck," said Harvey. "1 was bom
rich. I'm incredibly handsome, intelligent,
talented, witty and charming. And I'm not nearly
as conceited as I have a right to be."
"I know. Harvey. You're just a normal Stanford
male. You'll have to learn to live with it."
"Why can't I be a total failure like you. Larry?
Why can't I have a decent depression now and
then? Why can t 1 feel completely worthless?"
"I guess that's just one of the mysteries of life.
Harvey. We're not all equal."
"Isn't there anything I can do about my condi
tion? Am I destined to be happy the rest of my life?
Help me Larry. I'm desperate. I don't know if I can
go on without hope for the worse."
I was so touched by Harvey's insincerity that 1
decided to help him.
"There is something you can do." I said. "It's a
small step, but you have to start somewhere. I warn
you that you'll have to make a real effort if you
want to get better — I mean worse."

"What is it? I'll do anything."
"You could make a decent start by getting re
jected by a few women — or by the same woman
several times. Personally. I get more depth from
the latter."
"But how?" asked Harvey."Womencan't seem
to resist me Why couldn't I have bad table man
ners and a losing personality like you? I'll bet there
isn't a woman on campus who would go out with
you, you lucky dog. I'll bet you've got real depth."
"Well," 1 said, "there was one woman who went
out with me. Lois went to a movie with me, in
public."
"Everyone makes mistakes," said Harvey.
"That's funny." I said. "That's what Lois kept
mumbling."
"There's hope for her yet." said Harvey. "But
what can / do to get rejected? I'm perfect."
"That's your problem right there. Harvey. How
do you expect someone else to reject you if you
can't even reject yourself? Think negative, Har
vey
"You mean that's all I have to do?"
"That's it." I said. "But as a beginner there's a
useful exercise you can practice. Write down three
things about yourself that you detest. Then chant
them over and over and over until they become a
part of you. You'll be worse in no time. I guarantee
it. Just look what it's done for me."
But how am I supposed to think up three things
about myself that 1 don't like? I can't even think of
one."
"I understand. Harvey. It's difficult at first. I
warned you. Give it a month or two. If you can't
come up with any thing, try asking a friend. You'll
have your list in no time."
"Larry, I'm willing to call you my friend, at least
in private. Will you suggest a few things for me?"
"I'd better not.'" I said. "1 suggest that you ask
someone who's bigger than me. someone who can
defend himself better. I'm not very good with my
fists."
"What the hell is that supposed to mean? Do you
think I can't take criticism for God's sake ? What do
you think I am? I'm flexible. You little snot-nosed
wimp. I ought to punch you out right now.
The doctor told me he can remove the stitches
tomorrow . I'm afraid that Harvey will never make
it as a poet, but at least he's making it in the only
way that really matters. Irankly. I'd be willing to
trade a few fathoms ot depth to be as bad a poet as
he is. because I'm in over my head already and I'm
not a good swimmer. Maybe I'll try some of Har
vey's non-negative thinking. Hell, the worst it can
do is make things better. And besides, who wants
to be a poet?
