## Academics overstressed here 
### 
In separate articles in the Jan.
23 Cuinpus Report, President
I.\man and l ied Hargadon
imply in their suggestions for im
proving primary and secondary
schools that intellectual
achievement alone should he
their goal.
Hargadon partialis blames
"diluted curricula" and a less re
spectful attitude towards
teachers tor the reason some pa
rents would rather go on a vaca
tion or bu> a boat orcar than pay
lor college. It seems he concurs
with Prof. Alexander Astin of
I CI.A that "Students are be
coming less committed to and
less turned on by the academic
experience in general." and con
cludes that this is because not
enough is being asked of them.
In other words, parents would
be willing to pay for their chil
dren's college education if they
tell their children had a proper
respect for authority and were
being made to work hard enough
to be able to perceive the pos
sibilities inherent in the intellec
tual endeavor. To this end Stan
lord hopes to"help" the primary
and secondary schools.
It sounds terrific — except lor
those children whose talents and
aptitudes are not in the purely

intellectual realm.
I'm not opposed to hard work;
nor am I anti-intellectual. Intel
lectual excellence is certainly an.
it not the. important ingredient
in a strong society. Everyone
should be able to read, write, do
'basic math, think critically, and
ha\e at least a sense of history.
But intellectual skills are not the
only ones of value in our society.
We must not ignore the other:
hand skills, social skills, artistic
skills and athletic skills.
I believe that our nation can
not truly be strengthened with
out people who possess integrity,
compassion, a sense of humor
and confidence. Though those
qualities cannot be taught in
schools, they can certainly be
stifled there. I hope Stanford
doesn't consider intellectual
skills worth developing in the
primary and secondary levels at
the expense of all the others.
Is Stanford really concerned
about all high school graduates,
or is it just trying to upgrade its
own incoming student body? By
asking more of the primary and
secondary schools. Stanford
probably will be successful in
raising SAT scores and providing
itsell and other "prestigious"
schools with better prepared

students, hut what measures will
the primary and secondary
schools be forced to take to fulfill
the University's expectations?
What will happen to the majority
of students who won't make it
into a prestigious university no
matter how hard they try. how
mucfi is demanded ol them, or
how many sacrifices their pa
rents make?
Even though there is a need to
better develop intellectual skills
in the primary and secondary
schools, we must not forget that
they are educating all our chil
dren. I suspect many of those
courses which "dilute" the cur
ricula are the same courses which
save the self-esteem of students
who wouldn't get into Stanford
no matter what was being de
manded ot them. What will be
the effect on them if those
courses are removed and they're
made to do more of what they're
worst at? I foresee the majority
of our high school graduates
leaving school feeling worthless,
fearing (or hating) authorities,
lacking any confidence in their
own instincts, thoughts and
abilities.
Intellectual ability, in and of
itself, isn't necessarily a wonder
lul thing. Spinning brilliant
thoughts, speaking eloquently,
or even being in the forefront of
research doesn't necessarily
make a person one whit better,
or wiser, than some "Unedu
cated" person who is just doing

the best lie or she can.
Even people with highly de
veloped intellectual skills, in
their efforts to keep or improve
their positions, are not above
hack-biting, political maneuver
ing and occasionally using ques
tionable ethics. Sometimes, be
cause of their undiluted com
mitment to their work, marriages
collapse and children suffer.
There is a certain self
righteousness and lack of hu
manity in the message Stanford
is sending out. And I'm afraid
the schools and parents, in their
anxiety to have their children be
successful, are acting accord
ingly.
The public and priv ate schools
take Stanford's edicts very seri
ously. Please don't isolate "intel
lectual" endeavor. It isn't the
only important one. What all our
young people need to feel is that
they can contribute something of
value to society. Surely their
range of options must extend
beyond just making greater intel
lectual efforts and trying to get
into a prestigious university.
I hope in Stanford's zeal to
"help"' the primary and secon
dary schools, it doesn't place
counter-productive constriction
and standards on primary and
secondary school teachers. They
must educate all our future citi
zens. not just the elite.

the expense of all the others.
Is Stanford really concerned
about all high school graduates,
or is it just trying to upgrade its
own incoming student body? By
asking more of the primary and
secondary schools. Stanford
probably will be successful in
raising SAT scores and providing
itsell and other "prestigious"
schools with better prepared

students, hut what measures will
the primary and secondary
schools be forced to take to fulfill
the University's expectations?
What will happen to the majority
of students who won't make it
into a prestigious university no
matter how hard they try. how
mucfi is demanded ol them, or
how many sacrifices their pa
rents make?
Even though there is a need to
better develop intellectual skills
in the primary and secondary
schools, we must not forget that
they are educating all our chil
dren. I suspect many of those
courses which "dilute" the cur
ricula are the same courses which
save the self-esteem of students
who wouldn't get into Stanford
no matter what was being de
manded ot them. What will be
the effect on them if those
courses are removed and they're
made to do more of what they're
worst at? I foresee the majority
of our high school graduates
leaving school feeling worthless,
fearing (or hating) authorities,
lacking any confidence in their
own instincts, thoughts and
abilities.
Intellectual ability, in and of
itself, isn't necessarily a wonder
lul thing. Spinning brilliant
thoughts, speaking eloquently,
or even being in the forefront of
research doesn't necessarily
make a person one whit better,
or wiser, than some "Unedu
cated" person who is just doing

the best lie or she can.
Even people with highly de
veloped intellectual skills, in
their efforts to keep or improve
their positions, are not above
hack-biting, political maneuver
ing and occasionally using ques
tionable ethics. Sometimes, be
cause of their undiluted com
mitment to their work, marriages
collapse and children suffer.
There is a certain self
righteousness and lack of hu
manity in the message Stanford
is sending out. And I'm afraid
the schools and parents, in their
anxiety to have their children be
successful, are acting accord
ingly.
The public and priv ate schools
take Stanford's edicts very seri
ously. Please don't isolate "intel
lectual" endeavor. It isn't the
only important one. What all our
young people need to feel is that
they can contribute something of
value to society. Surely their
range of options must extend
beyond just making greater intel
lectual efforts and trying to get
into a prestigious university.
I hope in Stanford's zeal to
"help"' the primary and secon
dary schools, it doesn't place
counter-productive constriction
and standards on primary and
secondary school teachers. They
must educate all our future citi
zens. not just the elite.

In separate articles in the Jan.
23 Cuinpus Report, President
I.\man and l ied Hargadon
imply in their suggestions for im
proving primary and secondary
schools that intellectual
achievement alone should he
their goal.
Hargadon partialis blames
"diluted curricula" and a less re
spectful attitude towards
teachers tor the reason some pa
rents would rather go on a vaca
tion or bu> a boat orcar than pay
lor college. It seems he concurs
with Prof. Alexander Astin of
I CI.A that "Students are be
coming less committed to and
less turned on by the academic
experience in general." and con
cludes that this is because not
enough is being asked of them.
In other words, parents would
be willing to pay for their chil
dren's college education if they
tell their children had a proper
respect for authority and were
being made to work hard enough
to be able to perceive the pos
sibilities inherent in the intellec
tual endeavor. To this end Stan
lord hopes to"help" the primary
and secondary schools.
It sounds terrific — except lor
those children whose talents and
aptitudes are not in the purely

intellectual realm.
I'm not opposed to hard work;
nor am I anti-intellectual. Intel
lectual excellence is certainly an.
it not the. important ingredient
in a strong society. Everyone
should be able to read, write, do
'basic math, think critically, and
ha\e at least a sense of history.
But intellectual skills are not the
only ones of value in our society.
We must not ignore the other:
hand skills, social skills, artistic
skills and athletic skills.
I believe that our nation can
not truly be strengthened with
out people who possess integrity,
compassion, a sense of humor
and confidence. Though those
qualities cannot be taught in
schools, they can certainly be
stifled there. I hope Stanford
doesn't consider intellectual
skills worth developing in the
primary and secondary levels at
the expense of all the others.
