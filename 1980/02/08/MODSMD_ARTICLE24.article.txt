## Affirmative action: need, not race 
### 
Well, Frederick Buhl. Jr.,
you've gotten what you undoub
tedly wanted. Your column,
"Liberation, not more discrimi
nation," (Daily, Feb. (1) got me
mad. especially the part where I
was called "a dummy" and "a
latent racist" because I believe
that affirmative action based on
race is wrong.
First, let me say that I am
naturally sorry that your ances
tors had to"singunder the whip"
in this country. But I don't feel
the slightest bit of guilt — so did

mine. As Irish immigrants during
the Great Potato Famine, some
of them undoubtedly helped
build Leland Stanford's great
railroads, since Stanford was a
notable employer of Irishmen
and Orientals.
The difference between Buhl
and me is that I realize that Stan
ford's university and the woYid
do not owe me anything as a re
sult. because I have had a com
fortable life despite my ances
tors' suffering. II I were poor, I
believe that I would be entitled
to some extra pull in admissions
or employment offices, since I
would have had to overcome sig
nificant obstacles to get a good
education. But I'm not. And I
bet Buhl isn't either.
Affirmative action programs
should be based on personal dis
advantages, which are best
measured by family income, not
race. People who are poor
should get extra consideration;
people who are merely black or
Irish or Hispanic or left-handed
or Catholic shouldn't, even
though all of those groups have
historically been subject to dis
crimination.
Why doesn't Buhl follow his
own advice, and "dare to be
open-minded foran instant?" As

racial prejudice slowly becomes
extinct, as it is obviously doing,
what should happen to racial af
firmative action programs?
Should anyone's great
grandchildren get highly
sought-after jobs and college ac
ceptances because they are
minorities? I'll bet some would
say yes. Why kill the goose that
laid the golden egg?
But ask yourself: has your life
been seriously afflicted by pre
judice and discrimination? I'll
bet that you've directly observed
about as much anti-black senti
ment as I've faced anti-
Catholicism: which is to say
some, but nothing that gets in the
way of any of our lives' goals.
Unless, of course, your life's goal
is to have non-minority people
kowtow to you all your life to
make up for evil that was done in
the past by people they never
heard of to people you never
heard of. (Although I'm sure
that Buhl inferred a great deal of
racism that wasn't there, too).
It seems to me that affirmative
action programs based on race
should be phased out when the
percentage of minorities at a
school or a company equals the
percentage in the general popu
lation. And it seems to me that

this point, it not here already, is
just around the corner. Such
programs were necessary to
eliminate the all-WASP atmos
phere at many colleges in the
's()s and "60s. And they have
been successful. Their purpose is
over; let's now give help to those
who really need it — the poor,
both black and white.
One of the things I admire
about my girlfriend is that she
refused to identify herself as a
Hispanic in the "optional" box
on her college applications be
cause she wanted to get in by her
brains, not her Cuban family.
And I myself felt that about half
of my grad school acceptances
were meaningless after I learned
that these schools knew I had
won a fellowship three weeks be
fore I did, and niay have taken
me because it wouldn't cost them
anything. How can anyone take
pride in an achievement that he
may not have earned?
While I wasn't given any logical
reasons why Buhl thinks affirma
tive action based on race is right,
I have given my reasons for con
cluding that it is wrong.

Well, Frederick Buhl. Jr.,
you've gotten what you undoub
tedly wanted. Your column,
"Liberation, not more discrimi
nation," (Daily, Feb. (1) got me
mad. especially the part where I
was called "a dummy" and "a
latent racist" because I believe
that affirmative action based on
race is wrong.
First, let me say that I am
naturally sorry that your ances
tors had to"singunder the whip"
in this country. But I don't feel
the slightest bit of guilt — so did

mine. As Irish immigrants during
the Great Potato Famine, some
of them undoubtedly helped
build Leland Stanford's great
railroads, since Stanford was a
notable employer of Irishmen
and Orientals.
The difference between Buhl
and me is that I realize that Stan
ford's university and the woYid
do not owe me anything as a re
sult. because I have had a com
fortable life despite my ances
tors' suffering. II I were poor, I
believe that I would be entitled
to some extra pull in admissions
or employment offices, since I
would have had to overcome sig
nificant obstacles to get a good
education. But I'm not. And I
bet Buhl isn't either.
Affirmative action programs
should be based on personal dis
advantages, which are best
measured by family income, not
race. People who are poor
should get extra consideration;
people who are merely black or
Irish or Hispanic or left-handed
or Catholic shouldn't, even
though all of those groups have
historically been subject to dis
crimination.
Why doesn't Buhl follow his
own advice, and "dare to be
open-minded foran instant?" As

racial prejudice slowly becomes
extinct, as it is obviously doing,
what should happen to racial af
firmative action programs?
Should anyone's great
grandchildren get highly
sought-after jobs and college ac
ceptances because they are
minorities? I'll bet some would
say yes. Why kill the goose that
laid the golden egg?
But ask yourself: has your life
been seriously afflicted by pre
judice and discrimination? I'll
bet that you've directly observed
about as much anti-black senti
ment as I've faced anti-
Catholicism: which is to say
some, but nothing that gets in the
way of any of our lives' goals.
Unless, of course, your life's goal
is to have non-minority people
kowtow to you all your life to
make up for evil that was done in
the past by people they never
heard of to people you never
heard of. (Although I'm sure
that Buhl inferred a great deal of
racism that wasn't there, too).
It seems to me that affirmative
action programs based on race
should be phased out when the
percentage of minorities at a
school or a company equals the
percentage in the general popu
lation. And it seems to me that

this point, it not here already, is
just around the corner. Such
programs were necessary to
