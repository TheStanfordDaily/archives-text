## Try foreign friendship 
### 
A valuable minority at Stanford has been almost
completely ignored. This lostgroupof people is not
your typical minority: it includes extremely varied
religious, ethnic, political and economic
backgrounds. This minority, representing approx
imately 10 percent of the Stanford student body, is
the international student community.
I remember talking with a fellow student the
other day. We were discussing the close friends we
have made at the University. Through the course of
the conversation my own background came up; I'm
an American citizen, but I grew up in Ghana, West
Africa, returning to the United States a year before
entering college.
Out of interest I asked my friend if any of his
close acquaintances were international students.
His negative reply shocked me.
Yet in retrospect I am not so surprised. Interac
tion between the typical American Stanford stu
dent and an international student is a complex
matter.
I remember my own culture shock just after
returning to the United States. The incredible
speed with which we rush from one activity to the
next left an indelible impression on my mind.
I was also taken aback by the superficial nature
of most day-to-day interaction between people
that our hurried pace seems to breed.
First impressions leave their mark. For some
time I kept to myself. I felt Americans were basi
cally cold and unapproachable.

A completely different set of experiences lay
behind me that I was unable to share with anyone.
Time was not available for personal, past experi
ences to come up in the quick, cursory pattern of so
many of our "Hi, how are you doing?" conversa
tions.
I admit, part of my estranged feeling was my own
problem, but most of those around me were cer
tainly no encouragement.
And I believe many international students at
Stanford now share my past predicament, a predi
cament often causing discomfort and loneliness.
International students bring with them a wealth
of viewpoints from which to learn. Having experi
enced two often radically different social, cultural
and economic contexts leaves them with an ex
panded perspective on human values.
The Bechtel International Center has many op
portunities and social activities which are open to
anyone. With one of every ten of us on campus
being from another country, I'm certain we run
across friends from quite different backgrounds
each day.
But that is the problem. We only run across
them.
Slow down. Take the time to strike up a mean
ingful conversation with an international acquain
tance. You may find it to be the beginning of one of
the most rewarding friendships of your life.
