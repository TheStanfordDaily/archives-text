Speech clarified
1 would like to offer an expla
nation to those who were upset
by my "Feminist Perspective on
the Military" at last week's rally.
I was asked to speak an hour and
a half before the rally, and in re
trospect I can see that the speech
was not very clear. I intend to
write a more careful article for
this quarter's issue of Against the
Grain, but I'd like to offer an
explanation of my "categories"
now.
Historically, values have been
polarized in our society and en
couraged differentially by sex.
Men have traditionally been
socialized to "act" in the world,
women, to care for the family.
Men have been in the positions
of power in society, and thus, the
"traditionally male" characteris
tics have predominated in

decision-making.
The characteristics that have
been associated with men in
clude: confidence, logic, asser
tiveness and aggression, while
those associated with women in
clude: nurturance,
emotionalism, sensitivity and
passivity. (See psychologist
Sandra Bern's research on sex
characteristics.) This is not to say
that one can stereotype women
and men by these characteristics,
nor that these characteristics are
by any means innate; they are
simply those that are culturally
encouraged.
I'm sorry if the men in the
crowd thought I was describing
them as violent.l did not "assert"
that men are "characteristically
violent," although I am aware
that that's what the Daily
printed. My statement on vio
lence was an attempt to explain

responses to conflict. I see vio
lence as a direct outgrowth of ag
gression, and, unfortunately, as a
means that people in power have
used to deal with conflict.
I see a need for a de
polarization of sex roles. Society
should encourage all individuals
to develop the positive charac
teristics traditionally associated
with each sex; people should be
capable of asserting themselves
and being sensitive at the same
time. We cannot afford to. let
one-sided values predominate,
particularly in our social institu
tions.

End interventionism
There are many good
reasons for not having a position
with regard to Carter's proposed

registration and draft. The pre
sent "volunteer" army is neither
morally nor militarily superior to
a citizen army. There is a social
responsibility for citizens to re
turn service to the nation. And,
the solution to our interven
tionist foreign policy is not
isolationism. But each of these
criticisms exposes a fundamental
weakness in our nation which
will not be solved by "saber
rattling" or the conscription of
young men or women into the
Cold War.
The reason we "care" about
the sovereignty of Afghanistan
enough to have pulled out of the
Olympics while we we were wil
ling to go without caring about
Eastern Europe is that "Big Oil"
is threatened and with it our right
to waste the world's resources.
The fundamental weakness of
our nation is the alienation of

workers, consumers, voters and
patriots from a society which ap
pears to benefit the military
industrial complex.
I would support a six-month,
universal training program in
stead of this draft. But more to
the point, I support the end to
the useless arms race and atten
tion to rebuilding our economy.
We need to cut consumption, en
courage small-scale energy gen
eration and involve people in the
solution to social problems at the
community level. And we need
to build interdependent
economic and political ties with
other nations. That, and that
alone will let the Russians know
that we mean business and that
we have the strength to do some
thing about it.

I'm sorry if the men in the
crowd thought I was describing
them as violent.l did not "assert"
that men are "characteristically
violent," although I am aware
that that's what the Daily
printed. My statement on vio
lence was an attempt to explain

responses to conflict. I see vio
lence as a direct outgrowth of ag
gression, and, unfortunately, as a
means that people in power have
used to deal with conflict.
I see a need for a de
polarization of sex roles. Society
should encourage all individuals
to develop the positive charac
teristics traditionally associated
with each sex; people should be
capable of asserting themselves
and being sensitive at the same
time. We cannot afford to. let
one-sided values predominate,
particularly in our social institu
tions.

End interventionism
There are many good
reasons for not having a position
with regard to Carter's proposed

registration and draft. The pre
sent "volunteer" army is neither
morally nor militarily superior to
a citizen army. There is a social
responsibility for citizens to re
turn service to the nation. And,
the solution to our interven
tionist foreign policy is not
isolationism. But each of these
criticisms exposes a fundamental
weakness in our nation which
will not be solved by "saber
rattling" or the conscription of
young men or women into the
Cold War.
The reason we "care" about
the sovereignty of Afghanistan
enough to have pulled out of the
Olympics while we we were wil
ling to go without caring about
Eastern Europe is that "Big Oil"
is threatened and with it our right
to waste the world's resources.
The fundamental weakness of
our nation is the alienation of

workers, consumers, voters and
patriots from a society which ap
pears to benefit the military
industrial complex.
I would support a six-month,
universal training program in
stead of this draft. But more to
the point, I support the end to
the useless arms race and atten
tion to rebuilding our economy.
We need to cut consumption, en
courage small-scale energy gen
eration and involve people in the
solution to social problems at the
community level. And we need
to build interdependent
economic and political ties with
other nations. That, and that
alone will let the Russians know
that we mean business and that
we have the strength to do some
thing about it.
