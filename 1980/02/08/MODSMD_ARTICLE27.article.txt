# FORUM REGISTRATION AND THE DRAFT

"There was indeed one of us who hesitated and
did not want to fall into line, '/'lint was Josef Behm, a
plump, homely fellow. But he did allow himself to
he persuaded, otherwise he would have been os
tracized. And perhaps more of us thought as he did,
hut no one could very well stand out, because at that
time even one's parents were ready with the word
"coward;" no one had the vaguest idea what 'we
were in for. - soldier describing German enlist
ment, All Quiet on the Western Front.
lor us, war is a species of Chimera, described by
another generation, recorded in newspapers,
magazines and history books. We never see it. only
listen as others give their interpretation of its fea
tures and dimensions, knowing that the fantastic
figure that emerges belongs to an entirely different
world than ours, inhabits only similarly unlikely
places of the globe called, the "Western Front,"
the "Pacific Islands" or the "thirty-eighth paral
lel."
Because we perceive war as always "over there"
or "back then," in retrospect we tend to place the
blame for it on vague historical forces, which in
turn assume their own mythological dimensions.
We displace responsibility from people to things.
"Congress," "economic factors," "the psychologi
cal mood of the country" arise as oft-quoted expla
nations for war in newspapers and textbooks, and
they become quickly integrated into the language
of the general populace because such terminology
protects its self-image.
We. as the ones who actually fight war or remain
at home awaiting news of friends and relatives,
want to see ourselves as its real victims, as moral
neutrals in a conflict of forces greater than ourse
lves. Perhaps such an attitude was appropriate to

an earlier period of American history, but how can
anyone harbor such mo ally naive sentiment after
this country's experiences in Southeast Asia?
We would claim that people don't make war.
Governments do. People are good and govern
ments are bad. Yet, didn't we learn from Vietnam
that the American public shares in the guilt for the
blunders of our government because the people
have the proven power to radically alter its policies
through political awareness and involvement? If
the potential for political power held by the public
lies dormant because of ignorance, disinterest or
fear, then the people themselves must assume the
full responsibility for any unjustified war into
which their government leads them.
As President Jimmy Carter announces the
reinstatement of draft registration, we need to con
sider where the responsibility for the military con
flict which is sure to result will lie il we stand by
without protest as he drags us into a war designed
only to preserve our economic interests in the Mid
dle East.
We simply cannot repeat the mistakes of the past
and blindly support our country's overtures to
wards war in the present crisis. We must answer to
considerations of moral justification, got merely
economic expediency.
To give in to the pressures of friends, family or
public opinion, to make oneself a moral neutral is
just what conscription encourages. But to do so
also entails reducing oneself to a kind of animal,
useful but void of thought, feeling and judgement.
It betrays the worst sort of cowardice â€” the fear of
deciding for oneself the moral question of war and
acting upon that decision.
