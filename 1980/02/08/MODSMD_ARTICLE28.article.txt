Conservation helps
We may soon begin registra
tion lor the draft that will occur
should the Soviet Union advance
its threat to our Middle Eastern
oil supplies. We can oppose con
scription by reducing the amount
of energy which we now con
sume.
Conservation does not need to
involve sacrifice nor hardship.
We can ride bicycles or make use
of public transportation. Turn
off unnecessary lights in rooms,
dorm lounges, etc. Study in the
library where the lights are al
ready on. Turn back heat, wear
sweaters, the list goes on. By
conserving our way out of our oil
needs, we can avoid the con
sequences of what looks to be
another "unpopular" war.
Will American young people
have to die in the Middle East
before we change our energy
consumption habits enough to
substantially reduce our foreign
dependence? We should oppose
being drafted to fight for oil that
is not ours in the first place, and
we should support conservation
and energy alternatives so that
our "interests" in the Middle
East are not so "vital."

Draft is safeguard
The anti-draft demonstration
that took place here on campus
last Monday was good to see in
only one way that I can think of.
It was fantastic to finally see so
many students actively united
about something. Yet, I think
perhaps that those ralliers shout
ing "hell no, I won't go" should
reconsider their priorities a bit.
The message that President
Jimmy Carter sent to the Krem
lin in his State of the Union Ad
dress, that the Selective Service
System is to be revitalized,
should definitely give the leader
ship in Moscow something to
think about. Its implications are
purposely vague — the president
quite clearly is preparing for the
draft if it should be needed, but
he is not proposing it at this time.
He states that volunteer forces
are adequate for the United
States' current needs.
I very seriously doubt that the
all volunteer force would be
adequate, as do many in military
command. In starting the pre
draft mechanism of Selective
Service, the president is moving
toward a position where he won't
have to risk a test of the volun
teer force.

At the same time, the Soviets
cannot help but conclude that if
they plan military expeditions
threatening the Persian Gulf
area they will have to contend
with a conscripted American
force, the power of which they
surely cannot forget from World
War 11. But more importantly,
by clearing the way to reinstate
conscription. Carter implies to
the Russians that he does not
necessarily expect to rely on nuc
lear weapons to repel an assault
by them in the Persian Gulf reg
ion.
Consider this — when a coun
try's forces lack a wide base, the
widest possible base, of skills for
conventional war, the tendency
to resort to the nuclear option
becomes just that much more
difficult to avoid. To build
safeguards for the vital interests
of the United States, namely by a
first-class armed force drawn
from a cross-section of the popu
lation rather than by a further
build-up of nuclear weapons, is
what this nation needs. This is
what conscription delivers and is
definitely the wrong thing to be
demonstrating against.

Women opposed
Feminism is not a "laundry
list" of women's issues, but a set
of values, and a perspective on
the world that encompasses any
and all issues that touch our per
sonal and political lives.
As feminists, one of our de
mands has been equality — 1
equal rights and responsibilities
for women and men. We seek to
build a new society, a new world
in which this basic equality is a
fundamental value and not an af
terthought, as in President
Jimmy Carter's State of the
Union Address.
We believe there should be no
draft, no registration, for women
or men, now or at any time. A
demand for equal rights and re
sponsibilities does not mean that
we have an equal responsibility
to serve in an irresponsible war.
Neither women nor men should
register and be drafted.
It is not a question of whether
or not women are capable of
fighting. We are fighting now,
have always fought, and will con
tinue to fight on many fronts, in
many ways around the earth for
the right of all women and all
peoples to self-determination
and a healthful way of life.
But any war that will be an ef
fort to dominate and force into

subservience the sacred land,
lives and resources of the people
of the world is not a struggle for
liberation. The same mentality
that manifests itself in the rape of
women and our earth has now
produced this call for registra
tion, and will, if we allow it, pro
duce a new draft and a new war
that threatens — virtually en
sures — a nuclear holocaust.
Our fundamental value is the
giving, growth and preservation
of life, not its destruction. We
will not stand by and let a hand
ful of men in power, be they
American or Soviet, take charge
and determine the course of our
lives or threaten us with the de
struction of our species.
We urge all of you to refuse to
register for their war, and instead
to prepare yourselves both
spiritually and physically to ac
tively engage in the ongoing
struggle of women and the
world's peoples for self
determination. There is much to
be done.

Draft not needed
The draft apparently is a pe
rennial Democratic Party pet
project, and at their first oppor
tunity they push for its
reinstatement. I doubt Carter
feels he needs the draft so much
for his real foreign policy needs
as he wants it in order to im
prove his image of being a tough
leader.
It's a political gesture for
which millions are asked to sac
rifice an important part of their
personal lives. This sacrifice
gets draped in the slogan of duty
to your country, with the impli
cation that this is everybody's
duty. Well it isn't. It's a duty
expected during a time of na
tional defense but not in a time
of peace.
It's not as though we had no
enormous standing army al
ready. In time of real crisis,
there is no doubt that plenty of
Americans would come to the
defense of their country.
Let the draft be an instrument
that gets used only in time of
war. At the present we are at
peace. The draft is not needed,
and it certainly is not wanted by
those who would do the sacrific
ing.
