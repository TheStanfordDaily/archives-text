# Former Daily editors
## Has Daily forgotten Vietnam? 
### 
Of all the evil institutions
sponsored by the American gov
ernment over the years, the drat t
has been the most shameful.
Conscription is the old, the rich
and the powerful sending the
young, the poor and the power
less to die: it is foul slavery and
nothing more. And it is to the
dishonor of every single member
of the Daily editorial board that
the paper has chosen to call for
the revival of this barbaric and
unmourned practice.
As former Daily editors, we
are at a complete loss to under
stand the Jan. 30 editorial in
which the paper joined the shrill
war hysteria sweeping this coun
try and called tor the enslave
ment ot fellow students. Editors
and staffs have come and gone
over the years, but the Daily has
in recent decades stood for a
noninterventionist foreign policy
and against compulsory service
to the absurd jingoist concept of
America as policeman to the
world.
Now in one fell swoop, the
Daily has renounced both.
The editorial based its justifi
cation of renewed draft registra
tion on the same unfounded
claims currently being advanced
by the most bloodthirsty of the

Republican presidential Condi
dates; namely, that the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan is the first
ot a series of moves to sei/e the
entire Persian Gulf.
There is not a shred of evi
dence to support this contention.
If the Soviets intended to annex
the whole region, the tanks could
already have rolled into Iran;
certainly there is nothing to stop
them. None of us condone this
Soviet aggression, but neither do
we see it as sufficient reason to
leap headlong into World War
111.
Nor is it any reason to bring
back a monstrous practice that
was abandoned only after it
twisted and nearly destroyed an
entire generation.
Can it be that the Daily lias
forgotten that not so long ago an
ASSU president chose to rot in a
federal prison rather than submit
to the immorality of the draft?
Can it be that the Daily has for
gotten the thousands of people
who were gassed and beaten in
the streets of Chicago because
they dared to gather and protest
the draft and the evil war that it
made possible?
Can it be that the Daily has
forgotten the countless young
men who fled home, family and

friends to avoid imprisonment in
the war machine? Has the Daily
forgotten the awful image of the
young woman crying beside a
slain student at Kent State?
Did the Daily forget the
56.000 Americans who were kil
led in the jungles of Vietnam,
and the untold hundreds of
thousands who came home phys
ically or psychologically crip
ples?
Anyone who has trouble recal
ling need only visit the nearest
VA hospital to see the young
men in their wheelchairs and
with their colostomy bags. Ask
them if it was "a necessary
price." to use the Daily's
euphemistic phrasing.
No decent society enslaves,
mutilates and murders its young.
The draft was an indispensable
tool in all three. Are today's col

lege students so shallow and
forgetful that this lesson has
been lost? We don't believe so.
Don't let the Daily or anyone
else convince you to cooperate in
your own enslavement. Struggle
every step ot the way to keep the
right to live your own life. The
last generation paid an agoniz
ing price for that freedom: don t
throw it all away.

by the most bloodthirsty of the

Republican presidential Condi
dates; namely, that the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan is the first
ot a series of moves to sei/e the
entire Persian Gulf.
There is not a shred of evi
dence to support this contention.
If the Soviets intended to annex
the whole region, the tanks could
already have rolled into Iran;
certainly there is nothing to stop
them. None of us condone this
Soviet aggression, but neither do
we see it as sufficient reason to
leap headlong into World War
111.
Nor is it any reason to bring
back a monstrous practice that
was abandoned only after it
twisted and nearly destroyed an
entire generation.
Can it be that the Daily lias
forgotten that not so long ago an
ASSU president chose to rot in a
federal prison rather than submit
to the immorality of the draft?
Can it be that the Daily has for
gotten the thousands of people
who were gassed and beaten in
the streets of Chicago because
they dared to gather and protest
the draft and the evil war that it
made possible?
Can it be that the Daily has
forgotten the countless young
men who fled home, family and

friends to avoid imprisonment in
the war machine? Has the Daily
forgotten the awful image of the
young woman crying beside a
slain student at Kent State?
Did the Daily forget the
56.000 Americans who were kil
led in the jungles of Vietnam,
and the untold hundreds of
thousands who came home phys
ically or psychologically crip
ples?
Anyone who has trouble recal
ling need only visit the nearest
VA hospital to see the young
men in their wheelchairs and
with their colostomy bags. Ask
them if it was "a necessary
price." to use the Daily's
euphemistic phrasing.
No decent society enslaves,
mutilates and murders its young.
The draft was an indispensable
tool in all three. Are today's col

lege students so shallow and
forgetful that this lesson has
been lost? We don't believe so.
Don't let the Daily or anyone
else convince you to cooperate in
your own enslavement. Struggle
every step ot the way to keep the
right to live your own life. The
last generation paid an agoniz
ing price for that freedom: don t
throw it all away.
