## Conscription tied to intervention 
### 
The call by President Jimmy
Carter tor a return to draft re
gistration was inevitable. Given
the current U.S. defense posture
of protecting our "vital in
terests" everywhere, there is no
way to carry out our threats
without having lots of bodies to
hack them up. Afghanistan just
happened to be the trigger this
time; it would have happened
anyway with some other excuse.
As Milton Mueller wrote in
The Draft: The Dynamics of So
cial Control, "Conscription is
both a cause and an effect of im
perialism — it is required to sus
tain a large, global force, yet its
presence makes rampant milit

ary intervention all too easy."
The excuse this time for
threatening intervention in the
Middle East is our "oil lifeline."
But why are we so dependent on
Middle Eastern oil? We are
hooked on imported petroleum
because of the economic inter
vention at home that has dis
couraged production and con
servation and encouraged im
ports.
A particularly outrageous
example is the entitlements
program, which has subsidized
imports hy requiring payments
from refiners using domestic oil
to refiners using imported oil. It
is this kind of economic nonsense

masquerading as an energy pol
icy tiiat has encouraged our oil
appetite and made the Middle
East so vital.
If we end price controls, sub
sidies and allocation programs,
allowing prices to reflect real
conditions of scarcity in the
world today, our foreign depen
dence would decline, and indi
viduals would be free to conserve
energy in ways that they — not
an authoritarian government —
find agreeable. And we would
not be preparing to send con
scripted Americans to defend
the far corners of the American
Empire.
The only way we are going to

effectively drive home the mes
sage to Carter and the Congress
that IS to 26 year olds are not a
"national resource" to he
thrown into defense of the em
pire is to refuse to cooperate. It is
well and good to write to Con
gresspeople, to hold rallies and
marches, to call radio talk shows,
and to speak out whenever pos
sible. Hut we must recall the les
son of the Vietnam era: in the
end it was resistance — not
Richard Nixon, not the Gates
Commission, not the Congress
— that put a temporary end to
the draft.
The Department of Defense,
whose name should be restored
to the Department of War, has
acknowledged in a 1977 report
called "The Status of the All
Volunteer Force" that this tactic
could stop them by making the
costs of conscription tot) high:
"Enforcement is a key issue in
peace-time registration. If most
young men register then costs
could be low and enforcement
could be ignored except for iso
lated instances of flagrant viola
tion such as a public display of
resistance. Should the registra
tion meet widespread resistance
and strict enforcement be or
dered, costs could be very high.
Major resistance to registration
could adversely affect voluntary
enlistment and seriously aggra
vate all-volunteer-force re
cruitment difficulties."
We must attack the American
Empire at its roots: the economic
intervention that leads to foreign
dependence on oil, and the
treatment of people as resources
to prop up the empire. The only
alternative is to acknowledge
that our lives are the property of
the State. We have no choice but
to resist.
