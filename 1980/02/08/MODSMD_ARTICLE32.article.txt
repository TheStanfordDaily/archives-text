## Draft card burning wrong 
### 
As a Stanford graduate I was
ashamed to see in the
Washington paper Jan. 26, a pic
ture of Stanford students burn
ing a large draft card — with
other students, according to the
article, applauding the action.
Use of freedom is one thing;
abuse of freedom is another. If
you so-called adult students can
not see the difference between
the Russian invasion of Af
ghanistan and exiling Sakharov
by such a police state and our
need to dramatize the signifi
cance of recent events by taking
our own actions, then you are
indeed not worthy to be in col
lege let alone be Stanford stu
dents.
Have you forgotten, or have
you not even heard the motto,
"Let the winds of freedom
blow?" Does that mean starting
the asinine actions again that you
or your predecessors used, burn
)

ing and destroying property dur
ing the Vietnam War?
The symbolism of burning a
draft card is wrong. It is an act
calculated to arouse tempers, ex
citement, comparisons with the
Vietnam situation, and other in
cidents which have caused this
country to become weak and soft
and ripe for the type of actions
which the Soviet Union is now
taking.
I am no more happy that my
son has to register if the bill pas
ses, and that he could be drafted,
than you are. On the other hand,
I hope, and so should you, that if
we regain our resolve now by
showing Russia we mean busi
ness, by boycotting the Olym
pics, by refusing to sell grain, by
shutting off the technology trans
fer and by starting registration to
indicate that we will mobilize if
necessary, maybe, just maybe,
the Russians will start to back
down from their obvious designs

on most of the free world's oil.
I could rationalize Stanford
students' actions during the Vie
tnam war, and I certainly can
support your right to protest
draft registration by demonstra
tions, by letter writing, by rallies,
etc. However, symbolic acts of
burning are fascist in nature and
all of you know it. This time I do
not believe you have a leg to
stand on.
Further, if the University au
thorities cannot control activities
this time better than they did
during the last protests I would
not be surprised to see a very
unfavorable reaction toward the
entire Stanford complex.
Tyranny by the minority is not
something to be proud of and
acts of burning are just that —
tyrannical!
