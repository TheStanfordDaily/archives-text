# Students seek past in heat and cold

Stanford students hoping to
join a summer archeological ex
pedition have a choice two ex
tremes.
They can freeze in the Andes
Mountains of South America or
hake in the Mediterranean sun.
Six undergraduates will spend
nine weeks this summer helping
Asst. Anthropology Prof. John
Rick to excavate a Stone Age
cave site high in the Peruvian
Andes, 100 miles northeast of
Lima.
"It's a tough area," Kick
warned, scratching his scruffy
heard. "The altitude and cold
make for a brutal, if rewarding.

experience."
In his heavy flannel shirt. Rick
looked like a tough and wiry
mountain man.
"This is what you call real dirt
archeology," he said with a hint
of Excitement in his voice.
At 14,000 feet above sea level,
the air is thin and at night temp
eratures plunge to less than 10
degrees Farenheit.
Ranch
The group will live in the un
heated cinderblock headquar
ters of a government
cooperative sheep ranch. There
will he no hot water and only
intermittent electricity.
The students will spend much
of their time on hands and knees
digging through what Kick

claims is one of the most impor
tant and productive cave sites in
the New World.
I le said the site may contain as
many as half n million stone tools
left by a small, sedentary society
of hunter-gatherers ,"ho oc
cupied the area from ibout
10,000 B.C. to 500 A.D.
And, in Greece
Also this summer, in the Old
World, eight Stanford students
will join Classics Prof. Michael
Jameson for a six-week ar
cheological survey of Greece's
southern Argolid Peninsula on
the Aegean Sea.
Jameson's group will brave
daytime temperatures exceeding
100 degrees Farenheit to explore

the remains of 25,000 years of
human habitation.
"We're not making any
claims," Jameson cautioned in a
soft but enthusiastic tone. "It's
like an experiment in which you
don't know what you have until
all the evidence is in.
"We will he living in a seaside
village," he continued. "It's very
simple but very adequate."
City-stale
Jameson and his wife, Vir
ginia, also a classicist, have been
working in the area since 1950.
Some of their major projects
have been the excavation of a
Stone Age cave and a small
Greek city-state.
For the first time last year,
Jameson and Geology Prof.

Tjeerd van Andel led Stanford
students on a more general sur
vey of the archeology, geology,
botany and anthropology ol the
peninsula. The effort involves
more walking than digging.
Jameson outlined a typical
day.
Up at 6:30 a.m., the party will
leave the village an hour later.
Two groups will spread out and
walk systematically over the
landscape for about live hours in
search of sites and artifacts.
'Junk'
"The artifacts are unglamor
ous," Jameson admitted. "This is
just junk picked up on the sur
face. Hut it'svery revealing when
studied properly."

As the afternoon sun grows
unbearably hot, the group will
return to the seaside village with
a booty of pottery pieces. Weary
students will lunch and take a
break to go swimming, nap, write
letters or read.
The cooler evenings will be
spent cleaning, recording and
analyzing the day's evidence.
"We discuss it all the time,"
Jameson said.
Meanwhile, half a world away,
life for Rick's group up in the
Andes won't be so relaxed.
Lack of privacy
Rick said his students will start
with a short study of Peruvian
archeology in Lima, but after
that "there will be little privacy
or comfort." Their base camp

has no bathing facilities.
He explained that students
will work for 10 days at a time
then break for a few days of
travel to nearby sites and towns.
"About every two weeks we
just get so fed up with being cold
and dirty that anybody would
head for a hot bath." Rick said.
Thus refreshed, the party will
be able to enjoy for a few days
the movie theaters, markets and
"knock-down drag-out" festi
vals in nearby towns.
Rick started working in the
area in 1973. Me and his wife,
Rosa, also an archeologist, met
when she was a field supervisor
of Peruvian students on the dig.
First year
"This is going to be the first
year of major excavation," he
said. "I'm hoping to dig the site
as long as 1 can over the next five
or 10 years,"
Primary goals this year will in
clude mapping of artifacts on an
cient living floors, excavation ol
huts and burials and recovery of.
stone tools and plant and animal
remains.
Students may also be hiking
into areas where archeologists
have not yet ventured, looking
for ruins and more cave sites.
Well-off
Rick said he has pieced to
gether a picture of prehistoric
life in the area. Although most
modern hunter-gatherers
studied by anthropologists have
been very poor, lie indicated that
the ancient inhabitants of the
high Peruvian grasslands were
compa rat i vel y well -off.
The non-seasonal climate, ab
sence of forests for animals to
hide in and a stable supply ol
game all contributed to a small,
unchanging society of sedentary
hunter-gatherers. Rick
explained.
Students will be required to
take a field archeology course at
Stanford in the spring, "to gain
experience getting dirty and hav
ing to deal with very tedious
work," Rick said.
The cost of the program will be
equivalent to that of one quarter
at Stanford and students will re
ceive 15 units of credit for their
experiences.
Jameson's Stanford-on-Ihe-
Aegean program will cost only
the price of air fare and students
may earn credit when they return
in the autumn if pap
ers about their work.
Both the Peruvian and Ae
geon programs will be offered to
Stanford students next summer.

summer.
