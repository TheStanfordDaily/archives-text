# ON CALL

### 
So. On Call has been spared from an uncere
monious demise. Although I won't mention
numbers, the response to last week's plea was
unanimously favorable. I didn't, however, re
ceive any questions, so today's column will be
on the brief side.
I've been going with someone for a lon t i> time,
and we've decided to break up. My biggest con
cern is that we ha ve a lot of mutual friends, and /
feel like I'm being forced to sever all my connec
tions with them as well. I low should / handle this
awkward situation'.'
-Broken Up
Cowell counselors say that intimate relation
ships problems are the most common difficul
ties they encounter among students. They em
phasized that, as trite and as insensitive as it may
seem, time does heal the wounds of broken
relationships. In fact, they said, the recovery
time from an acute grief reaction is around six
weeks.
On the heels of a break-up. most people pass
through several stages on the way to objectivity
and lull recuperation. I irst comes disbelief and
often denial followed by self-blame and/or
anger. Most devastating can be the questioning
of one's own judgment and a loss of confidence
in ability to make choices.
Reassuring parents and friends are frequently
sources of frustration and irritation during such
times. Whether supportive or denigrating, they
may inadvertantly compound problems by
polarizing themsebes.
Residual effects, such as you have cited, are
long-range in scope and need to be seriously
discussed. One change doesn't have to alter
your whole lifestyle unless you desire it. Many
individuals will rebound from the end of one
association to immediately bond with another
person or peers. Not to deride that, I would

advise that rushing into another entanglement
could be an unfilling waste of time.
It's hard to see clearly when directly involved
in a situation. You may he contused and uncer
tain. Express \our feelings openly to your
friends. If you feel uncomfortable in the pre
sence of your ex-boyfriend or girlfriend, you
should make \ our other acquaintances aware of
that sentiment. Mull your ideas over.
I'm curious. What's the biggest problem or
question faced by doctors at Cowell?
-Carious George
I ley. George, are you a cymbal-bearing
monkey? I just had to ask. Please pardon that
aside.
Dr. Phil Gelpi said that his major concern is
that people are so preoccupied with trivial
health matters that the\'re missing out on the
more important aspects of life. A question he
hears often is "How often should I have a physi
cal check-up?" His response is "not very often.
Check-ups are extremely commercialized and
expensive. Their cost-benefit ratios are high.
Youdon't need yearly check-upsuntil you're4o
or 50 or unless you suffer from a bad chronic
disease."
Dr. John Dohrman said that more students
ask him about flatulence, or gas in the intestinal
system, than anything else. His reply is that, as
gas is caused by swallowing air, one afflicted by
such inconvenience should avoid chewing gum,
eating fast and consuming mass amounts of food
while under stress, and drinking large quantities
of water with meals.
