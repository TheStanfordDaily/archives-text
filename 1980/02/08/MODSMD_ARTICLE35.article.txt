# Cards need poise
## Cougars crash Farm 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
The Stanford men's basketball
team, which lost to the Pae-10's
Arizona schools last week, re
turns to Maples Pavillion this
weekend to host the Washington
State Cougars in Saturday even
ing cage action. Tip-oft time is
scheduled for K:O5 p.m.
The Cardinals, alter their
fruitless trip south, will limp back
into Maples Saturday facing not
only a 1-10 conference record,
hut'-also the number three team
in*title Pac-10 — a quick, high
scoring Cougar squad. Stanford
has been floundering in the con
ference cellar ever since losing to
California a month ago. A
couple more losses could very
well lock the basement door.
But the Cards have been wiley
and slick in defeat these last few
weeks, and have shown quite a
bit of tenacity for a team so far
out of contention. Head coach
Dick Dißiaso masterminded a
stall-with-the-ball game plan
which almost upset Oregon State
List week and the team played
quite respectably against
Arizona, taking the Wildcats
into overtime. They ran witji
Pac-10 co-leader Arizona State
and only lost by 13 points.
"Without question, this past
weekend was the best sustained
effort by the Stanford basketball
team this vear." Dißiaso s;nd.

"ln fact, you may have to go back
a couple of years to match this
performance. Obviously, we
would have liked to come back
with one or two w ins. but I tli'mk
we're showing progress at least."
"It it's possible to feel good at
all about the season. I do." he
added.
After tumbling to the worst
start in the school's history with
an overall record ol 3-lb. it's
hard to imagine that it is at all
possible to feel good about Stan
lord basketball. But Dißiaso.
undaunted, said. "I'm obviously
not pleased with the record, but I
am pleased with the improve
ment. We're progressing."
Senior power forward Kim
berly Belton. who needs only
HW points in seven games to
surpass Claude Terry (15hh
points) as Stanford's all-time
scoring champion, had 44 points
and 24 rebounds in Arizona. The
only legitimate star on the Card's
roster. Belton finds it hard to
share his coach's sanguinity after
last weekend's trip.
"I can't feel any better," said
the ft-7 Belton. "We haven't won
a game. We've looked better but
you can't feel satisfied unless you
win. It's frustrating, it's really
Irustrating."
Frustrating it must be for a
team which, game after game,
comes close but can't quite get a
lock on a victory. Every time

they fight back on the court, a
travelling call or a blown pass
breaks the bubble and the other
team runs away again. Stanford
has some talent and discipline
but mostly the team harbors in
experience. It lacks that crucial
end ol t lie same poise so charac
teristic ol gi>otf college basket
ball teams.
Nevertheless, the Cards have a
handle on underdog spirit and
that is a commodity which can
perk up and surprise any body —
maybe Wahington State.
Stanford knows what to expect
from the Cougars who blasted
them 102-74 last month in
Pullman. W SI .coached by vete
ran George Daveling. is playing
excellent, quick basketball this
season and with a 7-3 conference
record (15-4 overall) the team is
securly in third place. They
showed some vulnerability last
weekythough. when they squan
dered an I 1 point lead and were
upset by Washington.
Washington State's major
weapon is ft-ft senior Don Col
lins. one ol the best forwards in
the country. He had his best
game of the season last month
against Stanford, posting 34
points and 10 rebounds. He is
shooting 60 percent from the
held this year. Particularly im
portant to Stanford, because ol
its dependency Belton"s inside
game, is Collin's 3.1 stealing av

erage.
Also, guards Terry Kelly and
Bryan Rison score regularly,
each averaging about 12 points a
game.
Overall, the Cougars arc last
and experienced, a solid team.

All five starters are seniors,
which lends a lot ol stability to
the program and the Cardinals
simply have to play an excellent
game to beat them. They have to
play poised basketball.
"Washington State has a lot ol
offenses and multiple defenses."
Dißiaso said. "They are \ery
last. It will be important to con
trol the tempo of the game, not
like last time where the half-time
score was 41-41. That's too high
a score."
Belton. who was found work
ing overtime on his tree-throws
Wednesday agreed with his
coach. "They'll come out quick
so we'll have to control the ball
on offense." he said. /
Wednesday was coach Di-
Biaso" s birthday and it's certain
he vvoultj no better present
than a win this weekend. Unfor
tunately. hope does not make a
victory. The Cards will have to
play their best basketball to give
it to him.
