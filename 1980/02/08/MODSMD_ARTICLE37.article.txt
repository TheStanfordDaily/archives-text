# The
						Friday Interview
## Mark Marquess 
### 
Baseball coach Mark Mar
quess travels to Sun Luis Obispo
this weekend looking to extend
his tennis 5-0 winning streak.
Winning seems to be an old habit
for the 32-year-old Stanford
grad. As a player, lie led the
school to the College Baseball
World Series in 1967 playing first
base and is listed in the top 10 of
Jour career record categories
here. After five years of pro
baseball, he returned to the Farm
as a coach where he has compiled
a 113-66 record in three years,
placing liim third on the all-time
winning percentage ranking. The
coach agreed to grant this Friday
Inteniew with Robert Stone de
spite a sadden illness.
Stone: A re you surprised by your
team 's good start, or did you ex
pect it?
Marquess: Well, actually,! didn't
expect it. We have a young team,
and the pitching staff is inexperi
enced. 1 thought we had a good
team, hut I'm surprised how well
we've done.
Stone: Speaking of the team's
youth, do you see that inexperi
ence Inning an effect on their play
this year?
Marquess: Yes, no doubt about
it. We have a tine group of
freshmen, such as Dotterer,
Elway and Buechele, but we
have to see what they'll be able
to do in our league. It's tough for
freshmen, they're going against
good pitchers with good arms.
When you have as young a team
as we do you just have to be pa

you get a group of freshmen as
good as we have this year. I think
that this group ot freshmen is the -
best that Stanford has ever had.
Stone: Do you foresee tiny prob
lems with Dotterer and Elway
participating in both baseball and
football?
Marquess: No, not really. The
philosophy here is whoever
wants to do both can. It's the
same as playing football and
running track, something that a
lotofguysdo. It will definitely be
busy for them when spring foot
ball starts, but I think they can do
both. I haven't talked to coach
Wiggin about it. but I don't see
any problems.
Stone: What do you consider the
team's greatest strengths and?,
weaknesses? ' i
Marquess: 1 would think that our
strengths are defense and overall
team speed â€” everyone is run
ning well. We have more power
this year than the last couple of '
years, more power hitting the
ball. As tor weaknesses, I'd have
to say youth, the inexperience of '
the pitching staff, and the limited
depth of the pitching "staff. It
could be worse, we could have a
lot of juniors and seniors without
talent. We're very optimistic, as '
long as we don't get discouraged 1
or get down mentally we'll be a
lot better team at the end of the "
season.
Stone: What does the competition
took like in the Pac-10 this year'.ljr|
Marquess: Our league is sucnSg
that everyone beats everyonffl
