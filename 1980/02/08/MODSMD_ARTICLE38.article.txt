tient and wait tor them to adjust.
Stone: Are you looking ahead to
strong teams in the future?
Marquess: I think so. we'll defi
nitely have a better team next
year, we're only losing one
pitcher next year (Larry Kulin),
so I think we'll be a good team in
the upcoming years. Rarely do

else up. I think that this is defi
nitely the strongest conference in
the nation. There are other gooff"
teams in the country, but I think
that all six teams in our confer
ence (Pac-10 Southern Di\ ision)
could be in the top 10. A team
like Arizona State used to be
50-9 in their other conference;
now they lose 20 games a season.
A good record is 20-10. You
look at last year's record and say
we were 35-23, hut in out-of
league play we were 22-6.
There's nobody that really
dominates the league. Last year
UCLA came here ranked first
and we beat them two out of
three, and it could have been

three out of three. It's like put
ting Michigan, Texas and Ohio
State in the same football con
ference. A lot of people don't
realize that on our team we have
a first round draft pick (freshman
third baseman Steve Buechele).
All the guys in our league could
play pro ball.
Stone: Are you satisfied with the
wuv the program has developed

in your tenure as coach?
Marquess: I really am. Our goal
is to win the league, but we have
problems realizing that with the
admissions limitations. They're
positive limitations, though. We
have to find players who have
good grades, and it's a tough
challenge. The program has got
ten better, but the competition's
gotten tougher. If we have more
good recruiting years things will
get better. It's never going to be
easy in the league no matter
what, though. It used to be that
USC' could dominate, hut not

any more. There's no more
domination.
Stone: Is it difficult to recruit
players for the team?
Marquess: Sure, it's tough. We
were recruiting three ot the best
pitchers in the league lust year:
one guy didn't make it through
admissions and went to Arizona
State, one guy signed with the
Mets, and one guy we signed hut
lost him in August to the pros.
That happens, though. As a
coach you can use it as an excuse,
hut it he's a good student he's
tiointi to want to come to Stan

lord. You can't afford to lose the
ones with good grades .
Stone: What is your philosophy
about baseball at Stanford?
Marquess: My feeling is to strive
for excellence, academically and
in baseball. It's very tough for
the players, it'sdemanding. They
have to keep up with their work
and put three hours out on the
field January through May. I feel
that it's my obligation to make
the players the best they can be.
We work hard, hustle, and give
I 00 percent at all times. It's fun,
though.
