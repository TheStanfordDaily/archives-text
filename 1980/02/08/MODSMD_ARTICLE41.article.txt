# Cardinal batmen to face Mustangs
## 
### Peter Finch Staff Writer 
Riding on the crest of a live
game winning streak, Stanford
baseball coach Mark Marquess
takes his relatively inexperi
enced crew to Cal-Poly San Luis
Obispo this weekend for the
team's first away games of the
season.
While hardly leading his team
into rough waters. Marquess is
fully aware that C'al Poly could
easily hand his team a surprise
upset.
"They're usually a good
team," Marquess said. "And
they're hard to play down there,
too. They graduated a few guys
from last year's team, but 1 know
they have several good junior
college transfers."
Cal Poly's biggest offensive
threat is junior Dennis Fertig

(.545 batting average). Junior
Bill White (.444) and sopho
more Paul Hert/ler (.364) are
other key batters for the Mus
tangs.
Juniors Tod Jensen and Stew
Hein, both 1-0 after three
games, are the Mustangs top
pitchers.
Lee Cline (2-0, 0.0 ERA),
Larry Kuhn (1-0) and Brian
Mignano will be on the mound
for the Cards this weekend. So
far this season, the Cardinal
pitching staff has done surpris
ingly well. Last year the squad
was criticized for its frequent in
efficiency, but this year things
seem to be going more their way.
"So far so good," coach Mar
quess said in reference to his
pitchers. "We've already got a
shut-out and we could have had a
couple more. If our pitchers con

tinue to do as well as they have,
we could really surprise some
people."
True to form, Stanford has
performed well offensively so far
this season. Freshman left fielder
Mike Dotterer leads the team
with his .5X3 batting average and
6 RBl's. Senior second baseman
Paul Zuvella, four for 10 from
the plate, ranks second with an
even .400 average. Overall, the
Cards are batting .314.
Stanford's present winning
streak is also true to form. Tradi
tionally, the Cards fare excep
tionally well in pre-confergnce
play, but falter by comparison
once the league games begin.
This, of course, is largely due to a
highly competitive conference,
which includes both Arizona
schools, UCLA, USC, Cal and
Stanford.
"We're in by far the best
league in the country," Mar
quess explained. "It's pretty

hard to predict how well we'll do
in it this year, but we won't do
poorly."
League competition begins
February 29th. Until then. Mar
quess must prepare his players
for the changes they can expect.
"We have a good three weeks
to get read.." Marquess said.
"We'll play some good teams.
(By the time the season starts)
we'll be as ready as we ever will.
But we'll get better as we go. We
are starting a minimum of three
freshman, som imes four, out
there. As long we don't lose
our confidence we'll do all
right."
But right now, the most impor
tant thing is fiis weekend's
series.
" This is our first road game
and it will be a good test for us."
Marquess said. "We beat them
twice last year — two close
games — and I'll bet they'reanx
ious to get us."

even .400 average. Overall, the
Cards are batting .314.
Stanford's present winning
streak is also true to form. Tradi
tionally, the Cards fare excep
tionally well in pre-confergnce
play, but falter by comparison
once the league games begin.
This, of course, is largely due to a
highly competitive conference,
which includes both Arizona
schools, UCLA, USC, Cal and
Stanford.
"We're in by far the best
league in the country," Mar
quess explained. "It's pretty

hard to predict how well we'll do
in it this year, but we won't do
poorly."
League competition begins
February 29th. Until then. Mar
quess must prepare his players
for the changes they can expect.
"We have a good three weeks
to get read.." Marquess said.
"We'll play some good teams.
(By the time the season starts)
we'll be as ready as we ever will.
But we'll get better as we go. We
are starting a minimum of three
freshman, som imes four, out
there. As long we don't lose
our confidence we'll do all
right."
But right now, the most impor
tant thing is fiis weekend's
series.
" This is our first road game
and it will be a good test for us."
Marquess said. "We beat them
twice last year — two close
games — and I'll bet they'reanx
ious to get us."
