# Ruark shines on; Cards lose big one
## 
### Jennifer Seymour Staff Writer 
A close score does not always
mean evenly-matchcd teams.
But in Wednesday night's
women's basketball game
against UC-Berkeley. it did.
In fact, a final score of 87-85 in
Berkeley's favor does injustice
to Stanford. The Cards were
leading by one in overtime until
the last !(■> seconds of play.
Rubbing salt in the wound of
this defeat was Stanford's impre
ssive comeback in the second
half. Cal led by 1 1 points at
halftimc. with a score of 37-26.
That score was tied by the end of
the game, forcing the match into
17 minutes ot overtime play.
Said forward Jeanne Ruark
about the comeback. "It wasn't a
•crucial play' thing, just a
basket-for-basket play. Then we
started shooting well.
"Cathy Schultz really did it at
the end. She put in three clutch
baskets at the end that were re
ally important."
Ruark led the team in scoring,
accumulating 39 points on 15
field goals and 9-for-ll tree
throw shooting. Behind her was
center Kim Kupferer, with 13
points. A distant third in the
scoring was forward Cathy Mur

phy. making five points.
Despite the seeming imba
lance in point scoring, coach
Dotty McCrea was very pleased
with individual performances:
"What was really neat was that
other people wanted to shoot be
sides Jeanne. Cathy Murphy
grabbed so many rebounds. It
was the best total effort all sea
son. We're really pleased with
the game."
Ruark added that. "Whenever
we play Cal. it's always very
close. We were really psyched.
Both teams are very close in abil
ity. Berkeley's really aggressive.
They even beat Sail Jose State."
Thre result of this game, in
combination with Cat's domina
tion over San Jose State, puts
UC-Berkeley in second place,
with San Jose State and Stanford
tied for third in the NorCal
League.
The aggressive play Ruark re
ferred to is reflected in the
number of fouls committed in
the game: 24 for the Cards. 23
for the Bears.
Says coach McCrea about her
team's playing, "We didn't lay
down and die. not once. We kept
on pushing. Cal just happened to
put the last bucket m."
What ultimately sunk Stan

tord?" It's hard to say what made
the difference. Playing at a
foreign court maybe gave them
the edge. But we played great. It
was a total team effort," said
McCrea.
A look at Cal's stats also pro
vides some tell-tale evidence.

Though Stanford's free-throw
percentages were far superior to
the Bears' — 21-30 vs. 13-26 —
Cal's scoring attack was much
more balanced. Their top four
scorers, Weddick, Galloway,
Ciarrett and Cameron, put in 31,
22, II and II points, respec
tively.
