The Day the Earth Stood Still
♦ * *
Thursday, Bishop And. 7:30 p.m.
Even with the past decade's re
naissance ill the science fiction
movie. this tightly constructed film
from the '50s holds its position as
one of the best of the genre. A man
from another planet brings a
chance for peace on Earth; he is
met with only misunderstanding
and fear. It can be viewed as a con
demnation of McC'arthyism or as a
nun ie fulfilling the desire to create
modern myth. Whatever one reads
into the movie, it remains consis
tently entertaining. Julian Blaus
tein. now a faculty member ol the
Stanford communication depart
ment. produced.
Jim Mattson
Kramer vs. Kramer ir it it
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
11 off man and a youngster of almost
Irighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs oft
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep"s extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars. and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

The Gold Rush * * * *
Saturday-Sunday, New Varsity
A fully realized comedy of ex
traordinary charm and grace. Char
lie Chaplin is in full command of his
surely awesome talents in this 1 925
effort; this movie about Chaplin's
adventures in the forbidden wil
derness is among the most honored
of all time. Mel Brooks' Silent
Movie is also on the bill.
— R.L.
The Black Hole -*
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion picture
space race with a brilliant plunge
into the world of outer space spe
cial effects, and falls Hat on its face.
The effects are fun in the begin
ning. but the wires soon become
obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a

cross between Star Wars' R2-D2
and a beer keg. The movie plays
like Captain Nemo in space, and
tlje religious overtones probably
have Dante spinning in his grave.
— Simon Labov
Moonraker *
Menlo, Menlo Park
Sunday. Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
Formula James Bond — it looks
as if this movie were made from a
recipe instead of from a script.
Take one dose of Roger Moore
(whatever you say. I still like Con
ncry better), one major Jemme
fatale (in this case l.ois Chiles, who
seems fine right up until she
speaks), and a gimmicky plot, and
you can make your very own James
Bond movie.
Moonraker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is earthbound
for two solid hours — even the
patented in-the-sack last scene
seems affected by fatigue. The Spy
Who Loved Me. the last Bond
movie, was watchable: skip thisone
and wait for something better to
come along.
— J.M.
The Seven-I'er-Cent Solution
it -kit
Friday, New Varsity
Herbert Ross directed this fine
adaptation of Nicholas Meyer's
novel. Sherlock Holmes hooks up
with Sigmund Freud in Vienna; the
result is high-style fun. The per
formances sparkle, and Ross hand
les things with a surprisingly fine
touch. Nicol Williamson plays
Ifolmes. Alan Arkin stars as Freud.
Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave
and — as a wonderfully comic Mor
iartv — Laurence Olivier are also
teatured. Time After Time, written
and directed by Meyer is also on
Friday's double bill. Time stars
Malcolm McDowell and David
Warner.
—R.L.
Le Million ★ ★ ★ ★
Wednesday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
This 1930 Rene Clair comedy
has been re-made in various forms
literally hundreds of times, and no
wonder; the comedy premise is an
archetypal one — a crazed group ol
people chase altera million dollars,
in this instance in the form of a lost
lottery ticket. Clair uses every pos
sible effect in tins wonderful movie.
With Rene Lefebreafid Annabella.
— R.L.
Love and Death * * *
Friday, Kresge 7:30 and 9:30
Woody Allen spends a lot of time
talking to himself about wild
metaphysical possibilities — the re
sults are decidedly mixed. This
movie was made right lifter Sleeper
and right before Annie Hall: it
would be a mistake to say that this
effort is a bridge between the two. but
there's lots to keep you interested just
the same. Woody drifts through a
neo-Tolstoian plot, and Diane Keaton
meanders along.
— R.L.

Harold and Maude . * * *
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and in the inherent goodness
ol humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals are played by Bud C'ort
and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens round out the soundtrack.
— J.M.
Strangers on u Train * ■* * *
Monday. Cuhherley 7 p.m.
This 1951 thriller ranks as one ol
the best of Hitchcock's Ameri
can" movies. The master's plotting
is a bit more complicated than
usual — an implicit homosexual

element is even thrown in. Bruno
(Robert Walker, in a delicious per
formance) kills an unhappily mar
ried stranger's wife, and he expects
him to return the favor by killing
Bruno's father. Farley Granger
plays Guy. the stranger. Raymond
Chandler helped on the screenplay.
Leo (i. Carroll and Patricia Hitch
cock co-star, dreed, one of Erich
Von Stroheim's most wildly am
bitious pictures, makes up the sec
ond half on Monday's double bill.
— R. 1..
Star Trek * *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A mechan
ical creation of man comes hack to

haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
ol the Enterprise's crew members
saves civ ilization by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner.
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest ot the movie is
like a greatest hits ol Douglas
I rumbull and John Dykstra's pre
vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.
R.I
The Hose ★
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version

of A Star is Horn, except that this
one is clothed wi{h a, 1969 setting
and centered (in a H/af acter vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to '69. and without those Vou'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin s form ol
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic F or
rest or Alan Bates. Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little

too late.

Apocalypse Sow ** * *
Century 24, San Jose
An amazing work ol mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director I raneisC oppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gency in his reworking ol Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella heart oj
Darkness: he employs C'onrad'scs
sential narrative but not his point ol
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer \ ittorio Storaro.
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Sow is. I think,
the best American movie ol the
just-ended decade. It has almost

untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming crazincss
of this"impossible." almost nihilis
tic. vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando. Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.
— R.L.
1941 * * *
Park. Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion'for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a lov ing expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. L ike a
Stennett or Lloyd two-rceler. 1941

is all up front: bodies fly all-too
frequcntly and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
I hat ma) partially explain the very
harsh reaction ot most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may he
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi, and Dan Aykroyd. Treat Wil
liams. loshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as (ieneral "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumho as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— K.L.
Electric Horseman * * *
Ylenlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent ol a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle, l aded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate: he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course. F onda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially.
Redford's. are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and. despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-nat uredness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
— R.L.
10 ★ * *
Aquarius. Palo Alto
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie: if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on. 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are. forlack
ol a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid-life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter.
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
humbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek. that is. This poster-star just
may have found her "niche"' as the
vacuous "10" the title refers to.

The Jerk * *
Old Mill
I love Steve Martin, but this is
more an attempt to cash in on his
present status than an ettort to tacc
tougher creative challenges.
Steve's born a "poor black child,
and several of the skits in this rags
to riches to rags story revel so
wildly in their dumbness that they
simply must be inspired, but this
just isn't the movie that will make
Martin a memorable movie come
dian. He's got the unique moves
and he perhaps has got the mind,
but he doesn't yet have the material
— The Jerk's more a stringing to
gether of sketches than a movie.
Maybe next time, okay?
— R.L.
Going in Style ** *
Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack ol ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns. Art Carney and Lee Stras
herg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut.
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a hank: after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
vou to he effective.
— R.L.
Animal House * * * *
Park. Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion of white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of various
forms of frat life in '62 works;
Animal House's approach fits its
subject matter very well.
As always. John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus." I am never quite sure just
what drives Belushi. but whatever
it is. it must be good stuff.
John Landis directs as if there's
no speed but fast and no volume
hut loud, and while that doesn't
hurt him too much here (although,
because of this tendency. Animal
House has a decidedly limited emo
tional range), I wonder if Landis
can do anything else but movies
like this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Animal House * * * *
Park. Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion of white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of various
forms of frat life in '62 works;
Animal House's approach fits its
subject matter very well.
As always. John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus." I am never quite sure just
what drives Belushi. but whatever
it is. it must be good stuff.
John Landis directs as if there's
no speed but fast and no volume
hut loud, and while that doesn't
hurt him too much here (although,
because of this tendency. Animal
House has a decidedly limited emo
tional range), I wonder if Landis
can do anything else but movies
like this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Day the Earth Stood Still

Thursday, Bishop And. 7:30 p.m.
Even with the past decade's re
naissance ill the science fiction
movie. this tightly constructed film
from the '50s holds its position as
one of the best of the genre. A man
from another planet brings a
chance for peace on Earth; he is
met with only misunderstanding
and fear. It can be viewed as a con
demnation of McC'arthyism or as a

Kramer vs. Kramer ir it it
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
11 off man and a youngster of almost
Irighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs oft
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep"s extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars. and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes

Disney enters the motion picture
space race with a brilliant plunge

The effects are fun in the begin

obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a

Moonraker *
Menlo, Menlo Park
Sunday. Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
Formula James Bond — it looks

Take one dose of Roger Moore

fatale (in this case l.ois Chiles, who
seems fine right up until she
speaks), and a gimmicky plot, and
you can make your very own James
Bond movie.
Moonraker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is earthbound
for two solid hours — even the
patented in-the-sack last scene
seems affected by fatigue. The Spy
Who Loved Me. the last Bond

It would be easy to get worked

of A Star is Horn, except that this
one is clothed wi{h a, 1969 setting
and centered (in a H/af acter vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to '69. and without those Vou'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin s form ol
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob

Apocalypse Sow ** * *

An amazing work ol mad genius

Producer-director I raneisC oppola

Darkness: he employs C'onrad'scs
sential narrative but not his point ol

cinematographer \ ittorio Storaro.
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross horribly fasci

the best American movie ol the

Steve's born a "poor black child,

just isn't the movie that will make
Martin a memorable movie come

28-year-old writer-director Martin

Going in Style ** *
Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack ol ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns. Art Carney and Lee Stras
herg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut.
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a hank: after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample

Animal House * * * *
Park. Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion of white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of various
forms of frat life in '62 works;
Animal House's approach fits its
subject matter very well.
As always. John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus." I am never quite sure just
what drives Belushi. but whatever
it is. it must be good stuff.
John Landis directs as if there's
no speed but fast and no volume
hut loud, and while that doesn't
hurt him too much here (although,
because of this tendency. Animal
House has a decidedly limited emo
tional range), I wonder if Landis
can do anything else but movies
like this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Thursday, Bishop And. 7:30 p.m.
Even with the past decade's re

movie. this tightly constructed film
from the '50s holds its position as
one of the best of the genre. A man
from another planet brings a
chance for peace on Earth; he is
met with only misunderstanding

demnation of McC'arthyism or as a

Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
11 off man and a youngster of almost
Irighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs oft
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep"s extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co

the work of cinematographer Nes

Take one dose of Roger Moore

you can make your very own James

Moonraker has a great pre-title

after that the movie is earthbound

It's a journey into almost literal hell

I love Steve Martin, but this is

Steve's born a "poor black child,

to riches to rags story revel so
wildly in their dumbness that they
simply must be inspired, but this
just isn't the movie that will make
Martin a memorable movie come

Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack ol ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns. Art Carney and Lee Stras
herg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut.
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a hank: after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch

Animal House * * * *
Park. Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion of white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of various
forms of frat life in '62 works;
Animal House's approach fits its
subject matter very well.
As always. John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus." I am never quite sure just
what drives Belushi. but whatever
it is. it must be good stuff.
John Landis directs as if there's
no speed but fast and no volume
hut loud, and while that doesn't
hurt him too much here (although,
because of this tendency. Animal
House has a decidedly limited emo
tional range), I wonder if Landis
can do anything else but movies
like this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Even with the past decade's re

from the '50s holds its position as

Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
11 off man and a youngster of almost
Irighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs oft
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep"s extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender

movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co

Take one dose of Roger Moore

you can make your very own James

Moonraker has a great pre-title

after that the movie is earthbound

music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and

Apocalypse Sow ** * *

An amazing work ol mad genius

Producer-director I raneisC oppola

Conrad's 1902 novella heart oj
Darkness: he employs C'onrad'scs
sential narrative but not his point ol

cinematographer \ ittorio Storaro.
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross horribly fasci

others. Apocalypse Sow is. I think,
the best American movie ol the

rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course. F onda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially.
Redford's. are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti

I love Steve Martin, but this is
more an attempt to cash in on his
present status than an ettort to tacc
tougher creative challenges.
Steve's born a "poor black child,
and several of the skits in this rags
to riches to rags story revel so
wildly in their dumbness that they
simply must be inspired, but this
just isn't the movie that will make
Martin a memorable movie come
dian. He's got the unique moves
and he perhaps has got the mind,

Going in Style ** *
Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack ol ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns. Art Carney and Lee Stras
herg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut.
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a hank: after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample

Animal House * * * *
Park. Menlo Park
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion of white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of various
forms of frat life in '62 works;
Animal House's approach fits its
subject matter very well.
As always. John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus." I am never quite sure just
what drives Belushi. but whatever
it is. it must be good stuff.
John Landis directs as if there's
no speed but fast and no volume
hut loud, and while that doesn't
hurt him too much here (although,
because of this tendency. Animal
House has a decidedly limited emo
tional range), I wonder if Landis
can do anything else but movies
like this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

The Day the Earth Stood Still
♦ * *
Thursday, Bishop And. 7:30 p.m.
Even with the past decade's re
naissance ill the science fiction
movie. this tightly constructed film
from the '50s holds its position as
one of the best of the genre. A man
from another planet brings a
chance for peace on Earth; he is
met with only misunderstanding
and fear. It can be viewed as a con
demnation of McC'arthyism or as a
nun ie fulfilling the desire to create
modern myth. Whatever one reads
into the movie, it remains consis
tently entertaining. Julian Blaus
tein. now a faculty member ol the
Stanford communication depart

Kramer vs. Kramer ir it it
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
11 off man and a youngster of almost
Irighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs oft
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep"s extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars. and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

The Gold Rush * * * *
Saturday-Sunday, New Varsity
A fully realized comedy of ex

adventures in the forbidden wil
derness is among the most honored
of all time. Mel Brooks' Silent

The Black Hole -*
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion picture
space race with a brilliant plunge
into the world of outer space spe
cial effects, and falls Hat on its face.
The effects are fun in the begin
ning. but the wires soon become
obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a

cross between Star Wars' R2-D2
and a beer keg. The movie plays
like Captain Nemo in space, and
tlje religious overtones probably
have Dante spinning in his grave.

Moonraker *
Menlo, Menlo Park
Sunday. Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
Formula James Bond — it looks
as if this movie were made from a
recipe instead of from a script.
Take one dose of Roger Moore
(whatever you say. I still like Con
ncry better), one major Jemme
fatale (in this case l.ois Chiles, who
seems fine right up until she
speaks), and a gimmicky plot, and
you can make your very own James
Bond movie.
Moonraker has a great pre-title
sequence that is shot in mid-air;
after that the movie is earthbound
for two solid hours — even the
patented in-the-sack last scene
seems affected by fatigue. The Spy
Who Loved Me. the last Bond
movie, was watchable: skip thisone
and wait for something better to
come along.

Herbert Ross directed this fine
adaptation of Nicholas Meyer's
novel. Sherlock Holmes hooks up
with Sigmund Freud in Vienna; the
result is high-style fun. The per
formances sparkle, and Ross hand

touch. Nicol Williamson plays
Ifolmes. Alan Arkin stars as Freud.
Robert Duvall, Vanessa Redgrave

Le Million ★ ★ ★ ★
Wednesday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
This 1930 Rene Clair comedy
has been re-made in various forms
literally hundreds of times, and no
wonder; the comedy premise is an
archetypal one — a crazed group ol
people chase altera million dollars,
in this instance in the form of a lost
lottery ticket. Clair uses every pos
sible effect in tins wonderful movie.
With Rene Lefebreafid Annabella.

Love and Death * * *
Friday, Kresge 7:30 and 9:30
Woody Allen spends a lot of time
talking to himself about wild
metaphysical possibilities — the re
sults are decidedly mixed. This
movie was made right lifter Sleeper
and right before Annie Hall: it
would be a mistake to say that this
effort is a bridge between the two. but
there's lots to keep you interested just
the same. Woody drifts through a
neo-Tolstoian plot, and Diane Keaton
meanders along.

Harold and Maude . * * *
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe

Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and in the inherent goodness
ol humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals are played by Bud C'ort
and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens round out the soundtrack.

Strangers on u Train * ■* * *
Monday. Cuhherley 7 p.m.
This 1951 thriller ranks as one ol
the best of Hitchcock's Ameri
can" movies. The master's plotting
is a bit more complicated than
usual — an implicit homosexual

element is even thrown in. Bruno
(Robert Walker, in a delicious per
formance) kills an unhappily mar
ried stranger's wife, and he expects
him to return the favor by killing
Bruno's father. Farley Granger
plays Guy. the stranger. Raymond
Chandler helped on the screenplay.
Leo (i. Carroll and Patricia Hitch
cock co-star, dreed, one of Erich
Von Stroheim's most wildly am
bitious pictures, makes up the sec
ond half on Monday's double bill.

Star Trek * *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A mechan
ical creation of man comes hack to

haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
ol the Enterprise's crew members
saves civ ilization by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner.
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest ot the movie is
like a greatest hits ol Douglas
I rumbull and John Dykstra's pre
vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.

The Hose ★
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version

of A Star is Horn, except that this
one is clothed wi{h a, 1969 setting
and centered (in a H/af acter vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to '69. and without those Vou'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin s form ol
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic F or
rest or Alan Bates. Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little

too late.

Apocalypse Sow ** * *
Century 24, San Jose
An amazing work ol mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director I raneisC oppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gency in his reworking ol Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella heart oj
Darkness: he employs C'onrad'scs
sential narrative but not his point ol
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer \ ittorio Storaro.
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Sow is. I think,
the best American movie ol the
just-ended decade. It has almost

untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming crazincss
of this"impossible." almost nihilis
tic. vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando. Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.

1941 * * *

Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a lov ing expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. L ike a
Stennett or Lloyd two-rceler. 1941

is all up front: bodies fly all-too
frequcntly and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
I hat ma) partially explain the very
harsh reaction ot most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may he
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi, and Dan Aykroyd. Treat Wil
liams. loshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as (ieneral "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis

goes on outside the theater.
