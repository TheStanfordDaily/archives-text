Small town diners, which serve both good lood
and animated coin crsation are increasingly hard to
Imd m this age ol last lood. and so the May veil
I ane (.'ale. located 111 Burlingame j nst a lew blocks
wostol Highway 101 011 the Broadway exit, stands
as an extraordinary find, not only lor its rare
neighborhood-care atmosphere, but also loi the
uncompromising quality ol the lood.
When one lust walks in. one is not quite sure
what tt> expect. I he restaurant is decorated so as to
resemble a Southern European sidewalk cafe. A
large striped awning runs along one wall.
Sitting 111 its shade one can ga/e out over the
Mediterranean landscape stretched across the lull
wall mural on the other side ol the room. Real
lamposts punctuate the view. I'lie tables are gener
ally small and close together, which at first makes
those accustomed to the isolated, no-contact din
ing prevalent in the area a bit uncomfortable. But
as it turns out this closeness to one' s neighbor is one
ol the tilings that makes a visit to the M.iv\en I ane
('ale such an enjoyable afternoon.
Choosing a table, one linds the menu, cleverly
presented 111 the lorm ol a cutting board, replete
with a wide selection ol kosher delicatessen dishes.
I he house specials ol potato pancakes and blint/e
top the choice. I sampled a little noshe (a bite ol
something to hold one over until dinner as 1111 \
explained) ol potato pancakes, served fresh and
hot with apple sauce.
Never having had potato pancakes I cannot
claim to be a connoisseur, but I have a fear, con
tinued by lilly. that any future potato pancake
eaten anywhere else will be a disappointment. A
noshe of a sour cream and strawberry jam-covered
blint/e also proved to be an excellent decision, as
would anything from the menu 1 believe.
A pita bread mushroomburgcr and a Reuben

sandwich 011 rye arrived next, after much delibera

roast beel and various burgei creations arc offered
111 pita bread, while pastrami, coined beel and
salami are offered on rye \ll sandwiches come
with slaw or salad and are priced. a>« with every

Most notable among the sandwiches are the
Reuben, with corned beel that truly defies descrip

and vet not greasy Chicken soup with mat/o balls
and a diet plattci round out the selection.
112 ive different coffees head the list of beverages.

MAYVEN LANE CAFE
1204 Broad*!*)
Burlingame
344-2193
"Oh hollo Susan. have .1 scat. 011 |iist missed
your mother ami sister." Filly says as she Hies
about the small homey intcriorol the Mauen 1 a no
(ale, serving lunch, bussing tables and chatting
with he 1 customers. "Heard George had quite an
• eye-opener lor breakfast on his birthda\." some
one remarks in a play I HI. inquiring tone.
Small town diners, which serve both good lood
and animated coin crsation are increasingly hard to
Imd m this age ol last lood. and so the May veil
I ane (.'ale. located 111 Burlingame j nst a lew blocks
wostol Highway 101 011 the Broadway exit, stands
as an extraordinary find, not only lor its rare
neighborhood-care atmosphere, but also loi the
uncompromising quality ol the lood.
When one lust walks in. one is not quite sure
what tt> expect. I he restaurant is decorated so as to
resemble a Southern European sidewalk cafe. A
large striped awning runs along one wall.
Sitting 111 its shade one can ga/e out over the
Mediterranean landscape stretched across the lull
wall mural on the other side ol the room. Real
lamposts punctuate the view. I'lie tables are gener
ally small and close together, which at first makes
those accustomed to the isolated, no-contact din
ing prevalent in the area a bit uncomfortable. But
as it turns out this closeness to one' s neighbor is one
ol the tilings that makes a visit to the M.iv\en I ane
('ale such an enjoyable afternoon.
Choosing a table, one linds the menu, cleverly
presented 111 the lorm ol a cutting board, replete
with a wide selection ol kosher delicatessen dishes.
