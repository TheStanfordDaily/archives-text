I he average trip to .1 shopping mall isolten
,1 harrowing experience. Meandering from
department store to quaint shop can he en
joyable. unless you are accompanied by a
perpetual window shopper w ho specializes 111
10-hour meanders. Straggling from store to
store, burdened hy a barrage ol boxes and
boutique hags, is a similarly draining experi
ence.
Both i)l these experiences, in moderation,
can be enjoyed at the Vallco mall. I ocatcd
011 the Wolle Street exit oil ol I-2NO in
Cupertino, Vallco is a well rounded and
structurally pleasant shopping mall. A wide
variety ol shops and department stores pro
\ ide abundant hunting grounds lor the shop
per.
I he key to enduring and appreciating a
shopping excursion lies on the availability
and quality ol eating establishment, where
the tiredshoppercan relax and enjoy a break
belt)re pressing onward. Many mall restaur
ants tend to be over- or underdone attempts
at laddish decor and comfort. The result
tends to be an unpleasant, forced atmos
phere. The rare exception to this is the Wolle
Creek Cafe.
Wolle Creek Cafe is located 111 the upstairs
floor ol Vallco. near Bullocks. As tired and
hungry shoppers enter the cafe, they are
greeted by a pleasant lirst impression.
Spanish tiled floors and a clean, healthy at
mosphere are the initial views.
On either side as you walk in, one can see
the fresh meats, fruits and vegetables that
comprise an intriguing menu. The express
line to the right offers a quick road to hot
dogs, soups, desserts and an assortment of
fresh and inviting drinks. The main line oi
lers a fine choice, cafeteria style.
It is fortunate that the menu is posted out
side ol the cafe; one could spend half an hour
just reading the many choices. The menu is
composed til ;i variety ol foods and drinks
presented in an innovative and humorous
way. Sandwiches range from Egg Me On
(egg salad, /uchinni, water chestnuts, to

matocs and fresh sprouts on multigrain vita
bread), to the original and delicious Don't
Call it Frisco (bay shrimp, avocado, cream
cheese, tomatoes, and fresh sprouts on rye
with I.ouis dressing).
Generously apportioned sandwiches run
from $3 to $4. l arge bowls of fresh soup can
either complement a sandwich or make a
complete meal with one of Wolfe Creek
Cafe's crisp, fresh salads.

The salads vary from the Wolfe Creek
Salad (lettuce, tomatoes, water chestnuts,
eggs, turkey, sprouts, carrots, cucumbers,
mushrooms, swiss cheese and onions—
$4.75) to the standard fare, 112 ine Iresh salads
are enhanced by a choice ol such original
dressings as Yogurt Money Tahini or Herbal
Blue Cheese.

A
I he beverage selection is as innovative
and appealing as the rest ol the menu. Perrier
and Calistoga water go well with the natural
Ireshness ol the menu. Domestic and im
ported beers along u ith a choice ol wine are
also ollered. Ihe true coup ot the menu,
though, is the list ol coffees, ("ale cinnamon,
espresso, cappucino. cale mocha and cafe au
lait: join these aromatic brews with the most
incredibly delicious chocolate chip cookies to
ever tempt a palate, and you have a satisfying
culinary break from the rigors of shopping.
Ihe dining area is comfortably furnished
with clean, modern tables and chairs, while
an entire side wall is devoted to windows that
overlook fountains, grassy embankments
and the rest ol the sprawling mall. The
streaming sunlight highlights the plants and
wall decor. The surroundings and atmos
phere are t he ideal settings for the tone ol the
food at Wolfe Creek Cale.
While staying away from the image ot a
"health food restaurant," Wolfe Creek Cafe
is a healthy foods restaurant. All fruits and
vegetables are just-picked fresh. Breads and
pastries for sandwiches, desserts and break
last, are brought daily by the baker. They key
word is fresh, and the taste is good.
lo complete the picture, owner-manager
Bob Kiel is as refreshing as his menu. Kiel,
who has been in the restaurant business for
several years, is impressively enthusiastic
about Wolfe Creek Cafe. Having originated
the idea ol the cafe's unique location and
designed the interior, Kiel is an active par
ticipant in the activities ol the cafe.
Overseeing the friendliness of the dining
atmosphere and maintaining a high standard
ol quality is a task he undertakes and ac
complishes in a genial, knowledgeable man
ner. Being open for little more than a year.
Wolle Creek Cafe owes its growing success
and popularity to Kiel's interest.
Wolfe Creek Cafe is ideal in its capacity as
a comfortable meal place lor shoppers. Yet
the quality and originality of the menu are
worth a trip to Vallco. The cafe is open the
same hours as the mall and. although lunch is
the main event, it tills the role for breakfast
or inlormal dinner. The combination of fresh
food and decor result in a relaxing and satis-*'
tying meal.
