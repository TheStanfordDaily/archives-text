THE LONDON HOUSE

It was a dear and sunny day,
and alter an easy mid-day hike
ride through campus, my friend
and I found ourselves maneuver
ing through the traffic on Uni
versity Avenue. A quick right on
Ramona Street and we cycled
down to the London House. We
stepped through the black
wrought-iron gate lined with
bright red poinsettia plants.
Beyond that were large latticed
windows through which we could
see the bustle of the Tea Room.
I he London House was
opened in January of 1969 by
Sheila Barnes, an English
woman who brought with her the
authentic recipes of her lamilv.
In 1 1 >72 The London House was
moved to its' new location on
Ramona St. The outer building,
distinctly Spanish with its red tile
roof, was designed by Birge

Clark, a prominent Palo Alto ar
chitect.
Upon entering, we were im
mediately impressed with the
warmth and charm of the place.
There was a little fiieplace toone
side and a woodtv staircase at
the rear of the room Miat led up
to the Celtic Woolen hop.

In the loft one can browse
through the imported linens and
antiques from England, Ireland.
Scotland and Wales. Plants hang
from the ceiling and English
posters and lanterns adorn the
walls. Boxes of tea, crackers,
cookies, jams and jellies and
other imported goods line the
shelves on the walls.
Above, large woolv blankets

hang over the dark wood banis
ters. Sunlight streams through a
rather large skylight at the front
of the room. The atmosphere is
informal and cozy. It is usually
fairly crowded with local patrons
and "regulars" who have visited
the restaurant for years, some
who commute from as far as San
Lrancisco.
The restaurant is well known
to English people throughout the
Bay Area for serving what Mrs
Barnes calls "British people's
security-blanket food." Word of
mouth has always been the best
advertisement. The service is
quick and the food excellent.
Everything is made from
scratch and from top quality in
gredients; real butter, fresh eggs
and vegetables, cheese and real
cream. We ordered English
crumpets with minced ham and
cheddar cheese, and a luncheon
of homemade soup, salad and a
roll. It was a light lunch, but with
tea and dessert it was surpris
ingly filling.

I he cheese melted over the
crumpets was New York Ched
dar combined with sherry, mus
tard and cream. I he soup was
chicken based, with vegetables
such as celery, onions, turnips
and rice or barley, a Scottish re
cipe belonging to Mrs. Barnes'
mother. The dressing on the
crisp, fresh salad was also excel
lent, made of sour cream, dijon
mustard and other secret ingre
dients.
Good, basic food, well
prepared. is the most satisfying
according to Mrs. Barnes, and
therefore people do not tend to
eat too much of it. The menu
includes chicken salad, tea
sandwiches, Welsh rarebit. Cor
nish beef pastie and the specialty
of the house: steak and mus
hroom pie served with salad.
Many blends of the Twinings
of London Tea are served: E:n
glish Breakfast. Irish Breakfast,
Earl Grey and Russian Caravan
are just a few . They are served in

a tea set of white china with a
borderline of blue flowers. Tea is
served loose-leaf with either
lemon or cream. Orange Pekoe
and Jasmine, the teas that we
tried, were especially fragrant

and good.
I here is something definitely
special about the food prepara
tion at The London House. Mrs.
Barnes attributes this to the ex
cellent quality of ingredients

used in authentic recipes handed
down generation after genera
tion.
Finally, the serving cart was
brought over and we were in
formed that all the cakes were
homemade on the premises. We
chose the apricot almond torte
and sherry walnut cake. They
were delectable! Cither sumptu
ous offerings were apple cake,
sour cream coffee cake, lemon
nut bread, Scotch scones and
Hnglish Eccles cakes.
The charm of The London
Mouse: English Pub. Tea Room.
Celtic Woolen Shop and an
tiques — all lies in its authentic
ity. Just a leisurely ride from
campus one can find a true little
bit ot Britain. A tasty lunch, in
cluding tea and dessert, can be
found tor reasonable prices rang
ing from $4 to $6. Dinner is also
served. Prices average $X to $10.
