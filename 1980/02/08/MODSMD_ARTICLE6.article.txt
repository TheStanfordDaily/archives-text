# Bani Sadr discredits militants while U.S. postpones sanctions
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Ayatullah Ruholluh Khomeini and
Iran's ruling Revolutionary Council
gave President Abolhassan Bani Sadr
additional power yesterday as Bani
Sadr hammered away at the U.S. Km
bassy militants' waning authority and
reports persisted that the American
hostages might be freed soon.
Tehran Radio said Bani Sadr was
elevated from acting chairman to head
of the council, the nation's supreme
law-making body, with Khomeini's
consent.
The broadcast said Bani Sadr at
tended the session that appointed him.
and that the mectingdiscussed"impor
tant issues til the country."
Bani Sadr's new appointment in el
fect made him Iran's second most inf
luential leader after Khomeini, the
country's 79-year-old revolutionary
chief who is recuperating in a Tehran
hospital from a heart attack and is ob
viously exerting only supervisory and
inspirational control.
'Rebels'
lor the second straight day.the new
Iranian president blasted the young
Moslem radicals publicly, calling them
"rebels against the government." And
the Revolutionary Council, led by Bani
Sadr. took action against them, rest rid
ing their access to national radio and
television.
It appeared Bani Sadr was trying to
undercut the militants' status as re
volutionary heroes in preparation for a
resolution of the hostage crisis being
worked out behind the scenes.
A Kuwait newspaper, the weekly Al
KlnuliiJ. reported from Tehran that the
release ol the approximately 50
American hostages at the embassy was
"imminent.'" I he paper, which did not
identify the source of its information,
said the number ot militants at the em
bassy had been reduced from 400 to
50.
It said I N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim was trying to persuade Bani

Sadr to "pressure the students to leave
the embassy and have them replaced by
tegular Iranian troops."
I'.S. officials were cautious in com
menting on the Kuwaiti report.
Deputy Secretary of State Warren
Christopher said on NBC-TV's Today
show the situation was "somewhat
promising." Spokesman George
Sherman said the State Department
had no evidence to confirm the report.
And Hodding Carter, chief department
spokesman, said."! do not see any im
minent release ot the hostages."
Uncertainty
Carter said the U.S. government was
still uncertain about Iran's terms for
releasing the hostages, who spent their
96th day in captivity yesterday.
Waldheim has been trying to work
out an arrangement whereby an inter
national commission would be estab
lished to investigate the alleged crimes
of the regime of the deposed Shah
Mohammad Re/u Pahlav i. in return for
release of the hostages. But U.N. offi
cials say the timing of the release —
whether it vull be as the commission
begins its work or after it is completed
— remains unsettled.
Adding to the confusion, some Ira
nian officials still say they believe the
hostages cannot be freed until the
ousted shah is returned to Iran to stand
trial, which has been the militants' con
stant demand.
U.S. delays sanctions
Meanwhile, the United States is in a
new bid to encourage negotiations on
freeing the American hostages in
Tehran, announced yesterday it is
postponing indefinitely its long
threatened plan to formally impose
economic sanctions against Iran.
The policy reversal came as part ol
the Carter administration's efforts to
foster a conciliatory atmosphere in
which Bani Sadr can move toward re
solution of the 97-day-old crisis over
the hostages.
