The crisis in Afghanistan constitutes
a turning point in I '.S.-Sov iet relations
only because the United States per
ceives it as such. (dit Blacker, assistant
•director ol the Arms Control and Dis
armament Program here said yester
day.
"The shitt is similar to that in 1 l )4(>
and 1947 towards the Cold War." he
said to 100 people at a noon lecture in
the Ciraduate School of Business.
"The Carter Doctrine is less con
cerned with handling relations (with
the Soy iet Union) than hanging
tough." lie said. "In a search for a new
formula for foreign policy, we have
come too close to the 1947 policy ol
containment."
"The Soviet Union perceives that
the United States lias turned itsback on
the cooperation policies ol the late
I Wilis." lie said. "They thought that
the policy (ol detente) was to try to
avoid direct confrontation where there
was a threat of nuclear war. lo them,
this accommodation does not include
openly contested areas, such as Af
ghanistan." he said.
No cud
" The Soviet Union never expected
detente to end the competition for ac
cess and influence and power. I hey
perceived detente as an agreement to
avoid confrontation in dangerous areas
and lii limit arms between the United
States and the Soviet Union." he con
tinued.
" The Soviets were also surprised by
the United States' reaction to the iuv a
sion since the American stake in that
country is minimal, and Afghanistan is
not strategically important." Blacker
said.
"They miscalculated the reaction by
the Islamic countries of the lliird
World as well," he said. "They did not
anticipate the invasion to become a ral
lying point for China. Africa, the Un
ited States and the Third World.
Consist ant
"The Soviet Union perceived the in
vasion as consistent with previous exist
ing policies in Afghanistan. They were
loath to surrender their investment in a
client state. The invasion was a step in
the incremental growth of involvement
in that country" which began in 1921'
and was accelerated since 1970. lie
said.
Previous American administrations
have influenced the Soviet Union by

providing rewards for good or accepta
ble behavior and punishments for un
acceptable behavior. Blacker said.
"I or the first IN months of the Carter
administration the policy was contused
and ambivalent. We had no coherent
policy response in Ethiopia in 1977 or
in I ran in 1979. The Sov icts are asking.
Why now?'
" i lie United States is reacting to the
Soviet Union's superpower status. We
should rcali/e that competition with
the Soviet Union will continueover the
long term —even if tlicv were to back
down now." he said.
Not clear
" I lie Carter administration has not
clarified its commitments in the Persian
( hillßlacker questioned the credibil
ity ol the United States' commitment to
defend the Persian (iulf.
Blacker said he was not encouraged
In signals that are coming from the cur
rent shilt in U.S. policy toward con
tainment.
Containment worked in 1946 be
cause there was no contest for power
between the United States and the
Soviet Union, said Blacker. "We could
deter the Soviet Union, prevent any
crisis In our clout.

"The Soviet Union of 19.50 is more
equal in power. It is not possible to
intimidate Moscow." he said.
Accommodation
"What is required," according to
Blacker is "an accommodation to the
Soviet Union's interests unless we arc
prepared to risk nuclear war. We can
not respond with power. The consequ
ences ol misjudgment are far more hor
rible than ever before conceived."
The United States needs a com
prehensive policy review, according to
Blacker. Such a review must identify
what is crucial for America to defend
and what its capacity to force com
pliance with its needs is. he said. "We
should also search for alternatives
short of war."
Blacker condemned the suspension
ol contacts with the Soviet Union. "We
must seek to manage our relationship
with the Soviet Union. We should keep
our influence there, because they will
not back down. Most ol all. we must
reali/e that there will be an ongoing
contest for long-term access and
power. Ihe invasion ol Afghanistan
could be the first significant foreign
policy move of the post-Br/e/hnev
team."
