### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
I n<jlirit Gandhi's recent re
election as Prime Minister of
India "is going to he had for the
vast majority ol India's people."
according to Anupam Khanna.
doctoral student in
Engineering-Economic Systems
and former World Bank consul
tant on urban projects.
"While she'll he very good for
pri\ ate business, she'll probably
wield the hig stick on the work
ers. by using the state machinery
to maintain industrial peace and
to continue the exploitation of
the workers." Khanna said to an
audience ol SO at the Bechtel
l-Center on Tuesday.
Pointing to Gandhi's business
support and to the anti
communist stance of the govern
ing party, dominated by her son
Sanjay. Khanna said. "Ghandi's
model of centralization of power
meshes quite well with the de
velopment of monopoly
capitalism, either state or pri
vate."
The stability and decisiveness
which Gandhi claims to be her
mandate will not alleviate "the
general social and economic
crisis in India, which is worsening
in terms of inequality and vio
lence." Khanna said. "Rather,
stability is sought for by the rich
and middle classes, the indus
trialist. the businessman, the
bureaucracy and the military."
Worst forms
I urthermore. Khanna expects
the new party machine to "as
sume its worst forms." Citing tHe
arrest ol the former investigator
of Sanjay last week, he added,
"the harassment and intimida
tion has already started."
In foreign affairs, as in domes
tie. "Gandhi is a bully." Khanna
said. "She would like to be a
southern imperialist power and
may increase the hostility ot
Pakistan. Bangladesh. Bhutan
and Nepal by trying to dictate
terms to them."
Khanna traced Gandhi's "dic
tatorial style" to her declaration
of a state of emergency, due to
regional uprisings which fol
lowed a series of bad harvests in
the early seventies.
When her opponents began to
coalesce into a cohesive opposi
tion. followed by her conviction
i)n a minor election violation.
Gandhi instigated the
emergency "to save her political
skin." said Khanna. Press cen
sorship and the suspension ot
civil rights was accompanied by
urban heautification and mass
sterilization campaigns, as well
as "the rise of the petty autoc
rat." he added.
Resounding defeat
Eventually conditions forced
Gandhi to call elections in 1977.

when she was resoundingly de
feated by Jayaprakash Narayan.
"At that time. Gandhi was more
down than Nixon has ever
been." Khanna said.
However, in time the new re
gime became div ided. and popu
lar dissatisfaction with last year's
weak Charan Singh gov eminent,
which had gained office largely
due to Gandhi's efforts, pro
vided the conditions for Gan
dhi's return to power, according
to Khanna.
By relying on the support ot
the establishment, and by cul
tivating the votes ot the Muslims
and the poor. Gandhi's-Congress
Party managed to regain control
of the government last month.
Khanna said.
The widespread hope in India
is that Gandhi, in promising not
to reinstate the emergency, has
learned her lesson. However.
Khanna said. "I think the lesson
she might have learned is "don't
have elections'
"The type of politics that is
symbolized by the victory ol In
dira Gandhi is quite irrelev ant to
development and change in In
dia." he said. Khanna ques
tioned the viability of conven
tional parliamentary democracv
in a semi-teudalistic structure
"where the role of personality is
more important than the organi
zation . . . the people want a
King or an Empress."

I urthermore. Khanna expects
the new party machine to "as
sume its worst forms." Citing tHe
arrest ol the former investigator
of Sanjay last week, he added,
"the harassment and intimida
tion has already started."
In foreign affairs, as in domes
tie. "Gandhi is a bully." Khanna
said. "She would like to be a
southern imperialist power and
may increase the hostility ot
Pakistan. Bangladesh. Bhutan
and Nepal by trying to dictate
terms to them."
Khanna traced Gandhi's "dic
tatorial style" to her declaration
of a state of emergency, due to
regional uprisings which fol
lowed a series of bad harvests in
the early seventies.
When her opponents began to
coalesce into a cohesive opposi
tion. followed by her conviction
i)n a minor election violation.
Gandhi instigated the
emergency "to save her political
skin." said Khanna. Press cen
sorship and the suspension ot
civil rights was accompanied by
urban heautification and mass
sterilization campaigns, as well
as "the rise of the petty autoc
rat." he added.
Resounding defeat
Eventually conditions forced
Gandhi to call elections in 1977.

when she was resoundingly de
feated by Jayaprakash Narayan.
"At that time. Gandhi was more
down than Nixon has ever
been." Khanna said.
However, in time the new re
gime became div ided. and popu
lar dissatisfaction with last year's
weak Charan Singh gov eminent,
which had gained office largely
due to Gandhi's efforts, pro
vided the conditions for Gan
dhi's return to power, according
to Khanna.
By relying on the support ot
the establishment, and by cul
tivating the votes ot the Muslims
and the poor. Gandhi's-Congress
Party managed to regain control
of the government last month.
Khanna said.
The widespread hope in India
is that Gandhi, in promising not
to reinstate the emergency, has
learned her lesson. However.
Khanna said. "I think the lesson
she might have learned is "don't
have elections'
"The type of politics that is
symbolized by the victory ol In
dira Gandhi is quite irrelev ant to
development and change in In
dia." he said. Khanna ques
tioned the viability of conven
tional parliamentary democracv
in a semi-teudalistic structure
"where the role of personality is
more important than the organi
zation . . . the people want a
King or an Empress."
