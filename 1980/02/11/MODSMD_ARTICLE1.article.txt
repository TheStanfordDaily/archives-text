## 
### Seth Zuckerman News Editor 
Two Stanford students were arrested
late last week on charges of producing
and selling amphetamines.
According to Special Agent Robert
Elsberg of the California Department
of Justice, the continuing investigation
may net at least one more student here.
Junior John Mack was arrested at his
Woodside home Wednesday night and
released Thursday from San Mateo
County Jail in Redwood City on his
own recognizance. He is charged with
the sale and production of dangerous
drugs.
Sophomore Darryl Singh was ar
rested outside his Manzanita trailer,
number 11X. Thursday night after a
search warrant was served on his trailer
and room. He was released from the
Redwood City jail Friday evening after
posting a $20,000 cash bail.
Singh is charged with the sale and
production of dangerous drugs, conspi
racy and knowingly furnishing raw
materials for the production of a con
trolled substance.
Elsberg said the arrests were the
culmination of several months of sur


Rep. Pete McCloskey
veillance.
His department found hard evidence
to support its case at 5120 Old La
Honda Road in Woodside where Mack
lives, and in Singh's trailer, he added.
Elsberg said that Singh could not be
located for a long time, and was finally
taken into custody by the Stanford
police.
"There should be other people ar
rested, and at least one of them is a
Stanford student," he said. "Future ar
rests could occur at anytime or not at
all."
He said his agency seized lab equip
ment in Woodside and Manzanita that
has been sent to the San Mateo.County
Sheriff s Office crime laboratory.
Mack and Singh will be prosecutedin
San Mateo County, Elsberg said, be
cause that is where most of the evi
dence was found. He added that his
agency was alerted to the case in part

by reports of the sale of the raw mate
rials for the drugs.
"The cases are pat on them — just
about complete," he said.
Dean of Student Affairs James;
Lyons said that it was "unfortunate"
that the arrests had occurred and that
they imposed "an inconvenience" on
those who lived with Singh.
His office was not informed that the
investigation was in progress, he said,
nor was there any reason it should have
been.
He added that their alleged crime is
not punishable under the University's
Fundamental Standard. Although the
University is concerned about the
health effects of drug use, he said, it has
always tried to avoid redundancy bet
ween University regulations and the
law.
This is the first major drug arrest
here since July 1978.
