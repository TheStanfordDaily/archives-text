# Syria may halt withdrawal

### Aly Mahnoud The Associated Press 
BEIRUT, Lebanon — Reports that Syria was
reconsidering its decision to withdrawn its
peacekeeping forces from trouble-ridden Beirut
appeared to have eased tensions in this embattled
city yesterday.
Sniping stopped overnight and at dawn, civilian
traffic intensified along the "greenline" highway
that divides Beirut into Moslem and Christian
halves.
The leftist newspaper. As Safir, known for its
strong Syrian connections, said the withdrawal had
been deferred and the 5000 Syrian troops in Beirut
would continue to police the greenline and other
potential flashpoints.
Also, the authoritative newspaper An Nahar
quoted Mahhoud Hadid, the speaker of Syria's
Parliament, as saying the entire 22,000-man Syrian
peacekeeping army would "redeploy in new points

within Lebanon, and no all-out withdrawal was
envisaged."
This coincided with earlier reports that the Sy
rian troops in Beirut would leave the capital — hut
not the country — and take up new positions in
southern Lebanon to counter an offensive al
legedly being planned by Israel. Israel denies it has
such plans.
The stream of Lebanese officials and leftist lead
ers who hastened to Damascus during the week,
seeking to talk Syrian President Hafez Assad into
calling off the withdrawal, returned after being told
to brace themselves for the pullout and prepare the
Lebanese army to take over the peacekeeping
duties.
But the officials, including Premier Salim El
Hoss, former President Suleiman Franjieh, and
former Premier Rachid Karami, said no date for
the withdrawal had been set.
