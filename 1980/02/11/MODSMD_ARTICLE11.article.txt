### Jane West Staff Writer 
A revolution of thought rather
than arms characterized the
struggle for independence in
Mozambique in 1973, Albie
Sachs, professor of law at
Eduardo Mondlane University
in Maputo, Mozambique said
last week.
Since the takeover of the Fre
limo government in Mozam
bique, a new legal system has
been set up that involves whole
communities in questions of jus
tice, Sachs said to 30 persons at a
lecture co-sponsored by the Law
School and the Joint African
Studies Center.
Under Eduardo Mondlane,
the exiled groups in Mozam
bique which fought for indepen
dence from the Portuguese
placed emphasis upon the motto
of "study, cultivate and fight, in
that order," Sachs said.
"The people of the country
had to know what they were
fighting for, learn to be self
sufficient and try to develop a
new outlook," Sachs said. "It
was most important that they
realize that the enemy was a sys
tem of exploitation, not a race or
a nation."
In 1973, President Samora
Machel drew up a set of
guidelines corresponding to the
new government and viewpoint
— the people were to liberate
themselves. Since only the minis
ter of justice, bankers and a few
others from the old government
remained, a two-year law school
was established to train people to
set up judicial systems in the
provinces, according to Sachs.

" After a smattering of the rud
ments of legal thinking, students
19, 20 and 21 years old began
jxercising enormous responsibil
ity," he said.
Following nine months of in
formation gathering and im
plementation of popular justice
tribunals, a National Meeting of
Justice was held to determine
how to precisely build the court
system, Sachs said.
Sachs explained the practical
work he did in the provinces
while serving on a position in the
Mondlane University brigade.
"When we wouldenter the vil
lages, the women were on the left
and the men on the right. A phys
ical division still exists. A table
was always waiting because it.
was considered the respectful
and proper thing to do," Sachs
said.
"Each orientation meeting
began with an amusing sequence
of 'Vivas,' " he added. "We
would then tell them how to go
about selecting worthy people to
act as judges, by nominating
people from the community and
detailing how to rank crimes."
"Trials were to be always open
and public opinion encouraged.
After the meeting, I shook hands
with the people of the village. My
hands felt so silky next to the
rough, hard hands of the people
of the revolution," he said.
Since the implementation of
the popular justice tribunals, one
hundred are now in existence
with 10 in each province.
"They are functioning and
spreading. I'm looking forward
to going back to Mozambique.
It's a very rich experience to be
involved in."
