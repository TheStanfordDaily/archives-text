# Soviets bolster Afghanistan forces

KABUL, Afghanistan — The
Soviet Union has moved deci
sively on the military front in Af
ghanistan during the past week.
New equipment has been
brought into the country, posi
tions around the capital have
been strengthened and troops
have been moved toward areas
of rebel resistance.
The heightened profile, which
includes a new anti-aircraft posi
tion in Kabul, comes less than
two weeks before the expiration
of the American deadline serby
President Jimmy Carter on a
Soviet withdrawal of troops from
Afghanistan. On Feb. 20
Washington will decide whether
to boycott the Moscow Olympic
games this summer.
Political observers here, while
not wholly dismissive of a token
withdrawal, are nevertheless dis
tinctly pessimistic about the
chances of a Soviet pullback
north of the border. Among their
reasons:
— The USSR has achieved
very little (either militarily or
politically) in the six that
have passed since Moso w inter
vened to bring Babrak Karmal to
power. Serious, albeit sporadic,
opposition continues in virtually
every corner of Afghanistan's
belligerently independent ter
rain and the new president has
singularly failed in his task of
winning political acceptibility.
No reason
— Having so far survived the
brunt of Western condemnation
for the invasion, the Soviets have
little reason (either strategic or
financial) to withdraw. The Red
Army here is believed to be
made up of what is euphemisti
cally called second-line troops
from Central Asian republics,
thus bringing no pressure on
Warsaw Pact divisions in East
Europe or Soviet troops along

the Chinese border. Afghanistan
constitutes as good as any a train
ing ground for the Soviet military
and. apart from extra fuel costs,
the financial burden is not exces
sive.
— A withdrawal within the
next two weeks would be all but
logistically impossible. Not only
has the Red Army shown no in
dication of dismantling positions
and heading home, but a sub
stantial amount of military
hardware has been seen crossing
the northern border during the
past week.
The number of Soviet troops
here is now put by Western dip
lomats at between 85,000 and
90,000 compared with fewer
than 85,000 one week ago. The
number of divisions is believed
to have remained constant at six,
with one being the 105 th Air
borne, a frontline unit made up
of elite paratroopers, and the
remainder motorized rifle divi

sions.
Big-bellied jets
The reported increase in the
number of Soviet troops fol
lowed a burst of new activity ear
lier this week at Kabul airport's
two unloading terminals. Many
of the jet transporters, both
Antonov-1 2s and the big-bellied
Ilyushin-76s were believed to be
carrying food supplies as well as
considerable numbers of both
Soviet civilian and military per
sonnel.
Substantial activity also was
observed earlier this week at
Heiratan, one of two major bor
der posts along the Afghan-
Soviet frontier. Among the
equipment rumbling south along
the only passable highway to
Kabul and major urban centers
were armored personnel car
riers, tanks and bridge-building
materials. Diplomats have since
said that such equipment does
not indicate that Moscow plans a

speedy withdrawal.
But, it is still far from clear
here whether Moscow is
stockpiling weaponry for the
much heralded spring offensive
against the Moslem rebels. Some
observers have speculated that
new equipment might simply be
catching up with the Soviet
troops who first arrived during
the last two weeks of December.
Much of the equipment, some
apparently factory-fresh, ap
pears totally unsuitable for Af
ghanistan's towering peaks and
honeycombed caves that provide
ready refuge for Moslem rebels.
Such unsuitability, it has been
speculated, could possibly be no
thing more than the Soviet Un
ion's penchant for filling top
military positions with elderly
marshals of 60-plus years who
are more familiar with World
War II tactics than fighting wily
Afghan guerrillas.
