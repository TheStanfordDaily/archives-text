Make $200,000. $500,000 —
who knows? It's easy money.
Just invest $100 — and tollow
instructions in this chain letter
exactly.
Give $50 to the person who
hands the letter to you, place
another $50 in an envelope and
mail it to the first person listed in
the letter. Copy the letter, re
move the name of the person at
the top and add your name to the
bottom.
II the 12 people on the list fol
low the rules, each will receive
more than $200,000 in approxi
mately 12 days.
Get rich quick. Right. There's
a sucker born every minute.
, • Participants all over the coun
try say chain letters such as Circle
•of Gold, Business List and
.Platinum Pyramid are fun and
fruitful. Prosecutors condemn
■them as fraudulent and harmful.
"People don't understand that
the money has to come from
•someone else's pocket," said
Victoria Vreeland. an assistant
attorney general in Washington
state. "It doesn't grow on trees."
The New York attorney gen
eral's office calculated the odds
for an "investor" in the above
list. Even the 13th buyer would
he in trouble because each per
son ahead of him involves
another 12 names, who them
selves involve dozens of people.
The entire population of New
York state would be exhausted
by the time the last buyer reaches
the top of the list.
As far back as 1906. the Wis
consin Supreme Court con
demned chain schemes as "evil."
It spoke of "a series of constantly
multiplying endless chains with
nothing but fading rainbows as
the reward of those who are un
fortunate enough to become
purchasers the moment before
the collapse of the scheme."
In the 19205, Charles Ponzi
gave his name to pyramid-type
chain schemes that paid old in
vestors with money from new in
vestors. In the decades since, im
itators have duped even the most
sophisticated investors.
Wayne Kidd. manager of the
U.S. Postal Service's fraud
bureau, said the postal service
tries to discourage chain letters
i by prosecuting participants
runder federal lottery and mail
' fraud statutes. Those who avoid
the mails come under consumer
protection laws in most states.
Despite official displeasure
with the chains, supporters are
> coming into the open. They
sponsor huge rallies, advertise in
newspapers and paste bumper
stickers on their cars.
Rhode Island authorities shut
down a $ 1000-a-shot scheme
last April, but only after realizing
that people in the block-long cue
outside a Woonsocket store
front were lined up hoping for
payoffs of $31.000.
"They thought they were help
ing each other." said Walter
Stone, an attorney for the
operators. "All 1 could see was

that they were circulating the
same money."
Alex Sylvia, a real estate
salesman who was president ot
the"club" that ran the scheme,
said perhaps 600 people took
part and they were "making
thousands of dollars in less than a
week." He said some of his
friends made up to $10,000.
"It was an incredible experi
ence. seeing people come to
gether. 1 saw a lot of happy
people, a lot of excited people,"
Sylvia said.
Oregon is seeking to halt the
Business List.
We felt we were not breaking
the law," said Laverne Pade. a
sometimes blackjack dealer and
mother ot three from Myrtle
Point. Ore., who said she made
$3700 from the Business List." It
was our $100. We worked for it.
we paid taxes on it and it's our
business what we do with it."
With apparent reluctance, un
employed Myrtle Point logger
John Loots conceded he had re
ceived "in the neighborhood of
$25,000 from participation in
the Business List.
"I've worked my butt off on
this thing, too," Poors said, exp
laining how he tracked the
spread of the Business List to 14
cities in California, Montana.
Idaho, Arizona and Nevada.
"It's an elaborate setup — it's
really neat. When it don't work,
it's the people setting down
doing nothing, being lazy."
Most people get back their
original "investment." according
to research analyst Josh
Holtzman of the National As
sociation of Attorneys General,
but profit is another matter.
Coos County Sheriff Leslie
Miller was among the Business
List losers when Oregon began
its crackdown; "I haven't seen
any money yet."
Still, he said he endorsed the
concept because his neighbors
had received enough money to
pay back bills and buy such
luxuries as microwave ovens. "I
feel it really helps the economy
in Coos County," Miller said.
In Dodgeville, Wis., the Rev.
Howard Lindsay of the United
Methodist Church told of meet
ings in homes attended by more
than 100 people where $30,000
or $40,000 was changing hands.
One banker made 23 loans of
exactly $1000 "before he caught
on" that the borrowers were
using the money to buy into a
chain, the minister said. Lindsay
said one couple lost $5000.
Prosecutors queried in Texas.
Oregon. Washington, Rhode Is
land and Wisconsin despaired at
ever getting to the first link in a
chain.
"One of the frustrating things
about fighting them is that there
isn't a central agency you can
stop." said Eric Sten, an assistant
attorney general in Oregon.
"I've really had it," said Ms.
Vreeland. "People just don't
understand that maybe it's going
to take two or three weeks, but
the people at the bottom are
going to get screwed."
