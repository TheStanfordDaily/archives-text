of being alone on campus and in surrounding areas.

12:30 a.m. Sundav through Thursday.
112 ormer director and founder ot the organization
Ron I epow is graduating at tire end ot winter quar
ter.
"Last year, the number ol calls for escorts in
creased by 100 percent." Menon said. "Hut we'd
still like to see more students calling in."
He said many women feel silly or foolish about
calling for an escort when they have to walk or ride
home after dark. That and their belief that they are
imposing on the volunteer escorts make them shy
away from calling the service, he said.
"We want to stress that it is not an imposition to
call the escorts." Menon said. These men and
women devote two hours a week waiting next to
their phones for a call. They olten complain that
they don't get enough calls."
The serv ice has 35 men and women volunteer

escorts, all ol whom carry a flashlight, whistle and
identification. Women escorts work in teams ot
two.
Besides escorting women to spots on campus.
SU RE volunteers will accompany students to loca
tions one mile off campus. I his ser\ ice is a one-way
service only — volunteers will not lea\c campus
alone to escort women to a spot on University
grounds.
I his quarter. SURE further expanded its ser
vices by extending its operating hours because ot
winter's early dusk. Hours will return to the stan
dard S:3() p.m. to 1 2:3<> a.m. 111 the spring. Menon
said.
Students who know they will need an escort at a
certain time may call earlier 111 the day and leave a
tape recorded message.
SURE is currently sponsoring a "Don't Run
Alone" program, urging students to run in teams of
two or more when jogging 111 the foothills or near
campus.
"A lot ol people like running alone, but they
could easily jog with someone 20 leet behind them,
just so there's someone close by." said Lepow.
Sponsored by the Ottice ot Student Affairs and
the Department ol Public Safety, the service is
open to all faculty, statt and students.
