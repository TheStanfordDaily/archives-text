### Jim McKay The Associated Press 
PITTSBURGH — Students
are complaining that a plan to
ban overnight visitors will turn
University of Pittsburgh dor
mitories into "monasteries." but
officials at the urban campus sav
they hope the policy will cut
down on crime.
"We don't want it. We have to
tight this," TerriSlack, chairman
ol the student-resident associa
tion. said last week. "I haven't
talked to anyone who is for the
new visitation policy."
Beginning with the new term
in May. the university plans to
stop male and female students
from sharing rooms between 2
a.m. and 10 a.m. in 10 dormitory
buildings throughout the city's
Oakland section.
Members of the same sex may
visit overnight but must register
at the dormitory control desk
and cannot stay longer than

three days every two weeks.
Each of the 4100 resident stu
dents will be limited to 30 visits a
term and regular visitors will be
discouraged.
"Anytime you increase sec
urity. you necessarily have to de
crease some freedom's." said Pitt
spokesman Mary Ann Aug.
"We really feel it is essentially
a practical matter. How do you
control who comes and who goes
when you have that many
people?"
Dormitories have been open
on a 24-hour basis since 1971.
But security became a hot cam
pus issue last January when a
freshman student. Monica Jones,
was found strangled in a dorm
trash area.
The man charged with the
murder. Sidney Brinkley of
Philadelphia, allegedly stayed in
a dormitory with a female Iriend
even though he was not a regis
tered student.
"Under the present rule, you

are not permitted to have guests
for longer than five consecutive
days." said Sue McFarland,
editor of The Pitt News. "He had
been living there for weeks and
weeks at a time."
When Dr. Conney Kimbo,
\ ice chancellor of student affairs,
announced the new policy this
week, lie was met with jeers from
hundreds ot students and a ban
ner reading: "Monastery of
Pittsburgh."
"Legally we're adults."
shouted one student. "We can
vote, be drafted and go to war.
and the unversity has no right to
regulate our morals."
Kimbo said the university has
"the responsibility and the right
to change housing policy as long
as it's legal, and this is legal."
Slack said students were talk
ing with the American Civil
Liberties Union, writing to con
gressmen and planning to protest
at the next board of trustees
meeting.
