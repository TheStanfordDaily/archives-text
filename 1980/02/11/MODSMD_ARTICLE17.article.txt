# Congress revisits Daily court case
## 
### Jim Mann The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — In the
first congressional test of legisla
tion to limit surprise police raids,
a Senate judiciary subcommittee
last month approved a hill that
would grant new legal protection
against such searches to jour
nalists hut not to doctors,
lawyers and other individuals.
The measure, which is sup
ported by the Carter administra
tion. would bar law enforcement
officials from obtaining warrants
to search newsrooms or broad
casting stations. It specifically
covers both documentary mate
rials and the work product —
such as notes and tape recordings
— of writers and broadcasters.
The Supreme Court held in
the 1978 case of Zurcher v.v.
Stanford Daily that police
searches of newsrooms do not
violate the First Amendment
guarantee of freedom of the
press or the Fourth Amendment
ban on unreasonable searches.
Since that ruling, a number of
press and civil liberties groups
have sought new legislation to
restrict police searches. Gener
ally. these groups have argued
that the legislation should be
broad enough to protect all so
called "third parties" — that is,
persons who are not themselves
suspected of criminal activity —
from police searches.
Law enforcement officials, in
cluding the Department of Jus
tice and the National District At
torneys Association, have ar
gued that any broad restriction
on the ability of police to conduct
surprise searches would severely
hamper their efforts to combat
crime, particularly white-collar
crime.
After nearly two years of de
bate. the sentiment in Congress
appears to be in favor of a bill
that would protect only the
press.
At a session of the
Senate Judiciary subcommittee
on the Constitution, even Sens.
Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.) and
Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), who
often oppose efforts to limit the
rights of law enforcement offi

cials. said they generally sup
ported legislation to bar police
from searching news organiza
tions.
With their acquiescence, the
subcommittee then cleared por
tions of a bill sponsored hy Sen.
Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), the sub
committee chairman, that would
restrict the use of search war
rants against writers or broadcas
ters. Hatch said he may later in
troduce amendments that would
impose some limits on the pro
tection the bill would give jour
nalists.
Bayh's bill also contained two
separate sections that would
generally bar police from search
ing doctors, lawyers or other
third parties. But the subcom
mittee postponed action on these
provisions after Thurmond and
Hatch indicated their opposi
tion. Bayh said later he wasn't
sure he had the votes to win pas
sage on these provisions.
Staff members of a House
Judiciary subcommittee that is
scheduled to act soon on similar
proposals said they do not be
lieve there is any serious opposi
tion to protecting the press from
searches. But one source said the
FBI and other law enforcement
groups have been lobbying with
some effectiveness against a
broader bill to protect all third
parties from searches.
The hill approved hy Bayh's
subcommittee would allow
police to get a warrant for a
search if they suspected a jour
nalist of certain kinds of criminal
activity. It would also permit
police to search a newsroom for
materials that are needed "to
prevent the death of. or serious
bodily injury to. a human being."
Even if the bill is enacted,
police would still be able to try to
obtain materials from a writer or
broadcaster through the use of a
subpoena.
However, a person served
with a subpoena has the right to
contest it in court before handing
over the materials being sought.
When police obtain a search
warrant, they may conduct a sur
prise raid and seize materials be
fore the warrant is ever chal
lenged in court.

often oppose efforts to limit the
rights of law enforcement offi

cials. said they generally sup
ported legislation to bar police
from searching news organiza
tions.
With their acquiescence, the
subcommittee then cleared por
tions of a bill sponsored hy Sen.
Birch Bayh (D-Ind.), the sub
committee chairman, that would
restrict the use of search war
rants against writers or broadcas
ters. Hatch said he may later in
troduce amendments that would
impose some limits on the pro
tection the bill would give jour
nalists.
Bayh's bill also contained two
separate sections that would
generally bar police from search
ing doctors, lawyers or other
third parties. But the subcom
mittee postponed action on these
provisions after Thurmond and
Hatch indicated their opposi
tion. Bayh said later he wasn't
sure he had the votes to win pas
sage on these provisions.
Staff members of a House
Judiciary subcommittee that is
scheduled to act soon on similar
proposals said they do not be
lieve there is any serious opposi
tion to protecting the press from
searches. But one source said the
FBI and other law enforcement
groups have been lobbying with
some effectiveness against a
broader bill to protect all third
parties from searches.
The hill approved hy Bayh's
subcommittee would allow
police to get a warrant for a
search if they suspected a jour
nalist of certain kinds of criminal
activity. It would also permit
police to search a newsroom for
materials that are needed "to
prevent the death of. or serious
bodily injury to. a human being."
Even if the bill is enacted,
police would still be able to try to
obtain materials from a writer or
broadcaster through the use of a
subpoena.
However, a person served
with a subpoena has the right to
contest it in court before handing
over the materials being sought.
When police obtain a search
warrant, they may conduct a sur
prise raid and seize materials be
fore the warrant is ever chal
lenged in court.
