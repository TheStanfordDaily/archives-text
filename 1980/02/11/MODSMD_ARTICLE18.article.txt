# ASSU Council of Presidents
## ASSU open to draft debate 
### 
In his State of the Union ad
dress on Jan. 23,. President
Jimmy Carter announced his
plans to reinstate registration for
the draft in response to recent
developments in Afghanistan.
JHe suggested that registration
was not leading automatically to
the draft but that it is necessary
to begin now in order to rapidly
"meet future mobilization needs
. . . if they arise." This an
nouncement has caused the de
velopment of anti-draft move
ments reminiscent of those of the
"60s.
The present political climate is
dramatically different from last
year's and should be viewed in
that light. The student body pres
idents of the nine State of
California colleges have already
'stated their opposition to Car
ter's plans, and there has been
similar support from Stanford
students urging the ASSU Se
nate and Council of Presidents to
do the same. We (COP) feel it is
important to address the issue
promptly and thoroughly.
' Yet, in matters of conscience
and issues where the views are
deeply-held and fundamental,
our role is twofold. First, we are
here to provide support for
groups that can give students
added perspectives and informa
tion on the situation. Most of our
efforts have been directed to
ward this end. Second, once the
diversity of student opinion is de
termined. we are responsible to
reflect that opinion in its depth
and breadth of complexity.
However, it must be em
phasized that we are not exclud
ing the possibility of a statement
in the tuture. should a consensus
emerge either as a result of the
discussions on campus or of new
developments in the national
political situation. It is also im
portant to note that this is in no
way belittling the importance
and magnitude of the present
situation.

George Kennan, former am
bassador to Moscow, stated in
the New York Times last Satur
day that he could "think of no
instance in modern history
where such a breakdown of polit
ical communication and such a
triumph of unrestrained military
suspicions as now marks
Soviet-American relations has
not led. in the end. to armed con
flict."lf this should happen, the
students would pay the heaviest
price of such a clash.
It is therefore more important
now than at any other time since
the Vietnam War to begin to
seriously address the registration
process, the draft and the United
States' position in our global
community. Now is the time for
Stanford students to make an ef
fort to look beyond the academic
obligation and to participate in
the present question of U.S.
military policy.
Bernard Bailyn, in his book on
the ideological origins of the
American Revolution, wrote on
the contagion of liberty and cer
tain basic characteristics of our
system of democracy. He asserts
our most important basic right is
the ability to question authority.
He writes in relation to the U.S.
founders' intentions:
•'The details of this new world
were not as yet clearly depicted;
but faith ran high that a better
world than any that had ever
been known could be built where
authority was distrusted and held
in constant scrutiny; where the
status of men flowed from their
achievements and from their
personal qualities, not from dis
tinctions ascribed to them at
birth; and where the use of
power over the lives of men was
jealously guarded and severely
restricted. It was only where
there was this defiance, this re
fusal to truckle, this distrust of all
authority, political or social, that
institutions would express
human aspirations, not crush

them."
We urge all students to make
an effort to question authority
and make their own decision. By
doing this we are not denouncing
the United States but are rather
utilizing the basic freedoms that
this country was based on.
Please take the time to attend
the Stanford Town Hall Meet
ing: Views on Registration and
the Draft tomorrow at 7p.m.
in Kresge Auditorium, and take
the time to attend meetings and
read other information on our
present domestic and world situ
ation. It is a vital factor in our
tuture. Also don't hesitate to
utilize the COP or ASSU Senate
to help in whatever manner. We
are open to all points of \ iew and
suggestions. Obviously the situa
tion is not a clear-cut issue, and
many factors need to be consi
dered. We are only urging that
ail students make the time to
seriously think about the ques
tions.
