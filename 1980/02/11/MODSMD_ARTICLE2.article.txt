# All born in '60, '61 called
## Carter's registration proposal includes women 
### 
The Washington Post with staff reports
President Jimmy* Carter proposed
Friday that all men born in 1960 or
1961 he required to register for the
military draft later this year and said
that he will ask Congress for authority
to require women born in the same
years also to register.
In future years, all men — and
women if Congress votes to include
them — would be required to register
tqr the draft as they reach their 18th
birthday, according to the plan.
The registration would be ac
complished through the Postal Service.
Young people would be required to go
to their local Post Office and fill out a
form with their name, address, date of
birth and. at their option, their Social
Security number.
The information would be stored in
Selective Service System computers.
Draft cards would not be issued, and
there would be no physical examina
tion or classification by marital or other
status of the registrants.
The president's decision, part of his
response to the Soviet Union's invasion
of Afghanistan, is expected to set off
sharp congressional debate over both
the prospect of reviving military con
scription and the possibility of requir
ing American women to serve in the
military for the first time in history.
Women
In a written statement issued Friday
after he had left Washington for Camp
David. Md., Carter said he had no
choice but to call for the inclusion of
women in the registration system.
"There is no distinction possible, on
the basis of ability or performance, that
would allow me to exclude women
from an obligation to register." he said.
But the president also proposed con
tinuation of the tradition that women in
the military serve in noncombat roles,
although White House officials said an
effort will be made to broaden the de
finition of noncombat functions so that

women are not needlessly denied
promotions.
Opposition to women
White House officials acknowledged
that there is strong opposition in Con
gress to registering women and that this
may doom Carter's proposal. But any
attempt to require men to register
while excluding women is also ex
pected to provoke equal rights lawsuits
that could force female registration.
Reaction here
Campus reaction to the administra
tion's proposal ran the gamut from
supportive to angry.'
' It seems too arbitrary." said L.arkin
freshman John Wilson. "A difference
of two or three days can mean the dif
ference between a person who is liable
for eight years to conscription and a
person who is totally exempt."
"1 don't understand his (Carter's)
logic in building up a force of IX- to
26-year-olds over the next six years if

there's going to be a war before then,"
freshman Frank McGuire said.
Equal rights?
As to the question of registering
women, students here supported the
move on equal rights grounds, it not the
registration per se.
"You basically have to include wo
men. The whole business with the ERA
means that if you institute a draft with
out women you're back to 20 years
tfgo," sophomore Richard Friedburg
said.
"The courts will undoubtedly throw
out a-one-sex draft," Wilson added.
Calling for registration of women "is
a shrewd and daring move on Carter's
part, which will probably backfire on
him in every way." said Margaret Jen
sen of Women Against War.
, " Rather than feminists seeing it as a
supportive move for them and other
causes such as ERA." feminists are
against Carter's proposal because they

feel "there should be no registration,
period, for anyone," Jensen said.
Appropriations
The president asked Congress to ap
propriate $20.5 million this year and
$24.5 million for the fiscal year that
begins Oct. 1 to put the registration
machinery into place. Officials said
some appropriation by Congress will
be necessary even to register men. and
it is over the funding that the Congres
sional battle on whether to resume re
gistration at all will be fought.
The call for registration drew im
mediate fire Friday. Sen. Mark Hat
field (R-Ore.) said the plan "will
deeply divide the country at exactly the
time we need solidarity," while Barry
Lynn, head of an antidraft coalition of
42 organizations, said resumption of
any registration will only feed "war
hysteria."
As described by White House offi
cials, the registration system the presi

dent plans would work this way:
The initial pool of registrants would
come from among 19- and 20-year-old
men. who number some 4 million, and
— if they arc included — 19- and 20-
year-old women, another 4 million.
However, the key factor in determin
ing who would he included in this initial
pool is not a young person's age now
hut whether he or she was born in 1960
or 1961. Thus, 20-year-olds who were
born in 1959 and will turn 21 this year
would not be required to register.
Beginning next year, young people
born in 1962 would be brought into the
system as the routine registration of
18-year-olds begins.
Those required to register, including
the initial pool formed this year, would
remain eligible to be drafted through
age 26.
White House officials said the regist
ration could not begin until after Con
