## Hank Clark 'Nice' has become a verbal fig leaf 
### 
Everyone winces at certain
words. For some people, work
has that effect. For others, sex
does. A growing number of
people wince at the word chick.
For me, nice is such a term.
It's not that I find the word to
be dreary, embarrassing, or de
meaning. as some find work,sex
and chick to be. It's mainly that 1
think it no longer means any
thing.
Don't get me wrong. As a cer
tifiable member of the human
race. 1 have as much tolerance as
the next person for some occa
sional vacuous verbiage. Thus, if
someone calls a banquet "struc
turally integrative commensal
ity," 1 can with effort and a good
dictionary figure out what
they're struggling to say. Or if
someone talks about how
they've recently learned to assert
themselves more forcefully, in a

loving and caring way, I can do
my own translating. But nice is
more of a problem.
First of all, its use is not occa
sional. We allow ourselves to
modify a truly prodigious range
of things by it. A dog. a woman,
or the weather can be called nice;
a salad, college or life in general.
Sex or a flower, a job or a game,
praying or running can all be
legitimately described as nice in
our culture.
And ironically, of the seven
teen meanings of nice given in
the dictionary, only one is
applicable here:"agreeable; that
one derives pleasure or satisfac
tion from: delightful." We have
narrowed the usage of the term
at the same time that we've
broadened its scope.
It is especially in human mat
ters that this trend disturbs me. I
find nice to be an aesthetically

and sometimes morally offensive
way of summing up one's charac
ter or personality. It reduces the
subject to inoffensive confor
mity. It amounts to saying the
person is just like everyone else,
or rather like everyone one likes.
It is a subtle form of character
assassination, for it suggests that
the person is not worth the effort
it would take to describe him or
her accurately.
Nice designates the common,
not the proper. It regards social
relations, not the character or
personality of the individual.
And in the end, it means nothing
at all. Ask a Stanford under
graduate what he thinks of his
resident fellow, and he may
shoot back with enthusiasm:
"He's a nice guy." Or he may
sigh, frown, look in the distance
and say ponderously, "He's a
nice guv," trailing his voice into

that unspoken but. At that point,
we treat each other like dogs â€”
distinguishing the meanings of
similar articulations by differ
ences in tone of voice.
I grant the value of innocuous
terms like nice in lubricating the
sometimes creaky wheels of so
cial relations. But I fear we've
gotten lazy, we've spread nice
like a fig leaf to cover up our
embarrassment at the richness of
our language.
If we are sincere in our
humanitarianism, if we really be
lieve that people are the most
splendiferous creatures on God's
green earth, then we will take the
trouble to convey this belief in
our speech. As for myself, 1
would find it agreeable, pleasant,
delightful to pass a day without
hearing that insipid word nice.
