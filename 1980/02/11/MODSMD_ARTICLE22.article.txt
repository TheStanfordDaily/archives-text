No saber-rattling
• I'm afraid 1 found the Daily's
"recent editorial, linking energy
conservation with the need to
renew draft registration, both
convoluted and unwise.
A strong case can be made that
our military preparedness isn't
what it should be. But to impose
registration — the first step to
resumption of the draft — in
peacetime seems to me to be
nonsensical at best and danger
ous at worst.
If the volunteer army isn't
working now, it should be made
to — through tougher entrance
requirements, higher salaries
and better training and benefits.
The draft may be a "quick fix"
solution — but in the absence of
imminent hostilities, it is an un
conscionable interference in per
sonal liberty.
And using the military for

even a brief period as an instru
ment of national energy policy is
a mistake. A lasting solution to
our energy problems is going to
have to come in the domestic
political arena, not through in
ternational saber-rattling.
"The fault, dear Brutus, lies
not in our stars, but in ourselves
that we are underlings."

The Stanford Daily
U.S. isn't 'stuck'
A couple of Scott Richter's
statements in his article on White
Plaza rallies (Feb. 7) disturbed
me. He maintains "the only way
to avoid a nuclear war is to be
able and willing to fight a con
ventional way when necessary."
Well, another method exists;
never let the moment for war be
come necessary.

If our national security is at
stake in the Mid-East, couldn't
we examine the reasons for our
dependence there? Apparently,
the reason is oil. and Richter
acknowledges this. Unfortunat
ley he feels. "But we are stuck in
that position now and we must
live with it."
We do have alternatives. Solar
energy can provide much of
our home and hot water heating,
plus some of our electricity. Al
cohol can be used to stretch our
gasoline supplies. Wind, geoth
ermal and hydroelectric power
can provide more electricity.
Government money can he di
rected into mass transportation

systems, instead of the costly
manufacture of synthetic fuels;
synfuels require much strip min
ing and water that is already in
tended for other use.
Significantly, conservation can
reduce a fair amount of our
energy consumption; the major
ity of houses in California do not
even have insulation! So let us
not just "live with it." but correct
our policies and bad habits.

The Stanford Inter-Fraternity

Council (IFC) sponsors events
during the year that would not be
done by any individual fraternity
but will benefit the Stanford
community, student body or
fraternity system.
Three goals are kept in mind
when planning our activities: 1)
providing social events for the
entire student body, such as the
Meganooner. 2) raising funds for
worthwhile charities, as the
Aquafollies do and 3) unifying
the fraternity system. We have a
project that is consistent with
these three goals but before we
proceed we would like to solicit
your opinions.
Our project is to have an IFC

car wash and party to raise
money for charity (Leukemia
Foundation of the Children's
Hospital at Stanford).
Penthouse International, Li
mited has offered the donate the
beer, the band, and many prizes
including stereos and a mic
rowave oven that will be given
away by Penthouse Pets. Of
course the girls will be conserva
tively dressed. In exchange for
all of this. Penthouse wants to
use the car wash for publicity.
I have spoken with the Wo
men's Center and they believe
that magazines like Penthouse
perpetuate a prejudice towards
women. We do not officially en

dorse Penthouse magazine but
welcome the opportunity to have
an excellent campus party while
involving all the fraternities in an
event for charity that will raise
thousands of dollars.
In order to be more sensitive
to the feelings of the University
community, we are presenting
this idea now to make a more
responsible decision. I urge you
to wrote to the Inter-Fraternity
Council at Box 6507, Stanford,
CA 94305 if you have strong
feelings about this. I can also be
reached at 497-9220 from 4 to 5
p.m. any weekday.
