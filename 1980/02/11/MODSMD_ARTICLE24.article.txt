## Gerald Ford: the right man for the presidency 
### 
The country is in economic turmoil!
The Soviets are on the brink of controlling
our oil supply. It seems that Congress is
standing by idly while inflation eats away
our hard-earned dollars, while un
employment soars, while communists
continue their encroachment on the free
world, while America is coerced by our
emphatic need for oil.
This must stop but, unfortunately, it's
difficult to foresee that end. "There is a
way out," exclaimed former President
Gerald Ford, only two weeks ago. He is
the way out, for he offers what other pres
idential candidates fail to offer: sound
domestic and foreign policies with leader
ship qualities beyond compare. And yet
he refuses to run.
The U.S. economy has sagged to its
lowest point in 30 years. Inflation is run
ning rampant at 13.3 percent: the prime
interest rate is in double digit figures; un
employment is rising continually. But this
isn't the worst news. Our economic future
will be much worse, according to former
Secretary of the Treasury Michael Blu
menthal and chief inflation fighter Alfred
Kahn. Their predictions: no foreseeable
declines in inflation, continual runs on the
dollar and eight percent unemployment,
the highest in years!
If you remember, President Ford faced
a similar situation when he took office in
August, 1974. Inflation was at 12 percent
and the prime interest rate was also at the
1 2 percent level while unemployment was
reasonably high. After some hard-fought
battles with Congress, the results show
that the president clearly won the war.
By the time he left office, the inflation
rate was down to an unbelievable 4.8 per
cent, the prime interest rate was down to a

comfortable 6.2 percent and unemploy
ment continued to drop. The chief cause
for this was a 50 percent decrease in the
rate of growth of government spending
from M percent to 5.4 percent and this
was only put into action after 66 vetoes by
the president. Many economists feared
stagflation and recession but President
Ford remedied this by a tax reduction to
stimulate production and increase con
sumer buying. As a result, America av
oided recession.
It is clear that the United States needs
Gerald Ford to heal the economic wounds
inflicted by the present administration.
Former President Ford has always in
tensely supported a strong national de
fense. He pushed for the B-l bomber and
MX missile systems, onlv to see the B-l
bomber canceled by President Jimmy Car
ter and the Congress delay deployment of
the MX missile. He insists the United
States must rebuild its military force.
There are two ways to maintain peace
in the world today. First, by limiting arms
and striving towards general disarmament
or second, building up military strength to
a point that will deter any country from
military aggression. The latter up until
now has been the most successful for
maintaining the peace. However, the
world sees us losing our superiority over
the Russians in military strength; our ina
bility to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan
without direct military intervention only
exemplifies that deficiency.
Twenty years ago, it was possible to use
our military superiority to prevent armed
conflict. In 1962, President Kennedy suc
cessfully got the Russians out of Cuba
without military force. Today, President
Carter tries the same power move and the

political cartoonists have a field day.
Gerald Ford can get the United States
hack on track. He has the power to get
things done in Congress. He got his
economic policy passed and would have
gotten the B-l bomber and MX missile
system if he hadn't been voted out of of
fice. Hopefully it isn't too late.
The energy situation in the United
States is desperate. Presently, America is
paying more to OPEC nations for oil than
we pay our own producers. What's worse
is that the Soviet intervention in the Mid
dle East jeopardizes those supplies, and
our national security. America needs re
lief and fast; Ford has the answers.
First, Americans must conserve energy,
drive less and keep thermostats down.
The less we use, the less we import — but
this isn't enough to solve the problem.
Natural gas and oil prices must be dere
gulated in order to expand production.
Profits must be funnelled back to be rein
vested. This will allow for expanded exp
loration and exploitation of offshore oil
supplies.
Third, coal usage must be increased.
The United States has coal deposits
enough to last 300 years but traditionally
coal usage is environmentally unsafe.
Some environmental standards must be
modified to implement coal according to
President Ford. Presently, strip mining is
strictly regulated. Also, there are proces
ses such as gasification and liquefaction to
purify coal.
Finally, it is necessary to expand the
research and development of nuclear
energy and exotic fuels. President Ford
realizes that nuclear energy is not as safe
as it can be and thus promotes the con
tinuing research and development of this

energy source.
These steps would accomplish the in
tended goal if there was a chance they
could be instituted. Putting Gerald Ford
back in office is that chance to become
independent of foreign oil.
The final point I'd like to emphasize is
the fact that none of the present presiden
tial candidates offer the key leadership
quality needed to get America out of the
hole. While many are honest, able and
knowledgeable, the key quality, in thijs
only' three ; m ,rul f & re '£ n crisis, is held
by only tnrec ...f":, all important
quality is experience. Richard Nixon has
experience and in fact is quite able and
knowledgeable, but . . . President Carter
is honest and means well but the fact of
the matter is he goofed! Inflation is soar
ing and unemployment is on the rise,
while Carter has jeopardized the national
security by halting the B-l bomber and
stalling the MX missile system. Now he is
trying ineffectively to make amends.
Only former President Ford has all four
qualities. He was only in office a little over
two years, but he solved most of the na
tion s ailments both at home and abroad.
He should be in office but he refuses to
run.
We all, as Americans, see the utility of
getting the right man in the presidency.
Considering the present situation only
one man could fill this position and that
man is Gerald Ford. Therefore, a commit
tee has been formed, on campus, in favor
of drafting Ford for president. I hope you
will support this endeavor as fervently as
other students across the nation.

The country is in economic turmoil!
The Soviets are on the brink of controlling
our oil supply. It seems that Congress is
standing by idly while inflation eats away
our hard-earned dollars, while un
employment soars, while communists
continue their encroachment on the free
world, while America is coerced by our
emphatic need for oil.
This must stop but, unfortunately, it's
difficult to foresee that end. "There is a
way out," exclaimed former President
Gerald Ford, only two weeks ago. He is
the way out, for he offers what other pres
idential candidates fail to offer: sound
domestic and foreign policies with leader
ship qualities beyond compare. And yet
he refuses to run.
The U.S. economy has sagged to its
lowest point in 30 years. Inflation is run
ning rampant at 13.3 percent: the prime
interest rate is in double digit figures; un
employment is rising continually. But this
isn't the worst news. Our economic future
will be much worse, according to former
Secretary of the Treasury Michael Blu
menthal and chief inflation fighter Alfred
Kahn. Their predictions: no foreseeable
declines in inflation, continual runs on the
dollar and eight percent unemployment,
the highest in years!
If you remember, President Ford faced
a similar situation when he took office in
August, 1974. Inflation was at 12 percent
and the prime interest rate was also at the
1 2 percent level while unemployment was
reasonably high. After some hard-fought
battles with Congress, the results show
that the president clearly won the war.
By the time he left office, the inflation
rate was down to an unbelievable 4.8 per
cent, the prime interest rate was down to a

comfortable 6.2 percent and unemploy
ment continued to drop. The chief cause
for this was a 50 percent decrease in the
rate of growth of government spending
from M percent to 5.4 percent and this
was only put into action after 66 vetoes by
the president. Many economists feared
stagflation and recession but President
Ford remedied this by a tax reduction to
stimulate production and increase con
sumer buying. As a result, America av
oided recession.
It is clear that the United States needs
Gerald Ford to heal the economic wounds
inflicted by the present administration.
Former President Ford has always in
tensely supported a strong national de
fense. He pushed for the B-l bomber and
MX missile systems, onlv to see the B-l
bomber canceled by President Jimmy Car
ter and the Congress delay deployment of
the MX missile. He insists the United
States must rebuild its military force.
There are two ways to maintain peace
in the world today. First, by limiting arms
and striving towards general disarmament
or second, building up military strength to
a point that will deter any country from
military aggression. The latter up until
now has been the most successful for
maintaining the peace. However, the
world sees us losing our superiority over
the Russians in military strength; our ina
bility to get the Soviets out of Afghanistan
without direct military intervention only
exemplifies that deficiency.
Twenty years ago, it was possible to use
our military superiority to prevent armed
conflict. In 1962, President Kennedy suc
cessfully got the Russians out of Cuba
without military force. Today, President
Carter tries the same power move and the

political cartoonists have a field day.
Gerald Ford can get the United States
hack on track. He has the power to get
things done in Congress. He got his
economic policy passed and would have
gotten the B-l bomber and MX missile
system if he hadn't been voted out of of
fice. Hopefully it isn't too late.
The energy situation in the United
States is desperate. Presently, America is
paying more to OPEC nations for oil than
we pay our own producers. What's worse
is that the Soviet intervention in the Mid
dle East jeopardizes those supplies, and
our national security. America needs re
lief and fast; Ford has the answers.
First, Americans must conserve energy,
drive less and keep thermostats down.
The less we use, the less we import — but
this isn't enough to solve the problem.
Natural gas and oil prices must be dere
gulated in order to expand production.
Profits must be funnelled back to be rein
vested. This will allow for expanded exp
loration and exploitation of offshore oil
supplies.
Third, coal usage must be increased.
The United States has coal deposits
enough to last 300 years but traditionally
coal usage is environmentally unsafe.
Some environmental standards must be
modified to implement coal according to
President Ford. Presently, strip mining is
strictly regulated. Also, there are proces
ses such as gasification and liquefaction to
purify coal.
Finally, it is necessary to expand the
research and development of nuclear
energy and exotic fuels. President Ford
realizes that nuclear energy is not as safe
as it can be and thus promotes the con
tinuing research and development of this

energy source.
These steps would accomplish the in
tended goal if there was a chance they
could be instituted. Putting Gerald Ford
back in office is that chance to become
independent of foreign oil.
The final point I'd like to emphasize is
the fact that none of the present presiden
tial candidates offer the key leadership
quality needed to get America out of the
hole. While many are honest, able and
knowledgeable, the key quality, in thijs
only' three ; m ,rul f & re '£ n crisis, is held
by only tnrec ...f":, all important
quality is experience. Richard Nixon has
experience and in fact is quite able and
knowledgeable, but . . . President Carter
is honest and means well but the fact of
the matter is he goofed! Inflation is soar
ing and unemployment is on the rise,
while Carter has jeopardized the national
security by halting the B-l bomber and
stalling the MX missile system. Now he is
trying ineffectively to make amends.
Only former President Ford has all four
qualities. He was only in office a little over
two years, but he solved most of the na
tion s ailments both at home and abroad.
He should be in office but he refuses to
run.
We all, as Americans, see the utility of
