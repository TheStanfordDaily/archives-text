# On heels of normalization
## Asian program grows 
### Kathy Sheil Staff Writer 
"The Center for East Asian Studies is important
because people involved are dealing with areas of
enormous importance," said Peter Duus, director
of the Center. "Just in terms of language, one out
of every four human being speaks Chinese, and
more people speak Japanese than speak German,"
he noted.
Duus, also a history professor here, added that
this growing realization of the significance of East
Asia is the reason for the increased interest in the
center and its programs.
There are currently 17 undergraduates, 21 stu
dents in the master's program and 2 co-terminal
students in East Asian Studies. "The number is not
large, but it's increasing," Duus said. Besides the
majors, many students in other departments have a
concentration on East Asia.
East Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary prog
ram composed of over 50 faculty members from 10
different areas, including art, Asian languages,
economics, history and religious studies. Besides
offering 8.A., M.A. and Ph.D. programs, the prog
ram provides joint studies with the schools of law
and education and dual degrees with the Food
Research Institute and the Medical School.
Unique blend
" It's a rather unique program," said Duus. "The
interdisciplinary approach forces people in diffe
rent departments to talk to one another. We get a
lot of cross-fertilization."
Beth Cary, assistant director, added that, "be
cause the center is multi-faceted, people involved
have a chance to enjoy academics in less structured
activities."
In addition to its academic activities, the center
sponsors outside speakers and special programs
concerned with the area. Currently being offered is
a colloquium series on "The Republican Era in
Modern Chinese History" featuring local and visit
ing scholars. The center is also helping to promote
a series of lectures on Chinese philosophy and is
sponsoring a Japanese film series. .
Many practical career opportunities are availa
ble in the field. Duus said, especially since the
normalization of U.S. relations with China.
New openings
Normalization has brought about other changes
as well, most notably the exchange of scholars bet
ween the People's Republic of China (PRC) and
the United States. Currently 40 scholars from the
PRC study here, two in linguistics and the rest in
science and engineering.
Students in sojne first- and second-year Chinese
classes are receiving instruction from a teacher
from the Peking Language Institute. Furthermore,
nine University students are now studying lan
guages or doing research in the PRC.
Last quarter, 12 prominent scholars in the social
sciences and history gave public lectures and col
loquia at the Center.
Outreach concerns
The Center also supports programs off-campus.
The Bay Area China Education Program
(BAYCEP) and Teaching Japan in the Schools
(TJS) are outreach projects designed to relate
Stanford resources to the needs and interests of

Bay Area elementary and secondary schools.
Cooperative Teaching Projects help the smaller
colleges in the area to offer courses on East Asia by
providing some part-time teaching assistance.
Back on campus, action is underway to expand
East Asian Studies in other ways. Chrjs Heftel, a
co-terminal student in East Asian Studies and( co
chairman of the East Asian Studies Student As
. • >'//
sociation, said a committee is now attempting to
establish an East Asian Studies Theme House With
seminars and programs similar in format to those at
the American Studies House.
"There has been tremendous response," said
Heftel. "There are more than enough people in
terested." He added that the idea had been ac
cepted in theory but that no dorms are currently•
available.
The center is not officially involved in the,at
tempts to establish the house, but Cary said ttyat
"I'm sure we'll have a strong connection" with the
house if it is begun. ,
Upcoming activities
The center is sponsoring a sherry hour Feb. 25
at Okada House (formerly Junipero) to acquaint
interested students with the requirements of'the
major and with some of the faculty. The center is
also trying to develop internship programs for stu
dents in East Asian Studies.
"It's important for students to learn about areas'
like East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East,"
said Duus. "Here we are in the midst of a major
reform (establishment of the Western Culture re
quirement) when probably we should focus atten
tion on other parts of the world. Even though the
requirements might include one course in the
'non-Western' world, that really doesn't meet any
real needs," he claimed.
Wisdom of East
"The East has a very ancient, very complex, very
rich cultural tradition that pre-dates Western
civilization. We need to draw upon the West and
also reach into the East to find wisdom," Duus
said.
"Increasingly Americans are becoming aware
that their society is not completely perfect," he
said. "America is no longer in the position to be the
'missionary.' We need to begin to look around us
for answers. How does health care work in Chi#a?
Why has Japan had such great economic success?
We ought to try to reach that body of knowledge.
We need to not only learn about others, but also
from them."

In addition to its academic activities, the center
sponsors outside speakers and special programs
concerned with the area. Currently being offered is
a colloquium series on "The Republican Era in
Modern Chinese History" featuring local and visit
ing scholars. The center is also helping to promote
a series of lectures on Chinese philosophy and is
sponsoring a Japanese film series. .
Many practical career opportunities are availa
ble in the field. Duus said, especially since the
normalization of U.S. relations with China.
New openings
Normalization has brought about other changes
as well, most notably the exchange of scholars bet
ween the People's Republic of China (PRC) and
the United States. Currently 40 scholars from the
PRC study here, two in linguistics and the rest in
science and engineering.
Students in sojne first- and second-year Chinese
classes are receiving instruction from a teacher
from the Peking Language Institute. Furthermore,
nine University students are now studying lan
guages or doing research in the PRC.
Last quarter, 12 prominent scholars in the social
sciences and history gave public lectures and col
loquia at the Center.
Outreach concerns
The Center also supports programs off-campus.
The Bay Area China Education Program
(BAYCEP) and Teaching Japan in the Schools
(TJS) are outreach projects designed to relate
Stanford resources to the needs and interests of

Bay Area elementary and secondary schools.
Cooperative Teaching Projects help the smaller
colleges in the area to offer courses on East Asia by
providing some part-time teaching assistance.
Back on campus, action is underway to expand
East Asian Studies in other ways. Chrjs Heftel, a
co-terminal student in East Asian Studies and( co
chairman of the East Asian Studies Student As
. • >'//
sociation, said a committee is now attempting to
establish an East Asian Studies Theme House With
seminars and programs similar in format to those at
the American Studies House.
"There has been tremendous response," said
Heftel. "There are more than enough people in
terested." He added that the idea had been ac
cepted in theory but that no dorms are currently•
available.
The center is not officially involved in the,at
tempts to establish the house, but Cary said ttyat
"I'm sure we'll have a strong connection" with the
house if it is begun. ,
Upcoming activities
The center is sponsoring a sherry hour Feb. 25
at Okada House (formerly Junipero) to acquaint
interested students with the requirements of'the
major and with some of the faculty. The center is
also trying to develop internship programs for stu
dents in East Asian Studies.
"It's important for students to learn about areas'
like East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East,"
said Duus. "Here we are in the midst of a major
reform (establishment of the Western Culture re
quirement) when probably we should focus atten
tion on other parts of the world. Even though the
requirements might include one course in the
'non-Western' world, that really doesn't meet any
real needs," he claimed.
Wisdom of East
"The East has a very ancient, very complex, very
rich cultural tradition that pre-dates Western
civilization. We need to draw upon the West and
also reach into the East to find wisdom," Duus
said.
"Increasingly Americans are becoming aware
that their society is not completely perfect," he
said. "America is no longer in the position to be the
'missionary.' We need to begin to look around us
for answers. How does health care work in Chi#a?
Why has Japan had such great economic success?
We ought to try to reach that body of knowledge.
We need to not only learn about others, but also
from them."
"The Center for East Asian Studies is important
because people involved are dealing with areas of
enormous importance," said Peter Duus, director
of the Center. "Just in terms of language, one out
of every four human being speaks Chinese, and
more people speak Japanese than speak German,"
he noted.
Duus, also a history professor here, added that
this growing realization of the significance of East
Asia is the reason for the increased interest in the
center and its programs.
There are currently 17 undergraduates, 21 stu
dents in the master's program and 2 co-terminal
students in East Asian Studies. "The number is not
large, but it's increasing," Duus said. Besides the
majors, many students in other departments have a
concentration on East Asia.
East Asian Studies is an interdisciplinary prog
ram composed of over 50 faculty members from 10
different areas, including art, Asian languages,
economics, history and religious studies. Besides
offering 8.A., M.A. and Ph.D. programs, the prog
ram provides joint studies with the schools of law
and education and dual degrees with the Food
Research Institute and the Medical School.
Unique blend
" It's a rather unique program," said Duus. "The
interdisciplinary approach forces people in diffe
rent departments to talk to one another. We get a
lot of cross-fertilization."
Beth Cary, assistant director, added that, "be
cause the center is multi-faceted, people involved
have a chance to enjoy academics in less structured
activities."
