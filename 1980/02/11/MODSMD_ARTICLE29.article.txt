# 'We've got nothing to lose now'
## Cardinals cannot cage Cougars 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
The Washington State
Cougars, boosted by senior for
ward Don Collins' 26 points,
thwarted every effort Stanford
could muster as the Cardinals
tried to pull themselves off the
lonely bottom rung of the Pac-10
ladder Saturday night. The
Cards bowed to the Cougars for
the second time this season,
93-75, in a game which figured
to be as lopsided as Stanford's
won-lost record (3-17) but
which turned out to be closer
than anyone expected.
The 18-point final spread is
misleading unless one considers
that the Cards brought the game
to within four points on a neat,
spinning Kimberly Belton lay-in
with 8:30 remaining, and kept it
within 10 for most of the game.
Washington State coach
George Raveling, in fact, had no
thing but praise for the ailing
Stanford team saying after the
game that, " 1 was extremely dis
appointed with our defense but 1
was also impressed with Stan
ford's offense. Their offensive
concepts were very good. They
were patient, took good shots
and. in the stretch, got the ball to
their money players: (Brian)
Welch and Belton. We just
couldn't stop Belton. He's a very
good basketball player."
The Cards were patient but
more importantly, they showed
they are capable of running
reasonably well with a fine fast
break team like Washington
State. Stanford coach Dick Di-

Biaso spoke of controlling the
hall on offense against WSU ear
lier in the week. But Stanford
took the ball right to the
Cougars, running with them, not
holding the hall much, and they
jumped to a rare four minute
lead as guard Doug Barnes hit
three in a row from outside 15
feet. It wasn't until forward Bel
ton was taken out with three
fouls and the score still tight at
23-19 that Washington State
began to pull away to their 46-37
halftime lead. Aaron Haskings
scored four points, filling in for
6-foot-11 center Stuart House
(who went out with three fouls
right after Belton) and Collins
put in six of his I 1 first half
points.
Belton returned to the lineup,
though, in the second half to
complement Orlando Ward and
Tom Schmalzried. Schmalzried
was the biggest*surprise of the
night, coming in to score 10
points and snag nine rebounds
during his longest playing stint
(29'/2 minutes) since the first
game of the season against Air
Force.
Collins kept hitting for WSU
and teammate John Preston col
lected 16 points but Stanford
kept coming via the shooting
touch of Brian Welch who
finished with 12 points and the
under-the-basket acrobatics of
Belton who scored 14. After
reaching that four point spread
with eight minutes left, though,
Stanford ran out of gas and then
ran out of time. Washington
State spread it out to 10 again

with 3:27 left and Stanford had
to resort to stop-fouls to combat
a WSU stall game. Guard Bryan
Rison sank seven free-throws
and the game was over.
The Cardinals were simply
tired. Doug Barnes and Brian
Welch were playing with the tlu,
but Ravelling also pointed out
that, "Stanford plays good for 30
minutes but unfortunately its a
40 minute game. They run out of
gas because they don't have
much support off the bench."
Dißiaso added, "We played
very well and had it down to a six
point game at the five minute
mark. But our lack of stamina
started to show at key junctures
of the game when we simply
couldn't do it on defense.
"Washington State is an
NCAA tournament team. 1 be
lieve they had only nine or 10
turnovers in the game. And they
put on a great shooting exhibi
tion, too."
So what does coach Dißiaso
tell the team, a squad down 1-11
in Pac-10 play, to make them be
lieve in Stanford basketball for
the rest of the season? They face
Washington tonight at 8:05 and
no one expects them to win.
"What do 1 tell them?" said
Dißiaso Saturday night. "I'll tell
them we've improved and we'll
beat somebody. They have to be
lieve that. We've played well
these last four games. Those are
not hollow words."
Brian Welch put it in a diffe
rent light.

"We have nothing to lose,"
said the 6-7 forward. "Maybe
next year we can put it together
but this year we're just going to
stay loose and see what happens.
Now we want to just go out and
knock somebody off."
The Cardinals certainly don't
have anything to lose. Unless
they can win four out of the six
games left, they are headed for
the worst season in Stanford
basketball history. That they can
is unlikely. The biggest question
now about the program is con
cerning the future of coach Di-
Biaso. In his five years on the
Farm, the Cards have never had
a winning record. Five years is a
long time and though the admis
sions standards at Stanford obvi
ously hamper recruiting, some
have begun to question the
coaching as well. Coach Ravel
ling disagrees.
"I went through the same
thing at Washington State for
three years," he said." Dißiaso is
doing a good job under the cir
cumstances. They have a lot of
games this year that they've lost
by small margins. 1 think Di-
Biaso is one of the best prepared
coaches around. This is not an
easy league to be in but given the
time he'll do it."
He'll have a chance to start to
night as the Cards take on the
Washington Huskies, but it's a
long road ahead.
