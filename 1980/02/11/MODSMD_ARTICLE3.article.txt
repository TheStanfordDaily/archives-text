# Safeway strike talks continue unresolved
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
Whether in newsprint or on foot,
signs of the Safeway strike are evident
throughout the Bay Area. Parades of
strikers maintain a steady vigil over a
near-empty parking lot. A full-page
advertisement in The San Francisco
Chronicle has asked for eontinued pat
ronage at local supermarket chains.
Though negotiations are continuing as
the strike enters its fourth week, there
is no immediate end in sight.
The controversy began at a union
meeting on Jan. 13 when a strike vote
was authorized. One week later, the
employer's final offer on a contract
proposal was deemed "unacceptable,"
and after futile negotiations, the Retail
Store Employees Union voted to

strike, targeting their protest against
Bay Area Safe ways.
The Food Employers Council, a col
laboration of the major chains (Alpha
Beta, Lucky, Safeway. Ralph's), has of
fered a contract that would deny sev
eral employee benefits now guaran
teed. These " take-aways" are the focal
point of the controversy.
Neither Safeway nor Food
Employer's Council spokesmen made
themselves available for comment on
the strike issues.
"We're not fighting for pay. we're
lighting for benefits," explained May
Tenirasis, a six-year employee. "A lot
of people don't sympathize with us be
cause they don't understand what
we're asking for," echoed Nancy
Sotomayor, a striking retail clerk. "We
do make good money but we're mis
represented. Our job is good, we're
just trying to keep it that way. Safeway
is making us out to be a bunch of pigs."
Stephen Stamm, a labor organizing
representative, clarified the union's
position. Stamm criticized the current
advertising campaign waged by Safe
way, saying it inflates the salary issue
and is "extremely misleading."
Proposed increase misleading
The average clerk's salary is $ 13,000
and a journeyman clerk who worked at
the top rate of $8.79 an hour would
make $ 19,000, Stamm said. The salary
increase Safeway advertised pertains
only to senior head clerks, a group of
200 out of the 10,000 Bay Area
employees, he added.
The "distorted ads" highlight the fi
nancial component. The strikers voiced
concern over other issues, demanding
that specific changes in the proposal be
reinstated to ensure continued be
nefits.
Current policy allows a 60-day ex
tension maternity leave after release
from a physician. The new contract
stipulates that women must return, or
forfeit their jobs immediately upon
doctor's recommendation.
"This is a vicious proposal," said
Stamm. "When a woman goes on
maternity leave, she is not paid, there is
no economic compensation to begin
with. They want to change the contract

at the expense of the mother. Most of
the negotiators are men and they don't
have to deal with it,"he added.
Part-time seniority "stripped 1
Another proposed alteration from
previous policy would "strip seniority
from anyone who doesn't work full
time," explained Stamm. "We recog
nize the need for part-time workers but
they (the Food Employer's Council)
should realize that people cannot live
on part-time hours their whole life."
The new proposal would reduce sev
eral benefits now given to part-time
employees, most significantly their
privilege to bid for additional hours
four times a year. "This leaves the
workers at the mercy of management
and the proposal is aimed at the bulk of
part-time workers, who are primarily
women and students," said Stamm.
Student response here was generally
sympathetic to the strikers, although
several people called the salary in
crease "ridiculous."
" I'm a little sensitive to the issue be
cause my wife is a retail clerk, and I
wouldn't shop there, no," said John
Bridgeman, a graduate student. "I ha
ven't shopped there since the farmer's
boycott, and I wouldn't shop there
now," said Peter Briener, a graduate
student in political science.
"I go there occasionally — it's most
accessible," graduate engineering stu
dent Jan Crawford said.
Community supports strike
Though many remarks were tinged
with humor, the community consensus
here was favorable to honoring the pic
ket lines.
"1 went there the other day, cashed a
check and went to Co-op," said
Michele Rogers, a senior.
Some student criticism was directed
against union leadership's possible
exploitation of members during a
strike. The strike leaders continue
working for salary while the strikers
forfeit all income. Despite this, the
strikers must picket a minimum of 20
hours a week. Stamm explained this
saying," I'm still working. If we were on
strike, we wouldn't get paid either.
Some union leaders are working in ex
cess of 100 hours a week," he added.

It's been rumored that the interna
tional vice president of the union has
terminated his salary for the duration
of the strike, he said.
Judging from the lack of commotion
in the aisles, many customers have
been influenced by the strikers. "If
they can brave the gauntlet of protest,
then they come in," said Ted Ross, one
of the recent employees hired to cover
vacant shifts.

Some union leaders are working in ex
cess of 100 hours a week," he added.

It's been rumored that the interna
tional vice president of the union has
terminated his salary for the duration
of the strike, he said.
Judging from the lack of commotion
in the aisles, many customers have
been influenced by the strikers. "If
they can brave the gauntlet of protest,
then they come in," said Ted Ross, one
of the recent employees hired to cover

Three vigilant strikers continue their protest at a local Safeway store.
Negotiations press on without respite.
Whether in newsprint or on foot,
signs of the Safeway strike are evident
throughout the Bay Area. Parades of
strikers maintain a steady vigil over a
near-empty parking lot. A full-page
advertisement in The San Francisco
Chronicle has asked for eontinued pat
ronage at local supermarket chains.
Though negotiations are continuing as
the strike enters its fourth week, there
is no immediate end in sight.
The controversy began at a union
meeting on Jan. 13 when a strike vote
was authorized. One week later, the
employer's final offer on a contract
proposal was deemed "unacceptable,"
and after futile negotiations, the Retail
Store Employees Union voted to

strike, targeting their protest against
Bay Area Safe ways.
The Food Employers Council, a col
laboration of the major chains (Alpha
Beta, Lucky, Safeway. Ralph's), has of
fered a contract that would deny sev
eral employee benefits now guaran
teed. These " take-aways" are the focal
point of the controversy.
Neither Safeway nor Food
Employer's Council spokesmen made
themselves available for comment on
the strike issues.
"We're not fighting for pay. we're
lighting for benefits," explained May
Tenirasis, a six-year employee. "A lot
of people don't sympathize with us be
cause they don't understand what
we're asking for," echoed Nancy
Sotomayor, a striking retail clerk. "We
do make good money but we're mis
represented. Our job is good, we're
just trying to keep it that way. Safeway
is making us out to be a bunch of pigs."
Stephen Stamm, a labor organizing
representative, clarified the union's
position. Stamm criticized the current
advertising campaign waged by Safe
way, saying it inflates the salary issue
and is "extremely misleading."
Proposed increase misleading
The average clerk's salary is $ 13,000
and a journeyman clerk who worked at
the top rate of $8.79 an hour would
make $ 19,000, Stamm said. The salary
increase Safeway advertised pertains
only to senior head clerks, a group of
200 out of the 10,000 Bay Area
employees, he added.
The "distorted ads" highlight the fi
nancial component. The strikers voiced
concern over other issues, demanding
that specific changes in the proposal be
reinstated to ensure continued be
nefits.
Current policy allows a 60-day ex
tension maternity leave after release
from a physician. The new contract
stipulates that women must return, or
forfeit their jobs immediately upon
doctor's recommendation.
"This is a vicious proposal," said
Stamm. "When a woman goes on
maternity leave, she is not paid, there is
no economic compensation to begin
with. They want to change the contract

at the expense of the mother. Most of
the negotiators are men and they don't
have to deal with it,"he added.
Part-time seniority "stripped 1
Another proposed alteration from
previous policy would "strip seniority
from anyone who doesn't work full
time," explained Stamm. "We recog
nize the need for part-time workers but
they (the Food Employer's Council)
should realize that people cannot live
on part-time hours their whole life."
The new proposal would reduce sev
eral benefits now given to part-time
employees, most significantly their
privilege to bid for additional hours
four times a year. "This leaves the
workers at the mercy of management
and the proposal is aimed at the bulk of
part-time workers, who are primarily
women and students," said Stamm.
Student response here was generally
sympathetic to the strikers, although
several people called the salary in
crease "ridiculous."
" I'm a little sensitive to the issue be
cause my wife is a retail clerk, and I
wouldn't shop there, no," said John
Bridgeman, a graduate student. "I ha
ven't shopped there since the farmer's
boycott, and I wouldn't shop there
now," said Peter Briener, a graduate
student in political science.
"I go there occasionally — it's most
accessible," graduate engineering stu
dent Jan Crawford said.
Community supports strike
Though many remarks were tinged
with humor, the community consensus
here was favorable to honoring the pic
ket lines.
"1 went there the other day, cashed a
check and went to Co-op," said
Michele Rogers, a senior.
Some student criticism was directed
against union leadership's possible
exploitation of members during a
strike. The strike leaders continue
working for salary while the strikers
forfeit all income. Despite this, the
strikers must picket a minimum of 20
hours a week. Stamm explained this
saying," I'm still working. If we were on
strike, we wouldn't get paid either.
