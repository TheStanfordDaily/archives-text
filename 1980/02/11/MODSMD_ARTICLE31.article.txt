Coaches named
Three assistant coaches from
Stanford's 1979 football staff
have been retained by new head
coach Paul Wiggin.
Wiggin said that the contracts
of Ray Handley. Al Lavan and
Jim Fassel would be extended
an additional year. All three
coaches will continue to handle
their specialties â€” Handley with
outside linebackers, Lavan with
running backs and Fassel with
receivers.
"I have known and respected
both Ray (Handley) and Al (La
van) for many years." said Wig
gin. "Ray is a highly-organized
person who attended Stanford
and has a tremendous feeling for
the University. And I've been
aware of Al's abilities for a long
time.
"Although 1 did not know Jim
(Fassel) personally, I have be
come overly impressed with his
philosophy of football. He be
lieves in a wide-open style of of
fense. which is critical for us to
retain at Stanford."
Wiggin indicated that other
coaches from last year's staff are
being heavily considered for the

remaining assistant positions.
"We have not made any deci
sions about the remainder of our
coaching staff," Wiggin noted.
"However, due to the severe
timetable for recruiting, that
must take the top priority right
now."
