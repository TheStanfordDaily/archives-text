The Cardinal nine took hat
ting practice against Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo over the weekend
rapping out a total of 43 hits in
the three game series and adding
another three games to its untar
nished win-loss record, now 8-0.
Stanford clobbered C";il I'oly-
SLO 12-5 in Friday's single
game, battled back from a four
run deficit in the first game of the
Saturday doubleheader to win
14-9 and shut out the Mustangs
4-0 in the final game of the first
away series ot the 19N0 schedule.
" It was a good test for us." said
Cardinal head coach Mark Mar
quess. "Their team (Cal Poly)
hit the ball exceptionally well."
But Stanford was awesome at
the plate.
Catcher Bill Worden belted
two more home runs over the
weekend, one on Friday and one
on Saturday, and had one double

as he went 5 tor 14 with 5 RBI
for the series.
Again, the freshmen on the
team provided much of the of
fensive showing put on b\ the
Cards. Mike Aldrete. a first

terey, gathered four hits in four
at hats in Friday's game as desig
nated hitter, and ended up 6 for
10 overall. The weekend
boosted Aldrete*s batting aver
age to .556, which leads the
team.
Steve Buechele. freshman
third baseman and John Elwav,
freshman right fielder, also hit
well this past weekend. Buechele
had seven hits in 14 at bats with
six RBI and Elway went 6 for I 2

able at the plate than he has all
season.
The real story about the games
this weekend lies in the pitching.
Sophomore right hander Brian
Mignano pitched the first

complete-game shut-out for
Stanford in at least the last two
years in the tinal game of the
series. Mignano was hit hard in
the first couple of innings of that
game, but fortunately the hits
were line drives that were caught
by Cardinal fielders.
Throwing primarily fastballs
and sliders. Mignano eased
through the third, fourth and
fifth innings.
"I was really happy about the
game.'' said Mignano, "the ball
was mo\ ing really well. But I got
a little wild in the sixth and
seventh and 1 walked a couple of
batters," he said.
Mignano gave up only four
hits, walked four and struck out
three.
All three starting pitchers got
good, long workouts this
weekend. Lee Cline started Fri
day's game and worked his way
through eight full innings before
