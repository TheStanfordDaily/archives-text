Continuing to follow a
schedule with road trips that
would make a travel agent
proud, Stanford's gymnastics
squads fared well in action this
weekend.
Sadao Hamada's men's team
handily defeated Cal State-
Northridge and UC-Santa Bar
bara Friday night and came up
16 points short against L.ong
Beach City College Saturday
night.
Seemingly a world away in
eight-degree weather. Jackie

Walker's troupe placed sixth at
the Utah State Invitational
Saturday night.
Paced by Tad Bostick's win
ning all-around performance of
52.50 points, the Cardinals hit
252.90. followed by Northridge
with 171.55 and Santa Barbara
at 156.80.'
Besides the first-place finish
overall, Bostick also tied team
mate Brian Nelson for third on
high bar (9.25). took third on
pommel horse (8.35) and rings
(8.50). second in floor exercise
(8.50). tied for first on parallel
bars with Card Mike Lee (8.15)

and won vaulting with a 9.30 ef
fort.
Lee was second in all-around
with 51.30, equalled fellow all
arounder Dav id Hyde for second

on horse with 8.50. Bob Maga
nini paced the floor event with

9.30 and Craig Goldman con
tinued to excel on rings, winning
with a 9.11) routine.
I or Stanford, I ec earned third
in all-around with 52.10 and
third in vaulting with 9.20.
Goldman took second on rings
with 9.20.
Over in Utah, a "mini
nationals" as Walker put it, was
taking shape. Included in the
Utah State Invitational were
seven of the top 20 teams in the
country. The outcome ol the
competition was close to the cur
rent rankings. Third-rated Utah
took top team honors (144.50),
followed by ninth-ranked
Arizona State (139.95),
e Ie ve nt hr -r a te d L o uisi a n a
(138.15) and number seven
Brigham Young University.
Host Utah State, currently
voted I 2th in the nation, finished
tilth at 136.55. while INth-rated
Stanford placed sixth (134.15)'
and 20th-ranked Arizona was
seventh with 132.20.
In the all-around competition,
the meet results didn't adhere as
closely to the present individual
rankings.
Stanford's Karen Hall, ranked
20th in the latest poll, earned
10th with a 34.70 total.
1 kill also took seventh in floor
