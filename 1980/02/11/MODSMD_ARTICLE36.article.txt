# Lady Broncos scare Cards
## 
### Richard Martinez Sports Editor 
The progress of women's bas
ketball, and the Northern
California Athletic Conference
in particular, was made very evi
dent Saturday night at Maples
Pavilion as Stanford women's
team edged Santa Clara 77-69.
in a closer game than the score
indicates.
Experiencing a letdown from
their tough loss to UC-Berkeley
last week, the Cards came out a
little slow. "We weren't playing
our usual aggressive style of de
fense." explained forward
Jeanne Ruark. "We gave them
too many open outside shots and
they took it to us."
Stanford saw its 28-20 lead
with six minutes left in the first
half, dwindle to a 2K-2K tie with
three minutes to go.
For the remaining time, Santa
Clara remained close with Stan
ford retiring to the dressing room
with a 38-37 lead.
Ruark contributed 16 points
and six rebounds while Kim
Kupferer added eight to the
Cards' first half effort. Santa
Clara was led by forward Karen
Ulmer who had 14 points in the
first 20 minutes.

Stanford's rough ride of the
first half continued into the
opening moments of the second
period as the Lady Broncos
grabbed the lead three separate
times.
Tiny Santa Clara guard Julie
Long gave Stanford's backcourt
fits all night as her scrappy play
forced several turnovers.
The Cards finally started play
ing their game, however, as
Ruark began her usual shooting
exhibition and they took control
of the inside play.
Debi Gore broke a 60-60 tie
with a second-effort basket and
Ruark put the Cards ahead
65-62 with a three-point play.
Santa Clara refused to give up.
however, as they pulled within
one point. 68-67, with 3:30 to
play. Three minutes later a Gore
steal and basket sealed the Stan
ford victory with a six-point lead.
Ruark hit a meaningless shot at
the buzzer to widen the margin
to eight.
Last year Santa Clara was in
the "statistics booster" part of
the division. The only thing
people wanted to find out was
how many points each player
scored. That seems to have
changed with Saturday night's
performance. The NorCal
league hopes to progress to the
stage when no team will be con
sidered an automatic victory.
Ruark led the team with 28
points and 1 1 rebounds. Kathy
Schultz. Kim Kupferer and
Kathy Murphy contributed tine
performances and, as of late,
have come to be fixtures in the
Cardinal line-up. Schultz had 14
points and seven rebounds. Kup
ferer added 1 1 points and five
boards while Murphy tallied
eight points and five rebounds.
Noticeably absent from the
starting lineup for the third
straight game was sophomore
Angie Paccione. A first-team All
Conference guard last year, Pac
cione has seen minimal action in
recent games.
"We needed someone who
would give us the points,"
explained coach Dotty McCrea.

"She hasn't been doing that
lately so she hasn't been play
ing."
While McCrea asserted that
"she is taking it well," one may
wonder how well a slumping star
can feel about not getting the
playing time to break out ol her
poor play.
Stantord is now 5-3 in league
play, remaining unbeaten in
Maples Pavilion this year. The
Cards travel to the University ot
Pacific tomorrow evening. 1 hey
must win all remaining games to
get a berth into the regional
playoffs.

and six rebounds while Kim
Kupferer added eight to the
Cards' first half effort. Santa
Clara was led by forward Karen
Ulmer who had 14 points in the
first 20 minutes.

Stanford's rough ride of the
first half continued into the
opening moments of the second
period as the Lady Broncos
grabbed the lead three separate
times.
Tiny Santa Clara guard Julie
Long gave Stanford's backcourt
fits all night as her scrappy play
forced several turnovers.
The Cards finally started play
ing their game, however, as
Ruark began her usual shooting
exhibition and they took control
of the inside play.
Debi Gore broke a 60-60 tie
with a second-effort basket and
Ruark put the Cards ahead
65-62 with a three-point play.
Santa Clara refused to give up.
however, as they pulled within
one point. 68-67, with 3:30 to
play. Three minutes later a Gore
steal and basket sealed the Stan
ford victory with a six-point lead.
Ruark hit a meaningless shot at
the buzzer to widen the margin
to eight.
Last year Santa Clara was in
the "statistics booster" part of
the division. The only thing
people wanted to find out was
how many points each player
scored. That seems to have
changed with Saturday night's
performance. The NorCal
league hopes to progress to the
stage when no team will be con
sidered an automatic victory.
Ruark led the team with 28
points and 1 1 rebounds. Kathy
Schultz. Kim Kupferer and
Kathy Murphy contributed tine
performances and, as of late,
have come to be fixtures in the
Cardinal line-up. Schultz had 14
points and seven rebounds. Kup
ferer added 1 1 points and five
boards while Murphy tallied
eight points and five rebounds.
Noticeably absent from the
starting lineup for the third
straight game was sophomore
Angie Paccione. A first-team All
Conference guard last year, Pac
cione has seen minimal action in
recent games.
"We needed someone who
would give us the points,"
explained coach Dotty McCrea.

"She hasn't been doing that
lately so she hasn't been play
ing."
While McCrea asserted that
"she is taking it well," one may
wonder how well a slumping star
can feel about not getting the
playing time to break out ol her
poor play.
Stantord is now 5-3 in league
play, remaining unbeaten in
Maples Pavilion this year. The
Cards travel to the University ot
Pacific tomorrow evening. 1 hey
must win all remaining games to
get a berth into the regional
playoffs.
