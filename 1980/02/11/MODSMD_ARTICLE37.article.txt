# Coach Yates inspires Card golfers
## 
### John Julius Staff Writer 
Ask most first-year coaches
about their team's chances and
they'll say "building." Ask
first-year coach David Yates of
the men's golf team and he'll say
"winning."
"If we work hard and play to
the best of our ability, then the
rest will fall into place," explains
the newly-arrived coach from
West Point Academy. "If we ac
cept those goals, then we'll do
well. II we don't do well, then we
just aren't good enough. But I
think we're going to surprise a lot
of people."
Although he accepted the job
as head coach less than two
weeks ago, Yates has already
impressed the members of the
team, who share his confidence.
"The whole team has something
to prove," comments junior
Doug Clarke. "Everyone from
the Athletic Department to the
alumni are pressuring us. We
think we're better than everyone
else thinks we are. II we can't
prove it this year then for sure
we'll show it next year."
Led by Clarke, senior Steve
Schroeder, and sophomores Neil
Robinson and David Games, the
only thing missing for a number
one team are equally talented
backups. "We're a player or two
away from challenging for the
NCAA championship," says
Yates. "This team is as solid as
any in the nation through three
or four players. Success depends
011 the remaining players: they
have to have a good year for us to
win."
To come from West Point,
where players would rather
shoot a target than a birdie, to an
environment like Stanford must
have been difficult for Yates.
"West Point teams had a 54-3

record while 1 was ;i coach. We
won two tournaments â€” some
thing West Point had never
done. But winning isn't my
philosophy. I want the kids to
have a great college experience.
Academics are first, then golf."
But Yates believes practice is
essential to improving players.
"My job is to develop these kids
into good golfers and the way
they're going to do that is prac
tice. Everyone is out working on
their game. I'm sure they're try
ing to impress me. I want to see
who's out practicing in April or
May."
Schroeder echoes his feelings.
" People are enthusiastic because
it's the beginning of the season
and they haven't competed since
before Christmas. Come April,
when school and golf gets to be a
grind, it will be hack to normal.
For the first time in a year and a
half, the players are excited and a
lot of that is due to Yates."
But what if someone on the
team doesn't put in the effort the
coach wants to see? "First a
warning, then suspension, then
they're gone. There will be no
prima donnas on this team,"
cautioned Yates.
For this year, the coach has set
some lofty goals. "There's no
reason Stanford shouldn't be one
of the best teams in the country. I
don't look at this as a rebuilding
year. The talent is here now. I
want to win now. Once this team
learns to w in. they'll like it, and it
will he awfully hard to lose."
Team members have set
equally high standards. "By the
quality of our play and the
people we have. I think we
should beat DSC and UCLA in a
big tournament and finish in the
top five in the NCAA." says
Schroeder. Robinson has similar
expectations. "We have the

capability to finish in the top live
in every tournament we play in.
including the NCAA's."
Team leader Clarke has a
good shot at individual honors
this year. "There isn't a team in
the country that wouldn't want
him on their team," claims
Yates. "Clarke has the potential
to he the number one player in
the country, if he practices at it,"
adds Schroeder. "Clarke has
been playing super lately,"
Robinson comments. "Me has
the capability to be an excellent
player; he's got one of the best
swings in college golf."
Games has equal ability. Yates
believes "he hasn't even
scratched the surface of his po
tential. II he can reach his poten
tial. we'll be tough."
Schroeder will be defending
his individual title in the John
Burns' Intercollegiate Tourna
ment in Hawaii February 20 to
22, and looks to be a consistent

player this year. "Schroeder has
gotten better every year," says
Clarke. Yates adds, "Steve is a
very solid player and he'll add a
lot to our team."
The surprise of the year is
probably Robinson. "Last year
lie had to struggle to break 75.
This year he's upset it he doesn't.
Neil has improved by tar the best
of anyone on the team," says
Clarke.
With the recruiting season at
its height, Stanford appears to be
building even stronger teams.
"We are pursuing the best re
cruit class in the nation," em
phasized Yates. "If we get the
kids we want, Stanford golf will
be strong for a long time to
come. When I arrived
last week we started climbing a
mountain. We're moving up the
mountain and it's getting
steeper. There isn't a peak at the
top, but a plateau, a big plateau.
We're going to win and keep
winning."
