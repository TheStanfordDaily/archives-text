Afghan rebels retake two towns
KARACHI. Pakistan — Moslem rebels recap
tured two towns in Badakhshan province in northeast
Afghanistan yesterday and laid siege to the capital
city of Faizabad in bitter fighting with Soviet troops, a
Pakistani newspaper reported.
The daily newspaper7a«g said the rebels seized the
towns of Tashkan Arbo and Bagh in the Kashna
district of Badakhshan. and that fighting continued in
nearby Zebak. It said they seized arms, ammunition
and food from the fleeing Soviet troops.
In Moscow, the Communist Party newspaper
Pravda charged that the United States — with the
backing of Pakistan and China — is striving to step up
offensive operations by the Afghan guerrillas.
The Soviet news media made no direct mention of
Western reports that in coming weeks Moscow may
withdraw some of the estimated 90,000 Russian
troops now in Afghanistan.
r U.S. officials have said they expect the Soviets will
make only a "cosmetic" withdrawal in an attempt to
defuse Western opposition to the intervention.
A Pravda commentary repeated the Kremlin's
previously stated position that if outside "interfer
ence" in Afghanistan ceases, "the limited Soviet
military contingent . . . will return home."

Byrd: don't register women yet
WASHINGTON — Senate Majority Leader
Robert Byrd (D-W.Va.) said yesterday that he sup
ports the idea of registering women for the draft but
that it is a step that should not be taken at this time.
"I would support registration for women but I
think from a practical standpoint that it would be best
not to proceed with that immediately in the Congress
because it would create some divisiveness, and I am
afraid the wrong signal could be sent to our possible
adversaries and to our friends around the world,"
Byrd said.
A divisive debate could indicate that the country is
not united, Byrd said, adding:
"The important thing as of now, I think, is to reins
titute the registration of men." He said President
Jimmy Carter already has authority to revive registra
tion and "1 think he should use it."
Byrd. interviewed on NBCs Meet the Press, also
said he was shocked by last week's bribery allegations
involving eight members of Congress.
But he replied with a Hat "no" when asked if the
scandal suggested that Congress is "a sick institution
and rife with corruption."
Israelis free to inhabit Hebron
HEBRON, Occupied West Bank — Israel's gov
ernment declared yesterday there is "no impedi
ment" to Jewish civilian settlers' moving into this
all-Arab West Bank city, although it postponed a
decision on when Jewish habitation here will begin.
Although the cabinet did not characterize it as
such, yesterday's decision set the stage for a funda
mental shift in Israel's settlement policy on the West
Bank and appeared to have far-reaching political
consequences both in Israel and abroad.
The government long has defended the right of
Jewish settlers to live anywhere on the West Bank
and in the Gaza Strip, but in practice the military
governors of the occupied territories have prohibited
settlement in urban areas populated by Palestinian
Arabs.
As a consequence, all of the approximately 100
Jewish settlements in the two areas are in sparsely
populated rural areas, with the exception of one il
legal sit-in protest that is being staged by seven
families in a former Jewish clinic in downtown Heb
ron.
The ultranationalist settlement movement. Gush
Emunim (Faith Bloc) has been pressing Prime Minis
ter Menachem Begin to reverse the military govern
ment's policy, and to sponsor Jewish habitation in
such West Bank cities as Nablus, Ramallah ansi Heb
ron.

terday.

The year-long FBI operation, code-named
"Brilab" for bribery-labor, also reportedly has led to
suburban New Orleans rackets figure Carlos Mar
cello, labor leaders and politicians m Texas, Ok
lahoma and Arkansas.
At least two legislative leaders in Texas and Ok
lahoma admitted over the weekend they accepted
large sums of money following meetings to discuss
state insurance contracts, but said they had no inten
tion of keeping the money.
The Baton Rouse Sunday Advocate, in a copyright
story, said 13 Louisiana officials were subpoenaed to
appear this week before a grand jury in New Orleans
that convenes today.
The Sunday Advocate said witnesses subpoenaed
to appear before the grand jury include Gov. Edwin
Edwards, Lt. Gov. Jimmy Fitzmorris, Lt. Gov.-elect
Bobby Freeman, state Treasurer Mary Evelyn
Parker, state Sen. Edgar Mouton of Lafayette, state
Rep. Harry Hollins of Lake Charles, and seven per
sons associated with the State Employees Group Be

Highway sniper wounds driver
SAN JOSE — Authorities were unsure yesterday
whether more than one sniper has been firing on
highway motorists in recent weeks, leaving one of
them in a coma with a bullet wound in the head.
Wounded by gunfire Saturday was Michael Alvin
Percelle. 24, of Santa Cruz, who was listed in critical
condition on special life support systems at San Jose
Hospital.
It was the second sniping incident in two weeks. On
Jan. 29, 35 shots were sprayed into two autos on the
Nimitz Freeway, but neither of the drivers were in
jured. While police said they were investigating pos
sible similarities, they declined to link the wounding
of Percelle with the others.
Percelle was southbound in his car on Highway 101
and was preparing to exit when a bullet passed
through the driver's window, hitting him in the tem
ple above the ear.
A ha If-hour after the 6:28 p.m. shoot
ing, police received three sniping reports on either
Highway 101 or Interstate 680, but no injuries were
reported.
