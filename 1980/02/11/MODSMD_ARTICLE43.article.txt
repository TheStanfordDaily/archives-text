# Week to raise consciousness of bike riding dangers
## 
### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
The ASSU Senate has declared this
week Bike Safety Week to raise gen
eral awareness of the real dangers in
volved with bicycling on campus.
Detective Carl Gielitz of the campus
police said 46 accident reports came
across his desk in 1979, 24 of which
occurred in the heart of campus away
from motor vehicle traffic. Injuries in
those accidents langed from minor cuts
and bruises to broken bones and inter
nal bleeding.
All week, the ASSU will sponso.r a

booth in White Plaza to sell safety
equipment such as lights and reflectors,
as well as handing out basic safety in
formation and bike repair instructions.
Campus police will also be par
ticipating in the program, stepping up
enforcement of bike laws. Officers will
be cracking down on night riders who
do not have lights or reflectors and also
riders ignoring well-known laws, such
as stop signs.
The Tresidder Recreation Center
will be the site of bike registration
Tuesday afternoon from 4 to 6 p.m.
' Basically," said ASSU Senator

Marc Ventresca, "we're trying to get
people to stop accepting bike accidents
as a fact of life, but to do something
about them."
Gielitz said common sense rules ig
nored by the bike rider are the most
frequent cause of accidents.
"Very often the bike rider either
triggers the accident or is directly re
sponsible, like riding off the sidewalk
into the traffic lane and being hit by a
car. riding too fast in pedestrian areas,
or riding at night without a light and
running into a jump post or chain."
With this in mind the senate hopes to

offer some simple tips that are
nevertheless important in making the
campus safer, said Ventresca.
Motorcycles and mopeds are
another point of concern. "There are a
lot of people who don't know it's illegal
to ride a motorcycle or moped under
power on campus," said Val Runge,
student affairs committee chairman.
The senate hopes that its efforts will
help reduce the number of all types of
accidents on campus.
According to Ventresca, a member
of the student affairs committee that
proposed the event, "People in their

rush forget to stop by the bookstore
and pick up a light or a reflector, so we
want to make it easier for them to get
that important equipment."
The Bookstore is supplying all the
equipment to the ASSU at cost, and
also donating the popcorn that will be
free for the taking to anyone who stops
by the booth.
Circle-K, a campus service organiza
tion affiliated with Kiwanis Interna
tional, is also helping to sponsor the
event along with support from the In
terfraternity and Intersorority Coun
cils and Tresidder Recreation Center.
