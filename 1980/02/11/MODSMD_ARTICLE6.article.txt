### Jill Liscom Staff Writer 
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) told constituents last night that
he will vote in favor of draft registra
tion for both men and women. How
ever, he said registration should he li
mited to 18-year-olds only.
Speaking to an overflow crowd in
Bishop Auditorium, McCloskey said
he opposes a draft, hut feels some type
of selective service is needed because
our voluntary army has proved in
adequate.
According to McCloskey, many of
those in the volunteer army can read
and write at only a ninth-grade level.
Only 18-year-olds need to be in
cluded in registration, he said, because
the problem is not increasing the size of
the army, but rather, "it's a question of
restoring the quality of the army."
McCloskey's alternative, proposed a
year ago on the basis "that we should
not return to a draft," is a national
youth service hill. This bill would re
quire all 1 8-year-old citizens to choose
between military or civilian service,
with benefits given according to the
type of service.
McCloskey also criticized those who
say that registration is not a step toward

conscription. "Make no mistake about
it — there is no need for registration
unless you plan on a draft," he said.
McCloskey said women should be
included in the draft registration be
cause there are many useful positions
that can fill in the military, but they
should not he considered for combat.
"There is no way that a well-armed,
well-trained, 115-pound woman can
match a well-armed, well-trained, 185
pound man," he said.
McCloskey opened his talk by saying
he was here to meet with constituents
and hear their views on current issues.
During the discussion several mem
bers of the audience contested his view
that an army is necessary.
"There hasn't been a period in his
tory yet when a nation without military
strength was not subject to domination
from a country with military strength."
he said.
We need an army to deter those who
would take advantage of militarily un
equipped nations, he added.
In response to other anti-draft re
gistration comments, McCloskey cal
led for a hand vote of those in favor ot
registration. The audience, about half
of which were students, voted at least
3-to-1 against registration.

One person argued that many
are against registration because they
tee I they are not lighting for a "real
cause," hut rather for purely economic
motives.
"Our perception of government's
motives has to he changed, so we be
lieve the government really is our gov
ernment," the citizen said.
McCloskey agreed, but said that
voter "apathy has contributed more to
that than the attitudes of the people in
government themselves." He said the
solution is to increase the percentage of
registered voters, which is currently
less than 50 percent for citizens
younger than 40 years old.
Another person asked McCloskey
what he would do about those who re
fused to register or serve if drafted. At
that point, about 20 students seated in
the audience who had bound their
hands at the wrist raised their arms in
silent protest.
• McCloskey said it would probably
"take a lot of the sting" out of the issue
to impose civil rather than criminal
penalties. For example, "maybe we
should just deny them the privilege of
using a national park or driving on a
federally funded highway," he said.
McCloskey also stressed the need for
a stricter energy conservation policy.
He said "the nature of the emergency is
so great" that we need decontrol of oil
prices in addition to either gas ration
ing or higher gasoline taxes.
"Our energy policy now is so neces
sary that we have to make some sac
rifices to have that policy," he said.
McCloskey also said he is in favor of
nuclear power, "even with the dangers
it entails," because the only alternative
is increased oil consumption.
