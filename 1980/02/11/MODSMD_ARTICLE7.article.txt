# Town Hall meeting to debate draft
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
An old-fashioned tow n hall meeting
on the implications of draft registration
is scheduled for 7 p.m. tomorrow in
Kresge Auditorium.
The meeting, which is patterned
after the traditional town hall meetings
in New England, has been the subject
of widespread interest from the Stan
ford faculty, according to Mike
Werner, director of the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau, one of the student organi
zations co-sponsoring the event.
Members of the faculty will present
opposing opinions on pre-selected to
pics. The floor will then be opened for
audience discussion.
"This provides an opportunity for
distinguished people to express their
views, and just as importantly, it allows
students to voice their ideas,"
explained Werner.
Designed not only to disseminate in
formation to the student body, the
meeting will also include a student
vote, the results of which may be taken
into consideration by members of the
ASSU Senate and the Council of Presi
dents when they formulate their official
stand on the registration reinstatement
issue.
ASSU Senator Renee Richards, one
of the students sponsoring the meeting,
said the significance to be assigned the
vote by the senate is still under debate.
Besides tallying student opinions,
the vote will also "directly confront the
Stanford students with the problem of
making the decision of whether or not
they would register," explained
Werner.
Richards agreed that this is the main
purpose of the vote.
Included in the program is a discus
sion of the role of the United States in
the international arena by History
Prof. Alexander Dallin and Coit
Blacker, political science research as
sociate. Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall and Peter Schwartz, senior
policy analyst for SRI International, a
research corporation based in Menlo
Park, will discuss the domestic justifi
cations of the draft.
Sally Mahoney, University registrar,
will speak in favor of equal treatment
of the sexes in draft registration, and
the closing summation will be pre
sented by Roger Pilon, a national fel
low at the Hoover Institute.
Freshman Glynn O'Donnell will
provide the introduction and senior

David Bohrer will act as moderator.
Werner described the meeting as ad
ditionally significant in that it repre
sents an unusual display of cooperation
between the Speakers Bureau, the
COP, the ASSU Senate and individual
students in producing such a project.
The idea, which was generated by
two Larkin residents, Bohrer and
O'Donnell, was brought to the Speak
ers Bureau and has since been pursued
by Werner, Tom Gart of the COP, se
nate chairman Mark Breier and four
senators, Richards, Dick Butterfield,
Eric Terzuolo and Marc Ventresca.
"Here's a time when we can provide
,as much information as possible for the
students," Gart said.
According to Bohrer, "It should be a
hot, controversial and interesting prog
ram."
