From the Daily wire services
HANOI â€” Nguyen Co Thach
was appointed Thursday Viet
nam's new foreign minister, re
placing Nguyen Duy Trinh, and
Gen. Van Tien Dung replaced
Gen. Vo Nguyen Giap as de
fense minister.
Nguyen Co Thach.s7. is con
sidered in Western diplomatic
circles here as the rising star in
Vietnamese politics, known for
his great diplomatic skill which
has led him to be nicknamed
"the two-headed fox," and for
his affability towards journalists
as well as his colleagues.
He is the main figure in the
second generation of Viet
namese leaders which, although
it took an active role in the resis
tance against the French and the
Japanese, was not at the head.
Thach. who joined the resis
tance at the age of 14, held local
political positions during the
colonial period and was also an
officer in the revolutionary
army. Some sources said he was
private secretary to Giap.
Diplomat
He entered the diplomatic
arena in 1954 as a departmental
head in the foreign ministry. He
was Vietnamese consul-general
in India in 1956 and became de
puty foreign minister in 1960.1n
1979. Thach attained ministerial
rank as secretary of state for
foreign affairs alongside the
prime minister. This new and
hybrid post made him. in effect
foreign minister by reason of the
illness of official title holder
Nguyen Duy Trinh. whom he
succeeded.
The new defense minister.
Gen. Van Tien Dung, 63. was
born into a peasant family near
Hanoi and had early experience
as a worker in a textile factory in
Hanoi. This background earned
him the characterization of
"peasant-worker" of the regime
after he entered the government

in 1972.
No change seen
The elevation of "second gen
eration" Communists to top pos
itions in Vietnam's leadership
does not mean that there is going
to be a change in Hanoi's
hardline foreign policy, analysts
in Bangkok said Friday.
Analysts said they expected no
weakening in Vietnam's ties with
the Soviet Union and no lessen
ing in its hostility to the West,
especially the United States. Nor
was there any indication that
Vietnam was about to relax its
grip on its two neighboring satel
lites. Cambodia and Laos.
"What I see is more of the
same." said one analyst.
"It's a temptation to look
upon the younger men as mod
erates because they are more
polished, more sophisticated and
may even speak good English,"
said another observer. "It's a
temptation that must be re
sisted."
Soviet ties
The newly elevated leaders,
most of them in their late 50s,
may possibly be more inflexible
than their elders because they
have a closer association with the
Soviets, diplomatic sources
suggested.
Some of the cabinet-level
changes were said to be part of a
move to rid the government of
officials judged to be incompe
tent or who have outlived their
usefulness and replace them with
younger men better able to deal
with Vietnam's postwar prob
lems.
While some of the founding
fathers of the party were retired
or dismissed because they were
either incompetent or too old to
carry on, none was publicly dis
graced.
Giap, 67, the legendary con
queror of Dien Bien Phu. who
masterminded Hanoi's 1975
conquest of South Vietnam, may

be in line for a bigger job.
Diplomatic sources said he
may succeed Prime Minister
Pham Van Dong when the Na
tional Assembly meets in April.
Dong, who was untouched by
the shakeup, is to Western eyes
perhaps the most distinguished
of the Vietnamese Communist
leaders. A soft-spoken man with
a will of iron. Dong at 72 is frail
and his eyesight is said to be fail
ing.
The most important changes
took place in the economic field.
Le Than Nghi. for years the
economic czar of Vietnam, was
replaced by Nguyen Lam, 57, a
colorless but capable bureaucrat
considered more in tune with the

times.
"Nghi was good at playing the
Chinese and the Russians against
each other to extract more aid
from both during the war years,"
an analyst said. "But he was
completely out of his depth when
it came to running a peacetime
economy."
Nghi was under harsh criticism
tor Vietnam's economic failures.
Another change was the re
placement of Dang Viet Chau as
foreign trade minister.
One change that surprised
analysts here was the dismissal of
I ran Quoc Hoan as interior minis
ter. He was replaced by Pham
Hung, the only southerner who is
a member of the party politburo.
