Afters years of academic work, a professor
moved off campus into the wooded hills As the
cold winter months approached, she decided
to use some of the wood on her land to burn tor
heat After she collected most ol the dry wood
and chopped down a lew small trees, she
realized she needed professional help She
put an add in the paper for a wood cutter, and
soon a little man. no more than 4' 2 feet tall,
appeared at her door She looked down at him
and laughed You re going to cut down some
of these huge trees 7 Without a word the little
man went over to a tree wider at the base than
he was tall He took out his little hatchet and
chop chop chop chop with machine-gun-like
repetition and lightening speed he removed a
big notch from the tree A few quick chops on
the other side, and the tree began to fall After it
landed with a huge crash, the professor stared
at the man aghast That s incredible, she
said, where are you from'' The man looked
down and replied modestly, I used to work in
the Sahara Forest The professor looked con
tused, You mean the Sahara Desert The
man looked up and replied. Now
