We serve the fast growing oil and gas industry. Our technical tools and
equipment are lowered into wells to evaluate the character and protected
productivity of a given well. We also have the most complete selection of
perforating guns to open a passageway for oil and gas to enter the well bore.
Your training begins with supervised field work. Then you attend our 12
week training course which will include classroom theory and actual prac
tice runs on test wells. Vou will then return to the field for your final phase
of training. At the end of your training, you will be promoted to Field
Engineer.
A logging unit, crew and company car will be assigned to you. A bonus
based on the income from the work you perform will be paid monthly in
addition to a generous salary. Make no mistake. This is not a "9 to 5"
position. Your work will require regional travel and exposure to the
elements.
However, you will derive the satisfaction of performing a vital service
which can have a real impact on our nation's eventual independence from
imported petroleum. For complete details on career paths with Dresser
