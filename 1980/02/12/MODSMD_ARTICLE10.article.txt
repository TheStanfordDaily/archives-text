# Cameroon enjoys uncommon stability
## 
### David Lamb The Los Angeles Times 
DOUALA, Cameroon — Events in this
West African country are about as newswor
thy as a sunny day in Florida or a fender
bender on a Los Angeles freeway. And
Cameroonians are proud of it.
Beyond their borders, governments —
some brutal, some merely ineffective — rise
and fall with alarming frequency, and
economics sputter fitfully.
Amid such turmoil, Cameroon has be
come something of an oddity. In 20 years of
independence it has never had a coup or a
major political upheaval. Its president has
been in power since the French flag was pul
led down to end the colonial era. Its press and
social institutions are relatively free. Its
economy continues to make steady progress,
growing at a rate of about 6 percent a year.
"I'm not saying we don't have problems,"
a Cameroonian banker said recently. "But
when you see what some other countries
have done with their independence. 1 think
we have a lot to be proud about and a lot to
feel good about."
The Cameroon success story is intriguing,
because this Texas-sized country of seven
million people contains all the elements that
have brought bloodshed, instability and ban
kruptcy to other African countries.
200 tribal groups
It has 200 tribal groups and 24 languages.
It has had a civil war. It has large Christian
and Moslem elements. Just before the inde
pendence, it had about 80 political parties
jockeying for power. And unlike any other
country in Africa, it is a union ot two former

colonies, one administered by the French,
the other by the British.
Most observers attribute Cameroon's na
tional cohesion and relatively trouble-free
existence to two key factors: the authorita
rian leadership of President Ahmadou
Ahidjo and the continued influence of Fr
ance.
While many other African presidents have
accentuated tribal divisions by favoring their
own people. Ahidjo, a Fulani Moslem from
the north, has sought to achieve an ethnic,
regional and religious balance in his govern
ment. He co-opts his critics and brings his
opponents into the center of government.
Effective police
Ahidjo maintains an effective police force
that he is not afraid to use against opponents,
although Cameroonians talk openly with
strangers about government and politics.
Western diplomats estimate that there are
300 political prisoners in Cameroon. Dissi
dents in exile, most of them members of the
Cameroon Action Movement, say there are
upwards of 30,000 political prisoners, a fi
gure that seems wildly exaggerated.
Ahidjo is one of the few African presidents
who has never wavered in his belief that the
farmer is the future of Africa. The Ahidjo
government provided $18 million in assis
tance last year to Cameroonian farmers, who
have made their country the world's fifth
largest producer of cocoa. Most cocoa is
grown on small family-owned plots, and
cocoa production continues to rise, along
with coffee production.
Cameroon became a modest oil producer
— about 15,000 barrels a day — in 1978

after several years of exploration and is now
completing a small refinery 45 miles north
west of Douala. Still, Ahidjo says, oil must be
secondary to agricultural development,
which supports about 80 percent of the work
force. Cameroon's 5-year development plan
concentrates on the development of roads to
the many parts of the countr> that are inac
cessible during the rainy season.
French influence
France still exercises considerable influ
ence in Cameroon, as it does in most of its
former colonies. It provides military assis
tance and takes 28 percent of Cameroon's
exports and provides 47 percent of Came
roon's imports. American and British
businessmen have found it difficult to penet
rate France's hold on the economy, even
though Cameroon offers an attractive mar
ket for foreign investors. Nearly 20,000
Europeans, most of them French, live in
Cameroon.
From 1884 until 1914, when it was divided
between France and Britain. Cameroon was
a German protectorate. In 1961 the northern
area of Cameroon was attached to Nigeria
after a British-sponsored plebiscite. And in
1962, at Ahidjo's suggestion, the federation
of the eastern, French-speaking Cameroon
and the western English-speaking Cameroon
was ended and the two areas joined to be
come what is now the United Republic of
Cameroon. It has one party, the National
Union Party.
Ahidjo has often said that a multiparty
system would lead to anarchy and ineffi
ciency and. ultimately, to the destruction of
the nation.

1962, at Ahidjo's suggestion, the federation
of the eastern, French-speaking Cameroon
and the western English-speaking Cameroon
was ended and the two areas joined to be
come what is now the United Republic of
Cameroon. It has one party, the National
Union Party.
Ahidjo has often said that a multiparty
system would lead to anarchy and ineffi
ciency and. ultimately, to the destruction of
the nation.
DOUALA, Cameroon — Events in this
West African country are about as newswor
thy as a sunny day in Florida or a fender
bender on a Los Angeles freeway. And
Cameroonians are proud of it.
Beyond their borders, governments —
some brutal, some merely ineffective — rise
and fall with alarming frequency, and
economics sputter fitfully.
Amid such turmoil, Cameroon has be
come something of an oddity. In 20 years of
independence it has never had a coup or a
major political upheaval. Its president has
been in power since the French flag was pul
led down to end the colonial era. Its press and
social institutions are relatively free. Its
economy continues to make steady progress,
growing at a rate of about 6 percent a year.
"I'm not saying we don't have problems,"
a Cameroonian banker said recently. "But
when you see what some other countries
have done with their independence. 1 think
we have a lot to be proud about and a lot to
feel good about."
The Cameroon success story is intriguing,
because this Texas-sized country of seven
million people contains all the elements that
have brought bloodshed, instability and ban
kruptcy to other African countries.
200 tribal groups
It has 200 tribal groups and 24 languages.
It has had a civil war. It has large Christian
and Moslem elements. Just before the inde
pendence, it had about 80 political parties
jockeying for power. And unlike any other
country in Africa, it is a union ot two former

colonies, one administered by the French,
the other by the British.
Most observers attribute Cameroon's na
tional cohesion and relatively trouble-free
existence to two key factors: the authorita
rian leadership of President Ahmadou
Ahidjo and the continued influence of Fr
ance.
While many other African presidents have
accentuated tribal divisions by favoring their
own people. Ahidjo, a Fulani Moslem from
the north, has sought to achieve an ethnic,
regional and religious balance in his govern
ment. He co-opts his critics and brings his
opponents into the center of government.
Effective police
Ahidjo maintains an effective police force
that he is not afraid to use against opponents,
although Cameroonians talk openly with
strangers about government and politics.
Western diplomats estimate that there are
300 political prisoners in Cameroon. Dissi
dents in exile, most of them members of the
Cameroon Action Movement, say there are
upwards of 30,000 political prisoners, a fi
gure that seems wildly exaggerated.
Ahidjo is one of the few African presidents
who has never wavered in his belief that the
farmer is the future of Africa. The Ahidjo
government provided $18 million in assis
tance last year to Cameroonian farmers, who
have made their country the world's fifth
largest producer of cocoa. Most cocoa is
grown on small family-owned plots, and
cocoa production continues to rise, along
with coffee production.
Cameroon became a modest oil producer
— about 15,000 barrels a day — in 1978

after several years of exploration and is now
completing a small refinery 45 miles north
west of Douala. Still, Ahidjo says, oil must be
secondary to agricultural development,
which supports about 80 percent of the work
force. Cameroon's 5-year development plan
concentrates on the development of roads to
the many parts of the countr> that are inac
cessible during the rainy season.
French influence
France still exercises considerable influ
ence in Cameroon, as it does in most of its
former colonies. It provides military assis
tance and takes 28 percent of Cameroon's
exports and provides 47 percent of Came
roon's imports. American and British
businessmen have found it difficult to penet
rate France's hold on the economy, even
though Cameroon offers an attractive mar
ket for foreign investors. Nearly 20,000
Europeans, most of them French, live in
Cameroon.
From 1884 until 1914, when it was divided
between France and Britain. Cameroon was
a German protectorate. In 1961 the northern
area of Cameroon was attached to Nigeria
after a British-sponsored plebiscite. And in
1962, at Ahidjo's suggestion, the federation
of the eastern, French-speaking Cameroon
and the western English-speaking Cameroon
was ended and the two areas joined to be
