# Trudeau campaign successful, frustrating
## 
### Stanley Meisler The Los Angeles Times 
WINNIPEG. Canada — It the
polls are right. Pierre Elliott
Trudeau is heading toward one
of the most remarkable electoral
victories in Canadian history.
Yet the spirit of his campaign is
hardly triumphant or even joy
ful. The atmosphere around him
is churlish, mean and depressed.
The 60-year-old Trudeau sits
moodily at the front of his cam
paign plane, quietly preparing
speeches that belittle Prime
Minister Joe Clark but never, as
in the old da\s. attempts to in
spire Canadians to feel anil ac
cept a special \ision of a united
Canada.
His aides look unhappy with
the unpleasant task of trying to
shield and quiet their hero, mak
ing him seem almost lackluster.
They have to persuade him to do
and say as little as possible. A
recent cartoon by Duncan Mac
pherson of the Toronto Star ,
showing two aides bundling
Trudeau up and tying a scarf ac
ross his mouth, is only barely an
exaggeration.
The Canadian journalists, who
take up most of the seats on the

campaign plane, feel manipu
lated and frustrated, angry at
their inability to break Trudeau's
shield, bitter at his obvious con
tempt for them. He is more cyni
cal than ever about politics.
Only a few months ago,
Trudeau's political career
seemed at an end, He had been
defeated last May after I 1 years
as prime minister, repudiated by
English Canadians who seemed
tired of him. his arrogance and
his combativeness.
Tears
In November, with a rare and
tearful show of emotion, he an
nounced his resignation as leader
of the Liberal Party; he would
step down as soon as the Liberals
elected a successor. Many Cana
dians. including Prime Minister
Clark, paid tribute to a distin
guished career now over.
But all that changed within a
few weeks. Clark and his aides
sloppily failed to count or court
votes in the House of Commons.
The Liberals joined the Socialist
New Democratic Party to defeat
Clark's minority government
and his Progressive Conservative
Party on Dec. 13 over an austere
budget that would have in
creased considerably the cost of
oil. The Liberals had little choice
but call on Trudeau to come
back, and Canadians suddenly
discovered that his career was
not over yet.
It has long been a cliche of
Canadian politics that voters
punish an opposition that does
not give a minority prime minis
ter a chance to govern. But that

does not seem to be happening.
The Liberals, in fact, are now
doing so well that they are fret
ting about overconfidence.
'Scary'
" The polls are so good," said
Sen. A 1 Graham, presidentof the
Liberal Party, aboard the cam
paign plane the other day, "that
it's scary."
According to the latest Gallup
Poll, the Liberal Party has 49
percent of the popular vote, the
Progressive Conservatives 2K
percent and the New Democratic
Party 20 percent. That 21-point
lead, if it holds up on election day
Feb. 18, would probably give
Trudeau and the Liberals a
majority of the seats in the
Commons.
Two television-sponsored
polls since then, taking account
of the positive reaction to the
Canadian government's hand in
smuggling six American dip
lomats out of Iran, cut the Lib
eral lead but not
enough to prevent a Liberal vic
tory, if the polls are correct.
The change in voter mood
since last May appears to come
less from any embrace of
Trudeau than from a profound
disappointment with the awk
ward and inexperienced Clark.
To many Canadians, he just
doesn't seem like a prime minis
ter. The Joe Clark jokes, a series
of demeaning stories that have
now become fashionable
throughout Canada, prove this.
Obvious strategy
This kind of situation calls for
an obvious, if not verv noble.

strategy. The Liberals want to do
all they can to avoid reminding
voters why they voted against
Trudeau in the last election. And
the Liberals want to avoid all po
tential traps for some kind of
verbal gaffe that might upset the
polls.
As a result. Trudeau, who
used to stand with his arms
folded across his chest and speak
extemporaneously, often in a
combative tome, now stands be
hind a lectern and reads from a
text that is usually tepid in every
thing but its riducule of Joe
Clark. He calls the Clark gov
ernment incompetent, inconsis
tent and a giant double-cross.
" Mr. Clark had a chance," he
ends almost every speech. "It's
time to give Canada a chance."
Ignoring Quebec
His texts ignore the subject of
Quebec and national unity, an
issue that he insisted last year
was almost treasonable to ig
nore. While he once seemed to
relish a scornful confrontation
with hecklers, he now ignores
many and replies to the others
with gentle wit.
Easily the most sophisticated
and experienced politician in
Canada, Trudeau has refused to
take part in any nationally tele
vised debate with the other party
leaders. He has held only one
press conference. He sometimes
agrees to meet journalists in a
"scrum" — a rugby term used to
describe an informal gathering of
journalists around a politician
for a few minutes.

WINNIPEG. Canada — It the
polls are right. Pierre Elliott
Trudeau is heading toward one
of the most remarkable electoral
victories in Canadian history.
Yet the spirit of his campaign is
hardly triumphant or even joy
ful. The atmosphere around him
is churlish, mean and depressed.
The 60-year-old Trudeau sits
moodily at the front of his cam
paign plane, quietly preparing
speeches that belittle Prime
Minister Joe Clark but never, as
in the old da\s. attempts to in
spire Canadians to feel anil ac
cept a special \ision of a united
Canada.
His aides look unhappy with
the unpleasant task of trying to
shield and quiet their hero, mak
ing him seem almost lackluster.
They have to persuade him to do
and say as little as possible. A
recent cartoon by Duncan Mac
pherson of the Toronto Star ,
showing two aides bundling
Trudeau up and tying a scarf ac
ross his mouth, is only barely an
exaggeration.
The Canadian journalists, who
take up most of the seats on the

campaign plane, feel manipu
lated and frustrated, angry at
their inability to break Trudeau's
shield, bitter at his obvious con
tempt for them. He is more cyni
cal than ever about politics.
Only a few months ago,
Trudeau's political career
seemed at an end, He had been
defeated last May after I 1 years
as prime minister, repudiated by
English Canadians who seemed
tired of him. his arrogance and
his combativeness.
Tears
In November, with a rare and
tearful show of emotion, he an
nounced his resignation as leader
of the Liberal Party; he would
step down as soon as the Liberals
elected a successor. Many Cana
dians. including Prime Minister
Clark, paid tribute to a distin
guished career now over.
But all that changed within a
few weeks. Clark and his aides
sloppily failed to count or court
votes in the House of Commons.
The Liberals joined the Socialist
New Democratic Party to defeat
Clark's minority government
and his Progressive Conservative
Party on Dec. 13 over an austere
budget that would have in
creased considerably the cost of
oil. The Liberals had little choice
but call on Trudeau to come
back, and Canadians suddenly
discovered that his career was
not over yet.
It has long been a cliche of
Canadian politics that voters
punish an opposition that does
not give a minority prime minis
ter a chance to govern. But that

does not seem to be happening.
The Liberals, in fact, are now
doing so well that they are fret
ting about overconfidence.
'Scary'
" The polls are so good," said
Sen. A 1 Graham, presidentof the
Liberal Party, aboard the cam
paign plane the other day, "that
it's scary."
According to the latest Gallup
Poll, the Liberal Party has 49
percent of the popular vote, the
Progressive Conservatives 2K
percent and the New Democratic
Party 20 percent. That 21-point
lead, if it holds up on election day
Feb. 18, would probably give
Trudeau and the Liberals a
majority of the seats in the
Commons.
Two television-sponsored
polls since then, taking account
of the positive reaction to the
Canadian government's hand in
smuggling six American dip
lomats out of Iran, cut the Lib
eral lead but not
enough to prevent a Liberal vic
tory, if the polls are correct.
The change in voter mood
since last May appears to come
less from any embrace of
Trudeau than from a profound
disappointment with the awk
ward and inexperienced Clark.
To many Canadians, he just
doesn't seem like a prime minis
ter. The Joe Clark jokes, a series
of demeaning stories that have
now become fashionable
throughout Canada, prove this.
Obvious strategy
This kind of situation calls for
an obvious, if not verv noble.

strategy. The Liberals want to do
all they can to avoid reminding
voters why they voted against
Trudeau in the last election. And
the Liberals want to avoid all po
tential traps for some kind of
verbal gaffe that might upset the
polls.
As a result. Trudeau, who
used to stand with his arms
folded across his chest and speak
extemporaneously, often in a
combative tome, now stands be
hind a lectern and reads from a
text that is usually tepid in every
thing but its riducule of Joe
Clark. He calls the Clark gov
ernment incompetent, inconsis
tent and a giant double-cross.
" Mr. Clark had a chance," he
ends almost every speech. "It's
time to give Canada a chance."
Ignoring Quebec
His texts ignore the subject of
Quebec and national unity, an
issue that he insisted last year
was almost treasonable to ig
nore. While he once seemed to
relish a scornful confrontation
with hecklers, he now ignores
many and replies to the others
with gentle wit.
Easily the most sophisticated
and experienced politician in
Canada, Trudeau has refused to
take part in any nationally tele
vised debate with the other party
leaders. He has held only one
press conference. He sometimes
agrees to meet journalists in a
