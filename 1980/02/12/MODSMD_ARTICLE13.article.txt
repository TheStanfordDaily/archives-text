HAMILTON AIR FORCE
BASE, Calif. (AP) — More than
five hundred Vietnamese re
tugecs arrived at Hamilton Air
Force Base on Sunday, their first
stop on the way to becoming set
tled in the United States.
More than 50.000 refugees
have been coming into the San
Francisco Bay area for proces
sing and an overnight stay at a
motel before they go to other
parts of the country. The lodging
site was shifted Sunday to three
barracks at this nearly aban
doned base in Marin County, ac
ross the bay from San Francisco.
The refugees arrived in mid
afternoon on a flight from In
donesia to Travis Air Force
Base, a little more than an hour
northeast of here. They were
then brought to the barracks in
11 buses.
Officials of the Inter

governmental Committee for
European Migration, which has
been handling the transportation
of the Indochinese refugees at
the request of the U.S. Depart
ment of State, estimated about
530 arrived Sunday.
They said there would be simi
lar flights from Indochina on al
ternating days for perhaps as
long as a year.
Cinderblock rooms
The refugees will be clothed
and fed at the base and housed
for a day or two in cinderblock
rooms containing five beds. They
will then be flown from San
Francisco International Airport
to cities around the country
where they will meet American
sponsors.
"It's like a freight operation,"
said William Anderson, director
of the local ICEM.
"It's like we bring them in in

truckload lots and move them
out in pickups."
Anderson said that about
14,000 refugees come to the Un
ited States every month from
Southeast Asia, but about half of
them arrive by commercial
flights and are able to fly to their
sponsors the same day, making a
stop at Hamilton unnecessary.
The refugees included families
and single people as well as chil
dren and old people.
"The people are very adapta
ble," said Greg Williams, one of
the ICEM workers who helped
the refugees move in.
"They are at the end of a long,
hard trip, and they're beginning
to relax a little when they get
here."
All of those arriving Sunday
were Vietnamese, but officials
said Cambodian and Laotian re
fugees will also pass through
here.
