Registration for the draft
"wouldn't he effective in the
slightest and is simply irrelev
ant" as a response to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, said
Political Science Prof. Hubert
Marshall in a lecture Th ursday at
Roble Hall.
"Defense spokesmen have
said that we would need nuclear
weapons to defend the Persian
Gulf," Marshall said. In a nuc
lear war, the draft doesn't matter
because the war would be over in
an hour."
The United States is over
reacting to the invasion, he said.
"There's not much evidence that
the Soviet Union wants to spread
Communism by the sword;
there's no reason to suppose
they'll invade Pakistan or Iran."
President Jimmy Carter has
called for registration "because
he's looking forward to an elec

tion and wants to appear to be an
active president. Also, registra
tion is a trial balloon from
Washington to test the nation's
reaction. If resistance is great,
the leaders will learn a lesson and
back off."
Marshall explained to the au
dience of 40 the motivations be
hind the invasion, stressing that
"when we look at another coun
try we have to make an effort to
see the world the way they do.
Stability
"The Soviets seek stability in
their empire and want to send a
signal to other Marxist govern
ments. They're also afraid of the
spread of Moslem militancy and
of encirclement by the rising
Chinese-American axis. By in
vading Afghanistan the Soviets
are making it not so easy to be
surrounded," the professor said.
The proper U.S. response to
the Soviets, Marshall said, is
neither registration nor raising

the defense budget. "We must
write off Afghanistan. The
Soviets are not going to leave.'"
Instead, "we need to develop a
very radically different foreign
policy.
"We need to offer positive in
ducements to get a country to
behave as we want them to," he
said. "We should be offering car
rots rather than sticks by reduc
ing expenditures for nuclear
weapons instead of building up
our armaments.
Little to lose?
" The Soviet Union wanted
arms reduction, but saw that
SALT II wasn't going to pass the
Senate, so the Soviets write it off
and figured that they would have
very little to lose by invading Af
ghanistan," Marshall said.
"Only 15 percent of U.S. oil
comes from the Persian Gulf."
Marshall said. "It wouldn't be
the end of the world if it were cut
off. We could get by through

conservation and re-organizing
our economy. What's funny is
that people who really need that
oil — the Germans and the
Japanese — haven't volunteered
a single soldier to defend the
Persian Gulf."
