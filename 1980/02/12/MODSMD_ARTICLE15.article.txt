# Wynter sees universal black experience

### Willie Cole Staff Writer 
A halo of sandy red curls
adorn her youthful face as high
lights of a smile put one at ease.
She begins, describing herself as
"part of that strange breed de
veloping in the Third World,
both writer and academician."
SylviaWynter is director of Af
rican and Afro-American
Studies here. A native of Cuba,
the 51-year-old Wynter has
danced in the theaters of Europe,
acted in films and on stage, writ
ten radio plays for the BBC in
London and written stage plays
starring such actors as Sammy
Davis, Jr., and William Marshall.
She published her first novel.
The Hills of Hebron, in 1962.
Wy nter now refers to herself as a
"summer writer" with two in
complete novels awaiting her at
tention.
Although she may have less
time to devote to her writing, its
theme remains the same. "I have
poured my energy into writing
about the black experience. Now
I'm grappling with the kinds of
theory that come from the black
experience." said Wynter.
She sees the black experience
as coming out of a black culture
which she says has "grappled
with and dealt with oppression
— has contested oppression."
Because of that past, black cul

ture -is an expression of oppres
sion applicable to all oppressed
people, said Wynter. But she
thinks blacks have not yet trans
formed that cultural experience
into an applicable universal
theory.
Wynter compares the yet-to
be-developed theory to Marx's
concept of the alienation of
labor. As Marx's theory attemp
ted to explain the common bond
between all alienated workers,
Wynter sees the necessity of a
theory of the black experience
serving the same purpose for all
oppressed people. The black ex
perience "puts it all together,"
she said, "from it there's a new
way of ordering reality."
Wynter said Black Liberation
Month, now being observed at
Stanford, is a way of recalling
those experiences. One purpose
of it is to allow blacks to "be
come conscious of what our cul
tural heritage is," she said.
Such consciousness ik> impor
tant, she said, because blacks'
separation from a knowledge or
sense of their history helped
others put them at the bottom of
society.
"Black Liberation Month and
the knowledge it allows gives us
the enormous feeling that here
we are battling, but we are part
of a wave that has extended it
self. It affects our sense of self —

giving us a heightened charge of
a sense of belonging," said
Wynter.
She also sees Black Liberation
Month as aiming to bring an un
derstanding of the experiences
and struggles of blacks, working
towards a universal theoretical
explanation of the experiences
and struggles.
"Our struggles are not to
exploit or enslave. It is all a
struggle for justice; therefore, it
becomes a universal struggle,"
she said.
Wynter said Black Liberation
Month is a chance forstudents to
mobilize and to carry on the
struggle from the past, which
must be continued "because a
struggle by any group of people
is a slow, painstaking attempt
towards affirmation of self upon
the world."
She emphasized that Black
Liberation Month is also in
volved in an American struggle.
She explained, "culturally, in the
history of this country it has been
Indian America, then British
America, then WASP America,
and then white America because
of the ethnic groups immigrating
in, so it has not yet become
'America.' Our struggle is to
transform white America into
'America'."
That is why Wynter is con
vinced it is important that blacks

and others take the opportunity
during Black Liberation Month
to heighten their consciousness
of what each has in common, she
said. By being aware of what
each has in common, "we can act
together and as we act together
we have a common group con
sciousness, because we have
been engaged in a common en
tity," she said.
By working and acting to
gether, said Wynter, the people
are able to hold themselves to
gether in a just society. Such a
society is important for blacks,
she said, because blacks have to
have a society where being black
and being an American don't
contradict each other.

concept of the alienation of
labor. As Marx's theory attemp
ted to explain the common bond
between all alienated workers,
Wynter sees the necessity of a
theory of the black experience
serving the same purpose for all
oppressed people. The black ex
perience "puts it all together,"
she said, "from it there's a new
way of ordering reality."
Wynter said Black Liberation
Month, now being observed at
Stanford, is a way of recalling
those experiences. One purpose
of it is to allow blacks to "be
come conscious of what our cul
tural heritage is," she said.
Such consciousness ik> impor
tant, she said, because blacks'
separation from a knowledge or
sense of their history helped
others put them at the bottom of
society.
"Black Liberation Month and
the knowledge it allows gives us
the enormous feeling that here
we are battling, but we are part
of a wave that has extended it
self. It affects our sense of self —

giving us a heightened charge of
a sense of belonging," said
Wynter.
She also sees Black Liberation
Month as aiming to bring an un
derstanding of the experiences
and struggles of blacks, working
towards a universal theoretical
explanation of the experiences
and struggles.
"Our struggles are not to
exploit or enslave. It is all a
struggle for justice; therefore, it
becomes a universal struggle,"
she said.
Wynter said Black Liberation
Month is a chance forstudents to
mobilize and to carry on the
struggle from the past, which
must be continued "because a
struggle by any group of people
is a slow, painstaking attempt
towards affirmation of self upon
the world."
She emphasized that Black
Liberation Month is also in
volved in an American struggle.
She explained, "culturally, in the
history of this country it has been
Indian America, then British
America, then WASP America,
and then white America because
of the ethnic groups immigrating
in, so it has not yet become
'America.' Our struggle is to
transform white America into
'America'."
That is why Wynter is con
vinced it is important that blacks

and others take the opportunity
during Black Liberation Month
to heighten their consciousness
of what each has in common, she
said. By being aware of what
each has in common, "we can act
together and as we act together
we have a common group con
sciousness, because we have
been engaged in a common en
tity," she said.
By working and acting to
gether, said Wynter, the people
are able to hold themselves to
gether in a just society. Such a
society is important for blacks,
she said, because blacks have to
have a society where being black
and being an American don't
contradict each other.

She begins, describing herself as
"part of that strange breed de

both writer and academician."
SylviaWynter is director of Af
rican and Afro-American
Studies here. A native of Cuba,
the 51-year-old Wynter has
danced in the theaters of Europe,
acted in films and on stage, writ
ten radio plays for the BBC in
London and written stage plays
starring such actors as Sammy
Davis, Jr., and William Marshall.
She published her first novel.
The Hills of Hebron, in 1962.
Wy nter now refers to herself as a
"summer writer" with two in
complete novels awaiting her at
tention.
Although she may have less
time to devote to her writing, its
theme remains the same. "I have
poured my energy into writing
about the black experience. Now
I'm grappling with the kinds of
theory that come from the black
experience." said Wynter.
She sees the black experience
as coming out of a black culture
which she says has "grappled
with and dealt with oppression
— has contested oppression."
Because of that past, black cul

ture -is an expression of oppres
sion applicable to all oppressed
people, said Wynter. But she
thinks blacks have not yet trans
formed that cultural experience
into an applicable universal
theory.
Wynter compares the yet-to
be-developed theory to Marx's
concept of the alienation of
labor. As Marx's theory attemp
ted to explain the common bond
between all alienated workers,
Wynter sees the necessity of a
theory of the black experience
serving the same purpose for all
oppressed people. The black ex
