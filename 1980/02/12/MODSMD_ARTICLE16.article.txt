# Funding uncertaintiy to hamper state teaching
## 
### Mark Morodomi Staff Writer 
Education in California during
the 19X0s will he in a state of
"turmoil and uncertainty," pre
dicted Michael Kirst, president
of the California State Board of
Education and Assoc. Prof, of
Education and Business Ad
ministration here.
The constitutionality of bus
ing, the changing trend of school
enrollment and the tax-slashing
proposition Jarvis II are the main
issues that will cause this "tur
moil and uncertainty" in the next
few years, he said in a recent in
terview with the Daily.
The possibility that busing will
he practiced statewide is a major
source of confusion among
members of the school board.
"Integration is sort of on
hold," he said.
In November, California vot
ers passed Proposition 1, an
amendment that stopped busing
in the state. But the constitution
ality of the proposition is now
being challenged in federal
courts.
Racially isolated
Kirst said that the State Board
of Education, under his leader
ship, has issued regulations re
quiring school districts to see
whether they have racially iso
lated schools and if so, to hold
hearings to discuss possible
means of integrations.
"We're just saying, 'Look, we
think it's coming — get ready," "
Kirst said.
Another current problem in
California education is the
changing trend of school enroll
ment. While the number of white
middle-class students declines
across the state, there has been a
dramatic increase in the His
panic population. Hispanic stu

dents, who made up 11 percent
of total school enrollment in
1967, comprised 23 percent of
the total in 1978, according to
Kirst.
"The people who have a high
participation in voting and are
politically active are basically
white middle-class people. They
are declining, in terms of num
bers who have a stake in public
education," said Kirst.
"Meanwhile the only citizenry
that is increasing in a politically
impotent and largely inactive
citizenry — Hispanics, who have
the worst voting record of any
minority in the country," he ad
ded.
Hispanics are 20 to 23 percent
of our enrollment population but
only 5 percent of our voting
population Kirst said.
Because of this growing de
cline in political activism, educa
tion issues that require local ac
tion, such as bond issues and bal
lot initiatives, are not drawing
the support of local com
munities.
Federal priorities
Meanwhile, at the federal
level, government priorities lie
with defense, energy issues and
problems of the elderly, Kirst
said.
"The only area left is the state
level," he said, and here, "Jarvis
II is the big one."
Jarvis 11, also known as Prop
osition 6, will be before the vot
ers on the June ballot along with
the presidential primaries. While
Proposition 13 cut property
taxes in half, Jarvis II proposes to
cut state income taxes in half.
Scramble!
"Fierce lobbying is the only
thing keeping us afloat." said
Kirst. "If Jarvis II passes we'll be
in a real scramble for limited

state dollars. And I don't know
what we're going to do othiir
than try a constitutional amend
ment of our own.
"Schools are SO percent fi
nanced by state government, 20
percent by local property taxe<>.
We calculate that this (Jarvis II)
will cause a cutback of approxf
mately 15 percent per pupil —
no small amount. We spend an
average of $1500 per student
now."
Along with issues such as
school funding and declining
political clout, Kirst sees that
(California) education will be
faced with the problem of con
tinued poor scores for 1 2th grad
ers on annual achievement tests
in basic skills.
"We are at or slightly above
the national average on basic
skills tests taken by the sixth
grade. We're somewhere bet
ween the 30th and the 35th per
centil nationally on the 12th
grade test. At the 12th grade
level we're not doing as well as
we should." He said a main
reason for this is that students
aren't taking the academic sub
jects that are tested nationally.
"They take leadership or they
take photography," he said.
" If our kids would elect to take
more academic classes, our 12th
grade scores would go up to the
national average.
"For example," he continued,
"our women take 20 to 30 per
cent fewer math courses than the
national average, yet we have
one of the most technological
states in the world.
"Why? We suspect that it's a
mixture of low graduation stan
dards and the failure of the uni
versities in this state to require
specific math courses for entr
ance," said Kirst.

education," said Kirst.
"Meanwhile the only citizenry
that is increasing in a politically
impotent and largely inactive
citizenry — Hispanics, who have
the worst voting record of any
minority in the country," he ad
ded.
Hispanics are 20 to 23 percent
of our enrollment population but
only 5 percent of our voting
population Kirst said.
Because of this growing de
cline in political activism, educa
tion issues that require local ac
tion, such as bond issues and bal
lot initiatives, are not drawing
the support of local com
munities.
Federal priorities
Meanwhile, at the federal
level, government priorities lie
with defense, energy issues and
problems of the elderly, Kirst
said.
"The only area left is the state
level," he said, and here, "Jarvis
II is the big one."
Jarvis 11, also known as Prop
osition 6, will be before the vot
ers on the June ballot along with
the presidential primaries. While
Proposition 13 cut property
taxes in half, Jarvis II proposes to
cut state income taxes in half.
Scramble!
"Fierce lobbying is the only
thing keeping us afloat." said
Kirst. "If Jarvis II passes we'll be
in a real scramble for limited

state dollars. And I don't know
what we're going to do othiir
than try a constitutional amend
ment of our own.
"Schools are SO percent fi
nanced by state government, 20
percent by local property taxe<>.
We calculate that this (Jarvis II)
will cause a cutback of approxf
mately 15 percent per pupil —
no small amount. We spend an
average of $1500 per student
now."
Along with issues such as
school funding and declining
political clout, Kirst sees that
(California) education will be
faced with the problem of con
tinued poor scores for 1 2th grad
ers on annual achievement tests
in basic skills.
"We are at or slightly above
the national average on basic
skills tests taken by the sixth
grade. We're somewhere bet
ween the 30th and the 35th per
centil nationally on the 12th
grade test. At the 12th grade
level we're not doing as well as
we should." He said a main
reason for this is that students
aren't taking the academic sub
jects that are tested nationally.
"They take leadership or they
take photography," he said.
" If our kids would elect to take
more academic classes, our 12th
grade scores would go up to the
national average.
"For example," he continued,
"our women take 20 to 30 per
cent fewer math courses than the
national average, yet we have
one of the most technological
states in the world.
"Why? We suspect that it's a
mixture of low graduation stan
dards and the failure of the uni
versities in this state to require
specific math courses for entr
ance," said Kirst.
Education in California during
the 19X0s will he in a state of
"turmoil and uncertainty," pre
dicted Michael Kirst, president
of the California State Board of
Education and Assoc. Prof, of
Education and Business Ad
ministration here.
The constitutionality of bus
ing, the changing trend of school
enrollment and the tax-slashing
proposition Jarvis II are the main
issues that will cause this "tur
moil and uncertainty" in the next
few years, he said in a recent in
terview with the Daily.
The possibility that busing will
he practiced statewide is a major
source of confusion among
members of the school board.
"Integration is sort of on
hold," he said.
In November, California vot
ers passed Proposition 1, an
amendment that stopped busing
in the state. But the constitution
ality of the proposition is now
being challenged in federal
courts.
Racially isolated
Kirst said that the State Board
of Education, under his leader
ship, has issued regulations re
quiring school districts to see
whether they have racially iso
lated schools and if so, to hold
hearings to discuss possible
means of integrations.
"We're just saying, 'Look, we
think it's coming — get ready," "
Kirst said.
Another current problem in
California education is the
changing trend of school enroll
ment. While the number of white
middle-class students declines
across the state, there has been a
dramatic increase in the His
panic population. Hispanic stu

dents, who made up 11 percent
of total school enrollment in
1967, comprised 23 percent of
the total in 1978, according to
Kirst.
"The people who have a high
participation in voting and are
politically active are basically
white middle-class people. They
are declining, in terms of num
bers who have a stake in public
education," said Kirst.
"Meanwhile the only citizenry
that is increasing in a politically
impotent and largely inactive
citizenry — Hispanics, who have
