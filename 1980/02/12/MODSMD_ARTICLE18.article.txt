## Peace, human rights connected 
### 
The banishment of Andrei
Sakharov, Nobel Peace Prize
winning "father" of the Soviet
nuclear bomb, followed so
quickly on the heels of Soviet ag
gression in Afghanistan that it
became obvious that interna
tional peace and human rights
are but two sides of the same
coin. Yet. until recently, this
connection was largely ignored
by our foreign policy makers and
the public at large.
Just last May the Consul Gen
eral of the USSR in San Fran
cisco, Aleksandr Zinchuk, came
to the Monterey Institute of In
ternational Studies to assure our
students and faculty of the "un
swervingly peaceful" objectives
of his government and to extoll
the virtues of SALT 11.
Although he berated the U.S.
government for "discriminat
ory" practices in trade, the audi
ence was as "diplomatic" as any
secretary of state, and the issue
of human rights was barely
raised, in spite of the fact that the
wave of persecution of Soviet
dissidents, including the impris
onment of Yuri Orlov and
Anatoly Shcharansky, had
hardly left the headlines.
When I later pressed Consul
Zinchuk on the issue, arguing
that the best way to achieve in
ternational detente is to com
plement it with a domestic de
tente between the Soviet gov
ernment and dissidents, he refer
red to Sakharov as an example of
official tolerance toward dissi
dents.
"Even though Sakharov per
sistently and unfairly attacks our
policy," Consul Zinchuk said,
"he still retains his awards and
honors, receives his salary as an
academician, lives in Moscow in
a government-subsidized apart
ment, uses a chauffeur-driven
car and meets foreign repor
ters."
Whatever reservations I had
about the truthfulness of Consul
Zinchuk's statement, as a former
Soviet propagandist myself I
knew he did a pretty good job in
pulling the wool over the eyes of
the SALT-deficient audience.
Since then Consul Zinchuk
was recalled to Moscow, while

both SALT II and Andrei
Sakharov fell victim to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan. We
should not forget, however, that
Sakharov is neither the first nor
the last victim of reprisals con
nected with the invasion.
Among prominent human
rights activists arrested since last
November are:
— Father Gleb Yakunin. a
Russian Orthodox priest and a
longtime opponent of the Christ
ian Church being manipulated
by the atheist government;
— Tatiana Velikanova, a
Moscow mathematician who,
like Sakharov, abandoned the
Soviet establishment to become
a champion of all persecuted
persons, be Jhey Jewish "re
fuseniks" denied exit visas or
Muslim Crimean Tatars denied
an entry to their homeland;
— Mykola Gorbal. a Kiev
musician and a champion of Uk
ranian dissidents;
— Antanas Terleckas, a
Lithuanian nationalist historian
and a Roman Catholic active in
underground samizdat publica
tions;
— Father Dmitry Dudko, a
Russian Orthodox priest and
spiritual mentor of a whole gen
eration of younger dissidents _
— Yuri Grimm and Victor
Sekirko, editors of the Russian
samizdat magazine Poiski
(Quest).
All these reprisals are part of a
plan to head off and silence the
human rights movement before
it may revitalize itself as a peace
movement focused on Soviet ag
gression in Afghanistan. In early
January Sakharov declared that
the invasion so disrupted the ba
lance of power, that "all of us
must concentrate our efforts on
preventing a chain reaction
which, in our nuclear age. may
lead to unforeseen consequences
for mankind." This was a rallying
cry to all people of good will to
stand up to Soviet military ambi
tions.
In his attack on Sakharov in
the government newspaper lz
vestia, Konstantin Batmanov
charged him with "blurting out"
to Western agents information

"which any state protects as a
secret." He alleged that "sec
rets" had something to do with
Sakharov's work as a nuclear
physicist. In'fact, the govern
ment is most afraid of the public
ity surrounding the events and
opinions:
— that the pro-Soviet (but in
sufficiently so) regime of
Hafisulla Amin had been over
thrown not by indigenous forces
but by Soviet troops before Bab
rak Karmal was brought to
Kabul;
— that Brezhnev and Kosygin
actually congratulated Amin on
being "elected" after he had
massacred his predecessor
Taraki (Batmanov should check
the Sept. 19 issue of Izves
tia);
— that a boycott of the Olym
pics would be a tremendous blow
to Soviet prestige (Sakharov cal
led for such a boycott even be
fore the invasion);
— that the grain embargo will,
indeed, hurt the Soviets, con
trary to Senator Edward Ken
nedy's (D-Mass.) suggestion that
the Russians would simply
switch from meat to chicken;
— that an effective embargo
on Western technology, coupled
with the refusal of Soviet scien
tists, like Sakharov himself, to
work for the Soviet war machine,
would drive the government up
the Kremlin wall.
These are the "secrets" which
the Kremlin wants to hide but
which reach the free world, by
and large, thanks to the activities
of the courageous men and
women who rally around Andrei
Sakharov.
Leav ing it to specialists to de
termine exact reasons as to the

timing of Soviet aggression, I am
convinced that the ultimate
reason lies in the very nature of a
Soviet regime whose motto has
always been, since Lenin, "Kto
kogo" (Who will lick whom?).
Knowing full well that the sole
source of their legitimacy is brute
force and that their own power
indeed comes from the barrel of
a gun, Soviet leaders are trying to
solidify their power at home by
military intervention abroad.
Soviet aggression in Afghanis
tan has already served as an eye
opener for many, including Pres
ident Jimmy Carter, who in the
State of the Union message de
clared that America's first goal
remains "a peace that preserves
freedom" and that "our support
for human rights in other coun
tries is in our national interest as
well as part of our own national
character." So, in the ominous
clouds over Afghanistan we
might perhaps discern a silver
lining: a deeper insight into the
question of human rights and a
greater awareness of the aggres
sive nature of the Soviet regime.
While realizing that in the past
Carter was not always steadfast
in his human rights policy toward
the Soviets, I believe he can now
act more decisively, provided,
this time, peace-loving people of
the free world stretch their help
ing hand to Sakharov, not
Brezhnev.

human rights movement before
it may revitalize itself as a peace
movement focused on Soviet ag
gression in Afghanistan. In early
January Sakharov declared that
the invasion so disrupted the ba
lance of power, that "all of us
must concentrate our efforts on
preventing a chain reaction
which, in our nuclear age. may
lead to unforeseen consequences
for mankind." This was a rallying
cry to all people of good will to
stand up to Soviet military ambi
tions.
In his attack on Sakharov in
the government newspaper lz
vestia, Konstantin Batmanov
charged him with "blurting out"
to Western agents information

"which any state protects as a
secret." He alleged that "sec
rets" had something to do with
Sakharov's work as a nuclear
physicist. In'fact, the govern
ment is most afraid of the public
ity surrounding the events and
opinions:
— that the pro-Soviet (but in
sufficiently so) regime of
Hafisulla Amin had been over
thrown not by indigenous forces
but by Soviet troops before Bab
rak Karmal was brought to
Kabul;
— that Brezhnev and Kosygin
actually congratulated Amin on
being "elected" after he had
massacred his predecessor
Taraki (Batmanov should check
the Sept. 19 issue of Izves
tia);
— that a boycott of the Olym
pics would be a tremendous blow
to Soviet prestige (Sakharov cal
led for such a boycott even be
fore the invasion);
— that the grain embargo will,
indeed, hurt the Soviets, con
trary to Senator Edward Ken
nedy's (D-Mass.) suggestion that
the Russians would simply
switch from meat to chicken;
— that an effective embargo
on Western technology, coupled
with the refusal of Soviet scien
tists, like Sakharov himself, to
work for the Soviet war machine,
would drive the government up
the Kremlin wall.
These are the "secrets" which
the Kremlin wants to hide but
which reach the free world, by
and large, thanks to the activities
of the courageous men and
women who rally around Andrei
Sakharov.
Leav ing it to specialists to de
termine exact reasons as to the

timing of Soviet aggression, I am
convinced that the ultimate
reason lies in the very nature of a
Soviet regime whose motto has
always been, since Lenin, "Kto
kogo" (Who will lick whom?).
Knowing full well that the sole
source of their legitimacy is brute
force and that their own power
indeed comes from the barrel of
a gun, Soviet leaders are trying to
solidify their power at home by
military intervention abroad.
Soviet aggression in Afghanis
tan has already served as an eye
opener for many, including Pres
ident Jimmy Carter, who in the
State of the Union message de
clared that America's first goal
remains "a peace that preserves
freedom" and that "our support
for human rights in other coun
tries is in our national interest as
well as part of our own national
character." So, in the ominous
clouds over Afghanistan we
might perhaps discern a silver
lining: a deeper insight into the
question of human rights and a
greater awareness of the aggres
sive nature of the Soviet regime.
While realizing that in the past
Carter was not always steadfast
in his human rights policy toward
the Soviets, I believe he can now
act more decisively, provided,
this time, peace-loving people of
the free world stretch their help
ing hand to Sakharov, not
Brezhnev.

The banishment of Andrei
Sakharov, Nobel Peace Prize
winning "father" of the Soviet
nuclear bomb, followed so
quickly on the heels of Soviet ag
gression in Afghanistan that it
became obvious that interna
tional peace and human rights
are but two sides of the same
coin. Yet. until recently, this
connection was largely ignored
by our foreign policy makers and
the public at large.
Just last May the Consul Gen
eral of the USSR in San Fran
cisco, Aleksandr Zinchuk, came
to the Monterey Institute of In
ternational Studies to assure our
students and faculty of the "un
swervingly peaceful" objectives
of his government and to extoll
the virtues of SALT 11.
Although he berated the U.S.
government for "discriminat
ory" practices in trade, the audi
ence was as "diplomatic" as any
secretary of state, and the issue
of human rights was barely
raised, in spite of the fact that the
wave of persecution of Soviet
dissidents, including the impris
onment of Yuri Orlov and
Anatoly Shcharansky, had
hardly left the headlines.
When I later pressed Consul
Zinchuk on the issue, arguing
that the best way to achieve in
ternational detente is to com
plement it with a domestic de
tente between the Soviet gov
ernment and dissidents, he refer
red to Sakharov as an example of
official tolerance toward dissi
dents.
"Even though Sakharov per
sistently and unfairly attacks our
policy," Consul Zinchuk said,
"he still retains his awards and
honors, receives his salary as an
academician, lives in Moscow in
a government-subsidized apart
ment, uses a chauffeur-driven
car and meets foreign repor
ters."
Whatever reservations I had
about the truthfulness of Consul
Zinchuk's statement, as a former
Soviet propagandist myself I
knew he did a pretty good job in
pulling the wool over the eyes of
the SALT-deficient audience.
Since then Consul Zinchuk
was recalled to Moscow, while

both SALT II and Andrei
Sakharov fell victim to the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan. We
should not forget, however, that
Sakharov is neither the first nor
the last victim of reprisals con
nected with the invasion.
Among prominent human
rights activists arrested since last
November are:
— Father Gleb Yakunin. a
Russian Orthodox priest and a
longtime opponent of the Christ
ian Church being manipulated
by the atheist government;
— Tatiana Velikanova, a
Moscow mathematician who,
like Sakharov, abandoned the
Soviet establishment to become
a champion of all persecuted
persons, be Jhey Jewish "re
fuseniks" denied exit visas or
Muslim Crimean Tatars denied
an entry to their homeland;
— Mykola Gorbal. a Kiev
musician and a champion of Uk
ranian dissidents;
— Antanas Terleckas, a
Lithuanian nationalist historian
and a Roman Catholic active in
underground samizdat publica
tions;
— Father Dmitry Dudko, a
Russian Orthodox priest and
spiritual mentor of a whole gen
eration of younger dissidents _

Sekirko, editors of the Russian
samizdat magazine Poiski
