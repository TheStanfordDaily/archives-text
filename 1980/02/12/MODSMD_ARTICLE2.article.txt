# Presidential search committee may be formed
## Trustees consider housing issues 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Consideration ot a new "coinvest
ment program" for faculty housing and
the authorization of an SOO-bed stu
dent housing project highlight the
agenda for today's University Board of
Trustees meeting to be held on campus
in Stauffer Auditorium.
In addition, the 31-member board
will most likely form a search commit
tee to find a successor for President
Richard Lyman, according to Robert
Hamrdla, assistant to the president for
trustee affairs.
Lyman announced on Jan. 26 that he
would resign at the end of this year to
assume the chairmanship of the pre
stigious Rockefeller Foundation.
The coinvestment mortgage prog
ram, considered by the board's Com
mittee on Investments yesterday, is a
"major effort to make housing finan
cially manageable for faculty," said
Vice President for Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzwcig, at a briefing last
week.
In the past few years it has become
increasingly difficult for the University
to recruit and retain faculty members
because of the high cosi of housing in
the Stanford area, he said.
The board will be asked to authorize
the use of up to $2 million for invest
ments in faculty and senior staff hous
ing units. This program, which will
eventually be available to all 1100 fa
culty and about 450 staff members will
provide assistance in the form of a sec
ond mortgage for houses or con
dominiums on or off campus.
This funding will be drawn from
"funds functioning as endowment," a
pool capital which consists largely ol

"unrestricted gifts to the University,
Rosen/weig explained.
It approved, a trial version of this
program will end next winter and a re
commendation of continuance will be
made to the board early in 1981, ac
cording to the proposal.
In other business, the hoard is ex
pected to approve plans to proceed
with the design for a student housing
project to cost between $32 and $36
million. The SOO-bed facility will be
located on Santa Teresa Street west of
Lagunita Court.
The complex will take the form of
independent houses to house approxi
mately 180 students modeled after the
row houses; a complex of connected
houses accommodating a total of ap
proximately 320 students, modeled
after Lagunita Court; and a complex of
suites, a type of housing new to the
campus, accommodating a total of 300
students.
"With these additional units, N4 per
cent of the undergraduate population
and 42 percent of all graduates can be
housed," a background report to the
trustees states.
The addition of the new beds will
allow spaces now assigned to under
graduates in Manzanita Park to be
reassigned to single graduate stu
dents, it continues.
The board will also discuss the possi
bility of establishing a subcommittee
under the Committee on Investments
to concentrate on the evaluation of
prospective real estate investments.
This would signify a "move from
property management to real estate in
vestment" on the part of the board,
according to Rosen/weig.
The board will also consider the pos
sibility of establishing an advisory

committee of real estate professionals
"with a strong Stanford interest" and
receive reports regarding various Uni
versity investments and the current
status of the Stanford Shopping
Center, which the University owns.
Other routine reports will include a
summary of research grants and con
tracts received by the University during
the months of November and De
cember amounting to $22,233,708.
The board is also expected to review
and approve the appointment of eight
professors to endowed chairs and the
establishment of three new professor
ships along with the approval of
numerous faculty and staff appoint
ments.
