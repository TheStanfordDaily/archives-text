## David Forsythe Draft needed for prevention 
### 
In the aftermath of back-to-back anti-draft ral
lies led by David Harris and Daniel Ellsberg, it is
hard to imagine anything but unanimity among
Stanford students against conscription. These in
spirational speakers attract attention by appealing
to the crowd's sense of individual rights, freedom
and desire for peace.
Some of us, however, prefer to stand back and
look at the facts, as unfortunate as they may be, and
not succumb to this emotional rhetoric. The fact is
that the present volunteer army in the United
States is in a shockingly bad state of readiness to
defend this nation and our allies.
The fact is that the Soviet aggression in Central
Asia represents a real threat to this nation's in
terests throughout the world, which, if continued,
will force our government to act, and we will need a
military force capable of acting successfully.
Now those who oppose the draft do so for a
couple of reasons. On the one hand, they claim that
the situation in the Middle East, like the war in
Vietnam, is not a "just war" for America to fight.
They say that all we would be fighting for is cheaper
oil, and that victory would only result in bigger
profits for the oil companies. I asume that those
who use this argument against the draft would not
mind forced service in a "just war," whatever that
is.
The more vehement anti-draft advocates oppose
the practice on basic principle: no American
should be forced to serve in any capacity, no matter
what. These people claim that conscription violates
basic constitutional rights of individual freedom,
and that if the nation truly needs defending, the
people will volunteer to fight, as they did in the
Revolution.
When the president announced the possibility of
using military force in Asia, he did not intend to

defend the oil companies. There is a much more
important reason for containing the Soviet threat:
our stature on a large scale, of which Afghanistan is
just a small part.
If the Soviets are convinced that we will never
use force to protect our interests, they will feel free
to extend their hegemony with military action, as
they have now begun to do. So, while no war can be
considered "just," the principles at stake in the
Mideast are much more profound that Exxon's
quarterly profits.
The idea that Americans will volunteer to serve
if we really belong in war is idealistic and impracti
cal. First, there is the inevitable "it's a good cause,
but someone else can die for it" selfish attitude.
Moreover, if there were a sudden threat which a
majority of Americans would fight against, such as
an attack on Israel or Western Europe, by the time
all of the gung-ho patriots got around to register
ing, it would be too late, because of the relatively
weaker state of our standing army.
The fact is that we need a draft to prevent such a
war, not that it would encourage one.
As a champion of the rights of the individual
over those of the state, and especially as an advo
cate for youth, it is against everything in my nature
to support government-forced service of any kind.
But I'm scared. And when 1 feel that the existence
of America as the power we recognize is
threatened, I am willing to compromise my indi
vidual interests for the sake of the nation.
Sometimes, the leaders we elect have to force us
to look after our best interests collectively because,
if we do not each sacrifice a little of our precious
freedom now, we may lose that freedom which we
have taken for granted for so long.
