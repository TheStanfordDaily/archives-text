## Join up against 'other side' 
### 
When 1 stepped back on cam
pus last September everything
looked right. Students were lin
ing up to register, lining up to
buy books and lining up to get
food. The claw was spurting wa
ter, the hills were beautiful.
Hoover Tower was penetrating
the sky, and fraternities were
throwing parties.
But as the year wore on, Stan
ford began to look less and less
like Stanford and more like
Foothill College. Sure, the
weather was slowly getting
worse, as usual. And sure, I spent
my weekday nights at UGLY.
Yet, there was something mis
sing.
At first 1 attributed it to easily
identifiable differences: our
president was looking for a place
to flee to; there were no Daily
articles damning the Senate; our
football team was losing to teams
like Tulane, Army and Oregon
State; and the secretaries' offices
in Terman were altered. Yet, as
important as these things are,
still they didn't seem to
adequately explain what was

wrong.
Then one day it all changed.
President Jimmy Carter an
nounced that he would ask Con
gress to reinstate draft registra
tion and instantaneously Stan
ford was once again Stanford. 1
first noticed it the next day when
1 ran into my radical best friend
from high school (with whom I
disagree politically) who was or
ganizing a rally to protest Car
ter's speech. The next sign came
when my reactionary roommate
(with whom 1 disagree politi
cally) organized a group to sup
port Carter's speech. The curtain
was up; the show was on.
It was then I realized what had
been missing. We Stanford stu
dents had not been campaigning
to save the world from the evil of
the "other side." A few protests
here, a rally there, hut our heart
was not in it. Now, however, the
world is in turmoil and we must
save it from nuclear holocaust;
or maybe we must save it from
Soviet domination.
ltdoesn't matter. All that mat
ters is that we must save it. For-

tunately for us, we have organi
zations to turn to. On the left side
of the stage is a coalition of Stan
ford Against the Draft (SAD)
and Stanford Against Conscrip
tion (SAC). Can we resist calling
the coalition SAD-SAC? On the
right is Stanford Against Soviet
Aggression (SASA).
I will venture to comment on
the show even though it has
barely begun. I enjoyed the
dramatic reading of death in the
upcoming nuclear holocaust (it is
fun to try to figure out if you will
die from the blast, the heat, or
what). But the verbal abuse, a la
Dennis Erectus, that I am by na
ture violent and aggressive is,
while somewhat amusing, not my
favorite form of entertainment.
1 am disappointed though at
the lack of show of the SASA
group. I can't help but think that
it lacks the power of a comic ac
ronym like SAD-SAC. So I am
recommending that they com
bine with a group called Free Re
fusnik Andrei Sakharov. The
new group SASA-FRAS can at
tack a wider range of Soviet
policies and at the same time be
much more entertaining.
In conclusion, I am appealing
to those on the left to join
SAD-SAC and those on the right
to join SASA-FRAS so that
Stanford will once again become
an amusing place for those of us
while somewhat amusing, not my
favorite form of entertainment.
$8000, so sit back and enjoy it.

what). But the verbal abuse, a la
Dennis Erectus, that I am by na
ture violent and aggressive is,
while somewhat amusing, not my
favorite form of entertainment.
1 am disappointed though at
the lack of show of the SASA
group. I can't help but think that
it lacks the power of a comic ac
ronym like SAD-SAC. So I am
recommending that they com
bine with a group called Free Re
fusnik Andrei Sakharov. The
new group SASA-FRAS can at
tack a wider range of Soviet
policies and at the same time be
much more entertaining.
In conclusion, I am appealing
to those on the left to join
SAD-SAC and those on the right
to join SASA-FRAS so that
Stanford will once again become
an amusing place for those of us
while somewhat amusing, not my
favorite form of entertainment.
$8000, so sit back and enjoy it.
