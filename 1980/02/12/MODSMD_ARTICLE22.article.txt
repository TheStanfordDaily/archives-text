## Investigate, celebrate womanhood 
### 
Next week is Women's Week, a time to
investigate and celebrate womanhood in all
its various aspects, a week to break the cold
of winter by building a network of issues and
the warm community common to women.
Why a Women's Week, many ask, or, for
that matter, a Women's Center, a Women's
Orientation to Stanford, a Women's Studies
Program? Like the movement to free Third
World peoples from racism (and therefore
Black Liberation Month), women are en
gaged in a real struggle to end sexism in all its
institutional and interpersonal forms.
That may seem obvious to most; less obvi
ous is women's need to bond ourselves as a
class of people and identify with each other
as we try to modify our own and society's
perceptions of who we are and what we can
do.
There is a strong force in sisterhood, in

realizing our own strengths within the struc
tures we create ourselves, not those depen
dent on male approval or guidance. Thus,
women's centers and programs create places
for all women to explore their own personal
and historical experiences among under
standing and challenging peers.
Men, whether they know it or not, are
necessarily involved in this process of chang
ing the attitudes and behaviors conditioned
by traditional sex roles. Men can learn from
feminist history ways to create new con
sciousness among themselves about how
they want to break the traps of machismo and
male supremacy, both in their own lives and
as a social group, that oppress us all.
*
These concepts and their manifestations
are difficult, but important, to deal with. For
this reason, the coming Women's Week pro-

vides an array of programs and activities to
awaken the sleepy curiosity of the Stanford
community about these issues: rape and
battery of women (films and discussion);
women's health concerns (a self-help work
shop and visit from Josette Mandanaro,
M.D.); the situations of black and Asian
women (a reading of poetry by Alice Walker
and Unbound Feet); lesbianism; lectures on
women's history and the ERA. And there is a
women's coffeehouse to relax by as well!
Look for these events and participate in
them as much as possible, as a way to grow
and challenge old ideas. It is only by learning,
discussing and acting that we create the
world free of sexism and racism that we
dream of.
