Stance shows retreat
I join in the former editors'
shock and sadness at the Daily's
editorial position on the draft.
The newspaper s stance, unless
corrected, truly will represent an
ethical retreat of the worst order.
I must depart, however, from
those portions of the reply
statement that minimize the
long-run threat to world peace
and freedom posed by an aggres
sive, imperialist Soviet Union. In
view of recent acts of patent
ruthlessness — indeed, of de
cades of them — I cannot be so
sublime about the intentions and
capabilities of the Soviets.
The challenge to those who be
lieve in individual liberty is to
formulate a response to Soviet
expansionism that eschews the
sort of militarism running ram
pant through our country and,
apparently, through the Storke
Publications Building. A prim
ary component of such a strategy

must be the unleashing of
domestic energy production.
The answer of freedom-loving
peoples must not include vast
new grants of power to one cen
tralized state in the hope of re
pelling the abuses of another.

Wall blocks view
As a group of electrical en
gineers who work and study in
the area, we feel that some com
ments concerning the new Stan
ford wall "sculpture" being built
opposite the Varian Physics Tank
are appropriate.
There is no doubt that the wall
is intended by its benefactors to
beautify the area. However, one
of the best views on campus is
obtained looking through the
Quad from the viewpoint of the
Physics Tank, and the wall cuts
this view off behind it.

It looks ludicrously misplaced
in its surroundings and is the ob
ject of much ridicule at the mo
ment. Can it not be removed
without offense, to some other
more suitable location? Let's
keep the terrific view and not
"wall it in."

Rosalynn: no draft
The headline "Rosalynn
favors draft, no combat for wo
men" (Daily, Feb. 8) misrepre
sents the first lady's position.
The accompanying article clearly
states, "... she is opposed to a
draft at this time. ..." A similar
statement was emphasized by
Mrs. Carter at a breakfast held
for her husband in San Francisco
on Friday morning.
What the first lady does favor

is the registration of women
along with men, a position which
shows an understanding of the
equal responsibilities of men and
women in a hypothetical case of
national emergency. I hope the
White House, unlike the Daily, is
able to continue to separate re
gistration from the draft.
