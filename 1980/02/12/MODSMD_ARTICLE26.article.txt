# Carter leads in trust, respect

### George Skelton The Los Angeles Times 
LOS ANGELES â€”Three big
reasons why President Jimmy
Carter now is favored to win his
party's first primary in New
Hampshire on Feb. 26 are that
voters there "respect" and
"trust" him more than they do
his two major rivals and believe
he is the one "who responds best
under pressure."
And one big reason why he is
running nearly two to one ahead
of Sen. Edward Kennedy of
Massachusetts, in the senator's
own political backyard, is Chap
paquiddick. Continuing skepti
cism about Kennedy's handling
of the tragedy appears to account
for almost half of Carter's lead,
the Los Angeles Times Poll
found.
Beyond that. Carter is on the

"right" side politically of several
key issues, such as his calls for
increased defense spending and
boycotting of the Summer
Olympics in MoScow.
In the Republican primary,
two important things Ronald
Reagan has going for himself are
that voters believe he is the can
didate who could best straighten
out the economy and also is the
one with the most experience,
but they are leery of his age.
The things working best {or
George Bush are that Republi
cans consider him the candidate
most adept at handling foreign
affairs, the one with "more new
ideas" and"the most intelli
gent."
When independents were
added in the poll to the Republi
can vote, Bush switched posi
tions with Reagan and led by

four percentage points. This is
significant because independents
can vote in a New Hampshire
primary by changing their regist
rations to a specific party at the
polling place on election day.
Clearly, the best things going
for Carter in New Hampshire are
that voters respect and trust him.
