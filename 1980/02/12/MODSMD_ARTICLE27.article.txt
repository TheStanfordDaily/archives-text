# Cards top Huskies, 79-78
## 
### Richard Martinez Sports Editor 
There's an old adage that
says the longer one waits and the
harder one works for something
the sweeter the joy when it ar
rives. II that is true, last night's
Stanford basketball victory over
the University of Washington,
79-78 in overtime, may be as
sweet to the Cardinals as would
be a national championship to
DePaul.
The victory was the first for
the Cardinals in over five weeks
of action. Snapping an eight
game losing streak that ironically
began with a loss to the Huskies,
Stanford raised its league record
to 2-11, tying UC-Berkeley for
the cellar spot, and 4-17 overall.
Stanford's first half of play last
night contained some of the
finest individual and all-around
performances of the season. The
defense was especially aggres
sive and stingy as Washington
was held to 24 points in the first
20 minutes. The Huskies con
nected on only 34 percent of
their shots.
The play of both teams during
the opening moments was calcu
lated and cautious. It was not
unusual for the teams to wait half
a minute before taking a shot.
With 1 1:25 remaining in the
first half, a Terry Smith follow
up basket put the Cards ahead
15-13. It was a lead they would
not relinquish except for the
opening minutes of the overtime
period.
In the next five minutes, Stan
ford extended the lead to 27-1 7.
The front-court tandem of Or
lando Ward and Kimberly Bel
ton successfully penetrated
Washington's zone defense and
the entire Card offense played
deliberate, yet confident ball.
Even when Washington re
ceived some breaks they had
trouble converting them. Belton
blocked a lay-up attempt after a
Husky steal and center James
Woods travelled on a breakaway
to the basket.
Washington, down by 14 at

one point, rallied to a 32-24 de
ficit with 1:54 to go in the first
half. Stanford toughened, how
ever, and the Cards went to the
locker rooms with a 36-24 lead
after Belton hit the last shot of
the half with two seconds re
maining.
Stanford fans were obviously
pleased with their team's fine
first half performance hut they
had to he wondering if they
would see a Card victory or
another heartbreaking loss.
It appeared that the latter
would occur when an inspired
Huskie squad forced a befuddled
Stanford team into turnover
after turnover. After the first six
minutes of action the score read
Stanford 44, Washington 40 and
looked as if another possible vic
tory would be fumbled away.
The Cards, who, as
Washington coach Marv Har
shman said, have "made a great
improvement since the first time
we played them," refused to
buckle under the pressure.
Stanford regrouped with a
Smith lay-in, a Brian Welch slam
dunk and jump shot, a Tom
Schmalzried follow-up and two
Belton free throws, extending its
lead to 56-46 with 10:13 to play.
Stanford even possessed an
11-point lead, 64-53, with 5:47
to play. But rules are made to be
broken, money is meant to be
spent, and Stanford leads are
meant to be squandered. Three
minutes later, Stanford 67,
Washington 60.
Even with 23 seconds left to
play, Stanford led by four,
74-70. Stan Walker hit an 11-
foot jumper with eight seconds
to go and after Belton threw
away the inbounds pass and also
dropped the next rebound out of
bounds, Walker tied the score
with a 22-foot jumper from the
left baseline.
The script seemed written for
yet another Stanford tough loss
as the teams came out for the
overtime period. Dan Caldwell
made a tip-in and the Huskies
led 76-74. With two minutes re
maining, Doug Marty made a
three-point play with a driving
lay-up and the Cards led for
good 77-76. Stanford secured
the win with 15 seconds to go on
two Welch free throws. Lorenzo
Romar made a meaningless buc
ket at the buzzer.
Belton finished with 26 points
and 10 rebounds. Ward and
Welch grabbed seven re
bounds, while adding 14 and 12
points respectively . Smith tallied
1 1 and Marty surprisingly grab
bed as many rebounds (8) as he
did score points.

Walker had 16 for the Huskies
while Caldwell added 14 points
and 1 2 rebounds.
An obviously pleased Card
couch Dick Dißiaso reaffirmed
his confidence in the team by
stating, " I thought we had a good
chance to win this game. In fact,
I've felt that way about our team
since the second half of the Ore
gon game (Jan. 2f>). We've been
mentally aggressive since thon."
The Cards travel to Berkeley
this Saturday for a confrontation
with cellarmate California.

There's an old adage that

Stanford basketball victory over
the University of Washington,
79-78 in overtime, may be as

The victory was the first for

Stanford raised its league record
to 2-11, tying UC-Berkeley for

With 1 1:25 remaining in the
first half, a Terry Smith follow

not relinquish except for the

deliberate, yet confident ball.
Even when Washington re
ceived some breaks they had

blocked a lay-up attempt after a
Husky steal and center James
Woods travelled on a breakaway
to the basket.
Washington, down by 14 at

one point, rallied to a 32-24 de
ficit with 1:54 to go in the first
half. Stanford toughened, how
ever, and the Cards went to the
locker rooms with a 36-24 lead
after Belton hit the last shot of
the half with two seconds re
maining.
Stanford fans were obviously

to play. But rules are made to be
broken, money is meant to be
spent, and Stanford leads are
meant to be squandered. Three
minutes later, Stanford 67,
Washington 60.
Even with 23 seconds left to
play, Stanford led by four,
74-70. Stan Walker hit an 11-
foot jumper with eight seconds
to go and after Belton threw
away the inbounds pass and also
dropped the next rebound out of
bounds, Walker tied the score
with a 22-foot jumper from the
left baseline.
The script seemed written for
yet another Stanford tough loss
as the teams came out for the
overtime period. Dan Caldwell
made a tip-in and the Huskies
led 76-74. With two minutes re
maining, Doug Marty made a
three-point play with a driving
lay-up and the Cards led for
good 77-76. Stanford secured
the win with 15 seconds to go on
two Welch free throws. Lorenzo
Romar made a meaningless buc
ket at the buzzer.
Belton finished with 26 points
and 10 rebounds. Ward and
Welch grabbed seven re
bounds, while adding 14 and 12
points respectively . Smith tallied
1 1 and Marty surprisingly grab
bed as many rebounds (8) as he
did score points.

Walker had 16 for the Huskies
while Caldwell added 14 points
and 1 2 rebounds.
An obviously pleased Card
couch Dick Dißiaso reaffirmed
his confidence in the team by
stating, " I thought we had a good
chance to win this game. In fact,
I've felt that way about our team
since the second half of the Ore
gon game (Jan. 2f>). We've been
mentally aggressive since thon."
The Cards travel to Berkeley
this Saturday for a confrontation
with cellarmate California.

There's an old adage that
says the longer one waits and the
harder one works for something
the sweeter the joy when it ar
rives. II that is true, last night's
Stanford basketball victory over
the University of Washington,
79-78 in overtime, may be as
sweet to the Cardinals as would
be a national championship to
DePaul.
The victory was the first for
the Cardinals in over five weeks
of action. Snapping an eight
game losing streak that ironically
began with a loss to the Huskies,
Stanford raised its league record
to 2-11, tying UC-Berkeley for
the cellar spot, and 4-17 overall.
Stanford's first half of play last
night contained some of the
finest individual and all-around
performances of the season. The
defense was especially aggres
sive and stingy as Washington
was held to 24 points in the first
20 minutes. The Huskies con
nected on only 34 percent of
their shots.
The play of both teams during
the opening moments was calcu
lated and cautious. It was not
unusual for the teams to wait half
a minute before taking a shot.
With 1 1:25 remaining in the
first half, a Terry Smith follow
up basket put the Cards ahead
15-13. It was a lead they would
not relinquish except for the
opening minutes of the overtime
period.
In the next five minutes, Stan
ford extended the lead to 27-1 7.
The front-court tandem of Or
lando Ward and Kimberly Bel
ton successfully penetrated
Washington's zone defense and
the entire Card offense played
deliberate, yet confident ball.
Even when Washington re
ceived some breaks they had
trouble converting them. Belton
blocked a lay-up attempt after a
Husky steal and center James
Woods travelled on a breakaway
to the basket.
Washington, down by 14 at

one point, rallied to a 32-24 de
ficit with 1:54 to go in the first
half. Stanford toughened, how
ever, and the Cards went to the
locker rooms with a 36-24 lead
after Belton hit the last shot of
the half with two seconds re
maining.
Stanford fans were obviously
pleased with their team's fine
first half performance hut they
had to he wondering if they
would see a Card victory or
another heartbreaking loss.
It appeared that the latter
would occur when an inspired
Huskie squad forced a befuddled
Stanford team into turnover
after turnover. After the first six
minutes of action the score read
Stanford 44, Washington 40 and
looked as if another possible vic
tory would be fumbled away.
The Cards, who, as
Washington coach Marv Har
shman said, have "made a great
improvement since the first time
we played them," refused to
buckle under the pressure.
Stanford regrouped with a
Smith lay-in, a Brian Welch slam
dunk and jump shot, a Tom
Schmalzried follow-up and two
Belton free throws, extending its
lead to 56-46 with 10:13 to play.
Stanford even possessed an
11-point lead, 64-53, with 5:47
to play. But rules are made to be
