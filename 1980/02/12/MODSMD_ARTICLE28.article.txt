# Pauling plugs book on Vitamin C as cancer cure
## 
### Jiri Weiss Staff writer 
Dr. Linus Pauling, the two
time Nobel laureate, expounded
his belief that large doses of Vit
amin C help cure cancer to an
overflow crowd at Kepler's
Bookstore in Menlo Park. Paul
ing was there to promote his
latest book. Vitamin C and
Cancer, co-authored with his col
laborator Ewan Cameron.
At first Pauling looked every
bit of his 79 years. His voice was
shaking as were his hands but as
he continued it became clear that
this appearance was deceptive.
Underneath there is a very tough
and lucid core which enables him
to keep a schedule that would
tire a man half his age and allows
him to pull facts and figures out
of his memory as he speaks.
Pauling believes that a large
dose of vitamin C taken regularly
not only can protect people and
cure the common cold, a subject
of an earlier book, but also can
cure cancer at its earliest stages.
At later stages it prolongs life
and lessens suffering. Pauling be
lieves that vitamin C potentiates
the immune system so that the
body can fight cancer more effec
tively.
Pauling's work has been sur
rounded with controversy. He
first tried to publish his findings
on the therapeutic effects of vit
amin C on cancer in the Proceed
ings of (he National Academy of

Science in 1973. Even though
Pauling had a right as a member
to publish it in the journal ac
cording to a long-standing rule ot
the Academy, he was refused.
The NAS felt that false hopes
would be raised in cancer pa
tients and that vitamin C could
have side effects. Pauling denies
both of these claims.
Controversy is nothing new to
Pauling. He has always taken a
stand. He was denied a passport
in 1952 for alleged subversive
activities and in the early '70s
supported Bruce Franklin, the
Marxist professor here who was
dismissed for allegedly inciting
violence on campus. It was in
1957 that he met Roy Kepler,
the owner of Kepler's
Bookstore, at a demonstration
against nuclear testing at Liver
more. It was because of Pauling's
interest in nutrition that he
found his position at Stanford
tenuous and together with Ar
thur Robinson and a few other
associates decided to set up his
own research institute.
Pauling became interested in
the relation of vitamins, vitamin
C in particular, to cancer after
reading a book by his current col
laborator and co-author Came
ron called Hyaluronidase and
Cancer. It was known that there
was a "spreading factor" pro
duced by malignant tumors that
contained the enzyme
hyaluronidase. This enzyme
weakens the intercellular cement

in tissues so as to permit infiltra
tion of other substances. Since
the body also produces an in
hibitor to this enzyme, Came
ron's idea was to stimulate the
body to produce it.
Pauling knew that vitamin (
leads to a synthesis of strands
(fibrils) of collagen, an impor
tant constituent in the connec
tive tissue. Giving large doses of
vitamin C would strengthen the
tissue, he believed.
Cameron began (on Pauling's
advice) distributing 10 grams
daily of vitamin C to patients at
Vale of Leven hospital in Scot
land where he was chief surgeon.
About half a dozen patients re
sponded well to the treatment.
For several years patients in that
hospital were given vitamin C
treatment after they were consi
dered untreatable, and so vita
min C treatments have been
treated this way at Vale hospital.
The study based on Cameron's
results has been criticized be
cause it was not double blind. In
double blind studies, neither the
patient nor doctor administering
treatment know whether they
are giving or receiv ing vitamin C
rather than a harmless placebo.
If the results of Cameron's
study were due to a placebo ef
fect. that is, through extraneous
factors that have nothing to do
with vitamin C, then the effect
"must have been a wonderful
placebo effect to last eight
years," said Pauling. A few pa
tients who were in the original
group treated by Cameron are
still alive, eight years after they
were declared terminally ill.

However, in a recent study,
performed at the Mayo Clinic,
vitamin C was found to have no
effect in improving or lengthen
ing the lives of cancer patients.
Puling igut" that vitamin C
treatment is compatible with
other cancer treatments but not
chemotherapy, which many of
the patients in the study were gi
ven. Chemotherapy, according
to Pauling, knocks out the pa
tient's immune system to a de
gree where vitamin C is no
longer effective in restoring it.
Pauling said he believes that
90 percent of cancer patients
could stand to benefit from the
treatment which is inexpensive
and has no side effects.
Why are so many scientists
skeptical of his findings? When
asked this question Pauling did
not hesitate to reply, "There is a
bias based upon the belief that
such a common substance could
not possibly be of benefit."
Another reason is, according to
Pauling, that cancer is a large in
dustry. Each patient's treatment
averages $43,000 a year, a total
of $30 billion for the industry.
"Chemotherapy is given because
it exists," he said, and is not
worth the side effects it causes.
Pauling practices what he
preaches. He takes 10 grams of
vitamin C daily, in three doses.
"This is equivalent to about 110
glasses of orange juice," he
laughed. Pauling advises others
to start taking about six grams
and increase the dose if there is
"no looseness of bowels." Most
Americans ingest just about the
minimum necessary to prevent

getting scurvy. This is much less
than our ancestors probably got,
said Pauling.
According to a recent article in
the San Jose Mercury there has
been some evidence that the
doses advocated by Pauling may
actually increase the probability
of getting skin cancer, if one is to
believe a study by Robinson;
who was fired a year ago from his
job at the Pauling Institute.
Robinson gave differing dose*
of vitamin C to groups of mice
with induced skin cancer. The
mice were given a wide variety of
diets. Those with raw vegetable
diets supplemented with the vit
amin did best, but mice on an
ordinary diet laced with vitamin
C had a significantly higher
number of lesions.
While Robinson's experi
ments were not conclusive, he
said he believes that the role of
vitamin C should be investigated
more closely. Pauling does not
attribute much credibility to
Robinson's work and has been
trying to get federal funding for
studies on guinea pigs which he
believes are more suitable. So far
he has not had any luck.
A couple of people in the au
dience, including a woman
whose sister has terminal cancer,
said that they knew someone
who had been helped through
vitamin C treatment.
Has Pauling gained more ac
ceptance for his treatment? "We
will have to wait and see what
kind of reception the book will
get." he said. Pauling added that
so far, a high percentage of the
phone calls he has been receiving
about it are from doctors, a sign
he considers encouraging.
