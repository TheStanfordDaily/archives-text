Student performing groups here are or
ganizing a theater guild to deal with prob
lems they have in common, according to
Howard Gleicher, executive producer of
Ram's Head.
"We thought it might be easier if we tack
led our problems together," Gleicher said.
"We might get something done by coali
tion."
"The idea has been thrown around since
last year," said Marilu Magana, president of
The Company. The guild will be similar to
the Publications Board, she said.
According to Magana. the Theater Guild's
goals are to create a strong lobby, to increase
communication between student drama
groups and to address the needs of residen
tial theater productions.
"It takes so many resources to put on a
show. Individual organizations have some,
but not enough and they're not readily avail
able," Gleicher said. "Through the guild we
want to build up enough resources to provide
all the groups with what they need."
Establishing a campus-wide costume and
stage set bank is one of the guild's proposed
ideas.

The guild includes Ram's Head, the Stan
ford Savoyards, the Company and the Un
dergraduate Lights Project. Membership is
still open.
"We're planning to have ex-officio mem
bers 112 rom various groups, such as the Council
of Presidents, the Office of Student Ac
tivities and the Drama Department."
Magana said, although the groups have not
yet been chosen.
The* impetus for the creation of the guild
was an increase in the fees for using Univer
sity facilities, according to Magana and
Gleicher.
"The policy of charging to use facilities
comes from the Office of Public Events and
the Drama Department, according to Jason
Mavis, director of facilities and services.
"It's required that auditoriums be under
supervision, for safety and security reasons.
When equipment is used, adequate technical
supervision is needed, and it's necessary to
know that the building is properly closed and
locked."
One way of meeting this requirement is
hiring a technician from Public Services at
$32 per hour. "But that $32 is what it costs to
operate the shop." said Jerry Hummel of
Public Services. "It includes equipment ren

tal, preparation and maintenance."
As Marvis explained, even it a technician
isn't needed, the building must still be sec
ured. "Then the groups can make arrange
ments with the Department of Public Safety,
but that's not always possible," Mavis said.
"It takes good planning to avoid the charge
and we (Public Services) can help with that."
"It costs us between $2500 and $3000 a
year for supervision," Gleicher said. He
named scheduling buildings and rehearsal
and storage space as other problems.
"Through the guild we want to deal with the
increasing costs and paper shuffling."
Another concern is funding. "We'd like to
get on the spring fee assessment ballot,"
Magana said. " Drama is so active, it deserves
help. We receive no donations and there's no
money coming in, hut there are tons of
people involved directly and indirectly."
Support for the guild has been positive so
far. "The students are so energetic and they
have so many ideas," said Patricia Brandt of
the Office of Student Activities. "Everybody
thinks this is a really good idea, and one
whose time has come. The groups have been
struggling along with these issues one by one
for too long."
