## Play Beethoven with singing hearts and smiling faces 
### 
"They despise change. They
loathe us. These (old-fashioned)
classical music lovers are of
fended because we don't play
with sour faces .... We don't fit
the molds of Art."
On paper, Gary Karr and
Harmon Lewis seem typical of
performers on the chamber
music circuit. Karr is considered
to be the world's best doublebass
player. Descended from si\ gen
erations of Russian bassists, he
graduated from and taught at
Juilliard before beginning celeb
rated stints as a soloist and an
experimental musician.
Lewis grew up with a piano in
his parlor. He was a Mississippi
farm-town boy who mastered
the keyboard and ended up.
eight years ago. studying for his
music doctorate at Indiana Uni
versity.
That's w here he met Karr. and
that's where their picture of con
vention ends.
"Music has personality and we

want to show it," Karr explained
before last Friday's Lively Arts
concert here. "Beethoven
sonatas, for instance, are sup
posed to he funny: not always
making you laugh, but making
you smile."
"They run the range of emo
tions." Lewis added, and both
men believe limiting themselves
to "the tight-lipped end" short
changes audience, performers
and composer.
"We'll make you have a good
time. We'll have fun."
Karr and Lewis don't exactly
do somersaults between pieces.
But they proudly and boldly
break many of the conventions
of classical musicianship.
"I'm a half-mime, anyway."
Karr explained." 1 can't help but
get involved by making faces,
moving my body around. 1 want
so much for people to 'feel' the
music ... What hurts me most
is when intelligent critics write
that' Mr. Karr played the Beeth

oven so beautifully, it was a
shame that he had to inject
humor into his performance'."
"Some things just can't be ex
pressed in words, or are better
said in music," Lewis said.
"You're less inhibited when
you're playing." At least you are
when these two have their way.
Paganini's "Moses Theme,"
played Friday. is a great example
of fun music, karr said. "It's a
takeoff on a theme by Rossini
. . . . It's camp all the way. lots of
laughs. Paganini wanted you to
laugh. He went onstage with his
violin and a big pair of scissors.
He cut all of his strings except
one and played on that string.
Then, he did hysterical varia
tions — behind his back, on his
ear — people laughed, then.
They wouldn't now"
Hysterical Paganini?
A musical sense of humor,
both agreed, is really a sensitivity
to the emotion behind you and
within the notes, and a will ins

ness to jump, with your clothes
on, into the "happy conscious
ness" created among perfor
mers, listeners and the (smiling)
ghost of the composer.
But many people abandon
their senses at concert time.
"They want it played one way.
They don't like us changing
things."
Karr said people have even
asked him to add two more musi
cians as fill-ins to make a quartet.
Four is the traditional number in
chamber music, and "people
think they're getting more for
their money that way."
But an unconventional two is
just fine for Karr and Lewis.
"We've developed a special
compatibility." a musical friend
ship, rather than the soloist
accompanist relationship which
deadens some performances,
Lewis said.
"We understand each other in
a way you can only if you've
played together as long as we

have. What makes it special is
this sense of knowing exactly
what the other is thinking."
Lewis also praised Karr's abil
ity to "create an immediate rap
port" with his keyboard partner
and his audience, especially chil
dren.
"Gary can enter the world of
children so easily because he
loves them so much."
"They are the best and easiest
to play for," Karr admitted.
"They have no preconceived
ideas and they are ready to jump
in anv time." Karr should know.

He's taught at more than 62
elementary schools and gives
mini-concert lectures such as a
session last week with Palo Alto
children.
In the late 1960s,"Gary made
a prediction in Time magazine
that in 10 years he would be
hated by orchestra bass players
everywhere," Lewis said
proudly. "Well, it's come true."
Karr's open-ended, imagina
tive style attracted so many
young musicians that "the older
bass players, who didn't used to
have so much competition," now

are fighting for their orchestra
chairs, Lewis explained.
"It's a sociological change,"
Karr insisted. "It's great . . . or
chestra bass players used to have
it so bad and easy. It was almost
as bad as the plague. Bass players
only got a handful of notes to
play — all boring."
I hat fast-flying free music
which has sprung from jazz bass
players — and experimental
classical soloists like Karr — is
going to be the way to go.
"You just wait."

"They want it played one way.
They don't like us changing
things."
Karr said people have even
asked him to add two more musi
cians as fill-ins to make a quartet.
Four is the traditional number in
chamber music, and "people
think they're getting more for
their money that way."
But an unconventional two is
just fine for Karr and Lewis.
"We've developed a special
compatibility." a musical friend
ship, rather than the soloist
accompanist relationship which
deadens some performances,
Lewis said.
"We understand each other in
a way you can only if you've
played together as long as we

have. What makes it special is
this sense of knowing exactly
what the other is thinking."
Lewis also praised Karr's abil
ity to "create an immediate rap
port" with his keyboard partner
and his audience, especially chil
dren.
"Gary can enter the world of
children so easily because he
loves them so much."
"They are the best and easiest
to play for," Karr admitted.
"They have no preconceived
ideas and they are ready to jump
in anv time." Karr should know.

He's taught at more than 62
elementary schools and gives
mini-concert lectures such as a
session last week with Palo Alto
children.
In the late 1960s,"Gary made
a prediction in Time magazine
that in 10 years he would be
hated by orchestra bass players
everywhere," Lewis said
proudly. "Well, it's come true."
Karr's open-ended, imagina
tive style attracted so many
young musicians that "the older
bass players, who didn't used to
have so much competition," now

are fighting for their orchestra
chairs, Lewis explained.
"It's a sociological change,"
Karr insisted. "It's great . . . or
chestra bass players used to have
it so bad and easy. It was almost
as bad as the plague. Bass players
only got a handful of notes to
play — all boring."
I hat fast-flying free music
which has sprung from jazz bass
players — and experimental
classical soloists like Karr — is

The Silver Tassie
Fon Landa, Erin Dignam and Darrell Duffie triumphantly display their soccer trophy
in the Stanford Drama Department's production of The Silver Tassie by Irish playw
right Sean O'Casey, which opens tomorrow night in the Little Theater. Performances
continue February 14-16 and 20-23.
"They despise change. They
loathe us. These (old-fashioned)
classical music lovers are of
fended because we don't play
with sour faces .... We don't fit
the molds of Art."
On paper, Gary Karr and
Harmon Lewis seem typical of
performers on the chamber
music circuit. Karr is considered
to be the world's best doublebass
player. Descended from si\ gen
erations of Russian bassists, he
graduated from and taught at
Juilliard before beginning celeb
rated stints as a soloist and an
experimental musician.
Lewis grew up with a piano in
his parlor. He was a Mississippi
farm-town boy who mastered
the keyboard and ended up.
eight years ago. studying for his
music doctorate at Indiana Uni
versity.
That's w here he met Karr. and
that's where their picture of con
vention ends.
"Music has personality and we

want to show it," Karr explained
before last Friday's Lively Arts
concert here. "Beethoven
sonatas, for instance, are sup
posed to he funny: not always
making you laugh, but making
you smile."
"They run the range of emo
tions." Lewis added, and both
men believe limiting themselves
to "the tight-lipped end" short
changes audience, performers
and composer.
"We'll make you have a good
time. We'll have fun."
Karr and Lewis don't exactly
do somersaults between pieces.
But they proudly and boldly
break many of the conventions
of classical musicianship.
"I'm a half-mime, anyway."
Karr explained." 1 can't help but
get involved by making faces,
moving my body around. 1 want
so much for people to 'feel' the
music ... What hurts me most
is when intelligent critics write
that' Mr. Karr played the Beeth

oven so beautifully, it was a
shame that he had to inject
humor into his performance'."
"Some things just can't be ex
pressed in words, or are better
said in music," Lewis said.
"You're less inhibited when
you're playing." At least you are
when these two have their way.
Paganini's "Moses Theme,"
played Friday. is a great example
of fun music, karr said. "It's a
takeoff on a theme by Rossini
. . . . It's camp all the way. lots of
laughs. Paganini wanted you to
laugh. He went onstage with his
violin and a big pair of scissors.
He cut all of his strings except
one and played on that string.
Then, he did hysterical varia
tions — behind his back, on his
ear — people laughed, then.
They wouldn't now"
Hysterical Paganini?
A musical sense of humor,
both agreed, is really a sensitivity
to the emotion behind you and
within the notes, and a will ins

ness to jump, with your clothes
on, into the "happy conscious
ness" created among perfor
mers, listeners and the (smiling)
ghost of the composer.
But many people abandon
their senses at concert time.
"They want it played one way.
They don't like us changing
things."
