# Opera Theatre's return a hit
## 
### 
Combine a spine-tingling journey
into the mind of a charlatan and an up
roarious parody of human greed. The re
sult? Last week's appealing presentation
by Stanford's Opera Theatre of Menotti's
The Medium and Puccini's Gianni Schic
chi.
The Medium's spirited cast trans
formed Dinkelspie! Auditorium Wed
nesday night into an eerie seance parlorof
swinging lamps and blue shadows.
Madame Flora, the Medium, powerfully
played by mezzo-soprano Janis Wilcox, is
touched on the neck during a routine
seance. This necromantic theme domi
nates the opera and leads to the tragic
murder of Toby, the pathetic mute,
played by Eric Hoit.
If you'll pardon the gastronomic anal
ogy. the most memorable moment in an
opera is like a dish of neapolitan ice
cream. The three ingredients of music,
acting and libretto are blended and
spoon-fed to the audience. The treat
came in the second act, when the daugh
ter. Monica, comforts her kneeling and
disheveled mother with the "Black Swan"
aria. The poetic lyricism of this aria is a
welcome release from the opera's frantic,
tense dialogue.
The second scoop again involves
Monica, wonderfully played by the
talented actress and soprano Nancy Wait.

in her scene with the hand-puppeted
Toby. Monica sings for the orphan and
concludes, "you have the most beautiful
\ oice in the world." The pair's optimism is
in direct contrast to the paranoia of
Madame Flora.
Remarkable for its staging is the scene
involving the three customers and
Madame Flora. Daniel Helfot has di
rected his actors back and forth across the
stage in robot-like pursuit of further con
tact with their deceased children.
Andor Toth's Chamber Orchestra suc
cessfully emphasized the protagonist's
mental anguish and her daughter's sweet
ness. and set the tragic atmosphere. Cre
dit must also be given to the stage crew for
coordinating the lighting with the pitches
of the orchestral score.
Like The Medium. Puccini's Gianni
Schicchi is a through composed, or con
tinuous work. This one-act comedy based
in thirteenth-century Italy has its literary
root in two lines from Dante's Inferno. In
the opera, it is the audience which is asked
to pass judgment on Schicchi.
Who can resist Bill Ramsey's lovable
scalawag. Gianni Schicchi? The baritone
is begged by his dowry-hungry daughter
and her future in-laws to imitate a de
ceased relative and falsify a will.
At his "deathbed." Schicchi dictates

the terms of the will to the notary, impres
sively sung by Thomas Moore. Of course,
Schicchi bequeaths the best possessions to
himself, and his daughter Lauretta,
Suzanna Loube, is able to marry her
heart-throb Rinuccio. the talented tenor
Gregory Wait.
With only two arias. Gianni Schicchi is
really an opera of comedic acting. The
nine vulturous relatives barely wait for
"Buoso's" last breath before swooping
down to ransack his nest in search of the
will. The most winning vulture is Zita.
played by Roberta Wait-Becker, who
climbs on top of the deceased's bed and
pushes the good doctor Spinellecio (De
rek Evans) out the door in anticipation of
the notary.
By the conclusion, this viewer was
humming two of Puccini's recurrent
melodies: the "Goodbye Florence"
theme, sung repeatedly by Schicchi to re
mind the relatives that fraud is punishable
by exile, and the lovers' motif, which
Lauretta and Rinuccio sing each time they
see each other.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra de
cked the hall in non-stop sound and the
back-drop of the Duomo and red roofs of
Florence together with the robed cos
tumes took us into the world of the
Medici.
