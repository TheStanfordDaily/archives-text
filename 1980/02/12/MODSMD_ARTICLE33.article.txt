# Golden West tarnished
## 
### 
While returning to my seat for
the second act of the American
Conservatory Theatre's produc
tion of The Girl of the Golden
West, 1 passed a knot of literati
who had paused before the door
to the orchestra. One, appa
rently their leader, addressed the
group.
"What do you think?" he
asked, gazing down the aisle at
the plywood-and-styrofoam sa
loon on stage. "Should we go
back for more of this?"
As I edged around the talking
blue blazers in the aisle (" I like a
play that makes sense.") and
climbed over the talking white
coats at the end of my row
("There's this wonderful new
gallery on Post Street. It's in a
loft."), I realized that I had just
heard expressed, in a nutshell,
the theater critic's dilemma. I
was trapped; having accepted my
complimentary tickets, I had no
choice but to sit through two
hours "more of this." Unless, of
"course, I chose to receive no
more free tickets.
I'm not saying that 1 would
have walked out after Act I had I
been a paying customer. It takes
a great deal of moral fiber to
leave early with an $11 ticket
stub in your pocket. But, when
faced with such unalloyed trash
ias The Girl of the Golden West, it
would be a comfort to have the
choice.
In an ACT season composed
largely of money-making
schlock. The Girl of the Golden
West will probably stand out as
the biggest artistic disaster of all.
David Belasco may have been
"one of the most influential men
in the history of the American
theater," as the program notes
claim, but he was obviously a
better director and producer
than writer. Cardboard charac
ters, ludicrous dialogue and poor
construction are half the prob
lem; if anyone pays attention to
the play past the first act, they'll
discover racial stereotypes, blat
ant melodrama and a moral
sense so hazy as to be non
existent.
The moral aspect is the most
annoying of all. Normally, it
could be safely ignored; but the
company, knowing it has a tur
key on its hands, has advertised
the play as a moral epic. Director
Edward Hastings claims that the
play is concerned with "the ques
tion of right and wrong." Should
Minnie (the Girl) shelter
Johnson (a notorious high
wayman)? Should Jack Ranee

(the card-sharping sheriff) run
them in? Should Minnie leave
the boys in the mining camp and
start a new life with Johnson?
The play, however, seems in
tent on asking different ques
tions. Questions like, will Minnie
fall for the blonde hunk? She
does, at first glance, from across
the dance floor. Will she go to
bed with him? We can't be sure
about this one, but the fact that
they can still stand each other
after a week alone in a one-room
cabin speaks for itself. And, fi-

nally, will Ranee let them get
away? He does, of course, but
only after Minnie beats him two
out of three at poker while
Johnson is bleeding to death,
face down on the table.
ACT has given the play their
usual lavish production; the set is
quite nice to look at. But none of
the players seem to know what to
do with themselves, which K in
this case, understandable. Most
of them do a good job ol taking
the whole mess seriously, but

every once in a while Richard
Denison (Johnson) dissolves
into helpless laughter, which
could be prompted by either the
girl or the play.
Barbara Dirickson plows
through like a real trouper in the
role of Minnie, but as a star vehi
cle the play leaves much to be de
sired. She does, to her credit, un
derplay the moment when, upon
meeting Johnson, she sits on the
gun she always carries.
Nowhere in its press campaign
for The Girl of the Golden West

does ACT give a good excuse for
resurrecting the play. David Be
lasco was born in San Francisco,
but he left early to become the
King of Broadway. The play is
set in the Gold Rush, hut gold
and California are never men
tioned. ACI used to do quite a
few good plays, but now they ap
pear content to take only one or
two chances a season.

I'm not saying that 1 would
have walked out after Act I had I
been a paying customer. It takes
a great deal of moral fiber to
leave early with an $11 ticket
stub in your pocket. But, when
faced with such unalloyed trash
ias The Girl of the Golden West, it
would be a comfort to have the
choice.
In an ACT season composed
largely of money-making
schlock. The Girl of the Golden
West will probably stand out as
the biggest artistic disaster of all.
David Belasco may have been
"one of the most influential men
in the history of the American
theater," as the program notes
claim, but he was obviously a
better director and producer
than writer. Cardboard charac
ters, ludicrous dialogue and poor
construction are half the prob
lem; if anyone pays attention to
the play past the first act, they'll
discover racial stereotypes, blat
ant melodrama and a moral
sense so hazy as to be non
existent.
The moral aspect is the most
annoying of all. Normally, it
could be safely ignored; but the
company, knowing it has a tur
key on its hands, has advertised
the play as a moral epic. Director
Edward Hastings claims that the
play is concerned with "the ques
tion of right and wrong." Should
Minnie (the Girl) shelter
Johnson (a notorious high
wayman)? Should Jack Ranee

(the card-sharping sheriff) run
them in? Should Minnie leave
the boys in the mining camp and
start a new life with Johnson?
The play, however, seems in
tent on asking different ques
tions. Questions like, will Minnie
fall for the blonde hunk? She
does, at first glance, from across
the dance floor. Will she go to
bed with him? We can't be sure
about this one, but the fact that
they can still stand each other
after a week alone in a one-room
cabin speaks for itself. And, fi-

nally, will Ranee let them get
away? He does, of course, but
only after Minnie beats him two
out of three at poker while
Johnson is bleeding to death,
face down on the table.
ACT has given the play their
usual lavish production; the set is
quite nice to look at. But none of
the players seem to know what to
do with themselves, which K in
this case, understandable. Most
of them do a good job ol taking
the whole mess seriously, but

every once in a while Richard
Denison (Johnson) dissolves
into helpless laughter, which
could be prompted by either the
girl or the play.
Barbara Dirickson plows
through like a real trouper in the
role of Minnie, but as a star vehi
cle the play leaves much to be de
sired. She does, to her credit, un
derplay the moment when, upon
meeting Johnson, she sits on the
gun she always carries.
Nowhere in its press campaign
for The Girl of the Golden West

does ACT give a good excuse for
resurrecting the play. David Be
lasco was born in San Francisco,
but he left early to become the
King of Broadway. The play is
set in the Gold Rush, hut gold
and California are never men
tioned. ACI used to do quite a
few good plays, but now they ap
pear content to take only one or
two chances a season.

While returning to my seat for
the second act of the American
Conservatory Theatre's produc
tion of The Girl of the Golden
West, 1 passed a knot of literati
who had paused before the door
to the orchestra. One, appa
rently their leader, addressed the
group.
"What do you think?" he
asked, gazing down the aisle at
the plywood-and-styrofoam sa
loon on stage. "Should we go
back for more of this?"
As I edged around the talking
blue blazers in the aisle (" I like a
play that makes sense.") and
climbed over the talking white
coats at the end of my row
("There's this wonderful new
gallery on Post Street. It's in a
loft."), I realized that I had just
heard expressed, in a nutshell,
the theater critic's dilemma. I
was trapped; having accepted my
complimentary tickets, I had no
choice but to sit through two
hours "more of this." Unless, of
"course, I chose to receive no
more free tickets.
I'm not saying that 1 would
have walked out after Act I had I
been a paying customer. It takes
a great deal of moral fiber to
leave early with an $11 ticket
stub in your pocket. But, when
