# Arroyo festival brings musicians to the dorms
## 
### 
Bringing music off the stages and into the
dorms was the idea behind a project sponsored this
year by the Office of Residential Education. I hey
offered to co-sponsor (i.e., pick up the tab tor)
music programs with campus dormitories in which
Bay Area artists would give free performances and
afterward discuss their careers and music. It was
hoped that students would be exposed to a side ot
music not seen in the concert hall.
Only one dorm took them up on it, but they're
glad they did. The Arroyo Music Festival, co
sponsored by Arroyo House in Wilbur Hall, has

already had two successful dates (drummer Leroy
Mattis and bluegrass group Greg Canute and the
Small Wonder String Band) and has scheduled
three more. Tonight at 9:00 Doug Whitier and
Caliope, a "jumping jazz quintet," will perform
and discuss their music.
On Friday, February 22. at 9:00 p.m.. cellist
Bonnie Hampton will present "a lady and her vio
lin cello." On Thursday, February 28, at 8:00 p.m.,
the octet The Merritones will "guide you through
an adventure in Rhythm and Blues." The entire
campus community is encouraged to listen and
learn about the artist and his trade.
