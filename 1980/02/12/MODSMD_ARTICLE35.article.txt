# New wave floods San Francisco
## 
### 
Why sit back unci watch the show it one can
he a part of it? It was this question that had a
whole generation up on their feet and danc
ing at the Fillmore West back in the '60s,
and it is this same question that has current
San Francisco rock enthusiasts skipping con
certs in large auditoriums in favorof shows in
small clubs, where dancing and socializing
are more possible. With the recent opening
of several new wave dance clubs in San Fran
cisco, rock and roll is once again becoming an
active experience in the Kay Area.
New wave music is not unfamiliar to San
Francisco; the Mabuhay Gardens on Broad
way. now called the Fab Mab, has been pre
senting new wave bands for a couple of years
now. Within the last few months, however,
many clubs which once presented other kinds
of music have switched to new wave prog
rams. Local bands like the Dead Kennedeys
and Crime, who were once limited by the
nature of their shows to playing one or two
Bay Area clubs, now find many clubs seeking
to bill them as acts.
Meanwhile, at many discos, records by ar
tists such as Donna Summer and the Bee
Gees are being replaced in favorof singles by
groups like SVT and the Mutants.
New wave discos have been open in New
York and London for well over a year now,
but it was not until this past August that they
appeared in San Francisco. Jeffrey Pollack,
who at that time owned the Old Waldorf,
began using a comedy club called The Punch
Line as a rock and roll disco, X's, on Monday
and Tuesday nights. Radio station KSAN
had been undergoing a programming change
at that time, leaving three of their more ex
perimental disc-jockey s off their schedule. It
was these three, Howie Klein, Richard Gos
sett and Beverley Wilshire. who became the
disc-jockeys at X's.
As KSAN's ratings steadily decreased, the
size of the crowds at X's steadily rose. In
October, Pollack decided that two nights a
week was not enough, and moved the club to
its present location on Columbus and Lom
bard streets, where it is now open seven
nights a week. This January, X's began pre
senting live bands every Friday and Saturday
night, in a room downstairs from the main
dance floor.

The club generally attracts a rather diverse
audience, ranging from punk rockers to Ted
Kennedy; its clean, well-lit atmosphere actu
ally seems more suitable to the latter rather
than the former. Acoustically the club is
superb, especially downstairs, where the live
bands can get away with a very loud sound
before they begin to sound distorted.
Influenced by X's success. The City, one of
San Francisco's leading discotheques,
switched their programming to rock and roll
two weeks ago. Klein, Wilshire and Gossett
have left X's to become the new disc-jockeys
at The City. The Montgomery Street club has
strictly been playing records as dance music,
but England's The Specials will play the first
live show there this Wednesday night.
Right near The City, in Bartol Alley off
Broadway, the same owner has opened the
Back DOR (Dance Oriented Music), which
nightly presents live new wave acts. This club
also happens to be only a block away from
the Fab Mab, and with its more comfortable
atmosphere and slightly nicer acoustics, the
Back DOR might soon be drawing many of
the Fab Mab's patrons; that is if they can find
it. The club is hidden in a small alley which
seems more suitable for a mugging than a
night spot.
There are some who might think that one
is safer in a dark alley than next to the stage
when a rowdy punk band is playing, but gen
erally the crowds manage to stay relatively
under control despite the pushes and shoves
that might occur. In the case of X's and The
City, there is in fact a bit of a pervasive mel
lowness which might even disappoint those
who head up from the suburbs expecting
some kind of wild rock and roll delirium;
there are the mundane "beautiful people" at
these places also.
Those looking for the bizarre punk scene
should go to The Temple Beautiful at 1839
Geary Street. The club is an old Jewish
synagogue which has been converted into a
place for bands to play music, yet it still has
not lost its temple atmosphere. Originally
known as Theatre 1839, the club housed
such acts as Jerry Garcia and Hot Tuna. This
past summer, the owners began presenting
new wave acts on a non-regular basis, and the
response was so favorable that The Temple

now presents live new wave acts every Friday
and Saturday night.
Each night's show generally consists of
four or even five bands, who often play at
such a high decibel level that the sound can
be quite distorted. Due to the fact that a good
part of the crowd is jumping up and down as
they dance, the ground floor often trembles
as though there were a mild earthquake. One
can, however, find refuge in the seats up on
the balcony, though sitting down certainly is
the wrong way to experience the show.
With still other small clubs opening which
are presenting new wave, one might wonder
if the supply will eventually exceed the de
mand. What of the future for such music?
"Within a year or two, the Ramones will be
considered a progressive rock band, being
played on the radio quite regularly," says
Howie Klein, who along with being a disc
jockey at The City is also the producer of 415
Records, and one of the leading figures of the
West Coast new wave scene.
Klein adds: "This kind of music might not
be getting that much airplay now, but I re
member when 1 was working at a college
station on the East Coast back in the '60s
and they tried to impeach me for playing
Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead.
When that stuff first came out, it was consi
dered weird; in the same way, many consider
this stuff weird today, but in a few years they
probably won't. The only music that goes
over right away is the Hollywood-packaged
type music of a group like The Knack. If
something gets played enough, people are
going to like it."
What kind of people will enjoy a new wave
club?
"To begin with," says Klein, "closed
minded people should stay away. This is not
music based on ideology; we'll give people
variety, and if they don't like it they can go
elsewhere."
Whether it is the music of the '80s or just a
passing fad, new wave music has indeed
brought life back to a Bay Area music scene
which was getting somewhat lifeless in the
'70s, living on its past merits. Rock and
roll music is once again reaching not only
people's ears, but their hearts as well, hats off
to Johnny Rotten.

are presenting new wave, one might wonder
if the supply will eventually exceed the de
mand. What of the future for such music?
"Within a year or two, the Ramones will be
considered a progressive rock band, being
played on the radio quite regularly," says
Howie Klein, who along with being a disc
jockey at The City is also the producer of 415
Records, and one of the leading figures of the
West Coast new wave scene.
Klein adds: "This kind of music might not
be getting that much airplay now, but I re
member when 1 was working at a college
station on the East Coast back in the '60s
and they tried to impeach me for playing
Jefferson Airplane and The Grateful Dead.
When that stuff first came out, it was consi
dered weird; in the same way, many consider
this stuff weird today, but in a few years they
probably won't. The only music that goes
over right away is the Hollywood-packaged
type music of a group like The Knack. If
something gets played enough, people are
going to like it."
What kind of people will enjoy a new wave
club?
"To begin with," says Klein, "closed
minded people should stay away. This is not
music based on ideology; we'll give people
variety, and if they don't like it they can go
elsewhere."
Whether it is the music of the '80s or just a
passing fad, new wave music has indeed
brought life back to a Bay Area music scene
which was getting somewhat lifeless in the
'70s, living on its past merits. Rock and
roll music is once again reaching not only
people's ears, but their hearts as well, hats off
to Johnny Rotten.

Why sit back unci watch the show it one can
he a part of it? It was this question that had a
whole generation up on their feet and danc
ing at the Fillmore West back in the '60s,
and it is this same question that has current
San Francisco rock enthusiasts skipping con
certs in large auditoriums in favorof shows in
small clubs, where dancing and socializing
are more possible. With the recent opening
of several new wave dance clubs in San Fran
cisco, rock and roll is once again becoming an
active experience in the Kay Area.
New wave music is not unfamiliar to San
Francisco; the Mabuhay Gardens on Broad
way. now called the Fab Mab, has been pre
senting new wave bands for a couple of years
now. Within the last few months, however,
many clubs which once presented other kinds
of music have switched to new wave prog
rams. Local bands like the Dead Kennedeys
and Crime, who were once limited by the
nature of their shows to playing one or two
Bay Area clubs, now find many clubs seeking
to bill them as acts.
Meanwhile, at many discos, records by ar
tists such as Donna Summer and the Bee
Gees are being replaced in favorof singles by
groups like SVT and the Mutants.
New wave discos have been open in New
York and London for well over a year now,
but it was not until this past August that they
appeared in San Francisco. Jeffrey Pollack,
who at that time owned the Old Waldorf,
began using a comedy club called The Punch
Line as a rock and roll disco, X's, on Monday
and Tuesday nights. Radio station KSAN
had been undergoing a programming change
at that time, leaving three of their more ex
perimental disc-jockey s off their schedule. It
was these three, Howie Klein, Richard Gos
sett and Beverley Wilshire. who became the
disc-jockeys at X's.
As KSAN's ratings steadily decreased, the
size of the crowds at X's steadily rose. In
October, Pollack decided that two nights a
week was not enough, and moved the club to
its present location on Columbus and Lom
bard streets, where it is now open seven
nights a week. This January, X's began pre
senting live bands every Friday and Saturday
night, in a room downstairs from the main
dance floor.

The club generally attracts a rather diverse
audience, ranging from punk rockers to Ted
Kennedy; its clean, well-lit atmosphere actu
ally seems more suitable to the latter rather
than the former. Acoustically the club is
superb, especially downstairs, where the live
bands can get away with a very loud sound
before they begin to sound distorted.
Influenced by X's success. The City, one of
San Francisco's leading discotheques,
switched their programming to rock and roll
two weeks ago. Klein, Wilshire and Gossett
have left X's to become the new disc-jockeys
at The City. The Montgomery Street club has
strictly been playing records as dance music,
but England's The Specials will play the first
live show there this Wednesday night.
Right near The City, in Bartol Alley off
Broadway, the same owner has opened the
Back DOR (Dance Oriented Music), which
nightly presents live new wave acts. This club
also happens to be only a block away from
the Fab Mab, and with its more comfortable
atmosphere and slightly nicer acoustics, the
Back DOR might soon be drawing many of
the Fab Mab's patrons; that is if they can find
it. The club is hidden in a small alley which
seems more suitable for a mugging than a
night spot.
There are some who might think that one
is safer in a dark alley than next to the stage
when a rowdy punk band is playing, but gen
erally the crowds manage to stay relatively
under control despite the pushes and shoves
that might occur. In the case of X's and The
City, there is in fact a bit of a pervasive mel
lowness which might even disappoint those
who head up from the suburbs expecting
some kind of wild rock and roll delirium;
there are the mundane "beautiful people" at
these places also.
Those looking for the bizarre punk scene
should go to The Temple Beautiful at 1839
Geary Street. The club is an old Jewish
synagogue which has been converted into a
place for bands to play music, yet it still has
not lost its temple atmosphere. Originally
known as Theatre 1839, the club housed
such acts as Jerry Garcia and Hot Tuna. This
past summer, the owners began presenting
new wave acts on a non-regular basis, and the
response was so favorable that The Temple

now presents live new wave acts every Friday
and Saturday night.
Each night's show generally consists of
four or even five bands, who often play at
such a high decibel level that the sound can
be quite distorted. Due to the fact that a good
part of the crowd is jumping up and down as
they dance, the ground floor often trembles
as though there were a mild earthquake. One
can, however, find refuge in the seats up on
the balcony, though sitting down certainly is
the wrong way to experience the show.
