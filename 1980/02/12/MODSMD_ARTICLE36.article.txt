'Abscam' investigation defended
WASHINGTON — Attorney General Benjamin
Civiletti said yesterday in defense of the govern
ment's "Abscam" bribery investigation that crimes
disclosed b\ undercover agents "were not created by
the FBI." '
Abscam, tor "Arab scam," was the FBl's code
name forthe investigation that resulted in allegations
that eight members of Congress, about 12 other pub
lic officials and 10 businessmen were involved in
bribery attempts by undercover FBI agents.
But Civ iletti said he could not flatly guarantee that
entrapment was not involv ed because he lacked dav
to-day personal knowledge of the 18-month inquiry.
"In any undercover operation, dealing in a milieu
ot middlemen, con artists, underworld types . . . from
time to time misrepresentations will be made to the
persons running the operations," he said.
Civ iletti said he had been told by FBI Director
William Webster and Philip Heymann, assistant at
torney general in charge of the Department of Jus
tice's criminal division, that careful decisions were
made on "the close and careful and difficult" legal
questions raised by undercover work.
Beyond the eight already implicated, noothercon
gressmen or senator was involved in the sensitive
investigation, according to Civ iletti.
He denounced leaksabout the investigation, which
he said "have endangered innocent persons."
He said he had asked Richard Blumenthal, U.S.
attorney in Connecticut, to head the internal investi
gation being conducted to determine the source,
causes and motivations of any leaks. Civ iletti said the
goal was not only punishment of any government
employees leaking information to reporters but re
medies to guard against a repetition of the leaks.
Olympic move still under debate
LAKE PLACID. N Y. — In politically disturbed
Lake Placid on the eve of the 1980 Olympic Winter
Olympics, there appeared no thawing of opposition
yesterday to a U.S. plea to pull the Summer Games
out of the Soviet Union.
1 he argument over whether the Summer Olympics
should be held in Moscow continued before the In
ternational Olympic Committee, while courts dealt
with another politically-rooted issue in Albany, not
far away.
1 he Appellate Division of the state Supreme Court
unanimously upheld the committee's rule barring
Taiwan athletes from using the flag or another of the
Republic of China.
It upheld by higher courts, the decision could pro
voke a walkout by the Taiwanese. But it would clear
the way forthe first participation ever by the People's
Republic of China, or communist China, in the
Winter Olympics.
With the Winter Games set to start today, Robert
Kane, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
again presented President Jimmy Carter's demand
that the Summer Games be moved from Moscow,
posponed or canceled it the Soviets do not withdraw
their troops from Afghanistan by Feb. 20.
Carter has said he will ask that no U.S. team be sent
to Moscow if his conditions are not met. U.S. officials
abroad have lobbied other friendly governments to
take the same stand.
But there were strong indications that the Interna
tional Olympic Committee would reject Carter's plea
before it concluded its special session in Lake Placid
today. Lord Killanin. president of the international
committee, had said repeatedly the Summer Games
could not be moved.
Carter keeps no-campaign policy
AUGUSTA. Maine — President Jimmy Carter,
the victor in Maine's Democratic presidential con
test. wnn t even consider changing his no-campaign
policy until there is a break in the Tehran hostage
situation, his spokesman said yesterday.
Sen. Edward Kennedy's allies said the challenger
tor the Democratic presidential nomination did so
well despite losing that Carter will have to leave the

White House and campaign actively.
But White House press secretary Jodv Powell said
the president probably will not campaign in person
for the New Hampshire presidential primary election
two weeks from today. He said Carter's decision not
to go on the road to seek votes is based on the interna
tional situation, not on the outcome of any political
contest.
Carter gained 45 percent of the vote at Maine's
Democratic town meetings on Sunday while Ken
nedy received 39 percent.
California Gov. Jerry Brown ran third with 14
percent. Although he said that made Maine the state
where his campaign took off, he fell short of the 15
percent vote he needed to earn a share of Maine's
delegates at the Democratic National Convention.
The Kennedy campaign insisted that Carter had
not gained a big enough margin in Maine to be a real
winner. Maine Gov. Joseph Brennan went so far as to
claim that Carter had lost because he didn't get 50
percent of the vote.
Brennan said that if Brown had not been entered,
the senator from Massachusetts would have beaten
the president.
Massachusetts Lt. Go\. Thomas O'Neill, son of the
House speaker, said Kennedy will do better in New
Hampshire's Feb. 26 presidential primary election
than he did in Maine.
But Powell said Kennedy had all the advantages in
Maine. He questioned w here Kennedy can win "if he
can't win here."
Brennan insisted that the advantages were with
Carter. He said the president's campaign spending in
Maine doubled Kennedy's.
4 die from abortion funds cutoff
WASHINGTON — At least four poor women
have died as a result of the cutoff of practically all
federal funds for Medicaid abortions, according to
U.S. medical investigators.
Investigators for the federal Center for Disease
Control in Atlanta said they have identified eight
other deaths resulting from illegal or self-induced
abortions that could not be linked to the termination
of federal financing of abortions. Two of the eight
were teenagers who were afraid to tell their parents
they were pregnant.
Members of the CDC abortion surveillance team
said a common effect of the cutoff of federal funds in
August 1977 has been a delay in poor women obtain
ing abortions, increasing the risk of complications.
They also saw indications that some poor women
who would have had government-assisted abortions
are having their babies instead.
CDC physicians said they at first expected to find
many more deaths directly or indirectly linked to the
cutoff of funds under Congress' Hyde Amendment,
which restricts federal payment for abortions to cases
when the mother's life is in danger or the pregnancy
results from rape or incest.
The figures are lower than anticipated, they said,
because the vast majority of women who would have
received federally assisted abortions live in states that
continue to pay for the procedures.
A federal judge has ordered U.S. authorities to
resume abortion funding on Friday. The Carter ad
ministration plans to appeal his ruling to the Supreme
Court.
The judge. John Dooling Jr. of Brooklyn, found, in
part, that the Hyde Amendment increased the risk of
maternal deaths and caused some women to seek
illegal abortions.
Atomic gas escapes from TMI
MIDDLETOWN, Pa. — Radioactive water leaked
from the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant's
reactor cooling sy stem yesterday and some radioac
tive material escaped into the atmosphere, plant offi
cials said.
"A review of monitoring devices . . . confirms
there was a small release of radioactive gases, proba
bly krypton 85, during today's incident," said a
statement from the Metropolitan Edison Co.,

operator of the power plant.
Met Kd officials said about 1000 gallons of water
leaked from the system, cooling the plant's damaged
reactor. Hut they said the water was contained in a
sealed auxiliary building and no one was hurt.
The Met Kd statement said the krypton was de
tected by monitors atop the auxiliary building. "The
reading was taken ... at the time of maximum con
centration. Monitors at the plant boundaries a few
hundred yards away showed no positive readings," it
said.
"There would be no adverse health effects to
workers on the island from such a minute release,"
the statement said.
"It appears there was a release of approximately
300 millicuries of krypton gas ... it was released into
the atmosphere," Heinz said.
Sandy Polon, head of the plant's public relations
office, said the amount described by Hein/ would be
very small.
Carter proposes nuke waste sites
WASHINGTON — In what is the nation's first
plant to dispose of its nuclear garbage. President
Jimmy Carter will ask Congress today for permission
to buy a permanent repository for radioactive waste
and a storage pool for burned-out nuclear fuel.
I he president will declare in a six-page message to
Congress his intention to select by 1985 at least one
permanent repository for radioactive wastes from
among 11 candidate sites. They include the Nevada
Test Site where nuclear weapons are detonated un
derground. the Hanford, Wash., site, where military
wastes already are stored and eight underground salt
domes inland from the Gulf of Mexico in Mississippi,
Louisiana and Texas.
In an accompany ing move. Carter will tell Con
gress he plans to stop a controversial research prog
ram to bury military nuclear wastes in a salt mine in
New Mexico. The cancellation of the Waste Isolation
Pilot Plant comes alter $90 million has been spent
developing the site 30 miles southeast of Carlsbad.
1 he president will tell Congress he intends to estab
lish a repository for burned out nuclear fuel by 1983.
declaring that he wants legislation by 1981 authoriz
ing the federal government to buy at least one
"away-from-reactor" storage site. This site would be
used to keep burned-out nuclear fuel now accumulat
ing at nuclear plants in the United States.
Doctors blamed for infant deaths
PEORIA. HI. — Mistakes by physicians may cause
more than one fourth of the cases of respiratory dis
tress syndrome, the leading cause of illness and death
among newborns, according to a new study.
Dr. William Powers, associate director of the
Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of St. Francis Hospital,
said doctors apparently are allowing unnecessary
premature births, which increase the chances of a
respiratory distress syndrome known as RDS.
In RDS, the infant's lungs are unable to produce a
tluid that keeps the lung tissues elastic, and the small
air sacs in the lungs can collapse when the baby
exhales, cutting off oxygen to the blood.
I he National Center for Health Statistics estimates
that each year 50,000 newborns are afflicted with
RDS and that more than 6500 die.
An examination of 100 cases of RDS at St. Francis
Hospital revealed that 20 cases were caused by doc
tors who delivered infants before they were ready to
be born, either through elective Ceasarean section or
by inducing labor. In eight additional cases, doctors
made no attempt to stop premature labor.
