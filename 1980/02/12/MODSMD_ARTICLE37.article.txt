BERKELEY—Activist Daniel
Ellsberg, echoing the rhetoric of the
turbulent 19605, told about 2000
University of California students yes
terday that military draft was "irrelev
ant."
Ellsberg, who gained national prom
inence for his opposition to the Viet
nam War, said, "The draft is irrelev
ant" because any war in the Mideast
would no doubt rely on nuclear
weapons rather than combat soldiers.
Since President Jimmy Carter has
announced plans to resume draft regis
tration, the UC campus here hits been
the sight of several protests. Similar
demonstrations here were scheduled
yesterday on a number of other cam
puses in California.
In urging the students at the
scheduled anti-draft rally to "distrust
the cult of leadership," Ellsberg said,
"No one can tell you you have an obli
gation to kill another human being."
Political activist Tom Hayden ad
dressed about 1,500 persons at Sac
ramento State yesterday afternoon.
Hayden told the audience that the gov
ernment's proposal to return the draft
is an attempt "to use you as a chip in an
international game of military poker.
You are pawns in a game of nuclear
brinksmanship."
He said one explanation for the pos
sibility of bringing back the draft is
domestic presidential politics. "War
has always been good for what ails a
president," he said.

Hayden warned that the economy is
too dependent on sorces of oil that
would force "a military grab of oil if
that oil ever got beyond our reach." He
said it turns our economy into "A
house ot cards in a rising wind."
He suggested the answer is to turn to
alternate sources of fuel.
"Where is the draft for the war
against rising energy wastes?" he
asked. "We don't have to die for oil, we
can engage in energy alternatives that
will be good for us and good for the rest
of the world."
At UC-San Diego, activist David
Harris, who served time in prison for
refusing the draft during the Vietnam
War, told about 3,000 students, "Our
Bill ot Rights and our Constitution are
the only things we should fight for —
the rest is garbage."
He said President Carter had "com
i mitted 500,000 persons to die in the
sands of Arabia in order to keep the
Cadillac Eldorado and the electric
fork."
Calling on students to "remember
the ghosts'' of Vietnam, Harris said.
"There's no sense in repeating it all
over again."
At UC-Santa Barbara, abot 1,000
students participated in another anti
draft rally. Another 400 students on
the UCLA campus listened to religious
officials and Undergraduate Student
Body President Jerry Kurland con
demn dratt registration.
No arrests or incidents were re
ported at any of the campuses.
