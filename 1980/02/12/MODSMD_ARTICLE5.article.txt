# Release possible with Khomeini approval
## Hostages mark 100th day of captivity 
### 
From the Daily wire services
PARIS — The Americans held hos
tage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
could be released in a few days, subject
to the approval of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iranian President Abolhas
san Bani-Sadr said in an interview pub
lished here yesterday.
The president said that the Iranian
Revolutionary Council, which he heads,
had submitted a proposal for the fre
eing of the hostages to Khomeini, and
that it does not set the extradition of
the deposed shah or the return of his
fortune as conditions for the freeing ot
the hostages held since Nov. 4.
In Tehran, Khomeini marked the
first anniversary of his Islamic revolu
tion in Iran by vowing to continue bat
tle against "the ruthless devourer," the
United States. He made no mention of
the hostages, who marked their 100 th
day in captivity.
The interview, held Saturday night,
was with the Tehran correspondent to
the Paris newspaper Le Monde. Eric
Rouleau. He is especially close to
Bani-Sadr and has been the president s
most frequent interviewer.
The official Pars news agency said
Bani-Sadr had been misquoted but did
not say what the alleged misquite was.
Bani-Sadr said Saturday night, after
a meeting of the council, that he ex
pected Khomeini to act on its recom
mendation in about two days. Atter
that, Bani-Sadr said, it would he up to
the United States to make "a sell
criticism in good and due form ol the
crimes it committed in Iran tor a
quarter-century and the recognition of

our right to obtain the extradition of
the shah and the restitution of his for
tune."
To get the hostages back, the United
States would only need to "recognize
its responsibilities and commit itself
not to mix into our affairs any longer,"
Bani-Sadr said.
His government is so sure of the jus
tice of its case that it is ready in advance
to accept the conclusions of an interna
tional investigation, the president said.
In Washington. State Dept. spokes
man Hodding Carter said the United
States will not "profess guilt" tor its
record in Iran as part of a deal to win
release of the hostages. Carter ruled
out that possibility when he was asked
about the statement by Bani-Sadr. Car
ter had no further comment on the
American efforts to release the hos
tages.
The Revolutionary Council is di
vided on whether to accept United Na
tions Secretary General Kurt Wal
dheim's proposal for a U.N. investigat
ing committee made up of Third World
states or a kind of "Third World
Nuremberg Tribunal" of independent

non-governmental personalities who
would place "American imperialism"
on trial, Bani-Sadr said.
He said he leaned to the second idea,
but that a combination of the two
would be ideal. "In any case," he said,
"we have transmitted our proposals,
which represent a consensus, to Imam
Khomeini, who is the sole authority to
make the decision. We hope to get it in
the next two days. If he accepts, it will
be up to President Carter to pronounce
himself in turn."
Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said
Waldheim's negotiations for release of
the Americans "arc at a very sensitive
stage." Spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar
said Waldheim "is very closely follow
ing all statements by President Bani-
Sadr. including the statement given to
Le Monde."
Bani-Sadr said he was considering
the possibility of the Iranian govern
ment's taking the hostages from the
students, who have been holding them
in the U.S. Embassy. But. he said, the
Revolutionary Council and Khomeini
would have to approve his proposal to
that effect, adding that there is no ques
tion of taking the hostages away from

the students by force.
It has been known tor some time that
there were French leftist lawyers work
ing (in this and other similar formulas
lor frc ing the hostages while satistying
the demands of the Iranian re
volutionaries for satisfaction.
By the language he chose and in a
lengthy discussion of the problems of
broadening his government and of al
lowing free expression in Iran, Bani-
Sadr made clear that he is aware that he
is and has been walking for some time
on political eggs.
He said that the United States had
been wrong to interpret the hostage
taking as an expression of the revolu
tion's "savagery' or "fanaticism,' and
that the\ were also wrong to consider
that his own recent election victory was
a triumph of French-made, pro-
Western liberalism over the Moslem
clergy.
The Americans, he said, "have not
yet understood that there were two
sides ot the same coin — our people's
determination to be independent. II
they admit that fact, it would be easy
for us to free the hostages, perhaps
even in the forthcoming days."

states or a kind of "Third World
Nuremberg Tribunal" of independent

non-governmental personalities who
would place "American imperialism"
on trial, Bani-Sadr said.
He said he leaned to the second idea,
but that a combination of the two
would be ideal. "In any case," he said,
"we have transmitted our proposals,
which represent a consensus, to Imam
Khomeini, who is the sole authority to
make the decision. We hope to get it in
the next two days. If he accepts, it will
be up to President Carter to pronounce
himself in turn."
Meanwhile, a U.N. spokesman said
Waldheim's negotiations for release of
the Americans "arc at a very sensitive
stage." Spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar
said Waldheim "is very closely follow
ing all statements by President Bani-
Sadr. including the statement given to
Le Monde."
Bani-Sadr said he was considering
the possibility of the Iranian govern
ment's taking the hostages from the
students, who have been holding them
in the U.S. Embassy. But. he said, the
Revolutionary Council and Khomeini
would have to approve his proposal to
that effect, adding that there is no ques
tion of taking the hostages away from

the students by force.
It has been known tor some time that
there were French leftist lawyers work
ing (in this and other similar formulas
lor frc ing the hostages while satistying
the demands of the Iranian re
volutionaries for satisfaction.
By the language he chose and in a
lengthy discussion of the problems of
broadening his government and of al
lowing free expression in Iran, Bani-
Sadr made clear that he is aware that he
is and has been walking for some time
on political eggs.
He said that the United States had
been wrong to interpret the hostage
taking as an expression of the revolu
tion's "savagery' or "fanaticism,' and
that the\ were also wrong to consider
that his own recent election victory was
a triumph of French-made, pro-
Western liberalism over the Moslem
clergy.
The Americans, he said, "have not
yet understood that there were two
sides ot the same coin — our people's
determination to be independent. II
they admit that fact, it would be easy
for us to free the hostages, perhaps
even in the forthcoming days."
From the Daily wire services
PARIS — The Americans held hos
tage at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
could be released in a few days, subject
to the approval of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iranian President Abolhas
san Bani-Sadr said in an interview pub
lished here yesterday.
The president said that the Iranian
Revolutionary Council, which he heads,
had submitted a proposal for the fre
eing of the hostages to Khomeini, and
that it does not set the extradition of
the deposed shah or the return of his
fortune as conditions for the freeing ot
the hostages held since Nov. 4.
In Tehran, Khomeini marked the
first anniversary of his Islamic revolu
tion in Iran by vowing to continue bat
tle against "the ruthless devourer," the
United States. He made no mention of
the hostages, who marked their 100 th
day in captivity.
The interview, held Saturday night,
was with the Tehran correspondent to
the Paris newspaper Le Monde. Eric
Rouleau. He is especially close to
Bani-Sadr and has been the president s
most frequent interviewer.
The official Pars news agency said
Bani-Sadr had been misquoted but did
not say what the alleged misquite was.
Bani-Sadr said Saturday night, after
a meeting of the council, that he ex
pected Khomeini to act on its recom
mendation in about two days. Atter
that, Bani-Sadr said, it would he up to
the United States to make "a sell
criticism in good and due form ol the
crimes it committed in Iran tor a
quarter-century and the recognition of

our right to obtain the extradition of
the shah and the restitution of his for
tune."
To get the hostages back, the United
States would only need to "recognize
its responsibilities and commit itself
not to mix into our affairs any longer,"
Bani-Sadr said.
His government is so sure of the jus
tice of its case that it is ready in advance
to accept the conclusions of an interna
tional investigation, the president said.
In Washington. State Dept. spokes
man Hodding Carter said the United
States will not "profess guilt" tor its
record in Iran as part of a deal to win
release of the hostages. Carter ruled
out that possibility when he was asked
about the statement by Bani-Sadr. Car
ter had no further comment on the
American efforts to release the hos
tages.
