# Agency settles rift with law students
## 
### 
Problems which arose earlier this year between Sequoia
Travel in Tresidder Union and law students here appear to
have been worked out.
Sequoia threatened in December to cut back courtesy
services to all law student customers because. Sequoia
claimed, they have been rude and intimidating.
But Sequoia manager Ellie Friar said yesterday the com
pany "has no intention" of cutting back the services and
that there have.been no recent problems with law students.
Director\)t Placement at the Law School Gloria Pyszka
issued a memo to all law students Dec. 10 warning them ot
Sequoia's threat to stop extending credit to students whose
airline tickets are being paid for by companies with whom
they have job interviews.
"In no situation is there any justification for the apparent
discourtesy for which the Law School student body has
become well known." Pyszka said in the memo.
Altercations
Friar would not describe any ot the altercations which
prompted Sequoia to complain to Pys/ka.
Law students, however, claim that it is the Sequoia work
ers who are being rude.
Paul Durham, a third-year law student, has resolved
never to go back to Sequoia after workers there were "un
necessarily rude" when, he said, they closed their office
early one Friday, refused to give him his airline ticket and
"slammed the door in my face."
'"Sequoia has an incredible monopoly here," Durham
said. "As a result they can be less deferential to their cus
tomers than most travel agencies."
Not a monopoly
Friar said the company never closes its doors before its
regular hours, which are posted on the doors.
She also said Sequoia is in no way a monopoly.

"Students and faculty have the perfect right to go any
where else they want," she said. "And Sequoia isn t even
the only travel agency on Stanford land â€” there's one in
Stanford Shopping Center."
Ticket problems
Durham also claimed that Sequoia told him one airline
was booked solid and that when he called the ticket com
pany himself, he was able to get tickets.
" Maybe the person I was talking to just didn t know how
to use the machine," he said. "But it still showed incompe
tence."
Other students have complained about the long lines to
pick up tickets or to make reservations.
"At certain times of the year, there are long lines." Friar
said. "And with the recent deregulation of airlines and the
United Airlines strike, the lines came at unexpected times."
Some have no complaints
Some students who have used Sequoia's service say they
have no complaints.
"The lines go fast. I've never had to wait a long time. I've
always been given good ser\ ice and good information, said
Bruce Machmeier, a third-year law student. " I here have
been no screw-ups at all."
If Sequoia were to stop extending credit, many students
would be in a bind, some said.
However, other travel agencies in the area also extend
credit, some without requiring a letter, as Sequoia does,
from prospective employers saying they will pay air tare
expense.
Credit
"We give any Stanford student 10 days to pay tor his
ticket," said David Shallenberger. manager and owner of
Small World Travel on ElCamino Real near Rickey's Hyatt
House. " We also deliver the tickets to students on campus."
