# The 						'Wall': is finish just around a chrome bend?
## 
### Samuel Howe Staff Writer 
Something's not going on here.
But it might be soon, construction
planners say.
The controversial Albers' Wall,
between the Quad and the Physics
Tank, has had a history of building
delays since groundbreaking in the
spring of 1978, but it just may be
done in the near future, according to
Don Price, University construction
manager.
A meeting this afternoon will
"get the thing back on a firm com
mited schedule," Price said. While
the wall could possibly be completed
in three to four weeks' time, he said
the difficulties inherent in bringing
together many different workers to
complete the object will probably
make the completion date some
what later.
"A few guys will work for two or
three days, then they go away for
awhile," Price said in explaining the
delays. And.he said, the design of
the art object is oriented so that
"everything must be technically
perfect" and construction must be
carefully done "one step at a time."
A mistake at any stage now could
result in part of the work having to
be taken apart at a later date, he
said.
Hardly love
The story of Albers' Wall is
hardly a love story. In fact, the pro
ject met with considerable derision
when it was first proposed in 1971,
and an originally selected site near
the Law School was turned down
due to protests from administrators
and students there.
A proposal to move the site to its
present location in the Lomita Mall
just outside of the "Tank," the
Physics lecture hall, was met with
some protest but not enough to pre
vent construction.
"We were pretty neutral about it
at the time," said Prof. Walter

Meyerhof, chairman of the Physics
Dept. when construction was begun.
"It is now being built, and my own
feeling is that before I make any
statement. I want to see what it
looks like when it is finished." Some
200 Physics Dept. faculty .students
and staff were not as patient and
wrote letters and petitions protest
ing the proposed site. Despite these
pleas, work on the wall commenced
in 1978 and now, two years and ap
proximately $100,000 later, it ap
proaches completion.
What is it?
What is Albers' Wall anyway?
The 8-foot, 8-inch tall. 55-foot long
two-sided relief was donated to the
University by artist Josef Albers in
1971. Donations for the project are

expected to cover almost the entire
cost, with half of the money coming
from a foundation Albers created
before his death in 1976.
The side of the sculpture facing
the Quad will be of black granite
with high-polish steel tubing in
geometric designs. The side facing
the Physics lecture hall, virtually
completed, is white brick with a pat
tern of horizontal black chrome
lines. Following the 1972 donation,
Albers had worked on the design
until 1975 and made a number of
changes. When the design was
finished, the process of selecting a
site began.
A full-scale mock-up of the wall
was actually erected in Canfield
Court, between the Undergraduate

library and the Law School in late
1975, but immediate protests ob
jecting to the site led to a decision in
January 1976 by the University
Committee on Land and Building
Development and President
Richard Lyman to turn down the
location. The University's Sub
committee on Outdoor Art then
turned to the Lomita Mall site,
which was approved in the spring of
1976.
Construction problems
Construction delays and prob
lems in finding specific material
have been blamed for the fact that
Albers' Wall is not all there by now.
The latest stall concerned problems
with black chrome rods, a major

part of the sculpture, which did not
meet University specifications be
cause the outer finish was not un
iform in color. The subsequent step,
laying the rest of the bricks, cannot
be done until the rods are ready but
they are expected to be available
very soon.
Eyesore to some, work of art to
others, the wall will eventually be
finished, although debates about its
artistic merits will likely continue
for some time.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, who is a
member of the Subcommittee on
Outdoor Art and who has stood by
the wall from the beginning, said
yesterday he hopes the project will

be finished soon. "Serious art." he
wrote in an opinion at the time of
the spring 1976 controversy over
the wall's location, "was never
created or put in public places as the
result of popular consensus. It has
been characteristic of the best in
modern art that when first shown it
has disappointed the expectations
of the public.
"At a University students should
be exposed to what they do not
know or like -- they are entitled to
learn about different ways of seeing
the world, different forms of know
ledge and how it is acquired...We
bring the Albers sculpture as a tri
bute to how the human spirit may be
manifest in art."

has disappointed the expectations
of the public.
"At a University students should
be exposed to what they do not
know or like -- they are entitled to
learn about different ways of seeing
the world, different forms of know
ledge and how it is acquired...We
bring the Albers sculpture as a tri
bute to how the human spirit may be
manifest in art."
Something's not going on here.
But it might be soon, construction
planners say.
The controversial Albers' Wall,
between the Quad and the Physics
Tank, has had a history of building
delays since groundbreaking in the
spring of 1978, but it just may be
done in the near future, according to
Don Price, University construction
manager.
A meeting this afternoon will
"get the thing back on a firm com
mited schedule," Price said. While
the wall could possibly be completed
in three to four weeks' time, he said
the difficulties inherent in bringing
together many different workers to
complete the object will probably
make the completion date some
what later.
"A few guys will work for two or
three days, then they go away for
awhile," Price said in explaining the
delays. And.he said, the design of
the art object is oriented so that
"everything must be technically
perfect" and construction must be
carefully done "one step at a time."
A mistake at any stage now could
result in part of the work having to
be taken apart at a later date, he
said.
Hardly love
The story of Albers' Wall is
hardly a love story. In fact, the pro
ject met with considerable derision
when it was first proposed in 1971,
and an originally selected site near
the Law School was turned down
due to protests from administrators
and students there.
A proposal to move the site to its
present location in the Lomita Mall
just outside of the "Tank," the
Physics lecture hall, was met with
some protest but not enough to pre
vent construction.
"We were pretty neutral about it
at the time," said Prof. Walter

Meyerhof, chairman of the Physics
Dept. when construction was begun.
"It is now being built, and my own
feeling is that before I make any
statement. I want to see what it
looks like when it is finished." Some
200 Physics Dept. faculty .students
and staff were not as patient and
wrote letters and petitions protest
ing the proposed site. Despite these
pleas, work on the wall commenced
in 1978 and now, two years and ap
proximately $100,000 later, it ap
proaches completion.
What is it?
What is Albers' Wall anyway?
The 8-foot, 8-inch tall. 55-foot long
two-sided relief was donated to the
University by artist Josef Albers in
1971. Donations for the project are

expected to cover almost the entire
cost, with half of the money coming
from a foundation Albers created
before his death in 1976.
The side of the sculpture facing
the Quad will be of black granite
with high-polish steel tubing in
geometric designs. The side facing
the Physics lecture hall, virtually
completed, is white brick with a pat
tern of horizontal black chrome
lines. Following the 1972 donation,
Albers had worked on the design
until 1975 and made a number of
changes. When the design was
finished, the process of selecting a
site began.
A full-scale mock-up of the wall
was actually erected in Canfield
Court, between the Undergraduate

library and the Law School in late
1975, but immediate protests ob
jecting to the site led to a decision in
January 1976 by the University
Committee on Land and Building
Development and President
Richard Lyman to turn down the
location. The University's Sub
committee on Outdoor Art then
turned to the Lomita Mall site,
which was approved in the spring of
1976.
Construction problems
Construction delays and prob
lems in finding specific material
have been blamed for the fact that
Albers' Wall is not all there by now.
The latest stall concerned problems
with black chrome rods, a major

part of the sculpture, which did not
meet University specifications be
cause the outer finish was not un
iform in color. The subsequent step,
laying the rest of the bricks, cannot
be done until the rods are ready but
they are expected to be available
very soon.
Eyesore to some, work of art to
others, the wall will eventually be
finished, although debates about its
artistic merits will likely continue
for some time.
Art Prof. Albert Elsen, who is a
member of the Subcommittee on
Outdoor Art and who has stood by
the wall from the beginning, said
yesterday he hopes the project will

be finished soon. "Serious art." he
wrote in an opinion at the time of
the spring 1976 controversy over
the wall's location, "was never
created or put in public places as the
result of popular consensus. It has
been characteristic of the best in
modern art that when first shown it
