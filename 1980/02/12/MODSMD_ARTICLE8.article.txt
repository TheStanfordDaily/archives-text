## SALT treaty may survive crises 
### 
WASHINGTON '(AP)
Like the death of Mark Twain,
reports of the demise of the
SALT II treaty may prove to
have been exaggerated.
Carter administration officials
say they are beginning an effort
to revive the treaty despite the
intense anti-Soviet feeling en
gendered by the occupation of
Afghanistan. Moreover, they
express some optimism the pact
could be ratified this year.
The administration strategy
hinges on the proposition that
the burden of debate has shifted
from treaty proponents to the

opponents.
Before the treaty was shelved,
supporters were in the position
of having to defend the military
balance it would create.
Now. treat) opponents must
defend the balance that could
evolve in the absence of a treaty.
That switch has put treaty op
ponents in the ironic position of
arguing that the Soviets are
likely to show voluntary restraint
in their strategic weapons prog
ram.
The Carter administration, on
the other hand, feels it can de
monstrate that if the Soviets con

tinue the kind of aggressiveness
that led them to occupy Af
ghanistan. a world without
SALT II would be considerably
less predictable, more expensive
and more dangerous for the Un
ited States.
At the moment, both the Un
ited States and the So\ iet Union
have stated their intentions to
abide by the treaty. But there is
no guarantee those voluntary
positions will survive.
The Soviets appear to have the
most immediate opportunity to
exceed the treaty limits because
all the American weapons prog

rams now underway would be
permitted by the treaty anyway.
The Soviets have almost
reached the limit of 820 modern,
multiple-war head, land-based
missiles set out in the treaty. But
their production line can turn out
about 100 of those missiles each
year. Moreover, the missiles are
powerful enough to carry more
warheads than SALT II would
permit.
Will the Soviets voluntarily
close the production line in the
absence of SALT II? Will they
forego increases in the number
of warheads atop each missile?
Administration experts say no.
"The Soviets have never exer
cised unilateral restraint. We
think their bureaucracy is incap
able of it. Their economic sy stem
is good at starting things but not
so good at shutting them down,
just like our government with its
programs." said one official, who
asked not to be named.
