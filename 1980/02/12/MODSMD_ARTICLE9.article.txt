# Begin blasts appeasement
## 
### 
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Menachem
Begin told the United States yesterday that Israel
will not he sacrificed in a policy of appeasement
toward the Arabs on the Palestinian issue.
Begin, speaking to the American Jewish Com
mittee, said that Israel would make no more con
cessions to encourage Palestinians to join talks for
autonomy in Israeli-occupied territories.
Weizman differs
In a newspaper interview published in Cairo.
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman was quoted as
speaking out strongly in favor of co-existence with
the Arabs. In a statement differing markedly from
Begins polic\. he was quoted as saying Jewish
settlements do not represent security for Israel.
The interview was taken in Israel earlier this
month.
In the Tel Aviv suburb of Petah Tikvah a bomb
blast injured 15 persons, one seriously, at the bus
stop, a hospital spokesman reported. Israel Radio
said two crowded buses left the stop moments be
fore the bomb exploded. It said police rounded up
10 Arabs and sealed off the area while they
searched for more explosives, but there was no
report that any were found.
In his speech Begin referred to statements by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance that a resolution of
the Palestinian problem would boost American in
fluence with Moslem and Arab states and ease the
strategic position against Soviet allowances in the
Middle East.
Blunt Begin
In his bluntest statement to date. Begin
cautioned "against this approach, which without
any qualification can be called appeasement."
He also rejected statements by Ambassador Sol
Linowitz. the chief American delegate to the au
tonomy talks with Egypt and Israel.
Linowitz has argued that not enough has been
achieved in the talks to encourage the Palestinians
to join. He has said that if he were a Palestinian he,
too might be reluctant.
"If anyone asks me whether we can make
suggestions to make the autonomv more attractive

for them (the Palestinians), then I say: all the at
tractions and all the encouragement was given to
them in the Camp David agreements. We mean
sincerely that they will enjoy full autonomy , but we
must ensure our security." Begin said.
Lebanon fighting
Meanwhile the Christian Phalangist enclave in
southern Lebanon erupted in heavy fighting yes
terday as Palestinian guerrillas entrenched in the
Crusader castle at Beaufort blanketed a small
Christian Lebanese village with an artillery bar
rage, killing tour persons and wounding six more.
The casualties were the worst in southern Lebanon
in more than a year.
Christian militiamen commanded b\ Maj. Saad
Haddad responded with heavy shelling on
Beaufort and the coastal city of Tyre, amid expec
tations of some kind of involvement by Israeli
armed forces if the fighting continues at the current
pace.
The artillery duels, which began shortly before
dawn and continued through midday. shattered the
relative calm that has prevailed in southern Leba
non for several weeks.
However, southern Lebanon has been tense dur
ing the on-and-off redeployment of Syrian troops
from Beirut and other coastal regions in the North
to positions along the eastern border. The with
drawal of the Syrian forces, which appeared to be
suspended yesterday as Lebanese officials warned
that a resumption of the civil war was imminent,
raised fears in Israel that the Palestine Liberation
Organization would escalate attacks in the south.
Haddad, whose Iraeli-supported militia controls
a buffer five miles deep and 60 miles along the
border from the Mediterranean to the foothills of
Mt. Herman, issued an urgent appeal on the Voice
of Israel radio for support by the Israeli army.
"We can't afford this kind of loss of our popula
tion," Haddad said. "I call upon the international
conscience to intervene to stop the massacre, and I
call especially on Prime Minister (Menachem)
Begin to fulfill his promises to help us."
