Symphony, I wouldn't hear of
celebrating with any other beer
but Grenzquell." -L. V. Beethoven
Grenzquell is a premium beer with a taste Germans particularly prize. In fact, they value
Grenzquell so highly that they reserve it for special occasions.
Over 500 years of experience in the art of creating a fine natural beer has given Grenzquell
a rich yet mellow flavor. A flavor that tells you with every sip g
that this day is, indeed, special And Grenzquell is avail-
able in a superb dark Pilsner as well 1
So the next time you're looking for a really special
heir, try one Germans drink on special occasions.
(in nzqui'll Beethoven certainly would have approved. GERMANS DRINK
ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS.
