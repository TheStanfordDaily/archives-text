### Mike Charlson Staff Writer 
In its 112 irst move toward selection of a
successor to President Richard Lyman,
the Board of Trustees yesterday estab
lished an eight-person board commit
tee to find the University's eighth pres
ident.
Lyman announced Jan. 26 that he
would leave the University this sum
mer to become president of the pre
stigious Rockefeller Foundation.
The board named Robert Minge
Brown, a well-known San Francisco at
torney and veteran trustee, chairman
of the committee.
Besides the seven other trustees. Dr.
Peter Bing, board president, will serve
on the committee ex-officio.
The committee held its first meeting
yesterday afternoon to discuss proce
dures for the search, but no announce
ments were made.
According to Robert Rosenzweig,
vice president for public affairs, a
statement of procedures would be
forthcoming in the very near future,
but no dates have been set.
The board has expressed an interest
in finding a new president before Ly
man's departure Aug. 1, but trustees
are "more interested in getting the
right person than in meeting any sort of
deadline," Rosenzweig said.
No specific method was established to
receive input from students, faculty
and alumni at the committee meeting,
he said, but "it is clear that some struc
ture for receiving that input will be set
up."
Less clear is whether staff personnel
will have any direct input into the selec

tion of the president.
When Lyman was selected in 1970,
separate committees were established
for faculty, students and alumni. All
three advisory committees examined
over 185 nominations for the post be
fore submitting short lists of candidates
to the trustee search committee.
That committee then examined the
top choices of each advisory group, in
terviewed candidates and recom
mended that Lyman be offered the job.
That recommendation was accepted
by the board and Lvman was appointed
Sept. 24, 1970.
Among other trustees to serve on the
search committee are Parmer Fuller,
retired vice president of PPG Indus
tries and John Gardner, founder of the
citizens' lobbying group Common
Cause and former secretary of Health
Education and Welfare.
Brown, Fuller and Gardner are the
only board members who served as
trustees in 1970 when Lyman was
selected as president.
Fuller was president of the board at
the time.
Other trustees to serve on the com
mittee represent a broad cross-section
of the board, including academics,
members of the business community
and alumni who have been elected trus
tees.
The other members are: William
Kimball, a San Francisco business
executive; Nancy Munger of Los
Angeles; Sallyanne Payton, law profes
sor at the University of Michigan; Otis
Pease, history professor at the Univer
sity of Washington; and Michael
Walsh, U.S. attorney in San Diego.
