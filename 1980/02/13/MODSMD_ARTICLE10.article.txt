## Oman, Somalia and Kenya tentatively agree U.S. gains access to foreign bases 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) —
Oman. Kenya and Somalia have
tentatively agreed to grant
American air and naval forces
increased access to their military
facilities, U.S. officials say.
The agreements were worked
out as part of a long-range
American plan to bolster the
U.S. military presence in the
politically turbulent Persian
Gulf-Indian Ocean area.
The U.S. officials, who asked
not to be identified, said the ag
reements will allow the United

States to store fuels and military
equipment in the three countries
for use by American forces in a
military emergency.
Of the three countries. Oman
is regarded as the most impor
tant because of its strategic loca
tion at the narrow entrance to
the Persian Gulf.
The United States agreed to
increase military aid to each
country, although the amounts
have not been specified.
Talks with the three countries
have been under wav for months.

The tentative agreements were
reached last week during a
negotiating mission headed by
Reginald Bartholomew, head of
the State Department's
political-military affairs bureau.
Bartholomew, who also visited
Saudi Arabia, is to return to
Washington this week.
Asked about the reports
Monday night. Defense Secret
ary Harold Brown had no com
ment except to say he was op
timistic the United States would
be able to enlist the cooperation

of Oman, Somalia and Kenya.
Details of the agreements were
sketchy, hut it was learned the
United States plans to build new
facilities in Oman, including oil
storage tanks.
On Monday, U.S. officials
confirmed tha Kenyan President
Daniel Arap Moi plans to meet
with President Jimmy Carter
soon to discuss U.S. proposals
for closer American military ties
with that East African country.
As for Somalia, some U.S. of
ficials have urged extreme cau
tion about a close U.S. military
relationship with that country.
These officials are fearful that,
without proper safeguards,
Somalia may be tempted to
renew its efforts to seize the dis
puted Ogaden region from
neighboring Ethiopia.
