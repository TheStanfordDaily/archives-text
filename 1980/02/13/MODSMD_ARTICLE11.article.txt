# Drivers abroad pay more for gas
## 
### Associated Press 
The next time you pump
.20-a-gallon gasoline into
>our car — and think longingly
back to last year when it was half
as much — consider the poor
motorists in othercountries. You
could have it worse.
You could be driving in Bul
garia. where the price of a gallon
of regular gasoline doubled to
$4.32 last year, or in Italy, where
a gallon of high-test would set
you back $3.02, up 71 cents in a
year.
An Associated Press world
wide survey, conducted in late
January, found that gasoline
prices in most countries jumped
as the world price of crude oil
doubled to nearly $30 a barrel
over the past year.
In Hong Kong, gasoline
climbed to $1.72 from $1.12,
prompting one wealthy factory
owner to forsake his luxury
Mercedes-Benz and Continental
cars for a compact Honda.
Israeli schoolteacher Shlomo
Eidan said a 53 percent increase
in gasoline prices over the past
year has meant "there's no way I
can afford to drive my car to
work instead of taking the bus"
for his daily 24-mile round-trip
commute.
In Denmark, bus use in met
ropolitan Copenhagen jumped
10 percent as the price of a gallon
of gasoline climbed to $2.55
from $1.45 a year ago. Even in
oil-rich Britain, gasoline now
costs $2.34 a gallon, up from
$ 1.64 a year ago.
A survey by the Greater Lon
don Council said the price rise
apparently has spurred a drop in

the number of cars entering the
British capital, a 2 percent
weekday decline and 4 percent
on weekends.
'Once a month*
"We might use the car once a
month over the weekends now."
a British housewife told the AP.
"A year ago, it was every
weekend, and now I think twice
about driving to the supermarket
in London on weekdays."
In Italy, however, gasoline
consumption climbed 8 per
cent from the 1978 level despite
the price increases. U.S. gasoline
use fell 5 percent in the same
period.
The average price of a gallon
of regular gasoline at a full
service U.S. station was $1.13 in
January, up from 68.42 cents a
year before, according to the
Lutidberg Letter, a publication
that covers the industry.
In many areas, prices are ex
pected to continue to climb as
the new Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
price boosts that hit in late
January and early February
work their way down to the
pump.
Poor nations hurt
Those increases will hurt
poorer countries especially. In
Kenya, where the World Bank
estimates annual per-capita in
come at $270. the price of a gal
lon of premium gasoline has
risen to $2.16 a gallon from
$1.57 at the end of 1978.
But motorists aren't paying
more everywhere. Big cars clog
streets and highways in Ven
ezuela. OPEC's fourth-largest
member, where the price of

premium has remained at just
30.8 cents a gallon over the past
year.
In Mexico, another major
producer, the state oil monopoly
has frozen the price of gasoline at
46 cents a gallon for regular and
65.4 cents for premium since
November 1976.
Canada prices low
And in Canada, where con
trolled domestic crude oil prices
are 60 percent below the world
level, drivers pay 81 cents a gal
lon for regular gasoline, up from
71 cents a year before.
In many countries, high
gasoline prices are due not only
to rising crude oil prices but to
high taxes as well.
Taxes made up 53 percent of
the price of gasoline in Belgium,
where a gallon of premium fuel
now sells for $3.1 1 — up from
$2.37 a year ago — but motorists
there don't seem to be deterred
by the price increase or the high
tax.
85 cent tax
Japan's government said the
average price of a gallon of
gasoline, including an 85
cents-a-gallon tax, has risen to
$2.13-$2.45 from $1.42-$1.85 a
year earlier. American taxes, by
contrast, average only 14 cents a
gallon, newsletter publisher Dan
Lundberg estimates.
Italian taxes account for 64
percent of the country's $3.02-
a-gallon price, while Portuguese
drivers were paying a 73 percent
tuel tax as their oil import
dependent nation's premium
gasoline price climbed to $2.95 a
gallon from $2.49 a year ago.
