# Political struggle plagues Guatemala's government
## 
### Terri Shaw The Washington Post 
GUATEMALA CITY — Carlos was one of six
boysfrom his village in the mountains of northwest
Guatemala who left their homes together a few
years ago to attend a boarding school for promising
Indian children.
Today Carlos, 19, is continuing his studies in
Guatemala City, but his five friends have gone
back to the mountains of Quiche Province to join
the leftist guerrillas.
"They told me they might as well go to the moun
tains," Carlos said. "They were afraid that if they
tried to help their people have a better life they
would be dragged out of their homes in the middle
of the night."
The fears were not imaginary. In the decade
between 1966 and 1976. more than 20,000 people
were murdered in political violence here, accord
ing to Amnesty International.
At least 2000 more have died since May 1978,
according to a recent report from the prestigious
London-based human rights group.
Although Amnesty did not directly accuse the
government of President Romeo Lucas Garcia of
complicity in the murders, it noted in the report
that most of the victims were allied with perceived
opponents of the military government and "in no
case of which Amnesty is aware has a killing been
fully investigated and its perpetrators brought to
justice."
Secret police
In Carlos' village of Chajul during the past three
years, several Indians have been taken from their
homes by armed men thought to be secret police.
Three members of one family, all connected with
the opposition Christian Democratic Party, have
never reappeared and are presumed dead.
"In the boarding school in Chichicastenango we
were taught to seek peace without using arms,"
Carlos said. "But lean understand why my friends
want to fight. There seems to be no other way."
Carlos, a serious and polite young man who sup
ports the Christian Democratic Party, said he dis
agrees with his friends' decision because "the
Guerrilla Army of the Poor and the Rebel Armed
Forces, the two main guerrilla groups, have much
of communism." He hopes to return to his village
next year, but fears that anyone who "demands
justice and a salary worthy of his work" will be
killed.
Reform needed
Carlos' dilemma illustrates the essential problem
facing Guatemala. Following a leftist revolution in
Nicaragua and violent political conflict in El Sal
vador, leaders of this key Central American coun
try acknowledge a need for social and economic
reforms.
After prodding from the United States, which
hopes to avoid more revolutions in the strategic
Caribbean Basin. Lucas' government is undertak
ing some modest programs to improve the lives of
the large majority of the population who live in
poverty.

Three years after U.S. military aid was sus
pended because of human rights violations here,
the U.S. embassy has suggested a resumption of
some training and sale of spare parts for military
helicopters in an effort to increase U.S. influence
with the ruling military.
But the government's efforts at political and
economic reforms are consistently blocked by
political violence from both left and right. Rela
tively small bands of leftist guerrillas have operated
in the country off and on since the mid '60s, haras
sing government troops and killing or holding for
ransom rich Guatemalans accused of exploiting the
poor.
Reaction
In reaction to the guerrilla activity, thousands of
peasants, labor leaders and left-of-center politi
cians have been killed, apparently by rightist
groups connected to the police and military. It was
this violence on which Amnesty and other human
rights groups have focused.
The government and the powerful business
community, already nervous about the impact of El
Salvador and Nicaragua here, react angrily to such
publicity about political violence.
A government crackdown on rightist paramilit
ary groups would bring a strong political reaction.
The largest delegation on Guatemala's 61-member
congress is composed of deputies from the Na
tional Liberation Movement (MLN), a strong
rightist party led by former Vice President Mario
Sandoval Alarcon. The MLN controlled the gov
ernment until last year, when Lucas formed a cen
trist coalition that soon collapsed under the weight
of the military.
An example of the difficulties of carrying out
reforms is the experience of Vice President Fran
cisco Villagran Kramer, a tall, courtly liberal intel
lectual who ran with Lucas in hope of creating
some "political and social flexibility" in Guatema
lan politics through the ill-fated coalition.
In an interview at his heavily guarded home,
Villagran said he had agreed to run with Lucas in
1 978 in return for a promise that certain social and
political changes would be made. None has been
carried out, he said.
One change was the legalization of new political
parties — two on the right and two on the left.
Leftists killed
The leftist parties were registered, "but their
leaders were killed," he said with an ironic laugh.
Alberto Fuentes Mohr of the Democratic Socialist
Party was machine-gunned in a residential area
near the U.S. Embassy on Jan. 25, 1979, and Man
uel Colom Argueta of the United Front of the
Revolution was shot to death on a downtown street
March 22.
Villagran said he also was promised freedom for
unions to organize, the strengthening of Indian
communities and guarantees for their land, a more
"nationalist" policy on exploitation of natural re
sources and a system of "popular participation" ir
government.

the leftist guerrillas.
"They told me they might as well go to the moun
tains," Carlos said. "They were afraid that if they
tried to help their people have a better life they
would be dragged out of their homes in the middle
of the night."
The fears were not imaginary. In the decade
between 1966 and 1976. more than 20,000 people
were murdered in political violence here, accord
ing to Amnesty International.
At least 2000 more have died since May 1978,
according to a recent report from the prestigious
London-based human rights group.
Although Amnesty did not directly accuse the
government of President Romeo Lucas Garcia of
complicity in the murders, it noted in the report
that most of the victims were allied with perceived
opponents of the military government and "in no
case of which Amnesty is aware has a killing been
fully investigated and its perpetrators brought to
justice."
Secret police
In Carlos' village of Chajul during the past three
years, several Indians have been taken from their
homes by armed men thought to be secret police.
Three members of one family, all connected with
the opposition Christian Democratic Party, have
never reappeared and are presumed dead.
"In the boarding school in Chichicastenango we
were taught to seek peace without using arms,"
Carlos said. "But lean understand why my friends
want to fight. There seems to be no other way."
Carlos, a serious and polite young man who sup
ports the Christian Democratic Party, said he dis
agrees with his friends' decision because "the
Guerrilla Army of the Poor and the Rebel Armed
Forces, the two main guerrilla groups, have much
of communism." He hopes to return to his village
next year, but fears that anyone who "demands
justice and a salary worthy of his work" will be
killed.
Reform needed
Carlos' dilemma illustrates the essential problem
facing Guatemala. Following a leftist revolution in
Nicaragua and violent political conflict in El Sal
vador, leaders of this key Central American coun
try acknowledge a need for social and economic
reforms.
After prodding from the United States, which
hopes to avoid more revolutions in the strategic
Caribbean Basin. Lucas' government is undertak
ing some modest programs to improve the lives of
the large majority of the population who live in
poverty.

Three years after U.S. military aid was sus
pended because of human rights violations here,
the U.S. embassy has suggested a resumption of
some training and sale of spare parts for military
helicopters in an effort to increase U.S. influence
with the ruling military.
But the government's efforts at political and
economic reforms are consistently blocked by
political violence from both left and right. Rela
tively small bands of leftist guerrillas have operated
in the country off and on since the mid '60s, haras
sing government troops and killing or holding for
ransom rich Guatemalans accused of exploiting the
poor.
Reaction
In reaction to the guerrilla activity, thousands of
peasants, labor leaders and left-of-center politi
cians have been killed, apparently by rightist
groups connected to the police and military. It was
this violence on which Amnesty and other human
rights groups have focused.
The government and the powerful business
community, already nervous about the impact of El
Salvador and Nicaragua here, react angrily to such
publicity about political violence.
A government crackdown on rightist paramilit
ary groups would bring a strong political reaction.
The largest delegation on Guatemala's 61-member
congress is composed of deputies from the Na
tional Liberation Movement (MLN), a strong
rightist party led by former Vice President Mario
Sandoval Alarcon. The MLN controlled the gov
ernment until last year, when Lucas formed a cen
trist coalition that soon collapsed under the weight
of the military.
An example of the difficulties of carrying out
reforms is the experience of Vice President Fran
cisco Villagran Kramer, a tall, courtly liberal intel
lectual who ran with Lucas in hope of creating
some "political and social flexibility" in Guatema
lan politics through the ill-fated coalition.
In an interview at his heavily guarded home,
Villagran said he had agreed to run with Lucas in
1 978 in return for a promise that certain social and
political changes would be made. None has been
carried out, he said.
One change was the legalization of new political
parties — two on the right and two on the left.
Leftists killed
The leftist parties were registered, "but their
leaders were killed," he said with an ironic laugh.
Alberto Fuentes Mohr of the Democratic Socialist
Party was machine-gunned in a residential area
near the U.S. Embassy on Jan. 25, 1979, and Man
uel Colom Argueta of the United Front of the
Revolution was shot to death on a downtown street
March 22.
Villagran said he also was promised freedom for
unions to organize, the strengthening of Indian
communities and guarantees for their land, a more
"nationalist" policy on exploitation of natural re
sources and a system of "popular participation" ir
government.
GUATEMALA CITY — Carlos was one of six
boysfrom his village in the mountains of northwest
Guatemala who left their homes together a few

Indian children.
