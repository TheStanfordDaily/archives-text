# Kidney transplant raises furor in Israel
## 
### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
JERUSALEM — The kidney of an Israeli
soldier killed by the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization is now functioning in the body of
an Arab girl who backs the PLO, to the dis
tress of some Jewish religious leaders here.
When Jehoshua Sloma died Jan. 31 of bul
let wounds in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospi
tal. doctors immediately ran tests to see
which of the scores of persons waiting for
kidney transplants there had blood and tissue
types closest to Sloma's.
A Jewish man from Beersheba afid a 12-
year-old girl from Nablus, an Arab city on
the Israeli Occupied West Bank of the Jor
dan River, were selected as recipients of the
soldier's kidneys. The young woman's poli
tics were unknown.
A spokesman for Hadassah, the hospital of
Hebrew University here said: "It would not
have mattered. Patients are patients. Politics
are irrelevant."
Orthodox opposition
But in this case politics have assumed a
major role. The more strictly Orthodox re
ligious groups in Israel are using the fact that
the kidney went to an anti-Israeli Arab to
dramatize their opposition to autopsies and
removal of any organs from a dead body.
Posters have appeared on the walls of re
ligious neighborhoods proclaiming:
"Jehoshua Sloma was wounded in Hebron
but was murdered in Jerusalem." (Sloma, 23,
was shot in the West Bank city of Hebrort and
pronounced dead at the Hadassah Hospi

tal.)
Rabbi Menachem Porush, the ranking
member of the Agudat Israel religious party
in the Knesset (parliament) brought the mat
ter to the Knesset last week and will debate it
there Tuesday. Porush said Monday that the
key issue was religious law, but added:
"It is difficult to understand that they
would put this kidney in someone who hates
Jews — who said, "We must drive the Jews
away from here."
Ban demanded
The religious factions are demanding that
autopsies be banned in cases where the fam
ily does not approve. They also want removal
of organs for transplants to be covered by the
same rules.
"This would mean the stroke of death to
transplants in Israel," said Dr. Arie Drost,
head of surgery at Hadassah, who performed
the operation that transplanted Sloma's kid
neys.
Medical experts explained that kidneys
must be transplanted within two hours of the
donor's death. Under present rules, three
doctors must approve such a transplant when
the family is not known or reachable.
Sloma's identity was not known when he
was brought to the hospital. He was dressed
in civilian clothes, he had been in a combina
tion of religious study and army service.
Rabbi Porush said.
"We know from the fact that he was study
ing at the yeshiva (religious school) that he
was a religious person. No doubt he would

have opposed this transplant."
Exploitation?
His family, which is from Denmark, came
here for the funeral and left without voicing
any opposition to the transplant operation.
Medical men said a small religious group was
trying to exploit the case for political reasons.
Those who oppose transplants, they said,
represent a small group even among the re
ligious population.
Agudat Israel represents about four per
cent of Israel's Jewish population, of whom
about 20 percent are strictly observant Or
thodox Jews. Agudat Israel has only four
seats in the 120 seat Knesset, but the gov
ernment of Prime Minister Menachem Begin
backed its demands for changes in the abor
tion law earlier this year. Begin acted after
the Agudat Israel members threatened to
quit his coalition if the changes were not
made. Begin, with a slim majority of about
65 seats, needs Agudat's support.
Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren and
many other religious figures disagreed with
Agudat Israel on the Sloma case. Goren said
that the performance of a life-giving trans
plant is a mitzvah — a meritorious deed —
whether the recipient is a Jew or an Arab.
Sources in Jerusalem said that the reci
pient of the kidney is named Amira, a
member of a family at a camp near Nablus for
refugees displaced from homes inside what is
now Israel by the warsof 1948and 1973. She
had been coming twice weekly for dialysis
treatment at Jerusalem'sShaare Zedek Hos
pital.

but was murdered in Jerusalem." (Sloma, 23,
was shot in the West Bank city of Hebrort and
pronounced dead at the Hadassah Hospi

tal.)
Rabbi Menachem Porush, the ranking
member of the Agudat Israel religious party
in the Knesset (parliament) brought the mat
ter to the Knesset last week and will debate it
there Tuesday. Porush said Monday that the
key issue was religious law, but added:
"It is difficult to understand that they
would put this kidney in someone who hates
Jews — who said, "We must drive the Jews
away from here."
Ban demanded
The religious factions are demanding that
autopsies be banned in cases where the fam
ily does not approve. They also want removal
of organs for transplants to be covered by the
same rules.
"This would mean the stroke of death to
transplants in Israel," said Dr. Arie Drost,
head of surgery at Hadassah, who performed
the operation that transplanted Sloma's kid
neys.
Medical experts explained that kidneys
must be transplanted within two hours of the
donor's death. Under present rules, three
doctors must approve such a transplant when
the family is not known or reachable.
Sloma's identity was not known when he
was brought to the hospital. He was dressed
in civilian clothes, he had been in a combina
tion of religious study and army service.
Rabbi Porush said.
"We know from the fact that he was study
ing at the yeshiva (religious school) that he
was a religious person. No doubt he would

have opposed this transplant."
Exploitation?
His family, which is from Denmark, came
here for the funeral and left without voicing
any opposition to the transplant operation.
Medical men said a small religious group was
trying to exploit the case for political reasons.
Those who oppose transplants, they said,
represent a small group even among the re
ligious population.
Agudat Israel represents about four per
cent of Israel's Jewish population, of whom
about 20 percent are strictly observant Or
thodox Jews. Agudat Israel has only four
seats in the 120 seat Knesset, but the gov
ernment of Prime Minister Menachem Begin
backed its demands for changes in the abor
tion law earlier this year. Begin acted after
the Agudat Israel members threatened to
quit his coalition if the changes were not
made. Begin, with a slim majority of about
65 seats, needs Agudat's support.
Israeli Chief Rabbi Shlomo Goren and
many other religious figures disagreed with
Agudat Israel on the Sloma case. Goren said
that the performance of a life-giving trans
plant is a mitzvah — a meritorious deed —
whether the recipient is a Jew or an Arab.
Sources in Jerusalem said that the reci
pient of the kidney is named Amira, a
member of a family at a camp near Nablus for
refugees displaced from homes inside what is
now Israel by the warsof 1948and 1973. She
had been coming twice weekly for dialysis
treatment at Jerusalem'sShaare Zedek Hos
pital.
JERUSALEM — The kidney of an Israeli
soldier killed by the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization is now functioning in the body of
an Arab girl who backs the PLO, to the dis
tress of some Jewish religious leaders here.
When Jehoshua Sloma died Jan. 31 of bul
let wounds in Jerusalem's Hadassah Hospi
tal. doctors immediately ran tests to see
which of the scores of persons waiting for
kidney transplants there had blood and tissue
types closest to Sloma's.
A Jewish man from Beersheba afid a 12-
year-old girl from Nablus, an Arab city on
the Israeli Occupied West Bank of the Jor
dan River, were selected as recipients of the
soldier's kidneys. The young woman's poli
tics were unknown.
A spokesman for Hadassah, the hospital of
Hebrew University here said: "It would not
have mattered. Patients are patients. Politics
are irrelevant."
Orthodox opposition
But in this case politics have assumed a
major role. The more strictly Orthodox re
ligious groups in Israel are using the fact that
the kidney went to an anti-Israeli Arab to
dramatize their opposition to autopsies and
removal of any organs from a dead body.
Posters have appeared on the walls of re
ligious neighborhoods proclaiming:
"Jehoshua Sloma was wounded in Hebron
but was murdered in Jerusalem." (Sloma, 23,
was shot in the West Bank city of Hebrort and
pronounced dead at the Hadassah Hospi

tal.)
