# Professors re-emerge as spokesmen of political resistance

It was like a scene from the
19605.
0.. Jan. 2K History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein told listeners at an
anti-conscription rally in White
Plaza, "It's time once more to
think about resisting."
Did Bernstein's appearance at
the rally and his call for resis
tance represent the first in a gen
eral political re-mobilization of
professors on the draft issue, or
was it simply an isolated, indi
vidual move?
Bernstein's belief that 10 or 15
other professors here would
have offered similar views is
closer to the first interpretation.
He said that the "magnitude and
persistence" of professors' re
mobilization is tied to general
public perception of world
events.
" If the Administration persists
with its present policy, insisting
upon registration as a likely pre
liminary to the draft, and suc
ceeds in Congress, mobilization
will probably continue," he pre
dicted.
Psychology Prof, and Faculty
Senate chairman Albert Hastorf
said that mobilization doesn't
exist here.
He said he does not believe

"there is any clarity of opinion"
among faculty on the conscrip
tion issue, and that the profes
sors active now are the ones who
are active on any issue.
Hence, their mobilization
does not signal a general trend,
he said.
Small minority
French Prof. Robert Cohn
said the active professors com
prise only a small minority of the
professors here and described
them as tending to be "neither
interested very much in their
professions nor in long-range
creativity.
" These people bide their time
and when the times are ripe for
them, propitious, they come out
swinging, you know, strike their
blows."
This group probably won't in
crease in numbers here at the
University because sentiment for
conscription is too strong, he
said.
Cohn favors draft registration.
He also said more professors
won't get involved because they
are either contemplative scho
lars — "creative types who tend
to see things from a long range
perspective" — or "professional
men above all" who don't usu
ally become involved in political
issues because they are "so
wrapped up in their own profes

sions.
Broader arena
Assoc. History Prof. Harold
Kahn said that more professors
here have remained politicized
than first appears because many
have "taken action and
mobilized outside of the Stan
ford community."
The arena in which these pro
fessors operate encompasses and
transcends University bound
aries, he said.
Pear of reprisal
There is a reasonable fear
among professors, especially
junior faculty members, of tak

ing an unpopular position on
political issues, Kahn said.
Under the guise of ostensibly
academic decisions, the ad
ministration can use tenure,
promotions and pay as levers on
a junior faculty member who
makes "rash statements," he
said.
Hastorf disagreed with this
and said it is possible to "speak
unpopular opinions and not lose
respect." He said he has never
"heard even allusion" to a ques
tion in regard to a person's polit
ical stance during discussions of
tenure or promotion.

"I don't think that in any way
it consciously occurs, but it cer
tainly could conceivably occur in
the mind of a junior faculty
member," he said.
Bernstein agreed that the
moves were probably uninten
tional, but said that if somebody
performs what prevailing values
deem to be an "irresponsible
act," "irresponsible people" will
not be allowed to reap any re
wards.
" There is a profound ideologi
cal definition of irresponsibility
and under most circumstances
the people who make that
judgment made it so comforta
bly, they don't view it as ideolog
ical, but rather simply as self
evident," he said.

Why then do professors ad
dress political issues? Kahn said
that "professors have an abso
lute responsibility" to answer
students' calls for political dis
cussion, "in the classroom as
well, even if their subject is not
contemporary world politics."
Bernstein also said that profes
sors have a duty as citizens, as
intellectuals and because a stu
dent request is made.
Hastorf said that while the
"avoidance of holding public
discussion and debate" never
pays off, "professors are citizens
and have the obligations of citi
zens." Thus, "I don't feel that
everyone has an obligation to
make their opinions public."
Bernstein also stressed the no

tion that professors are not very
different than people in general.
As he said, professors "are re
flective of and responsive to"
events. They "do not have the
initiative, and probably for the
most part do not seek the initia
tive."
Professors are followers
According to Kahn, "Most
people, including most profes
sors, are followers, not leaders,"
lor "the professor is no more,
and no less, self-conscious and
set in her or his groove than any
other individual in this Univer
sity community." He em
phasized. "professors usually do
follow and when . . . the students
mobilize for something they
draw their professors out, and
damn well ouuht to."

0.. Jan. 2K History Prof. Bar
ton Bernstein told listeners at an
anti-conscription rally in White
Plaza, "It's time once more to
think about resisting."
Did Bernstein's appearance at
the rally and his call for resis
tance represent the first in a gen
eral political re-mobilization of
professors on the draft issue, or
was it simply an isolated, indi
vidual move?
Bernstein's belief that 10 or 15
other professors here would
have offered similar views is
closer to the first interpretation.
He said that the "magnitude and
persistence" of professors' re
mobilization is tied to general
public perception of world
events.
" If the Administration persists
with its present policy, insisting
upon registration as a likely pre
liminary to the draft, and suc
ceeds in Congress, mobilization
will probably continue," he pre
dicted.
Psychology Prof, and Faculty
Senate chairman Albert Hastorf
said that mobilization doesn't
exist here.
He said he does not believe

"there is any clarity of opinion"
among faculty on the conscrip
tion issue, and that the profes
sors active now are the ones who
are active on any issue.
Hence, their mobilization
does not signal a general trend,
he said.
Small minority
French Prof. Robert Cohn
said the active professors com
prise only a small minority of the
professors here and described
them as tending to be "neither
interested very much in their
professions nor in long-range
creativity.
" These people bide their time
and when the times are ripe for
them, propitious, they come out
swinging, you know, strike their
blows."
This group probably won't in
crease in numbers here at the
University because sentiment for
conscription is too strong, he
said.
Cohn favors draft registration.
He also said more professors
won't get involved because they
are either contemplative scho
lars — "creative types who tend
to see things from a long range
perspective" — or "professional
men above all" who don't usu
ally become involved in political
issues because they are "so
wrapped up in their own profes

sions.
Broader arena
Assoc. History Prof. Harold
Kahn said that more professors
here have remained politicized
than first appears because many
have "taken action and
mobilized outside of the Stan
ford community."
The arena in which these pro
fessors operate encompasses and
transcends University bound
aries, he said.
Pear of reprisal
There is a reasonable fear
among professors, especially
junior faculty members, of tak

ing an unpopular position on
political issues, Kahn said.
Under the guise of ostensibly
academic decisions, the ad
ministration can use tenure,
promotions and pay as levers on
a junior faculty member who
makes "rash statements," he
said.
Hastorf disagreed with this
and said it is possible to "speak
unpopular opinions and not lose
respect." He said he has never
"heard even allusion" to a ques
tion in regard to a person's polit
ical stance during discussions of
tenure or promotion.

"I don't think that in any way
it consciously occurs, but it cer
tainly could conceivably occur in
the mind of a junior faculty
member," he said.
Bernstein agreed that the
moves were probably uninten
tional, but said that if somebody
performs what prevailing values
deem to be an "irresponsible
act," "irresponsible people" will
not be allowed to reap any re
wards.
" There is a profound ideologi
cal definition of irresponsibility
and under most circumstances
the people who make that
judgment made it so comforta
bly, they don't view it as ideolog
ical, but rather simply as self
evident," he said.

Why then do professors ad
dress political issues? Kahn said
that "professors have an abso
lute responsibility" to answer
students' calls for political dis
cussion, "in the classroom as
well, even if their subject is not
contemporary world politics."
Bernstein also said that profes
sors have a duty as citizens, as
intellectuals and because a stu
dent request is made.
Hastorf said that while the
"avoidance of holding public
discussion and debate" never
pays off, "professors are citizens
and have the obligations of citi
zens." Thus, "I don't feel that
everyone has an obligation to
make their opinions public."
Bernstein also stressed the no

tion that professors are not very
different than people in general.
As he said, professors "are re
flective of and responsive to"
events. They "do not have the
initiative, and probably for the
most part do not seek the initia
tive."
Professors are followers
According to Kahn, "Most
people, including most profes
sors, are followers, not leaders,"
lor "the professor is no more,
and no less, self-conscious and
set in her or his groove than any
other individual in this Univer
sity community." He em
phasized. "professors usually do
follow and when . . . the students
mobilize for something they
draw their professors out, and
damn well ouuht to."
