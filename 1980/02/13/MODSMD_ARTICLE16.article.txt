# 'We never print nudity to titillate'
## Lampoon creator a master satirist 
### Andrea James News Editor 
If I'd ever tried to picture in
my mind the creator of National
Lampoon and Animal House, I
would have seen a long-haired,
joint-smoking 40-year-old try
ing to look 20. He would have
been wearing dark sunglasses
and Army fatigues, and telling
raunchy jokes with obscenities in
every sentence.
I would have been dead
wrong.
Substitute the dark sunglasses

for steel-rimmed specs, the joint
for a cigar, the long hair for a
conservative businessman's cut
and the army fatigues for a classy
suit.
You can keep in the raunchy
jokes and obscenities.
Matty Simmons' life is the
dream of every striving business
student. He started out as a
co-partner in the Diners Club,
the first major credit card firm,
and with an initial investment of
only $ IS,OOO he found himself
10 years later with a $ 100 million
company.
He got bored with the organi
zation after 1 7 years and started
over with a new venture — 21st
Century Communications, Inc.
He and his partner invested
$50,000 into the company's first
project — Weight Watchers
Magazine - and when 50 percent
of the company's interest in the
magazine was sold to Weight
Watchers International, the
company got $1.9 million.
Then came National Lam
poon, that bawdy humor
magazine that's now celebrating
its 10th anniversary with a $2
special issue that features mas
turbating women and four pages

of full-color nudes with trash
cans on their heads.
It's quite a change from the
100-year-old Harvard Lam
poon, the Ivy League school's
campus humor magazine that
became nationally known during
the 1960s with its parodies of
Time, Life, Playboy and Cos-»
mopoliian.
In 1970. Simmons, Len Mogel
and three Harvard under
graduates joined forces to make
that magazine what it is today —
an irreverant adult humor publi
cation. The average age of its
readership jumped from 19 to
24.
"National Lampoon is not
light-hearted, frivolous com
edy," Simmons said. "It's real
life. It gets to the guts of things."
There are messages tucked
away behind the sick humor. The
magazine's editors, most of
whom are 40 or older, use satire
and parody to criticize, with a
good example being Baby's First
Wound, recently reprinted in the
National Lampoon Anthology.
"That had a strong message,"
Simmons said. "We were trying
to say that we were killing babies
in Vietnam. It was humorous, it
was sad, it was a comment on
current events."
The same was true with the
pop-up of Nixon that ran during
the Watergate years. Nixon's
nose came flying out of the
magazine, transforming the pres
ident into Pinocchio.
Despite its jabs at politicians
and nationally-known figures.
National Lampoon has never
lost a libel suit. That's quite a
record, considering that more
than $100 million in libel suits
have been filed against it.
And the magazine doesn't
stop at public figures. It pokes
fun at the blind, at ethnic groups
and at anything else that might
lend itself to comedy.

But Simmons said that no one
is offended.
"Blind people used to listen to
the blind jokes and love them."
he said, referring to lines in the
"National Lampoon Radio
Hour," which ended in 1975,
and in National Lampoon's vari
ous movie and stage produc
tions.
Even the nudity has its pur
pose.
"We print it to make fun, to
poke fun, to get laughs," Sim
mons said, looking at the nude
spreads in the 10th anniversary
issues. "We never print nudity to
titillate."
Simmons produced Animal
House, the comedy on college
life that grossed over $160 mill
ion. making it the biggest com
edy hit in years.
Animal House was written for
the express purpose of enter
tainment," Simmons said. "It's

whole goal was to make people
laugh. We weren't trying to de
liver a message there."
Animal House won't be the
end of Simmons' movie
producing career. National
Lampoon's Kicks is scheduled to
begin shooting this spring, and
the company is also working on
Georgia Baby, a comedy drama
that occasionally steps out of
raucous humor into heavy, emo
tional moments — a new twist
for Lampooners.
The humor is spreading fast —
from the magazine and onto the
film and stage. But as long as the
humor remains fresh, Simmons
isn't worried.
"We never repeat ourselves,"
he said. "We're very careful
about that."
And because of this, he's not
afraid that Lampoon humor will
oversaturate the market.
