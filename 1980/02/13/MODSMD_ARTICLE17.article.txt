# Candidates declared healthy

WASHINGTON â€” Most of the 1980 presiden
tial candidates have been declared in "excellent"
health by their doctors, despite a variety of aches,
pains and problems that afflict many men in their
mature years.
But Sen. Howard Baker Jr. (R-Tenn.) has had
"several" recent health problems, including a heart
valve defect that does not keep him from playing
tennis or climbing stairs. Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.,)
has shown some evidence on an electrocardiogram
of a possible 1977 heart incident that does not keep
him from jogging. His latest electrocardiogram
showed no heart disease.
And Republican Ronald Reagan, at 69 the old
est candidate, was declared by his physician. Dr.
James Reynolds of Los Angeles to be in "remarka
bly good physical condition" with no major prob
lems, only an arthritic right thumb. Reagan passed
a stress test of heart action that was given on a
treadmill.

All these reports are part of a summary of candi
dates' health in Medical World News, a McGraw-
Hill magazine for doctors. Writer Mark Bloom
succeeded in getting a recent medical report from
every candidate but California Democratic Gov.
Jerry Brown.
"By far the sketchiest" report. Bloom said, was
President Jimmy Carter's. His doctor only re
peated a January verdict that the president remains
"in excellent health," though, like many other jog
gers. he suffers occasional shin splints or leg pains.
But Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), who
made his report public in November, was declared
in "superior physical condition" despite "minor
residual effects," left by a I 964 airplane crash. Last
June, he hud a tiny skin cancer, of a kind that
usually responds fully to treatment, removed from
his chest.
Republican George Bush was declared an "ac
tive healthy person," though he had an ulcer in
1960 that recurred in 1966 and then healed.
