WASHINGTON — Top
campaign aides to President
Jimmy Carter and Sen. Edward
Kennedy took a look back at
Sunday's Maine caucuses and
found somethng they could
agree on: Both sides said CBS
news was "irresponsible" to pre
dict a big Carter win hours be
fore the caucuses were over.
Robert Strauss, Carter's cam
paign manager, and Paul Kirk,
Kennedy's chief political ad
viser, said Monday that a CBS
News Bulletin, broadcast Sun
day afternoon, undermined their
efforts to turn out supporters to
evening caucuses.
CBS interrupted a tennis
broadcast at 4:37 plm. (EST)
Sunday — when about a third of
the town caucuses had not yet
begun — toannounce that"Pres
ident Carter is the winner."
"CBS News estimates that
when the caucuses are com
pleted, President Carter will
have won just over half of (the
Maine) delegates," the report
said. "Second will be Senator
Kennedy with just over a third
. . . We repeat. President Carter
is the winner."
As it turned out. CBS esti
mated the final standings right,
but its projections of delegate fi
gures were wrong. Late Monday,
with about 90 percent of the
town caucuses reporting. Carter
had 45 percent of the delegates
and Kennedy 39 percent.
CBS repeated its estimate on

radio broadcasts late Sunday af
ternoon. By the time its evening
television news program was
broadcast in Maine at 6 p.m.
(EST), the network had updated
its estimate and said Carter
would win by about 10 percen
tage points.
What angered the Carter and
Kennedy people was not so
much the faulty projection of de
legate totals, but the fact that
CBS offered any projection at all
when a considerable portion of
the electorate had yet to vote.
"It's absolutely irresponsi
ble," said Kirk of the Kennedy
campaign. "You have over a
third of these people getting
ready to go out and vote and
CBS told them it was all over —
there was no point in voting be
cause Carter was going to win
big."
CBS News Vice President Er
nest Leiser, said the network
made its projection early to beat
the competition.
Noting that NBC had pre
dicted the results of last month's
lowa caucuses "a few minutes"
before CBS did, Leiser said of
the Maine projection: "Why did
we put it on? Why does The
Washington Post try to beat The
New York Times? . . . We're in a
competitive situation."
In fact, though, there was no
competitive pressure Sunday.
Both ABC and NBC decided not
to try to project results in Maine,
saying that the circumstances
were too unusual — Maine had
never before held statewide cau
cuses on the same day — to per
nit accurate estimates.
J The CBS projection was made
by the network's polling and
predicting expert. Warren

Mitofsky, who has a reputation
in the polling community as a
particularly cautious estimator
Mitofsky's most famous
achievement, until his Maine
prediction Sunday, was in the
Wisconsin primary in 1976,
when CBS refused to project a
result after other news organiza
tions had announced that Morris
Udall was the winner. In the end.
Udall lost narrowly to Carter.
The projection of winners
while voting is still under way has
been a subject of controversy
among pollsters for years.
Some students of polling and
politics say early projections
trigger a "lethargy factor" that
leads people who have not yet
voted to say "What's the use?"
and stay home. But others say
early polls have no such effect.
The Canadian government
was concerned sufficiently to es
tablish a federal statute prohibit
ing the broadcast of early results
or pollsters' projections before
the polls close. Thus, election re
sults from eastern provinces of
Canada cannot be reported in
the west until three hours later.
Leiser, the CBS News execu
tive. Monday professed no con
cern about the impact of his net
work's estimate in Maine.
"Early on, in 1960 or so when
(vote projections) were a new
thing, we spent a lot of time and
anguish worrying about that,"
Leiser said. "But we reached the
conclusion that if we had the in
formation we should go with it."
Leiser said his network had
confidence in Mitofsky's work
and would continue to estimate
election results on the basis of
early returns. "We feel we're
doing the right thing." he said.

(vote projections) were a new
thing, we spent a lot of time and
anguish worrying about that,"
Leiser said. "But we reached the
conclusion that if we had the in
formation we should go with it."
Leiser said his network had
confidence in Mitofsky's work
and would continue to estimate
election results on the basis of
early returns. "We feel we're
doing the right thing." he said.
WASHINGTON — Top
campaign aides to President
Jimmy Carter and Sen. Edward
Kennedy took a look back at
Sunday's Maine caucuses and
found somethng they could
agree on: Both sides said CBS
news was "irresponsible" to pre
dict a big Carter win hours be
fore the caucuses were over.
Robert Strauss, Carter's cam
paign manager, and Paul Kirk,
Kennedy's chief political ad
viser, said Monday that a CBS
News Bulletin, broadcast Sun
day afternoon, undermined their
efforts to turn out supporters to
evening caucuses.
CBS interrupted a tennis
broadcast at 4:37 plm. (EST)
Sunday — when about a third of
the town caucuses had not yet
begun — toannounce that"Pres
ident Carter is the winner."
"CBS News estimates that
when the caucuses are com
pleted, President Carter will
have won just over half of (the
Maine) delegates," the report
said. "Second will be Senator
Kennedy with just over a third
. . . We repeat. President Carter
is the winner."
As it turned out. CBS esti
mated the final standings right,
but its projections of delegate fi
gures were wrong. Late Monday,
with about 90 percent of the
town caucuses reporting. Carter
had 45 percent of the delegates
and Kennedy 39 percent.
CBS repeated its estimate on

radio broadcasts late Sunday af
ternoon. By the time its evening
television news program was
broadcast in Maine at 6 p.m.
(EST), the network had updated
its estimate and said Carter
would win by about 10 percen
tage points.
What angered the Carter and
Kennedy people was not so
much the faulty projection of de
legate totals, but the fact that
CBS offered any projection at all
when a considerable portion of
the electorate had yet to vote.
"It's absolutely irresponsi
ble," said Kirk of the Kennedy
campaign. "You have over a
third of these people getting
ready to go out and vote and
CBS told them it was all over —
there was no point in voting be
cause Carter was going to win
big."
CBS News Vice President Er
nest Leiser, said the network
made its projection early to beat
the competition.
Noting that NBC had pre
dicted the results of last month's
lowa caucuses "a few minutes"
before CBS did, Leiser said of
the Maine projection: "Why did
we put it on? Why does The
Washington Post try to beat The
New York Times? . . . We're in a
competitive situation."
In fact, though, there was no
competitive pressure Sunday.
Both ABC and NBC decided not
to try to project results in Maine,
saying that the circumstances
were too unusual — Maine had
never before held statewide cau
cuses on the same day — to per
nit accurate estimates.
J The CBS projection was made
by the network's polling and
predicting expert. Warren

Mitofsky, who has a reputation
in the polling community as a
particularly cautious estimator
Mitofsky's most famous
achievement, until his Maine
prediction Sunday, was in the
Wisconsin primary in 1976,
when CBS refused to project a
result after other news organiza
tions had announced that Morris
Udall was the winner. In the end.
Udall lost narrowly to Carter.
The projection of winners
while voting is still under way has
been a subject of controversy
among pollsters for years.
Some students of polling and
politics say early projections
trigger a "lethargy factor" that
leads people who have not yet
voted to say "What's the use?"
and stay home. But others say
early polls have no such effect.
The Canadian government
was concerned sufficiently to es
tablish a federal statute prohibit
ing the broadcast of early results
or pollsters' projections before
the polls close. Thus, election re
sults from eastern provinces of
Canada cannot be reported in
the west until three hours later.
Leiser, the CBS News execu
tive. Monday professed no con
cern about the impact of his net
work's estimate in Maine.
"Early on, in 1960 or so when
(vote projections) were a new
thing, we spent a lot of time and
anguish worrying about that,"
Leiser said. "But we reached the
conclusion that if we had the in
formation we should go with it."
Leiser said his network had
confidence in Mitofsky's work
