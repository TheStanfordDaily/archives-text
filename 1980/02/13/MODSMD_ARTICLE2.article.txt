# P.A. council mulls plan
## Building ban debated 
### Chris Mills Staff Writer 
A proposed six-month moratorium
on further industrial and commercial
development was considered last night
by the Palo Alto City Council at a spe
cial meeting held in the Council Cham
bers.
The final vote was not known at the
time the Daily went to press.
The moratorium would apply to
permit applications tor industrial
facilities of more than 25,000 square
feet and to commercial facilities of
more than 5000 square feet.
.University Vice President for Busi
ness and Finance William Massy told
the council that the University "sup
ports the idea that strong action should
be taken to deal with the job-housing
imbalance and long commuting dis
tances that characterize our area."
But a moratorium may be the wrong
approach to the problem, Massy ad
ded. While the University "probably
would not be affected in any significant
way" by the moratorium, he said, "we
do have some concerns for our leasees
in the Industrial Park."
Located just south of campus in Palo
Alto, the Stanford Industrial Park is a
large block of University land leased to
commercial interests.
Businesses there may suffer "serious
consequences" if they are unable to
complete planned expansions, Massy
said.
A staff report by the Palo Alto Plan
ning Commission said the emergency
moratorium was necessary to prevent
the Hood of building permit applica
tions that would probably be submitted
while the city amends its comprehen
sive plan to help alleviate the imba
lance in employment and housing
growth.
In January the Sunnyvale City
Council approved a similar
moratorium proposal. The ban will be
in effect until April 30, according to
Sunnyvale Planning Officer Edward
Moore.
The report revealed that new com
mercial and industrial construction in
Palo Alto increased from 304,000

square feet in 1978 to 864,000 square
feet in 1979. But the number of new
housing units dropped from 244 to 51.
In a report issued Jast November, the
Santa Clara County Industry and
Housing Task Force recommended a
moratorium on industrial building
permits if other efforts to alleviate the
imbalance failed.
"We have not made a significant
dent in those problems," County
Senior Planner Steve McKinney told
the council. As a result, Palo Alto now
has 27,000 housing units and 78,000
jobs, he said.
Addressing the council. Massy said
that University planners have been
thinking "solidly positive" on the
area's housing shortage.
