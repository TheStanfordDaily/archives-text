# Sign-up plan inequitable

In a recent editorial, the Daily stated
that the current instability in the Persian
Gulf demanded the rapid implementation
of long-overdue conservation measures.
We also said that registration is a viable
means for developing a strong back-up
support to shore up our currently in
adequate conventional forces.
A potential leadership crisis in Iran,
combined with the weakened status of both
Iranian and American conventional forces
could encourage further Soviet adventures
in the region. A cut-off of Persian Gulf oil
in such a situation would threaten not only
our economy, but cripple the economies of
Western Europe and Japan, which are
heavily dependent on oil from the region.
Reliance on a nuclear deterrent is not
really deterrence at all — it is more a
dangerous game in which we would have to
persuade a potential opponent that we are
irrational enough to cause the world's de
struction.
But President Jimmy Carter's proposal
to register only men and women born in
1960 and 1961 is both highly inequitable
and inadequate. We do. however, support
the president's call for registration of wo
men; to do otherwise treats women as un
equals. Yet in general, this needlessly
long-term proposal does not meet the
short-term problem of our inadequate
conventional forces.
And, more importantly, by trying to serve
his own political ends. Carter has come up
with a half-way measure that foolishly at
tempts to avoid placing the issue squarely
before the American people.
We suggest that the president go back to
the drawing board, and quickly.
Having proposed registration as a way to
beef up the conventional forces. Carter has
now clumsily attempted to defuse the im

pact of this polarizing issue by placing tne
burden on a group who in the past have
been notoriously inactive politically.
But this issue absolutely requires public
debate and a sharing of responsibility. If
the American people are not committed to
supporting the sovereignty of the nations in
the Persian Gulf, then a stronger conven
tional force and measures like registration
are not immediately necessary. But if the
American people are in fact committed to
the possible use of American power in the
region, then a viable conventional force
becomes necessary, because it is vital that
we avoid reliance on a nuclear deterrent.
If President Carter is in fact serious
*ibout developing a strong conventional de
terrent. then political ploys such as the cur
rent plan need to be scrapped in favor of
either an encompassing plan to strengthen
and increase the ranks of the volunteer
army or a registration proposal that both
more equitably shares responsibility and
places the question of a sizeable increase in
our military committment squarely before
the people.
Hard issues need to be confronted here.
Conservation must proceed swiftly, and al
ternative energy sources need to be de
veloped. And Americans must decide what
our role in the Persian Gulf should be.
But we have a president who. in his de
sire to get re-elected, has not proposed
tough conservation measures and who tells
the world that we'll fight aggression in the
Persian Gulf "with military force if neces
sary" and a week later admits that the cur
rent conventional forces are inadequate for
this task.
In short, this president seems ready to
blunder us into a "tactical nuclear war." a
worthless euphamism for holocaust.
