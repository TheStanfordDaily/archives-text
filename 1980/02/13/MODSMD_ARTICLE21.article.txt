The preceeding editorial fails to address the
major issues at hand in the debate over the
resumption of draft registration — is registra
tion the proper response to the current situa
tion? Why or why not?
Many arguments can be made against regist
ration. ranging from the pacifist to the moral to
the purely pragmatic.
First of all. a military response is not called for
in this situation. It is difficult to believe that the
United States could adequately fight a war
against a power with conventional forces at least
as strong as its own. several thousand miles from
home.
The intensely nationalistic Moslems of Iran
for example, would no more stand for a Soviet
invasion than for an American one. To invade
Iran, with its large area, its well-equipped
armed forces (that the United States providen
tially supplied to the shah) and its fanatically
anti-imperialistic population would be to sign
the death warrant of the invasionary forces.
The Soviets have rarely initiated a conflict
whose outcome was not certain to be in their
favor, and there is no reason to believe they
would open this can of worms for themselves.
Their hands are already too lull with Afghanis
tan; last weekend, the Afghan rebels took two
more towns back from the Soviets.
How should the United States reply to the
Soviet presence in Southwest Asia? We cannot
be expected to answer this question definitively
without a full. CIA-briefed picture of the situa
tion. But now is the time for sober diplomatic
maneuvering, not war hysteria. Let us not add
Tehran to the Alamo and the Maine as a list of
war causes we have to remember.
We are no more capable of successfully invad
ing the Persian Gulf than the Soviets are of
occupying Canada.
But acquiring a computerized listing of
people to draft should the ' need" arise would
only facilitate our entry into a conflict that none
of us wants — or needs.

A list of registrants is a symptom of willing
ness to reinstitute a draft and a readiness for the
draft is a readiness for war.
Some say. however, that we need to fight for
oil. The United States gets only 15 percent of its
oil from the Persian Gulf, according to the
White House. Should this oil be cut off. and
assuming we could not obtain more oil
elsewhere (though Nigeria. Venezuela, etc. are
also major exporters of crude oil) it is preferable
to shed our lifestyles than anyone's blood. Let
us register blow dryers, oil producers and com
panies that make tens of billions of dollars each
year before we register the nation's youth. And
let us ration gasoline to reduce consumption
before we ration the years a citizen of this coun
try may live.
Whate\er the reasons behind President
Jimmy Carter's call for registration — be they
an effort to bolster his re-election campaign, a
move toward strengthening the military
connected industries in this country, or anything
else — we need to express our strenuous opposi
tion to it as soon as possible and spread the will
to resist throughout the United States.
It is only by sending a message of opposition
to Carter that we will stem the tide of willingness
for a military confrontation in Southwest Asia
— a confrontation that is likely to lead to a tacti
cal" and then a full-scale nuclear war. This ap
peal against registration is an appeal to preserve
life on this planet.
The time for gunboat diplomacy and sabre
rattling is long past.
Carter's policy prolongs and intensities our
perception of a "crisis." Calls to "rally around
the flag" bolster Carter's poll ratings while they
keep us from objectively evaluating our foreign
policy. Carter's actions seem to preclude any
possibility for cooperation with the Soviet Un
ion. We cannot afford to forfeit this hope.
