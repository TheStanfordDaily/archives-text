## Column nonsense 
### 
Last Friday's shrill anti-draft
column by former Daily editors
was ridiculous, left much unsaid,
and unwittingly exposed a large
inconsistency in liberal thought.
The column was sprinkled
with nonsense. The authors im
plied that only "bloodthirsty"
Republicans see Russia in Af
ghanistan as the first step in the
eventual seizure of the Persian
Gulf. Apparently Carter would
qualify as such a Republican.
The authors go on to claim, in
defiance of all logic, that there is
"not a shred of evidence" in
favor of this worry. Rubbish.
Several recent reports predict
that the Soviet Union will be an
oil importer soon. Her foreign
exchange problems are such that
she probably won't have the
money to pay for the oil she'll
need. Ergo, she'll take it.
To deny that the Persian Gulf
is not the Soviets' most likely
target is absurd. Another "shred
of evidence" is the fact that
Soviet troops are concentrating
near the Iranian border with Af
ghanistan, even though rebel ac
tivity is not a problem in that
area. The troops are obviously
there to threaten Iran.
To return to the thrust of the
column, before the draft was
abolished, it was de to op
pose it because the deferment
system led to the induction of a
disproportionate number of
poor. So liberals, shocked at this
evil, racist system, were forabol

ition. They omitted to mention
that without the draft, the white,
middle-class college students
(whose 11-S's wouldn't last
forever) would not risk being
drafted either.
But because the all-volunteer
military is not an attractive
career for a new batch of college
students, the poor are still dis
proportionately prominent in
the armed forces. The proposed
draft would do away with the
exemptions once so handy for
college students. The selection
process would be fair.
Or more bluntly, white,
middle-class, collegiate asses
would be on the line along with
everybody else's. The former
Daily editors and the rest of the
liberals should be pleased that
the draft would introduce equity
into a military system whose
composition now resembles that
caused by the previous racist
draft.
But, by their silence on this
point, the authors are clearly wil
ling to let the poorand minorities
run the risks of combat. So, lib
eral solicitude for minority draf
tees in the past now rings hollow.
Instead of their pious no
more-than-half-truths about
their reasons for opposing the
draft then (and now), the liberal
hypocrites could have said, "I
don't care what happens, as long
as it happens to somebody else."
