## Consumer boycotts no solution 
### 
While shopping for beer re
cently, I got involved in a
thought-pro\oking argument
with a friend. In fact, I was nearly
forbidden to buy Coors on the
grounds that the Adolph Coors
Co. was run by a bunch of haw
kish, right-wing Birchers who
indulged in unfair labor prac
tices.
This incident reminded me of
the significant influence "con
sumerism" — or the use of the
consumer's dollar to mandate
corporate redress for political,
moral or legal wrongs— has had
on all of us. And I couldn't help
thinking that this force, and its
powerful weapon, the boycott,
would eventually undermine not
only the due process of law. but
our basic freedom to believe in
any ideal, no, matter how un
popular.
My complaint is not that what
my friend said was wrong. Like
him. 1 have never been to Gol
den. Colorado, never inter
viewed aCoors .employee, never
seen anything e\en close to
first-hand evidence. These alle
gations were passed to me, as
they had been to him. by word ol
mouth. So I can't say whether
they are true or not.
But the whole idea of con
sumer boycotts is frightening to
me. Boycotts are not based upon

the careful examination of evi
dence. nor do they include equit
able provision for the presenta
tion of a defense, nor is a verdict
rendered by unbiased jurors
after a trial. Instead, the verdict
is "guilty" from the start. And
therefore, completely opposite
from the procedure in our own
system of justice, the burden of
proof is placed on the defendant.
What is worse, the severity of
the punishment is not deter
mined by a knowledgeable
judge, but is fueled by rumorand
ignorance, fanned by political al
legiance.
I am not suggesting that the
Nestle Co. should be allowed to
sell poorly labelled baby food in
South America, or that Coors
should be able to pry into the
lives of its employees.
I am suggesting that this con
sumer energy, which has up to
now generated boycotts, should
be channeled into lobbying for
better laws, into electing legis
lators who would protect both
American constituents and con
sumers of American products
abroad, and into supporting a
judiciary which would pursue
violators of the law — regardless
of their corporate or otherwise
privileged position. In this way,
the right of due process would be
afforded to those accused, and

informed judgement could be
made.
This sounds, perhaps, like a
most naive brand of idealism. I
am proposing that a direct, effec
tive process, whereby consumers
can make monolithic corpora
tions alter their behaviors, be re
placed by traditional methods
which have always been frustrat
ingly. torpid. After all, legal pro
ceedings are no more than a nui
sance to most corporations. But
boycotts are feared.
I would agree that domestic
institutions like our legal system
move slowly. They require huge
amounts of energy from society,
and theirachievements are never
entirely satisfactory to anyone.
On the one hand, a boycott —
like the lynch mob with a strong
rope — can be completely effec
tive. It can also be equally un
yielding. equally unjust.
Boycotts, however, may rep
resent something entirely diffe
rent from this idea of putting the
law into the hands of consumers.
They may instead be considered
the result of many individuals re
fusing to support, with their dol
lars. businesses managed by
people with views hateful to their
own. Why, consumerists might
ask, should blacks buy products
from a white supremacist, or
homosexuals from someone who
hates gays, or Jews from an

anti-Semite?
This argument, however emo
tionally appealing, is indefensi
ble. Boycotts are not the sum
total of individual decisions
made in a vacuum. On the con
trary, they represent political ac
tions intended to force the
employees or management of a
particular business to keep their
opinions to themselves, or to
change those opinions al
together. This is outright coer
cion.
When, for example, anti-gay
crusader Anita Bryant was muz
zled because orange juice sales
flagged, it was not a triumph of
democracy, but a blow to the
freedom of speech.
No matter how heinous or bi
goted a doctrine may seem, we
must protect the right of its vot
aries to believe in that doctrine,
and their right to advocate it if
they wish. If we fail to protect
this fundamental right, then
none of us will be safe to hold an
unpopular view and still make a
living.
As America moves into a new
decade of uncertain economic
prosperity — a decade sure to be
marked by increasingly influen
tial "special interest" politics —
the use of boycotts will become
even more tempting, even more
effective. But we must resist that
temptation.
Our votes should be cast at the
ballot box. not the check-out
counter. And our dollar should
be spc nt on the best products, not
those which represent the most
appealing political view. We will
thereby be spending our money
not in support of hateful
ideologies, but in support of a
system which protects our right
to think freely.
