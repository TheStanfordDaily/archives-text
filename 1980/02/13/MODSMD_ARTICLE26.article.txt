Film reviews bad
It would be easy enough to
read Ron Lillejord's film reviews
(the Daily's "Cinemascope"),
but why bother? His are predo
minantly empty apocalyptic
rumblings which smack of pre
tentious polysyllabic vagueness
— in short, gradiloquent vignet
tes of sane idiocy that fail effort
fully.
Lillejord's most absurd re
views combine myopic generali
zation. a pompously assumed air
of apocryphal omniscience, an
abundance of deceptively ex
pressive aphorisms, and pitifully
purblind insight, to structure a
journey into literary mediocrity
that will bore — perhaps amuse

— some, and, sadly, be believed
by others.
Look, I love some of the
movies Lillejord critiques, but
his reviews, which lugubriously
monopolize Daily til m criticism,
are more an attempt to secure
immortality by christening fu
ture classics than to face the crea
tive challenge of- writing
perspicacious, informative
prose.
His untenably portentous and
hilariously strained bombastic
phraseology at times manages to
obscure some of the reviews'
vacuousness, but after compar
ing Mean Street (Four stars, an
embryonic classic) with The Rose
(One star, barely better than

television) we realize we have
read — and believed — too much
too soon.
Be prepared to not think
about Lillejord's reviews when
you plan your cinematic diver
sion and your evening cannot fail
to succeed powerfully.
