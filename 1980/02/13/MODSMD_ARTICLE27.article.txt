## Carter now is 'one of us' 
### 
"I have never claimed to he better or wiser than
any other person. I think my greatest strength is
that I am an ordinary man." —President Jimmy
Carter
Travelling west along Highway 2XO. I passed
through a very small and ordinary town, Plains,
Georgia, where it all began. When I've engaged the
locals in discussion about their former governor,
two themes kept coming up which I feel arc ap
propriate to the current nominations race.
First, everyone I've met here feels that the pre
sent governor, George Busby, has done a hell of a
lot more to make Georgia a dynamic, growing
economy than Carter ever did as governor. Indeed,
I've received the impression that Carter never kept
a campaign promise and consequently never could
have been elected to another term as governor.
Second, despite a generally poor opinion of Car
ter, it was, and is, perfectly rational for these south
ern states to support him for the presidency for no
other reason than that he was (is) a southerner.
That is. Carter became the champion of these
southern states (the in-group) simply because he
was perceived as competing with candidates from
the North and West (the out-group).
It struck me that this is precisely the same pat
tern as our national opinion of the president.
Just six months ago, Carter was considered to be
a political failure according to the polls. It ap
peared that on most domestic issues he had neither

accomplished anything of note nor had fully pur
sued his many campaign promises. He had so little
support that it seemed, as in Georgia, that he
couldn't win another term.
Starting three months ago, however. Carter
switched from being perceived as internal adminis
trator to being America's representative to the
world. In the competition between the United
States, Iran, the Saudis, the Soviet Union and Af
ghanistan, Commander-in-Chief Carter became
the logical choice to represent U.S. (in-group) sol
idarity through the people's support.
That is, it's fine when Newsweek and Gallup and
Brown decry Carter as unfit for office, but when
Leonoid Brezhnev calls him a hypocrite, or when
Iranians hum his image in effigy, he is our proud
and glorious first citizen.
What bothers me is not that the American
people give proper support to their representatives
according to the situation. What bothers me is that
the Americans cannot distinguish support from
election.
It appears that Carter will be nominated for and
quite likely serve another term as president — not
because he is better than the other candidates, not
because he is wiser nor even because he did a good
job during his first term. He will win votes because
he is one of us.
