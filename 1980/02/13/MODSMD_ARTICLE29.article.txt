# SAE pledges work to aid handicapped
## 
### Danny Epner Staff writer 
The status of physically li
mited people in most com
munities today can be likened to
that of black people 10 or 20
years ago. Handicapped people
— wheelchair users, blind people
and deaf people — are simply
not afforded the rights that most
others enjoy.
This is because, in general,
people are unaware of the spe
cial problems, needs and abilities
of handicapped people and as a
result, are unequipped to deal

with these matters.
The 1979-80 pledge class of
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE)
fraternity has recently taken
steps to heighten awareness here
in the hope of ultimately making
it a better place for disabled stu
dents to live in an environment
more attuned to their needs.
Their project, entitled "Just
Like Everybody Else," involves
the cooperative effort of every
member of the pledge class. It
consists of several specific goals
which were outlined six months
ago by the pledges, under the

leadership of pledge president
Eddie Poplawski.
Most importantly, they hope
to heighten awareness about
handicapped people and elimi
nate many common misconcep-
I tions. To do this, they are staging
1 an awareness week during which
a series of three one-hour pre
sentations will be given in
Roble Hall and Toyon Hall
today and tomorrow.
The presentations will be led
by Dick Farr, a former Univer
sity graduate student who was

diagnosed as having multiple
sclerosis while here and has been
a wheelchair user ever since. He
believes very strongly that physi
cally limited people are "just like
everybody else" and has done his
best to impress this fact upon the
television viewing audience.
Farr is series host and creator
of a television program entitled
"Just Like Everybody Else"
which focuses on handicapped
people. He will show videotaped
excerpts of some of his shows at
the dorm awareness meetings.
By doing so, Farr hopes to
teach participants how to apply
what they see on television to
real-life situations. Topics such
as knowing the proper time to
help a handicapped or blind per
son will be discussed at the
awareness week meetings.
According to Jim Oswald, pro
ject assistant, "The purpose of
our awareness week is to elimi
nate the labeling and stereotyp
ing of people with physical limi
tations. We often think of a dis
abled person as being 'sick' or
'different.' This is hardly the
case. They are just like everyone
else."
A second goal of the SAE
pledged is to provide physically
limited people here with more
University facilities such as
ramps, elevators with braille
numbers and proper educational
facilities in the library system.
The pledge class is establishing
a fund from which disabled
people here can draw money to
be used for their own purposes.

Much of this money will proba
bly be used to equip a room in
the new wing of the Green lib
rary with items such as typewri
ter proofreaders and braille cal
culators to aid blind students.
Assistant Provost Wayne
Price and NickZirpolo, a former
Stanford student who is disabled,
both contributed ideas for the
project and advice to the
pledges.
Funding has been provided by
corporate and SAE alumni do
nations and the SAE casino night
held Saturday.
The pledge class hopes the
fund will increase, and combined
with awareness and concern,
allow more handicapped stu
dents to attend the University.

a fund from which disabled
people here can draw money to
be used for their own purposes.

Much of this money will proba
bly be used to equip a room in
the new wing of the Green lib
rary with items such as typewri
ter proofreaders and braille cal
culators to aid blind students.
Assistant Provost Wayne
Price and NickZirpolo, a former
Stanford student who is disabled,
both contributed ideas for the
project and advice to the
pledges.
Funding has been provided by
corporate and SAE alumni do
nations and the SAE casino night
held Saturday.
The pledge class hopes the
fund will increase, and combined
with awareness and concern,
allow more handicapped stu
dents to attend the University.
