# Trustees okay housing plan
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
The Board of Trustees approved yes
terday a plan to construct 800 units of
undergraduate housing, to be com
pleted by the fall of 1983.
The new facility, to be located on
Santa Teresa Street and bordered by
Lagunita Court, Lake Lagunita and the
present golf driving range, is expected
to cost the University between $32 and
$36 million. The project will most
likely be funded through bonds from
the California Educational Facilities
Authority (CEFA).
According to Norman Robinson, as
sociate dean for residential education,
CEFA is a "mechanism whereby pri
vate educational institutions can sell
bonds which are 'tax free." " This plan
will allow the University to borrow the
money needed for the project at a fairly
low interest rate, Robinson added.
The trustees' action follows their re
view last November of a 107-page re
port warning that the local housing
crunch might soon restrict the Univer
sity's ability to recruit outstanding
graduate students.
Following the completion of the 800
new units, the University will be able to
house approximately 84 percent of the
6,460 undergraduates here. Most or all

of Manzanita Park will he converted to
graduate student use.
Plans for the new project call for
three different types of housing, includ
ing three independent houses modeled
after the Row Houses, a complex of
connected houses modeled after
'Lagunita Court, and several buildings
with suites, a type of housing used at
several Eastern schools, but new to
Stanford.
"Suites are individual or double stu
dent rooms with a living room shared
by a few students," Robinson said. The
students housed in these suites would
eat at the eating clubs, and the com
plex would combine "the privacy of an
apartment with the community feeling
in the eating clubs," he said.
The project will be undertaken in
three phases, according to Robert Ner
rie. senior project planner for the Uni
versity. Preliminary site development
will probably begin next summer with
construction on the Row Houses to
begin about this time next year, Nerrie
said.
"We think we can probably get (the
Row Houses) on the line about a year
before the others," Nerrie said, al
though any estimates at this time are
"very preliminary," he added.
At this point an architect has not yet

officially been selected, although it
should he forthcoming, he said.
Eshrick, Homsey, Dodge & Davis,
San Francisco architects, were retained
last spring as consultants-in-planning.
While they have not been officially
selected as project architects, it is an
ticipated that the firm will be retained
somewhere in the near future, accord
ing to Mike Charlson, student
member of the Dean's Advisory Com
mittee on New Residences.
