# Environmental group requests nuke shutdown
## 
### Ellen Hume The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — Citing new losses
of bomb-grade uranium from the Nuclear
Fuel Services processing plant in Erwin,
Tenn.. an environmental group has asked
the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to
close the facility.
The Natural Resources Defense Coun
cil argued in documents filed at the com
mission that employees of the plant or
terrorists could manufacture nuclear
bombs from uranium missing from the
plant.
The commission has conceded that as
much as 186 kilograms of the highly en
riched uranium has disappeared from the
plant since 1968, lost either in the proces
sing itself or possibly by theft.
The commission decided on Jan. 21,
however, to allow the private facility to
stay in operation because it is the source
of fuel pellets for the U.S. Navy's nuclear
submarines, and is therefore essential,

commission spokesman Frank Ingram
said Monday.
Unable to determine the source of
some of the losses despite repeated inves
tigations of the plant, the commission de
cided on Jan. 21 to change its uranium
accounting requirements so that they
would be "reasonably achievable" at the
Erwin plant, Ingram said.
The Natural Resources Defense Coun
cil, whose members include business
executive Laurance Rockefeller and actor
Robert Redford, argued that those re
laxed standards could "set a precedent"
for other plants, and relax nuclear
safeguards around the world.
In its documents filed at the commis
sion, which were kept secret until edited
and released Monday, the environmental
group noted that new shortages of the
bomb-grade uranium were discovered at
the end of a bimonthly inventory Aug. 14,

1979.
Although the amount of the shortage
officially was secret, it was learned that it
was 20 to 30 kilograms, enough for a
crude nuclear device.
"It is within the capability of small . . .
groups of people, e.g. employees or ter
rorists, to design and fabricate a crude
nuclear-explosive device with highly en
riched uranium diverted from the NFS-
Erwin facility," the environmental group
noted in its request for a formal hearing
on the plant's license.
The council's complaint was prepared
by Thomas Cochran, a nuclear physicist
and council member who has been a
leader of the opposition against the
Clinch River, Tenn., breeder reactor.
"By its own admission the commission
cannot eliminate the possibility of theft,"
the council's complaint said. It charged
that the commission's new accounting
procedures, and other changes at the

Erwin plant, "will not adequately assure
that continued operation of the NFS-
Erwin facility will not he inimical to or
constitute an unreasonable risk to the
common defense and security of the Un
ited States, and to the health and safety of
the public.
The council's previous attempts to shut
down the Erwin facility pending
safeguard improvements have been re
jected by the commission.
The loss of 206 pounds of bomb-grade
uranium from a different facility in
Apollo, Pa., in 1960 has long been attri
buted in defense circles to theft or diver
sion to Israel. Commission sources be
lieve it is less likely that the Erwin plant
has been burglarized.
But the Natural Resources Defense
Council argued, in his filings with the
commission, that if the uranium is being
lost in the processing itself a new facility
should be built with adequate safeguards
to health and the environment.
