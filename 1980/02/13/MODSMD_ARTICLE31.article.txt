# Decision ethics explored
## 
### John Mason Staff writer 
If you were a physician faced
with performing life-saving
surgery on an infant who was cer
tain to grow up mentally re
tarded, would you operate?
What it the parents wanted to let
the child die?
Or, if you were a journalist
with access to secret government
information which the public
would want to know, would you
divulge?
A continuing investigation
into how one might approach
such dilemmas will begin this
week at the American Studies

theme house.
In response to a campus-wide
offer made by the Office of Resi
dential Education to fund de
serving house projects, students
at American Studies turned an
interest in contemporary ethical
problems into a program called
"Ethics in Professional
Decision-Making."
Over the next two months,
American Studies residents will
examine controversial issues in
each of five professional fields:
medicine, journalism, education,
business and law. They will de
vote one week to medicine and
two weeks to each of the four
other fields.
In the first week of each two
week session, student planners
will meet with locally or nation
ally recognized leaders in the re
levant field to develop a chal
lenging case study which deals
with a particularly vexing prob
lem. This will be followed by a
sherry hour where students will
be introduced to the problems
specific to ethical decision
making in that field.
The second week's activities
will bring the entire Stanford
community into the debate
when, early in the week, the case
study will be published in the
Daily. This will be followed by a
formal panel discussion which
will be open to the public.
When asked why students at
Stanford — where the unofficial
motto is "work-study-get rich"
— should be interested in ethics,
American Studies Resident Fel
low Fred Hargadon replied that,
"these will be dilemmas as prac
titioners in American society will

see them."
As co-coordinator Steve De-
Leers put it, "a great many of the
students here will be in a position
to make these decisions." Added
DeLeers, "the number (of stu
dents) who will be making grand
decisions — like government
policy — will be much smaller
than the number who will have to
make these (professional) deci
sions."
Are today's professionals
more in need of ethical training
than professionals in the past?
"There are probably more
kinds of dilemmas today." said
Hargadon. New technologies,
the increasing use of lawyers and
courts, a better understanding of
the environmental impact of our
actions, and a more generally in
tegrated society all contribute, in
Hargadon's view, to making
modern decisions more comply.
The American Studies prog
ram will not attempt to find
answers to plaguing social issuers,
but will instead explore how cur
rent leaders in the professions
deal with these problems them
selves. In Hargadon's words
"You're not attempting to reach
the 'right' answer. It is more im
portant to be comfortable (with
the idea) that there aren't any
'right' answers."
The first of the public event?,
"Ethics in Medicine," will take
place tonight at 7:00 p.m. at thye
American Sudies House. Fea
tured will be a panel discussic*i
between neonatalogist Dr. Ro 1
Cohen, Attorney Carol Pric:
and Medical Center Chaplai 1
Ernie Young.

other day in search of snacks left over by sunseeking
picnickers. Spring is on its way.
