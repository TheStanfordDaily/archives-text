# Radio uses bones to amplify sound
## 
### 
CHICAGO (AP) — If you get annoyed by
people carrying loud-playing tape decks and
radios in public, you can always recommcnd
the "Bone Fone," a sound system that's
more like a scarf than a radio.
"It's like wearing a concert hall around
your neck," says Bill Hass, the 32-year-old
who was inspired by a skier wearing head
phones.
With the Bone Fone, only the listener
shakes, rattles and rolls; other folks hear
hardly a murmur. The wearer's bones pro
vide the amplification.
Mail order
The compact, 15-ounce miniaturized
AM-FM stereo radio is available only
through the mail at present, but Hass, presi
dent of Bone Fone Corp.. said yesterday he
expects it to be on store shelves by April.
"Three factors make it better than anyone
expected," Hass explained. "The first is close
placement of the speaker to the ear, so that a

low level of volume creates high sound pres
sure.
"The second factor — where the name
comes from — is that the unit actually pul
sates because of the way the speaker is
mounted, and the vibrations are transmitted
through your body."
Because bone acts as an amplfier, he said,
"the sound resonates to the inner ear."
Thirdly, the unit delivers quality stereo
separation because of the proximity of the
right ear to the right channel and conversely,
left to left. Further, the proximity of the unit
to both ears takes advantage of an acoustic
effect called cross-feed — the right channel
being picked up by the left ear and vice versa
— creating a spatial effect similar to how the
music was originally recorded.
Music centered
"You can understand the idea by relating
it to headphones, which seem to center the
music inside your head," Hass said. "With

the Bone Fone, music tends to surround
you."
Hass, an avid skier, designed the unit with
the musically-inclined sportsman in mind.
The genesis for the "Bone Fone" came to
Hass about five years ago while he watched
another skier make his way down the slopes
wearing headphones.
"I tried it myself, with a $ 15 tape player on
my back and headphones." he said. "It
sounded really neat, if you ran imagine a
Strauss waltz playing while you sail down the
mountain. But it looked funny and the head
phones kept falling off. I figured there must
be an easier way."
Then a director of planning with the ac
counting firm of Peat, Martwick, Mitchell &
Co., Hass developed some prototypes,
patented the unit and developed a strategy to
market it. But he found several large com
panies unwilling to promote a product not
developed from within their ranks.
