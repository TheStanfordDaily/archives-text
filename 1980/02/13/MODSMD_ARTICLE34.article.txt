# Tri Vette 3-wheeled vehicle gets 68 mpg, goes 100 mph
## 
### Krisan Froelich Staff Writer 
You could own a car that gets
68 miles per gallon on the high
way and has a top speed of over
100 mph. That's if you're satis
fied with a dart-shaped, three
wheeled vehicle that's techni
cally a motorcycle.
"The vehicle is not that diffe
rent. It just looks different," said
engineer and physicist Bob
Keyes, inventor of the new
TriVette.
He and Richard Meredith,
both from the Applied Technol
ogy Division of Itek Corp. in
Sunnyvale, showed the car to a
communication class here earlier
this week.
"We think it's a really sensible
car," Meredith said. "Ninety
percent of all vehicles driven
have only one occupant. It's
foolish to drive a 4000-pound
car with five empty seats." The
TriVette is about half the weight
of a regular car.
Designed for the commuter,
the TriVette has a Fiat engine,
carries two passengers and is
built by hand in Ventura, Calif.
During the Arab Oil Embargo
in the early 19705, Keyes began
looking for both economical and
usable alternative forms of
transportation. Completed in
October 1974, the first TriVette
sold for $3600, and in late 1978
the last one manufactured sold
for $5600.
"If it were commercially built,
I expect it would retail about
$3500," said Keyes.
Approved by the Federal gov
ernment and various states, 24
completed cars have been sold
pi us two as kits. "But we couldri't
continue to hand build them on a

custom basis" because of the
cost, Keyes said. "In 1978 we
shut down production."
Keyes and Meredith are now
searching for a commercial man
ufacturer. "We're currently
seeking funds to redesign the
TriVette," Meredith said. "We
have two problems: overcoming
the resistance to change and
producing the vehicle."
Marketing is not the barrier,
manufacturing is," Keyes
explained. "1 have orders all the
time. I can't get the money to
build."
According to him, their prob
lem results from the low fuel
costs and until recently, the
adequate fuel supply, people's
current investments in their cars,
and fear of the "inertial effect"
or instability.
"People are skeptical about
three-wheeled vehicles because
they are associated with other
things that aren't stable,"
Meredith explained. "But this
car proves the concept sound."

The low center of gravity is
near the back two wheels for
safety and balance. "One driver
in Minnesota told us it was the
most stable thing he'd ever dri
ven in snow," Meredith said.
Equipped with standard parts,
the TriVette has an integral
roll-bar, side beams and a
crushable nose. "The front end is
fiberglass and would cost about
$80 to replace," Keyes said.
"That's about a third the cost of a
bumper."
Though you might have trou
ble adjusting to a gear shift be
tween your knees, you would
catch every eye. "The only dis
advantage is all the finger
prints," Keyes said jokingly. "It
gets good gas mileage and you
still have something fun to
drive."
"The driver doesn't have to
live with less. He actually gets
more out of the vehicle. It's
quicker and handles better in
traffic. You don't have to give up
anything except empty seats."

With a triangular shape and 68 mph, these two TriVettes may resemble somewhat the autos
that will fill the highways 20 years from now.

completed cars have been sold
pi us two as kits. "But we couldri't
continue to hand build them on a

custom basis" because of the
cost, Keyes said. "In 1978 we
shut down production."
Keyes and Meredith are now
searching for a commercial man
ufacturer. "We're currently
seeking funds to redesign the
TriVette," Meredith said. "We
have two problems: overcoming
the resistance to change and
producing the vehicle."
Marketing is not the barrier,
manufacturing is," Keyes
explained. "1 have orders all the
time. I can't get the money to
build."
According to him, their prob
lem results from the low fuel
costs and until recently, the
adequate fuel supply, people's
current investments in their cars,
and fear of the "inertial effect"
or instability.
"People are skeptical about
three-wheeled vehicles because
they are associated with other
things that aren't stable,"
Meredith explained. "But this
car proves the concept sound."

The low center of gravity is
near the back two wheels for
safety and balance. "One driver
in Minnesota told us it was the
most stable thing he'd ever dri
ven in snow," Meredith said.
Equipped with standard parts,
the TriVette has an integral
roll-bar, side beams and a
crushable nose. "The front end is
fiberglass and would cost about
$80 to replace," Keyes said.
"That's about a third the cost of a
bumper."
Though you might have trou
ble adjusting to a gear shift be
tween your knees, you would
catch every eye. "The only dis
advantage is all the finger
prints," Keyes said jokingly. "It
gets good gas mileage and you
still have something fun to
drive."
"The driver doesn't have to
live with less. He actually gets
more out of the vehicle. It's
quicker and handles better in
traffic. You don't have to give up
anything except empty seats."

With a triangular shape and 68 mph, these two TriVettes may resemble somewhat the autos
that will fill the highways 20 years from now.
