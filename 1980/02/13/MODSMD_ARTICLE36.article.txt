# S.F. may convert Wharf to fish processing facility

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Fisherman's
Wharf, the famous waterfront strip of restaur
ants and souvenir shops, may be getting a lot
more of something that's been in short supply:
fishermen.
The city hopes to convert a waterfront pier
into a multimillion dollar facility for processing
fresh fish.
"1 think what it will do is protect the invest
ment we already have in the Fisherman's Wharf
area in the restaurants, and the fleet we already
have," Ed David, director of the city's port, said
Monday. "We expect the pier development will
create 1000 jobs."
David is seeking bids to convert Pier 45 in the
heart of the wharf area into a fish handling and
processing facility.
And it will also do its part in attracting vis
itors. said David. "It's just amazing how a net
full of fish, or some boat bringing in a shark, will
draw tourists!" he said.
Most of the colorand fishing atmosphere now
comes from restaurant signs and shops, with the
salty waterfront image largely cosmetic.

"1 keep telling people — how can you call it
Fisherman's Wharf if you don't have a fishing
industry here?" said Sal Balestrieri of Fisher
man's Wharf Seafood, which distributes
shellfish imported from the East Coast.
4000 metric tons
The fishing industry on the wharf now takes
in about 4000 metric tons annually of bottom
fish such as sole, cod and flounder. But that's a
far cry from a peak in the 1950s when hundreds
of fishing vessels called San Francisco their
home port.
Only about 50 boats, some only seasonal ves
sels. now operate for as few as a dozen com
panies. Seven other companies are distributors.
Da\ id Hopes the 400,000 square feet of Pier
45, with its 2500 feet of berthing space, will
revive interest in "several under-utilized
species." such as shortbelly rockfish. Pacific
whiting and shark.
Experts who see the development of Pie-r 45
as only one step toward rebuilding a neglected
wharf industry say other things are needed to
revive fishing.
