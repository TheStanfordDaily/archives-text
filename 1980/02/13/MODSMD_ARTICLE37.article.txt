# New Zealander reflects on teaching career
## 
### Paul Zuvella Staff Writer 
"Rugby, racing and beer —
that's why we are all here," said
Assoc. Prof. Paul Griffin, recal
ling a popular phrase chanted
often during his high school and
college years.
These are "the three things in
New Zealand one must do to be a
full-fledged member of society,"
he said with a smile, referring to
the country's number one sport,
its citizens' love for betting at the
races, and its consumption of
barley and malts that rivals
neighboring Australia.
But that is certainly not why
New Zealander Paul Griffin is
here, as an associate professor of
accounting in the Graduate
School of Business.
"Stanford is a good school,
with good students, and it has
substantial research programs,"
Griffin said, emphasizing his
points with slight hand gestures.
He came to the Uni\ersit\ "be
cause of the job offer. 1 had
never been to California before 1
came to interview," he said.
Resened enthusiasm
He has been teaching here
since 1974. He teaches with a
resened enthusiasm, scribbling
rapidly on his two chalkboards
while maintaining a solemn, al
most frowning expression. Occa

sionally, he runs his hand
through his black hair as he
pauses to explain the accounting
charts he has just drawn.
Griffin realizes that the sub
jects he teaches are, at times,
dull. If he saw a student in the
back of the room yawning or
sleeping, he would smile rather
than feel he was doing a poor job
as a teacher.
Gauging student needs
"My first teaching job was at
22. and I don't think I've lost my
ability to feel what students want
or to feel when I'm not taking
care of their needs." Griffin said,
reflecting upon his 1 1 years of
teaching.
"1 think I have a good feeling
for students, having lived with
them," he added, referring to his
two years (1976-78) as a resi
dent fellow at Larkin in Stern
Hall.
Griffin remembers those years
as wonderful experiences. "Be
ing a resident fellow, you learn
about people's feelings about
five times as fast as you normally
would," he commented.
Former Larkin residents said
Griffin fulfilled his role well.
"He made everyone feel com
fortable around him," recalled
junior David Jaffe. "He was re
ally approachable and he really
had a good sense of humor."
'Good rapport'
Another junior and former
Larkin resident, Mike
Zboralske, expressed similar
feelings about Griffin. "He had
really good rapport with the stu
dents. You felt you could talk to
him."
Though he enjoyed the ex
perience of living with the stu
dents, Griffin. 33, felt being resi
dent fellow was "pretty restric
tive." It also involved a time
commitment which could take
away from his work, he said.

In addition to teaching. Griffin
has done research in related
fields, most notably financial ac
counting and business finance,
and published several articles.
In describing his research,
Griffin said, "personally, I think
you have to see some real world
application to what you' re doing.
Your idea has to have some prac
tical utility."
Other involvements
Griffin has also been involved
in professional service organiza
tions such as the American Ac
counting Association and the
American Finance Association.
Judy McConica, Griffin's
former secretary, said Griffin
"really put a lot of time into his
research. But he never seemed
too busy to have to avoid seeing
students."
Though work and teaching
take up much of his time. Griffin
still finds time to run, something
he really enjoys doing.
" My current plan is to run two
marathons a year and to run
enough to stay in shape for that,"
he said.
Enjoys outdoors
Griffin said he also enjoys sail
ing. He half-jokingly said one of
his ambitions is "to sail around
the world before I'm 40." He en
joys the outdoors, which comes
from his New Zealand upbring
ing.
Griffin earned both his
bachelor's and master's degrees
in commerce and administration
at the Victoria University of
Wellington, in New Zealand.
He decided to attend graduate
school in the United States,
choosing over Australia, Eng
land and Canada, because "if
you want to study business, why
not go to the best — or the coun
try that is the most successful in
business," he said.
Applying to several schools.
Griffin said he finally decided on
Ohio State because the school
seemed interested in him per

sonally.
Laughing, he recalls another
acceptance he received. "I re
member distinctly getting my ac
ceptance from Berkeley two
months after 1 started at Ohio
State. They sent it surface mail
rather than air mail. That
showed me they didn't really
care."
At Ohio State, Griffin re
ceived his Ph.D. in accounting
while instructing and working as
a research assistant. After receiv
ing his Ph.D. in 1974, Griffin
moved west, accepting the job at
Stanford.
When asked how Midwester
ners differed from Californians,
Griffin paused then replied with
a smile, "they have a few more

inches around the belly out
there."
Griffin, a bachelor, said he
likes California. "When I saw
California, 1 said, 'Hey, this is
much more like the country I'm
used to.' "
Griffin's career goals are
"fairly well defined." In general,
he explained, "you want to be a
tenured professor at a good uni
versity, but you're aware that
many untenured professors
don't become tenured, so you're
always looking elsewhere."
Leaning back in his chair, he
rested his hands on his stomach
and added, "I've never really
worried about it, though. Every
thing's always worked out pretty
well for me."
