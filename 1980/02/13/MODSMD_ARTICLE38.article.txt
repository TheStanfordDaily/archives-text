# Codes hinder rural builders

SACRAMENTO (AP) — In these days when a
low-priced single family home costs $50,000,
Anon Forrest is proud of the one she built herself:
It cost $2,000.
Ms. Forrest, 35. is one of thousands of Califor
nians who built their own homes in backwoods
areas, only to fall into the clutches of local building
codes.
These backwoods builders have won their case
so far, but some local officials say if building codes
are relaxed, substandard housing will proliferate,
;rnd future generations of home buyers will suffer.
That dispute will be renewed today when a legis
lative committee will hold its first hearing on a bill
that would repeal a new liberalized "cabin hous
ing" code for owner-occupied homes.
Pretty blonde Ms. Forrest, a member of the state
commission which approved the cabin housing
code, was a weaver in San Francisco when she
began shopping for land.
"I'm from North Dakota, and in North Dakota
you get yourself some land and do the best you can.
We're mostly from low-middle to low-economic
backgrounds. We're doing this to avoid living in
cities and probably being on welfare," she said in
an interview.
She bought 20 acres of backwoods Mendocino
County for $7000. At the end of a five-mile dirt
road she began building.
"People think building is a big deal. They're
conned into believing that," she said.
Her beams came from Playland, the demolished
San Francisco amusement park. "Six by 14 clear
fir, 28 feet long."
Structural timber came from a dead tree which a
friend sawed for $90. The plywood is top grade, but
it accidentally got stained at the mill and the stain
would bleed through any paint. Cheap. The siding
came from a truckload that had crashed into a
ravine. Even cheaper.
Ms. Forrest's 620-square-foot house has five
rooms and a wood cook stove. She has a home
rigged shower and an indoor compost privy.

Her water comes from a spring. It goes first into a
Doughboy above-ground swimming pool from
which she supplies several neighbors.
Ms. Forrest said her house would have been torn
down a few years ago if Mendocino County offi
cials had had their way. That's when she helped
organize United Stand, a society of backwoods
builders. She said more than 200 cases of code
violations were scheduled for trial. Four trials
ended in acquittals, even though the accused ad
mitted guilt, she said.
So the country agreed to let the backwoods buil
ders seek state relief, and Ms. Forrest took a slide
show to Sacramento to show Gov. Jerry Brown.
Now, a law which took effect last month makes
vast exceptions to the codes, but only for lodging
that individuals build to live in themselves.
Proponents say the exceptions would be effec
tive only in areas designated by local governments.
This would permit local governments to accept or
reject non-code housing.
The code exceptions arc numerous. They xfon't
require pressurized water faucets: Pumps are OK.
They waive the requirement that the heaUtig sys
tem be able to maintain 70 degrees three feet
above the floor. No electricity is required.
They don't even require flush toilets: outhouses
are OK, and even indoor compost privies,— pro
vided local health officials approve.
The opponents, represented by the County
Supervisors Association of California, say the rules
permit substandard housing which could endanger
the health, welfare and safety of occupants, visitors
and future buyers.
Assemblyman Eugene Chappie (R-Roseville)
whose constituents complained to him of outdoor
privies near their mountain streams, introduced
A 81996 to void the cabin housing rules and forbid
the state from imposing building standards on the
cities and counties.
His bill is before the Assembly Housing and
Community Development Committee today.
