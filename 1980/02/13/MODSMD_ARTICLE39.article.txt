# Student group raises funds for Cambodians
## 
### Hillary Hall 
A dollar for the Band? Sure. A
dollar for the Daily? Why not?
But a dollar for Cambodia? That
might make you pause more than
usual as you peruse your future
PTR's.
It is just such a reflective pause
that the Campus Coalition for
Cambodian Relief is anxious to
cultivate. The relief coalition is
an unprecedented, specifically
humanitarian, apolitical organi
zation seeking to raise money for
a relief fund and to increase
community awareness of the
needs of third world nations, said
Marc Selwyn, a group leader.
This group formed spontane
ously last October in response to
a shared concern of many stu
dents. particularly those already
active in minority and religious
groups, to help mitigate the
hunger and starvation that af
fects the daily experience of mill
ions of Cambodians, Selwyn
said.

Distribute supplies
The coalition collects and
channels funds into larger or
ganizations which distribute re
lief in the form of food and medi
cal supplies. Because of the unre
liable nature of information com
ing out of Cambodia, it is not
known whether this relief is actu
ally reaching the starving popu
lation.
During autumn quarter, the
40 members collected $10,800
total, $8300 of which was sent to
Oxfam International, a world
hunger organization, and $1500
of which was sent to the Red
Cross. This quarter, the remain
ing balance, about $800, has
been sent to Oxfam.
Fundraising
Last quarter, the campus relief
group collected the sum through
only two fundraising methods.
They raised approximately
$3700 through a Big Game Raf
fle for prizes donated by local
businesses. The remaining funds
were collected through active
canvassing throughout campus.
Winter quarter, however, pre
sents different possibilities.
Since the gravity of the Cambo
dian situation is reported to have
lessened, the relief group now
sees a need to extend its focus
beyond Cambodia to include
other needy societies.
Although they still intend to
raise money specifically for the
Cambodians, the group feels that
immediate goals for this quarter
are community education and a
broadening of their original pur
pose.
Future activities
At a recent meeting, the
members discussed possible fu
ture activities. These include
supporting a refugee family in
conjunction with a charity or re
ligious group; a benefit concert
to be co-sponsored by Joan Baez
and her relief group; and a prog
ram through which students
could donate items to newly
relocated refugee families.
The group has also been in
contact with the ASSU Senate
and with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons regarding a possi
ble fee assessment for a
humanitarian relief fund to be
placed on the spring ballot. The
group failed to secure the fee as
sessment last quarter only be
cause of a lack of organization
and a concern over the legality of
University involvement in out
side charities, Selwyn said.
