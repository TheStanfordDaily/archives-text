WASHINGTON — The Carter ad
ministration told Congress yesterday
that should the resumption of the milit
ary draft become necessary it will be
based on a random lottery system that
would take 20-year-olds first.
In a 62-page report to Congress on
President Jimmy Carter's decision to
call for the resumption of draft registra
tion for men and his request forauthor
ity to require registration of women,
the administration stressed that Carter
"has no intention under present cir
cumstances" of also calling for re
newed military conscription.
Nevertheless, the administration
outlined a plan for a possible future
draft and estimated that 100,000 draf
tees could be processed by the Selec
tive Service System 28 days after a
general military mobilization.
Currently, Carter has authority to
require registration for the draft of men
between the ages of 18 and 26. He has
asked Congress for $45 million to
begin registering 19- and 20-year-olds
born in 1960 and 1961, and also for
authority to require women born in the
same years to register.
The president would need congres-

sional approval before the draft could
be resumed.
If the draft becomes necessary, ac
cording to the report, the lottery sys
tem would first take young people who
reach the age of 20 the year military
conscription is resumed — those born
in 1960 if the draft were resumed this
year. The lottery would be based on
dates of birth chosen by random selec
tion.
The administration said the registra
tion of 19- and 20-year-olds this year
would produce a sufficiently large
manpower pool and noted that Carter's
plan calls for the routine registration of
18-year-olds on their birthdays, begin
ning Jan. 1.
The estimate that 100,000 draftees
could be processed in 28 days after a
general mobilization was based on the
assumption that Congress would grant
the president authority to resume the
draft one day after he asked for it.
During such a draft, according to the
report, inductees would be notified by
a Western Union mailgram. The mail
gram would order the inductee to re
port for a physical examination and
processing, and would provide infor

mation on exemption and deferment
rights and forms on which to claim an
exemption or deferment, as well as the
address of his local draft board, which
would consider such claims.
Carter has said no draft instituted by
his administration would allow such de
ferments as those for students, which
he says has tended in the past to protect
the more affluent from military service
at the expense of the poor.
The president's registration plan
would not involve the issuance of draft
cards or the classification of young
people by marital or other status. The
administration reported that it had
considered requiring classification at
the time of registration but had con
cluded that it would not be worth the
cost and would not speed up the pro
cess.
"The benefit of classification before
mobilization would not be in response
time, but in a more orderly induction
process since orders would be issued
only to fhose already classified," the
report said.
The Carter plan also does not call for
reactivating local draft boards at this
time. However, the report said that the
Selective Service System will work with
the nation's governors over the next 18
months "to develop a process for re
cruiting and training members of local
boards" should the resumption of the
draft become necessary.
The administration has also required
by a congressional resolution to con
sider the possibility of instituting a sys
tem of either voluntary or compulsory
national service outside the military.
The report concluded that a compul
sory system, under which young people
chosen by lottery or military service
would be offered the option of civilian
service, was "the most promising of the
possible plans studied."
It said such a proposal "should be
examined further in contingency plan
ning for any actual military conscrip
tion," but added that "there is no need
for a national civilian service program
at this time "
