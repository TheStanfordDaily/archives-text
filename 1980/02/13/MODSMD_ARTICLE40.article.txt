## Women golfers start with an upset 
### John Julius Staff Writer 
Led by sophomore Debbie
Barberio's course record shatter
ing 69. the Stanford Women's
Varsity Golf Team opened its
1980 season with a shocking tie
with number one-ranked San
Jose State in a Northern Califor
nia Athletic Conference match
held here Monday.
Barberio's score cut two shots
off the previous Stanford record
set last fall by Stanford junior
Linda Bowman. Also contribut
ing to Stanford's fine score was
sophomore Barbara Wright,
who turned in a one-under par

score of 70.
Stanford as a team shot 308 in
the morning round and 303 in
the afternoon round, matching
San Jose State's effort. "The af
ternoon total is a record low for
the team." commented coach
Tim Baldwin.
Patty Sheehan of San Jose cap
tured the individual honors with
rounds of 72 and 77. Barberio
followed her 69 with an after
noon score of 82.
"When I teed it up in the af
ternoon I wasn't reach to play."
explained Barberio. "It's hard
to follow such a good score,
especially being so tired after the

morning round. I shot 4b on the
front nine and needed to save
face, so I shot a 36 on the back."
The women's team is finally
showing the talent the team
members knew they had. but had
failed to accomplish. "After a
slow start in the fall, the team is
really starting to gel upon enter
ing the heart of the season." be
lieves coach Baldwin. "Next
week is the Arizona Intercol
legiate in Tucson, and the team
should put in a fine effort. Our
goal for Arizona was to finish in
the top five. The team feels now
that they are capable of w inning
a major intercollegiate like
Arizona."
Perhaps the most surprised
observer of Barberio's record
was Barberio herself. "1 was hit
ting it terribly on the range be
fore the round. It was so cold
when I teed off the first hole that
1 wasn't feeling comfortable. But
then I hirdied the first three
holes and I started feeling tine."
Although a remarkable round.
Barberio insists it could have
been better. "I started playing
defensively, trying not to let it
slip away. I realized that I
couldn't score well at all playing
like that, so 1 loosened up. I mis
sed close putts on 15. 16 and 1 7.
so the score could have been
lower."

The entire team, however, de
serves credit for Monday's show
ing. "Counting all the scores, we
heat them (SJS)." explained
Barberio, referring to the tie
breaker rule in match play. '"The
team as a whole played remark
ably." added Baldwin. "De
bbie's tremendous round has
given the team the confidence
that they all can shoot lights
out."
Also turning in line rounds for
Stanford were Bowman and
Wright. "Linda, as usual, turned
in her extremely steady game,"
commented Baldwin. "She is de
finitely the team leader. And
Barbara's afternoon round also
broke the old course record."
Next week Stanford hopes to
at least equal Monday's perfor
mance. "Everyone's looking
forward to next week," re
marked Barberio. "We shocked
SJS yesterday and next week we
should shock the country."
Bowman agreed. "Our goal is
to win one of our next tourna
ments. and we should be able to
do it next week."
Also contributing to the
team's showing were senior Alli
son Finney (H2 and 76) and
freshman Roxy Gunilia (82 and
SO), with all theirscores counting
in the match.
