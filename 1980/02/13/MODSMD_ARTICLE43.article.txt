mited the Broncos to only three
hits.
"I was glad 1 got a start," said
Boatman who still considers
himself a potential starter in the
pitching rotation for league play.
"The main thing 1 have to
work on is my control," Boat
man admitted. " It's a trade-off. I
was kind of wild today — I
walked four batters and hit one
guy. But the ball was hard to hit:
it was really sinking away from
the hitters."
The Cards had built up a 6-0
lead behind Boatman, chipping
away at the Broncos with a run or
two every couple of innings.

Two consecutive singles by
outfielder Mike Aldrete and

this time by Zuvella and Meier,
and a wild pitch set up another
two-run inning for Stanford in

and advancing Meier to third.
Catcher Bill Worden followed
with a sacrifice fly deep to left
field that gave Meier plenty of
time to tag up and score.

ble into right field. Phil Wilson
entered the game to pinch run
for Dacus. First baseman Eric

Hardgrave moved Wilson to

and center fielder Darryl
Stephens brought Wilson home
with a solid single to right.
Boatman tired and left the
game and the six-run lead to
junior right-hander bee ( line in
the seventh inning with no outs
and the bases loaded.
Cline's first pitch was ripped
toward the right side of the in
field by Bronco pinch hitter Matt
Nyman. But a spectacular leap
ing catch by Bob DeCosta —
who was playing in Zuvella's
spot — robbed Nyman of a hit.
DeCosta then doubled off the
Santa Clara base-runner at sec
ond.
Cline allowed the next batter.
Bronco first baseman Ron Han
sen, a single that scored the one
run charged to Boatman. He got
out of the inning, however, by
striking out pinch hitter Hank
Garcia.

top half of the eighth. Lead-off
batter Jeff Moscaret reached
first on an infield single hit deep
in the hole at short. Shortstop
John Barrett doubled down the
right field line putting runners on
first and third.

and then gave up three consecu
tive singles that scored two more
runs for the Broncos. The final
out of the inning came on a full
count ground out to Buechele by
the Bronco second baseman.

Southpaw Bob Boatman prepares to deliver a pitch against a
Santa Clara batter in yesterday's game. The hard throwing
junior pitched five no-hit innings in his first start for the Cards
this season.
The Stanford baseball team
had its perfect record threatened
by Santa Clara yesterday after
noon, but held on to win the 6-5
squeaker and record its ninth win
in as many games.
Junior left hander Bob Boat
man was credited with the win in
his first start of the season after
pitching a no-hitter through five
innings of play and leaung the
game in the seventh having li
mited the Broncos to only three
hits.
"I was glad 1 got a start," said
Boatman who still considers
himself a potential starter in the
pitching rotation for league play.
"The main thing 1 have to
work on is my control," Boat
man admitted. " It's a trade-off. I
was kind of wild today — I
walked four batters and hit one
guy. But the ball was hard to hit:
it was really sinking away from
the hitters."
The Cards had built up a 6-0
lead behind Boatman, chipping
away at the Broncos with a run or
two every couple of innings.

Two consecutive singles by
outfielder Mike Aldrete and
second baseman Paul Zuvella,
and'a sacrifice bunt by Dave
Meier set up a two-RBI double
for freshman third baseman
Steve Bucchele in the third in
ning. making the score 3-0.
