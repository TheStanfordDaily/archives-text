# 'Letters of intent to be signed next week
## Card football recruiting nears end 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
While most high school
seniors meticulously till out ap
plications and slave over rhetori
cal essays hoping to impress ad
missions boards, a certain group
of prep students are visited by
college representatives in their
homes, shown around campus,
and are told how their interests
will be served by attending that
school.
These are the athletic recruits,
unique prospects who can hope
to do as much for a school as the
school can do for them. This
symbiosis can be observed par
ticularly in football, where gifted
players receive exposure and
preparation for the pros while
working to ensure a winning sea
son for their college.
A week from today future
players will sign letters of intent
indicating which schools they
plan to attend. At most univer
sities the main obstacle is per
suading the recruit to play for
them.
Stanford coaches have an ad
ditional matter to contend with.
They must wait to see if a player
will be admitted before they can
offer scholarships or make prom
ises. Fortunately for the coaches,
the admissions board will decide
by this week on the list of players
who submitted applications.
After a player is notified by
Dean Hargadon he then makes
his decision.
One thing that could be on the
minds of Stanford's recruits is
the abrupt coaching transition
that occurred recently. Former
head coach Rod Dowhower had
already begun to speak with
athletes, explaining his
philosophy about the sport.
When he left the Farm, As
sociate Athletic Director Doug
Single was named interim coach
to keep the recruiting as smooth
as possible (NCAA rules specify
that only a coach can recruit). As

to the consequence of the change
on the drive Single said, "It (the
coaching change) does affect re
cruiting, as much as we would
like to say that it doesn't. All the
athletes are concerned about
their football career, and with
the change they weren't able to
finalize their plans. Other
schools would use that against
us."
He also noted that when the
change transpired half the re
cruits kept their interest in Stan
ford because of its prestigious
reputation.
The appointment of Paul Wig
gin as new head coach helped
matters, but it also forced, the
mentor into a new role, since re
cruiting experience was missing
from his background. After re
ceiving a crash course from
Single on the subject, Wiggin
took to the road and has been
visiting players ever since.
"Paul is going to be an excel
lent recruiter. He's dynamic, he
understands the institution, and
he can talk both academics and
football with anybody. I also
think he enjoys it," commented
Single.
As Wiggin is probably discov
ering, one drawback for a coach
is the intense traveling that re
cruiting entails. Between
January 1 and February 20, a
head coach will visit 40 athletes,
sometimes cramming five cities
in three days. This year the
traveling is even more extensive
due to the turnover in coaching
staff that occurred when Wiggin
assumed the head spot. Cur
rently five coaches are doing the
job formerly handled by 11 men.
Despite the irregularities that
cropped up this year, recruiting
is proceeding "very well," ac
cording to Single. Dowhower
had originally sought to deepen
the offensive and defensive lines
as well as the defensive secon
dary. The search is also on for a
kicker who will be groomed to

assume Ken Naber's chores after
his graduation next year.
Concerning the amount of ta
lent available. Single remarked
that it was a "fairly lean year" in
California, but average on a na
tional scale. This is a sharp con
trast to last year, which was de
scribed as exceptional. In terms
of recruiting Single said. "This
year may be substantially less
than last year."
As recent violations have been
greatly publicized, the NCAA
has established strict guidelines
for the process of recruiting.
School representatives are al
lowed three "face to face" con
tacts, of which visiting at home is
one. The athlete is permitted to
visit six institutions to help him
with his decision. Between June
and February, 60 prospective
players had taken a look at the
campus. These visits are struc
tured in such a way that the re
cruit's interests are emphasized.
One difference between Stan
ford and other schools is that
guests to the Farm usually stay
with a "host" player in his resi
dence. Other schools provide
lodgings in a hotel off campus.
This helps an athlete to gain a
sense of what campus life is like.
Scholarships are distributed
on the basis of athletic ability and
importance to the team. Usually
I 7 to 23 scholarships are given to
the new recruits, with the NCAA
limit set at 30. The total number
of players with scholarships on
the team can not exceed 90, ac
cording to the NCAA.
After the admissions board
makes its decisions, the recruits
are ranked by the coaches in
terms of athletic ability and im
portance to the team. After the
scholarships are offered, if a
player decides not to attend, the
offer is made to the next player in
line.
How does the school learn of
these players? There are three
sources. The primary one is a
survey in which 8000 question
naires are distributed, which
gives an indication of those not
academically qualified. The next
source involves national scout
ing services that are utilized by
most large schools. Finally, the
athletic department becomes
aware of players through alumni
contacts. Single pointed out that
any Stanford grad can be a con
tact. For example, Ralph David
son, publisher of Time magazine,
has helped locate several
players.

Although academics are stres
sed here more than at other
schools, the recruiting process is
about the same. Freshman quar
terback John Elway commented
about his recruitment, "The only
thing different is that you stay in
your host's room and get to meet
different people. Other schools
don't stress academics as much."
l ight end Chris Dresscl. also a
freshman, saw a bigger differ
ence. "They're a lot more low
key here. They don't tell you a
lot of bologna, they let you de
cide for yourself. UCLA prom
ised I'd play a lot for them the
first year, but you can't say some
thing like that until a player
proves himself," he said.
By Monday the admissions
board will have decided on its
list. By Wednesday, the coaches
will know just how well the
traveling and hard work have
paid off.

scholarships are offered, if a
player decides not to attend, the
offer is made to the next player in
line.
How does the school learn of
these players? There are three
sources. The primary one is a
survey in which 8000 question
naires are distributed, which
gives an indication of those not
academically qualified. The next
source involves national scout
ing services that are utilized by
most large schools. Finally, the
athletic department becomes
aware of players through alumni
contacts. Single pointed out that
any Stanford grad can be a con
tact. For example, Ralph David
son, publisher of Time magazine,
has helped locate several
players.

Although academics are stres
sed here more than at other
schools, the recruiting process is
about the same. Freshman quar
terback John Elway commented
about his recruitment, "The only
thing different is that you stay in
your host's room and get to meet
different people. Other schools
don't stress academics as much."
l ight end Chris Dresscl. also a
freshman, saw a bigger differ
ence. "They're a lot more low
key here. They don't tell you a
lot of bologna, they let you de
cide for yourself. UCLA prom
ised I'd play a lot for them the
first year, but you can't say some
thing like that until a player
proves himself," he said.
By Monday the admissions
board will have decided on its
list. By Wednesday, the coaches
will know just how well the
traveling and hard work have
paid off.
While most high school
seniors meticulously till out ap
plications and slave over rhetori
cal essays hoping to impress ad
missions boards, a certain group
of prep students are visited by
college representatives in their
homes, shown around campus,
and are told how their interests
will be served by attending that
school.
These are the athletic recruits,
unique prospects who can hope
to do as much for a school as the
school can do for them. This
symbiosis can be observed par
ticularly in football, where gifted
players receive exposure and
preparation for the pros while
working to ensure a winning sea
son for their college.
A week from today future
players will sign letters of intent
indicating which schools they
plan to attend. At most univer
sities the main obstacle is per
suading the recruit to play for
them.
Stanford coaches have an ad
ditional matter to contend with.
They must wait to see if a player
will be admitted before they can
offer scholarships or make prom
ises. Fortunately for the coaches,
the admissions board will decide
by this week on the list of players
who submitted applications.
After a player is notified by
Dean Hargadon he then makes
his decision.
One thing that could be on the
minds of Stanford's recruits is
the abrupt coaching transition
that occurred recently. Former
head coach Rod Dowhower had
already begun to speak with
athletes, explaining his
philosophy about the sport.
When he left the Farm, As
sociate Athletic Director Doug
Single was named interim coach
to keep the recruiting as smooth
as possible (NCAA rules specify
that only a coach can recruit). As

to the consequence of the change
on the drive Single said, "It (the
coaching change) does affect re
cruiting, as much as we would
like to say that it doesn't. All the
athletes are concerned about
their football career, and with
the change they weren't able to
finalize their plans. Other
schools would use that against
us."
He also noted that when the
change transpired half the re
cruits kept their interest in Stan
ford because of its prestigious
reputation.
The appointment of Paul Wig
gin as new head coach helped
matters, but it also forced, the
mentor into a new role, since re
cruiting experience was missing
from his background. After re
ceiving a crash course from
Single on the subject, Wiggin
took to the road and has been
visiting players ever since.
"Paul is going to be an excel
lent recruiter. He's dynamic, he
understands the institution, and
he can talk both academics and
football with anybody. I also
think he enjoys it," commented
Single.
As Wiggin is probably discov
ering, one drawback for a coach
is the intense traveling that re
cruiting entails. Between
January 1 and February 20, a
head coach will visit 40 athletes,
sometimes cramming five cities
in three days. This year the
traveling is even more extensive
due to the turnover in coaching
staff that occurred when Wiggin
assumed the head spot. Cur
rently five coaches are doing the
job formerly handled by 11 men.
Despite the irregularities that
cropped up this year, recruiting
is proceeding "very well," ac
cording to Single. Dowhower
had originally sought to deepen
the offensive and defensive lines
as well as the defensive secon
dary. The search is also on for a
kicker who will be groomed to

assume Ken Naber's chores after
his graduation next year.
Concerning the amount of ta
lent available. Single remarked
that it was a "fairly lean year" in
California, but average on a na
tional scale. This is a sharp con
trast to last year, which was de
scribed as exceptional. In terms
of recruiting Single said. "This
year may be substantially less
than last year."
As recent violations have been
greatly publicized, the NCAA
has established strict guidelines
for the process of recruiting.
School representatives are al
lowed three "face to face" con
tacts, of which visiting at home is
one. The athlete is permitted to
visit six institutions to help him
with his decision. Between June
and February, 60 prospective
players had taken a look at the
campus. These visits are struc
tured in such a way that the re
cruit's interests are emphasized.
One difference between Stan
ford and other schools is that
guests to the Farm usually stay
with a "host" player in his resi
dence. Other schools provide
lodgings in a hotel off campus.
This helps an athlete to gain a
sense of what campus life is like.
Scholarships are distributed
on the basis of athletic ability and
importance to the team. Usually
I 7 to 23 scholarships are given to
the new recruits, with the NCAA
limit set at 30. The total number
of players with scholarships on
the team can not exceed 90, ac
cording to the NCAA.
After the admissions board
makes its decisions, the recruits
are ranked by the coaches in
