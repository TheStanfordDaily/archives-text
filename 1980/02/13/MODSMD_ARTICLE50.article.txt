U.S. tries for foreign bases
WASHINGTON —The United States is close
to agreements for expanded American use of
naval and air facilities of Oman, Kenya and
Somalia following the return yesterday of a U.S.
team which visited those countries, according to
official sources.
The team, headed by Reginald Bartholomew,
director of political-military affairs for the State
Department, is the third such special mission in
two months to visit the three countries to investi
gate greater U.S. military use of their facilities.
All three countries had made clear in the ear
lier discussions that they were willing, in princi
ple. to grant the U.S. request. The latest Barth
olomew mission brought the negotiations much
nearer to completion, officials said.
The U.S. drive to improve its access to estab
lished facilities* in the area is part of the Carter
administration's planned military buildup in the
Indian Ocean on the perimeter of the strategic
and oil-rich Persian Gulf. The decision to seek
use of facilities in Oman. Kenya and Somalia was
made before the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
but has been given additional impetus by that
event and the announcement of U.S. determina
tion to protect the Persian Gulf against outside
force.
In return for expanded and more regular use of
their facilities — and in some cases, preposition
ing of U.S. Military supplies and equipment for
emergency use — the three countries are ex
pected to receive U.S. assistance, largely in the
form of credit sales of military gear. Details of the
sums involved in this and other aid have yet to be
agreed, officials said.
Several hundred U.S. personnel would be
stationed permanently at the facilities to support
American military operations. More than 100
Americans are likely to be stationed at Oman and
at Somalia, with a smaller number assigned to
facilitate U.S. •support operations in Kenya, ac
cording to sources.
Of the three sites involved. Oman is considered
to be the most important geographically, due to
its strategic location overlooking the Straits of
Hormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The
United States is expected to operate from Hasira
Island in the Arabian Sea. a former British base,
and from the port of Muscat.
Oman's ruler. Sultan Qaboos Bin Said, long
has sought a U.S. connection to replace the
British, who withdrew most of their forces from
the area a decade ago.
lOC rejects Moscow boycott
LAKE PLACID. N Y. — The Winter Olym
pics opened under a cloud yesterday with the
International Olympic Committee rejecting Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's proposal that the Summer
Games be moved out of Moscow and Carter in
turn demanding that the U.S. not send a team.
But one American memberot the lOC held out
hope that U.S. athletes might participate some
how despite the president's call late last night for
the U.S. Olympic Committee to reach a "prompt
decision against sending a team" to Moscow
Neither development was unexpected, nor was
Carter's announcement that the U.S. is working
with a number of other governments to set up
other international games for athletes who do not
go to Moscow.
As the first competition of the Winter Games
began yesterday the U.S. hockey team managed a
2-2 tie with Sweden thanks to a goal by defense
man Bill Baker with 27 seconds left. Canada,
Norway and Romania posted first-round hockey
victories.
After three days of discussions. lOC President
Lord Killanin announced that all 72 members
attending the pre-Olympic meeting had agreed
that the Summer Games should go on in Moscow
as scheduled. The action was taken despite Car

ter's threat to ask American Olympic officials not
to send a team if the Soviets refuse to pull their
troops out of Afghanistan before next Wednes
day.
Douglas Roby, one of the American members
on the lOC. said he thought American athletes
would go to Moscow somehow unless the U.S.
government took some drastic measures such as
canceling passports. USOC officials refused
com me nt i m med iatel y.
On another Olympic political front. New York
State's highest court cleared the way for the first
participation in the Games by Mainland China
since the 1949 communist revolution. The Court
of Appeals refused to strike down an lOC rule
requiring that the team from Taiwan must not
compete under the flag and anthem of the Repub
lic of China.
The rule was aimed at bringing in mainland
China, which already has athletes in the Olympic
Village. The Taiwan groupsaid it was considering
a further appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. So
far. they have been barred from the Village be
cause they refuse to use the name Taiwan and an
Olympic Committee flag as required by the lOC.
Attorney to plug Abscam leaks
WASHINGTON — The man Attorney Gen
eral Benjamin Civiletti appointed to head the
search for the source of news leaks about FBI
undercover investigations said yesterday he
might subpoena reporters and their notes it
necessary to find the culprits.
Richard Blumenthal. 33. the U.S. attorney for
Connecticut and a former reporter for the
Washington Post, told a news conference the
news leaks were "inexcusable and tragic" be
cause they endanger a sensiti\ e investigation and
might damage reputations needlessly.
The attorney general's concern was reflected in
his choice of a federal prosecutor with subpoena
powers to conduct the inquiry and in the Justice
Department's reported readiness to take the rare
step of administering lie detector tests to as many
as 200 of its employees.
Eight members of Congress and other state and
local public officials have been implicated in the
bureau's lb-month-old bribery investigation, in
which FBI undercover agents posing as represen
tatives of wealthy Arabs offered bribes in ex
change for promises of political influence.
Carter to speak on Iran crisis
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter is
expected to re\eal at a news conference tonight
whether he sees any hope for an imminent break
in the 102-day Iran hostage crisis, U.S. sources
said yesterday.
Announcement of the news conference came
amid rumors of a possible deal to free the Ameri
cans.
Except for saying that Carter will appear be
fore the press at <S p.m. (EST) and probably make
an unspecified opening statement, the administ
ration clamped a lid on all public statements
about the Iranian situation.
Some sources acknowledged that an Iranian
proposal for dealing with the hostage issue has
been under intensive study within the administra
tion for the past two days. They added that they
expect Carter to give his response to the Iranian
plan.
Earlier yesterday administration sources had
said he would not put himself in that position until
the administration had completed its analysis of
the Iranian proposal and had an indication of
whether it has the approval of Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini, Iran's ranking authority.
USSR warns Pakistan of'risks'

NEW DELHI. India — Foreign Minister An
drei Gromvko of the Soviet Union accused the

United States yesterday of subverting detente
and warned Pakistan it risks its independence by
backing America and China in the Afghanistan
crisis.
Pakistan will "undermine its position as an in
dependent state" it it allows the United States
and its allies to convert it into "a springboard for
further escalation of aggression" against pro-
Moscow Afghanistan. Gromy ko said in a speech
delivered at a banquet given in his honor by In
dia's Foreign Minister, P.V.N. Rao.
Gromyko's strong words came after a first
round of talks with Indian leaders on the Afghan
situation during an official two-day visit here.
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, a long-time friend
of Moscow, is making low-key efforts to defuse
the Afghanistan crisis and get the estimated
90,000 Soviet troops withdrawn from the
neighboring country.
If the Soviet foreign minister was persuaded by
the cautious and friendly statements of Gandhi
and Rao during their three hours of meetings, he
gave no indication.
Gromyko defended the Soviet intervention, at
tacked the United States and China and delivered
the warning to Pakistan, which is slated to receive
about $400 million in U.S. arms aid.
Soames cancels some elections
SALISBURY, Rhodesia —The British gover
nor moved yesterday to save the faltering cease
fire in Rhodesia by announcing new measures for
curbing massive intimidation of rural voters by
the competing black political parties.
In a proclamation to be issued today. Lord
Christopher Soames was expected to bar elec
tions in areas of great intimidation so that the,
remainder of the Rhodesians could carry out
"free and fair elections" leading to the country's
independence from Great Britain and valid black
majority rule.
A spokesman for Soames indicated that the
governor was trying to cope with the asserted
intimidating tactics being conducted by suppor
ters of guerrilla leader Robert Mugabe.
The spokesman. Kieran Prendergast, listed
parts of 20 election districts (out of a total of 54
in the country) where Soames might cancel voting
because of rampant cease-lire violations by
Mugabe supporters. The atmosphere of intimida
tion has made it impossible for all black political
candidates to campaign in these areas. Prender
gast said.
All the troubled areas are in eastern Rhodesia,
where Mugabe'sguerrillas have been most active.
Soames met with Mugabe late yesterday, and
Mugabe's aides later described the 90 minutes of
discussions as "very unfriendly."
The governor warned Mugabe to reduce his
campaign of electioneering violence in the east
ern countryside, and to bring about order among
his supporters. Although they have assembled in
"peace camps'' under nominal control of Com
monwealth peace-keeping forces, many Mugabe
guerrillas assertedly leave camps to campaign for
Mugabe votes.
PLO forces move south
JERUSALEM — Israeli military sources con
firmed yesterday that Palestine Liberation Or
ganization forces- in Lebanon are moving south
with tanks, supplied by the Soviet bloc and that
the move poses the threat of a new kind of war
fare along the Israeli border.
An Israeli source said that if the PLO uses
tanks against the Christian enclave in southern
Lebanon, which is supplied and supported by
Israel, " Israel will be obliged to act with its regu
lar forces."
The PLO has not been reported before to he
equipped with tanks. Israeli radio said that
PFO-manned tanks had been seen as far south as
Tyre. 12 miles from the Israeli border.

Observers here said that equipping the PL.O
with tanks was part of a heightening of tensions in
Lebanon apparently engineered by the Soviet
Union to draw attention from its takeover of
Afghanistan.
Israeli forces on the alert along this country's
northern border and Syrian forces which were
shifted to eastern Lebanon earlier this month are
now watching each other uneasily across a nar
rowing stretch of southern Lebanon. One source
said that the Syrians are only eight miles from
Israel at the closest point.
l ighting between Palestinians and Christian
rightist forces in the south has escalated in recent
days, with artillery exchanges, terrorist-style
bombings and the plating of land mines. Gunfire
has echoed along the length of the Israel-
Lebanon border.
U.S. wants 'total' withdrawal
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
national security adviser said Monday night that a
"token withdrawal" of Soviet troops from Af
ghanistan would not satisfy U.S. opposition to the
Soviet occupation.
Zbegniew Brzezinski, confirming earlier re
ports that the administration expected a "cosme
tic withdrawal of some of tho Russians occupy
ing Afghanistan, said the United States would
want such cutbacks to lead to a complete with
drawal.
I he president's chief foreign policy assistant in
effect confirmed reports from senior administra
tion officials over the weekend that a slight with
drawal to try to defuse Western opposition to the
occupation, could be expected.
El Salvador police attack office
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — Anti
terrorist police assaulted the Christian Democrat
Party headquarters yesterday, freeing 12 hos
tages during a gunfight that left one policeman
dead and three left-wing militants wounded, wit
nesses reported. About 100 leftists seized the
building and hostages two weeks ago.
The attack came several hours after four leftist
demonstrators were shot to death and more than
a dozen were wounded as they and others staged
a "victory" march that ended their week-long
occupation of the Education Ministry.
Left-wing extremists are still holding six hos
tages. including Ambassador Victor Sancez
Mesa, in the Spanish Embassy, and the police
attack raised new fears in Madrid that force might
be used in an effort to free them.
Security forces in neighboring Guatemala at
tacked the Spanish Embassy in Guatemela City
Jan. 31 when it was taken over by protesting
peasants and 37 persons perished in a fire that
broke out during the skirmish. Spain severed re
lations with Guatemala, and El Salvador's ruling
junta has assured Spanish officials force would
not be used to free the embassy captives here.
Christian Democrat leaders said none of the
hostages in the party headquarters was injured as
the anti-terrorist squad members charged into
the building, which was taken over Jan. 29 by
about 100 militants of the Feb. 28 popular
leagues.
