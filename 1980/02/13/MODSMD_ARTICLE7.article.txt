Supporters for President Jimmy Car
ter's plan to register IK- and 19-year
olds for the military draft were a silent
few both on the stage and in the audi
ence at a "town meeting" held here last
night.
More than 500 students showed up
at Kresge Auditorium for a session that
had been described by its sponsors as a
presentation of opposing viewpoints on
the registration reinstatement issue.
"It was a great teach-in, but a lousy
forum," complained Ron Boyer of
Stanford Against Conscription.
"The initial expectation for the
meeting was that a strong balance
would be presented," said Mike
Werner, director of the Speaker's
Bureau, which with the Council of
Presidents (COP) and the ASSU Se
nate. sponsored the event. "Unfortu
nately we had great difficulty finding
speakers for the pro-draft viewpoint."
The six speakers, which included
members of the University faculty. SRI
International and the Hoover Institu
tion. were unanimous in condemning

registration given the current political
situation.
"By calling for registration, Carter
was trying to project an image," said
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall. "People want the feeling that
there is a strong hand on the tiller. He's
trying to tell us that John Wayne is hack
in the White House."
Marshall said he saw no connection
between the invasion of Afghanistan
and the need to reinstitute registration.
He said he instead saw it as an attempt
by Carter to gain popularity.
Peter Schwarz of SRI International
agreed with Marshall that the Persian
Gulf is not essential to the United
States since only 7 to 8 percent of
America's total energy supply comes
from that region. He got a standing
ovation from the audience when he de
clared:
"Roughly 9K percent of the popula
tion wants to ask 2 percent to die for
their extravagance. . . . There are some
things worth fighting for. and these in
clude justice and personal liberty, but
they do not include air-conditioners
and hair dryers."
Several speakers pointed out that re
gardless of our economic interests in
Afghanistan, consideration should also
be given to the potential threat posed
to Western Europe by Soviet aggres
sion. Marshall said that U.S. allies have
remained calm, and neither Japan nor
Western Europe, both of whose major
oil interests lie in the Persian Gulf,
have mentioned sending soldiers to
Afghanistan.
One issue that concerned most of the
speakers was the futility of any Ameri
can attempt to repel a Soviet invasion
of the Persian Gulf with conventional
weapons.
The U.S. government does not have
the power to maintain the 2 to 3 million
man force that would be required to
