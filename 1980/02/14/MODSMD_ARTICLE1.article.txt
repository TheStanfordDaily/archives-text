From the Daily wire services
WASHINGTON â€” President Carter ex
pressed qualified support last night lor a Un
ited Nations commission to investigate the
reign of deposed Shah Mohammed Re/a
Pahliivi as a step toward securing the release
of American hostages being held in Iran.
Noting what he called "positive signs" in
ongoing secret negotiations tin the hostages
sei/ed during the takeover ol the U.S. hm
bassy in Tehran, Iran, 103 days ago, the presi
dent said he would agree to creation of "an
appropriate (U.N.) commission with a care
fully defined purpose." Such a commission, lie
said should be "consistent with our goals and
our essential international principles."
At the same time, Carter stuck by his dead
line of I eh. 2(1 lor a Soviet withdrawal from
Afghanistan if a U.S. boycott of the summer
Olympic Games in Moscow is to be avoided.
Even a Soviet withdrawal after I eh. 20 would
be unlikely to chantie the administration's

stand. Carter said.
Appearing at his first news conference in I I
weeks, the president did not comment on
widely circulated reports that the release of
the hostages was imminent. In an opening
statement, however, he did warn against "ex
cessive optimism."
The administration had insisted since milit
ants sei/ed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran Nov.
4 that the hostages must be freed before any
inquiry into Iranian complaints.
Carter did not reiterate this U.S.demand in
his statement.
The militants who occupy the embassy re
peated yesterday their demand for return of
the deposed shah to face trial. However. Ira
nian authorities have already indicated their
support for creation of a commission to con
sider grievances as an alternative.
U.N. Secretary General Kurt Waldheim has
been trying to work out a "package deal" in
which the Americans being held in Tehran
would be freed eventually if the United States

would support an international inquiry into
allegations brought against the shah by Ira
nian revolutionaries.
While other U.S. officials had said previ
ously that the Carter administration had ag
reed in principle to such a trade-off, the presi
dent's statement was the first time that he had
publicly linked release of the hostages to the
proposed U.N. commission.
"Over the past several weeks our efforts
and our activities have become particularly
delicate and intense,"the president said.
Saving that he would not elaborate. Carter
said: "I know that you and the American
people will understand that I cannot afford at
this delicate time to comment further upon
any specific efforts that may be under way or
any proposals that may be useful in ending this
crisis."
Carter specifically refused to discuss the
U.S. role in restoring the shah to the throne in
1953, saying that was "ancient history" and
that it was not appropriate for him to go into

something that happened long ago.
Iranian revolutionaries have declared that
before the hostages are released, the United
States must accept responsibility for its sup
port of the shah in the past and that it must
promise not to interfere again.
At the news conference. Carter said Sen.
Edward Kennedy (D-Mass). his challenger lor
the democratic presidential nomination, has
made statements "damaging to our country"
in criticizing policy on Iran and the Soviet
incursion into Afghanistan.
Challenging his rival. Carter said Kennedy's
statements "have not been true: they have not
been accurate and they have not helped our
country."
Kennedy has attacked Carter's strategy in
trying to gain release ol the hostages in
Tehran and contended that a weak foreign
policy encouraged the Soviets to move troops
into Afghanistan.
"This thrust of what lie has said throughout
the last few weeks is very damaging to our

country," Carter said, and to efforts to get the
hostages released and keep the peace.
Carter said he would not resume "normal
campaigning" until the hostages are released,
but he did not specifically rule out a debate
with his rival before then.
The president said he would not resume
"business as usual" until the hostages were
freed.
Carter repeated his position that the Soviet
Union must be made to pay a steep price lor
its military intervention in Afghanistan.
"We must convince the Soviet Union
through peaceful means," the president stres
sed. "that they cannot invade a neighboring
country with impunity."
Carter declared that "any further adven
turism"on the part of the Soviets would result
in "grave consequences" for that country.
"But the prime consideration that I have is
to make sure that the Soviets know that their
invasion is not acceptable," the president said.
"Through strength, we can maintain peace."
