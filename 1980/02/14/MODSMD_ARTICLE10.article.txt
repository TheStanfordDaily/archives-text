WASHINGTON (AP)
Three years after he was kid
napped by guerrillas in a South
American jungle. Peace Corps
worker Richard Starr is coming
home. He was released after
columnist Jack Anderson paid a
$250.000 ransom.
Starr, kidnapped on Valen
tine's Day, iy77. by the left
wing Colombian Armed Re
volutionary Forcds. was freed
over the weekend, the State
Department said.
He was to arrive in
Washington late yesterday.
Bob Sherman, a staff reporter
for Anderson, said the ransom
had been taken to Colombia last
weekend by Jack Mitchell,
another Anderson associate.
Anderson, who had become
involved at the request of
former Rep. Lloyd Meeds of
Washington state, was unavaila

ble for comment.
Starr, a 33-year-old biologist
from Edmonds, Wash., was
working at a research station
about SO miles southeast of
Bogota when about 50 guerrillas
attacked and took him and sev
eral others hostage.
Although the State Depart
ment said Starr had not been the
raiders* specific target, the guer
rillas issued a communique five
months later calling him a CIA
agent. The U.S. Embassy denied
that and said he had been re
searching ways to improve crop
vields.

The U.S. Embassy in Bogota
confirmed only that Starr was
free. Officials would not say if
ransom was paid. It was known,
however, that Mitchell had ar
rived there Saturday with
$250,000 in a suitcase. The
State Department was not in
volved in the ransom.
Last September, he had met
with intermediaries in Mexico
City and been told that was the
price for Starr's freedom. Sher
man said Anderson had bor
rowed the money and intended
to repay it through a public call
for donations.
