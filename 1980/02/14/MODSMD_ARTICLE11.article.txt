Short-lived jubilance
Members of the Taiwanese Olympic team display their flag in Lake Placid last week
following a New York court ruling that.the Taiwan team could carry its flag during
the opening ceremony of the Olympic games. Their jubilation was short-lived,
however, as the New York State Court of Appeals overruled the decision Tuesday,
thereby barring the use of the flag.
