# Grain embargo could hurt Soviet Union

WASHINGTON — Despite the U.S.
trade squeeze, more grain is reaching the
Soviet Union than had been expected a few
weeks ago. according to an Agriculture De
partment analysis.
But the Soviet Union's grain needs are
even greater and will begin to put severe
pressure on available supplies by this spring,
the report said Monday.
As it looks now. the Soviet Union will
import about 28 million metric tons of grain
from all foreign sources this year, some 3
million metric tons more than U.S. experts
had been predicting.
On Jan. 15. the department estimated the
Soviet Union's grain imports would be re
duced to about 25 million metric tons in
1979-80.
"A continuing reappraisal of amounts (of
grain) likely to be available to the USSR
from all origins prompted the increase in the
USSR import estimate," the department's
Foreign Agriculture Service said.
Before President Jimmy Carter an

nounced on Jan. 4 that U.S. grain shipments
to the Soviet Union would be sharply re
duced — including an embargo on 17 mill
ion metric tons that had been earmarked for
delivery this year — the department pro
jected Soviet imports at about 34 million
from all foreign sources.
A metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is
equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat or 39.4
bushels of corn.
Although the United States has received
support from other major exporting nations
in enforcing the grain squeeze on the Soviet
Union, department officials have admitted
for some time there will be "leakage" in the
system.
Grain shippers in Argentina, for example,
have reportedly been making deals with
Soviet buyers who, according to some ac
counts, have been offering premium prices
for Argentine grain.
Kven so, the new analysis said the Soviet
Union — which had a short harvest last year
— "is still expected to suffer a grain shortfall
during the latter stages" of the 1979-80
marketing year, which will end June 30.

"Of the total projected imports of around
28 million metric tons, nearly 60 percent
had been shipped to the USSR by early
January," the report said.
"Consequently, the slowdown of imports
due to the U.S. suspension of sales could
start to impact on the USSR as early as
March and will be most significant during
the April-June period prior to the new crop
harvest," it said.
" Despite the tight feed situation, reported
livestock inventories on Jan. 1, 1980, were
at record levels," the report said. "Adjust
ments in feeding rates and livestock inven
tories may be necessary as feed supplies
tighten."
Looking at the current crop situation in
the Soviet Union, the report said the
weather has been "generally good, with
moisture supplies improving in some reg
ions" where winter crops were planted last
fall under dry conditions.
"In the event that favorable conditions
continue, the 1980 Soviet winter-grain area
could parallel the large 1978 winter grain
area," it said.
