LONDON — The boys at
Eton, Britain's noted boarding
school for the sons of the very
rich, are protesting a new tuition
hike that may empty the pockets
of even their upper crust folks.
"There must be a limit to
what the majority of parents can
afford," declared an unsigned
editorial last week in the school
newspaper, Eton College
Chronicle, which is written by
students.
The young scholars have cal
led on the school to allow
families to "pay what they can"
towards the whopping yearly hill
of $7182, more than the charge
for room, board and tuition at
most U.S. universities.
Why is Eton, for 540 years a
breeding ground for lords,
dukes and prime ministers, sud
denly raising a generation of
penny-pinchers.
It did not happen overnight.
For years now, the school has
been in serious financial trouble.
In 1976 the unthinkable hap

pened — Eton's 1200 boys
began making their own beds as
well as dusting and sweeping
their rooms as an economy mea
sure to reduce the number of
chambermaids.
Worse, a recent Eton study
showed that the"the old school
tie" doesn't work as well as it
did — a place at the Top
People's school no longer
guarantees one of the Top
People's jobs.
In the latest blow, Eton pro
vost Lord Charteria announced
to surprised parents in a letters
that the school's annual tuition
would he increased by almost
$1400.
The main reason was a sub
stantial pay raise granted to
Eton masters. In addition, it
now costs $7000 a year just to
heat the buildings, located on a
campus in the shadow of
Windsor Castle, 22 miles from
London.
It's almost enough to send a
boy to rival Harrow. But not
quite. There is still a long wait
ing list to get into Eton, and

many families register their boys
at birth.
Recently a British newspaper
chronicled how a disabled Leeds
butcher sacrificed for years so
he could send his son to Eton.
He had decided that was the
only school for his boy after
reading a history of Eton just
after his son's birth.
By never smoking, never
going out for a pint of beer,
never owning a car and never
placing a bet. Edward McGlynn,
SK, paid pounds each week into
an insurance policy tor Adrian's
education. He couldn't work be
cause of an earlier head injury.
"I tried to put his name down
when he was 10 months, but it
was too late. So I knew I would
have to do it another way," the
father said, turning up his nose
at the local state school which is
tree.
Besides enrolling England's
better-connected families, the
school also takes in a small per
centage of "common" boys. Ad
rian, now 13. passed the com
mon entrance exam and was ac
cepted.
