# Frederickson journeys to Pakistan mount
## Doctor to tackle new heights

He doesn't expect it to be
easy.
Donald Frederickson, a 36-
year-old radiologist at the Med
ical Center, plans to scale Pakis
tan's 26,000-foot (iasherbrum
IV this summer, without bottled
oxygen and without porters at
the high altitudes.
It's going to be quite a chal
lenge for him and the six other
men on the climbing team, none
of whom have been above the
20,000-foot mark before.
"None of us is sure how we're
going to feel at the high al
titudes," Frederickson said in a
recent interview. "Things
change rapidly at 23,000 feet.
No* one live at those al
titudes for long periods of time
— that's why we'll be there for
as short a time as possible,
probably two weeks."
The peak lies in the
Klarakoram Range, overlooking
China. The only time it was suc
cessfully climbed was in 1958
when an Italian team tackled the
north ridge.
South ridge climh
This year's climbers, led by an
old friend of Frederickson's,
Steve Swenson, will be carrying
all the supplies up the south
ridge after they reach the
17,000 foot mark.
It's the old-fashioned way of
climbing, the way expeditions of

the 1920s and '30s used to scale
the Himalayan peaks — without
sherpas or porters.
Fredrickson thinks he'll enjoy
the climb more this way, if he
and his team do it all themselves
instead of being part of an ex
pedition where, as he puts it,
"success is just a matter of time,
of getting all the materials to the
successive camps and going up
and down the same trails carry
ing supplies."
Prevalent danger
But the thrill of being on their
own brings with it many dan
gers, such as the chance of being
caught in a storm without any
one knowing, running out of
food or fuel, or being injured at
the high altitudes with no 4 way of
getting back to a nearby camp.
There are no nearby camps.
"They say that if you break a
leg above 20,000 feet you're
dead. If you break an arm above
23,000 feet, you're dead.
There's just no way to spare the
manpower needed to get you
back down from those high al
titudes," Frederickson said.
One of the expedition mem
bers is a New England physician
who often accompanies moun
tain climbers onto the high
peaks. He'll be able to help in
case of frostbite or minor in
juries, Frederickson said.
Poor rescue service
There should also be other
climbers in the area who might

be able to contact "civilization"
and call in a Pakistan helicopter
crew to rescue a fallen climber.
Hut this "rescue service" isn't
as sophisticated as the ones in
the Alps or in Alaska, Fre
derickson said.
"It's unreliable, costly and
dangerous," he claimed.
Frederickson, who has never
been to the Himalayas, foresees
the endurance and the tricky
climb as being the most difficult
parts of the trip.
"We'll each be carrying only
about 50-pound loads, but it's
going to be a technical climb,
very steep and icy," he said.
" It's going to require a lot of the
skills I learned by climbing in
Yosemite."
Low pro
Frederickson is an old h;yid at
climbing in low altitudes. He's
scaled Yoscmite's El Capitan
several times, and he's con
quered peaks in Alaska. Argen
tina, the Alps and Peru. He said
last year's trip was his most dif
ficult climb so far — he scaled a
20,000-footer in the Andes.
But unlike the Pakistan peak
awaiting him in May. this one
was only four days away from
the nearest road, (iasherbrum
IV is more than 100 miles from
civilization.
The team will be leaving in
early May for Gasherbrum IV
and plans to be off the mountain
by the end of July. If the clim-

hers follow this schedule, they
should avoid the rainy season
which usually starts in August.
No stopping
II the monsoon does hit early,
the team members plan to keep
on with the climb, but at a much
slower pace.
"The snows get deep," Fre
derickson said. "It costs a lot of
time, and it's hard climbing."
The entire cost of the trip will
run about $40,000, much less
than the average cost for most
major expeditions.
But for Frederickson, the
Gasherbrum climb will only be a
start. After descending the
peak, lie hopes to travel on to
Nepal, Kashmir and the Alps on
a six-month tour. He's been
planning the trip for one and a
hall years, and he's quitting his
Stanford job to go.
I.ong avocation
112 rederickson has been a
mountain climber for about 20
years. As a boy. he hiked in the
mountains near his home in
Washington state.
He keeps in shape all year by
running, skiing during the
winter months and doing gym
nastics. He tries to go on one big
climbing trip each year,
"I haven't had a real grueling
experience yet." he said.
And lie's keeping his lingers
crossed that this won't be his
first.

the endurance and the tricky
climb as being the most difficult
parts of the trip.
"We'll each be carrying only
about 50-pound loads, but it's
going to be a technical climb,
very steep and icy," he said.
" It's going to require a lot of the
skills I learned by climbing in
Yosemite."
Low pro
Frederickson is an old h;yid at
climbing in low altitudes. He's
scaled Yoscmite's El Capitan
several times, and he's con
quered peaks in Alaska. Argen
tina, the Alps and Peru. He said
last year's trip was his most dif
ficult climb so far — he scaled a
20,000-footer in the Andes.
But unlike the Pakistan peak
awaiting him in May. this one
was only four days away from
the nearest road, (iasherbrum
IV is more than 100 miles from
civilization.
The team will be leaving in
early May for Gasherbrum IV
and plans to be off the mountain
by the end of July. If the clim-

hers follow this schedule, they
should avoid the rainy season
which usually starts in August.
No stopping
II the monsoon does hit early,
the team members plan to keep
on with the climb, but at a much
slower pace.
"The snows get deep," Fre
derickson said. "It costs a lot of
time, and it's hard climbing."
The entire cost of the trip will
run about $40,000, much less
than the average cost for most
major expeditions.
But for Frederickson, the
Gasherbrum climb will only be a
start. After descending the
peak, lie hopes to travel on to
Nepal, Kashmir and the Alps on
a six-month tour. He's been
planning the trip for one and a
hall years, and he's quitting his
Stanford job to go.
I.ong avocation
112 rederickson has been a
mountain climber for about 20
years. As a boy. he hiked in the
mountains near his home in
Washington state.
He keeps in shape all year by
running, skiing during the
winter months and doing gym
nastics. He tries to go on one big
climbing trip each year,
"I haven't had a real grueling
experience yet." he said.
And lie's keeping his lingers
crossed that this won't be his
first.

He doesn't expect it to be
easy.
Donald Frederickson, a 36-
year-old radiologist at the Med
ical Center, plans to scale Pakis
tan's 26,000-foot (iasherbrum
IV this summer, without bottled
oxygen and without porters at
the high altitudes.
It's going to be quite a chal
lenge for him and the six other
men on the climbing team, none
of whom have been above the
20,000-foot mark before.
"None of us is sure how we're
going to feel at the high al
titudes," Frederickson said in a
recent interview. "Things
change rapidly at 23,000 feet.
No* one live at those al
titudes for long periods of time
— that's why we'll be there for
as short a time as possible,
probably two weeks."
The peak lies in the
Klarakoram Range, overlooking
China. The only time it was suc
cessfully climbed was in 1958
when an Italian team tackled the
north ridge.
South ridge climh
This year's climbers, led by an
old friend of Frederickson's,
Steve Swenson, will be carrying
all the supplies up the south
ridge after they reach the
17,000 foot mark.
It's the old-fashioned way of
climbing, the way expeditions of

the 1920s and '30s used to scale
the Himalayan peaks — without
sherpas or porters.
Fredrickson thinks he'll enjoy
the climb more this way, if he
and his team do it all themselves
instead of being part of an ex
pedition where, as he puts it,
"success is just a matter of time,
of getting all the materials to the
successive camps and going up
and down the same trails carry
ing supplies."
Prevalent danger
But the thrill of being on their
own brings with it many dan
gers, such as the chance of being
caught in a storm without any
one knowing, running out of
food or fuel, or being injured at
the high altitudes with no 4 way of
getting back to a nearby camp.
There are no nearby camps.
"They say that if you break a
leg above 20,000 feet you're
dead. If you break an arm above
23,000 feet, you're dead.
There's just no way to spare the
manpower needed to get you
back down from those high al
titudes," Frederickson said.
One of the expedition mem
bers is a New England physician
who often accompanies moun
tain climbers onto the high
peaks. He'll be able to help in
case of frostbite or minor in
juries, Frederickson said.
Poor rescue service
There should also be other
climbers in the area who might

be able to contact "civilization"
and call in a Pakistan helicopter
crew to rescue a fallen climber.
Hut this "rescue service" isn't
as sophisticated as the ones in
the Alps or in Alaska, Fre
derickson said.
"It's unreliable, costly and
dangerous," he claimed.
