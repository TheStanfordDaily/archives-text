MIAMI — It st:iits with a simple ex
change ol cash.
A young marijuana user in Salt I.ake City
plunks down $50 lor an ounce ol Colombian
grass. A patron ol the New York City disco
scene deals out lour SI DO hills to pay tor a
night's cocaine high.
Street dealers skim oil their cut and pass
on the profits to couriers, young "blue-jean
millionaires" who collect thousands ol dol
lars in small bills and lerry the money to
South Florida.
There, federal officials say. cocaine and
marijuana lords launder billions ol dollars
through local banks before wiring profits to
"safe banks" in the Caribbean. South
America and Suit/eiland.
Miami is the dt ui; smuggling capital ol the
L nited States.
"There is no question the majority ol the
money flooding South Florida is coming
from the done traffic." said Allan I'rinule.

head of the federal Drug Enforcement Ad
ministration's Miami office.
Miami-area banks are "the financial cen
ters for the drug traffickers, the Wall Street
of the dopers," Pringle said.
The "blue-jean millionaires" have been
known to keep bank tellers busy lor hours
counting out suitcases full ot well-worn $20
and $100 bills. Narcotics officials sa\ they
work for well-connected kingpins who con
trol South Florida drug gangs.
"The general setup is a real company acts
as a front for the deposits." said Miami FBI
special agent in charge Arthur Nehrbass.
"The primary business, of course, is the
smuggling. But they do a moderate amount
of business as the shell company.
"The banksgenerally accept the money as
a deposit to \Y/ Corp.. and then it's trans
ferred out. either by wire or checks." he
said.
The drug ringleaders — including promi
nent members of South Florida society, ac
cording to Cringle — never dirty their hands
on the drugs or the cash.

A recent Treasury Department report
said a cash How stud\ in Federal Reserve
Banks in Jacksonville and Miami "clearly
indicates that disproportionately large vol
umes ot currency are flowing into Florida
from other states and. perhaps, from other
nations."
The Drug Enforcement Administ
ration report showed that in one instance,
an account in a Miami hank handled more
than !i>4 million in cash deposits in a single
month.
In an attempt to plug the flow ol drug
money in late the FBI and DEA
began Operation Banco, which is designed
to trace the cash through South Florida
hanks.
Investigative techniques used in Opera
tion Banco detected the Black Tuna drug
gang — one ol the nation's major smuggling
lings — when a large cash deposit was made
in a Miami Beach hank. Fight members of
the gang were com icted last week on a vari
ety ol charges. Three ot them could receive
life sentences.
