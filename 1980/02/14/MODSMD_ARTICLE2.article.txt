Staff Writer
Alter a 2 1 : hour debate marked by
heavy lobbying and occasional flaring
tempers, the ASSU Senate voted last
night to oppose President Jimmy Car
ter's draft registration proposals.
The vote was eight to seven with
two abstentions, in ta\ or of the resolu
tion proposed by Senators Jim Hsser
tnan and Augusto lailde. Concern
centered on the question ol whether
the role ol the senate is to lead or to
try to represent student opinion accu
rately.
The senate finally decided in favor
of the former position: "Whereas we
as senators should act as leaders of
student opinion in the absence of a
clear student consensus, therefore be
it resolved that the ASSU Senate op
poses President Carter's proposed
legislation lor registration."
Sen. Chris Greene led opposition to
the resolution, stating that the senate's
job is to enlighten students about the

issues hut not take a stand when
"Congress isn't exactly holding its
hreath" (waiting for the senate's re
solution ) ;md when student opinions is
ambiguous. Greene pointed to the re
sults of the telephone survey, which
according to Deputy Chair Yvonne
I lilt/, who coordinated the poll in con
junction with several faculty members
including a statistician, was 90 percent
accurate.
According to the poll ol 129 stu
dents. including graduates and under
graduates. 47 percent favored and 47
percent opposed Carter's registration
proposal, with 5 percent abstaining.
Although 52 percent s;tid that they
opposed registration specifically tor
men and women born in 1960 and
1961. 74 percent said they would re
gister it required. Only 40 percent said
they would comply it drafted, how
ever. with 29 percent refusing and 31
percent undecided.
Supporters o! the resolution em
phasized that 60 percent ol those pol
led wanted the senate to take a posi
tion on the issue. Alternate Sen.
Jonathan McCJee said "we are not ul
timately bound to represent the \ie\\s
of the students."
Council of Presidents member
Laura Mead informed the senate that
she was attending a meeting with Na
tional Security Council members in
Washington. D.C., tomorrow, and
urged the senate to adopt the resolu
tion which would "force the administ
ration to question their actions."
Conflicting statistics were reported
in the poll which was taken at the
ASSU Town Hall Tuesday nii>ht. In

that poll, 90 percent said they opposed
registration, and 71 percent said they
would not register tomorrow if they
were required to do so.
Those who opposed the resolution
cited the anti-registration bias ol the
speakers at the forum and the uncer
tainty as to the percentage of people at
the forum who were University stu
dents as factors casting doubts on the
validity of the survey.
Earlier in the evening, guest speaker
President Richard Lyman addressed
senate concerns. When asked about
his views on the registration proposal
and the University's role in this issue,
Lyman said that he thinks."we're in a
huge mess of overreaction."
He commented that although he
thinks Carter overreacted, he does not
see a lot of the anti-draft protest as
"constructive."
I le particularly cited the language of
anti-registration rally speakers David
Harris and Daniel Ellsberg as
counter-productive. Lyman said that
the University would comply with the
law in releasing information on stu
dents and informed the senate that he
was misquoted in U.S. News ami
World Report that reported the con
trary.

Staff Writer
Alter a 2 1 : hour debate marked by
heavy lobbying and occasional flaring
tempers, the ASSU Senate voted last
night to oppose President Jimmy Car
ter's draft registration proposals.
The vote was eight to seven with
two abstentions, in ta\ or of the resolu
tion proposed by Senators Jim Hsser
tnan and Augusto lailde. Concern
centered on the question ol whether
the role ol the senate is to lead or to
try to represent student opinion accu
rately.
The senate finally decided in favor
of the former position: "Whereas we
as senators should act as leaders of
student opinion in the absence of a
clear student consensus, therefore be
it resolved that the ASSU Senate op
poses President Carter's proposed
legislation lor registration."
Sen. Chris Greene led opposition to
the resolution, stating that the senate's
job is to enlighten students about the

issues hut not take a stand when
"Congress isn't exactly holding its
hreath" (waiting for the senate's re
solution ) ;md when student opinions is
ambiguous. Greene pointed to the re
sults of the telephone survey, which
according to Deputy Chair Yvonne
I lilt/, who coordinated the poll in con
junction with several faculty members
including a statistician, was 90 percent
accurate.
According to the poll ol 129 stu
dents. including graduates and under
graduates. 47 percent favored and 47
percent opposed Carter's registration
proposal, with 5 percent abstaining.
Although 52 percent s;tid that they
opposed registration specifically tor
men and women born in 1960 and
1961. 74 percent said they would re
gister it required. Only 40 percent said
they would comply it drafted, how
ever. with 29 percent refusing and 31
percent undecided.
Supporters o! the resolution em
phasized that 60 percent ol those pol
led wanted the senate to take a posi
tion on the issue. Alternate Sen.
Jonathan McCJee said "we are not ul
timately bound to represent the \ie\\s
of the students."
Council of Presidents member
Laura Mead informed the senate that
she was attending a meeting with Na
tional Security Council members in
Washington. D.C., tomorrow, and
urged the senate to adopt the resolu
tion which would "force the administ
ration to question their actions."
Conflicting statistics were reported
in the poll which was taken at the
ASSU Town Hall Tuesday nii>ht. In

that poll, 90 percent said they opposed
registration, and 71 percent said they
would not register tomorrow if they
were required to do so.
Those who opposed the resolution
cited the anti-registration bias ol the
speakers at the forum and the uncer
tainty as to the percentage of people at
the forum who were University stu
dents as factors casting doubts on the
validity of the survey.
