## 'Cruising' gross distortion of gay life 
### 
On January 2, seven high
school youths from New Jersey
were arrested alter a three-hour
rampage of violence through the
Greenwich Village section of
New York City, during which
they seriously injured about 15
people. Most of the \ictims.
though not all. were gav.
On February 15. the movie
Cruising opens in 515 theaters
across the country, including the
Aquarius Theater in downtown
Palo Alto.
These two events are not un
related. The incident in
Greewich Village is an example
of "queer-bashing."' Frustrated
young men reaffirm their mascu
linity through random assaults
on innocent gay men and wo
men.
This kind of violence occurs
all too regularly in gay com
munities everywhere. And it will
continue as long as much of our
culture instructs that gay men
and lesbians are less than hu
man, not "real" men or women,
not worthy of respect. Too many
young people get the message,
one way or another, that the ap
propriate response to homosex
uality is disgust, hate and vio
lence.
The movie Cruising will soon

become the most recent and
perhaps the most obscene
example of this kind of cultural
indoctrination.
Cruising is about a man who
stabs gav men to death while
having sex with them, and then
goes on to mutilate their bodies.
Al Pacino plays police rookie
Ste\e Burns, sent as a decoy into
New York's ga\ leather scene to
entrap the murderer. As he be
comes submerged in gay life.
Burns withdraws from his
woman lover. He begins to dis
cover his own homosexual feel
ings. and his psvche and that of
the killer begin to merge.
Burns finds the killer, murder
ing him in the killer's own grue
some style. for which he receives
a promotion. Finally, we learn
that Burns has gone on to mur
der the gay man to whom he had
been attracted. The movie ends
with Burns happily restored to
his heterosexual life, his gay
feelings exorcised.
Even this plot outline indi
cates why so many gay people
are angrv about the film. Cruis
ing savs that ga\ men who seek
casual sex are asking to be kil
led. Cruising says that violence
and death are kev elements of

gay sexuality. Cruising says that
murder is the cure for homosex
uality.
When Crusing opens in Palo
Alto on Friday, members of the
Stanford guy community will be
protesting at the theater. This
protest has several purposes.
First, we want the community to
be aware of the extent to which
we feel the film is a gross distor
tion of gay people's lives and
gay sexuality. William Fried
kin's fantasies about gay
sadomasochism ought not to be
accepted as an accurate por
trayal of even a part of the gay
community.
Second, we want to ensure
that anyone planning to see this
film is aware of the kind of pro
duct they will be supporting.
Our leaflets will ask everyone to
join with us in boycotting this
film.
Since the protests against
Cruising began last summer,
controversy has centered on
whether particular forms of pro
test were in violation of the First
Amendment rights of the mak
ers of the film. The filmmakers
have madti.repeated accusations
.ofÂ«prior censorship. We can only
speak for ourselves; when the
movie opens on Friday we will

do nothing to interfere with or
disrupt its showing. Also, the
film is no longer an unknown
property; it was first shown to
the critics on Feb. 4.
However, there is a real issue
of censorship which the release
of Cruising serves to underline.
The small group of people who
control the major Hollywood
studios steadfastly refuse to
produce movies which present
realistic human portrayals of gay
people. Gay men are cither
wimpy neurotics or we do not
exist at all. Lesbians, with the
obscene exception of the re
cently released Windows, have
been virtually invisible.
Cruising is the most explicit,
concentrated representation of
gay male sexuality ever to be
produced by an American
studio. There are not even a
handful of other films to counter
the impact which this movie will
have on the American percep
tion of gay people. However,
the picture presented could not
be further froaiahtt truth.
In Cruising gay men are not
shown as wimpy neurotics. Now
they are portrayed as violent,
sadistic, psychotics whose lives
are devoid of tenderness, caring,
affection and love. And if a few
gay people have to be knifed so
that a cop can restore his
heterosexuality, then so be it.
The demon must be exorcised at
all costs.
In the face of such an attack,
we cannot be silent. We hope
that members of the Stanford
community will choose not to
use their dollars to support this
film.
