Women in combat
Putting aside questions about
draft registration or the draft lor
a moment. I would like to take
issue with a statement in Mon
day's Daily, attributed to Rep.
Pete McCloskey. By stating that
a 115-pound woman cannot
possible match a INS-pound
man in combat, McCloskev
obscures the real question about
women in combat with a mis
conception about the means ol
waging modern warfare.
By seeking the right to till
combat billets, military women
are not necessarily saving that
they wish to join the infantry,
they are saying that they are wil
ling to accept a share ol the
danger inherent in any potential
warfare.
In most areas of the Navy and
Air Force today this is even
more obvious: a person's si/e is
of little importance to their abil
ity to perform a combat duty. In
fact, a I 15-pound woman pilot
ing a high-performance jet
fighter nia> Jiave some signific
ant advantages over her IKS
pound antagonist, due to weight
alone.
To take another view is akin
to saying that the placekicker or
quarterback on a football team
must be able to block as effec
tively as the most massive line
man. Football doesn't work that
way, and neither should the
armed forces.
A woman in the military must
be allowed to serve to the best
of her abilities, without artificial
limitations being imposed on
her. Such a policy could only re
sult in a stronger and more ef
fective military force.

Don't subsidize dues
According to a recent article
{Daily, Feb. 6), a Stanford
alumna donated $4000 to the
Stanford Karate Club "to be
used to encourage women to par
ticipate in the martial arts prog
ram." The article quotes club
representative George Peglow
as saying that the money will
likely be used to subsidize the
club dues of women who remain
in the club more than one quar
ter.
Am I to understand that the
Karate Club would charge diffe

rent dues according to the sex of
their participants? I cannot ac
cept this form of sexual discrimi
nation. The cluh should either I )
encourage female participation
through a more creative and less
sexist use ot the money, 2) ask
the benefactor to remove the
condition on the donation, or 3)
politely refuse the gift.
I don't wish to becloud the im
portance of self-defense instruc
tion for women, but sexist
policies only perpetuate the kind
ol societal situations that charac
terize women as\ ulnerable to at
tack. I think the benefactor de
serves better use ol her money
than subsidy of female dues.

Fight 'nice' words
Nice article. Hank {Daily,
heb. 11) It was nice to hear about
"nice."
I've gone to battle against the
word several times. During one
skirmish an ally sarcastically said
that "Marion is nice." and meant
Marion always remembers your
name.
She didn't say what "Have a
nice day!" meant, but "Gee
whiz! Hope you don't have to
exert any effort today!" is close
enough for me.

ASSU out of order
According to a recent article
in the Daily, the ASSU Senate
will vote on a resolution "to send
Carter a letter informing him
that Stanford University is
against the draft." My objections
to this motion are twofold.
First, politics is about choice,
and this resolution does not pre
sent a clear choice, so the result
of the vote may be very mislead
ing. Its proponents form a
heterogeneous group consisting
of Libertarians, who insist on hav
ing the right to lose their free
dom; isolationists, who fail to
realize that the problem is not
how to isolate totalitarianism
from democracy, but how to iso
late democracy from to
talitarianism; pacifists, who have
not yet discovered that it takes
to prevent a war; and so on.
Such heterogeneity sometimes

leads to a so-called voting
paradox, as the following exam
ple may illustrate. Suppose that
10 percent of the voters are
pacifists and want to abolish the
army. 45 percent are in favorofa
volunteer army, and 45 percent
are in favor of the draft.
When confronted with the
simple question "Are you in
favor of an army with conscript
soldiers?" or "Are you in favor
of an army without conscript sol
diers?", a 55 percent majority
would answer in the negative in
either case, prompting the be
wildered government to abolish
the army against the wishes of
perhaps 90 percent of the voters,
who did not have a real choice.
Second, according to a pol
icy adopted by the Stanford
Board of Trustees, "all students
are required to become members
of the Associated Students of
Stanford University, which rep
resents them with respect to stu
dent affairs on campus. The stu
dent government. under this pol
icy, is not authorized to speak for
students on other matters." This
seems to imply that the resolu
tion is out of order!

Post cards insulting
Recently Jews for Jesus has
been sending unsolicited post
cards to Jewish students in an at
tempt to convert Jews to their
style of "Christianity."
We feel that in a democratic
and free society one's personal
beliefs should not constantly he
subject to attack. Jews for Jesus
has been annoying members of
the Stanford Jewish community
by handing out their literature,
which misrepresents Jewish be
lief, for quite awhile. But. this
latest action is an insult to our
beliefs and reeks of harassment.
We would appreciate anyone
who has received a post card to
bring it to the Hillel office and
register your complaint. Hillel
will forward the cards to the
Anti-Defamation League of
B'nai B'rith, who will proceed
with any necessary further ac
tion.
