# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Aleen Zimberoff Plug into politics network 
### 
Today is the advertised deadline for students in
terested in summer internships in Washington
r D O C. to submit applications to Stanford-in-
Government (SIG). Each winter, four hoard
members journey back to the snowy capitol and
for positions in D.C. toting resumes and
writing samples and other assorted CPPC-type
materials. Surprisingly enough, only 35 applica
tions have been submitted. 1 find this incredible.
A summer in Washington is an invaluable op
portunity to plug into the political network, often
static but a rewardingly electric experience.
Though many come back a bit disillusioned after
Xeroxing one too many bureaucratic memos, a
ride with oY Ted to the Senate floor quickly erases
the mundane memories.
Unfortunately, the horror stories of interns
doing research on how to make the best Folger's
coffee for the senator or getting an engraved bus
iness card after opening their three-thousandth
piece of constituent mail taint the more realistic
experiences shared by the majority of Stanford
students.
I worked for Max Baucus, a senator from Mon
tana who looked more comfortable framed by the
grasslands and grazing buffalo pictured on the
walls than by the flashing photographers eager to
capture his boyish smile.
The office was small, congested but friendly —
the type of busy that mingles legislative procedure
with weekend plans and I felt "important" enough
even before 1 was assigned my personal phone,
desk and low-and-behold, a mailbox. I worked for
the press secretary, drafting some releases and
using the WATS line to announce grant alloca
tions. 1 rode home past Rosalynn and Jimmy, ate
lunch with Bill "Early Date" Kemmeries and par
tied with preppies from Harvard and Princeton. I
wrote constituent letters to a man who wanted to
deploy missiles in the Milwaukee Railroad and a
woman who wanted laetrile legalized. No, 1 didn't
know what the Milwaukee Railroad was; that's
the point!
A political science course cannot possibly teach
you like an afternoon spent listening in the House
Gallery, a morning taking notes at a Foreign Rela
tions Committee and a late night scanning possi
ble amendments for your representative's bill.
And no, it's not all glamorous. The mail needs to
be filed, the reports stapled, the phone answered.
But the educational process continues whether on
a tour of the White House or the card catalogue of
the Library of Congress. You cannot escape any
aspect of "politics" and therefore you understand
it. 1 went further. I appreciated it.
If all these terrific components are waiting to be
exploited, why have only 35 people been so en
lightened to the possibilities? Probably because of
the myriad of myths that surround the whole no
tion of applying for, and actually getting, the in
ternship. These inaccurate beliefs build a bar
ricade that discourages students from exploring
the ideas and following through with their applica
tions.

"I can't get a job, I don't have any connec
tions." Who needs connections? If your second
cousin's aunt's butcher is the illegitimate daughter
of the janitor that empties the garbage in the
office you are aspiring to, you've got the job.
Actually, a thorough resume, coherent cover let
ter and investment in a long distance phone call
will usually do the trick.
"None of the jobs pay and I can't afford to
volunteer." Two errors in that rumor — many of
the Congressional offices are funded by a scholar
ship set up by Lyndon Johnson and pay up to
$6NO a month. The SIG office resource have a
list of such offices and the availability of funds. If
you live in the specific district your chances of
compensation are increased. Second, the SIG
Board awards financial aid to qualified recipients
in accordance with University policies. If you
qualify for financial aid, you can receive money
from SIG.
"I'm not qualified. I've never done anything
political before." Utter nonsense. A good attitude
and punctual good morning improve your candi
dacy more than a 3.9 GPA. The offices rely on
interns to take up the slack and a positive disposi
tion and knack for investigation (not too much,
especially into glove compartments) will be a val
uable asset. The fact that you have not been polit
ical might be the overriding reason they decide to
hire you! "You never get a chance to meet the
senator, what's the point of going?" Not only was
I afforded a super opportunity to witness first
hand the down-to-earthness of his lifestyle after
house-sitting for him one weekend (his son's
finger paintings are exhibited on their living room
wall), I spoke with Max almost daily.
He made it a point of stopping at my desk for a
quick hello, nothing earth-shattering, but it
created an atmosphere of support and coopera
tion instead of competition. Max came out to our
office party, played softball out in left field (a
position too many politicians play professionally
perhaps) and always acknowleged the contribu
tions of his staff members.
Some representatives whisk by in their wing
tipped shoes, tightly buttoned Brooks Brothers
and nod a stern good morning. But, it is possible
to ask around the D.C. veterans and choose a
comfortably informal office.
"Washington is too hot in the summer." Well,
that is the truth. If you've been skeptical about an
internship because of the climate, don't even
waste the 15 cent stamp. The encouraging DJ's
welcome each day with the exciting report that it
will be 95 degrees with 99 percent humidity. I do
use Dial, and yes, I wish everybody else did too.
All kidding aside, it is a fantastic experience. If
anyone has been considering this type of summer,
race down to the Old Firehouse and try to catch
a board member. Thirty-six is a very lucky
number.
