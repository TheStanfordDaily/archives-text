## Integration, not white guilt 
### 
Chris Moylun's "Affirmative
action: need not race" (Daily,
Feb. 8) is a disturbing example
of the uninformed defensive
posturing and naive analysis that
have contributed to the con
troversy and misunderstanding
surrounding the affirmative ac
tion issue.
The purpose of affirmative ac
tion is not to make white
Anglo-Saxon Protestants
(WASP) feel unnecessarily
guilty for the misdoings of their
ancestors against virtually every
other racial, ethnic and religious
group in the history of this coun
try. Guilt by itself cannot change
the past.

The purpose of affirmative ac
tion is in fact multi face ted: (e.g.
medical, legal) to attend to the
needs of minority communities,
cross-and inter-cultural educa
tion for whites and minorities
via the heterogeneous student
body, and opportunities for
minority participation at all
levels of society — participation
which has been denied because
of past laws/codes and current
beliefs and de facto practices.
Assuming that only qualified
white and minority candidates
(as determined by those who do
the selecting) are considered for
jobs or admissions, affirmative
action seeks to assist those who
are disadvantaged. The disad
vantaged minority is a group
that can show long term disad
vantage (jobs, education, oppor
tunity, etc.) due to race or
ethnicity, as well as current un
derrepresentation in positions of
power and influence. Whereas
non-Anglo-Saxon, non-
Protestant European immig
rants experienced persecution
and discrimination, they cannot
be confused or compared with
the disadvantaged minorites, as
Moylan has attempted to argue.
The differences between the
groups are significant and obvi
ous: European immigrant
groups have historically been
and are now identified as white,
therefore discrimination against
them based on skin color was
and is nonexistent. Today, de
scendents of the non-Anglo-
Saxon Protestant European
immigrants frequently live in
the same neighborhoods as
WASPs, educate their children
at the same schools, associate in
the same social circles and often
intermarry with WASPs without
incident.
The non-Anglo-Saxon Pro
testant's disadvantage in Ameri
can society was short-term; cur
rently, the descendants of these
European immigrants arc not
undcrreprcsented in positions of
political, social and economic
power and influence. The same,
however, is not true for His
panics, blacks, Asians and na
tive Americans. Thus, Moylan's

attempt to equate the European
immigrants with disadvantaged
minorities and "lace off the
Irish Catholics vs. the blacks or
the Italians vs. the native
Americans is misleading and
downright silly.
Perhaps Moylan's most unfor
tunate error lies in his assertion
that the University doesn't
"owe" him anything, because it
does: an education in racial real
ity.
As most students and admis
sions officers know, college stu
dents tend to learn more from
each other than in their
academics. The heterogeneous
student body is essential to a
cultural education, particularly
in the case of white students. A
campus with students from vari
ous racial, ethnic, religious and
economic backgrounds can fos
ter the shared experiences and
relationships that open minds
and transcend prejudice.
Moylan claims that affirma
tive action should be given to
"those who really need it — the
poor." But what would an ad
missions policy based solely on
income do for your education,
Chris Moylan? Teach you that
all blacks are poor and ghet
toized? Reinforce your
stereotypes rather than give you
a healthy dose of reality? Ha
ven't you overlooked the fact
that minorities can and do learn
from each other - rich from
poor, rural from urban and vice
versa — just as whites do?
Affirmative action doesn't
seek to elicit white guilt or rein
force stereotypes, but to offer
the indispensable cultural edu
cation through interaction, give
opportunity to the disadvan
taged and bring minority leader
ship to the minority community.
True, the program will change
as progress dictates — but ac
complishment of its goals, in
light of the dismal past and in
creasingly hostile present, is a
very heavy order. On the con
trary, the end of affirmative ac
tion isn't "around the corner."
It's only just beginning.

which has been denied because
of past laws/codes and current
beliefs and de facto practices.
Assuming that only qualified
white and minority candidates
(as determined by those who do
the selecting) are considered for
jobs or admissions, affirmative
action seeks to assist those who
are disadvantaged. The disad
vantaged minority is a group
that can show long term disad
vantage (jobs, education, oppor
tunity, etc.) due to race or
ethnicity, as well as current un
derrepresentation in positions of
power and influence. Whereas
non-Anglo-Saxon, non-
Protestant European immig
rants experienced persecution
and discrimination, they cannot
be confused or compared with
the disadvantaged minorites, as
Moylan has attempted to argue.
The differences between the
groups are significant and obvi
ous: European immigrant
groups have historically been
and are now identified as white,
therefore discrimination against
them based on skin color was
and is nonexistent. Today, de
scendents of the non-Anglo-
Saxon Protestant European
immigrants frequently live in
the same neighborhoods as
WASPs, educate their children
at the same schools, associate in
the same social circles and often
intermarry with WASPs without
incident.
The non-Anglo-Saxon Pro
testant's disadvantage in Ameri
can society was short-term; cur
rently, the descendants of these
European immigrants arc not
undcrreprcsented in positions of
political, social and economic
power and influence. The same,
however, is not true for His
panics, blacks, Asians and na
tive Americans. Thus, Moylan's

attempt to equate the European
immigrants with disadvantaged
minorities and "lace off the
Irish Catholics vs. the blacks or
the Italians vs. the native
Americans is misleading and
downright silly.
Perhaps Moylan's most unfor
tunate error lies in his assertion
that the University doesn't
"owe" him anything, because it
does: an education in racial real
ity.
As most students and admis
sions officers know, college stu
dents tend to learn more from
each other than in their
academics. The heterogeneous
student body is essential to a
cultural education, particularly
in the case of white students. A
campus with students from vari
ous racial, ethnic, religious and
economic backgrounds can fos
ter the shared experiences and
relationships that open minds
and transcend prejudice.
Moylan claims that affirma
tive action should be given to
"those who really need it — the
poor." But what would an ad
missions policy based solely on
income do for your education,
Chris Moylan? Teach you that
all blacks are poor and ghet
toized? Reinforce your
stereotypes rather than give you
a healthy dose of reality? Ha
ven't you overlooked the fact
that minorities can and do learn
from each other - rich from
poor, rural from urban and vice
versa — just as whites do?
Affirmative action doesn't
seek to elicit white guilt or rein
force stereotypes, but to offer
the indispensable cultural edu
cation through interaction, give
opportunity to the disadvan
taged and bring minority leader
ship to the minority community.
True, the program will change
as progress dictates — but ac
complishment of its goals, in
light of the dismal past and in
creasingly hostile present, is a
very heavy order. On the con
trary, the end of affirmative ac
tion isn't "around the corner."
It's only just beginning.

Chris Moylun's "Affirmative
action: need not race" (Daily,
Feb. 8) is a disturbing example
of the uninformed defensive
posturing and naive analysis that
have contributed to the con
troversy and misunderstanding
surrounding the affirmative ac
tion issue.
The purpose of affirmative ac
tion is not to make white
Anglo-Saxon Protestants
(WASP) feel unnecessarily
guilty for the misdoings of their
ancestors against virtually every
other racial, ethnic and religious
group in the history of this coun
try. Guilt by itself cannot change
the past.

The purpose of affirmative ac
tion is in fact multi face ted: (e.g.
medical, legal) to attend to the
needs of minority communities,
cross-and inter-cultural educa
tion for whites and minorities
via the heterogeneous student
body, and opportunities for
minority participation at all
levels of society — participation
which has been denied because
of past laws/codes and current
beliefs and de facto practices.
Assuming that only qualified
white and minority candidates
(as determined by those who do
the selecting) are considered for
