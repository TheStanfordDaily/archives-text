# P.A. Council dumps building ban proposal

By a 6-3 vote, the Palo Alto City
Council Tuesday night struck down a
proposed emergency moratorium on
building permits for new business
facilities.
T he moratorium was recommended
by both the Planning Commission and
the Palo Alto I lousing Corporation, to
provide temporary relief from a grow
ing area imbalance in jobs and hous
ing.
Instead, the council voted unanim
ously to send the matter back to the
Planning Commission for more study.
The commission was asked to de
termine the suitability of re/oning cer
tain industrial and commercial lands to
residential, to consider other measures
to mitigate the imbalance and to look
at the feasibility of forming a commun
ity task force to attack the problem.
About 20 local citizens, most of
them businessmen opposing the
moratorium, waited until late Tuesday
night to address the council.
The proposal was "going to hurt a
number of long-range programs" of
expansion, Varian Associates Board
Chairman E.L. Gin/ton said.
Varian plans to build its new corpo
rate headquarters on Page Mill Road
and two smaller construction projects
have already been approved, Gin/ton
said.
The moratorium would have ban
ned new permit applications for in
dustrial facilities over 25,000 square
feet and commercial facilities over
5000 square feet, until the new Palo
Alto Comprehensive Plan is com
pleted this summer.
"We're suffering from tremendous
imbalances in housing, transportation

and the environment," Stanford Law
Prof. Robert Girard said, claiming that
a moratorium would have been a
"sensible first step to freeze things
until a more general plan can be
worked out."
There are now 27,000 housing units
in Palo Alto and a total of 78,000 jobs.
This imbalance requires many
employees to commute from areas as
far away as Gilroy and Santa Cruz
which proponents of the moratorium
say is causing increasing traffic and air
pollution problems.
Girard served on the Santa Clara
County Industry and Housing Man
agement Task Force, which recom
mended last November that "severe
actions be taken including a
moratorium" if local governments and
industry failed to bring job growth into
line with housing growth.
"Each city seeks to maximize its
own interests. But in the long run
everybody loses," Girard said.
lie explained that cities tend to en
courage business growth because it
costs little and brings in high revenues.
At the same time, housing is discour
aged because it requires more costly
services than businesses, he said.
"Palo Alto has done more to al
leviate the imbalance than other cities,
but it hasn't worked." Palo Alto Prin
cipal Planner George Zimmerman
said.
Bob Williams, general manager of
Rickey's Hyatt House on El Camino
Real, said the situation has already
started to change for the better.
1 le said many corporations are mov
ing their manufacturing operations to
less crowded areas, but keeping their
headquarters here, where they can
take advantage of the "talented
people" at the Universitv.
