A certain number of rock, and
roll followers can he called the
■'I remember when . . group.
These few are always read) to
make others blind with envy by
talking about the time they saw
Jimi Hendrix in a 200-seat hall
for $2: or when they walked into
a small English club and saw
The Who before anyone really
knew about them.
One ol the best ways to be
come a member of this elite
group is to catch up-and-coming
bands right when they are on the
verge of success. Such an oppor
tunity will come up Friday night
at the Tresidder Ballroom, as
England's The Specials and the
Bay Area's SVT play shows at 9
and 11:30. The Specials have
sold out virtually all of their
West Coast dates, but tickets do

remain for these ASSI Special
Events shows.
The Specials:
Britain's newest
sensation
From Coventry. England. The
Specials are the leading band ol
the latest trend 011 the British
rock scene: ska music. Ska is
upbeat reggae, a more cheerful
and danceable version ol the
Hob Marley sound. The Spe
cials' sound also contains a cer
tain punk flavor, because a few
of the members ot the seven
piece band have new-wave
backgrounds.
The band lormed back in
and by 147.5, it found it
selt touring with The Clash. Its
debut album, produced bv Elv is
Costello. came out last \ear. and
eventually took the band to the

top ot the British charts. Despite
being deluged by record
company people. The Specials
chose to remain on their own 2
Tone label, and to have their
material distributed through
Chrysalis Records.
I he Specials come 10 Palo
Alto after eight straight sold-out
shows 111 Los Angeles, and
another sold-out show at The
City in San Francisco. Like
many ol their shows in England,
a majority ol these gigs were
dominated by record-industry
people eager to find out about
the latest British musical sensa
tion: so. Friday night's show
should provide the band with a
looser atmosphere.
I he Specials certainly are not
a household name around cam
pus. but from the word that has

been going ;iround about this
British group, it looks as though
missing them could be quite a
mistake.
SVT: rock in its
purest form
"It's certainly better to have
people out there dancing than to
lui\e them sitting back in their
seats taking notes."
These are the words ot Jack
Casady, the former bassist with
Jefferson Airplane and Hot
Tuna, and currently with SVT. a
hand that has been tearing up
the Bay Area night-club circuit
tor the last few months.
SVT has been playing most ot
its gigs under the concept of a
"rock dance, which is supposed
to get people out of their chairs
and boogeying. Friday night's
crowd should find itselt doing

just this: first because few chairs
will he set up. and second, he
cause with the brand of high
energy rock and roll SVT plays,
it's difficult to stay seated.
The lour-piece band consists
ot Brian Marnell on guitar. Nick
Buck on keyboards. Paul /ahl
on drums, and C'asady on bass.
Airplane and Tuna fans might
he expecting a "Somebody to
I o\c or a "Keep Your Lamps
Primmed and Burning;" they'd
he better off to either leave the
past behind and come to the
show with an open mind, or to
skip the show all together.

SVT has established its own
musical direction, and the mem
bers have no desire to dwell on
their past exploits.
This not only applies to
Casady. Brian Marnell origi
nally played with many bands
going alter the Top 40 commer
cial sound, but he now sees
commercial music as "little
more than trying to sound like
someone else.
"You can always do a three
part Beatles harmony that will
sell, but with this band there's

no pressure to be commereial,
or to he anything lor that mat
ter.
"We've written 40 songs al
ready: as the weeks go by, we'll
just throw out some okl ones
and add some new ones. This
band is continually evolving.'
l ast summer, "Heart of
Stone," a song written by Mar
nell. began to get quite a bit ol
air play on Bay Area radio sta
tions. The song originally had
been on a demo tape, but be
cause ol the response it got. it
was made into a single.
The band had not expected

"Heart of Stone" to be so popu
lar, and even now it does not
always do the song li\e. because
the members feel it is better as a
studio song.
SVT generally goes through
about 15 songs within a 45-
minute to an hour set; this
stands in remarkable contrast to
Casady's days with Hot Tuna, in
which some ol the band s shows
would last up to six hours.
Casady, however, claims that
he uses up as much or more
energy in an hour set with this

band than lie did in a lour-hour
set with Tuna, and belie\es that
a short set can be more demand
ing.
"When you play for four
hours and go into a lot of long
improvisational solos, it's easy
to get la/y and repetitive. Hay
ing songs is a lot more challeng
ing than jamming endlessK. be
cause you simply can't doodle
around as much."
As for labeling the band,
many of the old-wave Airplane
types consider SV'T to be punk,
while many of the punk types
consider them to be commercial.

The members like to think ot
their music as pure rock and
roll, regardless of what one calls
them. SVT is bringing rock back
to its essentials, and showing
that three-minute songs need
not live and die on bubble-gum
rock stations.
