# The 						Greg Kihn Band
## 'Straight ahead, no smoke bombs needed' 
### 
On the eve of the release of its fifth al
bum, Glass House Rock, the Greg Kihn
Band will play the Tresidder Ballroom this
Saturday at Sand 10:30 p.m.
The band has been at the top of the local
club scene for quite some time, and now that
its brand of melodic power pop has again
returned to the airwaves, Kihn and com
pany seem on the verge of national success.
As Kihn said in a recent Daily interview,
the ingredients for his success "have been
simmering for a while." And the band cer
tainly hasn't been lacking in material.
From the Byrds-like flavor of its cover of
Bruce Springsteen's "For You" to the
lighter-than-air " Remember" to the dense,
English heavy metal sound of "Museum" or

"Roadrunner," Kihn and band incorporate
varied influences.
In Saturday's shows, Kihn is sure to play
much of the forthcoming Glass House Hock.
According to Kihn, "the new songs are a lot
thicker sounding, with guitars out front and
a heavier drum sound." Covers of the Yard
birds' "For Your Love" and Gene Pitney's
" The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"
complement the original numbers on the
forthcoming Elektra-Asylum release.
l or all the quality of thir studio work,
Kihn and band are most widely remembered
for their tight, ferocious stage shows.
Often starting with their excellent version
of Springsteen's '60s-sounding "Rendezv

ous," they deliver a well-paced profes
sional show that would blow many more
well-known bands off the stage.
Saturday's shows are an excellent oppor
tunity to catch an act headed for stardom
before it starts to headline the big halls.
The infectious, good-time style of the
Greg Kihn Band is surely compelling.
"Our idols are the basics of rock," Kihn
says. "We want to be a basic-diet band that
you can really get your teeth into, like Cre -
denee Clearwater Revival or The Who.
"Just straight ahead, no smoke bombs
needed. That's what we're shooting for right
now."
