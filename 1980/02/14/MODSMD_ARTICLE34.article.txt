# Crusaders

This woman sings witn
conviction. Iler full-bodied
voice is dazzling from a soft
ballad to a fast Junk number.
/ hope she sings a long open
ing set because Randy Craw
ford is no run-of-the-mill
female vocalist.
The Crusaders. Three de
cades of that southern bluesy
funk sound. You know who
and what they are so I won 't
waste any words. Maples
Pavilion, April 12, <S' p.m.
