# Sonny, Chick: jazz giants on the way
## 
### 
Are you in the mood for jazz?
Would you like to hear the top
practitioners of one of Ameri
ca's few original art forms? Or
would you be satisfied to just
party down to some funk?
It's all happening in the next
few months, courtesy of ASSU
Special Events and the Lively
Arts. These organizations have
finally managed to bring some
class acts to campus concert
halls.
Who's coming? Sonny Rollins
and Chick Corea, for starters.
Sonny Rollins
Saxophone giant Sonny Rol
lins comes to Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium on Feb. 22 at X p.m.
Rollins is a living legend. His
saxophone style has been of
paramount importance to the
development of modern jazz.
No living tenor player has had
more influence on melodic in
terpretation and improvisation.

But these historical niceties
don't say anything about his
playing. Rollins is a masterful
interpreter of melodies. He can
make anything sound good. In
fact, years ago he recorded an
album comprised of cowboy
songs, Way Out West. But check
it out! It sounds anything but
hokey.
Rollins is a musical alchemist.
He can take a traditionally
trashy song and brew it into
something meaningful. More
commonly, he brings out every
last golden drop of beauty from
an already precious melody.
Don't expect him to play it
straight, though. Any song in
the hands of Sonny Rollins be
comes his own tune: an original,
spontaneous arrangement. You
recognize what he's playing, cer
tainly, but Rollins' trademarks
will be stamped all over the
tune.

You never know what to ex
pect from Rollins. On Friday he
may play cuts from his new al
bum. Don't Ask, or he may say
the hell with it and play what
ever he and his band are keyed
up for. You may find lush
romantic ballads, up-tempo,
avant-garde hot houses, or even
some danceable funk. On his
new album one interesting,
tongue-in-cheek tune is called
"Disco Monk" —a reference to
another great jazz stylist — but
if you can figure out what disco
has to do with Thelonius let me
know, will ya"?
Rollin's unpredictability is
very refreshing and often
humorous. Besides his diverse
and occasionally odd choice of
material. Sonny likes to quote
extensively from old jazz stan
dards and show tunes. During
any of his improvisations you're
liable to hear bits and pieces of

tunes that you forgot had
existed. He keeps you on your
toes with his senses of humor
and wit.
Chick Corea
ASSU Special Events outdid
itself this year: Flora Purim and
Airto, Joe Pass, Les McCann,
and Ramsey Lewis — and Feb
ruary is not even half over. II
you missed that plethora of
good sounds don't pout; Chick
Corea is coming to town, 3 p.m.
March 9 in Memorial Au
ditorium.
Corea is the creator of his
own idiom. Since the first Re
turn To Forever Band featuring
bassist Stanley Clarke, he has
blended jazz with just about
every major musical genre, re
sulting in a highly original sound
that can only be described as
distinctively Chick's.
Lured at times by commer
ciality's bit! money bait, he has

occasionally stunted his creative
output to make his music more
accessible to the public. But,
Chick never lets himsell be
pigeon-holed into anything.
After a lew RTF fusion outings
he recorded an album of solo
acoustic piano. Later came duet
albums and tours with vibist
Gary Burton and pianist Herbie
Ha ncock.
Going from one musical set
ting to another keeps Corea's
music alive and growing. He is
dangerously creative in what
ever he does and the band he
has assembled for the Mem And
show should be no exception.
Joe Farrell will be on reed in
struments and nothing ought to
be said about Joe except that
you ought to get in touch with
his playing on Corea's album.
Light as a l eather.
