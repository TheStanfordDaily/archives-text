# Off-campus opera: 'La Traviata'
## 
### 
It's closer than you think. It is, in fact, near the corner ot
Middlefield and Embarcadero in Palo Alto.
That (the Palo Alto Community Theatre) is where the West Bay
Opera Association is putting on its production ot Giuseppe \ erdi's
La Traviata. The show is a must-see for opera butts, and an ought
to-go-see for everyone else.
La Traviata (literally, "the wayward woman") is the story ot a
young Parisian courtesan. Violetta, and the young Frenchman, Al
fredo. who tails in love with her. Soprano Betsy Bell Taylor is
convincing in her portrayal of Violetta, a role that runs the gamut ot
emotions as she tails in love with Altredo, leaves him tor his own
good, is denounced bv him, and finally reunites with him only to die
of tuberculosis.
At each stage in the plot, Taylor is secure in the part and acts with
authoritv and grace. Despite becoming somewhat piercing at the top
lit her range, and experiencing occasional intonation problems, she
is for the most part verv much in control ot both the role and her
voice.
Tenor James Thomas, as Altredo, also has some trouble in his
upper register, his voice having a tendency to sound a little forced
on the not infrequently stratospheric tenor notes. But well executed
phrasing, along with some very effective dynamics help make his a
good performance, nevertheless.
Leland Morine. as Alfiedo's father Ciiogio, delivers an unshaka

hie rendition here. His lull, rich baritone voice blends very well with
the other leads, noticeable particularly in his duet with Violetta
where he convinces her to leave Alfredo.
I he costuming, lighting and set design work together to give the
show some very colorful moments, especially the party scenes in the
first and second acts. The large, vocally strong chorus, with its
gambling, singing and dancing, provides a stark contrast to the
heavy emotions experienced by Violetta. Stage director Anne
Catherine Ewers has all the characters moving effectively, giving a
nice flow to each scene.
Music director James Setapen's orchestra is dynamically on target
throughout, l ull and supportive, but never overbearing, Setapen
manipulates Verdi's endless flow of melodies with, in between ,and
under the singers in a most artistic way.
In the final act, Violetta's tuberculosis has her bedridden. Al
fredo, accompanied by his father, returns to beg her forgiveness.
She does; they sing a beautiful duet and plan their future together.
But it is too late. Her weakness overcomes her, and she dies. These
last moments are very effective; a dimly lit stage, deeply emotional
music, and deliberate, thoughtful acting close off the opera on an
emotionally powerful note.
La Traviata plays tonight, tomorrow and Saturday night at 8:15.
