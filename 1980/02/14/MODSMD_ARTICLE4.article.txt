In a major move to countcr the
negative effects on faculty recruitment
of high housing costs in the Bay Area,
the administration has undertaken a
new program to help faculty members
finance their homes.
Called the faculty Coinvestment
Program, the plan would provide
second-mortgage money for faculty
who qualify through a complex plan
allowing extended, liberal payback op
tions.
The plan also poses some financial
risk to the University, according to
Vice President for Business and fi
nance William Mfissy.
The Board ol Trustees gave final
approval to the program Tuesday on a
one-year trial basis. Some $2 million
of endowment funds will he available
lor as many as 30 loans in the lirst
year.
One of a kind
The program — the lirst ol its kind
anywhere in the country — represents
a "major effort to make housing in this
area financially manageable for fa
culty." according to Vice President lor
Public Affairs Robert Rosenzweig. Me
called it "one of the most important
programs (for faculty recruitment) to
come along in a long time."
The program will allow loans of up

to two-thirds of the value of a home to
faculty who qualify. For the first time,
the University will help finance hous
ing for faculty that is not on campus,
according to Massy.
The maximum allowable loan will
decline with increasing value of the
home. Homes costing up to $150,000
would be eligible for a maximum of
two-thirds financing from the Univer
sity while homes valued at more than
$350,000 would be ineligible lor any
funding assistance.
First mortgage
I or homes off campus, the faculty
member will secure a first-mortgage
loan through a bank or savifigs and
loan.
On-campus houses will receive first
mortgages through the University be
cause Stanford does not permit out
side institutions, like banks, to hold a
lien on structures on University prop
erty.
In all cases, the University expects a
minimum 10-percent down payment
from the program participant.
Reaction to the program yesterday
was positive from deans who have
been hampered in recruitment efforts
in recent years.
Officials in the engineering, law.
education and humanities and sciences
schools said thev knew of instances in

which the inavailability and cost of
housing played a significant role in a
potential faculty member's decision
not to come here to teach.
Charles Meyers, dean of the Law
School, said the housing' issue is
"paramount in the minds of everybody
who is thinking of coming out here."
In the last three years, the Law
School has interviewed some 15 can
didates for four positions, and in some
cases the candidates have asked about
housing before they ask about salary,
Meyers said.
William Kays, dean of the Engineer
ing School, called the program "terri
bly important" and said it could be the
deciding factor for a few people the
University is currently negotiating
with for faculty appointments.
The problem is real. "It's almost
impossible to get housing around here
these days," Meyers said.
Substantial reduction
And housing that is available is so
expensive that faculty moving to this
area often must accept a "substantial
reduction in their standard of living."
according to Rosenzweig.
Over the past 10 years, the median
selling price of new single-family
homes nationwide rose 146 percent,
according to the Bureau of the Census.
Meanwhile, the estimated market

value of homes in Palo Alto has risen
302 percent over the same period, ac
cording to figures supplied hy the Real
Estate Research Council of Northern
California.
Because the figures do not measure
the exact thing, they are not directly
comparable, yet they illustrate the
housing price explosion in the region.
For example, a three-bedroom,
two-bath. 2069-square-foot home in
Palo Alto had a market value of about
$45,000 in 1969. By October 1979.
the estimated value had risen 309 per
cent to $1N4.000, the real estate coun
cil's 112 igures show. The average cost of
a home sold in Palo Alto last year was
in excess of $145,000.
Other types of housing show com
parable price increases.
Reluctant
Kays welcomed the program, saying
it will be especially helpful in recruit
ment of associate professors and
young full professors. These people
often have young families and have
worked to move up in the ranks
elsewhere. They often own their
home, and this makes them quite re
luctant to move, he said.
The housing situation is not such a
problem with assistant professors who
are more frequently unmarried and
willing to live in apartments.
"It is pretty much impossible to
move a young full professor to the
Santa Clara Valley at this time." Kays
said.
Massy said the University is pre
pared to begin negotiations on loans
immediately. Participants would be
limited to those now in the process of
coming to the University or at the
University less than three years who
do not already own a home.
The loans will be issued at the cur
rent federal funds interest rate plus 5
percent, making current loans 17 per
cent.
In return for lending the money, the
University becomes entitled to a share
of the increase in the home's value
equal to the share of the home's origi
nal price financed by the University.
Entitled
Thus, if the University financed 50
percent of the home, it would be enti
tled to 50 percent of the profits upon
sale.
But rather than automatically owing
the University its share of the profits
from the sale, the faculty member has
