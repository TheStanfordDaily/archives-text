# From 'P.O. box 'dropout' to student prince

"Why can't I get just one
lousy postcard, filling me in on
the hometown news? Oh well, it
looks like all I'm netting is the
P.O. Box Blues . . .
Last Year. Charlie the
Wimp's lament became the
theme song for manv victims of
"mailodrama." Is Gaieties'
Charlie still looking into that
empty mailbox? Has he bought
a lifetime subscription to nurd

Happily, or hoppily, frog
turns to prince next quarter.
Charlie. Marty Moran, is star
ring in Ram's Head's April
23-26 production of Pippin.
The energetic blond sopho
more has dropped out of school
to study acting, voice, tap, jazz,
modern dance and ballet.
President of "God, you name
it" in Denver, Moran came to
Stanford with an interest in poli
tics. But. involvement in several

campus stage productions and
the "discovery" of his 83-year
old actor uncle turned Moran on
to acting.
Politics and acting have much
in common, Moran said. The
key to both professions is sincer
ity.
"It there's a sincere politician
it strikes you in the gut .... In
acting, there's got to be the es
sence of realness, but on top you
put a lot of technique.
That technical effort is obvi
ous in Moran's preparation tor
hrole of Pippin. "I can take
the vocal work, movement
work, and acting work and plug
them right into Pippin. For me,
it's a giant experiment."
An actor's goal is to make a
part "so real that it's an entire
experience for the audience."
According to Moran, this re
quires the unlearning of bad
habits.
"When you bring a character

to life onstage, you are the tool.
It's you that you're using: your
experiences, your past, your
emotions."
Often, to achieve realism an
actor must search for latent
qualities. Such was Moran's ex
perience playing West Side
Story's Riff.
"There I was, the leader of a
New York street gang. I'd been
through 10 years of Catholic
school and was so damned shel
tered ... 1 thought, 'what am I
going to do?' I dug and found a
whole part of me that's Riff: an
gry, uptight, possessive."
If there's anything which an
gers this resonant-voiced actor,
it is the lack of respect — the
"tun and games" attitude to
ward art at Stanford.
'"It irked me when 1 came
here . . . there's a subtle oppres
sion of those who are artist
s ... If this university really
claims to be top-notch and

well-rounded, it has a responsi
bility to plug more money into
the arts.
"We forget that art is essen
tial. We've got to remind one
another that we're special, that
we re creative .... Somehow,
problem sets don't remind you
of being alive."
At the same time. Moran's
optimistic that the 'NOs will
bring a renaissance in the arts.
He cites the growth of regional
theater and the greater em
phasis on urban cultural centers.
"The '70s was a surface de
cade of skin flicks and facelifts.
A lot of people are realizing the
necessity of art as a celebration
of the human spirit and an af
firmation of what it is to be hu
man. what it is to be creators.
Part of Moran's personal
celebration is his love of acting.
"We have the power to create
our own reality and draw to our
selves what we expect.... 1 feel

that God calls me to be a per
former. It's a religious, a
spiritual thing."
The ambitious performer
hopes to become politically in
voked, like Jane Fonda or Alan
Alda. But more immediately,
his goals are "limitless; 1 want to
do nightclub singing, I want to
be in film and stage. I want to be
a speaker, and I want to fall in
love."
Next year he may move to an
eastern university with a strong
theater program. The former ski
instructor and avid mountain
climber admires the "serious
digging," "scrutiny" and "high
standards" ol eastern theater.
"I feel like Pippin," says its
lead. "I really identify with his
searching and trying to find ful
fillment in life. That's what
Marty Moran's trying to do, too.
I think we're all trying. But,
sometimes, we try to push it too
much. —Sue Feld

theater and the greater em
phasis on urban cultural centers.
"The '70s was a surface de

A lot of people are realizing the
necessity of art as a celebration
of the human spirit and an af

Part of Moran's personal
celebration is his love of acting.
"We have the power to create
our own reality and draw to our
selves what we expect.... 1 feel

that God calls me to be a per
former. It's a religious, a
spiritual thing."
The ambitious performer
hopes to become politically in
voked, like Jane Fonda or Alan
Alda. But more immediately,
his goals are "limitless; 1 want to
do nightclub singing, I want to
be in film and stage. I want to be
a speaker, and I want to fall in
love."
Next year he may move to an
eastern university with a strong
theater program. The former ski
instructor and avid mountain
climber admires the "serious
digging," "scrutiny" and "high
standards" ol eastern theater.
"I feel like Pippin," says its
lead. "I really identify with his
searching and trying to find ful
fillment in life. That's what
Marty Moran's trying to do, too.
I think we're all trying. But,
sometimes, we try to push it too
much. —Sue Feld

Last Year. Charlie the

Charlie. Marty Moran, is star
ring in Ram's Head's April
23-26 production of Pippin.
The energetic blond sopho
more has dropped out of school
to study acting, voice, tap, jazz,
modern dance and ballet.
President of "God, you name
it" in Denver, Moran came to
Stanford with an interest in poli
tics. But. involvement in several

campus stage productions and
the "discovery" of his 83-year
old actor uncle turned Moran on
to acting.
Politics and acting have much
in common, Moran said. The
key to both professions is sincer
ity.
"It there's a sincere politician
it strikes you in the gut .... In
acting, there's got to be the es
sence of realness, but on top you
put a lot of technique.
That technical effort is obvi
ous in Moran's preparation tor
hrole of Pippin. "I can take
the vocal work, movement
work, and acting work and plug
them right into Pippin. For me,
it's a giant experiment."
An actor's goal is to make a
part "so real that it's an entire
experience for the audience."
According to Moran, this re
quires the unlearning of bad
habits.
"When you bring a character

to life onstage, you are the tool.
It's you that you're using: your
experiences, your past, your
emotions."
Often, to achieve realism an
actor must search for latent
qualities. Such was Moran's ex
perience playing West Side
Story's Riff.
"There I was, the leader of a
New York street gang. I'd been
through 10 years of Catholic
school and was so damned shel
tered ... 1 thought, 'what am I
going to do?' I dug and found a
whole part of me that's Riff: an
gry, uptight, possessive."
If there's anything which an
gers this resonant-voiced actor,
it is the lack of respect — the
"tun and games" attitude to
ward art at Stanford.
'"It irked me when 1 came
here . . . there's a subtle oppres
sion of those who are artist
s ... If this university really
claims to be top-notch and

well-rounded, it has a responsi
bility to plug more money into
the arts.
"We forget that art is essen
tial. We've got to remind one
another that we're special, that
we re creative .... Somehow,
problem sets don't remind you
of being alive."
