Early Soviet withdrawal unlikely
The Soviet Union has advised key Asian, Euro
pean and African countries it will begin withdrawing
its estimated 90,000 troops Irom Afghanistan when
the situation stabilizes along the Afghanistan-
Pakistan border, and Afghanistan has proposed
talks with Pakistan, diplomats in London reported
yesterday.
A spokesman tor the Pakistani government said it
would welcome such talks but only after a complete
Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. who is
in New Delhi for talks, warned Pakistan that it it
wanted peace with Afghanistan it should end "intru
sions into the territory of Afghanistan." Indian offi
cials said Gromyko gave them no reason to believe
the Soviets plan to withdraw their troops soon.
Meanwhile, Egypt is training Afghan rebels in
guerrilla warfare and plans to arm them and send
them back to Afghanistan to combat Soviet inter
vention forces, the Egyptian defense minister dis
closed yesterday.
The Egyptian assistance, announced by Gen.
Kamal Hassan Ali at a news conference, under
scores President Anwar Sadat's growing willingness
to play an active role in U.S.-led security coopera
tion against Soviet moves in the Middle East and
South Asia. It tits mto an increasingly well-defined
pattern of official Egyptian eagerness to help pro-
Western forces in these regions and Africa, com
bined with an expanding U.S. commitment to outfit
the outdated Egyptian military for Sadat's regional
ambitions.
Religion only draft exemption
WASHINGTON — America's young men and
women looking for a sure way out of being drafted
will have to turn to religion, under President Jimim
Carter's registration proposal.
Bray ton Harris, spokesman tor the Selective Ser
vice System, said that unlike previous drafts when
there were many exemptions and determents, the
only automatic exemption it a draft occurs under
Carter's proposal would be "minister of religion."
"The theory is that any deferments and exemp
tions should be granted on the merits of the indi
vidual case, such as hardship or conscientious objec
tor." Harris said. "There will be no student deter
ments. no occupational deferments and no automa
tic determents lor family status, such as having chil
dren. I he only automatic exemption will be for
minister of religion."
Local dralt boards will make the decisions about
exemptions and determents. Harris said.
Plan proposed to free hostages
PARIS — President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr ot

lah Ruhollah Khomeini has accepted a three-point
"action plan" for the negotiated release ot the U.S.
hostages in Tehran.
But in an interview with the radio station France-
Inter. recorded Tuesday and broadcast yesterdav,
Bani-Sadr would not say whether he envisioned the
imminent release ot the hostages. "It is a possibility.
It depends." he said.
His remarks appeared to be the tirst indication
Khomeini had agreed to a new three-point plan Bani
Sadr has set forth in an effort to break the deadlock
over the approximately 50 hostages, who have been
held by Islamic militants at the U.S. Embassy since
Nov. 4.
As outlined by the newspaper, Bani-Sadr's prop
osal was that the Americans would be released it the

past 25 years.
Accepted Iran's "right" to extradite the shah
and his wealth.
— Promised not to interfere in Iranian affairs.

this week from a reactor at a Maryland nuclear
power plant, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

the leaks from one of the reactors ol the Baltimore
Gas & Electric Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant 45 miles

ot NRC limits and were considered to be negligible
