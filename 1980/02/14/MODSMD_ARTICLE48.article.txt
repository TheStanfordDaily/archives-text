Members of Stanford Students
for Kennedy will fly to New Hamp
shire tonight to walk precincts and
ring doorbells in an effort to.rally
support for Sen. Edward Ken
nedy s (D-Mass.) presidential cam
paign.
Group chairman Mark Agnew
and directors Alma Ribbs and
Bruce Shaver will spend the long
weekend "talking to people about
our reasons lor choosing Ken
nedy." and trying to swing the vote
in his tavor in the Feb. 2f> primary.
"We've become acutely aware of
the importance of the New Hamp
shire primary," said Agnew. "We
decided that maybe we'd better
help out now to make sure that
there is a next time." Ribbs agreed,
adding that, "we really need a
strong showing to make Kennedy a
viable candidate."
"Kennedy doesn't have to win in
'New Hampshire," said Sha\er.
"But we're going to do all we can
now because it (the campaign) is
not going to get any easier."
Shaver said he has been a Ken
nedy supporter for the past five
years and Agnew and Ribbs have

been involved in the senator's cam
paign since the group was first or
ganized on campus in the fall. They
have worked with Kennedy's stall
during his trips to the Bay Area,
and also at the California Democ
ratic Convention.
Although the group has been in
contact with the campaign head
quarters in the East, the idea for
the trip was then own. "It took a
lot ol initiative in the individual
level," said Agnew. Agnew, Ribbs
and Shaver are paying all their own
expenses.
When the group was first or
ganized. members discussed going
to lowa or helping out in othe*
areas, but the trips never
materialized. "Over Christmas,
when the international crises
started putting a haze over the
political scene, it affected a lot of
people." lie explained, and the
campaign began slowing down.
I he trip is a "symbolic gesture"
as well us a reflection of the group's
commitment. Shaver said.
"We helped to organize the
California straw vote, which Ken
nedy won, so maybe we can help in
New Hampshire." said Ribbs. "We
want to see Sen. Kennedy elected."
