## Libya's Tunisian venture may help U.S.

PARIS — Libya's backing tor
an abortive revolt in southern
Tunisia has proved to have a
positive side for the United
States in North Africa.
The Libyan move came just as
the Carter administration was
pressing for the U.S. Congress
to allow a controversial arms
sale to Morocco that has been
poisoning U.S. relations with
Algeria, fhe other major state in
North Africa.
Algeria's reaction was muted
as it became clear that in re
sponse to America's tough new
mood after Iran and Afghanis
tan. Congress would not block
the arms tor Algeria's rival.
There were the predictable
editorials in the Algerian press
but they threatened no reprisals
and left the door open for better
U.S.-Algerian relations.
The Libyan-inspired attack
on Tunisia, a country with twice
the popu'ation but one
liundredth the firepower of
Libya's Soviet-supplied arsenal:
has served as a catalyst for latent
trends.
Revolutionary Algeria, with
close ties to the Soviet Union,
quickly assured the Western
oriented Tunisians that it had
nothing to do with the attempt
at destabilization and would see
to it that the Libyans would
never again mount such an op
eration Irom Algerian soil. This
underlined the new Algerian
pragmatism in a strategic region
the United States has done rela
tively little to understand.
It is this same pragmatism
that helps to explain Algerian
restraint over U.S. arms for
Morocco.
A recent two-week tour of
Algeria and Tunisia turned up
signs of an Algerian willingness
to serve as the protector of
Tunisia against Libya and to be
a force for stability in the region.
Until Libyli changed the picture,
th «v United States, on which
Algeria was once clearly betting
as its best outlet to the West,

seemed to ha\e let itself be
outmaneuvered in North Africa
— a region that the 43 million
inhabitants proudly call the
Maghreb, the Arab word tor
"west."
The United States often acts
as if it is involved in the Mag
hreb in the East-West struggle
for influence with the Soviets.
This view, encouraged by
Morocco's King Hassan 11. often
seems to lead American
policymakers to ignore the reg
ional implications of local con
flicts.
Overlord
The East-West outlook ig
nores the continued influence of
France, the former colonial
overlord. In the Maghreb the
shared French language, educa
tion. culture and love-hate rela
tions with France are unifying
factors along with the region's
common Arab and Islamic iden
tity.
Algeria and Morocco are in
volved in a complicated East-
West equation. Algeria balances
off its almost complete depen
dence on Soviet arms with
commercial relations that find
the United States its major trad
ing partner.
Morocco, which depends
primarily on the United States
for arms, supplies the So\ iets
with the phosphates needed for
fertilizer. Soviet boats trawl in
tensively in Morocco's rich fish
ing waters.
Ever since the U.S. landing in
North Africa in 1942. French
citizens of all political stripes
have accused the United States
of wanting to displace France as
the leading Western influence in
the Maghreb.
Coinciding interests
Sometimes French and U.S.
interests coincide, as they did
two weeks ago when the French
airlifted Tunisian troops against
the Libyan-trained attackers in
the southern town of Gafsa and
the Carter administration an
nounced a speedup in arms for
Tunisia.

Just as often, French and
American interests seem to di
\erge.
French diplomats and politi
cians. with a wealth of colonial
experience, have intimate know
ledge not only of the rulers and
their entourages hut also of their
opponents and potential succes
sors that their U.S. counterparts
cannot begin to approach.
There are about 200,000
French teachers, technicians,
businessmen and their families
still in former French North Af
rica. About 1.5 million North
African immigrant workers and
their families li\e in France.
Suprise unlikely
France seems unlikely ever to
be surprised in the Maghreb the
way the United States was by
the Islamic political movement
against the shah in Iran.
It was against this backdrop
that France urged the United
States to heed King Hassan's
pleas for arms while France ph
ased itself out of the war bet
ween Morocco and the West
Saharan guerillas of the
Polisario Front, backed by
Algeria and Libya.
France apparently started
moving toward leaving the Un
ited States isolated in the Mag
hreb with Morocco almost two
years ago by halting its devastat
ing air strikes against the
Polisario. French-protected
Mauritania then dropped out of
the war and France proclaimed
its neutrality in the conflict.
Yet. only now that Congress
had cleared the way for the Un
ited States to send weapons to
Morocco, France says it was a
mistake for the Americans to
arm the king. French and Alge
rian officials say the Sahara war
is no longer an issue between
them. Knowledgeable Algerians
say the government is consider
ing buying French arms to be
come less dependent on the
Soviets.
Obstacle
Algerian officials made it
clear that the only real obstacle

to good U.S. relations with
Algeria is U.S. support of
Morocco against Polisario — a
piece of excess baggage the
French have thrown overboard.
U.S. officials obviously treat the
Sahara war as a sideshow, even
though it has conditioned a
whole range of North African
problems, starting with the
Algerian-Moroccan relations.
A high-ranking Frenchman
heavily involved in Maghreb af
fairs gave a detailed analysis of
why neither Morocco, which
controls the strongpoints in the
western Sahara, nor the tiny
Polisario, probably the world's
best desert warfare force, can
win.
Then, he said, "But of course,
Morocco will lose because there
must be a loser." As if to justify
France's revised bet on who is
the Maghreb's winning horse, he
recalled that Charles de Gaulle
once said that Algeria's revolu
tion is behind it and Morocco's
revolution is still to come.
