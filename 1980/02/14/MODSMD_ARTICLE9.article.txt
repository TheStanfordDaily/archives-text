WASHINGTON — State
Department budget officer
Bruce German, reflecting
the frustrations and pressures of
more than three months of con
finement as a hostage in Tehran,
has pleaded for U.S. govern
ment action, saying he fears that
he and his fellow hostages may
be considered "expendable."
"Our future is \ery uncertain,
and 1 am not overdramatizing
when I say our very li\es hang in
the balance." German. 43. from

Kensington, Md. said in a letter
received Tuesday by The
Washington Post.
"Needless to say, we have he
come lather bitter, disillusioned
and frustrated, because we that
we arc \ ietims of poor judgment
and lack of foresight." he added.
His letter, dated Feb. 7, indi
cated that the hostages remain
cut off from news. At one point,
German noted that "the shah is
still in the U.S." and described
the deposed monarch's alleged
presence in this country as
"something which totally defies

logic."
Former Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi, left the United
States forthePanamanian Island
of Contadora Dec. 15 — nearly
two months before German
wrote his letter. A State De
partment official Tuesday de
scribed as "criminal" the failure
of the Iranian militants to in
form their American captives
that the deposed shah is no
longer in the United States.
German's printed, two-page
letter to The Post was among
136 letters from the hostages

that were brought hack to the
United States by American In
dian activist John Thomas.
Thomas, who arrived in New
York Monday, recently started
an informal "hostage mail ex
change service" for the captives
and their families.
German's wife and the State
Department official said that
they had no reason to doubt the
authenticity of the letter re
ceived by The Post. Marge
German said she had been told
by her husband in another letter
that he "was writing to The
Post.
In the letter to The Post,
German made a number of
political points, expressed sym
pathy tor the Iranian militants'
views and skepticism about U.S.
government decisions on Iran.
In this respect, his comments re
sembled those of several other
hostages in letters and broadcast
statements.
The State Department official
said the political views expres
sed by German indicated that he
apparently had been influenced
by his captors. The official
added that it is unclear whether
German wrote the letter under
explicit direction or whether he
now accepts some of the milit
ants' views.
