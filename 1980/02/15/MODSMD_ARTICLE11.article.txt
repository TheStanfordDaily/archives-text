MOGADISHU, Somalia â€” Unable to
pacify the Ogaden region. Ethiopia has
launched a campaign to depopulate the
war-ravaged wasteland, driving out the
ethnic Somalis and replacing them with
Ethiopians, according to refugees and dip
lomatic sources here.
For six months the Ethiopians, backed b\
Cubans and East Germans, ha\e been
poisoning and bombing waterholes.
machine-gunning herds of cattle and straf
ing villages, the sources said. At least twice,
they said, napalm has been used in air at
tacks on civilian villages.
The new tactics have reportedly resulted
in thousands of casualties and helped swell
Somalia's refugee population beyond a mill
ion. But they do not appear to have
weakened Somalia's resolve to reunite all
ethnic Somalis under one flag. The Ogaden.
an Ethiopian province, was once part of
Somalia and is inhabited mostly by Somalis.
"The Russians and Cubans are the ones
who chased us out of our motherland," said
a recently arrived refugee, Dol Aynashe.
"Without them, the Ethiopians are nothing.
One day we will return to the Ogaden.
In July 19/7. Somalia launched a major
attack across the Ethiopian border and into
the Ogaden in support of guerrillas from the
Western Somali Liberation Front who had

been fighting in the region since 1962.
Soviet abandonment
The Somalis quickly drove 700 miles
through the Ogaden. They seemed,assured
of \ictory until the Soviet Union abandoned
the Somali government and poured SI bill
ion in weapons into Marxist Ethiopia.
About 1000 Soviets and 1 7.000 Cubans are
still in Ethiopia.
Since the Somali regulars pulled out of
the Ogaden in May 197 X, leaving the guer
rillas to continue the war. about 60,000
people have been killed there, including
25.000 civilians and 6000 Cubans, accord
ing to Arab diplomats here. But the guerril
las have regained control of the countryside,
and the Ethiopians and Cubans are re
stricted mostly to the towns and main roads,
intelligence sources said.
"The enemy can capture any of our base
camps if they are prepared to pay a high
enough cost," said Mohammed Mussa. a
member of the liberation front's central
committee. "But they can't hold them. Fi
nally, in the end, they are always forced to
withdraw.
'Minor losses'
"Our fighters are everywhere. We know
the land better. The people are our people.
Our losses are minor compared to the
enemy's. Militarily, the Ogaden is a stand
off now. It's a war of attrition."

The liberation front, whose forces
number about 20,000, lights mostly with
captured weapons, including some old
British Enfield rifles. It receives no overt
support from any nation except Somalia, but
is believed to have received some back-door
assistance from Egypt, Saudi Arabia and
Iraq.
Western military sources in Mogadishu
said that Cuban and East German pilots in
Ethiopia fly many of the missions and also
man some of the T-54 and T-55 tanks.
Ethiopia is equipped with American F-5
fighters as well as Soviet MIG fighters. Its
militia and regular forces, numbering
200,000 men, make up the largest fighting
force in Black Africa.
Ethnic recruitment
In the last six months, neutral Arab
sources said, Ethiopia has been recruiting
ethnic Somalis in Kenya and Ethiopia and
has formed them into what is known as the
Somali Salvation Front.
The front is dedicated to the overthrow of
Somali President Siad Barre, 60, an
Ogaden-born former policeman who came
to power 1 I years ago in a nearly bloodless
coup.
Ethiopia's attempt to depopulate the
Ogaden of ethnic Somalis is evidently de
signed to deny the liberation front the popu
lar support it now has.
