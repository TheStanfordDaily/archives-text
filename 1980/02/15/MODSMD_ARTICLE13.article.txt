# Administration manages diplomatic efforts
## Carter speech signals hope in Iran 
### Don Oberdorfer The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — In the
most sensitive moment of the
three-month hostage crisis bet
ween the United States and
Iran, President Jimmy Carter
raised the hopes of the nation
Wednesday night about "posi
tive signs" for a negotiated re
solution.
Rumors and reports filled the
capital with intense speculation
in the hours before his televised
news conference, but the presi
dent made no announcement of
a deal and gave no report on
negotiations in progress. He also
was careful to close no doors to
the Iranian-American settle
ment arrangements that seem to
be shaping up.

Despite the prudent reticence
of tight-lipped spokesmen and a
tight-lipped president, there was
no doubt that the Iranian posi
tion was undergoing rapid
change and that a U.S. position
designed to meet it is in the pro
cess of evolution.
In the eyes of official-
Washington, Iran's new leader is
moving with unexpected and
almost unbelievable speed to
make his bid to end a hostage
taking that he ne\er liked but.
until now, was powerless to con
trol. One worry here was that
President Aholhassan Bani-
Sadr might he shifting the Ira
nian position too far too fast to
be sustained — and the ad
ministration was therefore
treading with extreme caution to
avoid anv word or deed that
might trip him up at home.
'Multi-faceted'
The international commission
of inquiry that Carter guardedly
endorsed Wednesday night is
clearly one part of multi-faceted
arrangements that are expected
to lead in time to the release of
the 50 Americans.
It has long been expected that
such "a step toward the resolu
tion of this crisis," as Carter cal
led the commission idea, would
play a role in assuaging Iranian
passion and wounded pride
about the role of America in the

regime of the former shah.
More surprising and perhaps
more important, although un
mentioned by Carter, are three
conditions for release of the hos
tages that have been explicitly
directed to the United States by
Bani Sadr in two press inter
views since Monday, and which
are reported to have been also
directed to Washington in pri
vate communications.
Self-criticism
The three conditions are:
"self-criticism" by the United
States regarding its role in Iran
since the recognition of
Iran's right to obtain extradition
of the shah and repatriation ot
his fortune, and a pledge by the
United States that it will never
again interfere in the internal af
fairs of Iran.
Those conditions are by no
means simple for a proud presi
dent of a proud nation that is
certain it has been sinned
against more than it is sinning.
Some news accounts from ab
road have quoted Bani-Sadr as
saying the United States must
"admit guilt," something the
State Department has said the
United States will not do.
But translations of Bani-
Sadr's interview with Le Monde
on Monday and on the French
program "Face the Public"
Wednesday have rendered his

demand as a requirement that
the United States accept "self
criticism."
Words
Such are the gaps that words
can cause, and other words can
bridge.
No longer is the actual extrad
ition of the deposed shah re
quired in exchange for the hos
tages. but now onjy the recogni
tion ot Iran's right to extradite
him. Bani-Sadr made it explicit
again Wednesday that the body
of the shah is not linked to the
bodies of the hostages.
No longer are the militant
students in control of the future
in the occupied embasy. Bani-
Sadr has stated clearly that the
Revolutionary Council, with the
approval of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, is to make the deci
sions and captors are to obey
him.
End indignity
All this rather suddenly pre
sented the Carter administration
with the best chance in more
than 100 days to extract the cap
tive Americans from the oc
cupied embassy and to end the
indignity and seeming impo
tence their captivity has
brought. The three-month thril
ler, one of the most gripping
melodramas ever played out on
the international stage, is not yc*t
at its climax.

directed to the United States by
Bani Sadr in two press inter
views since Monday, and which
are reported to have been also
directed to Washington in pri
vate communications.
Self-criticism
The three conditions are:
"self-criticism" by the United
States regarding its role in Iran
since the recognition of
Iran's right to obtain extradition
of the shah and repatriation ot
his fortune, and a pledge by the
United States that it will never
again interfere in the internal af
fairs of Iran.
Those conditions are by no
means simple for a proud presi
dent of a proud nation that is
certain it has been sinned
against more than it is sinning.
Some news accounts from ab
road have quoted Bani-Sadr as
saying the United States must
"admit guilt," something the
State Department has said the
United States will not do.
But translations of Bani-
Sadr's interview with Le Monde
on Monday and on the French
program "Face the Public"
Wednesday have rendered his

demand as a requirement that
the United States accept "self
criticism."
Words
Such are the gaps that words
can cause, and other words can
bridge.
No longer is the actual extrad
ition of the deposed shah re
quired in exchange for the hos
tages. but now onjy the recogni
tion ot Iran's right to extradite
him. Bani-Sadr made it explicit
again Wednesday that the body
of the shah is not linked to the
bodies of the hostages.
No longer are the militant
students in control of the future
in the occupied embasy. Bani-
Sadr has stated clearly that the
Revolutionary Council, with the
approval of Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini, is to make the deci
sions and captors are to obey
him.
End indignity
All this rather suddenly pre
sented the Carter administration
with the best chance in more
than 100 days to extract the cap
tive Americans from the oc
cupied embassy and to end the
indignity and seeming impo
tence their captivity has
brought. The three-month thril
ler, one of the most gripping
melodramas ever played out on
the international stage, is not yc*t
at its climax.
WASHINGTON — In the
most sensitive moment of the
three-month hostage crisis bet
ween the United States and
Iran, President Jimmy Carter
raised the hopes of the nation
Wednesday night about "posi
tive signs" for a negotiated re
solution.
Rumors and reports filled the
capital with intense speculation
in the hours before his televised
news conference, but the presi
dent made no announcement of
a deal and gave no report on
negotiations in progress. He also
was careful to close no doors to
the Iranian-American settle
ment arrangements that seem to
be shaping up.

Despite the prudent reticence
of tight-lipped spokesmen and a
tight-lipped president, there was
no doubt that the Iranian posi
tion was undergoing rapid
change and that a U.S. position
designed to meet it is in the pro
cess of evolution.
In the eyes of official-
Washington, Iran's new leader is
moving with unexpected and
almost unbelievable speed to
make his bid to end a hostage
taking that he ne\er liked but.
until now, was powerless to con
trol. One worry here was that
President Aholhassan Bani-
Sadr might he shifting the Ira
nian position too far too fast to
be sustained — and the ad
ministration was therefore
treading with extreme caution to
avoid anv word or deed that
might trip him up at home.
'Multi-faceted'
The international commission
of inquiry that Carter guardedly
endorsed Wednesday night is
clearly one part of multi-faceted
arrangements that are expected
to lead in time to the release of
the 50 Americans.
It has long been expected that
such "a step toward the resolu
tion of this crisis," as Carter cal
led the commission idea, would
play a role in assuaging Iranian
passion and wounded pride
about the role of America in the

regime of the former shah.
More surprising and perhaps
more important, although un
mentioned by Carter, are three
conditions for release of the hos
tages that have been explicitly
directed to the United States by
Bani Sadr in two press inter
views since Monday, and which
are reported to have been also
directed to Washington in pri
vate communications.
