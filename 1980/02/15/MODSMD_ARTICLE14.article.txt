He told reporters that Presi
dent Anwar Sadat last month
authorized establishment of
training camps in Egypt as part
of a series of measures to
counter the Soviet intervention.
He did not specify the number
of camps, their location or the
size of the rebel force in Egypt.
"Egypt is training some ol

them (rebels) to some extent,"
Ali said at a question-and
answer session at the Cairo
Foreign Press Association.
Thousands of Egyptian volun
teers, responding to calls from
Moslem religious leaders, have
signed petitions expressing wil
lingness to fight in Afghanistan
alongside Moslem rebels, Ali
said. But he added that he did
not know of plans to send them
there.
Turning to Egypt's own de
fense, the defense minister said
Egypt needs America's most
sophisticated warplane, the

F-1 5, to defend itself against po
tential threats posed by Soviet
armed regimes in the area.
Referring specifically to
South Yemen, Ethiopia and
Libya, all of which are being
armed by the Soviet Union, he
said: "It is not reasonable to
face all this armament with
non-sophisticated weapons."
A Pentagon delegation
headed hy Assistant Secretary
of Defense David McGiffert is
due here Feb. 20, and Ali said
he would pursue the request
then.
