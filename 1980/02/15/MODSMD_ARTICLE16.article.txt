"Just takin' care of business. . . ."
My regular readers will be interested to know
that a work order will soon be issued to repair the
potholes on Arboretum Road, as mentioned here
last week. Operations Manager Bruce Wiggins
tells me that there are 70 potholes to be filled
between Quarry Road and Galvez Street.
Wiggins also said that a check of the road,
prompted by a question to Bug Me, revealed 1500
feet of poor shoulder, which is on a priority list for
general plant improvements.
Dear Bug Me -
How do they estimate the number of football
fans at a Stanford football game before the game is
over? Do they count stubs?
-Curious
Goodness no, the system used is much more
complicated than that. As Associate Athletic Di
rector Gary Cavalli explains:
"There are three of us that kind of get together
and judge how full the stadium is."
Actually, it's a bit more than that. Cavalli and
two other Athletic Department Staff members do
estimate the attendance at each game, but they
have help.
They know how many tickets have been presold
for each game, including student and season tic
kets. This alone is just *a start, said Cavalli, be
cause as many as 10,000 tickets are sold on the
day of the game. The "guesstimaters" scan the
stadium section by section and count the empty

scats. Ilien, knowing the capacity of cach section,
tlicy can calculate the number of fans present.
Naturally, with this system, "it's impossible to
be right on the money," Cavalli said. But when
comparing their numbers with records ot ticket
sales later in each week, the Athletic Department
staff has been within 5000 almost every time. The
closest they have ever been was within 1000, and
the worst was about 8000 off, according to
Cavalli.
If Cavalli ever is having real trouble estimating
attendance, he has one other source: Don
Liebendorfer, Stanford's original (and the coun
try's Jirst) sports information director. Lieben
dorfer first took that position in 1924, so he's seen
a lot of games.
By the way, if you're wondering why attendance
is always announced as a precise number, it's "for
kicks, basically," Cavalli said. The "guesstimat
ers" used to round off their numbers, but mem
bers of the press covering the game gave them a
bad time about it. So now the estimates are made
to sound more exact.
Interested in cows or bulls or Rabbitts (and I
don't mean the little furry ones that eat carrots)?
Well, tune in next week, same time, same column,
for these and other fascinating letters. Until then,
have a long weekend. If you think of anything you
want to say to me, drop by the Daily, Storke
Publications Building, Stanford, CA 94305. If I'm
not in, carve your question on the wall or write it
down and drop it in my mailbox.
