# Protect oil fields, ambassador says
## 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
In response to the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan, the re
newed U.S. effort to construct it
Middle Hast (iefense system
should he seen as "a tremend
ous diplomatic endeavor," said
former ambassador Nicholas
Thatcher.
Thatcher, U.S. Ambassador
to Saudi Arabia from 1970 to
1M73, spoke Tuesday evening to
a group of 15 at the last in a
series of Middle East talks,
sponsored by Toyon Hall. Avig
dor Haselkorn. formerly a
post-doctoral fellow with the
Arms Control Program, also
spoke on Soviet strategies in the
Middle East.
Building a defense system is
"going to be extremely expen
sive, involving building up
strategic bases and helping sev
eral countries economically,"
Thatcher said. "We have to do it
because there is nothing militar
ily between Afghanistan and
those indispensable oilfields,"
the defense of which is "vital to
the survival of the industrialized
world."
Furthermore, he said, "there
has to be a counterforce in that
warm-water area to oppose the
Soviets," a role formerly taken
by the shah of Iran most re
cently, and the British Empire in
earlier vears.

Thatcher said it would be im
possible to ensure the ability to
defeat the Russians in that area;
rather, the intention is "to sub
stantially raise their level of
risk" by creating a cooperative
defense effort involving the na
tions in the region, as well as the
other industrialized nations of
Western Europe and Japan.
Pray for ayatollah
In Iran, combative ethnic
minorities constitute the most
dangerous threat to unity, and
provide a temptation for Soviet
efforts to inject leftist influence,
he said. "Ironically, the best we
can do is to pray for the ayatol
lah simply because he appears to
be the only central governing
element in the country who has
the political strength to keep
Iran from disintegrating."
In Pakistan, however, the Un
ited States has already em
barked on a massive assistance
program, despite the threat of
sectional separatism, said
Thatcher. "There our political
skills will b taxed in trying not
to incure India's distrust, which
could undermine the whole de
fense effort."
Finally, Thatcher predicted
that the resounding condemna
tion of the recent Soviet
takeover will result in a return
to detente, which had been "ex
traordinarily profitable" for the
Soviets.

"The principle hazard is that
this will undermine our deter
mination to go ahead with a dif
ficult, expensive effort to
strengthen our defenses," thus
continuing America's strategic
weak ness in the area, he con
cluded.
Ciuard periphery
In the following lecture,
Haselkorn said, "The Soviets
have been engaged in a massive
effort to build a collective sec
urity system to guard its
periphe/y.
By achieving treaties with
nearby countries, "the Soviets
have laid down an infrastructure
which is based on three subsys
tems," said Haselkorn.
These treaties contain clauses
which allow Soviet bases and
legitimize intervention to keep
members inside the security sys
tem. he said.
Subsystems linked
By building their internal
capabilities and by cultivating a
plethora of bilateral treaties,
"the Soviet Union has strategi
cally linked the subsystems to
gether and the countries within
them, so they can support each
other as a pro-Soviet coalition,"
he said.

The Russians would not risk a
nuclear war by attempting to
sieze the Persian Gulf, he said,
because "the Soviet Union is the
most strategic country in the
world and it will not go to war
for economic reasons."
However, the increased
Soviet effort to incorporate
parts of Africa, "may indicate a
shift to an aggressive stance, due
to American failures to signal
readiness to resist Soviet moves
there," said Haselkorn.
Therefore, the United States
should "shore up its defense
capabilities in the area in con
junction with signaling a desire
to mutually reduce capabilities,"
he said. "By reassuring the
Soviets that there are no Ameri
can designs in those areas, we
may limit their urge to secure
their borders."
One step in that direction
would be for America to prop
ose a conventional arms limita
tion treaty, said Haselkorn. Al
though Thatcher pointed to
traditional Soviet resistance to
on-site inspection, without
which such a treaty would be
"meaningless," Haselkorn said
America would benefit from
such a proposal.

In response to the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan, the re
newed U.S. effort to construct it
Middle Hast (iefense system
should he seen as "a tremend
ous diplomatic endeavor," said
former ambassador Nicholas
Thatcher.
Thatcher, U.S. Ambassador
to Saudi Arabia from 1970 to
1M73, spoke Tuesday evening to
a group of 15 at the last in a
series of Middle East talks,
sponsored by Toyon Hall. Avig
dor Haselkorn. formerly a
post-doctoral fellow with the
Arms Control Program, also
spoke on Soviet strategies in the
Middle East.
Building a defense system is
"going to be extremely expen
sive, involving building up
strategic bases and helping sev
eral countries economically,"
Thatcher said. "We have to do it
because there is nothing militar
ily between Afghanistan and
those indispensable oilfields,"
the defense of which is "vital to
the survival of the industrialized
world."
Furthermore, he said, "there
has to be a counterforce in that
warm-water area to oppose the
Soviets," a role formerly taken
by the shah of Iran most re
cently, and the British Empire in
earlier vears.

Thatcher said it would be im
possible to ensure the ability to
defeat the Russians in that area;
rather, the intention is "to sub
stantially raise their level of
risk" by creating a cooperative
defense effort involving the na
tions in the region, as well as the
other industrialized nations of
Western Europe and Japan.
Pray for ayatollah
In Iran, combative ethnic
minorities constitute the most
dangerous threat to unity, and
provide a temptation for Soviet
efforts to inject leftist influence,
he said. "Ironically, the best we
can do is to pray for the ayatol
lah simply because he appears to
be the only central governing
element in the country who has
the political strength to keep
Iran from disintegrating."
In Pakistan, however, the Un
ited States has already em
barked on a massive assistance
program, despite the threat of
sectional separatism, said
Thatcher. "There our political
skills will b taxed in trying not
to incure India's distrust, which
could undermine the whole de
fense effort."
Finally, Thatcher predicted
that the resounding condemna
tion of the recent Soviet
takeover will result in a return
to detente, which had been "ex
traordinarily profitable" for the
Soviets.

"The principle hazard is that
this will undermine our deter
mination to go ahead with a dif
ficult, expensive effort to
strengthen our defenses," thus
continuing America's strategic
weak ness in the area, he con
cluded.
Ciuard periphery
In the following lecture,
Haselkorn said, "The Soviets
have been engaged in a massive
effort to build a collective sec
urity system to guard its
periphe/y.
By achieving treaties with
nearby countries, "the Soviets
have laid down an infrastructure
which is based on three subsys
tems," said Haselkorn.
These treaties contain clauses
which allow Soviet bases and
legitimize intervention to keep
members inside the security sys
tem. he said.
Subsystems linked
By building their internal
capabilities and by cultivating a
plethora of bilateral treaties,
"the Soviet Union has strategi
cally linked the subsystems to
gether and the countries within
them, so they can support each
other as a pro-Soviet coalition,"
he said.

The Russians would not risk a
nuclear war by attempting to
sieze the Persian Gulf, he said,
because "the Soviet Union is the
most strategic country in the
world and it will not go to war
for economic reasons."
However, the increased
Soviet effort to incorporate
parts of Africa, "may indicate a
shift to an aggressive stance, due
to American failures to signal
readiness to resist Soviet moves
there," said Haselkorn.
Therefore, the United States
should "shore up its defense
capabilities in the area in con
junction with signaling a desire
to mutually reduce capabilities,"
he said. "By reassuring the
Soviets that there are no Ameri
can designs in those areas, we
may limit their urge to secure
their borders."
One step in that direction
would be for America to prop
ose a conventional arms limita
tion treaty, said Haselkorn. Al
though Thatcher pointed to
traditional Soviet resistance to
on-site inspection, without
which such a treaty would be
"meaningless," Haselkorn said
America would benefit from
such a proposal.
