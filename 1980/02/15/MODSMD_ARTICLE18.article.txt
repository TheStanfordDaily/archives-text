# UC med school minority enrollment up

SACRAMENTO, Calif. —
Last year, 1 2 months after Allan
Bakke made his historic entr
ance to medical school at UC-
Davis, the first-year class of 100
included exactly one black.
That lonely statistic would
seem to bear out predictions by
university officials that minority
enrollment would plummet if
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled
against racial quotas at profes
sional schools.
But other statistics tell a diffe
rent story — that applications
from blacks to the Davis school
surged in 1979, and that overall
minority enrollment actually in
creased at Davis and at UC
medical schools as a whole.
"Last year (1978) we really
felt the Bakke decision in ad
missions," said Vicki Saito. in
formation officer for the Davis
medical school. "This year, we
felt it less."
■ "I talk to students all the
time," said Gary Perkins, head
of the information office at the
largely minority Extended Op
portunity Program on the Davis
campus, "and it's (the Bakke
decision) meant some real

hesitancies .... It's created
much more of a pessimistic at
titude.
"On the other hand, it's prob
ably created other things more
positive. Students realize they're
going to have to be 200 percent
better now because of the added
barriers."
Bakke, a white engineer, en
tered the medical school 15
miles east of Sacramento in Sep
tember 1978, under a Supreme
Court ruling outlawing a Davis
program that reserved 16 of the
100 places in each class for low
income minorities.
Non-quota preference
The court also ruled, how
ever, that a school could use an
admissions program that gave
preference to race as one of sev
eral factors to promote diversity
among students.
Such a program has since
been adopted by Davis, and was
already in effect in varying de
grees at the other four UC med
ical schools: UCLA. Irvine, San
Diego and San Francisco.
In fact, according to John
Steward, dean of student affairs
at the University Medical
School here, a nationwide study
last summer of the 120 medical

schools with white majorities
showed that UC-lrvine had the
highest proportion of black,
Hispanic and native American
minorities, 22.5 percent.
UC-San Francisco was also
among the top 10 with 16.5 per
cent.
Separate committee
Stanford, which at the time
ranked fourth with 19.5 percent.

ut Davis included four blacks,
two Mexican-Americans, no
American Indians and 14
Asians. The year before had in
cluded four blacks, eight
Mexican-Americans and 15
Asians.
Dropped
At all five UC medical
schools, first-year minority en
rollment in 1977 and 1978

The Bakke decision * meant some real
hesitancies . . . Ifs created much more of a
pessimistic attitude'

dropped its separate admissions
committee for minorities after
the Bakke decision.
Instead, it adopted a program
in which minorities get no ex
press preference but the admis
sions committee includes mem
bers of minorities who are sensi
tive to differences in students'
backgrounds, Steward said.
The first class to be admitted
under the University's new sys
tem, last fall, had 22 percent
blacks, Hispanics and
Mexican-Americans.
Bakke's first-year class of 100

dropped from 28 percent to 27
percent of the total. Discounting
Asians, minority enrollment
dipped from 16 to 14.5 percent.
But last fall, system-wide
minority enrollment in the
first-year class was 29 percent of
the total. Not counting Asians it
was 16 percent.
At Davis, while only one
black enrolled out of six who
were accepted, nine of 16
Mexican-Americans entered,
compared to two of IS the year
before. There were also one
native American student and 14

Asians, for a total of 25 minority
students, compared to 20 in
1978.
Applications
Another sign that the impact
of the Bakke case may be eas
ing, Saito said, is the number of
applications for admission at
Davis.
Applications from blacks,
which fell from 163 in 1977 to
131 in 1978, numbered 174 last
year, she said. Applications
from Mexican-Americans fell
from 147 to 135, but she said
that was offset by some energe
tic recruiting by Mexican-
American students, who per
suaded many of those who were
accepted to enroll.
Saito said other reasons for
changing enrollment patterns at
Davis were the medical school's
decision to drop its pass-fail
grading system, to give letter
grades and to replace its unusual
schedule of only four hours of
required classes a day with a
more conventional schedule of
longer hours.
She said those changes, ap
proved by the faculty to
strengthen the academic prog
ram, may have discouraged
some prospective students.
