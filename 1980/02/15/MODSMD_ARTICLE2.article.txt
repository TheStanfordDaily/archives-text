# Kennedy addresses draft, housing on KZSU
## Provost noncommittal on presidency 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
University Provost Donald Ken
nedy, who is considered the most
likely candidate to succeed Richard
Lyman as University president, said
that he has "no idea" whether or not
he would accept the position it it were
offered to him.
Kennedy made his remarks on the
KZSU radio program Campus Con
ference taped yesterday morning.
When asked if he was being consi
dered for the University presidency,
Kennedy replied, "That's really up to
them (the presidential search commit
tee) to decide."
Kennedy further denied speculation
that he left his post as commissioner of
the Food and Drug Administration six
months ago with the understanding
that he would become president here
after Lyman's resignation.
Variety
The current provost answered a
wide variety of questions ranging from
the current housing shortage to ad
ministration policy regarding registra
tion for the draft during the half-hour

interview with reporters from K/SU
and the Daily.
When asked about administration
policy on registration for the, draft,
Kennedy replied that no administra
tion policy has been declared. He also
said that he did not consider it neces
sary for the administration to formu
late such a policy at the present time.
Declaring an administration policy
on registration, he said, "asks us to
cross a bridge that not only have we
not come to vet, but it isn't even visi
ble."
As lor Kennedy's personal opinion
on the subject, he said that he has "not
yet seen anything in President
(Jimmy) Carter's proposal with which
I profoundly disagree."
Hiring
With regard to last month's federal
report citing Stanford for deficiencies
in its hiring and retention of women
and minority faculty members, Ken
nedy stated that "some departments
simply have not put it high enough on
their list of goals."
He said that his office is trying to
give the University departments incen

tives to encourage them to employ
more minority faculty members and
give that issue a higher priority.
Financial concerns weighed heavily
in the discussion.
Drain
Kennedy said that he was "frankly
quite worried" about possible federal
cut-backs in graduate, fellowship and
traineeship support, particularly in the
sciences. Such budget cuts might put a
significant drain on all University
funding, according to Kennedy.
Also of financial concern is Proposi
tion 9. the so-called Jarvis II tax
cutting initiative under consideration
in California. Although it would cost
the University directly the relatively
small sum of $750.000 in scholarship
funds, according to Kennedy, the fact
that it could severely cripple UC-
Berkeley may have far more serious
consequences for Stanford.
"Stanford really needs the Univer
sity of California to be strong and
vice-versa," he said. ". . . it will be a
very sad day for Stanford if Berkeley
stops being (the fine school it is)."
Kennedy also discussed the present

regional housing shortage.
The lack of housing for new faculty,
Kennedy said, is the most discouraging
factor in trying to attract new faculty
to Stanford. Though the University
has planned to build 1 40 units of hous
ing for faculty on Peter Coutts Hill,
this would only be a "30 percent solu
tion" to the problem, according to
Kennedy.
He also supported a decision by
Stanford to continue planning a 1600
unit housing facility on Willow Rd. de
