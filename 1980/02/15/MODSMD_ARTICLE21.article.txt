## 'Hope found outside Canada too 
### 
It began as a simple discussion
among close friends trying to fi
gure out where we would go and
what we would do it by draft,
war. or other calamity we were
forced to flee the country. But it
became far more than that.
We were sorting through dif
ferent countries, assessing which
ones were likely to allow us en
trance. remain neutral and give
us at least some semblance ot
civil liberties when one of lis had
an idea:
"There's a place in Canada,
about halfway between Van
couver and Bantl National Park,
which puts it about 50 miles
from nowhere. It's called Hope.
J "The town is very small, not
more than a few thousand
people. It was founded, or taken
over, by Vietnam draft evaders
who stayed there after amnesty.
"It's not exactly a commune,
but it isn't Palo Alto either. It's
more ol a cooperative place, a
lot ol small homes and small
shops on small streets. But it's
different from here. It's not has
sled or competitive. The town is
just a group ol people, trying to
be self-sufficient and live their
lives."
We all listened open-mouthed

to this description ot a de
monetari/ed El Dorado, and we
drank some more wine, so that
in a few minutes we were in a
mood to make long-range plans.
And they were great plans.
We would dri\e north with what
few important possessions we
had and would sell our car just
outside Hope to raise money.
We would rent a small apart
ment. nothing fancy, and would
all live together in the same
place to save money. We would
work at quiet jobs, peaceful
jobs, and in our off-hours we'd
paint and write and engage in
practically every other noble
pursuit you can imagine. When
necessary, we'd live by our wits,
and we all agreed that such a life
would not be easy, but without
question it would be sweet.
But the goal wasn't to be suc
cessful. or move up in the world:
it was quite the opposite. We
could be successful in Palo Alto
or Los Angeles or Greenwich.
We simply wanted to live our
lives properly in Hope, and not
harm anyone else, and it there
was a great deal ot spare time
we could walk off into the
woods together and look for

God.
They were great plans, but the
evening grew long. Everyone
dispersed.
As I lav in bed that evening
the effects of the alcohol began
to wear off. and Hope. Canada
became ;i place more and more
distant. I drifted off to sleep.
The next several days were hec
tic and I had no thought of going
any where except to classes.
Before long, however, I was
reminded of Hope. I remem
bered most of what I had said
that evening, and I tried to fi
gure out how much of it I had
meant. But the whole problem is
dismissed: we'll probably never
have to flee the country, any
way.
That dismissal, however, is a
little too easy. Looking at the
lite I've had, my clothes, my
possessions, the school I attend,
the long-range plans I've made,
it becomes pretty clear why the
dream of going to I lope is prob
ably just a dream.
bach day the fantasy ot Hope
seems all the more unreal and
the suburban life of Palo Alto,
however unreal, is the only life I
confront. And the prospect of

finding God here — well, that
seems an impossibility.
The truth of it is, of course,
that I can have everything I
planned lor in Hope without
fleeing the country: I can have
those plans here or in Canada or
in Antarctica with equal ease —
and with equal difficulty.

among close friends trying to fi
gure out where we would go and
what we would do it by draft,
war. or other calamity we were
forced to flee the country. But it
became far more than that.
We were sorting through dif
ferent countries, assessing which
ones were likely to allow us en
trance. remain neutral and give
us at least some semblance ot
civil liberties when one of lis had
an idea:
"There's a place in Canada,
about halfway between Van
couver and Bantl National Park,
which puts it about 50 miles
from nowhere. It's called Hope.
J "The town is very small, not
more than a few thousand
people. It was founded, or taken
over, by Vietnam draft evaders
who stayed there after amnesty.
"It's not exactly a commune,
but it isn't Palo Alto either. It's
more ol a cooperative place, a
lot ol small homes and small
shops on small streets. But it's
different from here. It's not has
sled or competitive. The town is
just a group ol people, trying to
be self-sufficient and live their
lives."
We all listened open-mouthed

to this description ot a de
monetari/ed El Dorado, and we
drank some more wine, so that
in a few minutes we were in a
mood to make long-range plans.
And they were great plans.
We would dri\e north with what
few important possessions we
had and would sell our car just
outside Hope to raise money.
We would rent a small apart
ment. nothing fancy, and would
all live together in the same
place to save money. We would
work at quiet jobs, peaceful
jobs, and in our off-hours we'd
paint and write and engage in
practically every other noble
pursuit you can imagine. When
necessary, we'd live by our wits,
and we all agreed that such a life
would not be easy, but without
question it would be sweet.
But the goal wasn't to be suc
cessful. or move up in the world:
it was quite the opposite. We
could be successful in Palo Alto
or Los Angeles or Greenwich.
We simply wanted to live our
lives properly in Hope, and not
harm anyone else, and it there
was a great deal ot spare time
we could walk off into the
woods together and look for

God.
They were great plans, but the
evening grew long. Everyone
dispersed.
As I lav in bed that evening
the effects of the alcohol began
to wear off. and Hope. Canada
became ;i place more and more
distant. I drifted off to sleep.
The next several days were hec
tic and I had no thought of going
any where except to classes.
Before long, however, I was
reminded of Hope. I remem
bered most of what I had said
that evening, and I tried to fi
gure out how much of it I had
meant. But the whole problem is
dismissed: we'll probably never
have to flee the country, any
way.
That dismissal, however, is a
little too easy. Looking at the
lite I've had, my clothes, my
possessions, the school I attend,
the long-range plans I've made,
it becomes pretty clear why the
dream of going to I lope is prob
ably just a dream.
bach day the fantasy ot Hope
seems all the more unreal and
the suburban life of Palo Alto,
however unreal, is the only life I
confront. And the prospect of

finding God here — well, that
seems an impossibility.
The truth of it is, of course,
that I can have everything I
planned lor in Hope without
fleeing the country: I can have
those plans here or in Canada or
in Antarctica with equal ease —
and with equal difficulty.
