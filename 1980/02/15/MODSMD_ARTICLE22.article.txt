## McCloskey plan draft in disguise 
### 
Our local congressman, Pete
McCloskey, has claimed that the
all volunteer Army is not work
ing. He also claims to be op
posed to a draft because it
would require some people to
serve and not others. To remedy
this situation, McCloskey has
proposed universal national ser
vice. But McCloskey can't have
it both ways. He must either
lavor a volunteer Army or a
draft. In fact, he favors a draft.
McCloskey does not favor a
volunteer Army because lie
thinks it can't work; raising pay
levels will not attract enough
reasonable people into the
Army. He bases this assertion
on "polls" he has taken at local
high schools. He has asked high
school students if they would
join the Army if pay levels were
doubled. Since no one raised a
hand, McCloskey concludes that
no one would join.
I he quality of this survey is
too deficient to even warrant
discussion, but it leads to
another question. What if one
were to cut the pay in the
Army? If, as McCloskey be
lieves, people do not compare

Army service with alternative
careers when Army pay is in
creased, then they would not
compare the Army with their al
ternatives when pay is reduced.
11l us one should expect no re
duction in the number of people
who enlist in the Army even if
pay is reduced.
But this means that the Army
is grossly overpaid! The current
military budget calls for about
$60 billion for payroll, all of it
presumably unnecessary. After
all, there are better ways to
spend $60 billion than to pay
people who will work for free.
The alternative to a volunteer
Army is a draft. McCloskey's
proposal is to take all the IN
ycar-olds in the country and
offer them a choice of raking
leaves on federal highways or
serving in the Army. Ilic choice
would be left to the individual.
To attract people into the
Army, McCloskey offers a free
college education. Perhaps I am
dense but I don't sec the differ
ence between a free college
education for military service
and just offering increased pay.
Now what if not enough

people opt for Army service?
McCloskey simply hopes this
won't happen. But he has two
choices if the problem should
arise. One is to increase the be
nefit package for those serving
in the Army, but he already as
sumes this won't work. That
leaves a draft. If not enough
people choose the military op
tion, some of the people who
choose to rake leaves will be

drafted.
This raises all the problems
that McCloskey claimed to dis
like about a draft in the first
place. The problem with his
proposal is that it is a draft in
disguise and therefore inhe
rently unfair. And no amount of
manipulation and rhetoric is
going to make it fair.
