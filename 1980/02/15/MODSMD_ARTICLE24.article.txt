## Baker shows experience 
### 
The Republicans want the White House in
1980, and Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee can
guarantee it.
Hie current administration has demonstrated
how critically important it is for the chief execu
tive to be experienced and trained in national and
foreign affairs prior to taking over as head of
state.
Baker is experienced and trained. He has spent
over 12 years in the Senate. He is a member of
both the Foreign Relations and Environment and
Public Works Committees. In this capacity. Baker
has had to make tough decisions, not just cam
paign rhetoric.
Baker does more than claim that inflation is
bad, that the current double digit rate is unaccept
able. He has sponsored a constitutional amend
ment that would require a balanced budget with
provision for congressional override. He has op
posed wage and price controls because they have
failed in the past and show no promise of succeed
ing in the future.
Ilie senator has recognized the need for an
aggressive and imaginative energy policy. In order
to encourage further conservation, spur further
development of resources and make alternative
forms of energy more attractive, he has called for
deregulation of oil and gas prices. At the same
time he only supports a windfall profits tax with a
"plowback" provision, providing incentive to in
crease energy production.
He has demanded the careful and prudent de
velopment of nuclear power. The senator, how
ever. does not want to sacrifice the environment
to our energy demand; he was a major proponent
of the air pollution laws of the early '70s.
It is a pleasure to review the senator's positions
on women's rights: he supports the Equal Rights
Amendment, and he has opposed the proposal to
constitutionally ban abortions.
Of all the Republican candidates. Baker's ex
perience with domestic issues is unparalleled.
Baker has stated that in foreign policy,
"America has lost its margin for error." He has
had no delusions about the Soviet Union. Prior to

the invasion of Afghanistan — before the horse
was out ol the barn — he strongly opposed SALTII.
was against President Jimmy Carter's cuts in the
military budget, and supported the development
of the B-l bomber and the neutron bomb.
In order to prevent forced dependence on nuc
lear weapons he has proposed the development pt
a "first brigade," an elite military force that could
be deployed rapidly if our security or vital in
terests were threatened.
His foreign policy views are mature: although
politically unpopular, he supported the Panama
Canal treaties to reduce tensions in that part Qf
the world. His positions and views have been
based on years of discussion, research and thought
as a member of the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee. The president can no longer afford to
be an amateur in the area of foreign affairs.
Many Americans still remember Baker for his
participation in the Senate Watergate Committee.
Asking "What did the president know and when
did he know it?" the senator impressed many by
his clear and reasonable attitude. Throughout his
career, his integrity has never been questioned.
He is a stable man with a stable family.
IJiere has been a great deal of talk in this cam
paign about "leadership." Several of the candi
dates apparently feel they can just pound their fist
and say such things as, "what this country needs is
leadership." Baker has proven his leadership abil
ity. As Senate Republican leader, Baker has
joined a diverse group into an increasingly power
ful unit. We need not speculate about his leader
ship capabilities — they are well documented by
his performance in the Senate.
Examine all the candidates yourself. You will
find Baker a man of vision tempered by experi
ence. "Our people need a president articulate
enough to chart the future, tough enough to take a
stand, honest enough to be believed, compassion
ate enough to care, young enough to lead, and
experienced enough to get others to follow. I am
ready to be that president." We agree.
