## Reject Penthouse's carwash offer 
### 
Some time ago, we received a
call from John Kinney, presi
dent of the Inter-Fraternity
Council. He was interested in
our response to their planned
"Penthouse Carwash," which
would feature a hand, lots of
prizes given out by the Penth
ouse "Pets," and a street party
with 1 (X) kegs of beer that even
ing, all paid for by Penthouse. In
exchange. Penthouse would gain
promotional publicity, and the
proceeds from the carwash
would benefit charity.

The IPC's desire to raise
funds for worthwhile charities
(in this case the Leukemia
Foundation of the Children's
Hospital at Stanford) and their
goal of "providing social events
for the entire student body," are
commendable. However, we do
not feel that their proposed pro
ject is consistent with these go
als. Women and feminists on
this campus cannot enjoy a so
cial event sponsored by a
magazine that degrades them,
and condones and profits from
their suffering.
The Women's Center more
than merely believes that
magazines like "Penthouse per
petuate a prejudice towards
women." Studies have shown
that the images of women such
as those in Penthouse per
petuate actual violence, rape,
battery and child molestation.
Women Against Violence in
Pornography and the Media
(WAVPM) has documented
many portrayals of violence
against women found in media
ranging from record covers and
Vogue magazine to "soft porn"
like Playboy and Penthouse
down to hardcore pornography.
The WAVPM slideshow "Abu
sive Images of Women in the
Media" has slides of pictorials
from Penthouse. One example is
entitled "Bound for Glory" and
shows carefully made up women
in "sexy" garb of black garters
and stockings, bound, gagged
and thrown in the trunk of a car.
We are asked to view this as
sault and abduction as titillating,
glamorous, fashionable and
above all a "glorious"' experi
ence.
Dr. Diana Russell, a
sociologist at Mills College, has
noted that often rapists refer to
their victims not as "she" but as
"it" — that there is a belief that
the woman is not human — at
least not at the time of the rape.
Some psychoanalysts believe
that media images are contribut
ing to this problem.
WAVPM has another slide
from Penthouse of a cartoon.
The picture shows a woman,
lying in the street with her clo
thing torn off her. A man is run
ning away from her, pulling up
his pants. The cartoon has the
woman saying "Encore . . ." If
this was not in cartoon style and
without the caption, it would be
obvious to all that the situation
pictured isn't humorous. But by
presenting it in a cartoon,
Penthouse trivializes the wo
man's suffering and tries to
make the trauma of rape
"humorous." It also supports
the lie that women enjoy being
raped.
Millions of men read Penth
ouse and there are probably
many police officers, judges and
rapists among them, learning
these lies. These images try hard
to make it seem like this is actu
ally what women want.
Another cartoon from Penth
ouse shows a young girl and an
older man driving off in a gaily
decorated newlywed-style con
vertible. The banner on the back
of the car reads "just molested."
This cartoon celebrates child

molestation and asks that we
laugh at this supposedly happy
couple.
Some people say that the
feminist movement has no sense
of humor, but we simply do not
see anything funny in the brutal
reality of the violence against
women and children which oc
curs every few minutes in our
country and is condoned in car
toons such as these. The images
of constant humiliation, battery
and rape of women in pornog
raphy and in the popular media
numb our collective sensibility.
The great power of these images
is that men viewing them iden
tity with the male actors who
rape, beat and mutilate women.
While our distinctions are not
rigidly defined, we feel it's im
portant to state that we are not
against erotica and don't wish to
see the advent of another Victo
rian age brought on by censor
ship. We want to publicize the
effects of abusive images, to
make those who profit from
them take responsibility for
these effects and to make such
images publicly unacceptable so
that they will be stopped with
out the need of laws.
As long as we allow this imag
ery to flourish in our society, we
will be teaching people that this
is the inevitable male/female
experience. We must say an ab
solute no to images of women
being bound, raped, tortured,
degraded or killed for sexual
stimulation or entertainment.
We understand that the IFC in
no way means to deliberately
promote the abuse of women,
but by accepting Penthouse's

offer that is exactly what they
are doing. We urge the IFC to
accept our offer to see the
Women Against Violence in
Pornography and the Media
slideshow in order to educate
themselves on this issue.
We feel strongly that the IFC
should reject Penthouse's
"generous" offer. As women, we
strongly object to the use of our
university as a publicity symbol
for a magazine like Penthouse.
Surely the IFC can find a better
way to accomplish their goals.
Interested people are invited'
to attend a showing of the
WAVPM slideshow "Abusive
Images of Women in the
Media" on Feb. 22 at 7:30 p.m.
at the Women's Center. Follow
ing the slideshow, a "Take Back
the Night" march at 9:30 is
scheduled to express our rage
about violence against women.

"it" — that there is a belief that
the woman is not human — at
least not at the time of the rape.
Some psychoanalysts believe
that media images are contribut
ing to this problem.
WAVPM has another slide
from Penthouse of a cartoon.
The picture shows a woman,
lying in the street with her clo
thing torn off her. A man is run
ning away from her, pulling up
his pants. The cartoon has the
woman saying "Encore . . ." If
this was not in cartoon style and
without the caption, it would be
obvious to all that the situation
pictured isn't humorous. But by
presenting it in a cartoon,
Penthouse trivializes the wo
man's suffering and tries to
make the trauma of rape
"humorous." It also supports
the lie that women enjoy being
raped.
Millions of men read Penth
ouse and there are probably
many police officers, judges and
rapists among them, learning
these lies. These images try hard
to make it seem like this is actu
ally what women want.
Another cartoon from Penth
ouse shows a young girl and an
older man driving off in a gaily
decorated newlywed-style con
vertible. The banner on the back
of the car reads "just molested."
This cartoon celebrates child

molestation and asks that we
laugh at this supposedly happy
couple.
Some people say that the
feminist movement has no sense
of humor, but we simply do not
see anything funny in the brutal
reality of the violence against
women and children which oc
curs every few minutes in our
country and is condoned in car
toons such as these. The images
of constant humiliation, battery
and rape of women in pornog
raphy and in the popular media
numb our collective sensibility.
The great power of these images
is that men viewing them iden
tity with the male actors who
rape, beat and mutilate women.
While our distinctions are not
rigidly defined, we feel it's im
portant to state that we are not
against erotica and don't wish to
see the advent of another Victo
rian age brought on by censor
ship. We want to publicize the
effects of abusive images, to
make those who profit from
them take responsibility for
these effects and to make such
images publicly unacceptable so
that they will be stopped with
out the need of laws.
As long as we allow this imag
ery to flourish in our society, we
will be teaching people that this
is the inevitable male/female
experience. We must say an ab
solute no to images of women
being bound, raped, tortured,
degraded or killed for sexual
stimulation or entertainment.
We understand that the IFC in
no way means to deliberately
promote the abuse of women,
but by accepting Penthouse's

offer that is exactly what they
are doing. We urge the IFC to
accept our offer to see the
Women Against Violence in
Pornography and the Media
slideshow in order to educate
themselves on this issue.
We feel strongly that the IFC
should reject Penthouse's
"generous" offer. As women, we
strongly object to the use of our
university as a publicity symbol
for a magazine like Penthouse.
Surely the IFC can find a better
way to accomplish their goals.
Interested people are invited'
to attend a showing of the
WAVPM slideshow "Abusive
Images of Women in the
Media" on Feb. 22 at 7:30 p.m.
at the Women's Center. Follow
ing the slideshow, a "Take Back
the Night" march at 9:30 is
scheduled to express our rage
about violence against women.

Some time ago, we received a
call from John Kinney, presi
dent of the Inter-Fraternity
Council. He was interested in
our response to their planned
"Penthouse Carwash," which
would feature a hand, lots of
prizes given out by the Penth
ouse "Pets," and a street party
with 1 (X) kegs of beer that even
ing, all paid for by Penthouse. In
exchange. Penthouse would gain
promotional publicity, and the
proceeds from the carwash
would benefit charity.

The IPC's desire to raise
funds for worthwhile charities
(in this case the Leukemia
Foundation of the Children's
Hospital at Stanford) and their
goal of "providing social events
for the entire student body," are
commendable. However, we do
not feel that their proposed pro
ject is consistent with these go
als. Women and feminists on
this campus cannot enjoy a so
cial event sponsored by a
magazine that degrades them,
and condones and profits from
their suffering.
The Women's Center more
than merely believes that
magazines like "Penthouse per
petuate a prejudice towards
women." Studies have shown
that the images of women such
as those in Penthouse per
petuate actual violence, rape,
battery and child molestation.
Women Against Violence in
Pornography and the Media
(WAVPM) has documented
many portrayals of violence
against women found in media
ranging from record covers and
Vogue magazine to "soft porn"
like Playboy and Penthouse
down to hardcore pornography.
The WAVPM slideshow "Abu
sive Images of Women in the
Media" has slides of pictorials
from Penthouse. One example is
entitled "Bound for Glory" and
shows carefully made up women
in "sexy" garb of black garters
and stockings, bound, gagged
and thrown in the trunk of a car.
We are asked to view this as
sault and abduction as titillating,
glamorous, fashionable and
above all a "glorious"' experi
ence.
Dr. Diana Russell, a
sociologist at Mills College, has
noted that often rapists refer to
their victims not as "she" but as
"it" — that there is a belief that
the woman is not human — at
