## GRADES AND GRADING Gerard Limon A
						of success inconsistently awarded

A. It's nothing more than another let
ter in the alphabet for most people, but
for most students it epitomizes success
and is the reward for many hours of hard
work. But how accurate a measure of
ability and knowledge is an A and does it
have the same value and require the
same amount of ellort from course to
course, from section to section?
A common occurrence in competitive
fields of study is that students often re
sort to striving for the A rather than striv
ing for an understanding of the material.
I his may seem like a fine difference but
it has its repercussions in that the student
may never have a practical understand
ing of the subject and it greatly di
minishes enjoyment of the subject. It
also undermines the purpose of univer
sities; we're supposed to be here to learn,
not to get a 4.0 GPA.
Courses with TA's also pose a prob
lem. I have taken courses where having a
good or bad TA makes the difference in
getting an A or dropping the course. The
problem is that the TA's have almost
complete control of one's grades and
each TA has his own basis for grading.
Although they may try to set a baseline

for grades, it is often not a good index of
an individual's knowledge. They can also
be down-right Svengalis with such abso
lute control — the professors many times
don't have anything to do with the actual
grading.
Another discrepancy arises in courses
with multiple sections. Each professor
decides upon the grade distribution and
it is rare to find two professors who have
the same distribution. In one section a
professor can give 10 percent /l's while
in another section of the same course a
professor gives 25 percent /4's. All one
can do is hope to be lucky enough to be
in the latter section.
Now comes the hardest question of all:
What can be done to improve the grading
system?
First of all, to better ensure that we are
acquiring knowledge of the subject and
not knowledge of how to score above
mean; it would help if the competition
were buffered.
This could possibly be done by design
ing exams so that one has to show a cer
tain mastery level of the subject to get an
A, another level for a Band so on. It

would be analogous to the high school 90
percent and above is an A — and re
member how well we all did in high
school?
Naturally it would be difficult to design
a test like this, but I doubt it would be
impossible and it would definitely be
more objective and fair.
Secondly, there should be more un
iformity in the standards professors and
TA's use for grading. Professors should
set stricter guidelines for TA's when
there is ambiguity, and could discuss
grade distributions so as to eliminate
some of the chance that exists. This
would also better ensure that each stu
dent, regardless of section, is learning
what most professors consider essential.
I am not saying that all courses taught
at Stanford fall into the above categories,
but unfortunately too many of them do.
It's time that the University reflected a
little on the grading system here. After
all it is the grades we receive in these
courses that will play a major role when
we apply to graduate schools.
