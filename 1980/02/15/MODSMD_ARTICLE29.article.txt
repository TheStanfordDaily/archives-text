## What do lick'em stars mean? 
### 
-1 say let's dump grades and
go back to gold stars! Those
little lick 'em stars have ad
vantages.
For example they look
good, even the green ones.
They are not expensive, only
29 cents for a normal dis
tribution box of 100. Perhaps
faculty will find grading more
rewarding; there is some
thing satisfying about affixing
a bright little star to the top
of the page.
Most importantly, the next
time somebody looks at a
Stanford transcript and sees a
stiff page spotted with shiny
gold and silver and metallic
blue stars, he will ask him
self. "What the hell does this
mean?" And that is abso

lutely the right question to
ask — what do those
"grades" mean, what do they
measure?
In the best sense grades
can be a measure of intelli
gence, discipline, persistence,
competency, reasoned judg
ment and adaptability. But
grades can also be a measure
of test taking ability, cunning
manipulation of the system,
memory capacity, narrow in
terest, unquestioning con
formity, intellectual timidity
and the lopsided beneficence
of circumstance.
The problem is clear: each
and every grade contains, in
tentionally or otherwise, a
unique mix and severity of
values. Any thoughtful per

son looking only at a collec
tion of grades on a transcript,
unaware of each unique con
text, would he hard pressed
to claim significant know
ledge about the character
that the transcript pretends
to describe.
Yet employers, graduate
school faculty and parents
still make a big deal about
grades. They shouldn't.
Maybe the glint of a gold star
will wake them up. More im
portantly, maybe the glint
will wake up students, for it is
the students themselves who
are, 1 believe, the biggest
abusers of grades.
Students generally put too
much emphasis on grades.
Grades can be sincerely of

fered guides to academic
merit, but that is all they
should be. Grades are a very,
very poor gauge of self
worth, yet often that is what
they become. In fact it is pos
sible for good grades to re
flect weak qualities. Pursuit
of "the grade" can sidetrack
genuine scholarship. To have
any value at all. grades need
thoughtful interpretation.
When employers or
graduate school faculty ask
themselves, "What do these
grades mean?" they cannot
give a better answer than,
"Not much." But when a
student asks that question of
his or her grades the answer
should be careful and de
manding. Does the grade re
flect intellect or memoriza
tion? Does it demonstrate
creativity or regurgitation?
Was it earned by hard honest
work or was the prof just an
easy grader? Is it a result of
an intellectual adventure or
of timid course selection?
Only the student can answer;
a good student does answer.
And if a particular B- was a
hard, adventurous, creative
li- then its superiority over
the easy, timid, unimagina
tive A can be clearly noted.
Students can rise above
grades. I believe students
should be their own judges
— critical and honest — with
no more than respectful con
sideration for the hazy judg
ment imposed by /4's, C's,
plusscs and minusses. Then
students should act in light of
their own best judgement, not
in the myopic judgement of
others.
Th ere is nothing wrong
with grades — there is some
thing wrong with how grades
are interpreted. So why not
try the little stars?
