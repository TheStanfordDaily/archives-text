# Campus drug policy unaffected by last week's student arrests

The University will not alter the way
it handles drug problems in reaction to
the drug-related arrests of two Stan
ford students last week. University of
ficials said.
The two students, John Mack and
Darryl Singh, were arrested on
charges of producing and selling am
phetamines. Singh, a sophomore, was
picked up outside his Manzanita
trailer. His trailer was then searched,
and laboratory equipment was found.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said that he didn't forsee any
changes forthcoming as a result of last
week's arrest. "The University has
never seen the simple use of drugs as
meriting any disciplinary response,"
Lyons said. However, "The University
doesn't condone drug use because it
has no rule against it,"he said.
"1 am aware that in any given year,
some dorms have to come to terms
with drug use in their dorm," Lyons
said. The University can find out

about drug use in a dorm either from
the police if they take action or if a
student makes a complaint in the Pres
ident's Office, he said.
'Reserves right'
While the University ''reserves and
has the right to suspend" a student for
drug abuse, Lyons said that this would
only occur if the student's actions were
"detrimental to the educational pro
cess at Stanford."
"There will be no crackdown on
drug use in the dorms, said Norm
Robinson, dean of residential educa
tion. "We will raise the issue with the
resident staff to discuss the problem,"
he said.
"Residential education doesn't see
itself as arms of the state," Robinson
said. "We don't expect resident staff
to go around enforcing state laws," he
said.
No action
Robinson also said that no action
will be taken against Singh because of
his arrest.
"There are a whole slate of penal-

ties available in varying degrees of
punishment" should the decision be
made to take action against a student.
University Counsel John Schwartz
said. "The most severe of these is expul
sion," he said.
According to official University pol
icy regarding drug abuse, in the 1978
Information Bulletin, the University
will handle drug related problems "in
such a manner as to safeguard to the
greatest possible extent its capacity to
carry out its educational mission."
The University "will continue to
provide educational and informational
programs about drugs and will en
courage use of counseling services
provided on a confidential basis by the
Health Service and other appropriate
agencies." The University "explicitly
refuses to act as a sanctuary from en
forcement of the drug laws by those
agencies who have that responsibil
ity."
"There have been very few, it any,
instances of complaints being brought
