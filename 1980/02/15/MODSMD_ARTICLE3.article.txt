# Campus drug policy unaffected by last week's student arrests
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
The University will not alter the way
it handles drug problems in reaction to
the drug-related arrests of two Stan
ford students last week. University of
ficials said.
The two students, John Mack and
Darryl Singh, were arrested on
charges of producing and selling am
phetamines. Singh, a sophomore, was
picked up outside his Manzanita
trailer. His trailer was then searched,
and laboratory equipment was found.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said that he didn't forsee any
changes forthcoming as a result of last
week's arrest. "The University has
never seen the simple use of drugs as
meriting any disciplinary response,"
Lyons said. However, "The University
doesn't condone drug use because it
has no rule against it,"he said.
"1 am aware that in any given year,
some dorms have to come to terms
with drug use in their dorm," Lyons
said. The University can find out

about drug use in a dorm either from
the police if they take action or if a
student makes a complaint in the Pres
ident's Office, he said.
'Reserves right'
While the University ''reserves and
has the right to suspend" a student for
drug abuse, Lyons said that this would
only occur if the student's actions were
"detrimental to the educational pro
cess at Stanford."
"There will be no crackdown on
drug use in the dorms, said Norm
Robinson, dean of residential educa
tion. "We will raise the issue with the
resident staff to discuss the problem,"
he said.
"Residential education doesn't see
itself as arms of the state," Robinson
said. "We don't expect resident staff
to go around enforcing state laws," he
said.
No action
Robinson also said that no action
will be taken against Singh because of
his arrest.
"There are a whole slate of penal-

ties available in varying degrees of
punishment" should the decision be
made to take action against a student.
University Counsel John Schwartz
said. "The most severe of these is expul
sion," he said.
According to official University pol
icy regarding drug abuse, in the 1978
Information Bulletin, the University
will handle drug related problems "in
such a manner as to safeguard to the
greatest possible extent its capacity to
carry out its educational mission."
The University "will continue to
provide educational and informational
programs about drugs and will en
courage use of counseling services
provided on a confidential basis by the
Health Service and other appropriate
agencies." The University "explicitly
refuses to act as a sanctuary from en
forcement of the drug laws by those
agencies who have that responsibil
ity."
"There have been very few, it any,
instances of complaints being brought
to the President's Office about drug
abuse," Schwartz said. "I cannot recall
any disciplinary action taken by the
University" for drug related problems,
he said.
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington said that he doesn't see his
department doing anything different
as a result of last week's arrests. Her
rington said,that his department does
not directly investigate drug problems
on campus. All information received
by the department goes to a county
wide task force which conducts the ac
tual investigations, he said.
"My men are all known on cam
pus," Herrington said. "There is not
much point in putting someone from
my staff under cover," he said.
Effectiveness
Although Stanford police will arrest
campus residents it they see a violation
ot the drug laws, the combined task
force is more productive in investigat
ing drug trafficking, he said.
"What people do behind closed
doors is their business," Herrington
said. "There is no way legally or prac
tically that I'm going to go out knock
ing on doors looking for drug viola
tions," he said.
"1 can't recall other cases where

there have been investigations for
drug manufacture on campus," Her
rington said. He called the recent situ
ation an "isolated incident" and said
he is "not sure that anything took
place on campus."
No contact
Stanford police were not contacted
about the investigation until a day or
two before the Singh arrest on campus
was made, Herrington said. "They
(the state investigative unit) asked us
to arrest him if he showed up" because
they could not locate Singh, he said.
Stanford police took no part in the
actual investigation, Herrington said.
Jan Van Houghton, residential di
rector at Manzanita, said that she was
"in the dark" about the investigation
and the alleged drug manufacture in
the trailer. No one made a complaint
to either Van Houghton or her hous
ing associates (RAs), she said.
While she has been in contact with
Singh and his roommates, she said that
her "role will be at a minimum" in this
case.
Cynthia Carlson, RA for Singh's
trailer, said she lirst heard about the
arrest from Singh's trailermates. Prior
to that she knew nothing of the alleged
criminal activities that were taking
place in the trailer.

to go around enforcing state laws," he
said.
No action
Robinson also said that no action
will be taken against Singh because of
his arrest.
"There are a whole slate of penal-

ties available in varying degrees of
punishment" should the decision be
made to take action against a student.
University Counsel John Schwartz
said. "The most severe of these is expul
sion," he said.
According to official University pol
icy regarding drug abuse, in the 1978
Information Bulletin, the University
will handle drug related problems "in
such a manner as to safeguard to the
greatest possible extent its capacity to
carry out its educational mission."
The University "will continue to
provide educational and informational
programs about drugs and will en
courage use of counseling services
provided on a confidential basis by the
Health Service and other appropriate
agencies." The University "explicitly
refuses to act as a sanctuary from en
forcement of the drug laws by those
agencies who have that responsibil
ity."
"There have been very few, it any,
instances of complaints being brought
to the President's Office about drug
abuse," Schwartz said. "I cannot recall
any disciplinary action taken by the
University" for drug related problems,
he said.
Stanford Police Chief Marv Her
rington said that he doesn't see his
department doing anything different
as a result of last week's arrests. Her
rington said,that his department does
not directly investigate drug problems
on campus. All information received
by the department goes to a county
wide task force which conducts the ac
tual investigations, he said.
"My men are all known on cam
pus," Herrington said. "There is not
much point in putting someone from
my staff under cover," he said.
Effectiveness
Although Stanford police will arrest
campus residents it they see a violation
ot the drug laws, the combined task
force is more productive in investigat
ing drug trafficking, he said.
"What people do behind closed
doors is their business," Herrington
said. "There is no way legally or prac
tically that I'm going to go out knock
ing on doors looking for drug viola
tions," he said.
"1 can't recall other cases where

there have been investigations for
drug manufacture on campus," Her
rington said. He called the recent situ
ation an "isolated incident" and said
he is "not sure that anything took
place on campus."
No contact
Stanford police were not contacted
about the investigation until a day or
two before the Singh arrest on campus
was made, Herrington said. "They
(the state investigative unit) asked us
to arrest him if he showed up" because
they could not locate Singh, he said.
Stanford police took no part in the
actual investigation, Herrington said.
Jan Van Houghton, residential di
rector at Manzanita, said that she was
"in the dark" about the investigation
and the alleged drug manufacture in
the trailer. No one made a complaint
to either Van Houghton or her hous
ing associates (RAs), she said.
While she has been in contact with
Singh and his roommates, she said that
her "role will be at a minimum" in this
case.
Cynthia Carlson, RA for Singh's
trailer, said she lirst heard about the
arrest from Singh's trailermates. Prior
to that she knew nothing of the alleged
criminal activities that were taking
place in the trailer.
The University will not alter the way
it handles drug problems in reaction to
the drug-related arrests of two Stan
ford students last week. University of
ficials said.
The two students, John Mack and
Darryl Singh, were arrested on
charges of producing and selling am
phetamines. Singh, a sophomore, was
picked up outside his Manzanita
trailer. His trailer was then searched,
and laboratory equipment was found.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons said that he didn't forsee any
changes forthcoming as a result of last
week's arrest. "The University has
never seen the simple use of drugs as
meriting any disciplinary response,"
Lyons said. However, "The University
doesn't condone drug use because it
has no rule against it,"he said.
"1 am aware that in any given year,
some dorms have to come to terms
with drug use in their dorm," Lyons
said. The University can find out

about drug use in a dorm either from
the police if they take action or if a
student makes a complaint in the Pres
ident's Office, he said.
'Reserves right'
While the University ''reserves and
has the right to suspend" a student for
drug abuse, Lyons said that this would
only occur if the student's actions were
"detrimental to the educational pro
cess at Stanford."
"There will be no crackdown on
drug use in the dorms, said Norm
Robinson, dean of residential educa
tion. "We will raise the issue with the
resident staff to discuss the problem,"
he said.
"Residential education doesn't see
itself as arms of the state," Robinson
said. "We don't expect resident staff
to go around enforcing state laws," he
said.

will be taken against Singh because of
his arrest.
