## Just going through a phase 
### 
"I don't really care about grades," he says,
"after all I'm here to learn, right?" Our stu
dent, a freshman, likely as not, has entered
phase one of the Stanford Student Grade Rela
tions Process (SSGRP). The SSGRP is a four
part development process which Stanford stu
dents go through during their years here. Do
all students go through the SSGRP? Who
knows. I know I did. And since I represent the
sum total of my field work on the subject, I
have no evidence to the contrary.
Phase One: Our student arrives at Stanford
happy to have been accepted at the Great Uni
versity. He wants to take advantage of the
wonderful academic possibilities. He's going to
be here a while. Grades, good or bad, will not
directly affect his life for a few years yet (his
parents are still amazed that he got in). He can
afford to be noble. He doesn't care about
grades. He wants to learn.
His roommate threatens suicide over a
Chem 33 mid-term. He tells his roommate not
to be upset. After all, what's important is that
he really understands molecules. "D" is just
another letter. His rommate looks at him
strangely, and walks away. The roommate is
already in Phase Two.
In Phase Two of the SSGRI', grades really
matter. It doesn't seem so long until the college
years are going to end. Our former Phase One
freshman is developing a new image of the
outside world — cold, cruel, and grade
conscious. He is surprised that they don't ask
for a transcript when he applies for a passport.
Every day (no cuts) he goes to lecture and
listens to the professors who he knows will
shape his GPA. Every day they pour out wis
dom, an hour at a time. He does his best to
collect it in his head and his notebook.
What do the wise professors ask in return?
Two or three times a quarter they ask him to
return a little bit of that wisdom on paper. Not
much, considering the number of lectures at
tended and books read.
lie takes the tests. He hands them in. They
disappear. Weeks later they return with a
grade on the front and, perhaps, a single com
ment at the end of an essav — "A little weak

here." Maybe the grader is trying to be nice,
but our student knows it is his own fault. He
knows that the grader looked down through
those scrappy blue books and graded his soul.
"Face it kid," he says to himself, "you're a
loser." Phase Two is no fun.
Finally, in the depths of despair, tears
streaming down his cheeks, he goes to his pro
fessor's office hours. He is not trying to get his
grade changed. He simply wants an opinion on
his conviction that his brightest possible future
is in the French Foreign Legion. The professor
looks at his exam and grumbles something
about TA's. Then, without being asked, he
changes the B / to an ,4.
Our student leaves the office with the re
graded final in his hand. He has entered Phase
Three. He has figured it all out. All he has to
do is push the system a little. He is in control
again. Unfortunately. Phase Three is the shor
test of the SSGRP stages. For a little while our
student is on top of the world. Then, a few
weeks later, he goes to another professor with
another exam he doesn't like. He wants his A
changed to an A. The professor looks at the
exam, grumbles something about TAs, and
lowers the grade to a C plus.
Now, when asked about grades, our student
shrugs. The shrug is the mark of Phase Four. In
a sense our student has given up. In a sense he
simply knows better than to try. He recognizes
the random element in the Stanford Grading
System. He knows that some grades are on base
and others are in left field. He knows that some
professors can be reasoned with and some can
not. He knows that every time he takes a test
or hands in a paper, in one sense, he is gambl
ing. And if he still wants to be a lawyer and not
a refrigerator repairman he knows that he may
be gambling for high stakes.
Unlike the tormented student in Phase Two,
he knows that grades are not judgments of his
personal worth, intelligence or moral charac
ter. He is aware, however, that random though
they be, they may affect his future. Personally,
I haven't made it beyond Phase Four.

versity. He wants to take advantage of the
wonderful academic possibilities. He's going to
be here a while. Grades, good or bad, will not
directly affect his life for a few years yet (his
parents are still amazed that he got in). He can
afford to be noble. He doesn't care about
grades. He wants to learn.
His roommate threatens suicide over a
Chem 33 mid-term. He tells his roommate not
to be upset. After all, what's important is that
he really understands molecules. "D" is just
another letter. His rommate looks at him
strangely, and walks away. The roommate is
already in Phase Two.
In Phase Two of the SSGRI', grades really
matter. It doesn't seem so long until the college
years are going to end. Our former Phase One
freshman is developing a new image of the
outside world — cold, cruel, and grade
conscious. He is surprised that they don't ask
for a transcript when he applies for a passport.
Every day (no cuts) he goes to lecture and
listens to the professors who he knows will
shape his GPA. Every day they pour out wis
dom, an hour at a time. He does his best to
collect it in his head and his notebook.
What do the wise professors ask in return?
Two or three times a quarter they ask him to
return a little bit of that wisdom on paper. Not
much, considering the number of lectures at
tended and books read.
lie takes the tests. He hands them in. They
disappear. Weeks later they return with a
grade on the front and, perhaps, a single com
ment at the end of an essav — "A little weak

here." Maybe the grader is trying to be nice,
but our student knows it is his own fault. He
knows that the grader looked down through
those scrappy blue books and graded his soul.
"Face it kid," he says to himself, "you're a
loser." Phase Two is no fun.
Finally, in the depths of despair, tears
streaming down his cheeks, he goes to his pro
fessor's office hours. He is not trying to get his
grade changed. He simply wants an opinion on
his conviction that his brightest possible future
is in the French Foreign Legion. The professor
looks at his exam and grumbles something
about TA's. Then, without being asked, he
changes the B / to an ,4.
Our student leaves the office with the re
graded final in his hand. He has entered Phase
Three. He has figured it all out. All he has to
do is push the system a little. He is in control
again. Unfortunately. Phase Three is the shor
test of the SSGRP stages. For a little while our
student is on top of the world. Then, a few
weeks later, he goes to another professor with
another exam he doesn't like. He wants his A
changed to an A. The professor looks at the
exam, grumbles something about TAs, and
lowers the grade to a C plus.
Now, when asked about grades, our student
shrugs. The shrug is the mark of Phase Four. In
a sense our student has given up. In a sense he
simply knows better than to try. He recognizes
the random element in the Stanford Grading
System. He knows that some grades are on base
and others are in left field. He knows that some
professors can be reasoned with and some can
not. He knows that every time he takes a test
or hands in a paper, in one sense, he is gambl
ing. And if he still wants to be a lawyer and not
a refrigerator repairman he knows that he may
be gambling for high stakes.
Unlike the tormented student in Phase Two,
he knows that grades are not judgments of his
personal worth, intelligence or moral charac
ter. He is aware, however, that random though
they be, they may affect his future. Personally,
I haven't made it beyond Phase Four.

"I don't really care about grades," he says,
"after all I'm here to learn, right?" Our stu
dent, a freshman, likely as not, has entered
phase one of the Stanford Student Grade Rela
tions Process (SSGRP). The SSGRP is a four
part development process which Stanford stu
dents go through during their years here. Do
all students go through the SSGRP? Who
knows. I know I did. And since I represent the
sum total of my field work on the subject, I
have no evidence to the contrary.
