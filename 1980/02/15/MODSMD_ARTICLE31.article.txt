## Ax grades for evaluations 
### 
I believe, without hesitation, that Stanford
and other universities should abandon grades
in favor of a system of evaluation by professor
comments.
The primary problem with any grading sys
tem is that it is far too easy. It encourages a
student meet set criteria. It does not encourage
him to innovate, experiment and explore. The
student who is concerned primarily with a
grade, when writing a paper or completing a
final exam, is likely to play it safe; that is, his
answers will reflect what he thinks the profes
sor wants to hear, not what he really believes.
If, on the other hand, the student is going to
be evaluated by comments, he will probably try
to make his work as original and individual as
possible. As a result, he will learn more about
his subject matter and himself; this is what the

object of going to college ought to be.
From the professor's side of the desk also,
evaluation is preferable to grading. A, H, Cand
D can provide only the vaguest approximation
ot a student's achievement. There are far more
than four types of student, but there are only
four different grades, and when an instructor
categorizes a student by grade, he does so at
the risk of dehumanizing the student.
There are an infinite number of comments
however, allowing the professor to treat the
student with greater thought and individual
care. Such treatment would result in the stu
dent learning what his academic strengths and
weaknesses are, a result one could not gain
from a symbolic letter.
