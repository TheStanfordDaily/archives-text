Reduce oil imports
• Last Sunday, Rep. Pete
McCloskey told a Stanford au
dience that nuclear power was
necessary to reduce national
consumption of imported oil.
His assertion, though widely be
lieved, is patently false.
If every nation in the Organi
zation for Economic Coopera
tion and Development
(OECD), i.e. most Western, in
dustrial nations, were to convert
its oil power stations into nuc
lear power stations overnight,
total OECD consumption of
imported oil would drop by only
12 percent, and the imported
fraction of all OECD oil con
sumption would drop from 65
percent to 60 percent. The truth
is that cars and industries con
sume nearly all oil imports, not
electric utilities.
If the United States really de
sires to cut oil imports signific
antly, it need only double or
quadruple the efficiency of its
autos. Car efficiencies well over
100 miles per gallon are now
feasible. For example, a hybrid
Volkswagen reusing brake
energy with a small bank of
batteries now gets over 80 miles
per gallon. Let's encourage the
honorable McCloskey to stop

promoting nuclear power for
vacuous reasons and to start de
manding real solutions from De
troit to reduce our oil import
dependency.

Parking lots full
I am writing about your article
on the University parking lots
(Daily, Feb. 7) in which the di
rector of the University's de
partment of public safety is
paraphrased to the effect that
University planners had antici
pated losing 2000 to 3000 park
ing places but" We're about even
now — or at least we should be."
If Marvin Herrington in fact
believes this to be the case I
would suggest that he try to find
a parking place in the vicinity of
the Mitchell, Durand, McCul
lough, Terman, ERL, AEL and
campus computer facility build
ings during the day.
While there does, in fact, seem
to be a surplus of "C' parking
places in the vicinity of the En
cina tennis courts, that certainly
isn't the situation in the above
areas.

Palm Drive repair
It is time the University de
voted some of its resources to
renovation of Palm Drive. In the
nine years of my employment
here the only work done to this
road has been the improvement
of the northwest bike path and
the application of an asphalt
slurry a lew years ago which
made the surface more rutted
and unsafe due to sagging of the
coating.
Every year I have watched
hundreds of yards of Campus
Drive that were in fine repair
get repaved with hot mix paving,
and other sections of roadway
that are little used or blocked off
get completely dug up and reno
vated.
Palm Drive needs major, ex
pensive work since the base has
to be replaced, regraded and
drainage improved before pav
ing. Considering the safety
hazards incurred by heavy traf
fic, deep puddles, too high a
crown and major ruts and
washboarding, combined with
no adequate bicycle path on the
southeast side I feel that the
other road projects should be
deferred and first priority given
to Palm Drive.
I don't believe efforts to dis

courage vehicular traffic on
campus will be greatly set back
by a properly constructed Palm
Drive.

Women's golf team
In regard to the article about
the new golf coach, David
Yates, there was one thing over
looked — the women's golf
team. That's right, there is a
women's golf team, and it's a
very good one In fact, team
member Debbie Barberio shot a
record breaking 69 at the Stan
ford golf course on Monday en
route to Stanford's tie with San
Jose State (ranked in the top
three in the nation).
Not only was the omission of
the women's team upsetting to
me, but also that David Yates
was called the first-year coach of
the men's golf team. He is the
Director of Golf at Stanford, a
title which includes the direction
of both the men's and women's
teams.
I believe David Yates will be
an excellent coach for us — all
of us.

Doors hazardous
The foot activated, electrically
operated doors in the Medical
Center are a total waste of
energy and, in some instances, a
real hazard. Walking just a bit
too fast, treading on the rubber
pad, heading toward a door
which suddenly opensaf you, in
stead of away from you causes a
rude jolt to, shall we say, the per
sona?
The very recent installation of
these electric doors, at a time
when the nation is becoming so
energy conscious, seems an un
usual extravagance on the part of
the Medical Center.
Additionally, with physical
fitness so important, can pushing
or pulling open a door be a gross
inconvenience?

Caps, gowns rented
In response (Daily, Feb. 5) to
Gary Chapman's letter concern
ing cap and gown rental, we
would like to set the record
straight. The University con
tracts with the Stanford
Bookstore to rent caps and
gowns for students, faculty and
staff for commencement. For
many years, the Bookstore has

rented from Collegiate Cap and
Gown in Los Angeles. The
Bookstore did receive the letter
from the ILGWU, and notified
them that the Stanford
Bookstore does not do business
with Cotrell and Leonard.

Don't block access
Ramps have been installed so
that people in wheelchairs can
get around campus indepen
dently without asking for assis
tance. Many people, however,
are using these ramps for bicycle
traffic; this creates a dangerous
situation for wheelchair riders.
People are also parking their
bicycles directly across the access
routes to and from the ramps.
My window faces a wheelchair
ramps and right now, there are
two ten-speeds obstructing ac
cess for a wheelchair user on this
ramp. How many of you could
maneuver a wheelchair around a
bicycle parked. l smack in the mid
dle of a ramp?
People are also parking their

bicycles where they directly
block access to building doors,
thus creating hazardous condi
tions for the blind or partially
sighted.
Please, bicyclists, do not
obstruct ramps or doors. Park in
the bicycle racks provided or
park close to them. Don't — in
your desire to get as close as pos
sible to your destination — block
the way for someone who has no
alternative.

Speech clarified
The article on the "town hall"
meeting in Kresge (Daily, Feb.
13) reports incorrectly that I
spoke in opposition to registra
tion. What I actually said was
that, while I could see no need
tor a draft, I could envisage a
variety of situations in which
mobilization would be just and
proper, and that therefore (not
being a principled pacifist) I saw
no grounds for opposing regist
ration in principle. I would
rather urge an effort to distri
bute the burden of national ser
vice more equitably and univer
sally.
