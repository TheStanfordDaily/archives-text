# Sled reopens slopes to disabled
## 
### Mac Funk Staff Writer 
Anyone who is pursuing a
master's degree in product de
sign at Stanford, participating in
national engineering research
competition, and swimming,
sailing, skiing and living small
airplanes in his spare time is
bound to gain the title of "an
active person."
The description takes on spe
cial significance, however, when
applied to Pete Axelson, who
carries out all these activities
and more, even though he is
paralyzed below the waist. Last
week, Axelson traveled to
Geilo. Norway, where he par
ticipated in the Second Olympic
Winter Games for the Disabled.

The specific purpose of Axel
son's trip to Norway was not to
compete, however. The games
were a chance for Axelson to
familiarize the disabled world
with his latest design project: a
new skiing sled for the hand
icapped. called Arroya.
Axelson's is not the first sled
designed for disabled skiers.
The Norwegian pulk sled has
been used for vears. Axelson
was introduced to the pulk sled
two years ago, when he ven
tured onto the slopes for the
first time after the 1975 moun
taineering accident that left him

paralyzed. He found the pulk
was limited to slopes of,mild
steepness and difficulty because
it lacked directional and speed
control.
Axelson went to his own
drawing hoard and designed Ar
roya.
Last winter, Axelson tried it
out in the snow and found that
he was able to easily control
both the direction and the speed
of Arroya on intermediate runs.
He demonstrated it last March
in the National Handicapped
Ski Championships in Winter
Park, Colo. On his trip to Nor
way, Axelson said, he de
monstrated that downhill skiing
for diabled athletes can be chal
lenging as well as safe.

The most significant innova
tion in Arroya is the addition of
stainless steel edges along the
bottom of the sled, which allow
for turning and stopping on var
ying terrain and 111 varying con
ditions.
Axelson also upgraded the
methods for securely fastening
the skiier onto the sled so that
maximum control can be main
tained.
A major barrier that disabled
athletes face is other people's
mental limitations on what dis
abled athletes can do. Axelson's
Arroya won first place in the

student design competition at
the Interagency Conference for
Rehabilitation Engineering,
partly because he thought of
every detail involved jn the use
of the sled.
No need to stop
The sled is so efficient that
with a helpful friend riding with
him. Axelson can get on and off
a conventional chairlilt without
the lilt stopping. Yet Axelson
tells of the Colorado lilt
operator who simply would not
believe him and insisted on
stopping the lift when Axelson
reached the top.
However, Airoya is gradually
gaining acceptance and recogni-

tion, at least in the United
States. The I9<SO National
Handicapped Ski Champion
ships this March in Winter Park.
Colo., will for the first time
include an event for downhill
skiers in sled-like devices, and
Arroya sleds will be provided
for those who do not own their
own sleds.
Sleds will also he provided to
instructors in many U.S. ski
areas, and feedback from those
instructors will help the further
development of Arroya.
Workshop
Axelson will also share his in

sights into the design of equip
ment for disabled athletes when
he eo-directs a technical work
shop at the International Con
ference on Rehabilitation En
gineering this summer in To
ronto.
At last year's conference. Ar
roya won first place in the stu
dent design competition.
Most obstacles to the design
ot challenging skiing programs
for the disabled are not
technological but are rooted in
people's attitudes toward the
development of equipment for
handicapped athletes.
Norwegians
The Norwegians have tradi
tionally been at the forefront of
disabled sports, but in interact
ing with them Axelson found
definite limits set on who could
participate in a given sport, and
a tendency to design sports
around the equipment already
available.
The pulk sled has been used
in Scandinavian countries for
centuries, as a means of pulling
children or supplies behind a
cross-country skier.
According to Axelson. it was
only a matter of time before
they thought of putting a person
on the sled and sending them
down a hill. But there has not
been much of an effort to give
the person on the sled the same
control a normal skier enjoys.
Hang oil
Thus the Norwegians are ad
venturous enough to send pulk
sleds down bobsled runs, but the
best they can do for safety and
control is "to get a very good
helmet and hang on tight," said
Axelson.
Leaning, or even dragging a
hand are all the steering availa
ble. and if one fails to hit the
turn just right, one may find
oneself over the edge of a 10-
foot-high bank turn. The de
vices of Arroya allow one to let
it go full speed over bob sled
courses as well as down fairly
steep ski slopes.
The special significance of
Arroya for Axelson is the fact
that it gives disabled skiers un
limited freedom to participate in
their sport. "Wheelchair sports
are fine." said Axelson, "but
you only participate with other
wheelchair athletes."
Disabled athletes thus find
this isolates them from the
mainstream of sports. "It is im
portant to get out and become
fully integrated." he said.

Most obstacles to the design
ot challenging skiing programs
for the disabled are not
technological but are rooted in
people's attitudes toward the
development of equipment for
handicapped athletes.
Norwegians
The Norwegians have tradi
tionally been at the forefront of
disabled sports, but in interact
ing with them Axelson found
definite limits set on who could
participate in a given sport, and
a tendency to design sports
around the equipment already
available.
The pulk sled has been used
in Scandinavian countries for
centuries, as a means of pulling
children or supplies behind a
cross-country skier.
According to Axelson. it was
only a matter of time before
they thought of putting a person
on the sled and sending them
down a hill. But there has not
been much of an effort to give
the person on the sled the same
control a normal skier enjoys.
Hang oil
Thus the Norwegians are ad
venturous enough to send pulk
sleds down bobsled runs, but the
best they can do for safety and
control is "to get a very good
helmet and hang on tight," said
Axelson.
Leaning, or even dragging a
hand are all the steering availa
ble. and if one fails to hit the
turn just right, one may find
oneself over the edge of a 10-
foot-high bank turn. The de
vices of Arroya allow one to let
it go full speed over bob sled
courses as well as down fairly
steep ski slopes.
The special significance of
Arroya for Axelson is the fact
that it gives disabled skiers un
limited freedom to participate in
their sport. "Wheelchair sports
are fine." said Axelson, "but
you only participate with other
wheelchair athletes."
Disabled athletes thus find
this isolates them from the
mainstream of sports. "It is im
portant to get out and become
fully integrated." he said.

Anyone who is pursuing a
master's degree in product de
sign at Stanford, participating in
national engineering research
competition, and swimming,
sailing, skiing and living small
airplanes in his spare time is
bound to gain the title of "an
active person."
The description takes on spe
cial significance, however, when
applied to Pete Axelson, who
carries out all these activities
and more, even though he is
paralyzed below the waist. Last
week, Axelson traveled to
Geilo. Norway, where he par
ticipated in the Second Olympic
Winter Games for the Disabled.

The specific purpose of Axel
son's trip to Norway was not to
compete, however. The games
were a chance for Axelson to
familiarize the disabled world
with his latest design project: a
new skiing sled for the hand
icapped. called Arroya.
Axelson's is not the first sled
designed for disabled skiers.
The Norwegian pulk sled has
been used for vears. Axelson
was introduced to the pulk sled
two years ago, when he ven
tured onto the slopes for the
first time after the 1975 moun
taineering accident that left him

paralyzed. He found the pulk
was limited to slopes of,mild
steepness and difficulty because
it lacked directional and speed
control.
Axelson went to his own
drawing hoard and designed Ar
roya.
Last winter, Axelson tried it
out in the snow and found that
he was able to easily control
both the direction and the speed
of Arroya on intermediate runs.
He demonstrated it last March
in the National Handicapped
Ski Championships in Winter
Park, Colo. On his trip to Nor
way, Axelson said, he de
monstrated that downhill skiing
for diabled athletes can be chal
lenging as well as safe.

The most significant innova
tion in Arroya is the addition of
stainless steel edges along the
bottom of the sled, which allow
for turning and stopping on var
ying terrain and 111 varying con
ditions.
Axelson also upgraded the
methods for securely fastening
the skiier onto the sled so that
maximum control can be main
tained.
A major barrier that disabled
athletes face is other people's
mental limitations on what dis
abled athletes can do. Axelson's
Arroya won first place in the

student design competition at
the Interagency Conference for
Rehabilitation Engineering,
partly because he thought of
every detail involved jn the use
of the sled.
No need to stop
The sled is so efficient that
with a helpful friend riding with
him. Axelson can get on and off
a conventional chairlilt without
the lilt stopping. Yet Axelson
tells of the Colorado lilt
operator who simply would not
believe him and insisted on
stopping the lift when Axelson
reached the top.
However, Airoya is gradually
gaining acceptance and recogni-

tion, at least in the United
States. The I9<SO National
Handicapped Ski Champion
ships this March in Winter Park.
Colo., will for the first time
include an event for downhill
skiers in sled-like devices, and
Arroya sleds will be provided
for those who do not own their
own sleds.
Sleds will also he provided to
instructors in many U.S. ski
areas, and feedback from those
instructors will help the further
development of Arroya.
