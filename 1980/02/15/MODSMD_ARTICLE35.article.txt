Since today is the day after Valentine's Day, I
had originally planned to make this column into a
rather lovey-dovey atfair. At least, I thought, 1
could attempt to discuss the implications ol oxer
enthusiastic romantic activity. Alas, none of you
red-hot Romeos wrote to me (you were weighted
down by midterms. I suppose) to explicitly detail
your problems or successes.
Not adept at titillating fabrication or lurid pre
varication. I prefer to stick to the facts. Anyway,
in the interest of truth, honesty and journalistic
responsibility, I feel compelled to correct the in
formation concerning the ingestion of heavy water
of the Feb. I On Call. I dug up my response from
11 Ceil th Physics, and apparently it was inaccurate. I
hope that nothing drastic lias occurred or that no
one has done anything rash as a result of my
transgression.
Alice Walker, administrative service coor
dinator "ol the magnetic resonance laboratory,
wrote that:
"Deuterium oxide is not a controlled substance
in the United States. It is readily available (for a
price) from Merck, Bio-Rad Labs. Alt!rich and
Stoliler Isotopes, to name but a few. To equate
this stable isotope in any way with plutonium is
totally absurd.
Furthermore, several studies have been done on
the effects of deuteration in mammals. Research
by Kat/ et al. showed that mice drinking 30 per
cent D(2)0 lived for 60 days, while those ingest
ing 75 percent deuterium oxide survived only 12
days.
"A body-tissue fluid concentration of the sub
stance between 30 to 40 percent resulted in death.
The incorporation ol deuterium into liver, kidney
and spleen reached equilibrium In the third week.

Incorporation of deuterium into the brain was
much slower, but eventually reached the same
value.
"In a study by Hayes and Palmer, it was deter
mined that loco motor activity in mice was sup
pressed by ingestion ol D(2)C). though this pro
cess was reversible when body fluids were again
replaced with water."
Why is there a couch-bed in the women's room
at UGLY, hut not in the men's.' Does the Univer
sity figure that the "tough men" don't need one?
Actually, I've never seen anyone using the bed in
the women's room anyway.
What gives?

Dear Snooper:
Do you spend a lot ol time in mutli-sexbath
rooms? To stop mincing words, though, your
contention does appear to be true. Kathy I ehrn.
the Meyer secretary, said that the state of events
you described is "the standard way tor restrooms
to be built." She said it's been done that way all
the way back to year one. and that the bathrooms
were just naturally set up differently when the
building was being planned in the I 950 sand con
structed in the '60s.
The benches are there because women might be
faint for whatever reason, Fehrn claimed. Unfor
tunately, no figures are available for their fre
quency of use. I refuse to comment or speculate
on the above reasoning, although it does seem to
indicate that men are expected to maintain a con
stant level of consciousness.
