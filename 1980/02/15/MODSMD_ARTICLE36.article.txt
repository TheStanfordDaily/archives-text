## Nothing to lose 
### 
It finally happened. After dropping eight straight, and
suffering 36 days of frustration, the Stanford men's bas
ketball team finally won a game. They had been playing
well for a couple of weeks, but they couldn't quite put it all
together until Monday night. For the first time in a long
time. Stanford simply outplayed a good basketball team.
It was a game that had to feel good to Stanford coach
Dick Dißiaso. who has led his team this season to a lowly
2-11 Pac-10 record (6-15 overall) and has proved in his
five years on the Farm that time and fairly good coaching
do not always cure an ailing basketball program. He has
found out that Stanford basketball is a damn tough cross to
bear. But the team had been blasted and then all but
ignored by the press and community this year until Di-
Biaso opened up his bag of tricks a couple of weeks ago
and almost knocked off the then number two team in the
country. Orenon State. Then things began to turn around a
little. '
The Cards were using the same players and the same
style (which Dißiaso himself pointed out at the beginning
of the season is no particular style at all), but something
was different. Stanford began to play better basketball
down in Arizona.
What had changed was that the players began to get an
inkling that the season, as far as a respectable finish in the
Pac-10 mattered, was for naught. They began to realize
that they had fallen below having to prove anything to
anybody and started to relax. Then they went and proved
something
The Cardinals started to show in Arizona that the best
way to win basketball games is to play loosely. This didn't
seem to harden in the players' minds until after the
Washington State game last Saturday when they realized it
didn't matter anymore anyway. Brian Welch commented
after that game that "we have nothing to lose now, and in
fact, the team was tired of doing just that. They went out
and played a good college basketball game on Monday,
filled with all the big runs and lost leads that make the
game so special. But this time it was Stanford that kept its
composure under the heat, and this time the Cards won the
game.
Dißiaso commented that "This win was particularly
satisfying because we've been playing well these last few
weeks and not winning — we finally won one."
He analyzed the team using an instance from the game
Monday. The coach explained that Doug Marty was sup
posed to call a time out at the two-minute mark. Score:
76-74, Washington's favor. Instead. Marty drove for a
three-point play when the man on him slacked up. an
ticipating the time-out call.
"If he had missed it.he would probably be six feet under
right now." Dißiaso said. "But he didn't and that's the
kind of chance an experienced basketball player has to
take."
That's nothing-to-lose basketball.
As far as Las Vegas is concerned. Monday night's game
probably won't make much difference. As the odds are set
on Stanford for the rest of the season, they'll remain the
underdogs. But it's probably better that way; they can
keep on smiling to themselves as they work their surprises.
"The win has to be a boost." Dißiaso said. "The team
kept its morale and self-esteem up while losing and then
won. That makes it better."
The Cards have a chance to pull themselves off the
Pac-10 floor this weekend against Cal. The Bears share
last place with Stanford, the difference being that one of
their wins was against the Cardinals. Potentially, they are
probably a better team, but this year the squads are about
equal.
"We're playing well," said Marty. "We should beat
these guys."
Dißiaso added. "We can win. We just can't let them get
up on us so (Michael) Chavez can hold the ball. He's a
great ball handler and can work a great stall for them. We
also have to stop (Doug) True and (Michael) Pitts under
neath."
One thing that should help the Cards this weekend is
Tom Schmalzried's rejuvenation. The 6-11 center has
come alive for the last two games, looking particularly
good against Washington State. In that game he scored 10
points and grabbed nine rebounds. When asked what it
was that sparked Schmalzried. Dißiaso said, "1 can't exp
lain it. Some things you just can't explain."
Perhaps as a senior with a less-than-successful career, he
decided there was nothing to lose.
