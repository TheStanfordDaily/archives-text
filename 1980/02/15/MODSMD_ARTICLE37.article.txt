ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.
(AP) — A federal grand jury in
dieted former New Mexico bas
ketball coach Norm Ellenberger
Thursday on mail fraud and rac
keteering charges in connection
with the preparation ot junior
college transcripts for Lobo
athletes.
U.S. Attorney R.E.
Thompson said the indictment
charged Ellenberger and John
Whisenant, a former assistant
basketball coach at UNM. with
taking part in a scheme to de
fraud the school's dean of ad
missions, the Western Athletic
Conference and the NCAA.
Ellenberger was indicted on
five counts of mail fraud, one
count of interstate travel in aid
of racketeering enterprises and
one count of wire fraud.
Whisenant was indicted on
four counts of mail fraud.
In one instance, the indict
ment said, "the coaches pre
pared a counterfeit transcript to
make it appear that Andre
Logan (a former Lobo) had
higher grades and more credits
than he actually received" from
Mercer County Community Col
lege in Trenton, N.J.
The indictments stemmed
from a grand jury investigation

that began Dec. 13.
Ellenberger was fired Dec.
17, about three weeks after an
affidavit was filed in U.S. Dis
trict Court in which another
former basketball assistant,
Manny Goldstein, told Ellen
berger he had arranged to have
hours added to the transcript of
a junior college player.
The seven-count indictment
centered on activity involving
the junior college players,
Logan and Craig Gilbert.
The indictment said Goldstein
and an Albuquerque man, Wil
liam Blackstad, prepared a
counterfeit transcript for Logan
from Mercer showing him with
more hours than he had.
Ellenberger and Whisenant
then obtained a fake seal and
used it to emboss the transcript,
the indictment said. Whisenant
and Ellenberger then mailed the
fake transcript to the school, or
caused it to be mailed, the in
dictment said.
Ellenberger and Whisenant
also are charged with mail fraud
for mailing, or causing to be
mailed, Logan's transcript to the
NCAA and the Western Athle
tic Conference. Another count
is based on the mailing of a
check to an Albuquerque print
ing company to pay for the seal.
