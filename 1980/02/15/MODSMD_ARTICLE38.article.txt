# The 						Friday Interview
## SPORTS Belton reflects on career 
### 
Kimberly Belton, a 6-foot-7,
217 pound senior forward,
might just he the best basketball
player ever to put on a Stanford
uniform. He is undoubtedly the
mainstay of this year's team and
as early as last year people were
saying: "Where will Stanford be
without Kim Belton?" Well,
we'll find out next year when the
Bronx, N. Y. native graduates and
leaves the Cards to their own de
vices. He'll probably leave on
top of the record books though
as he needs only 13.S points and
6.8 rebounds in the next five
games to claim the career crown
in both categories. Ironically, t]u>
team he grew up with on the
Farm has only one distinction to
anticipate this year: the worst
season record in Stanford bas
ketball history. Belton talks
about this disappointment and
his career in this Friday inter
view with Sally Jenkins.
Jenkins: How would you de
scribe the attitude of the team at
this point.
Belton: We are very loose.
There is no pressure on us be
cause we know we aren't going
into post season play*. We know
we are better than our record
shows, so we are actually kind of
confident at this point.
Jenkins: How do you think this
year's team is different from last
year's?
Belton: Our attitude is no diffe
rent. Guys are still giving 100
percent whether we win or lose.
It's been that way for the four
years I have been here.
We don't have Wolfe Perry
this year, of course. He used to

take a lot of the pressure off of
Brian and myself because he
could drive and shoot. Ol
course, we also miss our key in
juries. in that respect it's diffe
rent altogether. At the begin
ning of the season we were sup
posed to be a veteran team, but
we really aren't, we have a lot of
freshmen and sophomores.
Jenkins: What would you say is
the main cause of the losing
streak you just broke?
Belton: We didn't play well
enough to win. We took ourse
lves out of a lot of games. It's a
conglomerate of a lot of things,
you can't pinpoint one. Some ot
the games we played well, we
got bad breaks. And we have
also missed some key players.
Jenkins: Have you been happy
with your own play and attitude
this season?
Belton: My attitudes have been
the same. Playing, I think I have
improved on a couple ol things.
I can't really put my finger on
because we aren't
doing well; anything I do is
closely engaged with the team.
It would be easier to pinpoint if
we were winning.
Jenkins: Would you like to play
pro ball? What do you think
your chances are?
Belton: Your guess is as good as
mine. I would definitely give it a
try. Right now my sights are on
the last five games. It's a very
competitive thing. They don't
let just anybody in. If I'm
worthy then I'll go ahead.
Jenkins: If you could start the
season again, what would you do
differently?
Belton: It I could start it again, I

would have everyone healthy
and have them stay healthy just
to see how things would turn out
in terms ot the won-loss record.
I'm sure we would have more
wins.
Jenkins: Do you feel that yon
have gotten as much out of your
career at Stanford as you
wanted?
Bolton: No. Mainly because I
wanted to be part of a winning
program. No one wants to lose
perennially, and tor four years
we have done just that. I think I

will go away feeling kind of
empty just because of our won
loss record. The things I wanted
didn't turn out.
Jenkins: Why did you come to
Stanford instead of a more athlet
ically oriented school?
Belton: Same reason you came.
You can answer that, why did
you come?
Jenkins: How successful did you
think die team could he at the
start of the season, and what
about now?
Belton: We thought maybe this
would be the year we would do

it. We had everyone coming
hack except a couple of people.
We thought we would be a
sleeper in the league. We have
been playing well ever since the
Oregon game, so I expect that
we will do well in the last five
games. We aren't making the
same mistakes, so we are pretty
optimistic. It will he hard, but I
feel confident about it.
Jekins: When you go out to prac
tice, doesn't it affect your en
thusiasm, the fact that the team
isn't going to have that good a
record?
Belton: No. Whether you win or
lose, you put it behind you. If we
had a good record we would
have to play the same way in
practice. It's my last year and I
can cherish it whether it's good
or bad. Either way you have to
put it behind you and go into the
next phase.
Jenkins: You're the veteran of
llie team and the team leader.
What do you say to the people on
the team in this kind of situation?
What can you do to help?
Belton: I just try to keep every
bodv together. The uuys voted

me captain so my role is as a
leader. I have to keep them to
gether, keep their minds on the
game and keep them light
hearted.
Jenkins: //'.s obvious front the
stands that you get frustrated on
the court. Is that right?
Helton: Oh, yeah. If you take 15
tests and you fail 10 of them
then you are naturally going to
feel frustrated. It's the same
thing. Vou still have to put that
behind you. It I have a game the
next day I have to get over it
tonight. So I go home and beat
my pillow up, slam doors, break
windows, whatever.

this point.
Belton: We are very loose.
There is no pressure on us be
cause we know we aren't going
into post season play*. We know
we are better than our record
shows, so we are actually kind of
confident at this point.
Jenkins: How do you think this
year's team is different from last
year's?
Belton: Our attitude is no diffe
rent. Guys are still giving 100
percent whether we win or lose.
It's been that way for the four
years I have been here.
We don't have Wolfe Perry
this year, of course. He used to

take a lot of the pressure off of
Brian and myself because he
could drive and shoot. Ol
course, we also miss our key in
juries. in that respect it's diffe
rent altogether. At the begin
ning of the season we were sup
posed to be a veteran team, but
we really aren't, we have a lot of
freshmen and sophomores.
Jenkins: What would you say is
the main cause of the losing
streak you just broke?
Belton: We didn't play well
enough to win. We took ourse
lves out of a lot of games. It's a
conglomerate of a lot of things,
you can't pinpoint one. Some ot
the games we played well, we
got bad breaks. And we have
also missed some key players.
Jenkins: Have you been happy
with your own play and attitude
this season?
Belton: My attitudes have been
the same. Playing, I think I have
improved on a couple ol things.
I can't really put my finger on
because we aren't
doing well; anything I do is
closely engaged with the team.
It would be easier to pinpoint if
we were winning.
Jenkins: Would you like to play
pro ball? What do you think
your chances are?
Belton: Your guess is as good as
mine. I would definitely give it a
try. Right now my sights are on
the last five games. It's a very
competitive thing. They don't
let just anybody in. If I'm
worthy then I'll go ahead.
Jenkins: If you could start the
season again, what would you do
differently?
Belton: It I could start it again, I

would have everyone healthy
and have them stay healthy just
to see how things would turn out
in terms ot the won-loss record.
I'm sure we would have more
wins.
Jenkins: Do you feel that yon
have gotten as much out of your
career at Stanford as you
wanted?
Bolton: No. Mainly because I
wanted to be part of a winning
program. No one wants to lose
perennially, and tor four years
we have done just that. I think I

will go away feeling kind of
empty just because of our won
loss record. The things I wanted
didn't turn out.
Jenkins: Why did you come to
Stanford instead of a more athlet
ically oriented school?
Belton: Same reason you came.
You can answer that, why did
you come?
Jenkins: How successful did you
think die team could he at the
start of the season, and what
about now?
Belton: We thought maybe this
would be the year we would do

it. We had everyone coming
hack except a couple of people.
We thought we would be a
sleeper in the league. We have
been playing well ever since the
Oregon game, so I expect that
we will do well in the last five
games. We aren't making the
same mistakes, so we are pretty
optimistic. It will he hard, but I
feel confident about it.
Jekins: When you go out to prac
tice, doesn't it affect your en
thusiasm, the fact that the team
isn't going to have that good a
record?
Belton: No. Whether you win or
lose, you put it behind you. If we
had a good record we would
have to play the same way in
practice. It's my last year and I
can cherish it whether it's good
or bad. Either way you have to
put it behind you and go into the
next phase.
Jenkins: You're the veteran of
llie team and the team leader.
What do you say to the people on
the team in this kind of situation?
What can you do to help?
Belton: I just try to keep every
bodv together. The uuys voted

me captain so my role is as a
leader. I have to keep them to
gether, keep their minds on the
game and keep them light
hearted.
Jenkins: //'.s obvious front the
stands that you get frustrated on
the court. Is that right?
Helton: Oh, yeah. If you take 15
tests and you fail 10 of them
then you are naturally going to
feel frustrated. It's the same
thing. Vou still have to put that
behind you. It I have a game the
next day I have to get over it
tonight. So I go home and beat
my pillow up, slam doors, break
windows, whatever.
Kimberly Belton, a 6-foot-7,
217 pound senior forward,
might just he the best basketball
player ever to put on a Stanford
uniform. He is undoubtedly the
mainstay of this year's team and
as early as last year people were
saying: "Where will Stanford be
without Kim Belton?" Well,
we'll find out next year when the
Bronx, N. Y. native graduates and
leaves the Cards to their own de
vices. He'll probably leave on
top of the record books though
as he needs only 13.S points and
6.8 rebounds in the next five
games to claim the career crown
in both categories. Ironically, t]u>
team he grew up with on the
Farm has only one distinction to
anticipate this year: the worst
season record in Stanford bas

about this disappointment and
