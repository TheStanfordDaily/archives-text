# Card ruggers upset Aussie club
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
l lie Stanford rugby team, in a
gutty display of aggressiveness
and hard-hitting defense, upset a
well-disciplined University ol
South Wales club I 1-3 in their
first international victory since
the club's start.
I he New South Wales club,
from Australia, not Wales, is on
a five game tour ol the West
Coast. They will play California
on Saturday before travelling to
Los Angeles for two more
games. They have already
beaten Cal once.
Wales started the scoring
when Steve Flynn scored a pen
alty kick early in the game to
give them a 3-0 lead.
Stanford came back quickly,
however, when Jeff Mason
scored a try near the sideline.
The score remained 4-3 when
Jamie Turner's conversion was
wide.
Most of the game in the early
going was played in Stanford's
end of the field as Wales discip
lined scrum remained together
very well. Wales could not score
a try, however, as the hard hit
ting Cards continually thwarted
their runs and caused many tur
novers in the Wales back line.
The problem in the Wales back
line was to plague them
throughout the game as they

could not score after the open
ing minutes.
Both teams had near scaring
chances in the first half, hut
could not convert. Turner mis
sed two long penalty kicks for
the Curds and l lynn missed one
for Wales.
Wales almost broke open for
a try in the first half, but a Stan
ford scrum alertly converged
and forced a turnover.
The inspired Cards then
moved the ball steadily down
the field against a seemingly
sluggish South Wales club, and
lly halt Frank I licks broke
through several players before
being forced to kick by the last
man back.
I he Cards challenged several
more times before the half en
ded. but began to have back line
problems similar to the Wales
team's. A bone-crushing tackle
by lurner deep in Wales territ
ory forced a turnover. Jean-
Cieorge MaLcor almost broke
over for the try but was stopped
only yards from the goal.
As the second half began so
did the rain. The Stanford club
seemed to improve as the
weather (rugby weather equals
rain ) (.lid. while the South Wales
club seemed lackadaisacal in the
second half's early going.
I licks broke a long run for the
Cards and Joe llamby scored a

try shortly after to give the
Cards an K-3 lead. Turner missed
another deep-angled conver
sion, but blasted a penalty kick
later to give the Cards their I 1-3
winning margin.
After the Cards early scoring
the New South Wales club set
tled down, and their scrum
played almost flawlessly, if not
brilliantly, the remainder of the
ga me.
Most of the remainder of the
second half was played at mid
field until the latter stages of the
game. The hitting by both teams
picked up considerably.
If football games are won and
lost in the "pit" then rugby
matches are won and lost in the
scrum. Both teams scrapped
furiously during the second-half

rucks and mauls ;is the game was
mostly contained there with lit
tle wide-open action.
As the hall progressed, prob
lems began to compound for
Wales. Hynn missed two pen
alty kicks and during two of the
many injury time-outs for both
sides, Wales players had to be
removed from the game.
After the jarring tackles given
by the Stanford players, how
ever, Wales seemed to wake up.
Wales threatened several times
late in the game, but Stanford
again stood up to the attack and
did not allow a score.
A fatigued Wales team even
tually let up, and Stanford
moved the ball downfield main
taining it in Wales territory for
the remainder of the game.

The Stanford Rugby Club, shown here in action from last
year, upset the New South Wales' University club from Au
stralia yesterday at Maloney Field.
l lie Stanford rugby team, in a
gutty display of aggressiveness
and hard-hitting defense, upset a
well-disciplined University ol
South Wales club I 1-3 in their
first international victory since
the club's start.
I he New South Wales club,
from Australia, not Wales, is on
a five game tour ol the West
Coast. They will play California
on Saturday before travelling to
Los Angeles for two more
games. They have already
beaten Cal once.
Wales started the scoring
when Steve Flynn scored a pen
alty kick early in the game to
give them a 3-0 lead.
Stanford came back quickly,
however, when Jeff Mason
scored a try near the sideline.
The score remained 4-3 when
Jamie Turner's conversion was
wide.
Most of the game in the early
going was played in Stanford's
end of the field as Wales discip
lined scrum remained together
very well. Wales could not score
a try, however, as the hard hit
ting Cards continually thwarted
their runs and caused many tur
novers in the Wales back line.
The problem in the Wales back
line was to plague them
throughout the game as they

could not score after the open
ing minutes.
Both teams had near scaring
chances in the first half, hut
could not convert. Turner mis
sed two long penalty kicks for
the Curds and l lynn missed one
for Wales.
Wales almost broke open for
a try in the first half, but a Stan
ford scrum alertly converged
and forced a turnover.
The inspired Cards then
moved the ball steadily down
the field against a seemingly
sluggish South Wales club, and
lly halt Frank I licks broke
through several players before
being forced to kick by the last
man back.
I he Cards challenged several
more times before the half en
ded. but began to have back line
problems similar to the Wales
team's. A bone-crushing tackle
by lurner deep in Wales territ
ory forced a turnover. Jean-
Cieorge MaLcor almost broke
over for the try but was stopped
only yards from the goal.
As the second half began so
did the rain. The Stanford club
seemed to improve as the
weather (rugby weather equals
rain ) (.lid. while the South Wales
club seemed lackadaisacal in the
second half's early going.
I licks broke a long run for the
Cards and Joe llamby scored a

try shortly after to give the
Cards an K-3 lead. Turner missed
another deep-angled conver
sion, but blasted a penalty kick
later to give the Cards their I 1-3
winning margin.
After the Cards early scoring
the New South Wales club set
tled down, and their scrum
played almost flawlessly, if not
brilliantly, the remainder of the
ga me.
Most of the remainder of the
second half was played at mid
field until the latter stages of the
game. The hitting by both teams
picked up considerably.
If football games are won and
lost in the "pit" then rugby
matches are won and lost in the
scrum. Both teams scrapped
furiously during the second-half

rucks and mauls ;is the game was
mostly contained there with lit
tle wide-open action.
As the hall progressed, prob
lems began to compound for
Wales. Hynn missed two pen
alty kicks and during two of the
many injury time-outs for both
sides, Wales players had to be
removed from the game.
After the jarring tackles given
by the Stanford players, how
ever, Wales seemed to wake up.
Wales threatened several times
late in the game, but Stanford
again stood up to the attack and
did not allow a score.
A fatigued Wales team even
tually let up, and Stanford
moved the ball downfield main
taining it in Wales territory for
the remainder of the game.
