## 
### Dean Eyre Staff Writer 
Stanford's gymnasts will be
staging a doubleheader tonight
and no matter what the team
outcome is, a sure winner will be
Brodie Lockard. Athletic Direc
tor Andy Cieiger announced
Tuesday that proceeds from the
meet will go towards a rehabili
tation fund for Lockard, who
was severely injured Dec. 6
while working out for his third
year with the team.
Sadao Hamada's squad plays
host to Arizona State and
California and Jackie Walker's
team meets the Golden Bears in
a 7:30 p.m. Maples Pavilion
match-up.
Lockard remains in Santa
Clara Valley Medical Center fol
lowing a trampoline accident in
which he fractured two verteb
rae in his upper neck. The junior
from Tucson, Arizona has re
mained paralyzed below the
neck and is expected to remain
at the medical center for several
more months.
In the men's competition, the
Cardinals face an uphill battle as
the Sun Devils are rated fourth
in the country according to the
latest polls. The Bears are cur
rently ranked 14th based on
their team totals to date.
"We'll be tryinu for our high

est team score," said Hamada.
"The guys are all aware of that
and we're hoping to score above
255 points. It we get close to
260, then we'll be close to Cal. I
really expect the best perfor
mance of this year at this meet.'\
The Cards, now 5-7 in overall
competition, will be relying
upon the all-around talents of
David Hyde, Mike Lee, Brian
Nelson and Tad Bostick. In ad
dition to these gymnasts. Stan
ford will enter Bob Daniel and
Bob Maganini in floor exercise
and Rich Rosen and Beta
Matyas on pommel horse.
Rosen and Craig Goldman will
compete in rings and Daniel and
Dan Marguilies are slated for
vaulting. Jell Chung and Rosen
are to perform on parallel bars.
Rosen is also competing on high
bar along with Maganini.
Arizona State brings a 7-2 re
cord to Maples while Cal posts a
2-4 mark.
Ihe undefeated (5-0) Cardi
nal women will be aiming for a
137 point team score. Cal. with
a 7-2 record, has a team average
of 1 24 points and a high score of
126.70. according to Walker.
"Our concern will be more on
individual p e r 112 or m a n ce s
Walker said. "This (the next five
meets) is the relatively easier
part ot our schedule and we

have more leeway to put in a
few new tricks, hut we don't
want to underestimate Cal."
Among the entrants for Stan
ford will be all-arounders Karen
Hall. Anne Smith, Julie Bledsoe
and Jennifer Roberts. Trina
Wiggins will only compete on
uneven parallel bars to give her
ankle more rest. Junior captain
Linda Park, unable to compete
yet in the season because of a
back injury, will be going exhibi
tion in vaulting and balance
beam.
"They're getting in better
shape all the time," Walker said
of her team members, "but no
body has peaked yet. We set a
school record on bars at the
Utah Invitational last weekend,
but we still had mistakes that we
can improve on."
In the Utah meet, Stanford
finished sixth of seven teams, a
very respectable showing con
sidering that all teams are
ranked in the nation's top 20.
The Cards finished third on bars
and fourth on beam, and Walker
hopes that the team can improve
the 134.15 team total by three
points.
Top performers for Cal are
Dori Suggs and Jill Hansen in
all-around competition, and the
team is coached by Dale Flan
saas, a former coach of Stan
ford's Smith.
