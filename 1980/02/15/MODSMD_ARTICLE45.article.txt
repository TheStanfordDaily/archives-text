## 
### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
The men's swim team will
take to the road this weekend to
pit forces against national stron
gholds USC and UCLA. The
Card women will take a shorter
jaunt — just across the Bay to
compete in the Northern
California Championships at
Berkeley.
To round out the traveling
schedule, divers Lisa Mariani.
Ann Southworth and Carol
Noonan will fly to Albuquerque.
New Mexico, Sunday for a
two-day national pre-qualifying
meet.
"We're going to trash the
Trojans." claimed men's assis
tant coach Stu Corliss with a
touch of humor. "USC is the
most successful team in the na
tion," said head coach Skip
Kenney. pointing to veteran
coach Peter Daland's nine
NCAA titles. Yet, "of our three
remaining meets (USC. UCLA
and Cal). 1 think we match up
better with USC than with any
other team. Still, we don't have

the depth to match up with
USC." Kenney said. "We have
to win events, and I think we can
do that."
The team has tapered down
its workouts this entire week to
rest for tonight's meet against
the Trojan tankmen. Four Cards
are planning to shave their
bodies, "more so for qualifying
times than for the meet win."
according to Kenney. "But it we
get the times, we'll win the
meet."
The Trojans nipped the Bears
b\ a single point in dual meet
competition last weekend to
remain undefeated for the sea
son and will face their cross
town rivals, UCLA, next
weekend. "The biggest thing we
have going for us is their meet
next week." Kenney affirmed.
"We hope they're looking for
ward to that and will be down
for us.
"We've been looking good in
workout all week. In the meet
ing yesterday. I said that if we
respect USC and don't fear
them, we'll swim well." he said.

USC barely nicked the Cards
at deGuerre last year and went
on to finish second in the
NCAA championships. This
year, the Trojans are ranked
fifth nationwide with a team lit
tle changed from before.
Southern Cal's national
champion Jeff Float dwells in
the upper U.S. 10 in the 500
freestyle, the 400 indi\idual
medley and the 200 butterfly.
Brian Roney makes another tri
ple top-10 appearance in the
200. 500 and 1650 freestyles.
The Cards' Wade Flemons.
the No. 2 backstroker in
Canada, will smash heads with
Canada's No. 1. Ste\e Pickell of
USC. "I think Wade would like
to change that (ranking)," Ken
ney said.
The Trojans' Jamie Fowler
also poses an awe-inspiring
threat in the backstroke, holding
down top 10 positions in both
the 100 and 200 distances.
Cardinal trontrunner .John
Simons will be sorely pressed in
both his individual medley and
breaststroke events bv Scott

Matsuda and Danny Rosenthal
respectively.
Hopes for an upset do not
spring so frfcely for tomorrow's
match with UCLA. "We just
can't go to USC and lav out all
our emotions and then go in and
swim UCLA the next day."
Kenney explained. He also clas
sified coach Ron Ballatore's
squad as "the best dual meet
team in the nation this year."
Olympic champion Brian
Goodell leads the Bruins' dis
tance pack, along with a host of
other Olympians and national
victors. UCLA is predicted to
nab fourth in the NCAA meet
this year.
Diver Bryan McCleve will
meet Pac-10 champ Kevin Wil
son of USC and equally chal
lenging foes from UCLA. Only
one point shy of the NCAA
qualifying score, McCleve will
be vying to become the first
Stanford diver in 12 years to at
tend the NCAAs.
The women divers will clash
against the "toughest competi
tion on the West Coast," said
diving coach Rick Shavone. Be
cause of overcrowding at the
AIAW championships, this
qualifying meet was initiated for
the first time this year, he
explained. Around 30 divers
from the western third of the
United States will compete for
12 national openings.
The rest of the women's team
should easily dominate the
NorCal meet Saturday and Sun
day. "We should win with no
problem," said women's coach
Claudia Thomas. But. we're still
supposed to be taking it seri
ously," said co-captain Zena
Herrmann.
