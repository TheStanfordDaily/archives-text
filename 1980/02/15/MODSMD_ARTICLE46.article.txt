# Olympic round up
## Heiden and Koch falter 
### Leonard Shapiro The Washington Post 
LAKE PLACID, N Y.
Beth Heiden and Bill Koch, two
of the glamor athletes on the
U.S. Olympic team, lost badly
yesterday in their initial at
tempts to win a medal in the first
full day of competition of the
13th Winter Olympics.
Heiden, the 20-year-old
speed skater from Madison,
Wis., was the first on the track
yesterday and broke the old
Olympic record for the ( 1500
meters. But her time of 2 'mi
nutes 13.10 seconds was bet
tered by six other skaters, in
cluding Holland's Annie
Borckink who grabbed the gold
in 2:10.95.
Koch, the silver medalist in
the 30-kilometer cross-country
race at Innsbruck four years
ago, dropped out of the same
race yesterday after 22 kilomet
ers. The 18.6-mile competition
was won by Nikolaj Zimjatov of
the Soviet Union, a 24-year-old
student at Moscow's Institute of
Physical Culture, in l hour 27
minutes 2.80 seconds.
Americans did have relatively
excellent success at Whitefaee
Mountain, placing three men in
the top 16 of the downhill, in
cluding Pete Patterson of Sun
Valley, Idaho, who was fifth, the
best downhill showing by an
American since 1952.
But the downhill mostly be
longed to a young Austrian up
start, Leonhard Stock, who
came to Whitefaee as an alter
nate on his team. Stock posted
the fastest time during two prac
tice runs last week and won a
gold medal yesterday, his first
ever downhill victory.
His countryman, Peter
Wisrnsberger, won the silver
medal and Steve Podborski of
Canada took the bronze, the
first North America man ever to
win a medal in an Olympic
downhill.
At the speed-skating oval in
downtown Lake Placid. Beth
Heiden was considered a favo
rite in the 1500 meters, even
though she has had an achilles*
problem the last few weeks and
the 3000 is her best event. Yes
terday, however, she had the
misfortune of going first on the
slower fresh ice, and her chances
for a medal quickly disappeared.
She insisted when it was over
that "I expected to be sixth, 1
thought I'd need good luck to be
second or third. There are too
many good skaters. It was the

press that thought I'd win."
U.S. speed-skating coach,
Dianne Holum, said she thought
Beth could have done better.
"Just a couple of weeks ago, she
was just a second off the world
record," she said. "She feels this
pressure a lot more than
(brother) Eric. She's really
never had any before. Last year
(when her brother was world
champion), nothing was ex
pected of her.
"I've seen this happening for
almost a year." said Holum,
speaking to a Dutch reporter
near the grandstand. "She's just
lost a good deal of her confi
dence."
No one thought of Holland's
Borckink, who never had won a
major race, after her fourth
place finish in the world champ
ionships last month. The general
feeling in Holland was that it
shouldn't even send a team after
an embarrassing showing in the
worlds.
Borckink skated in the fifth
pair against Tatiana Barabash ol
the Soviet Union. Her Dutch
teammate, Ria Visser, had the
fastest time of the competition
until Borckink skimmed around
the ice, then waited for 11 more
races before she knew she had
won the gold.
Visser. who said, "it felt very
strange" to watch Borckink's
race, had to settle for the silver
in 2:12.35 and West Germany's
Sabine Becker took the bronze
in 2:12.38. Nineteen of the 30
skaters broke the previous
Olympic record.
At the van Hoevenberg
cross-country course, Zimjatov
led from start to finish over the
three-loop track with light snow
falling throughout the race. His
teammate, Vasili Rochev, was
second and Ivan Lebanov of
Bulgaria took the bronze, the
first medal won by a Bulgarian
since the Games began in 1924.
Zimjatov, 24, finished second
in a pre-Olympic competition
here last year. But this was the
first major international com
petition of the season for the
Soviets, who traditionally skip
international events in Olympic
years. "We skied in Russia," he
said.
Zimjatov said he had the lead
from the beginning. At four
kilometers, he had a nine
second advantage, by five he
had a 15-second lead.
" The pace was so high," he
said, "I didn't know if I could
cope with it." But the conditions

— low clouds, little snow and
low humidity were ideal for the
Soviet, even if they apparently
did not suit Koch.
His teammate, Doug Peter
son. who finished 45th, took a
mild swipe at Koch when the
race was over, saying "You'll
never see me drop out of a race
this year. I've got too much
pride to quit."
Stan Dunkles was the
highest-finishing American in
30th place, followed by James
Galanes in 41st and Peterson in
45th — and this from sup
posedly the best Nordic team
the U.S. ever has fielded.
Still, there was jubilation in
the American camp 10 miles
away at Whitefaee, with Patter
son fifth in the downhill. Phil
Mahre 14th and Andy Mill
16th.
Patterson never had finished
better than 10th in World Cup
downhill competition and had
seriously considered giving up
the event in favor of the slaloms
after he broke his leg in 1978.
"I just felt real good on the
first turn, and 1 thought I had a
pretty good shot at a good time
after I got through the worst
part at the top." he said. "There
were times when 1 really felt
kinda radical at the top, 1 was all
over the place. But that's the
way it is when you go fast."
Stock was the 14th man down
a run that is not considered
among the most dangerous on
the World Cup circuit. He had
the day's fastest intermediate
times and finished in 1:45.50,
with Wirnsberger next at
1:46.12 and Podborski third in
1:46.62.
"I am a big fighter," Stock
said. "I used to fight as a kid. I
had to fight to come back off my
injury, and 1 was able to fight
and win the race. 1 had abso
lutely no problems."
The same could not be said
for one of the favorites in the
race. Canada's Ken Read, who
lost a ski because of a faulty
binding less than 15 seconds
into his run. America's fastest
man in practice, Karl Anderson,
fell at approximately the same
place — in the course's third
turn — and was down and out.
"The first couple of turns
were terrific," Anderson said. "1
really thought I had something
going. But that was all she wrote
for the kid. Another day,
another dollar, only there's no
dollars today."
