WASHINGTON — Despite claims by the
Carter administration that funding tot
energy conservation has increased, the
budget presented to Congress for the year
starting Oct. I shows a slight decrease in the
money allotted to research and develop
ment and a miniscule increase in other
energy conservation programs. When infla
tion is figured in, even that increase disap
pears.
Moreover, although President Jimmy
Carter announced with great fanfare in June
a goal of getting 20 percent of the nation's
power from the sun hy the year 2000, ad
ministration officials admitted that the new
budget proposal fails to even implement a
first step toward that goal.
From the standpoint of congressional cri
tics, the budget proposal casts a new light on
Carter's continued declaration that conser
vation is the key to the nation's energy
crisis. The budget was particularly disap
pointing to several critics in the light of
major studies by prestigious bodies such as

Harvard's Graduate School of Business and
the National Academy ol Science that have
pushed conservation as the fastest, cheapest
and most abundant energy source around.
Rep. Richard Ottinger (D-N.Y.), chair
man ol the House science and technology
subcommittee, said to department officials
grouped in an unhappy row in front of him:
The budget "presents the American people
with a puzzling credibility gap" since "in
real dollars (ii) reflects no increase" over
last year. As for the 20 percent goal for solar
energy, Ottinger labeled that "a sham and
illusion."
In dollars and cents. Carter is proposing
to spend $1.07 billion for conservation in
the next fiscal year, a figure administration
officials trumpeted as "more than SI billion,
for the first time," and a supposed jump ol
$250 million. Hut closer analysis shows that
$150 million of that goes for a program to
help communities pay the social costs of new
synthetic fuel plants in rural areas. Officials
concede that's not conservation money at
Secretary of Energy Charles Duncan riniz

ingly defends the conservation part of the
budget, declaring: "I put my heart and soul
into it. It is a fair marriage of the national
interest concerning conservation and synth
etic fuels."
Privately, some top-level department of
ficials have criticized high visibility prog
rams such as the $100 million invested in
development ol electric and heat engines for
automobiles that they sav are either ready
for commercial development or a waste of
money.
One of the authors ol a highly-praised
energy study published by Harvard, Prof.
Robert Stobaugh. said in a telephone inter
view that it was a mistake for the president
to get behind synthetic fuels programs so
heavily. Rather than $900 million. Stobaugh
thought that $5 billion or $10 billion should
be going for conservation efforts.
Even department officials conceded that
Stobaugh and other critics might have a
point. "We may not have been sufficiently
ambitious." said Thomas Stelson, an assis
