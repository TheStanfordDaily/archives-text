Smiley's People
John le Carre
Alfred A. Knopf
374 pp., $10.95
George Smiley, John le Car
re's spy creation, is a man torn
by imponderables. Smiley can't
quite make sense of the ethically
murky world he inhabits, where
ends continually justify the
means, where ruthlessness. call
ousness and immorality are
sanctioned, better said de
manded. in defense of a nebul
ous greater good.
Yet he tries to give his world
some meaning anyway. And
here, in what should be his
greatest adventure — the final
confrontation with his long-time
opposite number, the Soviet
Centre masterspy Karla
Smiley is forced once again to
face the unavoidable com
promises that a struggling man
of honor in such a profession
faces.
It's not too hard to see why
this man doesn't get that much
satisfaction out of lite. To suc
ceed. Smiley must exploit the
human weaknesses of others
gradually chipping away his own
humanity in the process.
Smiley, obviously (and quite
intentionally). is a world re
moved from the James Bonds
and neo-Bonds who populate
most thriller fiction. Le Carre al

lows his protagonists to have
weaknesses; they they're
hardly indestructible, and they
don't conquer every woman
they meet. 1 or example, in a
rude twist. Smiley's wife is pro
digiously unfaithful; this is illus
trative of le Carre's fundamen
tally different spy world.
following the dumpy. bespec-

tacled Smiley makes tor a more
complex and ultimately much
more satisfying journey than
an. in the other thrillers cur
rently glutting the market. Le
Carre's plotting is a good deal
more competent than that of

most others in the genre, and his
often brilliant prose, with its mix
of gritty realism and deep
seated emotional uncertainty,
belies his "genre" status.
Whether le Carre has •'trans
cended" the spy genre is irrelev
ant. Yet in terms of consistent
quality, le Carre is only matched
by Greene and Coyle, and his
concerns are closer to Conrad's
than to those of most spy
novelists.
In Smiley's People, as in the
earlier The Spy Who Came in
From the Cold. Smiley is called
out of retirement, in this in
stance to help minimize the pub
licity surrounding the murder of
an aged expatriate who also
served as a Circus (le Carre's
"name for British intelligence)
agent.
Quite quickly. Smiley discov
ers a web whose strands lead
him to karla: the expatriate was
shot with a Centre weapon; the
old man's last days were spent
trying to alert Smiley; 111 France,
tan unusually clumsy Karla
-operative is trying to create a
"legend" (a comprehensive
cover story) for an agent Karla
is desperately trying to send into
Switzerland.
The book's plotting is less
dense than that in earlier le
Carre novels; Smiley discovers
Karla's weakness a little too
smoothly. It's clear that le Car

re is anxious to get the two polar
opposites on the stage as early
as possible, and what le Carre's
storytelling lacks in plausibility
he makes up with deftness.
Nostalgia, or more accurately,
a bittersweet remembrance ol
adventures past, begins to over
whelm the book in its later
stages. The pacing slows as
Smiley puts off the final resolu
tion of his conflict with Karla;
more and more lie begins to see
the parallels between himsell
and Ins lifelong enemy.
Smiley is forced to face the
fact that his picture of the inhu
man Karla is an illusion. And
more horribly. Smilev must con

front the fact that to destroy this
man, Ins enemy, he must submit
to the same lack of moderation
and adopt the almost machine
like ruthlessness he has always
condemned in Karla.
While hardly developing sus
pense in the conventional sense,
le Carre, with evident compas
sion, creates a more fundamen
tal tension, centering on the
emotional battle raging inside

Smiley. The distant narrative
tone, though uneven, serves
largely to eliminate any feelings
of pity the reader might have.
Win or lose, this last show
down with Karla is also Smiley's
last compromise with himself.
Regardless of the outcome,
:Smiley has given in to Karla
even if he wins this battle, he's
lost the emotional war.
You arrive at the end of

Smiley's People lull of trepida
tion and mixed feelings. You
almost don't want to know what
happens to Smiley, hut you fi
nally just care too damn much
about him to abandon him. And
if this is in fact the last we'll see
ol Smiley (as le Carre has hinted
it may be) Smiley's People once
again makes it clear why we
don't want to let him go.
