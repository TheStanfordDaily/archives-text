High Culture
William Novak
Alfred A. Knopf. Inc.
289 pp., $6.95
The mythical Manhattan Sil
vertip is rumored to have origi
nated from the sewers of Alew
York; Blue Sky Blond sounds
like someone you 'd like to meet;
and /.acatecas Purple is a rare
find indeed.
The latest carcinogenic sub
stances? No, although there are a
surprising number of people in
this country who might think so.
Actually, they're just three of the
more intriguing varieties of
marijuana, aka ganja, weed,
reefer, pot, grass, tea, ad
nauseam . . .
Since pot has been smoked by
something like 50 million
Americans, accounting tor an
estimated $10 billion in sales
per year, that makes quite a
market tor books on the e\ i 1
weed. Many are just cult items,
recounting "Fear and Loathing"
— type adventures. A lew, how
ever. earn the respect of a wide
spread audience.
Perhaps the best-known pub
lication among marijuana uses is
A Child's Garden of Grass, writ
ten over a decade ago by de
voted smokers Jack Margolis
and Richard Clorfene.
Marihuana Reconsidered, a
rigorous scientific examination
of the drug by Lester Grins
poon. is credited in part with
laying aside the fears of many

non-smokers and parents ol
smokers.
Hut while the former is a clas
sic treatment of the "60s
marijuana culture and the latter
is a thorough and comprehen
sive examination of marijuana
research, neither could be called
the proverbial "definitive work"
on the subject. ,
Well, with the recent release
of High Culture - Marijuana in
the Lives of Americans, that
niche has finally been filled.
All-encompas.sing
William Novak, the author of
this landmark book, has success
fully achieved what no other
marijuana chronicler has previ
ously even attempted: an all
enconipassing testimony to the
most popular illegal substance in
the nation.
What is most laudible about
High Culture is the book's ap
proach to the subject. The
majority of the text is based
upon responses to questionaires
and interviews with several
hundred smokers Novak dili
gently sought, analyzed and fol
lowed up. With a considerable
amount of prior reading and dis
cussion with experts under his
belt. Novak has examined
marijuana from almost every
conceivable angle, illustrating
his statements with extensive
testimony from smokers all over
the country.
The result is a captivatingly
written, objectively informative

work which should be read by
both smoker and non-smoker
alike.
l or those who have not (or
have only rarely) tried this enig
matic drug, the book will serve,
to clear up misconceptions, dis
pel false rumors and generally
present an accurate view of the
range of attitudes extant among
smokers on the subject of
marijuana. And a wide range it
is. too. The underlying message
of the book is clear: Pot affects
the lives of Americans in many
different ways, depending upon
a multitude ot personal and
situational factors, and there is
no way for the curious non
smoker (pot virgin?) to tell be
forehand exactly how he or she
will react to the drug.
In particular. High Culture
demystifies the "marijuana cul
ture," clearly explaining why
and how smokers occasionally
look at the world a little diffe
rently from their non-smoking
fellow humans.
l or those who already have
gained the appreciation from
personal experience (I know
you're out there!), this book is
very reassuring, as well as in
formative.
Smokers of all degrees of ex
perience will undoubtedly rec
ognize and identify with many of
the experiences and feelings re
ported by Novak and fellow
smokers in the book.
In addition, the book is a
wealth of information for those
who are interested in a little his
tory of the pot experience.
"Looking Back: When the
Grass Was Greener" is a par
ticularly illuminating chapter for
those who began smoking in the
mid- and late '70s, presenting a
vivid picture of the substantial
differences between the at
titudes of'6os smokers and '70s
smokers.
For the '60s smoker:
"Dope expressed us, and we
all knew it without anyone's

having to say so. It made us
know we were outlaws in the '•
eyes of America, which was
quite a shock for us middle
class kids. And they wanted
to put us in jail just for
smoking it."
In contrast, smoking in the
'70s and '80s is characterized by
a much more healthy environ
ment. free from the"the old at
titudes of tear and paranoia."'.
"Dope has become the
psychedelic movement made
safe for mass consumption," of
fers one smoker, "like rock con
certs on TV, underground KM
cleaned up for AM listeners, or
condominiums replacing com
munes. Vanguards are always
more real than what follows in
their wake."
Marijuana future
Perhaps the final chapter,
"Looking Ahead: Smokers
Speculate on the Future," is the
most valuable of all. It takes lit
tle foresight to see that legaliza
tion of marijuana is an issue of
Vwhen," not "if." One analogy
used in the book sees pot taking
a role in our society like that of
wine, complete with cheap,
low-potency commercial
brands, as well as rarer, more
potent "connoisseur" varieties.
There are others, particularly
many '60s smokers, who are op
posed to the seemingly impend
ing commercialization of the
drug that "was the glue that held
the counterculture together,"
and their reasons for keeping
marijuana business the way it is
now are compelling.
Whatever the future of
marijuana, however, the time to
begin thinking about it is now.
With a vote due on the Califor-j
nia Marijuana Initiative in
November, High Culture can go
a a long way in educating the
public and helping each indi
vidual — smoker or non-smoker
— clarify his or her own views
on this controversial drug.

Hut while the former is a clas

All-encompas.sing
William Novak, the author of
this landmark book, has success
fully achieved what no other
marijuana chronicler has previ
ously even attempted: an all
enconipassing testimony to the
most popular illegal substance in
the nation.
What is most laudible about
High Culture is the book's ap
proach to the subject. The
majority of the text is based
upon responses to questionaires
and interviews with several
hundred smokers Novak dili
gently sought, analyzed and fol
lowed up. With a considerable
amount of prior reading and dis
cussion with experts under his
belt. Novak has examined
marijuana from almost every
conceivable angle, illustrating
his statements with extensive
testimony from smokers all over
the country.
The result is a captivatingly
written, objectively informative

work which should be read by
both smoker and non-smoker
alike.
l or those who have not (or
have only rarely) tried this enig
matic drug, the book will serve,
to clear up misconceptions, dis
pel false rumors and generally
present an accurate view of the
range of attitudes extant among
smokers on the subject of
marijuana. And a wide range it
is. too. The underlying message
of the book is clear: Pot affects
the lives of Americans in many
different ways, depending upon
a multitude ot personal and
situational factors, and there is
no way for the curious non
smoker (pot virgin?) to tell be
forehand exactly how he or she
will react to the drug.
In particular. High Culture
demystifies the "marijuana cul
ture," clearly explaining why
and how smokers occasionally
look at the world a little diffe
rently from their non-smoking
fellow humans.
l or those who already have
gained the appreciation from
personal experience (I know
you're out there!), this book is
very reassuring, as well as in
formative.
Smokers of all degrees of ex
perience will undoubtedly rec
ognize and identify with many of
the experiences and feelings re
ported by Novak and fellow
smokers in the book.
In addition, the book is a
wealth of information for those
who are interested in a little his
tory of the pot experience.
"Looking Back: When the
Grass Was Greener" is a par
ticularly illuminating chapter for
those who began smoking in the
mid- and late '70s, presenting a
vivid picture of the substantial
differences between the at
titudes of'6os smokers and '70s
smokers.
For the '60s smoker:
"Dope expressed us, and we
all knew it without anyone's

having to say so. It made us
know we were outlaws in the '•
eyes of America, which was
quite a shock for us middle
class kids. And they wanted
to put us in jail just for
smoking it."
In contrast, smoking in the
'70s and '80s is characterized by
a much more healthy environ
ment. free from the"the old at
titudes of tear and paranoia."'.
"Dope has become the
psychedelic movement made
safe for mass consumption," of
fers one smoker, "like rock con
certs on TV, underground KM
cleaned up for AM listeners, or
condominiums replacing com
munes. Vanguards are always
more real than what follows in
their wake."
Marijuana future
Perhaps the final chapter,
"Looking Ahead: Smokers
Speculate on the Future," is the
most valuable of all. It takes lit
tle foresight to see that legaliza
tion of marijuana is an issue of
Vwhen," not "if." One analogy
used in the book sees pot taking
a role in our society like that of
wine, complete with cheap,
low-potency commercial
brands, as well as rarer, more
potent "connoisseur" varieties.
There are others, particularly
many '60s smokers, who are op
posed to the seemingly impend
ing commercialization of the
drug that "was the glue that held
the counterculture together,"
and their reasons for keeping
marijuana business the way it is
now are compelling.
Whatever the future of
marijuana, however, the time to
begin thinking about it is now.
With a vote due on the Califor-j

November, High Culture can go
a a long way in educating the
public and helping each indi
vidual — smoker or non-smoker
— clarify his or her own views
on this controversial drug.
