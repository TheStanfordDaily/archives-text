Red River M * * *
Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
Montgomery Gift's aggressively
sexual performance dominates this
Howard Hawks Western. Hawks
gives the great cattle drive an ex
citing energy and vitality, and the
conflict between John Wayne as
the father and Gift as the stepson
makes for a fine primordial con
flict and climax. Co-starring Wal
ter Brennan, Harry Carey, John
Ireland and Joanne Dru.

Interiors * * *
Sunday-Monday, New Varsity
Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a neces
sary one. Here, Allen begins to
deal with the problems he so com
pletely solves in his last movie, the
brilliant Manhattan. This schema
tic. tragic story of a family in crisis
is intentionally sterile. Woody
forces himself to repress his comic
side; what remains is painful, un
even — yet often, somehow, bril
liant.
Woody's errors here are those
of a man who's more than a little
unsure of himself; he overplays
obvious symbolism, and his at
tempts at Bergmanesque touches
are, more often than not, flaccid
imitations. Yet Allen coaxes great
performances from a superb en
semble cast, and Maureen Staple
ton literally stands out as the only
person to bring color and vibrancy
to the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.
—R.L.
American Gigolo *
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have
much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience feel more like
peeping toms than vital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush of images,
Schrader lets Gere oft the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Hutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.
— R.L.
The Boys From Brazil ♦ *
Thursday, Bishop, 7:30 p.m.
While I suppose it's quite possi
ble to respect this movie's profes
sionalism, it's a very difficult film

to like. Boys gets it done, but in a
very cold way. The movie keeps its
distance, and that's the worst
dampener.
However, Gregory Peck and
Laurence Olivier, the two stars,
give engaging performances.
Olivier's nicely balanced perfor
mance as a Nazi-hunter is espe
cially good. Yet even though the
movie's about an attempted plan
to resuscitate the Third Reich, the
movie's so damn neutral and
sterile that it begins to unnerve
you. Directed by Franklin Schaff
ner. Co-starring James Mason.
— R.L.
The Ruling Class q. +
Friday, Kresge
Peter O'Toole rants and raves
almost non-stop in a rather impos
sible movie about a crazed man
who goes from believing he's Jesus
to feeling he's Jack the Ripper.
O'Toole's performance is wildly
uneven, but there are enough in
spired moments to keep you in
terested.
— R.L.
Coming Home * * * *
Sunday, Mem And 7 & 9:30 p.m.
Set in 1968. Coming Home is a
drama about people at home deal
ing with the Vietnam War. The
Bruce Dern character is crudely
drawn, and the movie occasionally
suffers from poor transitions, but it
more than makes up for these de
ficiencies with its understanding of
the look and feel of the time. Your
doubts are ultimately replaced by
joy. Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
give excellent, compelling perfor
mances, and Hal Ashby's direction
is excellent throughout. Fonda and
Voight received Oscars for their
efforts.
—Jim Mattson
10 * * *
Aquarius, Palo Alto
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on. 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for
lack of a better word, straight, and
this comedy about male mid-lile
crisis probably won't please those
who enjoy watching females get
conquered. As an over-40
songwriter, Dudley Moore is an
ingratiating humbler, and Edwards
gives the rest of the cast more than
enough depth to get by. Except for
Bo Derek, that is. This Playhoy
attraction just may have found her
"niche" as the vacuous "10" the
title refers to.
—R.L.
Open City ♦ ★ ★ *
Monday, Cuhberley
Director Roberto Rossellini and
his crew of Italian patriots made

this near-documentary of occupied
Italy while the Germans were still
entrenched on Italian soil. Rossel
lini handles his potentially melod
ramatic subject matter so well that
it becomes extremely moving. This
was Anna Magnani's first major
role; Sergei Amidei and Federico
Fellini wrote the script.
-J.M.
Kramer vs. Kramer y h
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as-

tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a

little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.L.

Harold and Maude * * *
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies arc attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in tree
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals are played by Bud Cort
and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens round out the soundtrack.
— J M.
The Black Hole *
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion picture
space race with a brilliant plunge

into the world of outer space spe
cial effects, and falls flat on its face.
The effects are fun in the begin
ning, but the wires soon become
obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a
cross between Star Wars' R2-D2
and a beer keg. The movie plays
like Captain Nemo in space, and
t!je religious overtones probably
have Dante spinning in his grave.
— Simon Labov

Star Trek # *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A mechan
ical creation of man comes back to
haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
of the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilization by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex — is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner,
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest of the movie is
like a greatest hits of Douglas
Trumbull and John Dykstra's pre

vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.
— R.L.
The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
of .4 Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to 'Ay, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.
— R.L.
1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion'for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler. 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most crit.cs to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may be
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that. I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Avkroyd. Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— .R.L.
Apocalypse Sow * ★ * *
Century 24, San Jose
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gency in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; heemploys Conrad's es
scntial narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images of
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horriblv fasci-

Electric Horseman ** W
Menlo Cinema, Mcnlo Park
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo sta r Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol —a$ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially,
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

just isn't the movie that will make

Palo Alio Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns, Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
you to be effective.

The Boys From Brazil ♦ *
Thursday, Bishop, 7:30 p.m.
While I suppose it's quite possi
ble to respect this movie's profes
sionalism, it's a very difficult film

to like. Boys gets it done, but in a
very cold way. The movie keeps its
distance, and that's the worst
dampener.
However, Gregory Peck and
Laurence Olivier, the two stars,
give engaging performances.
Olivier's nicely balanced perfor
mance as a Nazi-hunter is espe
cially good. Yet even though the
movie's about an attempted plan
to resuscitate the Third Reich, the
movie's so damn neutral and
sterile that it begins to unnerve

Set in 1968. Coming Home is a

drawn, and the movie occasionally
suffers from poor transitions, but it
more than makes up for these de
ficiencies with its understanding of
the look and feel of the time. Your

joy. Jane Fonda and Jon Voight
give excellent, compelling perfor

Blake Edwards' values are, for
lack of a better word, straight, and
this comedy about male mid-lile

who enjoy watching females get
conquered. As an over-40
songwriter, Dudley Moore is an
ingratiating humbler, and Edwards
gives the rest of the cast more than
enough depth to get by. Except for
Bo Derek, that is. This Playhoy

Monday, Cuhberley
Director Roberto Rossellini and

this near-documentary of occupied

entrenched on Italian soil. Rossel

Kramer vs. Kramer y h
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as-

tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a

little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
of .4 Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to 'Ay, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob

in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For

1941 * * *

Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directing perfor

suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler. 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most crit.cs to this

horribly out of place now.
Despite all that. I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian

Not a great movie, but for

suffers from poor transitions, but it
more than makes up for these de

The sexist ad campaign has mis

you're looking for a semi

Blake Edwards' values are, for
lack of a better word, straight, and
this comedy about male mid-lile
crisis probably won't please those
who enjoy watching females get
conquered. As an over-40
songwriter, Dudley Moore is an
ingratiating humbler, and Edwards
gives the rest of the cast more than
enough depth to get by. Except for
Bo Derek, that is. This Playhoy
attraction just may have found her
"niche" as the vacuous "10" the

Director Roberto Rossellini and
his crew of Italian patriots made

this near-documentary of occupied
Italy while the Germans were still
entrenched on Italian soil. Rossel

Kramer vs. Kramer y h
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as-

tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a

little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Harold and Maude * * *

Harold is a young man whose
hobbies arc attending funerals and

old woman who believes in tree
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be

fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two

The Black Hole *
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion picture
space race with a brilliant plunge

into the world of outer space spe

The effects are fun in the begin

obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a
cross between Star Wars' R2-D2

like Captain Nemo in space, and
t!je religious overtones probably

Empty apocalyptic rumblings

the seeming epic grandeur of its

tentionally hilarious. Shatner,

Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
of .4 Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to 'Ay, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob

in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For

off much better, but it's too little

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler. 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most crit.cs to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may be
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that. I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be

Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar

Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a neces
sary one. Here, Allen begins to
deal with the problems he so com
pletely solves in his last movie, the
brilliant Manhattan. This schema
tic. tragic story of a family in crisis
is intentionally sterile. Woody
forces himself to repress his comic
side; what remains is painful, un
even — yet often, somehow, bril
liant.
Woody's errors here are those
of a man who's more than a little
unsure of himself; he overplays
obvious symbolism, and his at
tempts at Bergmanesque touches
are, more often than not, flaccid
imitations. Yet Allen coaxes great
performances from a superb en

person to bring color and vibrancy

American Gigolo *
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life

director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have
much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience feel more like
peeping toms than vital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush of images,
Schrader lets Gere oft the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Hutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.

tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a

little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Harold and Maude * * *

Harold is a young man whose
hobbies arc attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in tree
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,

vigorating cult comedy. The two

The Black Hole *
Guild Theater, Menlo Park
Disney enters the motion picture
space race with a brilliant plunge

into the world of outer space spe
cial effects, and falls flat on its face.
The effects are fun in the begin

obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a
cross between Star Wars' R2-D2
and a beer keg. The movie plays
like Captain Nemo in space, and
t!je religious overtones probably
have Dante spinning in his grave.

Empty apocalyptic rumblings

the seeming epic grandeur of its

of the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilization by gleefully agre

tentionally hilarious. Shatner,

they're almost unbelievably

The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
of .4 Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to 'Ay, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres

still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler. 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most crit.cs to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may be
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that. I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Avkroyd. Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis

goes on outside the theater.

Sunday-Monday, New Varsity
Not a great movie, but for
Woody Allen, probably a neces
sary one. Here, Allen begins to
deal with the problems he so com
pletely solves in his last movie, the
brilliant Manhattan. This schema
tic. tragic story of a family in crisis
is intentionally sterile. Woody
forces himself to repress his comic
side; what remains is painful, un
even — yet often, somehow, bril
liant.
Woody's errors here are those
of a man who's more than a little
unsure of himself; he overplays
obvious symbolism, and his at
tempts at Bergmanesque touches
are, more often than not, flaccid
imitations. Yet Allen coaxes great
performances from a superb en
semble cast, and Maureen Staple

person to bring color and vibrancy
to the otherwise pale and lifeless
family in the film.

American Gigolo *
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have
much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience feel more like
peeping toms than vital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush of images,
Schrader lets Gere oft the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Hutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.

cial effects, and falls flat on its face.
The effects are fun in the begin
ning, but the wires soon become
obnoxiously visible and people
start breathing in space. The best
acting is done by a tin can named
V.I.N.C.E.N.T. that looks like a
cross between Star Wars' R2-D2
and a beer keg. The movie plays
like Captain Nemo in space, and
t!je religious overtones probably
have Dante spinning in his grave.

Star Trek # *
Palo Alto Square
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A mechan
ical creation of man comes back to
haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
of the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilization by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex — is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner,
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest of the movie is
like a greatest hits of Douglas
Trumbull and John Dykstra's pre

vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.

The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
of .4 Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to 'Ay, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion'for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler. 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most crit.cs to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may be
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that. I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Avkroyd. Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.

Apocalypse Sow * ★ * *
Century 24, San Jose
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gency in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; heemploys Conrad's es
scntial narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images of
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horriblv fasci-

nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this "impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.

Electric Horseman ** W
Menlo Cinema, Mcnlo Park
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo sta r Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol —a$ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially,
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

The Jerk * *
Old Mill
I love Steve Martin, but this is
more an attempt to cash in on his
present status than an effort to face
tougher creative challenges.
Steve's born a "poor black child."
and several of the skits in this rags
to riches to rags story revel so
wildly in their dumbness that they
simpl\ must be inspired, but this
just isn't the movie that will make
Martin a memorable movie come
dian. He's got the unique moves
and he perhaps has got the mind,
but he doesn't yet have the material
— The Jerk's more a stringing to
gether of sketches than a movie.
Mavbe next time, okav?

Going in Style **■ *
Palo Alio Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns, Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
you to be effective.

Father John Wayne and rebellious stepson Montgomery Clift fight it out in the
climactic sequence in Howard Hawks' Red River.
