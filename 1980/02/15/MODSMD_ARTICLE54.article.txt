Soviets step up Afghan invasion
KABUL. Afghanistan — More Soviet troops and
equipment were reported pouring into Afghanistan
amid increasing evidence of stiffening rebel resis
tance and problems within the Moscow-installed re
gime of Babrak Karmal.
Witnesses, meanwhile, reported that Soviet troops,
tanks and two MiG-23 tighter bombers crushed an
apparent rebellion last Monday at an Afghan army
garrison at Cargha, 12 miles north of the capital.
In Geneva, the United Nations Human Rights
Commission yesterday adopted a resolution by a vote
of 27 to S. with six abstentions, condemning the
Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and demanding
the troops' immediate and unconditional withdrawal.
But the Politburo of the Afghanistan People's
Democratic Party has not met for two weeks now,
and Karmal. who took power in the Dec. 27 coup, has
almost disappeared from public view.
The lack of political activity has triggered rumors
of infighting within the regime, and there have also
been reports that Soviet officials are unhappy with
Karmal and looking to replace him.
Afghan rebels get U.S. weapons
WASHINGTON —The United States is supplying
weapons to rebel forces battling Soviet troops in Af
ghanistan. according to reliable sources.
The weapons, presumably being slipped across
Pakistan's rugged 1400-mile border with Afghanis
tan. are said to be mostly small arms and relatively
simple anti-tank weapons that give a soldier the
capability to knock out an armored vehicle.
The smuggled arms are said to be Soviet-built,
which helps disguise the source of supply.
The covert U.S. weapons supply, which sources say
began after the Soviets invaded Afghanistan on Dec.
24. is said to be "neither big or dramatic."
Though it is not known precisely how the supply is
being carried out. the operator presumably is the
Central Intelligence Agency. Key committees of
Congress responsible for overseeing covert activities
have been kept informed of the administration ac
tions by the State Department and the CIA.
The U.S. press also has reported that China is
supplying arms aid to the rebels.
Kennedy attacks Carter speech
EXETER. N.H. — Sen. Edward Kennedy yester
day accused President Jimmy Carter of misusing the
office ot the presidency, and said he was formally
asking for equal network television time to reply to
Carter's criticism during his press conference Wed
nesday.
Kennedy told an audience crowded into a high
school gymnasium here that Carter had falsely ac
cused him of blaming the United States rather than
the Iranian terrorists for the seizure of the American
hostages in Tehran.
Referring to Carter's nationally televised press
conference, his tirst in 21: months. Kennedy said the
president had used his office "to launch a personal
attack that was factually inaccurate . . . without pre
cedent in the history of presidential news confer
ences."
The bigger dispute between Kennedy , one of Car
ter's challengers for the Democratic presidential
nomination, and the president erupted after Kennedy
delivered a stinging new attack on Carter's handling
ot U.S. foreign policy at Harvard on Tuesday.
In that speech, Kennedy said the administration
had reversed its position on a proposed U.N. commis
sion to investigate Iranian grievances against the
former shah, supporting such a commission only after
Kennedy and others had publicly called for it.
In his Wednesday press conference. Carter said
Kennedy's allegations had been untrue and that
Kennedy had not helped his country with his cam
paign rhetoric.

lOC criticized for China vote
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — In a rare display of dis
harmony within the International Olympic Commit
tee. both lOC President Lord killanin and executive
director Monique Berlioux have been accused of re
sorting to questionable tactics on the exclusion of
Taiwanese athletes and the admission of a team from
the People's Republic of China.
According to Lance Cross of New Zealand, a
member of the lOC executive board who has
emerged as something of a dissenter against the lead
ership of Killanin and Berlioux, there were two ways
m which Killanin and Berlioux succeeded in getting a
majority of members to reverse themselves last year
on the China issue.
112 irst, in a covering letter, Killanin informed the
membership that the lOC executive board, meeting
in October in Nagoya, Japan, had been unanimous in
recommending the new approach.
This, Cross said, was not true.
Second. Berlioux, in sending out the postal ballot,
included with it a U.S. State Department letter that
strongly implied that the U.S. government favored
the admission of China and the exclusion of Taiwan
from the Olympics.
Cross said that he believed that sending the ballot
along with one-sided supporting documents to be a
"perversion" of a democratic vote. The lOC general
membership was unduly influenced, he charged.
Leftists mount agitation in Turkey
ANKARA, Turkey — Mounting leftist agitation
engulfed Turkey yesterday bringing life to a virtual
standstill in Istanbul and the Aegean coastal city of
Izmir. At least two new deaths were reported.
Most shops and businesses in Istanbul, the nation's
largest city, closed following bomb threats from leftist
militants. One terrorist trying to intimidate shopow
ners was killed in a shootout with police, authorities
said.
Meanwhile, the mastermind of a leftist terrorist cell
.allegedly has admitted responsibility for the Dec. 15
ambushslayings of four Americans —one soldier and
three Boeing Co. engineers — who worked at
NATO's Cakmakli munitions depot near Istanbul.
Marxist groups have struck U.S. targets at least 30
times in their efforts to hamper operations of the
5000 American military personnel at two dozen
U.S.-run bases and NATO facilities in Turkey.
Japan resists auto plants in U.S.
TOKYO — Douglas Fraser, president of the Un
ited Auto Workers, said Wednesday he is not having
much luck selling Japanese automakers on the idea of
building plants in the United States.
After two days of talks here, the American union
leader said his hopes of moving this country's big
companies toward a decision on building plants are
not being fulfilled.
Nissan Motor Co.. the No. 2 auto giant here, talked
only about possibly building trucks in the United
States and then offered several reasons against build
ing passenger cars there, Fraser said.
Both Nissan and Toyota are known to be skeptical
of the plan to build U.S. plants, but they are under
pressure to do so because of fears Congress may
impose protectionist measures this year.
Chicago firefighters go on strike
CHICAGO — Firemen and paramedics walked off
their jobs at 120 firehouses yesterday and defied a
court order that they return to work, leaving the
nation's second most populous city with minimal fire
protection and emergency services.
Only about half of the city's fire-fighting equip
ment was manned and much of that by skeleton crews
of supervisory personnel and lire cadets who have yet
to complete training. But both Mayor Jane Bryne and
the city's fire commissioner said all parts of the city of
nearly 3 million people were protected.

City and lire officials were reticent about how
many firefighters were actually available, should
Chicago be confronted with a major blaze or a rash of
small fires, 112 irefighter Union officials contended that
there were only 354 men on duty, about a third of the
normal daily contingent.
The strike, the first since the fire department was
organized in 1N64. stems from a long-standing dis
pute between the union representing Chicago's 4000
firefighters and 300 paramedics and Mayor Byrne,
who promised them their first formal labor contract
during her successful campaign last year.
FBI indicts porno conspirators
WASHINGTON — An FBI undercover operation
based in Miami has cracked a nationwide conspiracy
tocontrol the multibillion-dollar pornography indus
try, federal officials said yesterday.
A federal grand jury in Miami returned indict
ments against 45 persons from 10 states, following a
2'/2-year investigation in which FBI agents opened a
phony mail order house in Miami to make contact
with the pornographers.
Among those charged with conspiracy and in
terstate transportation of obscene material yesterday
were four men reputed to be the country's major
traffickers in dirty books and movies. They are Rubin
Sturman of Cleveland, Michael "Mickey" Zaffararno
and Robert "Debe" Dißernardo. both known as or
ganzetf crime figures from New York, and Harry
Mohney of Durand, Mich.
Zaffarano died of an apparent heart attack yester
day in New York just as FBI agents were trying to
serve him with a warrant, officials said.
The investigation resulted in additional indict
ments against 13 persons on film-pi rating charges.
The pornography indictments were described by
federal law enforcement officials as the largest single
attack yet on the pornography industry.
A lawyer familiar with the case said: "We didn't go
out trying to enforce morality. We were looking for
industries controlled by elements of organized crime,
and felt pornography was one of them."
