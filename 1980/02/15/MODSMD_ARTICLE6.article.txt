### 
From the Daily wire services
The U.S. hostages in Tehran could
he treed in 48 hours once the United
States accepts Iran's conditions, Ira
nian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
said yesterday in an interview with Ita
lian state television.
This came as a spokesman in New
York for U.N. Secretary General Kurt
Waldheim said that the announcement
of the composition of a United Na
tions investigating commission on the
role of the United States in Iran meet
ing one of Tehran's conditions could
come very soon.
"We have reached a very sensitive
and very delicate stage of negotia
tion," said U.N. spokesman Rudolf
Stajuhar.
British government sources used
almost identical language, adding that
there is much sensitive material that
could not he told to correspondents.
Bani-Sadr did not clearly spell out
what Iran's current conditions are.
They have been gradually changing
since the initial demands that Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi he extra
dited to Iran for trial and his fortune
he turned over to the Iranian govern
ment.
Sean Macßride, former foreign
minister of Ireland who has heen ac

tively involved in the crisis since the
hostages were seized Nov. 4, said the
inquiry would "investigate the extent
to which the regime of the shah may
have committed offenses under inter
national law."
Hostages not forgotten
But in a speech in Cairo, U.N. Am
bassador Donald McHenry said: "We
have not gotten a resolution to the
hostages question. '
McHenry, on a two-week, seven
nation Mideast tour, added it was
"clear to me" a solution will come
"within the framework of the United
Nations and using U.N. machinery."
In Washington, the Carter administ
ration called on Iranian officials to
clarify their demands. "We are going
to have to see some more definition"
of what the Iranians want in exchange
for freeing the hostages, said Nodding
Carter, the State Department spokes
man.
Dismissing speculation of their im
minent release, a senior State De
partment official said: "You would die
several times over if you held your
breath" for it.
And from White House spokesman
Jody Powell: "Everybody is consider
ably ahead of the process."
Broad hints •
The Iranian president made no
mention of the shah and his money
yesterday but he hinted broadly that
U.S. humanitarian aid and a resump
tion of the delivery of spare parts for
Iran's large U.S.-built arsenal would
he welcome sweeteners tor the deal
and that Iran would be willing to pay
for them with the dividendof a friendly
foreign policy.
After Iran's conditions have been
met by Washington, Bani-Sadr said,
the release of the hostages, "could he
a question of 48 hours."
The process of untangling the com
plicated 14-week crisis would begin
with the formation of a fact-finding
commission, the U.N. sources said.
Amid reports that the names of

commission members might he un
veiled as early as today, a U.N.
spokesman said yesterday that the
panel's composition would he an
nounced "soon."
Third party?
Exact timing and mechanics of a re
lease are yet to he determined, sources
said, hut one plan would have the hos
tages stay in Tehran under the super
vision of a third party while the com
mission is gathering facts there. Some
of the Americans could he called as
witnesses in the proceedings, sources
added.
Elsewhere, Iranian security forces
have executed some 10 people in their
attempt to restore order in Gonhade
Kavus after a week of clashes with
Marxist militants and ethnic Turko
mans. reliable sources said yesterday.
Tension was still reported high in
this town, about 220 miles northeast
of Tehran, where about 30 people re
portedly have died in the fighting.
But Iranian army troops and re
volutionary guardsmen appeared to
have taken the initiative in their strug
gle with the Turkomans and members
of the Marxist-Leninist group
"Fedayeen e Kalq."
Executions
Sources said they have executed
about 10 people in the last two days.
According to se\eral town residents,
several houses suspected of sheltering
"rebels" were destroyed.
The violence started last Friday
when Fedayeen members were at
tacked by religious extremists while
the Marxists were demonstrating to
celebrate the anniversary of their fight
to depose the shah, according to
eyewitnesses.
However, a Fedayeen leader said
tension in the region had deeper roots.
" The great feudal lords (the shah's
generals and other officials of the
former regime) took over 80 percent
of the land of the region," he said.
"After the revolution, the Turkomans
occupied the land and cultivated it."
