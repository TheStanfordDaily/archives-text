# University to renovate elevators
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
If you think the elevator business
has its ups and downs, it's time to
think again.
For when bidding is completed
for an elevator renovation project
here sometime in mid-March, the
winning contractor will control a
budget of $1.2 million. The budget
was approved by the University
board of trustees on Feb. 12.
Plans call for the modification of
88 passenger elevators in main
campus facilities, Escondido Vil
lage and the Medical Center. The
work, which will include fire and
earthquake safety provisions, mod
ifications for the physically hand
icapped and photoelectric door
controls, is needed "to comply with
existing or impending governmen
tal regulations," according to a
background report submitted to the
board.
California fire safety regulations,
in effect since 1978, require smoke
detection systems, main lobby con
trols, and in-car »'ntrols for fire
personnel use in 33 of the
elevators.
All 88 elevators require modifi
cations by 1982 to comply with ear
thquake safety provisions.
Requirements
Accessibility rules for the physi
cally limited, expected to be man
dated by the state in mid-1980, in
clude relocation of the cab controls,
addition of handrails, visual and
Braille symbol changes, and visual
and audible signals of the elevator's
travel status for 33 or the elevators,
the report said.
Tony Bowles, assistant director
of facilities and services' engineer
ing department, said, "We are not
seeking to improve elevators, sim
ply to comply with the state stan
dards."
Why is the work so expensive?
'Heck of a lot'
Bowles said that each elevators'
modifications will cost approxi
mately $15,000. "In project terms,
it's not frantically expensive," he
said. The thing is that we are just
talking about a heck of a lot of
elevators."
However, Bowles also noted that
"some people would venture that
the proposal is going overboard.
The question of how safe is safe is a
relative one," he said. Bowles also
said that trying to decide to what
extent provisions should be made
for the physically limited is also

"subjective."
Jason Mavis, director of facilities
and services said that the concern
over earthquake standards stems
from the earthquake which occur
red in Southern California a few
years ago. Codes changed, after it
was discovered "what could be ex
pected to happen to elevators dur
ing an earthquake," Mavis said.
Those dangers are that the
elevator could come off its tracks,
jam or fall, he said.
Most of the elevator modifica
tions related to earthquake safety

involve adapting the counter
weight, which goes up when the
elevator goes down, and vice versa,
Bowles explained. "If it sprang
loose in an earthquake it could
bash the cab," he said.
Both Bowles and Mavis said
there were no reports of damage or
malfunctions in any of the Univer
sity's elevators during the ear
thquakes which shook the campus
late last month.
Bowles said that it was difficult
to determine what sort of modifica

This Green Library elevator, one of the oldest on campus, will
undergo "seismic modifications" as part of a $1.2 million project
seeking to make elevators here comply with state fire and ear
thquake codes, and to provide better access and control for hand
icapped persons.
tions would actually prevent prob
lems with the elevators during an
earthquake. The codes "just reflect
the evolution of society to risk-free
living," he said. It's not a DC-10
crash program. The state simply
tells us what to do so we do it,"
Bowles said.
One person whose living may at
least he aided by the modifications
is Stanford student Chris Tramblay.
Tramblay, a handicapped person
confined to a wheelchair, said he

especially appreciated the photo
electric eye controls which will
keep the doors from closing on
handicapped persons who move re
latively slowly.
"But people are very good now
about holding the doors open for
me," he added.
All elevator corrections which
might reasonably be required are
being done simultaneously, with
construction expected to be com
pleted by the end of the calendar
year.
