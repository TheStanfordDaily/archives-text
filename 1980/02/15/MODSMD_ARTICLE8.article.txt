WASHINGTON — A U.S.
Marine amphibious force will be
sent into the area of the Indian
Ocean and Arabian Sea next
month as part of the Carter ad
ministration's plan to deter an\
Soviet move into the Persian
Gulf region, administration offi
cials said Tuesday night.
The officials said four ships —
the USS Okinawa. USS Mobile.
USS Alamo and USS San Ber
nardino — carrying 1800
marines, helicopters, tanks.

howitzers and amphibious as
sault vehicles arrived Tuesday at
the U.S. naval base at Subic Bay
in the Philippines.
After two weeks of exercises
there, the amphibious unit will
sail into the Arabian Sea, where
the ships will join some 20 other
U.S. naval vessels that have
been patrolling the mouth of the
Persian Gulf.
The Marine battalion was
identified as part of the 3rd
Marine Regiment, 3rd Marine
Division.
Officials said the Marine force

would remain in the area indefi
nitely. There was no indication
that any landing exercises would
be conducted along the tinder
box Persian Gulf coast.
Officials also emphasized that
dispatch of the amphibious force
had no connection with the ef
forts to win the release of the 50
Americans still held hostage by
Moslem militants in the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran.
There have been indications
in recent days of a possible
breakthrough in the hostage
situation, and the officials ap

peared to go out of their way to
say nothing that might upset it.
The decision recalled Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's State of the
Union speech Jan. 23. in which
he declared that he was pre
pared to use military force it
necessary to protect this coun
try's "vital interests" in the oil
laden Persian Gulf area.
At that time the president de
nounced the Soviet Union's
"radical and aggressive" inva
sion of Afghanistan and warned
Moscow against any military
move toward the gulf.
Dispatch of the amphibious
force was disclosed following
reports by U.S. officials that
Oman, Kenya and Somalia had
tentatively agreed to give the
United States access to military
facilities in their countries.
Under the agreements
American forces would be al
lowed to visit military bases
there and use them to store
equipment.
Although the Carter ad
ministration has declared that it
intends to build up U.S. forces
in the Indian Ocean-Arabian
Sea area. U.S. manpower in the
area is dwarfed by the 95,000
Soviet troops in Afghanistan,
plus the forces maintained by
the Soviets near their border
with Iran.
