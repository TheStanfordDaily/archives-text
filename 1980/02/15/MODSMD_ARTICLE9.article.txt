## 
### Stephen J. Lynton The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Robert
Anders, one of six Americans
smuggled out of Tehran with the
help of Canada, looks back on
his escape as a time of fear, un
certainty and considerable con
fusion.
"Someone said they smelled
smoke from the roof," the 54-
year-old Anders said Wednes
day, recalling the moment when

a group of Americans decided to
make their getaway from a con
sular building during the No\. 4
U.S. Embassy takeover.
"Sure, there was some anxi
ety. but (for) most of the people
that were there, that is one of
the political risks of foreign ser
\ice posts anyway," Anders said
in a telephone interview. "We
also felt that we might momen
tarily be relieved by the local
police or something."

Anders, a consular official, re
turned to the United States Jan.
30 along with five other Ameri
cans who were sheltered in
Tehran by Canadian officials for
nearly three months.
l our of the Americans es
caped with Anders from the
consular office, which is set
apart from the main embassy
building that the Iranian milit
ants took over. The sixth
American, agricultural attache
Lee Schatz, worked in an office
outside the embassy compound
and therefore, avoided capture.
Although the six Americans
pro\ ided a brief account of their
escape shortly after their return.
Anders was the first to agree to
be interviewed. Yet in the tele
phone interview from his rela
tives' home in Port Charlotte,
Fla.. Anders declined to discuss
many details, saying. "Our main
concern is still with the hos
tages."
Anders confirmed portions ol
an account provided by Kim
King, an American tourist who
also escaped from the consular
office during the Nov. 4
takeover and made his way back
to the United States shortly
thereafter.
Anders confirmed that a
Marine guard tired a tear-gas
canister to repel an Iranian de
monstrator who was trying to
enter the consular building. He
also confirmed that the Ameri
cans heard footsteps on the root
shortly before thev made their
escape.
