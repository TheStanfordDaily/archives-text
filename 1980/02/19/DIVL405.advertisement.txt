Hughes Aircraft
Company?
Don't think aircraft when you think of Hughes (we
don't build them). Think satellites. Think the first working
laser. Think the Norway-to-Turkey electronic air
defense system for NATO.
Think you'd like to talk with the electronics leader?
We'd like to talk with you before graduation. Ask your
placement office for dates the Hughes recruiters will
be interviewing on campus.
