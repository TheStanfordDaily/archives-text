the tire of the future
Economy: Today's retread conforms to federal safety standards, yet is sold, gener
ally, at less than 112 the price of a new tire. Why a saving of over half? The reason is
obvious - because 70% of the cost of the new tire is in the casing, which is recycled
through retreading. This gives retreads a true cost /performance edge.
Energy: The energy shortage has driven up the cost of fuel and oil-based products,
such as tires. Not only does a retread cost you less, but it helps conserve the nation's
oil supply It takes seven gallons of crude oil to produce the average new automobile
tire, but only two and a half gallons to retread one. At that rate, the more than 30 million
retreads sold in 1973 saved hundreds of millions of gallon of crude oil.
Ecology: More than 200 million tire casings are discarded annually in the United
States. This is enough to encircle the earth four times at the Equator. Since retreading
is recycling, it makes an obvious - an inexpensive - contribution toward solving this
paticular solid waste disposal problem
