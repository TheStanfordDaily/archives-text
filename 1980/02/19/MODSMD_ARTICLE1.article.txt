# Navy base inundidated by storms
## 
### David L. Langford The Associated Press 
A deluge in its sixth day carved away
more California hillsides and left
thousands homeless at an inundated
Navy base yesterday as "one storm
right after the other" rolled in from the
Pacific.
The fifth in the series of Pacific
storms was expected to strike the al
ready saturated area during the night,
and a sixth is due late today or early
tomorrow, the National Weather Ser
vice said.
The death toll climbed to at least 24
in the rainstorms that began last week.
The victims included 18 in California,
three in Arizona and three American
tourists swept away by floodwaters in
Tijuana, Mexico, just across the bor
der. One person was missing in
Arizona after being swept from a raft
on a flooded creek.
By Monday night, the season's rain
fall in Los Angeles had reached 19.33
inches, 9.8 inches above normal for this
time of year.
The National Weather Service fore
cast decreasing showers through today
and into tomorrow.
More coming
"We've had four disturbances about
every 36 to 48 hours, and it looks like
more disturbances coming in for the
next week," said a spokesman for the
service.
About 1000 people were evacuated
for the second time in less than 24
hours yesterday when new floods swept
through the low-lying Point Mugu
Naval Air Station, near Los Angeles,
inundating hundreds of homes and cars
with up to five feet of water.
Base spokesman Ray Lucasey said
evacuees slept on cots in hangars and in
hallways and stairways of science labs
on higher ground at the missile test
center.
The Army Corps of Engineers and
workers from the State Flood Control
center piled rocks to fortify the
weakening inner walls of a San Joaquin
River Delta Levee on Holland Tract
Island.
'Devastating*
"The wind has been very devastat
ing, pounding against the backside ot
the levee," said Don Neudeck, chief of
flood operations for the center.
"There's nothing there to stop the
eroding" of the island, which was still
being repaired after the battering by a
wicked storm last month.
Pacific Telephone reported crews
working to repair lines ripped by winds
or falling trees. More than 20,000
Pacific Gas & Electric customers were
without power at various times during
the dreary holiday weekend.
An avalanche warning was posted
for the east slope of the Southern Sierra
from Yuba pass south to Bishop. Wind
warnings were issued for motorists on
Interstate 80 over the Yolo Causeway
west of Sacramento.
In Shasta county, authorities yester
day identified the bodies found in the
wreckage of a light airplane as those of
three young men from Kodiak, Alaska,
and tentatively blamed the mountain
side crash on Saturday's storm.
