# North Koreans soften stance on unifying
## 
### William Chapman The Washington Post 
IOKVO — In an apparent
softening ot its bargaining
stance. North Korea would agree
to a series of economic and cul
tural exchanges with South
Korea before attempting to
achieve political unification, ac
cording to a source who usually
reflects views of the communist
government in Pyongyang.
That kind of agreement would
represent a shift in the north's
approach to unification ot the
Korean peninsula, bringing it
closer to the south's bargaining
position.
It appears to be a further con
cession offered by the north in its
latest intense campaign to get un
ification talks underway.
The change was explained in
an interview Wednesday bv Pak
Jae Ro. vice chairman ot a large
North Korean citi/ens associa
tion in Tokyo. He outlined a
three-stage approach to unifica
tion that gives tirst priority to a
series of gradually adopted ex
change programs, cooperative
agreements. military de
escalation and diplomatic coop
eration.
A year ago. the north was in
sisting on a political "confedera
tion"' of the two countries as the
lirst step to emerge from unifica
tion talks. In contrast, the south
was proposing a series ot smaller
steps, beginning with economic
cooperation.
First stage
But in the interview, Pak in
effect adopted the south s idea
and said the first stage should
consist of cooperative arrange
ments in economic, cultural, dip
lomatic and military fields.
The next step, he said, would
be the "confederation,'" but he
indicated that would come about
only after the cooperative ag
reements had a chance to work
and a feeling of "mistrust" bet
ween the two countries had been
dissipated. Ultimately, he said, a
"consensus" would appear on a
single, unified state.
Pak is vice chairman of the
central standing committee ol
the Cieneral Association of Ko

rean Residents 111 Japan, which
claims to represent about
600.000 Korean nationals who
favor the communist govern
ment in Pyongyang.
Reliable guide
Because of his frequent con
tacts with the Pyongyang gov
ernment. he is regarded as a reli
able guide to its political posi
tions. Over a period ot years, his
comments have proved to be ac
curate reflections ot the views
held by North Korean President
Kim II Sung.
The two governments, div ided
by war and ideology for 35 vears.
are now engaged, in working
level talks aimed at arranging a
meeting ol prime ministers to
discuss unification.
In pressing for the talks since
mid-January, the north has suc
cessively acceded to several posi
tions held by the south. It has
agreed to begin discussions bet
ween government authorities,
whereas in the past it had insisted
it would not talk on a
gov ernment-to-gov ernment
level, but only through meetings
of political parties and social
groups.
Recognized by name
It also has recognized the
south bv name as an independent
government for the first time and
has dropped its past insistence on
signing a formal peace treaty
with the United States before
dealing with Seoul.
But each ol those concessions
involved ways ol getting talks
started and did not touch on
what might come out of the
prime ministerial meetings. So
lar as could be learned. Pak's
comments are the lirst North
Korean indication ot what
schedule it would accept for ac
tually unifying the country.
"We favor lirst. multilateral
cooperation and interchanges."
Pak said. "Then after such ex
changes. we envision?i confeder
ation of the north and the south
•while leaving social and
economic systems intact on both
sides. So the fundamental as
sumption is that neither side
would try to impose its own sys
tem t)ii the other side.

"The confederation." Pak ad
ded. "would last tor a considera
ble time. And then this period
will produce a better understand
ing between the two sides and
then there will finally be a con
sensus lor complete integra
tion."
The lorm a unified Korea would
take would be determined dur
ing the period of confederation,
he said.
Series
As examples of the first-stage
series ot cooperative arrange
ments. Pak cited the following:
— Economic cooperation, in
cluding trade between the two
countries in essential com
modities. He said the north is wil
ling lirst to begin selling iron ore
to the south.
— Joint diplomatic and cul
tural missions abroad.
— Combined sports teams,
such as the joint Olympics squad
already suggested by Pyongyang
and rejected by Seoul.
— Military de-escalation, in
cluding a reduction of forces,
arms control and a mutual pull
back ol troops along each side ol
the demilitarized zone that now
separates the countries.
Park death
Pak indicated the north's at
titude has now changed because
South Korean President Park
Chung I lee is dead, the victim ol
an assassination on Oct. 26.
"He wanted a separate state
and his proposal would have led
to creating two Koreas. He ot
tered an economic interchange,
but it was aimed at keeping two
Koreas. He wanted to stay in
power and to do so he had to
pose as a champion of unifica
tion. II we accepted it.it could
only have been a help to him.
"We are now ready to accept
any proposal to help the north
south unitication if the other side
lias the commitment."
However, Pak emphasized
that the north is not abandoning
completely its hope of holding
what it now calls "broad-based"
unification talks among political
parties and social groups from
both sides. The south rejects that
idea as a device designed to

weaken its position because it
would bring into the discussions
such anti-government per
sonalities as former presidential
candidate Kim Dae Jung.
U.S. forces
Pak dealt with the question of
U.S. military forces in the south
with an almost casual indiffer
ence. readily agreeing that their
presence would not interfere
with the process o! reaching a
Korean accord. He said their
withdrawal is "not necessary"' to
create the climate foragreement.
Some observers have felt that
at some stage the north would
re\ert to its former position ot
insisting 011 a total troop with
drawal. l or more than a year, its
stance on that point has been
\ague.
As an example ot his country's
new flexibility on that point. Pak
pointed out the north had prop
osed a joint Olympic team for
the Moscow Olympics at a time
when more than 30,000 U.S.
troops remain in the south and
engage 111 joint exercises with
South Korean forces.
"Ot course." he added, "it the
I nited States decides to help
and gets out, that would be the
best situation."

to the south.
— Joint diplomatic and cul

— Combined sports teams,
such as the joint Olympics squad

Park death
Pak indicated the north's at
titude has now changed because
South Korean President Park
Chung I lee is dead, the victim ol
an assassination on Oct. 26.
"He wanted a separate state
and his proposal would have led
to creating two Koreas. He ot
tered an economic interchange,
but it was aimed at keeping two
Koreas. He wanted to stay in
power and to do so he had to
pose as a champion of unifica
tion. II we accepted it.it could
only have been a help to him.
"We are now ready to accept
any proposal to help the north
south unitication if the other side
lias the commitment."
However, Pak emphasized
that the north is not abandoning
completely its hope of holding
what it now calls "broad-based"
unification talks among political
parties and social groups from
both sides. The south rejects that
idea as a device designed to

weaken its position because it
would bring into the discussions
such anti-government per
sonalities as former presidential
candidate Kim Dae Jung.
U.S. forces
Pak dealt with the question of
U.S. military forces in the south
with an almost casual indiffer
ence. readily agreeing that their
presence would not interfere
with the process o! reaching a
Korean accord. He said their
withdrawal is "not necessary"' to
create the climate foragreement.
Some observers have felt that
at some stage the north would
re\ert to its former position ot
insisting 011 a total troop with
drawal. l or more than a year, its
stance on that point has been
\ague.
As an example ot his country's
new flexibility on that point. Pak
pointed out the north had prop
osed a joint Olympic team for
the Moscow Olympics at a time
when more than 30,000 U.S.
troops remain in the south and
engage 111 joint exercises with
South Korean forces.
"Ot course." he added, "it the
I nited States decides to help
and gets out, that would be the
best situation."
IOKVO — In an apparent
softening ot its bargaining
stance. North Korea would agree
to a series of economic and cul
tural exchanges with South
Korea before attempting to
achieve political unification, ac
cording to a source who usually
reflects views of the communist
government in Pyongyang.
That kind of agreement would
represent a shift in the north's
approach to unification ot the
Korean peninsula, bringing it
closer to the south's bargaining
position.
It appears to be a further con
cession offered by the north in its
latest intense campaign to get un
ification talks underway.
The change was explained in
an interview Wednesday bv Pak
Jae Ro. vice chairman ot a large
North Korean citi/ens associa
tion in Tokyo. He outlined a
three-stage approach to unifica
tion that gives tirst priority to a
series of gradually adopted ex
change programs, cooperative
agreements. military de
escalation and diplomatic coop
eration.
A year ago. the north was in
sisting on a political "confedera
tion"' of the two countries as the
lirst step to emerge from unifica
tion talks. In contrast, the south
was proposing a series ot smaller
steps, beginning with economic
cooperation.
First stage
But in the interview, Pak in
effect adopted the south s idea
and said the first stage should
consist of cooperative arrange
ments in economic, cultural, dip
lomatic and military fields.
The next step, he said, would
be the "confederation,'" but he
indicated that would come about
only after the cooperative ag
reements had a chance to work
and a feeling of "mistrust" bet
ween the two countries had been
dissipated. Ultimately, he said, a
"consensus" would appear on a
single, unified state.
Pak is vice chairman of the
central standing committee ol
the Cieneral Association of Ko

rean Residents 111 Japan, which
claims to represent about
600.000 Korean nationals who
favor the communist govern
ment in Pyongyang.
Reliable guide
Because of his frequent con

comments have proved to be ac

held by North Korean President
Kim II Sung.
The two governments, div ided
by war and ideology for 35 vears.
are now engaged, in working
level talks aimed at arranging a
meeting ol prime ministers to
discuss unification.
In pressing for the talks since
mid-January, the north has suc
cessively acceded to several posi
tions held by the south. It has
agreed to begin discussions bet
ween government authorities,
whereas in the past it had insisted
it would not talk on a
gov ernment-to-gov ernment
level, but only through meetings
of political parties and social
groups.
Recognized by name
It also has recognized the
south bv name as an independent
government for the first time and
has dropped its past insistence on
signing a formal peace treaty
with the United States before
dealing with Seoul.
But each ol those concessions
involved ways ol getting talks
started and did not touch on
what might come out of the
prime ministerial meetings. So
lar as could be learned. Pak's
comments are the lirst North
Korean indication ot what
schedule it would accept for ac
tually unifying the country.
"We favor lirst. multilateral
cooperation and interchanges."
Pak said. "Then after such ex
changes. we envision?i confeder
ation of the north and the south
•while leaving social and
economic systems intact on both
sides. So the fundamental as
sumption is that neither side
would try to impose its own sys
