# Chinese greet new year amidst turmoil

### William Sexton Newsday 
PEKING — China's 1 billion people
stocked up last week for their lunar New
Year celebration, apparently undeterred by
cancellation of year-end bonuses and omin
ous hints of a coming purge in the Com
munist Party.
In fact, many enterprises had ignored the
edict against bonuses and paid the money
despite a Cabinet proclamation that this "al
ready has hurt the country's finances." But
published reports on the eve of festivities
indicated far more serious disciplinary prob
lems within the regime.
For about one-third of mankind, Friday
night was New Year's Eve, the last day of the
last month in the lunar calendar. Practically
the whole of Asia will welcome in the Year of
the Monkey. In China, Saturday began a

three-day holiday from work and four weeks
of ongoing hilarity marking winter's end.
The ebullient crush of last-minute shop
pers in Peking's food markets and depart
ment stores was in bright contrast to the
more sober lead story in The People's Daily:
the party's national organ. It revealed a
"most recent" meeting of party headquarters
departments at which officials were told, in
effect, to shape up or be shipped out. The
clear implication was that senior vice premier
Deng Xiaoping's modernization program
still was meeting resistance in party head
quarters.
Deng had attacked the party's lack of re
sponsiveness in a speech to I(),()()() Peking
area partv cadres (administrators) on Jan.
16.
"Those who resist the leadership should be
criticized," People's Daily said in its report of

the session. "Those who refuse to make
amends should he reported for strict treat
ment.-' The People's Daily account seemed
to indicate Deng is still firmly in charge.
What was remarkable about it, a Western
analyst said, was that such opposition still
existed at such a level of the regime, and to
such a degree.
The sole discordant note came under this
recent headline in the Peking Daily: "The
state council Cabinet issues an urgent circu
lar banning the awarding of annual bonuses
during the spring festival."
Because ol the strain of modernization on
the national budget, the government had
canceled bonuses in December.
A ( hinese white-collar worker confirmed
that he had received his bonus and added
that the government would be unable to col
lect it back. "It's already spent," he said.
