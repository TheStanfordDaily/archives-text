# Branner mimics campaign
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Branner residents, not content
to wait tor the presidential
nominating conventions this
summer, decided to have two ol
their own. Designed to "parallel
the American presidential pro
cess as closely as is possible in a
three-day e\ent," these conven
tions will ha\e student delegates
voting lor real-life candidates:
Republicans Hush. Reagan. An
derson, Baker, and Democrats
Carter and Kennedy.
The project, organized and
runby Brannerstatl member Bill
Ottut. has been gearing up since
Feb. 1. The climax of the
month's activities will be next
week when a caucus, lour
primaries, and a convention for
each parts will be held on I eb.
27. 28. and 29.
The caucus, involving f>s
first-floor Branner residents plus
other interested students, will
pick 15 Democratic and II Re
publican delegates and choose
which candidates those delegates
will support at their respective
convention.
But the caucus is actually
non-binding and the delegates
are not obliged to vote lor the
candidate whose group they
were in originally.
On Feb. 28 the four primaries,
each lasting four hours, will be
held. Each corridor will repre
sent a different procedure actu
ally used in various state,
primaries.
One hall. representing
California, will be winner-take
all. The candidate with the most
votes will get all ot his party's
delegates, live for the Democrats
and four for the Republicans.
Another hall, using New
Hampshire's style, will have
proportional selection. Candi
dates who do not receive 1(1 per
cent ol the vote will be elimi
nated.
The hall emulating the New
York primary will use the list ol

delegates method. The list of de
legates supporting each candi
date will be placed on the ballot
without reference to who each
delegate favors.
Michigan's and Illinois' style
will represent the district with a
"beauty contest kicker". Five
districts will each elect one dele
gate. The candidate who wins the
district must select a person from
that district to be his convention
delegate, said Offut.
In the convention on Feb. 29,
the committee for each candi
date will try to obtain a majority
ol delegates. The winning group
will receive approximately $50.
Offut said the campaigns must
tell him their plans for the $50 in
advance. "Most have decided to
have a dorm function, but one is
going to pay oil its best workers
with live dollars each, he added.
Each Branner resident has two
votes and each outsider has one
vote. Branneritesmay place both
votes in one party or split their
votes. Outsiders may participate
in only one event.
"It a campaign can obtain a
one dollar contribution from
sev en of Branner's 10 halls, each
dollar will be matched from the
treasury (the oil ice)." said Offut.
A campaign can receive up to
$30 once qualified to receive
matching funds. Offut said he
hopes this will stimulate small
contributions across the board.
Campaigns can spend their
money on publicity, gilts and
paying people to bring in votes.
Directly buying votes with cash,
however, is forbidden. Cam
paigns must receipt their expen
ditures.
There will be 50 Democratic
and 40 Republican delegates to
the two conventions. Offut will
pick 10 delegates at random to
represent the uncommitted dele
gates found at real conventions.
Delegates are all Brannerites.
hui Offut said, "il there are a lot
ol outsiders who want to be dele
gates. we'll probably allow it."

Outsiders wishing to vote must
bring their Stanford I.D. and re
gister with Offut.
According to Branner Utilis
ing Associate (RA) Ted Gar
denswartz, Offut and the RAs
started talking about the conv en
tion at the beginning of this quar
ter. They cut Offut's original
six-day detailed program to
three days.
"There's a lot of excitement
about the convention." said
Ciardenswa rtz.
According to Offut. RAs and
athletes are valuable to the
committees for bringing in out
side votes. Anderson, for exam
ple. received Ins early support
from two RAs.
The Connally committee lost
two ol its RAs to the Baker cam
paign and subsequently folded.
" I suspect both campaigns will
use the alieady existing cam
paign bodies on campus to help
them. They will probably contact
these people and use their mail
ing lists."he said.
He added, however, that
"most of the politicking has been
going on inside Branner.
Offut. who graduated from the
Law School last vear. is a TA for
Poli Sci I and the Office Secret
ary for Branner. He will be the
Branner Resident Fellow spring
quarter.

Michigan's and Illinois' style
will represent the district with a
"beauty contest kicker". Five
districts will each elect one dele
gate. The candidate who wins the
district must select a person from
that district to be his convention
delegate, said Offut.
In the convention on Feb. 29,
the committee for each candi
date will try to obtain a majority
ol delegates. The winning group
will receive approximately $50.
Offut said the campaigns must
tell him their plans for the $50 in
advance. "Most have decided to
have a dorm function, but one is
going to pay oil its best workers
with live dollars each, he added.
Each Branner resident has two
votes and each outsider has one
vote. Branneritesmay place both
votes in one party or split their
votes. Outsiders may participate
in only one event.
"It a campaign can obtain a
one dollar contribution from
sev en of Branner's 10 halls, each
dollar will be matched from the
treasury (the oil ice)." said Offut.
A campaign can receive up to
$30 once qualified to receive
matching funds. Offut said he
hopes this will stimulate small
contributions across the board.
Campaigns can spend their
money on publicity, gilts and
paying people to bring in votes.
Directly buying votes with cash,
however, is forbidden. Cam
paigns must receipt their expen
ditures.
There will be 50 Democratic
and 40 Republican delegates to
the two conventions. Offut will
pick 10 delegates at random to
represent the uncommitted dele
gates found at real conventions.
Delegates are all Brannerites.
hui Offut said, "il there are a lot
ol outsiders who want to be dele
gates. we'll probably allow it."

Outsiders wishing to vote must
bring their Stanford I.D. and re
gister with Offut.
According to Branner Utilis
ing Associate (RA) Ted Gar
denswartz, Offut and the RAs
started talking about the conv en
tion at the beginning of this quar
ter. They cut Offut's original
six-day detailed program to
three days.
"There's a lot of excitement
about the convention." said
Ciardenswa rtz.
According to Offut. RAs and
athletes are valuable to the
committees for bringing in out
side votes. Anderson, for exam
ple. received Ins early support
from two RAs.
The Connally committee lost
two ol its RAs to the Baker cam
paign and subsequently folded.
" I suspect both campaigns will
use the alieady existing cam
paign bodies on campus to help
them. They will probably contact
these people and use their mail
ing lists."he said.
He added, however, that
"most of the politicking has been
going on inside Branner.
Offut. who graduated from the
Law School last vear. is a TA for
Poli Sci I and the Office Secret
ary for Branner. He will be the
Branner Resident Fellow spring
quarter.
Branner residents, not content
to wait tor the presidential
nominating conventions this
summer, decided to have two ol
their own. Designed to "parallel
the American presidential pro
cess as closely as is possible in a
three-day e\ent," these conven
tions will ha\e student delegates
voting lor real-life candidates:
Republicans Hush. Reagan. An
derson, Baker, and Democrats
Carter and Kennedy.
The project, organized and
runby Brannerstatl member Bill
Ottut. has been gearing up since
Feb. 1. The climax of the
month's activities will be next
week when a caucus, lour
primaries, and a convention for
each parts will be held on I eb.
27. 28. and 29.
The caucus, involving f>s
first-floor Branner residents plus
other interested students, will
pick 15 Democratic and II Re
publican delegates and choose
which candidates those delegates
will support at their respective
convention.
But the caucus is actually
non-binding and the delegates
are not obliged to vote lor the
candidate whose group they
were in originally.
On Feb. 28 the four primaries,
each lasting four hours, will be
held. Each corridor will repre
sent a different procedure actu
ally used in various state,
primaries.
One hall. representing
California, will be winner-take
all. The candidate with the most
votes will get all ot his party's
delegates, live for the Democrats
and four for the Republicans.
Another hall, using New
Hampshire's style, will have
proportional selection. Candi
dates who do not receive 1(1 per
cent ol the vote will be elimi
nated.
The hall emulating the New
York primary will use the list ol

delegates method. The list of de
legates supporting each candi
date will be placed on the ballot
without reference to who each
delegate favors.
