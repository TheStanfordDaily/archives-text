# Rising rail rates force coal imports
## 
### J.P. Smith The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — The Un
ited Suites has created a modern
version of that old cautionary
cliche —"carrying coals to New
castle."
Corpus Christi s Central Power
and Light reacted in earnest to
President Jimmy Carter's re
peated urgings that utilities
switch from burning foreign oil
or natural gas to coal. So last Au
gust the investor-owned utility
bought and burned 33,000 tons
of coal — imported from South
Africa.
"It's cra/y, but we did it be
cause its cheaper than shipping
coal by rail from Colorado," says
Central Power and I iglit execu
tive Joseph Shafer.
One of many
Central Power and Light is not
alone.
San Antonio City Public Ser
vice. Southwestern Llectric and
a handful of other (mil Coast
utilities are considering buying
South African, Australian and
even Chinese coal, instead ol
low-sultur coal Irom Wyoming
and Colorado, or e\ en Texas and
Louisiana lignite.
Why should anyone import
coal when the West has an abun
dance ot it'.' The reason utilities
offer is that domestic railroad
shipping rates have more than
doubled in the last three years,
thanks to decisions by the In
terstate Commerce Commission.
This "coals to Newcastle" im
broglio stems from a collision be
tween two ol Carter's most pub
licized goals: rebuilding .Ameri
ca's railroads, while at the same
time, "mining and burning more
coal to cut our dependence on
foreign oil."
Moved by rail
But 65 percent ol the nation's
coal production is mined by rail
and ol that. N5 percent is carried
by so-called "captive" lines -
railroads that provide the sole
available service to a mining
area.
I'hese conditions, along with
growing congressional sentiment
in favor of railroad deregulation
allow the railroads, as Rep. Bob
Eekhardt (D-Te\.) puts it. "to
gobble up enormous economic
advantage afforded by our own
abundant domestic coal re
sources."
West Virginia Gov. John
Rockleller IV. chairman ol the
President's Commission on the
Coal Industry, said, "the whole
situation is cra/y.'
Eckhardt's oversight and in
vestigations subcommittee re
leased a report last week charg
ing the ICC with "failure to pro
tect shippers against railroad

abuse of market power."
The subcommittee recom
mended that the agency change
its policies, which at present
"would allow the railroads to
charge whatever the traffic will
bear in most coal markets and
. . . would allow them to extract
the difference between the lower
cost domestic coal and the BTU
equivalent of imported oil."
Rewarding efficiency
At the same time, Eekhardt
charged, ICC policy will not im
prove the financial health of rail
roads — it will only "reward inef
ficiency."
Carl Bagge, head of the National
Coal Association, called the
move to import coal "ludicrous,"
and Eekhardt remarked earlier
last week, "the railroads know
they have the only game in town
and have not been afraid to
exploit their position."
Richard Briggs, of the Associ
ation of American Railroads,
labels these kinds of suggestions
"a gross exaggeration . . . rail
road rates have gone up lar less
than coal prices."
At the Transportation De
partment. officials say
industry-wide the railroads still

earn less than 2 percent on their
investment, and even then
domestic coal moved by rail is
cheaper than imported oil.
And a leading railroad execu
tive. who asked not to be iden
tified, says the .iroads have
been singled out "so the utilities
can hold down their rates so they
can earn bigger profits for them
selves."
Much of the rhetorical
crossfire, however, is lost on San
Antonio City Public Service's
Arthur Von Rosenburg.
Penalties
Rosenburg- says that San
Antonio electrical consumers
are "being penalized for switch
ing from natural gas to coal 2':
years ago."
In 1977 the public utility began
burning Wyoming coal it had
purchased under long-term con
tract Irom Sun Oil at $7.30 a ton.
To handle the coal. San Antonio
spent $25 million buying more
than KOO hopper cars to carry t lie
coal south Irom the mine in daily
trains.
When the coal started mov ing
in October 1977. City Public
Service was paying the Bur

lington Northern 5i0.93 a ton to
haul it. Since then, however, a
series of rate increases has nearly
doubled that price to $ 14.25 — a
level recently approved by the
ICC.
Because ot the Burlington
Northern's price increase. Von
Rosenburg said that the utility
has concluded that it would be
cheaper to buy 'Australian coal.
As tor the government's trans
portation policy, he said, '"it
looks like the electrical utility
rate payers are being forced to
pay tor rebuilding the railroads."
In a narrow sense, he's right.
Under the ICC's rules, so
called "ditterential pricing" is
permissible. This complex
rate-making concept in effect al
lows the railroads to charge more
lor shipping some commodities
— such as coal — than they do
lor others.
Former ICC chairman Daniel
O'Neal explained: "We decided
that there should he a profit for
that part ot the system that
moves coal, but also concluded
that that s\ stem is to make a con
tribution lor the movement of
other commodities as well."

crossfire, however, is lost on San
Antonio City Public Service's
Arthur Von Rosenburg.
Penalties
Rosenburg- says that San
Antonio electrical consumers
are "being penalized for switch
ing from natural gas to coal 2':
years ago."
In 1977 the public utility began
burning Wyoming coal it had
purchased under long-term con
tract Irom Sun Oil at $7.30 a ton.
To handle the coal. San Antonio
spent $25 million buying more
than KOO hopper cars to carry t lie
coal south Irom the mine in daily
trains.
When the coal started mov ing
in October 1977. City Public
Service was paying the Bur

lington Northern 5i0.93 a ton to
haul it. Since then, however, a
series of rate increases has nearly
doubled that price to $ 14.25 — a
level recently approved by the
ICC.
Because ot the Burlington
Northern's price increase. Von
Rosenburg said that the utility
has concluded that it would be
cheaper to buy 'Australian coal.
As tor the government's trans
portation policy, he said, '"it
looks like the electrical utility
rate payers are being forced to
pay tor rebuilding the railroads."
In a narrow sense, he's right.
Under the ICC's rules, so
called "ditterential pricing" is
permissible. This complex
rate-making concept in effect al
lows the railroads to charge more
lor shipping some commodities
— such as coal — than they do
lor others.
Former ICC chairman Daniel
O'Neal explained: "We decided
that there should he a profit for
that part ot the system that
moves coal, but also concluded
that that s\ stem is to make a con
tribution lor the movement of
other commodities as well."
WASHINGTON — The Un
ited Suites has created a modern
version of that old cautionary
cliche —"carrying coals to New
castle."
Corpus Christi s Central Power
and Light reacted in earnest to
President Jimmy Carter's re
peated urgings that utilities
switch from burning foreign oil
or natural gas to coal. So last Au
gust the investor-owned utility
bought and burned 33,000 tons
of coal — imported from South
Africa.
"It's cra/y, but we did it be
cause its cheaper than shipping
coal by rail from Colorado," says
Central Power and I iglit execu
tive Joseph Shafer.
One of many
Central Power and Light is not
alone.
San Antonio City Public Ser
vice. Southwestern Llectric and
a handful of other (mil Coast
utilities are considering buying
South African, Australian and
even Chinese coal, instead ol
low-sultur coal Irom Wyoming
and Colorado, or e\ en Texas and
Louisiana lignite.
Why should anyone import
coal when the West has an abun
dance ot it'.' The reason utilities
offer is that domestic railroad
shipping rates have more than
doubled in the last three years,
thanks to decisions by the In
terstate Commerce Commission.
This "coals to Newcastle" im
broglio stems from a collision be
tween two ol Carter's most pub
licized goals: rebuilding .Ameri
ca's railroads, while at the same
time, "mining and burning more
coal to cut our dependence on
foreign oil."
Moved by rail
But 65 percent ol the nation's
coal production is mined by rail
and ol that. N5 percent is carried
by so-called "captive" lines -
railroads that provide the sole
available service to a mining
area.
I'hese conditions, along with
growing congressional sentiment
in favor of railroad deregulation
allow the railroads, as Rep. Bob
Eekhardt (D-Te\.) puts it. "to
gobble up enormous economic
advantage afforded by our own
abundant domestic coal re
sources."
West Virginia Gov. John
Rockleller IV. chairman ol the
President's Commission on the
Coal Industry, said, "the whole
situation is cra/y.'
Eckhardt's oversight and in
vestigations subcommittee re
leased a report last week charg
ing the ICC with "failure to pro
tect shippers against railroad

abuse of market power."
The subcommittee recom
mended that the agency change
its policies, which at present
"would allow the railroads to
charge whatever the traffic will
bear in most coal markets and
. . . would allow them to extract
the difference between the lower
cost domestic coal and the BTU
equivalent of imported oil."
Rewarding efficiency
At the same time, Eekhardt
charged, ICC policy will not im
prove the financial health of rail
roads — it will only "reward inef
ficiency."
Carl Bagge, head of the National
Coal Association, called the
move to import coal "ludicrous,"
and Eekhardt remarked earlier
last week, "the railroads know
they have the only game in town
and have not been afraid to
exploit their position."
Richard Briggs, of the Associ
ation of American Railroads,
labels these kinds of suggestions
"a gross exaggeration . . . rail
road rates have gone up lar less
than coal prices."
At the Transportation De
partment. officials say
industry-wide the railroads still

earn less than 2 percent on their
investment, and even then
domestic coal moved by rail is
cheaper than imported oil.
And a leading railroad execu
tive. who asked not to be iden
tified, says the .iroads have
been singled out "so the utilities
can hold down their rates so they
can earn bigger profits for them
selves."
