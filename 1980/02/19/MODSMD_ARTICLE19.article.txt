I OS ANGELES — A leak ol
radioactive water at the Lniver
sitv ol California's Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory from re
cent earthquakes was insignific
ant and did not exceed federal
safety standards, according to a
report given last week to a UC
Board ol Regents committee.
The leak of water containing
low levels of tritium, a radioac
tive form of hydrogen, "was
found to have spilled about
one-fortieth of the amount of
tritium contained in a luminous
wrist watch dial into a catch ba
sin. where it was contained," the
report said.
Regent Stanley K. Shein
baum. who visited the site 4N
hours after the quake, said."The
damage I saw was inconsequen
tial."
Two major items scheduled to
be addressed by the board's fi
nance committee were post
poned until I riday when the full
board is scheduled to meet.
One item was university pres
ident David Saxon's protest
against Gov. Edmund Brown
Jr.'s request for the university to
suggest ways its state budget
could be cut if the 50 percent
state income tax cut initiative is
approved in June.
Brown has asked the univer

sity. like state agencies, to submit
a plan that would reduce the uni
versity's state budget by 30 per
cent in the event the taxcutting
measure, sponsored by Howard
Jar\ is. should pass. Saxon said in
a letter to Brown the suggestion
is "destructive and divisive."
The other postponed item was
a report alleging discrimination
in the University Cooperative
Extension serv ice. a county -lev el
farm program.
University Vice President Ar
chie Kleingartner is scheduled to
submit to the committee the re
port that concluded minorities
are being discriminated against
in the UCCE program, but be
cause of poor management, not
racism.
Kleingartner has recom
mended a lull-time director tor
the program. Its current man
ager. Jerome Siebert. has been
under heavy criticism I'rom a
teacher's union and representa
tives of some minority
employees, who accuse him of
high-handed actions and pro
agribusiness bias.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Agricul
ture Department's inspector
general's office released Thurs
day the findings of its investiga
tion into the service and con
cluded that it "could develop no
substantial evidence to support

allegations of discrimination"
against the program. But it
added that "continued im
provements seem warranted" in
the I CCE's hiring of minorities.
The USD A investigation was
requested by the U.S. Justice
Department.
Cooperate Extension, through
its county offices, provides in
formation about farm research
and nutrition to farmers and con
sumers. and runs 4-H programs
for youth.
The Livermore facility, site ol
nuclear weapons research, was
rocked by earthquakes on Jan.
24 and Jan. 26. The report,
headed by the lab's executive as
sociate director. Richard L.
Wagner. Jr.. noted that "no
buildings that hold radioactive or
toxic material suffered any dam
age that affected their structural
integrity."although two lasers
were slightly damaged.
It also said the buildings were
designed to withstand "much
stronger" quakes than the recent
ones.
Officials estimated the cost to
restore lab equipment to pre*
earthquake condition would be
about $3.5 million, while
another $6.5 million would be
needed to reduce the extent of
"architectural damages in future
earthquakes."
