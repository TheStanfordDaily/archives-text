## Angie Paccione Benchwarming painful experience 
### 
"Everything comes and goes,
Pleasure moves on too quickly
And pain leaves too slow . .
Joni Mitchell captured it in a
song. Charles Dickens caught it in
a paradox ... "It was the best of
times. . . .it was the worst of
times." No matter how it's
worded, the essence is derived
from a fundamental question
that has plagued mankind . . .
How can we find* pleasure in
pain?
No one ever said it was easy,
but there is a way. Well, at least
in my case. From the athlete's
perspective. "benchwarming"
can be. and often is. a very pain
ful experience. It's not so bad if
you're accustomed to it and can
accept that crucial role with dig
nity. But how does a player,
whose customary function is to
play 25 to 35 minutes, assume
such an unnatural and unfamiliar
role? With dignity? With pride?
Graciously?
There are countless ways to
accept being relegated to the
bench and I've tried them all. A
good, safe place to start is by
shifting the blame. Needless to
say. the safest person to shift it to
is the coach. The coach ulti
mately makes the decision and
superficially it often appears
asinine — so. blame the coach.
Talk about her/him up and down
and all around campus so
everyone will be convinced that
it's not your fault, it's completely
out of your hands, and besides,
the coach is an ass.
This approach usually lasts for
a few days, until you tire yourself
out downgrading the coach (who
in fact recruited you and af
forded you the "privilege" of at
tending Stanford). This clever
escape is quickly followed by
making late-determining
threats. The most common
threat is, "I'm leaving, who

needs this crap!" Ah yes. the old
transfer strategy ! This one never
fails to draw attention and while
the culprit may sound sincere
(and indeed may be) don't be
lieve it! At the time it is the cent
ral issue in the player's mind, but
after weighing the alternatives
(of which there often are none),
the player decides to stay. After
all, "the Stanford degree" is very
important to her (him too).
So now the controversy has
subsided, all the tears have been
unleashed and the big fuss is
over. With the team content that
you're not transfering. all your
special attention has dissipated.
Oh. but you won't let it disap
pear — not you. you sly, schem
ing devil you! Pressed for time,
you think of something quick —
a new tactic that can't flop.
In your latest attempt to man
ipulate your coach, you adopt
the "two can play that game"
philosophy and try to beat him/
her at her own "game." (This is
better known as lying down and
dying, except, unlike most
deaths, this one has a creative,
dramatic flair.) You decide to
play the part of your new role
and resign yourself to being a
"benchwarmer." "OK coach, if
this is what you want. I'm gonna
let you have it. but good!" So,
you play with no enthusiasm, no
hustle, no desire . . . just going
through the motions.
You soon discover that this
hurts you more than the coach
because it's so uncharacteristic.
Apathy disgusts you. and be
sides, you're trying to teach the
coach a lesson, but not at your
own expense! By now. you've al
ready sat through four games or
so and the tension is mounting
. . . AAARRRGH! You just
can't stand it anymore! You've
already swallowed (in four or so
large unpalatable gulps) the
majority of your pride and have
graciously (?) succumbed to
humility. What's left in it for
you?
All along you haven't had to
ask too much of yourself . . .
you've transferred the blame and
the responsibility, so in essence,
you're off the hook (but not off
the bench!) But now the game's
over and the decision comes
down to you. After realizing that
this world does not revolve
around you and that life (and

basketball games) will indeed
continue — with or without your
help — you decide to make a
decision. Much to everyone's
surprise, you decide that if
you're ever going to play again,
you'd better move your butt. So
you begin to assert yourself in
practice and start playing like
you know how. You're a bit rusty
— after all, you haven't "played"
in a long while — but you're try
ing.
So where's the pleasure amidst
all this inner pain? Has man's
fundamental question been re
solved? Through this entire
ordeal 1 knew something good
would eventually come of it, but
that's usually an end result. The
Lord works in mysterious ways
but He always has good inten
tions. I would be lying to you if I
now said. "I've enjoyed all that
I've recently been through." In
fact, for the most part it's been a
living hell . . . but no one said it
would be easy.
Though I am wholeheartedly
opposed to the technique of tear
ing down character in order to
build it up, I can say that my
character has been fortified. I
have discovered a personal
strength that I've always
doubted I possess — a remarka
ble and exciting discovery at
that! In my "rap session" with
my coaches. I found that people,
even coaches, do care about the
athlete as a person and not only
as an athlete.
I learned a lot about my own
fears and weaknesses and re
ceived valuable insight about
strength that was well ap
preciated. I learned that anxiety
tends to make you react to your
emotions rather than the situa
tion at hand. By reacting to your
emotions, you become a victim
o! your weaknesses instead ot
building a strategy around your
strengths.
I guess the most pleasure was
in knowing that I'd soon get the
courage, the strength, to put my
self on the line — to go out on the
limb and risk myself in order to
make real an image that was
presented to me in the rap ses
sion with my coaches. If we go
through life avoiding risks, it will
be very safe but incredibly bor
ing.
I've decided that the best way
to improve my athletic perfor

mance. develop my God-given
talents and enjoy my experiences
is to dump all the negative emo
tional garbage and concentrate
on what makes athletics pleasur
able. So watch out, 'cause I'm
coming back, and I'm even
stronger than before!
