## 'Need' stance questionable 
### 
Well, Chris Moylan, you've
made a point and shown ;in obvi
ously weak aptitude lor logic in
your column (Daily, Feb. K).
Your anger at being called a
"dummy" and a "latent racist" is
very understandable. Insulting a
person's convictions isn't the
way to persuade him to ration
ally consider an argument. Your
personal set ol values are yours
to keep and cherish.
I should hope that this column
proves to be more than the most
recent shot in the "Affirmative
Action Verbal Exchange." I'm
not writing this column to send
the ball into anyone's court;
rather. I'm just raising questions
on the points made in your col
umn. "Affirmative action: need
not race." In your column you
mentioned your Irish ancestry
and the exploitation that your
forefathers may or may not have
suffered.

To compare the gravity of
abuse suffered by the Negro in
America to that of the Irish im
migrants is like comparing a fish
fight to a riot. How many Irish
families were split because they
were sold to different owners? I
assert that the Irish dignity and
spirit weren't challenged in
nearly as severe a manner as
were the dignity and spirit of the
Negro in America. It's true that
this is all in the past, but I feel
confident in pointing out the
flaws in your comparison.
Your position on affirmative
action is your personal opinion,
but in your column you men
tion, "It seems to me that affir
mative action programs based <\n
race should be phased out when
the percentage of minorities at a
school or company equals the
percentage in the population.
And it seems to me that this
point, if not here, is just around

the corner." Are you suggesting
that the minute black population
at places like Stanford, Harvard
or Kaiser Aluminum is indicative
of the portion of the general
population that is comprised of
blacks?
Contrary to your expressed
views, blacks who aren't as
"lucky" as the blacks at Stanford
find discrimination a very power
ful force in their lives; it's evident
when they go out daily in a fruit
less search for jobs. They experi
ence it when attending school in
the inferior, vocationally
oriented classes which the sys
tem has provided for them. In
reconsidering your position on
affirmative action, please con
sider the above questions which
challenge the very premises
which your entire argument rests
on.
