# Is 'Big Apple' core rotten?
## 
### 
I heard on the news a tew
nights ago that New York state
will he losing four congressional
seats as a result ot the 1 1 >N() cen
sus figures, and that much of the
exodus has been directly from
New York City. Having spent
three months there this past
summer, 1 now understand why
people are leaving.
Let me be quick to compli
ment New York City. No place
can match it for outstanding
museums, fabulous restaurants,
magnificent architecture, superb
entertainment and wondrous di
versity. Where else could one eat
in a kosher Chinese restaurant,
or hear a classical concert per
formed entirely on the har
monica? Where else would a
bum ask you for a spare 78 cents,
or could you take a walking tour
from 2 to 7 a.m.?
Trying to take it all in is like
trying to swallow the ocean, and
it's enormous fun to try. New
York is a sensory overload.
In addition, career oppor
' tunities abound, and spending a
few years at the New York head
quarters of a firm is often a pre
requisite for rising to a top posi
tion. New York is fast-paced,
dynamic and assertive, from its
businessmen to its cabbies.
There are also obvious draw
backs to New York, including
the dirtiness, the massive ex
panses of concrete, the summer
weather, and the simple crush of
so much humanity in such li
mited space. The personal
tragedies of New York are
strewn plentifully about the citv.
oozing out of every pore.
On the surface, one can point
to these and other plusses and
minusses of New York. But 1
think there's a much more sub
tle. more pervasive quality that
the city lacks, the absence of
which reaches behind the fancy
hotel facades, deep into the sub
way tunnels, and from Harlem to
the Statue of Liberty. It reveals
itself in the furtive glances ex
changed between passers-by. and
in the tentative nature with
which one opens one's wallet.
It's more an abstract feeling than

a tangible substance, and yet it
keeps New York from being a
comfortable place to live. I call
this missing quality integrity —
the Big I.
One theory of human de
velopment suggests that the pur
pose of forming a citv is to create
a whole greater than the sum of
the individual parts. Just as a
completed jigsaw puzzle integ
rates hundreds of separate pieces
into a single image, so should a
city possess a synergy that com
bines its parts into a vibrant and
constructive unit. New York cer-

tainly has all the parts, but the
pieces just aren't integrated very
well.
Pooh, pooh, you may say.
Every big city's somewhat
dangerous, and every town
(large or small) can seem un
friendly to an outsider. Why pick
on New York? I can only reply
that in my travels throughout the
United States and Europe, I
simply felt the lack of integrity
and trust more intensely in New
York than anywhere else.
People do not take responsi
bility for helping others in New
York; they're not able to help
themselves nearly enough.
People there are more interested
in getting somewhere, or in get
ting ahead than in making the
world a better place in which to
live. You only have to watch lit
erally thousands of people pass
by a blind old man asking for
loose change once to know that
New York is not supportive —
it's cutthroat. The old man cried,
and I felt disgusted.
Even casual or summer vis
itors learn quickly not to look
people in the eye as they walk

down the street. That might in
vite a solicitation or a personal
confrontation with another
human being.
There's always a feeling that
you might he getting ripped off in
New York. Having paid $4.95
for some suntan oil being sold for
$2.75 around the corner (not on
sale in either place), I know why
this fear persists. People simply
want what othehs have, or have
to offer.
vYet perhaps I am being a bit
harsh. I'm not saying that New
Yorkers are necessarily to

blame, but if you constantly
heard stories about muggings
and people pushed in front of
subway trains, you might get a
third lock on your front door and
be watchful of your fellow man
as well. Perhaps there are just
too many people.
Some of the most sensitive, ar
tistic and intelligent people 1
know dwell in New York, and
they are no less wonderful for
living there. To the person, how
ever, they admit to a loss of per
sonal freedom and space, and
acknowledge that New York af
fects their outlook on themselves
and others as well.
In a sense, the loss of congres
sional seats is a blessing for New
York. With fewer people, there
may be fewer pressures and
flaws, and integrity may have a
chance to grow. In the long run,
the fact that New York is losing
political power is a victory for the
humanity of the place.

seats as a result ot the 1 1 >N() cen
sus figures, and that much of the
exodus has been directly from
New York City. Having spent
three months there this past
summer, 1 now understand why
people are leaving.
Let me be quick to compli
ment New York City. No place
can match it for outstanding
museums, fabulous restaurants,
magnificent architecture, superb
entertainment and wondrous di
versity. Where else could one eat
in a kosher Chinese restaurant,
or hear a classical concert per
formed entirely on the har
monica? Where else would a
bum ask you for a spare 78 cents,
or could you take a walking tour
from 2 to 7 a.m.?
Trying to take it all in is like
trying to swallow the ocean, and
it's enormous fun to try. New
York is a sensory overload.
In addition, career oppor
' tunities abound, and spending a
few years at the New York head
quarters of a firm is often a pre
requisite for rising to a top posi
tion. New York is fast-paced,
dynamic and assertive, from its
businessmen to its cabbies.
There are also obvious draw
backs to New York, including
the dirtiness, the massive ex
panses of concrete, the summer
weather, and the simple crush of
so much humanity in such li
mited space. The personal
tragedies of New York are
strewn plentifully about the citv.
oozing out of every pore.
On the surface, one can point
to these and other plusses and
minusses of New York. But 1
think there's a much more sub
tle. more pervasive quality that
the city lacks, the absence of
which reaches behind the fancy
hotel facades, deep into the sub
way tunnels, and from Harlem to
the Statue of Liberty. It reveals
itself in the furtive glances ex
changed between passers-by. and
in the tentative nature with
which one opens one's wallet.
It's more an abstract feeling than

a tangible substance, and yet it
keeps New York from being a
comfortable place to live. I call
this missing quality integrity —
the Big I.
One theory of human de
velopment suggests that the pur
pose of forming a citv is to create
a whole greater than the sum of
the individual parts. Just as a
completed jigsaw puzzle integ
rates hundreds of separate pieces
into a single image, so should a
city possess a synergy that com
bines its parts into a vibrant and
constructive unit. New York cer-

tainly has all the parts, but the
pieces just aren't integrated very
well.
Pooh, pooh, you may say.
Every big city's somewhat
dangerous, and every town
(large or small) can seem un
friendly to an outsider. Why pick
on New York? I can only reply
that in my travels throughout the
United States and Europe, I
simply felt the lack of integrity
and trust more intensely in New
York than anywhere else.
People do not take responsi
bility for helping others in New
York; they're not able to help
themselves nearly enough.
People there are more interested
in getting somewhere, or in get
ting ahead than in making the
world a better place in which to
live. You only have to watch lit
erally thousands of people pass
by a blind old man asking for
loose change once to know that
New York is not supportive —
it's cutthroat. The old man cried,
and I felt disgusted.
Even casual or summer vis
itors learn quickly not to look
people in the eye as they walk

down the street. That might in
vite a solicitation or a personal
confrontation with another
human being.
There's always a feeling that
you might he getting ripped off in
New York. Having paid $4.95
for some suntan oil being sold for
$2.75 around the corner (not on
sale in either place), I know why
this fear persists. People simply
want what othehs have, or have
to offer.
vYet perhaps I am being a bit
harsh. I'm not saying that New
Yorkers are necessarily to

blame, but if you constantly
heard stories about muggings
and people pushed in front of
subway trains, you might get a
third lock on your front door and
be watchful of your fellow man
as well. Perhaps there are just
too many people.
Some of the most sensitive, ar
tistic and intelligent people 1
know dwell in New York, and
they are no less wonderful for
living there. To the person, how
ever, they admit to a loss of per
sonal freedom and space, and
acknowledge that New York af
fects their outlook on themselves
and others as well.
In a sense, the loss of congres
sional seats is a blessing for New
York. With fewer people, there
may be fewer pressures and
flaws, and integrity may have a
chance to grow. In the long run,
the fact that New York is losing
political power is a victory for the
humanity of the place.
