## Human rights violated in Guatamala 
### 
It may he a mountainous task
to arouse United States public
opinion about Guatemala. With
the happenings in the Middle
East. Iran anil Afghanistan, the
attention of the world is trans
fixed on that part of the globe.
Yet, it is an organization like
Amnesty International (Al)that
reminds the world that oppres
sion. torture and gross \ iolations
of human rights are an everyday
occurrence. If there is indeed a
link that joins the world it is not
Coca-Cola but a much grimmer
one; torture and oppression.
Only a handful of countries get a
clean bill of health, a gruesome
reminder that torture is an ines
capable part of the world politi
cal process.
A I. founded in 1961, by British
lawyer Peter Benenson. has es
tablished itself as the premier
human rights organization in the
world. With a membership of
o\er 150,000, in 78 countries, it
has grown substantially since its
inception. A group of 100 re
searchers, headquartered in
London, unearths human rights
abuses.
When a pattern of violations
appears in a country, the resear
chers investigate reports of wit
nesses, victims and expatriates

and attempt to visit the country
involved. Their findings are pub
lished in reports to the world
community. A meticulous*effort
to disassociate the organization
from political movements has
enormously raised its credibility.
Until last year the various AI
chapters "adopted" prisoners of
conscience. Massive letter cam
paigns directed at both the pris
oner's government and opinion
makers in the host country aimed
at improving the prisoner's
chances in life.
Stanford has its own chapter
that meets every other Monday
evening at Bechtel International
Center. This year the group has
been labeled an Emergency Ac
tion Group by AI. It undertakes
various urgent cases that merit
immediate action. In addition,
the chapter has been assigned
the case of Guatemala.
The Central American coun
try, recently in the headlines with
the storming of the Spanish Em
bassy, has been involved in gross
violations of human rights. A
"banana republic" par excel
lence, Guatemala still has strong
connections to U.S. corpora
tions, though their role in the
country's current political situa
tion has been subtle.

Corporate reticence was not
the norm in 1953 when the Cent
ral Intelligence Agency along
\wi.th United Fruit Co. and Pacific
•Gas and Electric decided that the
democratically elected Pres.
Jacobo Arbenez's policies ol
land reforms and hydroelectric
power did not suit the corpora
tions' interests. In a classic
banana republic coup they instal
led the first in a long series of
rightist military dictators.
Following 12 years of
military rule, an insurrection,
started in the rural areas of the
country. Heavy-handed repres
sion was then established by the
government, aided by paralegal
vigilante groups. Guatemalan
journalists estimate that since
1966 over 20,000 people have
perished at the hands of these
death squads with the complete
tolerance if not support of the
government.
Major unrest is a way of life in
Guatemala with the government
security forces resorting to brutal
measures. There is no effort to
conceal the suppressive mea
sures any more. In May 1978. in
the notorious "Panzos Mas

sacre" government forces killed
100 Kekehi Indians in a dispute
involving land ownership. Only a
tew weeks ago, Guatemalan
police stormed the embassy of
Spain, over the ambassador's
vehement protestations, killing
tens of Indians who sought a
venue to air their grievances.
It is doubtful that there is a
country with grosser human
rights violations than Guatemala
today. Yet, the U.S. Congress
in the resurgence of American
worldwide "resolve" is debating
new military and economicaid to
the regime. It appears that the
experience of Nicaragua does
not move the U.S. legislators.
It is ironic, but not without
significance that many of Somo
/a's men have found refuge in
Ciuatemala, where along with
the sizeable Nazi expatriate
community they have become
the staunchest supporters of the
Guatemalan regime.

London, unearths human rights
abuses.
When a pattern of violations
appears in a country, the resear

from political movements has
enormously raised its credibility.
Until last year the various AI
chapters "adopted" prisoners of
conscience. Massive letter cam
paigns directed at both the pris

makers in the host country aimed
at improving the prisoner's
chances in life.
Stanford has its own chapter
that meets every other Monday
evening at Bechtel International
Center. This year the group has
been labeled an Emergency Ac

various urgent cases that merit
immediate action. In addition,
the chapter has been assigned
the case of Guatemala.
The Central American coun
try, recently in the headlines with
the storming of the Spanish Em
bassy, has been involved in gross
violations of human rights. A
"banana republic" par excel
lence, Guatemala still has strong
connections to U.S. corpora
tions, though their role in the
country's current political situa
tion has been subtle.

Corporate reticence was not
the norm in 1953 when the Cent
ral Intelligence Agency along
\wi.th United Fruit Co. and Pacific
•Gas and Electric decided that the
democratically elected Pres.
Jacobo Arbenez's policies ol
land reforms and hydroelectric
power did not suit the corpora
tions' interests. In a classic
banana republic coup they instal
led the first in a long series of
rightist military dictators.
Following 12 years of
military rule, an insurrection,
started in the rural areas of the
country. Heavy-handed repres
sion was then established by the
government, aided by paralegal
vigilante groups. Guatemalan
journalists estimate that since
1966 over 20,000 people have
perished at the hands of these
death squads with the complete
tolerance if not support of the
government.
Major unrest is a way of life in
Guatemala with the government
security forces resorting to brutal
measures. There is no effort to
conceal the suppressive mea
sures any more. In May 1978. in
the notorious "Panzos Mas

sacre" government forces killed
100 Kekehi Indians in a dispute
involving land ownership. Only a
tew weeks ago, Guatemalan
police stormed the embassy of
Spain, over the ambassador's
vehement protestations, killing
tens of Indians who sought a
venue to air their grievances.
It is doubtful that there is a
country with grosser human
rights violations than Guatemala
today. Yet, the U.S. Congress
in the resurgence of American
worldwide "resolve" is debating
new military and economicaid to
the regime. It appears that the
experience of Nicaragua does
not move the U.S. legislators.
It is ironic, but not without
significance that many of Somo
/a's men have found refuge in
Ciuatemala, where along with
the sizeable Nazi expatriate
community they have become
the staunchest supporters of the
Guatemalan regime.

It may he a mountainous task
to arouse United States public
opinion about Guatemala. With
the happenings in the Middle
East. Iran anil Afghanistan, the
attention of the world is trans
fixed on that part of the globe.
Yet, it is an organization like
Amnesty International (Al)that
reminds the world that oppres
sion. torture and gross \ iolations
of human rights are an everyday
occurrence. If there is indeed a
link that joins the world it is not
Coca-Cola but a much grimmer
one; torture and oppression.
Only a handful of countries get a
clean bill of health, a gruesome
reminder that torture is an ines
capable part of the world politi
cal process.
