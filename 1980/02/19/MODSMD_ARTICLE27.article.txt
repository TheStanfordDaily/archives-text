Posters troubling
The poster announcing the
events of the upcoming Wo
men's Week cannot help hut
perplex any would-he feminist.
Those of us seeking to redefine
the boundaries of womanhood
are dismayed by the uncanny
similarity of this poster — with
its erotic silhouettes, breasts up
right. suggestively unfurled in an
embrace of a prominent and
luminous tree-trunk, (a scene
that evokes somewhat inevitably
the phallic cults of yore) — to the
tantalizing illustrations charac
teristicof such anti-feminist pub
lications as Penthouse and
Playboy. That women should
remain dark mysterious spread
eagled presences during Wo
men's Week in particular is in
deed troubling.

Meeting one-sided
It was our belief and hope that
the Town Meeting sponsored by

the ASSU Senate. Council of
Presidents, and Speakers Bureau
was an attempt to educate the
Stanford Community by present
ing both sides of the registration
and draft issue. Unfortunately,
none of the seven speakers took
a strong stance in support of re
gistration and certainly all
speakers came across as oppos
ing the draft in the present situa
tion.
There are three possible
reasons for this one-sidedness:
1) the entire population of Stan
ford opposes registration; 2)
those in support of registration
are unwilling to speak out; and
3) those supporting registration
were not contacted. Whatever
the case, the fact is that the Town
Meeting failed to present both
sides of what we feel is an impor
tant and controversial issue.
