# The
						Stanford Daily yearly financial statement
## 
### 
The Daily is also easier to find now than in the past.
We now deliver newspapers to 140 locations on cam
pus. We are also doing our best to see that each day's
issue is on the streets by 8 a.m.
Our resources are limited, but the Daily will always
be looking for something new to tackle. We plan to
conduct a campus readership survey this spring in
order to better assess what you would like to see in the
Daily. Our efforts are of much less consequence if
we're not giving you what you'd like to read.
Furthermore, the Daily is accepting increased finan
cial obligations as it matures as an independent, yet
integral part of the University community. The Daily is
negotiating a revised lease for its facilities in the Storke
Publications Building, under which we will undertake
responsibility for a far greater portion of the building's
maintenance. Under the agreement, the Daily would
not only be responsible for its own utilities; phones and
improvements, as is currently the case, but would as
sume responsibility for maintenance and replacement
of ceilings, floors and other interior fixtures. This ag
reement will place demands on the Daily which will
certainly exceed $30,000 over the next five to seven
years.
Finally, the Daily has drawn up specifications and is
seeking bids for a computer typesetting and editing
system for its editorial operations. The Daily's nine
member Board of Directors will make the final deci
sion this spring concerning the proposed purchase of
such a system. We have been working closely with a
consultant formerly with Gannett newspapers to more
precisely determine our needs and requirements for
such a system. A purhase of this kind will undoubtedly
carry a price tag in excess of $100,000 initially, with
substantial maintenance and possible expansionary
expenses to follow for several years.
Our very consideration of a purchase of this kind
exemplifies the various priorities of a university news
paper serving a multitude of functions. Keeping in
mind our important role as a basic provider of informa
tion to a large, diverse and somewhat isolated campus

As we did last year at this time, The Stanford Daily
would like to inform the community we serve of our
present financial status. As the figures below indicate,
the Daily has realized a surplus in each of the last four
years. At this time, the corporation has an accumulated
surplus of approximately $175,000. This includes re
serve funds of roughly one-third of our yearly operat
ing expenses — a figure the University administration
encourages the Daily to maintain in order to ensure the
continued financial stability of the newspaper.
The Daily nearly experienced bankruptcy in the
early 70s, shortly alter we gained our independence
from the University. That experience was not unique.
The Daily Californian, the independent newspaper at
UC-Berkeley, has recently experienced serious finan
cial difficulties which have forced it to publish smaller
issues with a higher percentage of advertisements. That
newspaper has also asked the community for bailout
funds to help it through its crisis.
Such financial instability is ol real and measurable
harm to a community. At present. The Stanford Daily
is able to publish a newspaper with a relatively low
percentage ot advertising. If the news warrants, we can
publish larger issues to give you the information you'd
like to see in the Daily.
About $45,000 of the Daily's yearly revenues each
year come from student fee assessments and a $14,000
annual tacutly/staff subscription. In our best years,
these revenues have been the difference between our
running in the black and breaking even. These monies
have enabled the Daily to attain its present financial
security and to improve its services.
I he Daily has strived to give its readers more of what
they want to read. A daily World News page, a second
national wire service and more space for sports, enter
tainment and other news has allowed us to tell you
more of what is going on in Sacramento, Washington,
D.C., New York and Moscow. The Daily is growing, as
well. The average number of pages published daily has
jumped to more than 1 1 this year, the highest number
ever for the Daily.

community, a major goal of the Daily is to provide
interested students with a laboratory for learning jour
nalistic skills. There is nowhere else at the University to
learn what can be taught actually writing for and edit
ing a daily newspaper.
We are committed to give students the training and
experience necessary to prepare them for a career in
journalism. We could continue to publish a newspaper
without the purchase ol an expensive computer system
tor reporters and editors, but in forgoing the considera
tion of such a purchase, we would be forsaking our
function as a teacher of the skills journalists need to
succeed in today s electronic newsrooms.
I he Daily has traditionally been very successful in
providing the outside world with experienced jour
nalists ready and able to step in and do a professional
job. We must continually keep up with advances in the
field to continue to graduate talented and experienced
journalists into a tight journalism job market.
I he Daily's Board of Directors, which governs the

policies of the corporation, is drawn from a cross sec
tion of the community, with an emphasis toward per
sons with knowledge beneficial to an independent cor
poration. The nine directors include four Daily staff
members, including the Editor, Business Manager,
Advertising Manager and a representative elected by
the editorial staff, as well as five persons from outside
the Daily. These five directors include an attorney, a
business executive, a journalist, a professor here and a
student, from any school of the University, who is
unaffiliated with the Daily.
We are proud of our financial strength and of the
management which has achieved that strength. A sec
ure base will enable us to look to the future, confident
that you would like a campus newspaper intent on
improving all of its services to the community.

Fiscal year change in 1977 creates overstatement of '77 income by approximately $10,000, which is exactly offset by understatement of net
income in '76.
