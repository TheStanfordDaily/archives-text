WASHINGTON â€” The De
partment of Commerce is inves
tigating more than a do/en eases
in which high-technology U.S.
equipment related to computers,
lasers and transistors was di
verted illegally to the Soviet
Union and other Communist na
tions.
In a secret document obtained
by the Los Angeles Times, inves
tigators tor the Department of
Commerce alleged that U.S.
companies connived, directly or
indirectly, in exporting equip
ment to the Soviet Union that
had military value.
The document, a partial com
pilation of cases pending through
1979, referred to "dummy
firms," to items "hand-carried"
abroad without the required ex
port licenses, and to shipments
made despite the shippers'
"knowing the intended illegal
destination."
Other Department of Com
merce officials, while refusing to
comment on the document for
the pending investigations, said
that in some cases where equip
ment of military value has
reached the So\iet Union, the
U.S. manufacturers had no
knowledge of, or role in. the il-
Fegal diversion of the material.
Homer E. Moyer Jr.. general
counsel of the department, de
scribed the document as "more
of an investigative assessment
than a judgment" of the various
individual cases.
Mounting problem
Nonetheless, the document
underscored the seriousness of a
problem that has become in
creasingly important since the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and President Jimmy Carter's re
sponse to stop exporting to the
Soviets the high-technology
items that require a special, or
"validated." license.
Of the 10 companies iden
tified in the document who were
approached for comment on the
allegations, some said they had
paid the penalties for diversion
of the equipment and that their
cases should now be considered
closed.
Of the others, one firm had
gone bankrupt, two had merged
with each other, officials of two
other companies said they were
innocent and cooperating fully
with the government investiga
tion, and the rest refused to
comment.
Senate hearings
A Senate Armed Services sub
committee earlier this month
heard testimony on licensing
procedures and policies from of
ficials in both the Departments
of Commerce and Defense, and
the Senate permanent investiga
tions subcommittee is scheduled
to hold similar hearings begin
ning tomorrow.

The Department of Com
merce document originated in
the department's compliance di
vision of the Export Administra
tion and was signed by its direc
tor, Sharon Connelly. Moyer
said it was compiled recently, but
he refused to give a date.
Perhaps the most striking inci
dent involved two Northern
California companies that have
now merged and three officers
who pleaded guilty last October
to violating the Export Control
Act for diverting semi-conductor
equipment worth $300,000 to

the Soviet Union.
Both incidents occurred in
1975 and in both, the Depart
ment of Commerce document
said, "the equipment was ship
ped to dummy firms in Canada
and re-exported to Switzer
land," for eventual receipt by the
Soviet Technopromimport
(technical imports) organization
in Moscow.
The three who pleaded guilty
were Gerald M. Starek, presi
dent of 1.1. Industries. Inc., of
Sunnyvale, Carl E. Storey, the
company's vice-president for

sales, and Robert C. Johnson,
president of Kasper Instruments
of Mountain View. The two
companies have since merged
into Kasper Instruments.
The men were each given sus
pended five-year prison terms
and fined $25,(K)() hy a federal
district court judge in San Fran
cisco.
A third seemingly resolved
case, according to the document,
involved $N()(),()()() worth of
computer components supplied
hy the Information Magnetics
Corp., of Goleta, Calif.
