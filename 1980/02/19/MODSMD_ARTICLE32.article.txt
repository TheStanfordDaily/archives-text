## The
						rainy side of water polo 
### 
Speaking as someone who had never seen an international
water polo tournament before this weekend. I was at tirst very
surprised to find out what one was like.
I understand Saturday's exhibition, the NorCal Cup at de-
Guerre Pool, was tar from an ordinary water polo gathering,
though. 1 had heard the game was played in the warm glow ot
the California sun. always. Well, whoever told me that was
wrong. It as raining Saturday. It was an off-and-on kind ot rain,
but there was never any doubt in my mind that it would stay wet
and eold and windy.
And where were all the sunbathing, sunlov ing. sunworship
ping people â€” the true water polo watchers? Oh. they were
there all right. They were just difficult to recognize under their
panchos. umbrellas and plastic clothes. Surprisingly, there w.is
a pretty good sized crowd on hand to watch the competition.
For the first match, the United States "B" team against
Mexico, there were about 45 to 50 spectators on hand. No
kidding. In the pouring rain.
And, with the exception ot three very obvious Mexico fans
("iino . . . dos . . . tres . . . Mexico, Mexico. Mexico . . . Rah.
Rah. Rah"), the spectators got what they paid for. The U.S.
"B"s. buoyed largely by the play of Stanford stars Jody
Campbell. Jamie Bergeson. Randy kalbus and John Cansel.
easily swam past Mexico N-3.
The U.S. team dominated play for the entire match. Down
2-5 at halftime. the Mexicans began the second period by
tr\ing in vain to secure themselves at least another goal or two
before it was too late. Shots sprayed all o\er the U.S. goal but
none would go in.
With each shot, the Mexico fans shouted reassuring praises
to their beloved team. Thencame the coke cans. Atsome point
in the game the fans tilled some vacant soft drink cans with
small pebbles or loose change. Then, as their team drew near a
score, or took one of its many shots, they would rattle their
cans, disturbing nearly everyone within reasonable distance.
Late in the third quarter, with the U.S. ahead 7-2. Mexico
had its finest fast break, speeding past the Americans and
taking what appeared to be a sure shot on the goal. But Gansel.
the U.S. goalie, countered with his best save of the game, deftly
tipping the ball over the boundary marker.
The fourth quarter saw only two goals, one from each team,
to leave the final score at 8-3.
The rain was really coming down by this time. The pitiable
ESPN cable TV men hurried around in their not-entirely
unlike-Devo yellow rain slickers. They were prepared tor the
next match. Italy versus Cuba, which was to be shown on
television. Their cameras, wrapped tightly with garbage bags
and tape, drew unusual reactions from the thinning crowd.
"They look like those "pods' from Invasion of the Body
Snatchers." someone near me remarked. Why not? 1 thought
they looked like body bags. You have to do something to
entertain yourself between water polo games in the pouring
rain, you know.
When ESPN's cameras were tinally all in place, and its
announcers were situated inside a makeshift rain hut. the sec
ond game began. Cuba and Italy, both quick, hardthrowing
teams, battled to a 6-6 tie.
The Cuban team, it seemed, had borrowed their warm-up
suits from the Cuban boxing team. They all wore long, hooded,
blue robes, the kind "Rocky" might wear, only nicer. The
Italians, on the other hand, were dressed in short robes, the
type you might expect Hugh Hefner to wear. In any case, they
both played very good water polo, regardless of what they
looked like.
In Saturday's tmal game, the United States "A" team beat
Canada 5-3. The "A" team includes former Stanford players
Chris Dorst. Drew McDonald and Doug Burke.
On Sunday, the tournament moved to nearby Diablo Valley
College. There the U.S. "A"s downed Cuba 1 1-6. the U.S.
"B"s surprised Italy with a 4-4 tie.and Canada defeated
Mexico 7-5.
