Bellon pivots to the right,
feigns the underhand shot and
maneuvers around the defender
to score and draw the foul. With a
minute left to phy, Helton hanks it
in from underneath to put Stan
ford ahead 72-70 and attracts a
foul in the process. The time
Winds down to 16 seconds left.
Helton intercepts the in-hounds
pass, gets hit by the defender for
the foul, and sinks the one-und
one free throws to give Stan lord a
three-point lead and, ultimately,
the victory that lifts the Cardinals
out of the Pac-10 cellar.
It would be inaccurate to say
that Kimberly Belton was
single-handedly responsible for
Stanford's 75-74 victory against
I C-Bcrkeley Saturday night,
hut the temptation to accord him
that honor is certainly strong.
During the 3N minutes he
played, the senior forward con
tributed a game high 27 points to

the Stanford effort, sinking nine
of 13 field goals and nine of 10
free throws.
When he wasn't scoring, Bel
ton was busy bringing down re
bounds (11 m all) and rejecting
shots (three for the night). " Bel
ton was absolutely awesome."
noted head coach Dick Dißiaso.
"There's no question that Kim
was up for the game."
With the victory Stanford
snapped its tie with Cal for last
place in the Pac-10. improving
its slate to 3-1 1 in the conference
and 5-17 overall. The Bears re
cord falls to 6-16 overall and
2-12 in the Pac-10. giving them
sole possession of last place.
The lead changed hands 11
times during the game and was
tied the same number. With 7:27
left to play Stanford had forged
ahead by nine points. 65-56.0n a
steal and lay-up by Belton. At
this point it seemed that the
Cards were in control, hut the
lead soon dwindled.
After Cal's Phil Wilhite
swished a 13 footer from the
baseline, the Bears tightened
their press, not giving the Cards

any leeway on the throw-in. Cal
got a turnover when, in despera
tion. Bolton crossed the endline
because no one was open. Dur
ing the next minute of play the
Bears scored six unanswered
points, four of which were free
throws. Cardinal guard Doug
Marty finally scored oh a tur
naround juniper with 5:45 left to
end the Stanford drought.
I he Bears continued to get the
most from their press. Marty was
called for double dribbling after
fighting for the ball in the
backcourt. Cal guard Mike
Chavez gunned a 24 footer to put
the Bears ahed hS-h7 at the 2:33
mark. Terry Smith scored a
lay-up for the Cards and Cal's
Walt Gillespie sank two free
throws to give Cal the lead 70-69
with 2:11 remaining. This is
where Belton especially made
his presence felt.
On a turnaround field goal at
tempt. Belton got hit in the face
by Wilhite. He made the first

foul shot, and after forward
Brian Welch rebounded the next
miss. Helton banked home
another basket. The Bears'
6-foot-1 1 Michael Pitts banked a
10-foot shot to close the score to
73-72.
Cal again pressed tightly on
the in-bounds play. With 25 sec
onds left Marty threw the ball to
center Tom Schmalzried, who.
with his back to the ball, was
dashing upeourt. Cal was to get
another chance to take the lead
as the pass went out of bounds.
Belton stole Cal's in-bounds
pass, was fouled, and made the
two free throws to cap Stanford
scoring for the night. Gillespie
hit a shot from the baseline with
two seconds left to end the name
75-74.
Stanford played consistently
most of the night and had an
especially fine first half. On of
fense. the Cards were succcessful
in threading the ball inside
against the Bears" man-to-man
defense. Marty and senior guard
Doug Barnes met with success
for the most part in fighting a
fullcourt press. The sore spots

for the Cards were turnovers and
offensive rebounding. Stanford
coughed the ball up IS times to
Cal's four turno\ ers, while bring
ing down only five offensive re
bounds to Cal's 2 I.
Defensively the team proved it
could play an effective zone and
forced the Bears to shoot from
the outside many times (13 out
of Cal's 29 field goals came from
I 5 feet or more). Like the Bears,
Stanford applied a fullcourt
press the whole game, falling
back into a zone. The Cardinals
played an especially clean first
half, not giving Cal any foul

shooting opportunities.
Belton seemed to have had
extra motivation for this game.
The week prior to the game he
watched films of the Cal game
played here on Jan. 19, listening
to the announcers praise True
for his containment of Belton. " 1
was looking forward to it (the
game), it gives extra incentive to
play well. I didn't have such i>
good game in Maples, this game I
really wanted to prove myself."
In addition to Belton,
Schmal/ried and Smith enjoyed
notable games. "One key (to the
victory) was Schmal/ried and
Smith coming oft the bench,"
commented Dißiaso. Schmal
/ried, a 6-1 1 senior, collected six
points and blocked two shots.
Smith added 13 points, making
seven of seven from the free
throw line. He was the only Card
besides Belton to score in double
figures.
The Bears had four players
scoring in double digits for the
night. Senior forward DougTrue
led the team with 16 points, fol
lowed by freshmen Michael
Chavez and Michael I'itts who
collected 14 each. Phil Wilhite, a
5-9 senior guard, ended the night
with 1 2 points.
After the game Dißiaso
pointed out that Belton wasn't in
his assigned position when he in
tercepted the throw-in. but it
didn't seem to bother himn.

"Sometimes it takes a great
player to take the game out of
the coach's hands." remarked
the coach.
As for the curent winning
trend, the mentor pointed out,
"We've always been a team
that's played well throughout the
season, but an increase in confi
dence and defense is making the
difference."

Brian Welch rebounded the next
miss. Helton banked home
another basket. The Bears'
6-foot-1 1 Michael Pitts banked a
10-foot shot to close the score to
73-72.
Cal again pressed tightly on
the in-bounds play. With 25 sec
onds left Marty threw the ball to
center Tom Schmalzried, who.
with his back to the ball, was
dashing upeourt. Cal was to get
another chance to take the lead
as the pass went out of bounds.
Belton stole Cal's in-bounds
pass, was fouled, and made the
two free throws to cap Stanford
scoring for the night. Gillespie
hit a shot from the baseline with
two seconds left to end the name
75-74.
Stanford played consistently
most of the night and had an
especially fine first half. On of
fense. the Cards were succcessful
in threading the ball inside
against the Bears" man-to-man
defense. Marty and senior guard
Doug Barnes met with success
for the most part in fighting a
fullcourt press. The sore spots

for the Cards were turnovers and
offensive rebounding. Stanford
coughed the ball up IS times to
Cal's four turno\ ers, while bring
ing down only five offensive re
bounds to Cal's 2 I.
Defensively the team proved it
could play an effective zone and
forced the Bears to shoot from
the outside many times (13 out
of Cal's 29 field goals came from
I 5 feet or more). Like the Bears,
Stanford applied a fullcourt
press the whole game, falling
back into a zone. The Cardinals
played an especially clean first
half, not giving Cal any foul

shooting opportunities.
Belton seemed to have had
extra motivation for this game.
The week prior to the game he
watched films of the Cal game
played here on Jan. 19, listening
to the announcers praise True
for his containment of Belton. " 1
was looking forward to it (the
game), it gives extra incentive to
play well. I didn't have such i>
good game in Maples, this game I
really wanted to prove myself."
In addition to Belton,
Schmal/ried and Smith enjoyed
notable games. "One key (to the
victory) was Schmal/ried and
Smith coming oft the bench,"
commented Dißiaso. Schmal
/ried, a 6-1 1 senior, collected six
points and blocked two shots.
Smith added 13 points, making
seven of seven from the free
throw line. He was the only Card
besides Belton to score in double
figures.
The Bears had four players
scoring in double digits for the
night. Senior forward DougTrue
led the team with 16 points, fol
lowed by freshmen Michael
Chavez and Michael I'itts who
collected 14 each. Phil Wilhite, a
5-9 senior guard, ended the night
with 1 2 points.
After the game Dißiaso
pointed out that Belton wasn't in
his assigned position when he in
tercepted the throw-in. but it
didn't seem to bother himn.

"Sometimes it takes a great
player to take the game out of
the coach's hands." remarked
the coach.
As for the curent winning
trend, the mentor pointed out,
"We've always been a team
that's played well throughout the
season, but an increase in confi
dence and defense is making the
difference."
