### Richard Martinez Sports Editor 
Alter losing to the University
ol Pacific Tuesday night. 71-(is.
the Stanford women's basketball
team approachcd Saturday even
ing's contcst against San Jose
State with a "nothing to lose"
attitude. And. like the men's
team during their recent rejuve
nation. this frame ol mind helped
the Cardinals to down the I ady
Spartans tor the lust time in
three years ol Northern Califor
nia Athletic League competi
tion. 66-59.
Stanford, whose conference
record had dropped to 5-4 fol
lowing its uninspired perfor
mance against UOP. had two op
tions according to coach Dotty
McCrea. "We could lay down
and die or get up and finish the
season." The Cards did the latter
and. said McCrea. " This \ ictory
made our season."
Although not quite as long
lived. San Jose State's dynasty
was to the NorCal Conference as

was UCLA s to the I'acilic-Id.
I lie Lady Spartans did not lose
one league game during the first
two seasons of the conference.
Accruing 27 straight victories
over the span ol three years. San
Jose looked to be the reigning
league champion for some time
to come.
I lie rapid progress ol women's
basketball has been remarkable,
however, and the unbeatable
Lady Spartans now possess a
very vincible 6-3 league record,
losing also to undefeated Uni
versity ol San I rancisco and
llC'-Uerkeley.
"()ur attitude against San Jose
was comparable to UOP's at
titude against us." said Jeanne
Ruark. I hey (San Jose) just
didn t want to win as much as we
did.
I ve seen the league improv
ing for quite some time so it re
ally doesn't surprise me to see
San Jose start getting knocked
off."
A hungry and confident Stan

lord squad came out "like horses
out ol the gate." according to
Angie Paceione. II anything, the
team was too anxious, resulting
in some early turnovers.
Midway through the lust hall.
McCrea gave Paceione the nod
for entering the game, l or the
first time in four games she en
tered the contest with a chance to
contribute to a victory. I'lic
crowd responded wildly and so
did Paceione.
"It was so nice to have her
back in the game." stressed
Ruark. "Angie does so much
more for the team when she's out
there besides running up statis
tics."
Stanford began taking advan
tage of its positive factors: good
team confidence, a nothing-to
lose situation, and a star player
on the court instead ol the bench.
Although the game was defen
sively oriented. Stanford's dis
ciplined and deliberate offense
was the key to the outcome of the
game.
"We totally wore them down
on defense." said Paceione.
"They usually come and play
super defense for the first I 0 mi
nutes. build up a lead, and then
coast home. Our offense forced
them to play tough the entire
game and it wore them out."
The first half, however, was
dominated by impenetrable de
fenses as the Stanford 27. SJS 24
halltime score indicated. Both
ol lenses seemed to be stifled as
Stanford shot a poor 42 percent
from the floor and San Jose hit
on only 3N percent. Ruark mis
sed all six field goal attempts and
San Jose's sharp-shooting Karen
Mason connected on one ol nine
shots.
The Cardinals. Ruark espe
cially. started the second halt
impressively. The sophomore
forward had 10 points after the
first si\ minutes ol the final
period. Not only did she convert
two three-point plays, she
helped San Jose's star center.
Elinor Banks, leave the game
with four fouls.
Stanford extended its 43-34
lead with 13:44 to play to a
55-44 lead with 7:30 minutes
left.
With 5:30 to go. the 6-foot-3
Lady Spartan center entered the
game and cut the Cards' lead to
57-51 with two quick baskets.
Stanford turnovers enabled
San Jose to cut the lead to 61 -57
with 2:25 to play. Paecione then
made her one-and-one attempts
to extend the lead to six.

Banks made it 63-59 by scor
ing the last San Jose points ol the
evening. Stanford added three
more points to cushion the lead
before the final bu//er sounded.
Ruark hit all seven ol her
second-hall lield goal attempts
to lead the Cards with 22 points.
She also contributed I 1 re
bounds and live assists.
Louise Smith had 14 points
and Paccione tallied 12 points
and eight rebounds in her return
to extended action. I lie l.adv
Spartans were led by Banks and
Debbie Johnson who had I 6 and
14 points, respectively.
Stanford is now tied with Cal
for third place. LSI leads the
league with its'unbeaten record,
followed by San Jose with three
losses.
I he Cards travel to Lresno
State this Thursday evening.
Their final home games will be
against University of Nevada at
Reno and USI I'lic women have
a pertect 10-0 home record this
season. In order to qualify for the
Western Regional Tournament
or the National Invitational
Tournament. Stanford must win
all of its remuininu contests.
