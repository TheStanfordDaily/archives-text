In tact, "we had 11\e out ot si\
swimmers in the final heat most
times." Thomas added. "It
makes it sort ot like a workout.
It's hard to get up for that."
Yet. considering the lack of
competition and the inclement
weather, "we did very well."
Thomas concluded.
Former Olympian Linda
Jezek continued to lead the Cards
in winning ti\e events: the 50.
100 and 200 yard backstrokes

streak ot good times with her
best e\er in the 200 back

the 50 fly honors in 26.8.
The tide turned on the men. as
they lost consecutive dual meets
to USC. 77-55. and to UCLA.
69-44 Friday and Saturday re
spectively. Although well
prepared. the Cards were unable
to topple the two national
kingpins on their deluged home
turf.
"1 just couldn't believe how
adverse the conditions were,"
said assistant coach Stu Corliss ot
the Cards' trip. "Everyone was
in the lockerroom between
events. No one even saw Ins
teammates swim."
Nonetheless, credible perfor
mances were given. Mike An

Patty Spees won the 50 and 200 meter breaststroke events in the NorCal championships held
at Berkeley Saturday. The Cardinal women clearly dominated the meet.
Battling blustery weather
conditions as much as their op
ponents. the Stanford women's
swimming team mastered the
NorCal Conference champion
ships held at Berkeley Saturday
and Sunday. Meanwhile, swim
ming in a stormy Southern
California, the men succumbed
to the might of UCLA and USC.
"We were pretty domineer
ing." said women's coach
Claudia Thomas ot her team's
easy \ ictory. The Cards amassed
a grand total of 1253 points to
Cal's N75. UOP's 426. Fresno
State's 346 and San Jose State's
372.
In tact, "we had 11\e out ot si\
swimmers in the final heat most
times." Thomas added. "It
makes it sort ot like a workout.
It's hard to get up for that."
Yet. considering the lack of
competition and the inclement
weather, "we did very well."
Thomas concluded.
