LAKE PLACID, N Y. — The
world's greatest skier. Ingemar
Stenmark, sJipped more than
usual near the bottom of the
mountain yesterday, but stayed
in line position to win the men's
giant slalom at the Winter
Olympics.
Three-times world champion
and unbeaten in his last 14 giant
slaloms, Stenmark finished the
first run of the two-day event
thirty-two hundredths of a sec
ond behind the leader, Andreas
Wen/el. who could bring tiny
Liechtenstein great glory bv dup
licating yesterday's perfor
mance.
It was a light day by Olympic
standards, with just one final, the
women's 10-kilometer skiing
won by art East German, al
though there was a hit of interna
tional intrigue and three Ameri
can athletes among the leaders in
two uncompleted events.
Charlie Tickner of Littleton,
Col., and David Santee of Park
Ridge. 111., were second and third
respectively, after the compul
sory figures of men's figure skat
ing. An East German, Jan
Hoffman, was the leader after
the opening of the three-day
program.
Americans at Intervale were
joyous as Walter Malmquist ot
Post Mills, Vt., ended the 70-
meter jumping phase of the nor
dic combined in second place.
"Walter, Walter," the crowd
chanted as the 23-year-old
soared 84 and 80 meters and
trailed two-time Olympic
champion Ulrich Wehling of
East Germany by 5.4 points.
Wehling, who won the gold
medal in 1972 and '76. jumped
85 and 8 1 meters for 227.2
points.
In men's figure skating, the de
fending world champion, Vla
dimir Kovalev, withdrew almost
immediately after finishing fifth

in the compulsory round, offi
cially because of illness. A free
spirit by Soviet standards.
Kovalev reportedly has been
naughty of late.
"Vladimir has a very strong
tlu." said the Soviet team man
ager, Alexandr Vedenina. "He
tried to do his best and skate.
The (fifth) place is no factor."
Indeed. The leader Hoffman is
not considered a great free ska
ter. Tickner is, and so is Robin
Cousins of Great Britain, cur
rently fourth.
Most ot the crowd was drawn
to Whitetace Mountain by
Stenmark, who has not lost a
giant slalom since March 8,
1 978, in Waterville Valley, N.H.
He prefers to come from behind,
but hardly seemed satisfied after
yesterday's run.
His was the fastest of the in
termediate times, 50.97 seconds.
Hut he lost precious fractions of
seconds near the end, slipping
several times and nearly having
to break a tall with his hand at
one point.
Clearly frustrated, the stoic
Swede brushed past reporters at
the finish line, bristling: "Ques
tions. questions. Always bloody
questions."
The event will be completed
today on another course.
The anticipation today will be
focused on Stenmark. who has
dominated his sport after being
favored in the Innsbruck Games
and finishing third in the giant
slalom and falling in the slalom
there. At 23. he has won 25 of his
last 40 races.
He seems to glide where
others clearly are working quite
hard. He prefers to establish a
near-the-leader position the first
run and charge down the moun
tain the second.
"The gold medal is more im
portant to me than the World
Cup," he has said. "I have won
the World Cup three times."

champion Ulrich Wehling of
East Germany by 5.4 points.
Wehling, who won the gold
medal in 1972 and '76. jumped
85 and 8 1 meters for 227.2
points.
In men's figure skating, the de
fending world champion, Vla
dimir Kovalev, withdrew almost
immediately after finishing fifth

in the compulsory round, offi
cially because of illness. A free
spirit by Soviet standards.
Kovalev reportedly has been
naughty of late.
"Vladimir has a very strong
tlu." said the Soviet team man
ager, Alexandr Vedenina. "He
tried to do his best and skate.
The (fifth) place is no factor."
Indeed. The leader Hoffman is
not considered a great free ska
ter. Tickner is, and so is Robin
Cousins of Great Britain, cur
rently fourth.
Most ot the crowd was drawn
to Whitetace Mountain by
Stenmark, who has not lost a
giant slalom since March 8,
1 978, in Waterville Valley, N.H.
He prefers to come from behind,
but hardly seemed satisfied after
yesterday's run.
His was the fastest of the in
termediate times, 50.97 seconds.
Hut he lost precious fractions of
seconds near the end, slipping
several times and nearly having
to break a tall with his hand at
one point.
Clearly frustrated, the stoic
Swede brushed past reporters at
the finish line, bristling: "Ques
tions. questions. Always bloody
questions."
The event will be completed
today on another course.
The anticipation today will be
focused on Stenmark. who has
dominated his sport after being
favored in the Innsbruck Games
and finishing third in the giant
slalom and falling in the slalom
there. At 23. he has won 25 of his
last 40 races.
He seems to glide where
others clearly are working quite
hard. He prefers to establish a
near-the-leader position the first
run and charge down the moun
tain the second.
"The gold medal is more im
portant to me than the World
Cup," he has said. "I have won
the World Cup three times."
