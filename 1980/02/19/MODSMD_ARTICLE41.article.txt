Trudeau wins national election
TORONTO — Canadians angered over a
proposed gasoline tax called Pierre Trudeau back
to office as prime minister in national elections
yesterday and gave his Liberal Party a majority in
the House of Commons.
They turned their backs on 40-year-old Joe
■Clark and his Progressive Conservatives who had
appealed for a "fair chance" after only nine
months in office to correct economic and political
woes in the country.
With 242 of 2NI districts tabulated, the Liber
als had 146 of the 2X2 seats in the Commons, four
more than a majority. The Conservatives had 76
and the socialistic New Democratic Party had 20.
The rightist Social Credit Party, which helped
Clark form a minority in the last Parliament, had
no seats. The election lor the 2N2nd seat in the
House was deferred until March.
The Liberals were winning 47 percent of the
popular vote, the Conservatives 31 percent and
the New Democrats I S percent, according to the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.
Lor the 60-year-old Trudeau, prime minister
from April 1 968 to May 1979. this will be his
fourth term as government chief. He had said this
was his last election and that he would step down
in two or three years. He handily won re-election
to his Parliament seat in his Mount Royal district
in Montreal.
A victim of a Liberal sweep of the East was
Fabien Roy, leader of the rightist Social Credit
Party, which aligned itself with the Conservatives
in the last minority government.
New Democratic Party leader Ed Broadbent
was easily rejected in his Ontario district.
The Liberal tide against Clark's Progressive
Conservatives began in the eastern Maritime
provinces, where Trudeau's term took four
House of Commons seats that had been held by
Conservatives in Prince Edward Island and Nova
Scotia, and swept across staunchly Liberal
Quebec into all-important Ontario, which has 95
seats in the 2K2-seat House.
The party electing the most members to the
House ol Commons forms the government and
the party leader becomes prime minister.
Pre-election opinion polls pointed to a victory
by the 60-year-old Trudeau. whose Liberal gov
ernment was defeated by Clark's Conservatives
in elections last May.
Beginning in the eastern Maritime provinces,
through Quebec and Ontario, voter turnout was
generally reported moderate to heavy.
Afghans attack Soviet troops
Moslem Alghan rebels killed 200 Soviet troops
during a 10-day battle that culminated with the
rebels retaking the airport in a provincial capital
in northeastern Afghanistan, a Pakistani news
paper reported yesterday.
The Daily Jang of Karachi said the rebels suf
fered 50 killed during lighting in Faizabad. but
they also claimed to have captured 15 Soviet
troops, shot down two Soviet fighter planes, de
stroyed 1 7 tanks and lour helicopters, and seized
rifles, machine guns and ammunition.
l ighting for control of the city 195 miles
north-northeast ot the capital ol Kabul was still
going on. the newspaper said, but the rebels had
the city surrounded. Faizabad is located in
Badakhshan Province where. Western analysts
have said, rebels are providing some ot the stiffest
resistance for Afghan government and Soviet
troops.
The newspaper report could not be confirmed
independently, and the number of Soviet casual
ties appeared exaggerated.
Defense Department analysts in Washington
said the Soviet intervention force of some 90.000
men has suffered 2500 casualties, only a small
fraction of them deaths, since the first troops
were sent to Afghanistan seven weeks ago.
Whenever possible, analysts in Washington

have said, the Soviets are leav ing the fighting to
Afghan army troops.
In other developments yesterday, Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance announced he would also be
going to Rome and Paris, in addition to Bonn and
London, for consultations with U.S. allies on the
situations in Iran and Afghanistan.
The talks in France were regarded as particu
larly sensitive. Last week. France pulled out of a
Bonn meeting of Western allies, saying the Un
ited States was trying to turn it into an anti-Soviet
forum.
Vance's trip which begins in Bonn tonight will
sandwich the Feb. 20 deadline President Jimmy
Carter has set for the Soviets to withdraw their
troops from Afghanistan. If they don't — and
they show no sign of doing so — (Tarter has said
he will urge an international boycott of the 19N0-
summer Olympic Games set for Moscow.
Discussion ol further retaliatory measures was.
as expected, to figure prominently when Vance
meets with the foreign ministers of Britain, Fr
ance. Italy and Germany.
Reagan apologizes for joke
HILLSBORO. N.H. —Ronald Reagan
apologized yesterday to anyone w ho might object
to an ethnic joke he told about Poles and Italians,
but said he intended it as an example of humor he
finds in poor taste.
"No slur was intended and I apologize to any
one who was offended by it."the former Califor
nia governor and Republican presidential hope
ful told a news conference in a voice alternately
halting and rising in anger.
Asked if it would hurt his campaign with the
New Hampshire primary a week away. Reagan
replied. "It will it people try to make something
of it"and it he were unable to explain to "a
number of people . . . who don't know what my
feelings are.
"But 1 will match my stand against prejudice
and bigotry against anyone's in the country be
cause I've been at it a long time, before there was
ever a civil rights movement."
He stood in sub-freezing temperatures oiflside
an inn and said ot the initial news story about the
joke: "Frankly. I think it was a cheap shot" taken
out of context.
The joke, which Reagan told to Sen. Gordon
Humphrey. (R-N.H.). and other aides and repor
ters as their campaign bus left Keene for Milford
on Saturday, went this way:
— "How do you tell the Polish one at a
cockfight? He's the one with a duck. " '
— "How do you tell the Italian one? He's the
one who bets on the duck.
—'"How do you know the Mafia is there? The
duck wins."
Reagan said he had told the story to display the
kind ot joke he finds objectionable.
Also on Saturday, in the Chicago suburb of
Rosemont. Nancy Reagan substituted for her
husband at a campaign rally and told him in a
telephone call heard over loudspeakers by about
200 persons that she wished he could have been
there to see "all these beautiful white people."
She hesitated, her lace turned pale, and then
she added, "beautiful black and white people."
Then she changed the subject. There were no
blacks in the audience.
Alter the call, she said to State Rep. Donald
Totten. (R-Schaumburg). who is Reagan's Il
linois campaign director. "I'm sorry. I didn't
mean it."
Striking firefighters replaced
CHICAGO — Hundreds ot men recruited to
replace striking firefighters reported to work yes
terday as the city suffered its first fire death since
the start of the five-day-old walkout.
Positions on both sides ot the bitter dispute
seemed to harden. The strikers repeated their
determination to defy back-to-work court orders

and $40.000-a-day tines, and Mayor Jane Byrne
said she would never again negotiate with the
Chicago Fire Fighters Union or its president.
Frank Muscare.
In a telephone interview with a radio station,
the mayor was asked whether she planned talks
with federal mediators or union officials.
"No. 1 am not. It wouldn't make any differ
ence." Byrne said. "I will never again sit down
with Mr. Muscare. nor his men. Not again — not
ever. I will never subject anybody in the mayor's
office or the staff or the corporation counsel or
the commissionerof fire" to negotiations with the
union."
At a late-afternoon news conference. Byrne
assailed a "goon squad" of 600 of the striking
unionists for "terroristic tactics." She said the city
would ask Circuit Court Judge John Hechinger at
10 a.m. today to enforce his order to remove
pickets from tire station property. She said some
non-striking paramedics had been beaten up, and
that strikers had heckled and threatened many
other non-strikers and their families and caused
extensive vandalism.
In addition. Byrne said there were three arrests
ot striking firemen yesterday — one for threaten
ing to set a fuel truck afire, another for disorderly
conduct — but gave no. further details.
She also said more than 600 firemen were on
duty, as opposed to a normal complement of 950
men per shift, and that firemen were returning to
work "in increasing numbers."
The 3.5 million residents of the nation's
second-largest city have been dependent on
make-shift tire protection since the walkout
Thursday by most of the 4350 firefighters. They
struck after the city refused to grant them a writ
ten contract to replace handshake agreements
unless the union would agree to a no-strike
clause.
Ar. estimated 300 recruits arrived for proces
sing at the Fire Department Gymnasium, cros
sing picket lines to the jeers of striking
tiretighters. About 100 police officers stood by,
some wearing riot helmets. There was no \ iolcnce
or arrests.
Puerto Rico fraud claimed
SAN JUAN. Puerto Rico— Ben Fernandez,
the only Hispanic attempting to win the Republi
can Party nomination lor president, said yester
day he would ask the Federal Election Commis
sion to set aside the results ot the Puerto Rican
primary.
He claimed poll watchers acting in his name
were denied an opportunity to vote, that ballot
boxes were stuffed and that many voters were
told he had dropped out of the race. He said. "I
believe this to be only the tip of the iceberg. This
is what I call a Puerto Rican Watergate."
Fernandez came in fourth with less than 1 per
cent of the vote in Sunday's primary. George
Bush won with about 60 percent, Howard Baker
was second with 37 percent and John Connally
was third with only 22 votes more than Fernan
dez.
With all but eight ol the 3422 polling places
tabulated, the Republican Party in Puerto Rico
reported that Bush had 123,217 votes. Baker
N0.7X2, Connally 1934 and Fernandez 1912. As
the winner. Bush will take all island's 14 dele
gates into the national convention later this year
in Detroit. No final count is expected before next
week.
According to the GOP's tabulations, Harold
Stassen had 63 1 votes. Sen. Robert Dole of Kan
sas had 513. and Reagan 50.
Bush said he was "ecstatic" about the victory,
but said he still doesn't consider himself the
front-runner in the GOP race.
" I don't want to get expectations higher than I
can deliver, but we're doing well." he said yester
day while campaigning in New Hampshire. "I
think what Puerto Rico shows is that this is a
national candidacy."
