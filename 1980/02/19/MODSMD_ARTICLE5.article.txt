The United States and Iran have ac
cepted the membership of a commis
sion to investigate former Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and the
panel will go to Tehran in a few days,
the United Nations announced yester
day, hut there was no word on how or
when this might hring release of the
hostages held in the U.S. Embassy
there.
In Washington, State Department
officials said the diplomatic plan for
release was "on track," but with no
firm timetable. The officials, speaking
privately, said the United States prob
ably will not be certain about the fre
eing of the hostages "until we see the
whites of their eyes."
U.N. Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim was quoted by a Vienna news
paper as saying the hostages would be
released "in the course of the commis
sion's work. Otherwise one would not
have received the agreement of the two
sides."
According to Die Presse's Tuesday
edition, Waldheim said the commis
sion's report would be handed over to
him and he would forward it to the
U.N. Security Council for whatever ac
tion it saw fit.
Important step
The commission to investigate Ira
nian grievances has been considered
one of the steps that would lead to re
lease of the approximately 50 Ameri
cans who have been held hostage at the
embassy in Tehran since Nov. 4.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar.
who announced U.S. acceptance of the
members on Friday, said a Tehran offi
cial has given Waldheim Iran's accep
tance by telephone from Tehran. He
said Waldheim was awaiting telexed
confirmation before officially announc
ing the panel members' names.

The commissioners, Stajduhar told
reporters, would he meeting in Geneva
and would fly to Tehran this week.
Possibilities
Two men among Waldheim's
reported — hut still unannounced —
choices tor the commission were also
on his appointment list for meetings
Monday. They are Algeria's U.N. am
bassador, Mohamed Bedjaoui, and
Venezuela's former ambassador to
Washington, Andres Aguilar.
The others reported in line for the
commission were Adib Daoudy,
foreign policy adviser to the president
of Syria; H.W. Jayewardene, 63-
year-old lawyer brother of the presi
dent of Sri Lanka, and Edmond Louis
Pettiti. former president of the Paris
Bar Association.
Stajduhar told reporters the timing
of the hostages' release as part of a pac
kage deal had not been finalized, but
the commission's guidelines had been
completed.
Not sufficient
Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr, who indicated last week the
hostages might be freed when the
commission begins its work, was
quoted in Tehran on Sunday as saying
the inquiry would not be sufficient to
ensure their release. He also repeated
his demand for a U.S. admission of
guilt for alleged misdeeds during the
reign of the shah. The United States so
far has refused to apologize for past
U.S. actions in Iran.
Waldheim met separately with U.S.
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance and the
charge d'affaires of the Iranian U.N.
mission, Jamal Shemirani.
The Washington officials said a
major part of the Vance-Waldheim
agenda was making certain both sides
understood precisely the rules under
which the commission will conduct its
investigation of the shah's regime.

They described the commission as part
of a fragile understanding with Iran
that is supposed to lead eventually to
release of the hostages. They said
Bani-Sadr's three other requirements
do not necessarily violate the terms of
the understanding.
In addition to the investigation, and
an admission of U.S. interference in
Iran's internal affairs. Bani-Sadr says
Iran requires a pledge that the United
States will not interfere again, and will
not interfere with Iran's efforts to ex

tradite the shah and recover his for
tune.
The administration has made a con
cession to Iran by agreeing to creation
of the commission without first obtain
ing the release of the hostages.
In Switzerland, a newspaper re
ported two Iranian Air Force generals
and 10 other officers were executed
following an abortive plot last De
cember against the lives of revolutio
nary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho
meini and other leaders.
