The University's Faculty Advisory
Board must reconsider the 1972 firing
of former Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, an
appellate court ruled Friday.
The First District Court of Appeals,
affirming an earlier ruling by Santa
Clara County Superior Court Judge
John Flaherty, held that the case must
be returned to the board that recom
mended his dismissal.
Franklin, a self-proclaimed Maoist,
was accused of inciting campus follow
ers to unlawful action following several
speeches he delivered on campus in
197,1 during the peak of anti-war activ
ity.
The dismissal penalty was based on
three charges involving speeches
Franklin made at a White Plaza noon
rally, a demonstration outside the
Computation Center, and an evening
rally at the Old Union.
After reviewing the charges, the Fa
culty Advisory Board voted 5-2 for
"immediate dismissal," stating that
Franklin had "repeatedly and seriously
infringed the rights of others in the
University, and significantly increased

the risk of injury to them and to Uni
versity property."
Former Board Chairman, and cur
rent Provost, Donald Kennedy and
former Prof. Robert McAfee Brown
dissented, calling for suspension rather
than dismissal.
Franklin, an associate professor of
English, was the first tenured Stanford
professor known to he dismissed in the
last half-century. Me is now an English
professor at Rutgers University in
Newark. New Jersey.
After several years of litigation,
Judge Flaherty was asked to review the
volumes of hearing files and other ac
cumulated documents.
Flaherty last year upheld two of the
charges against Franklin, hut dismissed
the Old Union charge on the grounds
that it was free speech protected by the
First Amendment.
Flaherty also ruled that the case
should be returned to the University to
decide whether a different or the same
penalty should be invoked, now that
there are only two charges against
Franklin.
Religious Studies Prof. William
Clebsch, current chairman of the Fa
culty Advisory Board, said this is "an
extremely subtle issue that will come
before the board."
According to Clebsch, "it's not a
simple matter" of three charges mean
ing a certain penalty and two charges
meaning a lesser penalty.
"It could well be that any one of the
three charges is enough'' to justify dis
missal. he said.
The seven-member board is elected
by the Academic Council, which in
cludes all full, associate and assistant
professors. Clebsch explained. Profes
sors serve on the board for three-year
terms only.
