The Committee on Undergraduate Studies (C-US) de
cided Wednesday that a new interdisciplinary program in
public policy cannot have degree-granting status until its
courses have been taught tor at least a year.
Although the program will not be considered a full-fleged
major, a sequence ot courses will be offered beginning in
the fall which will qualify for an individually designed
major, according to Carolyn Lougee, chairman ot C-US.
"The program will be listed in Courses and Degrees and
all the core Courses will be taught next year, but as yet there
will be no bachelor's degrees given by the program, she
said.
"Since I haven't formally conveyed the reasons for our
decision to the chairman of the committee which designed
the program. I am reluctant to state the reasons tor our
decision," said Lougee. "Generally, we decided that there
were some unresolved aspects of the program which still
need to be worked out."
Both Economics Prof. Nathan Rosenberg, chairman of
the public policy program, and David Mowery, the assistant
director, were out of town and unavailable for comment.
Political Science Prof. John Manley, who will be teaching
one of the core courses in the program, favored the C-US

decision.
"It was a wise and prudent decision,'' he said. "The
decision was not unexpected. It follows the pattern of other
interdisciplinary studies here, such as the international rela
tions major."
Lougee said that every other interdisciplinary major at
the University, with the exception of human biology, began
first as a program.
Maria McCrea of the public policy program office said
that the committee will probably submit another proposal
next winter for the program to be given degree-granting
status.
"Because of the quality of the program, we expect that it
will then be given the official power to give degrees," she
said.
The program, which has been designed over the past two
years by members of various University departments, con
sists of an integrated sequence of courses from political
science, statistics, sociology and economics.
"There's a tremendous interest in public policy at the
University," said Political Science Prof. Alexander George,
who was on the organizing committee for the program.
"There is a definite need for a program like this, which is of
high quality, very demanding, and rigorous. And the need is
growing constantly."
