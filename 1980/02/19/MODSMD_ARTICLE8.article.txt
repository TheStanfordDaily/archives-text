# Teller predicts danger of energy shortage
## Depression in West, while millions will starve in Third World 
### Rob Lempert News Editor 
While a massive energy shortage
could lead to an economic depression
in the industrialized countries, it would
mean widespread starvation in the
Third World, according to Edward Tel
ler, senior research fellow at the
Hoover Institution and noted advocate
of nuclear energy.
Speaking in Annenberg Auditorium
Thursday night. Teller said that the
enormous increases in food production
brought on by the technological revolu
tion in agriculture in the last 20 years
are barely keeping pace with popula
tion growth in the Third World. But
cropsgrown with these modern agricul
tural techniques are energy intensive,
requiring mechanized irrigation and
nitrogen-based fertilizers.
Without a constantly growing supply
of energy. Teller explained, it will not
be possible to increase the productivity
of Third World agriculture fast enough
to feed growing populations.
"An energy shortage in the Third
World doesn't mean these countries
won't develop industrially," he said.
"It means they won't eat. Millions will
starve."
While Teller said the United States
can and should use less energy, he said
that the per capita use of energy has
been rising over four times as fast in the
Third World as in America. Since the

per capita use in those countries is cur
rently a small percentage of that here,
the energy increase needed for the
Third World to adequately feed its
populations could easily use up all of
the world's supply of oil, according to
Teller.
"The hunger for oil in the world is
insatiable," he said.
All methods
Teller, father of the H-bomb, said
that there is no single source of energy
that will alleviate the world shortage.
He added we will need to employ every
method at our disposal in order to les
sen the effects of the inevitable crunch.
The first step, he said, is conserva
tion. Naming the private automobile as
the major offender. Teller called for
more public transit, more use of bikes,
and closing off central city areas to cars.
Teller praised solar energy for uses
such as home heating, but he added
that it cannot be used to produce elec
tricity. Per kilowatt hour, photovoltaic
cells are five times as expensive as nuc
lear energy, he said.
Nuclear safe
Teller reiterated his claim that nuc
lear energy is safe, claiming that "not
one single person has ever been hurt in
a nuclear accident." The Three Mile
Island accident last summer cost Con
solidated Edison $1 billion, he said.
However, the escaping radiation ex
posed no more than 100 people to an

amount of radiation equal to what an
airline stewardess gets in a month from
flying closer to the sun.
To avoid future accidents. Teller
suggested that the reactor operators,
who at Three Mile Island mishandled
the situation in every possible way,
should be better trained and better
paid.
The problem of disposing the reactor
wastes has already been solved. Teller
claimed. Citing a 196K article in the
Review of Modern Physics, he recom
mended building reprocessing plants

which would extract the remaining
plutonium from old fuel to be reused as
reactor fuel. This way the plutonium
would be used up in several years, and
would not have to be stored for half a
million years until it decayed on its
own.
President Jimmy Carter decided
against reprocessing plants, Teller said,
because they can also be used to make
nuclear weapons. However, he added,
because no one else in the world has
followed our example and stopped
making these plants, it is foolish not to
use them.
Terrorism discounted
Teller discounted the possibility of
any individual or group stealing
plutonium to make a bomb. Such a
thief "would need the skills of at least
half a do/en highly trained profession
als" to make it work. However, Teller
said he fears that practically any coun
try, especially one with money, could
secretly make a bomb to employ how
ever it pleased.
Underground coal gasification is
another energy possibility that shows
great promise. Teller said. 'Hie process,
pioneered in Lenin's Russia, saves min
ing dangers and costs by gasifying coal
while it is still underground. Though
the Lawrence Livermore Labs have
been pushing the concept, the Depart
ment of Energy has yet to pay any at-


Edward teller
tention to the idea.
Foreign affairs
Teller also expressed grave concern
over the situation in the Middle East.
We depend on a good portion of our oil
imports from that part of the world, he
said, and "there has always heen the
possibility that something would go
wrong. It did."
Teller faulted the Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini for purging of all West
ern influence the crews that worked on
the Iranian oil fields. That included
many supervisors trained under Shah
Mohammed Re/e Pahlevi's regime,
Teller said, and the new oilmen are
incompetent. Not only can't they pump
out as much oil, but the Iranian fields
have geological complications which
make them easy to ruin. Teller said the
Iranians are unknowingly destroying
their oil fields.
But Tellers major concerns arethe
Russian maneuvers in the Persian Gulf
region. The So\ iet armies in Afghanis
tan are only 100 miles from the Straits
ol Hormuz, through which passes one
third of the world's oil. There are Rus
sian tanks in Yemen 100 miles away
from the other side of the straits.
"In less than a week, the Russians
can close the straigts and with their own
oil reserves, will control half the
world's oil. I'm not saying they will,"
Teller said, but the United States
doesn't have the military strength to
stop them.
World disaster
Such action would cause the biggest
depression in history. Teller warned. It
would be disastrous here, but even
worse in Europe and Japan, whose oil
imports account for more than 80 per
cent ot their energy consumption.
Teller predicted that it the Soviets
close the Straits of Hormuz, they would
not cut off oil to the West, but rather
use it as a bargaining chip. They might
trade oil lor the dissolution of the
NATO alliance and take control of
Western Europe, he said.
Many people are against nuclear
reactors. Teller said, but "I think
everyone in this room would have to
agree with me that reactors are better
than war."
