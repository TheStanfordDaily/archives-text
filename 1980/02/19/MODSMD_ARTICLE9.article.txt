## Israelis open embassy in Cairo 
### Magda El-Sanga The Associated Press 
CAIRO, Egypt — Israel
quietly opened its embassy in
Cairo yesterday, its first in an
Arab nation. The sight of the
blue and white Star of Da\ id was
greeted with some smiles, some
tears — and loud wails of mourn
ing.
A dispute o\er Jewish settle
ments in occupied lands, the
Arab boycott of the Egyptian-
Israeli peace and questions
about the speed ot the normali
zation ot relations loomed in the
background.
"I am sure that other Arab
leaders will join our peace pro
cess.' Syrian-born Israeli charge
d attaires Vosef I ladass said in a
statement he read in Hebrew,
Arabic and English. He then un
cos ered a brass plaque that said
"Embassy of Israel" in the three
languages.
The brief ceremony marking
the opening ol the Israeli em
bassy was attended by about 30
Egyptian Jews, 44 from the Un
ited Synagogues ot America and
the Woman's League for Con
servative Judaism, and several
Egyptian diplomats.
Dozens of police patrolled
the streets outside the two-story
building that rents lor $4200 a
month in the Dokki residential
district on the west bank ol the
Nile.
Neighbors watched from win
dows and doorways, but
passers-by were urged to keep
moving during the sidewalk

ceremony.
Next door, at an Arab wo
men s student hotel, wailing and
screaming was heard as the Is
raeli flag was unfurled. Fifteen
students watched the ceremony
from the windows. A teenager
closed her eyes and lowered her
head; another wept openly as the
Star of David appeared.
Other neighbors said they
welcomed the Israelis, although

a lew expressed concern about
the possibility ol terrorist attacks
by those who oppose the
peace m a k ing process.
Egypt's state-controlled news
media played down the embassy
inauguration and thextirst con
crete example of normalization,
while giving big headlines to
stories criticizing Jewish settle
ment plans in the West Bank.
In an editorial, the newspaper

Al Ahram criticized Eliahu Ben
Elissar. Israel's ambassador
designate to Cairo, who arrived
Sunday.
Al Allium accused Ben Elissar
ol undiplomatic behavior tor say
ing Egypt and the United States
had no right to say where Jews
could settle. Hie editorial said
the new ambassador should re
member that diplomatic conven
tions require some measure ol
tact.
