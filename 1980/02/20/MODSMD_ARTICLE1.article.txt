# Students protest 'Cruising'
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
It wasn't just another Hollywood
premiere. When William Friedkin's
controversial film Cruising opened
Friday at almost 600 theaters across
the country, the glamor and glitter
usually associated with opening
night was replaced by angry protest
and rhetorical battle.
Locally at the Aquarius theater in
Palo Alto, a peaceful yet earnest
demonstration was held, sponsored
by the Gay People's Union (GPU)
of Stanford.
About 25 protestors, members of
affiliates of the GPU, were joined
by three representatives of the Na
tional Organization for Women
(NOW) in picket lines flashing
homemade signs saying "Don't Go
See the Movie Cruising."
The GPU and gay organizations
nationwide have voiced protest at
Cruising's message and the image
it might convey about gay men and
their sexuality.
"Our anger comes from the cul
tural context a movie like this is
produced in. Hollywood won't pro
duce a reasonable movie about what
gay life is about," explained Arthur
Slepian, a graduate student here.
"All you see wherever the movie

goes is one stereotype of gay
macho-muscle men dressed in out
landish costumes of leather. The
only sexuality portrayed is of gay
men lusting after each other; it's de
void of any tenderness or love," he
said.
One highly criticized component
of the film has been the gruesome
depiction of gay violence.
"There is a certain amount of vio
lence in the gay community but it is
mainly perpetuated by straight
people against gays," claims Sle
pian. He cited the blatant contrast
between the sexual relationships
explicitly filmed in the sado
masochistic bars and the heterosex
ual relations portrayed in Al
Pacino's bedroom "when the music
turns to classical violins."
Several of the demonstrators
echoed Slepian's accusations that
gay relationships are perversely dis
torted in the film.
"The depiction of relationships
bears no resemblance to anything
I've experienced in my life. It's
Freidkin outdoing the Exorcist
contended David Axel, a former
masters student here. In light of
criticism that gay protestors are infr
inging on the filmmaker's First
Amendment rights, Axel corn

merited that "the power of film is so
enormous that to let that message
go unchallenged is unconsciona
ble."
Ed Christiani, a professional in
county government, said he felt the
film portrayed an unjust characteri
zation of gay life. "The film shows
that being around gay people will
make you gay and that gay hatred is
such that its expression is in killing
other gay people. This is a false
view."
Three representatives of NOW,
Abby Boyd. Lillian Cincone and
Kathleen McHugh-Bodylski, ex
pressed similar objections to the
film.
"We object to the idea of present
ing lesbian and gay men in a de
rogatory light. This film presents
homosexuals as deviant murderers
and unfeeling lovers, lt'stimed per
fectly for the 'Hate the Homo'
movement." said Boyd.
breidkin has maintained that the
film never intends to depict "what
gay life is about. It is based on actual
events," he said, "on attitudes and
perceptions of people within the gay
community and within the police
department that I talked to in form
ing the script. The movie is merely a

reflection of what 1 saw."
Aside from the offensive interac
tions Cruising camera zeros in on at
every conceivable angle, Slepian
cited a potential political repercus
sion as one of the CPU's concerns.
"The image of gay people that
Cruising portrays will affect
people's attitudes on upcoming
Santa Clara referendums on gay
rights. For some people this is their
first perception of gay life," said
Slepian.
The GPU's protest staged at the
Aquarius might have proven suc
cessful where the 8:15 p.m. show

catered to a half-empty theatre, but
nationwide, the gay community's
protest has ironically backfired.
The Aquarius management en
tertained dialogue on whether or
not to play the film previous to a
screening two weeks ago. Alan
Shustak. general manager of the
Bayside Theatres, expressed his
conviction in deciding to run the
movie.
"This is America. My views aren't
important. I'm exhibiting a film and
whether or not i agree with the di
rector is not the point. 1 think it's
just as important that they're out
there picketing."

"The image of gay people that
Cruising portrays will affect
people's attitudes on upcoming
Santa Clara referendums on gay
rights. For some people this is their
first perception of gay life," said
Slepian.
The GPU's protest staged at the
Aquarius might have proven suc
cessful where the 8:15 p.m. show

catered to a half-empty theatre, but
nationwide, the gay community's
protest has ironically backfired.
The Aquarius management en
tertained dialogue on whether or
not to play the film previous to a
screening two weeks ago. Alan
Shustak. general manager of the
Bayside Theatres, expressed his
conviction in deciding to run the
movie.
"This is America. My views aren't
important. I'm exhibiting a film and
whether or not i agree with the di
rector is not the point. 1 think it's
just as important that they're out
there picketing."
It wasn't just another Hollywood
premiere. When William Friedkin's
controversial film Cruising opened
Friday at almost 600 theaters across
the country, the glamor and glitter
usually associated with opening
night was replaced by angry protest
and rhetorical battle.
Locally at the Aquarius theater in
Palo Alto, a peaceful yet earnest
demonstration was held, sponsored
by the Gay People's Union (GPU)
of Stanford.
About 25 protestors, members of
affiliates of the GPU, were joined
by three representatives of the Na
tional Organization for Women
(NOW) in picket lines flashing
homemade signs saying "Don't Go
See the Movie Cruising."
The GPU and gay organizations
nationwide have voiced protest at
Cruising's message and the image
it might convey about gay men and
their sexuality.
"Our anger comes from the cul
tural context a movie like this is
produced in. Hollywood won't pro
duce a reasonable movie about what
gay life is about," explained Arthur
Slepian, a graduate student here.
"All you see wherever the movie

goes is one stereotype of gay
macho-muscle men dressed in out
landish costumes of leather. The
only sexuality portrayed is of gay
men lusting after each other; it's de
void of any tenderness or love," he
said.
One highly criticized component
of the film has been the gruesome
depiction of gay violence.
"There is a certain amount of vio
lence in the gay community but it is
mainly perpetuated by straight
people against gays," claims Sle
pian. He cited the blatant contrast
between the sexual relationships
explicitly filmed in the sado
masochistic bars and the heterosex
ual relations portrayed in Al
Pacino's bedroom "when the music
turns to classical violins."
Several of the demonstrators
echoed Slepian's accusations that
gay relationships are perversely dis
torted in the film.
"The depiction of relationships
bears no resemblance to anything
I've experienced in my life. It's
Freidkin outdoing the Exorcist
contended David Axel, a former
masters student here. In light of
criticism that gay protestors are infr
inging on the filmmaker's First
Amendment rights, Axel corn

merited that "the power of film is so
enormous that to let that message
go unchallenged is unconsciona
ble."
Ed Christiani, a professional in
county government, said he felt the
film portrayed an unjust characteri
zation of gay life. "The film shows
that being around gay people will
make you gay and that gay hatred is
such that its expression is in killing
other gay people. This is a false
view."
Three representatives of NOW,
Abby Boyd. Lillian Cincone and
Kathleen McHugh-Bodylski, ex
pressed similar objections to the
film.
"We object to the idea of present
ing lesbian and gay men in a de
rogatory light. This film presents
homosexuals as deviant murderers
and unfeeling lovers, lt'stimed per
fectly for the 'Hate the Homo'
movement." said Boyd.
