war. you've seen them all.
quipped Terry Provance ol the
American Friends Service
Committee at last week's
Bechtel l-CenterTuesday Lunc
heon.
Provance*s message, however,
was not humorous.
"In my opinion, the U.S.
began the arms race, and we
should do all we can to change
our policy." he said. II the U.S.
were to declare a nuclear
moratorium, the Soviets would
respond, he said.
"It's a risk we have to take,
because with more countries ob
taining nuclear weapons, an all
out war is inevitable — most
likely before the year 2000." he
warned.
Provance. national coor

in the Vietnam Anti-War
Movement and participated in
the Pentagon Papers Peace Pro

and Anthony Russo.
"The 1 WOs could be very ac
tive tor the peace movement but
may be even more active for the
war movement." he said. "As
things unfold, we're seeing very
dangerous developments, and. I
believe, overreactions which will
lead to even more dangerous de
velopments."
War has never solv ed disputes,
and that the Soviet Union's in
tervention in Afghanistan is
wrong and should be con
demned. Provance said.
"Nevertheless, if the U.S. is so
concerned about naked agres
sion. we should begin looking lor
examples right here, he said.
"Our country did similar things
in Guatemala, the Dominican
Republic, and Chile — and it
continues now under the C arter
administration."

According to Pro\unce. the
developments which currently
threaten America originated in
tin,' United States.
•"In my opinion, the U.S. has
heen organizing the decline ol
detente for the past three or lour
\ears." he said. "This sabotage
ol detente made it easier lor the
So\ iets to intervene . . . we dam
aged things so badly that they
had nothing to risk."
The normalizing of relations
with China contributed to the
damage, he said. "The 'way' in
which we're going about it is
causing paranoia on the part ol
the Soviets."
In addition. "The U.S. Gov
ernment. in an etlorl to attain

nuclear and military superiority,
systematically pressured the
NATO alliance to adopt a policy
ol deploying 572 nuclear missiles
on Dec. 12. I 7." he said.
"Then on Oct. 6. we rejected
President Brezhnev's counter
proposal — only three weeks be
fore the invasion."
Commitment?
Finally, recent efforts to build
popular support for the Persian
Gull crises threaten stability.
Prosance said. "There are forces
in the U.S. which won't accept
the SALT II treaty and that still
want to control the world." he
said. "What kind of signals are
we sending the Soviets as our
military budget continues to spi

ral?" he asked. "Where is the
U.S. commitment to detente?"
The two-fold crisis facing the
United States will be solved
within the next two to five
months, Provanee said."What is
happening right now is an effort
to build support for our in
creased weapons systems using
Iran and the Middle East as pre
texts . . . it's all an over reaction
The U.S. is attempting to regain
its overkill advantage over the
Sin iet Union," he said.
Provanee said the revision of
registration and the draft is an
additional overreaction — an ef
fort of military machoism going
too far — even for the Carter
administration."

in the U.S. which won't accept
the SALT II treaty and that still
want to control the world." he
said. "What kind of signals are

United States will be solved

months, Provanee said."What is
happening right now is an effort

"II you've seen one nuclear
war. you've seen them all.
quipped Terry Provance ol the
American Friends Service
Committee at last week's
Bechtel l-CenterTuesday Lunc
heon.
Provance*s message, however,
was not humorous.
"In my opinion, the U.S.
began the arms race, and we
should do all we can to change
our policy." he said. II the U.S.
were to declare a nuclear
moratorium, the Soviets would
respond, he said.
"It's a risk we have to take,
because with more countries ob
taining nuclear weapons, an all
out war is inevitable — most
likely before the year 2000." he

"The 1 WOs could be very ac
tive tor the peace movement but
may be even more active for the
war movement." he said. "As
things unfold, we're seeing very
dangerous developments, and. I
believe, overreactions which will
lead to even more dangerous de
velopments."
War has never solv ed disputes,
and that the Soviet Union's in
tervention in Afghanistan is
wrong and should be con
demned. Provance said.
