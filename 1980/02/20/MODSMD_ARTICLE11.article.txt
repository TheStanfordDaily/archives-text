TORONTO — The return of
the "new" Pierre Elliott
Trudeau to power may herald a
perceptible Canadian shit I to the
left and away from the United
States.
The two North American
neighbors remain the "greatest
friends." Trudeau says. But he
has made clear that his liberals
will not necessarily hew to the
staunchly pro-U.S. policies pur
sued by Prime Minister Joe
Clark's Conservative govern
ment. ousted in Monday's par
liamentary election.
112 inal returns from the election
show the Liberals won a majority
of 146 seats in the 282-seat
Mouse ol Commons, to 103 for
Clark's Progressive Conserva
tives and 32 for the socialist New
Democrats. The race for one seat
is postponed until March be
cause ot a candidate's death.
Clark had gained power only
nine months ago. ending
Trudeau's I I years as prime
minister in an election that gave
the Conservatives a 136-114
minority edge in Commons. But
Conservative tax increases led to
a no-confidence vote in Parlia
ment and a new election.
With all but one percent of
Monday's popular vote counted,
the Liberals had 4.749.XX6
votes, or 43.9 percent, the Con
servatives 3,568,361. for 33 per
cent. and the New Democrats
2.142.054. for 19.X percent.
Trudeau. 60. comes back to

the prime ministry at a time
when such U.S. presidential can
didates as Ronald Reagan and
Edmund G. Brown are touting a
U. S. - C a n a d i a n - M e x i c a n
"Common Market" as a solution
to some of the continent s
economic woes — particularly
energy problems.
Many Canadians view this as a
plan to raid their vast resources.
Friction already exists in
U.S.-Canadian relations over
economic and environmental is
sues.
Canada is threatening to go to
the World Court il the Senate
refuses to ratify newly
negotiated fisheries and bound
arv treaties. And Canadian
ecologists. fearful of coastal oil
spills, are outraged over the
Clark government's agreement
to allow increased ffaffic of U.S.
tankers carrying Alaskan oil
down Canada's west coast.
Clark was the first Western
leader to endorse the U.S. idea
ol boycotting the Moscow sum
mer Olympics in retaliation for
the Soviet move into Afghanis
tan. He put his government to
work scouting sites in Canada for
a substitute "free world games."
Declaring that "strength pre
vents war." he vowed to boost
defense spending.
T rudeau also denounced the
Soviet Afghan operation, but he
questioned the wisdom of an
Olympic boycott, finally saying
he would go along with it it a
large number of nations joined

Like President Jimmy Carter.
Clark set a deadline — today —
lor the Soviets to pull out of Af
ghanistan. Trudeau is not likely
to feel bound bv it.
