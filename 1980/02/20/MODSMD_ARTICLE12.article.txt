## NATO rejects Soviet demands 
### Don Cook The Los Angeles Times 
PARIS — Despite the internal
diplomatic strains over a coordi
nated response to the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan, the
NATO governments remain
completely united in rejecting
Russian demands for abandon
ment of the program to intro
duce new tactical nuclear mis
siles into Western Europe.
The latest such Soviet move
came in a speech in Moscow on
Monday by Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko, in which he
said that the Kremlin was ready
to continue disarmament talks
"if the NATO decision on
American medium-range nuc
lear missiles in Europe is can
celed. or if its implementation is
at least officially suspended."
Last month in a formal dip
lomatic communication to the
NATO powers, the Soviet Union
had demanded that the alliance
■ publicly renounce" the nuclear
modernization program. The use
of the term "suspend" by
Gromyko, instead ol the words
"renounce" or"canccl." seemed
to be slightly softer in tone. But
the effect is the same, whatever
term is applied. So is the NATO
reaction.
'Suspension'
In replying to the earlier for
mal Soviet communication, the
NATO. Permanent Council in
Brussels issued a formal state
ment of its own. saying that the
member governments "had no
intention ol renouncing" their
decision. The attitude in Brussels
remains the same on the latest
Soviet overture suggesting "sus
pension."
A source in Brussels said yes
terday that "we are unanimous
that we see no practical differ
ence in what Gromyko is saying
today compared to what they
said in their communication to us
last month. We do not see any
need for a formal reply so far."
A program to modernize the
NATO nuclear arsenal in West
ern Europe with 572 new
medium-range Pershing-ll and
ground-launched cruise missiles
was agreed to at a joint meeting
of the alliance's foreign and de
fense ministers in Brussels on
Dec. 12. All the missiles will be
American-made, at a cost ol
more than $5 billion, with the

European allies bearing the in
stallation, maintenance and crew
costs. The new nuclear weapons
are designed to offset the threat
to Western Europe of the Soviet
SS-20 missiles which are
targeted on NATO capitals and
military installations.
Block and reverse
The Kremlin has mounted a
major campaign for months of
political, diplomatic and military
threats with two aims: first, to try
to block the NATO decision to
install the new nuclear weapons
and. when that failed, to try to
get it reversed. But the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan stif
fened the determination of even
those NATO governments that
had been lukewarm about the
nuclear reinforcement program.
They now plan to see it through
and not give the Soviet Union
any iiope of spl i 11i ng t he all ianee.
NATO sources point out that
if the Russians want to engage in
meaningful negotiations on

limiting nuclear weapons in
Europe, there is plenty of time
before the new generation of
missiles is ready for deployment.
Production will not begin before
1982, with deployment to begin
in the last quarter of 1983.
Since the Afghanistan crisis
began nearly two months ago,
NATO diplomats have been an
ticipating some kind of Soviet
"peace offensive." However,
save for such speeches as
Gromyko's. there have been no
concrete moves by the Kremlin.
But in line with the continuing
effort to split the European allies
and the United States, Gromyko
again accused Washington of
over-reacting to Afghanistan.
And he said that the Soviet
Union wished to open discus
sions on military detente in
Europe when the 35 countries
that signed the Helsinki Agree
ments meet in Madrid in
November to review those ac
cords.
