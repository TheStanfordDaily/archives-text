# In the wake of military agreement
## Kenya president visits United States 
### Victoria Brittain The Washington Post 
NAIROBI. Kenya — President Daniel
Arap Moi of Kenya arrived in Washington
vesterday on a state visit that coincides with
Kenya's emergence as a staunch ally and
lairlv new military client ol the United
States.
The former British colony in east Africa
was one ol the first African states to declare
against going to the Moscow Olympics after
President Jimmy Carter made his appeal lor
a world boycott because ol the Soviet inva
sion ol Afghanistan.
Moi went to some length to tell his people
his decision to pull out was based on non
aligned principles and the global interests ol
small states. He has subsequently told his
officials that even if the U.S. changed its
policy and decided to go to Moscow, Kenya
would not go.
Even so. the United States must have been
gratified by the Kenyan decision, for in
purely athletic terms Kenya is the country
that counts more than any other in Africa: It
has the world-class distance runners, like
multiple world-record holder Henry
Rono. who were the the only African
athletes expected to capture gold medals in
the games.
As a military client. Kenya has recently
diversified its arms purchases from a tradi
tional narrow dependence on the British to

include major procurements of F-5E jets and
Bell helicopters from the United States.
Strategic dimension
The Afghan crisis, following the end to the
U.S. military position in Iran, has suddenly
given this quietly flourishing bilateral rela
tionship a strategic dimension.
Oman. Somalia and Kenya are the Indian
Ocean states that have been approached for
facilities that the United States could use in
the event of a crisis in the region. Although
U.S. tactical aircraft would have to be re
fueled in mid-air if they flew from Kenya's
Mombasa airfield, Kenya is unique among
these states in being able to contribute food
and some other essentials at U.S. standards
to the logistical side of a U.S. military opera
tion in the Indian Ocean.
At a press conference in Bonn during a
visit that preceded his U.S. trip. President
Moi made this distinction (crucial toaijOAU
member and non-aligned state) when admit
ting that Kenya had responded positively to
the U.S. approaches:
"It is not true that we have offered the
United States a military base in my country.
What we have done and will continue to do,
is offer military facilities to that nation."
Secrets
All specifics on such facilities are being
kept secret. Reliable informants say that they
do not at this stage go beyond a discreet
increase in the military side of the U.S. Em

bassy in Nairobi, and the provision of some
kind of storage facility in Mombasa to hold
spare parts.
Kenya remains one of the more prosper
ous of African countries, but Moi is likely to
ask for American help with the foreign
exchange crisis brought on by the increase in
oil prices. The Kenyan oil bill has leaped
from $130 million in 197N to more than dou
ble in 1980, according to the Kenyan energy
minister Munyua Waiyaki. "We must either
reduce our economic growth or borrow
foreign exchange," he said.
The second imperative on the Kenyan side
is food aid from America. Serious shortages
of the staple maize crop threaten in April,
and other cereals such as rice and wheat are
in chronically short supply.
Reminder
The Kenyans are also expected to use the
occasion of discussion of America's strategic
needs in the Norn of Africa to remind Carter
that Kenya's northern neighbor, Somalia,
has never renounced her claim over part of
northern Kenya, and that any American re
arming of Somalia would not be well re
ceived by Kenya.
But in arguing against U.S. hacking — with
weapons — for Somalia, the Kenyans will
come up against the Somali plea that, with
Soviet-and Cuban-backed Ethiopia as a hos
tile neighbor, Somalia could become the next
Afghanistan.

U.S. military position in Iran, has suddenly
given this quietly flourishing bilateral rela
tionship a strategic dimension.
Oman. Somalia and Kenya are the Indian
Ocean states that have been approached for
facilities that the United States could use in
the event of a crisis in the region. Although
U.S. tactical aircraft would have to be re
fueled in mid-air if they flew from Kenya's
Mombasa airfield, Kenya is unique among
these states in being able to contribute food
and some other essentials at U.S. standards
to the logistical side of a U.S. military opera
tion in the Indian Ocean.
At a press conference in Bonn during a
visit that preceded his U.S. trip. President
Moi made this distinction (crucial toaijOAU
member and non-aligned state) when admit
ting that Kenya had responded positively to
the U.S. approaches:
"It is not true that we have offered the
United States a military base in my country.
What we have done and will continue to do,
is offer military facilities to that nation."
Secrets
All specifics on such facilities are being
kept secret. Reliable informants say that they
do not at this stage go beyond a discreet
increase in the military side of the U.S. Em

bassy in Nairobi, and the provision of some
kind of storage facility in Mombasa to hold
spare parts.
Kenya remains one of the more prosper
ous of African countries, but Moi is likely to
ask for American help with the foreign
exchange crisis brought on by the increase in
oil prices. The Kenyan oil bill has leaped
from $130 million in 197N to more than dou
ble in 1980, according to the Kenyan energy
minister Munyua Waiyaki. "We must either
reduce our economic growth or borrow
foreign exchange," he said.
The second imperative on the Kenyan side
is food aid from America. Serious shortages
of the staple maize crop threaten in April,
and other cereals such as rice and wheat are
in chronically short supply.
Reminder
The Kenyans are also expected to use the
occasion of discussion of America's strategic
needs in the Norn of Africa to remind Carter
that Kenya's northern neighbor, Somalia,
has never renounced her claim over part of
northern Kenya, and that any American re
arming of Somalia would not be well re
ceived by Kenya.
But in arguing against U.S. hacking — with
weapons — for Somalia, the Kenyans will
come up against the Somali plea that, with
Soviet-and Cuban-backed Ethiopia as a hos
tile neighbor, Somalia could become the next
Afghanistan.
