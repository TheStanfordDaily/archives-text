# Student, law prof vie for assembly

### Kathleen McClung Staff writer 
In the race for the California
state assembly seat from the 21st
district, two members of the Un
iversity community have an
nounced their campaigns. In
cumbent Vic Calvo will not seek
re-election.
Byron Sher, professor at the
Law School and Chuck Olson,
graduate student in biology have
filed with the Santa Clara
County Registrar of Voters Of
fice their declarations of inten
tion to run. Sher is a Democrat
and Olson is a Libertarian.
Sher, 52, is currently a Palo
Alto City Councilman and a
former mayor. He has been a
member of several county, state
and national committees.
Olson, 23, said "I have never
sought public office before, but I
intend a serious and full-time
campaign."

In recent interviews the candi
dates outlined the platforms and
strategies for their campaigns.
The environment, energy and
state economy are the primary
political issues at stake, said
Slier. But "these issues are
merely aspects of the over-riding
question: what standard of liv
ing, what level of consumption,
can we tolerate and still leave a
liveable planet to our grandchil
dren?" he said.
Slier strongly supports state
and local conservation efforts
and further development of al
ternative energy sources, solar
energy in particular.
"I support, also, the state
moratorium on the licensing of
nuclear facilities. The safety
hazards are just too great to go
forward with nuclear energy."
On the money issue, Sher voi
ced concern over the impact of
the lively "Jams II" tax cut.

"Assuming Jarvis II passes the
legislature, it will cut state re
venues by 25 percent. I want to
know just where the remaining
money will go."
As a Libertarian, Olson plans
to center his campaign around
his party's proposals for
economic and social reforms.
"Although this is a state cam
paign, federal issues will be pop
ping up," he said.
"I plan to stress my anti-draft
position and my support for the
California marijuana initiative.
Also, I seek a drastic tax reduc
tion and the abolition of the sales
tax which is a particularly hein
ous tax."
Libertarians base much of
their political philosophy on a
support of "individual freedom
and human rights," Olson said,
"as long as expressing those
rights doesn't violate the rights
of others.

"We offer a real alternative of
less government. The great thing
about the Libertarian party is
that it brings people into politics
who otherwise wouldn't be in
volved at all."
"I'm not going to rule out the
possibility of winning," Olson
said, "But our race will be de
voted mainly to educating the
public."
Olson foresees a "low-budget
campaign" and a heavy emphasis
on volunteer services, while Sher
intends to "raise substantial
sums within the district itself'
through fund raisers and local
contributors.
"This will be a grass-roots
campaign," Sher said. "I plan to
be out meeting the voters. I will
be out walking, going door-to
door, because the best govern
ment is the government that's
closest to the people."
A third candidate. Republican
Greg Morris of Sunnyvale, was
unavailable for comment.
