CHICAGO (AP) — Up to one third of male
sexual impotence is caused by physical problems, a
study by researchers at Harvard Medical School
shows, disputing conventional thought that it is
largely due to emotional difficulties.
Fhe study, reported in the current Journal of the
American Medical Association, found that impo
tence in more than one-third of the patients
examined was caused by hormonal imbalances
brought about by glandular disorders.
Dr. Richard Spark said tests to determine the
level of the sex hormone testosterone on 105 pa
tients uncovered 37 with glandular abnormalities,
of whom 33 became potent after treatment.
Spark said all the men had been told by doctors
that their problem was caused by the natural aging
process, anxiety or depression.
He suggested that it may be time to "restructure

our approach to the impotent patients. The associ
ation of an unsettling life event and the develop
ment of impotence need not imply a cause-and
effect relationship."

SEATTLE (AP) — Scientists are close to de
veloping a vaccine to provide immunity from
gonorrhea, says Duane A. Olsen, a research
technologist at the University of Washington.
Olsen is one of eight headed by Dr. Tom Bucha
nan. The team recently was awarded a five-year
federal grant of about $500,000 to develop an
anti-gonorrhea vaccine.
A vaccine providing antibodies that last in the
body for seven weeks already is being tested on
human volunteers, and a vaccine offering immun
ity for as lonu as a year is within reach, Olsen says.
