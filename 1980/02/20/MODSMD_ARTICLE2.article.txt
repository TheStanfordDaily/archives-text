# University could lose $680,000
## Tax initiative threatens scholarships 
### Diana Hoffman Staff Writer (First of two parts 
Proposition 9, a tax-cutting initiative
that will appear on the June ballot,
could cause the state grant recipients
here to lose up to $680,000 in 1980-81,
according to University administrators.

News analysis

The Stanford Hospital could be dep
rived of nearly $1.4 million in Medi-
Cal reimbursements, according to the
same sources.
The passage of Prop 9 — nicknamed

Jarvis II after its author, Howard Jarvis
(co-author of Proposition 13) — would
reduce state expenditures by an esti
mated $260 million annually. Because
of this cutback, the California Student
Aid Commission (CSAC), which pro
vides state scholarships for both under
graduate and graduate students, could
be forced to trim its budget by 25 per
cent. Such an action would affect stu
dents throughout the state, including
the 726 State Scholarship (Cal Grant
A) and 56 College Opportunity Grant
(Cal Grant B) recipients here at Stan
ford.
In addition, the Stanford Hospital
and Medical School would be adversely

affected by Jarvis IPs enaction. The
Hospital currently receives approxi
mately $14 million per year in the form
of Medi-Cal reimbursements. How
ever. Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Freelen estimated that
five to 10 percent of this amount would
be lost if Jarvis II were passed and
caused a Medi-Cal cutback.
Freelen feared that the Medical
School would be denied the $1.8 mill
ion that it expected to receive under the
state's medical capitation program.
The program insured that for every ad
ditional admission beyond a particular
base number, the Med School was to be
paid a certain amount by the state. Be

cause the program was declared uncon
stitutional, payment of the $ 1.8 million
by the state depends upon the passage
and signing of an appropriations bill
that is being introduced in the state
legislature. The bill's passage is, in
turn, likely to rest upon the outcome of
the vote on Prop. 9.
Tax adjustment
The proposition itself calls for main
taining the state-imposed personal in
come'tax at a level that "shall not ex
ceed 50 percent of those rates in effect
for the 1978 taxable year." Under the
provisions of Prop 9, tax brackets
would be adjusted to reflect changes in
the California consumer price index;
business inventories would he exemp
ted from property taxation.
Prop 9's passage would, according to
the state attorney general, cause a drop
of approximately $5.1 billion in state
revenues for the fiscal year 1980-81;
an estimated reduction of $4.3 billion is
projected for the following year. This
means that if Jarvis II should be ap
proved hy the voters, the state of
California will have less money to dis
tribute to state-funded programs and
state agencies. In anticipation of Prop
9's passage. Gov. Jerry Brown has
asked all state agencies to submit re
vised budgets that are reduced from
1980-81 levels by 30 percent.
Director of Financial Aids Robert
Huff reported that CSAC had chosen a
strategy for revising its budget in order
to comply with Brown's request. At its
meeting on Feb. 6, the commission de
cided to impose percentage reductions
of Cal grants if Jarvis II should pass.
Huff said that the revised budget calls
for A grants to be cut by 26.3 percent
and for B grants, which assist families
with exceptional financial needs, to be
reduced by 25 percent.
These reductions would cause state
scholarship recipients here to lose a
total of $670,000 to $680,000 in
1980-81, according to Huff.
University compensation
If Stanford students lose a percen
tage of their scholarship money, the
University will probably attempt to
compensate for the loss. Asst. Provost
for Budgeting and Planning, Tim

Warner explained that Stanford has a
policy whereby the University helps
each student to meet his or her "de
monstrated need" by offering grants,
loans and jobs. A reduction in state
scholarship dollars would increase the
demonstrated need of students on fi
nancial aid.
In order to continue meeting these
financial needs, the University would
be forced either to demand more stu
dent self-help (through jobs and loans)
or to obtain the necessary funds
through other means — perhaps by
raising tuition or by diverting funds to
the financial aid program at the ex
pense of other programs.
State affects
State colleges and universities would
be even more directly affected by the
passage of Jarvis 11. According to a
press release issued by the Student Ad
visory Committee to the California
Postsecondary Education Commis
sion, "Substantial and immediate tui
tion increases, loss or reallocation of
financial aid dollars, wholesale elimi
nation of academic departments, and
severe faculty layoffs would be the
probable effects of the Jarvis II initia
tive ..."
Freelen remarked that cost increases
at state schools might have a delayed
effect upon the state scholarship sys
tem by causing more students to apply
for financial aid. A rise in the number
of state aid applicants would com
pound the problem of distributing fi
nancial aid dollars by making less
money available for distribution.
