# University could lose $680,000
## Tax initiative threatens scholarships 
### Diana Hoffman Staff Writer (First of two parts 
Proposition 9, a tax-cutting initiative
that will appear on the June ballot,
could cause the state grant recipients
here to lose up to $680,000 in 1980-81,
according to University administrators.

News analysis

The Stanford Hospital could be dep
rived of nearly $1.4 million in Medi-
Cal reimbursements, according to the
same sources.
The passage of Prop 9 — nicknamed

Jarvis II after its author, Howard Jarvis
(co-author of Proposition 13) — would
reduce state expenditures by an esti
mated $260 million annually. Because
of this cutback, the California Student
Aid Commission (CSAC), which pro
vides state scholarships for both under
graduate and graduate students, could
be forced to trim its budget by 25 per
cent. Such an action would affect stu
dents throughout the state, including
the 726 State Scholarship (Cal Grant
A) and 56 College Opportunity Grant
(Cal Grant B) recipients here at Stan
ford.
In addition, the Stanford Hospital
and Medical School would be adversely

affected by Jarvis IPs enaction. The
Hospital currently receives approxi
mately $14 million per year in the form
of Medi-Cal reimbursements. How
ever. Assoc. Vice President for Public
Affairs Robert Freelen estimated that
five to 10 percent of this amount would
be lost if Jarvis II were passed and
caused a Medi-Cal cutback.
Freelen feared that the Medical
School would be denied the $1.8 mill
ion that it expected to receive under the
state's medical capitation program.
The program insured that for every ad
ditional admission beyond a particular
base number, the Med School was to be
paid a certain amount by the state. Be

cause the program was declared uncon
stitutional, payment of the $ 1.8 million
by the state depends upon the passage
and signing of an appropriations bill
that is being introduced in the state
legislature. The bill's passage is, in
turn, likely to rest upon the outcome of
the vote on Prop. 9.
Tax adjustment
The proposition itself calls for main
taining the state-imposed personal in
come'tax at a level that "shall not ex
ceed 50 percent of those rates in effect
for the 1978 taxable year." Under the
provisions of Prop 9, tax brackets
would be adjusted to reflect changes in
