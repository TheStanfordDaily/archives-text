## Choose foreign battles with care 
### 
Having settled into a new
routine in New York City. I was
startled to open the Feb. 4 issue
of Time magazine and to recog
nize the faces of my friends, pic
tured at a recent anti
registration rally. To those who
are so strongly against the presi
dent's proposal to "Revitalize
the Selective Service" that they
are moved to protest in White
Plaza. I would like to pose the
following question: "What are
your fears?"
You may fear that young
Americans will be sent to an
Asian jungle, armed to support a
corrupt regime. The thought re
minds me of a line from a Viet
nam protest song that my mother
used to sing: "He died in a land,
with a gun in his hand, fighting a
war he did not understand.''
You may fear that, in a tragedy
parallel to the American experi
ence in Vietnam. Americans w ill
once again be sent to a distant
land, only to return shaken,
maimed, or in body bags. These
memories evoke scenes from
documentries such as Hearts
and Minds: a south-
Vietnamese boy sobs at the
grave of his soldier tather. as
General William Westmoreland
mindlessly states that Asians
"place a lower value on human
life." An ex-fighter pilot cries,
head in hands, as he con
templates the deaths and injuries
that he wrought upon innocent
village rs.
I share the fear that similar
scenes will be repeated in new
settings. Predictably , many polit
ical figures now suggest that it is
time to "unlearn" the lessons of
Vietnam. I cannot disagree
more. Concern about Soviet ag
gression must never lead this
country to suppress a national
resistance struggle, blindly fol
lowing the logic that an ally of
the Soviet Union is necessarily
an enemy of the United States.
And yet. the lessons of Viet
nam do not rule out endorse
ment of the president's sugges
tion that we make ourselves
more ready to come to the de
fense of America's vital interests
in the world.
Most of us are familiar with
the poster that, upon a colorful
background, reads: "What it

they decided to have a war . . .
and nobod> came?" That's a
noble vision. The trouble is that
lately, in Angola, Somalia.
Ethiopia. Cambodia and Af
ghanistan, the Soviet Union has
been showing up tor wars, while
the United States has failed to
take actions that would curb
Son let expansionism.
If only the world were such a
lovely place that nations did not
hand rifles to their sons and send
them off to be killed, or to kill
others. But it simply is not.
Americans have reluctantly
learned this tact several times in
the 20th century, most recently
in the 19605. As a result of the
Vietnam protest movement.
Americans came to view the
draft as a vehicle for military ag
gression. not as an instrument of
national defense. But the Real
politik of the 1960s is not the
Realpolitik of the 1980s.
The cause of peace in 1980
would not be served if American
college students refused to regis
ter for service in the armed
forces. It would not be served it
this nation crippled itself in the
face of an external challenge. In
an age characterized by nuclear
weapons and sophisticated con
ventional arsenals, peace is the
consequents of an uneasy mili
tary balance.
We seek to avoid tertiary con
flict that could escalate into an
exchange of nuclear missiles. We
reh on the concept ot deter
rence.
Deterrence means that we do
not leave ourselves vulnerable in
areas where we have determined
that we hold \ ital interests. "Na
tional security" is a nebulous
phrase. It can be used to justify
both internal repression and
foreign adventurism. Yet no one
will deny that the oilfields in the
Middle East are vital to the sec
urity of the American nation and
the nations ol the industrial
West.
It may seem crass when Presi
dent Jimmy Carter appeals to us
to be prepared to use military
force in order to preserve our ac
cess to a gooey fossil fuel. But the
health of our economy in the
year 1980 depends on the oil that
flows under the Arabian Desert.
National depression is what Car

ter refers to when he speaks of
the inherent danger of failing to
move to protect our vital in
terests.
To those students who at
tended the anti-registration
rally, to those who express a
great sensitivity to the horrors of
war. I pose a second question:
"Is human life so precious in it
self that there is no ideal worth
dying for?" Granted, the preser
vation of the regime in South
Vietnam was not worth dving
for. But most'of us would have
sacrificed our lives to turn back
Hitler's armies. In that same
spirit. I hope that most of us
would sacrifice our lives to de
tend our NATO allies against
advancing Soviet tanks. The is
sues at stake would be clear cut:
Soviet imperialism vs. national
self-determination. To
talitarianism vs. civil liberty,
forced communalism vs. indi
vidual freedom.
Contemporary Western civili
zation salutes the memories of
the Allied soldiers who fought on
the beaches ot Normandy, the
Jewish resisters in the Warsaw
Ghetto, the Hungarian freedom
fighters, those who dare scale the
Berlin Wall. These acts of cour
age sanctify the ideals that most
of us take for granted, that many
of us are embarrassed to acknow -
ledge.
In academic life, we are given
the chance to formulate a
perspective on world events, not
the opportunity to div orce ourse
lves from unpleasant reality . Col
lege students must never reach
the point where they view them
selves as removed from the
mainstream of America, free
from a sense of national dutv.

We are a nation of reluctant
soldiers. Il is imperative that we
choose our battles cautiously,
with an eye to what has gone be
fore us. (ii \ en the legacy ol \ ict
nam. our apprehension toward
a call to military ser\ ice is natural
and reasonable. But we should
remind ourselves that our herit
age as American citizens pre
eeeds Vietnam. I lie president's
registration proposal should
motivate us to think about that
heritage, contemplate recent de
velopments and decide what
kind of world we want to have in
the 1980s.
