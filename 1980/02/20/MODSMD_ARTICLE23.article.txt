# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mark Agnew Review Kennedy's work 
### 
Arthur Okun, chief economic adviser to Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson, recently s;iid, "The presi
dent is running for re-election as military comman
der in chief. He has good reason to hope that
nobody pays much attention to the domestic
economy."
I say that while this is the case anyone can, and
every American should, criticize our executive
leadership. Eric Wall and Ron Lemieux ("Why
pro-Kennedy?" Feb. 6) call this "destructive criti
cism." Baloney! The politics of criticism are an
inherent tool of this nation and its leaders. True
greatness in both is tested by their abilities to bear
out criticism and debate, not hide from it.
I do appreciate Wall and Lemieux tor demand
ing a review of Sen. Edward Kennedy's presiden
tial qualifications. I regret that the extensive sub
ject of my last article ("Carter must face failures,"
Jan. 30) precluded a just presentation of the
reasons why Kennedy should be our next presi
dent. They are the following.
Kennedy lias a different view of the presidency,
"a view of a forceful, effective presidency, in the
thick of the action, at the center of all the great
concerns our people share." His success has not
rested solely on his abilities to deal with one
specific issue. Over his 17 years in the Se
nate he has endeavored to better the internal fibre
ol our nation.
Kennedy has co-sponsored every major civil
rights bill in the last 1 7 years. In the past decade, he
lias compiled a percent voting record on the side
of en\ironmental protection (the highest rate of
any senator). I le is the principal sponsor ot the first
comprehensive revision of the Federal Criminal
Code m the nation's history. Kennedy was the first
recipient of the Phil Hart Public Service Award,
the most prestigious acclaim given by the Con
sumer's Federation of America.
With specific concern to our economy, Kennedy
authored the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. In
its first year, this bill resulted in a 10 percent in
crease in the industry's employment while also
providing $2.5 billion in savings to the consumer.
The senator is presently working on similar legisla
tion for the trucking industry.
But where deregulation can improve our lives, so

can governmental control. Kennedy has called tin
immediate gas-rationing. Sacrificing OPEC oil for
more national and economic security is in this na
tion's hest interest. We need discipline to change
our habits and the senator believes that the gov
ernment can help us begin immediately. He also
supports the exploration of oil in developing na
tions. Kennedy demands a two-year moratorium
on new nuclear plant construction until the critical
issues of safety are resolved.
In proof of Kennedy's dedicated service to every
American body, over 40 major health bills that are
now law bear his name. 1 le has forged the mold for
national health insurance that carries with it built
in cost controls.
But while Kennedy is concerned about our
health, he has also fought for our, your, educa
tional opportunity. Kennedy was the co-sponsor of
the original Guaranteed Student Loan program as
well as the National Direct Student Loan bill.
Concerning women, Kennedy has never sof
tened his active support for the Equal Rights
Amendment. Another example of his ac
complishments in women's rights is legislation to
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of pre
gnancy and to provide mandatory maternity leaves
for working women.
With regard to the future, one prime ingredient
of a Kennedy presidency would most surely be a
consistent foreign policy. If his domestic service is
any indication, the senator has the keen ability to
surround himself with the finest advisers this coun
try can offer. Yet Kennedy himself would prevail as
our spokesman on world affairs. As president, he
would not allow our foreign policy to vacillate from
that of two advisers to nothing at all.
We need this man of direction. The world needs
this kind of American president.
Kennedy has consistently initiated and ac
complished legislation beneficial to the American
people. He succeeds at effecting change. Ask that
of every candidate in this election year, then ask for
more from Kennedy — as the next president of the
United States.

well as the National Direct Student Loan bill.
Concerning women, Kennedy has never sof
tened his active support for the Equal Rights
Amendment. Another example of his ac
complishments in women's rights is legislation to
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of pre
gnancy and to provide mandatory maternity leaves
for working women.
With regard to the future, one prime ingredient
of a Kennedy presidency would most surely be a
consistent foreign policy. If his domestic service is
any indication, the senator has the keen ability to
surround himself with the finest advisers this coun
try can offer. Yet Kennedy himself would prevail as
our spokesman on world affairs. As president, he
would not allow our foreign policy to vacillate from
that of two advisers to nothing at all.
We need this man of direction. The world needs
this kind of American president.
Kennedy has consistently initiated and ac
complished legislation beneficial to the American
people. He succeeds at effecting change. Ask that
of every candidate in this election year, then ask for
more from Kennedy — as the next president of the
United States.

Arthur Okun, chief economic adviser to Presi
dent Lyndon Johnson, recently s;iid, "The presi
dent is running for re-election as military comman
der in chief. He has good reason to hope that
nobody pays much attention to the domestic
economy."
I say that while this is the case anyone can, and
every American should, criticize our executive
leadership. Eric Wall and Ron Lemieux ("Why
pro-Kennedy?" Feb. 6) call this "destructive criti
cism." Baloney! The politics of criticism are an
inherent tool of this nation and its leaders. True
greatness in both is tested by their abilities to bear
out criticism and debate, not hide from it.
I do appreciate Wall and Lemieux tor demand
ing a review of Sen. Edward Kennedy's presiden
tial qualifications. I regret that the extensive sub
ject of my last article ("Carter must face failures,"
Jan. 30) precluded a just presentation of the
reasons why Kennedy should be our next presi
dent. They are the following.
Kennedy lias a different view of the presidency,
"a view of a forceful, effective presidency, in the
thick of the action, at the center of all the great
concerns our people share." His success has not
rested solely on his abilities to deal with one
specific issue. Over his 17 years in the Se
nate he has endeavored to better the internal fibre
ol our nation.
Kennedy has co-sponsored every major civil
rights bill in the last 1 7 years. In the past decade, he
lias compiled a percent voting record on the side
of en\ironmental protection (the highest rate of
any senator). I le is the principal sponsor ot the first
comprehensive revision of the Federal Criminal
Code m the nation's history. Kennedy was the first
recipient of the Phil Hart Public Service Award,
the most prestigious acclaim given by the Con
sumer's Federation of America.
With specific concern to our economy, Kennedy
authored the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. In
its first year, this bill resulted in a 10 percent in
crease in the industry's employment while also
providing $2.5 billion in savings to the consumer.
The senator is presently working on similar legisla
tion for the trucking industry.
But where deregulation can improve our lives, so

can governmental control. Kennedy has called tin
immediate gas-rationing. Sacrificing OPEC oil for
more national and economic security is in this na
tion's hest interest. We need discipline to change
our habits and the senator believes that the gov
ernment can help us begin immediately. He also
supports the exploration of oil in developing na
tions. Kennedy demands a two-year moratorium
on new nuclear plant construction until the critical
issues of safety are resolved.
In proof of Kennedy's dedicated service to every
American body, over 40 major health bills that are
now law bear his name. 1 le has forged the mold for
national health insurance that carries with it built
in cost controls.
But while Kennedy is concerned about our
health, he has also fought for our, your, educa
tional opportunity. Kennedy was the co-sponsor of
the original Guaranteed Student Loan program as
well as the National Direct Student Loan bill.
Concerning women, Kennedy has never sof
tened his active support for the Equal Rights
Amendment. Another example of his ac
complishments in women's rights is legislation to
prohibit discrimination on the grounds of pre
gnancy and to provide mandatory maternity leaves
for working women.
With regard to the future, one prime ingredient
of a Kennedy presidency would most surely be a
consistent foreign policy. If his domestic service is
any indication, the senator has the keen ability to
surround himself with the finest advisers this coun
try can offer. Yet Kennedy himself would prevail as

that of two advisers to nothing at all.
