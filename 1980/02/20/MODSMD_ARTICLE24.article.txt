## Registration is the traveled road

News item: ,4 recent lime
magazine poll found that 7.? per

draft registration: six percent are

All right. America, so you're
known for some less than re
sponsible actions. I can accept
the fact that you bought four
million pet rocks. I can even con
vince myself that there were
adequate reasons for you to
purchase (how many million?)
Lincoln Continentals; after all.
gas was cheap once. And I know
it's inconvenient to recycle your
bottles and cans, even if cities
like San Francisco are beginning
to be buried in their own solid
waste.
The choice now. however, is
not one of paying a dollar or two
for a gallon of gas. or giving up a

view of the mountains across the
Bay three hundred days a year. It
is a choice with truly awesome
consequences. Yet it is a choice
wc have made with nothing more
than a simple plea from our pres
ident. You, America, have read
ily accepted a draft registration
and the need for a strong "con
ventional army." (Do we
perhaps undervalue a "conven
tional life?")
Have you considered that if
the Soviet Union really wanted
to take over Pakistan and Iran,
we would have no chance at all of
preventing them? Sure, we could
resort to "tactical" nuclear
weapons, but we can't win a con
ventional war. not in their back
yard. We are not invincible,
especially in the face of the harsh
realities of fighting in a foreign

land, ten thousand miles from
our borders. Moreover our al
lies, who depend on Persian Gulf
oil far more than we, haven't
even mentioned sending in
troops.
We are as close to world war
now as we have been in thirty
five years. Nothing radical has
changed in the past six months;
the Soviets had a puppet regime
in Afghanistan two years ago.
While Soviet tanks are certainly
unjustifiable, we've seen them
before. We didn't send troops
into Hungary in 1956 or
Czechoslovakia in 1968, when
we might have stood a chance.
The Hungarian people fought
bravely and with determination ,
and we were at the peak of our
post war strength, But Ameri
cans still remembered the reality
that was world war.
We seem to have forgotten
that now. We make bold state
ments daring the Soviets to take
another step. We're just waiting
to go in there and show those
guys the stuff we're made of, like
so many school boys brawling in
a playground. The kind of
strength we're trying to show
may very well have led to war in
1914. Our real strength can
never lie in creating a giant army
or making threats we can't carry
out.
Our strength lies in our ability
to rely on ourselves, in our ability
to respond with determination in
the face of difficulty. We can
eliminate our dependence on
foreign oil — not today, but we
can start. We can show restraint,
and we can overcome the prob
lems which threaten to provoke
what would be an unnecessary
war.
Mankind has gone to war since
the beginning of time in search of
solutions that can come only
from within. War never provides
the solutions, it only compounds
the problems.
If man's nature is such that he
demands to be free, the Soviets
shall never rule the world. If man
can be ruled by force, he will be
ruled by force. Whatever con
trols man's nature will ultimately
control man himself. If war re
mains at the forefront of his list
of alternatives, it will always
dominate his life.
I used to think man was in con
trol of his own destiny, that he
could change the course of his
tory. I see now that he can't do

that until he can change himself.
In a few short days, the
American people have decided
that draft registration is going to
help save the free world. They
have jumped at the opportunity
to face military threats with
equal military threats; the op
portunity to increase the number
of times mankind can annihilate
itself with nuclear weapons;
the opportunity to increase ten
sions and create an armed force
ready and poised to engage in
combat.
I see the tacit acceptance of
war as the alternative to gasoline
rationing and greatly increased
conservation. Too many parents
are willing to send their sons to
Pakistan to die for a mere 15
percent of the oil that enables
them to drive their own cars to
work, or to keep the lights in the
other room lit. As for preserving
the free world. I find it difficult to
believe that Pakistan is more im
portant than were Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
If Carter has an army of three
million men. all prepared to
fight, he may believe he can win a
war in the Persian Gulf. 1 can't
trust my brother's life to a presi
dent who has vowed military ac
tion in an area where victory for
us by conventional force is im
possible.
Two roads diverged in a yel
low wood . . . Man has always
taken the road most traveled by,
that of war. There are many
other roads to choose from, even
though they remain as yet un
explored and little used. One of
them is resisting a draft registra
tion which would only increase
our ability to make war unneces
sarily. Another is changing the
way we live, to see the poten
tially disastrous effect of our ina
bility to conserve.
America, you have chosen the
more traveled road. You have
chosen the draft registration,
providing a greater potential for
conflict than existed before. You
have chosen to make yourself
weak by wasting your valuable
resources. You have chosen to
live by the sword . . .
Yet, you need not die by the
sword. Turn off your lights, ride
your bicycle, recycle your waste,
and resist draft registration.

resort to "tactical" nuclear
weapons, but we can't win a con
ventional war. not in their back
yard. We are not invincible,
especially in the face of the harsh
realities of fighting in a foreign

land, ten thousand miles from
our borders. Moreover our al
lies, who depend on Persian Gulf
oil far more than we, haven't
even mentioned sending in
troops.
We are as close to world war
now as we have been in thirty
five years. Nothing radical has
changed in the past six months;
the Soviets had a puppet regime
in Afghanistan two years ago.
While Soviet tanks are certainly
unjustifiable, we've seen them
before. We didn't send troops
into Hungary in 1956 or
Czechoslovakia in 1968, when
we might have stood a chance.
The Hungarian people fought
bravely and with determination ,
and we were at the peak of our
post war strength, But Ameri
cans still remembered the reality
that was world war.
We seem to have forgotten
that now. We make bold state
ments daring the Soviets to take
another step. We're just waiting
to go in there and show those
guys the stuff we're made of, like
so many school boys brawling in
a playground. The kind of
strength we're trying to show
may very well have led to war in
1914. Our real strength can
never lie in creating a giant army
or making threats we can't carry
out.
Our strength lies in our ability
to rely on ourselves, in our ability
to respond with determination in
the face of difficulty. We can
eliminate our dependence on
foreign oil — not today, but we
can start. We can show restraint,
and we can overcome the prob
lems which threaten to provoke
what would be an unnecessary
war.
Mankind has gone to war since
the beginning of time in search of
solutions that can come only
from within. War never provides
the solutions, it only compounds
the problems.
If man's nature is such that he
demands to be free, the Soviets
shall never rule the world. If man
can be ruled by force, he will be
ruled by force. Whatever con
trols man's nature will ultimately
control man himself. If war re
mains at the forefront of his list
of alternatives, it will always
dominate his life.
I used to think man was in con
trol of his own destiny, that he
could change the course of his
tory. I see now that he can't do

that until he can change himself.
In a few short days, the
American people have decided
that draft registration is going to
help save the free world. They
have jumped at the opportunity
to face military threats with
equal military threats; the op
portunity to increase the number
of times mankind can annihilate
itself with nuclear weapons;
the opportunity to increase ten
sions and create an armed force
ready and poised to engage in
combat.
I see the tacit acceptance of
war as the alternative to gasoline
rationing and greatly increased
conservation. Too many parents
are willing to send their sons to
Pakistan to die for a mere 15
percent of the oil that enables
them to drive their own cars to
work, or to keep the lights in the
other room lit. As for preserving
the free world. I find it difficult to
believe that Pakistan is more im
portant than were Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
If Carter has an army of three
million men. all prepared to
fight, he may believe he can win a
war in the Persian Gulf. 1 can't
trust my brother's life to a presi
dent who has vowed military ac
tion in an area where victory for
us by conventional force is im
possible.
Two roads diverged in a yel

that of war. There are many
other roads to choose from, even
though they remain as yet un

our ability to make war unneces

America, you have chosen the
more traveled road. You have
chosen the draft registration,
providing a greater potential for
conflict than existed before. You
have chosen to make yourself
weak by wasting your valuable
resources. You have chosen to
live by the sword . . .
Yet, you need not die by the
sword. Turn off your lights, ride
your bicycle, recycle your waste,
and resist draft registration.
