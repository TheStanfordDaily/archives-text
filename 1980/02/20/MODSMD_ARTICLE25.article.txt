Letter from Mom
My dearest daughter.
Twenty years ago on a golden
autumn day. I walked home after
work frorr the doctor's office
kicking rusty leaves and smiling
to myself. He had confirmed that
you were on the way. I was very
happy.
In spring of 1980 you'll be 20.
Who would have ever thought in
two decades we would consider
the registration and drafting of
young women plus young men? I
had always felt a little smug —
with two daughters, I'd never
have to bear the pain of losing a
son in war.
And now this.
Sunday as we spoke on the
phone, you'll never know how
proud of you I was. You spoke
clearly of your thoughts and feel
ings, of what you plan to do. You
said, "Yes, I'm going to register
if it comes to that — I don't want
any hassle with the law. I'm car
rying a heavy load this quarter
and jail is not conducive to study
ing. But I won't be drafted."
How proud of you I am. You
are on the line, my darling. Not
me. When this country needs
fair, fat and 48-year-old ladies
with Clairol-dyed hair to lead its
armies, we're all in bad shape.
Thus, I can be safe and detached,
much like a few senile con
gressmen in their 70s who can't
lift, let alone focus an M-l.
I am trying to say I believe in
you, in your judgment and in
your strong capability to do what
is right in any given situation at
any given moment. Your dad
and I tried for two decades to
guide you always to make the
wisest and soundest decision for
yourself.
If you choose not to be
drafted, if you choose to go to
Canada or the Fiji Islands — I
will understand and I will sup

port you. You are my beloved
daughter, and I believe in you.
Lovingly,
Mom

If the following demands are

we will cause a simulUlneous
crash of the disk drives at all
campus computer facilities next

1) Fire the existing food ser

2) Install ant crosswalks in
areas of high pedestrian traffic —
we're tired of being stepped on.
3) Give us a fee assessment (to
finance our annual picnic.)
4) Exempt us from the draft.
5) Create a new major: insect

You must meet these demands
or face another crash, just when
CS 10X finals are due! We
realize that a respectable ter

made its demands known much
sooner, but do you know how
long it takes an ant to type?

Concert seats rip-off
My husband and I were liter
ally ripped-oft last Thursday
night at the Willie Nelson eon
cert. We drove from San Fran
cisco for an hour, paid SIS for
tickets and $20 for a babysitter
in order to come. Then where
did our tickets have us?
Right behind a huge stack of
speakers where we could not see
at all. M> husband spoke to any
people he could find in authority

and everyone just shrugged
their shoulders. There must
have been at least 30 or 40 seats
at $9 apiece that were
useless. While this "theft" is not
quite as big as Watergate, the
dishonesty is as blatant.
1 assume there is someone re
sponsible for this, hut not being
familiar with your concert set
up. I don't know who.
I just wanted to register my
complaint and let someone
know that I won't he coming to
Stanford for any other concerts
and will encourage my friends
not to do so either.

Logic is missing
Though I disagree with the
reasoning of those who feel that
draft registration is necessary. I
do understand it. It simply seems
that those who favor registration
are overrating the military threat
to the United States. However,
the opinions of people like David
Forsythe {Daily, Feb. 12) who
favor a return to the draft itself
have such little basis in fact that
the logic behind their views
completely escapes me.
What people like Forsythe fail
to realize is that the United
States can no longer dominate
world affairs by using military
force or the threat of it. The Un
ited States must begin using
other means to solve major in
ternational problems, rather
than basing its foreign presence
on a military developed at the
expense of its citizens' basic
freedoms. What is needed in this
time of international crisis is
reasonable thinking, not a blind
rush into another Vietnam.

In spring of 1980 you'll be 20.
Who would have ever thought in
two decades we would consider
the registration and drafting of
young women plus young men? I
had always felt a little smug —
with two daughters, I'd never
have to bear the pain of losing a
son in war.
And now this.
Sunday as we spoke on the
phone, you'll never know how
proud of you I was. You spoke
clearly of your thoughts and feel
ings, of what you plan to do. You
said, "Yes, I'm going to register
if it comes to that — I don't want
any hassle with the law. I'm car
rying a heavy load this quarter
and jail is not conducive to study
ing. But I won't be drafted."
How proud of you I am. You
are on the line, my darling. Not
me. When this country needs
fair, fat and 48-year-old ladies
with Clairol-dyed hair to lead its
armies, we're all in bad shape.
Thus, I can be safe and detached,
much like a few senile con
gressmen in their 70s who can't
lift, let alone focus an M-l.
I am trying to say I believe in
you, in your judgment and in
your strong capability to do what
is right in any given situation at
any given moment. Your dad
and I tried for two decades to
guide you always to make the
wisest and soundest decision for
yourself.
If you choose not to be
drafted, if you choose to go to
Canada or the Fiji Islands — I
will understand and I will sup

port you. You are my beloved
daughter, and I believe in you.
Lovingly,
Mom

Computers hostage
We, the Ants for Liber
tarianism Coalition of Insect Or
ganizations (AFL-CIO) hereby
claim responsibility for the head
crash at LOTS.
If the following demands are
not met by March 15 of this year,
we will cause a simulUlneous
crash of the disk drives at all
campus computer facilities next
dead week. We are in control!
1) Fire the existing food ser
vice. (Even we think it stinks.)
2) Install ant crosswalks in
areas of high pedestrian traffic —
we're tired of being stepped on.
3) Give us a fee assessment (to
finance our annual picnic.)
4) Exempt us from the draft.
5) Create a new major: insect
relations.
You must meet these demands
or face another crash, just when
CS 10X finals are due! We
realize that a respectable ter
rorist organization should have
made its demands known much
sooner, but do you know how
long it takes an ant to type?

Concert seats rip-off
My husband and I were liter
ally ripped-oft last Thursday
night at the Willie Nelson eon
cert. We drove from San Fran
cisco for an hour, paid SIS for
tickets and $20 for a babysitter
in order to come. Then where
did our tickets have us?
Right behind a huge stack of
speakers where we could not see
at all. M> husband spoke to any
people he could find in authority

and everyone just shrugged
their shoulders. There must
have been at least 30 or 40 seats
at $9 apiece that were
useless. While this "theft" is not
quite as big as Watergate, the
dishonesty is as blatant.
1 assume there is someone re
sponsible for this, hut not being
familiar with your concert set
up. I don't know who.
I just wanted to register my
complaint and let someone
know that I won't he coming to
Stanford for any other concerts
and will encourage my friends
not to do so either.

Logic is missing
Though I disagree with the
reasoning of those who feel that
draft registration is necessary. I
do understand it. It simply seems
that those who favor registration
are overrating the military threat
to the United States. However,
the opinions of people like David
Forsythe {Daily, Feb. 12) who
favor a return to the draft itself
have such little basis in fact that
the logic behind their views
completely escapes me.
What people like Forsythe fail
to realize is that the United
States can no longer dominate
world affairs by using military
force or the threat of it. The Un
ited States must begin using
other means to solve major in
ternational problems, rather
than basing its foreign presence
on a military developed at the
expense of its citizens' basic
freedoms. What is needed in this
time of international crisis is
reasonable thinking, not a blind
rush into another Vietnam.

My dearest daughter.
Twenty years ago on a golden

work frorr the doctor's office
kicking rusty leaves and smiling
to myself. He had confirmed that
you were on the way. I was very
happy.
