# New Orleans' Mardi Gras returns

### Bill Crider Associated Press Wilier 
NE* W OKI.HANS — An esti
mated one million people turned
out for a horn-again Mardi Gras
yesterday, filling the I rench
Quarter with hard-drinking re
velers and packing parade routes
with spectators, just like the
good old hashes before the I 979
police strike.
Instead of bitter tensions and
National Guard troops on every
downtown corner, this Mardi
Gras was sunkissed and laid
back.
Once again Rex. King of Car
nix al. led his splendidly glittering
procession through the crowds
shrieking for the necklaces and
doubloons from the floats.
Zulu, chieftain of the blacks,
loomed majestically over his
parade, blessing chosen folk with

gilded coconuts.
No accurate crowd count was
possible, but police estimated
that one million people were out
for the great day, the climax of
Carnival, in New Orleans and
suburbs.
In keeping with desegrega
tion. Zulu hired Woody I lerman
and his latest big-band herd to
blow jazz for the Zulu Ball — the
tirst white band to handle the gig.
The fact that Zulu "krewe
men" included the Rev. Jesse
Jackson, a renowned black ac
tivist, marked the extent ot
changing attitudes since the late
19605, when many blacks re
garded the krewe as racially de
meaning.
Comic gorillas, Arab sheiks in
sheets, women in sheer body
stockings, clowns on roller
skates, knights in armor and

similar costumed celebrators
roamed the streets.
In case spirits flagged, worn
down by weeks of Carnival, a lot
of out-of-town help was at hand.
"A lot of people don't know
how to have a good time, and we
came down here to help them,"
said Edward Thompson of Bos
ton. Equipped with tambourines
to supply the beat, he and four
other Bosjonians danced
through the seething quarter.
Actually, not enough out-of
town help came to satisfy offi
cials of the tourist industry,
which ranks just behind the port
in the money crop here.
Of 20,000 hotel-motel rooms,
500 were reported unsold at the
start of Mardi Gras weekend.
Ilotelmen were reduced to rent
ing rooms for one night only for a
mere $75 — a glum comedown

from the haughty requirement
that a Mardi-Gras reservation
had to he a three-day package.
The Quarter was packed early.
By 10 a.m., a lew early birds .it
ready were slumped peacefully
in doorways, oblivious to the
passing throng.
Police looked on with genial
disregard.
Sgt. R.A. Drouant, who was
walking a picket line during last
year's spree, said this crowd was
so large the department had
"scraped the bottom of the bar
rel"' to put extra men on the
streets.
"But this looks like a good
crowd," said Drouant. "Mardi
Gras crowds are usually less
trouble than Carnival crowds,
because by the time Mardi Ciias
rolls around everybody is pretty
well mellowed out."
