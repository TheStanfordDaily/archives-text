## 'Tassie' tough, but worthwhile

beginning of this century generated many
great plays, yet they are seldom seen 111 this

O Casey, only Synge's The Playboy of the
Western World is produced regularly.
Beneath this seeming neglect lies the fact
tli.it American actors, especially young ones,
are unsuited for these plays, which draw on a
long cultural and linguistic tradition largely
alien to them. In selecting Sean O'Casey's

is the Irish dialect. There are as many
brogues as there are cast members, none of

great facility with colloquial Irish speech.
I his is actually a fault ol the play's:
O'Casey was attempting to write poetic
drama, but lie wasn't a very good poet. Good
Irish actors can make the play sound poetic:
in the Little Theater it sounded mannered,
literary, and overly rhetorical.
While this prevents the production from

being wholly successful. The Silver Tiissie is
still a play worth seeing. O'Casey's greatness
is two-sided: lie had seen terrible human suf
fering and could present it vividly on the
stage, but he also had a wonderful comic
touch. It is the humor in his plays, not the
Christian symbolism or religious rhetoric,

through in the current production.
O'Casey used stock characters — most ot
his plays have burlesqued authority figures,
young men and women just coming into the
light ill se\ and politics, and a pair of old
codgers going back into the dark. Sylvester
Heegan and Simon Norton, played by Brent
Shaphren and Larry Kaiser, are The Silver

verbal battle through out the play, an ex
change equally dramatic and farcical.
Kaiser and Shaphren are excellent, captur
ing both the uneasiness and the vitality of the
two old men. Also very good, in a minor
comic role, is Kick Clyne. who plays a British
"visitor" to the front. Obviously aristocratic,
he complains of not being allowed to
"plunge." and then plunges behind a soldier
hilling from imaginary bombers.
