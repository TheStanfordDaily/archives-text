# Kihn delivers a driving, convincing show
## 
### 
"Let's rock tins place!"
C>retz Kihn has shouted that in
high school gyms, various clubs
and 20.0()0-seat arenas tor
nearly five >ears now. and even it
the slogan sounded a little tired,
he had no trouble deli \ eringon n
in two shows Saturday night in
the Tresidder Ballroom.
Acoustically. the 350-seat bal
lroom is just adequate, but sight
lines are extremely good — tar
better than those in San Francis
co's Old W aldorf, for example.
Daily Planet, a lively, sell
consciously •"new wave" four
man group out ot Los Angeles,
opened the shows. Like most
so-called new wave. Planet
didn't have anything different to
otter, but they partially made up
for it with a loud, irrepressible
energy.
Drive
Kihn's show lacked the rather
desperate force ol Planet's, but
thot's mostly understandable:
when you're .it the brink ot na
tional success, getting up tor yet

another show in front ot 300-odd
people starts to become a little
tough.
> et while the show wasn't
nearly the most inspired perfor
mance he's ever given. Kihn's
12-song set was always driving,
tight and professional.
The set didn't feature some ot
Kihn's best material — "'Cold

Hard Cash." Bruce Springs
teen's short rocker " Rendezv
ous." the melodic "Remember"
— but he'd already played many
o' those songs in the earlier
show. Instead, the band went
back to its first two albums for
the two opening songs. "All the
Right Reasons" and "Madison

Avenue Man."
"Only Dance." a sensuous,
moody rocker from Kihn's
soon-to-be-released new album
Cilass House Hock followed. The
Glass House material seems to
be a clear attempt to reach the
growing power pop audience
with punchy, basic three-minute
songs. Another song from the

new album. "Desire Me." a bal
lad with a breathy Kihn vocal,
seems more in the style of Kihn's
earlier material, but it's an ex
ception.
Drummer Larry Lynch, whose
playing was at its usual high
lev el. took up the vocal chores on
"Pay You Back (With In

terest).'" an old Hollies song
which may be on the new album.
1 he early part of the show was
full of highlights, but the band
didn't really shitt gears until the
last three songs ot the regular set.
beginning with "Night After
Night." a booming rocker.
Guitarist Dave Carpcnder. who
until then had been content to

stay in the background, tmallv
began to flash some of his ever
growing talent in this number.
"Secret Meetings" and
" Roadrunner." two ot Kihn's
best stage songs, finished the
regular set. "Meetings" is a per
fect set piece for Kihn. with a
howling vocal and lots ot oppor

tunitios tor theatrical stage
mo\ es.
" Roadrunner," a classic
Joh na than Richmann number,
has long been Kihn's closing
song, with its lyric "we're in love
with rock 'n" roll" serv ing as a
great moment tor Kihn to join
with the audience. He even
threw in some verses of "My
Generation" during the song.
The Yardbirds" "lor Your
Love' was Kihn's first encore.
Bassist Steve Wright filled the
song with superb solos and also
contributed some lead vocals.
With his last song, a destruc
tive. dense and very loud version
of the pounding "Museum."
Kihn delivered the knock-out
punch he always seems to come
up with in Ins shows. Whether he
can convince people with his new
album and probable national
tour is still an open question, but
there's no doubt that he made a
lot of people true believers
Saturday night.
