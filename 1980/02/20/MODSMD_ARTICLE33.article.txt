# Familiar fare, but fun

l ast Wednesday's program at
the San Francisco Symphony was
nearly equal parts sturm itml
({rang and schnialt/. No matter
what anyone tells you, though, a
little ol both can sometimes he
good tor the soul — and fun to
listen to, as well.
Guest conductor Stanislaw
Skrowaczewski led the orchestra
in a mostly familiar program:
Brahm's Third Symphony.
Bloch's Schelomo: Hebraic
Rhapsody for Solo Cello and
Large Orchestra, and Stravins
ky's Firebird Suite, replacing a
previously announced work hy
Skrowac/ewski himself. All
three pieces called lor large
orchestral forces, especially in
the string sections. Skrowac
/ewski's conducting style is large
and hold, well-suited to the de
mands of a massed orchestra.
The faults in Wednesday's
performance ol the Brahm's
Third were mostly those typical
ol a large orchestra playing a
very familiar work under a
strange director. The orchestra's
enthusiasm wasn't always equal
to what Skrowac/ewski asked of

them:coordination,especially in
the large string sections, was
often ragged.
Some tine individual perfor
mances offset ensemble prob
lems. Arthur Krehhiel's horn
solo in the third movement, for
instance, was at once precise and
lyrical, while the horn section as
a whole had difficulty with into
nation. Skrowaczewski's in
terpretation of the Brahms em
phasized its dramatic contrasts,
and I lound the results generally

happy.
Michael Cirebanier turned in a
restrained, well-judged perfor
mance of Bloch's Sclieloino.
Cirebanier has been the Sym
phony's principal cellist since
1976, and has proved himsell in
valuable. one of the best people
to come to the orchestra in a long
time.
Schelomo is a hodge-podge of
vaguely international flavors: a
little Hebraism here, a little
Orientalism there. Wednesday's
performance lacked any overrid
ing intention, but the fault may
be Bloch's rather than the or
chestra's.
This year begins the celebra
tion ol Bloch's centenary, and
the Symphony plans several
more Bloch concerts. Yehudi
Menuhin will be the soloist in the
19X0-N1 season for the Bloch
Violin Concerto, perhaps his
most famous work. Schelomo is
colorful, but the best efforts ol
Skrowac/ewski and Cirebanier
could not give it much direction.
The Inchird Saite is a sure
winner in concert. Scrowac
/ewski conducted the 112 irebird,
as lie had the Brahms, from
memory The orchestra got off to
a quiet start; the introduction
and first two dances of the suite
were neatly executed hut not
quite tense enough. The wood
winds and strings seemed to be
studiously counting measures
and playing their hits when re
quired. rather than answering to
each other.
I lic downbeat of the Infernal
Dance, however, turned the
piece around. The orchestra
exploded with energy and kept
the level up through the Ber
ceuse and I male. I have heard
the San Francisco Symphony do
a better 112 irebird, but that was in
1977 under O/awa, and the
comparison is probably not fair
to a visiting conductor. Scrowac
zewski's 112 irebird was a suitably
dramatic finale to *a rather
broadly romantic program.
This week the San Francisco
Symphony will be performing
Beethoven's Concerto No.
5 and Dvorak's Symphony No. 9,
the New World. Kurt Masur will
conduct and Claudio Arrau is the
scheduled pianist. Perhaps I
should take the Symphony and
its guest conductors to task for
unadventurous programming,
but I like the Emperor Concerto
and the New World Symphony.
Like last week's concert, this
week's program is familiar and
accessible. So enjoy; it's some
times all l ight to like the familiar.
