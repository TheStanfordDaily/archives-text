# Matthews shines in taut 'Virginia Woolf'
## 
### 
For those blessed with good
night vision, the California Ac
tors Theatre production of Ed
ward Albee's Who s Afraid of
Virginia Woolf is definitely
worth a trip to Los Gatos to see.
Seeing well in the dark will
serve two purposes — lirst, Los
Ciatos can be hard to find at
night: and second, your seat can
be hard to find when the house
lights are extinguished while hall
the audience is still in the lobby.
That's what happened at the
Sequoia Fox Theatre in Red
wood City, the CAT's other
home, on opening night; the sec
ond and third acts commenced
w bile couples stumbled dow 11 the
aisle, often slinking to the
nearest available seats and then
darting ahead live rows when
there was a break in the action.
Why did the CAT choose to
embarrass a good share of its
opening night crowd? Perhaps
they were just teaching tis a les
son; the obliviousness ol most
audiences to bells and flashing
lights could lead any theate/
management to rightoous indig
nation. II such was the case in
Redwood City, then I say more
power to the CAT.
But I suspect that there was a
more cerebral justification for
their action. In the program
notes. Dakin Matthews (who
played George) dwelt on the
theme of games; how the action
is structured as a series of games,
and the degrees to which the dif
ferent characters realize this.
So. if the characters know

they're playing games, and the
actors know they're playing
roles, then we should know that
they know so that everyone
knows that it's all a big game.
Therefore, you turn the lights oil
early: because asking (or being
asked) "What aisle is this?"
while the show goes on is a good
way to lose*,your cozy illusions
about "lite" on the stage.
I don't think that Matthews
really knows what Albee had in
mind: he gives Albee credit tor a
more coherent conception ol the
pla\ than Albee is capable of, but
that hardly matters. What counts
is that Matthews, a college pro
fessor himself, thoroughly un
derstands the character ol
George, aging history professor
at a small private college and fai
lure at just about everything his
wife considers important.
None of the other performers
William Moreing. Catherine
Buttcrfield. and Kandis Chap
pell as Nick. Honey, and
George's wife Martha — stand
out (Moreing and Buttcrfield
often resemble refugees from a
junior high one-act), but it
doesn't matter. Matthews domi
nates the play just as George
controls the parlor games, mak
ing sure the other players take
their positions and hear their
cues, and never letting the pace
drop.
Who's Afraid of Virginia
Wool) does not stand up to much
analysis. Albee's message ap
pears to be that the World would

be a nicer place without women
and parents, a place vvhere harm
less classicists like George could
chase truth and wine and not
have to bother with the ambi
tions and desires of, well, women
and parents.
To disguise the thinness of his
intent. Albee has fattened out
the dialogue, most ol it brilliant.
The play could have
been merelv sin ill; Albee lias

made it almost unbearably
funny, and Matthews em
phasizes this.
Matthews, besides setting the
tone for the entire play (I would
guess that he deserved credit as
codirector) rises George above
Albee's rhetoric and shows us
the man underneath. He man
ages to make George funny,
without becoming pathetic; and
he convinces us that, whatever

the game. George is in some
small way a winrer.

from Edward Alhee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
For those blessed with good
night vision, the California Ac
tors Theatre production of Ed
ward Albee's Who s Afraid of
Virginia Woolf is definitely
worth a trip to Los Gatos to see.
Seeing well in the dark will
serve two purposes — lirst, Los
Ciatos can be hard to find at
night: and second, your seat can
be hard to find when the house
lights are extinguished while hall
the audience is still in the lobby.
That's what happened at the
Sequoia Fox Theatre in Red
wood City, the CAT's other
home, on opening night; the sec
ond and third acts commenced
w bile couples stumbled dow 11 the
aisle, often slinking to the
nearest available seats and then
darting ahead live rows when
there was a break in the action.
Why did the CAT choose to
embarrass a good share of its
opening night crowd? Perhaps
they were just teaching tis a les
son; the obliviousness ol most
audiences to bells and flashing
lights could lead any theate/
management to rightoous indig
nation. II such was the case in
Redwood City, then I say more
power to the CAT.
But I suspect that there was a
more cerebral justification for
their action. In the program
notes. Dakin Matthews (who
played George) dwelt on the
theme of games; how the action
is structured as a series of games,
and the degrees to which the dif
ferent characters realize this.
So. if the characters know

they're playing games, and the
actors know they're playing
roles, then we should know that
they know so that everyone
knows that it's all a big game.
Therefore, you turn the lights oil
early: because asking (or being
asked) "What aisle is this?"
while the show goes on is a good
way to lose*,your cozy illusions
about "lite" on the stage.
I don't think that Matthews
really knows what Albee had in
mind: he gives Albee credit tor a
more coherent conception ol the
pla\ than Albee is capable of, but
that hardly matters. What counts
is that Matthews, a college pro
fessor himself, thoroughly un
derstands the character ol
George, aging history professor
at a small private college and fai
lure at just about everything his
wife considers important.
