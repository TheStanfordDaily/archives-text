Khomeini approves U.N. panel
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr of Iran said yes
terday that Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the coun
try's revolutionary leader, has approved the final
terms of a U.N.-appointed commission and its con
vening in Tehran to investigate charges against the
ousted shah.
Bani-Sadr told reporters in Tehran following a
meeting of the ruling Revolutionary Council that a
cattle was to be sent to U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim, who chose the five-member commission,
informing him of Iran's decision.
Two members of the commission were reported in
Geneva, Switzerland, and the other three were ex
pected to arrive this morning, U.N. officials there
said. They said the commission members and a small
U.N. support staff could leave Geneva for Tehran
this morning.
Earlier yesterday. Khomeini turned over his post
as commander-in-chief of the armed forces to Bani-
Sadr. stirring speculation that troops might be moved
into the U.S. Embassy in Tehran to replace militants
holding American hostages there.
Tehran Radio, announcing Bani-Sadr's
strengthened authority, quoted the ailing 79-year
old Khomeini as saying the appointment was aimed at
"consolidating power in Iran at this critical moment."
The president has been more moderate in his stand
against the United States than have the militants, who
have steadily insisted they would not release some 50
Americans from the embassy until the deposed shah
is returned to answer charges of corruption.
Since Ins election Bani-Sadr has spoken out
stronglv against the militants' independent power.
His new job should gi\e him the muscle todeal with
the crisis at the embassy, which the militants took
over Nov. 4.
An indication the militants were softening their
stand came in a report from the official Yugoslav
news agency Tanjug. It said a statement yesterday
from the militants was for the first time not explicit in
demands the shah be returned before the release.
Tanjug did not elaborate, but it quoted the militants
as saying they had neither accepted nor rejected the
international commission being set up to investigate
the shah. That. too. appeared to be a marked change
in tone.
Carter holds to Olympic boycott
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
refused to back away from his demand that the Soviet
Union get out of Afghanistan by today or risk U.S.
refusal to participate in the Summer Olympics.
The "deadline is tomorrow — and if will not be
changed." Carter told a loudly ohepring convention
of the American Legion. The president also told the
organization's annual conference that as many as
100.000 Russian troops were occupying Afghanis
tan.
The Soviet Union has given no signal that it would
remove its forces during month that has elapsed since
Carter first issued the demand on Jan.2o.
Asked what would happen today, when the dead
linearrives. White House press secretary Jody Powell
said "we have made our position very clear. The
question now addresses itself to the United States
Olympic Commitee."
"We would like for them to reach a decision as
soon as they can." he said at a White House briefing
for reporters.
One White House source, asking not to be named
publicly, said: "There's nothing new. No one ex
pected the Soviets would be out by the 20th. I don't
think the day has any particular significance."
The source, who has been involved in the interna
tional effort to round up support for Carter's Olympic
stand, said "about 50 governments publicly and pri
vately seem to be in favor."
The White House source would not list those na

tions, hut said they include several in Africa, most of
the Islamic nations — upset over the occupation of
fiercely religious Afghanistan — and allies in Europe,
as well as Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
He said discussions are under way with other na
tions to pick s<tcs for an alternative sports competi
tion this summer.
"We are no longer talking about a single site for all
events." the source said. He said the administration
would prefer that alternative games he held outside
of the United States, "for reasons of international
policy ," meaning that Carter did not want to set up a
sports fete in direct competition with the Olympics to
he held in Moscow.
Afghanistan neutrality proposed
ROME — The nine-nation European Common
Market called yesterday for an international guaran
tee of Afghanistan's neutrality to induce Moscow to
withdraw at the same time, the foreign ministers of
the nine countries decided to postpone any joint re
sponse to the proposed boycott of the Moscow
Olympics until the Soviets reply to the neutrality
plan, conference sources said.
In a joint statement following a day-long meeting
here, the ministers declared that the Afghan crisis
"could be overcome constructively through an ar
rangement which allows a neutral Afghanistan to be
outside the competition among the powers."
"Obviously, the Western nations are offering a
face-saving device for the Soviet Union to pull out
gracefully," said a high conference official who asked
not to he identified.
British and West German officials said the prop
osal. put forward by British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington, had been discussed with the U.S. gov
ernment in advance.
Carrington told a news conference that he had in
mind the model used to guarantee Austria's neutral
ity in 1955 by the four major powers — the United
States, the Soviet Union, France and Britain.
On the Olympics question, the ministers agreed to
take a wait-and-see attitude until the Soviet views are
made known on the neutrality proposal, the sources
said.
The Common Market proposal will be explained to
U.S. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance who was to
arrive in Bonn later yesterday for a four-day swing
through West Germany. Italy. France and Britain.
The statement said the ministers stressed in par
ticular that the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan
"remains their objective and that they will endeavor
to establish the conditions for this."

Proposed oil limits rejected
PARIS — The United States failed yesterday in
efforts to persuade the 19 other members of the
International Energy Agency (lEA) to set an across
the-board percentage cut in their petroleum imports
for 19X0.
A number of the others, led by West Germany,
raised a series of objections to that approach at a
meeting ot the lEA governing board here Monday
and yesterday.
This seemed to reflect a reduced sense of urgency
about the need to cut back on oil consumption since
there is a large surplus in the market recently esti
mated by lEA Director Ulf Lantzke at more than one
million barrels a day.
U.S. officials also expressed disappointment that a
ministerial meeting originally scheduled for late

March to review members' oil-conservation prog
ranis was pushed hack to May.
The U.S. officials said the delay means that it will
be practically impossible to set meaningful goals for
cutting oil consumption for this year. They said they
hoped the meeting could at least get an early start in
setting reductions for 1981.
In place of an IEA-wide percentage decrease in oil
imports this year, the members agreed on a flexible
s\ stem that takes into account a variety of factors like
the need not to harm West Germany's healthy
economic growth, Turkey's need to stimulate growth
to get out of its political crisis, the need for intensive
heating in the cold winters of Scandinavia and the
concern by countries that have already cut back a
great deal that they not be asked to cut still further
while there are countries that have done very little so
far.
Court orders abortion funding
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday
ordered the federal government to pay for most abor
tions wanted b\ women on welfare — at least until the
court decides the emotion-laden issue later this year.
In a one-sentence order, the justices refused to
sidetrack a federal judge's order forcing the govern
ment to pay for medically necessary abortions for
poor women.
In his decision. Judge Dooling said Medicaid
money for medically necessary abortions must he
available to eligible women as is money for childbirth
costs.
The judge's broad definition of "medically neces
sary" went beyond physical health to include the best
interest of a woman's mental and social well-being.
Registration of women not likely
WASHINGTON' — President Jimmy Carter's
proposal to require women to register for the draft
will be stopped in its tracks early next month, the
House chairman handling the legislation said yester
day.
Chairman Richard White (D-Tex.) of the House
Military Personnel Subcommittee, in making that flat
prediction in an interview, added that it will then be
up to Carter to decree registration of men only by
executive order.
Congress is in no mood to mandate registration of
men, far less women, White said, because the White
House "fought us tooth and nail last year" when the
House Armed Services Committee approved a bill to
register 18-year-old males.
The committee did its job last year by getting "the
national dialogue" started on the need for draft re
gistration and now it is up to Carter to use the author
ity he already has on the books to begin registering
men. White said.
Only the registration of women, not men, requires
congressional action. Since the idea of registering
women has no chance of becoming law. White said
the path is clear for Carter to proceed on his own with
the male registration that he opposed last year.
