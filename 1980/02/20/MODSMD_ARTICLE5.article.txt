# 95,000 lose power in N. Cal
## Storms batter California 
### Associated Press 
A tornado, thunderstorm and whip
ping winds tore through Northern
California yesterday, leaving behind
widespread power outages, rain
swollen rivers, minor injuries and
death.
More than 95,000 customers
throughout Northern California ex
perienced power outages Monday and
yesterday due to the inclement
weather, said Roberta Palm, spokes
woman for Pacific, Gas & Electric. Of
those, 4800 customers in the Santa
Cruz mountains were still without
power late yesterday.
And mudslides and flooding spread
further across Southern California,
where a week of storms had already
dumped a foot of rain and caused $100
million damage.
With at least 18 persons dead in
California, thousands homeless and
dams overflowing in some parts of the
state, rain fell relentlessly for a seventh
day. The National Guard was on alert.
Floods from the same storm system
continued to take their toll in Utah and
Arizona.
Disaster areas
Gov. Jerry Brown signed a procla
mation yesterday declaring Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and Ven
tura counties state disaster areas.
Disaster proclamations for San Ber
nardino and San Diego counties were
issued earlier this month and are still in
effect, and further requests were ex
pected from Ventura, Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo counties for disas
ter assistance.
The governor's disaster proclama
tion, issued at a news conference in Los
Angeles, makes owners of damaged
property eligible for low-interest loans
and activates a state disaster assistance
program for public property.
However, this would be superseded
by a federal disaster aid program
should the area be named a federal dis
aster area. Brown said he did not know
how long this might take.
Fresno
\ tornado ripped across the runways
of the Fresno Air Terminal yesterday,
shattering glass, tearing up roofing
from the main passenger terminal and
causing at least one injury.
The only reported injury occurred
when flying debris struck an uniden
tified person in the eye, a police
spokesman said.
There are reports of extensive dam
age at the air terminal.
The airport remained open after the

storm. However, the decision on
whether to use the runways was left to
individual pilots, officials said.
The funnel set down southwest of the
air terminal at about 2 p.m., according
to National Weather Service specialist
Ron Doran, who witnessed the tor
nado.
The cloud moved northwest across
the runways to the terminal building,
then rose into the sky, where it stayed
for at least 15 minutes, he said.
A tornado watch remained in effect
throughout the central San Joaquin
Valley for about two hours after the 2
p.m. storm.
Other funnel clouds were spotted in
the nearby cities of Laton, Visalia and
Lcmoore. There were no reports of
damage from the storms in Visalia or
Lemoore. The Laton twister tore the
roof from a garage, a sheriff s spokes
man said.
The Los Angeles area has had 20.58
inches of rain so far this season, nearly

11 inches above the normal figure for
this date, with more than half the total
coming in the last seven days. The total
is 6V2 inches more than the area usually
gets in an entire season and way ahead
of last year's 12.6 inches that had fallen
by this date.
The rains continued to eat away at
the ground under many of the area's
hillside and canyon homes, as well as
filling debris basins with tree limbs and
boulders.
Homes in the exclusive seaside area
of Malibu were threatened by erosion
from heavy surf in front, which sent one
house toppling into the ocean Sunday,
and from mud oozing down hillsides
behind them.
"The mud is up to the window sills of
one house," said Los Angeles County
sheriff s Deputy Mike Santander, but
he said deputies believe three
threatened homes can be saved by
sandbagging.

Floods from the same storm system
continued to take their toll in Utah and
Arizona.
Disaster areas
Gov. Jerry Brown signed a procla
mation yesterday declaring Los
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and Ven
tura counties state disaster areas.
Disaster proclamations for San Ber
nardino and San Diego counties were
issued earlier this month and are still in
effect, and further requests were ex
pected from Ventura, Santa Barbara
and San Luis Obispo counties for disas
ter assistance.
The governor's disaster proclama
tion, issued at a news conference in Los
Angeles, makes owners of damaged
property eligible for low-interest loans
and activates a state disaster assistance
program for public property.
However, this would be superseded
by a federal disaster aid program
should the area be named a federal dis
aster area. Brown said he did not know
how long this might take.
Fresno
\ tornado ripped across the runways
of the Fresno Air Terminal yesterday,
shattering glass, tearing up roofing
from the main passenger terminal and
causing at least one injury.
The only reported injury occurred
when flying debris struck an uniden
tified person in the eye, a police
spokesman said.
There are reports of extensive dam
age at the air terminal.
The airport remained open after the

storm. However, the decision on
whether to use the runways was left to
individual pilots, officials said.
The funnel set down southwest of the
air terminal at about 2 p.m., according
to National Weather Service specialist
Ron Doran, who witnessed the tor
nado.
The cloud moved northwest across
the runways to the terminal building,
then rose into the sky, where it stayed
for at least 15 minutes, he said.
A tornado watch remained in effect
throughout the central San Joaquin
Valley for about two hours after the 2
p.m. storm.
Other funnel clouds were spotted in
the nearby cities of Laton, Visalia and
Lcmoore. There were no reports of
damage from the storms in Visalia or
Lemoore. The Laton twister tore the
roof from a garage, a sheriff s spokes
man said.
The Los Angeles area has had 20.58
inches of rain so far this season, nearly

11 inches above the normal figure for
this date, with more than half the total
coming in the last seven days. The total
is 6V2 inches more than the area usually
gets in an entire season and way ahead
of last year's 12.6 inches that had fallen
by this date.
The rains continued to eat away at
the ground under many of the area's
hillside and canyon homes, as well as
filling debris basins with tree limbs and
boulders.
Homes in the exclusive seaside area
of Malibu were threatened by erosion
from heavy surf in front, which sent one
house toppling into the ocean Sunday,
and from mud oozing down hillsides
behind them.
"The mud is up to the window sills of
one house," said Los Angeles County
sheriff s Deputy Mike Santander, but
he said deputies believe three
threatened homes can be saved by
sandbagging.
