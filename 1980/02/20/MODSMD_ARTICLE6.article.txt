# Woman attacked
## 
### 
A female student here was attacked
near Wilbur Hall about 7:30 last night.
No suspects have been arrested.
Student witnesses said the woman
ran into nearby Rinconada in Wilbur
after she fought off her assailant. They
said she had scratch marks on her face
and neck and that her clothing was
torn. She had not been raped.
Rinconada house associates (RAs)
said the woman's description of her at
tacker matched the description of a
man who has been seen "hanging

around" Wilbur since Saturday.
RAs described the man as 5-t'oot-H,
of slight build, about 25 to 30 years old
and having very short, straight brown
hair. He is often seen wearing a green
canvas raincoat.
Sgt. Nick Brunot of the Stanford
Police Dept. detained a man fitting the
woman's description of her attacker in
a study room of Meyer Library last
night at 9. The man was later released
after the woman could not identify him
in a police line-up.
