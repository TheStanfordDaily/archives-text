# Students to serve on curriculum panels
## 
### Jan Mireles Staff Writer 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (C-US) last week approved the
membership of some ad-hoc de
partmental panels that will recommend
which courses should fulfill the seven
new distribution requirements.
Both faculty members and students
will be on the panels. C-US decided.
"Using students who are specializing
in the area is ideal," said History Prof.
Carolyn Lougee, chairman of the
C-US."
Each departmental panel will be
composed of 10-12 faculty members
and one student majoring in that de
partment. said Kevin Rhodes, student
representative to the C-US.
The departmental panels will accept
recommendations from within the de
partments and then report back to the
C-US within the next few months on
the courses they believe best fulfill the
distribution requirements.
After the C-US reviews the de
partmental recommendations, it will
present the final choices to the Faculty
Senate and the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, Herant Katchadourian.
In some departments, according to
Lougee, it will be necessary to develop
introductory courses to fulfill the re
quirements, while in other depart
ments, some courses that now fulfill the
requirements will not be satisfactory
because they are too specialized or too
advanced.

Final proposals for courses must be
completed by May 1980. All depart
ments are working to meet this dead
line.
" Every department is working fever
ishly and so far we're on schedule,"
said Lougee.
In January, the Faculty Senate ap
proved the curriculum change that
abolished the old sy stem of distribution
requirements and implemented the
Western Culture requirement and
seven new. more specific, distribution
requirements.
The seven distribution categories
are: Literature and the fine arts;
philosophical, social and religious
thought; human development, be
havior and language; social processes
and institutions; mathematical sci
ences; natural sciences; and technology
and applied sciences.
As it stands, students now attending
Stanford choose from more than 2000
classes to fulfill the nine distribution
requirements from three broad areas
â€” humanities, social sciences and
natural sciences. Under the new sys
tem, students will be required to take
10 courses rather than the nine previ
ously required.
"We don't think it's going to add any
additional burden. It will offer gui
dance and send students in different
directions," said Lougee.
Feb. 20 is the deadline for student
applications for openings still remain
ing on departmental panels.
