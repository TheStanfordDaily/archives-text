# Bank president talks up business, profits

### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
"I think what leads to greatness,
whether you're talking a nation, an in
dividual, or an institution, is a real de
sire to contribute to the furtherance of
mankind, and that can be done in lots
of walks of life."
Willard Butcher, president of the
Chase Manhattan Bank, discussed the
role of business in society and com
mented on various other aspects of the
contemporary environment in an in
terview here last week. Butcher was on
campus to give a lecture at the graduate
school of business.
Butcher became the chief executive
officer at Chase at the beginning of this
year. He replaced David Rockefeller,
who retired. Butcher graduated magna
cum laude with a B.A. from Brown in
1947, the same year he joined Chase.
He rose through the ranks, starting
as a management trainee. In 1972 he
was named president and chief operat
ing officer.
Butcher is an outspoken advocate of
big business. He does not grimace
when he mentions the word profit. His
view from the top of one of the largest
capitalistic organizations makes him
especially qualified to present the
businessman's perception of our world.
"I would hope that the students of
Stanford and other universities and

people in general have a desire to con
tribute. My view is they will have then
successful lives."
'Way to top'
When asked if this notion applied to
the world of corporate business, he re
plied: "I happen to believe that while
certainly it is not a perfect system, cer
tainly bad guys can get to the top, that
by and large, it is a system that weeds
out a lot as you go along and that the
really great business managers are
people who want to contribute and
maybe have somewhat more capacity
to contribute for a variety of reasons. 1
think that'sthe way you get to the top."
In corporate competition, where
success is often measured by profit,
Butcher has a similar formula. "In the
final analysis, you're not going to pro
duce profit if that corporation does not
contribute."
Profit adds more to our society than
money to shareholders, according to
Butcher. "In addition tp return to the
shareholders, it is the creation of
wealth that creates more jobs. It is the
creation of wealth that permits dona
tions to Stanford University. It is the
'creation of wealth that permits money
to be spent on medical research ... Is
that bad? I don't think so.
"Profits are not obscene. If we want
oil, who's going to go look for
oil? . . . Undoubtedly not the Social

Security Administration. It's going to
have to be the Exxons and the Shells
and the Mobils of this world.
"If we're concerned about the de
velopment of jobs and the putting
of. . . capital behind people, we've got
to have that profit."
Lack of expansion
Butcher cited the lack of capital ex
pansion as the chief cause of a declining
rate of productivity in the United
States.
"The problem with this nation and the
problem with our productivity is that
we're not putting enough money up to
reward the present provider of capital
or to accumulate money for the future
of the nation and the future prosperity
of the nation.
"I think the root cause of the prob
lem is that we have believed Karl Marx
that the important thing was to distri
bute wealth, and we've so believed it
that we now are distributing it to the
exclusion of creating it."
Butcher added, "We've missed the
fact that you cannot have individual
political freedom without economic
freedom. I have seen economic free
dom without political freedom but I've
never seen it the other way around."
To those who claim that only the rich
benefit from an increase in the nation's
wealth. Butcher challenges: "Show me
where the poor people are better off

than in a capitalistic country."
Butcher scoffed at the idea that big
business can control government.
While, as head of a large bank, he does
not deny that this gives him a "certain
power in this world," he also notes that
"Ralph Nader has a certain power in
the world."
Big business can only suggest and
request things from the government.
Butcher said.
"And I want you to know, I think
