# University prepares to remedy affirmative action failings
## Women sought for tenure posts 
### Andrea James News Editor 
From 1975 to 1979, professors
here were directly appointed to te
nured positions. Of these, two were
women.
This is the kind of startling statis
tic the University is trying to change
by establishing task forces that will
analyze the appointment of women
to Stanford's higher positions.
Three Provost Office task forces
are now composing lists of women
at universities across the country
who would "be valuable additions
to Stanford's tenured faculty."

In addition, the Council of Presi
dents has formed a three-member
committee to find out why women
professors here aren't moving up
Stanford's success ladder.
"Our prime focus is to identify
women whom we can bring in from
the outside to tenured positions
here," said Linguistics Prof.
Elizabeth Traugott, chair of the
Provost's task force for tenured

women in the humanities.
Political Science Prof. Nannerl
Keohane heads the task force in the
social sciences area, while Assoc.
Biology Prof. Joan Kendig chairs
the natural sciences task torce.
"We as a University have a tradi
tion of getting some people from
outside to fill the tenured positions
here," Traugott explained. I he
tradition applies to both men and
women faculty, she said.
"If all you do is move the same
professors up through the system,
you'll end up with tenured faculty
who have the same interests and the
same ways of thinking. That's why
senior appointments from the out
side are so important — they supply
a new direction," she said.
But composing a list ot outstand
ing women faculty in the United
States is considerably more difficult
than compiling a list ot equally qual
ified men, she said.
First, the pool ot mature, experi
enced women faculty is substan
tially smaller than the pool ot male
faculty, primarily because of
sociocultural reasons, she said.
"There aren't many women fa

culty in the 45-to-55 year old
range," Traugott said. "And many
of the younger women simply aren't
ready for tenured university posi
tions."
Therefore, the few women who
are eligible are being wooed by the
top universities, all of which are fac
ing the same problem as Stanford.
The task force is also faced with
the problem of trying to find women
who have expertise in areas that ful
fill the University's needs.
"We're not looking exclusively
for the traditional academic in
terests," Traugott explained. "We
are interested in women who have
purposefully developed different in
terests that the University needs.
We actively consider, among others,
people who can represent interests
not already fully represented in the
University."
Once the task forces compose the
lists of qualified women faculty,
schools and departments will be
asked to widen their searches in
such a way as to give "full considera
tion to women who are recom
mended," Provost Donald Kennedy
told the committees.
The task forces are not being
asked to explore the availability of
the women they recommend.
Meanwhile the COP task force is
distributing surveys to women fa
culty members here to identify at
titudes that may alienate women in
Stanford's academia.
"There's no way the University
will get any woman to stay here if
she doesn't feel comfortable teach
ing here," explained Mary Leßlanc,
COP member and one of the three
women on the task force.
Some of the questions the survey
asks include:
— Do you feel that you have
adequate departmental support for

your professional endeavors?
— Have you ever felt that your
research or teaching performance
came under closer scrutiny than is
usually the case due to the fact that
you are a woman?
— Are you expected to do any
additional departmental extracur
ricular as the "token" female fa
culty member in your department?
The women are also asked to say
why they think female colleagues
would be an asset to the teaching
conditions at Stanford.
The committee is asking that the
surveys be returned by Feb. 29. The
committee will then write a report
on the findings and present them to
various national women's organiza
tions as well as to the Provost's Of
fice.
