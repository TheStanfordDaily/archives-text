leaders made it clear tliey were
not buying anything, either. But
they said they were going against
a long-standing West Bank

The three leaders complained
about Israel's settlement deci
sion "in principle" to allow
Jewish civ ilians to settle in exclu
sively Arab Hebron, thereby re
versing the occupation govern

settlement in densely-populated
Arab areas, sources in the meet

manded that it Israelis are al
lowed to settle in Hebron homes

riots, \rabs should be allowed to
return to homes in Israel that
they leit in the 194N war.
Participants in the session said
McHenry carefully avoided pre
senting the United States posi
tion on autonomy. "There is a
point ol diminishing returns tel
ling them our position. They al
ready know it.and (McHenry)
understands that," a U.S. source
said.
McHenry said he came away
from the meeting with a lull un
