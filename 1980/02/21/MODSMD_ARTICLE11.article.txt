BELGRADE, Yugoslavia
(AP) — Control ot Yugoslavia
already has passed into the hands
ot the unglamorous collective
leadership designed to succeed
President Josip Bro/ Tito.
The leadership is made up of a
nine-man Presidency and a 23-
memher group in charge of the
Communist Party. They have
been in control ot Yugoslavia
ever since Tito first entered the
hospital January 3.
Tito, the N7-year-old Com
munist Party chief and
president-for-life. had his left leg
amputated Jan. 20 because circu
lation problems threatened fatal

gangrene. He is now suffering
kidney and heart complications.
Members of the Presidency
met at their circular table l ues
day to discuss unspecified or
ganizational and constitutional
issues, the national news agency .
Tanjug, said.
The meeting was chaired by
Lazar Kolisevski. the 66-year
old \ ice president who would be
come its president it Tito dies.
The Communist Party is
headed by 60-year-old Stevan
Doronjski, a wartime political
commissar who would rise to t lie
top in case of Tito's death.
Neither man would be permit-

ted to stay in office beyond
rigidly fixed terms — May in the
case of Kolise\ ski. November for
Doronjski.
Their jobs would then rotate
automatically to others who
would serve equally limited
terms.
Neither man would be able to
make big decisions on his own.
Even when Tito was healthy
enough to take an active part in
government, the system he de
signed required that all members
agree on major moves.
This was to prevent the building
ot personal power and prevent
any one ot Yugoslavia's widely
\arying political regions from
acting against the will ot another.
Still, many see a distinct assign
ment of roles among certain
members of the party leadership,
the group which appears to wield
the greater power.
Meanwhile, two cars of the
famed presidential "blue train"

waited in a railroad yard Tues
day and armed guards watched
over the entrance to the hospital
where President Josip Broz Tito
lay gravely ill in Ljubjana.
It he dies, many Yugoslavs ex
pect the train will carry the last
great leader of World War II to a
state funeral in Belgrade, possi
bly making stops en route.
Doctors treating the 87-
year-old statesman at Ljubjana
Medical Center, one of the best
hospitals in communist Eastern
Europe, said in a brief report
that his kidney problems were
"less marked." Officials refused
to elaborate on the medical
statement.
The doctors said the presi
dent's condition "continues to be
grave." "With application of ac
tive therapy, kidney insuffi
ciency problems are less marked.
Other necessary measures of in
tensive treatment are also being
applied." the statement added.
