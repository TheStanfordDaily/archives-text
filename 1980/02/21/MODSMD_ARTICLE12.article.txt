# Panel addresses U.S. policy in Nicaragua
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
The United States preferred
the 46-year reign of deposed
Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio
Somoza, to the revolutionary
Sandinista government, Richard
Fagan, professor of political sci
ence, said last week at a panel
discussion.
"The U.S. is still looking for a
non-Sandinista alternative to
Somoza," he said to 60 persons
at a discussion on "U.S. foreign
policy and the effects of the San
dinista victory." The United
States fears the Sandinista gov
ernment may become "another
Cuba," Fagen said.
Speakers on the panel noted
that Nicaragua's economic dif
ficulties pose a threat to the na
tion's stability.
Clark Reynolds, a professor
from the Food Research Insti
tute, spoke on "The Financial
Impact of Reconstruction and De
velopment." "The erosion of the
economic base is associated with
the changing political process,"
he said.

"Prior to (he revolution,
Nicaragua had a surprising
economy," he added. In com
parison to other Third World na
tions, Nicaragua had a higher
output per worker ($B3O per
capita income), a low literacy
rate {57 percent in 1975) and a
low life expectancy (55 years).
Earthquake effect
According to Reynolds, the
pre-revolutionary earthquake
which devastated Nicaragua in
1972 influenced the economy
through the short-term inflatio
nary impact of relief funds com
ing into the country.
The external assistance
"dumped liquidity on the
economy" and affected the price
level, said Reynolds. Wages and
prices were both high in the
19705.
According to Ila Moltalvo, a
Stanford graduate and panel
moderator. 70 percent of the
Nicaraguan population depends
on agriculture directly or indi
rectly.
Although Nicaragua wants to
he self-sufficient in food, "40
percent of the population
doesn't have adequate food for
survival," she said. Nicaragua is
planting some of the basic grains
in an effort at self-sufficiency. ■
Exports needed
Montalvo said that Nicaragua
must maintain agricultural ex
ports or unemployment will in
crease.
Martz Gomez of Casa
Nicaragua, a Nicaraguan support
group in the Bay Area, said that
"the honeymoon between the
U.S. and Nicaragua" will not last
forever.
The U.S. is currently giving a
$70 million package to
Nicaragua. According to Fagen,
people in the U.S. think that
"only by embracing this gov
ernment can we prevent it from
moving in the direction of
C üba."
Fears
Fagen said another ideological
U.S. fear is that Nicaragua may
work "in Nicaraguan terms."
Fagen quoted a Washington
Post article as saying that the
current Nicaraguan government
is anti-democratic since the San
danistas reserve all real power
for themselves.
