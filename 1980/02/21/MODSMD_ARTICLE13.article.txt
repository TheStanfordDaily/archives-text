# Zimbabwe voters hindered

SALISBURY, Rhodesia â€” More than half of
the eligible voters among the 230,000 Rhodesian
refugees living in neighboring countries will not
return home in time to cast ballots in the national
election at the end of the month, according to
estimates of United Nations officials.
By far, the vast majority of these people are
living in Mozambican camps that have given con
siderable support to Robert Mugabe, a Marxist
leader running in the British-run elections.
The loss of this voting support represents
another liability for Mugabe, who already faces
concerted maneuvering by his political opponents,
black and white, to reduce his election chances.
By the time polling begins Feb. 27, about 50,000
refugees are expected to have returned to
Rhodesia under the U.N.-sponsored repatriation
program, which was part of the London peace ag
reement signed in December between the biracial
government here and the guerrilla Patriotic Front
movement of Mugabe and Joshua Nkomo.
All refugees older than 18 among the estimated
63,000 living in Botswana and Zambia would be
able to return in time to vote if they wished, accord
ing to Nicholas Morris, the Salisbury-based rep
resentative of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees. However, some of the refugees in these
countries, where Nkomo had his camps, are delay
ing their return until after the election, he said.
Slower repatriation
Repatriation of the 160,000 Mozambique-based
relugees has been slower and a maximum of
20,000 will be back by Feb. 27, Morris said. U.N.

officials estimate that 50 percent of the total re
fugee population is older than 18, thus leaving
about 70,000 potential voters in Mozambique.
This amounts to about three percent of the black
Rhodesian voter population.
These people will miss the election for a variety
of reasons. Primarily the British made it physi:ally
impossible to repatriate all refugees by insisting on
a short transition period of two months before the
vote. The agreement did not guarantee that all
refugees would be brought back for the elections,
Morris said. Secondly, the repatriation program
met some initial reluctance from Rhodesian au
thorities who were "convinced that we are repat
riating heavily armed men," Morris said. The bira
cial government, as well as the white-officered
police and army, also were no doubt sensitive to the
fact that all returning voting-aged refugees were
potential supporters of the guerrilla leaders.
Their reluctance created a "bottleneck" on the
incoming flow of refugees because of the difficul
ties in finding suitable reception centers and the
limited deployment of police officers for the re
quired security checks on the returning refugees,
Morris said. But these problems have been sorted
out and the security screening is going well, he
added.
A far more serious problem, however, is the
police detention earlier this month of 70 people
returning from Zambia because they admitted to
receiving guerrilla training, Morris said. U.S. offi
cials are consulting with British authorities on the
issue but not much can be done because the Lon
don agreement stipulates that military personnel
are not supposed to return until after the election.
