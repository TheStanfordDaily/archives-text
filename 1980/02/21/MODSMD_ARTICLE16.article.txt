# Planning council to decide by 1990
## Carter orders hold on nuke waste burial 
### Lee Dembart The Los Angeles Times 
LOS ANGELES — President
Jimmy Carter's recent decision
to order further study of disposal
of highly radioactive nuclear
waste was a carefully wrought
compromise between the desires
of the nuclear industry and the
public's fears about atomic
power.
The future of nuclear power,
which Carter supports, depends
in part on solving the problem of

what to do with spent fuel rods
after they are removed from
reactors. They give off large
quantities of heat for up to 100
years and remain radioactive for
thousands of years thereafter.
The industry insists it knows
how to handle them. T he presi
dent said last week in a message
to Congress that he isn't sure.
Carter rejected the advice ol
his own Department ol I nergy,
which had taken the industry's
side and urged him to proceed

with ;i plan to bury the extremely
dangerous rods in bedded salt
deep beneath the earth's surface.
But he also threw a bone to the
industry by giving it a timetable
on which the government would
move toward a decision. At the
same time, he assured environ
mentalists that he is not going to
do anything rash. Other geologi
cal formations in addition to
bedded salt must be studied, he
said, before a decision is made.
And Carter took a step toward

solving the difficult political
problem of getting some state or
states to accept nuclear waste by
creating a State Planning Coun
cil to advise luni on all nuclear
matters.
The industry has argued con
sistently that bedded salt de
posits are the best medium for
burying the wastes because they
have been undisturbed for mill
ions of years and can be counted
on to remain undisturbed for
millions of years to come.
"We feel that we've done
enough work on salt that we're
confident with it." said Scott
Peters ot the Atomic Industrial
Porum in Washington. "We'd
like to see something put in the
ground."
When Carter announced his
decision last week, key members
ol the administration briefed
nuclear industry leaders in the
Roosevelt Room of the White
House. One utility executive
complained about what lie sees
as unnecessary delays when the
value of salt lias been proved.
Brine
Prank Press, the president's
science adviser. responded that it
had been discovered that some
salt formations contain trapped
brine and that the brine migrates
toward heat. There is tear that
the brine could corrode the con
tainers of the wastes, releasing
radioactivity into the environ
ment.
The utility executive said th.it
il that is the case, a meat deal

more work should be clone.
"The behavior of different
mediums as they are exposed on
a long-term b;isis to radioactivity
has not yet been determined to
our satisfaction." said a White
House official w ho was involved
in the president's decision.
" Chat's why the industry's asser
tion that we know how to do it is
just plain wrong."
Other mediums
In addition to s;dt. the De
partment of Energy has been or
dered to explore the possibility
ol burying the spent fuel rods in
several other mediums. The pos
sibilities include granite, tuff,
shale and salt domes.
I actors to be studied include
the ellect ol heat, fracturing of
the rock, trapped brine and other
liquids, homogeneity of the
material and the possibility of
earthquake or other destruction.
Carter tried to finesse the
major political problem through
Ins State Planning Council,
which was attacked by Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass) for not
gi\ ing the st.itcs \ cto power o\er
possible nuclear dumps within
them.
Carter's goal is to proceed
with the technical assessments of
the various burial sites while at
the s;ime time allowing the State
Planning Council to participate
in the decision-making. He
hopes that when a final decision
is made between I 955 and 19W,
the council will have been part of
that decision and will support it.

LOS ANGELES — President
Jimmy Carter's recent decision
to order further study of disposal
of highly radioactive nuclear
waste was a carefully wrought
compromise between the desires
of the nuclear industry and the
public's fears about atomic
power.
The future of nuclear power,
which Carter supports, depends
in part on solving the problem of

what to do with spent fuel rods
after they are removed from
reactors. They give off large
quantities of heat for up to 100
years and remain radioactive for
thousands of years thereafter.
The industry insists it knows
how to handle them. T he presi
dent said last week in a message
to Congress that he isn't sure.
Carter rejected the advice ol
his own Department ol I nergy,
which had taken the industry's
side and urged him to proceed

with ;i plan to bury the extremely
dangerous rods in bedded salt
deep beneath the earth's surface.
But he also threw a bone to the
industry by giving it a timetable
on which the government would
move toward a decision. At the
same time, he assured environ
mentalists that he is not going to
do anything rash. Other geologi
cal formations in addition to
bedded salt must be studied, he
said, before a decision is made.
And Carter took a step toward

solving the difficult political
problem of getting some state or
states to accept nuclear waste by
creating a State Planning Coun
cil to advise luni on all nuclear
matters.
The industry has argued con
sistently that bedded salt de
posits are the best medium for
burying the wastes because they
have been undisturbed for mill
ions of years and can be counted
on to remain undisturbed for
millions of years to come.
"We feel that we've done
enough work on salt that we're
confident with it." said Scott
Peters ot the Atomic Industrial
Porum in Washington. "We'd
like to see something put in the
ground."
When Carter announced his
decision last week, key members
ol the administration briefed
nuclear industry leaders in the
Roosevelt Room of the White
House. One utility executive
complained about what lie sees
as unnecessary delays when the
value of salt lias been proved.
Brine
Prank Press, the president's
science adviser. responded that it
had been discovered that some
salt formations contain trapped
brine and that the brine migrates
toward heat. There is tear that
the brine could corrode the con
tainers of the wastes, releasing
radioactivity into the environ
ment.
The utility executive said th.it
il that is the case, a meat deal

more work should be clone.
"The behavior of different
mediums as they are exposed on
a long-term b;isis to radioactivity
has not yet been determined to
our satisfaction." said a White
House official w ho was involved
in the president's decision.
" Chat's why the industry's asser
tion that we know how to do it is
just plain wrong."
Other mediums
In addition to s;dt. the De
partment of Energy has been or
dered to explore the possibility
ol burying the spent fuel rods in
several other mediums. The pos
sibilities include granite, tuff,
shale and salt domes.
I actors to be studied include
the ellect ol heat, fracturing of
the rock, trapped brine and other
liquids, homogeneity of the
material and the possibility of
earthquake or other destruction.
Carter tried to finesse the
major political problem through
Ins State Planning Council,
which was attacked by Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy (D-Mass) for not
gi\ ing the st.itcs \ cto power o\er
possible nuclear dumps within
them.
Carter's goal is to proceed
with the technical assessments of
the various burial sites while at
the s;ime time allowing the State
Planning Council to participate
in the decision-making. He
hopes that when a final decision
is made between I 955 and 19W,
the council will have been part of
that decision and will support it.
