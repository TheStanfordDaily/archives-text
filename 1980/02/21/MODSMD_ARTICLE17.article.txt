## 
### Nancy Yoshihara The Los Angeles Times 
Americans know how to make
a buck out of anything, and the
l l JN() Moscow Summer Olym
pics may go down in history as
the selling ol the boycott.
Just a couple of weeks ago, ad
vertisers. manufacturers and re
tailers who had planned mer
chandising tie-ins with the inter
national games were lamenting
the prospects ol a U.S. boycott
and the loss of hundreds ol
thousands ol dollars ol potential
profits.
Yesterday, some ol them
stood ready to unleash Olympic
"boycott" merchandise the mi
nute ii becomes clear that the
Russians have failed to pull their
troopsout ol Afghanistan by yes
terday.
Soon you may see Russian
Olympic mascot. Misha the bear,
with "boycott" emblazoned ac
ross his tummy, on leotards
manulactured bv (i\m-Kin. a

small firm in Pennsylvania.
V ice President Walter Mon
dalc was reported posing for pic
tures at l.akc Placid Winter
Olympics wearing a I -shirt sav
ing "NOlympics" with a picture
ol a loot kicking the rear end of
Mislui. Morton Kaplan, a
Chicago public relations execu
tive. decided to put Ijis idea on
shirts and now stands read\ to
distribute them nationally.
I'hus once again, enterprising
I S. businessmen see opportun
ity in adversity. Some ol the cf
fort especially from small
firms â€” results from sheer need.
Unlike giants such as I cv i
Strauss Co.. which allocated
millions of dollars for advertising
but only small amounts for spe
cial merchandise, smaller com
panies like Ciym-Kin committed
si/able inventory to the project.
(iv m-Kin. for example has 220(1
do/en sets of leotards and skat
ing apparel worth about
$250.000 at retail with either

the Olv mpic sv mbol or Mislui on
the clothing.
"It seemed the only route was
to dump them, but we came up
with an alternative marketing
plan."' Gary Scibert. president,
said. "We screened'boycott' ac
ross the (Olympic) emblem and
the tummy of Misha on some
samples and took them to the
Sporting Goods Show in
Chicago," where the response
was good.
So the company has decided to
redo its entire inventory it there
is a boycott. "Hopefully, they
(the clothing) will become col
lectors items. We're hoping
we'll be above water by the time
all this is over." said Scibert,
whose firm is headquartered in
Sinking Springs. Pa.
Meanwhile, independents like
Kaplan, the Chicago PR man.
said he had an idea for a T-shirt
and made up an initial order ol
500. "They went like era/)." he
said, and he plans to print more
- at $5.95 a copy.
