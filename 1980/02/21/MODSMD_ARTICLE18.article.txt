# Bush, Reagan tied in New Hampshire polls
## 
### Lou Cannon The Washington Post 
MANCHESTER. N.H. — On
the surface, everything would
seem to be coming up roses in
New Hampshire for Republican
presidential candidate George
Bush.
He has won the lowa caucuses
where Ronald Reagan was fa
vored. and the Puerto Rico
primary where Tennessee Sen.
I ioward Baker was considered a
threat. He draws large crowds
wherever he goes. I lis organiza
tion is ahead of the pack. By all
outward measures. Bush would
appear to be a rising candidate
and Reaiian a fading one.

But with a week to go before
the New Hampshire primary,
there are danger signals, re
miniscent of what happened in
North Carolina before Reagan
upset then-President Gerald
Ford four years ago— which are
beginning to disturb the
euphoria of the Bush camp.
One of these signals, unpub
licized in New Hampshire, is the
result from Bush's telephone
campaign in Concorde, a moder
ate GOP city that went heavily
for Ford over Reagan and is a
prime Bush target area this time.
Only one-sixth of the voters

reached by telephone campaig
ners say they are supporting
Bush. Another one-sixth favor
some other candidate, usually
Reagan, and the other two
thirds are uncommitted. In 1976.
Ford led Reagan 2 to 1 in a simi
lar phone survey. Ford went on
to beat Reagan 51 t049 percent.
The five polls known to have
been taken — for two newspap
ers, two candidates and a uni\er
sity — all put the contest bet
ween Bush and Reagan so close
that it is within the margin ol
error of each poll.
The latest survey, a telephone

poll ol 1320 potential voters by
University of New Hampshire
political scientists Dav id Moore
and Robert Craig, shows Bush
with 37 percent and Reagan with
33 percent among likely voters.
Far back are Baker. 10: John
Anderson. 5; John Connally. 2:
and Philip Crane and Bob Dole
less than one apiece.
"Our margin ol error is live
points and this is a dead heat as
far as I'm concerned." said
Craig.
Other data in the poll suggest
Bush supporters may be vulner
able to Reagan's appeal. Bush

and Reagan have comparable
support among the majority ot
New Hampshire Republicans
who classify themselves as con
servative. hut the conservatives
have been targeted by the
Reagan campaign and by the
pro-Reagan Manchester Union
Leader.
"(Publisher William) Loeb
knows what he's doing."' says
Craig.
What Loeb is doing, every day
in every way lie can. is portraying
Bush as a squishy-solt liberal
posing as a conservative. The
lead article in the (Jnion Leader
Tuesday was headlines "Bush
'Soft' on So\ iet Goals." 11
quoted Gen. Daniel Graham
(Ret.) ol the Washington-based
Coalition lor Peace Through
Strength as saying that Hush as
Central Intelligence Agency di
rector had resisted the findings
of a re\ ievv team that contended
that the CIA underestimated
Soviet military strength.
Loch's front-page editorial
last Thursday, headed. "Is
Everybody l ying But George?",
accused Bush ot suppressing the
truth about contributions he re
ceived and allegedly failed to re
port in a 1970 Senate race. Two
other editorials also attacked
Bush, while tour articles and two
columns praised Reagan.
Bush is trying not to respond,
hoping Republicans will con
sider the source. In fact. Bush is
doing nothing at all this week ex
cept preparing for the two New
Hampshire debates, one last
niuht in Manchester with all the

GOP candidates and one Satur
day night in Nashua with
Reagan.
It is an anomaly of the New
Hampshire campaign that
neither Reagan nor Bush has a
single planned event other than
the debates within the state be
fore next Monday. In Reagan's
case, this scheduling reflects a
desire to allow his organization,
which has been strained by the
logistics of moving Reagan
around New Hampshire on a
daily basis, to concentrate on
get-out-the-v ote efforts.
Bush's managers believe he
"won" the Jan. 5 lowa debate
principally because Reagan
ducked it.
Iliis perception reflects the
raised expectations now con
fronting Bush in New Hamp
shire. Having demonstrated that
he can run spectacularly as a
dark horse. Bush now becomes
the candidate to beat. The de-,
bates this week are likely toshowj
whether he is up to the pressure
of that position.
