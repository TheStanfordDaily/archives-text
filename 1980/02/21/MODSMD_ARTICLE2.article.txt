# Minority hiring policy revised
## 
### Andrea James News Editor 
Alter being issued citations for
tailing to meet its own affirmative
action policies, the University will
revise its policies for hiring and
promoting minority faculty and staff
members, Stanford's Affirmative
Action Office announced Friday.
New policies were outlined in a
letter to the San Francisco regional
Office of Federal Contract Com
pliance Programs which cited the
University last month.
The 15 citations filed against
Stanford came after a three-month
review of the University's policies
by the federal programs office.
In its letter of response, the Uni
versity suggested ways to correct all
1 5 deficiencies, proposing such pol
icy changes as the expansion of job
titles and classifications to meet
federal regulations, increased pub
licity of its affirmative action prog
ram and the establishment of a
five-year goal for hiring and prom
oting minorities.
Some areas, such as computing
the number of available jobs for
minorities in each of the new job

groups and revising five-year goals
and timetables for hiring and prom
otion, will not be outlined for
another four weeks.
The Affirmative Action Office,
which prepared the response, said
time constraints were too tight for it
to respond in detail to all the cita
tions. The University was cited in
mid-January and was given 30 days
to respond.
Corrective actions demanded by
the federal office included:
—Revising internal reporting sys
tems to measure the effectiveness of
the total affirmative action prog
ram, including data on all applic
ants, new hires, promotions, termi
nations, transfers, layoffs and re
calls.
— Including performance on
equal employment opportunity in
the performance reviews of super
visors. managers, department
chairpersons and deans.
— Revising job groups for faculty
and other academic staff to separate
such areas as tenured faculty,
nontenured faculty, lecturers and
research associates.
In proposing solutions to these

deficiencies, Stanford said it would
conputerize all necessary data to
monitor the effectiveness of affir
mative action programs.
This computerized system will be
available by late summer this year,
the report said.
The Affirmative Action Office
also told the federal body it would
work closely with coordinators in
of the top level positions to
monitor the response to equal
employment opportunities.
In addition, job groups were ex
panded to comply with federal
mandates, as 40 previous job clas
sifications for staff employees were
expanded to 69 new groups. The
major change here was the break
down of the "managers and offi
cials" category into senior, middle
and lower management groups, the
report states.
Santiago Rodriguez, affirmative
action officer here, called the policy
changes a "major undertaking.
"The administrative procedures
and the gathering of e\ aluations en
tail a major time factor," Rodriguez
said.
