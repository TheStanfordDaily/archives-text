## Learn to accept when logic fails 
### 
Sunday had hardly begun when I ar
med at the beach. Leaving behind
the car. steaming and ticking from its run
across the mountains, I put on the extra swe
ater. the windbreaker and the blue stocking
cap on my way up the hill overlooking the
sea. A storm from the southwest had given
life to the water — giant waves crashing in on
what was left of the beach, fighting against a
stiff onshore wind that tore the foam right
awa\ from the breakers.
On the way uphill to a spot a hundred feet
above the wet. the wind was at my back, a 40
mile-per-hour helper. Wind sheer, gradients.
Bernoulli or whatever made the breeze
stronger as I reached the top — an easy 60
mph, with gusts. At the top, the last dozen
feet of wet ground was stripped of its grass:
nothing could grow in that wind.
I stopped a dozen feet from the edge, af
raid of being blown over. holding my glasses
to my face and grasping, white-knuckled, the
K.-Mart blue windbreaker whose snaps failed
each time I turned side to the wind. A pre
carious balance of forces. I watched the

ocean.
Twenty feet above me and 50 feet out
from the face of the cliff on which I stood, a
hundred and twenty feet above the fiercest
sea in years, a gray seagull flew. A smudge in
the air, it strained motionless in the wind,
stock-still for a moment, then slightly hack
wards, flying backwards and then, dipping its
beak a fraction to gain speed, it nudged up to
the original position. It was the only gull in
the air. the only bird of the morning and it
looked at me.
I wondered what would make a single gull
brave such winds. Was it lost? In search of
food? There must be a reason for this bird at
6 a.m. to be flying over the beach — a
reason based on heredity, on expediency?
And the gull still stood, motionless, in the air
above the only man on the beach who, at
6 in the morning, had no reason to be
standing a hundred feet above the ocean in a
blue K-Mart windbreaker and wet sneakers,
yet had just driven 30 miles in the rain to be
there.
It is a curse ot the scientific age that we

look tor reason in everything hut ourselves,
expecting logic in every mind but our own.
And when we don't find the logic, it is laid
down to poor methodology or inattention. I
see the curse in myself, my students, friends,
lovers — the need to understand, the inabil
ity to accept. In a society that is composed of
intense indi\ idualists, it seems we cannot
allow any single member to be so individual
as to be beyond question. We question, we
ridicule, we tolerate or we ignore. But we
never accept.
The best we can manage is tolerance, but
tolerance is pretending not to notice that a
triend has bad breath or used the wrong fork
or registered tor the draft. But acceptance is
more; it is saying, "I don't know why-you
would make that choice, do that thing, stop
out, break up, vote Republican, lie to your
self. but I like you and want \ou to be happy.
Fly."
