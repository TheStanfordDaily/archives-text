Fix bike hazard
In recognition of Bicycle
Safetv Week I would like to
point out a situation which I
think should be of top priority
for the University to correct. The
bike path on the east side of Palm
Drive is virtually unusable, and
as a result the two-way path on
the other side contains innumer
able hazards.
Hundreds of bicyclists use this
route regularly, anil the constant
head-on flow of traffic is
frightening. Motorists entering
from the sides will invariably cut
you off or have to skid to a stop
to avoid hitting you because they
don't look to the right. An addi
tional danger is having to cross
the street on both the Stanford
and Palo Alto ends just to be
able to use the path.
By far the most dangerous
hazard is that posed by the tall
archways which mark the
Stan ford/Palo Alto border. A
sharp hook in the path creates a
blind corner w here accidents and
near misses are a daily occurr
ence. My plea is that the other
bike path be re-paved before
anyone is killed bv running into
another bicyclist or the side of
the narrow cement archway.
It is my opinion that all the
efforts of Bicycle Safety Week

are trivial compared to what the
University has power to do
through construction and light
ing to insure the safety of its huge
bicycling population. If only it
would spend less effort on
aesthetic construction and give a
little more attention to the in
terests of those supporting it. this
campus would be a safer place
for us all.

Just how important is it to
keep a full gas tank? So far we
Americans, and I include my
own family, have resisted all
exhortation to use less gasoline,
always finding excuses that this
or that particular trip is justified.
Is no price too great, even if the
cost is the lives of our own chil
dren?
President Richard Lyman
(Daily, Jan. 25) seems prepared
to blanket our national disgrace
in the benign term "vital Ameri
can interest."
Will our best American lead
ership continue to resign itself to
the selfish indulgence of large
gas-guzzling cars as a proper part
of national interest? Recrea

tional boats, planes and land veh
icles devour thousands of gallons
of gas as we erode the earth, pol
lute the water and foul the air
with our weekend motorized or
gies — is that national interest?
Is it not time to abandon the
so-be-it attitude toward the val
ues that are pushing relentlessly
in the direction of war? Is it not
time that the voices of the
thoughtful challenge openly the
style of life that creates our type
of vital American interest? Or
are we already irrevocably com
mitted to the killing of our own
children and the children of dis
tant peoples?
That Stanford children should
be no more exempt from regist
ration. draft and possible death
than the children of the poor is
correct. But it is a superficial jus
tice. the splitting of a very small
ethical hair in comparison with
the terrible moral responsibility
of those who would sacrifice life
in order to maintain luxury.
Salute to yoi- David Harris
(Daily, Jan. 25). I join in asking
for gas rationing. That would be
action in the national interest,
action demanding all citizens to
live with an eye to the true well
being of this country and the
earth. Gas rationing could apply
the discipline to curb our lust for
other people's resources and stif
fen our backs as we work out a
better and wiser way of life.

End abortion deaths
"As the result of practically all
federal funds for Medicaid abor
tions being cut oft. at least four
poor women have died." As the
announcer on my car radio went
on to explain how poor women
are dying or just having their
babies because the federal funds
in some states have been cut off,
one key word settled into my
mind — death. Either way you
look at it someone dies — the
baby or the mother.
Women do have unwanted
pregnancies in our society by
force (rape or incest) and they do
need help. But what about the
women who become pregnant
through deliberate indiscretion?
My appeal to them is for life —
for educating these women and
men in the preservation and sac
redness of life on earth.
All too often I have heard men
and women kick the word abor
tion around as though they were
talking about slicing chicken —
nothing to it. I have heard too
many women say they don't re
ally worry about contraceptives,
that they'll just get an abortion
— or "I can't take anything, my
system is too delicate; I'll just

have an abortion."
I don't know what the logic is
when people are callous with
their bodies and innocent life,
but I wish there would be more
concentration on educating the
public to contraceptives. Fearful
parents should stop thinking in
terms of their eternal virgin
daughters and talk to these
young adults who will most as
suredly feel feelings of love and
indulgence.
A rapport should be estab
lished with our children so that
secrets and death will no longer
plague our children and our soci
ety.

Responding to the request for
opinions from your readers as to
what is "wrong (or right) with
Stanford, California, the United
States and the World" (Daily,
Feb. 12), an almost knee-jerk
reaction of mine was. "One thing
that isright with Stanford and the

Editorial opinions and policies

to blanket our national disgrace
in the benign term "vital Ameri
can interest."
Will our best American lead
ership continue to resign itself to
the selfish indulgence of large
gas-guzzling cars as a proper part
of national interest? Recrea

tional boats, planes and land veh
icles devour thousands of gallons
of gas as we erode the earth, pol
lute the water and foul the air
with our weekend motorized or
gies — is that national interest?
Is it not time to abandon the
so-be-it attitude toward the val
ues that are pushing relentlessly
in the direction of war? Is it not
time that the voices of the
thoughtful challenge openly the
style of life that creates our type
of vital American interest? Or
are we already irrevocably com
mitted to the killing of our own
children and the children of dis
tant peoples?
That Stanford children should
be no more exempt from regist
ration. draft and possible death
than the children of the poor is
correct. But it is a superficial jus
tice. the splitting of a very small
ethical hair in comparison with
the terrible moral responsibility
of those who would sacrifice life
in order to maintain luxury.
Salute to yoi- David Harris
(Daily, Jan. 25). I join in asking
for gas rationing. That would be
action in the national interest,
action demanding all citizens to
live with an eye to the true well
being of this country and the
earth. Gas rationing could apply
the discipline to curb our lust for
other people's resources and stif
fen our backs as we work out a
better and wiser way of life.

End abortion deaths
"As the result of practically all
federal funds for Medicaid abor
tions being cut oft. at least four
poor women have died." As the
announcer on my car radio went
on to explain how poor women
are dying or just having their
babies because the federal funds
in some states have been cut off,
one key word settled into my
mind — death. Either way you
look at it someone dies — the
baby or the mother.
Women do have unwanted
pregnancies in our society by
force (rape or incest) and they do
need help. But what about the
women who become pregnant
through deliberate indiscretion?
My appeal to them is for life —
for educating these women and
men in the preservation and sac
redness of life on earth.
All too often I have heard men
and women kick the word abor
tion around as though they were
talking about slicing chicken —
nothing to it. I have heard too
many women say they don't re
ally worry about contraceptives,
that they'll just get an abortion
— or "I can't take anything, my
system is too delicate; I'll just

have an abortion."
I don't know what the logic is
when people are callous with
their bodies and innocent life,
but I wish there would be more
concentration on educating the
public to contraceptives. Fearful
parents should stop thinking in
terms of their eternal virgin
daughters and talk to these
young adults who will most as
suredly feel feelings of love and
indulgence.
A rapport should be estab
lished with our children so that
secrets and death will no longer
plague our children and our soci
ety.

Responding to the request for
opinions from your readers as to
what is "wrong (or right) with
Stanford, California, the United
States and the World" (Daily,
Feb. 12), an almost knee-jerk
reaction of mine was. "One thing
that isright with Stanford and the
world is The Stanford Daily it
self."
Editorial opinions and policies
will shift with the shifting of
editors but what keeps us faithful
readers is the Daily's superior
professionalism. It was not al
ways so. Hence the near knee
jerk.

Fix bike hazard
In recognition of Bicycle
Safetv Week I would like to
point out a situation which I
think should be of top priority
for the University to correct. The
bike path on the east side of Palm
Drive is virtually unusable, and
as a result the two-way path on
the other side contains innumer
able hazards.
Hundreds of bicyclists use this
route regularly, anil the constant
head-on flow of traffic is
frightening. Motorists entering
from the sides will invariably cut
you off or have to skid to a stop
to avoid hitting you because they
don't look to the right. An addi
tional danger is having to cross
the street on both the Stanford
and Palo Alto ends just to be
able to use the path.
By far the most dangerous
hazard is that posed by the tall
archways which mark the
Stan ford/Palo Alto border. A
sharp hook in the path creates a
blind corner w here accidents and
near misses are a daily occurr
ence. My plea is that the other
bike path be re-paved before
anyone is killed bv running into
another bicyclist or the side of
the narrow cement archway.
It is my opinion that all the
efforts of Bicycle Safety Week

are trivial compared to what the
University has power to do
through construction and light
ing to insure the safety of its huge
bicycling population. If only it
would spend less effort on
aesthetic construction and give a
little more attention to the in
terests of those supporting it. this
campus would be a safer place
for us all.

Just how important is it to
keep a full gas tank? So far we
Americans, and I include my
own family, have resisted all
exhortation to use less gasoline,
always finding excuses that this
or that particular trip is justified.
Is no price too great, even if the
cost is the lives of our own chil
dren?
