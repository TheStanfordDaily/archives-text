## Pauline Newman-Gordon Language study neglected 
### 
During the past decade, I have attempted in
various letters to the Daily and Campus Report to
call attention to the plight of foreign language
study at the University. My letters have attracted
various responses and even kindled controversies
between the cavalier "let them speak English"
brand of American intellectuals and the more
sturdy and seasoned academic for whom foreign
language study is a basic and essential part of a
college education. The latter have been accused of
everything from anti-intellectualism to defending
vested interests! Often confused with cosmopoli
tan glamor and tea party savoir-faire, the study of
foreign languages had been looked upon as a social
grace or a skill but certainly not a mode of inquiry.
Unfortunately, very few gains have been
achieved to date by the proponents of foreign lan
guage study. At a time when the entire curriculum
has been revamped, marking the reversal of a 10-
year trend toward elective, nonprescriptive educa
tion. no guidelines have been spelled out that will
encourage students to begin language study early
and work toward the achievement of total profi
ciency. At present, seven tracks lead to the fulfill
ment of the distribution requirement at the Uni
versity in addition to Western Culture. Not one
specifically includes foreign language.
The reportedly high enrollment in foreign lan
guage courses is misleading for it is a product of
chance and individual caprice, not buttressed by
the kind of early preparation the high schools used
to offer. The system still bears the humiliating
mark of the laissez-faire indifference of the late
1960s and '70s. Student attitudes reflect the slight
esteem in which the University has traditionally
held foreign language study, with its heavy em
phasis on literature in translation (mostly poor

ones at that) and its utter neglect of the Juilland-
Moravcsik Senate resolution of Feb. 3, 1977 cal
ling for the promotion of foreign language study.
Experience has demonstrated the futility of at
tempting to convince skeptics of the intellectual
caliber of first-year language courses. Perhaps they
can be sensitized to other ways of looking at the
problem. Instead of concentrating on the elusive
question of what mental faculties are mobilized in
the study of foreign languages, I suggest that we
think essentially of what is to be achieved.
The history of a culture is written into the
changes of a word, into the syntactical transforma
tions of sentence structure. Access to the language
is in this sense access to a culture. From the earliest
foreign language class, a learning process is set in
motion during which all kinds of responses are
elicited. Avenues of awareness lead to new aesthe
tic and intellectual vistas.
There is reason to believe that the question of
language study will be openly discussed this spring.
Let us hope that the appropriate constituencies will
find ways to restore it to the curriculum.
We can never redress the errors of the past when
two generations of students were sacrificed to our
inability to assume leadership in this area. Admit
tedly, times were difficult. But this was true all over
the country and we must not exonerate ourselves
from the charge of gross negligence made by Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's committee reporting the
status ot foreign language study nationwide. To
restore the language requirement would be in
keeping with the most recent initiatives in the Uni
versity and in the nation at large. To fail to do so
would be an act of sheer cynicism.
