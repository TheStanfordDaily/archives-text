# There is no 'snug harbor'
## 
### 
On Jan. 23, President Jimmy
Carter called for re-institution of
registration for the draft. The
next day several hundred stu
dents gathered in the noon sun
shine of White Plaza to hear
David Harris attack Carter's mo
tion. Among other charges,
perhaps over-reaction was the
main arrow slung by Harris. He
acknowledged that registration
for the draft is constitutional in
the event of a national
emergency, but asked, "Where is
the national emergency?"
The four weeks since then
have been marked by vehement
protest, endless discussion, a
"town meeting" that amounted
to an anti-draft teach-in, and a
forceless 8-7 decision by the
ASSU Senate to oppose registra
tion. Again and again we have
heard charges of over-reaction,
both from the anti-draft protes
ters, and also from those who
feel that the vigorous protest
against draft registration is in it
self over-reaction.
Indeed, it often seems that for
every decision made or action
taken at the University someone
will immediately form a group to
protest it. The hysterical reac
tions begin to seem a bit absurd.
Yet the broad scope of outcry
against the possibility of draft re
gistration indicates that this is
not just another protest.
It outrages us to think of an
external force depriving us of
some of the best years of our
lives. The refusal to allow any
one or anything to usurp control,
to take hold of and shape our
destiny — is this not what moti
vates most protest? We all sense
that as Americans, we have
something valuable to defend.
We raise our voices when we
perceive an attempt to infringe
upon the rights guaranteed by
the Constitution for all citizens.

No one, however, seems to be
aware of a force that daily
threatens not merely the theft of
some good years of our lives, but
of our very lives themselves. Is
not "liberty and the pursuit of
happiness" an empty phrase
without the "life" to go along
with it?
No one has heard about the
first meeting of SAFE (Students
Against the Forces of Ear
thquakes). Yet if there is any-

thing to be feared and repelled
now, while we still have the
chance, it is the oppressive,
tyrannical power that ear
thquakes possess over all of our
lives. Can we simply stand by and
wait, knowing that with a mere
shrug of the Earth's shoulders,
this peninsula which we all
peacefully inhabit could be
dropped into the Pacific Ocean
or turned into a suburb of Hon
olulu?
Of course we stand by and
wait. We allow ourselves to
forget about the supposedly im
minent threat of a major ear
thquake. Preventive measures
are taken: we learn where to go
in case of an earthquake; we set
high building safety standards;
but very few ever leave the area.
We seem to know that no place
will be completely invulnerable
to life-changing forces beyond
our ability to control or prevent.
Or do we know this? The
events of the past weeks have led
me to wonder about the notions

| underlying the vehement reac
tions of many people against
draft registration. We seem to
believe that if we react quickly
enough and with sufficient vol
ume, we can turn back any force
seeking to violate us.
The voices are full of proud
fear. In many ways they mimic
the tone of Carter's call for draft
registration.
This is the question 1 wish to

pose. Do we have anything, in
side or outside ourselves, that
simply cannot be violated; that is
subject neither to the whims and
shrugs of national leaders (in
search of a second four-year
term) nor to the shrugs of the San
Andreas Fault; and that thus
does not depend on our own abil
ity to rise to our feet and shout
"Hell no!"?
We cannot withdraw into snug
harbors where nothing can dis
turb us, for there are no such
harbors. And such withdrawal
would be selfish, for our voices
must be raised on behalf of those
who have no voice.
But the threat would be less
personal, the voices firmer and
calmer, if we knew that our lives
were rooted in elements that
could not be violated. An ear
thquake can and will shake a
house, but the damage will de
pend on the foundation under
that house. How much confi
dence do we have in the founda
tions under our houses?

forceless 8-7 decision by the
ASSU Senate to oppose registra
tion. Again and again we have
heard charges of over-reaction,
both from the anti-draft protes
ters, and also from those who
feel that the vigorous protest
against draft registration is in it
self over-reaction.
Indeed, it often seems that for
every decision made or action
taken at the University someone
will immediately form a group to
protest it. The hysterical reac
tions begin to seem a bit absurd.
Yet the broad scope of outcry
against the possibility of draft re
gistration indicates that this is
not just another protest.
It outrages us to think of an
external force depriving us of
some of the best years of our
lives. The refusal to allow any
one or anything to usurp control,
to take hold of and shape our
destiny — is this not what moti
vates most protest? We all sense
that as Americans, we have
something valuable to defend.
We raise our voices when we
perceive an attempt to infringe
upon the rights guaranteed by
the Constitution for all citizens.

No one, however, seems to be
aware of a force that daily
threatens not merely the theft of
some good years of our lives, but
of our very lives themselves. Is
not "liberty and the pursuit of
happiness" an empty phrase
without the "life" to go along
with it?
No one has heard about the
first meeting of SAFE (Students
Against the Forces of Ear
thquakes). Yet if there is any-

thing to be feared and repelled
now, while we still have the
chance, it is the oppressive,
tyrannical power that ear
thquakes possess over all of our
lives. Can we simply stand by and
wait, knowing that with a mere
shrug of the Earth's shoulders,
this peninsula which we all
peacefully inhabit could be
dropped into the Pacific Ocean
or turned into a suburb of Hon
olulu?
Of course we stand by and
wait. We allow ourselves to
forget about the supposedly im
minent threat of a major ear
thquake. Preventive measures
are taken: we learn where to go
in case of an earthquake; we set
high building safety standards;
but very few ever leave the area.
We seem to know that no place
will be completely invulnerable
to life-changing forces beyond
our ability to control or prevent.
Or do we know this? The
events of the past weeks have led
me to wonder about the notions

| underlying the vehement reac
tions of many people against
draft registration. We seem to
believe that if we react quickly
enough and with sufficient vol
ume, we can turn back any force
seeking to violate us.
The voices are full of proud
fear. In many ways they mimic
the tone of Carter's call for draft
registration.
This is the question 1 wish to

pose. Do we have anything, in
side or outside ourselves, that
simply cannot be violated; that is
subject neither to the whims and
shrugs of national leaders (in
search of a second four-year
term) nor to the shrugs of the San
Andreas Fault; and that thus
does not depend on our own abil
ity to rise to our feet and shout
"Hell no!"?
We cannot withdraw into snug
harbors where nothing can dis
turb us, for there are no such
harbors. And such withdrawal
would be selfish, for our voices
must be raised on behalf of those
who have no voice.
But the threat would be less
personal, the voices firmer and
calmer, if we knew that our lives
were rooted in elements that
could not be violated. An ear
thquake can and will shake a
house, but the damage will de
pend on the foundation under
that house. How much confi
dence do we have in the founda
tions under our houses?

On Jan. 23, President Jimmy
Carter called for re-institution of
registration for the draft. The
next day several hundred stu
dents gathered in the noon sun
shine of White Plaza to hear
David Harris attack Carter's mo
tion. Among other charges,
perhaps over-reaction was the
main arrow slung by Harris. He
acknowledged that registration
for the draft is constitutional in
the event of a national
emergency, but asked, "Where is
the national emergency?"
The four weeks since then
have been marked by vehement
protest, endless discussion, a
"town meeting" that amounted
to an anti-draft teach-in, and a
forceless 8-7 decision by the
ASSU Senate to oppose registra
tion. Again and again we have
heard charges of over-reaction,
both from the anti-draft protes
ters, and also from those who
feel that the vigorous protest
against draft registration is in it
