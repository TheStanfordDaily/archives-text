Martin tongue poked tirmlv
cheek— suggests that C BS 1\ s
f>o Minutes lias got to be this sea
son's prime-time hit In Inning
off the television ratings people.
Martin's innuendo, in a recent
skit spoofing the journalistic
technique of veteran 60 Minnies
correspondent Mike Wallace,
does raise an intriguing question:
Win. in its 13th season, is M
Minnies — winner of 17 Emmy
Awards — the most-watched
show on American television?
•"1 really don't know for sure,
and I've thought about it a lot."
Don Hewitt, the program's
executive producer from its start
on Sept. 24. IMfrN. said in an in
terv ievv.
•"I do think that what's hap
pened is our audience finds
(Mike) Wallace. (Dan) Rather.
(Morley) Safer and (Harry)
Reasoner being themselves
more fascinating than (Robert)
Redford and (Dustin) Hoffman
playing (Bob) Woodward and
(Carl) Bernstein."
Hewitt was quick to gi\ e credit
fo Wallace. Rather. Safer and
Re asoner. pointing to their ot

.vs .uv.vent to his and referring
to - s Pittsburgh Steelers'
bens+t"
Credit
But a good deal of the credit
\m the extraordinary success of
\/ belongs to Hewitt
himself.
1 he selection of segments for
broadcast each week is. ulti
mately. Hewitt's. \ blackboard
across the hall from his office
lists the stories each correspon
dent is working on.
Fine line
"What we've done has never
been done before." he con
tinued. "In television, there's a
fine line separating journalism
from show business, and we've
been able to walk up to that line
and not cross it.
"Most shows ot this type fall
short of the line and are too dull,
or cross it and lose their integ
rity."
There are other reasons for
the show's success, ot course,
like its protected Sunday night
time slot, a haven reserved tor
public affairs and children's
programming, as well as a terrific
lead-in from professional toot
ball during the fall.
