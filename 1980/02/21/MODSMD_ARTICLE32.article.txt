# Aspirin ads confusing

NEW YORK. (AP) â€” Most of the pain relics ers
Americans spend nearly one billion dollars a year
on are mostly aspirin.
But you would never know it by searching the
typical drug store display, or confronting the be
wildering advertisements on television, radio and
in print.
You can pay more than three cents a tablet for
aspirin in the 24-tablet size of Bayer, or less than
one-tenth that for the large size of an unknown
brand. Yet they may be equally good for your
headache.
The premium that consumers pay for name
brand products helps support advertising. But.
much of the pain reliever advertising is "contusing
and misleading to the consumer." a panel of the
U.S. Food and Drug Administration has con
cluded.
The K DA panel advises these people to consult a

doctor before taking aspirin:
-The approximately two in 1000 people who are
allergic to aspirin (this includes from percent to
20 percent of asthmatics).
-People who have a history of ulcers, stomach
distress or problems of internal bleeding, since as
pirin tends to increase bleeding.
-Women in the last three months of pregnancy,
since aspirin can interfere with infant blood clot
ting or delay or prolong labor.
-Hemophiliacs or persons who are taking drugs
to prevent blood clotting (anti-coagulants), be
cause aspirin's anticlotting action may make them
dangerously liable to bleed.
-Diabetics or sufferers of gout, since aspirin can
interact or interfere with prescription drugs for
these conditions.
-Arthritics. since, despite the sales of "arthritis
strength" aspirin products, doctors say it is danger
ous to self-medicate arthritis, which can develop
into a crippling disease.
