# Pledging seniors 'get a piece of the Farm'
## 
### Kuthy Kemby Staff Writer 
While most seniors seem to be
concerned about their own fu
ture, the Senior Pledge Program
asks them to switch priorities for
awhile and think about the fu
ture of the Farm.
Through the program, seniors
can pledge a contribution to the
University, payable over the
next three years. The program is
a student-run, volunteer organi
zation with a senior representa
tive in each University residence.
The program's slogan, "Get a
Piece of the Farm," stresses the
importance of private donations
to the University's livelihood.
Only 41 percent of the operating
budget here comes from tuition
and ot her fees. The other 51 per
cent is from other sources, in
cluding private donations.
"After all that I've spent on
tuition, how can you ask me to
give Stanford more money?" is a
typical response of many seniors
when asked to contribute. But it
is not the amount pledged that is
important, according to the
Pledge Program Committee.
Many seniors pledge only $10 to
$25 each year. In fact, last year
50 percent of private donations
to the University were less than
$25.

Instead, it's participation that
is the key to the program. The
accumulated impact of all the
gifts is what keeps Stanford
strong, say committee members.
A large amount of student par
ticipation should help bring in
more donations from large cor
porations and foundations,
committee members believe. If
these firms see that the students
themselves feel Stanford must
continue to excel, their own do
nations will be more justified,
they say.
Seniors can specify where
their pledge is to be spent. In this
way, they can help improve the
housing system, or contribute to a
favorite extracurricular activity
such as club sports or the per
forming arts.
So far, 25 percent of the senior
class has pledged, according to
Lea Ann Schoenfeld, chairperl
son of the Pledge Program. This
demonstrates a higher degree of
participation than ever before in
the program's three-year his
tory, she said.
"We're still in the process of
figuring out just exactly how
much we have received," she
said. "Many who initially
pledged have not yet turned in
their official remit cards."
The program is still accepting
