## Free show at Toyon Danceable rocky it won't go away 
### 
Like many of the good new
bands, The Beat is hard to fit
under any one convenient term.
Its sound isn't quite power pop,
because the guitars are a little
too prominent for that smoother,
more melodic style. Its raw, ear
thy recording style suggests
punk, the lyrics are apolitical
and all the band's songs are both
singable and danceable.
The catch-all phrase "new
wave," if it meant anything,
might seem suitable; to most
people the term refers to a return
to the basics of rock — the
straight-ahead R&B of the '50s,
the British Invasion music of the
mid-'6os — and The Beat's
music is in many ways strongly
reminiscent of this.
While Collins, songwriter and
leader of The Beat, hardly denies
that the band's music is heavily
influenced by mid-'6os rock, he
does think that "today's kids are
moving forward, not looking
backward.
"Hell, I'm 23 years old now.
How can I be going back? Kids

are just tired of the slow plod
ding shit they've been hearing.
They want some straight-ahead
stuff they can dance to."
Although The Beat is seen by
many as part of the movement
begun by last year's success
story. The Knack, Collins replies
that "I've been doing this music
for five years now. / haven't
changed; people's tastes have
changed."
Before The Beat was formed
late last summer, Collins was
working as a drummer, playing
in clubs along the Los Angeles
circuit. It was tough, but Collins
isn't bitter that things took so
long to break for him. "I've got
no regrets. I didn't want to re
ceive a record contract one day
earlier than I did; I wasn't ready
for this until now."
The band got together through
a variety of circumstances. Col
lins met drummer Michael Ruiz
while he was hanging out at The
Whiskey, a club in L.A.
Through an ad in the Recycler,
a free newspaper in which many
musicians place personals, Col
lins got in touch with Gary Huff,
the improbable-looking but very
steady bass player.
Collins switched from drum
ming to rhythm guitar, and the
trio put together a demo tape.
The tape was well-received by
CBS executives, including Bruce
Botnick, who now produces the
band's records.
With a CBS contract in hand,
the band continued its search for

a lead guitarist to fill out its ros
ter. "We heat our hrains out for
awhile" searching for the right
person, Collins said, but finally
Larry Whitman came into a re
hearsal, and as Collins said, "it
came out perfect." Whitman
supplies the guitar fills that give
the band its added texture.
The band played its first show
at San Francisco's Kabuki Thea
ter as an opening act for Eddie
Money. After seeing the show.
Bill Graham was impressed
enough to sign the band to his
production company.
The Beat, the band's debut al
bum, was put together very
quickly; its 12 songs took five
days to record, and the rest of the
process took only two weeks.
Released in October, the re
cord has sold 35,000 copies. At
first it seemed to be a sure seller,
given the new audience for
danceable rock and the backing
of Graham and CBS, and so the
record's showing has disap
pointed some. But Collins re
mains undaunted.
"Selling 35,000 records in to
day's market is really good for a
new act," he said. "Two or three
years ago, that 112 igure would have
been horrible, but back then re
cord companies were throwing
money out of the damn window
— they were promoting every
thing. The record companies
don't push records too heavily,
now."
Sold it ourselves
In the absence of heavy prom
otion, "we feel as though we've
sold the records ourselves," Col
lins said. "It's a lot more satisfy
ing that way.
"Anyway, we'd rather not
have a platinum album on our
hands, right now. We're not
ready for it. And we don't want a
big advertising campaign either.
"1 like being the underdog,"
Collins continued. "This way. the

people who are buying the re
cords and attending the shows
feel as though they made The
Beat, and that's the way it should
be. I don't want people saying
the record company made us.
"But 1 don't think the record is
dead yet. We just released a new
single from it — 'Don't Wait Up
For Me' — and we hope it does
really well.
"I think the record is good.
When people tell me,' oh, it's too
bad about your album,' I just say,
'fuck you, man.' I'm happy about
it. I mean, what's the big rush?
We've got plenty of time. I ain't
going away, that's for sure."
Home ground
The band is based in the Bay
area. It moved from Los
Angeles to be close to Graham's
offices and also because the
"Bay area is a lot less critical
than L.A. Also, there are a lot
more places to play," Collins
said.
Besides playing area clubs,
The Beat went on national tour
with lan Gomm a few months
ago.
The Beat will go back to The
Whiskey in L.A. at the end of
this month in the hopes of re
cording a live album of brand
new material there.
It's this concern with the raw,
earthy sound and the willingness
to let success build, instead of
explode, that distinguishes The
Beat from so many of the groups
it often gets lumped with, espe
cially The Knack.
But no matter what you call it,
what The Beat is doing gets you
moving and it's definitely worth
seeing. Take some time out this
weekend and enjoy some free
music from a band that's not
going to be denied.
