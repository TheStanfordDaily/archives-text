Don't Ask
Sonnv Rollins
Milestone M-9090
If you are a jazz purist you
may not like this album. But.
come on, how many of you
out there really are jazz
purists? This is a good album.
It's typically Sonny Rollins:
humorous, ironic, sarcastic
and full of nice melodies
played brilliantly by Rollins
and his cohorts.
Up and down
For irony and sarcasm,
sample the cut, "Disco
Monk." It thumps along for a
spell, shifts abruptly into a
dreadfully slow section; then
back to the boogie, but, who

ops! It slows down again,
speeds back up, down. up.
etc.
This tune evokes visions of
tired disco queens bumping
each other into lethargy,
stopping to catch a whiff of
their ever-ready amyl nitrate,
leaping back into a high
energy hip assault until the
drug wears off, then quickly
reaching into their purses for
another nasal refueling.
I wonder if Rollins had
something equally as deca
dent in mind when he wrote
the tune?
Just jazz.
Don't worry: the rest of the
album isn't disco. There's a

jazz standard. "My Ideal."
played as a duet by Larry
Coryell on acoustic guitar and
Rollins, of course, on tenor
saxophone.
Don't miss more beautiful
tenor statements on "Harlem
Boys" and on the title track.
You'll also find a fast and
furious Coryell guitar solo on
"Don't Ask." which is as
tasteful in its choice of notes
as it is impressive in its rapid
fire delivery.
Sonny Rollins appears at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium this
Friday at 8 p.m.
