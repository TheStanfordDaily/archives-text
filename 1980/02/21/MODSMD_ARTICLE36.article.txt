## 'Gigolo': high life of a male whore 
### 
American Gigolo, writer
director Paul Schrader's third
feature film, stars Richard Ciere
as an extremely successful male
whore. Gere indeed lives the
high life — and Schrader's going
to make sure you know it.
(iere drives a Porsche, has an
expansive apartment, lots of
clothes, and he makes his living
having sex with women—and lor
tv\o hours we never get very
further than that.
Schrader's view ol Gere's
hedonism reminds you of a tire
and-brimstone preacher who so
relishes talking about sin that he
seems to enjoy Ins sermons far
too much. And the comparison
goes farther than that:
Schrader's fascination with
Gere's lifestyle is like that of
people who. for whatever
reasons, can't do "naughty"
things, but they simply love to
watch or talk about them.
Gigolo lacks the earthy, lusty
energy ol a fundamentalist ser
mon precisely because Schrader
makes the audience feel more
like peeping toms than vital par
ticipants. Your imagination is an
integral part of the sermon:
Schrader's mov ie so lacks insight

and vital energy that you're sim
ply a voyeur.
Squeaky clean
There's a sterile kinkiness
here that doesn't even begin to
shock— it's probably all authen
tic. but ev cry thing is so clean and
compartmentalized that it just
seems liteless.
It the coldness and lack ol
emotion 111 Gere's life were
Schrader's point, then it
wouldn't be so bad: but. quite
quickly. Schrader begins to get
sentimental about Gere, and tins
completely gets the better ot
him.
First. Gere struts around like
John Travolta in Suturda\ Sight
Fever when we see all the ac
coutrements this life brings him
But Gere's hardly a poor dumb
stud trapped by what he's
doing — he's much in demand.
So much so that the mov ie makes

sure we know he can avoid doing
tricks with homosexuals— he
likes giving women pleasure—
that's what gives him pleasure,
com eniently enough.
Kails apart
Gere's pretty world begins to
fall apart when he becomes a
suspect in the murder of a former
client. A further complication is
that he finds his emotional de
tenses crumbling when he meets
the wife of a powerful politician
(1 auren Mutton) and they fall 111
love.
Schrader maintains the
movie's rigid, formal style as the
plot becomes more and more
murky. Although Gere probably
didn't commit the murder,
you're never really sure: but it's
clear that you're supposed to
care about Gere, even though
the movie treats him like a
machine most of the way.

Things get more confusing.
Schrader does manage to put to
gether some solid suspense as
Gere gets trapped in a web tit
circimstances which seem to
prove his guilt. The movie seems
headed for the cynical ending,
with Gere neatly taking the rap
for something he didn't do, but
the audience leaves satisfied be
cause his •'immoral" lifestyle
makes him guilty in a general
sense, anyway.
But, 110. Gere is indeed im
prisoned: but in a ludicrous and
amateurish ending. Schrader lets
Gere otl the hook. Mutton
supplies Gere with an alibi, and
e\ eryone li\ es happily ever after.
The depths
It's a journey through the
lower depths, but you never get
dirty: Schrader keeps his dis
tance from the material. When
that's added to the fact that

Schrader can't direct an exposit
ors scene without making the ac
tors look like they're talking to
themselves, it's no wonder the
performances never begin to ex
cite you.
Gere's got talent, hut he's til
ling in for Travolta (who was
originally supposed to play the
role), and he never asserts his
own personality. Mutton comes
off a little better, but her charac
ter is either in ecstasy or filled
with pain--Schrader never al
lows her to till the gaps in her
role.
Schrader, in better times,
wrote the screenplay lor Taxi
Driver, and it's not hard to sec
why Ins raw material appeals to a
director like Martin Scorsese:
the initial ideas seem to be
packed with basic emotions;
what you have to add is some
insight. When Schrader directs
Ins own material, all the insight is
missing. And in Gigolo, all the
energy's missing, too.
In the end, the audience
doesn't even get any enjoyment
out ot being a peeping torn—
which is a pretty limp feeling, in
deed.
