# SVT, Specials: power-packed rockers and reggae
## 
### 
It's too bad America can't tap the
energy generated at rock and roll con
certs. because the power which per
meated the Tresidder Ballroom last
Friday at the Specials SVT concert
Could have made a great alternative
energy source.
SV T exploded into its set with about
as much subtlety as a bad hangover.
Guitarist Brian Marnell's dri\ ing
rhythm and Jack Casady's pounding
bass lines\ ibrated most ot the audience
into motion whether it felt like pogoing
or not. And il you'\e e\er played "left
wing" iin the perimeter of a group ot
belligerent pogoers. you know what
•'move or be moved" means.
When not occupied with "holding
the line" in the War lor the Floor. 1
turned my concentration to the non
slop electric assault which was taking

place onstage. I don't know it SVT has
a successful recording future ahead,
but both its released singles, "Heart ot
Stone" and "Wanna See ou Cryare
well worth buying.
The latter — which was the croup's
last song on the play list Friday — is a
bitterly delivered rocker which high
lighted the show. As lor the former, the
group chose not to play it — and I wish
1 knew why. It's an excellent number
that sounds e\ en better 1 ix e than it does
in the studio.
It also allows the group to show a
little more versatility: Marnell's haunt
ing vocals are particularly captivating
on the track.
But who knows? Maybe the quartet
doesn't want to push things and is wait
ing patiently tor success to find it.
rather than the other way around. If
\ou can't trust an ex-Jefterson

Airplane bass player, who can you
trust ?
But successful or not. SVT certainly
puts on one of the most exciting club
performances in the Bay area.
Equally entertaining Friday were the
Specials, though for different reasons.
Success already has found this British
croup ot seven, and these talented
musicians are milking it for all it's
worth.
The Specials play a brand of music
called •"ska." which is a surprisingly
pleasant fusion ot reggae and "New
Wave" (just new rock and roll, actu
ally ). The band features two lead sin
gers Neville Staples, who handles the
more reggae-oriented tunes, and Terry
Hall, who takes the lead on the more
rocking numbers.
I don't know what the group was on
Fridav night, but there ought to be

more of it going around. Staples, when
he wasn't climbing banks of speakers
and leaping from them in the middle of
songs, gyrated almost constantly
onstage.
All of the group members had the
urge to dance around the stage some
what spastically, but Staples was b\ far
the most excited.
In fact. Staples' energy got him in a
bit of trouble. After the group's first
encore. Staples nonchalantly picked up
a boom microphone stand and sud
denly swung it at a number ot the
sound company personnel hired for the
show by ASSU Special Events.
Apparently, the Specials had, in
their excitement, smashed a couple of
microphones, and a heated discussion
ensued between the aforementioned
combatants. That led to Staples'
"Casey at the Bat" imitation which.

i ironically, resulted in Staples' cutting
> himself badly above the eye. While the
t surprised crowd watched. Staples
picked up another mike stand and
lofted it onstage toward his adversary.
; Finally, he was restrained by his man
• ager.
It was a climactic ending to a set
which began relatively slowly and
i worked into a rhythmic frenzy by the
final numbers. The Specials played
i many of the songs from their debut al
bum. No. I in England, and mixed the
reggae and rock well.
The group's abilities were de
monstrated clearly in such numbers as
i "A Message to You Rudy." "Rat
Race" and "Doesn't Make It Alright."
Roddy Byers' lead guitar work on " Lit
tle Bitch" was also a high point of the
show.
Besides excellent vocal work from

Staples and Hall, a large part of the
Specials' success results from the excel
lent interplay between Byers and
rhythm guitarist Lynval Golding.
Transitions from the elastic reggae
rhythms to the more frenzied rock beat
were smooth and polished. This aspect
ot the band's music was especially
compelling during the latter part of the
show, when the group speeded up the
reggae into a feverish rock blitz in
mid-song, bringing the audience up to
the level of a writhing, bouncing mob.
The altercation between Staples and
the sound man served to heighten the
anticipation of the crowd, but it also
served to end the show prematurely.
But by that time, the audience had got
ten its money's worth — the Specials,
and maybe even SVT, won't be playing
for $4 a show much longer.
