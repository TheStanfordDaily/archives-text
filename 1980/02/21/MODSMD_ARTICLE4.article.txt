# Doctors quit S.C. Valley hospital over pay
## 
### Hillary Earnest Staff Writer 
Citing dissatisfaction with salary
levels and other issues, three Univer
sity physicians have resigned from the
department of surgery at Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center in San Jose.
Valley Medical Center has had a
long-standing affiliation agreement
with the Medical School here, under
which Stanford provides staff for vari
ous services at the center. These ser
vices include surgery, medicine,
pediatrics and gynecology and obstet
rics, as part of the teaching program of
center staff and medical students from
the University.
Prof. John Collins, chairman of the
surgery department here and director
of appointments for the Valley posi
tions, said he has received resignations
from Richard Fountain, Richard
Hamilton and A. Crane Charters, all
professors in the department of surgery
here. He said he had heard that Clyde
Farris and John Harding, also of the
surgery department here, were also ex

pected to resign.
Negotiations between Santa Clara
County, which administers the Valley
Medical Center, and the surgeons who
resigned are being conducted in hopes
of reaching a mutually satisfactory sol
ution, Collins said.
According to Collins, not all of the
resignations may be final. He said he
believes that some of the doctors would
reconsider, adding however that others
would leave regardless of the outcome
of negotiations.
Committee formed
The Medical School here has formed
a committee with the objective of
reaching a more stable and mutually
beneficial relationship between Valley
and Stanford, while considering the
long-range aspect of the relationship
between the two institutions, Collins
said.
"It is probably an appropriate time
to redefine the Stanford-Valley rela
tionship," he said. Santa Clara County
faces a significant decision about re
novating the Valley Medical Center,

according to Collins.
He said that there is also some uncer
tainty concerning the financial support
the county would be willing to provide
if Proposition 9 passes. Proposition 9.
Howard Jarvis' second tax-cutting
proposal, would curtail funds to state
aided institutions. Collins said that al
though the initiative is not currently
being considered in the negotiations,
the issue of funding for improvements
for the center has been raised.
Collins explained that the resigna
tions are the result of varying degrees
of dissatisfaction the surgeons have ex
pressed over "a relatively long period
of time." He cited unsatisfactory salary
levels as the common thread which
linked the resignations, although he
added that the surgeons were repor
tedly unhappy with faculty appoint
ments to the center and the manner in
which fees generated by the depart
ment were being used.
'Dead end' reached
Fountain, an orthopedic surgeon at
the center, said that he resigned be
cause he and his colleagues were not

receiving support from the Stanford
academic community. Stating that he
felt the surgeons had "reached a dead
end in their ability to maintain an
academic atmosphere at the center,"
Fountain said his resignation stemmed
from the lack of opportunity at Valley
for academic growth. He added that
salary was a factor in his decision.
Because the University faculty who
will work at Valley Center next fall
must he recruited by spring, Collins
said that it is important that a mutually
satisfactory solution be met soon if the
vacancies are to be filled.
