Soviets may boost Atgnan forces
KABUL, Afghanistan — The Soviet Union ig
nored the deadline set bv President Jimmy Carter to
withdraw its 100,000 troops from Afghanistan yes
terday Western diplomats in the Afghan capital
speculated the Kremlin may be forced to send addi
tional men here to fight Moslem rebels.
In Moscow , the deadline passed without comment.
The official Soviet news media has charged the Un
ited States with trying to blackmail the So\ iet Union,
but it never reported the deadline imposed bv Carter
— or its link to American participation in the Olym
pics.
Some Western diplomats here believe the Soviets
and the Soviet-backed Afghan government will not
be able to put down a 2 I -month rebellion by Moslem
rebels without reinforcements being sent from the
Soviet Union.
The Russians have intervened against mutinous
Afghan army units, but they seem reluctant to deploy
their infantry against the revels.
Despite the Soviet troop presence in Afghanistan,
the rebels are in virtual control of the main supply
route from Pakistan, attacking civilian traffic at will
and outmaneuv ering Afghan soldiers sent to"pacity"
the area.
The Afghan army, estimated at 100.1)00 men be
fore the Soviet intervention in late December, is be
lieved to have been cut in half through desertions,
purges and guerrilla action. And Soviet-trained Af
ghan soldiers have shown little desire to fight the
rebels who have engaged in sabotage, sniping, bomb
attacks, hit-and-run raids and ambushes.
Western intelligence reports estimate that the
So\iet army has suffered at least 3000 casualties,
including between 600 and 800 men killed, since the
first of its forces inter\ened in late December.
UN Iran commission delayed
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim delayed the
departure of a special U.N. investigatory commission
to Iran until the weekend yesterday and said Iranian
authorities want the commission members to talk to
all of the approximately 50 American hostages in
Tehran.
One of the five commission members said there
was a "gentlemen's agreement" that the hostages
would be freed as a result of their mission. However,
a well-placed diplomat said the panel's departure was
delayed because no agreement had been reached on
the timing of the release.
Iranian officials have backed off their demand that
ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlav i be extradited
before the hostages are freed. But in a Tehran radio
broadcast, ailing revolutionary leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini again called for the return of the
deposed monarch.
Waldheim. speaking to reporters in New York,
said he postponed the departure of the five lawyers
and diplomats since the Iranians had asked for "a
little more time" to prepare for the inquiry, which the
U.N. chief called a "fact-finding mission" to hear
Iran's grievances against the United States and
American grievances over the hostage-taking.
The panel is to investigate Iranian charges of mass
murder and corruption against the deposed shah and
complaints thai the United States had interferred in
Iranian affairs by supporting the shah's rule.
Waldheim earlier had received a message from
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr that gave
formal approval to the mission but that left "open
questions," Waldheim spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar
said.
The nature of the "questions" and whether they
had been resolved was not disclosed. But the Carter
administration signaled its acceptance of the Iranian
demand for a meeting between the investigators and
the hostages.
U.S. computers aid Soviet military
WASHINGTON — The United States made
major "errors in judgment" by selling computers
which the Soviet Union used to help make Army

trucks and other military equipment, a senior De
fense Department official said yesterday .
William Perry, the Pentagon's research chief, said
government officials have known for three years that
U.S.-supplied computers were used in the Kama
River manufacturing plant to build trucks for the
Soviet Army.
Some of the trucks are now known to have been
used in the Soviet military move into Afghanistan.
Testifying before a Senate investigations subcom
mittee. Perry said the sales were continued over Pen
tagon objections to sustain a policy of political de
tente with the Soviet Union.
As important as the drain of actual American
technology, he said, is the flow of "intellectual prop
erty." knowledge of how to build and maintain com
puters and sophisticated electronic systems.
Following the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan.
President Jimmy Carter ordered a temporary em
bargo on the granting to the Soviets of trade licenses
and the sale of spare parts for computers and other
sophisticated equipment.
The freeze covered the Kama plant, and other
installations, including Zil. an industrial facility
where trucks and missile launchers were manufac
tured with the use of American computers.
GOP debaters hit Carter policies
MANCHESTER. N.H. — Ronald Reagan, the re
luctant debater, joined George Bush and the rest of
the Republican presidential field last night in a
seven-way chorus of criticism directed at President
Jimmy Carter's foreign policy.
The candidates offered assorted proposals to deal
with inflation at home, and spent more time agreeing
than arguing during the forum that preceded next
Tuesday's New Hampshire presidential primary.
Reagan confronted his rivals for the first time,
declaring that the United States must signal the
Soviet Union "that there could be a confrontation
down the road" if Russian adventurism continues.
Six of the seven debaters agreed that the nation's
military budget should be boosted to signal the Rus
sians that the United States will not tolerate further
Soviet expansionism.
None of the candidates who advocated more de
fense spending offered specific dollar proposals.
All the debators except Reagan debated in lowa on
Jan. 5. At that point. Reagan was the man to beat. In
the Jan. 21 GOP caucuses. Bush beat him.
In the Des Moines debate, the candidates were
relatively restrained, with few harsh words for each
other. Reagan said he skipped that confrontation
because he feared it would be div isive.
Following his lowa defeat. Reagan said. "I was
wrong."
CIA implicated in Jonestown
WASHINGTON — A former aide to the late Rep.
Leo Ryan questioned yesterday whether the State
Department knowingly withheld information about
the Jonestown cult to protect a CIA operation in
Guyana.
Joe Holsinger told a House subcommittee a special
panel should be set up to probe such unanswered
questions about the Jonestown massacre.
Ryan, a California Democrat, and four others were
killed on Nov. IN, 1978. in an ambush shortly after
visiting Jonestown, a commune set up in Guyana by
the Rev. Jim Jones.
Investigators later found more than 900 residents
of Jonestown, including Jones, dead — the result of
what investigatosrs called a mass suicide-murder-.
The former administrative assistant to Ryan said
he had no proot that the CIA influenced the State
Department to withhold information about Jones
town from Ryan during briefings given the con
gressman before his trip to the commune.
He contended, however, that the CIA had an oper
ation in Guyana that was designed to support that
country's government and said "there are credible
reports that it (the mission) included covert support
from Jim Jones as an ally of Forbes Burnham (the
prime minister of Guyana).

A House committee investigated the Jonestown
massacre earlier. The subcommittee session was cal
led to determine whether the guidelines issued as a
result of the earlier investigations were being fol
lowed by the State Department.
State Department officials are scheduled to testify
next month.
The hearings were called at the request of Rep. Bill
Rover (R-Calif.) who succeeded Ryan in Congress.
British steel unions flex muscle
SHEERNESS, England — A mass of 1500 pickets
failed to shut dow 11 a steel plant here yesterday, while
elsewhere autoworkers angrily rejected a strike call,
in a double setback for Britain's powerful labor
movement.
Facing laws curbing strike activity from a Conser
vative government determined to change Britain's
labor-management balance, unions have been assert
ing their power in a seven-week-old strike that has
tied up steel production and shipments across Britain.
Several hundred coal miners from northern Eng
land and Scotland traveled to this south coast town to
join steel strikers putting pressure on 800 workers at
the privately owned Sheerness Steel Co.
Sheerness. where work has continued, has become
a symbol of resistance to the strike among private
industry workers who produce a quarter of Britain's
steel and have been dragged into a wage dispute
between unions and state-owned British Steel Corp.,
which has been losing money.
More than 1000 policemen, some brought in from
London, ringed the plant to forestall expected vio
lence. Police said 13 pickets were arrested and six
injured in isolated scuffles, but there was no major
trouble.
No recession forecast for 1980
WASHINGTON — Don't look now. but the reces
sion isn't here again. The latest figures show the
economy growing much stronger than previously
thought.
On the other hand, inflation is apparently worse.
The Commerce Department revised its figures on
economic growth yesterday to show that the nation's
gross national product increased at a 2.1 percent
annual rate in the final three months of 1979, rather
than the anemic 1.4 percent rate reported initially.
Although the Carter administration had forecast
an economic downturn during the first half of 1980,
the economy continues to expand with nearly two
months gone by.
One of the president's chief economic advisers,
Lylc Gramley. said in an interview that it is now
unlikely that a recession will begin in the first quarter
of the year.
Paul Volcker, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, agrees that the economy is continuing to out
perform recession forecasts. But he said this growth is
masking some serious problems, such as inflation,
low productivity and lagging investment.
He said inflation during the first three months of
the year could be worse that predicted, in part be
cause of the latest round of oil price increases.
Unfortuately, while continuing expansion of the
economy has a favorable impact on employment, it
can make fighting inflation more difficult as it means
businessmen and consumers are continuing to in
crease their output and purchase of goods, which
keeps upward pressure on prices.

NEW YORK — The stock market pulled out of a
three-session slide yesterday with a sharp rally led by
shares of energy companies drilling off the New
foundland coast.

had fallen 27.82 points in the previous three trading
days, recovered 10.84 to 886.86.
New York Stock Exchange volume totaled 44.34
million shares, against 39.48 million Tuesday.
