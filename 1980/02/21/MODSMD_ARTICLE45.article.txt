# Calif. floods go on
## 
### 
I"hc Associated Press with staff reports
The deluge in the West routed hun
dreds of people from their homes in
Arizona yesterday and damage esti
mates climbed to more than $350 mill
ion while Southern Californians got a
brief break between storms.
At least 27 people have died in acci
dents related to the storms in the past
week, including 20 in California, four
in Arizona and three Americans visit
ing Tijuana, Mexico.
A chain of five rainstorms in eight
days that left fashionable California
communities in muddy shambles built
new floods in Phoenix, Ariz. Yesterday
more storms were on the way.
More than 1500 people fled their
homes in the western suburbs of
Phoenix during the night and traffic
jams 10 miles long developed at entr
ances to the only two bridges still open
across the Salt River, which divides the
metropolitan area of 1.5 million
people.
Many parts of Arizona and Southern
California have been declared disaster
areas.
The National Weather Service lifted
a flash flood watch in Southern
California yesterday morning for the
first time since Sunday, but warned that
a sixth storm was expected to blow in
from the Pacific late today or early to
morrow.
Meanwhile, the fifth storm in a week
pushed into Northern California yes
terday afternoon, and the National
Weather Service said more rain could
be expected through Sunday.
At Stanford, Bruce Wiggins of
Facilities Operations and Mainte
nance, said his office received about 40
calls Tuesday to repair rain damage, a

record number. Many of the calls came
from the Law School, he added, where
clogged drains sent water through the
roof to damage a 20-by-2() foot section
of ceiling and soak some carpet.
About six people on his staff were
kept especially busy because damage
had accumulated over the three-day
weekend, Wiggins said.
It was a time for mopping up in other
parts of California as well. Four
thousand persons had been forced to
tlee as oozing mud buried homes and
automobiles, other houses toppled
down hillsides that gave way, and walls
of water cascaded through the canyons.
Shortages of food and water were
reported north of downtown Los
Angeles in Topanga Canyon, where a
15-foot wall of water gushed through
the exclusive neighborhood, flattening
houses and tearing gaping holes in To
panga Canyon Boulevard.
More than 300 elderly persons were
without power for a third day in Wood
land Hills near Los Angeles at the Mo
tion Picture and Television Country
House, which was hit by a 6-foot wall of
water that caused more than $500,000
damage.
Tens of thousands of homes across
the state also lost their electricity dur
ing the storms.
State Emergency Services Director
Alex Cunningham estimated property
damage in Southern California at $252
million. Losses to farmers were esti
mated at $26 million, with crops rotting
in soaked fields.
Gov. Jerry Brown, whose home in
Laurel Canyon was flooded, on Tues
day declared a state of emergency and
added four counties to the two where
property owners already were eligible
for low-interest disaster loans.
