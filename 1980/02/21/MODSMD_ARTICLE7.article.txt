# Carter: Olympic boycott final

### 
Soviets fail to meet deadline for troop withdrawal

From ihe Daily wire services
WASHINGTON â€” The Carter ad
ministration said yesterday the United
States will officially boycott the Mos
cow Olympics this summer and that
U.S. Olympic Committee officials and
athletes are expected to follow suit.
White House counsel Lloyd Cutler
made it clear that the committee, which
oversees U.S. participation in the
games, is being relied on to abide by
President Jimmy Carter's decision.
In Bonn, West Germany, chief State
Department spokesman Hodding Car
ter announced the final decision as the
deadline arrived for the Soviet Union
to pull its troops out of Afghanistan.
"Today is the da\ on which that deci
sion was going to be based. It is clear
there is no sign of a Soviet withdrawal.
The president has made clear that our
decision is therefore irrevocable. We
will not participate in the Olympics in
Moscow," the spokesman said.
In Washington, State Department

spokesman Thomas Reston said the
boycott decision is firm and unaltera
ble.
He said, "it is a position which is
shared by more than 50 governments
throughout the world and which will be
reflected, we are convinced, by the
nonparticipation by at least that
number of national Olympic teams in
Moscow."
The White House said in a written
statement that, with the month passed
and the Soviet forces remaining in Af
ghanistan, "the president has therefore
advised the United States Olympic
Committee that his decision remains
unchanged, and that we should not
send a team to Moscow."
Carter's Feb. 20 deadline for a
Soviet withdrawal passed without di
rect official comment from Moscow, al
though a top Communist Party official
did vow in a speech that "the Soviet
people will not be intimidated."
The comment came from Mikhail
Suslov, the 77-year old Kremlin
ideological chief who is considered to
be one of the most powerful men in the
ruling party Politburo. It was made at
about the same time that the White
House was confirming its intention to
push for a boycott of next summer's
Olympic Games in Moscow in light of
the continued Soviet troop presence in
Afghanistan.
Outrages hy the Soviet thrust into
Afghanistan, Carter served notice in a
Jan. 20 nationally broadcast address
that he was giving the Soviets 30 days
to withdraw or risk a U.S. boycott of
the Olympic Games in Moscow this
summer.
Reports from Kabul, the capital of
Afghanistan, yesterday said the troops
remained in the nation, and that a ru
mored "cosmetic" withdrawal of a li

mited number had not occurred.
Neither Soviet Officials nor the
Soviet press has ever publicly men
tioned Carter's deadline. Nor have
they ever directly acknowledged that
the U.S. threat of an Olympic boycott
is related to Soviet actions in that South
Asian country. Thus, the official si
lence over the passing of the deadline
yesterday was no surprise.
The Kremlin's official position has
been that a U.S. boycott alone would
not seriously damage the Summer
Games. The Kremlin also has concen
trated its propaganda efforts on trying
to head off any of the U.S. boycott
proposal, especially among the nations
of Western Europe.
Suslov accused the West of launch
ing "an undeclared war" against
socialist Afghanistan and added:
"The assistance in the struggle
against external aggression that was
provided by the Soviet Union to Af
ghanistan on the request of its leader
ship was used bv the government of the
United States as a pretext for launching
a campaign of blackmail, slander and
threats against our country.
"But the Soviet people will not be
intimidated. The American govern
ment's actions will inflict damage first
of all to the United States itself. The
dangerous zig-zags in U.S. policy un
dermine the prestige of that big power
of which the peoples expect a more
balanced and responsible policy."
Suslov's remarks came in a speech
made prior to Sunday's elections for
members of the Supreme Soviets (par
liaments) of the country's constituent
republics. He is the only candidate
from the Avtozavodsky district in the
Volga River valley of central Russia.
Excerpts of his speech were reported
by the official Tass news agency.
