# Effects on University disputed
## Locals comment on Jarvis II 
### Diana Hoffman Staff Writer 
Reation has been swift and divided
on the issue of Proposition 9, the
income-tax-cutting initiative which will
appear on the California June ballot.
The initiative, authored by Howard
Jarvis, would substantially cut scholar
ship grant funds received by college
and university students throughout the
state.

In preparation for the June vote, op
ponents of "Jarvis II" are forming a
statewide committee to fight Proposi
tion 9. Administrators from various
colleges and universities in California
are expected to join forces against the
initiative. In addition, students have
begun working separately for the
proposition's defeat.
One student group that actively op
poses Jarvis II is the local Coalition of
Independent College and University
Students (COPUS), a student organi
zation that is affiliated with a national
student lobby. Two members of the co
alition's Stanford chapter, Kenneth

Peter and Addie Swartz, attended a
January meeting of the Student Advis
ory Committee to the California Post
secondary Education Commission in
order to discuss Jarvis II and a number
of other issues.
"It is extremely important that Stan
ford students understand the far
reaching implications of this legisla
tion," said Swartz.
Although some University adminis
trators and students are worrying about
the possible results of Jarvis IPs enact
ment, their apprehension is by no
means universal. Alvin Rubushka, a
senior fellow at Hoover Institution,
said he favors the iniative. He asserted
that Jarvis IPs passage would lead to
increased investment, benefit busines
ses, and provide individual taxpayers
with more spending money. Voters,
said Rabushka, will have to weigh such
benefits against the budget cuts that
could be incurred by state-run agen
cies, programs and institutions.
According to Rabushka. the Univer
sity might be helped indirectly by Jarvis
11. He explained that Stanford's tuition
would seem less imposing if the state
schools were forced to raise their fees.
Parents and applicants, perceiving

state schools as no more of a bargain
than private schools, might use money
saved through the Proposition 9 tax cut
to pay for a Stanford education.
Supporters of Proposition 9 include
the United Organization of Taxpayers,
which was started about 16 years ago
by Howard Jarvis. According to a vol
unteer at the organization's Los
Angeles office, sources of information
about the initiative were not yet availa
ble there; however, preparations for
election day were expected to begin
soon.
Administrators here are wary of
making predictions about the effects
that Jarvis II would ultimately have on
higher education. Because there has
been insufficient time to assess the ef
fects of the property-tax-cutting Prop
osition 13 passed in 1978 and the so
called Gann Initiative passed last
November, Assoc. Vice President for
Public Affairs Robert Freelen said he
considers Jarvis II premature."
Rabushka summarized the Jarvis II
issue with a question: even if there is a
price to pay from having personal in
come taxes halved, isn't there also a
benefit being gained? In June, Califor
nia voters will give their answer.
