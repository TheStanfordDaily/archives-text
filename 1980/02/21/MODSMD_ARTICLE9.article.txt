## U.S. willing to discuss Afghanistan with USSR 
### Oswald Johnston The Los Angeles Times 
BONN — The Carter ad
ministration is willing to explore
directly with the Soviet Union
what conditions will lead that na
tion to withdraw its troops from
Afghanistan, a senior official
said Tuesday.
llie official spoke with repor
ters traveling with Secretary of
State Cyrus R. Vance, who is on
a mission to bring European
policies more in line with
Washington's.
They were told that the ad
ministration had not ruled out
the suggestion of some allies that
the Soviets be approached on
working out a political solution
in Afghanistan that would bring
about an end to that country's
occupation by an estimated
95.000 Soviet troops.
President Jimmy Carter has
publicly suggested a "neutral
government" in Afghanistan,
perhaps secured by a peace
keeping force of Islamic nations
under the auspices of the United
Nations. The French, among
others, have suggested that Af
ghanistan, now ruled by a pro-
Moscow Marxist government,
somehow return to its traditional
role as a "buffer state."
Disarray
Characteristic of the mild dis
array in the West following the
Sov ict move in Southwest Asia is
the fact that neither Washington
nor the four Western capitals
that Vance is scheduled to visit
— Bonne, Rome. Paris and Lon
don — has developed a coordi
nated strategy for dealing with
the new crisis in relations with
Moscow.
Accordingly, even though the
occupation of Afghanistan is
now nearly two months old,
there is no consensus on defining
the Soviets' long-range objective
and. still less, on how to counter

it. The suggested direct approach
has not been formally proposed,
and it may never be.
Even where there is agree
ment. such as on the need to re
store Afghanistan to a neutral,
buffer state role, there is little
agreement on how to do so.
Islamic force?
Carter s suggestion of an Is
lamic peace-keeping force, the
brainchild of Zbigniew
Brzezinski. his national security
adviser, appears not to be re
garded very seriously in the State
Department, and the whole
question of how to achieve a
satisfactory political solution in
Afghanistan is regarded as com
plex and remote.
A senior official traveling with
Vance told Reporters Tuesday
that it would be "unwise" to say
what the Soviets would have to
do beyond withdrawing their in
vading forces before U.S.-Soviet
relations could be restored to an
even keel.
That deliberate imprecision,
in turn, has led the Europeans to
express apprehension that
Washington is pushing too hard
for a confrontation between the
Soviets and the nations of
NATO.
Because of that apprehension,
the Americans are taking care to
disassociate NATO as such from
any military steps that individual
allies might take to beef up
Western defenses in the Persian
Gulf.
Piecemeal
Even this week's round of con
sultations. which began yester
day in the West German capital,
are being held on a piecemeal
basis rather than as foreign
ministers; mini-summit that the
Carter administration would
have preferred.

By the same token, the "coor
dinated response" that Vance is
seeking in Europe is now con
ceived of as a series of related
steps, in which each country
takes on a specific set of dip
lomatic, economic or military
steps.
In West Germany, where
along with Great Britain the U.S.
has received the most vocal sup
port. consultations are expected
to focus on ways in which
Europe's defenses against the
East can he enhanced so as to
free U.S. material and, if neces
sary. forces in the event of a
flare up in the Persian Gulf.
British forces
The British are expected to en
large their residual military pre
sence east of Suez, and the
French, whose naval hase at
Djibouti constitutes the largest
permanent presence in the In
dian Ocean-Red Sea region,
have been quietly consulted on
playing a role in an emergency.

revolution last summer. Political Science Prof. Richard Fagen

BONN — The Carter ad
ministration is willing to explore
directly with the Soviet Union
what conditions will lead that na
tion to withdraw its troops from
Afghanistan, a senior official
said Tuesday.
llie official spoke with repor
ters traveling with Secretary of
State Cyrus R. Vance, who is on
a mission to bring European
policies more in line with
Washington's.
They were told that the ad
ministration had not ruled out
the suggestion of some allies that
the Soviets be approached on
working out a political solution
in Afghanistan that would bring
about an end to that country's
occupation by an estimated
95.000 Soviet troops.
President Jimmy Carter has
publicly suggested a "neutral
government" in Afghanistan,
perhaps secured by a peace
keeping force of Islamic nations
under the auspices of the United
Nations. The French, among
others, have suggested that Af
ghanistan, now ruled by a pro-
Moscow Marxist government,
somehow return to its traditional
role as a "buffer state."
Disarray
Characteristic of the mild dis
array in the West following the
Sov ict move in Southwest Asia is
the fact that neither Washington
nor the four Western capitals
that Vance is scheduled to visit
— Bonne, Rome. Paris and Lon
don — has developed a coordi
nated strategy for dealing with
the new crisis in relations with
Moscow.
Accordingly, even though the
occupation of Afghanistan is
now nearly two months old,
there is no consensus on defining
the Soviets' long-range objective
and. still less, on how to counter

it. The suggested direct approach
has not been formally proposed,
and it may never be.
Even where there is agree
ment. such as on the need to re
store Afghanistan to a neutral,
buffer state role, there is little
agreement on how to do so.
Islamic force?
Carter s suggestion of an Is
lamic peace-keeping force, the
brainchild of Zbigniew
Brzezinski. his national security
adviser, appears not to be re
garded very seriously in the State
Department, and the whole
question of how to achieve a
satisfactory political solution in
Afghanistan is regarded as com
plex and remote.
A senior official traveling with
Vance told Reporters Tuesday
that it would be "unwise" to say
what the Soviets would have to
do beyond withdrawing their in
vading forces before U.S.-Soviet
relations could be restored to an
even keel.
That deliberate imprecision,
in turn, has led the Europeans to
express apprehension that
Washington is pushing too hard
for a confrontation between the
Soviets and the nations of
NATO.
Because of that apprehension,
the Americans are taking care to
disassociate NATO as such from
any military steps that individual
allies might take to beef up
Western defenses in the Persian
Gulf.
