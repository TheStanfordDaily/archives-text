AMAZING
NEW
CANCER
OPERATION
UNVEILED.
The doctor
doesn't cutout
anything. You
cut out cigarettes.
This simple
surgery is the
surest way to save
you from lung
cancer. And the
American Cancer
Society will help
you perform it.
We have free
clinics to help you
quit smoking. So,
before you smoke
another cigarette,
call the A.C.S.
office nearest you.
And don't put it
off. The longer
you keep smoking,
the sooner it can
kill you.
