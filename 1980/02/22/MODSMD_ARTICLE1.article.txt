# Proposed SLAC facility would be most powerful ever

University officials have unveiled plans to
huild a multimillion dollar underground addi
tion to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
that will hold an energy beam more than three
times more powerful than any other in the
world.
Officials plan to submit a proposal for the
addition, called a "single-pass collider," to the
Department of Energy next month.
Cost of the addition is now estimated to be
$60 million plus or minus 25 percent, said
Nobel laureate Burton Richter, the professor
at SLAC who proposed the project.
The collider will be about the same size as
SLAC's nearly completed Positron-Electron
Project ring, also situated underground. Part of
the collider crosses under the PEP ring.
Only one building will be above ground —
the experimental hall where two beams of 50-

billion electron volts collide to create a lorce ol
100 billion electron volts. Richter said.
This 100 billion electron volt energy level is
more than three times higher than any cur
rently created in the world. The next larger are
the beams at PEP and at the PET R A project in
Hamburg, Germany which produce about 30
billion electron volts each.
University officials Wednesday told the
Forum on Community and the Environment in
Palo Alto of their plans for proposing the pro
ject to DOE.
There was little reaction from the group,
comprised mostly of environmentalists and
Palo Alto citizens concerned about the job/
housing balance in the area, reported Andrew
Doty, director of community relations here.
"There were just a few questions about the
project," Doty said. " This was probably be
cause the addition will not involve a high inten
sity use of the land and because it will be

situated underground."
The new addition will require fewer than 50
new employees at SLAC, Doty said.
He said the project would be similar to the
PEP ring and that this addition was not seen by
the environmentalists as being damaging to the
area.
"Now that we're almost done with PEP.
people can see that the ground can be restored
to its old state," Doty said. "People are pretty
well satisfied that it hasn't disrupted the envi
ronment."
All in all, the Palo Alto community has been
satisfied with the PEP project, Doty said.
"They had a ba*d reaction when they first saw
the huge mounds of dirt, but now that the dirt
has been removed, and the grounds restored,
people are basically satisfied with it."he said.
SLAC Deputy Director Sidney Drell told
the Faculty Senate vesterdav that the PEP ring

is now in the finishing stages and that the beam
should start circulating in the ring sometime in
the next two or three weeks.
Richter said the collider project is designed
to look at a "different kind of physics" than the
PEP ring.
"The work of the PEP ring is to search for
the smallest thing, to discover the fundamental
constituents of matter," Richter said. "The
goal of the new project is to find out how many
forces there are in nature."
Traditional physics theory holds that there
are four independent forces in the world —
gravity, electricity, nuclear force and the weak
force (radioactivity).
But today's theorists believe that electricity
and radioactivity may be different manifesta
tions of the same force. If this notion is correct,
the unification of the two would become man
ifest in the collider, which is designed to get

into the energy range where such a manifesta
tion would be possible.
"The new theories would no longer be a
subtle inference," Richter said. "The manifes
tations would come out and knock you right in
the head."
Drell told the Faculty Senate that the col
lider project is a way of getting the same
technology for much less money than would be
required for building a larger, more powerful
system like the PEP ring.
SLAC today attracts physicists from all over
the world. There are usually 350 physicists at
one time at SLAC, 60 of whom are performing
experiments on the beams in the accelerator,
Drell said.
Two other centers in the United States —
Fermi in Chicago and Brookhaven near New
York — are also often used by researching
physicists.

University officials have unveiled plans to
huild a multimillion dollar underground addi
tion to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
that will hold an energy beam more than three
times more powerful than any other in the
world.
Officials plan to submit a proposal for the
addition, called a "single-pass collider," to the
Department of Energy next month.
Cost of the addition is now estimated to be
$60 million plus or minus 25 percent, said
Nobel laureate Burton Richter, the professor
at SLAC who proposed the project.
The collider will be about the same size as
SLAC's nearly completed Positron-Electron
Project ring, also situated underground. Part of
the collider crosses under the PEP ring.
Only one building will be above ground —
the experimental hall where two beams of 50-

billion electron volts collide to create a lorce ol
100 billion electron volts. Richter said.
This 100 billion electron volt energy level is
more than three times higher than any cur
rently created in the world. The next larger are
the beams at PEP and at the PET R A project in
Hamburg, Germany which produce about 30
billion electron volts each.
University officials Wednesday told the
Forum on Community and the Environment in
Palo Alto of their plans for proposing the pro
ject to DOE.
There was little reaction from the group,
comprised mostly of environmentalists and
Palo Alto citizens concerned about the job/
housing balance in the area, reported Andrew
Doty, director of community relations here.
"There were just a few questions about the
project," Doty said. " This was probably be
cause the addition will not involve a high inten
sity use of the land and because it will be

situated underground."
The new addition will require fewer than 50
new employees at SLAC, Doty said.
He said the project would be similar to the
PEP ring and that this addition was not seen by
the environmentalists as being damaging to the
area.
"Now that we're almost done with PEP.
people can see that the ground can be restored
to its old state," Doty said. "People are pretty
well satisfied that it hasn't disrupted the envi
ronment."
All in all, the Palo Alto community has been
satisfied with the PEP project, Doty said.
"They had a ba*d reaction when they first saw
the huge mounds of dirt, but now that the dirt
has been removed, and the grounds restored,
people are basically satisfied with it."he said.
SLAC Deputy Director Sidney Drell told
the Faculty Senate vesterdav that the PEP ring

is now in the finishing stages and that the beam
should start circulating in the ring sometime in
the next two or three weeks.
Richter said the collider project is designed
to look at a "different kind of physics" than the
PEP ring.
"The work of the PEP ring is to search for
the smallest thing, to discover the fundamental
constituents of matter," Richter said. "The
goal of the new project is to find out how many
forces there are in nature."
Traditional physics theory holds that there
are four independent forces in the world —
gravity, electricity, nuclear force and the weak
force (radioactivity).
But today's theorists believe that electricity
and radioactivity may be different manifesta
tions of the same force. If this notion is correct,
the unification of the two would become man
ifest in the collider, which is designed to get

into the energy range where such a manifesta
tion would be possible.
"The new theories would no longer be a
subtle inference," Richter said. "The manifes
tations would come out and knock you right in
the head."
Drell told the Faculty Senate that the col
lider project is a way of getting the same
technology for much less money than would be
