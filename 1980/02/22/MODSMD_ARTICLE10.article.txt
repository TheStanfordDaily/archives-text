Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
and President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr again called for the re
turn of the deposed shah and his
wealth to Iran. Meanwhile, lack
of agreement on when the U.S.
hostages will be freed delayed
the arrival of the U.N. investigat
ing panel in Tehran until the
weekend.
In a speech carried on Tehran
Radio, Khomeini, Iran's ailing
79-year-old revolutionary
leader, told his countrymen
Wednesday to "forcefully de
mand from the U.S.A. and any
other government which may
have risen in defense of the crim
inal, Mohammad Re/.a Pahlavi,
that this criminal be returned to
us together with the nation's law
ful riches, and do not rest until
final victory."
Bani-Sadr, in an interview
with the Tehran correspondent
of a French-Canadian radio
program, afso repeated his gov
ernment's determination to re
trieve the shah, who it charges
plundered the national treasury
and killed thousands of political
opponents during his 37-year
reign.
The lawyer representing Iran
in its bid to extradite the, shah
from Panama — former
Panamanian Supreme Court Jus
tice Juan Materno Vazquez —
said in a telephone interview
from Panama City he expected

to have documents needed for
his case in about two weeks.
Deadlines
Under Panamanian law, Iran
has until March 22 to present the
documents, which include proof
of the shah's identity, a warrant
for his arrest and the legal
charges and probable penalties
against him under Iranian law.
However, Panamanian officials
doubt Iran will be able to meet
the deadline.
Nonetheless, Iranian au
thorities seem determined to
press for the shah's extradition.
Some observers speculated this
may be a long-term goal, unre
lated to the hostages, while
others believe it may be a
strategy to appease the militants
holding the Americans.
The cloudiness of the situation
was underscored in the interview
with Bani-Sadr, when the Ira
nian president said the work of
the U.N. commission of inquiry
going to Iran would not be di
rectly linked to release of the ap
proximately 53 Americans held
hostage in Tehran for 110 days.
He would not say whether the
estimated 50 hostages at the U.S.
Embassy and three others at the
Foreign Ministry in Tehran
would be freed either before or
after the committee's report.
Delicate
Neither would U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim. There was "no deadline

tor the whole procedure" of their
release, he said at a news confer
ence at the United Nations in
New York. He declined to he
specific when asked whether'
there was an understanding on
the timing for their freedom, say
ing "This is a very delicate mat
ter."
However, a well-placed U.N.
diplomat said the panel's depar
ture, originally scheduled from
Geneva, Switzerland, on Wed
nesday, had been delayed speci
fically because no agreement had
been reached on the timing of
the Americans' freedom.
"That's the remaining thing to
be worked out — as to when and
where they are going to be re
leased," said the diplomat, who
asked not to be identified.
Carter backs off"?
U.S. officials refused to say
whether Iran has agreed to re
lease the hostages in conjunction
with actions taken by the panel,
hut it now appears President
Jimmy Carter has hacked away
from his earlier insistence that
the hostages be freed before the
panel begins its work.
The commission was to inves
tigate Iranian charges against the
shah and the United States,
which the Khomeini regime says
interfered in the country's affairs
by aiding the monarch until his
ouster 13 months ago.

But Waldheim ordered the
panel to delay its departure after
receiving a message from Bani-
Sadr that made a new request
that the panel interview the hos
tages and in the words of a U.N.
spokesman, left "open ques
tions" on the panel's work.
Clarifications
The nature of the questions
and whether they had been re
solved was not disclosed. But in
Geneva, one of the panel mem
bers said "clarifications" were
needed to "avoid any interpreta
tions (of the commission's man
date ) which might cause difficul
ties in our work."
The Carter administration,
which approved the mission last
weekend, said it accepted the
Iranian demand for a meeting
with the hostages as long as they
were not interrogated, and as
long as the commission did not
become a tribunal.
A White House statement said
it was "vital" the commission as
sess the condition of the hos
tages, who have not been seen
collectively by an impartial ob
server since the embassy was
seized Nov. 4 — shortly after the
shah was admitted to the United
States to receive medical treat
ment at a hospital in New York.
The monarch flew to Panama
Dec. 15.
