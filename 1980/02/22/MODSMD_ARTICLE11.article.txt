# Fragility underlies German economy
## 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
Behind West Germany's
"trademark of stability" lies a
fragility which may endanger
democracy and peace as the
country faces economic prob
lems in the 1980s, said Prof.
Peter Katzenstein of Cornell
University.
"Germans prize internal sec
urity but have a low domestic to
lerance for change," he told an
audience of 50 in a lecture spon
sored by the Department of
Political Science on Tuesday.
The task of adjusting to exter
nally imposed changes, such as
inflation driven by energy costs,
may create a "crack in the wall,"
because "Germans can't tolerate
an inflation rate of 12 percent,"
said Katzenstein. originally from
Hamburg.
In times of great change. West

German governments have de
monstrated that they value in
ternal stability over civil liber
ties, by "cleaning the bureauc
racy of undesirable elements,
that is, leftists," and resorting to
methods of advanced com
puterized surveillance and pre
ventive detention, he said.
Pointing to the widespread
view of West Germany as a
model of political success, Kat
zenstein said, "'l'm worried
about the admiration and lack of
critical attention in the Ameri
can press . . . when Germans ag
ree, others should worry."
Key ingredients
The key ingredients to West
Germany's success have been a
centralized private sector and
powerful "para-public institu
tions." he said. Together, they
have championed price stability
through a mixture of "mac
roeconomic policy, a strong
monetarist bent and indirect
controls," he added.
Industrial federations and
powerful unions have forged "an
intimate link between industry
and finance," he said, pointing to
the speed with which major
banks facilitated the former
Shah of Iran's West German in
vestments.
Powerful unions have main
tained industrial peace by using
their own bank to "facilitate the
impact of technology upon
employment and to invest in cer
tain industries while keeping a
high proportion of assets liquid,"
Katzenstein said.

Correspondingly, "para
puhlic institutions provide a
meeting place tor the public and
private sectors," resulting in
"neo-corporatism," he said.
Through a federal reserve sys
tem staffed by members of large
private banks, and a committee
which regulates access to priv ate
markets, staffed by public and
private sector actors. West Ger
many has been successful at
managing its economy.
In addition, a labor office has
been directing the transportation
of millions of migrant workers
from southern Europe to pro
vide export industries with
needed labor, he said. Peaking at
four million migrant workers in
1973, the process has occurred
quietly and only recently has
aroused concern.
"There are chilling similarities
here to German policies in the
1930s and '405," he added.
Furthermore, with the aid of 5
percent of West Germany's in
come tax revenues, churches
have provided social services
which the government has re
fused to. A social advisory coun
cil, representing "everybody
who has a stake," allocates in
creases in pensions, he said.
Unsuccessful reform
Other powers are dispersed in
the states, which account for HO
percent of West Germany's pub
lic expenditures, through the in
stitution of federalism, he said.
The educational system, for

example, is under the jurisdic
tion of the states, but efforts at
university reform have been un
successful because of the ab
sence of para-public institutions
and the resulting politicization of
issues, Katzenstein said.
"Political parties have become
instruments of governance more
than of representation, reinforc
ing para-public institutions," he
said. "This has come about
through large state financing, in
clusion in the constitution and
representation in para-public in
stitutions."
West Germans are divided
over how crucial the year 1945
was to the formation of the cur
rent power structure, he said.
Liberals and conservatives point
to U.S. occupation policies
which reinforced "the decen
tralized model," while the elimi
nation of the landed gentry arid
the army encouraged the cen
tralization of the private sector.
Leftists, however, insist that
the capitalist structure already
existed, referring to para-public
institutions which pre-date
1945, said Katzenstein. "To a
certain extent, both are right,"
he said.
"West Germany has reaped
the benefits of productivity and a
stable social welfare state," he
said. "But she has blended too
little change within too much
change outside," thus making
the current political structure
"both a model and a problem."
