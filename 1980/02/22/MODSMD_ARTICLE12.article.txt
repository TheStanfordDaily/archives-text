LONDON (AP) — South Africa undoubtedly
has developed the capability to produce nuclear
bombs, and tne United States must share responsi
bility for it, a defense analyst said Wednesday in a
report by the British Anti-Apartheid Society.
The report, written by University of London
researcher Dan Smith, said there is "very strong"
evidence hut "no definitive proof' that the South
Africans have already built a small atomic arsenal.
It cited no new evidence beyond previously dis
closed U.S. satellite sightings of what may have
been nuclear test structures in South Africa's

Kalahari Desert in 1977 and a nuclear blast-like
"flash" in the region of South Africa last year.
The United States has been "perhaps the most
important foreign source of expertise," the report
said, because by mid-1977 more than 155 Ameri
can nuclear specialists had visited South Africa to
provide assistance under the "Atoms for Peace"
program.
The British society said the report was issued in
cooperation with the U.N. Center Against Apar
theid. White-ruled South Africa's system of racial
segregation is called apartheid.
