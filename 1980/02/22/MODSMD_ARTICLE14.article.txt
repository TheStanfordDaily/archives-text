This column is beginning to be as effective as the
ASSU Senate. (Take that however you want!) I
have another success story to report, which actually
should have been in last week's column.
A student wrote in a month or two ago, asking
about the key to a display case outside the Geology
corner. Well, it turns out that Lively Arts has had
the key all along, but just didn't know it. When they
changed personnel last year, the key was passed on
as unlabeled, and nobody ever found a need to use
the glass case.
Lively Arts is checking up on the cases now, but
not in time to get the sought-after poster, the ob
ject of the student's query. Dick Meyer from the
Carpenter Shop here has already removed it in
order that it may be given to the student. So, if the
original requestor will please contact me, we can
end this silly story!

Dear Bug Me,
How come the bulletin board by the store is still
down? I'm getting tired of reading notices through
bicycle spokes.
A Notice Noticer
"I don't know why it was ever taken down," said
Tresidder facilities manager Jeff Nelson. In any
case, the board has been reattached to its wall.
This may not be a permanent solution. Nelson
said that the bulletin board is in a had location
because bicycles are always parked there. He got
an estimate to put in a kiosk, similar to those in
White Plaza, hut the $4500 price tag was too high,
so Tresidder is looking into "something a little hit
cheaper" to replace the present board with.

Dear Bug Me,
/ hope, for my sanity and that of my friends and
associates, that you will be able to shed some light on
the meaning of a certain expression. I have no idea
how or from where it originated, or what its signifi
cance might be.
The expression is simply this : RABBIT. One
"rabbits" a friend on the first of every month by
saying "rabbit" before the other person has a fhance
to "rabbit" you. Would you be so kind as to look
into this for me?
A Fan
Well, it's nice to have fans, even if they subject
you to questions like this one. The rabbit custom is
widely known but seldom in the exact same fash
ion. Basically, it's a superstition supposed to bring
the participant good luck.
Senior Maggie Peters, like the other students
here I've asked, learned the custom from a friend.
Her version of "rabbit" is that it must be the first
thing you say on the first of each month. Peters
leaves a note by her alarm clock as a reminder on

the last night of the month.
Peters said there are ways to get around the
custom and still have good luck. If you miss the first
day, then on the second morning of the month you
must jump off your bed backwards and say "tib
bar." Or you can avoid the monthly hassle by sim
ply shouting "rabbit" 1 2 times at midnight on New
Year's Eve, while standing on a chair!
Like most people who participate in the rabbit
syndrome, Peters is not distraught if she misses a
month. "It's all for your own good," she said, but
it's not all that important.
As for the origin, I'm afraid I will have neither
the time nor the resources to discover it. I will,
however, appeal to the vast worldly group of Daily
readers and ask that anybody who can contribute
to this profound subject please drop me a line

Dear Bug Me,
I like to jog, and frequently / run the disli, the road
west of Stanford that winds up to the radar telescope
device in the hills. My problem is this: the many
cows and hulls that graze in these hills give me the
bloody creeps. I'm afraid that one day one of these
limeys will charge right after me. I'm especially ap
prehensive about the approach of spring and the
mating season! Is it safe? I'm from England and
don't know much about mese American animals.
U.S.
I'm from San Francisco, so I know all about
American animals. This particular species grazes
on land the University leases to Manuel Piers of
Piers Dairy. There are, it seems, no known reports
of anybody ever being hurt by the cows.
In fact, said Zera Coleman, assistant to the man
ager of real estate, the animals usually scatter when
approached by humans, Both Coleman and Her
bert Kong, superintendent of labor and grounds,
said that they didn't believe there were anv bulls on
the hill.
Coleman also pointed out that joggers and hik
ers are required to have a permit to use the trails on
the leased land. The permits are free to anybody
with a Stanford I D. and are obtainable from the
receptionist in Room 105 Encina.
