ROME — Midway through
his whirlwind tour of Europe,
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance is
finding that his mission in large
part involves calming public
tears and doubts about U.S.
policies in the wake of the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
Little has been divulged about
the substance of Vance's talks
here and in Bonn on Wednesday
with Italian and West German
leaders. But in public state
ments, Vance has dealt with
four specific concerns:
—7"he United States is not re
ally serious in its new hard-line
approach to the Russians. Vance
and his spokesman, Hodding
Carter III, caused a stir among
German newsmen Wednesday
when they remarked matter-of
factly in Bonn that the United

States with Soviet troops still in
Afghanistan as Wednesday's
deadline arrived, "will not at
tend . . . will not participate in
the Moscow Olympics."
—The United States wants to
lead Europe into a new East-
West confrontation. Vance and
his spokesman explained that de
tente is only as dead as the
Soviets want to make it, and that
multilateral arms control talks
and diplomatic negotiations with
Moscow that were begun in the
early 1970s are technically still
alive.
—The United States is con
centrating on short-term
tactical responses to
the Soviet invasion without
thinking out a serious and practi
cal long-range way to deal with
the new realities posed by the
Soviet power grab in a region of
vital interest to Europe.
