# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editors perspective Daily fee assessment 
### 
You may have already been, or soon will
be, asked to sign a petition now being circu
lated by members of the Daily staff which
will place the Daily's request for a three
quarter fee assessment on this spring's
ASSU ballet. I'd like to make it clear why
the Daily is. once again, seeking an assess
ment.
When the Daily gained its independence
from the University in the spring of
1973, we had projected that our advertising
revenues would be more than sufficient to
sustain the newspaper's operation as well
as build its financial base, in order to en
sure the long-term financial stability of the
newspaper.
The Daily collected no fee assessment
money in the '74-'75 academic year, but it
did collect a $17.500 fee from the Univer
sity. That year, the Daily lost $41,000.
Clearly, the weakened economy that year
had not allowed the Daily to meet its finan
cial goals. Without help from the student
body, the Daily would not have been able
to continue publishing, at least on its pre
sent schedule and with a sizable number of
pages. In the spring of 1975. when the
Daily was presenting its fee assessment re
quest to students before the election, the
Daily. in all seriousness, answered the
often-asked question of" What will happen
to the Daily if the fee assessment fails?"
with a two-word answer: "We'll fold."
(Daily, April 14. 1975.)
Well, the assessment passed, with a 58
percent "Yes" vote, and the Daily con
tinued publishing, and began to grow.
We've grown quite a bit since 1975.
Now. almost five years after that election,
the Daily has an accumulated surplus of
approximately $175,000. and the frequent
six-page issues of the past have given way
to an average daily issue of more than 1 1
pages. With such a secure financial base,
the rational for our fee assessment request
must be clearly demonstrable
As The Stanford Daily Publishing Cor
poration Board of Directors stated Tues
day in a detailed financial statement for
the corporation, as an organization grows,
and prospers, so too do its obligations and
risks increase. We are accepting more re
sponsibility for the maintenance of the
Storke Publications Building, including
long-term care of the building's inner
structure, something no other campus stu
dent group need plan for.
The Daily's growth is also pushing its
production facilities to the limit. As the
typesetting equipment of the ASSU

Typesetting Shop gets older, the likelihood
increases that, without sufficient backup
for the present system, the Daily might
miss one or more publishing days in the
future. It may not happen this spring, but it
may happen next year, and the odds grow
against us as each quarter passes. This
campus deserves better than to have a
newspaper which publishes only when cir
cumstances permit.
The Daily's current consideration of a
computer typesetting and editing system
should not be viewed as an educational toy
for the Daily staff. A large portion of such a
system's cost is for the necessary equip
ment to keep up with the Daily's growing
production needs; the rest will go toward
an important educational tool for those
students here who are intent on learning
the latest in journalistic skills. With its in
dependence. the Daily assumed the role of
campus journalism laboratory. The Uni
versity has saved countless tuition dollars
by not having to provide students here with
a daily newspaper laboratory. Your $3
yearly fee assessments have given this
campus much more than what comparable
tuition dollars might have in this area.
The newspaper industry is also at the
whim of its suppliers. Newsprint is a tradi
tionally scarce and increasingly expensive
commodity. Our printer's contract, as you
might expect, has a built-in cost-of-living
adjustment under which we assume re
sponsibility for all unexpected newsprint
price hikes.
The risks the Daily takes are unusual for
a group seeking fee assessment money.
But. we are not an organization operating
only within this closed campus. Our busi
ness forces us to enter into the always un
certain business world outside campus.
For those students who do not collect
their fee assessment refunds, the Daily will
cost less than 2 cents an issue next year, just
as it has this year, and the last three years.
Finally, 1 want to emphasize that the de
cision to seek a fee assessment for next year
was made by a board of directors, a major
ity of whom are not Daily staff members.
The decision was not made thoughtlessly,
without reflection on the past, or foresight
to the future. It was a decision which the
nine-member board made with one prim
ary goal in mind: to ensure the continued
financial stability of the Daily so that we
can continue to serve this community as
best we can.

may happen next year, and the odds grow
against us as each quarter passes. This
campus deserves better than to have a
newspaper which publishes only when cir
cumstances permit.
The Daily's current consideration of a
computer typesetting and editing system
should not be viewed as an educational toy
for the Daily staff. A large portion of such a
system's cost is for the necessary equip
ment to keep up with the Daily's growing
production needs; the rest will go toward
an important educational tool for those
students here who are intent on learning
the latest in journalistic skills. With its in
dependence. the Daily assumed the role of
campus journalism laboratory. The Uni
versity has saved countless tuition dollars
by not having to provide students here with
a daily newspaper laboratory. Your $3
yearly fee assessments have given this
campus much more than what comparable
tuition dollars might have in this area.
The newspaper industry is also at the
whim of its suppliers. Newsprint is a tradi
tionally scarce and increasingly expensive
commodity. Our printer's contract, as you
might expect, has a built-in cost-of-living
adjustment under which we assume re
sponsibility for all unexpected newsprint
price hikes.
The risks the Daily takes are unusual for
a group seeking fee assessment money.
But. we are not an organization operating
only within this closed campus. Our busi
ness forces us to enter into the always un
certain business world outside campus.
For those students who do not collect
their fee assessment refunds, the Daily will
cost less than 2 cents an issue next year, just
as it has this year, and the last three years.
Finally, 1 want to emphasize that the de
cision to seek a fee assessment for next year
was made by a board of directors, a major
ity of whom are not Daily staff members.
The decision was not made thoughtlessly,
without reflection on the past, or foresight
to the future. It was a decision which the
nine-member board made with one prim
ary goal in mind: to ensure the continued
financial stability of the Daily so that we
can continue to serve this community as
best we can.

You may have already been, or soon will
be, asked to sign a petition now being circu
lated by members of the Daily staff which
will place the Daily's request for a three
quarter fee assessment on this spring's
ASSU ballet. I'd like to make it clear why
the Daily is. once again, seeking an assess
ment.
When the Daily gained its independence
from the University in the spring of
1973, we had projected that our advertising
revenues would be more than sufficient to
sustain the newspaper's operation as well
as build its financial base, in order to en
sure the long-term financial stability of the
newspaper.
The Daily collected no fee assessment
money in the '74-'75 academic year, but it
did collect a $17.500 fee from the Univer
sity. That year, the Daily lost $41,000.
Clearly, the weakened economy that year
had not allowed the Daily to meet its finan
cial goals. Without help from the student
body, the Daily would not have been able
to continue publishing, at least on its pre
sent schedule and with a sizable number of
pages. In the spring of 1975. when the
Daily was presenting its fee assessment re
quest to students before the election, the
Daily. in all seriousness, answered the
often-asked question of" What will happen
to the Daily if the fee assessment fails?"
with a two-word answer: "We'll fold."
(Daily, April 14. 1975.)
Well, the assessment passed, with a 58
percent "Yes" vote, and the Daily con
tinued publishing, and began to grow.
We've grown quite a bit since 1975.
Now. almost five years after that election,
the Daily has an accumulated surplus of
approximately $175,000. and the frequent
six-page issues of the past have given way
to an average daily issue of more than 1 1
pages. With such a secure financial base,
the rational for our fee assessment request
must be clearly demonstrable
As The Stanford Daily Publishing Cor
poration Board of Directors stated Tues
day in a detailed financial statement for
the corporation, as an organization grows,
and prospers, so too do its obligations and
risks increase. We are accepting more re
sponsibility for the maintenance of the
Storke Publications Building, including
long-term care of the building's inner
structure, something no other campus stu
dent group need plan for.
The Daily's growth is also pushing its
production facilities to the limit. As the
typesetting equipment of the ASSU

Typesetting Shop gets older, the likelihood
increases that, without sufficient backup
for the present system, the Daily might
miss one or more publishing days in the
future. It may not happen this spring, but it
may happen next year, and the odds grow
against us as each quarter passes. This
campus deserves better than to have a
