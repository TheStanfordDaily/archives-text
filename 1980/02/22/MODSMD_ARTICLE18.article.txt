## Big Apple not rotten to NYC residents 
### 
As life-long residents of New
York City, we were seething with
anger when we rend Elliot
Roseman's column on the "rot
ten" Big Apple [Daily. Feb. 14).
It is not that we cannot accept
criticism of our hometown;
rather, we cannot accept criti
cism when it is derived from a
rather narrow perspective.
In his column. Roseman refers
to New York as a place of "out
standing museums, fabulous re
staurants. magnificent architec
ture, superb entertainment and
wondrous diversity" and de
clared that"spending a few years
at the New York headquarters of
a firm is often a prerequisite for

rising to a top position."
While we will be the first to
state that this is a great part of
New York, it is not the only thing
that makes the city what it is. It
seems to us that Roseman's
"New York" consists of only
midtown Manhattan. By just get
ting to know this part of New
York, it is no wonder that he
comes to the conclusion that
"People do not take responsibil
ity for helping others in New
York."
Midtown Manhattan is an area
of about two square miles. Every
working day 10 million people
enter this area. Many are people
who come to New York for no

other reason than to do business.
The only New York they know is
the New York of the headlines.
Many are tourists who are
"forewarned" by people such as
Roseman about New York.
Is it any wonder that from this
perspective New York seems
like a cold, tough, uncaring
place? If. however. Roseman
and others would take a subway
to upper Manhattan and the
other four boroughs where
seven-eighths of all New Yorkers
live, they might get a different
perspective.
If, as he states, people are cold
and uncaring in New York, how
can he account for the thousands
of block parties that take place
each summer, the thousands of
storefront social clubs, the scores
of parades, religious and
neighborhood festivals, the
block associations which have
blossomed in the past decade,
and last, but not least, the quin
tessential New York corner
bars?
If the streets of New York are
so bad, why can kids always be
found playing the New York
street games â€” stoopball, pun
chball, stickball and others?
Did you, Roseman, ever visit
the close-knit ethnic com
munities of New York? If New
York is such a bad place to raise a
family, why did hundreds-of
thousands of families escaping
persecution in Europe choose to
live almost exclusively in New
York? More recently, why has
there been such a huge influx of
Hispanic people into New York,
as well as others?
Did you ever spend much time
in a Puerto Rican bodega (more
a social club than a grocery
store), a cafe in an Italian
neighborhood in Brooklyn or the
Bronx, a Greek pastry shop in
Astoria, a kielbasa store in
Greenpoint, or just a local tavern
(not a tourist trap on 67th
street)?
New York is one of the most
generous cities in the world, de
spite its toughness. It has been,
and will continue to be, the place
where all, executive and laborer,
can come to get ahead.

The U.S. Census Bureau
acknowledges that despite its in
creasing population. New York
will lose several congressional
seats due to difficulties in count
ing poor and immigrant families.
Contrary to Roseman's belief,
this loss of political power is not a
"blessing for New York." The
loss of tax revenues to support
the booming Southwest could
only be worsened by this occurr
ence. Additionally, New York's
legislators have always been at
the forefront of progressive
causes at the national level.
We are not denying that New
York has its problems. But be
cause New York is almost three
times as large as the second
largest city, its problems seem
huge. The fact is that New York's
crime rate is eighth among the
major cities of the United States,
behind those of Houston and San

Francisco, for instance. It was
the only major city not to have
race riots in the past two de
cades.
Life is hard in the worst of
New York slums, but the efforts
of the inhabitants to improve
their neighborhoods are not
made any easier by people who
make casual comments about
them, without any real concept
of what is going on there.
May we suggest to you, Rose
man, that next time you are in
New York you let a true local
take you around. Sure, he'll
show you the sights, but he'll also
show you a side of New York you
probably never thought existed.
