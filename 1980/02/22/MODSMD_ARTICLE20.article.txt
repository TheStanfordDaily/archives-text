# Dilettante guilty in the worst degree
## 
### 
And further, by these, my son, be
admonished: of making many
books there is no end; and much
study is a weariness of the flesh.
Ecclesiastes 12:12
The major offered Captain
Harris his condolences. "It's too
bad the Dilettante had to be in
your company, captain. I sup
pose you realize you've got as
much chance now of getting te
nure as we do of putting a man on
the moon."
"We did put a man on the
moon," said the captain, "over
ten years ago."
"Really?" asked the major.
"I'll have to tell my wife."
"But you're not married."
"Don't quibble, captain. You
damn philosophers are always
quibbling over definitions. It
makes me sick."
"But you're a philosopher
too." said Captain Harris.
"Yes. But can you prove it?"
Suddenly, they were inter
rupted by Colonel Green. The
colonel, who had presided at the
Dilettante's court-martial, was
holding the squirming Dilettante
by the ears.
"It's too bad about the Dilet
tante," said the colonel. "He
seemed to have a decent mind
when he came here."
"Yes," said the major. "It's a
pity. 1 wonder what could have
happened to him. He seemed all

right before he took my course."
"That's true," said the Dilet
tante. "It's a mystery, isn't it?"
The colonel picked up the Di
lettante by the ears and dragged
him to the reviewing stand where
the general was waiting. Captain
Harris stood on his toes to get a
better view of the general. He
was deeply impressed by the
general's unwavering single
mindedness. The general is a
true scholar, thought the captain.
Captain Harris thought about
the court-martial that had been
staged that morning for the least
single-minded cadet in his com
pany. The captain had been
forced to sit next to the cadet. It
was the most embarrassing event
in his life, and he would re
member it for the rest of his life,
which, you may have guessed,
would not prove to be a very dif
ficult task, considering.
"You are charged," said Colonel
Green, "with being interested in
something besides your re
search. Do you understand the
seriousness of this accusation?"
"If I don't." said the accused,
"will you let me off?"
" Do chickens lay eggs?" asked
the colonel.
"As a matter of fact, they do."
said the accused.
The colonel snapped his pen
cil. "Major, strike those last re
marks from the record. We will

have no more trick questions.
Accused, how do you plead?"
"Guilty as charged, and then
some."
"That's not fair," said the pro
secutor. "I went to a great deal of
trouble gathering all this evi
dence and arranging it for a tidy
presentation. And 1 practiced my
speech all morning in front of the
mirror."
"Go ahead with your presen
tation." said the colonel. "I'm
sure the accused has no objec
tion."
"I object." said the accused.
"Who cares?" said the col
onel. "Proceed, Mr. Pro
secutor."
"We charge that the accused,
being a member of the

Philosophy Battalion, did will
fully waste his time by studying
poetry, history, chemistry and
worse. Not only did he read tor
hidden books, but he did so with
no intention of publishing the re
sults of his study. He confessed
to having read them, and I quote,
'to learn something." "
A wave of growing indiffer
ence rolled through the room.
"I have no choice but to find
you guilty in the worst degree,"
said the colonel. "You are
hereb> declared a Dilettante and
sentenced to expulsion. It's too
bad we can't shoot you. At least
that would teach you a lesson
you'd never forget."
The general's voice over the
public address system brought
Captain Harris' mind back to a
state resembling consciousness.
"Do you have anything to say
before the sentence is carried
out?" asked the general.

The Dilettante thought for a
moment. "Could you promise
not to tell my parents?"
"You have my word as a scho
lar." said the general.
"Would you mind putting that
in writing? I've got this sneaky
feeling you're going to want to
publish this. You know, force of
habit."
"Nonsense," said the general.
"There's no publication that
would touch this trash. You have
nothing to fear."
One of the general's aides tap
ped him on the shoulder and
whispered into his ear.
"The Daily?" said the general.
"Not a bad idea, lieutenant. Re
mind me to demote you."
Then the general ripped the

stripes from the Dilettante's
iform. He scattered the Dilet
tante's thesis notes with glee.
Then the Dilettante marched
down Palm Drive between two
rows of cadets who were jeering
at attention. When he got to the
end he stood in the intersection
and thumbed his nose at the
University. While doing so he
was run over and killed by a bus.'
News of the near tragedy
traveled down the two rows of
cadets at the speed of rumor.
When the message reached the
general, he looked heavenward
and smiled.
That evening. Captain Harris
typed his letter of resignation
and signed it. Then he locked the
door to his study and took a let
hal overdose of Kant.
