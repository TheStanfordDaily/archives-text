## Case against boycotts bankrupt 
### 
John Mason is "frightened" by the pros
pect of consumer boycotts (Daily, Feb. 13),
and his column urges, in a flurry of norma
tive non sequiturs, that such an economic
strategy be abandoned in favor of political
alternatives which, in his own words, are
"slow" and"frustratingly torpid." His case is
bankrupt from start to finish.
First, he notes, boycotts are decided by
rumor and hearsay, without a "careful
examination of evidence." But where did he
ever get the idea that "voting with ballots"
was any more impartial and well-informed?
Mason's call for better lobbying, better
laws, and better enforcement of those laws
now on the books is more than "naive" and
"idealistic;" it is tacit acceptance of a politi
cal and legal system that has never had the
interest of consumers as its primary concern.
Boycotts, with all their potential for abuse,
are the only direct way for consumers to say
no to corporations whose policies they de
plore.
Mason acknowledges this point. Corpora
tions "fear" boycotts, while legal proceed
ings are "little more than a nuisance." Good.
But rather than following this admission to
its logical conclusion, Mason turns around
with a deft misdirection and compares
boycotts to "lynch mobs." A nice rhetorical

device.
In fact, we do not have a political nation in
which economic institutions are a subsidiary
and obedient social force; we live in an
economic system in which political institu
tions have derivative and secondary influ
ence. More often than not, political and legal
institutions reinforce the power of corpora
tions and industry — no one who watches the
operations of Federal courts and regulatory
boards can claim otherwise.
For example, in a recent issue of The Na
tion, it was reported that federal judges are
receiving retraining in economics, from a de
cidedly biased point of view, paid for by pri
vate corporations, in order that the judges
might be "better informed" when handling
anti-corporate legal cases.
Better economic training is not the issue,
of course; rather, it is a question of whose
interests are really being protected. The
wealth and power of influence that rests in
the hands of private corporations is enorm
ous, and their control of the public media
insures that even "popular" political choices
will be made within a limited sphere.
Finally, the real laugher. Mason warns that
boycotts "threaten" the right of free speech
and free belief by punishing unpopular
points of view. This claim reveals a sorry lack

of understanding: there certainly is a right to
free speech, but there is no such "right" to
have one's products bought.
If Anita gets canned because of orange
juice boycotts, one's gripe is with the cow
ardly companies that don't stand by her
brave anti-degenerate stance, not with those
persons who understandably gag over a be
verage tainted with the venom of prejudice
and bigotry.
11 certainly is "outright coercion" to refuse
to buy the products of a corporation whose
policies do not reflect the public good, but it
is a coercion that is perfectly consistent with
the rationality of capitalism: money talks.
The most significant victories of the poor and
powerless over mega-business have been
won through boycott along with political ac
tion (most notably those of the United Farm
Workers).
Mason may wish to spend his dollars on the
"best" products, but, for many persons,
questioning what is "good" is inseparable
from their knowledge of where their money
is going. In the same way t hat one is "boycot
ting" the manufacturers of cheap and shoddy
products, one can boycott the manufacturers
of cheap and shoddy points of view.

will be made within a limited sphere.
Finally, the real laugher. Mason warns that
boycotts "threaten" the right of free speech
and free belief by punishing unpopular
points of view. This claim reveals a sorry lack

of understanding: there certainly is a right to
free speech, but there is no such "right" to
have one's products bought.
If Anita gets canned because of orange
juice boycotts, one's gripe is with the cow
ardly companies that don't stand by her
brave anti-degenerate stance, not with those
persons who understandably gag over a be
verage tainted with the venom of prejudice
and bigotry.
11 certainly is "outright coercion" to refuse
to buy the products of a corporation whose
policies do not reflect the public good, but it
is a coercion that is perfectly consistent with
the rationality of capitalism: money talks.
The most significant victories of the poor and
powerless over mega-business have been
won through boycott along with political ac
tion (most notably those of the United Farm
Workers).
Mason may wish to spend his dollars on the
"best" products, but, for many persons,
questioning what is "good" is inseparable
from their knowledge of where their money
is going. In the same way t hat one is "boycot
ting" the manufacturers of cheap and shoddy
products, one can boycott the manufacturers
of cheap and shoddy points of view.
