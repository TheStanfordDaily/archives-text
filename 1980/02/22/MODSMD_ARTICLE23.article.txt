## Keep Games apolitical 
### 
1 don't agree with Carter's demand to boycott
the Olympics. I le is attempting to solve or mitigate
>a political problem with an apolitical tool. Politics
and sports do not mix.
Most of us first think of the unfortunate Ameri
can athletes whose dreams will be shattered if they
are not allowed to participate. We try to imagine
what a crushing blow it must be to someone who
has worked toward this goal practically all his life,
with every fiber of his being.
But the athletes are not the only ones who would
suffer, despite the acuteness of their pain. The
public would also be deprived of the spirit of inter
national competition, not to mention the coaches
and the officials.
And the Soviets, yes, even though we hate them
now, would probably suffer most. All those years
of organization, expectation, money and prestige
. . . gone. Well, isn't that what Carter wants to
accomplish?
Yes and no. President Jimmy Carter hopes to
thwart Soviet aggression or at least demonstrate
that the United States doesn't approve of it, and he
believes that boycotting the Games would show the
Soviets just how "tough" we are, especially if other-
Western countries follow our lead. But if the
Soviets had refused to come to Lake Placid because
of our interference, say in Pakistan, would that
have caused us to reconsider our political aims? 1
don't think so. An aggressive boycott would only
provoke an aggressive response.
Besides, the effect of the boycott is not the real
issue. Does Carter have the right to impose politi
cal aims on an international sports competition?
In a Time essay, "The Boycott That Might Re
scue the Games," (Time, Feb. 11) it is argued that
only purists can separate political issues from the
Games. Examples of political interference are
cited: the Palestinian terrorists at Munich in 1972,
the African boycott at Montreal in 1976. Bui what
kind of examples are these? Does the United States
want to follow in the footsteps of countries that
have resorted to such drastic but ineffectual mea
sures?
The essay also states that, "To say that the
Olympic Games have nothing to do with politics is
the equivalent of saying that disco dancing has
nothing to do with sex." Well I, for one, believe

that the Olympics are no more inherently political
than that disco dancing was created as a sexual
stimulant. Politics has been falsely imposed on the
Games.
True, there has always been a spirit of
nationalism: each country backs its own athletes.
In addition the host country swells with pride at the
honor of welcoming the athletes and spectators.
Just this week when the favored American figure
skating pair was forced to drop out of competition
because of injury, the American spectators were
disappointed and very sympathetic towards Tai
Babilonia and Randy Gardener; nevertheless, they
gave the foreign athletes an extremely warm recep
tion. They had come to watch the competition of
pure sport above any shallow, "patriotic"
favoritism.
As for the politics involved in choosing a host
country, I believe that this problem should be
eliminated in order to really instill the Games with
a sense of internationalism. Greece has been
suggested as a permanent site for the Games, to cut
down on the expenses of rebuilding every four
years and to hopefully eliminate boycotts such as
ours. Greece, however, is not a very stable country,
so I suggest a more neutral location like Switzer
land or Norway.
Would a permanent location for the Olympics
really enable countries to participate freely?
We need to take one more step. All countries, no
matter what their internal policies, must be allowed
to send athletes to the Games. The International
Olympic Committee cannot act as a moral grand
father. South Africa has inhumane policies, yes,
but so do other countries who only cloak theirs
better, and who manage to get into the Games.
Barring Taiwan from the Winter Olympics was a
grave error.
But will these measures actually be effective in
preventing such outrageous political strategies as
our own? Only if every country, if all political
leaders, athletes and even citizens make an effort
to be "purists" can the Games succeed. Otherwise,
they may well become a giant boxing match bet
ween the United States and the Soviet Union, with
the lOC trying to act as referee. And this time, no
one will come out unbloodied.

stimulant. Politics has been falsely imposed on the
Games.
True, there has always been a spirit of
nationalism: each country backs its own athletes.
In addition the host country swells with pride at the
honor of welcoming the athletes and spectators.
Just this week when the favored American figure
skating pair was forced to drop out of competition
because of injury, the American spectators were
disappointed and very sympathetic towards Tai
Babilonia and Randy Gardener; nevertheless, they
gave the foreign athletes an extremely warm recep
tion. They had come to watch the competition of
pure sport above any shallow, "patriotic"
favoritism.
As for the politics involved in choosing a host
country, I believe that this problem should be
eliminated in order to really instill the Games with
a sense of internationalism. Greece has been
suggested as a permanent site for the Games, to cut
down on the expenses of rebuilding every four
years and to hopefully eliminate boycotts such as
ours. Greece, however, is not a very stable country,
so I suggest a more neutral location like Switzer
land or Norway.
Would a permanent location for the Olympics
really enable countries to participate freely?
We need to take one more step. All countries, no
matter what their internal policies, must be allowed
to send athletes to the Games. The International
Olympic Committee cannot act as a moral grand
father. South Africa has inhumane policies, yes,
but so do other countries who only cloak theirs
better, and who manage to get into the Games.
Barring Taiwan from the Winter Olympics was a
grave error.
But will these measures actually be effective in
preventing such outrageous political strategies as
our own? Only if every country, if all political
leaders, athletes and even citizens make an effort
to be "purists" can the Games succeed. Otherwise,
they may well become a giant boxing match bet
ween the United States and the Soviet Union, with
the lOC trying to act as referee. And this time, no
one will come out unbloodied.

1 don't agree with Carter's demand to boycott
the Olympics. I le is attempting to solve or mitigate
>a political problem with an apolitical tool. Politics
and sports do not mix.
Most of us first think of the unfortunate Ameri
can athletes whose dreams will be shattered if they
are not allowed to participate. We try to imagine
what a crushing blow it must be to someone who
has worked toward this goal practically all his life,
with every fiber of his being.
But the athletes are not the only ones who would
suffer, despite the acuteness of their pain. The
public would also be deprived of the spirit of inter
national competition, not to mention the coaches
and the officials.
And the Soviets, yes, even though we hate them
now, would probably suffer most. All those years
of organization, expectation, money and prestige
. . . gone. Well, isn't that what Carter wants to
accomplish?
Yes and no. President Jimmy Carter hopes to
thwart Soviet aggression or at least demonstrate
that the United States doesn't approve of it, and he
believes that boycotting the Games would show the
Soviets just how "tough" we are, especially if other-
Western countries follow our lead. But if the
Soviets had refused to come to Lake Placid because
of our interference, say in Pakistan, would that
have caused us to reconsider our political aims? 1
don't think so. An aggressive boycott would only
provoke an aggressive response.
Besides, the effect of the boycott is not the real
issue. Does Carter have the right to impose politi
cal aims on an international sports competition?
In a Time essay, "The Boycott That Might Re
scue the Games," (Time, Feb. 11) it is argued that
only purists can separate political issues from the
Games. Examples of political interference are
cited: the Palestinian terrorists at Munich in 1972,
the African boycott at Montreal in 1976. Bui what
kind of examples are these? Does the United States
want to follow in the footsteps of countries that
have resorted to such drastic but ineffectual mea
sures?
The essay also states that, "To say that the
Olympic Games have nothing to do with politics is
the equivalent of saying that disco dancing has
nothing to do with sex." Well I, for one, believe

that the Olympics are no more inherently political
than that disco dancing was created as a sexual
stimulant. Politics has been falsely imposed on the
Games.
True, there has always been a spirit of
nationalism: each country backs its own athletes.
