## Boycott political Games 
### 
On behalf of the organization of which I am a
member, Stanford Against Soviet Aggression, I am
writing.a brief column expressing our views in re
gard to President Jimmy Carter's call for a boycott
of the Summer Olympic Games in Moscow. I will
state categorically that we support such a boycott,
and let me briefly state why.
First of all, the main argument against the
boycott is pervasive; politics should not be mixed
with amateur athletics, especially the Olympics,
and the United States will be introducing politics
into the Games by leading a boycott, possibly en
dangering the whole movement itself.
However, it must be realized that politics have
â– Jseen interjected into the Olympics in the past and
are being interjected now by the Soviets.
Right now, the Soviet Union is engaged in a
bitter political struggle in the world arena to pre
vent world condemnation of its brutal invasion of
the independent nation of Afghanistan.
Yet unlike the military struggle in Afghanistan,
which they won in a matter of days, the Soviets are
losing a political struggle as independent nations
around the world rally in near universal condemna
tion of the Soviet Union for its invasion. Therefore,
the Soviets need desperately a world act or event to
show their allies, their prospective allies and their

own people that the world sanctions or at least
tolerates this hrutal invasion.
The Soviets, through the massive propaganda
machine, intend to make the Olympics such a
world event. One merely has to read their recent
arguments in Pravda; they argue that surely the
world cannot truly he upset with the invasion if the
world allows the Olympics, the symbol of non
violence and goodwill between nations, to be held
in the capital city of the invading nation.
In 1936, Adolf Hitler used the Olympics held in
the capital of Germany as an incredibly effective
propaganda tool to stifle political opposition to his
horrible regime. By participating in those Olym
pics, the world sanctioned his tyranny instead of
opposing it before it was too late to prevent World
War II and the holocaust.
The world cannot allow such a travesty to occur
again. We cannot allow the Soviets to use these
games, in their capital city, as a propaganda tool to
prevent the universal condemnation of this brutal
invasion which they so justly deserve. Therefore,
we urge the United States and all nations to boycott
the summer Olympics in Moscow.
