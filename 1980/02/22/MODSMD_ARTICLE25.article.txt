Overreaction hurts
I was saddened to read Steve
Katz and Brian Rosman's letter
(Daily, Feb. 14) concerning the
activities of Jews for Jesus at
Stanford. Katz and Rosman
were particularly disturbed by
the mailing and pamphleting ef
forts of Jews for Jesus which they
characterized as an "attack" on
the beliefs of the Jewish com
munity at Stanford. They con
cluded that one's beliefs
shouldn't come under "attack"
in a "democratic and free soci
ety," and then threatened Jews
for Jesus with possible action on
the part of the Anti-Defamation
League of B'nai B'rith.
From my perspective, a
"democratic and free" society is
exactly the place for one's beliefs
to come under "attack." Mail
ings and pamphleting are hardly
totalitarian techniques which
curb the individual's freedom of
choice. Those who don't ap
preciate the Jews for Jesus litera
ture should make liberal use of
the trash cans provided on cam
pus.
I am fully aware of the sensi
tive nature of religious/cultural
dialogue; overreactions like that
of Katz and Rosman do not aid
the fruitfulness of such dialogue.

New center needed
An activities center on the
campus could help to achieve a
much needed sense of continuity
among students. Students and
University officials intimate that
lack of continuity is a major
drawback to student participa
tion in the long-term interests of
the University.
The need for more office space
to encourage and house student
organizational development has
been well chronicled. There is a
need for a multi-purpose space
that could display students' crea
tive talents in theater arts, satisfy
the desire for contemporary en
tertainment, and that could be

reserved on a consistent basis for
campus forums on issues of im
portance to students. Specialized
spaces might bring creative arts
workshops into the light of day
and out of the basements of resi
dences. The ASSU could pro
vide more services to students.
The list of options grows.
The idea for an activities
center goes beyond a mere re
quest for additional space for
students. A proposal for more
space without regard to consid
eration of how it would be integ
rated into the students' interests
and campus environment would
be shortsighted. The present
configuration of activities space
is a result of historical accident
and limited opportunities. What
students and the University must
do is look further into the future
while looking critically at the
past.
What seems to be needed is
not merely more space, but more
and better space â€” space that
assists student creativity and in
itiative, that encourages a grea
ter sense of student community,
of continuous reflection and stu
dent development. An activities
center could provide a chance for
a large and diverse mass of stu
dent interests to work together
and grow under the force of col
lective interest and mutual en
terprise.

Become a minister
I think that I have the perfect
solution for Stanford students
who both oppose the reinstate
ment of the draft and are sick and
tired of listening to David Harris'
"face down in a rice paddy"
speeches: All of you should be
come minister-priests in the
soon-to-be established First
Stanford Church of God, the
Peacenik Non-Baptist. Under
Carter's proposal, the only au
tomatic exemption, should a draft
occur, would be for a "minister of
religion."
Why waste your time saying
"Hell no, we won't go?" Instead,

you should be reciting your in
cantations and lighting candles.
After all, if everyone gets killed
over in Afghanistan or Pakistan,
then the world. Mom, apple pie
and Mobil Oil will still be safe,
since the minister-priests of the
nation at Stanford will still be
around to save all those who
have sinned. And if these
minister-priests fail in their mis
sion, after we've all been nuked,
maybe we will be lucky enough
to have Ellsberg come and give a
speech in the all-but-decimated
White Plaza.

Subsidy aids women
The Stanford Karate Club has
been unfairly assaulted. A recent
(Feb. 14) letter to the Daily
criticized the club's use of a do
nation given to promote female
membership in the club. The
plan, which was designed by the
women in the club, was labeled
"sexist" and was referred to as a
type of policy that would, "only
perpetuate the kind of societal
Situations that characterize
women as vulnerable to attack."
The club's plan is to give sub
sidies for the dues of women who
continue karate instruction past
the first quarter. I was quite sur
prised to discover that this plan
makes women more vulnerable
to attack.
There is a difference between
the sexes in the Stanford Karate
Club. Fewer women than men
take the first quarter class, and
most of these women drop out of
the club before they get to a
point where they really know
how to defend themselves.
I can easily see why it is not as
easy for women to stick with ka
rate. First of all, they may feel
out of place because society has
traditionally considered it un
natural for women to learn how
to fight. Second, karate becomes
more physical after the first
quarter, and women may find it
very difficult to practice with

men who are much bigger and
stronger than themselves.
Women should be encouraged
to stick with karate. It would
help them, and it would help the
club. The club's plan may be
sexist in the broadest sense of the
word, but it is not sexist in the
sense that it would hurt women.
The truth is just the opposite.

Funding substantial
The Feb. 1 issue of the Daily
carried an article describing a
series on Asian American arts
sponsored by Okada House and
the Asian American Theater
Project. In the article Leo Liu,
Okada RA, is quoted as saying
he was disappointed at receiving
one-third the amount requested.
The Office of Residential
Education committed $500 to
ward the honorarium and guest
expenses of Philip Gotanda, who
will be an artist in residence
while his play. Song for a Nisei
Fisherman is rehearsed and pro
duced here. This $500 is over
and above the regular program
account administered by each
house's resident fellows.
Okada House also has received
from residential education an in
dication of $500 support for a
spring series on Asian American
community issues.
While I met with the students
planning the arts series, I indi
cated it was unlikely our office
could supply the $1637.50 re
quested for Gotanda's residence
and the production of the play.
While Liu may be disappointed
that the total amount requested
could not be funded from resi
dential education, the fact is that
this is a substantial commitment
to any one series or activity. Our
office was helpful in identifying
other funding sources and ar
ranging for this worthwhile
series to receive support from
other University offices.
