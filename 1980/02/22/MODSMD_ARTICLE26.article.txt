# FORUM SUMMER OLYMPICS BOYCOTT
## John Black, M.D. Individual triumph matters more 
### 
Dominated by giant governmental
bureaucracies, dependent upon huge multi
national corporations, buffeted by economic,
political and social forces that seem beyond
purposeful control, no rational human being
can feel that he counts for much in the mod
ern world.
One is more apt to feel he or she is treading
water in a swirling flood, lucky to keep a dry
head and hoping some dam up the way
doesn't burst and wipe him out.
In this situation, one looks for some affir
mation of the worth of the individual human
being — a symbol, a hero, someone who
demonstrates that a single person can do
something unique, can really make a differ
ence in something.
But where? Politicians, corporate execu
tives — they are readily replaceable and
anyway, even they can't do much to alter the
institutions they are supposed to control. But
there is one arena where a person can do
something no one else can do, where one can
make a noticeable difference using talent,

dedication, blood, sweat and tears. That
realm is athletics.
It seems possible that the phenomenal
growth of amateur and professional sports in
our country, and the domination of such
sports by highly-paid and/or greatly admired
heroes is a result of our yearning for a chance
to experience vicariously the sense of satis
faction that comes to someone who can
singlehandedly change the course of events,
even the outcome of an athletic contest.
Nowhere is this triumph of the individual
so visible as in the Olympic Games. 11 ere we
can see individuals, after years of prepara
tion, mustering all their personal talent, con
centration, physical and emotional effort to
accomplish something only a single human
being, or a pair, can do.
And despite some flag waving, the Games
are contests among individuals: nationality,
race and religion become trivial as one
watches the contestants struggle for self
mastery and perfection. Who cares which na

tion has the most medalists'? The drama, the
excitement, the beauty is in the individual
athlete's effort and we share the joy or disap
pointment with each one.
A few weeks ago I felt it was appropriate
for the United States to express its displea
sure with the Soviet Union by boycotting the
Summer Olympics. Now I feel it would be a
monumental tragedy — not simply because it
is really an empty, futile gesture, not simple
because it imposes upon a few hundred
athletes the sacrifices that the nation as a
whole should make. It would be a tragedy
because once again, this pre-eminent affir
mation of the individual would be sacrified to
the domination of the monolithic state.
It's true that nations may try to make polit
ical capital of the Olympics, but they will fail,
whether in Berlin, or Moscow, or Lake
Placid, for the Olympics are a shining symbol
of the triumph of the individual human spirit.
