## Relocating games clear solution 
### 
When Baron Pierre de
Coubertin decided to revive the
Olympic Games in 1894, one of
his fundamental aims was to
"bring together every four years
representatives of all nations in
the interest of peaceful and
courteous . . . internationalism."
In theory, the Olympics are
supposed to transcend politics,
but in practice they rarely do.
The Olympics long ago became
politicized by authoritarian

Societies like Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union sparing no ef
fort to train their athletes — all in
the hopes of piling up gold med
als as proof of the superiority of
their political systems. In this
Olympic year of 19X0. we are
once again witnessing that it is
impossible to separate politics
from the Olympic Games.
Declaring that Soviet actions
in Afghanistan make it inap
propriate for Moscow to serve as
the site for the 1980 Summer
Olympics. President Jimmy Car
ter's administration decided that
the United States would boycott
the Olympics unless Soviet
forces were off Afghan territory
by Feb. 20. In advocating a
boycott, the president is taking
the single most effective action
short of war to punish the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
To the Soviet government, the
American embargo on wheat
shipments and advanced
technology is a short/term incon
venience. Recalling the Ameri
can ambassador and closing con
sular offices will be shrugged off.
But an American boycott of the
Summer Olympics will be a jave
lin thrown right where it hurts —
at the heart of Soviet self
esteem. All financial losses
aside, the Kremlin would lose a
long-sought opportunity to im
press the world and its own
people.
The president's attempt to use
the Olympics as a diplomatic
bargaining lever is not without
liabilities. Some Congressional
foreign-affairs experts arc wor
ried that a boycott will serve
Soviet interests by promoting a
split between the United States
and its allies. However a number
of American allies, including
Britain, Canada and the Nether
lands, have already expressed
their desire to see this summer's
Olympics moved out of Moscow.
In addition to international
complications, American corpo
rations stand to lose millions of
dollars from the boycott of an
event that has become a major
promotional and marketing tool.
Nevertheless, all the companies
who chose to commercialize the
Moscow Olympics knew of the
risks involved, and those with
superior foresight are already in
sured for the loss of expected re
venues.
The most important consequ
ence of a boycott is the effect it
will have on American athletes.
Amateur athletes, who have
spent years training for the op
portunity to compete in the
Olympics, will be robbed of their
ultimate goal.
On the matter of an Olympic

boycott. University athletes have
mixed emotions and varied opin
ions. High jumper Franklin
Jacobs says,"I would be all for
moving the games out of Russia
or even postponing them for a
year . . . Naturally 1 want to
jump, but more importantly I
want to do what's right for
America." In contrast to Jacob's
opinion. Stanford swimming star
Linda Jezek asserts, "The public,
nonathletes, thinks we shouldn't
go. hut I don't think they realize
how much time and training is
involved; if they were in the
athletes' position, they'd want to
go."
I am sure that what Jezek says
is true, but whether or not the
public is aware of the cost of an
athlete's training is not impor
tant. After all, the public did not
choose to train the athlete; the
athlete chose to train himself. I
sympathize with athletes who
may never see the fruits of their
dedicated training, but they must
realize the naivete of placing the
Olympics ahead of world events.
Before actually boycotting the
Summer Games, the White
House has considered several al
ternatives that require the coop
eration of other nations. The first
option, a Free World Olympics,
is an alternative set of games for
nations choosing to boycott the
Olympics in Moscow. Unfortu
nately. the Free World Olympics
would mean the demise of the
original intent of the Olympic
Games, which is to allow all
amateur athletes in the world a
chance to compete.
A second option is to scatter
the different events among dif
ferent countries. For example, the
gymnastics could be held in Ja
pan. the boxing in Cuba, and the
track and field in the United
States. Obviously there would be
formidable logistic problems in
this proposal, and even if the
problems could be solved the re
sulting games would amount to
world championships, something
already routinely held in most
sports.
The third option, moving
and/or postponing the Olympics,
is the clear solution. The main

obstacle blocking a change in
sites is the International Olv mpic
Committee, which opposed mov
ing the Games on the grounds
that it would be "virtually physi
cally impossible." However,
White House strategists believe
that if they can line up 20 or so
nations behind a move to relo
cate the Games, the lOC will
give in.
In response to relocation,
former Canadian Prime Minister
Joe Clark offered to "take the
lead" in shifting the Games to
Montreal, the site of the 1976
Olympics. Although Montreal
has no available facilities to
house the athletes, training and
housing could be arranged at col
leges in the region, or even at
Lake Placid, New York, where
new Winter Olympic facilities
are only a few hours away. If the
shift from Moscow to Montreal
requires the Olympics to be
postponed, then they should be
postponed; there is no rule which
states that the Olympic Games
have to be held in 19X0.
No one is more convinced of
the Olympics' political signifi
cance than the Soviets them
selves. As one dissident Soviet
writer commented: "Grain and
technology are one thing. But
the Olympics, ah, that is a matter
of prestige and honor." Furth
ermore. the 1980 edition of the
Book of the Party Activist con
cludes: "The decision ... to hold
the Olympic Games (in Moscow)
has become convincing evidence
of the .. . correctness of the
foreign policy course of our
country."
By attending the Olympics in
Moscow, the United States will
confer legitimacy on a hostile
Soviet foreign policy. For this
reason, we must rally our allies
into an effective boycott that will
result in the relocation and/or
postponement of the Summer
Olympics. Only this action can
deal the serious psychological
and political blow needed to
show the Soviets the "incorrect
ness" of their foreign policy
course.

Committee, which opposed mov
ing the Games on the grounds
that it would be "virtually physi
cally impossible." However,
White House strategists believe
that if they can line up 20 or so
nations behind a move to relo
cate the Games, the lOC will
give in.
In response to relocation,
former Canadian Prime Minister
Joe Clark offered to "take the
lead" in shifting the Games to
Montreal, the site of the 1976
Olympics. Although Montreal
has no available facilities to
house the athletes, training and
housing could be arranged at col
leges in the region, or even at
Lake Placid, New York, where
new Winter Olympic facilities
are only a few hours away. If the
shift from Moscow to Montreal
requires the Olympics to be
postponed, then they should be
postponed; there is no rule which
states that the Olympic Games
have to be held in 19X0.
No one is more convinced of
the Olympics' political signifi
cance than the Soviets them
selves. As one dissident Soviet
writer commented: "Grain and
technology are one thing. But
the Olympics, ah, that is a matter
of prestige and honor." Furth
ermore. the 1980 edition of the
Book of the Party Activist con
cludes: "The decision ... to hold
the Olympic Games (in Moscow)
has become convincing evidence
of the .. . correctness of the
foreign policy course of our
country."
By attending the Olympics in
Moscow, the United States will
confer legitimacy on a hostile
Soviet foreign policy. For this
reason, we must rally our allies
into an effective boycott that will
result in the relocation and/or
postponement of the Summer
Olympics. Only this action can
deal the serious psychological
and political blow needed to
show the Soviets the "incorrect
ness" of their foreign policy
course.

When Baron Pierre de
Coubertin decided to revive the
Olympic Games in 1894, one of
his fundamental aims was to
"bring together every four years
representatives of all nations in
the interest of peaceful and
courteous . . . internationalism."
In theory, the Olympics are
supposed to transcend politics,
but in practice they rarely do.
The Olympics long ago became
politicized by authoritarian

Societies like Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union sparing no ef
fort to train their athletes — all in
the hopes of piling up gold med
als as proof of the superiority of
their political systems. In this
Olympic year of 19X0. we are
once again witnessing that it is
impossible to separate politics
from the Olympic Games.
Declaring that Soviet actions
in Afghanistan make it inap
propriate for Moscow to serve as
the site for the 1980 Summer
Olympics. President Jimmy Car
ter's administration decided that
the United States would boycott
the Olympics unless Soviet
forces were off Afghan territory
by Feb. 20. In advocating a
boycott, the president is taking
the single most effective action
short of war to punish the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
To the Soviet government, the
American embargo on wheat
shipments and advanced
technology is a short/term incon
venience. Recalling the Ameri
can ambassador and closing con
sular offices will be shrugged off.
But an American boycott of the
Summer Olympics will be a jave
lin thrown right where it hurts —
at the heart of Soviet self
esteem. All financial losses
aside, the Kremlin would lose a
long-sought opportunity to im
press the world and its own
people.
The president's attempt to use
the Olympics as a diplomatic
bargaining lever is not without
liabilities. Some Congressional
foreign-affairs experts arc wor
ried that a boycott will serve
Soviet interests by promoting a
split between the United States
and its allies. However a number
of American allies, including
Britain, Canada and the Nether
lands, have already expressed
their desire to see this summer's
Olympics moved out of Moscow.
In addition to international
complications, American corpo
rations stand to lose millions of
dollars from the boycott of an
event that has become a major
promotional and marketing tool.
Nevertheless, all the companies
who chose to commercialize the
Moscow Olympics knew of the
risks involved, and those with
superior foresight are already in
sured for the loss of expected re
venues.
The most important consequ
ence of a boycott is the effect it
will have on American athletes.
Amateur athletes, who have
spent years training for the op
portunity to compete in the
Olympics, will be robbed of their
ultimate goal.
On the matter of an Olympic

boycott. University athletes have
mixed emotions and varied opin
ions. High jumper Franklin
Jacobs says,"I would be all for
moving the games out of Russia
or even postponing them for a
year . . . Naturally 1 want to
jump, but more importantly I
want to do what's right for
America." In contrast to Jacob's
opinion. Stanford swimming star
Linda Jezek asserts, "The public,
nonathletes, thinks we shouldn't
go. hut I don't think they realize
how much time and training is
involved; if they were in the
athletes' position, they'd want to
go."
I am sure that what Jezek says
is true, but whether or not the
public is aware of the cost of an
athlete's training is not impor
tant. After all, the public did not
choose to train the athlete; the
athlete chose to train himself. I
sympathize with athletes who
may never see the fruits of their
dedicated training, but they must
realize the naivete of placing the
Olympics ahead of world events.
Before actually boycotting the
Summer Games, the White
House has considered several al
ternatives that require the coop
eration of other nations. The first
option, a Free World Olympics,
is an alternative set of games for
nations choosing to boycott the
Olympics in Moscow. Unfortu
nately. the Free World Olympics
would mean the demise of the
original intent of the Olympic
Games, which is to allow all
amateur athletes in the world a
chance to compete.
A second option is to scatter
the different events among dif
ferent countries. For example, the
gymnastics could be held in Ja
pan. the boxing in Cuba, and the
track and field in the United
States. Obviously there would be
formidable logistic problems in
this proposal, and even if the
problems could be solved the re
sulting games would amount to
world championships, something
already routinely held in most
sports.
The third option, moving
and/or postponing the Olympics,
is the clear solution. The main

obstacle blocking a change in
sites is the International Olv mpic
Committee, which opposed mov
ing the Games on the grounds
that it would be "virtually physi
