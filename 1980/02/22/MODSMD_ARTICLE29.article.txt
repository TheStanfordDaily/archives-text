What does the word "cherry" mean? I've heard
that it's in increasingly short supply.
- George Washington
Dear Axe-Uandler,
Assuming you are not referring to the tart fruit
whose tree you felled, cherry is often used to refer
to a woman's hymen, according to The Under
ground Dictionary; e.g., "He broke her cherry."
Cherry is also employed to describe a male or
temale virgin, in this context. Surprisingly enough,
that lexicon lists up to 50 different uses of cherry,
most of them extremely mundane but of positive
connotation.
For the derivation of this sexual interpretation of
cherry. Slang and Its Analogues reported that
cherry-ripe refers to a woman. Cherry denoted a
young girl in the latter half of the nineteenth cen
tury, according to Eric Partridge's A Dictionary of
Slang and Unconventional English.
Your contention that such cherries are becoming
more scarce is harder to verify, particularly on this
campus. As far as I can discern, no figures are

currently available on the sexual aetiv ity or lack ol
it among Stanford students. Dean of Under
graduate Studies Herant Katchadourian said that
he knew of no study detailing virginity rates on
campus. His book, Fundamentals of Human Sexu
ality, does, however, cite some national studies on
the subject.
Quoting from p. 313 of that work, "Kantner and
Zelnik have reported that in 1971 nearly 2.4 mill
ion never-married women aged 15-19 years (or
about 28 percent of the population within this age
group in the country) have had some coital experi
ence. Further evidence from the survey indicates
that intercourse is now beginning at younger ages,
and its extent among teenagers is increasing."
That same study said that the likelihood of
women experiencing coitus was 14 percent at age
15, 21 at 16, 27 at 17 and 46 at 19.
A Playboy Foundation survey conducted in the
lirst part of the last decade reported that the per
centage of married persons who have had sexual
intercourse prior to getting married was 95 percent
for males and 81 percent for females between the
ages of 18 and 24. These percentages declined
steadily among older persons, especially for
females. Those rates were 92 and 65 for males and
females respectively in the 25-34 age group, 8(i a nd
4 1 for 35-44, 89 and 36 for 45-54, and 84 and 3 1
for 55 and above.
These findings would seem to indicate that your
hear-say assertion is on the mark. The rate of pre
marital virginity does seem to be diminishing.
