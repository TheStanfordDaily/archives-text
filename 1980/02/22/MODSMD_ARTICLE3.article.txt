# Bouncing checks bother bursar
## 
### Beth Harrison Staff Writer 
You may be a "criminal" without knowing about it. Have
you ever written a check on insufficient funds knowing that
a check from Mom and Dad should be along any day to hail
out your bank account?
Technically, the law calls this "intent to defraud" and you
could he punished by a 14-year prison sentence.
According to University Bursar Joseph Jedd, the volume
of outstanding checks coming to his office, which receives
and processes all University checks, has nearly quadrupled
in the past three years. The Bookstore reports similar in
creases.
In January, Jedd received more than 300 bad checks.
Many of these rubber checks are written by students for
tuition and rent. However, Jedd said that recently a Stan
ford donor wrote a had check to the University.
The University now charges $5 for each returned check,
hut may take more drastic measures with repeated offen
ders. Holding .i student's registration is usually effective,
Jedd said. The University rarely will turn the check over to a
collection agency or take the offender to court, he said.
Some students write rubber checks because they don't
want to stand in deferment lines at registration. Others
wt ite a had check intentionally, treating it as a three to four
week loan until the check is finally cashed.
Because of this practice. Jedd explained, offenders at the
least, "cannot be better off than those who have deferred."
They are charged for deferment fees plus the $5 returned
check fee.
The University is now considering harsher punishments,
Jedd said. A student who writes more than two or three
rubber checks may no longer be able to defer tuition and
may not be eligible for loans, he said.
Jedd said he sometimes receives complaints from stu
dents who come to his office claiming that the rubber checks
were not their fault because they had deposited another

check to cover it in their account the same day. Or he says
they had called the bank on the day they wrote the check to
make sure that there were sufficient funds.
"The students do not know how to handle a checking
account," Jedd said. Banks will not honor checks from
"uncollected funds," that is. they must cash the deposited
check before they can cash the student's check to the Uni
versity. Calling the bank on the day the check is written does
no good either, Jedd said, because outstanding checks are
not accounted for, and the student may overdraw.
Although in these instances, the student is "more or less
innocent," Jedd said, he still must be charged fees since such
a mistake costs the University valuable time and money.
Jedd said he wishes students would take more responsi
bility for their financial affairs. They should not close their
checking accounts until all outstanding checks have come
in. he said. In the past, Jedd said, he had to explain to
students how to handle their checking accounts.
The Bookstore also affirms that many of the causes for
bounced checks are due to negligence or procrastination.
Students are upset when their registration is held, said Rick
Miller, a Bookstore accountant, but they often have been
warned repeatedly by mail and phone. Most people are not
deliberately dishonest, just careless, he added.
Both the Bursar's Office and the Bookstore compile
monthly lists of outstanding checks. One-time offenders
merely have to make their check good and pay the $5 fee to
have their names expunged.
The Bookstore is now considering buying new cash regis
ters that will help prevent bouncing checks. Miller said.
Overall, most offenders usually make good on their
checks. Still,"the University hasa constant balance on hand
that's just paper," Jedd said.
Every year the Bookstore also loses a substantial sum
because of rubber cheeks. Miller said. These losses are
eventually paid for by the customer, in the form of higher
prices.

Both the Bursar's Office and the Bookstore compile
monthly lists of outstanding checks. One-time offenders
merely have to make their check good and pay the $5 fee to
have their names expunged.
The Bookstore is now considering buying new cash regis
ters that will help prevent bouncing checks. Miller said.
Overall, most offenders usually make good on their
checks. Still,"the University hasa constant balance on hand
that's just paper," Jedd said.
Every year the Bookstore also loses a substantial sum
because of rubber cheeks. Miller said. These losses are
eventually paid for by the customer, in the form of higher
prices.
