# Activities subsist on board funds

In the face of rising inflation, academic
organizations are continuing to turn to the
Academic Organizations Board to finance
their films, publicity, reference materials and
other heeds.
I he AOB is a student organization that
"helps secure funds for program services and
expenses that are otherwise unattainable,"
said this quarter's chairman, sophomore
Clete Kushida.
the AOB receives $1 2,000 each year sol
ely from an ASSU fjpe assessment. Each
quarter an allocations committee, which is
elected by representatives from the member
groups, distributes approximately $4000 ac
cording to funding guidelines. (Although the
allocations committee is the deciding power
in the AOB, its decisions are subject to re
view by the AOB as well as by the ASSU
Senate.)
The 33 member groups are graduate and
undergraduate organizations with a specific
academic slant — that are related to a par
ticular discipline, field of study, profession or
career (e.g., American Studies, Chicano
I're-meds, Biology Bridge. Stanford-in-
I aw).
Each quarter, these member groups sub-

Mit to the allocations committee itemized
funding proposals that describe their needs
in detail. These proposals range from $60 to
$3000. hut the usual request is between $200
and $800, Kushida said.
Kushida calls this funding system "a very
well-thought-out process" in which each
member of the allocations committee re
views three to four funding proposals and
then suggests to the committee whether or
not to allocate the amount requested or to
pare it down to a more manageable sum.
Approval is based on the thoroughness of
each proposal and on how closely it complies
with the existing guidelines. When a request
is only partially granted, the allocations
committee suggests other avenues of 112 unding
(the Office of Student Affairs, the ASSU
Speakers Bureau or the Publicity Board, for
example).
112 hese refusals are made impartially,
Kushida said, and usually only when the
amount requested exceeds the amount
suggested in the AOB guidelines or if an
amount is requested for insufficiently
specified purposes.
In addition, Kushida said, the committee
"tries to accommodate differences in the
membership and resources of certain
groups — that is, they take into account the

portion of the community served by an or
ganization as well as the other funds availa
ble to that organization.
lor instance. Barrio Assistance serves a
small portion of the Stanford community but
faces a limited availability of funds, and thus
might be treated with more leniency by the
allocations committee than, perhaps.
Stanford-in-Business might be, which, al
though it serves a larger portion of the com
munity, also has a larger supply of available
funds. (This accommodation is particularly
apparent in the final stages of allocation
when the quarterly budget appears to be in
sufficient. )
I he AOB was formed during winter quar
ter ot 1977 by a number of pre-professional
groups on campus. Although the member
ship of the board is still mostly pre
professional, any group that can "prove its
academic orientation" is admitted to the
board. Caroline Reyes, another member of
the allocations committee, said.
Kushida cautioned that due to the increas
ing membership of the AOB (three groups
having just been added this quarter), the
budget may soon be inadequate. According
to Kushida, however, 110 concrete action to
ward increasing the fee assessment has yet
been taken.
