# Reborn cagers stun Oregon, 60-59
## 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
It's not midnight yet for the
Pacific- 10's Cinderella. There's
still time left for a last waltz. The
Stanford basketball team fores
tepped its way into Oregon's hal
lowed Mac Arthur Court last
night and kept its winning streak
alive, paddling the Ducks 60-59
to the consternation of 8693
screaming and stomping Oregon
fans.
The win raises the Cardinals
one more rung up the Pac-10
ladder, supplanting Oregon who
had been in Bth place. It is the
first time anyone on the present
Stanford team has beaten the
Ducks.
Stanford is now 4-11 in league
play (5-17 overall).
The Cards walked into "the
Pit," as the Oregonians like to
call Mac Arthur Court, with the
self-confidence of a team on a
long winning streak. They have
somehow managed to put the
rest of their unfortunate season
behind them.
Stanford played the Ducks
almost point for point for the
first 10 minutes of the first half.
Oregon, though, was playing
good defense, and on offense
was getting the ball inside. As a

result, with 7:21 left in the half,
they had forced three fouls each
on Kimberly Belton and Brian
Welch. And the two left the
game in foul trouble. The score
was 21-17, Oregon on top.
Tom Schmalzried came in for
Welch and Steve Crandell for
Belton and they panicked away
the 4-point spread.
The Ducks dominated the rest
of the half, stretching the lead to
11 points. The teams went into
the locker room with Oregon
ahead 36-25.
Stanford exploded in the sec
ond half with six unanswered
points by Pete Lallas, Doug
Marty and Belton who was back
in the line-up. After a Duck
time-out, the Cards kept taking
the ball to the hoop and with
13:25 remaining tied the score at
43-43 on a Belton 5-foot fast
break bank shot.
Part of this comeback had to
do with the fact that Oregon
stopped producing. They missed
six free throws in a row after the
time-out. But at the same time,
Stanford kept on capitalizing on
Duck turnovers and missed shots
with "fast-break garbage" as
Belton termed it after the game.
With 9:50 remaining, they had
built up their own lead of 10

points, 53-43. Oregon called a
time out.
The Ducks decided they had
had enough of this kind of stuff
from a team that wasn't sup
posed to have it in them. Even
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
said that this was unusual for his
team.
"We don't usually come back
from an 11-point deficit," he
said, "and then go up by 10. It
was a great test of character."
The real test came when Oregon
emerged from the time-out
shooting from the hip and mak
ing it. In a classic come-back, the
Ducks' John Murray sank a 25-
foot swish and Mike Clark
banked in 2 shots from 15 and 10
feet. All six points were un
answered by Stanford and the
shots were exciting enough to
whip "the Pit" into a dervish, as
the score read Oregon 49, Stan
ford 53.
But the Cards put in their
earplugs and composed them
selves with a time out.
When the teams hit the floor,
Stanford's Jeff Ryan laid in an
exquisite Tom Schmalzried pass
but was answered by another
long Murray shot. Welch came
back with a 10-footer, but Gary
Gatewood countered with two

more Oregon long bombs. The
score was 57-55, Stanford, with
3:55 to go.
Cardinal Terry Smith then
made the game even more excit
ing by fouling Jerome Williams
and giving him a chance to tie it
with aone-and-one situation. He
didn't and Stanford got the ball.
The Ducks fouled Bel ton as he
went up for a shot and he canned
one of two. The score read Stan
ford 58, Oregon 55. Oregon's
Ray Whiting was then fouled br
inging the ball up the court, and
he hit two free throws, bringing
the game to within one point
with 1:21 to go. Brian Welch,
however, returned the favor with
18 seconds left after he was
fouled in desperation by Felton
Sealey. The score: Stanford 60,
Oregon 57.
Williams got two more for
Oregon as they brought the ball
back down court. But there was
only 6 seconds left and the game
was over. Stanford pulled it off
60-59.
Cinderella could be approach
ing the witching hour, though.
Tomorrow night the Cards travel
to Corvallis to face a Beaver
squad which is number four in
the nation and still ornery about
their measly 18-16 win last
month at the Farm.
Kim Belton explained that all
the Cards can do is "savor our
victory tonight and try and go up
there and do it again."
