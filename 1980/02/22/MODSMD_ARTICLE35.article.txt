# Gymnasts to face Aggies
## 
### Dean Eyre Staff Writer 
Your final opportunity to view
both Stanford gymnastics squads
together arrives tonight when a
Maples Pavilion doubleheader
with UC-Davis is slated for 7:30
p.m.
The men's team, 5-9 overall, is
favored over the Aggies despite
missing sophomore all-around
gymnast Mike Lee. The second
competitor in the first event of
last Friday's meet with UC-
Berkeley and Arizona State, Lee
injured his wrist and sternum
and was forced to the sidelines.
Although working out this
week. Lee is being held out of
tonight's lineup to ready him for
more important meets, including
the Pac-10 championships.
"Davis is ranked third among
Division II and 111 teams, right
behind Chico State." Hamada
said. "With Mike's injury, it will
probably be pretty close."
Stanford defeated Chico State
by a 253.10 to 247.60 margin on
Feb. 1. and Davis has a season
high total of 247.00 points, ac
cording to Hamada.
"We should be scoring about
250 to 254 points depending on
the judges, if everything goes
normally," Hamada predicted.

"We should be able to beat
them."
Without Lee, the Cards' depth
will be tested and more pressure
will be on all-arounders Tad
Bostick, David Hyde, Brian Nel
son and Jeff Chung.
"Tad is close to a 9.00 aver
age," Hamada said, "and he's
been looking really good the past
two weeks. The key to the com
petition will be the pommel
horse and parallel bars, espe
cially after Mike's injury."
Hamada is entering six com
petitors in each event, with the
top five scores going towards the
team total. The performance of
the entrants in the fifth and sixth
spots could very well determine
the meet's outcome.
Rounding out the line-up for
the men are Bob Daniel in floor
exercises, vaulting, parallel bars;
Bob Maganini in floor and high
bar; Rich Rosen in rings, bars
and high bar; Bela Matyas on
horse; Dan Margules in vaulting
and Craig Goldman on rings.
Jackie Walker's gymnasts, 6-0
overall, face an Aggie squad that
is ranked third in Division II
competition.
"Davis has a season high of
129 points," Walker said. "If
we're not sharp they could beat

us â€” we've scored 127 this year.
We can't take them too lightly."
In the latest medical summary
out on the women, Kim Crowley
is out of the Davis meet with the
flu and Jeanette Lacoste will he
limited to uneven parallel bars
and floor competition because of
a bruised leg. Trina Wiggins will
go all-around for the first time
since the Jan. 12 USC meet.
Going all-around for the
Cards are Karen Hall, Anne
Smith. Wiggins, Jennifer
Roberts and Julie Bledsoe. In
addition, Cindy Stevenson will
be vaulting and Mary Lee Mac
kichan is listed for the beam
event.
"Originally, our team goal for
the meet was to hit 13K points (a
school record)," Walker said.
"It'll be harder with the aches
and pains and missing Kim who
scores well in vaulting."
Besides aiming for a new team
mark. Walker is hoping the ba
lance beam scores can be
brought up by eliminating some
of the falls.
"Last week (against Cal) there
were five falls in the top four
scores," she said. "We're aiming
for a one point improvement on
beam."
