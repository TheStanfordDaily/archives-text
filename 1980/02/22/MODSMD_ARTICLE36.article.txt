# Stamina carries Card spikers over Cal
## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
Fred Sturm's men's volleyball
team may have found a solution
to the energy crisis as they played
lull steam for five games to de
feat league rival UC-Berkeley
3-2 in Wednesday night's match
at Maples Pavilion. The Cardi
nals are now 1-0 in league play.
Stanford began the night
slowly, dropping the first game
to the eight-member Bear squad
13-15. The team's timing and
cohesiveness solidified during
the next two games as it first
squeaked by with a 16-14 win
followed by a powerful 15-4
romp. The Bears regrouped and
settled the score with an 8-15
victory, forcing a fifth game to be
played.
The deciding contest opened
with both teams combining pre
cise offense with impermeable
defense at the net. With the score
tied at 3-3, setter Kip Engen
made one of several dives to the
floor to prevent a Cal spike from
scoring. The ball ricocheted into
the air and was pounded by mid
dle blocker Jack Foxworth for a
Stanford point. The Cards would
stay ahead the rest of the game.

Hitter John McColl contri
buted powerful spikes and diving
saves while Engen continued to
set up the offense to give the
Cardinals a 8-4 lead at the mid
point of the game.
When play resumed a fast
paced rally indicated that the tir
ing Bears had caught a second
wind. Senior Tom Grimes re
turned a pair of rapid-fire spikes
while McColl showed great ef
fort in chasing a wayward return
out of bounds during the play.
Engen again saved the point with
a dive, but the ball bounced off
Stanford's side of the net to end
the rally.
Defensively the front align
ment of Foxworth, captain Rod
Fletcher, and middle blocker
Kim Lum formed a wall that con
tinuously rejected Cal spike at
tempts. Lum blocked three suc
cessive spikes during one rally
while displaying outstanding ef
fort and reflexes in preventing an
additional two attempts. When
he wasn't working alone, Lum
teamed with Foxworth to stop
play at the net. Fletcher ensured
that the left side of the net was
closed off as well as the center.
Foxworth added the finishing

touches to the match by tallying
the team's final points. Working
with Grimes at the net, the Dal
las native found an open zone
during one of his numerous re
jections to give Stanford ;i 14-7
lead. On the last play of the night
the duo of Fox worth and
Fletcher blocked a Cal spike
back over the net to take the
game 15-8.
As for what made the differ
ence between the two evenly
matched squads, Cardinal assis
tant coach John Bekins provided
three reasons. "A, we were in
much better shape. It was obvi
ous at the end that they just we
ren't as conditioned. B, our
blocks seemed to gel in the last
two to three games. C, our depth.
Everyone that we sent in did a
good job for us — Grimes did a
good job; (sophomore blocker
Mark) Reagan did a good job for
us."
California coach Jon Stanley
concurred with the analysis. "I
kind of think it could have been
just our conditioning," Stanley
noted. "We lacked a kind of
cohesiveness; we needed more
intensity. Stanford did a good
job, especially in the last game.

They were able to key on that. It
was a good match for us, any
way."
In the first game of the night
the Cards admittedly played
lethargically. "We started out a
little flat; we never-got on top of
them. It took us a little while to
get in the flow of things," Bekins
pointed out.
The starting lineup of senior
Frank Anderson, Engen,
Fletcher, Foxworth, Lum and
McColl worked from a 5-1 of
fense in which Engen was the
lone setter. Stanford was for the
most part successful in setting up
the offensive plays but suffered
from defensive collapses. With
the score 13-14 in Cal's favor,
Engen hit the tloor to save the
point, but the Bears hit an open
spot on the right side for the
score.
The second game of the night
was marked by great intensity on
the part of Stanford, especially
by Lum. During one exchange
the 6-foot-3 senior made a div
ing save on his back followed by
a frontwards dive. Alter keeping
the ball in the air during a series
of furious spikes, Stanford finally
missed one that allowed Cal to

tic it up 14-14. Lum scored for
the Cards and Cal was called tor
carrying the hall to give Stanford
the victory 16-14.
Stanford's total domination ol
the third game gave the impres
sion that the match was in hand,
but the momentum soon swung
the other way. Despite quick
hard returns hy Reagan, the
Bears hustled more to even the
slate with an K-15 score. This
seemed to spur the Cards on
going into the tie-breaker.
Alter losses to volleyball pow
erhouses USC and Pepperdine
the victory was especially gratify
ing. "We are stoked about beat
ing Berkeley," commented
Fletcher. "We were a little up
tight at the beginning; we needed
to relax a little. We were trying
too hard."
Lum also acknowledged the
significance of the victory. "We
are getting confidence now that
we can play with anyone in the
league. This win was very impor
tant, especially after our losses
down South. We know we have a
good team; we just have to prove
it to ourselves. That's important
when you're playing in the best
league in the nation," he said.
