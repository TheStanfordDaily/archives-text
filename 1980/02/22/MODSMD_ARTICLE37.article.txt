# Freshman disappointed about Games cancelation
## Olympic hopeful Major shines for Stanford 
### Fran Miller Staff Writer 
"The Olympic boycott is up
setting for me," said Barb Major,
freshman free-stylist on the wo
men's swim team, whose dream
of making the Olympic team has
been virtually shattered in light
of President Jimmy Carter's de
cision.
Major said she would back the
president, however, and feels
that the decision not to partici
pate "is not as hard on me as it is
on others who, almost certainly,
would have been guaranteed a
spot on the team." She explained
that the Olympic team, com
posed of the top three women in
each event, would have been de
termined in June. She added that
if a United States team is not sent
to Moscow, the summer nation
als. which are held bi-annually,
will be held in July instead of in
August so that times can be
compa red.
When Major arrived at Stan
ford from Ohio, she was unsure
of herself and "just wanted to
keep up with the rest of the
team." Since then, she has dis

tinguished herself by holding the
pool record for the 100 free style
and has broken this year's team
record for the 50.
Her current goal is to place
well in the collegiate nationals
in March. Major said that she
thinks Stanford has a good
chance of winning the nationals
overall.
She started swimming at a
local country club when she was
nine, saying that she "was always
a competitive kid," and that if
she hadn't started swimming, she
would have taken up another
sport, such as track.
She is the only one in her fam
ily who has swum seriously, and
she has witnessed the growth in
popularity of swimming since she
began. Major said, however, that
"although swim team coverage
and funding is better as a whole,
women in the sport still aren't
taken as seriously as they should
be."
Major contends that swim
ming is essentially a year-round
sport, although most meets are
held during winter quarter. Al
though she wouldn't stav in

something if she didn't enjoy it,
she admitted that "it's hard when
you have to give up so much of
dorm life."

Major said that having a sports
commitment forces her to
schedule her time efficiently.
Because she has early morning
and afternoon practice.

homework is left for the evening
â€” a time when many dorm ac
tivities occur.
Workouts are the most tedious
for Majors because she often
would rather be doing something
else. "If I'm frustrated, however,
a good workout can usually
make me feel better," she added.
Her mind rarely wanders dur
ing meets, however, and she is
able to muster the concentrated
energy needed for winning
speeds.
Her emotional and physical
states fuse as she makes an "all
out effort to win.'' Major said she
thinks a great deal about her per
formance before and after each
meet. "However, once I dive in."
she said,"l don't think much. My
thoughts are directly propor
tional to the importance of the
meet. In other words, the more
important the meet, the more I
can generally forget anything
that's bothering me."
Major feels she has improved
since coming to Stanford and re
lies on her team, coach, boy
friend and family for support. She
added that team members are

generally very supportive of each
other. "Although we all want to
do well," she said, "we like to see
each other do well, and I
wouldn't have it any other way."
She noted a big difference
from high school, where the
team depended mainly on her.
and Stanford, where "everyone
is really good." Major said that a
lot of friendships have developed
on the team, and that the non
athleticactivities, such as parties,
add to the closeness of the team.
She added that "it gives you a
good feeling inside when people
from the dorm care enough to
come down to watch meets."
A prospective human biology
or psychology major. Major said
that she enjoyed coaching during
the summer but would prefer
doing "something with kids" for
her career.
Unsure of how long she will
continue to swim competitively,
Major said that "as a junior or
senior, I think I'd like to be less
intense." For the time being,
however, she feels the sacrifices
she has to make for varsity athle
tics are worth it.
