# Rain is Cardinals' toughest foe
## 
### Cathy Dickerson Staff Writer 
Pre-season play for the Stan
ford baseball team may come to
a premature end if the already
one-week long series of rain
storms continues through the
weekend. With only four pre
season games remaining on the
1980 schedule and the continu
ing rain, the next game that the
Cardinals get to play might be
their league opener against the
University of Arizona one week
from today.
Stanford is scheduled to meet
San Jose State this weekend for
the three-game series, the first
game to be played today at 2:30
p.m. in Sunken Diamond and
Saturday's doubleheader to be
played at San Jose State starting
at noon. However, it seems
doubtful that any of the games
will be played.
Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess reported Thursday,
"If another storm moves through
tonight, we won't play (Friday's
game). If there's any way to work
some of the games in between
now and Monday, we will," he
said. "Chances are that if we play
at all, we will play at Stanford,"
he added with a comment about
the soggy condition of San Jose
State's field.
Marquess has been holding

off-field practices every day dur
ing the wet weather so that the
players will be in shape for the
start of league play. And none of
the teams iji the Southern Divi
sion of the Pac-10 will be ahead
of any otheras far as playing time
is concerned . . . it's been raining
throughout California and
Arizona.
"The rain has hurt us in that
our younger players could have
used those games," Marquess
said about his young and rela
tively inexperienced team. "If
we were a veteran team it might
be different," he said.
And that's where an Arizona
or California team may have an
edge on Stanford.
At least the rain has allowed
several ot the Stanford players to
recover from injuries suffered
earlier this season. It looks like
the Cards are going to be healthy
when league starts this year.
Realizing that the next game
the Cardinals do play may be a
league contest. Marquess has de
cided on his starting lineup.
Bill Worden. the team leader
in home runs with three, will be
behind the plate for the Cards.
Freshman Eric Hardgrave or vet
eran Loring Davies, depending
on whoever is playing well at the
time, will man tirst base. Vete
rans Paul Zuvella. currentlv bat

ting .417, and Dave Meier will
till the second base and shortstop
positions respectively. And
first-round draft pick Steve
Buechele, the Cards' RBI leader
thus far, will handle the hot
corner.
In the outfield, it's a tossup be
tween Phil Wilson and Mike
Dotterer in left if a right hander
is on the mound for the oppo
nent. It a left hander is slated to
start against the Cards, freshman
Mike Aldrete, who paces the
team with a .556 batting average,
will see his first league action.
Mike Toothman. fully recovered
from injuries, will play in center
field. And John Elway will start
in right.
As for the pitchers. Marquess
has decided on Lee Cline (3-0,
2.50 era), senior staffer Larr
K.uhn (1-0, 4.02 era) and Brian
Mignano (1-0. 2.57 era) as his
three starters for league play.
It Stanford gets a chance to
play any more pre-season games
— either against San Jose State
this weekend or Santa Clara next
I uesday — the three league star
ters will split the pitching duties
to help them prepare for league
competiton.
San Jose State is 4-4-1 overall
this year. 2-4 in their league, and
will challenge Stanford's red-hot

offense with good pitching. San
Jose Suite sophomore Mark
Langston and seniors Randy
Raphael and John Tillema will
share the pitching assignment in
the games ttys weekend.
San Jose State coach Gene
Menges admitted, "We haven't
been hitting the ball as well as we
did in the fall and I'm a little
disappointed in that. But our
pitching has been good." he'said.
"It has had to be with the
number of runs we've scored."
Information as to when and
where the games, it any, are to be
played this weekend, will be av
ailable through the Stanford
operator, according to coach
Marquess.
