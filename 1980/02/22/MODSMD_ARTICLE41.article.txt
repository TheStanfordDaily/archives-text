Lelters-of-intent
Stanford announced its na
tional football letters-of-intent
signings Wednesday. Most of the
Cardinals' recruiting efforts
were made out of state.
The positions of offensive and
defensive line and defensive
back were concentrated on by
Stanford's coaching staff.
The crop recruited was very
good, especially considering that
head coach Paul Wiggin was
hired just two weeks ago. The
biggest name on the recruiting
list was All-America tight end
Jim Clyner, a 6-foot-4 230
pounder from New Jersey.
Defensive back Vaughn Wil
liams, from Denver, was another

All-America grabbed by Stan
ford. Others include tight end
linebacker John Bergen from
South Bend, Indiana, all-state
linemen Kev in 1 amar from Ken
tucky and Pat Mitchell from In
diana.
From California, Stanford
landed defensive back Charles
Hutchings of Pinole Valley and
linemen Jeff Bland and Jim
Miles from Loyola High in Los
Angeles.
An in-depth story on Stanford
football's recruiting year will run
in Monday's Daily.

The ranks of the Bears, last
gear's NCAA champions, have

Olympic training defections.
Yet. they still retain 200 yard

Nort Thornton's team is pre
dicted to finish third at the na
tional meet.
