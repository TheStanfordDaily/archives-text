# Women's Softball club formed
## 
### 
You could tell that Kathy
Lahanas was a seasoned softball
player before she even fielded
lier first short-hop. She was
wearing cleats and shorts in the
dead of winter.
The woman next to her was
more sensibly attired in baggy
sweatpants and a baseball cap,
but she flinched at every ball hit
her way and put the wrong foot
forward when she threw.
The first meeting of the Stan
ford women's softball club drew

23 women with skills as mixed as
their costumes. Judging from the
badminton, rugby and mini
marathon shirts that many of
them wore, the softball players
were refugees from other sports.
Lahanas. a senior majoring in
environmental engineering,
plays varsity field hockey in the
fall, but she's been trying to start
a softball team at Stanford ever
since her sophomore year.
They formed a team and
found a volunteer coach, but
they couldn't find a field.
This year the team has found a
home â€” El Camino Park, lo
cated opposite the Stanford
Shopping Center, just this side of
the railroad tracks. Team mem
bers practice every day from 3 to

5 p.m., when a well-timed foul
tip could catch the southbound
commuter trains from San Fran
cisco.
But no one is complaining
about the quarter-hourly rumbl
ings or anything else. They now
have club sport status and are on
their way to becoming a full
fledged intercollegiate team.
The club is coached by Rayona
Sharpnack, a star pitcher for the
San Jose Rainbow professional
softball team and Al Duenas,
president of Delta Tan Delta and
former Stanford baseball player.
Games are scheduled with top
college teams in the Bay area.
UC-Berkeley, with several
players on full athletic scholar
ships and coached by Rainbow

pitcher Bonnie Johnson, will be
the team to beat. That match-up
is scheduled for March 15 at
Berkeley.
The first home game of the
season is tentatively set for
Monday at 2 p.m. against De
An/a College. There will be no
admission charged, but a "hit-a
thon" slated for tomorrow will
help finance uniforms, equip
ment and road trips. In their fun
dra ising effort, team members
will face the club's pitchers and
tSO-mile-per-hour pitching
machine.
Persons interested in sponsor
ing players in the effort may con
tact I.ahanas at 329-1391 or
drop by the field between ft a.m.
and midnight.
