Prince of Wales
106 E. 25th Ave.
San Mateo
(415) 574-9723
Burgers, bangers, brews and
boards. An unlikely combination
to be found in northern Califor
nia,even less likely oft Delaware
Street near highway 92 in San
Mateo. The Prince of Wales
would seem more appropriate
near a working town in York
shire. Instead, it lies just beyond
the railroad tracks and within a
stone's throw of the Bay
Meadows race track. Standing by
itself on 25th Street, the Prince
ol Wales creates its own English
atmosphere.
Entering the Prince of Wales
puts you into a modern-day En
glish pub. Scattered tables with
red tablecoths and wooden
chairs cover the floor. Yet the
tables are the least noticeable
feature ol the Prince of Wales.
Rafters are lined with chalked-in
names of past patrons, dart
champs, cribbage kings and cus
tomers marked for posterity.
Dim lights and juke box music
combine with the faint odor of
\ inegar and the plunk ol darts to
create the ideal pub setting.
The Prince ol Wales menu
matches its atmosphere. It is
well-known for its unique ver
sion ol the hamburger, the
Windsor Burger. A complete
history ol this tasty marinated
patty and condiments is pro\ ided
on the back of the menu.
Staying light in line with the
pub image, the Prince of Wales is
also proud of its surprisingly
good fish and chips. Although
these are the main fares, the
menu is rounded out with an as
sortment of pub regulars. Ban
ners (mild English sausage).

pork pies, clams, scallops and
shrimp, are all accompanied by a
large portion of golden chips
(fries).
The menu is fine for a simple
lunch or light dinner, but its role
is secondary. The Prince ol
Wales revolves around the ac
tivities of the bar. Over thirty
beers and ales are kept in stock,
along with wine, hard cider and
soft drinks. The beer ranges from
a common can of Budweiser to
the incredibly smooth and de
licious Samuel Smith ale that is
imported from a family brewery
in York.

112 ood is a good drawing item
lor ;in e\ ening til beer, darts, and
Iriendly gathering. The lood and
darts portion runs at around
$2.50. I'he other depends on the
customer.
I he Prince ol Wales' history
and reputation are as interesting

as its surroundings. It originally
became a heer establishment in
I 955 and was frequented by such
well-knowns as Betty (liable
and Marry James because of its
close proximity to the racetrack.
Subsequent years saw visits by
jockey Willie Shoemaker, singer
Bing Crosby, ex-movie star and
politician Ronald Reagan, and
tennis legend Billie Jean King.
The event that marked the
present mood ol the pub, though,
was the introduction ol a dart
board in 1963. The restaurant
acquired its present name when
Ken Gilley renovated and

named it Prince ol Wales. To
day's owner. Jack Curry, lias
turned the Prince of Wales into a
true pub by bringing with linn Ins
reputation as a beer connoisseur
and dart champion.
Hie combination ol food. ale.
and darts (banners, baners.

brews, and boards) is a pub's
mainstay. The dart acti\ity at Pr
ince of Wales is abundant and
lively. There are open dart tour
naments on Mondays and I ri
chly s, and leagues on Wednes
days. There are always a few
sharp players at the boards, and
Jack Curry's personal dart fame
is the catalyst to many events.
Aside from organizing
numerous activities, the Prince
of Wales annually sponsors such
events as the Peninsula Pipe Pul
ling Competition, Pub Crawl.
Christmas Day Dinner and vari
ous rugby, cribbage and
dominoes tournaments. Curry
has undoubtedly developed the
Prince ol W;iles into a commun
ity events maker.
With the Prince ol Wales'
drawing power comes a wide var
iety of customers. Many ol the
regulars go todrink fine beer and
shoot darts in an ideal pub set
ting. Others come to sit and
enjoy a few drinks ov era game of
cribbage or dominoes.
Specially designated nights
such as Thirsty Thursday Tee
shirt Night. Tipsy Tuesday Crab
Night and a Ragtime Piano for
I ailics Night on Saturday. lure in
those who know and appreciate
the events. Curry's strong influ
ence in the Prince of Wales
makes it an appropriate setting
for rugby teams to hold after
game singing and drinking par
ties. ;md for a couple ol friends to
have a good time.
I he Prince ol Wales is a warm,
personal place with unique
character.lt epitomizes "eat.
drink and he merry" with a
few darts thrown in.
