Portola Valley Kitchen, as yet
undiscovered, should not stay
that way lor long. It is a charming
little restaurant with delicious
food, good service and reasona
ble prices.
Located in a small shopping
mall in Portola Valley, the re
staurant is not particularly at
tractive from the outside. But
once inside, the wooden interior
with its plants, photographs and
the privacy of booths is certainly
appealing. The menu is equally
appealing, consisting of an im
pressive array of seafood dishes,
which are both delicious and
beautifully presented.
Warm 112 rench bread and
whipped butter were brought to
our table by our attentive waiter,
and we started our meal with
cocktails: Crab Supreme ($3.25)
and Jumbo Prawns Supreme
($3.50). The portions of fresh
crab and prawns were perfect for
starters, and both cocktails were
served in chilled glasses with a
decorative lemon wedge.
The next course was soup —
my friend had Boston Clam
Chowder and I chose Shrimp
Bisque. Both were good, but un
impressive. The main dishes.

served with almond rice and veg
etables. were excellent. My
friend ordered the special of the
evening: Fresh Lobster Tail
($K.25). Eaten with melted but
ter and lemon, this dish was a
real treat.
My dish, fresh Prawns and
Scallops sauteed with wine,
herbs, garlic, butter sauce and
mushrooms ($7.50), was won-

derfully tasty. The vegetables
were remarkable: fresh green
beans and zucchini with pearl on
ions and a little tomato, prepared
with butter.
The house wine ($2/ halt litre)
Monte Carlo Chablis, was per

teclly decent. Our waiter Buford
was charming and accommodat
ing. and service was prompt.
The Portola Valley Kitchen
otters a good selection of sea
food. baked, sauteed and deep
tried, ranging in price from $b
(Rex Sole) to $5.50 (Salmon).
There are also four slightly more
expensive heel dishes.
The wine list ranged from
$5.50 to $12.50 per bottle*
though the house wine at $3.50/
litre was certainly adequate.
They also serve a selection of
beers, which you can drink at
their small bar as well as with a
meal.
Although its ambience is still
in its developing stages, the Por
tola Valley Kitchen may be a re
freshing alternative to the old
local routine.
L.unch is also served (I I a.m.
to 3 p.m. Tuesdays through
Saturdays), as is Champagne
Brunch on Sundays (10 a.m. to 3
p.m.). The lunch menu, which tit
ters mosth seafood dishes, looks
delicious, and ranges in price
from $2.75 to $4.95. The brunch
costs $5.95 lor a main dish with a
buffet selection.
Be sure to leave a little time
after lunch or brunch for a walk
through the orchards in the lulls
just across the street.
