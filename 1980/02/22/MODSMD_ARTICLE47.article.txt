# Delicious fish served in bar & grill

Henry's
482 L'niversity A\e.
Palo Alto
326-5680
The atmosphere of the small
restaurant on University Avenue
is like that of a New York corner
bar and grill. Dick Henry, the
original owner, was a Now York
stockbroker, and Ivs infl : -n
on tlu viccor and sty ic oi i.ie re
staurant is apparent. The decor
of the bar and dining room is
very masculine, paneled in dark
wood with brass fixtures. Lamps
and fans hang from the ceiling,
and nostalgic, turn-of-the
century pictures adorn the walls.
A year after Henry's opened,
Michael Skuce became the new
owner and manager. Previously
manager and bartender of The
Winery in Palo Alto. Skuce has
owned the restaurant for five
years. Since then, both Skuce
and John Peterson, the head
chef, have worked to expand the
menu from strictly steak and
hamburgers to include some fish.

Peterson uses all fresh fish in
his French recipes. Red snapper,
rainbow trout, scallops, filet of
sole and shrimp dominate the
menu, but veal, chicken and
steak are also offered. Dinner in
cludes a choice of homemade
soup or garden salad. Fresh

bread with butter is served
alongside.
We tried the rainbow trout
and the nightly special, pepper
steak. The soup du jour, potato
leek, was thick and creamy; the
salad was fresh and crisp. The
trout, stuffed with sauteed mush

rooms, shallots and scallions
was tender and juicy. It was a
large serving on a plate with
potatoes and carrots.
The steak was prepared in a
green peppercorn sauce with
brandy, brown sauce, shallots
and cream. It was rich but not too
heavy. The dinners were delici
ous, very well-prepared and fil
ling.
Henry's is also open for lunch
from 1 1:3() a.m. to 3 p.m., offer
ing salads, burgers, deli-style
sandwiches, omelettes and char
broiled specials. The prices are
reasonable, ranging from $3.50
to $5 with the exception of the
open-face steak sandwich priced
at $7. Dinner prices are also
moderate with nothing costing
over $y.
Henry's is a small, informal re
staurant located at 452 l'niver
sity Avenue. A short bike ride
away for a tasty lunch, or a quick
drive to dinner, the service is
quick and the food is pleasant.
