It doesn't take much to guess that a restaurant
called The Fisherman is going to specialize in
fish, hut a customer with a keen sense of smell
would notice immediate!) that it's different
from most seafood restaurants. The slight
aroma of garlic and spices reveals the Italian
style of cooking, which is the establishment's
specialty.
The Fisherman was founded eight years ago
by Robert and Richard Patane, who learned the
Sicilian style of Italian cooking from their
father. The fact that the restaurant was packed
on a Tuesday night suggests that the unique
flavor has been well accepted.
Located right on the edge of the Bay, The
Fisherman offers a beautiful view from the din
ing room. The decor is typical of what you will
find in most seafood restaurants: assorted naut
ical fixtures and the mandatory fish tank.
I he food is priced accordingly, with entrees
ranging from $7 to $16. The average price is
about $y. Neither the menu nor the waiter men
tioned that soup ($1.35) or salad ($2.25) are
extra cost items. However the Manhattan Clam
Chowder was pleasantly spicy and well worth
the price.
The number of entrees offered is incredible,
allowing you to choose from fish that is baked,
broiled, deep fried, cooked in a casserole, or
cooked in a soup, rhe specialty of the house is
"Sicilian Style" Cioppino, a zesty fish soup, but
we finally settled on Halibut Steak En Car
dinale ($8.25) andSeafood En Brochette
($N.95).
Both of these dishes were served with rice and
vegetables that were prepared perfectly. The

portion of halibut was very large and had been
broiled in a cheese, mushroom and wine sauce
that was very flavorful yet didn't overpower •
Ihe Seafood En Brochette consisted of
shrimp, scallops, and onions and had been
broiled with a light wine sauce brushed over it.
The portion wasn't quite as large as that of the
halibut, but the entrees included rigatoni (noo
dles cooked in butter and garlic).
The dessert menu also offered a wide selec-

tion, including ice cream, various cakes, fresh
Iruit and ditterent types ot cottee. The dessert
that seemed most interesting was the Zabag
lione ($3.50 for two people) which is described
as a "frothy Italian creation light and fleecy as a
cloud." It was similar to a very light vanilla
pudding, but it was warm and contained a bit of
wine. It was unlike anything we'd ever tasted
and was sinfully delicious.
I he Fisherman serves lunch and dinner seven
days a week, and reservations are taken. Dress
should be semi-tormal. Ihe prices are fairly
high, but considering the quality of the food and
the service I would say it's very worthwhile. Go
ahead and impress somebody!
