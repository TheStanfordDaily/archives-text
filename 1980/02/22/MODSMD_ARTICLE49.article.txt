The Rocky Horror Picture Show
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9 p.m.-*#
The camp classic of the '70s. To
try to describe this entertaining
mess dealing with transvestism and
various other forms of socially un
acceptable behavior would be as
absurd as trying to explain its cult
appeal. A great way to blow off
Sunday night. Dress appropriately.
—Ron Lillejord
American Gigolo +
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have
much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience feel more like
peeping toms than vital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing, Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush of images,
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Hutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.
—R.L.
Kramer vs. Kramer * * * Vj
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton s
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Young Frankenstein **¥■¥■
Saturday, kresge 7 & 9:15 p.m.
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and viee versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wilder
wrote much of the screenplay, and
his performance as Doctor Fran
kenstein begins to remind you of
Buster Keaton. Brooks comes
close to what can be termed "good
direction," and his use of black
and-white photography is particu
larly inspired. Marty Feldman pro
vides the perfect comic foil as Igor,
the hunchbacked servant.
— R.L.
Jaws II
Palo Alto Square
More dying, and less life. More
acting by worse actors. An even
worse plot, and a stiffer shark. Bet
ter than Orca ilie Killer Whale, but
not much. Gratuitous and boring.
—John Nielsen

Harold and Maude * * *
Old Mill, weekend irrdnight spe
cial
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals arc played by Bud Cort
and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens round out the soundtrack.
—Jim Mattson

The l.adykillers
Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.
Alec Guinness and his gang can't
figure out how to knock off a seem
ingly harmless old lady; instead, he
and his comrades manage to wipe
each other out. Guinness' delicious
performance as a bumbling master
criminal is perfect. A wonderfully
dark fantasy, this movie also stars
Peter Sellers and Herbert Lom
(who later teamed up in the Pink
Panther series), along with Cecil
Parker and Danny Green. Alexan
der Mackendrick directed.
—R.L.
Sleeper •¥ * * *
Thursday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
It is in vogue these days to rank
Woody Allen movies according to
their fundamental melancholy. The
"better" pictures are held to be
those in which Allen's dark side is
closest to the surface, while those

proportionately lacking.
Such a system certainly has its
merits, in that Allen has clearly de
veloped in such a way, but attempts
to judge his movies by such limited
criteria are,an injustice. Sleeper is a
perfect example. This picture has
little, if any, dark side, and as such
is very clearly "early Woody," but I
have considerable trouble under
standing what the hell that means.
Sleeper is a funny movie, pure and
simple, and it doesn't leave me un
satisfied — it leaves me in the aisle
convinced that it is possible to die
of excess laughter. Allen's a seri
ous. thoughtful, intelligent man,

and no doubt deserves hosannus
for those qualities, hut he's also the
funniest person on the planet. It's
hard to fault Woody Allen for play
ing his strength.

10 « ♦ ♦
Mountain View Theater
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on. 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for
lack of a better word, straight, and
this comedy about male mid-life
crisis probably won't please those
who enjoy watching females get
conquered. As an ovcr-40
songwriter, Dudley Moore is an
ingratiating humbler, and Edwards
gives the rest of the cast more than
enough depth to get by. Except for
Bo Derek, that is. This Playboy
attraction just may have found her
"niche" as the vacuous "10" the
title refers to.

Old Mill
Anne Bancroft fails miserably in
her first, and hopefully last, film as
a director. It's the heart-warming
story of a man. fattened since birth,
who now must choose whether to
slim down or face certain death like
his favorite (600-pound) cousin. I
mean really heavy, man.
Unfortunately, about the only
things which are heavy in this
movie are the actors, and the bur
den they lav on the audience for
nearly two hours. Dom DeLuise,
once a great comedian, is reduced
to a 400-pound sniveling glutton,
while his sister (Bancroft) screams
too much, cries too much and
hyperventilates too much.
The attempt to recreate the typi
cal New York/Italian family is so
stereotypically drawn it's absurd.
Oh. and then there's the food. The
slobs who waddle around 111 this
movie are so fat and eat so much
that anyone who dared bring pop
corn into the theater hid it under
his chair in shame. You'll never
want to eat again, let alone see
another movie. Take my advice:
save your money and get some
thing really entertaining — like a
toenail cutter.
—Mike Charlson
North Dallas Forty * *
Saturday. New Varsity
This movie can't figure out
whether it wants to be a good of
boy comedy (like Semi-Tough ) or a
hard-hitting expose of the cruel life
of a football hero. It ends up being
neither
Virtually the only reason to see
this movie — and it may be enough
— is for Nick Nolte, who forgets
most of his previous macho training
(or cannibalizes it for characteriza
tion value) in his role as a football
star who finally realizes that his
mind is willing to do more than his
nearly crippled and drug-fortified
body can supply.

Going in Style ** *
Palo Alto Square"
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns. Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
you to be effective.

The Rose *
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, hut why
bother? Really just another version
of A Star is Rom, except that this
one is clothed with a 1969 setting
and centered on a character vag
uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to '69, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When

teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.
— R.L.
1941 ** *
Park, Menio Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion'for Steven Spielberg! 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, hut as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. I ike a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler. 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very

harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comic action may he
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi, and Dan Aykroyd, Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— K.L.
My Fair lady * ¥ * +
Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
A big, rather tired version of the
famous Lerner and Loewe musical.
George Cukor keeps things from
falling apart; Rex Harrison acts as

if he's played Henry Higgins a mill
ion times (he probably has by
now); and Audrey Hepburn, even
though her singing voice is dubbed,
gives a spunky performance as the
Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolit
tle. Vivre Sa Vie, a Jean-Luc
Godard movie starring Anna
Karina, makes up the second half
of Monday's double bill.
— R.L.
Electric Horseman * *
Palo Alto Square
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol —a$ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially,
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and. despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
— R.L.
All Quiet on the Western Front
** * *
Saturday, 1 residder 7 p.m.
Lewis Milestone directed this
sensitive, remarkable 1930 version
of Erich Remarque's pacifist
novel. It's a timeless movie — and
it always seems to be a timely one,
too. George Cukor aided Miles
tone on the production; Fred Zin
nemann appears as a bit player.
— R.L.
Pa tton * * * *
Saturday, Tresidder 9 p.m.
George C. Scott's thunderous
performance as the blustering
General Patton is unforgettable,
and director Franklin Schaffner's
epic style supplies Scott with the
perfect stage, l-rancis Coppola
wrote the screenplay. Johnny Got
His Gun, written by Dalton
Trumbo, will end Saturday's triple
bill with a midnight showing.
— R.L.
The Seduction oj Joe Tynan
Friday, New Varsity * * #
Aian Alda pla>s a dashing,
young liberal senator from New
York whose rising career begins to
leave his wife and daughter behind.
Mer\l Streep plays a talented lob
byist who picks up the loose ends of
Alda's life. But in the end, well,
we'll find out by Thanksgiving. A
good movie probing the problems
of being tioth a politician and a per
son.
