Allies undecided on Olympic boycott
LONDON — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance said at the
end of a European tour yesterday he failed to win unanim
ous support among America's major allies for a boycott of
the Moscow Olympics in protest of Soviet military interven
tion in Afghanistan.
Concluding a tour that began Tuesday night in Bonn and
then took him to Rome and Paris. Vance could count only
Britain as a firm public supporter of President Jimmy Car
ter's decision to boycott the Summer Games in the Soviet
capital.
The secretary encountered the stiffest opposition in
Paris, where he had talks earlier in the day with French
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet. France has argued
that a boycott would disrupt East-West detente, and \ ance
apparently failed to alter that position.
At a brief news conference on the steps of the Foreign
Office after conferring with British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington, Vance refused to be drawn into a discussion of
the French stance. He would only say. "The French have
not yet arrived at a final decision. I said 1 was seeking a
coordinated response, not that everybody had to agree with
the United States."
He described his European talks as "very useful" and
said he found "general agreement on the nature of the
(Soviet) threat and on the general objectives." But, he
added. "There are differences of opinion on how to carry
them out."
Despite the French opposition to an Olympic boycott.
State Department spokesman Hodding Carter told repor
ters the United States has only just begun the process of
enlisting backers for the boycott. "This is an idea that has
come to a number of countries and that number will grow."
he said.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has indicated
his country will delay announcing a decision on a boycott
until May 19, the deadline to accept or reject the formal
invitation from the Soviets to take part in the Summer
Games.
The Italians reiterated to Vance that the government has
not yet decided to back a boycott.
Kelly resigns from party conference
WASHINGTON — Rep. Richard Kelly of Florida, impli
cated in the FBI bribery investigation, resigned yesterday
from the House Republican Conference, saying he wanted
to"save the Republican Party from an action that would not
be appropriate."
Kelly's move halted debate by the conference — the
organization of all GOP House members — on a motion by
Republican leaders to expel Kelly trom the conference
because of his admitted acceptance of $25,000 from I Bl
agents posing as Arab representatives.
Kelly, the only Republican among eight members ot
Congress who were implicated in the FBI undercover oper
ation. said he would not accept any more campaign con
tributions from the House Republican Congressional
Committee.
House leaders had recommended he be deprived of any
future campaign funds from that source.
Kelly previously had received $4000 from the Republi
can committee and was eligible for an additional $6000.
House GOP Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said the
Republican debate on Kelly did not deal with the question
of his guilt or innocence but only on whether his accepting
the $25,000 was a violation of House ethical standards.
Kelly has said he accepted the money as part of his own
investigation into possible wrongdoing.
Kelly's resignation from the conference, which sets policy
for House Republicans, does not affect his committee as
signments. his right to vote in the House or his right to
campaign for re-election as a Republican.
Storms wrack Southern California
Floodwaters gushed over the tops of overloaded dams
and broke through levees yesterday across Southern
California, sending thousands of people fleeing the desert
resort region of Palm Springs and inundating a hotel and
shopping district in San Diego.
New rain from the sixth in a series of Pacific storms over
the past nine days, which have left at least 31 people dead

and damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars, also
threatened dams in Arizona, Idaho and Utah.
Water cascading off the desert mountains about 100
miles east of Los Angeles tore through four levees and
swirled through chic resort communities that are home to
9000 people.
Phoenix. Ariz., remained a divided city with huge traffic
jams developing at the only two bridges open across the
swollen Salt River. Many schools were closed.
The San Diego River — normally only a trickle —grew 7
feet deep in just four hours and Hoods spread through
Mission Valley, home of San Diego's biggest hotel and
shopping district.
At least 23 persons have been killed in storms in Califor
nia, with four dead in Arizona, one in Utah and three in
Mexico.
Estimates of the damage from the storms, which have
dumped more than a foot of rain since Feb. 13. climbed to
more than $355 million, mostly in California where floods
and mudslides have already destroyed 110 homes and dam
aged another 1350.
A new storm system was expected to hit Southern
California last night with a respite hoped for this afternoon.
A weather serv ice forecaster offered one ray of hope in the
otherwise gloomy prediction: a storm poised to hit tomor
row afternoon might be deflected northward, giving the
rainlogged area a chance to dry out during the weekend.
More showers are predicted on Monday.
OPEC starts strategy meetings
LONDON — Representatives of six OPEC members
opened a strategy session yesterday, with Venezuelan
Energy Minister Huberto Calderon Berti predicting that
calm will return to world oil markets by June.
Calderon spoke at a news conference at the Venezuelan
Embassy before the start of a two-day meeting of the long
term strategy committee of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. The session was held behind closed
doors and under tight security at a London hotel.
The conference was expected to take up a recommenda
tion by OPEC technicians for regular quarterly or semian
nual price hikes pegged to currency market fluctuations,
economic growth rates and inflation.
The svstem would replace the past year's leapfrogging
price hikes that began in the wake of a seven-week Iranian
oil industry shutdown during that country's revolution.
Prices have more than doubled to around $30 per 42-gallon
barrel in the past year. Eleven of the 13 OPEC members
have posted price hikes since Saudi Arabia kicked off the
latest round of increases with a $2-a-barrel jump to $26 on
Jan. 28.
Calderon told the news conference several months would
be needed to restore stability to oil markets and reach an
accord on prices because consuming countries have sub
stantial oil supplies in storage.
"World reserves of oil normally run at around 4 billion
barrels," he said. "Because of the mild winter we have had.
it (the reserve) now is estimated at 5 billion barrels, which
means that there is a surplus in world oil inventories of
about 1 billion barrels.
"Until this surplus is absorbed, it is impossible to rev ert to
a traditional unified basic price on which to operate the
system of automatic price increases we are now discussing,"
Calderon said.
He added OPEC in the next 10 years could boost its
production to 35 million barrels daily, but OPEC nations
for now are likely to reduce output to conserve oil in reac
tion to the inventory surplus.
Women to join AFL-CIO leadership
BAL HARBOUR. Fla. — The male-dominated AFL
CIO agreed yesterday to set aside strongly held tradition
and name at least one woman to a top leadership position
for the first time in the 99-year history of American trade
union federations.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland announced the fed
eration's all-male executive council would set aside two of
its 35 seats for a woman and a minority representative as
vacancies occur.
Several council members are expected to retire this year.
The move, which was initiated and promoted by Kirk

land, was criticized as being inadequate by the only black
member now on the executive council, Frederick O'Neal,
president of Associated Actors and Artists of America.
"It is a little bit late and does not constitute a serious
conviction toward women or blacks." O'Neill told repor
ters. adding that more seats should have been set aside for
minorities.
However, Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of
I abor Union Women, hailed the action as "a tremendous
move that is much stronger and more than I had expected."
Although several women hold high elected posts within
individual unions, none has ever sat on the leadership coun
cil of the AFL-CIO nor its forerunners, which date back to
1881. Blacks have held seats on the executive council but
never in large numbers.
rhe AFL-ClO's leadership has come under growing
pressure to alter its tradition because of the dramatic rise in
numbers of unionized women over the past decade and the

high percentage of minorities in the labor movement.
Hie API.-CIO estimates that about 30 percent of unit
members are women and 17 percent are minorities.
In other action, Kirkland warned that organized lab
would not support wage restraints much longer on uni<
members "while other elements of society continue to pn
fiteer at our members' expense."
Stocks drop 18.34
NF.W YORK — The Dow Jones industrial average too
its sharpest drop in more than four months yesterday as th
stock market struggled through a volatile session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chips fell 15.34 t
<565..52, more than wiping out Wednesday's 10.84 gain. 1
was the average's largest loss since it tumbled 26.45 point

OPEC starts strategy meetings
LONDON — Representatives of six OPEC members
opened a strategy session yesterday, with Venezuelan
Energy Minister Huberto Calderon Berti predicting that
calm will return to world oil markets by June.
Calderon spoke at a news conference at the Venezuelan
Embassy before the start of a two-day meeting of the long
term strategy committee of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. The session was held behind closed
doors and under tight security at a London hotel.
The conference was expected to take up a recommenda
tion by OPEC technicians for regular quarterly or semian
nual price hikes pegged to currency market fluctuations,
economic growth rates and inflation.
The svstem would replace the past year's leapfrogging
price hikes that began in the wake of a seven-week Iranian
oil industry shutdown during that country's revolution.
Prices have more than doubled to around $30 per 42-gallon
barrel in the past year. Eleven of the 13 OPEC members
have posted price hikes since Saudi Arabia kicked off the
latest round of increases with a $2-a-barrel jump to $26 on
Jan. 28.
Calderon told the news conference several months would
be needed to restore stability to oil markets and reach an
accord on prices because consuming countries have sub
stantial oil supplies in storage.
"World reserves of oil normally run at around 4 billion
barrels," he said. "Because of the mild winter we have had.
it (the reserve) now is estimated at 5 billion barrels, which
means that there is a surplus in world oil inventories of
about 1 billion barrels.
"Until this surplus is absorbed, it is impossible to rev ert to
a traditional unified basic price on which to operate the
system of automatic price increases we are now discussing,"
Calderon said.
He added OPEC in the next 10 years could boost its
production to 35 million barrels daily, but OPEC nations
for now are likely to reduce output to conserve oil in reac
tion to the inventory surplus.
Women to join AFL-CIO leadership
BAL HARBOUR. Fla. — The male-dominated AFL
CIO agreed yesterday to set aside strongly held tradition
and name at least one woman to a top leadership position
for the first time in the 99-year history of American trade
union federations.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland announced the fed
eration's all-male executive council would set aside two of
its 35 seats for a woman and a minority representative as
vacancies occur.
Several council members are expected to retire this year.
The move, which was initiated and promoted by Kirk

land, was criticized as being inadequate by the only black
member now on the executive council, Frederick O'Neal,
president of Associated Actors and Artists of America.
"It is a little bit late and does not constitute a serious
conviction toward women or blacks." O'Neill told repor
ters. adding that more seats should have been set aside for
minorities.
However, Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of
I abor Union Women, hailed the action as "a tremendous
move that is much stronger and more than I had expected."
Although several women hold high elected posts within
individual unions, none has ever sat on the leadership coun
cil of the AFL-CIO nor its forerunners, which date back to
1881. Blacks have held seats on the executive council but
never in large numbers.
rhe AFL-ClO's leadership has come under growing
pressure to alter its tradition because of the dramatic rise in
numbers of unionized women over the past decade and the

high percentage of minorities in the labor movement.
Hie API.-CIO estimates that about 30 percent of unit
members are women and 17 percent are minorities.
In other action, Kirkland warned that organized lab
would not support wage restraints much longer on uni<
members "while other elements of society continue to pn
fiteer at our members' expense."

Allies undecided on Olympic boycott
LONDON — Secretary of State Cyrus Vance said at the
end of a European tour yesterday he failed to win unanim
ous support among America's major allies for a boycott of
the Moscow Olympics in protest of Soviet military interven
tion in Afghanistan.
Concluding a tour that began Tuesday night in Bonn and
then took him to Rome and Paris. Vance could count only
Britain as a firm public supporter of President Jimmy Car
ter's decision to boycott the Summer Games in the Soviet
capital.
The secretary encountered the stiffest opposition in
Paris, where he had talks earlier in the day with French
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet. France has argued
that a boycott would disrupt East-West detente, and \ ance
apparently failed to alter that position.
At a brief news conference on the steps of the Foreign
Office after conferring with British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington, Vance refused to be drawn into a discussion of
the French stance. He would only say. "The French have
not yet arrived at a final decision. I said 1 was seeking a
coordinated response, not that everybody had to agree with
the United States."
He described his European talks as "very useful" and
said he found "general agreement on the nature of the
(Soviet) threat and on the general objectives." But, he
added. "There are differences of opinion on how to carry
them out."
Despite the French opposition to an Olympic boycott.
State Department spokesman Hodding Carter told repor
ters the United States has only just begun the process of
enlisting backers for the boycott. "This is an idea that has
come to a number of countries and that number will grow."
he said.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has indicated
his country will delay announcing a decision on a boycott
until May 19, the deadline to accept or reject the formal
invitation from the Soviets to take part in the Summer
Games.
The Italians reiterated to Vance that the government has
not yet decided to back a boycott.
Kelly resigns from party conference
WASHINGTON — Rep. Richard Kelly of Florida, impli
cated in the FBI bribery investigation, resigned yesterday
from the House Republican Conference, saying he wanted
to"save the Republican Party from an action that would not
be appropriate."
Kelly's move halted debate by the conference — the
organization of all GOP House members — on a motion by
Republican leaders to expel Kelly trom the conference
because of his admitted acceptance of $25,000 from I Bl
agents posing as Arab representatives.
Kelly, the only Republican among eight members ot
Congress who were implicated in the FBI undercover oper
ation. said he would not accept any more campaign con
tributions from the House Republican Congressional
Committee.
House leaders had recommended he be deprived of any
future campaign funds from that source.
Kelly previously had received $4000 from the Republi
can committee and was eligible for an additional $6000.
House GOP Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said the
Republican debate on Kelly did not deal with the question
of his guilt or innocence but only on whether his accepting
the $25,000 was a violation of House ethical standards.
Kelly has said he accepted the money as part of his own
investigation into possible wrongdoing.
Kelly's resignation from the conference, which sets policy
for House Republicans, does not affect his committee as
signments. his right to vote in the House or his right to
campaign for re-election as a Republican.
Storms wrack Southern California
Floodwaters gushed over the tops of overloaded dams
and broke through levees yesterday across Southern
California, sending thousands of people fleeing the desert
resort region of Palm Springs and inundating a hotel and
shopping district in San Diego.
New rain from the sixth in a series of Pacific storms over
the past nine days, which have left at least 31 people dead

and damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars, also
threatened dams in Arizona, Idaho and Utah.
Water cascading off the desert mountains about 100
miles east of Los Angeles tore through four levees and
swirled through chic resort communities that are home to
9000 people.
Phoenix. Ariz., remained a divided city with huge traffic
jams developing at the only two bridges open across the
swollen Salt River. Many schools were closed.
The San Diego River — normally only a trickle —grew 7
feet deep in just four hours and Hoods spread through
Mission Valley, home of San Diego's biggest hotel and
shopping district.
At least 23 persons have been killed in storms in Califor
nia, with four dead in Arizona, one in Utah and three in
Mexico.
Estimates of the damage from the storms, which have
dumped more than a foot of rain since Feb. 13. climbed to
more than $355 million, mostly in California where floods
and mudslides have already destroyed 110 homes and dam
aged another 1350.

end of a European tour yesterday he failed to win unanim
ous support among America's major allies for a boycott of
the Moscow Olympics in protest of Soviet military interven
tion in Afghanistan.
Concluding a tour that began Tuesday night in Bonn and
then took him to Rome and Paris. Vance could count only
Britain as a firm public supporter of President Jimmy Car
ter's decision to boycott the Summer Games in the Soviet
capital.
The secretary encountered the stiffest opposition in
Paris, where he had talks earlier in the day with French
Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet. France has argued
that a boycott would disrupt East-West detente, and \ ance
apparently failed to alter that position.
At a brief news conference on the steps of the Foreign
Office after conferring with British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington, Vance refused to be drawn into a discussion of
the French stance. He would only say. "The French have
not yet arrived at a final decision. I said 1 was seeking a
coordinated response, not that everybody had to agree with
the United States."
He described his European talks as "very useful" and
said he found "general agreement on the nature of the
(Soviet) threat and on the general objectives." But, he
added. "There are differences of opinion on how to carry
them out."
Despite the French opposition to an Olympic boycott.
State Department spokesman Hodding Carter told repor
ters the United States has only just begun the process of
enlisting backers for the boycott. "This is an idea that has
come to a number of countries and that number will grow."
he said.
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has indicated
his country will delay announcing a decision on a boycott
until May 19, the deadline to accept or reject the formal
invitation from the Soviets to take part in the Summer
Games.
The Italians reiterated to Vance that the government has
not yet decided to back a boycott.
Kelly resigns from party conference
WASHINGTON — Rep. Richard Kelly of Florida, impli
cated in the FBI bribery investigation, resigned yesterday
from the House Republican Conference, saying he wanted
to"save the Republican Party from an action that would not
be appropriate."
Kelly's move halted debate by the conference — the
organization of all GOP House members — on a motion by
Republican leaders to expel Kelly trom the conference
because of his admitted acceptance of $25,000 from I Bl
agents posing as Arab representatives.
Kelly, the only Republican among eight members ot
Congress who were implicated in the FBI undercover oper
ation. said he would not accept any more campaign con
tributions from the House Republican Congressional
Committee.
House leaders had recommended he be deprived of any
future campaign funds from that source.
Kelly previously had received $4000 from the Republi
can committee and was eligible for an additional $6000.
House GOP Leader John Rhodes of Arizona said the
Republican debate on Kelly did not deal with the question
of his guilt or innocence but only on whether his accepting
the $25,000 was a violation of House ethical standards.
Kelly has said he accepted the money as part of his own
investigation into possible wrongdoing.
Kelly's resignation from the conference, which sets policy
for House Republicans, does not affect his committee as
signments. his right to vote in the House or his right to
campaign for re-election as a Republican.
Storms wrack Southern California
Floodwaters gushed over the tops of overloaded dams
and broke through levees yesterday across Southern
California, sending thousands of people fleeing the desert
resort region of Palm Springs and inundating a hotel and
shopping district in San Diego.
New rain from the sixth in a series of Pacific storms over
the past nine days, which have left at least 31 people dead

and damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars, also
threatened dams in Arizona, Idaho and Utah.
Water cascading off the desert mountains about 100
miles east of Los Angeles tore through four levees and
swirled through chic resort communities that are home to
9000 people.
Phoenix. Ariz., remained a divided city with huge traffic
jams developing at the only two bridges open across the
swollen Salt River. Many schools were closed.
The San Diego River — normally only a trickle —grew 7
feet deep in just four hours and Hoods spread through
Mission Valley, home of San Diego's biggest hotel and
shopping district.
At least 23 persons have been killed in storms in Califor
nia, with four dead in Arizona, one in Utah and three in
Mexico.
Estimates of the damage from the storms, which have
dumped more than a foot of rain since Feb. 13. climbed to
more than $355 million, mostly in California where floods
and mudslides have already destroyed 110 homes and dam
aged another 1350.
A new storm system was expected to hit Southern
California last night with a respite hoped for this afternoon.
A weather serv ice forecaster offered one ray of hope in the
otherwise gloomy prediction: a storm poised to hit tomor
row afternoon might be deflected northward, giving the
rainlogged area a chance to dry out during the weekend.
More showers are predicted on Monday.
OPEC starts strategy meetings
LONDON — Representatives of six OPEC members
opened a strategy session yesterday, with Venezuelan
Energy Minister Huberto Calderon Berti predicting that
calm will return to world oil markets by June.
Calderon spoke at a news conference at the Venezuelan
Embassy before the start of a two-day meeting of the long
term strategy committee of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries. The session was held behind closed
doors and under tight security at a London hotel.
The conference was expected to take up a recommenda
tion by OPEC technicians for regular quarterly or semian
nual price hikes pegged to currency market fluctuations,
economic growth rates and inflation.
The svstem would replace the past year's leapfrogging
price hikes that began in the wake of a seven-week Iranian
oil industry shutdown during that country's revolution.
Prices have more than doubled to around $30 per 42-gallon
barrel in the past year. Eleven of the 13 OPEC members
have posted price hikes since Saudi Arabia kicked off the
latest round of increases with a $2-a-barrel jump to $26 on
Jan. 28.
Calderon told the news conference several months would
be needed to restore stability to oil markets and reach an
accord on prices because consuming countries have sub
stantial oil supplies in storage.
"World reserves of oil normally run at around 4 billion
barrels," he said. "Because of the mild winter we have had.
it (the reserve) now is estimated at 5 billion barrels, which
means that there is a surplus in world oil inventories of
about 1 billion barrels.
"Until this surplus is absorbed, it is impossible to rev ert to
a traditional unified basic price on which to operate the
system of automatic price increases we are now discussing,"
Calderon said.
He added OPEC in the next 10 years could boost its
production to 35 million barrels daily, but OPEC nations
for now are likely to reduce output to conserve oil in reac
tion to the inventory surplus.
Women to join AFL-CIO leadership
BAL HARBOUR. Fla. — The male-dominated AFL
CIO agreed yesterday to set aside strongly held tradition
and name at least one woman to a top leadership position
for the first time in the 99-year history of American trade
union federations.
AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland announced the fed
eration's all-male executive council would set aside two of
its 35 seats for a woman and a minority representative as
vacancies occur.
Several council members are expected to retire this year.
The move, which was initiated and promoted by Kirk

land, was criticized as being inadequate by the only black
member now on the executive council, Frederick O'Neal,
president of Associated Actors and Artists of America.
"It is a little bit late and does not constitute a serious
conviction toward women or blacks." O'Neill told repor
ters. adding that more seats should have been set aside for
minorities.
However, Joyce Miller, president of the Coalition of
I abor Union Women, hailed the action as "a tremendous
move that is much stronger and more than I had expected."
Although several women hold high elected posts within
individual unions, none has ever sat on the leadership coun
cil of the AFL-CIO nor its forerunners, which date back to
1881. Blacks have held seats on the executive council but
never in large numbers.
rhe AFL-ClO's leadership has come under growing
pressure to alter its tradition because of the dramatic rise in
numbers of unionized women over the past decade and the

high percentage of minorities in the labor movement.
Hie API.-CIO estimates that about 30 percent of unit
members are women and 17 percent are minorities.
In other action, Kirkland warned that organized lab
would not support wage restraints much longer on uni<
members "while other elements of society continue to pn
fiteer at our members' expense."
