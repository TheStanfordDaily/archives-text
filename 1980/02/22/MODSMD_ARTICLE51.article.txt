"Do you believe in magic?" Sandy Mulholland asked a hesitant child,
after promising to let a metal blade pass magically through her finger. The
other chilren watched, amazed, as the blade dropped and the child showed
them her linger, untouched.
Mulholland. a San Francisco magician/comedian, performed for the
children in the Bing Nursery After-School Program as a preview for a Feb.
22 variety show to raise funds for the Stanford Council on Child Care.
The show will feature Mulholland, another magician, a 10-year old
disco-roller skater, juggling, and perhaps fire-eating.
Mulholland. who has been performing magic and comedy for nine years
in New York, New Mexico, Michigan and California, said he enjoys
performing lor children because it "gives a good balance to my adult
nightclub performances."
Laura Selznick, a Parent Representative for the Council and Publicity
Coordinator for the show, said "there are few enough things for the
children in this area ... I feel good about having this show available as a
theater experience lor children."
The Council on Child Care coordinates fund-raising activities for the
child-care centers in the Stanford community , which include Bing Nursery
School, Escondido Village Nursery School, Child Care Center of the
Stanford Community, Craig Infant Program and the Lutheran Toddler's
Center.
The council raises money for day-care scholarships and the Child Care
Resource Center in Escondido Village for day-care referral and work
shops. Other projects include a book sale, sending letters to alumni and
friends of the University asking for donations, and organizing the Pickle
Family Circus appearance each spring.
"Day care is expensive," said Selznick, pointing out that through the
council's scholarship program, people can apply for help." President Hope
Rayniond-Schmike said the council formed three years ago, out of a need
for an organization to coordinate the fund-raising efforts of the various
child-care centers and provide a plan for scholarships for children in the
community.
Performances of the magic/variety show will be at 2 and 4 p.m. in
