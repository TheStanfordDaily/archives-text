During the second stage of the
search, two students and two alumni

money, to do the macro part of the
search by mail," Stone said.
I le added that association volunteers
would be sent an additional mailing

"Alumni and students and every
body else certainly have an interest in
it, but faculty probably ought to be
"more equal" than others. The proce
dure the board (of trustees) prescribed.
I feeL addresses those priorities art
fully," Stone said.

Clebsch expressed a similar sentiment
and added that faculty support for the
new president was "a sine qua non."

and alumni through a mail solicitation
for candidates.
During the second stage of the
search, two students and two alumni

short list of candidates.
Finally, the faculty committee will
forward a very short list of candidates
to the Board of Trustees' committee

with hoard approval.
The process will begin immediately
with recommendations expected in
time for the board to act before Ly
mans' Aug. 1 departure.
Specifically, the students will work

group, according to Gart.
Of the at-large members, two will be
undergraduates and two will be

He said organizations in each of the
four areas would be asked to submit

tions must apply.
All nominations will be considered
by the ASSU Nominations Committee
and final recommendations for the pos

Senate for approval at a special meet

their qualifications and general qualifi

of Directors) felt it would be more
economical, both in terms of time and
money, to do the macro part of the
search by mail," Stone said.
I le added that association volunteers
would be sent an additional mailing
asking them to take special note of the
Almanac request for input.
Authority
When it comes time to place two
alumni on the faculty committee for

others who got involved in some of the
preliminary discussions that the facul
ty's role is clearly the principle one in
terms of interested constituencies,"
Stone said.
"Alumni and students and every
body else certainly have an interest in
it, but faculty probably ought to be
"more equal" than others. The proce
dure the board (of trustees) prescribed.
I feeL addresses those priorities art
fully," Stone said.
At the senate meeting yesterday.
Clebsch expressed a similar sentiment
and added that faculty support for the
new president was "a sine qua non."
Albert Hastorf, chairman of the se
nate, called faculty support a "neces
sary condition" for appointment.
Clebsch added that the hoard

"enjoy the widest possible support
among students and alumni" as well as

faculty, hut said hoard instructions to
him "omitted . . . that students and
alumni particpate in the final formula
tion of our (the committee's) recom
mendation."
Clarifying the student and alumni
role last night, however. Board Presi
dent Peter Bing said that "after the
discussions with the faculty committee,
if the students wish to make their own
comment to the trustee committee, it
would he appropriate for them to do
