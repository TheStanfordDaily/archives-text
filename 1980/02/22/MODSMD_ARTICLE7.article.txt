an intense national debate.

the Selective Service System to register
men, the president sent a second prop
osal asking Congress to permit him to
register women. Under these plans, all
19- and 20-year-olds would he required
to report to their local post offices to fill

out government forms listing their
names, addresses, birth dates, and so
cial security numbers. This could be
required as early as this summer.
Debate over the issue of women's
registration has already polarized
feminist groups, split Congress and
raised some basic questions about the
role of women in American society.
A Gallup poll of 18- to 24-year-olds
found that most men feel that women
should be included in an> restoration of
the draft (61 percent to 35 percent).
Women opposed being drafted (5N
percent to percent). They did not,
however, oppose their registration, by a
slim majority of 4K percent to 47 per
cent.
Political experts generally hold that
while Congress will appropriate money
to register men. it will probably kill the
women's registration issue in commit
tee.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall said, "Take a look at (House
Majority Leader) l ip O'Neill. In Con
gress. the average age is in the upper
fifties, most are from small towns. They
represent a different set of values."
Marshall said that while he sees no
reason why women should not be regis
tered if registration were enacted, he
believes the proposal would not gain a
majority in Congress.
House Military Personnel Subcom
mittee chairman Richard White (D-
Tex.) has predicted the measure will
fail.
Carter said he wishes to register
women in the belief that "equal obliga
tions deserve equal rights." This link

ing of the Equal Rights Amendment —
which has yet to be passed by three
fourths of the sta % legislatures — to
the draft has left feminist groups with a
very hot issue.
Most feminist organizations, such as
the National Organization of Women
(NOW) oppose both the draft and re
gistration. However, if either of these
programs were adopted, the organiza
tions believe women would have to be
included.
"The National Organization for
Women opposes the imminent regist
ration and draft of either men or
women on the grounds that an effective
voluntary recruitment program would
be sufficient," said Andrea Teper,
NOW's San Francisco chapter presi
dent.
Teper also criticized the military for
"sexist and racist policies and prac
tices" and said that Carter and Con
gress "have full authority now — with
out FRA — to register and draft wo
men."
"American women," Teper as
serted, "who have virtually no rep
resentation at the national political
level, or in the determination of foreign
affairs policy, are on the brink of in
voluntary military registration and
draft."
Reaction here to the possible regist
ration of women reflects the national
dilemma.
Marty Fuentes, a founder of Stan
ford Against Soviet Aggression, said
he is "for women's registration person
ally" but that his organization "did not
form to take a stand on women's regist
ration, only on registration as a whole."
Women Against War activist Laura
Kay summarized the basic feminist at
titude on campus. "1 don't think there
should be any draft — period," she
said.
Most groups on campus concur that
registration is inherently linked to the
draft.
Although both Marshall and Hoover
Senior Fellow Rita Ricardo Campbell
have noted that few women are physi

cally capable of combat duty, there are
currently 150.000 women serving in
the Army. Air Force, Navy and Marine
Corps. This 8 percent of the armed
forces is expected to reach 12 percent
by 1985.
Nevertheless, women in the armed
forces are supposed to be excluded
from combat. They are excluded from
direct combat by law in the Air Force.
Marines and Navy. The Army ac
complishes the same end by policy.
Army Secretary Clifford Alexander
said military officials in the Pentagon

favor both registration of women ant
expansion of military roles for women
"We cannot afford to waste human ta
lent," he said.
Despite the Pentagon's efforts, Con
gress is not inclined to register women,
according to subcommittee chairman
White, because the White House
fought "tooth and nail" against the
proposed registration of 18-year
old males last year. Carter already has
the authority to register men. Congres
sional action would be necessary to in
stitute the registration of women.

Debate over the issue of women's
registration has already polarized
feminist groups, split Congress and
raised some basic questions about the
role of women in American society.
A Gallup poll of 18- to 24-year-olds
found that most men feel that women
should be included in an> restoration of
the draft (61 percent to 35 percent).
Women opposed being drafted (5N
percent to percent). They did not,
however, oppose their registration, by a
slim majority of 4K percent to 47 per
cent.
Political experts generally hold that
while Congress will appropriate money
to register men. it will probably kill the
women's registration issue in commit

Most feminist organizations, such as
the National Organization of Women
(NOW) oppose both the draft and re
gistration. However, if either of these
programs were adopted, the organiza

included.
"The National Organization for
Women opposes the imminent regist
ration and draft of either men or
women on the grounds that an effective
voluntary recruitment program would
be sufficient," said Andrea Teper,
NOW's San Francisco chapter presi

Teper also criticized the military for
"sexist and racist policies and prac

gress "have full authority now — with
out FRA — to register and draft wo
men."
"American women," Teper as

resentation at the national political
level, or in the determination of foreign
affairs policy, are on the brink of in
voluntary military registration and
draft."
