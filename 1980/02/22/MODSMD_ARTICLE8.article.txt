PARIS — Saudi Arabia's
King Khalid appears to be
gravely ill. and the royal family
appears to be preparing for his
imminent succession. Western
analysts here have concluded
from a series of developments
Wednesday.
All the Saudi Cabinet minis
ters who were abroad rushed
home Wednesday.
The Saudi government asked
the French government to post
pone the Feb. 23-25 visit of
French Prime Minister
Raymond Barre "because of
King Khalid"s state of health." a
French official announcement
said.
Since Barre was not scheduled
to see the 69-year-old king.
French officials have concluded
that the postponement means
that other leading Saudis, such as
Crown Prince Fahd. the Saudi
premier, will not be available to
see Barre.
It was confirmed that two
specialists from the Cleveland
Clinic, where King Khalid un
derwent open heart surgery in
197 N. ure on their way to Saudi
Arabia. They are Dr. Medhi
Razavi. a cardiologist, and Dr.
William Kaiser, a urologist and
chairman of the board ot the
clinic.

"Everything is taking place as
if they are convening the grand
council to name a new king if he
dies." said a French official.
A succession now would take
place right after the regime's
great scare over the recent re
bellion in Mecca that the Saudi
authorities had a great deal of
difficulty putting down.
French sources with access to
intelligence estimates say that, as
far as they are concerned, it is not
a matter of whether the present
Saudi family regime is over
thrown but of when in the next
few years.
They say that the Mecca revolt
was far more serious than any of
the public reports have shown so
far and that the events at Mecca
were only part of a plan in which
there were also to be simultane
ous uprisings in the ■capital of
Jeddah: Medina, the second holy
city after Mecca: and Dharhan.
the headquarters city of the
Arabian-American Oil Co.
Saudi security got wind of the
operations in the other cities be
sides Mecca and was able to head
them off, according to the
French. ITiey say that 3000 to
4000 rebels representing mem
bers of half the country's tribes
were involved altogether. Re
cordings broadcast from the
minarets of the mosque de
nounced the alleged corruption

of the royal families. French
sources said.
There seems to he no douht
among the specialists that the
council of family elders, made up
of about a half-dozen of the 32
half-brothers who head the huge
Saudi family, would name Crown
Prince Fahd to succeed King
Khalid it he died or were forced
by illness to abdicate.
Interest centers around who
would he named the next crown
prince. The leading candidate is
considered to be Prince Abdul
lah ben Abdel Aziz, the head of
the national guard. He was one
of those hastily summoned home
Wednesday, from Baghdad.
Despite his seniority. Prince
Abdullah seems to have two dis
advantages. One is that he has a
sev ere stammer that makes it dif
ficult for him to make public ad
dresses. The other may be the
role of the national guard in the
uprising.
It was originally assigned to
flush out the rebels from the
main mosque in Mecca, but it
was hurriedly withdrawn and re
placed by its rival, the regular
army, when it was realized that
the rebel leaders included sev
eral former national guard offic
ers, French sources say. A large
portion of the rebels" arms were
stolen from national guard ar

King Khalid"s state of health." a
French official announcement
said.
Since Barre was not scheduled
to see the 69-year-old king.
French officials have concluded
that the postponement means
that other leading Saudis, such as
Crown Prince Fahd. the Saudi
premier, will not be available to
see Barre.
It was confirmed that two
specialists from the Cleveland
Clinic, where King Khalid un
derwent open heart surgery in
197 N. ure on their way to Saudi
Arabia. They are Dr. Medhi
Razavi. a cardiologist, and Dr.
William Kaiser, a urologist and
chairman of the board ot the
clinic.

"Everything is taking place as
if they are convening the grand
council to name a new king if he
dies." said a French official.
A succession now would take
place right after the regime's
great scare over the recent re
bellion in Mecca that the Saudi
authorities had a great deal of
difficulty putting down.
French sources with access to
intelligence estimates say that, as
far as they are concerned, it is not
a matter of whether the present
Saudi family regime is over
thrown but of when in the next
few years.
They say that the Mecca revolt
was far more serious than any of
the public reports have shown so
far and that the events at Mecca
were only part of a plan in which
there were also to be simultane
ous uprisings in the ■capital of
Jeddah: Medina, the second holy
city after Mecca: and Dharhan.
the headquarters city of the
Arabian-American Oil Co.
Saudi security got wind of the
operations in the other cities be
sides Mecca and was able to head
them off, according to the
French. ITiey say that 3000 to
4000 rebels representing mem
bers of half the country's tribes
were involved altogether. Re
cordings broadcast from the
minarets of the mosque de

of the royal families. French
sources said.
There seems to he no douht
among the specialists that the
council of family elders, made up
of about a half-dozen of the 32
half-brothers who head the huge
Saudi family, would name Crown
Prince Fahd to succeed King
Khalid it he died or were forced
by illness to abdicate.
Interest centers around who
would he named the next crown
prince. The leading candidate is
considered to be Prince Abdul
lah ben Abdel Aziz, the head of
the national guard. He was one
of those hastily summoned home
Wednesday, from Baghdad.
Despite his seniority. Prince
Abdullah seems to have two dis
advantages. One is that he has a
sev ere stammer that makes it dif
ficult for him to make public ad
dresses. The other may be the
role of the national guard in the
uprising.
It was originally assigned to
flush out the rebels from the
main mosque in Mecca, but it
was hurriedly withdrawn and re
placed by its rival, the regular
army, when it was realized that
the rebel leaders included sev
eral former national guard offic
ers, French sources say. A large
portion of the rebels" arms were
stolen from national guard ar
