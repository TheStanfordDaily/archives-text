# Thai military threatens Kriangsak rule
## 
### John Burgess The Washington Post 
BANGKOR — Despite Thailand's trap
pings of parliamentary democracy, its politics
are still very much manipulated b\ the armed
forces, a point firmly underscored by a neat
political minuet here last month.
It was a period of unusual labor unrest,
rumors of strife among senior military offic
ers and a last-minute cancellation of a trip
abroad by the prime minister.
They were the classic signs of a coup, the
type of upheaval that puts American
policymakers on edge as they follow the in
ternal twists and turns of Washington's main
ally in this troubled region.
With Vietnamese armies poised perilously
close to Thailand's Cambodian border, the
Thais' position as a window of Western influ
ence in the turmoil of Indochina has never
been more in the spotlight.
As recent events demonstrated, however,
the generals who run this country — and
Gen. Rriangsak Chamonon. the prime minis
ter. in particular — are firmly on center
stage.
Never colonized
Unlike other peoples of Southeast Asia,
the Thais were never colonized and never
fought a war of independence. Mass-based
political movements never developed, and
parties have remained small in membership
and large in number. In most years since

1932. when absolute monarchy ended, these
parties have been denied a serious role in
governing the country — that was handled by
a succession of generally benevolent military
elites.
Kriangsak*s government is the latest of th
ese. He took power in a bloodless coup in
1977 iind then called elections that reaf
firmed his position. His performance in of
fice has led foreign observers to label him
Ihailand's most enlightened soldier
politician. But a soldier-politician he remains
and as such he suffers many of the same
problems as his predecessors.
Details of last month's events remain un
clear. I he crisij>. it it can be called that, began
with a strike at the I hai tobacco monopoly, a
government-owned factory that has exclu
sive rights to manufacture cigarettes in Thai
land. By Thai standards, workers there have
a strong union and. along with employees of
other government-owned enterprises, are
among the best paid in the country.
Corruption
I he workers walked out demanding a
higher cost-of-living allowance and an in\ es
tigation into alleged corruption in executive
offices. Management agreed to negotiate and
granted a few of the demands, but it then
ordered everyone to return to work or face
dismissal. It was an unusually strong re
sponse, diplomats believe. Riot police were
called in and made a point of displaying au

tomatic rifles and tear gas.
Meanwhile, affiliated unions at two dozen
other state enterprises — including those
providing electricity, transportation and
telephone services — threatened a sympathy
strike.
Diplomats also pointed to the simultane
ous reappearance of extreme rightist
paramilitary groups in Bangkok — more
than 1000 of the groups' supporters de
monstrated outside the Soviet Embassy to
protest the invasion of Afghanistan. Their
conclusion was that Kriangsak was being
challenged.
Personal role
It soon became clear that the prime minis
ter was taking a personal role in the strike
negotiations. He publicly urged workers to
return to their jobs and warned that four
unnamed men would be punished for "in
stigating" the strike.
He also called a meeting of senior govern
ment leaders, reportedly including most
major military figures, to discuss antistrike
strategy.
The following day, Kriangsak was
scheduled to leave for West Germany to at
tend an international conference on farming
(he is also minister of agriculture). He de
cided to send the deputy prime minister in his
place.
