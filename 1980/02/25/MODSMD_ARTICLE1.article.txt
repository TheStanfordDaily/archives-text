## 
### Tyler Marshall The Los Angeles Times 
NEW DELI 11. India — Soviet forces in Kabul
have thrown a tight security ring around key
installations in the city in an apparent effort to
prevent further unrest, according to reports
reaching here yesterday.
The increased security measures came late
Saturday, following more than two days of bit
ter anti-Soviet demonstrations and rioting in
the capital city ol Afghanistan. Political
sources in Moscow with contacts in Kabul es
timated that the disturbances may have taken
as many as 150 lives and left twice that number
injured.
As a tense calm descended over Kabul.
Soviet forces moved armored personnel car
riers and infantry into position to block off the
major areas ol the city, according to one source
who had been in contact with Kabul yesterday.
"They appear to be trying to cut the city in

half to reduce movement from north to south,"
the source said.
In addition toblocking major thoroughfares,
the Soviet Embassy and the Micro Rayan
ministerial and apartment complex in north
eastern Kabul were conpletely blocked ott. A
large number of Soviet advisers li\e and work
in the Micro Rayan development, which has
become a symbol of So\ let presence in Kabul.
The Bala Hissar Fort was also cordoned oft
by troops. A major contingent of Soviet army
troops is quartered in the historic fort, perched
atop a hill overlooking the city'smain shopping
bazaars. It was in this area that some ol the
heaviest tiring was reported during the distur
bances.
Soviet lives
The moves appeared to have been taken to
protect the lives of Soviet civilian and military
advisers, as well as key Soviet military installa
tions in the city at a time when anti-Soviet

I eel ing is at a high pitch.
Now. two months after Soviet troops poured
across the Oxus River into Afghanistan, the
Kremlin faces an increasingly unhappy set ol
options there and is trying to buy more time to
achieve its goals at minimum cost, diplomatic
analysts in Moscow said yesterday.
According to reports from Kabul, the vio
lence ol Thursday and Friday tapered oil shar
ply Saturday, although infrequent tiring con
tinued to be heard in some parts ot the city.
However, government attempts to coax
shopkeepers to break the tree-day-old general
strike in the city apparently tailed and almost
ail businesses remained closed Saturday. There
was no information whether the strike con
tinued yesterday, a normal working day in
Moslem Afghanistan.
It was also unclear what transpired lollowing
calls by anti-Soviet dissidents tor government
workiers to join the general stirke by not ap

pearing tor work Saturday. One report indi
cated that the beleaguered Soviet-backed
government of Babrak Karmal may have de
clared a holiday Saturday to avoid the embar
rassment ol government workers joining the
strike.
Cabinet shoot-out
Reports emerged Irom Kabul yesterday
about a Cabinet level shoot-out two-and-a
half weeks ago which apparently claimed the
lives to two leading memehers ot Karmal's
government.
There had been rumors ol major disagree
ments within t he Afghan leadership earlier this
month, but no shooting incident has been offi
cially admitted.
According to one account related here.
Karmal's Planning Minister Sultan Ali
Kishtmand was shot lollowing an argument
with another senior official concerning
suggested chanties in the national flag.

Shortly after the Marxist government of Nur
Mohammad Taraki took power in a violent
coup nearly two years ago, it changed the na
tional tlag from a red, black and green tricolor
to an all-red banner, similar to the Soviet llag.
The lack ol at least a splash ol Islamic green
angered the population and has proved to he
one ol the most unpopular acts since the Mar
xists came to power.
II the account ol Kishtmand's death is cor
rect. it would be the second gunhattle at the
presidential palace in\ol\ ing senior goverment
leaders in lour months. I lafi/ullah Amin is said
to have sei/ed power Irom laraki last Sept. 14
following a bloody shootout. Amin was later
killed himsell about the time ol the Soviet inva
sion in late December.
The incident would also he a major blow to
Soviet efforts to build a broad-based Afghan
leadership, drawing support Irom all Marxist
factions.

NEW DELI 11. India — Soviet forces in Kabul
have thrown a tight security ring around key
installations in the city in an apparent effort to
prevent further unrest, according to reports
reaching here yesterday.
The increased security measures came late
Saturday, following more than two days of bit
ter anti-Soviet demonstrations and rioting in
the capital city ol Afghanistan. Political
sources in Moscow with contacts in Kabul es
timated that the disturbances may have taken
as many as 150 lives and left twice that number
injured.
As a tense calm descended over Kabul.
Soviet forces moved armored personnel car
riers and infantry into position to block off the
major areas ol the city, according to one source
who had been in contact with Kabul yesterday.
"They appear to be trying to cut the city in

half to reduce movement from north to south,"
the source said.
In addition toblocking major thoroughfares,
the Soviet Embassy and the Micro Rayan
ministerial and apartment complex in north
eastern Kabul were conpletely blocked ott. A
large number of Soviet advisers li\e and work
in the Micro Rayan development, which has
become a symbol of So\ let presence in Kabul.
The Bala Hissar Fort was also cordoned oft
by troops. A major contingent of Soviet army
troops is quartered in the historic fort, perched
atop a hill overlooking the city'smain shopping
bazaars. It was in this area that some ol the
heaviest tiring was reported during the distur
bances.
Soviet lives
The moves appeared to have been taken to
protect the lives of Soviet civilian and military
advisers, as well as key Soviet military installa
tions in the city at a time when anti-Soviet

I eel ing is at a high pitch.
Now. two months after Soviet troops poured
across the Oxus River into Afghanistan, the
Kremlin faces an increasingly unhappy set ol
options there and is trying to buy more time to
achieve its goals at minimum cost, diplomatic
analysts in Moscow said yesterday.
According to reports from Kabul, the vio
lence ol Thursday and Friday tapered oil shar
ply Saturday, although infrequent tiring con
tinued to be heard in some parts ot the city.
However, government attempts to coax
shopkeepers to break the tree-day-old general
strike in the city apparently tailed and almost
ail businesses remained closed Saturday. There
was no information whether the strike con
tinued yesterday, a normal working day in
Moslem Afghanistan.
It was also unclear what transpired lollowing
calls by anti-Soviet dissidents tor government
workiers to join the general stirke by not ap

pearing tor work Saturday. One report indi
cated that the beleaguered Soviet-backed
government of Babrak Karmal may have de
clared a holiday Saturday to avoid the embar
rassment ol government workers joining the
strike.
Cabinet shoot-out
Reports emerged Irom Kabul yesterday
about a Cabinet level shoot-out two-and-a
half weeks ago which apparently claimed the
lives to two leading memehers ot Karmal's
government.
There had been rumors ol major disagree
ments within t he Afghan leadership earlier this
month, but no shooting incident has been offi
cially admitted.
