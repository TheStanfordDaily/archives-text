# Taiwan dissident's arrest sparks criticism

TAIPEI. Taiwan — Mounting the most
extensive manhunt in Taiwan's history,
police agencies patrolled every coastal
fishing village, raided private homes and
flashed pictures of the island's most
wanted criminal across television screens.
After a month-long search spurred by a
$70,000 reward, the police finally got
their man. Their quarry, who had under
gone plastic surgery in an effort to elude
the police, was not. as an outsider might
have suspected, a mass murderer or an
armed robber but a slightly built political
yctivist names Shih Ming-Teh.
Shih's arrest, on suspicion of sedition,
climaxed a political crackdown here so
severe that it has stirred demonstrations in
the United States and elicited inquiries
from even pro-Taiwan congressmen.
Barbs about Taiwan's treatment of its dis
sidents have also come from Communist
authorities on the Chinese mainland.
Following a violent anti-government
rally in the southern port city of
Kaohsiung on Dec. 10. the Kuomintang
(Nationalist Party) regime here shut
down every dissident publication and
jailed almost every opposition politician
on the island. 65 people in all.
Native Taiwanese
The dissidents, mostly native
Taiwanese clamoring for more influence
in a government still controlled by aging
refugees from the mainland, are being in
vestigated for possible involvement in
seditious activities, according to the
Taiwan Garrison Command, the island's
top security agency.
Of the island's 17 million people, about
14 percent are Chinese who came to
Taiwan when Chiang Kai-shek, his
Nationalist government and his army
were pushed off the mainland by Com
munist forces in 1949. Most of the others
are Taiwanese, largely of Chinese stock.

Under the martial law that has been in
force here since 1949, the 56 people still
in cutody in connection with the recent
disturbances could be given sentences
ranging from seven years' imprisonment
to execution. None has gone to trial yet.
but there are fears that dissent here will be
permanently silenced.
"The opposition has been smashed."
said Shih's American wife, Linda Arrigo.
who was deported for her role in the Dec.
10 demonstration and riot.
Pretext
"The KMT (Kuomintang) just couldn't
stand to see the opposition growing so
fast and has used the rally as a pretext for
a general crackdown." said Kang Nin-
Hsiang. an elected legislator and one of
the few opposition leaders still free.
Charges of political repression enrage
Taiwan officials and security men, who
insist they are merely trying to bring to
justice the individuals responsible for the
unauthorized rally at Kaohsiung and for
violent clashes afterward in which I S3
policemen were allegedly injured.
The rally was called ostensibly to celeb
rate U.N. Human Rights Day. but Maj.
Gen. Hsu Mei-ling of the Garrison Corn
mans, the investigating agency, said that
the evidence produced so far shows that it
was "a well-planned, organized and pre
meditated act of violence."
The attacks on the policemen, who
were under orders not to retaliate, and
one-sided, government-orchestrated
press coverage have turned public feeling
against the demonstrators, even though
skepticism persisted in some places.
Political motive?
"In democratic countries, after an inci
dent like this one, the participants might
be tried for disturbing the peace and
jailed for 30 days," an American
educated Taiwan journalist observed.
"Here they are charged with sedition and
threatened with execution . . . Doesn't

that suggest a political motive?"
Equally disturbing to many Taiwanese
is that several of the most prominent op
position politicians elected to public of
fice on a recent wave of anti-Kuomintang
sentiment have been jailed or banished
from the island.
"Sometimes 1 get the feeling that, as far
as the government is concerned, elections
don't matter, the laws don't matter and
human rights can be dispensed with
whenever it's convenient," said Ching
Yu, the wife of a prominent Taipei
lawyer. Yao Chia-wen. who was arrested
in the government sweep.
"The outcome of these cases really de
pends on the KMT's wishes," Ching said,
"not the courts or the law. The KMT calls
all the shots."
Kumors
Technically, under Taiwan law, the
security agency could detain the suspects
without bringing formal charges until
mid-April. But higher authorities have
reportedly ordered trials in order to dispel
rumors abroad that the government is sys
tematically torturing the dissidents.
No one is more interested in these pro
ceedings than the Carter administration,
which has served notice on the govern
ment of President Chiang Ching-kuo that
unduly harsh sentences could jeopardize
Washington-Taipei ties.
David Dean, chairman of the American
institute in Taiwan, the unofficial agency
that replaced the U.S. Embassy here, has
declined to discuss meetings he held with
relatives of the jailed dissidents and with
top Taiwan officials.
But it is known that Dean warned aides
to Chiang that the considerable support
Taiwan still enjoys in Congress could
evaporate if the opposition is stifled. The
same message was delivered again by a
visiting delegation from a House Interna
tional Relations subcommittee led by

Rep. Lester Wolff (D-N.Y.).
Mistake
"It was made pretty clear that Ameri
cans think the KMT may be on the verge
of making a big mistake," a U.S. official
said.
American concern has been aroused
partly because Taiwan's political turbu
lence is being exported to the United
States.
Congressmen's offices have been pep
pered with letters from Taiwan citizens
living in the United States demanding a
thorough investigation of human right
here. Among the most vocal lobbyists
have been Presbyterian Church elders
concerned that eight of the people in cus
tody here are Presbyterians; five of them
are suspected of sheltering Shih Ming-teh
from the police.
Chinese-American intellectuals have
been so alarmed by the arrests that 27 of
them recently petitioned President
Chiang to show leniency to the dissidents
"for the sake of national unity."
The last impact of the crackdown on
domestic politics here is harder to gauge,
for although the opposition's platform
commanded wide support — non-KMT
candidates captured 37 percent of the
vote in the last local elections — the vio
lence of the Kaohsiung riot alienated
many Taiwanese.
Once the furor quiets down, some ob
servers here expect Chiang to follow up
the crackdown with some easing of re
straints, a zig-zag pattern that has marked
his five years in office. He could steal the
opposition's thunder by rescheduling the
parliamentary elections that were
scheduled for December, 1978 (and can
celed when President Carter recognized
Peking) and by making more seats in the
legislature open to election.
What the 70-year-old Chiang refuses to
do, however, is permit the establishment
of a formal opposition party.
