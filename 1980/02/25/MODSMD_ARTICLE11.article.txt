# Uganda region faces famine
## 
### Bob Deitz The Associated Press 
KAABONG, Uganda — Soon
after sunrise, several hundred
people gather at a Roman
Catholic mission here to receive
the daily handout that keeps
them alive — a small ration of
boiledcornmeal mixed with skim
milk powder.
Children in the group show
signs of advanced starvation —
distended stomachs, pipe-thin
legs and apathy. Ten new starva
tion cases arrive every day at the
mission in northeastern Uganda,
near the borders with Kenya and
Sudan.
A medical assistant steps
around the children to tend to a
woman lying on a concrete floor

and dying of cholera.
Scenes like this are repeated at
missions and clinics across
Karamoja, a vast, cattle-herding
region of dusty plains, thorn
trees and huge granite outcrops.
The area is in its second year of
drought. Rivers are dry and,
away from the missions, hun
dreds of cattle and Karamojong
tribesmen are dying.
Rustlers
And if starvation doesn't kill
them, there is the possibility that
heavily armed cattle rustlers will.
United Nations relief experts,
after a recent five-day tour, re
ported that more than 135,000
persons are starv ing to death in
Karamoja. That's 38 percent of
the region's 350,000 population.
The rest of the people, the U.N.
officials say, need substantial
food aid to stay alive.
On a scale of previous African
famines, the situation is small —
but it is critical.

Ever since British colonial
times, Karamoja has been the
last part of Uganda to receive
attention from the central gov
ernment in Kampala. Rutted,
dirt roads make the region rela
tively inaccessible and the
Karamojong remain largely un
schooled. often naked, semi
nomadic herders.
Years of comparative neglect
were intensified under dictator
Idi Amin and the war that ousted
him a year ago disrupted crop
planting. The new civilian gov
ernment, preoccupied with es
tablishing its authority closer to
Kampala, the capital, has done
little to help.
Outsiders
Aid is being left to outsiders.
Francesco Stirppoli, head of the
World Food Program office in
Kampala, says more than 8000
tons of cornmeal and hundreds
of tons of cooking oil and skim
milk powder are being rushed to
Karamoja.
