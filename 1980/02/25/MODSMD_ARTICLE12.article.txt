JERUSALEM â€” Israel yes
terday withdrew the press ac
creditation of a CBS News repor
ter who broadcast a report, later
denied, that Israel had exploded
an atomic bomb off South Africa
in September.
Dan Raviv, 25, an Israeli
based staffer, filed his story from
Rome to avoid Israeli censor
ship, which requires prior ap
proval for all stories dealing with
military and security matters.
It was the first time since 1969
that a reporter's credentials have
been canceled by Israel due to a
violation of censorship rules.
Raviv's story quoted an Israeli
book, still unpublished, as saying
that Israel, with South Africa's
cooperation, was responsible for
an atomic test last year. A flash,
possibly from a nuclear device,
was detected in September by a
U.S. satellite and remains un
explained.
The Raviv report was denied
in Israel, South Africa, the Un
ited States and by the authors of
the book to which Raviv refer
red. They told the Tel Aviv
newspaper Haarelz that their
book made no mention of the
September incident.

The local CBS bureau had no
comment. Raviv is still in Rome.
/e'ev Chalets, director of the
government press office here,
said that Raviv could return to
Israel it he wishes, "but he can
not represent himself as an
accredited journalist, cannot at
tend events which require press
credentials and cannot avail him
self of services of the public in
formation office."
Chafets said that Raviv's cre
dentials were being revoked not
because his report was erroneous
but because it deliberately viol
ated censorship rules.
The Raviv report may have
hurt Israel with black Africa,
which objects to Israeli coopera
tion with South Africa. Israel is
now involved in delicate talks
with a number of black African
nations about reopening of dip
lomatic relations, which most of
Africa broke in 1973 in solidar
ity with Egypt in the Yom Kip
pur war.
The CBS report broadcast by
Raviv was apparently based on
the manuscript of a book by two
Israeli journalists which is said to
include mention of Israeli-South
African nuclear cooperation.
The book is under review by the
censor at this time.
