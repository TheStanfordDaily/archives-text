# Foreign languages face uncertain fate
## 
### Diann Jackson Staff Writer 
A report recently released by the Presi
dential Commission on Foreign Languages
and International Studies found Americans
extremely incompetent in foreign languages
and called for reinstatement of the foreign
language requirement on the high school and
college level.
In contrast to this nation-wide trend. lan
guages course enrollment here has been in
creasing since the official language require
ment was dropped 1 1 years ago. For exam
ple, over the past five years, first-year en
rollment in Italian has increased 50 percent
to 251, and French first vear 30 percent to
367.
Although no official language require
ment has existed here since 1969, language
courses presently taken at the second-year
level or higher can count toward all three
quarters of the humanities distribution re
quirement.
The newly approved distribution require
ments require that students take one course
in each of seven different curriculum areas,
as well as complete a three-quarter Western
Culture series.
However, no provision has yet been made
for a language requirement. It is unclear if
language courses will count toward one, or
any of the new requirements. Currently, the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(C-US) is in the process of determining
which courses will fulfill the seven different
areas.
But if languages are not included to satisfy
some distribution requirements, will the lan
guage department here be adversely affected
by the change?
Prof. Carolyn Lougee, associate professor
of history and chairman of the C-US, admit
ted that the lack of some kind of language
requirement is an "unresolved question."

She noted, "There was not even any kind of
encouragement made for language study
within the new requirements."
Yet, Lougee said, "This in noway says that
we want to discourage interest in languages."
She said that the reason the C-US chose not
to include a foreign language requirement
within the new requirements was because
"we felt it might jeopardize the initial step of
getting any new, more specific, distribution
requirements passed through the (Faculty)
Senate at all."
The new format involves 10 quarters ot
distribution requirements, instead ot the
previous nine quarters. According to
Lougee, to have included language as one ot
the seven new categories would not have ac
complished anything, as one quarter ot lan
guage study would not give students the un
derstanding or proficiency implied hy a lan
guage requirement.
Lougee personally has been interested in
reinstatement ot some type of language re
quirement for a long time. She predicts that
discussion on a language competency/
proficiency requirement will probably begin
in the spring, with a proposal brought to the
[ acuity Senate by next fall.
Lougee favors a proficiency requirement
since it would not necessarily need to be met
through course requirements. Essentially,
students could gain language competency
through high school, during summer vaca
tions, overseas studies, or many other pos
sibilities.
John Barson, adjunct professor and direc
tor of the French language program, said it is
"to premature" to tell what effects the new
requirements will have upon the department,
but he believes that the enrollment "would
not radically change."
After the first distribution requirement;,
were set two years ago, a significant drop in
enrollment occurred in the French Depart

ment. but its language enrollment has now
leveled off.
Barson says the study of a language must
be integrated within the curriculum at Stan
ford. He also believes a language proficiency
would be possibly the most feasible answer to
a language requirement. He noted that "the
study of a language is indispensible and in
separable from a quality liberal arts educa
tion. Language," he added, "teaches stu
dents to write and is a release of creative
energy and imagination."
Prof. Ralph Hester, chairman of the
French Department, fears that with the new
distribution requirements, students may be
come requirement conscious. But he said
that for "cultural, humanistic and interna
tional reasons," a language requirement or
proficiency requirement might be beneficial.
At the same time, Hester remarked that the
current enrollment in French is proportion
ally equal to the enrollment before the lan
guage requirement was dropped at Stanford
in 1969.
1 lester is one of only two full professors at
Stanford to teach a first-year language class.
He commented that, "Although the tirst
year courses are excluded from the
humanities distribution requirements, they
are very, very humanistic."
German Prof. Walter Lohnes is the other
full professor to teach a first-year language
class at Stanford. Lohnes said he hopes ulti
mately for a language proficiency require
ment. He called language "a basic human
concern."
Overall, the language program here is very
strong. Nearly 30 percent of the student body
participates in the overseas programs. Peggy
Blumenthal, assistant director of overseas
studies, said that "many students start lan
guage programs to go overseas, but by the
same means, strong language courses en
courage students to go overseas."
