# Plastic surgery is everyday event
## 
### Richard Shames Staff Writer 
Ernest Kaplan, an associate
professor of surgery here, told
the story of the hoy, who was so
ashamedof an unsightly birth de
fect, that he chose to wear a hag
over his head in public. Years
ago, such defects would have so
cially imprisoned an unfortunate
child for his entire life. Today,
however, sweeping advances in
the field of reconstructive
surgery have helped to restore
form and function to even the
most grotesque defects.
Speaking before an audience
at the Med Center Tuesday
night, Kaplan and Asst. Surgery
Prof. Vincent Hentz explained

how abnormal limbs, facial lea
tures and even forms of cancer
and tumors are now almost
routinely repaired by surgical
techniques.
According to Hentz, although
this repair has become com
monplace, surgeons in the field
still have to battle the bad label
that plastic surgery has been
given in the past. "The public has
an image of plastic surgery only
as an aesthetic surgery," he said.
"But plastic surgeons are trained
more in the area ol repair and
restoration of abnormal func
tions."
Part of the problem, he said, is
that plastic surgery is not re
stricted to a particular body area.

It should be considered more as
an "attitude or approach to an
abnormality, based on preserv
ing and restoring function."
Birth defects
Along this line, Hentz stated
that birth delects require more
than immediate surgery. One out
of six children is born with some
delect in his limbs, such as ab
sence of parts or overabundance
ol parts. The surgeon must first
consult the parents to help shed
the onus ol parental guilt that is
normally unavoidable. He may
then provide sympathetic but
realistic information about the

treatment.
Such defects as abnormally
fused parts may then be treated
by separation and skin grafts to
cover exposed areas. In the case
of absent parts such as a missing
thumb, an index finger may be
strategically moved to cover for
the absence. Occasionally the
displaced index linger may be
immediately incorporated into
neuromuscular vessels and can in
effect serve as a functional
thumb.
Other birth delects such as
tumors may often he treated by
reconstructive surgery. Although
some tumors have a natural re
gression and disappear over
time, others must be treated by
surgical intervention, lor this
reason, each case must be care
fully diagnosed, because the
worst mistake may be to perform
unnecessary, and often painful,
treatment.
Accident victims
A major area for reconstruc
tive surgery is in the treatment of
traumatic events. According to
Hentz, the total cost in disability
payments lor upper limb injuries
last year amounted to some $10
billion.
Surgical treatments for such
accidents now routinely include
the transfer ol body tissues from
one part ol the body to the dam
aged part. Hentz cited the case ol
a machinist who lost a portion of
the back of his arm, and with it,
he lost the ability to move his
lingers. Treatment involved the

transplating of a large hack mus
clc to the arm. The blood vessels
were sewn together and the lin
gers were able to move again.
I'erhaps the most dramatic ad
vances in the held involve the
implantation ol solid silicon to
simulate body parts. Certain
plastic "bioplantable" mate
rials may be used, lorexample, in
place ol non-lunctional joints in
the knuckles. T he flexible silicon
compound may be inserted into
the joint to allow near-normal
movement of the joints.
Collagen uses
An artificial material that is
currently receiving a lot of atten
tion is the protein collagen. Col
lagen is injected under the skin
to repair sunken facility areas
due to serious acne conditions.
Once under the skin, collagen
polymerizes and is able to fill out
the sunken area.
Collagen treatments have re
placed older silicon methods
which often produced complica
tions. Silicon, in fact, as an injec
tible material has recently been
taken oil the market due to its
adverse effects.
C'ollagen's greatest blessing
may be in its widespread accep
tance by the human body. Colla
gen may he transplanted from
one person to another and even
in some cases from an animal to a
human, with no damaging ef
fects. For instance, calf collagen
lias been used as an artificial
material in humans.
Collagen treatments are still
being perfected, and the future

may hold great potential. It is
currently being looked into as a
method for breast reconstruction
following mastectomy.
Although plastic surgery has
made large strides, I lent/ warns
that not everyone may be a can
didate lor reconstructive
surgery. There is the case of the
waiter born with a double thumb
who refused plastic surgery. His
defect allows him to work extra
tables and clear extra tips in the
process.
