# Prof unionization denied by Court
## 
### Jim Mann The Los Angeles Times 
The Supreme Court put a se
vere crimp in the efforts of col
lege teachers to organize labor
unions, holding 5-4 last Wed
nesday that faculty members at
private universities generally are
management personnel outside
the coverage of federal labor
laws.
Ruling in a case involving
Yeshiva University in New York
City, the court said that the loyal
ties of full-time university pro
fessors might be impermissibly

divided between their school and
their union it they were permit
ted to engage in collective bar
gaining.
Over the past decade, at least
SO private colleges and univer
sities have negotiated with labor
unions representing faculty
members. The court's decision
seemed likely to curb this trend
and may signal the end of some
existing labor unions on college
campuses.
The primary issue before the
court in the Yeshiva case was a
fundamental one: who runs a
university? Organizations repre
senting college teachers con
tended that a university was gov -
erned by its administration or
board of trustees. The univer
sities said many of the key policy
decisions were made by faculty
members.
The court's five-man majority
sided with the universities.
"Their (faculty members') au
thority in academic matters is ab
solute," Justice Lewis Powell
wrote. ". . . to the extent the in
dustrial analogy applies, the fa
culty determines within each
school the product to be pro
duced, the terms upon which it
will be offered and the customers
and who will be served."
The court's decision did not
apply to public colleges or uni
versities. Federal labor laws do
not cover public employers, and
as a result, it is up to individual
states to decide whether to allow
faculty members to form unions
at colleges and universities
within their borders.
The decision Wednesday,
NLRB vs. Yeshiva, 78-857, 78-
997. left the door open for col
lective bargaining in those cases
where faculty members do not
engage in policy-making for
their universities.
But under the standards set
down by the Supreme Court in
the Yeshiva case, few it any uni
versity faculties in the United
States would be able to meet this
test. The court decided that the
Yeshiva professors help govern
the university because ol their
role in academic decision
making, a role similar to that
played by most other university
faculties.
