### Lisa Adler Staff Writer 
Marching to the tune of Holly Near's
song. "Fight Back" approximately 50
people left the Women's Center here
Friday night in a solidarity march. As
part ol the activities tor Women's
Week, the march was designed to pro
mote awareness about rape and vio
lence aimed at women.
The group, made up ol men and
women holding candles and shouting
various chants, marched at 9:30 p.m.
from the Women's Center down Es
condido Road to Harvard Street. The
procession continued down College to
Bowdoin past the Wilbur and Stern
complexes and headed tor the frater
nity houses.
The "people unite- take back the
night'" theme was chanted by the mar
chers through College Terrace, an area
adjacent to the campus where lour
women ha\e been raped in*the past
year.
The rapist, known as the "College
Terrace Rapist."' selected houses
where women were home alone, cut
the telephone wires and attacked and
raped the woman.
Upon reaching the College Terrace
area, the marchers gathered in a circle
and each gave reasons lor his or her
participation in the march.
" I hope he — the rapist — is listening
right now! Many ol my friends ha\e
been raped and frankly I'm afraid. I
came on the march to feel safe walkinii

through here. Only with numbers are
we going to get anything done. We
must unite to take back the night." said
one woman.
Other reasons cited centered mainly
on that element of fear. "I'm sick with
fear; I don't sleep with the windows
open any more. Thirty-five nights I
have stayed awake during the hours
from one to five in the morning, those
hours that the rapist attacks his victims.
I put a desk in front of my door, but I
can never really feel at home in my own
home." said another woman.
The recent attack near Rinconada 111
the Wilbur complex has increased this
tear and forced many women to "seek
out Iriends to escort each other to the
library," said one participant in the
march. Women should have the right to
go to the library until midnight or stay
at a lab until deemed necessary to com
plete her work and not feel threatened
to walk back to her residence, said
another.
"We, women, all live our lives in
constant fear. Of course, we always as
sume that the other person will be
raped and that it will never happen to
us. Nevertheless, that fear is always
there." another woman stated.
Reflecting on her childhood, one
woman pointed out that her brothers
could go anywhere without worrying
about being raped while her life was
restricted: her parents assigned cur
fews and made her call frequently be

cause they. too. were frightened tor the
welfare of their daughter.
The men who participated also ex
pressed their \ iews. "I simply do not
support this insanity — rape. One halt
of the world has to fear it. There are
things that I can do." stated one man.
"We have a responsibility to take care
ot each other. We certainly cannot
lease it up to the police. They can't do it
all. We must he responsible and unite,"
said another.
According to senior Nancy Lindborg,
the march was an important way of
showing in a symbolic way that "we are
scared."
