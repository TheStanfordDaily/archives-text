## Abandon two-party system 
### 
Historian T.S. Kuhn once
pointed out that bad ideas are
rejected siniplv because they are
known to be false or inadequate;
a had idea is only displaced when
a better idea, more coherent and
more in tune with reality, is put
forward as an alternative.
Rutin's insight applies nicely
to the current American political
party system.
The utter inadequacy of the
current "two-party" system has
been obvious for at least a de
cade: a system which places a
Richard Nixon or a Jimmy Car
ter in the White House is no way
to run a country.
The electorate has tolerated
the tragically comical absurdities
of Democratic-Republican poli
tics simply because voters per
ceived no viable alternative.
Howev er. Americans are now
being offered an escape from the
current political cul-de-sac by a
rising political force — the Liber
tarian Party.
Historically, third parties in
America — T. Roosevelt's Bull
Moosers, La Follette's Progres
sives, the Prohibition Party,
George Wallace's American In
dependent Party, etc. — have
generally been one-candidate or
one-issue affairs which faded
into irrelevance once their can
didate or issue had receded into
the dusk of history.
The Libertarians differ from
such earlier third-party attempts
because the Libertarian Party is
not tied to any single issue or to
any single charismatic candidate.
The core principle of the
Libertarian Party is an unyield
ing opposition to any attempt to
force a person to accept or work
for values, goals, morals or ideas
which he or she has not freely
accepted.
This over-arching dedication to
individual autonomy and social
pluralism determines the Liber
tarian positions on the multitude
of contemporary issues: opposi
tion to the draft and to military
adventurism; opposition to all
forms of taxation; support for
total freedom of immigration
into the United States; opposi
tion to all laws against victimless
crimes; opposition to
gov ernment-created monopolies
(such as public utilities posses
sing government-granted franch
ises) and government-created

economic privileges (subsidies,
tariffs and import quotas,
government-guaranteed loans,
etc.); support for clear and ob
jective laws which prohibit pollu
tion. consumer fraud, etc.; and
opposition to any government
regulation of voluntary
economic activities.
The Libertarians' unique ap
proach to political reality, strik
ingly different from both the typ
ical "third party" approach and
the conventional Republican-
Democratic approach, is begin
ning to bear fruit.
In California in 1 1 iberta
rian Ed Clark garnered over a
third of a million votes — the
best showing by a third-party
candidate for governor iti
California in three decades.
Clark recently won the Liber
tarian nomination for president.
Naive extrapolation of past
trends suggests that he could
achieve 10 percent of the na
tional vote: his campaign is aim
ing at a less naive, more cautious

figure of several percent.
In California. Libertarians re
cently earned permanent ballot
status; they will therefore be
running a broad slate of local,
state, and national candidates in
November — including two
members of the Stanford com
munity.
Of course, the Libertarians'
goal of a three-party system is
still, at present, an aspiration;
the reigning Democratic/
Republican political monopoly is
not yet broken.
However, if the Libertarians
can sustain over the coming de
cade evenone-third of the steady
growth rate that they have shown
since their party's inception, they
will easily be the national major
ity party by I^9o.
Tlius, while the existing two
party system is certainly not yet
dead, it just may be that its
executioner has arrived on the
scene.

been obvious for at least a de
cade: a system which places a
Richard Nixon or a Jimmy Car
ter in the White House is no way
to run a country.
The electorate has tolerated
the tragically comical absurdities
of Democratic-Republican poli
tics simply because voters per
ceived no viable alternative.
Howev er. Americans are now
being offered an escape from the
current political cul-de-sac by a
rising political force — the Liber
tarian Party.
Historically, third parties in
America — T. Roosevelt's Bull
Moosers, La Follette's Progres
sives, the Prohibition Party,
George Wallace's American In
dependent Party, etc. — have
generally been one-candidate or
one-issue affairs which faded
into irrelevance once their can
didate or issue had receded into
the dusk of history.
The Libertarians differ from
such earlier third-party attempts
because the Libertarian Party is
not tied to any single issue or to
any single charismatic candidate.
The core principle of the
Libertarian Party is an unyield
ing opposition to any attempt to
force a person to accept or work
for values, goals, morals or ideas
which he or she has not freely
accepted.
This over-arching dedication to
individual autonomy and social
pluralism determines the Liber
tarian positions on the multitude
of contemporary issues: opposi
tion to the draft and to military
adventurism; opposition to all
forms of taxation; support for
total freedom of immigration
into the United States; opposi
tion to all laws against victimless
crimes; opposition to
gov ernment-created monopolies
(such as public utilities posses
sing government-granted franch
ises) and government-created

economic privileges (subsidies,
tariffs and import quotas,
government-guaranteed loans,
etc.); support for clear and ob
jective laws which prohibit pollu
tion. consumer fraud, etc.; and
opposition to any government
regulation of voluntary
economic activities.
The Libertarians' unique ap
proach to political reality, strik
ingly different from both the typ
ical "third party" approach and
the conventional Republican-
Democratic approach, is begin
ning to bear fruit.
In California in 1 1 iberta
rian Ed Clark garnered over a
third of a million votes — the
best showing by a third-party
candidate for governor iti
California in three decades.
Clark recently won the Liber
tarian nomination for president.
Naive extrapolation of past
trends suggests that he could
achieve 10 percent of the na
tional vote: his campaign is aim
ing at a less naive, more cautious

figure of several percent.
In California. Libertarians re
cently earned permanent ballot
status; they will therefore be
running a broad slate of local,
state, and national candidates in
November — including two
members of the Stanford com
munity.
Of course, the Libertarians'
goal of a three-party system is
still, at present, an aspiration;
the reigning Democratic/
Republican political monopoly is
not yet broken.
However, if the Libertarians
can sustain over the coming de
cade evenone-third of the steady
growth rate that they have shown
since their party's inception, they
will easily be the national major
ity party by I^9o.
Tlius, while the existing two
party system is certainly not yet
dead, it just may be that its
executioner has arrived on the
scene.
