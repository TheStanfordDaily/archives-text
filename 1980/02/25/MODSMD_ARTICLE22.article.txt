Repudiate senate
Last fall. we. the Associated
Students of Stanford University
(ASSU) elected twenty of our
peers to the ASSU Senate. We
distinguished one candidate
from another, not by their per
sonal political ideologies, but by
their positions on such issues as
lighted tennis courts and parties
during winter quarter.
Last Wednesday, eight of
those senators manipulated us in
a way that discredits them and
undermines the integrity of our

student government.
At the last senate meeting, the
following resolution was passed
by an 8-7 margin: "Whereas we
as senators should act as leaders
ot student opinion in the absence
of a clear student consensus,
therefore be it resolved that the
ASSU Senate opposed President
Carter's proposed legislation for
registration."
This paragraph is so mislead
ing that we must ask ourselves if
it is not intentionally fraudulent.
Can we believe that the design

of this resolution was to "lead"
student opinion here? That
would he ridiculous. These
senators were not elected for
their political sagacity, but for
their stands on campus issues.
My opinion on something so
profoundly important as draft
registration would not he swayed
by a one-line pronouncement
trom eight ASSU senators. And
I doubt that the opinion of any
self-respecting Stanford student
would be. either. After all. who
are these senators, and what spe
cial knowledge do they have?
No. the apparent design of this
resolution was to achieve an ut
terly different end from the
stated goal of "leading" student
opinion.
This proposal, despite its ini
tial clause about unclear student
consensus, will be cited as a rep
resentation of Stanford student
body opinion. That is the way
statements like this are used by
the media and by politicians.
And I feel certain that the
senators who drafted and sup
ported this resolution were
aware of that potential.
It was no coincidence that
Council of Presidents member
Laura Mead called on the senate
to give her a resolution which she
could take to Washington to
support her own anti-registration
position.
This is how we have been man
ipulated. And it is up to us to
repudiate the action of these
senators. We must call for the
retraction of their resolution on
the grounds that it will be — and
probably already has been —
misused, and we must make that
call now.

Stamp out red ants
Wednesday's letter (Daily,
Feb. 20) from ants representing
the Ants for Libertarianism Co
alition of Insect Organizations
(AFL-CIO), who claimed re
sponsibility for the recent head
crash at LOTS, is obviously a
fraud. These ants are only using
the unions as a cover and recruit
ing ground. In actuality they are
diabolical agents of an interna
tional movement. Yes, it's true
— they are red ants.
History tells us that red ants,
posing as stowaways on South
American cargo ships, first
sneaked into this country after
Sen. Joe McCarthy was purged,
and spread with the develop
ment of the so-called "civil
rights" movement.
Since then they have im
plemented their sinister mon

grelization plan so successfully
that today there is not a white ant
left! And as for the Christian ants
. . I'll spare the readers the grue
some details. But we all know
where the money came from.
Wake up, America, before it is
too late! Stamp out the interna
tional communist conspiracy!
Wear flat-soled shoes!
Don't believe their story about
ants taking so long to type their
demands. It wasn't the typing
that took so long, but the transla
tion, for as every fool knows,
ants cannot read English. Obvi
ously they found a human ac
complice to translate the original
Cyrillic. I hereby recommend
that all members of the Slavic
Department be put under con
stant surveillance.
How will we eliminate them?
Short of nuclear confrontation,
the only long-term solution I see
is to drench them in Malathion.

Ants, too, have to drink some
time. Repeal pesticide-control
laws! Turn every stream into a
sewer! In the meantime, don't
accede to their terrorist de
mands. No entomology depart
ment! No food service! No fee
assessment! No draft exemption!
No ant crosswalks! Doubtless a
few innocent computer science
students will have to suffer, but it
is the price we have to pay for
preserving (in 5 percent Malath
ion) Mom, apple pie, and the
American Way.

Harrassment untrue
The recent complaints against
Jews for Jesus in the Daily is un
fair. And the allegation that we
are harrassing the Stanford
Jewish Community is untrue.
We have sought to extend our
selves to those people (our own
and Gentiles alike) who might be
interested in knowing more

about the Jewish Messiah. We
have always offered ourselves
and our message for anyone to
freely receive or reject as they
will.
As Jewish followers of Jesus
we are exercising a freedom fun
damental to this country — the
free exercise of speech and the
practice of our faith.
