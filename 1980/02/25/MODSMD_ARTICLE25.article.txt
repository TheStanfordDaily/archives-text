## Help male feminists play the game 
### 
It's not that you just can't win
— sometimes you can't even get
in the game.
So goes my struggle to become
a feminist. Like any reasonable
person, I want to participate, but
I haven't yet learned all the rules.
Whenever I try to combat
sexism, 1 seem to jumble the bat
tle plan.
1 try not to be discouraged,
though. After all, 1 did learn the
first rule of feminism: "feminist"
is not a nasty word, but rather a
very positive term that applies to
both men and women. But that
was easy.
As soon as 1 moved on to more
complex issues, 1 encountered
the emotional Big Three for
male feminists: anxiety, frustra
tion and guilt. When I tried to

raise my consciousness and in
crease my awareness of feminists
concerns, 1 only seemed to in
crease my frustration and
heighten anxieties over my ina
bility to do the right thing in the
right situation.
I ask you, when and how does
a man open a door for a woman
these days without having it
slammed in his face? Try answer
ing that one without getting anx
ious the next time you encounter
a very large door.
Must I forgo the taste of my
favorite imported beer if its
American distributor uses sexist
advertising? If so, then I call this
a heavy dose of frustration.
The play on guilt is the best.
That's where you prove your in

nermost motives in an attempt to
uproot any latent sexism lurking
in the darkest corners of your
psyche. When 1 occasionally pick
up a Playboy magazine, 1 ask
myself if I do so because 1 really
want to read the interview of the
month — or do I read the inter
view just to help ease my guilt for
having glanced through the
"photo essay" of the month?

If you want an example of anx
iety, frustration and guilt all rol
led into one, think of the last
time you hesitated to pick up the
dinner check on a fine evening
out. Didn't you feel the anxiety
building as you wondered if you
were paying for both meals, fol
lowed by the frustrating thought
of paying $8.95 for a meager sir
loin, then the guilt from realizing
that she's putting it on her
VISA?
All this anxiety, frustration,
and guilt can do funny things to
your mind. In some of my more
paranoid moments, I wonder if
feminist tactics are not born of a
diabolically subtle Machiavel
lianism. One should never unde
restimate the power of a wo
man's deepest convictions, nor
the cunning with which she will
protect and nurture those con
victions.
Here is where I remind myself,
however, that as long as these
convictions are noble — and
feminist convictions are — then
the above qualities are merely
indicators of a healthy backbone.
Which leads me to believe that
we all could benefit from
strengthening and straightening
our backbones. Perhaps then
more people would face up to
some hard issues. It is fact that

our tax laws still regard women
as second-class citizens. It is fact
that our language helps per
petuate sexism. It is fact that the
burden of civil defense falls al
most entirely on men.
No person can abdicate re
sponsibility for the perpetuation
of sexism in our society. How
ever, some people have a greater
responsibility than others.

Seriously, you'd think that a
child of the '60s would by now be
accustomed to the type of radical
social change that marked that
decade. You'd also bet that the
same kid who survived adoles
cence in the '70s would be inti
mately familiar with the
feminism that carried that de
cade. Thus, you'd infer that the
young citizens of the '80s should
be best equipped to purge our
society of sexism.
But feminism hasn't yet
caught like wildfire in the
younger ranks, and this is puzzl
ing. Surely we see that sexism
hurts both sexes, and that
feminism is inherently a
humanistic cause. Maybe our
lack of gung-ho enthusiasm is in
part due to confusion.
Any cause is confusing to the
young if they cannot look to their
elders for guidance, and
feminism is no exception. Ask
yourself why President Carter is
asking young women and men to
register for the draft when we
haven't yet seen passage of the
Equal Rights Amendment
(another broken campaign
promise). I guess he thinks that
women should be second-class
citizens and first-class privates.
That's not only confusing, it's
dangerous! That's sexism.
So, the rules may be ambigu
ous, some of the players dubious,
and the playing field hazardous,
yet the game is noble, 112 eminism
is flowering into a permanent so
cial influence, but it will only
continue if we move beyond the
goal of awareness and into the
realm of practice. And if we are
to achieve this, it must be done
by consensus among the players.
After all, there are no re
ferees.
