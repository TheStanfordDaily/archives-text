## Credit Union serves its members 
### 
A recent letter to the editor (Daily, Feb.
5) on the subject of the Stanford Federal
Credit Union VISA card program de
monstrated that there may be confusion in
the minds of some about the Credit Union
and its services.
Many credit unions today, including your
own Stanford Federal Credit Union, are
multi-million-dollar operations with full
service capabilities and branch offices.
Sophisticated management techniques are
employed and operations are subject to
complicated regulatory procedures. For
these reasons, a credit union may seem to be
just another bank. It's easy to forget that a
credit union is technically a cooperative as
sociation, owned solely by its depositor/
members.
Credit unions are non-stock organizations
in which every member has an equal partner
ship share no matter his or her savings ba
lance. The depositors, through elected offi
cials and committees, actually direct policy
and decide what services will be offered and
what rates will be paid.
Professional management, hired by the
board of directors,, is obliged to implement
these directives in ways that are responsive
both to the member/owners and to the dic
tates of sound fiscal business standards. In
this unique kind of organizational structure,
third-party profiteering is not possible.
There is no one to benefit from the efficient
management of a credit union but the mem
bers themselves.
Credit unions, by charter, really do exist
only to serve the financial needs of a pre
scribed community — in this case the Stan
ford community. Most professional credit
union managers share the belief that in order
to warrant existence at all, a credit union

should fill a banking void and/or meet con
sumer needs not being adequately met by
other banking institutions
For that reason, you'll find that Stanford
Federal Credit Union offers a full range of
basic consumer banking services, but then
adds something special to each service by
way of the cooperative imperative. A regular
savings account at a bank, for example, may
yield only 5V4 percent, and this rate may be
computed either daily, quarterly or monthly.
At Stanford Federal Credit Union, regular
savings yield 6V2 percent, and the rate is
computed daily. Quite a difference. Quite a
benefit.
Another example of how the Credit Union
translates concepts into unique banking ser
vice is the draft account. This is the Credit
Union's version of bank checking — with a
few twists, like 6V2 percent daily on checking
with no service charges and no transaction
fees. And deposits can be made into the ac
count electronically — from your payroll de
partment, from the Social Security Ad
ministration, or from just about anywhere
you regularly receive checks.
And that leads us to the unique charac
teristics and special differences of our VISA
card program. Like all our member services,
our VISA plan was designed to serve a spe
cial member need. It's true that many bank
card users do not carry unpaid balances from
one month to the next. They pay off their
balances and enjoy 25 days "free credit"
each month by way of the grace period.
The bank VISA card programs are usually
a good deal for these members, even if the
bank charges 18 percent. So long as the ba
lance is paid each month, there is no cost to
the members.

The Credit Union's VISA card plan, on
the other hand, was designed to serve two
specific market needs. Our program was de
signed first for that large percentage of bank
card users whp carry balances month to
month and thus derive little or no benefit
from a grace period and who pay 18 percent
on their accounts at the bank.
The Stanford VISA program eliminated
the grace period and reduced the rate to 12
percent. So our members enjoy a 6 percent
benefit. The Stanford Federal Credit Union
VISA card was designed to replace the bank
card used every day by these members.
The other market segment our unique
VISA card plan is designed to serve is made
up of those members who almost never carry
a balance and therefore derive considerable
benefit from a grace period. Our plan en
visioned that these members would continue
to use their IS percent grace period bank
card for everyday use, but they would also
carry the Stanford card for those occasions
when they wanted to charge a major purch
ase and spread the payments over a few
months at a sensible interest rate.
This group would have the best of both
worlds: free credit from their bank VISA
card; and, whenever they needed it, a conve
nient lower rate, in-pocket, ready-access,
major purchase financing vehicle from their
Credit Union.
The Stanford VISA plan was the answer to
special needs. We were confident that each
member would decide which program or
combination of programs would best suit his
or her needs.

The other market segment our unique
VISA card plan is designed to serve is made
up of those members who almost never carry
a balance and therefore derive considerable
benefit from a grace period. Our plan en
visioned that these members would continue
to use their IS percent grace period bank
card for everyday use, but they would also
carry the Stanford card for those occasions
when they wanted to charge a major purch
ase and spread the payments over a few
months at a sensible interest rate.
This group would have the best of both
worlds: free credit from their bank VISA
card; and, whenever they needed it, a conve
nient lower rate, in-pocket, ready-access,
major purchase financing vehicle from their
Credit Union.
The Stanford VISA plan was the answer to
special needs. We were confident that each
member would decide which program or
combination of programs would best suit his
or her needs.

A recent letter to the editor (Daily, Feb.
5) on the subject of the Stanford Federal
Credit Union VISA card program de
monstrated that there may be confusion in
the minds of some about the Credit Union
and its services.
Many credit unions today, including your
own Stanford Federal Credit Union, are
multi-million-dollar operations with full
service capabilities and branch offices.
Sophisticated management techniques are
employed and operations are subject to
complicated regulatory procedures. For
these reasons, a credit union may seem to be
just another bank. It's easy to forget that a
credit union is technically a cooperative as
sociation, owned solely by its depositor/
members.
Credit unions are non-stock organizations
in which every member has an equal partner
ship share no matter his or her savings ba
lance. The depositors, through elected offi
cials and committees, actually direct policy
and decide what services will be offered and
what rates will be paid.
Professional management, hired by the
board of directors,, is obliged to implement
these directives in ways that are responsive
both to the member/owners and to the dic
tates of sound fiscal business standards. In
this unique kind of organizational structure,
third-party profiteering is not possible.
There is no one to benefit from the efficient
management of a credit union but the mem
bers themselves.
Credit unions, by charter, really do exist
only to serve the financial needs of a pre
scribed community — in this case the Stan
ford community. Most professional credit
union managers share the belief that in order
to warrant existence at all, a credit union

should fill a banking void and/or meet con
sumer needs not being adequately met by
other banking institutions
For that reason, you'll find that Stanford
Federal Credit Union offers a full range of
basic consumer banking services, but then
adds something special to each service by
way of the cooperative imperative. A regular
savings account at a bank, for example, may
yield only 5V4 percent, and this rate may be
computed either daily, quarterly or monthly.
At Stanford Federal Credit Union, regular
savings yield 6V2 percent, and the rate is
computed daily. Quite a difference. Quite a
benefit.
Another example of how the Credit Union
translates concepts into unique banking ser
vice is the draft account. This is the Credit
Union's version of bank checking — with a
few twists, like 6V2 percent daily on checking
with no service charges and no transaction
fees. And deposits can be made into the ac
count electronically — from your payroll de
partment, from the Social Security Ad
ministration, or from just about anywhere
you regularly receive checks.
And that leads us to the unique charac
teristics and special differences of our VISA
card program. Like all our member services,
our VISA plan was designed to serve a spe
cial member need. It's true that many bank
card users do not carry unpaid balances from
one month to the next. They pay off their
balances and enjoy 25 days "free credit"
each month by way of the grace period.
The bank VISA card programs are usually
a good deal for these members, even if the
bank charges 18 percent. So long as the ba
lance is paid each month, there is no cost to
the members.

The Credit Union's VISA card plan, on
the other hand, was designed to serve two
specific market needs. Our program was de
signed first for that large percentage of bank
card users whp carry balances month to
month and thus derive little or no benefit
from a grace period and who pay 18 percent
on their accounts at the bank.
The Stanford VISA program eliminated
the grace period and reduced the rate to 12
percent. So our members enjoy a 6 percent
benefit. The Stanford Federal Credit Union
VISA card was designed to replace the bank
card used every day by these members.
