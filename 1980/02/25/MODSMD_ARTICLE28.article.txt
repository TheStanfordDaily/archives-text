# Peasant revolts differ radically
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Peasants are "the dynamite to bring down
the old building" and "typically the decisive
social class" in social revolutions, said Theda
Skocpole, associate professor of sociology at
Harvard and author of States and Social Re
volution. Yet, she contended that the lower
classes usually do not cause a revolution, but
determine its outcome.
As part ol the sociology colloquiem, Skoc
pole spoke to over 100 people in Annenberg
Auditorium last Thursday on "Peasants Re
volts and Revolutionary Change in France,
Russia and China."
"Social revolutions ... have transformed
class structures and dominant ideologies,"
said Skocpole, in defining social revolutions
as"rapid, basic transformations of a society's
state and class structures."
Social revolutions are unique because
"basic changes in social and political struc
ture occur together," rather than separately..
Skocpole said that the generally held im
ages ot revolutions do not provide much in
sight on peasants. These conceptions tend to
treat revolutionary events as instigated by
nationally organized urban classes or one
vanguard leader (such as in the Marxist im
age).
t Local movements
"Peasants act on local levels," she said,
and for non-ideological motives.
"Political dynamics shape peasant revolts
themselves."
Skocpole gave a comparative analysis of
the French Revolution of 17N9, the Russian
Revolution of 1917and the Chinese Revolu
tion of 191 1 to the 19605. "Peasant revolts
against landlords are pivotal," Skocpole said
she assumed. But, "i have not understood
peasant revolts as all of the story."
The breakdown of old state governments
and the consolidation of the new state gov
ernments set the framework of peasant re
volts and revolutions, said Skocpole.
Rural changes
Peasant revolts against the properties of
landlords in France, Russia and China trans

formed class structure in the countryside.
She said that "in France, Russia and China,
possibilities for counterrevolution were re
moved by peasant revolts from below."
These revolts took place because of au
tonomy and solidarity peasant groups and
the relaxation of oppression in France, Rus
sia and China.
"Villages in France were self-governing
under the monarchy for the most part." In
1 7K9, "The monarchy state broke down due
to quarrels among the dominant class," she
said.
"French peasants did not redistribute pri
vate property in the midst of their revolt,"
she added.
Ripe Russia
In Russia the land was periodically redis
tributed. The situation was ripe for revolu
tion "If state oppression ever broke down,"
she said.
In 1917 young men returned armed from
World War I. The Russians were more radi
cal than the French, and"the Russian peas
ants had little respect for individual private
property," Skocpole said.
The result was a " sweeping level ing of land
ownership."
As in France and Russia, China housed
small-holding peasants who paid rent to
landlords. The beginning of the Chinese Re
volution occurred in 1911 with the fall of the
imperial state, she said.
"The regional warlords took over. They
allied with the landlords."
Communist instigation
In the 19405, the Chinese Communist
party, which had been forced out in 1927,
reorganized the peasants and "laid the basis
for revolts," said Skocpole.
"In China (unlike in France and Russia),
peasant revolts came late in the revolutio
nary process."
She said varying forms and timing of peas
ant revolts helped to shape the new regimes.
Peasant revolts in France left private
property intact and made it hard tor rich and
poor peasants to unite. Rich peasants be
came the chief beneficiaries.
"The peasantry lost much of its autonomy

and capitalism eroded its position," she said.
In Russia, "the Bolsheviks had no organi
zational base in the countryside" because
they could not provide economic or political
inducements to the peasants.
With Stalin's regime, "collectivization was
imposed." Fhe peasants were forced to sup
ply their surpluses to the state.
The Chinese used participation rather
than coercion in the collectivization of ag
riculture. "Communists and peasants had
necessarily allied to complete the revolu
tion," Skocpole said.
State represses peasants
"Feasants do not possess political organi
zation and self-conscious ideology on a na
tional scale," she said.
She cited state repression as the most
common cause of failure of peasant revolts.
"History never gives us the control cases
we want," she said. "There are too many
variables and not enough cases."
Iranian revolt
After her lecture, Skocpole said, "1 would
consider Iran to be a social revolution."
Iran differs from France, Russia and
China, however, in that most of the popular
support came from the urban sector and in
that the nation has been historically depen
dent on another country.
"We (the United States) no longer domi
nate the scene," she said. The re
volutionaries are causing the Iranians to be
come obsessed with their autonomy.
"They want their own independent
peoplehood," she said. "The shah's regime
was a client regime of the US."
Knd results
Most revolutions have resulted in more
repressive states rather than in democracy,
she said, adding "I do think the shah's re
gime was repressive, too."
The Iranians feel more national identity in
their autonomous new situation.
"If they're going to unify," she said, she
expects it to center around Moslem
nationalism.
Skocpole's next research subject will be
the social and political changes in the 1930s
as a result of the Depression.
