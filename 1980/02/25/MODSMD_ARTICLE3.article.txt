# NAACP counsel dismisses reverse discrimination
## 
### Robert Reed Staff Writer 
Wrongs whieh were created and per
petuated on a basis of color will not he
solved now by simply becoming col
orblind. according to Nathaniel Colley,
regional counsel tor the National As
sociation tor the Ad\ancement ot Col
ored People (NAACP).
Speaking at the Law School Friday
afternoon, Colley attacked the idea
that affirmative action programs pro
mote "reverse discrimination." He said
that offering blacks simple "equality of
opportunity" now. after having built
U.S. society on racism and discrimina
tion. would still leave blacks at a hand
icap.
"The nature of the problem is race or
color, and unless it is addressed in that
context we are merely tilting at

windmills in the eye of a storm." Colley
said.
"Blacks have been handicapped as a
people by centuries of overt slavery or
racial discrimination," he said, and
"the long term effects of such massive,
stultifying wrongs cannot be ignored
under the false pretext that all that is
needed is theoretical equality of oppor
tunity."
While noting that quota systems are
not ideal and can be put to ill-use. Col
ley supported the idea of using quotas
for blacks in school admissions and job
hirings.
"The quota is a way of quantifying
and guaranteeing black particiption. . .
as opposed to merely affording a
theoretical right.
. "Blacks are not opposed to indi
vidual merit or achievement," Colley

said, refuting the notion that affirma
tive action programs look more at
ethnicity or sex than at the individual
applicant's achievements.
"The nature of the people is such
that no matter what degree ol excel
lence an individual may achieve so long
as racism, religious or sexual bigorty
exist every individual is limited by his
or her circumstance.
"Affirmative action programs attack
discrimination in the same context in
which it arose," Colley said. Instead ol
using color, religion or sex to discrimi
nate, it might now be used to help.
While equality of opportunity might
be held as a high ideal in this country, it
cannot exist until the whole ol society is
changed, Colley explained.
"Equality of opportunity by defini
tion assumes the absence of racism and

sexism." lie said. "The problem in this
country is that racism and sexism have
controlled our thoughts and actions tor
centuries and arc too deeply engrained
in the American body politic and in
stitutions to wishfully assume their
non-existence."
Colley said he was distressed that
"most of the intellectual and financial
support of the war against affirmative
action programs comes from persons
previously identified as liberals."
These are the same people who rallied
with blacks in the '60s lie said.
"Many of them thought that there
would be no more significant problems
once everyone had an 'equal' oppor
tunity to compete.
"The view that equality in theory is
sufficient, however, entirely overlooks
the experience of black people in

America and Jewish people and
women in the whole world," Colley
said.
Since white males still hold virtually
all the positions of power in society.
Colley said, "it defies logic to assert
that when their citadel is challenged
there must be neutrality.
"We ask in that situation: 'Neutrality
on whose side?" "
The problems of racism and sexism
might never be resolved by considering
"every claim ol incidental discrimina
tion by a Bakke or a Weber," Colley
said.
"Discrimination against individual
white males isn't even a minor social
problem," Colley said, particularly
when compared to the racism and
sexism that are so institutionalized in
our society.
