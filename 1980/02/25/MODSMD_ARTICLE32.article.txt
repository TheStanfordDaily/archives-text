# Cards' bubble burst
## Beavers bury Stanford SPORTS 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
The bubble finally burst on the
Stanford basketball team Satur
day night, but then again, no one
expected it to endure all that
poking from the raised "number
one" fingers in Corvallis. The
Cards travelled to Gill Coliseum
this weekend and simply were
outplayed by Oregon State, los
ing 85-57. The Beavers reared
up and showed Stanford exactly
why they're considered one of
the nation's best teams.
The general population of
Corvallis had been spitting to
bacco at bullseye pictures of
Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso
ever since the Cardinals had stal
led and almost beaten the Beav
ers in last month's IS-16 game
on the Farm. Ray Blume, Mark
Radford and the rest of the OSU
squad seemed to have that in
mind, too, as they took the floor
and rendered any plans for a
Stanford slow-down out of the
question. Blume threw in five on
two fast-breaks and Dwayne
Allen scored two as the Beavers
shoved seven unanswered points
in the Cards' faces in the first
four minutes. Stanford just had
no chance to stall.
""We had the same game plan
as we had at Maples against
them," said Dißiaso. "We
wanted to control the tempo of
the game but they got out ahead
too quickly. By scoring so fast,
they established an attitude by
setting their own tempo and we
lost our poise."
What Oregon State did was il
lustrate the vast gap between the
top teams in the Pac-10 and the
bottom teams. The Beavers are
one of, if not the best team in the
United States. Stanford played
reasonably well in the game but a
combination of tight defense,
lightning offense and a vice-like
full court press forced the Cards
to give up the ball too many
times to keep the game close.
After the initial seven-point
Beaver sume, Stanford started to

play a good, tight zone. But
Blume and Radford, OSU's
dynamic duo who each finished
with 23 points, bombed from the
outside. Stanford went point
for-point with them for awhile
but with 10:49 remaining in the
half the Beavers went off and
running for five more un
answered points. OSU stretched
it out to 39-2 1 by the end of the
half.
fhe second half was pretty
much the same story. The only
difference was that Stanford
went man-to-man on defense
and Oregon State got a chance to
display its passing skills. They
slowed the ball down somewhat
and worked it in and out of Stan
lord's defense like neddlework.
Another live-point blasting with
7: IS to go in the game made the
score 73-43
Stanford did not look bad dur
ing the game. In fact, the Cards
made a number of plays that they
couldn't have made a couple of
weeks ago. They've improved
over their winning streak and it
shows in their play. The Cards
didn't look scared as they might
have playing against the
number-four team in the coun
try. They just looked like they
were playing a team somewhere
out of their league. They were
beaten by a much better squad
that was right on top of its game.
And Oregon State is a beauti
ful team to watch. The Beavers
play a type of basketball which is
at the same time fast and delib
erate. They seem to explode into
the game because they can cover
the floor so quickly. On offense
they literally run circles around
the team until someone, usually
Dwayne Allen, is loose running
inside or someone else, usually
Blume or Radford, has an open
shot up top.
"Any basketball purist would
love the way they pass the ball,"
Dißiaso said after the game.
"The way they work the ball and
the way Steve Johnson pivots is a
lost art. They have great quick

ness and they play with unself
ishness. They're not in the
top-10 because they have a lot of
shortcomings."
Their defense, which limited
Kim Belton to 16 points and
which completely shut out Brian
Welch in the first half, was all
over Stanford. Their famous
press had the Cards throwing the
ball everywhere from under the.
scorer's table to right in a
Beaver's fast-breaking hands.
"A defense will break down
with time," said OSU coach
Ralph Miller. "You have to
make them commit. We just try
not to think about the other
team. They're just in the way.
You have to control the situation
with your game. If not, you're
not playing well. 1 tell these guys
that they can go out and take all
the bad shots they want. But then
I give them an education — they
come out and sit on the bench."
