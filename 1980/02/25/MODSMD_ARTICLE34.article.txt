## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
This fall a group of freshmen
will be listed on the Stanford
football roster that weren't sup
posed to be, according to the ex
perts.
While in the midst of a coach
ing transition. Stanford still
managed to attract IX quality
high school recruits to the as
tonishment of many observers.
"It's one of the better groups
of student-athletes we were able
ot attract," remarked Associate
Athletic Director Doug Single.
"To tell the truth, we arc very
surprised at the year we had."
Among the more highly re
cruited athletes who signed
letters-of-intent ot play at the
Farm are tight end Jim Clymer ot
Phillipsburg. New Jersey, and
Eric Mullins, a running back
from Houston. Clymer is a six
foot-four, 230-pound athlete
who is regarded by some to be
the best at his position in the na
tion. He was named All-
America by Scholastic Coach
and Coach and Athlete
magazines for a banner senior
season in which he caught 32
passes for 641 yards and eight
touchdowns.
Head coach Paul Wiggin ex
presses satisfaction with
Clymer's decision. "Virtually
every major school wanted him,
and we feel fortunate that he
chose to attend Stanford. I'm
most impressed with his excep
tional size and speed," Wiggin
previously noted.
Mullins comes from Strake
Jesuit High School where he car
ried the ball 192 times for 1102
yards and 12 touchdowns in his
final year. He earned All-State
honors as running back and has
played on two state champion
ship teams in his prep career.

The year before he had garnered
second team All-State honors at
wide receiver.
Perhaps the most significant
aspect of the recruiting effort
was the fact that Stanford at
tracted linemen and defensive
secondary players. These were
positions that the coaches were
hoping to strengthen
Ten of the recruits are line
men. including five Californians:
offensive tackles Bob Bennet of
Elk Grove and Geoff Bland of
Loyola in Los Angeles; Scott
Carpenter, a two-way tackle at
Corona Del Mar in Newport
Beach; Loyola offensive guard
Jim Miles, and Matt Moran of
Fullerton, who played offensive
and defensive tackle at Servite
High School. Bennet earned
AII-NorCal honors his last year
while Carpenter was named
All-League. Moran received
All-Orange County distinction
at Servite.
An impressive out-of-state
contingent of linemen also
signed to attend Stanford.
Among those who will venture
westward include defensive tack
les Jeff Deaton from St. Cloud,
Minnesota, Kevin Lamar of
Louisville, Kentucky, offensive
tackle Pat Mitchell from Carmel,
Indiana, defensive end Don
Stubblefield of Portland, Ore
gon, and 6-6, 238-pound Mike
Wyman of Reno who was hailed
as the Nevada Lineman of the
Year at offensive tackle. Deaton,
Lamar, Mitchell, and
Stubblefield were recognized as
first team All-State in their re
spective home territories.
The defensive secondary will
most likely be aided considera
bly by the additions of Charles
11 u tchings of Pi nole and Denver
ite Vaughn Williams. Williams
was honored as All-America by

Parade Magazine and Carnation,
and was named first team All-
State tor the past two years.
Hutchings, a 6-4. 200-pound
All-State and AII-NorCal selec
tion in his last two years, pleas
antly surprised Stanford officials
with his decision. As the signing
deadline approached, it ap
peared that Hutchings was
headed for the University of
Washington. It is rumored that
shortly before the signing date
track coach Brooks Johnson had
a talk with the athlete and his
father. At a press conference

given by Washington to an
nounce the signing. Hutchings
stated that he had signed to at
tend Stanford.
The remaining four recruits
will be travelling from out-of
state. John Bergren, a tight end/
linebacker in high school, will be
coming from Notre Dame's
home base of South Bend, In
diana. Linebacker Andy Brooks
and placekicker Mark Harmon
will emigrate from Virginia,
while halfback defensive back
Steve Lemon comes from
Gresham, Oregon.

It luis been speculated that the
recruits to watch for in the fall
will he Clymer, Williams, and
Hutchings. It is difficult to pro
ject how linemen will fare because
they usually take longer to de
velop their skills. Single noted.
While Stanford's prestigious
reputation was undoubtedly one
consideration in the athletes' de
cisions, Single pointed out that
faculty help also played a large
role. "The tremendous support
of the faculty was one of the most
important things in attracting
these athletes' Single said.
