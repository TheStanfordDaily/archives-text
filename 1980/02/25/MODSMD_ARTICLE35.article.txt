## 
### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
Swimming with determination
but little specific preparation,
the men's swim team dropped a
75-58 dual meet to defending
NCAA champion UC-Berkeley
at deGuerre Pool Saturday.
"They just had more horses
than we did," shrugged Card as
sistant coach Stu Corliss. "They
have an international squad. They
scored two men in every event
while we just placed one," he
said, alluding to his team's lack
of depth.
Nonetheless, the Cardinals did
accomplish their stated goals fey
the meet. "I'm excited; we had
some great swims," said head
coach Skip Kenney. "We wanted
to pick up (NCAA) standards,
and that's what we did."
Wade Flemons was the meet's
high scorer, accomplishing a hat
trick with three single victories.
Winning the 100 and 200 yard
backstrokes with characteristic
ease, he surprised Kenney by

pulling out the grueling 400 indi
vidual medley in 4:02.4, a mere
second away from the NCAA
qualifying standard.
Freshman John Simons set a
pool and varsity record, as well
as attaining the NCAA mark,
with a 1:52.4 win in the 200 IM.
He chalked up another NCAA
prerequisite by taking 200
breaststroke honors in 2:05.
Veteran team member Ken
Shilling parallelled Simons'
achievements with "a heck of a
meet." according to Kennedy.
"Shilling was a stud," Corliss ag
reed. The senior made the
NCAA cut-off with a 2:06.5
second-place in the 200 breast
and chopped to a close third in
his fastest time ever and another
NCAA mark in the 200 IM.
Mike Anderson continued to
stun his competition by whipping
to his fastest sprints for the sec
ond consecutive week. Ander
son just missed the NCAA qual
ification as the runner-up to
Cal's Swedish import Pelle llol
mertz in the 200 freestyle

(1:39.6'). Anderson played
bridesmaid again the 100 tree
with a 4(i.5. just a second oft' the
NCAA time.
Craig Spada diminished his
1650 free time to 15:55. "The
guv's ama/ing. He's improved
every single week." Kenney
marvelled. "He's got the most
improved award all locked up,"
Corliss said.
1 reshmen I'hil Ciyori and
Mike Garcia shaved the hair oil
their bodies for this competition
and were rewarding with drama
tic drops in their times. Gyori
finished third in the 200
backstroke in 1:56.5, his first
time to break the two-minute
barrier in that event. Garcia
chopped over seven seconds olt
his 200 breast time.
Marathon man Bari Weick
stroked to victory and set
another NCAA qualifying clock
ing in the 1650 (15:28.6) and
finished a split second behind
Bear coach Nort Thornton's son
Rich in the 500 free.
But Card diver Bryan

McCleve won both the one
meter and three-meter
springboard events by large
margins. Still, he narrowly mis
sed the scores necessary to qual
ify for NCAA competition.
"Bryan has been the real high
point of the year." Shavone con
cluded. "His season was excep
tional physically. He went trom
nothing to become a very good
collegiate diver."
In other diving news, Lisa Ma
riani qualified for the AIAW
championships by taking fourth
out of 30 divers in the one-meter
competition at a pre-qualitying
meet in Albuquerque, New Mex.
last week. "She was excep
tional," said Shavone. â€¢"She beat
a lot of people she's never come
close to before."
Overall, Shavone termed his
women divers' first-year per
formance in such a meet great.
The competition was "probably
the toughest zone qualifying in
the country," he estimated. "We
were really surprised at the abil
itv of the divers there."
