## Card nine sweep 
### Cathy Dickerson Staff Writer 
The Qyd nine may have lost
some valuable playing time dur
ing the past week of rain, but it
hasn't lost its winning know
how.
The Stanford baseball team
took to the field this weekend
alter an 11-day rest and swept a
three-game series from the San
Jose State Spartans to preserve
its unbeaten status in pre-season
play.
The Cardinals edged San Jose
5-4 in 16 innings in the first game
of the Saturday doubleheader
played at San Jose, and posted a
2-1 victory in the seven-inning
nightcap. Sunday, Stanford took
advantage of the error-plagued
Spartan defense and recorded a
9-3 win in a rain-shortened
eight-inning contest at Sunken
Diamond.
The three victories lengthen
the Cards' win streak to 12
games, and with only one game
remaining in pre-season play, it
looks like Stanford may enter
league competition undefeated.
Knowing tough league pitch
ing lies right around the corner,
the San Jose State series proved
to be a good test for the Cardi
nals. According to Stanford's
pitching coach Tom Dunton. the
two starting pitchers Saturday
for San Jose were "two of the
best arms we'll see all season."
San Jose sophomore left
hander Mark Langston and
senior right-hander John Til
lema slowed the fast offensive

pace set by the Cardinals in ear
lier games this year. Langston
limited Stanford to live hits in
6-2/3 innings, allowing Stanford
hatsmen onlv three more hits,
112 inally reliever Kevin McKeon
was pinned with the loss when,
with one out in the 16th, he
walked Cardinal centerfielder
Mike Toothman.
Stealing second, Toothman
moved into scoring position for
first baseman Loring Davies, who
singled him home for the win
ning run.
In the nightcap Saturday,
played under the lights at San
Jose Municipal Stadium, Cardi
nal senior Larry Kuhn went the
distance and was credited with
his second win of the season.
Kuhn gave up only three hits and
one unearned run while striking
out eight Spartans and walking
five.
Tillema allowed seven hits in
his seven-inning stint, but four of
those came in the same inning
and led to Stanford's two runs.
In the top of the fourth Paul
Zuvella led off with a single to
center, but he was tagged out try
ing to stretch it into a double.
The second out of the inning
came when Tillema got Dave
Meier to swing at a third strike.
With two outs. Stanford rallied
to take the lead.
Third baseman Steve
Buechele hit a blooper to right
field that dropped in for a single,
and then advanced to second
when Tillema threw the ball
away trying to keep him close at
first. John Elway then doubled
down the left-field line scoring
Buechele. Davies followed with
a single, bringing Elway home
for the second run.
Sunday, the Cards made up
the single game with San Jose
that was to have been played
Friday afternoon. Brian Mig
nano was on the mound for Stan
ford and pitched 7-1/3 strong in
nings before giving way to re
liever George Lopez. Mignano
scattered seven hits and walked
four batters while striking out
three.
Errors plagued the Spartans
throughout the game — espe
cially in the six-run fourth in
ning. Zuvella, who went two
for-four Sunday, led off the
fourth with a double down the

left field line. Meier then singled
up the middle, scoring Zuvella.
Alter Buechele popped out
for the first out of the inning, a
wild pitch by Tillema moved
Meier from first to third. Catcher
Bill Worden drove Meier home
with a single through the right
side of the infield, and a two
base error on the Spartan
shortstop moved him to third
and put Elway on first.
Designated hitter Dave Dacus
singled Worden home, and then
he and Elway scored on another
costly San Jose error. The sixth
run of the inning came when
Davies was balked home after
reaching first on a walk and mov
ing to third on the error that al
lowed Dacus, who went two
for-three, and Elway to cross the
plate.

The Qyd nine may have lost
some valuable playing time dur
ing the past week of rain, but it
hasn't lost its winning know
how.

took to the field this weekend
alter an 11-day rest and swept a
three-game series from the San
Jose State Spartans to preserve
its unbeaten status in pre-season
play.
The Cardinals edged San Jose
5-4 in 16 innings in the first game

ing lies right around the corner,

best arms we'll see all season."

pace set by the Cardinals in ear
lier games this year. Langston

6-2/3 innings, allowing Stanford
hatsmen onlv three more hits,
112 inally reliever Kevin McKeon
was pinned with the loss when,
with one out in the 16th, he
walked Cardinal centerfielder
Mike Toothman.

singled him home for the win
ning run.
In the nightcap Saturday,
played under the lights at San
Jose Municipal Stadium, Cardi
nal senior Larry Kuhn went the
distance and was credited with
his second win of the season.
Kuhn gave up only three hits and
one unearned run while striking
out eight Spartans and walking
five.
Tillema allowed seven hits in
his seven-inning stint, but four of
those came in the same inning
and led to Stanford's two runs.
In the top of the fourth Paul
Zuvella led off with a single to
center, but he was tagged out try
