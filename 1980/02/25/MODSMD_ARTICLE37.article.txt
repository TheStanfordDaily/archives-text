# Netters win title
## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Stanford set the stage for an
exciting tennis season to come by
winning the 34th annual North
ern California Intercollegiate
Championships. The Cardinals
edged out UC-Berkeley 28-27
to capture the team champion
ship. In addition to the team
championship, Stanford's Tim
Mayotte claimed the singles
crown beating teammate Jeff
Arons in the finals.
It was Mayotte's 6-1, 6-4 win
over Cal's Phil Lenhoff in the
semi-finals which clinched the
victory for Stanford, but it was a
succession of Stanford wins in
head-to-head matches against
Cal which set up the team win.
Showing clutch play in tight spots
and strong overall depth, the
Cards swept six of nine matches
against the Bears.
Trailing 16-18 after Thurs
day's play, Stanford began its
surge sparked by Scott Bondur
ant's tremendous upset victory
over Cal's number one player.

Marty Davis. Bondurant, con
tinually chipping low returns and
angling away volleys, came back
from a 0-3 deficit in the deciding
third set to beat Davis, the sec
ond seed. 2-6. 6-3, 6-3.
Bondurant's victory was
coupled with wins by Peter Re
nnert. Arons and Mayotte to put
Stanford in good position going
into Saturday's play. Mayotte,
showing how devastating his
power game can be, trounced
hard-hitting Dave Couch of San
Jose State 6-1, 6-0. Rennert,
seeded first and playing with a
bad back, demonstrated his
knack for brilliant play in the
clutch, beating Cal's Randy
Nixon 6-4, 7-6. After breaking
Nixon's serve early and holding
on for the first set, Rennert
found himself serving at 5-6 and
down 1-3 facing three set points,
but reeled off seven straight
points including the first four in
the tie breaker, and held on to
take the tie-breaker 5-2.
It was then the sophomore
Arons' turn for the spotlight and
he responded by pulling out a
dramatic 5-7, 7-6, 6-2 victory
over Cal's Yair Wertheinier.
After losing the first set. Arons
was faced with triple match
point, down 2-4 in the second set
tie-breaker, but played three
spectacular serve-volley points
to nab the tie-breaker and spur
the third set win.
Following the singles,
Mayotte-Arons continued their
winning ways in the doubles,
beating Werteimer-Nixon 6-2,
6-4, and Bondurant teamed with
junior Greg Hing to upset Paul
Batten-Nial Brash, San Jose
State's number one doubles
team. However, Stanford's
number one team Rennert-
Bourne lost to Lenhoff-Bauer of
Cal 6-1, 6-4.
Saturday's play started with
Cal still holding a 23-22 edge
over Stanford, but the Cards
were in good position to take the
lead. Once again it was a case of
Rennert squeaking out a close
one, Arons fighting off match
points, and Mayotte simply
over-powering his opponents.
Rennert, playing Cal's Chris
"Slam" Dunk, repeated his 6-4,
7-6 scores, using touch returns,
effective lobs and powerful serv
ing.
Mayotte, playing Bondurant
in the quarter-finals, served and
volleyed his way to a 6-1, 6-4
win. In the semi-finals Mayotte
controlled Lenhoff with his
sharp net play. Overpowering
Lenhoff on his own serve,
Mayotte was able to break
Lenhoffs serve by chipping re
turns and taking the net to cut off
the Berkeley freshman's passing
shots to reach the finals.
In Arons' quarter-final match,
he snatched another victory in
the face of defeat by beating con
sistent Paul Batten of San Jose
State 0-6,6-2, 7-5. Arons, losing
the first seven games of the
match, composed himself in the
second set winning the last four
games. In the third set, Arons
once again fended off two match
points at 4-5, broke Batten's
serve and finished off the
crowd-pleasing match with a
smashing overhead. In the semi
finals, Rennert, team victory al
ready in hand and nursing a sore
back, defaulted to Arons to set
up the Mayotte vs. Arons final.
In the final, Mayotte served
his way to a 6-3 first set lead and
was leading 4-2 in the second set
before Arons went to his miracle
bag and streaked through the last
four games, three of which were
no-ad games. In the final set,
Mayotte, hitting deadly cross
court volleys, picked up his serve
and attacked Arons' second
serve to claim the singles champ
ionship with a 6-3,4-6, 6-2 win.
Mayotte, commenting on his
final victory over his doubles

partner and friend said,"l wasn't
too upset about losing the second
set. Jeff hit the line three times
on no-ad points to win the set
after being down 3-4. In the third
set, I was serving particularly
well. Once I got the break, I fi
gured I could hold on."
The Cards were less fortunate
in the doubles, as the Bears
swept their way to two semi-final
victories to set up an all -
Berkeley final, which was post
poned because of rain. Cal's
number one team of Davis-
Dunk beat Mayotte-Arons in the
top half, while Bondurant-Hing
squandered a 4-2 lead in the
third set in losing a tough one to
Bauer-Lenhoff, 7-5, 2-6, 4-6.
The team victory was certainly
a confidence builder for the bot
tom of Stanford's ladder, which
had lost all three matches against
Cal in the National Indoor
Championships. As Arons
pointed out, "For us to win it
(the national championship) the
bottom three are going to have to
win their share of matches. Our
top three (Rennert, Bourne,
Mayotte) are the best top three
in the NCAAs and they've been
doing their job, but the bottom
three (Siegler, Bondurant,
Arons) have to pull through like
we did this weekend."
Because of the rivalry, Gould
announced that the home match
against Berkeley on April 16 will
include evening matches at
Maples Pavilion, using the same
format as the home matches with
USC and UCLA.

up the Mayotte vs. Arons final.
In the final, Mayotte served
his way to a 6-3 first set lead and
was leading 4-2 in the second set
before Arons went to his miracle
bag and streaked through the last
four games, three of which were
no-ad games. In the final set,
Mayotte, hitting deadly cross
court volleys, picked up his serve
and attacked Arons' second
serve to claim the singles champ
ionship with a 6-3,4-6, 6-2 win.
Mayotte, commenting on his
final victory over his doubles

partner and friend said,"l wasn't
too upset about losing the second
set. Jeff hit the line three times
on no-ad points to win the set
after being down 3-4. In the third
set, I was serving particularly
well. Once I got the break, I fi
gured I could hold on."
The Cards were less fortunate
in the doubles, as the Bears
swept their way to two semi-final
victories to set up an all -
Berkeley final, which was post
poned because of rain. Cal's
number one team of Davis-
Dunk beat Mayotte-Arons in the
top half, while Bondurant-Hing
squandered a 4-2 lead in the
third set in losing a tough one to
Bauer-Lenhoff, 7-5, 2-6, 4-6.
The team victory was certainly
a confidence builder for the bot
tom of Stanford's ladder, which
had lost all three matches against
Cal in the National Indoor
Championships. As Arons
pointed out, "For us to win it
(the national championship) the
bottom three are going to have to
win their share of matches. Our
top three (Rennert, Bourne,
Mayotte) are the best top three
in the NCAAs and they've been
doing their job, but the bottom
three (Siegler, Bondurant,
Arons) have to pull through like
we did this weekend."
Because of the rivalry, Gould
announced that the home match
against Berkeley on April 16 will
include evening matches at
Maples Pavilion, using the same
format as the home matches with
USC and UCLA.
Stanford set the stage for an
exciting tennis season to come by
winning the 34th annual North
ern California Intercollegiate
Championships. The Cardinals
edged out UC-Berkeley 28-27
to capture the team champion
ship. In addition to the team
championship, Stanford's Tim
Mayotte claimed the singles
crown beating teammate Jeff
Arons in the finals.
It was Mayotte's 6-1, 6-4 win
over Cal's Phil Lenhoff in the
semi-finals which clinched the
victory for Stanford, but it was a
succession of Stanford wins in
head-to-head matches against
Cal which set up the team win.
Showing clutch play in tight spots
and strong overall depth, the
Cards swept six of nine matches
against the Bears.
Trailing 16-18 after Thurs
day's play, Stanford began its
surge sparked by Scott Bondur
ant's tremendous upset victory
over Cal's number one player.

Marty Davis. Bondurant, con
tinually chipping low returns and
angling away volleys, came back
from a 0-3 deficit in the deciding
third set to beat Davis, the sec
ond seed. 2-6. 6-3, 6-3.
Bondurant's victory was
coupled with wins by Peter Re
nnert. Arons and Mayotte to put
Stanford in good position going
into Saturday's play. Mayotte,
showing how devastating his
power game can be, trounced
hard-hitting Dave Couch of San
Jose State 6-1, 6-0. Rennert,
seeded first and playing with a
bad back, demonstrated his
knack for brilliant play in the
clutch, beating Cal's Randy
Nixon 6-4, 7-6. After breaking
Nixon's serve early and holding
on for the first set, Rennert
found himself serving at 5-6 and
down 1-3 facing three set points,
but reeled off seven straight
points including the first four in
the tie breaker, and held on to
take the tie-breaker 5-2.
It was then the sophomore
Arons' turn for the spotlight and
he responded by pulling out a
dramatic 5-7, 7-6, 6-2 victory
over Cal's Yair Wertheinier.
After losing the first set. Arons
was faced with triple match
point, down 2-4 in the second set
tie-breaker, but played three
spectacular serve-volley points
to nab the tie-breaker and spur
the third set win.
Following the singles,
Mayotte-Arons continued their
winning ways in the doubles,
beating Werteimer-Nixon 6-2,
6-4, and Bondurant teamed with
junior Greg Hing to upset Paul
Batten-Nial Brash, San Jose
State's number one doubles
team. However, Stanford's
number one team Rennert-
Bourne lost to Lenhoff-Bauer of
Cal 6-1, 6-4.
Saturday's play started with
Cal still holding a 23-22 edge
over Stanford, but the Cards
were in good position to take the
lead. Once again it was a case of
Rennert squeaking out a close
one, Arons fighting off match
points, and Mayotte simply
over-powering his opponents.
Rennert, playing Cal's Chris
"Slam" Dunk, repeated his 6-4,
7-6 scores, using touch returns,
effective lobs and powerful serv
ing.
Mayotte, playing Bondurant
in the quarter-finals, served and
volleyed his way to a 6-1, 6-4
win. In the semi-finals Mayotte
controlled Lenhoff with his
sharp net play. Overpowering
Lenhoff on his own serve,
Mayotte was able to break
Lenhoffs serve by chipping re
turns and taking the net to cut off
the Berkeley freshman's passing
shots to reach the finals.
In Arons' quarter-final match,
he snatched another victory in
the face of defeat by beating con
sistent Paul Batten of San Jose
State 0-6,6-2, 7-5. Arons, losing
the first seven games of the
match, composed himself in the
second set winning the last four
games. In the third set, Arons
once again fended off two match
points at 4-5, broke Batten's
serve and finished off the
crowd-pleasing match with a
smashing overhead. In the semi
finals, Rennert, team victory al
ready in hand and nursing a sore
back, defaulted to Arons to set
up the Mayotte vs. Arons final.
