### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Stanford set the stage for an
exciting tennis season to come by
winning the 34th annual North
ern California Intercollegiate
Championships. The Cardinals
edged out UC-Berkeley 28-27
to capture the team champion
ship. In addition to the team
championship, Stanford's Tim
Mayotte claimed the singles
crown beating teammate Jeff
Arons in the finals.
It was Mayotte's 6-1, 6-4 win
over Cal's Phil Lenhoff in the
semi-finals which clinched the
victory for Stanford, but it was a
succession of Stanford wins in
head-to-head matches against
Cal which set up the team win.
Showing clutch play in tight spots
and strong overall depth, the
Cards swept six of nine matches
against the Bears.
Trailing 16-18 after Thurs
day's play, Stanford began its
surge sparked by Scott Bondur
ant's tremendous upset victory
over Cal's number one player.

Marty Davis. Bondurant, con
tinually chipping low returns and
angling away volleys, came back
from a 0-3 deficit in the deciding
third set to beat Davis, the sec
ond seed. 2-6. 6-3, 6-3.
Bondurant's victory was
coupled with wins by Peter Re
nnert. Arons and Mayotte to put
Stanford in good position going
into Saturday's play. Mayotte,
showing how devastating his
power game can be, trounced
hard-hitting Dave Couch of San
Jose State 6-1, 6-0. Rennert,
seeded first and playing with a
bad back, demonstrated his
knack for brilliant play in the
clutch, beating Cal's Randy
Nixon 6-4, 7-6. After breaking
Nixon's serve early and holding
on for the first set, Rennert
found himself serving at 5-6 and
down 1-3 facing three set points,
but reeled off seven straight
points including the first four in
the tie breaker, and held on to
take the tie-breaker 5-2.
It was then the sophomore
Arons' turn for the spotlight and
he responded by pulling out a
dramatic 5-7, 7-6, 6-2 victory
over Cal's Yair Wertheinier.
After losing the first set. Arons
was faced with triple match
point, down 2-4 in the second set
tie-breaker, but played three
spectacular serve-volley points
to nab the tie-breaker and spur
the third set win.
Following the singles,
Mayotte-Arons continued their
winning ways in the doubles,
beating Werteimer-Nixon 6-2,
6-4, and Bondurant teamed with
junior Greg Hing to upset Paul
Batten-Nial Brash, San Jose
State's number one doubles
team. However, Stanford's
number one team Rennert-
Bourne lost to Lenhoff-Bauer of
Cal 6-1, 6-4.
Saturday's play started with
Cal still holding a 23-22 edge
over Stanford, but the Cards
were in good position to take the
lead. Once again it was a case of
Rennert squeaking out a close
one, Arons fighting off match
points, and Mayotte simply
over-powering his opponents.
Rennert, playing Cal's Chris
"Slam" Dunk, repeated his 6-4,
7-6 scores, using touch returns,
effective lobs and powerful serv
ing.
