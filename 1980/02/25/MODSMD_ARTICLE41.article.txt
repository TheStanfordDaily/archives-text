### Bill Urick Staff Writer 
Facing a tough San Diego
State team and a somewhat less
than tough United States Inter
national University this
weekend, the men's volleyball
team came away with a split. The
San Diego State Aztecs proved
to he the more confident team,
taking Stanford in four games
(15-9, 15-13, 12-15, 14-7). The
Cards bounced back strongly on
Sundav defeating U S 1 U hand
ily (15-4, 15-10, 15-11).
Stanford, however, surprised
them early in the first game by
jumping out to a 5-0 lead. Then
luck turned and with a combina
tion of superb San Diego defense

and general lack of Stanford of
fense it was all San Diego. A/tee
setter Gary Stevenson moved
the ball around well, causing
several one-on-one blocking
situations.
With the absence of Stevenson
in the second game, the Cards
faired better, losing 13-15. Still.
San Diego was a scrapping, hustl
ing team bringing every ball up.
Even with a lew put-aways by
ouside hitter Rod Fletcher and a
superb defense towards the end
of the game, Stanford continued
to make several mistakes, espe
cially net calls.
Coming off the bench in the
third name, hitter Tom Grimes

put in a solid performance.
Blocking and hitting well, he,
along with Cory Brown - who
put the last ball of the game
down — sparked the Cards to a
15-12 victory. San Diego State
regrouped, though, and the
fourth game was dominated by a
much more stable A/tec team.
Sunday saw a turn of events.
This time Stanford was polished.
Through three games coach Fred
Sturm demonstrated the depth
ot the Stanford team by playing
every player in the victory.
Against a rather weak and ex
tremely low-hitting U S I U
team, all three squads fielded in
each game were strong.
With starting setter Kip Fngen

sidelined with a muscle pull. Bob
Dean played the first tut) games
with an all-around excellent per
formance. The entire team
blocked well and served
tough. U SID hit extremely low
and very lew balls went through
the front walls provided by mid
dle blockers Kim Lum and Jack
loxworth. With tough serves by
Stanford, U S I D passed poorly
and suffered a general lack of of
fense losing badly in the first
game, 15-4.
The second game saw an influx
of new Cards, all performing
well. Bob Dean set especially
well and the Card offense looked
very good. Middle blocker Jack
l oxworth blocked several balls
and was consistently in the right
place at the l ight time. Stanford
was well ahead at 13-6 when
they let up a bit and the score
went to 14-10. But loxworth
spiked a set to finish the game.
Jumping oil to a 5-0 lead, the
US I U team stunned a cold
third Stanford team. But good
blocking and good defense
brought the score to 6-5 in Stan
ford's favor. Standout in this
game was middle blocker," Doc
tor R." Mark Reagen, who
blocked superbly and consis
tently "tooled" the opposing
block.
