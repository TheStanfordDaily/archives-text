## 
### Diane Long Staff Writer 
In the second conference
game of the season, the Stanford
women's soccer team downed
UC-Berkeley 3-2. The victory
raises the Cardinals' record to
2-0 in the Northern California
Intercollegiate Women's Soccer
Conference.
Stanford displayed excellent
teamwork, quickly attacking the
Golden Bears with se\ cral offen
sive strikes. Just eight minutes
into the game Nancy Geisse took
the ball down the sidelines, then
passed off to Cindy Shorney at
the top of the goal box for San
lord's first goal.
Shorney scored again nine mi
nutes later on a dri\e down the
center of the field.
California, shocked from an
apparent daze, asserted its home
field advantage on the Astroturl.
Playing gutsy soccer. Cal scored
at the 25-minute mark, bringing
them within a goal of the Cards.

Stanford was unble to take con
trol of the game and the Bears
evened the score at two goals a
piece before halftime.
Tony Igwe, Stanford head
coach, felt that "because of the
two early goals, we slowed down.
Two goals is nothing in a game
like this."
In the second half Stanford
didn't play on the ball, failing to
aggressively take on the Cal
players. Stanford's midfield was
unable to supply the link bet
ween the fullback and forward
lines. The Bear's defense held
Stanford as the Cards repeatedly
tried to score the go-ahead tally.
Stanford's Kris McGarrey
scored the winning goal on a
penalty kick, awarded for trip
ping in front of the goal. Inspired
by the narrow lead. Stanford
contained Cal for the rest of the
match.
Left fullback Sarah Little felt
"we lacked confidence just be

cause they were Berkeley. We
were afraid to make mistakes
against them because they tend
to capitalize on them quickly."
The game conditions were un
usual for the Stanford team. "We
have not trained on Astroturl
nor played at night under lights."
said Igwe. One of the major de
ferences is that a game on As
troturl is much faster paced than
one on grass.


Senior middle blocker Rod Fletcher puts one down despite
two opposing Aztec blockers. Stanford lost to San Diego State
but defeated U S I U in weekend action.
