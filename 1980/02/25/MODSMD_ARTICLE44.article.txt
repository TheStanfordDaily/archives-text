# Gymnasts romp

### Dean Eyre Staff Writer 
Unless there were a disc joc
key running the sound system at
Maples Pavilion, it's hard to im
agine any more records being set
than during F riday's gymnastics
doubleheader.
While playing host to their
counterparts from UC-Davis,
Stanford's men's and women's
gymnastics squads set a dizzying
22 personal and season records
and six school standards in
sweeping their respective com
petition.
Now 6-9 overall, the men's
team put together a season high
total of 256.25 points, ahead of
the Aggies' 243.90 sum. The
final home appearance of Sadao
Hamada's Cardinals also
marked the end of a career be
fore Stanford fans k>r Tad Bos
tick.
Bostick bowed out with style,
leading all entrants in all-around
competition with a career best of
53.35. The three-year letterman
from Airstin, Texas finished
fourth on horse (8.25) and vault
ing (9.30) and captured firsts on
high bar (9.25) and parallel bars
(8.90) and tied teammate Bob
Maganini forthe top spot in tloor
exercise, both with 9.20 scores.
Second in all-around went to
Davis' Chuck Gaylord with
49.50, followed by Cards David
Hyde (48.95) and Jeff Chung
(47.05). Hyde also took fifth on
horse with 7.75 and second on
high bar with 9.15.

Brian Nelson earned a third on
tloor (8.85), Bob Maganini was
third on high bar (9.00) and
freshman Rich Rosen will re
member the final Maples show
ing of 1980 — he took tilth on
high bar (8.75), third on bars
(8.40), second on rings (9.00)
and won the horse event with an
8.80 judging.
Craig Goldman topped the
rings competition with a 9.35
score and Bob Daniel earned a
first for his 9.50 vault.
Even with this strong perfor
mance, Mike Lee's absence was
felt, especially in Stanford's
weaker events, parallel bars and
horse.
"Considering we were without
Mike, we did really well — our
highest score of the season," said
Hamada. "With Mike and this
performance we would have had
260 points against Cal" (the
Golden Bears scored 260.15 at
Maples last week).
Lee has been working out
lightly in practice to get his in
jured wrist back in shape, and
should be able to compete this
week.
Coach Jackie Walker's squad
remained undefeated, posting a
7-0 record, after scoring a new
school best of 140.60 to the Ag
gies' 131.25 total.
"I was impressed— I knew we
were capable ol scoring 140. but
1 didn't think we'd do it in this
meet," Walker said.
Last week. Walker set a team
goal of 138 points and cautioned
the gymnasts about "taking
Davis too lightly."
Karen Hall garnered
top honors in all-around with
36.25 points, a personal and
school record. She also took
third in vaulting (8.85), and won
the bar (9.20), beam (9.10) and
floor (9.10). Hall's bar mark is a
season best while her beam and
floor scores are personal and
school records.
Anne Smith earned second in
all-around with a 35.20 sum, a
personal best. Included in her
all-around performance were a
fourth on floor (8.60). third on
bars (8.90), second on beam
(8.60) and first in vaulting
(9.10), all personal or season
best efforts.
Julie Bledsoe earned third
place in all-around with a 34.40
total and tied Wiggins for fourth
on beam (8.35) and took second
on bars (9.10), all personal bests.
