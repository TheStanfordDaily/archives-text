## USA wins hockey gold 
### Leonard Shapiro The Washington Post 
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — Team America s
coach, Herb Brooks, calls his players "a gang of
people who startled the athletic world. Not just the
hockey world, the athletic win!
And now, the world calls them champions, this
United States Olympic hockey team, a rag-tag
melange of peach-fuzz kids and knockaround
minor leaguers who beat Finland Sunday, 4-2, and
won the hockey gold medal of the 13th Winter
Olympics.
Two days after their staggering 4-3 victory over
the mighty Soviets, America's Team twice rallied
from one-goal deficits against the Finns, scored
three goals in the last period and won Hockey gold
for the United States for the first time since 1 960.
"This is the team of destiny; you can't explain
what's happened here," said defenseman Bill
Baker. "It just happened."
. It happened because Mark Johnson, the son of
the coach of the 1976 team and the man who
scored two goals against the Soviet Union never
stopped digging for the puck, hustling into the cor
ners and rushing down ice.
He assisted on the game-winner, Rob McClana
han's close-in shot at 6:05 of the third period, and
scored his team's final goal — a short-handed goal
— on a backhand rebound of his own shot that gave
the Americans a 4-2 lead with 3:55 left.
It happened because Jim Craig, the American
goalkeeper who started and finished every one of
America's six Olympic victories and one tie, kept
his team close, or ahead, time after time with so
many scintillating saves.
It happened because America's defense man
aged to kill off three third-period penalties, one
only six seconds after the expiration of another just
after the U.S. had taken its first lead of the day. And
during their third penalty the Americans scored a
goal.
And it happened, too, as captain Mike Eruzione
said "because we knew what we had to do, and we
went out and did it. Even before the game, and last
night, too, we talked to each other, and we realized
what was ahead for us.
"We knew if we took the right course, justice
would take care of us."
The Americans started off on the wrong course
yesterday, as they had so often in this two-week
tournament. They found themselves behind, 1-0,
early, on a thundering 40-foot slap shot by Fin
land's Jukka Porvari at 9:20 of the first period.
And when Finland's Mikko Leiononen stuffed a
perfect crossing pass from teammate Kannu
Harapalainen past Craig for a 2-1 lead at 6:30 of
the second, few in the crowd of 8000 could have
been bullish on American gold futures.
In the locker room after the second period, with
his team trailing, 2-1, Brooks said little, according
to defenseman Mike Ramsey. "All he said was that
we've been a third-period team all year. He just
said suck it up and do what you've done all year.
We knew that, and we did it."
Phil Verchota tied it at 2-2 for the United States
when he came down the left side, took a crossing
pass from Dave Christian and shot the puck low
from 10 feet, past flopping Finnish goalie Jorma
Valtonen at 2:25 of the third period.

Two minutes later, many in the crowd began
chanting, "We want gold," and so, obviously, did
the American players.
Christian, whose lather, Billy, played on the
1960 championship team, sent in a long shot that
Valtonen deflected behind the net. Krom there,
Johnson fought oft two J inns and poked the puck
out front to McClanahan, who waited for Voltonen
to go into a split and then drove the puck through
the goalie's legs.
" I just saw him about four to live feet to the right
of the net and he knocked it in," Johnson said.
"Yeah, it was a very big lift for us."
There was a very hig letdown 33 seconds later
when Neal Broten was sent oft for hooking Kari
Eloranta. Over the next two minutes, the Finns got
off five stinging shots on the U.S. goal, all ot them
blocked by Craig or another American.
Craig hardly had time to catch his breath before
the next U.S. penalty six seconds after Broten came
back on the ice. This time. Christian was sent oft tor
tripping Jukka Koskilahti, and once again Finland
had six skaters to five.
And once again, America's defense flustered
and frustrated the Finns, trying desperately to
knock in a tying goal. It never happened.
The final test came with 4:1 5 minutes. This time,
Verchota was called for roughing, a penalty Ram
sey later said "never should have been called, not
for what he did, not at that point in the game."
Czech referee Vladimir Subry ruled that Ver
chota had been a little too physical in disengaging
himself from a headlock at the boards behind the
Finnish net, and sent him off for roughing.
Still nursing that one-goal advantage, the
Americans, incredibly, attacked. They controlled
the puck and didn't allow Finland a shot in the first
30 seconds of the penalty. And then Johnson went
to work again.
A Finnish defender failed to clear the puck from
behind his net, and Steve Christoff threw it out to
Johnson, who shot from 20 feet, pounced on his
rebound and backhanded it past Valtonen for the
clincher with 3:35 to play.
The Americans easily killed off the remaining 80
seconds of the penalty then came close to padding
their margin with 1:50 remaining when three diffe
rent shots clanged off the pipe on a furious assault
on the Finnish net.
As the final five seconds counted down, the
Americans began raising their sticks and celebrat
ing. At the final horn, they swarmed all over Craig,
threw their gloves and sticks into the air and guz
zled champagne all over the ice in sweet celebra
tion.
Later, in the locker room. Vice President Walter
Mondale, who attended the game, offered his per
sonal congratulations and President Jimmy Carter
called on the telephone.
It no longer mattered what happened in the day's
second contest between the Soviet Union and
Sweden, a game the Soviets won, 9-2, for the silver
medal. And when that affair ended, the Americans
came back on the ice one more time to receive their
gold medals at what surely will be remembered as
the most emotional awards ceremonies of these
Olympic Games.

rebound and backhanded it past Valtonen for the
clincher with 3:35 to play.
The Americans easily killed off the remaining 80
seconds of the penalty then came close to padding
their margin with 1:50 remaining when three diffe
rent shots clanged off the pipe on a furious assault
on the Finnish net.
As the final five seconds counted down, the
Americans began raising their sticks and celebrat
ing. At the final horn, they swarmed all over Craig,
threw their gloves and sticks into the air and guz
zled champagne all over the ice in sweet celebra
tion.
Later, in the locker room. Vice President Walter
Mondale, who attended the game, offered his per
sonal congratulations and President Jimmy Carter
called on the telephone.
It no longer mattered what happened in the day's
second contest between the Soviet Union and
Sweden, a game the Soviets won, 9-2, for the silver
medal. And when that affair ended, the Americans
came back on the ice one more time to receive their
gold medals at what surely will be remembered as
the most emotional awards ceremonies of these
Olympic Games.
LAKE PLACID, N.Y. — Team America s
coach, Herb Brooks, calls his players "a gang of
people who startled the athletic world. Not just the
hockey world, the athletic win!
And now, the world calls them champions, this
United States Olympic hockey team, a rag-tag
melange of peach-fuzz kids and knockaround
minor leaguers who beat Finland Sunday, 4-2, and
won the hockey gold medal of the 13th Winter
Olympics.
Two days after their staggering 4-3 victory over
the mighty Soviets, America's Team twice rallied
from one-goal deficits against the Finns, scored
three goals in the last period and won Hockey gold
for the United States for the first time since 1 960.
"This is the team of destiny; you can't explain
what's happened here," said defenseman Bill
Baker. "It just happened."
. It happened because Mark Johnson, the son of
the coach of the 1976 team and the man who
scored two goals against the Soviet Union never
stopped digging for the puck, hustling into the cor
ners and rushing down ice.
He assisted on the game-winner, Rob McClana
han's close-in shot at 6:05 of the third period, and
scored his team's final goal — a short-handed goal
— on a backhand rebound of his own shot that gave
the Americans a 4-2 lead with 3:55 left.
It happened because Jim Craig, the American
goalkeeper who started and finished every one of
America's six Olympic victories and one tie, kept
his team close, or ahead, time after time with so
many scintillating saves.
It happened because America's defense man
aged to kill off three third-period penalties, one
only six seconds after the expiration of another just
after the U.S. had taken its first lead of the day. And
during their third penalty the Americans scored a
goal.
And it happened, too, as captain Mike Eruzione
said "because we knew what we had to do, and we
went out and did it. Even before the game, and last
night, too, we talked to each other, and we realized
what was ahead for us.
"We knew if we took the right course, justice
would take care of us."
The Americans started off on the wrong course
yesterday, as they had so often in this two-week
tournament. They found themselves behind, 1-0,
early, on a thundering 40-foot slap shot by Fin
land's Jukka Porvari at 9:20 of the first period.
And when Finland's Mikko Leiononen stuffed a
perfect crossing pass from teammate Kannu
Harapalainen past Craig for a 2-1 lead at 6:30 of
the second, few in the crowd of 8000 could have
been bullish on American gold futures.
In the locker room after the second period, with
his team trailing, 2-1, Brooks said little, according
to defenseman Mike Ramsey. "All he said was that
we've been a third-period team all year. He just
said suck it up and do what you've done all year.
We knew that, and we did it."
Phil Verchota tied it at 2-2 for the United States
when he came down the left side, took a crossing
pass from Dave Christian and shot the puck low
from 10 feet, past flopping Finnish goalie Jorma
Valtonen at 2:25 of the third period.

Two minutes later, many in the crowd began
chanting, "We want gold," and so, obviously, did
the American players.
Christian, whose lather, Billy, played on the
1960 championship team, sent in a long shot that
Valtonen deflected behind the net. Krom there,
Johnson fought oft two J inns and poked the puck
out front to McClanahan, who waited for Voltonen
to go into a split and then drove the puck through
the goalie's legs.
" I just saw him about four to live feet to the right
of the net and he knocked it in," Johnson said.
"Yeah, it was a very big lift for us."
There was a very hig letdown 33 seconds later
when Neal Broten was sent oft for hooking Kari
Eloranta. Over the next two minutes, the Finns got
off five stinging shots on the U.S. goal, all ot them
blocked by Craig or another American.
Craig hardly had time to catch his breath before
the next U.S. penalty six seconds after Broten came
back on the ice. This time. Christian was sent oft tor
tripping Jukka Koskilahti, and once again Finland
had six skaters to five.
And once again, America's defense flustered
and frustrated the Finns, trying desperately to
knock in a tying goal. It never happened.
The final test came with 4:1 5 minutes. This time,
Verchota was called for roughing, a penalty Ram
sey later said "never should have been called, not
for what he did, not at that point in the game."
Czech referee Vladimir Subry ruled that Ver
chota had been a little too physical in disengaging
himself from a headlock at the boards behind the
Finnish net, and sent him off for roughing.
Still nursing that one-goal advantage, the
Americans, incredibly, attacked. They controlled
the puck and didn't allow Finland a shot in the first
30 seconds of the penalty. And then Johnson went
to work again.
A Finnish defender failed to clear the puck from
behind his net, and Steve Christoff threw it out to
Johnson, who shot from 20 feet, pounced on his
rebound and backhanded it past Valtonen for the
clincher with 3:35 to play.
The Americans easily killed off the remaining 80
