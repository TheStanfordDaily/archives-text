Carter meets with economic advisers
W ASHING TON President Jimmy Carter cut short a
weekend v isii to Camp Dav id yesterday to meet with his top
economic advisers to review the nation's economy. After
wards. several participants at the meeting ruled out the
imposition ol any mandatory wage and price controls to
dampen skyrocketing inflation.
The president's sudden meeting was described In a White
House official as an "accelerated, thorough review" of the
administration's economic policies.
The official, w ho requested anonymity, said no one factor
caused the review, which lasted two hours. He said it was
lelt the latest rises in the Consumer Price Index and in
wholesale prices made it appropriate to reexamine the state
ol the economy.
He said yesterday's meeting was not an emergency ses
sion. and no quick announcement of solutions should be
expected.
"I would not expect to see final decisions coming out of
this review process before next week at the soonest." said
the source. He added it was unlikely there would be a
sudden change in administration policy.
Atter the meeting, one participant said wage and price
controls "can be ruled out flatly." He asked not to be
named.
"Our primary concern tin that issue is that the talk and
speculation and concern about them contributes to infla
tion." he said.
Nuclear plants may spread H-bomb
VIENNA — A two-year international study of ways to
keep nuclear power facilities from being misused to pro\ ide
material for atomic bombs has come to the conclusion that
there is no hope of preventing a rapid increase in the
worldwide availability of "weapons-usable" plutonium.
The linal reports ot the study, to be presented here today
to representatives of more than 50 nations attending the
international nyclear fuel-cycle evaluation (INFCE). fore
east a seven-told jump in the amount of plutonium pro
duced by nuclear power plants — to a total of more than 500
tons — between now and the end of the 1980s.
According to the INFCE study, the plutonium that will
have been turned out by nuclear power plants as part ot

their burned-up tiicl by the end of this decade will thus he
enough tor more than 45,000 bombs.
These reprocessing plants, according to the INFCE
study, will hu\e separated out 11)2 tons of "commercial
grade" plutonium by the end ot this decade. This plutonium
could then be reused as fuel for nuclear power plants. It
could also be diverted for fabrication of atomic weapons.
The study found no hope of developing an advanced fuel
cycle for nuclear reactors that would not produce plutonium
— such as a thorium fuel cycle — that could be available on
a commercial basis until well after the year 2000. The
INFCE technical study concluded, moreover, that from a
non-proliferation viewpoint, a thorium fuel cycle might
have no advantage over plutonium.
Court won't review affirmative action
SACRAMENTO — The 3rd District Court of Appeal
has rejected the University of California's request to recon
sider its ruling which struck down all L'C's preferential
admissions tor minorities.
The appeal court's position, taken on a 2-1 vote Jan. 21
and confirmed by the same vote Wednesday, runs against
the ipparent opinion ol the state Supreme Court.
The decision would go much farther than the U.S. Sup
reme Court's 197N Bakke decision in attacking minority
admissions programs.
In the case in question, white student Glen Deßonde
sought admission to the UC-Dav is law school. The appeals
court ruled that race may not he considered in admissions,
even without quotas.
And the decision struck down a Davis program that
awarded minority applicants "points" that could help offset
lower grades and test scores.
Four days after the original ruling, the state Supreme
Court issued a sharply contrasting decision that upheld the
Sacramento Counts Civil Service Commission's right to
impose racial hiring quotas for then irtuallv all-white district
attorney's office.
Firefighter strike talks at standstill
CHICAGO — Leaders of the firefighters' union, fearful
that local labor leaders have deserted them in their 1 1-day
strike, remained at loggerheads with the city yesterday over

wording of a temporary back-to-work agreement.
The nation's second largest city, with a population of 3.5
million, has been protected by skeleton crews ot non
striking firemen, officers and temporary recruits since Val
entine's Day. when the union struck the 4350-man depart
ment.
Acting fire union president William Reddy, who stepped
in when union president Frank Muscare was jailed for refus
ing to order his men back to work, said he would not submit
a temporary back-to-work agreement to the membership
until the city clarifies its positions on a fact-finding provi
sion and amnesty for strikers and answers questions about a
section requiring firemen to join the union.
The city. for its part, said it would hold no further talks —
even for clarification on the temporary pact — "until there
was action on the agreement," said spokesman William
Griffin.
30 men attack Soviet airline office
PARIS — About 30 young men staged a two-minute
attack yesterday on the Soviet airline Aeroflot's office here,
breaking windows, smashing furniture and computer con
soles and hurling firebombs into the debris, authorities said.
No one was injured in the attack on the office, which was
closed for the weekend, and the fires were put out before
they spread. A lone policeman on guard duty at the time
was unable to stop the assault.
Police in Paris said no group claimed responsibility for
the attack. The letters "COM" were printed on a window
but their significance was not known.
In a telephone call to The Associated Press in New York,
a man claimed that an arm of the Islamic Afghanistan
Revolutionary Council was responsible for the action. He
said he was a spokesman for Ra/i. which he described as an
arm ot the rebel Islamic council operating outside Afghanis
tan against the Soviet incursion in that country.
Police in Paris said they had never heard of Ra/i.
Residents flee flooded lakeside town
LAKE ELSINORE. Calif. — A lake fed by runoff from
more than a week of heavy rain continued to overflow its
banks yesterday, destroying dozens ot homes, trailers and
v eludes and forcing some residents to flee this former resort

community.
I'he Army Corp ol Engineers started clearing an old
overflow channel to handle the runoll through the city ol
Lake Elsinore, a town ol 6000 just north-east ol the lake
and 60 miles southeast ol Ids Angeles, City Manager Ira
Pace said.
As a result, "we're going to lose a good number of our
streets and utilities," he said. But he emphasized that "no
one will he out ot waterorgas other than when we make the
temporary repairs."
Still, the city expects it will cost 52.5 million — equal to its
entire annual budget — to return the community to normal
once the crisis has passed, said Pace, who added that he is
talking to federal, state and county agencies lor financial
assistance.
The lake is rising about I inch an hour and already has
Hooded 70 single-family homes. Pace said. "We have no
idea when the water will recede."
Struthers said he estimated that "well over 100" mobile
homes were damaged or evacuated. I feestimated that 10 to
20 mobile homes and about "20 or so" regular homes had
been destroyed. "But there's no way to keep track of how
many homes have been lost," he said.
Money for interfereon tests to double
NEW YORK — The American Cancer Society, already
the chief U.S. backer of research on interferon, plans to
more than double its support for the natural anti-virus,
anti-cancer drug, the society reported today.
The cancer society said in a statement made available in
advance of its release that it has allocated 53.4 million to
expand preliminary tests of interferon against cancer.
Dr. Saul Ciusberg ol Mount Sinai School of Medicine in
New York, national president, said results so far were
"promising" but more work was needed to prove whether
interferon is useful against cancer.
Interferon — the accent is on the third syllable — is a
natural substance made by cells infected by viruses.
It was named in 1957 by scientists who noticed that it
could interfere with, or block, the infection of adjacent
cells. More recently, scientists have become excited about
its apparent ability to combat some tumors in animals and
possibly also in humans.
