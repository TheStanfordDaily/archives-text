This year's Dollies said hello to
live new Dollies early Saturday
morning when they arrived at about
a.m. to take the winners out to

The ti\e new Dollies are:

Dana Fugelso. sophomore Hillary
Hall, sophomore Dee Dee Justin
and Ireshman Lenita Williamson,
freshman Dina Martine/ was cho
sen as alternate.

The Dollies were selected trom 47
women who tried out. Judging was
held Friday Irom 3 to 6 p.m. 111
Kresge Auditorium. Ahout 100
persons, including Band members,
varsity athletes, and several Univer
sity representatives, rated the
women in lour categories, such as
showmanship, dancing ability and
personality. Based on those scores.
I 1 linalists were chosen to attend a
party that night at the Band Shak.
At the party, the linalists were
interviewed by a panel ol Band

members. According to the new
Dollies, the interviews included
both "011-the-wall" and more seri
ous questions. Sample questions
ranged Irom " What would you do il
you received a box ol condoms in
the mail?" to "Can you handle the
harrassment vou would receive as a
Dolly?"
Hie outgoing Dollies also gave
the Band their"e\pert opinions" on
the contestants, according to Mark
Masterson. assistant Band manager.
Alterward. the Band met until 5:30
a.m. making the tinal selections.

The try-out process actually
began several weeks ago when the
women interested in trying out had
practice sessions to learn two com
petition routines.
The mandatory routines were
pertormed in groups ol three, and
the contestants performed their
own routines individually to A All
Right Now."
According to Fugelso, who also
tried imt two years ago, the try-outs
were "more raspy" this year. "It
was more degrading tor the girls

who were trvmg out." she said. hut
added that she is "ja/./ed" to he one
ol the new Dollies.
Williamson commented that
when the outgoing Dollies came to
get her Saturday morning. "I had
only had an hour's sleep, so I
thought I was still asleep â€” it was
like I was dreaming.
"I still don't believe it." she said.
The new Dollies will officially
take over their responsibilities at
the end ot the school year, but they
will begin practicing next quarter
and debut sometime in the spring.
