# GOP race 'even eve of primary

### Richard Bergholz The Los Angeles Times 
MANCHESTER. N.H. â€” The na
tion's iirst significant direct-vote presi
dential primary tomorrow looks like
this: President Jimmy Carter well in
front on the Democratic side and a clif
fhanger between George Bush and
Ronald Reagan on the GOP side.
A relatively lew New Hampshire
voters, moderates and independents
who ha\e a penchant for unpredictabil
ity. hold the key.
And once again, as has happened so
olten in the last two decades, this tiny
state sets the tone for the long string of
delegate-selecting primaries yet to
come, with political sages reminding
that since 1952 no president has been
elected whp had not won the New
Hampshire primary.
So intense has been the campaign
ing. so much importance is attached to
the results, that there is hardly a resi
dent left who lias not been telephoned
or msited to sound out voting views.
Heated debate
Republicans added spice to tiieir side
by shouting at each other, all because
of a debate between Bush and Reagan
Saturday night trom which the other
(iOP candidates were excluded.
Reagan had agreed to the format but
then changed his mind just before
showtime and demanded that the other
Republican candidates be included in
the debate.
The debate sponsor, the Nashua
Telegraph, insisted on the one-on-one
format and the excluded candidates
yelled at Bush for accepting the spon
sor's decision. Reagan finally accepted
it. too.
Howard Baker was still sputtering
about it yesterday. On NBC's Meet the
Press, the Tennessee senator called
Bush "arrogant" and said."lf he is the
front-runner in this race, he's wearing
his crown without much grace."
Independents
There are only 4N2.4 1 5 voters qual
ified to cast ballots tomorrow. And
bolstering the view that political inde
pendence rates high here, the second
largest "party" is that of the indepen
dents. those who do not want to align
with either the Republicans or Democ
rats but who may want to jump from
party to party at primary time.
