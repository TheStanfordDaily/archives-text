## Iran insists commission not tied to release 
### 
The Associated Press
Members of the I).N. commis
sion in Tehran to investigate the
deposed shah's regime met yes
terday with Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr in talks
described as "extremely construc
tive." but several high-level Ira
nian officials insisted the panel's
work was not tied to the release
of the American hostages.
Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh said. "The release
of the hostages is neither the task
of the commission nor their
program."
Mansour Farhang. Iranian

Ambassador to the United Na
tions. said in a broadcast inter
view in New York,"there was no
linkage between the formation
of the commission and release of
the hostages, it by linkage you
mean a deal. Ayatollah (Ruhol
lah) Khomeini, who has the ul
timate authority over the crisis,
does not make deals."
And Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Nasir O-Sadat
Salami told Western reporters at
a news conference in Tehran that
the five commission members
are in Tehran "to investigate the
shah's crimes, not to see the hos

tages. The two issues are not re
lated at all. We emphasize that
they are separate."
After the meeting with Bani-
Sadr. according to a Tehran
Radio broadcast monitored in
Kuwait, the commission mem
bers issued a statement expres
sing thanks to the president for
assurances of cooperation they
received yesterday and said.
"We will go ahead in carrying
out our mission."
The group earlier had said it
was "greatly encouraged by the
assurances of cooperation" after
meeting with Ghotbzadeh.

But there were no indications
that the panel's inquiry would
lead to freedom tor the approxi
mately 50 American hostages,
who yesterday spent their 1 13th
day in captivity at the U.S. Em
bassy.
One of the commission
members said last week that
there was a "gentlemen's agree
ment" that the hostages would
be freed as a result of their mis
sion. The timing of the release
remained unclear, however.
Also uncertain was whether
the commission members would
be allowed to go to the embassy
to see the hostages.
The foreign ministry spokes
man Salami said "there will be
no plan for the commission to
visit the embassy."
But Samir Sanbar of Lebanon,
speaking for the commission,
read a statement from U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Wal
dheim saying Iran had asked that
the commission interview the
Americans.
Waldheim said on Feb. 20 that
Iranian authorities want the
commission members to talk to
all of the hostages in Tehran.
The Carter administration
signaled its acceptance of the
Iranian demand for a meeting
between the investigators and
hostages but insisted that the
hostages not be interrogated.
The comments by the Iranian
officials seemed to diminish
further the chances that the hos
tages would be released.
Hopes of an early release
faded Saturday when Khomeini,
the all-powerful religious leader,
said the fate of the hostages
would be decided by the Iranian
Parliament. Elections to choose
members of Parliament will not
be completed until April.
Later Saturday, militants hold
ing the U.S. Embassy endorsed
Khomeini's "decision to let the
future Iranian Parliament decide
(the fate of the hostages)" and
pledged: "We will obey the na
tion's will."
