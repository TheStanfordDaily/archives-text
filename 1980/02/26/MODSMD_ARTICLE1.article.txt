# Candidates wind up as N.H. voting starts

### Richard Bergholz The Los Angeles Times 
MANCHESTER, N.H. â€” George
Bush spent yesterday in Texas, Ted
Kennedy spent the day raising money,
and most other presidential candidates
roamed through this snowy state pre
paring for the nation's first major
direct-vote primary today.
Among the seven Republicans on
the ballot. Bush and former California
Gov. Ronald Reagan are rated dead
even in today's test.
President Jimmy Carter, the man
with the biggest pulpit, did his cam
paigning yesterday by entertaining the
victorious U.S. Olympic hockey team
at the White House.
Carter, the odds-on choice to win the
Democratic test, has not campaigned
personally in New Hampshire because,
he said, he has been preoccupied with
events in Iran and Afghanistan, but his
surrogates have combed the state in his
behalf.
Vice President Walter Mondale
spent part of yesterday at St. Anne's
Hall in Berlin in the northern part of
the state, exhorting the Democratic
partisans to join the expected Carter
victory march in today's balloting.
Carter's chief rival, Kennedy, told
Rivier College students in Nashua,
N.H., that he considered himself an
underdog in the primary.
But he said, "Just remember the
U.S. hockey team. They were under
dogs, and they pulled it out, and we're
going to do it tomorrow."
Then Kennedy hustled home to
Massachusetts, and went through a
series of fund-raising events at a
Springfield civic-center rally.
California Gov. Jerry Brown, the
third man in the Democratic battle, ran
through a 12-hour campaign schedule
that took him to a woolen mill, a state
office building, a couple of rallies and
radio interviews.
The 41-year-old governor told re
porters that he thinks the Kennedy
.unnpaign will collapse, that he will in
herit the role of Carter's major oppo
nent and no matter what happens to

day, "I'm goinng to be in as many
(primaries) as I can. Massachusetts
(next Tuesday) is next."
On the Republican side, it was a
study in contrasts by the frontrunners.
Reagan had an 11-hour campaign
day, including a tour of an insurance
company, a college rally, a speech to
service clubs, and a chilly outdoor rally
in the small town of New Boston.
Obviously pepped up from his con
troversy with Bush over Saturday
night's debate, Reagan predicted vic
tory, and when asked how he felt he
said, "I'm going to sleep well tonight."
Bush, a former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, spent Monday at
his home in Houston. His aides hoped
that Bush's absence might quell some
of the lingering controversy with his
fellow-Republicans over his role in
excluding all but Reagan from
Saturday's debate in Nashua. The
debate had been set up by the Nashua
Telegraph and the newspaper
stipulated that it be limited to Reagan
and Bush. However, the Federal
Election Commission ruled the
newspaper could not pay for the event
because of a federal ban on corporate
campaign contributions.
Reagan then decided to pay the bills,
about $3500, and on the day of the
debate invited other GOP candidates
to participate. However, Bush and the
newspaper successfully held out for the
original two-man format. Whether the
squabble would tip even a few votes
away from Bush was disputed by his
pa rtisans.
Another Bush critic. Sen. Howard
Baker of Tennessee, scheduled only a
pep rally with his phone-bank volun
teers here, and a small coffee reception
before knocking off for today's vote.
Former Gov. John Conally of Texas
was reported by his staff to be in
Chicago, having long ago virtually
abandoned his hopes of finishing up
high in today's balloting, preferring to
concentrate on the March 8 South
Carolina primary.
