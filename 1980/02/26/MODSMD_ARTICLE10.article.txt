# Following Khomeini's speech
## Carter seeks to reassure Americans 
### John M. Goshko The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON â€” President
Jimmy Carter insisted Sunday
that "progress is being made" in
jtlie effort to tree the American
hostages in Tehran and
cautioned against going from
"extreme optimism to extreme
pessimism every time some ac
tion is taken or some speech is
made in Iran."
In his first public reaction to
Ayatollah Kuhollah Khomeini's
surprise statement Saturday that
the fate of the hostages will not
be decided until April. Carter
said that "there's no way of tel
ling an exact schedule for their
release.
While the President refused to
go into details, he and other ad
ministration officials mounted a
strenuous effort Sunday night to
reassure the American public
that negotiations with Iran are
still under way and that they arc
hopeful of a successful outcome.
Carter's guarded talk of "very

sensitive and very difficult ef
forts" taking place behind the
scenes came as a I nited Nations
commission met in Iran with
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
and Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotb/adeh. one day after arriv
ing in Tehran. The commission
reported!) was told it would re
cei\e broad cooperation in its in
c|inr\ into Iranian grievances
against the deposed Shah
Mohammed Re/a Pahlavi.
"The work of the U.N. com
mission has nothing to do with
the hostages, so there will be no
plan for the commission to visit
the embassy." a spokesman for
the militant students said, ac
cording to Renter.
These contradictory state
ments coming out of Iran were
cited by administration officials
in warning that the U.S. public
should not leap to hard-and-fast
conclusions over every unex
pected development emanating
from Iran's confused and tumul
tuous internal political situation.

Khomeini, speaking from the
Tehran hospital bed where he is
recuperating from heart trouble,
stunned official Washington
Saturday with his statement that
the hostages would not be freed
until April, because the issue had
to be decided by Iran's parlia
ment. which will not be elected
until then.
rherc was speculation in
I chran Sunday that Khomeini's
surprise statement was an effort
by the powerful religious leader
to reassert his authority after
being largely sidelined by heart
trouble.
According to this line of think
ing. Khomeini's hard-line state
ment. including a harsh attack on
the United States, was intended
to restore a balance between
Bani-Sadr. whose moderate
policies had become dominant i 11
recent days, and the Islamic
militants whose support brought
Khomeini to power.
K ho me i m's an no u nee me lit
did. however, mark a fundamen

tal change that could help re
solve the crisis. Saying that the
parliament, not the militants,
will decide the fate of the hos
tages is likely to strengthen the
hand of Bani-Sadr. who has
sought an early release of the
hostages and who is likely to con
trol the new parliament.
Observers noted that for the
first time Khomeini did not di
rectly link the hostages' release
to the extradition of the shah,
although he repeated Iran's de
mand for his return.
