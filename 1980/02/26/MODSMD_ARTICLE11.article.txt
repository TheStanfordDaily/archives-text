# Visitors find contradictions in Chinese people's freedom

PF.KIN(i — An American scholar who hud en
joyed many long talks with Chinese friends here a
year ago returned to Peking recently When lie
called his friends to arrange a dinner date, lie was
told, with some embarrassment. "Maybe you'd
better go through our otlice first.'
He did as instructed, following the bureaucratic
procedures which he had been told a year ago he
pould dispense with Yet the dinner went fine. The
talk was as li\ ely and re\ealing as before, including
frank complaints from his Chinese friends about
judicial harassment and low standards of li\ing.
* What is going on here?
In the past three months. Chinese authorities
Jiave sharplj restricted public wallposters and
threatened to ban them altogether. They ha\e
tnade some contacts between Chinese and foreig
ners more difficult and discouraged a handful of
Underground editors from publishing unofficial
magazines.
.Yet those same authorities have made little ef
fort to restrain Chinese from talking freely with the
■foreigners they do happen to see. The official press
itsell has become more open about China's prob
lems. even admitting that many people are disil
lusioned with Marxism. Plays, and comic dialogue
lhat lampoon Communist Party excesses are seen
and heard often.
Foreign analysts, who have strained to make
sense of the last two decades of Chinese history,
usually assume such contradictory events indicate
disagreements at the top of Chinese leadership,
and the\ are almost certainly right in this case. But

conversations with both Chinese and foreigners
here reveal great hopes — and in sonic cases even
predictions that this strange sweet-and-sour
Chinese democracy, with some future lapses, is
here to stay.
I he current leadership seems to be trying to
preserve some limits. They want to prohibit direct
criticism ol the top leadership and restrict dissent
to private discussions rather than public wallpos
ters. but let people speak as freely as possible
witin 11 those rules.
This is a confusing and not terribly satisfying
formula to many Chinese intellectuals. The favo
rite Communist Party slogan summing up the pol
icy comes from that devotee of contradictions, the
late Communist Party Chairman Mao Tse-Tung:
"both democracy and centralism, but discipline
and freedom, both unified will and personal ease of
mind."
Mao's words are no clearer to Chinese who care
about free expression than they are to foreigners.
"Which Mao are you quoting' 1 " a Chinese univer
sity student asked when I referred recently to a
remark by Mao. "The 1950s Mao. the 1960s Mao?
He came out on every side of every question."
The current vague formula, however, appears to
be the best the Chinese are going to get. and most
have little choice but to try to get along with it. The
government needs intellectual support to moder
nize the economy. rebuild the universities and rees
tablish contact with the outside world, so it moves
carefully in limiting intellectual freedoms.
