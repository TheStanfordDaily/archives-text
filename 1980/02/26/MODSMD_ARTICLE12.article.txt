## Coup averted in El Salvador

SAN SALVADOR, El Sal
vador — United States officials
here believe they have temporar
ily stopped a rightist coup in El
Salvador hv threatening to cut
off all military, economic and
political support for such an ac
tion.
The situation here remains
tense, however, in the wake of
attacks on leftist and centrist
members of.the U.S.-supported
coalition government by ul
trarightist terrorists.
'"The people of this country
and part of the key actors in
volved have the good sense to
avert a coup that by all indicators
was set to take place this
weekend." said one highly
placed U.S. official here.

"As we became aware of this
(coup plot) last week," the offi
cial said, "the United States
moved very quickly and very
forcefully to make unequivocally
clear its opposition to such a
coup and to reiterate its support
lor the current junta and reform
program."
The plot to oust the month
and-a-half old coalition between
Christian democrats and the
military men who seized power
from the repressive government
of Gen. Carlos Humberto Rom
ero in October included plans for
shutting down all communica
tions in the country for at least
one day as the rightists consoli
dated their power over the na
tion.
Such a move, U.S. officials
tear, would result either in ruth
less oppression and bloodshed
on the order of that perpetrated
by the Chilean military after the
coup overthrowing Salvador Al
lende, or all-out civil war, which
could eventually be won by Mar
xist guerrillas.
Aid promise
Neither of these alternatives
would be acceptable to the Un
ited Sttes, officials here have
said. The U.S. diplomats, as well
as more liberal members of the
El Salvador military, maintain
that the promise of $50 million in
U.S. economic aid and about $5
to $ 10 million in military support
were vital factors in averting the
coup.
Under the Romero govern

ment, El Salvador saw the Un
ited States cut off all but about
$5 million a year in economic aid
and sever military support en
tirely.
El Salvador's second
military-civilian junta in four
months has proposed agrarian
reforms, nationalization of bank
ing and other changes to lessen
the wide gulf between the na
tion's tiny rich community and
the huge poor one. Military
rightists and some influential
citizens oppose the reforms. The
violence continues.
Gunmen
Early Saturday, Attorney
General Mario Zamora Rivas, a
Christian Democratic Party
leader accused by the right of
links with the left, was killed by
unidentified gunmen who burst
in on a party at his home.
Saturday night, three men ab
ducted a photographer for a lef
tist Mexican newspaper and put
him on a plane foi Guatemala.
On Sunday, Archbishop Oscar
Arnulfo Romeo accused rightists
of killing 50 pesons in rural areas
during January.
"If this government can mud
dle through for a few months,
make some the changes that are
needed here, and hold power,
then it can survive," said one dip
lomatic source here.
Cheap labor
The military has been in
charge since 1933. while a few
families have held on to the
wealth of the country, its fertile

farmland. Their huge ranches
grow coffee, cotton and sugar for
export. Labor is cheap — about
$3 a day — and profits are high.
Most of the country's 4.8 mill
ion people are poor, and many
are illiterate. Almost 70 percent
of the children are under
nourished. The middle class is
small and most of it seems to live
in San Salvador, the capital.
Some sources say the country
is near bankruptcy.
The inflation rate is nearly 20
percent. Occupations of embas
sies and offices have chased
foreign investors from the coun
try. Lower coffee prices, coupled
with terrorism that reduces har
vesting, are costing the country
up to $80 million a year. Cotton
and sugar production is off an
estimated $20 million to $40
million this year.
Half unemployed
About half the labor force is
out of work, and that gives the
jobless more time to think about
the left's promises of a better
deal.
Leftist organizations — such
as the 50,000-to-70,000-
member Popular Revolutionary
Bloc, the Feb. 28 Popular
Leagues, the United Popular Ac
tion Front and the National
Democratic Union, a front for
the Communist party — have un
ited. They hold demonstration
marches, occupy embassies, pub
lic and private buildings and fill
walls with slogans and posters.
