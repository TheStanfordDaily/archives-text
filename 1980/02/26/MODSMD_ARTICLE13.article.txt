# Zimbabwe elections slated for this week
## 
### Jack Foisie The Los Angeles Times 
SALISBURY. Rhodesia — This country's
struggle of more than 15 years to resolve its
racial problems and cast off British rule will
be climaxed this week with elections at which
an estimated three million black voters will
choose the nation's first fully representative
black-majority parliament.
Six weofcs of campaigning by nine black
political parties have been marked by wide
spread intimidation of rural voters, nightly
interparty lighting in black townships and
conflict between guerrilla and government
troops.
This conflict has occurred despite the
cease-fire that took effect Jan. 4. Under its
terms both sides were supposed to have dis
engaged. but in many areas this has not hap
pened. There are about a dozen deaths each
day from combat and terrorism.
In the tribal trustlands. where SO percent
of Rhodesia's seven million blacks live, con
ditions are only a little better than during the
seven years of guerrilla warfare.
Despite the turmoil, the British governor,
I ord Soames. is determined to go ahead with
elections. They are to begin tomorrow and
will last for three days to allow lor the widely
dispersed rural people to trudge to polling
places many miles from their villages.
'Mobile'
To encourage voting, almost half of the
country's 657 balloting points will be
"mobile." with election teams setting up vot
ing booths for a few hours in remote schools,
churches, mines and farms before moving on.
One polling team will be airborne, landing at
dirt strips in the bush.
The British government has shown almost
a desperate desire to complete the election
process, grand independence to its last Afri
can colony, see the installation of the new
government — and then leave.
During 90 years of white rule, Rhodesia
(the size of France) developed its farming,
mining and light industry so successfully that
the country withstood the effects of almost
universal trade sanctions between 1965 and
the end of 1979, the period when white
Rhodesians were in rebellion against the
British crown over the issue of white
minority rule.
Now resigned to black rule, the 230,000

whites remaining in the country are fearful
that whichever black leader is the victor in
elections and becomes prime minister, gov
ernment instability will follow, and there
may be a renewed civil war.
To allay white fears, the British-drafted
constitution reserves 20 seats for whites in
the 100-member Parliament for a period of
seven years. Even so. the white block would
have to arrange an informal coalition with a
substantial number of the SO black members
in Parliament to retain a meaningful voice in
lawmaking.
The worst fate that could befall whites,
they contend, would be for Robert Mugabe's
party to win a parliamentary majority and
make him prime minister. Mugabe is a
socialist and his manifesto, although couched
in moderatelanguage, calls for redistribution
of farm lands owned by whites and the shar
ing of other white wealth with the have-not
blacks.
Front runner
Mugabe's Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front appears to be the
front-runner in the campaign.
Mugabe and his party became legal in
Rhodesia only after the cease-fire. Under
truce terms, 15,000 of his armed followers
moved into "peace camps" in eastern
Rhodesia under the watchful eye of a small
Commonwealth truce monitoring force.
There have been frequent clashes between
Mugabe's fighters, who remained in the
bush, and roving Rhodesian army patrols.
Other black political leaders have com
plained they cannot safely campaign in
Mugabe's areas of dominance.
As a result, Soames accused Mugabe of
widespread intimidation and threatened to
disenfranchise votes in 10 tribal trustlands
(out of the country's 165) unless Mugabe
opens up his fiefdoms to other candidates.
Favorites?
Mugabe has accused Soames of favoring
the other candidates. Nevertheless, there has
been a lessening of intimidation in Mugabe
areas, the British say. and punitive action
against Mugabe now seems unlikely.
There have been accusations of intimida
tion against other major parties as well, par
ticularly that of Bishop Abel Muzorewa. He
was briefly the country's prime minister last
year in a coalition government dominated by

whites behind the scenes.
As a black moderate never in rebellion
against the government when it was white
controlled, Muzorewa has a well-financed
and well-organized campaign in which
whites play a part. Me and his United African
National Council Party once had a large
private army. It is now incorporated into the
Rhodesian army as an "auxiliary" and is
supposed to be apolitical. But there is ampt*
evidence obtained by observers that the au
xiliaries still solicit votes and sing the praises
of the bishop.
Gaining
The bishop is probably Mugabe's closest
challenger, although Mugabe's partner in the
Patriotic Front alliance, Joshua Nkomo, is
reported to be gaining favor rapidly.
Mugabe and Nkomo have their own politi
cal parties, and each is campaigning on his
own.
Nkomo. at 6 1 the veteran black
nationalist, is backing away from Mugabe's
radical stance.
With a plea to both blacks and whites "to
submerge our bitterness towards each
other." Nkomo is shaping up as probably the
only black leader who could form a workable
coalition in the event that none of the three
— Mugabe. Muzorewa or Nkomo — wins an
outright majority of 51 seats in Parliament.
The <S() black seats are expected to be split
mainly among their three parties, with only a
few seats going to other parties.
No alternative
Mugabe is considered likely to win at least
35 and perhaps as many as 45. According to
informed British sources, such a result would
leave Soames with no alternative but to ask
Mugabe to try to form a government.
However, if Mugabe's margin is not that
big. and Nkomo and Muzorewa each gather
20 to 25 seats, Soames might wait for
"horse-trading" efforts by the leaders to
form a coalition or so-called government of
national unity.
Ballots will not be counted by local polling
stations. They will be sent, under armed
guard, to eight provincial election centers for
a "face-down" count to verify the number of
ballots cast.
The double count will take three days and
election results will probably not be an
nounced before March 4.
