## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
What's a nice Stanford Law School professor like
Byron Sher doing in the campaign for the 2 Ist
district state Assembly seat?
"1 do think we need better people in Sac
ramento." said Sher. a former mayor of Palo Alto
and current council member. "We're not at a crisis
point yet. But this is a serious period, the '80s ... I
think people who know something about govern
ment. and who are interested in it have a responsi
bility to make it better, and I think I can help."
Sher made his comments on the KZSU radio
program Campus Conference last Thursday.
Most of the discussion with Sher centered on
local issues, particularly those related to the area's
rapid industrial growth and the current housing
shortage.
Although Sher is barred from voting in the coun
cil whenever matters directly affecting the Univer
sity are being considered, he commended the Uni
versity for going ahead with its plan to build 1 600
housing units on Willow Road. This project had
been blocked for a time by the citv council's re

fusal to widen access roads to the proposed facility.
Sher thought it was likely that both the Willow
Road project and another proposed housing facil
ity on Peter Coutts Hill would be annexed by the
city of Palo Alto after completion.
Sher did not, however, see any benefit for Palo
Alto in annexing any of the rest of Stanford's unin
corporated lands.
The former mayor also outlined some of the
more basic planks in his campaign for the Assem
bly seat now being vacated by Assemblyman Vic
tor Calvo.
"I'm 52 years old," said Sher, "and I'm not
looking to use this (seat) as a stepping stone at the
beginning of my career to something eise." In
stead. he said, he wishes to provide leadership in
the State Assembly , so that the state can better face
the overriding problems of energy and conserva
tion of natural resources.
Sher announced his intention to seek the Demo
cratic nomination for the Assembly seat on Feb. 5.
He decided to do so only alter incumbent Calvo
withdrew from the race.
