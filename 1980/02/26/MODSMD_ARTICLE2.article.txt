# Good news for job seekers: CPPC reports 10 percent hike in placement

### Hillary Hall Staff Writer 
Job placements for Stanford
graduates increased 10.3 percent last
year over the previous academic year,
the Career Planning and Placement
Center revealed in its 1978-1979 An
nual Report.
Consistent with national trends, the
demand for Stanford engineering and
science graduates is reported to be at its
highest level since the space rush of the
early '60s. The CPPC reported a 19.7
percent improvement relative to regist
ration over the 1977-1978 year.
There was a decline in the number of
engineering and science registrants
from 839 during 1977-1978 to 594
during 1978-1979 while placements
remained the same (384 and 389, re
spectively). This decline is the reason
for the unusually high percent im
provement reported for 1978-1979.
The CPPC report suggests that this
significant decline in engineering and
science job applications is due to:
— a decrease in the number of
graduates as a whole,
— an increase in company
supported programs in which students
have previously enrolled,
— an increase in the number of
foreign graduates,
— an increase in the number of stu

dents continuing their education,
— an increase in the number of stu
dents securing jobs through job fairs
and other placement procedures and
therefore not requiring the services of
the CPPC.
Alumni placement also declined due
to a reported reluctance to move from
one job to another during a period of
some economic uncertainty, the report
stated.
Placement of liberal arts candidates
showed a marked improvement over
the previous year.
The number of registrants increased
from 592 during 1977-1978 to 701
during 1978-1979 and placements im
proved from 163 to 266 — an increase
of 10.4 percent for Stanford graduates
as opposed to a nationwide decline of
14 percent recently reported by the
College Placement Council.
Stanford alumni also fared well, with
placement in this category increasing
by 11.6 percent over the 1977-1978
academic year.
CPPC director Ralph Keller attri
buted this increase to the Job De
velopment Program, now in its second
year, in which members of the CPPC
staff actively canvass industries and or
ganizations to locate job openings. This
program "has been the number one
priority of the CPPC this year," Keller

said.
The Job Development Program has
attracted more than 100 liberal arts re
cruiters as opposed to merely 1 1 four
years ago.
Keller also said liberal arts graduates
are becoming preferable to students
with master's degrees in business for
some organizations because "a B A will
anticipate a starting salary approxi
mately half that of an MBA."
Stanford graduates in education also
showed improvement in securing
employent despite an unfavorable
nationwide job market for teachers.
New graduate placement was up only 2
percent, but alumni placement in
creased by 6.4 percent. Especially
noteworthy were the advancements
made in placing elementary and secon
dary school teachers. The placement
rate for 1978-1979 was 76.2 percent.
Of the 2937 persons registered for
employment through the CPPC in all
categories, only 384 (13 percent) were
reported still available for placement
last fall. In an article published in Cam
pus Report, Keller observed that
"many of these registrants are known
to be permanently employed, but are
looking for advancement." He esti
mated that fewer than 2 percent of
those registered with the center are ac-
