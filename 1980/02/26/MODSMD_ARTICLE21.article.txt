## Avoid Franklin-case 'witch-hunt' 
### 
On I eb. 13 the Daily carried
an accusation by a faculty
member that activist professors
here are unprofessional rabble
rousers and trouble-makers. 1
hoped that 15 years ol social
and political protest at the Uni
versity had show n us that the cost
ol personal and professional de
nigration is prejudgment and
eventual exclusion of important
forces Irom the Stanford com
munity To say of someone. "I
disagree violently with your idea,
and therefore you are a ne'er
do-well incompetent." is to raise
the same witch-hunt spectre that
made travesty of conventionally
accepted Ireedom of speech here
during the University's time ot
trouble.
It was eight years ago that the
board ot trustees dismissed
Bruce franklin, then a tenured
associate professor of English,
lor participating in rallies that
urged shut-downs of Iniversity
buildings and for telling students
not to obey police dispersal or
ders. Franklin was lired for say
ing things that he and other per
sons. both students and faculty,
had been saying for years.
An avowed Maoist whose
ofl-campus activities involved
him in questionable behavior.
Franklin was an effective
speaker. Because he slung abuse
at the trustees and the administ
ration. he had become the prin
cipal target ol anti-dissent feel
ing by the fall ol 1970.
Because Franklin had been so
visible — and audible — during
the years ot protest, many per
sons assumed that he was a cause
ol campus disturbances. Ironi
cally. the entire computer center
incident was organized in com
plete isolation Irom franklin by
a group that sought goals com
pletely dilterent from those of
Franklin's Venceramos group,
and to point the linger at
Franklin for shutting down the
computation center was particu
larly inapt.

Moreover. Franklin had done
no more than he and other fa
culty members and students had
done: he had advocated a build
ing occupation. The University
had seen this old play many times
before: at the Old Union, in May
196N; at the Applied Electronics
Lab in April 1969. at Encina
Hall in May 1969; at the Old
Union once again twice in April
and May 197(1: and in other de
monstrations and confrontations
with the police.
The academic common law . as
it was practiced by the Pit/erand
Lyman administrations prior to
February 1971. accepted free
speech. Never, before Franklin's
speech, had advocacy of a build
ing occupation been publicly
stamped as an actionable of
fense. It was the physical act ot
entering a closed building that
opened a Stanford community
member to sanctions.
What underscored the
speech/act dichotomy was the
reasonable assumption that per
sons who entered buildings did
so after considered reflection of
the alternatives ;uid the con
sequences. They had made up
their own minds. The building
occupations were not the results
ol eloquence setting lire to
reason.
During the Advisory Board
hearing, the administration
maintained that it would be
bound by conventional stan
dards ol constitutional protec
tion. The relevant speech
protective standard was the Sup
reme Court's decision in Bran
denburg is. Ohio (1969). which
held that "the constitutional
guarantees ot tree speech and
tree press do not permit a state to
forbid or proscribe advocacy ot
the use of force or of law viola
tion except where such advocacy
is directed to inciting or produc
ing imminent lawless action and
is likely to incite or produce such
action." The common-sense
reading of Brandenburg is that if

you do rmt intend to spark im
mediate lawlessness or that your
words are not likely to cause such
behavior, your speech is pro
tected.
The incitement standard re
quires a finding that the
speaker's words are likely to
cause imminent action, and it
conjures up the image o! a per
son addressing a heated crowd
that responds to his urgings with
immediate lawless behavior.
It seems pretty tar trom the
mark to hold that addressing a
crowd in White Plaza, a crowd
that had pretty clearly decided
the night before to occupy the
computer center, a crowd that
had already responded to live
speakers prior to Franklin who
made the computer center occu
pation the principal theme of
their talks, a crowd that took a
vote after the speeches, was in
citeful of anything. The only
Calitornia court opinion to find
I ranklin's speech beyond the
standards ot protection was
marked by superficial considera
tion both of the speech itself and
of the surrounding events.
The Franklin case will be com
ing back to the University for a
rehcarum before the Advisory
Board. In the meantime, activists
should carefully weigh their
words as well astheiracts. Advo
cacy of acts ot resistance that in
volve violation ol the University
disruption policy would be ac
tionable under the standards es
tablished by the I ranklin case.
The present regulations ol cam
pus speech, while ol dubious
constitutionality, at least furnish
a presumptive standard. When
I ranklin addressed the crowd at
White Plaza in Feb. 1971. there
were no clear standards.
But it was more than am
biguity about standards that
made the Franklin case possible.
Although Franklin played more
than his part in contributing to
hatred and distrust here a decade

ago, the hostility directed against
him went beyond criticism ot his
ideas. This hostility repudiated
him as a member ot the commun
ity.
Like Stanford then, the Uni
versity today has great resources
ot human talent, of leadership,
intelligence, and common sense.
Those resources were adequate
in 1971 to proceed with business
in spite ol people like I ranklm
who rocked the boat. Hut there
was a failure ol confidence and ol
will. Let's hope it doesn't occur
again.
