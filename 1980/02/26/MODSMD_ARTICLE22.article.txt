# Price controls not moral
## 
### 
A lot of political energy these days is going into
the control — or attempted control — or prices. Oil
prices are the most notable example, hut others
abound: rent control, nulk price supports, sugar
subsidies, minimum wages, or the granddaddy of
them all — economy-wide wage and price controls.
Likewise, much editorial energy goes into exp
laining why we need or don't need the ceilings or
floors on particular prices, or on all prices.
Those in favor of price floors or ceilings almost
always have a particular group in mind that they
say will suffer unjustly if prices are not controlled.
Renters will be subject to exorbitant rent increases
if rent controls are not enacted. Farmers will be put
out of business if farm price supports are not con
tinued. Labor unions would lose jobs to unskilled,
lower-price labor if a minimum wage were not in
place.
Those who oppose controls on prices almost al
ways concentrate on the bad consequences of such
measures. The case one hears against rent controls
is certain to stress the diminished supply of new
rental housing and the deterioriation of existing
units that results from placing a ceiling on rents.
The net result is a short-term gain for existing
renters and a long-term loss for future and poten
tial future renters. Sometimes other consequences
will be mentioned, such as the creation of new
bureaucracies to administer controls.
However valid these utilitarian arguments
against price controls are, it the opponents of these
measures are ever to make any headway in general,
they must convince the populace that controls are
to be opposed on principle. And this will require
making a moral case against them.
To make such a case, we need to examine just
what a price is. Before there was money, there were
no prices as we understand them. In the barter
economy each trade was figured independently. If
both parties to a trade found the terms agreeable,
then both were made better off by the exchange of
their properties than they were before the trade.
The crucial point is that each party had the right
to refuse an exchange if he thought that he could
find a more favorable exchange elsewhere. This
right is not one that is granted by the state or other
authority, it is a natural human right: to seek the
most favorable terms of trade and accept them.
When people began to make more complex plans
and engage in more exchanges, they found it useful
to use a single commodity as a medium for indirect
exchange, rather than direct barter. The creation of
money made every transaction the equivalent of
half of a barter exchange. By freeing traders from

the need of finding exchanges where each party
had a use for the other's property, the market
economy, and with it civilization, was born.
Because in every trade there is a transfer of the
medium of exchange, it's convenient to measure
the ratio of money to material: thus, prices. It is
(hen easy for traders to compare the terms ot ex
change offered by others; a seller looks tor the
highest price, a buyer looks for the lowest.
It should now be apparent what a price control
is: the threat of violence (such as going to jail) if the
terms of an exchange are not to the liking of the
state. It is the prohibition of an individual from
exercising his natural right to seek out the most
favorable terms of exchange. Price controls are one
example of what Robert Nozick calls the "forbid-

ding of capitalist acts between consenting adults."
Morally therefore, the state is in this instance, as
in many others, an aggressor, an initiator of vio
lence against those peacefully engaged in produc
tion and exchange. It does not matter whether a
majority of voters approves of this coercion, or
whether the good being traded is in short or abun
dant supply. It is a violation of the most basic of
human rights — to use one's property peacefully —
for the state to mandate prices.
The activities of government have come to con
trol so much of our lives that even the opponents of
such measures as price controls implicity grant the
state the right to impose them. It is time with this
issue that we take the same stand that the oppo
nents of the draft take: the state has no right to
interfere in our li\es for its short-run, political in
terests.
The state should limit itself to the libertarian
ideal of protecting citizens from acts of aggression,
rather than engaging in such acts itself. The only
type of economy consistent with this ideal is the
tree market. And the only place for price controls is
in the dustbin of history.

lower-price labor if a minimum wage were not in
place.
Those who oppose controls on prices almost al
ways concentrate on the bad consequences of such
measures. The case one hears against rent controls
is certain to stress the diminished supply of new
rental housing and the deterioriation of existing
units that results from placing a ceiling on rents.
The net result is a short-term gain for existing
renters and a long-term loss for future and poten
tial future renters. Sometimes other consequences
will be mentioned, such as the creation of new
bureaucracies to administer controls.
However valid these utilitarian arguments
against price controls are, it the opponents of these
measures are ever to make any headway in general,
they must convince the populace that controls are
to be opposed on principle. And this will require
making a moral case against them.
To make such a case, we need to examine just
what a price is. Before there was money, there were
no prices as we understand them. In the barter
economy each trade was figured independently. If
both parties to a trade found the terms agreeable,
then both were made better off by the exchange of
their properties than they were before the trade.
The crucial point is that each party had the right
to refuse an exchange if he thought that he could
find a more favorable exchange elsewhere. This
right is not one that is granted by the state or other
authority, it is a natural human right: to seek the
most favorable terms of trade and accept them.
When people began to make more complex plans
and engage in more exchanges, they found it useful
to use a single commodity as a medium for indirect
exchange, rather than direct barter. The creation of
money made every transaction the equivalent of
half of a barter exchange. By freeing traders from

the need of finding exchanges where each party
had a use for the other's property, the market
economy, and with it civilization, was born.
Because in every trade there is a transfer of the
medium of exchange, it's convenient to measure
the ratio of money to material: thus, prices. It is
(hen easy for traders to compare the terms ot ex
change offered by others; a seller looks tor the
highest price, a buyer looks for the lowest.
It should now be apparent what a price control
is: the threat of violence (such as going to jail) if the
terms of an exchange are not to the liking of the
state. It is the prohibition of an individual from
exercising his natural right to seek out the most
favorable terms of exchange. Price controls are one
example of what Robert Nozick calls the "forbid-

ding of capitalist acts between consenting adults."
Morally therefore, the state is in this instance, as
in many others, an aggressor, an initiator of vio
lence against those peacefully engaged in produc
tion and exchange. It does not matter whether a
majority of voters approves of this coercion, or
whether the good being traded is in short or abun
dant supply. It is a violation of the most basic of
human rights — to use one's property peacefully —
for the state to mandate prices.
The activities of government have come to con
trol so much of our lives that even the opponents of
such measures as price controls implicity grant the
state the right to impose them. It is time with this
issue that we take the same stand that the oppo
nents of the draft take: the state has no right to
interfere in our li\es for its short-run, political in
terests.
The state should limit itself to the libertarian
ideal of protecting citizens from acts of aggression,
rather than engaging in such acts itself. The only
type of economy consistent with this ideal is the
tree market. And the only place for price controls is
in the dustbin of history.

A lot of political energy these days is going into
the control — or attempted control — or prices. Oil
prices are the most notable example, hut others
abound: rent control, nulk price supports, sugar
subsidies, minimum wages, or the granddaddy of
them all — economy-wide wage and price controls.
Likewise, much editorial energy goes into exp
laining why we need or don't need the ceilings or
floors on particular prices, or on all prices.
Those in favor of price floors or ceilings almost
always have a particular group in mind that they
say will suffer unjustly if prices are not controlled.
Renters will be subject to exorbitant rent increases
if rent controls are not enacted. Farmers will be put
out of business if farm price supports are not con
tinued. Labor unions would lose jobs to unskilled,
lower-price labor if a minimum wage were not in
place.
Those who oppose controls on prices almost al
ways concentrate on the bad consequences of such
