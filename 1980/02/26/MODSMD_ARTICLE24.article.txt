## Take lead, solar heat new dorm 
### 
As a long awaited response to the
problem of alleviating the housing shortage
on campus, the University plans to construct
a dorm complex on the west side of campus.
In this age of increasing energy concerns we
feel the careful selection of energy sources
for the new student housing is essential.
The dorm, which will accommodate 800
students, is still in the preliminary stages of
planning. A committee has investigated pos
sible designs and other necessary considera
tions to construct housing which best meets
demands.
After evaluating the University's prelimi
nary report it is apparent that the architec
ture of the building will incorporate passive
solar energy design. This includes such con
siderations as orienting buildings and land
scaping to make the building energy effi
cient. Simple considerations such as imple
menting south-facing walls to catch the
winter sun and planting deciduous trees that
shade the buildings in summer but let the sun
shine through in the winter are well worth the
effort in terms of energy conservation.
The University's insightful planning is
commendable, but it is not enough.
Unfortunately, although the University

aims to design the new facilities to he energy
efficient, they seem skeptical about using ac
tive solar design. When it is economically
feasible we feel it would be a mistake to forgo
the opportunity to solarize.
Active design would include a solar hot
water system and some space heating. Con
sidering that student residences use large
amounts of hot water, a cost-effective solar
hot-water system would be a good invest
ment in the long run. While a solar hot-water
system alone may not be enough, combined
with a conventional system the energy sav
ings would be great.
When taking into account the world's
energy situation, active solar energy seems
the only reasonable and responsible choice
to make. Fuel prices continue to rise more
rapidly than inflation and no relief is in sight.
Our dependence on fossil fuels must
change. We need to turn our attention to
alternative sources of energy. A solar system
calls for a high initial investment but lessens
our dependence on conventional fuels. And
within five to 10 years the system will pay for
itself.
Setting economic arguments aside, the

University has an obligation as an educa-.
tional institution to set examples for the out
side community. ;
Solar energy is not getting the support it
should. The government has set a goal of 20,
percent of our energy to come from alterna'-;
tive sources of energy by the year 2000.,
Without a strategy for implementation,;
though, the government's commitment to
solar is meaningless. We can do something,
here by taking a leading role in this matter.
Maybe if the University takes the initiative
others will follow. i
The University will not respond to the ef
forts of a few students writing to the Daily.
It may, however, respond to the efforts of
many students trying to make a change.
There is still time. The student body must
attempt to influence the University's deci
sion. If we act now, in a few years we won't
have to ask ourselves why we didn't do it in
the first place.
