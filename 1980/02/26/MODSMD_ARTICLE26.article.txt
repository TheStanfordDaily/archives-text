The human body is a magnifi
cent creation. I think we would
all agree. But women's bodies, in
particular, have been exploited
by the media to sell products,
thus aggravating the problems of
sex-stereotyping by portraying
women as objects, not people.
In the Women's Week poster,
however, the women's bodies
arc certainly not portrayed as
"suggestive" sex objects clamor
ing around a huge phallic sym
bol, as they were mistakenly re
ferred to in a letter to the editor
(Daily, Feb. 19).
Rather, the women's shapes
and the tree suggest strength, un
ity. growth and the enhancement
of life itself: the very goals that
we are striving to attain. That the
poster could be misinterpreted
as being anti-feminist is perhaps
a result of our daily bombard
ment by the various mass media
that do reduce women to sex ob
jects.

Anderson stands out
According to an account in the
Daily (Feb. 21) of the Republi
can candidates' debates in New
Hampshire "six of the seven
candidates agreed that the na
tion's military budget should be
boosted." But the story left out

the most important fact — the
name of that seventh candidate.
It was, of course. Rep. John An
derson of Illinois, who has so far
provided the Republican prim
ary campaign with its only ele
ments of maturity and compas
sion.
At the recent debate the other
six candidates outdid one
another in their tough talk and
eagerness to store up bigger and
deadlier weapons. This wasn't
machismo, which occasionally
has some dignity, but the mindless
bravado of small men willing to
risk the world's security in their
scramble for the White House
and its benefits.
Anderson stood out in sharp
contrast by pointing out that an
efficient military establishment
required something other than
pouring out money for more
arms. But what was far more im
portant, he defined national sec
urity in terms of a strong
economy, control of inflation,
and solutions to our pressing
domestic problems.
Anderson has been tough
minded enough to propose what
is perhaps the only workable
fuel-conservation measure to
date — a 50-cent-per- gallon tax
on gasoline, to be accompanied
by a cut in payroll taxes.
He is humane enough to sup
port the Equal Rights Amend
ment and to leave the question of
abortion up to a woman and her

conscience.
After George Bush told a gun
club in New Hampshire that he
favored abolishing even the fee
ble controls on hand guns that
now exist, Anderson bluntly ad
vocated stronger controls — the
only Republican candidate to do
so. He also said that his greatest
mistake as a congressman was to
vote for the Gulf of Tonkin re
solution in 1964, which in effect
gave former President Lyndon
Johnson the authority to escalate
the Vietnam War.
Anderson is widely acclaimed
for his intelligence and commit
ment to solving the serious prob
lems of this country. And, as if
these qualifications were hand
icaps, he is given no chance to
win.
Nevertheless, when George
Bush can coolly contemplate a
U.S. "victory" in a nuclear war,
and Ronald Reagan's idea of dip
lomacy is to blockade Cuba, then
it's time to go for the long odds.
At the very least, a vote for An
derson would be a signal that we
are not all lemmings, and that
sanity and restraint are still es
teemed in this country.

Free Choi Lee
For the last six years, a young
Korean has been forced to spend
his precious time wasting away in
prison for a crime he did not

commit. Choi Lee was 23 years
old when he was convicted of a
1973 Chinatown killing, based
on biased testimony, and sup
pressed evidence. Although the
court later overturned its guilty
conviction, Lee now faces the
death penalty, for defending
himself against a white neo-Nazi
gang member in prison.
What is clear to many is that
his only basis for being in prison
is the inherrent racist legal and
law enforcement system which
convicted Lee based on race — a
Korean immigrant, a youth who
faced constant harassment in
school and the courts because he
could not speak English well. It is
for these reasons that the Korean
community and other Asian/
Pacific nationalities are all de
manding his freedom.
Presently, people are demand
ing that the courts uphold the de
cision which overturned the first
guilty conviction, and that his
second death penalty conviction
be overturned also. Petitions are
being circulated demanding his
immediate release and that repa
rations for this injustice be given
by the state.
The Asian American Students
Association is coordinating edu
cational presentations and out
reach here at the University in
order to further broaden the
movement in support of Lee. It is
urgent that all concerned speak
out against this crime—commit

ted not by Lee, but by the system
of national oppression. It is the
people who must and will free
him.

Reagan a 'moron'
Even if we totally ignore his
rectionary leanings, after his re
cent joke-telling fiasco, it seems
to me obvious that Ronald
Reagan does not deserve the
presidency.
The reason is simple: the man
is clearly a moron.
Anyone running for public of
fice who is stupid enough to tell
ethnic jokes to the candidate's
press corps is totally undeserving
of the office.
The only solution is for
Reagan to withdraw from the
race before he makes a real fool
out of himself.

solution in 1964, which in effect
gave former President Lyndon
Johnson the authority to escalate
the Vietnam War.
Anderson is widely acclaimed
for his intelligence and commit
ment to solving the serious prob
lems of this country. And, as if
these qualifications were hand
icaps, he is given no chance to
win.
Nevertheless, when George
Bush can coolly contemplate a
U.S. "victory" in a nuclear war,
and Ronald Reagan's idea of dip
lomacy is to blockade Cuba, then
it's time to go for the long odds.
At the very least, a vote for An

Free Choi Lee
For the last six years, a young
Korean has been forced to spend
his precious time wasting away in
prison for a crime he did not

commit. Choi Lee was 23 years
old when he was convicted of a
1973 Chinatown killing, based
on biased testimony, and sup
pressed evidence. Although the
court later overturned its guilty
conviction, Lee now faces the
death penalty, for defending
himself against a white neo-Nazi
gang member in prison.
What is clear to many is that
his only basis for being in prison
is the inherrent racist legal and
law enforcement system which
convicted Lee based on race — a
Korean immigrant, a youth who
faced constant harassment in
school and the courts because he
could not speak English well. It is
for these reasons that the Korean
community and other Asian/
Pacific nationalities are all de
manding his freedom.
Presently, people are demand
ing that the courts uphold the de
cision which overturned the first
guilty conviction, and that his
second death penalty conviction
be overturned also. Petitions are
being circulated demanding his
immediate release and that repa
rations for this injustice be given
by the state.
The Asian American Students
Association is coordinating edu
cational presentations and out
reach here at the University in
order to further broaden the
movement in support of Lee. It is
urgent that all concerned speak
out against this crime—commit

ted not by Lee, but by the system
of national oppression. It is the
people who must and will free
him.

Reagan a 'moron'
Even if we totally ignore his
rectionary leanings, after his re
cent joke-telling fiasco, it seems
to me obvious that Ronald
Reagan does not deserve the
presidency.
The reason is simple: the man
is clearly a moron.
Anyone running for public of
fice who is stupid enough to tell
ethnic jokes to the candidate's
press corps is totally undeserving
of the office.
The only solution is for
Reagan to withdraw from the
race before he makes a real fool
out of himself.

The human body is a magnifi
cent creation. I think we would
all agree. But women's bodies, in
particular, have been exploited
by the media to sell products,
thus aggravating the problems of
sex-stereotyping by portraying
women as objects, not people.
In the Women's Week poster,
however, the women's bodies
arc certainly not portrayed as
"suggestive" sex objects clamor
ing around a huge phallic sym
bol, as they were mistakenly re
ferred to in a letter to the editor
(Daily, Feb. 19).
Rather, the women's shapes
and the tree suggest strength, un
ity. growth and the enhancement
of life itself: the very goals that
we are striving to attain. That the
poster could be misinterpreted
as being anti-feminist is perhaps
a result of our daily bombard
ment by the various mass media
that do reduce women to sex ob
jects.

Anderson stands out
According to an account in the
Daily (Feb. 21) of the Republi
can candidates' debates in New
Hampshire "six of the seven
candidates agreed that the na
tion's military budget should be
boosted." But the story left out

the most important fact — the
name of that seventh candidate.
It was, of course. Rep. John An
derson of Illinois, who has so far
provided the Republican prim
ary campaign with its only ele
ments of maturity and compas
sion.
At the recent debate the other
six candidates outdid one
another in their tough talk and
eagerness to store up bigger and
deadlier weapons. This wasn't
machismo, which occasionally
has some dignity, but the mindless
bravado of small men willing to
risk the world's security in their
scramble for the White House
and its benefits.
Anderson stood out in sharp
contrast by pointing out that an
efficient military establishment
required something other than
pouring out money for more
arms. But what was far more im
portant, he defined national sec
urity in terms of a strong
economy, control of inflation,
and solutions to our pressing
domestic problems.
Anderson has been tough
minded enough to propose what
is perhaps the only workable
fuel-conservation measure to
date — a 50-cent-per- gallon tax
on gasoline, to be accompanied
by a cut in payroll taxes.
He is humane enough to sup
port the Equal Rights Amend
ment and to leave the question of
abortion up to a woman and her

conscience.
After George Bush told a gun
club in New Hampshire that he
favored abolishing even the fee
ble controls on hand guns that
now exist, Anderson bluntly ad
vocated stronger controls — the
only Republican candidate to do
so. He also said that his greatest
mistake as a congressman was to
vote for the Gulf of Tonkin re
solution in 1964, which in effect
gave former President Lyndon
Johnson the authority to escalate
