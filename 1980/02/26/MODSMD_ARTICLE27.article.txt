## Symphony tops Arrau 
### 
li is the curse of modern-day
.performers that technically
near-perfect recordings have led
audiences to expect technically
near-perfect performances.
While this must he kept in mind
at any concert, and a certain
"amount of tolerance granted
ali>ng with it.the number of
slip-ups made by Claudio Arrau
Friday night at the War Memo
rial Opera House is inexcusable.
Arrau was the soloist with the
San Francisco Symphony Or
chestra in a performance of
Beethoven's Piano Concerto No.
5 in E flat, the Emperor Con
certo. A very fine and well
respected pianist who has. in
fact, made near-perfect record
ings of this piece, he was
nonetheless on this occasion
plagued with difficulties.
Choppy trills, uneven scale
passages, omitted notes and
wrong notes permeated Arrau's
performance: this is quite sur
prising coming from a pianist
who has played the five Beeth
oven Concerti possibly more
times than any other pianist in
history.
Were technical mistakes the
only problem, that would be one
thing: but most of the concerto
completely lacked any spark or
\itality.as it Arrau had played it
just once too often. Unfortu
nately, this lackluster feeling
spilled over into the orchestra,
who. despite guest conductor
Kurt Masur's energetic conduct
ing. could compensate lor little
of what was wanting.
This is not to say that the en
tire concerto was sour. There
were moments when the rich,
'controlled sonority so much
more characteristic ol Arrau
came through, particularly in the
second movement, v Adagio un
poco mosso." But these ino
jnents were greatly over
shadowed by the largely unin
spired performance in the rest of
Ihe concerto.
J Fortunately for the audience,
fitter intermission the orchestra
did deliver a near-perfect per
formance of Dvorak's Sym
phony No. y in F. minor. from
the New Worlil. Written 111 1N93
in New York (hence the title.

short for"impressions and greet
ings from the New World"), it
supposedly embodies the spirit
of "Indian and Negro themes" in
its melodies.
Masur brought out these
melodies with delicately ba
lanced emphasis, never under
or overstating them. As recur
sion and interrelation of
melodies is one of the most im
portant aspects ol this sym
phony, appropriate melodic em
phasis is vital to the successful
performance of the piece. The
horn section, responsible for
many of the recurrent themes,
was flawless in its articulation,
intonation and shading of
melodic contour.
Effectively working through
the entire orchestra. Masur cap
tured the full depth of Dvorak's

colorations. Yet he was equally
successful in the deceptively
simple passages; the string
pianissimo closing the second
movement was absolutely
spine-tingling.
Ihe orchestra was extraordi
narily responsive to the guest
conductor's baton, and he used
this to its fullest advantage. Sub
tle nuances, carefully controlled
rubatos, a'nd precise dynamic
manipulations in a sensitive and
intelligent interpretation made
this piece a joy to listen to.
Masur was able to elicit in the
D\ orak something he couldn't in
the Beethoven. It is that spark,
that magic, that intangible some
thing that separates a good per
formance from a great one. and
last Friday so dramatically sepa
rated the Emperor Concerto
from the New World Symphony.
