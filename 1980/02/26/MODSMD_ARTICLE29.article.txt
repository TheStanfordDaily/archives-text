# Starship's flight not over yet
## 
### 
Since Marty Balm and Grace Slick left the
band, the Jefferson Starship have become a
much looser group of musicians, as shown by
their sold-out performance at the Warfield
Theatre 111 San Francisco on Friday night.
Mixing the new and the old. the Starship
managed to satisfy a somewhat diverse audi
ence. which ranged from high-schoolers
coming solely to hear the band's new hit
single "Jane" to balding thirty-year-olds
who still thriy e on the old Jefferson Airplane
sound.
It there was one thing the show lacked, in
fact, it was a direction. At one point the band
would be doing a lengthy improvisational
jam, while at the next they'd be doing a
highly commercial pop ballad. II they wanted
to, the Starship could definitely go com
pletely commercial and achieve even more
sales success than they have now: but fortu
nately most ot the members of the band still
seem as concerned with play ing music as they
are with selling it.
Whether this goes lor lead guitarist Craig
Chaquico and lead singer Mickey Thomas is
difficult to say. I riday night, both seemed
more concerned with putting on a show than
they were with playing music. Chaquico's
guitar work was often choppy, yet because he
had a rhythm guitar ace like Paul Kantncr
backing him up. he nonaged toget away with

it.
As tor Thomas, he often seems to be trying
a bit too hard when he sings: though his voice
certainly works toward creating the drab pop
sound, what he docs to some of the old
Airplane songs is. for the most part, an in jus
tice.
Throughout the evening, however, band
members David I rieberg. Pete Scars.
Aynslev Dunbar and Paul Kantncr managed
to keep the Starship's two sets musically
sound, leaving it to Thomas and Chaquico to
please the glitter-rock types.
The Starship opened the first set with a
classic from back in the Ba)in-Slick days.
"Ride the Tiger." They then went on to play
a good deal of material from their new al
bum. Freedom (it Point Zero, but it was an
as-y et-unreleascd song called "The
Stranger" that highlighted the first set.
On it. Frieberg pro\ ided a steady bass line
as Kantncr. Sears and Chaquico created an
electrical assault that was nothing short of
outstanding. "Have You Seen the Saucers
I onight?". one of Kantncr's typical science
fiction fantasies, closed the opening set and
featured a rather long bass solo by Sears.
When the band came back on stage after a
20-mjnute break, they went right into
their new hit single "Jane." only to pull a
complete switch by following it with

"Wooden Ships.' the classic that Kantner
wrote with Dav id Crosby oxer 10 years ago.
By the time the Starship closed with " Rock
Music," the audience was allowed out of
their seats and flooded near the stage, de
manding an encore. The hand came back out.
extremely energetic, and went into "Some
hod) to Love": inspired by the audience.,the
band continued playing, even improvising
enough to briefly go into the Stones' "Satis
faction" and the Knack's "My Sharona."
The surprise of the night came during the
second encore as. ha\ ing done virtually all of
their material, the group reached way back
and did the old Jefferson Airplane protest
song "Volunteers."
When they finally did leave the stage for
good, it was clear that the Starship had en
joyed themselved as much as the audience
had. When Kantner told the audience he'd
see them next summer and waved good
night, his line from the song "Freedom at
Point Zero" came to mind: "Rock and roll
isn't over."
It the Jefferson Starship can stay away
from the commercial sound that seems to be
about to plague them and instead provide the
kind ol energy they did during their encores
Friday night, rock will not be over for the
band for a long time.
