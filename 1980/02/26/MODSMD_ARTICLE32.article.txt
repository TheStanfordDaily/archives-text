# The 						Beat soaked

### 
Due to a host ol what turned
out to he insurmountable dif
ficulties. the tree show by The
Beat (pre\iewed in last Thurs
day's Daily) never quite came
oft".
The show. originally
scheduled for Toy on Hall Sun
das night, was nuned to the Phi
Delta Theta House when sec
urity problems proved too dif
ficult to solve on such short
notice. The show, now outside at
the I'lli Delts. was rescheduled
for Sunday afternoon.
Because ol the lack ol
adequate electric power, the
threat ol rain and impending
darkness, the show at the Phi
Delts was doomed.
The opening band. Dirty Lees.

no L i iook ine stage, in a uriv ing
rainstorm. I he Beat did plav one
song because band leader Paul
C oil ins telt he had to do some
thing for the 100-odd people
who had waited lor over two
hours. Covered onlv bv a tarp.
the band essentially risked their
liv es to do ev en that much. It was
a strange fitting conclusion to a
thoroughly messed-up affair.
There's a slim possibility that
I he Beat may return to Stanford
and play a full show. An
nouncements may be forthcom
ing sometime soon. Apologies to
anyone misled by last Thursdav's
article, which accurately re
flected the information then av
ailable. but vva> run before the
show was rescheduled.
