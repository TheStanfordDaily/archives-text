# Ailey dancers here soon
## 
### 
AI \in Ailey's vision of his
company is unique â€” it is not the
choreographer's personal in
strument. hut a repertory com
pany aimed at providing art and
entertainment as well as in
stitutionalizing modern dance by
preserving important works of
the past and commissioning new
ones.
Unlike most modern dance
choreographers. Ailey retired
from performing to choreograph
and direct the Company. The
group's roster of choreographers
covers as broad a spectrum as
John Butler. Louis F-alco, Talley
Beatty. I.ar Lubovitch and
George Laison. Ailey's dancers
are well-versed in modern
dance, ballet, jazz and Afro-
Carribean dance.
The Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater will appear in
Memorial Auditorium March 10
at 8 p.m. as part of the Lively
Arts dance series.
