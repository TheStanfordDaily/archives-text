Iranians assail U.S. interference
TEHRAN -- More than 100,000 Iranians yester
day niarehed past the U.S. Embassy here in a mass
demonstration of support for President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr and to protest past U.S. "interference" in
the country's internal affairs.
Armed detachments of civilian militia, watched
from the roof of the embassy gatehouse bv the 46-
year-old president, trudged through slush and snow
to mark an end of a week of national mobilization.
The demonstration, following a message from re
ligious leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini last
weekend, was the first major rally since early last
month outside the embassy where 50 Americans
have been held hostage since Nov. 4.
The special U.N. commission that arrived here
Saturday declined an imitation from Bani-Sadr to
attend the demonstration, choosing to stay at its hotel
to start work on its investigation here.
Bani-Sadr, addressing the crowd before the march,
stressed the need for a strong and disciplined army as
well as the sacrifices it had to make and the respect
the people should accord it.
He then watched as rank upon rank of marchers
filed past, chanting "down with America," "Bani-
Sadr president," "Bani-Sadr commander-in-chief of
the army" and "long live Imam Khomeini."
The marchers included detachments of men and
women who receive military training and serve in
civilian paramilitary defense groups.
Brown barred from N.Y. primary
NEW YORK — California Gov. Jerry Brown was
barred yesterday from running in the New York
Democratic primary by the State Board of Elections,
which ruled that his petitions to get on the ballot were
invalid.
The board agreed with a challenge to Brown's can
didacy by New York supporters of Sen. Edward Ken
nedy. The board said that although Brown had
gathered 15,404 signatures, only 5332 were valid. A
total of 10,000 valid signatures is needed to run in the
March 25th primary, with 100 of the signers coming
from each of 20 of the state's 39 congressional dis
tricts.
Campaigning in New Hampshire. Brown said he
would appeal the decision in the courts. "1 believe
that Sen. Kennedy is making a profound error that's
going to affect his political career when he partici
pates in knocking off a candidate from the ballot. . . .
It is a sorrv dav in America when voters are denied a
choice." Brown added.
New York state will send the second-largest dele
gation to the Democratic National Convention this
summer, and it the board ruling stands it could have a
de\ astating effect on Brown's already faltering presi
dential campaign.
New York will have 2N2 votes at the convention.
24 less than California.
The board made its decision in the state capital of
Albany after a weekend of scrutinizing Brow n's peti
tions.
"Primarily, they (the signatures) were invalid be
cause they were not registered voters or they were not
enrolled Democrats or the subscribing witness on the
petition was not a registered or an enrolled voter." a
spokesman for the board said. "When that happens
and the witness is disqualified, all the names on the
ballot are disqualified."
Church: Iran crisis looks bleak
WASHINGTON — Sen. Frank Church (D-Ida.).
w ho had been briefed on this country's "understand
ing with Iran." expressed pessimism yesterday about
chances for early release of the U.S. hostages in

Tehran.
Church, chairman of the Foreign Relations Com
mittee. said at a lunch with reporters that "prospects
for early release of the hostages, which seemed prom
ising, now appear much bleaker in light of the latest
pronouncement by the Ayatollah Khomeini."
Church said he based his assessment on Kho
meini's statement Saturday that release of the hos
tages would be decided by Iran's new parliament,
which will not convene until April.
Church refused to elaborate on what he called "our
understanding with the Iranians," even on an off
the-record basis. He said this was because he had
been given the information confidentially.
When asked if Iran had double-crossed the United
States, in terms of his impression of the understand
ing. he gave the response- about prospects for early
release of the hostages appearing "bleak."
U.S. officials never have said just what was the
"understanding" with the Iranian government. But
indications are that establishment of the United Na
tions commission on Iran was supposed to be part of a
plan leading to prompt release of the hostages.
Senate consents to Abscam hold
WASHINGTON — Faced with Department of
Justice defiance, the Senate Select Committee on
Ethics agreed yesterday to a "conditional" 90-day
deferment of its demand that the department turn
over its evidence in the Abscam congressional brib
ery scandal.
Eight members of Congress have been implicated
in the case, in which undercover FBI agents posed as
aides of a fictitious Arab sheik. One of the eight is a
senator — Harrison Williams Jr. (D-N.J.).
Sen. Howell Heflin (D-Ala.), chairman of the Se
nate ethics panel, said the Department of Justice
warned that it would fight all the way to the Supreme
Court if necessary to prevent the committee from
gaining possession of videotapes and recordings the
FBI obtained in its investigation.
"We're running into a stone wall in trying to reach
independent evidence." Heflin told reporters after a
two-hour closed-door meeting with Asst. Attorney
General Philip Heymann. head of the Department of
Justice's criminal division.
The Department has rejected demands for the evi
dence by both Senate and House ethics committees
on grounds that surrendering such evidence could
jeopardize potential prosecutions of members of
Congress or others.
In return for the commitee's deferment of its de
mand. Heflin said Heymann agreed "to an expediti
ous handling of the case and has promised that there
will be no undue delay in the criminal prosecution."
Reps, hold secret House session
WASHINGTON — The House closed its huge
wood chamber doors yesterday and conducted its
second secret session in 149 years, to hear U.S. intel
ligence on Cuban influence in Nicaragua.
Opponents of President Jimmy Carter's request for
$75 million in U.S. aid for Nicaragua urged that the
intelligence be heard before the aid request was voted
on.
House doormen closed the high double doors sur
rounding the House chamber and police were posted
in surrounding hallways and in the attic over the
chamber.
Several House members said after the session that
the intelligence they heard in secret has already been
publicly reported.
"There was nothing new . shocking or exciting, said
Rep. Peter Peyser (N.Y.).
"I think it's a device used to draw attention to the

opposition," said Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D-
Wis.). "I don't think the substance itself is so impor
tant."
Hie first secret House session since May 27. 1830,
was conducted just last June 20 and that also was on
Cuba's influence in Nicaragua.
Another quake hits S. California
SPRING CREST, Calif. —Southern Californians
— muddied and flooded by torrential rains last week
— were jolted awake early yesterday by an ear
thquake that triggered landslides, sparked a fire and
broke dishes and windows.
Scientists said the tremor was another in an unusu
ally large number of moderate quakes that have been
shaking Southern California for the past few years.
The significance of the apparent trend is uncertain,
"hut we're certainly watching it very carefully," said
seismologist Kate Mutton of the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena.
No injuries were reported from the quake, which
measured 5.1 on the Richter scale and rumbled ac
ross parts of six counties and on into Mexico. It was
centered in the Santa Rosa Mountains near the vil
lage of Spring Crest. 120 miles east of Los Angeles,
and hit at 2:47 a.m.
