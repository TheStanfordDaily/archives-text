# Menlo Park officials miffed over University plan to construct hotel

### Richard Hefter Staff Writer 
Some Menlo Park city officials are
angry over purported misinformation
concerning the University's develop
ment plans in the Menlo Park area.
Councilmember James Bloch said
there is a "lark of communication bet
ween Stanford and Menlo Park" over
the University's plans to build a hotel in
the city, as well as 1600 units of housing
along Willow Road.
Stanford is leasing its land on El
Camino Real at the southern tip of
Menlo Park for the development of an
approximately 170-room hotel and re
staurant, according to the University's
Manager of Real Estate, John Breed

love.
Bloch said he was misinformed by
the University about the project. "My
understanding was a two-story, low
profile garden motel. Now, they're
planning a tour-story one ... with a
restaurant that creates a sewage prob
lem." he said.
Councilmember Gerry Andeen said
he was unaware of plans for the hotel
until late last December when a resi
dent asked him about it.
"The (city council) group with the
public responsibility for land-use deci
sions was in the dark." he said.
Andeen said he did not know
whether it was the University or the
city of Menlo Park that withheld the
information.
"I don't know whose responsibility it
was, but someone should have told
me," he said. "I wonder did somebody
purposely withhold that information
from me?"
Breedlove maintains that the Uni
versity properly informed Menlo Park
officials of its plans.
"I don't know why they're upset," he
said.
But Bloch said. "Why didn't some
one at Stanford pick up the phone and
ask me (why I'm upset)? All it takes is a

phone call. We can work out the motel
together."
Bloch said he is also displeased over
the University's announcement that
proposals will soon he initiated for de
veloping the University's 48 acres of
land along Willow Road. The multi
story housing, located in Palo Alto be
tween the Oak Creek Apartments and
the Children's Hospital, would back up
to Menlo Park homes.
"I first read about it in the papers,"
Bloch said. "The courteous thing
would have been to advise us first of
what had been contemplated."
Bloch expressed concern about a
statement made by University Vice
President for Business and Finance
William Massy at a recent Palo Alto
City Council meeting, in which Massy
was discussing the distance the Univer
sity housing would be from San Fran
cisquito Creek.
Three years ago, Menlo Park and the
University unofficially decided on a
90-foot setback. But at the Council
meeting Massy said while he is "think
ing along the lines of that kind of set
back." there is "no binding agree
ment" on the housing layout, according
to the Peninsula Times Tribune.
