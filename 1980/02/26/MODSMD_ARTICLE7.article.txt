Those detained were described as
"trained agents of the U.S., Britain,
China and Pakistan."

troops, backed by submachine-toting
civilian members of the ruling Khalq

throughout the city.

military commander in Kabul was, in

reprisals against Indian traders for

army tanks in large numbers were spot

Soviet demonstrations there.

tions reached here through an Indian
merchant. Santokh Singh, who fled to
