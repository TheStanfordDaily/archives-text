# Protests over charity sponsor
## Penthouse gets frats in doghouse 
### Kimberly Brown Staff Writer 
"No one is forcing anyone to read Penthouse. Just go
have a good time, drink their beer and burn their
magazine." — Vance Mason, Sigma Chi fraternity.
"It really bothers me when people say it's their right to
have a good party. I mean, that in itself is so trivial when
we're dealing with this sort of issue and and its consequ
ences." — Linda Gardner, Women's Center.
These two comments represent the poles of opinion
which have arisen concerning the Inter-Fraternity Council's
plan for a charity car wash and party. The controversy
concerns the proposed sponsor. Penthouse International,
Limited, the publishers of Penthouse magazine.
The event, scheduled for early April, consists of an all
day car wash, followed by a street party that night. Penth
ouse has offered to cover all costs incurred in exchange tor
promotional publicity. Its offer includes 100 kegs of beer, a
band and prizes given away by 'Penthouse Pets.'
Tonight's IFC meeting will determine the final outcome
of the issue. IFC president John Kinney said yesterday that
the original vote two weeks ago in which only three frater
nities opposed the event was tentative. An unexpected
amount of campus opposition led the IFC to reconsider the
matter, and according to Kinney, the chances that Penth
ouse will be making an appearance this spring are slim.
"I've spoken with a representative from each fraternity,
explaining the three main facets of the controversy," said
Kinney, "and now that they've all considered the moral as
well as the economic benefits and the dangers of offending
people, every one I've talked to has said he can understand
the implications of the situation."
Kinney has faced opposition from the Women's Center
over past weeks. Sunday afternoon about 15 participants
from Friday night's "Get Back the Night" march con
fronted him. The group was concerned with the IFC'sview
of the issue, and urged that the Penthouse offer be rejected
on a moral basis.
According to Kinney, "they want us to agree that Penth
ouse perpetuates violence, but I'll only go so far as to say
that its involvement with Stanford might offend a good
portion of the campus community."
USC, University of Texas and a number of other univer
sities have held similar car washes without incident.
However, Kinney has declined accepting the offer before
soliciting the University community's opinions.
According to Kinney, three years ago few people would
have questioned the offer. Today, however, Kinney said he
believes the University community is more concerned with
campus opinion. "When I told Penthouse that we couldn't
agree to their offer without getting some feedback, they

couldn't believe us," he said.
The idea was originally presented to the University's
fraternities about a month ago, when Kinney drew up a list
of pros and cons and had each house take a vote on the
issue. Eleven fraternities favored the proposal, while the
SAE, Theta Xi and Beta Theta Pi fraternities took opposing
stances. According to Kinney, all agreed Penthouse had
made an "incredible" offer, so the vote was based solely on
the event's possible side effects.
Meanwhile. Kinney met with representatives from the
Women's Center and the Center for Research on Women.
Both groups expressed concern over the proposal, stressing
their belief that the danger doesn't lie in the "Pets' being
offensive, but in Stanford's advertising for Penthouse — a
publication which, in their opinion, degrades women.
Kinney said, "We don't agree with their viewpoints. If we
did, we wouldn't be considering the offer. Their concern is
that Penthouse will be able to use Stanford's name. Our
concern is that we may insult or offend some people."
As for a general female consensus, Kinney admitted he
can only speculate. "Most say they're not 'personally' of
fended by the event but think others may be," he said.
Nancy Hoffman, president of the Inter-Sorority Council,
said that most of the women she has asked take a favorable
stance, or remain wary of the plans, maintaining that the
IFC is 'playing with fire.'
Hoffman said the ISC will not support the project.
Also, many fraternity members contacted said even
though the more outspoken women's groups constitute a
small percentage of the campus community, a silent major
ity of women also may be offended.
Most fraternity members, however, favor the Penthouse
carwash. Mason, of Sigma Chi, said trying to "change sexist
attitudes by attacking magazines like Penthouse trivializes
the women's rights movement. They should concentrate on
job equality and education.
A 1 Duanes, a member of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity,
agreed. "I don't have anything against Penthouse — I read
their magazine. In order to do the kind of censoring the
women's center is demanding, the world would have to
revamp its entire communications system."
John Julius of Phi Delta Theta and Kjnney have been
attempting to locate new sponsor possibilities. Among
those under consideration are Sports Illustrated, Coors and
Hewlett Packard. However, both feel that any sponsor has
its own drawbacks. One concern is that a switch of sponsors
may appear hypocritical and pointless, as there are always
going to be those groups on campus who disagree with
something, Kinney said.
