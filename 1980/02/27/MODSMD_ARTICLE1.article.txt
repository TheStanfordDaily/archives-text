# Carter, Reagan win New Hampshire primaries
## N.H. primary dims hopes for Kennedy 
### Martin Schram The Washington Post 
CONCORD, N.H. — In a single
night. New Hampshire rejuvenated the
faded fortune of Ronald Reagan and
all hut buried the once bright hopes of
Edward Kennedy.
Reagan can now ride his landslide
southward, looking like the front
runner he always thought he was. Even
George Bush's stunned advisers were
conceding that last night had wiped out
the lead their candidate had counted on
in next week's primaries in Mas
sachusetts and Vermont, and the fol
lowing week's contest in Florida —
"our best state in the South" — the
words of Bush campaign manager
James Baker.
It is conceivable that Republican
Bush, who still has plenty of campaign
money, may head into those states and
still give Reagan a good battle. But it
appears that Kennedy, whose cam
paign is virtually broke, has no good
place to go.
Kennedy can carry President Jimmy
Carter into the Kennedy family's home
state of Massachusetts and probably
score a victory, but that will impress no
one outside the state. After that comes
the South, which is Carter country, and
then comes Illinois, which once looked
like the place where Kennedy could
wrap up the nomination.
That was before the Carter
strategists stripped away most of his
potential support, leaving Kennedy
with only Chicago Mayor Jane Bryne
and remnants of her machine.
For the Democrats, the New Hamp
shire campaign followed a pattern of no
change. Kennedy waged campaign ef
forts that were uneven, arid could not
even make his major issues — anti
inflation controls on wages and prices
— catch on, despite the Carter ad
ministration's severe problems in hand
ling the economy.
But, if the Democratic race rep
resented no change, the Republican
race was something else.
The Republican primary was de
cided in the last days, when Ronald
Reagan built a political trap around a
debate and George Bush stepped into
it.
As New Hampshire saw it, Bush first
refused even to talk to his fellow candi
dates, then he did not debate them, and
finally he left the state three days be
fore the election, choosing not to cam
paign so that his organization could be
free to get out the vote.
All of this seemed to reinforce the
very image problem Bush has fought to
overcome: that he is just the sort of
preppie, Yalie, Skull and Bones Soci
ety fellow his biography says he is. All
of Bush's Republican opponents were
hollering that he was arrogant, and that
is the way it looked.
A contest all of the polls were show
ing as virtually even between Reagan
and Bush just days earlier suddenly
crumbled before the Bush advisers
knew what was happening to them.
And Ronald Reagan, who stayed in the
state and campaigned, found himself
sitting atop a landslide on election
night.
It was one of the classic miscalcula
tions of presidential politics, as griev
ous a series of errors in its own way as
Sen. Edmund Muskie's moment of cry
ing in the snow proved to his 1972
campaign.
