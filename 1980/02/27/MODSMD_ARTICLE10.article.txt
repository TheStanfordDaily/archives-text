# U.S. proposes arms sales to Egypt
## 
### Oswald Johnston The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON - The Un
ited Sutes will sell Egypt 250
M-60 Kinks and 40 advanced
I -lh lighters and lias agreed in
principle to sell 1-15 lighters
later on as part ol an ongoing
program ol aid to the Cairo gov -
ernment. the State Department
announced Monday.
The announcement, which
tormali/cd the emerging U.S.
role as Egypt's chief military
supplier in the wake ol the Camp
David accords and the Egypt-
Israel peace treaty. in effect gives
Egypt something it lias long de
sired — the same access to ad
vanced U.S. weaponry as Israel
enjoys.
The sales package is to he fi
nanced almost entirely through
$1.35 billion in military sales
credits proposed for Egypt in the
current fiscal year and in fiscal
19K1. It was negotiated in Cairo
last week hv a Pentagon team

headed hy Assistant Secretary of
Delense David E. McGiffert.
I he package "meets the needs
ot a friend committed to the
peace process in the region that
has major delense needs." State
Department spokesman Mod
ding Carter said.
The Egyptians, Carter said,
were told that the administration
was "ready to consider" sale of
the 1,-15 jet lighter, which is
emerging as the backbone ot Is
raeli air force planning lor the
current decade. But, he said.
Cairo "decided to postpone ac
tion on that offer" in order to
spend the limited funds available
to them on other, less costly
weapons more immediately av
ailable.
Small protest
lor this reason the Israelis,
who are expected to raise pro
lorma objections to the supply
ing ol advanced weapons to
Egypt, are not likely to press the
case too hard. The 40 h -1 hs. as a

practical matter, will not be in
Egypt's arsenal until after 19X2.
by which time Israel should have
a good proportion of the 75
I-16s it now has on order.
Israel has received 25 K-15s
out ol a total order of 40. and
Egypt's decision to postpone
buying that formidable airplane,
the most advanced now living,
will effectively tip the balance of
power in favor of Israel's air
loree lor years to come.
Officials denied that Egypt has
been pressed hy the McGiffert
mission to decide against the
1-15 for the time being. But in
formed sources said that the
White House virtually guaran
teed such a decision a lew weeks
ago when it vetoed a State De
partment plan toextend to Egypt
a guarantee of $S()() million a
year in military credits through
1956.
'Planning figure'
Instead ol the vetoed plan.
Egyptian defense planners were
told that they could count on no
more than $SOO million in fiscal
19N2 as a "planning figure." Is
rael recently has received one
billion dollars a year in military
sales credits Irom Washington,
l ilty percent of this debt is
routinely forgiven.
Monday's announcement in
effect confirmed reports last
week that McGiffert had offered
Egypt the same access to U.S.
tanks and tighter aircraft that Is
rael has enjoyed for more than a
decade.
Gen. Kemal Hassan Ali. the

Egyptian defense minister, last
Thursday told the Cairo news
paper Al Ahram that the U.S.
agreement to supply F-16 and
F-15 aircraft and \l-60 tanks
"will put Egypts on exactly equal
footing with Israel as far as ar
mament is concerned."
Access to U.S. weapons
technology had been held out by
President Anwar Sadat as one of
the tangible advantages of the
Camp David peace agreement
and the subsequent treaty with
Israel. Ali's claim, uncon
tradicted by Washington, should
give Sadat a political boost.
Saudi refusal
Saudi Arabia's refusal to pay
Egypt s arms bill, as it did bet
ween the 1973 war and the
Egypt-Israel treaty, had put in
limbo an Egyptian purchase of
5(1 F-5E aircraft from the United
States. But now Sadat can claim
to be receiving aircraft consider
ablv more advanced than the
1-5.
At the White House, mean
while. President Jimmy Carter
presented an extended reaffir
mation of U.S. support for Israel
to a visiting Jewish group, the
National Young Leadership
Conference ol the United Jewish
Appeal.
Carter repeated the standing
U.S. refusal to recognize or deal
with the Palestine Liberation
Organization until it accepts Is
rael's right to exist, and he re
peated his declared opposition to
establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.

year in military credits through
1956.
'Planning figure'
Instead ol the vetoed plan.
Egyptian defense planners were
told that they could count on no
more than $SOO million in fiscal
19N2 as a "planning figure." Is
rael recently has received one
billion dollars a year in military
sales credits Irom Washington,
l ilty percent of this debt is
routinely forgiven.
Monday's announcement in
effect confirmed reports last
week that McGiffert had offered
Egypt the same access to U.S.
tanks and tighter aircraft that Is
rael has enjoyed for more than a
decade.
Gen. Kemal Hassan Ali. the

Egyptian defense minister, last
Thursday told the Cairo news
paper Al Ahram that the U.S.
agreement to supply F-16 and
F-15 aircraft and \l-60 tanks
"will put Egypts on exactly equal
footing with Israel as far as ar
mament is concerned."
Access to U.S. weapons
technology had been held out by
President Anwar Sadat as one of
the tangible advantages of the
Camp David peace agreement
and the subsequent treaty with
Israel. Ali's claim, uncon
tradicted by Washington, should
give Sadat a political boost.
Saudi refusal
Saudi Arabia's refusal to pay
Egypt s arms bill, as it did bet
ween the 1973 war and the
Egypt-Israel treaty, had put in
limbo an Egyptian purchase of
5(1 F-5E aircraft from the United
States. But now Sadat can claim
to be receiving aircraft consider
ablv more advanced than the
1-5.
At the White House, mean
while. President Jimmy Carter
presented an extended reaffir
mation of U.S. support for Israel
to a visiting Jewish group, the
National Young Leadership
Conference ol the United Jewish
Appeal.
Carter repeated the standing
U.S. refusal to recognize or deal
with the Palestine Liberation
Organization until it accepts Is
rael's right to exist, and he re
peated his declared opposition to
establishment of an independent
Palestinian state.
WASHINGTON - The Un
ited Sutes will sell Egypt 250
M-60 Kinks and 40 advanced
I -lh lighters and lias agreed in
principle to sell 1-15 lighters
later on as part ol an ongoing
program ol aid to the Cairo gov -
ernment. the State Department
announced Monday.
The announcement, which
tormali/cd the emerging U.S.
role as Egypt's chief military
supplier in the wake ol the Camp
David accords and the Egypt-
Israel peace treaty. in effect gives
Egypt something it lias long de
sired — the same access to ad
vanced U.S. weaponry as Israel
enjoys.
The sales package is to he fi
nanced almost entirely through
$1.35 billion in military sales
credits proposed for Egypt in the
current fiscal year and in fiscal
19K1. It was negotiated in Cairo
last week hv a Pentagon team

headed hy Assistant Secretary of
Delense David E. McGiffert.
I he package "meets the needs
ot a friend committed to the
peace process in the region that
has major delense needs." State
Department spokesman Mod
ding Carter said.
The Egyptians, Carter said,
were told that the administration
was "ready to consider" sale of
the 1,-15 jet lighter, which is
emerging as the backbone ot Is
raeli air force planning lor the
current decade. But, he said.
Cairo "decided to postpone ac
tion on that offer" in order to
spend the limited funds available
to them on other, less costly
weapons more immediately av
ailable.
Small protest
lor this reason the Israelis,
who are expected to raise pro
lorma objections to the supply
ing ol advanced weapons to
Egypt, are not likely to press the
case too hard. The 40 h -1 hs. as a

practical matter, will not be in
Egypt's arsenal until after 19X2.
by which time Israel should have
a good proportion of the 75
I-16s it now has on order.
Israel has received 25 K-15s
out ol a total order of 40. and
Egypt's decision to postpone
buying that formidable airplane,
the most advanced now living,
will effectively tip the balance of
power in favor of Israel's air
loree lor years to come.
Officials denied that Egypt has
been pressed hy the McGiffert
mission to decide against the
1-15 for the time being. But in
formed sources said that the
White House virtually guaran
teed such a decision a lew weeks
ago when it vetoed a State De
partment plan toextend to Egypt
a guarantee of $S()() million a
year in military credits through
1956.
