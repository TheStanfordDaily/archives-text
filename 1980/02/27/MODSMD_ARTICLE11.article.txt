# Deng resigns from major military post
## 
### Linda Mathews The Los Angeles Times 
PEKING — Deng Xiaoping,
the driving force behind China's
modernization drive, has res
igned as army chief of staff, in
what is apparently the first step
toward his eventual retirement.
An official government
spokesman confirmed Monday
that Deng had recently stepped
down as chief of the 4-million
man Chinese army, in favor of an
experienced field general, Vang
De/hi. A Korean War hero.
Vang most recently commanded
the Kunmin military region, ad
jacent to Vietnam.
The move does not diminish
Deng's influence, for he retained
his other posts as vice chairman
ol the Chinese Communist
Party. deputy head of the party's
military affairs commission and
senior vice premier.
Chinese sources said Deng
personally instigated the shuffle,
apparently confident that he
could safely delegate respon

sibilities for the army to younger
men and concentrate on
economic affairs. Other recent
personnel moves have left com
manders with close personal and
political ties to Deng in complete
control of China's military estab
lishment.
•
The Guang/hou military
commander. Gen. Su Shiyou.
who protected Deng from his
radical critics by hiding him in
the mid 19705, has in the past
month been transferred to Pek
ing. Xu. now thought to be
supervising day-to-day military
operations, is touted as the suc
cessor to China's ailing defense
minister. Xu Xiangqian.
By stepping down, the 75-
year-old Deng may be trying to
set an example for other military
veterans and to overcome resis
tance to a new unpopular retire
ment program instituted late last
year. In an effort to revitalize the
army, hundreds ol aging com
manders have been forcibly re
tired or assigned to less strategic
posts. Seven of China's 1 1 reg
ional commands have changed
hands.
Unlike other Chinese leaders,
who cling to their offices until
their deathbeds, Deng has re
peatedly told visitors that he in
tends to retire by 1955. when he
will be SO. Until now. however,
his pledge to retire was largely
ignored or written off as false
modesty in a man who showed
no sign of slowing down.
Deng may be preparing tor his
retirement by moving others into
important party and government
posts where they can insure that
the policies he has enunciated
will survive him.
Bridge partner
Deng's friend and favorite
bridge partner, 112 In Yaobang, has
been installed as head of the par
ty s newly revived secretariat, in
charge ol managing party affairs.
I he chief of Sichuan Province,
/had Ziyang, a pragmatist like
Deng, will soon be summoned
to Peking as a vice premier and
likely contender for the premier
ship now held by Hua Guofeng.
Deng is thought to be in goojd
health, although he suffers from
arthritis and the related ailments
of old age.
Other personnel changes
could be announced shortly, for
according to informed sources,
the party's ruling Central Com
mittee opened a week-long ple
nary session on Saturday. The
meeting has not been mentioned
in the official press, but many
Chinese say it has been called to
purge the upper ranks of the
party of leftist politicians still
overcommitted to the discre
dited principles of the late Mao
Tse-tung.
