BOGOTA, Colombia — An influential Colom
bian research group has concluded that only the
legalizing of marijuana in both the United States
and Colombia can curb the corruption and
economic distortions that illicit production and ex
port ol the drug have caused here.
Last March, the conservative National Associa
tion of Financial Institutions made known its posi
tion at a two-day conference in Bogata. Experts
from both Colombia and the United States at
tended the session.
If marijuana were legalized, the association be
lieves the government would receive more than
$16K million a year in taxes rather than paying out
$100 million a year in the futile fight to control
production of the drug, according to the associa
tion's executive director, Ernesto Samper Pizano.
The association is a combination lobbying group
and think tank that prepared respected economic
and sociological studies on issues that affect both

its member hanks and the country as a whole.
A growing number of Colombians — ranging
from Enrique Santos Calderon. editor of Bogota's
leftist magazine Alternative, to Sen. Alvaro
Gome/, a leading Conservative Party member and
publisher of the capital's El Siglo newspaper —
agree with the association that the only way to
control the marijuana industry is to regulate it
rather than repress it.
The association does not believe, however, that
Colombia should legalize marijuana production
and sale until the United States does, agreeing with
U.S. Ambassador Diego C. Asencio that such a
step would put the country "beyond the pale" in
terms of its international image and reputation.
Despite the fact that I I American states have
decriminalized possession of small amounts of
marijuana. Ascencio points out that it is unlikely
that the United States will legalize the sale of the
drug in the near future.
