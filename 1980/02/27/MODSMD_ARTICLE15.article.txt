# Parental notification test case
## Supreme Court to rule on abortions 
### Jim Mann The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — She is identified in
Court papers only as H.L.. a woman from
Utah who attempted two years ago. at age
15. to have an abortion without telling her
parents about it.
But her lawsuit promises to become a test
case that could help determine the legal
rights of all minors who seek abortions. On
Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to
hear H.l .'s appeal in order to try to decide
whether states may demand that a minor's
parents be notified before she has an abor
tion.
H.L.'s doctor told her that, under Utah
law. he would be required to notil\ her pa
rents before performing the abortion. She
challenged the constitutionality of that law in
court — and. her lawyer says. also traveled to
another state with less restrictive laws to end
her pregnancy.
The issue raised by her case (H.L. vs.
Matheson. 79-5903) is one of the most sensi
tive in the running abortion controversy.
I'urental notification issue
Pro-abortion forces say some pregnant
teenagers are so fearful ol their parents' reac
tions that, if required to tell their parents
about plans for an abortion, they will simply
wait until it is too late to have one. "There
are instances where a parent might actually
harm the child it he or she found out." H.l ..'s
lawyer says.
Utah officials, however, defend their law
as one which merely makes sure that parents
retain their traditional responsibility over
their minor children. "To leave the parent in

total ignorance ol the proposed major
surgery upon a minor child still within the
parent's control and custody would be to ig
nore totally and completely the fundamental
notion ol the integrity ol the family unit."
Utah said in court papers.
The high court has already grappled on
two previous occasions with legal questions
concerning the rights of minors to have abor
tions. In both these instances, the justices
struck down state laws requiring minors to
get the consent of a parent or a judge before
having an abortion.
Unlike these other laws, however, the
11>74l l >74 Utah statute does not give any other
person a veto power over a minor's ability to
have an abortion. Instead, it simply requires
that, before performing an abortion on a
minor, the doetoi must notify her parents "it
physically possible."
Criminal sanctions
The law imposes criminal penalties — up
to a year in jail and a fine of $1000 — on
doctors who tail to comply. Only one other
state. Maine, has a similar law. but many
others could be expected to enact such legis
lation it the high court upholds the Utah
statute.
Il l .. the unidentified Utah teenager who
filed the case, is being represented by the
American Civ il L iberties Union. Her lawyer.
David S. Dolowit/'of Salt Lake City, said
Monday that the woman left Utah and had an
abortion elsewhere in 197<S after she was told
that il she had the abortion in Utah, her
parents would have to be informed.
"I don't know even now what il anything
her parents were told about her trip (to have

the abortion)." Dolowit/ said.
11 .L.'s suit was certified as a class action on
behalt ol all minor women seeking abortions
in Utah. Both a trial judge and the I tali
Supreme Court rejected the contention that
the law infringed 011 teenage women's rights
to privacy, but H.L. and Dolowit/ appealed
to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The justices will hear the case 111 the term
beginning next fall and will probably issue
their final decision in early IWI.
The action promises to keep the abortion
controversy ali\ e at the high court at least for
another year or so — and throughout an
election campaign in which some candidates
have been making abortion a prime issue.
Ever since the landmark 1973 ruling that
states cannot ban abortions in the first si\
months of a woman's pregnancy. the justices
have been lorced again and again to settle
important legal questions concerning the
scope of a woman's right to ha\ e an abortion.
Last week, the justices decided 6-3 to re
quire the federal government to begin paying
for poor women's abortions again; at least for
the next few months, while the court tries to
decide whether Congress may cut oil
Medicaid funds for abortions.
That action, though it has only temporary
effect, led to an attack on the Supreme C 'ourl
by former (iov Ronald Reagan ol Califor
nia. The C i()P presidential candidate accused
the justices of "an abuse ol power as bad as
Watergate" 111 deciding to order federal
funding ol abortions.
