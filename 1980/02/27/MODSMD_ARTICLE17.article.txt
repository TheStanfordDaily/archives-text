"lf the Soviets reali/e that the
terms ot detente do not include
pounding people over the head
on a regular basis." relations be
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union will improve, ac
cording to Morey Sehapira. Pres
ident ol the Bay Area Council on
Soviet Jewry, at a panel discus
sion held Thursday night in the
Meyer Forum Room.
Sehapira and Sidney Drell.
Deputy Director of SI.AC. were
the featured speakers on the
evening's topic, human rights
and Soviet policy.
"Detente is not dead," Sehap
ira said. "In the longer term, the
Soviets probably will be forced
to closer cooperation with the
U. 5.," he added.
Sehapira cited Soviet need for
\merican technology and desire
lor U.S. consumer goods as fac
tors that would bring about re
newed cohesiveness between the
two countries.
In addition, he said that a
growing energy shortfall in the
So\ iet Union as well as a consis
tent fear of China would also
tighten U.S.-Soviet ties.
I'he current period is a critical
one for the U.S.S.R.. Sehapira
said. There appears to be an on
going shift in Soviet leadership,
he said. Members ol the new
right are like "vultures circling
over Brezhnev." who is an aginu

statesman and appears to he hav -
my health problems. Sehapira
said.
I he inereased repression ot
dissidents within the Soviet
Union is an outgrowth ol hoth
internal factors and of the world
situation, he said.
In addition to the rightward
shitt ot Soviet policy, the ap
proaching Olympic games have
brought about the arrests ot
many dissidents. Sehapira said.
The Soviets would not like to
has e them around tor the games,
he said.
The arrest ot human rights de
fender Andrei Sakharov 111 par
ticular was a way to get back at
Jimmy Carter in an election year.
Sehapira said. Sukharov was
termed a "living saint" bv Drcll.
who is a "close friend" ot the
"father of the Soviet hydrogen
bomb."
Carter wrote Sakharov a per

sonal letter ot support, which
constituted a "great challenge to
Soviet leaders." said Sehapira.
Sakharov.a Nobel Peace Prize
winner, has brought attention to
the problem ol political prison
ers within the Soviet Union.
Drell said.
"He stands on the threshhold
of great peril." he said.
Sukharov. who has been exiled in
the closed city of Gorky, could
have his membership in the
Soviet Academy of Sciences re
voked by a vote of that body
which will take place in March,
Drell said.
Sukharov's membership in the
Academy is his "last shred ot
protection" from possible execu
tion, he said.
Should that body ot scientists
expel Sukharov from its ranks,
the ties of cooperation between
U.S. and Soviet scientists will
dissolve. Drell said.

•"Holding the Olympics in
Moscow is the moral equivalent
of holding the Olympics in Berlin
in 1936." Schapira said.
He cited the persecution of
human rights activists such as
Sakharov and increasing anti-
Semitism as parallels between
the two states.
The U.S. should respond to
the increased persecution of dis
sidents like Sakharov with a pol
icy "consistently supported by
the broad base of the American
people." Schapira said. "Other
wise the Soviets might get the
wrong signals." he added.
"Individuals must let the
Soviet government know, they
must let the American govern
ment know, that we still care"
about the persecuted citizens in
the U.S.S.R.. Schapira said.
"Things are serious; we are
concerned, but I believe that in
the long term our efforts will
make a difference." he said.

wise the Soviets might get the
wrong signals." he added.
"Individuals must let the
Soviet government know, they
must let the American govern
ment know, that we still care"
about the persecuted citizens in
the U.S.S.R.. Schapira said.
"Things are serious; we are
concerned, but I believe that in
the long term our efforts will
make a difference." he said.
"lf the Soviets reali/e that the
terms ot detente do not include
pounding people over the head
on a regular basis." relations be
tween the United States and the
Soviet Union will improve, ac
cording to Morey Sehapira. Pres
ident ol the Bay Area Council on
Soviet Jewry, at a panel discus
sion held Thursday night in the
Meyer Forum Room.
Sehapira and Sidney Drell.
Deputy Director of SI.AC. were
the featured speakers on the
evening's topic, human rights
and Soviet policy.
"Detente is not dead," Sehap
ira said. "In the longer term, the
Soviets probably will be forced
to closer cooperation with the
U. 5.," he added.
Sehapira cited Soviet need for
\merican technology and desire
lor U.S. consumer goods as fac
tors that would bring about re
newed cohesiveness between the
two countries.
In addition, he said that a
growing energy shortfall in the
So\ iet Union as well as a consis
tent fear of China would also
tighten U.S.-Soviet ties.
I'he current period is a critical
one for the U.S.S.R.. Sehapira
said. There appears to be an on
going shift in Soviet leadership,
he said. Members ol the new
right are like "vultures circling
over Brezhnev." who is an aginu

statesman and appears to he hav -
my health problems. Sehapira
said.
I he inereased repression ot
dissidents within the Soviet
Union is an outgrowth ol hoth
internal factors and of the world
situation, he said.
In addition to the rightward
shitt ot Soviet policy, the ap
proaching Olympic games have
brought about the arrests ot
many dissidents. Sehapira said.
The Soviets would not like to
has e them around tor the games,
he said.
The arrest ot human rights de
fender Andrei Sakharov 111 par
ticular was a way to get back at
Jimmy Carter in an election year.
Sehapira said. Sukharov was
termed a "living saint" bv Drcll.
who is a "close friend" ot the
"father of the Soviet hydrogen
bomb."
Carter wrote Sakharov a per

sonal letter ot support, which
constituted a "great challenge to
Soviet leaders." said Sehapira.
Sakharov.a Nobel Peace Prize
winner, has brought attention to
the problem ol political prison
ers within the Soviet Union.
Drell said.
"He stands on the threshhold
of great peril." he said.
Sukharov. who has been exiled in
the closed city of Gorky, could
have his membership in the
Soviet Academy of Sciences re
voked by a vote of that body
which will take place in March,
Drell said.
Sukharov's membership in the
Academy is his "last shred ot
protection" from possible execu
tion, he said.
Should that body ot scientists
expel Sukharov from its ranks,
the ties of cooperation between
U.S. and Soviet scientists will
dissolve. Drell said.

•"Holding the Olympics in
Moscow is the moral equivalent
of holding the Olympics in Berlin
in 1936." Schapira said.
He cited the persecution of
human rights activists such as
Sakharov and increasing anti-
Semitism as parallels between
the two states.
The U.S. should respond to
the increased persecution of dis
sidents like Sakharov with a pol
icy "consistently supported by
the broad base of the American
people." Schapira said. "Other
wise the Soviets might get the
wrong signals." he added.
"Individuals must let the
Soviet government know, they
must let the American govern
ment know, that we still care"
about the persecuted citizens in
the U.S.S.R.. Schapira said.
"Things are serious; we are
concerned, but I believe that in
the long term our efforts will
make a difference." he said.
