## 
### Dick Zander Newsday 
NEW YORK — Surprising
some of his closest friends and
associates, 75-year-old Sen.
Jacob Javits (R / N.Y.). an
nounced Monday that, despite a
progressive muscle disease that
might affect his campaigning, he
will seek re-election to a fifth
term.
Javits said the ailment, which
he labeled "motor neuron" dis
ease. could hinder his walking.
Medical authorities said that
motor neuron could be a serious
and debilitating disease depend
ing upon the stage of develop
ment in a patient.
But the senator said doctors
have told him that the disease —
which he has had for about IK
months — was "indolent" in his
case. He would not have under
taken the race. Javits said, if he
thought Ins physical condition
would affect his chances of wi'V
ning. "My brain, my memory
and my ability to communicate
are as sharp as ever." Ja\ its said.
Javits" physician. Dr. Jerome
I'osner of the Sloan-Kettering
Institute, said Javits had "a
slightly different form" ol the

degenerative disease that
claimed the life of Yankee
baseball star Lou Gehrig. Posner
called Javits' illness"very slowly
progressive" and said that based
on his observation over eight
months, "the rate of progress has
been sufficiently slow" to indi
cate that Javits could serve a
six-year term. "It doesn't affect
the brain," Posner said'.
Ja\ its appeared to cherish the
suspense he had developed
about the campaign decision,
which was delayed earlier this
month. Me didn't drop the tinal
shoe until the end of the press
conference and a l()-minute re
\iew of the decision, and he was
interrupted by yelps ol joy from
Iriends and staff members.
The senator, viewed by many
as the last symbol of liberal Re
publicanism. had little to say
about prospects of a GOP prim
ary in September, which would
be his lust in the 24 years he has
served in the Senate.
"Once I decide to run. I expect
everything." he said. State GOP
Chairman Bernard Kilbourn
said he thought Javits' decision
was "good for the nation, the
state and the party." Kilbourn

said that in the next lew days he
hoped to talk to potential GOP
challengers "about the realism of
running" a statewide primary. "I
don't know too many county
chairmen who have said they are
against Senator Javits." he said.
After Javits' announcement,
State Conservative Chairman J.
Daniel Mahoney declared that
his party's state committee
would meet March 22 to name a
senatorial candidate, a Republi
can who would run in a GOP
primary against Javits. "We are
determined to mobilize the par
ty's resources behind the
strongest Republican primary
opponent to Senator Javits as
early as possible." Mahoney
said.
