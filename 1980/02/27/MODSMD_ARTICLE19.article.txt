# End 'my country, right or wrong'
## 
### 
Ol the main phrases that re
gistered national I'eelings during
the \ letnam war. one ol the
more interesting was "my coun
try. right or wrong." The ques
tion is. what did all those people
who spouted this phrase or
pasted it on their possessions
mean In "tin country?"
We have come to the conclu
sion. altei all these sears, that
"my country" probably didn't
mean the nation's leaders or the
majority ol the population. It
would take a particularly twisted
mind to hold that the standard ol
morality is what Richard Nixon
saysoi what most people happen
to be doing. Rather, "my coun
try' must mean certain Ameri
can institutions that should he
preserved e\en through actions
that are sometimes "wrong."
We can understand this, lo
some extent we can even agree
with it. The world is ;i complex
place, and sometimes one nuisi
participate in one kind ol wrong
to prevent another.
However. Americans must be
v cry carelul with this philosophy.
Maybe some ot our institutions
are worth killing millions ol
people lor. It does not lollovv
that all ol our institutions are this
important.
That's what was. and still is so
dangerous about "my country,
right 01 wrong." This phrase

urges lis to conclude, lor exam
ple. that whatever our country
happens to be is worth fighting
lor. worth killing people for. As
main have recently commented
i)n the "Carter Doctrine." the
contention that we should be wil
ling to go to war to protect oui
wasteful habits ol petroleum
usage is nothing short ol appal
ling.
Sadly, "my country, right 01
wrong" seems still to be with us.
and not just in the area ol foreign
policy.
Suppose, j 11 st suppose, the au
thors feel that certain sectors ol
our "free enterprise economic
system" no longer woi k. that the
goal of ever-higher profits is not
leading to the most eflicient
utilization ol our society's re
sources. Suppose we maintain
I lit"the i that this system is creat
ing pov ci ty at the same time as u
creates wealth, both here and in
the rest ol the world.
Why will many readers con
clude Irom our opinions that we
don't like America? Do these
readersleel that America is a set
ol economic institutions? Do
they leel that it is "unpatriotic"
to eritici/e those institutions
simply because they are present
in America?
Behind the "patriotic" laitli 111
\ meriea lies the assumption thai
we are living in a political and

economic system thai is Ciod's
answer lo all social problems.
I hus. the business of govern
ment. or rather politics, is not lo
build America but to administer
to it Irom the original master
plan America is io be preserved
rather than continually rede-

signed.
I lie results ol iliis notion are
widespread, and it is hard to see
liovv anyone could consider them
beneficial. I or example, surely a
large part ol the voter apatln
that is apparent in this country
can be blamed on the "preserv
ing America" philosophy. Who
needs to join in and help to build
America when it has already
been built?
Another phenomenon influ
enced by this outlook is our na
tion s political debate, which
languishes Irom a lack ol innova
tive solutions to new problems

while our politicians piously as
sure us that "the American sys
tem can be made to work again,
even it 10 percent ol the people
can't.
But beneath the rhetoric ol
"preserving America." decisions
and adaptations are being made.

as indeed they must be. II the
directions our society follows in
the future with regard to the vital
issues of economics, energy and
loreign policy are not charted hv
the electorate, they will be up to
someone else. \nd to the extent
that the latter happens, we will
have preserved our democratic
institutions at the expense ol our
democracy

Ol the main phrases that re
gistered national I'eelings during
the \ letnam war. one ol the
more interesting was "my coun
try. right or wrong." The ques
tion is. what did all those people
who spouted this phrase or
pasted it on their possessions
mean In "tin country?"
We have come to the conclu
sion. altei all these sears, that
"my country" probably didn't
mean the nation's leaders or the
majority ol the population. It
would take a particularly twisted
mind to hold that the standard ol
morality is what Richard Nixon
saysoi what most people happen
to be doing. Rather, "my coun
try' must mean certain Ameri
can institutions that should he
preserved e\en through actions
that are sometimes "wrong."
We can understand this, lo
some extent we can even agree
with it. The world is ;i complex
place, and sometimes one nuisi
participate in one kind ol wrong
to prevent another.
However. Americans must be
v cry carelul with this philosophy.
