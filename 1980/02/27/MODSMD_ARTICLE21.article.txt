Keep us aware
I am writing to thank you lor
printing ;i I rout page article List
week concerning the girl who
had been attacked in front ot
Wilbur I hill alter dark
Too main ol us try to ignore
the possibility ol being "mug
ged" by rationali/ing"thingslikc
that don't happen around here"
or' l'm sale near the dorms." but
your article carries home the lact
that this is not the case.
Too olten. unpleasant events
like this are played down and
forgotten, but 1 think it is impor
tant to keep people aware that
things like this are happening on
campus, not lor the sake of sen
sationalism. but just to keep us
all aware and perhaps a bit more
cautious.
Keep up the good work!

Carwash opposed
Kudos to John Kinney. Inter-
I ratermty Council president, lor
realizing that a carwash spon
sored by Penthouse magazine
could be offensive to some
memebers of the Stanford com
munity and for soliciting opin
ions before accepting the offer
(Daily. Feb. 1 I ). We really ap
preciate such awareness and
concern.
It might not be obvious to
many people how a lew Penth
ouse "girls" on campus could be
oppressive to women. .We
wouldn't consider it anything
more than a slightly nonicexam
ple of big business soliciting con
tributions to charity I rom priv ate
individuals il tins event weren't
part ol a larger pattern.
I lie pattern, far more than the
individual instances, is oppres
sive. That's why one Penthouse

kegger is more than just a harm
less diversion.
It publicizes a magazine which
perpetuates the myth that
women exist for the pleasure of
men. that women must be beaut
iful to he desirable, and that
women are the objects ol a sex
drive rather than whole people.
Discrimination becomes obvi
ous only aftei one examines
many specific examples, but the
liulil against discrimination be
gins with opposing a single
example.

Music mixed-up
In reference to the review of
the The Specials. (Daily, Feb.
21) the author apparently does
not know what he is talking ab

out. He said. "The Specials play
a brand ol music called "ska."
which is a surprisingly pleasant
fusion of reggae and 'New
Wave."
Ska was a style ol music popu
lar in. and native to Jamaica in
the early '60s. Reggae evolved
from ska. with an intermediate
period of the "rock steady" or
"bluebeat" style. True. The Spe
cials incorporate the ska-type
beat in some of their songs, but
to say ska is a "fusion" ol reggae
and New Wave is erroneous.
