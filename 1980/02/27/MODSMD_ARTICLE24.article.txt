# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Mark Boehm Prepare to defend allies 
### 
I am becoming quite fatigued reading about
American imperialism and improprieties while the
Soviet Union and its proxy troops continue to in
vade countries and kill people to get their
ideologies across. I am upset that some people can
see tin reason for being prepared to act with force,
il necessary, when these aggressions affect our al
lies and vital interest.
Having to use force is something that no man
wants, but that becomes necessary when aggres
sion harms the liberties or lives of anyone. If one is
not prepared to defend allies or outside interests,
when does one consider the use of force? Does it
take tanks tearing up one's backyard to cause him
to rise to action? When does one decide that any
country or its population is expendable? Is a life
worth less if it is an Afghan's, or aren't lives worth
fighting for anymore?
Contrary to recent artielesin The Stanford Daily,
there are indeed times when preparedness for war
becomes necessary. Regardless of how long ago
one's Vietnam complex was created, the ability to
be able to clearly see potential dangers and to react
to them is essential.
Problems do not end unless one puts up a con
certed effort to end them, and this may require
military means. Wars do indeed have the ability to
provide solutions to unacceptable situations, and
do not necessarily compound problems (e.g. the
American Revolution and World War II).
The trouble today is that an isolationist attitude
caused by our humiliation in Vietnam has obscured
the idea that it is sometimes necessary to have a
military option available. We have forgotten that
wcare a superpower, and we are indeed obligated
to defend our interests, or get blown away.
It has been stated in a recent Daily column that
our military actions are carried out at the expense
ol citizens' basic freedoms. What is odd is that
scarcely a word in protest is spoken over the Soviet
Union's usurping all rights (and a few lives) in their
invasion of Afghanistan. Southeast Asia and Af
rica â€” the latter by surrogate Soviet troops. Is

registration of citizens tor defense preparedness
unwise with such actions occurring around the
world?
We are not drafting people; we are registering so
we can he prepared in case of trouble. This seems
much less an atrocity than mass murder in Af
ghanistan and Southeast Asia, yet these actions are
rarely protested in the Daily.
The suggestion that America is not keeping the
spirit of detente due to a "spiraling defense
budget" is ludicrous. In terms of real dollars, after
inflation, the United States has continually de
creased its spending over the last 10 years, while
the Soviet Union has steadily increased its spend
ing.
Who is not keeping the spirit of detente? Who is
currently at war. or warring by proxy 011 at least
three continents? Perhaps it is the Soviet Union
that is making a mockery of detente, and making
fools of those still paranoid about the Vietnam
quagmire.
It is time for these people to wake up and see the
world as it really is. No one is going to defend our
allies or interests for us. It we wish to have any left,
we must be willing and prepared to use any option
including a military one to do so. Consider for a
moment where we would be, and what liberties we
would have today, had we not been prepared and
willing at the time of the Revolutionary War. or
while Hitler was in Europe.
It should be evident that those freedoms fought
so hard for in the past are still worth defending
today. Rhetoric.optimism and simple-minded hope
will not stop any armies: they may actually invite
them.
I for one do not intend to let those with a left
over Vietnam guilt complex throw away the free
doms which they so readily take advantage of. and
obscure the need for prudent economic, political,
or military preparedness for defense of our vital
interests.
