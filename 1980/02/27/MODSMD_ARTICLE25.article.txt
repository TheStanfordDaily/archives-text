## Taiwan natives repressed 
### 
Earlier this month, 50 law professors from Stan
ford iind Berkeley sent a telegram to Taiwan's
President Chiang Ching-Kuo protesting the mas
sive arrest of opposition political leaders. They
were arrested following an inconspicuous political
rally held on Dec. 10, 1979, to celebrate the "in
ternational human rights day." The entire leader
ship of the opposition to the ruling Chinese
Nationalist Party was decimated. This month their
court-martial began.
Taiwan is an interesting political "entity. To label
the island Nationalist China (in contrast to the
widely recognized People's Republic of China) is a
mere simplification. The country is run by a ruling
elite that fled the communist takeover of the main
land. Comprising less than 15 percent of the is
land's 1 8 million people, they exercise a repressive
and often brutal rule over the native Taiwanese.
The political movements are aligned along national
background with the opposition consisting almost
entirely of native Taiwanese.
The island, long a province of mainland China,
served traditionally as a haven for refugees from
the frequent upheavals on the mainland. The col
lapse of the Ming dynasty around I 650 produced a
ma jor wave of inhabitants and the last 1 00 years of
the Manchu d\nasty(l9th century) also added to
the population.
I ilipinos and Malays, intermixed with the
Chinese, complete the makeup of "native"
Taiwanese.
At the outset of the first Sino-Japanese war in
I<S95. the island was awarded to the victorious
Japanese who exercised control over it through the
end of World W;ir 11. The Cairo Conference de
cided that Taiwan should be returned to China in
the event of an Allied victory.
In the meantime, the mainland was the stage of
monumental events. A revolution in 1911 estab
lished a Republic of China under the Nationalist
leader Sun Yat-sen. Generals of the Manchu
dynasty retreated to the north establishing them
selves as warlords in various parts of the country. A
civil war ensued.
The success of the Russian Bolshevik revolution
had a major effect upon its southern neighbor. The
precepts of communism found fertile ground
among many young Chinese, including two mem
bers of the Nationalist Party named MaoTse-tung
and Zhou Enlai. Chief of staff of the armed forces

of the same party was General Chiang Kai-shek.
An unavoidable rift between Chiang and the
politically charged communists came in the late
'20s. The communists escaped to Kiangse pro
vince. organized a revolutionary Red Army and
withstood five major attacks by Chiang. The l ong
March of 1935 to Yenan. in northern China, was
the result of a devastated communist army.
Japan was not an idle spectator of the Chinese
civil war. She occupied Manchuria in 1931 and insti
gated the second Sino-Chinese War in 1937. Not
until the conclusion of World War II did Japan's
influence end.
A reorganized communist army, taking advan
tage of military, but primarily social, opportunities
defeated Chiang's forces and compelled him to
lice. In 1949 the "legitimate" government of all
China found itself on the island of Taiwan.
Chiang brought with him the "Nanking Con
gress" which, although a shadow of its former self
(time has taken its toll), still enacts legislation as
though it exercises jurisdiction over all China.
These people still nurture the illusion of a return to
Peking. The result is repression of the native
Taiwanese by means of stiff martial law. The main
landers exercise control over every vital branch of
government, the police, army and the feared and
omnipresent secret police.
More obvious is their rule over the financial
sector. Most organizations and corporations are
run by mainland Chinese. Taiwanese are delegated
to second rate status. Yet the idea of an unavoida
ble communist takeover is widespread.
Huge sums of money have been tunneled out ol
the country by the ruling Nationalists. Their chil
dren live abroad, and it is not unusual for mil
lionaire Chinese to reside in rented quarters in
Taipei.
China Airlines, owned by Chiang interests, will
serve as an escape vessel upon emergency.
Young Taiwanese are anxious about their situa
tion. The lack of recognition of the country by the
world at large and the age of the nationalist elite
can only accelerate events. The sinking govern
ment struggles to keep afloat by increased repres
sion, and the trial of the opposition leaders is just
one of a number of measures aimed at sustaining a
gross anachronism.

land. Comprising less than 15 percent of the is
land's 1 8 million people, they exercise a repressive
and often brutal rule over the native Taiwanese.
The political movements are aligned along national
background with the opposition consisting almost
entirely of native Taiwanese.
The island, long a province of mainland China,
served traditionally as a haven for refugees from
the frequent upheavals on the mainland. The col
lapse of the Ming dynasty around I 650 produced a
ma jor wave of inhabitants and the last 1 00 years of
the Manchu d\nasty(l9th century) also added to
the population.
I ilipinos and Malays, intermixed with the
Chinese, complete the makeup of "native"
Taiwanese.
At the outset of the first Sino-Japanese war in
I<S95. the island was awarded to the victorious
Japanese who exercised control over it through the
end of World W;ir 11. The Cairo Conference de
cided that Taiwan should be returned to China in
the event of an Allied victory.
In the meantime, the mainland was the stage of
monumental events. A revolution in 1911 estab
lished a Republic of China under the Nationalist
leader Sun Yat-sen. Generals of the Manchu
dynasty retreated to the north establishing them
selves as warlords in various parts of the country. A
civil war ensued.
The success of the Russian Bolshevik revolution
had a major effect upon its southern neighbor. The
precepts of communism found fertile ground
among many young Chinese, including two mem
bers of the Nationalist Party named MaoTse-tung
and Zhou Enlai. Chief of staff of the armed forces

of the same party was General Chiang Kai-shek.
An unavoidable rift between Chiang and the
politically charged communists came in the late
'20s. The communists escaped to Kiangse pro
vince. organized a revolutionary Red Army and
withstood five major attacks by Chiang. The l ong
March of 1935 to Yenan. in northern China, was
the result of a devastated communist army.
Japan was not an idle spectator of the Chinese
civil war. She occupied Manchuria in 1931 and insti
gated the second Sino-Chinese War in 1937. Not
until the conclusion of World War II did Japan's
influence end.
A reorganized communist army, taking advan
tage of military, but primarily social, opportunities
defeated Chiang's forces and compelled him to
lice. In 1949 the "legitimate" government of all
China found itself on the island of Taiwan.
Chiang brought with him the "Nanking Con
gress" which, although a shadow of its former self
(time has taken its toll), still enacts legislation as
though it exercises jurisdiction over all China.
These people still nurture the illusion of a return to
Peking. The result is repression of the native
Taiwanese by means of stiff martial law. The main
landers exercise control over every vital branch of
government, the police, army and the feared and
omnipresent secret police.
More obvious is their rule over the financial
sector. Most organizations and corporations are
run by mainland Chinese. Taiwanese are delegated
to second rate status. Yet the idea of an unavoida
ble communist takeover is widespread.
Huge sums of money have been tunneled out ol
the country by the ruling Nationalists. Their chil
dren live abroad, and it is not unusual for mil
lionaire Chinese to reside in rented quarters in
Taipei.
China Airlines, owned by Chiang interests, will
serve as an escape vessel upon emergency.
Young Taiwanese are anxious about their situa
tion. The lack of recognition of the country by the
world at large and the age of the nationalist elite
can only accelerate events. The sinking govern
ment struggles to keep afloat by increased repres
sion, and the trial of the opposition leaders is just
one of a number of measures aimed at sustaining a
gross anachronism.

Earlier this month, 50 law professors from Stan
ford iind Berkeley sent a telegram to Taiwan's
President Chiang Ching-Kuo protesting the mas
sive arrest of opposition political leaders. They
were arrested following an inconspicuous political
rally held on Dec. 10, 1979, to celebrate the "in
ternational human rights day." The entire leader
ship of the opposition to the ruling Chinese
Nationalist Party was decimated. This month their
court-martial began.
Taiwan is an interesting political "entity. To label
the island Nationalist China (in contrast to the
widely recognized People's Republic of China) is a
mere simplification. The country is run by a ruling
elite that fled the communist takeover of the main
land. Comprising less than 15 percent of the is
land's 1 8 million people, they exercise a repressive
and often brutal rule over the native Taiwanese.
