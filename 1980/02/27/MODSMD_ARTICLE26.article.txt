## Fight the lie that forced sex isn't feared 
### 
Last Friday evening I saw a slide show
compiled by a group ot women who be
lieve that media portrayals of sexual
abuses and other violence to women con
tribute to the perpetuation of such acts.
The program drew material from a variety
of sources and included at least two items
from Penthouse.
The first was a cartoon of a woman
slouched against a fence under the night
sky. city buildings in the background. Her
clothing had been torn away from her. In
the foreground was a man. stalking away
from the scene as he fastened his pants.
The caption read. "Encore!"
I chuckled. Then I wondered. "What
was funny?" Did I imagine my sister in
such circumstances, raped and begging
lor more? What about the women I've
loved and or lived with? Or the woman It)
my left, who came that evening to march
m the streets with a hundred friends be
cause she is afraid to be out at night
alone? What woman do I know whom I
can imagine responding to rape with a cry
lor more?
1 write this the next morning, still un
able to think of a single person.
So win did I laugh? Where did I learn

such a sense ot humor? I remember being
an eight-year-old in the park, listening to
the guys in their teens brag of sexual
exploits with women who began by pro
testing and ended up begging lor more. At
the time I was eager to believe.
Already I had experienced the coyness
of my female counterparts; already I had
come to understand that sexual initiative
was mine; already I understood the world
in which I lived to he one in which males
said. "Please!" and females,"No!" What
idea more perfect than, "No means yes?"
A few years later when I was I 1 or 1 2,
ragged copies of Playboy and even
harder-core porn began making their way
from older brothers into my circle of
friends.
Soon I was experimenting with the
young women I knew, and indeed, "no"
turned out to be negotiable. So I reasoned
and cajoled, and sometimes I continued
after the almost inevitable no. and they
pushed me away or yelled at me. In this
manner I passed 10 years of adolescence
and early adulthood.
I look back over the sexual experiences
ol 20 years and see everywhere the
shadow of female fear and male misin

formation. I realize what a bar to mutual
pleasure these things have posed to me
and my partners, and I wonder how it is
for you.
Do you believe that "no" means "yes?"
How do your friends feel? To men in par
ticular I ask, "Suppose you're hitchhik
ing. and are picked up by some guy who
puts his hand on your leg after you're in
the car. Does 'no' mean 'yes?' Howwill
you feel if he's much bigger and stronger
than you?"
The problem with the Penthouse car
toon mentioned above is that it tells a lie.
Without exception, both the women and
the men I know say they do not want sex
forced upon them. The price of this lie is
not just the criminal rape that occurs
every few minutes: it is the fear and mis
understanding that characterize your and
my sexual relations â€” not just our inter
course and eroticism, but all our relations
with members of the opposite sex. Believ
ing this lie, we have the consciousness of
rapists; force becomes appropriate in
sexual relations; fear among women,
pandemic.
By refusing to cooperate in promoting a
publication which portrays rape as

humorous by publicly stating our opposi
tion to everything which supports the lie
that women arc incapable of expressing
their will in sexual matters. we can at
the very least demonstrate to each other
our mutual respect.
I am not advocating the destruction of
Penthouse as a business enterprise, any
more than students who press for cur
riculum reform are advocating the de
struction of the University.
I am simply asking that all of us con
sider carefully the consequences of sup
porting a publication that portrays
women as the victims of violent force
without critically examining the social re
lations and personal values from which
such incidents are born. If you agree that
the lies inherent in such representations
exert unwanted limits on your own ability
to live freely, withdraw your support and
encourage others to do so.
II charity is our goal, then let's select a
charity and serve it. If a party is what we
want, let's have a party. Either of these
ends can be attained without selling our
selves to the purveyors of violence and
abuse.
