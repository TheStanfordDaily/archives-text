# Carter campaign unscathed
## Heating oil a non-issue in N. H. 
### Judith Bender Newsday 
WAS! iINGTON — Last fall, the conven
tional political wisdom was that skyrocketing
heating oil prices would devastate President
Jimmy Carter in the New Hampshire prim
ary. In the opinion polls, it was hard to find a
Carter supporter in the state.
But several factors changed that situation
drastically, including milder-than-usual
temperatures and the seizure of the U.S.
Embassy in Iran.
As a result, despite a jump in oil prices of
65 percent in a year, the cost of heating oil
has become a forgotten issue in the
primaries.
Most politicians — even those in the Car
ter camp — do not believe the heating oil
price issue, or other poeketbook issues, will
continue to be subdued.
•'lnflation will remain a dominant issue in
the campaign." said Robert Neuman, deputy
Democratic national chairman. It is just a
matter of time before it resurfaces, the politi
cal experts say.
But. in New I lampshire. the oil price issue

broke the right way for the president.
I irst. Carter made good on his promise of
last year that the Northeast would have
enough heating oil. That was an overriding
goal of the administration going into the
primary season, according to Democratic
National Chairman John White.
Second. New Hampshire has had unsea
sonably mild weather, with temperatures 14
percent warmer than last year, on the aver
age, according to New Hampshire Energy
Office Director William llumnt. I lie Carter
camp had prayed for no snow, according to
Carter aide Ellis Woodward.
Third, many voters blame the energy situa
tion less on the president than on the oil
companies or on OPEC members, interviews
with New Hampshire residents and cam
paign aides suggest.
Perhaps most important, the Iran hostage
situation, coupled with the Soviet move into
Afghanistan, has meant a national rallying to
Carter. "It's the hostages and people wa\ nig
the flag." said Joseph Crangle ol Erie
County. N.Y.. a top political aide to Sen.
Edward Kennedy. "The sooner it's over, the

better off we'll he. Two or three months from
now people will he looking at it differently."
If heating oil or gasoline prices were not
the hot issues many thought they'd be. some
candidates notably. Kennedy. California
(io\ Jerry Brown and Rep. John Anderson
of Illinois — were hoping that other energy
issues could still become a major factor in
New Hampshire. And. il not there, then later
in other states.
Generally. the field ol Republican candi
dates conies out strongly fordecontrolling oil
prices and encouraging domestic production
ol oil and gas — all standard GOP
philosophy and the reason the Republicans
have been unable to criticize Carter on de
control — though there are some differences
on other energy issues.
It is the Democratic candidates who offer
the sharpest conflicts — but. again, the price
ol oil has not gotten much attention in the
campaign. "It might have been an issue if
we'd had more snow up here." said Victoria
/actios ol Concord, a Republican national
committeevvonian. "lint Carter has the hos
tage issue and 110 snow, too."
