# U.S. athletes inspire new patriotism
## 
### Haynes Johnson The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — In the
'20s, after Lindbergh landed in
Paris, Calvin Coolidge dis
patched a cruiser to bring him
home. Many Americans were
angry: they thought it should
have been a battleship: a grateful
nation could do no less for the
greatest of its heroes.
In the 'NOs, with battleships
extinct and the age of heroes
long over. Jimmy Carter flew a
bunch of kids to Washington to
honor them at the White House.
There's hardly a citizen in this
supposedly cynical land who
doesn't think that's the least the
president could do for the Olym
pians. Had he thrown in the
Washington Monument, along
with a free lunch Monday, no
criticism would have been heard.
The scene at the White I louse
provided a genuine moment of
national celebration. It went
beyond politics, though politics
surely was present. It went
beyond sports, though the gold
medals dangling from the necks
of our athletes testified to splen
did victories.
After a long run of lousy luck.
Americans finally had something
to cheer. Their inexperienced,
underdog kids not only had come
home winners. They had beaten
the biggest, toughest team of all
— and. by God, the Russians no
Jess.
That victory won't wipe out
the feelings of humiliation and
impotence over the hostages in
Iran, or the frustrations and fears
involving the Russians' moves
toward the Persian Gulf, or the
mock expressions of concern
from our allies about how sad to
see the mighty Americans fall so
low in the world.
Nor is the exaltation that
swept the country perhaps in the
best true spirit of the Olympics,
where winning stands second to

fostering peace and goodwill
among nations. Nor even among
the values we're supposed to
cherish from school days onward

doesn't matter whether you win.

When the Olympians strolled
casually from their buses parked
on the pavement circling the

WASHINGTON — In the
'20s, after Lindbergh landed in
Paris, Calvin Coolidge dis
patched a cruiser to bring him
home. Many Americans were
angry: they thought it should
have been a battleship: a grateful
nation could do no less for the
greatest of its heroes.
In the 'NOs, with battleships
extinct and the age of heroes
long over. Jimmy Carter flew a
bunch of kids to Washington to
honor them at the White House.
There's hardly a citizen in this
supposedly cynical land who
doesn't think that's the least the
president could do for the Olym
pians. Had he thrown in the
Washington Monument, along
with a free lunch Monday, no
criticism would have been heard.
The scene at the White I louse
provided a genuine moment of
national celebration. It went
beyond politics, though politics
surely was present. It went
beyond sports, though the gold
medals dangling from the necks
of our athletes testified to splen
did victories.
After a long run of lousy luck.
Americans finally had something
to cheer. Their inexperienced,
underdog kids not only had come
home winners. They had beaten
the biggest, toughest team of all
— and. by God, the Russians no
Jess.
That victory won't wipe out
the feelings of humiliation and
impotence over the hostages in
Iran, or the frustrations and fears
involving the Russians' moves
toward the Persian Gulf, or the
mock expressions of concern
from our allies about how sad to
see the mighty Americans fall so
low in the world.
Nor is the exaltation that
swept the country perhaps in the
best true spirit of the Olympics,
where winning stands second to

fostering peace and goodwill
among nations. Nor even among
the values we're supposed to
cherish from school days onward
— you know, that talk about it
doesn't matter whether you win.
only how you play it.
You can put all those lofty sen
timents aside. Winning was
wonderful, and winning at this
moment, in that way. most glori
ous of all.
II there's any doubt about this,
you should have been on the
lawn outside the White I louse on
a damp day in late winter.
When the Olympians strolled
casually from their buses parked
on the pavement circling the
south lawn, cheers went up and a
sea of small American flags flut
tered as if one. It was the kind ot
ceremony that on past occasions
would have brought a sneer from
some press lips — another media
event, staged for the cameras.
