# Disillusionment spurs creation of Citizens Party
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
"One hundred twenty-five years ago, a small
group of people met in a Wisconsin town to form a
new political party. They founded the Republican
Party because neither of the country's major part
ies was confronting the great national issue of the
day: slavery."
According to the working paper of the Citizen's
Party, a similar need exists today with neither of
the two major parties addressing specific issues.
The party, offering an alternative to the Democ
ratic and Republican parties, is seeking to intro
duce issues rather than personalities into politics.
According to Laird Easton. a graduate student in
history here involved with the Peninsula Chapter,
"there is a lot of disillusionment with both parties."
The Citizen's Party will not endorse any Democ
ratic or Republican candidate. "There is absurd
posturing by candidates on all sides." said Laird.
"The country needs a turn-around." He added
that "the Democratic Party is ripe with corporate
interests."
According to Susan Glasscoc. also involved with
the local chapter, "the party does not want to be
labeled;" however, "some people may sec that as
socialist."
She added." We want to draw as large a group as
possible."
The party's statement of purpose, entitled "A
Citizen's voyage towards a renewed American
democracy." lists the following goals of the citi
zens' movement:
— Public control of the energy industries.
— A swift halt to nuclear power.
— A strong push for conservation and solar
energy.
— A decrease in the rate ol military spending.
(The Citizen's Party is anti-draft, said Laird.)
— A guaranteed job for everyone who wants to
work.
— Stable prices.
Strong support for human rights.
— Control of corporations.
"How we're going to implement the programs is
not really clear." said Glasscoc. She added that the
party is trying "to define the problems and work

from there."
The party is currently in the formative stages and
preparing a platform and forum for discussion of
these ideas in 19K0, she said.
The party claims the American economic system
is outdated and no longer fits our needs. "A Citi
zen's voyage towards a renewed American democ
racy" quotes Thomas Jefferson: "I am not an ad
vocate for frequent changes . . . hut institutions
must advance to keep pace with the times."
National party membership is approximately
2000. Key organizing efforts are in California, Il
linois. Indiana, Wisconsin. New York, North
Carolina. New Hampshire and Tennessee.
Dr. Barry Commoner, scientist and founder of
the Citizen's Party, will appear on the PBS prog
ram "Bill Movers' Journal" Friday at 9 p.m.
Approximately eight different local gatherings will
he held to watch Commoner discuss •The Politics
of Energy."
The party started in Washington around the
Barry Commoner presidential campaign and was
officially registered in December.
In the April convention in Cleveland, the party
will decide its platform and whether to run a candi
date. The candidate will probably be Commoner,
said Laird.
Prominent figures associated nationally with the
party include Ralph Nader. Julian Bond (Georgia
state senator) and Maggie Kuhn (head of the Gray
Panthers).
"We really don't have any faculty sponsors right
now," said Laird. "We're very much in the organi
zational stage."
The party currently lias planned no local fund
raising.
According to Laird, it is too late for the party to
get on the ballot. To register a candidate, the party
must either collect 100.000 signatures to qualify as
an independent or run with the previously regis
tered Peace and Freedom Party.
Laird cited the success of the Libertarians as a
positive sign for the Citizen's Party. Laird said,
however, "if we get 3 percent of the vote (in the
presidential election), we'll be very happy."

"How we're going to implement the programs is
not really clear." said Glasscoc. She added that the
party is trying "to define the problems and work

from there."
The party is currently in the formative stages and
preparing a platform and forum for discussion of
these ideas in 19K0, she said.
The party claims the American economic system
is outdated and no longer fits our needs. "A Citi
zen's voyage towards a renewed American democ
racy" quotes Thomas Jefferson: "I am not an ad
vocate for frequent changes . . . hut institutions
must advance to keep pace with the times."
National party membership is approximately
2000. Key organizing efforts are in California, Il
linois. Indiana, Wisconsin. New York, North
Carolina. New Hampshire and Tennessee.
Dr. Barry Commoner, scientist and founder of
the Citizen's Party, will appear on the PBS prog
ram "Bill Movers' Journal" Friday at 9 p.m.
Approximately eight different local gatherings will
he held to watch Commoner discuss •The Politics
of Energy."
The party started in Washington around the
Barry Commoner presidential campaign and was
officially registered in December.
In the April convention in Cleveland, the party
will decide its platform and whether to run a candi
date. The candidate will probably be Commoner,
said Laird.
Prominent figures associated nationally with the
party include Ralph Nader. Julian Bond (Georgia
state senator) and Maggie Kuhn (head of the Gray
Panthers).
"We really don't have any faculty sponsors right
now," said Laird. "We're very much in the organi
zational stage."
The party currently lias planned no local fund
raising.
According to Laird, it is too late for the party to
get on the ballot. To register a candidate, the party
must either collect 100.000 signatures to qualify as
an independent or run with the previously regis
tered Peace and Freedom Party.
Laird cited the success of the Libertarians as a
positive sign for the Citizen's Party. Laird said,
however, "if we get 3 percent of the vote (in the
presidential election), we'll be very happy."
