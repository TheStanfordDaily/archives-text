# Business as usual in Lake Placid

### Larry Lopez Associated Press Writer 
lAKL PLACID, N Y. (AP)
The morning after, the XIII
Winter Games brought an al
most deafening silence to the
town the world watched.
After two straight weeks ol
spectacle, the regular morning
crowd had Ruth's Diner all to
itself again.
"It'll be great to get back to
the old menus again." a waitress
said as prices went back down
from their Olympian heights.
Down the street, the torch
runners who had brought the
Olympic flame to l ake Placid
were loading up a van and bus
with baggage and people bound
for home. Their motel already
sported a vacancy sign.
Swift departures
A friend was trying to per
suade Heidi Wallace, the torch
bearer from I awrence. Kan.,
and her boyfriend Greg, to stay
just one more day.
There were tears and hugs as
torchbearers from across the
country split up after a month ol
being together.
"Flame on. guys." another
torchrunner said mournfully as
her friends left one by one. each
carrying his or her own torch.
A handful ol buses with
strange names lurched down the
street, passing by hitchhikers
with signs lor cities hundreds ol
miles away.
Private security guards were
still checking credentials at the
l ake Placid ()ly mpic Organizing
Committee headquarters, but

the doors to the crisis room were
wide open.
Long-awaited day
"I or 3 1 2 years, I've been wait
ing lor this day," director Greg
McDonnell said as he finished
the last trick alone in the silent
room, surrounded by charts and
maps and radios and 2? silent
telephone consoles.
A loldaway bed was tucked
away in a corner, and a car travel
permit lay on one of the long ta
bles, useless now but highly
prized one day earlier when strict
travel rules still were in effect.
"The best thing was seeing the
barricades come down at six this
morning," said McConnell. still
presentable in the dark blue,
double-knit suit and tie he had
been wearing for the past three
days.
I.ong goodbyes
"It's over. Greg. Go home."
said Cheryl Moomey as she pas
sed by at 8:20 a.m. on her way to
her post as LPOOC" General
Managei I'eter Spurnev's secret
ary .
"I don't think I got any sleep
last night."' she said, recalling
ABC- I V"s reception at the Nil
ton that capped a round ol
closing-night parties and was still
going strong at 4 a.m.
Outside, a Japanese official
was gassing up a limousine as a
faint breeze barely stirred the
multi-colored flags of the nations
which competed here.
There were no long lines out
side the ticket office, for once,
and the few cars and trucks that
glided by did not disturb the
mounds ol broken bottles, bits ol
food and paper cups that made
this once-pristine mountain vil
lage look like l imes Square.
