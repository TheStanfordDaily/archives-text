# Violent crimes on the rise
## 
### Jiri Weiss Staff Writer 
Murder in the United States
has reached such proportions
that more people have been
murdered in the past three years
than died in the ten years ol the
Vietnam war. A child born today
in an American city has a 1 in 50
chance of being murdered.
These startling statistics were
presented to an audience of
about 30 at the Round Room of
Memorial Church Monday even
ing by Dr. Donald I utide, a
psychiatrist and law professor
here.
I.unde has had a life-long pro
fessional interest in murder and
murderers and has testified in
such celebrated cases as the
Patty Hearst and Dan White
trials.
Statistically the people who
are most likely to murder you are
friends, your spouse or your rela
tives and they are most likely to
do it vour own home, according

to Lunde.
The murderet is likely to be a
male in his 20s. although mur
ders by women account for about
25 percent of the total.
Husbands are most likely to
murder their wives in the bed
room with a pistol, while the wife
is most likely to use a kitchen
knife and do it in the kitchen.
Hand guns account for about
60 percent of murders in the Un
ited States.
"The hand gun figures are re
ally incredible." said I.unde.
"and yet the only presidential
candidates that have come out in
favor of gun control have been
Kennedy and Anderson."
Lunde pointed out that it does
not seem to make much sense to
protest the licensing of guns il
you need a license to drive an
automobile.
It is doubtful, however, that
even il guns were to be taken off
the market completely the death
toll would drop. According to

I .uncle, there are about I ()().()()()
guns among the civilian popula
tion and guns do not age. One
option that nobody talks about,
he said, is ammunition control,
since ammunition has a rela
tively short shell life.
(iun control and ammunition
control could, according to
I.unde. prevent many murders
including some of the more biz
/are and most often publicized
murder cases.
I.unde. who has interviewed
about a hundred murderers and
has testified in some celebrated
cases, cited several reasons for
the rising crime rate.
"While there is no single type
of murder nor a single kind of
personality or cause for murder,
there is good information on the
deterrent effect of the death
penalty." said I.unde. "There is
no deterrence effect. Murder is
usually a crime of passion and
planning is rarely a factor," said
I.unde.
I.unde asked every one of the
murderers he interviewed, if
they thought that the death pen
alty would have affected the way
they had acted. The only ones
that thought so actually wanted
it. like Gary Gilmore who from
childhood had an obsession with
getting executed by a firing
squad.
Besides the availability of guns
as a reason for the high yearly
murder rate. I.unde said that kil
ling has become an accepted way
of dealing with other people.
I.unde believes that Psychol
ogy Prof. Albert Bandura's
studies here have shown that
children do in fact imitate be
havior they see on television.
"Another reason for increas
ing murder rates, according to
I.unde. is the changing methods
of child rearing.
