### Linda Deutsch Associated Press Writer 
I OS ANGHI LS — A judge turned
down a request Monday by the Synotion
Toundation to have 14 Los Angeles-area
radio and television stations turn over 15
months ol coverage of a ease involving a
rattlesnake attack on an attorney.
Superior Court Judge William
llogoboom. who quashed all ol Sy nation's
subpoenas, said the organization had not
show n good cause lor surrender ol the tapes,
tilins. video tapes and other material sought
by Svnanon Irom the news media.
Svnation said il wanted to use the broad
casts to support a motion for a change ol
venue ol the upcoming trial ol Synanon
loundei Charles Dedcrich and two ol his
"imperial marines
Dedcrich. I a nee Kenton and Joseph

Musico are charged with plotting to kill an
attomcv by putting a rattlesnake in his mail
box.
I logoboom said the effort to obtain media
coverage lor 15 months was not the only
method available for the Synanon attorneys
to prove their point.
"It appears to me there is a considerable
number ol alternatives to ensure the defen
dants a fair trial and a fair hearing on change
ol venue." llogoboom said.
Ihe judge said he already had receiv ed
hundreds ol pages ol print news coverage ol
the case in support of the defendants' conten
tion that excessive news coverage in Los
Angeles County makes a fair trial here im
possible.
Herbert Schoenberg. an attorney repre
senting CBS. had argued that the search lor
15 months' ol material would be extraordi

narily expensive and time-consuming lor the
stations involved.
"Based on the time span requested here,
the inordinate expense lor the stations far
overrides any possible benefit the defendants
could derive from these subpoenas." he said.
Hogoboom quashed the subpoenas
against these stations: KNBC . KABC-IV.
KTLA. K.TTV. radio stations kll.l and
KHJ-h'M as well as KHJ-TV. radio stations
KKI.A. KI.AC. KMF.T, KFWB. and three
CBS stations. KNXT-TV and radio stations
KN\ and KNX-KM.
The judge said he would hear a change ol
venue motion later in the day but indicated
he would be reluctant to grant a switch in the
trial site unless Synanon could prove that
publicity — no matter what its quantity
was prejudicial.
