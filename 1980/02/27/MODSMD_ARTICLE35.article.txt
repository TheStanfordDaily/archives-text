# Win streak snapped
## Cards lose heartbreaker 
### Cathy Dickerson Staff Writer 
"I guess it's hotter now than
against Arizona." remarked
Cardinal pitcher Mike
Zhoralske. "It's gotta happen
sometime." added another
player.
But the emotion following
Stanford's 5-4 loss to the Santa
Clara Broncos yesterday at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw
Stadium was one ol disappoint
ment. Previous!) undefeated
Stanford had been handed its
first defeat of the year and it was
a tough loss.
The Broncos claimed the vic
tory with a single run scored on a
Stanford infield error with two
outs in the bottom hall ol the
tenth inning.
I he loss was hung on junior
reliever George Lope/ despite
four strong innings ot work in
which he pitched his way out ol
two — almost three — jams, and
recorded a one-two-three in
ning.
I'll us Stanford enters league
play this weekend with .1 12-1
record in pre-season play. The
Cardinals face the L'ni\ersit) ol
Ari/ona in the first Pacific-10
series tit the year this Friday.
Saturday and Sunday at home in
Sunken Diamond.
It was rumored yesterday that
when the national rankings tor
collegiate baseball come out to
day. Stanlprd would be ranked
number one in the nation due to
having the only undefeated pre
season record ol all the Pac-10
teams. Now there is some ques
tion about that ranking.

I he key to yesterdays loss for
the Cards was a lack of hitting
Stanford totalled only seven hits
111 40 .it bats, for a percentage
well below the current .314 team
batting average. It wasn't that
the Cards weren't making con
tact with the ball.either; many ot
the outs that the Broncos re
corded were "at 'em balls"
well hit but right at Santa Clara
I ielders.
Cardinal shortstop Dave
Meier collected three of the hits
for the team yesterday as he went
three-tor-live at the plate, and
catcher Bill Worden went two
tor-lour with a double and .111
RBI triple in the early innings of
the game. The only other hit
Stanford got 111 the game was a
hunt single by center tielder
Mike Toothman in the tilth in
ning.
Earl) lead
Stanford took an early lead in
the game scoring twice in the
second inning on two long balls
and a groundout. Meier led oil
the inning with a double oft the
wall in center field, and Worden
tripled to the same spot sending
the Bronco center fielder crash
ing into the fence and scoring
Meier. Steve Buechele then
grounded out to the Bronco
shortstop and that w as enough to
score Worden.
The Cards added two more
runs in their half of the tilth on a
Santa Clara error, a balk by re
liever Bill Scudder. Toothman's
well-laid bunt and a sacritice fly
h\ left fielder Mike Aldrete
111 the bottom hall ot that in
ning Santa Clara put three runs
on the scoreboard with only two

hits. Two ol Santa Clara's three
runs walked home. I he third
crossed the plate on an RBI
single b\ Bronco first baseman
Ron Hansen.
In the seventh, Santa Clara
tied the game at 4-4 with two
solid singles, a tickler's choice
and an RBI double that Hansen
laced into lett field. Hansen
finished the das three-l'or-three
with two RBI and two walks.
F.xlra innings
The tenth inning was the fatal
one for Stanford. Bronco left
lielder Hank Garcia started the
rails with a single into right field
and advanced to second when
1 ope/'s throw to first base es
caped first baseman Da\ies. An
infield single by center fielder
Steve Guengerich put runners on
first and second with no outs.
I ope/ got the next two batters
to pop out to the infield and had
third baseman Sean Everton hit
the ball on the ground toward
third making it look like the third
out of the inning. But third
baseman Steve Bueehele let the
ball get through him and the
back-up pla\ b\ shortstop Meier
was too late to get Garcia before
he crossed the plate.
