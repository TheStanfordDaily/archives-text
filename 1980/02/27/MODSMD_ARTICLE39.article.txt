# Women second, men third in nation
## Stanford netters outclass foes 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Stanford's men's and women's
tennis teams breezed through
their opponents yesterday in
similar fashion, clinching the
team wins after the singles play
and emptying the benches for the
doubles. The men outclassed
Canada College 7-2, while the
women thoroughly trounced the
San Jose State Spartans in a
Northern California league
match, 8-0.
The men's team was playing
without Peter Rennert and
Lloyd Bourne, their top two
players, but still managed to
dominate the singles play. Tim
Mayotte, playing No. 1, was the
only player to be stretched to
three sets, finally prevailing
against John Huebner 6-7, 6-3,
6-4.
Mayotte, uncharacteristically
floating his volley in the first set,
managed to collect his game in
the final two sets with the help of
a pep talk from coach Dick
Gould and cheering encourage
ment from fellow teammates.
The Cards then went on to sweep
the other singles matches in
straight sets to take an insur
mountable 5-0 lead.
In doubles action, Canada,
one of the top junior colleges,
rallied to take two impressive
victories. Their No. 1 team,
Huebner-Mike Codiga, poached
their way to a 6-1, 6-4 win over
Scott Bondurant and Dave
Siegler, and their No. 2 team
upset Stanford's Jeff Arons and
John Course. The Cards man
aged to pull out the third dou
bles, however, as Jim Miller-
Alan Blumberg overpowered
Mark McNally-Antonio Rush.
The women's team, currently
ranked number two in the na
tion, showed just how powerful
it can be, losing only one set
on the way to its 8-0 triumph.
In the top two singles matches,
Stanford's Alycia Moulton.
perhaps the top collegiate player
in the country, used her powerful
serve and volley to rout Kim
Purcell, 6-2, 6-2, and Donna
Rubin, the veteran of the team,
was played closely by Arlene
Santos, but dominated the score
6-0, 6-2. En route to their sing
les sweep, Lisa Gordon rallied to
a basic baseline victory, 6-1, 6-2,
over Jana Elway, twin sister of
guess who — Stanford quarter

back John Elway.
In the doubles, Moulton and
Sue Rasmussen beat Purcell-
Santos, 6-2, 6-1, and Julia
Leighton and Gayle Chan of
Stanford nipped Marks-Hagila
6-1. 7-6, winning the tie breaker
5-4. The third doubles was
halted due to darkness with Stan
ford's Connie Nivinny-Susie
Barbe on top of Denise
Mendoza-Elway 7-5, 3-6, 4-2.
Like the men's team, the
women are looking forward to a
strong season again this year
after a second-place finish in the
AIAW last season. They will
have to do it without the services
of All Americas Barbara and
Kathy Jordan, Susie Hagey and
Dianne Morrison, but new head
coach Frank Brennan has a posi
tive outlook.
"This team is quite a bit diffe
rent from teams in the recent
past," said Brennan. "We're

used to having four or five All
Americans out there and now
we're down to one. We are a
young team with no seniors, so it
will be interesting to watch their
development. They're a fun
group to coach."
In tennis action coming up, the
men will face Foothill College
today at the varsity courts start
ing at 1:30 p.m. and will be in La
Jolla for the Pacific Coast Dou
bles Championships over the
weekend. The women have
home matches Thursday versus
University of San Diego and
Saturday against Fresno State.
