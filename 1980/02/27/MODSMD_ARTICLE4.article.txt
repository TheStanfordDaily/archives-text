# By 6 to 5 vote at well-attended meeting
## IFC rejects Penthouse offer 
### Kimberly Brown Staff Writer 
An offer by Penthouse to sponsor an
inter-fraternity carwash this spring was
rejected last night in a close vote at a
meeting of the Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil (IFC).
The controversial proposal by
Penthouse to donate 100 kegs of beer, a
live band, and prizes given away by
Penthouse Pets for a charity carwash
has met widespread resistance here
over the past two weeks. Women's
groups and others objected to Penth
ouse sponsoring the event because they
say the corporation promotes exploita
tion of women.
In the final vote, six fraternities op
posed the sponsorship, five voted in
favor, two abstained and one fraternity
was absent.
About 90 persons were present at
the meeting, which was open to the
press and the Women's Center since a
campus-wide issue was being discus
sed.
IFC President John Kinney led off
the extensive debate which preceded
the vote by citing his reasons for oppos
ing the event. He said the IFC would be
making a mistake by condoning Penth
ouse's involvement.
"I want to use Penthouse, I don't
want Penthouse to use us," he said.
According to Kinney, many factors
led him to his conclusion. These
included a "tremendous amount of in
put" from general members of the
campus community, the Women's
Center and the administration. He also
cited certain logistical problems which
could deter from the event's success.
By refuting the offer, the IFC will
gain needed support from these various
groups — support which can be chan
neled into a new fundraiser.
"My proposal is that we direct our
energies towards making the Aquafol
lies really outstanding," said Kinney.
In his opinion, with extra support, the
Aquafollies could bring in even more
money than the carwash.
The subsequent party would be
handled differently. The IFC is cur
rently investigating the possibility of
holding it in the inner quad — an idea

which the administration seems to
favor, according to Kinney.
The Stanford Hospital has offered to
put up $1000 to SISOO in support of
the event and Coors has agreed to do
nate 60 kegs of beer.
About 20 women sat in on the dis
cussion, and a few presented their indi
vidual views. One woman asserted,
"It's not you (the fraternities) against
us; it's do you want to perpetuate rape
against your sisters and future
daughters?"
A representative from each of the
fraternities presented his house's col
lective view, and/or his personal feel
ings concerning the Penthouse spon
sored carwash.
A member of the Delta Kappa Epsi
lon fraternity stated that his fraternity
favored the event. He said a decision of
this nature did not need to be legally
and morally bound.
"Penthouse advocates liberal views
— but it's not explicitly sexist." he said.
"This University tolerates all sorts of
different views, and 1 think they should

be open concerning this one."
The representative from Zeta Psi,
who also voted in favor of the carwash,
felt that it would be impossible to
please everybody. He said he feared
that the involvement of Coors could be
just as dangerous.
A number of fraternities who voted
against the offer decided their incen
tives needed to be re-examined, and
that their original assumptions had
been wrong.
A Phi Delta Theta member said,
"The most important thing is raising
money for charity. We can do that
some other way and accomplish just as
muctf — maybe even more."
The fraternities which voted in favor
of the Penthouse sponsorship were the
Dekes, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsi
lon. Kappa Alpha and the Zetes. Those
who voted against the sponsorship
were Kappa Sigma, Phi Delts, Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Theta Delta Chi and Theta Xi. Alpha
Delta Phi and Sigma Chi abstained,
and Beta Theta Pi did not attend.
