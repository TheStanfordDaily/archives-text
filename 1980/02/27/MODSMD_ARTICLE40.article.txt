### John Julius Staff Writer 
Turning in a solid team per
formance, the Stanford wo
men's golf team captured sec
ond place behind Arizona State
University in last week's Arizona
Intercollegiate Tournament at
the Rio Rico Country Club in
Tucson.
Trailing ASU by seven shots
going into the third and linal
round, Stanford started rallying
and managed to lead the field by
five shots on the sixteenth tee.
only to see that lead disappear
because of bad breaks.
Stanford finished three shots
behind ASU and 1 5 shots ahead
of University of New Mexico.
Debbie Barberio and Joanne
Pacillo were low for Stanford at
235, nine shots behind the
champion, Marta Dotti, a
freshman at USC who is consi
dered by many to be the best
amateur out of Europe.
Although not having anyone
finish in the top 10 individually,
Stanford managed to have all its
players firmly in the middle of
the pack. Linda Bowman and Al
lison Finney were tied at 236 and
Barbara Ann Wright finished at
239. Stanford's team total of 304
was low for the last day of the
tournament, which was
toughened by strong winds and
rain.
"This is the first time that the
Stanford women have been in
contention in a major tourna
ment," remarked coach Tim
Baldwin. "We had a very solid
performance by the whole team.
The experience we gained in
Tucson will enable us to win a
major tournament."
"We really played like a team
out there," added I.inda How
man. "I found myself pulling for
everyone else more than ever be
fore." Baldwin echoed her
comments, "There's a great feel
ing right now on the team. The
team spirit is tremendous.

"The growth of the team has
been remarkable. "We've gone
from an average team last fall to
a contender for any major
championship."
Ihe team benefitted from at
k'ast one exceptional round per
day. Bowman was the individual
leader after the first day, firing a
74 to lead the field by one shot.
" Ihe second day she teed off
last. It was windy and rainingand
cold and she had to wait on every
shot. It seems like everything
went wrong for her," said
Baldwin.
However, on the second day
Barberio and Wright fired iden
tical 74s to keep Stanford in the
race. "It didn't bother me to play
badly the second round once I
learned we were still in second
place," commented Bowman.
"It actually got me psyched to
practice and play better."
The third day Stanford was led
by Joanne Paccillo, who shot the

best round of the day, a 73. "It
seemed every day we had some
one with a hot hand that kept us
in contention," added Baldwin.
The women see nothing hut
continued success this season,
and it they keep improving as
they have, they will certainly be a
contender in any tournament
they play in. "Our goals before
were to finish in the top five in
the tournaments we played in."
said Bowman. "Now we defi
nitely believe we can win one.
We know that we're among the
top three teams in the West and
we should stay there throughout
the season."
Stanford's next test will be a
NorCal match at the Olympic
Club in San Francisco on Sun
day. "We're looking forward to
playing head-to-head against the
number one team in the country
(San Jose State)," said Baldwin.
"They weren't in Arizona so
we'll have to prove how good we
are against them."
