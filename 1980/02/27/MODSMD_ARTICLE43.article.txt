WASHINGTON — A peti
tion signed by about 70 of the
1 20 members of the U.S. Winter
Olympic team opposing Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's call for a
boycott of the Moscow Olympics
this summer will be sent to the
president later this week.
When members of the winter
team met with Carter at the
White House Monday, they had
hoped to present it to him per
sonally, but decided against
doing so because signatures were
still being collected.
Rick Colella, one of two
members of the athletes advisory
council to the U.S. Olympic
Committee, who organized the
drive, said Tuesday that the peti
tion had not been circulated
adequately amid all the hoopla
of leaving Lake Placid for
Washington.
The idea for the petition was
broached Saturday night at a
meeting of team captains and
written late Sunday, Colella said.
Because of traveling arrange
ments, the Alpine skiing team,
which had to leave for a Monday
competition, and several indi
vidual athletes never saw the pet
ition. he said.
The U.S. ice hockey team,

which astounded the sports
world by winning a gold medal,
decided against it, Colella said.
The petition, Colella said,
"thanks the president for the in
vitation to the White House and
talks about the importance of the
Olympic Games and the Olym
pic spirit."
The petition also says, in part:
"There is no substitute for the
Olympic Games. They do not be
long to one country, but to the
world. We urge you to do all you
possibly can to let the Summer
Olympic athletes enjoy the same
Olympic experience that we.
members of the Winter Olympic
team, have enjoyed."
Colella said none of the
athletes who signed the petition
disagreed with Carter's stand on
the Soviet invasion of Afghanis
tan.
"This isn't a political thing at
all." he said. "We're just trying
to say something that might help
the other athletes."
Confusion over whether the
petition actually had been deli
vered to the president developed
when Eric Heiden. winner of five
gold medals in speed skating,
told reporters the petition was to
be presented.
