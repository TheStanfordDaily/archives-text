Mideast diplomats exchanged
Egypt and Israel established full diplomatic rela

and Jerusalem as a major chapter in the history ot
peace but denounced in much of the Arab world as a
day of betrayal.
As ambassadors from the former enemies pre
sented their credentials in the two capitals. Palesti
nian Arabs protested by closing down businesses and
schools in the Israeli-occupied territories. Moslems
staged similar strikes in parts of Lebanon, and all
traffic in Syria came to a standstill for fix e minutes at
midday. Protesters clashed with riot police in Sudan.

Praft registration plan in trouble
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's plan
to register women lor the draft already appears dead,
and now his proposal to register men is in grave
danger as well.
Phis came through loud and clear yesterday as one
legislator after another on a House appropriations
subcommittee ridiculed Carter's call for registration
as an empty gesture.
After the hearing. Rep. Joseph McDade (R-Pa.)
predicted the subcommittee would refuse to approve
money even to register males unless Chairman Ed
ward Boland (D-Mass.) and the administration found
a better way to package the proposal.
Until now. the White House request for registra
tion money has been a single package containing
funds for registration of both men and women.
However. John White, deputy director of the
White House Office ol Management and Budget,
said the administration is willing to treat its request
separately, with money tor men and women in diffe
rent packages.
Hie decision marks a major change in strategy in
the administration campaign to begin registering men

and women, aged I 1 ) and 20. this summer.
After hearing White and other administration wit
nesses testify that Carter's call for registration was
part of his effort to demonstrate American resolve in
the face ol Soviet aggression. Rep. Bob Traxler (D-
Mich.) said: "I doubt whether this whimper can be
heard beyond this room, far less overseas."
The administration is seeking an extra $4? million
in Fiscal lysOand I1 funds to finance registration
of men and women. The subcommittee is expected to
vote this week on the request.

MANCHESTER. N IL John Sears, architect of
Ronald Reagan's drive tor the White House, sud
denlv was demoted and resigned on the spot yester
day.the day of the New Hampshire primary. It was
the climax of a long power struggle that has marred
the Reagan presidential campaign.
Sears was replaced js Reagan's campaign director
by William Casey, a New York attorney and former
official in the Lord and Nixon administrations.
Reagan said he wanted to emphasize "the people
to-people type of campaigning" and to reduce cam
paign expenditures.
Campaign press secretary James I ake and Charles
Black, a deputy to Sears, quit the Reagan organiza
tion in the wake of Sears' dismissal. Peter Hannaford.
a longtime Reagan aide, took over for Lake and
announced the shake-up.
He said Sears' ouster was the result ol disagree
ments on the use of the campaign's limited funds.
But other sources close to the campaign said the
move resulted from a combination of factors: re
sentment ot Sears by conversatives who believed he
was pushing Reagan toward the ideological middle,
charges ol sloppy management against him. and
jealousy about Sear's insistence that he retain total
control ot the campaign.
But at a meeting yesterday afternoon with Rea
gan. his wife Nancy, and Casey. Sears was asked to
accept Casey in a co-equal post. He refused, ottered
to resign and his resignation was quickly accepted.
Then Lake and Black, two close allies of Sears, res
igned.
Casey, who will be 67 in March, first met Reagan
last fall. He became one of several businessmen who
served as unofficial advisers to the campaign.

plants again for the first time since the Three Mile
Island accident. NRC Chairman John Ahearne told
Congress yesterday.

moratorium — he called it a "pause" — on operating

That's when the NRC is scheduled to consider
giving the Tennessee Valley Authority's Sequoyah
No. I plant a tentative go-ahead. Ahearne testified
before the House Appropriations subcommittee on
energy.
Barring unforeseen complications, a license will
likely be issued to allow the plant to begin "low

power" operation within the next tew weeks.

period, the plant could then go to lull power four to
si\ months later, he testified.

ha\ e also been made on existing plants to make them
safer, he testified.
Florida nuke reactor shuts down
CRYSTAL RIVER. I la. — A reactor at a nuclear
power plant shut down automatically yesterday when
the plant's instrumentation and control systems lost
power and some radioactive cooling water was spilled
inside the plant, said officials of Florida Power Corp.
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission told Florida
state officials last night that the situation at Crystal
River was "in hand." But the cause ot the accident
was still unknown and radioactive water was still
escaping from the stainless steel reactor housing into
the dome-like concrete containment surrounding the
reactor.
Instruments inside the containment measured
radioactivity at the roof of the dome at 50 roentgens
(about 2(H) times the normal level), at just about 3
p.m. (F.ST), causing the Florida Power Corp. to de
clare an emergency.
NRC sources said that between 30.000 and 50,000
gallons of cooling water with low radioactivity had
spilled throug-h a valve that had stuck open. That is
more than halt the water that normally covers the hot
uranium core where the nuclear reaction in a power
plant takes place.
By 7 p.m. (EST). there were still no signs that any
radioactivity had escaped from the concrete con
tainment into the air.
" I llere was no damage to the reactor, no damage
to the fuel rods, and no radiation released any
where." company spokesman Bob South said late
yesterday at a briefing outside the plant.
