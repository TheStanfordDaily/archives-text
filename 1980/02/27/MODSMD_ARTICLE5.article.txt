From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Ronald Reagan scored a smashing
victory in the nation's first significant
presidential primary yesterday and
President Jimmy Carter beat Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts on the
Democratic side, but it was a little
closer than had been expected.
The victory was doubly sweet for the
69-year-old former California gover
nor. "This was the first," he beamed to
cheering supporters, "and it sure was
the best."
Four years ago, Reagan lost a New
Hampshire cliffhanger to then Presi
dent Gerald Ford, and then suffered
through one primary loss after another
until he finally managed to get back in
the ballgame.
This time, after losing in the Jan. 2 1
lowa precinct caucuses and after trail
ing in some public opinion polls.
Reagan managed a convincing win
over the man the pollsters had been
heralding as the Republican Party fron
trunner, former U.N. Ambassador
George Bush.
Bush conceded defeat a few hours
after the polls closed, telling suppor
ters, "Don't be disappointed. We won
two and lost one. That's .666 and I used
to hit about .240."
His comment referred both to his
previous victories in the lowa caucuses
and the Puerto Rico primary and to the
fact that he was once captain of his
school baseball team.
The former United Nations ambas
sador said his target was to narrow the
field to two candidates, and he said that
had been accomplished.
"Essentially, it's boiling down ... to
a two-man race" with Reagan, he said.
Adam Newar and Louis Friedman,
organizers of the Bush committee on
campus blamed Bush's unexpectedly
sound defeat on Saturday night's de
bate, calling it a "fiasco."
"1 think (Bush) was set up for the kill
and he went in and got stung." sai'd
Friedman, who said he "had a gut feel
ing" that Bush would lose. But Bush
supporters have not conceded, saying
that the one incident will not cost Bush
that much in the long run.
Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee
was third and Rep. John Anderson of
Illinois was fourth in the GOP voting.
Former Gov. John Connally of Texas,
Rep. Philip Crane of Illinois and Sen.

Robert Dole of Kansas trailed far be
hind.
Baker said, "1 believe that now we're
into our second set of frontrunners and
there will be another one still."
Anderson said he was elated to be
fourth, saying, "I can keep going as
long as I have clean laundry."
In the Democratic voting. Gov. Jerry
Brown of California was a far-back
third and Lyndon Larouche and
Richard Kay were fourth and fifth,
sharing only three percent of the vote.
With all 299 precincts reporting, the
Republican standings showed:
— Reagan, 72,734 votes or 50 per
cent.
— Bush. 33,304 or 23 percent.
— Baker, 18.760 or 13 percent.
— Anderson. 14,622 or 10 percent.
— Crane, 2633 or 2 percent.
— Connally. 2215 or 2 percent.
Dole had 60S votes and former Pres
ident Gerald Ford had 380 write-in
votes.
His victory brought Reagan's GOP
delegate total to 22. a tie with Bush.
Baker has 7 altogether. Anderson
picked up his first 2 delegates, and
Connally still had 1 delegate, won ear
lier.
And on the Democratic side, the
standings were:
— Carter, 53,586 votes or 49 per
cent.
— Kennedy, 41,540 or 38 percent.
— Brown. 10.727 or 10 percent.
That translated into 10 Democratic
nominating votes for Carter, nine for
Kennedy. Thus far this year. Carter has
gained 55 nominating votes to Ken
nedy's 36.
Carter, at the White House, said his
victory shows that the voters "support
the policies that we've espoused in in
ternational affairs and our attempts to
deal with the inflation issue and
energy."
Asked whether he had effectively
eliminated Kennedy from the race.
Carter said. "I think that's a judgment
for him to make. I would guess not."
Students for Carter here seemed
cautiously optimistic about Carter's fu
ture. "It's good to see that events in
New Hampshire point the way toward
winning California. Our efforts may be
paying off," said Brad Heinz, one of
the leaders of the committee.
