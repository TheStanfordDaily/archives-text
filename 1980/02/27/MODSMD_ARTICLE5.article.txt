### 
From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Ronald Reagan scored a smashing
victory in the nation's first significant
presidential primary yesterday and
President Jimmy Carter beat Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts on the
Democratic side, but it was a little
closer than had been expected.
The victory was doubly sweet for the
69-year-old former California gover
nor. "This was the first," he beamed to
cheering supporters, "and it sure was
the best."
Four years ago, Reagan lost a New
Hampshire cliffhanger to then Presi
dent Gerald Ford, and then suffered
through one primary loss after another
until he finally managed to get back in
the ballgame.
This time, after losing in the Jan. 2 1
lowa precinct caucuses and after trail
ing in some public opinion polls.
Reagan managed a convincing win
over the man the pollsters had been
heralding as the Republican Party fron
trunner, former U.N. Ambassador
George Bush.
Bush conceded defeat a few hours
after the polls closed, telling suppor
ters, "Don't be disappointed. We won
two and lost one. That's .666 and I used
to hit about .240."
His comment referred both to his
previous victories in the lowa caucuses
and the Puerto Rico primary and to the
fact that he was once captain of his
school baseball team.
The former United Nations ambas
sador said his target was to narrow the
field to two candidates, and he said that
had been accomplished.
"Essentially, it's boiling down ... to
a two-man race" with Reagan, he said.
Adam Newar and Louis Friedman,
organizers of the Bush committee on
campus blamed Bush's unexpectedly
sound defeat on Saturday night's de
bate, calling it a "fiasco."
"1 think (Bush) was set up for the kill
and he went in and got stung." sai'd
Friedman, who said he "had a gut feel
ing" that Bush would lose. But Bush
supporters have not conceded, saying
that the one incident will not cost Bush
that much in the long run.
Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee
was third and Rep. John Anderson of
Illinois was fourth in the GOP voting.
Former Gov. John Connally of Texas,
Rep. Philip Crane of Illinois and Sen.

Robert Dole of Kansas trailed far be
hind.
Baker said, "1 believe that now we're
into our second set of frontrunners and
there will be another one still."
Anderson said he was elated to be
fourth, saying, "I can keep going as
long as I have clean laundry."
In the Democratic voting. Gov. Jerry
Brown of California was a far-back
third and Lyndon Larouche and
Richard Kay were fourth and fifth,
sharing only three percent of the vote.
With all 299 precincts reporting, the
Republican standings showed:
— Reagan, 72,734 votes or 50 per
cent.
— Bush. 33,304 or 23 percent.
— Baker, 18.760 or 13 percent.
— Anderson. 14,622 or 10 percent.
— Crane, 2633 or 2 percent.
— Connally. 2215 or 2 percent.
Dole had 60S votes and former Pres
ident Gerald Ford had 380 write-in
votes.
His victory brought Reagan's GOP
delegate total to 22. a tie with Bush.
Baker has 7 altogether. Anderson
picked up his first 2 delegates, and
Connally still had 1 delegate, won ear
lier.
And on the Democratic side, the
standings were:
— Carter, 53,586 votes or 49 per
cent.
— Kennedy, 41,540 or 38 percent.
— Brown. 10.727 or 10 percent.
That translated into 10 Democratic
nominating votes for Carter, nine for
Kennedy. Thus far this year. Carter has
gained 55 nominating votes to Ken
nedy's 36.
Carter, at the White House, said his
victory shows that the voters "support
the policies that we've espoused in in
ternational affairs and our attempts to
deal with the inflation issue and
energy."
Asked whether he had effectively
eliminated Kennedy from the race.
Carter said. "I think that's a judgment
for him to make. I would guess not."
Students for Carter here seemed
cautiously optimistic about Carter's fu
ture. "It's good to see that events in
New Hampshire point the way toward
winning California. Our efforts may be
paying off," said Brad Heinz, one of
the leaders of the committee.
Carter, who did not campaign per
sonally. held a steady lead o\er
the Massachusetts senator. But Ken
nedy was running stronger than had
been expected by the polls.
The latest Boston Globe survey,
taken less than a week before yester
day's balloting, showed Carter at 55
percent and Kennedy at 30 percent.
But Kennedy's campaign, relying
heavily on volunteers from neighbor
ing Massachusetts, turned out pro-
Kennedy votes in the southern end of
New I lampshire and along the seacoast
where anti-nuclear sentiment is par
ticularly strong.
Kennedy, in what amounted to a
celebration ol defeat, told cheering
supporters that his campaign issues will
take hold in the big industrial states
where the campaign has yet to be
waged.
Mark Agnew, chairman of Students
for Kennedy here conceded a strong
showing to Carter, but was quick to
point out that Kennedy is not out of it
yet. "I hate to see people exagerate
Kennedy "losing in his own back yard.'
because it's only geographically his
back yard. New Hampshire is politi
cally as conservative as they come," he
said.
Brow n, a distant third to Carter and
Kennedy in both the lowa and Maine
precinct caucuses, was getting about 10
percent of the Democratic vote.
At that rate. Brown would win none
ol New Hampshire's 19 delegates to
the Democratic National Convention.
State law requires at least a 10
percent vote to qualify for delegates,
and national party rules set the

threshold at 15 percent.
Hven before the votes were counted,
Brown announced he was abandoning
his campaigning in Massachusetts next
week, and in Alabama, Georgia,
Florida and Illinois 111 the weeks to fol
low .He said he would put what remain
ing campaign funds he had into the
April 1 Wisconsin primary.
Under federal law. il Brown fails to
get at least I 0 percent of the vote in two
consecutive direct primaries, he loses
his eligibility for federal matching
funds for his campaign.
The dramatic Reagan comeback
from his Jan. 2 I defeat at the hands of
Bush in the lowa precinct caucuses
came as the Californian was announc
ing a shakeup in the high command of
his campaign. Three top staffers —
campaign director John Sears, political
operations director Charles Black and
press secretary James Lake — resigned
under pressure only hours before the
\ ictorious tide of Reagan votes became
evident.
Reagan did better than expected in
New Hampshire, in part, because he
campaigned much harder during the
last two weeks. One of the complaints
stemming from Reagan's slippage to
Bush in the pre-election samplings was
that he wasn't working hard enough for
the New Hampshire votes.
While New Hampshire conducted its
keynote primary. Minnesota held pre
cinct caucuses.
I he president easily won a Democ
ratic straw vote — a Carter-conducted
sample showed the president with 74
percent of the ballots. Reagan led
Bush in the GOP straw vote.
