## 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
"We have a vision of a Middle East
with no more wars," said Mordekhai
Artzieli, the Israeli consul-general of
San Francisco at a White Plaza rally
yesterday.
In a similar vein, Saleh El-Daour.
the Egyptian consul-general of San
Francisco, said for Egyptians, "Peace is
not only a cherished ideal but also an
imperative commandment in our holy
books, to which we are committed."
Co-sponsored by the Stanford Hillcl
Israel Action Committee and the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the rally
commemorated yesterday's historic
exchange of ambassadors between
Egypt and Israel. About 200 to 250
persons attended. It was the first offi

cial public appearance the consuls have
made together.
Twenty members of the Arab Stu
dent Association carried signs of pro
test ranging from "Palestinians have
rights, too" to "Stop Israeli settlements
in Arab land."
Citing the recent opening of bound
aries and the upcoming commence
ment of airline service between Israel
and Egypt, Artzieli said, "This is a
great, historic day in the annals of the
Middle East.
"For 32 years, the Middle East has
seen wars, bloodshed, bereavement
and orphanhood. Our sons have met
five times on the battlefield," he said.
He praised the "momentous step when
Israel signed the peace treaty with
Egypt, the largest, strongest and most

populous Arab state," in November
1977.
"The critical importance lies in the
statement, 'the state of war between
Egypt and Israel has come to an end," "
Artzieli said.
Cooperation
In a spirit of cooperation and frater
nity, the only wars in the Middle East
will now be on poverty, illiteracy and
disease, he said. "Let all deserts in the
Middle East bloom, so that the cradle
of human civilization, and of the three
great religions, will once again turn into
a source of human pride and progress,"
he said to sustained applause.
El-Daour lauded the treaty for its
recognition of the "urgent necessity of
the establishment of a just, com
prehensive and lasting peace in the

Middle East, in accordance with the
U.N. Security Council Resolution
242," referring to the 1967 call for a
peace agreement which would include
a solution to the Palestinian refugee
problem.
According to El-Daour, the treaty
terminated the war, recognized the
former mandated border and provided
for the observation of international law
between the two parties.
"It reaffirms the tenets of the Camp
David agreement of September 17,
1 978, and is an important step for the
attainment of a settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict," he said.
Time for peace
Referring to the $45 billion Egypt
has spent on armaments, he said, "It is

time that we give the Egyptian the
chance to raise his standard of living;
we cannot do that without finding
peace in our area."
Blessed with the Nile Valley. Egypt
historically "was never an aggressor,
hut only went to war in defense of its
land." he said. Referring hack to
Egypt's giv ing hirth to the world's first
civili/ation. El-Daour said, "we have
never harbored ill feeling toward any
people, nor have we known doctrines
ol racial or religious discrimination."
I inalk. he recalled the words til
Eigyptian President Anwar Sadat, who
said to the Israeli Knesset in 1977.
"any life lost in war is the life of a
human being, irrespective of whether it
is an Arab or an Israeli."
Protest
After the rally, one of the protesters.
Tarif Ahboushi. a Palestinian from the
West Bank. said. "This isn't peace, it's
going to produce more bloodshed,"
pointing to the planned Israeli settle
ments ol the Arab towns of Hebron
and Nahlus in the West Bank.
"Nothing short of an independent
Palestinian state will solve the prob
lem." said the graduate student in
engineering-economic systems.
Ahboushi called for mutual recogni
tion by both sides that regardless of the
past, "il there's going to be peace, it's
not going to come by taking away the
Jews or the Palestinians, but by both
sides treating each other as equal. I
would like to e\ entually see one state."
Echoing Abhoushi's sentiments.
I lanan Saved, a junior in civil engineer
ing from Lebanon, called the rally
"superficial" because it failed to take
into account the Palestinians and other
Arab states.
In light of the fact that neither side
has been willing to recognize the

other's right to exist, she said, "both
Israel and the PLO have to recognize
each other simultaneously. Since that
has not happened yet. I don't think
Egypt should have gone ahead."
Treaty
An Israeli student said. "Without
tins treaty, the grass-roots movement
within Israel tor peace would not have
taken place. There's a large movement
m Israel against the proposed West
Bank settlements now."
Debbie Denenberg. chairperson of
the Israeli Action Committee and or
gani/er ol the rally, said, "the purpose
ol the rally v\as to celebrate the good
aspects of the treaty."
She said the treaty does not preclude
further progress on the Palestinian
problem, but rather "is infesting Israel
with a greater willingness to continue
working towards a comprehensive
peace. It's gotten us over one barrier
and has given us the momentum to get
o\er the next one."
Hamad Al-Baadi. leader of the Arab
Student Association, said. "Once Is
ra&l has recognized the Palestinians'
right to exist, the PI O would be willing
to talk to Israel and recognize its right
to exist. But. (Israeli Prime Minister
Menacheni) Begin has often said he
will never allow a Palestinian state
anvwhere in Palestine."

and Egypt, Artzieli said, "This is a
great, historic day in the annals of the
Middle East.
"For 32 years, the Middle East has
seen wars, bloodshed, bereavement
and orphanhood. Our sons have met
five times on the battlefield," he said.
He praised the "momentous step when
Israel signed the peace treaty with
Egypt, the largest, strongest and most

populous Arab state," in November
1977.
"The critical importance lies in the
statement, 'the state of war between
Egypt and Israel has come to an end," "
Artzieli said.
Cooperation
In a spirit of cooperation and frater
nity, the only wars in the Middle East
will now be on poverty, illiteracy and
disease, he said. "Let all deserts in the
Middle East bloom, so that the cradle
of human civilization, and of the three
great religions, will once again turn into
a source of human pride and progress,"
he said to sustained applause.
El-Daour lauded the treaty for its
recognition of the "urgent necessity of
the establishment of a just, com
prehensive and lasting peace in the

Middle East, in accordance with the
U.N. Security Council Resolution
242," referring to the 1967 call for a
peace agreement which would include
a solution to the Palestinian refugee
problem.
According to El-Daour, the treaty
terminated the war, recognized the
former mandated border and provided
for the observation of international law
between the two parties.
"It reaffirms the tenets of the Camp
David agreement of September 17,
1 978, and is an important step for the
attainment of a settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict," he said.
Time for peace
Referring to the $45 billion Egypt
has spent on armaments, he said, "It is

chance to raise his standard of living;
we cannot do that without finding
peace in our area."
Blessed with the Nile Valley. Egypt
historically "was never an aggressor,

Egypt's giv ing hirth to the world's first

never harbored ill feeling toward any
people, nor have we known doctrines

I inalk. he recalled the words til
Eigyptian President Anwar Sadat, who
said to the Israeli Knesset in 1977.
"any life lost in war is the life of a
human being, irrespective of whether it
is an Arab or an Israeli."
Protest
After the rally, one of the protesters.
Tarif Ahboushi. a Palestinian from the
West Bank. said. "This isn't peace, it's
going to produce more bloodshed,"
pointing to the planned Israeli settle
ments ol the Arab towns of Hebron
and Nahlus in the West Bank.
"Nothing short of an independent
Palestinian state will solve the prob
lem." said the graduate student in
engineering-economic systems.
Ahboushi called for mutual recogni
tion by both sides that regardless of the
past, "il there's going to be peace, it's
not going to come by taking away the
Jews or the Palestinians, but by both
sides treating each other as equal. I
would like to e\ entually see one state."
Echoing Abhoushi's sentiments.
I lanan Saved, a junior in civil engineer
ing from Lebanon, called the rally
"superficial" because it failed to take
into account the Palestinians and other
Arab states.
In light of the fact that neither side
has been willing to recognize the

other's right to exist, she said, "both
Israel and the PLO have to recognize
each other simultaneously. Since that
has not happened yet. I don't think
Egypt should have gone ahead."
Treaty
An Israeli student said. "Without
tins treaty, the grass-roots movement
within Israel tor peace would not have
taken place. There's a large movement
m Israel against the proposed West
Bank settlements now."
Debbie Denenberg. chairperson of
the Israeli Action Committee and or
gani/er ol the rally, said, "the purpose
ol the rally v\as to celebrate the good
aspects of the treaty."
She said the treaty does not preclude
further progress on the Palestinian
problem, but rather "is infesting Israel
with a greater willingness to continue
working towards a comprehensive
peace. It's gotten us over one barrier
and has given us the momentum to get
o\er the next one."
Hamad Al-Baadi. leader of the Arab
Student Association, said. "Once Is
ra&l has recognized the Palestinians'
right to exist, the PI O would be willing
to talk to Israel and recognize its right
to exist. But. (Israeli Prime Minister
Menacheni) Begin has often said he
will never allow a Palestinian state
anvwhere in Palestine."
"We have a vision of a Middle East
with no more wars," said Mordekhai
Artzieli, the Israeli consul-general of
San Francisco at a White Plaza rally
yesterday.
In a similar vein, Saleh El-Daour.
the Egyptian consul-general of San
Francisco, said for Egyptians, "Peace is
not only a cherished ideal but also an
imperative commandment in our holy
books, to which we are committed."
Co-sponsored by the Stanford Hillcl
Israel Action Committee and the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the rally
commemorated yesterday's historic
exchange of ambassadors between
Egypt and Israel. About 200 to 250
persons attended. It was the first offi

cial public appearance the consuls have
made together.
Twenty members of the Arab Stu
dent Association carried signs of pro
test ranging from "Palestinians have
rights, too" to "Stop Israeli settlements
in Arab land."
Citing the recent opening of bound
aries and the upcoming commence

and Egypt, Artzieli said, "This is a
