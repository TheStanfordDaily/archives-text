"We have a vision of a Middle East
with no more wars," said Mordekhai
Artzieli, the Israeli consul-general of
San Francisco at a White Plaza rally
yesterday.
In a similar vein, Saleh El-Daour.
the Egyptian consul-general of San
Francisco, said for Egyptians, "Peace is
not only a cherished ideal but also an
imperative commandment in our holy
books, to which we are committed."
Co-sponsored by the Stanford Hillcl
Israel Action Committee and the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the rally
commemorated yesterday's historic
exchange of ambassadors between
Egypt and Israel. About 200 to 250
persons attended. It was the first offi

cial public appearance the consuls have
made together.
Twenty members of the Arab Stu
dent Association carried signs of pro
test ranging from "Palestinians have
rights, too" to "Stop Israeli settlements
in Arab land."
Citing the recent opening of bound
aries and the upcoming commence
ment of airline service between Israel
and Egypt, Artzieli said, "This is a
great, historic day in the annals of the
Middle East.
"For 32 years, the Middle East has
seen wars, bloodshed, bereavement
and orphanhood. Our sons have met
five times on the battlefield," he said.
He praised the "momentous step when
Israel signed the peace treaty with
Egypt, the largest, strongest and most

populous Arab state," in November
1977.
"The critical importance lies in the
statement, 'the state of war between
Egypt and Israel has come to an end," "
Artzieli said.
Cooperation
In a spirit of cooperation and frater
nity, the only wars in the Middle East
will now be on poverty, illiteracy and
disease, he said. "Let all deserts in the
Middle East bloom, so that the cradle
of human civilization, and of the three
great religions, will once again turn into
a source of human pride and progress,"
he said to sustained applause.
El-Daour lauded the treaty for its
recognition of the "urgent necessity of
the establishment of a just, com
prehensive and lasting peace in the

Middle East, in accordance with the
U.N. Security Council Resolution
242," referring to the 1967 call for a
peace agreement which would include
a solution to the Palestinian refugee
problem.
According to El-Daour, the treaty
terminated the war, recognized the
former mandated border and provided
for the observation of international law
between the two parties.
"It reaffirms the tenets of the Camp
David agreement of September 17,
1 978, and is an important step for the
attainment of a settlement of the
Arab-Israeli conflict," he said.
Time for peace
Referring to the $45 billion Egypt
has spent on armaments, he said, "It is
