# South Africa would accept Mugabe
## 
### Carlyle Murphy The Washington Post 
JOHANNESBURG — The South Afri
can government is prepared to accept an in
dependent Rhodesia ruled hy either ol the
nationalist guerrilla leaders against whom it
helped the white Rhodesian minority wage a
war for nearly a decade.
While it would not he its lust choice. South
Africa even feels that it could live with a
government headed hy Marxist guerrilla
leader Robert Mugabe, who. officials here
think, would provide strong leadership and
at the same time would need economic ties
with South Africa.
112 ar more favorable, however, in the view
of many South Africans, would be a govern
ment led jointly by former prime minister
Abel Mu/orewa and Joshua Nkomo. a guer
rilla leader considered less radical than
Mugabe.
Conversations with South African political
and military officials and others close to the
government indicate that this readiness to
accept a guerrilla-led Rhodesia in a result ot
South Africa's disillusionment with the lead
ership ability of Bishop Abel Mu/orewa. the
man they helped make Rhodesia's first black
prime minister last year.
It also stems Irom a pragmatic South Alri
can adaption to change circumstances in
Rhodesia brought about by the British
arranged peace settlement.
Reluctantly
Thus. Pretoria has accepted, although re
luctantly. the premise ol U.S. and British
diplomats devising peacclul solutions to the
racial conflicts in southern Alrica — that the
men with the guns must also he included lor a
workable solution.
"It's clear now that you cannot have a

settlement without accommodation with the
external opposition forces." said a South Af
rican political science professor. Andre du
Pisani. He suggested that this attitude might
also spill over the future ol the territory ol
Southwest Africa (Namibia).
Mu/orewa 'weak'
"Mu/orewa is a weak leader." said one
South African military official 111 a
background discussion. "The worst thing
that could happen in my personal opinion
would be il Mu/orewa won bv a landslide."
in Rhodesian parliamentary elections this
week, lie said.
Another government official said the
South Africans had also taken note ol
Mu/orewa's apparent declining popularity
among blacks in Rhodesia since the return of
Mugabe and his fellow guerrilla leader
Joshua Nkomo last month.
South African officials indicate that their
preference at the moment is a coalition gov
ernment led by Mu/orewa and Nkomo.
Mu/orewa, concerned about keeping whites
in Rhodesia, would provide a moderating
influence on economic policy, they think,
while Nkomo. whom South Africa does not
consider a Marxist, would provide the politi
cal savvy and authority.
Respectability
As a longtime nationalist leader with guer
rilla credentials. Nkomo could also give the
government respectability and credibility in
the international community.
Some observers even feel that the cloud ol
a Mugabe government would have a silver
lining tor South Africa, intent upon sur
rounding it sell wi th a butter /one ol econom
ically dependent states.
I heir theory is that like Mozambique and
Angola, a Mugabe-headed socialist govern

mcnt in Rhodesia would attract less Western
investment than would a moderate, less
anti-Western regime led In Nkomo and
Mu/orewa. I here would tluis he more op
portunities lor South Africa to step in with
technical aid. loans, lood and products as it
was m Mozambique, increasing Rhodesia's
economic dependence on Pretoria." said one
South African academic. "In an odd way. il
Mugabe could stahili/c Rhodesia, he might
not he unwelcome in Pretoria."
Hazards
I lie South Africans" lirst choice, an
Nkomo-led coalition, is not without ha/ards
to this country. Nkomo has longstanding lies
with South Alrican National Congress. Un
likc Mugabe. Nkomo has never said publicly
that lie would deny sanctuary or bases in
Rhodesia to guerrillas lighting lor the Con
gress.
Secondly, throughout the guerrilla war 111
Rhodesia. Nkomo enjoyed a closer relation
ship with the Soviet Union than did Mugabe,
who got most ol his arms from China and
Kastern bloc countries like Romania and
Yugoslav la.
"What's lie going to do about the
Soviets?" asked one South African official.
Ihe main question now is what military
role, il any. South Africa will play over the
next lew months as the British conduct elec
tions. set up a new Rhodcsian government
and then hastily depart.
Ever since the settlement talks began last
September. South Africa has been making
bellicose statements implying it would inter
vene militarily in Rhodesia under certain cir
cumstances. These included the necessity to
assist a mass white exodus or to counter in
tervention by East Germans or Cubans, now
considered unlikely by most observers.

Ihe main question now is what military
role, il any. South Africa will play over the

Ever since the settlement talks began last
September. South Africa has been making

JOHANNESBURG — The South Afri
can government is prepared to accept an in
dependent Rhodesia ruled hy either ol the
nationalist guerrilla leaders against whom it
helped the white Rhodesian minority wage a
war for nearly a decade.
While it would not he its lust choice. South
Africa even feels that it could live with a
government headed hy Marxist guerrilla
leader Robert Mugabe, who. officials here
think, would provide strong leadership and
at the same time would need economic ties
with South Africa.
112 ar more favorable, however, in the view
of many South Africans, would be a govern
ment led jointly by former prime minister
Abel Mu/orewa and Joshua Nkomo. a guer
rilla leader considered less radical than
Mugabe.
Conversations with South African political
and military officials and others close to the
government indicate that this readiness to
accept a guerrilla-led Rhodesia in a result ot
South Africa's disillusionment with the lead
ership ability of Bishop Abel Mu/orewa. the
man they helped make Rhodesia's first black
prime minister last year.
It also stems Irom a pragmatic South Alri
can adaption to change circumstances in
Rhodesia brought about by the British
arranged peace settlement.
Reluctantly
Thus. Pretoria has accepted, although re
luctantly. the premise ol U.S. and British
diplomats devising peacclul solutions to the
racial conflicts in southern Alrica — that the
men with the guns must also he included lor a
workable solution.
"It's clear now that you cannot have a

settlement without accommodation with the
external opposition forces." said a South Af
rican political science professor. Andre du
Pisani. He suggested that this attitude might
also spill over the future ol the territory ol
Southwest Africa (Namibia).
Mu/orewa 'weak'
"Mu/orewa is a weak leader." said one
South African military official 111 a
background discussion. "The worst thing
that could happen in my personal opinion
would be il Mu/orewa won bv a landslide."
in Rhodesian parliamentary elections this
week, lie said.
Another government official said the
South Africans had also taken note ol
Mu/orewa's apparent declining popularity
among blacks in Rhodesia since the return of
Mugabe and his fellow guerrilla leader
Joshua Nkomo last month.
South African officials indicate that their
preference at the moment is a coalition gov
ernment led by Mu/orewa and Nkomo.
Mu/orewa, concerned about keeping whites
in Rhodesia, would provide a moderating
influence on economic policy, they think,
while Nkomo. whom South Africa does not
consider a Marxist, would provide the politi
cal savvy and authority.
Respectability
As a longtime nationalist leader with guer
rilla credentials. Nkomo could also give the
government respectability and credibility in
the international community.
Some observers even feel that the cloud ol
a Mugabe government would have a silver
lining tor South Africa, intent upon sur
rounding it sell wi th a butter /one ol econom
ically dependent states.
I heir theory is that like Mozambique and
Angola, a Mugabe-headed socialist govern

mcnt in Rhodesia would attract less Western
investment than would a moderate, less
anti-Western regime led In Nkomo and
Mu/orewa. I here would tluis he more op
portunities lor South Africa to step in with
technical aid. loans, lood and products as it
was m Mozambique, increasing Rhodesia's
economic dependence on Pretoria." said one
South African academic. "In an odd way. il
Mugabe could stahili/c Rhodesia, he might
not he unwelcome in Pretoria."
Hazards
I lie South Africans" lirst choice, an
Nkomo-led coalition, is not without ha/ards
to this country. Nkomo has longstanding lies
with South Alrican National Congress. Un
likc Mugabe. Nkomo has never said publicly
that lie would deny sanctuary or bases in
Rhodesia to guerrillas lighting lor the Con
gress.
Secondly, throughout the guerrilla war 111
Rhodesia. Nkomo enjoyed a closer relation
ship with the Soviet Union than did Mugabe,
who got most ol his arms from China and
Kastern bloc countries like Romania and
Yugoslav la.
