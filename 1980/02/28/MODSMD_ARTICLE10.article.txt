# America opposes Jamaican premier
## 
### Les Payne Newsday 
Although it welcomed Jamai
ca's recent call for early elec
tions. the Carter administration
remains determined to drive the
country's Socialist prime minis
ter from office unless he moder
ates his pro-Cuban policies.
Earlier this month, the prime
minister. Michael Manley. who
has been head ot government
since 1972. announced that he
was seeking a new mandate b\
calling for earl\ elections, possi
bly in October. They were not
required until I 981.
"Manley s announcement that
he would hold elections . . .
ahead of schedule was surprising
and interesting," said a State
Department source. Publicly.
U.S. officials remain neutral
about the elections. However, it
is known that influential ele
ments in the White Mouse and
the State Department ha\e de
cided to actively oppose Man
ley's re-election.
*Irretrie\ able'
A plan by the administration
to use all its available influence
against the "irretrievable" prime
minister was disclosed last
month by News day. The Carter
administration, in a reversal ot
its three-year relationship with
Manley. had decided that the lef
tist leader was attempting to
adopt Cuba's brupd of socialism

and was headed toward a one
party state. Manley repeatedly
has denied such charges.
The prime minister's political
woes stem from a nearly ban
krupt economy, which, as it wor
sens each day. threatens to erode
the enormous popularity he once
enjoyed.
In 197. N. Jamaica negotiated a
three-year $429 million Interna
tional Monetary Fund loan.
Seeking to establish Jamaica as a
model tor Third World de
velopment. the IMF set tough
fiscal terms, which included fi
nancial and social reforms and a
more than 35 percent devalua
tion of tht Jamaican dollar. I
don't think that any other coun
try in the world would have ac
cepted the IMF* conditions." said
a State Department official on
the Caribbean desk in
Washington.
Central to the island's im
mediate economic distress is the
IMF's decision in December to
cut oft emergency funds in re
sponse to Jamaica's failure to
adhere to the bank's guidelines.
Although the IMI and Jamaica
have been negotiating since De
cember. no agreement is ex
pected before the end of next
month. The loan cutofl has stop
ped the official flow of foreign
capital, frozen most imports and
exports and drastically increased
unemployment, all to the detri

me nt of Man ley's chances for
re-election.
Oil prices
Contributing to Jamaica's
poor IMF standing has been the
skyrocketing price of oil, island
floods that wiped out sugar and
banana crops and inefficient fis
cal management. According to
close associates, Manley believes
that the IMF is effectively un
dermining voter confidence in
him. Others see the United
States, a major contributor to the
IMF. wielding its economic clout
against Manley through the
world financing institution.
"The more the Jamaican
economy tails into crisis, the less
are Mauley's chances of winning
an election," a knowledgeable
Washington • v smircc said.
"Jamaica called on the fund in
. . . 1 y7S when its economv was

in a big mess, thus any decision
the IMF makes will have a great
impact on the government."
Manley supporters reportedly
have persuaded some members
of the Congressional Black
Caucus to lobby the IMF direc
tor to grant a waiver and re
establish credit to Jamaica.
However, such attempts have
been unsuccessful. And some
experts say that, even if credit
were resumed immediately, it
could not insure Manley"s re
election should the October elec
tion be held as announced.
In an event, said a source
knowledgeable about the
Jamaican crisis. "Whoever wins
the elections will have an
economic mess on his hands.
Quite frankly. I think that it may
be too late from Mauley's point
of view."

experts say that, even if credit
were resumed immediately, it
could not insure Manley"s re
election should the October elec
tion be held as announced.
In an event, said a source
knowledgeable about the
Jamaican crisis. "Whoever wins
the elections will have an
economic mess on his hands.
Quite frankly. I think that it may
be too late from Mauley's point
of view."
Although it welcomed Jamai
ca's recent call for early elec
tions. the Carter administration
remains determined to drive the
country's Socialist prime minis
ter from office unless he moder
ates his pro-Cuban policies.
Earlier this month, the prime
minister. Michael Manley. who
has been head ot government
since 1972. announced that he
was seeking a new mandate b\
calling for earl\ elections, possi
bly in October. They were not
required until I 981.
"Manley s announcement that
he would hold elections . . .
ahead of schedule was surprising
and interesting," said a State
Department source. Publicly.
U.S. officials remain neutral
about the elections. However, it
is known that influential ele
ments in the White Mouse and
the State Department ha\e de
cided to actively oppose Man
ley's re-election.
*Irretrie\ able'
A plan by the administration
to use all its available influence
against the "irretrievable" prime
minister was disclosed last
month by News day. The Carter
administration, in a reversal ot
its three-year relationship with
Manley. had decided that the lef
tist leader was attempting to
adopt Cuba's brupd of socialism

and was headed toward a one
party state. Manley repeatedly
has denied such charges.
The prime minister's political
woes stem from a nearly ban
krupt economy, which, as it wor
sens each day. threatens to erode
the enormous popularity he once
enjoyed.
In 197. N. Jamaica negotiated a
three-year $429 million Interna
tional Monetary Fund loan.
Seeking to establish Jamaica as a
model tor Third World de
velopment. the IMF set tough
fiscal terms, which included fi
nancial and social reforms and a
more than 35 percent devalua
tion of tht Jamaican dollar. I
don't think that any other coun
try in the world would have ac
cepted the IMF* conditions." said
a State Department official on
the Caribbean desk in
Washington.
Central to the island's im
mediate economic distress is the
IMF's decision in December to
cut oft emergency funds in re
sponse to Jamaica's failure to
adhere to the bank's guidelines.
Although the IMI and Jamaica
have been negotiating since De
cember. no agreement is ex
pected before the end of next
month. The loan cutofl has stop
ped the official flow of foreign
capital, frozen most imports and
exports and drastically increased
unemployment, all to the detri

me nt of Man ley's chances for
re-election.
Oil prices
Contributing to Jamaica's
poor IMF standing has been the
skyrocketing price of oil, island
floods that wiped out sugar and
banana crops and inefficient fis
cal management. According to
close associates, Manley believes
that the IMF is effectively un
dermining voter confidence in
him. Others see the United
States, a major contributor to the
IMF. wielding its economic clout
against Manley through the
world financing institution.
"The more the Jamaican
economy tails into crisis, the less
are Mauley's chances of winning
an election," a knowledgeable
Washington • v smircc said.
"Jamaica called on the fund in
. . . 1 y7S when its economv was

in a big mess, thus any decision
the IMF makes will have a great
impact on the government."
Manley supporters reportedly
have persuaded some members
of the Congressional Black
Caucus to lobby the IMF direc
tor to grant a waiver and re
establish credit to Jamaica.
However, such attempts have
been unsuccessful. And some
experts say that, even if credit
were resumed immediately, it
could not insure Manley"s re
election should the October elec
tion be held as announced.
In an event, said a source
knowledgeable about the
Jamaican crisis. "Whoever wins
the elections will have an
economic mess on his hands.
Quite frankly. I think that it may
be too late from Mauley's point
of view."
