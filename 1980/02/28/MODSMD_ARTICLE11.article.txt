### 
From the Daily wire services
SAN SALVADOR, El Sal
vador — Leftists took 25 city
employees of the central market
hostage Tuesday, and the na
tion's unified leftist front an
nounced plans for a revolutio
nary government to replace the
current civilian and military
junta.
Nationalization of some indus
tries and restructuring of the
army were key features of the
plan.
The Popular Leagues of Feb.
2X said it took the hostages to
protest lack ot cleanliness, the
presence of police, and high
taxes and market stall rentals.
The central market is operated
by the city.
A spokesman for the group,
which takes its name from the
date of a 1977 demonstration
that was fired on by security
forces resulting in the deaths of a
number of leftists, said Mayor
Julio Prendes had failed to keep
his promise to meet demands
after a previous takeover.
Seizing buildings and taking
hostages have been used by lef
tists for months to back demands
for reform. All hostages have
been released except 25 others
held in three high schools for
about a week.

leftists at a University of El Sal
vador lecture hall. Popular Re
volutionary Bloc spokeswoman
Anna Maria Gomez read the
proposal aimed at bringing a
popularly-supported govern
ment to this politically torn
Central American nation.
The plan included nationaliza
tion of foreign commerce, the
utility companies and petroleum
refineries. The plan also men
tioned expropriation of indust
rial monopolies. It called for re
structuring the army and said all
other security forces must be dis
solved.
A junta communique accused
extremists, without specifying
rightists or leftists, of causing
confusion and anarchy to pre
vent change and the return of
public order. "Salvadorans may
be sure that we will keep vigilant

to the rumors of a coup," the
communique said.
The United States Embassy in
El Salvador has become a for
trcss waiting for attack. Iron
gates and ncwlv installed, thick
concrete walls guard the main
entrance's, sandbag gun
emplacements are strategically
located on the roof.
Only two weeks ago, the prim
ary fear of U.S. officials here was
a possible assault on the embassy
by Marxist guerrillas or an occu
pation by leftist demonstrators.
One such occupation already
had been attempted last October
before being repulsed with tear
gas.
In recent days, as the United
States has threatened harsh
political and economic sanctions
to avert a rightist military coup
backed by the country's ul
traconservative economic elite,
U.S. officials believe they have
been targeted by right-wing ex
tremists as well.
By continuing to prop up the
junta, the United States has
found itsel! — like the govern
ment it supports — caught bet
ween two increasingly powerful
extremist forces that are focusing
most of their attacks on those in
the middle.
Denunciation
Last Thursday, a spokesman
for the recently formed Broad
National Front, a conservative
group claiming the support of
landowners, businessmen and
professionals, denounced Acting
Charge d'Affaires James Cheek
on television. Cheek, a deputy
assistant secretary .of state, has
been running the U.S. Embassy
since the previous ambassador,
Frank Devine; demanded to be
removed earlier this month.
The Broad National Front
spokesman accused Cheek and
the United States of condemning
El Salvador to communist to
talitarianism by attempting to
placate the left and supporting
the Christian democrats in the
current junta.
Although the front has denied
any involvement, similar tele
vised accusations have been fol
lowed by methodic murders of
the people named.

A junta communique accused
extremists, without specifying
rightists or leftists, of causing
confusion and anarchy to pre
vent change and the return of
public order. "Salvadorans may
be sure that we will keep vigilant

to the rumors of a coup," the
communique said.
The United States Embassy in
El Salvador has become a for
trcss waiting for attack. Iron
gates and ncwlv installed, thick
concrete walls guard the main
entrance's, sandbag gun
emplacements are strategically
located on the roof.
Only two weeks ago, the prim
ary fear of U.S. officials here was
a possible assault on the embassy
by Marxist guerrillas or an occu
pation by leftist demonstrators.
One such occupation already
had been attempted last October
before being repulsed with tear
gas.
In recent days, as the United
States has threatened harsh
political and economic sanctions
to avert a rightist military coup
backed by the country's ul
traconservative economic elite,
U.S. officials believe they have
been targeted by right-wing ex
tremists as well.
By continuing to prop up the
junta, the United States has
found itsel! — like the govern
ment it supports — caught bet
ween two increasingly powerful
extremist forces that are focusing
most of their attacks on those in
the middle.
Denunciation
Last Thursday, a spokesman
for the recently formed Broad
National Front, a conservative
group claiming the support of
landowners, businessmen and
professionals, denounced Acting
Charge d'Affaires James Cheek
on television. Cheek, a deputy
assistant secretary .of state, has
been running the U.S. Embassy
since the previous ambassador,
Frank Devine; demanded to be
removed earlier this month.
The Broad National Front
spokesman accused Cheek and
the United States of condemning
El Salvador to communist to
talitarianism by attempting to
placate the left and supporting
the Christian democrats in the
current junta.
Although the front has denied
any involvement, similar tele
vised accusations have been fol
lowed by methodic murders of
the people named.
