# Japan naval forces join allied maneuvers

### William Chapman The Washington Post 
TOKYO — Japan's navy Tuesday em
barked tVn its first multi-national training
exercise against a background of domestic
protest that is a faint echo of the anti-military
turbulence of years past.
Ships and planes of the Maritime Self-
Dcfense Force joined naval forces of four
other Pacific countries in the central Pacific,
ending iis post-war tradition ol abstaining
from collective defense operations.
Japan has shared military operations for
more than a decade with the United States,
but for domestic political reasons stayed out
ol exercises involving other nations.
Its participation in this year's central
Pacific exercise touched off a modest revival
ol the hostility toward military preparations
that marked the late 1950s and 1960s.
Left-wing parties anil labor unions de
nounced it as a new violation ol Japan's
anti-war constitution, while the small but vio
lent underground chimed in with sporadic
acts of sabotage.
5500 protest
About 5500 demonstrators organized by
the Socialist Party and affiliated labor unions
staged a protest Sunday at the naval port of
Yokosuka, and Tuesday national railway en
gineers expressed their disapproval by slow
ing more than 100 trains by 20 minutes on
each run.
Late last week, a radical group claimed
responsibility for cutting communication ca
bles at military installations in another pro

test of Japan's joining the naval exercises off
Hawaii.
But these and other minor incidents at
bases were far less severe than the massive
demonstrations that once confronted efforts
to expand Japan's military preparations and
to continue the U.S.-Japan security pact.
Those protests reached a peak in the sum
mer of 1960. when the government finally
had to admit it could not guarantee security
for a visit of U.S. President Dwight D.
Eisenhower. They continued throughout the
1960s but gradually subsided.
Unthinkable
It would have been unthinkable in those
days for Japan to send two destroyers, eight
anti-submarine patrol aircraft and 700 sea
men to join a four-nation force, as it did
Tuesday.
Japanese observers with experience from
the past think it would have been intolerable
even four or five years ago. Many regard the
light protest this year as reflecting a slow but
steady change in Japanese attitudes toward
defense, a change which gradually gives
military leaders more maneuvering room in
which to stretch the words of the constitution
to cover new types of military activity.
"Compared to 10 years ago. the Japanese
people's attitude toward things like this
(exercise) has changed," said Ganri
Yamashita, a member of parliament and
former head of the Japanese Defense
Agency. "Their understanding for these
things has improved."
The Japanese naval units made a rendezv

ous off Hawaii with ships and planes of the
United States, Australia, New Zealand and
Canada to begin a 20-day exereise known as
"Rimpac 'HO," a designation referring to
countries on the rim of the Pacific Ocean.
The total force involves 41 ships. 200 air
craft and 20,000 sailors and airmen in joint
operations to test combat readiness, accord
ing to U.S. military officials here. Its
schedule includes surface warfare and de
fense tactics against submarines and aircraft.
To dilute domestic opposition to Japanese
participation, the Japanese Defense Agency
lias insisted that its naval forces are merely
participating in a "training exercise" to im
prove its sailors* skills, as authorized by law.
"Rimpac 'SO," it asserts, is not a collective
security operation aimed at any potential
enemy, which would he a clear violation of
the constitution.
Socialists, communists and left-wing labor
union leaders scoff at this explanation as
being a bit of semantics designed to obscure
the fact that Japan has taken another small
step in expanding military operations, this
time abroad.
In the past year, the United States and
Japan have stepped up their joint exercises
and recently conducted their first coordi
nated air defense training.
Since the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,
the United States has stepped up its pressure
to induce Japan to strengthen its defenses
and has suggested that it take on more re
sponsibility for defending its commercial
shipping lanes through Southeast Asia.

the fact that Japan has taken another small
step in expanding military operations, this
time abroad.
In the past year, the United States and
Japan have stepped up their joint exercises
and recently conducted their first coordi

TOKYO — Japan's navy Tuesday em
barked tVn its first multi-national training
exercise against a background of domestic
protest that is a faint echo of the anti-military
turbulence of years past.
Ships and planes of the Maritime Self-
Dcfense Force joined naval forces of four
other Pacific countries in the central Pacific,
ending iis post-war tradition ol abstaining
from collective defense operations.
Japan has shared military operations for
more than a decade with the United States,
but for domestic political reasons stayed out
ol exercises involving other nations.
Its participation in this year's central
Pacific exercise touched off a modest revival
ol the hostility toward military preparations
that marked the late 1950s and 1960s.
Left-wing parties anil labor unions de
nounced it as a new violation ol Japan's
anti-war constitution, while the small but vio
lent underground chimed in with sporadic
acts of sabotage.
5500 protest
About 5500 demonstrators organized by
the Socialist Party and affiliated labor unions
staged a protest Sunday at the naval port of
Yokosuka, and Tuesday national railway en
gineers expressed their disapproval by slow
ing more than 100 trains by 20 minutes on
each run.
Late last week, a radical group claimed
responsibility for cutting communication ca
bles at military installations in another pro

test of Japan's joining the naval exercises off
Hawaii.
But these and other minor incidents at
bases were far less severe than the massive
demonstrations that once confronted efforts
to expand Japan's military preparations and
to continue the U.S.-Japan security pact.
Those protests reached a peak in the sum
mer of 1960. when the government finally
had to admit it could not guarantee security
for a visit of U.S. President Dwight D.
Eisenhower. They continued throughout the
1960s but gradually subsided.
Unthinkable
It would have been unthinkable in those
days for Japan to send two destroyers, eight
anti-submarine patrol aircraft and 700 sea
men to join a four-nation force, as it did
Tuesday.
Japanese observers with experience from
the past think it would have been intolerable
even four or five years ago. Many regard the
light protest this year as reflecting a slow but
steady change in Japanese attitudes toward
defense, a change which gradually gives
military leaders more maneuvering room in
which to stretch the words of the constitution
to cover new types of military activity.
"Compared to 10 years ago. the Japanese
people's attitude toward things like this
(exercise) has changed," said Ganri
Yamashita, a member of parliament and
former head of the Japanese Defense
Agency. "Their understanding for these
things has improved."
The Japanese naval units made a rendezv

ous off Hawaii with ships and planes of the
United States, Australia, New Zealand and
Canada to begin a 20-day exereise known as
"Rimpac 'HO," a designation referring to
countries on the rim of the Pacific Ocean.
