# Prof makes 3-D photos of Mars
## 
### Mary Haber Staff Writer 
Through three-dimensional
mo\ ies never bccame as popular
as the movie industry
prophesi/ed, they have become
useful as research products as
well as lor entertainment.
In attempting to convey the
surface of Mars in 3-D from two
dimensional photographs sent by
Viking Spaceships, Dr. C". Elliot
Levinthal, adjunct professor ol
genetics at the Medical School,
has superimposed films from two
different cameras. With special
glasses, the v iewer sees a three
dimensional picture as the two
images are fused together by the
brain.
I rom the photos. Levinthal
has made a movie called "Mars
in 3-D. designed to educate the
public about the National
Aeronautics and Space Ad
ministration's (NASA) ac
complishments on Mars. The
film was shown in C'ubberly last
night.
Lev inthal began work on 3-D
photography with the intention
of creating an image of the sur
face on Mars. This vv;is essential
in making a machine that could
collect samples from the planet,
for without the 3-D picture ol

the surface the equipment could
\ery easily be grasping at the at
mosphere.
According to l.evinthal. the
Med Center researchers are in
terested in getting samples of
Mars soil as a way of investigat
ing the possibilities of life on
other planets. Through this, they
hope to find new genetic mate
rials to study.
l.evinthal. a member of NA
SA's Landa-Tambra team work
ing on the project, has cooper
ated with professors at other
universities on interpreting the
Mars photographs. The majority
of the work has been done at the
Jet-Propulsion I aboratory at the

California Insitiute of Technol
ogy.
The film was produced by l.ev
inthal and directed by Kenneth
Jones of Cat Tech. The music
was produced by William
Sehottstaedt and Michael
McNabb, former graduate stu
dents in computer research in
music and acoustics here.
Along with Levinthal's film,
three other movies were shown
last night, including "Viking in
Perspective," a NASA movie dis
cussing accomplishments in the
Viking missions.
The other two movies were
produced by Mark Gottlieb, a
graduate student here in product

design iind engineering man
agement. Both films. "4-D
Cubes" and the prize-winning
movie "Special Effects." are
done with computer animation.
Profits from the show ings sup
ported Edge, a campus science
magazine. According to Compu
ter Science Prol Jim McGrath,
production costs are so high that
the magazine loses SI for every
copy it publishes, even though
the magazine almost always sells
out.
McGrath said he hopes the
films made up part ot this deficit
and "provide a public service to
the community."
