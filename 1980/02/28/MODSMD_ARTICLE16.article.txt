# 'Burnout' series a success
## 
### Diann Jackson Staff Writer 
"Borderline Burnouts" is the
title of a series of workshops here
aimed at helping student leaders
use their time and leadership
qualities more effectively.
Sponsored by the Office ol
Student Activities (OSA), the
weekly workshops began in early
February and will end Friday.
The topics have focused on con
cerns ot student leaders, specifi
cally "The Organizer as a Per
son." "University Resources and
Time Management" and " Asser
tiveness Training." The last of
the four workshops will address
"How can I justify graduation?"
â€” letting go of responsibility and
incorporating experience into fu
ture work.
Activities Adviser Patricia
Brandt coordinated the series,
working with several student
groups on campus. Through her
contact with student leaders, she
has observed some of the diffe
rent problems they encounter.
"You see the same thing hap
pen over and over again," she
said. "You see students begin to
lade and eventually disappear
from activity involvement. Often
there is just too much pressure."
One solution to such prob
lems. and Brandt's intent of the
workshop, is that "Student lead
ers can support and learn from
each other."
Brandt said she believes that
similar workshops have been
held on campus in the past, but
the series "Borderline Burn
outs." subtitled "Life in the Past
Lane." approached a different
combination of subjects, in
cluded both men and women,
and was uniquely directed at stu
dent leaders.
The original idea for the series
of workshops evolved from an
OSA staff brainstorming session.
Students Kim Bancroft. Mar
garet Jensen and Stephanie
Smith provided input into the
desiun and content of the work

shop, because Brandt said.
"They wanted to be sure the
workshop became more than an
idea."
Director of Student Activities
Tom Massey led the first work
shop Peb. K on how to balance
personal and organizational
needs, while at the same time in
corporating their involvement
into academic lives.
Brandt led discussion on the
second workshop, "University
Resources," which reviewed av
ailable resources on campus, as
well as the third workshop, " As
sertiveness Training," which
dealt with assertiveness within a
student group and with Univer
sity officials.
The fourth and last workshop
will be directed by Activities
Adviser (iriselda Castro. The
workshop intends to show stu
dents how to integrate their ac
quired leadership skills and val
ues into future jobs, and how to

prepare to let go of their respon
sibilities.
Brandt said she enjoyed coor
dinating the program and has
been pleased by the "incredibly
good" feedback from students.
She said she feels the workshop
was "the right thing at the right
time," and that "there was a real
need for such a series of work
shops."
Brandt said she hopes the re
sult of the workshop is that stu
dent leaders "will experiment
with new behavior and ap
proaches to leadership and by no
means feel there is only one way
to do things."
She emphasizes, "There are
ways to deal with priorities so
they will result in long-term
satisfaction."
Approximately 20 to 30 stu
dents have attended each work
shop. but overall nearly 50 stu
dent leaders have participated in
the series.
