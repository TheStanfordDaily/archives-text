1 hope 1 never have to\ mi my favorite old
willow with my treehouse or the landmarks
of Muir Woods sitting in the Smithsonian
Institute, much less an exhibit of water or a
movie film of land.
But our waste is such a problem that
Mitchell's words might he as much a proph
esy as a hit on the Top 40. We waste every
thing from old computer printouts to
gasoline to electricity for the light we left on
in the bathroom. Too often we don't even
resize it.
Do you know what a big problem it is? In
the?. United States the disposal ot waste is a
$6 : billion business. You snickered

the carrots and go straight for the pepper
mint ice cream. "Waste not. want not. You
could feed all the children in Biafra on all the
carrots you don't eat." Mom was right. We
do ha\e that many wasted carrots.
Do you know what a complex problem it
is?' Waste involves more than emptying your
garbage can in back of your dorm. There
are the problems ol cutting down on initial
wastes, recyclables and non-recyclables.

w hat to do with the waste we can't use, and of
course our mental attitudes about consump
tion.
Cutting down in the beginning is crucial.
I se old handouts as scratch paper; ride sour
bike, turn oft your faucet. Start a compost
heap: help out by sharing newspapers, lights,
and space in dishwashers and cars.
I nc what you can recycle and then be sure
to make sure it goes to a recycling center.

Paper, glass and aluminum are the most
common materials. Remember how easy it is
to recycle on the farm with those big green
bins at your doorstep. It won't be so conve
nient in the real world.
What about Styrofoam cups? Have you
thought of carrying a mug with you w hen you
grab your morning coffee and doughnut? We
seem so often to be in a hurrv or to love the

conveniences that we take advantage of such
products.
Then there's the less publicized problem ot
what to do with the garbage that doesn't get
recycled. Dumping requires an appro\ ed site
and such sites aren't common Currently
much of our garbage is left on landfill in the
Sail Francisco Bay, polluting our air with
toxic odors.
In main parts of the country, illegal dump
ing is being practiced by industry.
Last but not least we have to increase our
awareness of our waste and change our at
titude. Almost as dangerous as our waste and
diminishing resources is our appetite for
"more." tor the luxury and the convenience.
Contrary to a myth, the right to waste is not
something we earn.
Unfortunately we are even wasting time. It
has been forecasted that our country will use
7(1(1 billion gallons of water this year, yet as
hard as we look or pray lor rain, it seems we
can expect only 650 billion gallons. Quick —
turn off the faucet.
You don't know what you've got til it'.s
gone.
