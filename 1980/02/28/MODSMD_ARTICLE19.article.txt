## Americans politically like sheep 
### 
The Mist majority of are
being led down the garden path. We should
have learned to question authority during
Vietnam and Watergate. yet most ot us ;ire
once again willing to prepare to send our
youth en masse to die in a foreign war. This
war will he fought for motives which will not
he honestly explained to us. based upon an
analysis we do not e\en know. let alone agree
with or influence.
American leaders, with the help o! the
media, are exploiting for their own political
profit human beings' basest emotions: fear,
hatred, xenophobia, racism and a desire for
violence as a solution to problems.
The essential crisis lor America right now
is not in Iran or Afghanistan, but in the un
thinking, unquestioning, unanalytical nature
of Americans. Most of us arc like sheep.
We are not questioning the use of \ iolence
or threats of violence as the solution to a
problem which we helped create — through
our Cold-War policies and our subjugation
til the Iranian people for 30 years under an
intolerable despot. We stood by while Henry
Kissinger and Nelson Rockefeller in\ ited the
famous torturer, the shah, to take refuge in
America, as it that were not adding insult to
injury to the Iranians.
We do not even question what effect our
affluent lifestyles have on the Third World,
whose exploited labor and resources make
them possible.
We haven't noticed that Japan and West
ern Europe have expressed remarkably little
concern or readiness for war in response to
the situation in Afghanistan.

We don't question President Jimmy Car
ter's Jeky II Hyde transformation into a war
monger just before the 19N0 election. And
we don't ponder the tact that Carter's crisis
has pretty much destroyed Sen. Edward
Kennedy's and anyone else's candidacies.
Worst ot all. we have not actively ques
tioned why this country is still so vitally de
pendent on vast amounts of energy, and still
does not have a coherent energy policy.
Carter is using fear and loathing of the
Soviets as diversionary tactics, to keep us
from noticing his lousy performance in the
domestic area, as well as in foreign policy.
It is no coincidence that he proposes to
drastically increase defense spending and
weapon production at the same time un
employment rises to its highest rate in I<S
months and many economists predict a re
cession. As David Harris noted. "The higher
you wave your sword, the higher you go in
the polls." It is worse than unfortunate, it is
catastrophic that Americans mistake
militarism for strength and decisiveness.
Daniel Ellsherg offered a more creative
framework with which to devise appropriate
American responses to this situation: How
do we wish the world had responded to our
invasion of Vietnam's civil war? We devas
tated North Vietnam with more tons ot
bombs, especially on civilian targets, than
were dropped in all ol World War 11.
Europe and ev en the socialist countries did
amazingly little about our actions. They
should have taken strong economic and dip
lomatic sanctions against us as we should
take against the Soviets now. We should cut
back on everything the Soviet Union needs

1
from us including wheat and technology , and
move the Olympics from Moscow.
The rest of the world should do the same.
We should not bear the responsibility alone.
We should also support the Common Mar
ket's proposal to guarantee Afghanistan's
neutrality.
The consequences of Carter's politically
expedient militarism could literally be the
end ol the world. We can't trust the Carter
administration to wage a "partial" nuclear
war and not a holocaust, when they can't
even enforce nuclear power plant safety
standards in order to prevent such accidents
as those at Brown's berry. Detroit, or Three
Mile Island.
We already came close to destroying all of
North Carolina in a major, but unpublici/ed.
military accident near (ioldsboro. where five
out ot six safety devices failed on a hydrogen
bomb dropped trom a B-52 that crashed
there.
We should be shocked and outraged by the
military's, the administration's and the
media's blase attitude toward the use of nuc
lear weapons in the Persian Gulf and the
human suffering they would cause.
In conclusion. I find it demoralizing and
terrifying to live in a country that finds it
easier to send its young people off to die and
tothreaten nucleardestruction (forthe ques
tionable motives of questionable leaders)
than to enact energy conservation measures
such as gas rationing. Our weakness is in our
high-consumption lifestyles and our mental
stupor, not in Afghanistan or Iran.

high-consumption lifestyles and our mental

American leaders, with the help o! the

hatred, xenophobia, racism and a desire for
violence as a solution to problems.
The essential crisis lor America right now
is not in Iran or Afghanistan, but in the un
thinking, unquestioning, unanalytical nature
of Americans. Most of us arc like sheep.
We are not questioning the use of \ iolence
or threats of violence as the solution to a
problem which we helped create — through
our Cold-War policies and our subjugation
til the Iranian people for 30 years under an
intolerable despot. We stood by while Henry
Kissinger and Nelson Rockefeller in\ ited the
famous torturer, the shah, to take refuge in
America, as it that were not adding insult to
injury to the Iranians.
We do not even question what effect our
affluent lifestyles have on the Third World,
whose exploited labor and resources make
them possible.
We haven't noticed that Japan and West
ern Europe have expressed remarkably little
concern or readiness for war in response to
the situation in Afghanistan.

We don't question President Jimmy Car
ter's Jeky II Hyde transformation into a war
monger just before the 19N0 election. And
we don't ponder the tact that Carter's crisis
has pretty much destroyed Sen. Edward
Kennedy's and anyone else's candidacies.
Worst ot all. we have not actively ques
tioned why this country is still so vitally de
pendent on vast amounts of energy, and still
does not have a coherent energy policy.
Carter is using fear and loathing of the
Soviets as diversionary tactics, to keep us
from noticing his lousy performance in the
domestic area, as well as in foreign policy.
It is no coincidence that he proposes to
drastically increase defense spending and
weapon production at the same time un
employment rises to its highest rate in I<S
months and many economists predict a re
cession. As David Harris noted. "The higher
you wave your sword, the higher you go in
the polls." It is worse than unfortunate, it is
catastrophic that Americans mistake
militarism for strength and decisiveness.
Daniel Ellsherg offered a more creative
framework with which to devise appropriate
American responses to this situation: How
do we wish the world had responded to our
invasion of Vietnam's civil war? We devas
tated North Vietnam with more tons ot
bombs, especially on civilian targets, than
were dropped in all ol World War 11.
Europe and ev en the socialist countries did
amazingly little about our actions. They
should have taken strong economic and dip
lomatic sanctions against us as we should
take against the Soviets now. We should cut
back on everything the Soviet Union needs

from us including wheat and technology , and
move the Olympics from Moscow.
The rest of the world should do the same.
We should not bear the responsibility alone.
We should also support the Common Mar
ket's proposal to guarantee Afghanistan's
neutrality.
The consequences of Carter's politically
expedient militarism could literally be the
end ol the world. We can't trust the Carter
administration to wage a "partial" nuclear
war and not a holocaust, when they can't
even enforce nuclear power plant safety
standards in order to prevent such accidents
as those at Brown's berry. Detroit, or Three
Mile Island.
We already came close to destroying all of
North Carolina in a major, but unpublici/ed.

We should be shocked and outraged by the
military's, the administration's and the
media's blase attitude toward the use of nuc

human suffering they would cause.
