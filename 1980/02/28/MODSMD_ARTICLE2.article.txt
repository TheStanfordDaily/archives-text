# Local Bush, Kennedy groups still hopeful

### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
Leaders of student groups support
ing the presidential candidacies of both
George Bush and Edward Kennedy at
tributed their respective candidates
losses in Tuesday's New Hampshire
primary in large part to lack of objectiv
ity among voters in considering the
â– candidates.
Both sophomore Mark Agnew of
Stanford Students for Kennedy and
freshman Louis Friedman of Stanford
Students for Bush said that voters
seemed to take the freshest issues to
the polls with them and forget the past.
Agnew, who spent a weekend in
New Hampshire campaigning for Ken
nedy, said he found among the nearly
6700 voters he contacted "an incredi
ble amount of patriotic feeling.
"There's a sense of immediacy.
People are still not looking at President
Jimmy Carter's 3V2 years in office,"'he
said. "Many of them said, 'no, I really
like what he's (Carter) been doing
lately'."
Bush's downfall, Friedman said, was
Saturday night's debate sponsored by
eventual winner Ronald Reagan. Bush
was originally to debate only Reagan,
Friedman said, but then the sponsoring
candidate (Reagan) suddenly decided
he wanted all candidates included,
leaving Bush looking very much the
"elitist" as he has been characterized
by his opponents.
"Reagan planned a good man
euver," Friedman said. "But in a
couple of days the stories are going to
come out and people are going to
realize that (Biish) got stung. I don't
think that what happened Saturday
night will hurt him in other states."
Neither group saw the New Hamp
shire defeat as an end to their candi
dates' campaigns.
Many people in New Hampshire, an
instrumental "draft Kennedy" state
last year, built Kennedy up as a "knight
in shining armor", said Agnew. But
"mortal Ted Kennedy" couldn't possi

ble live up to those standards and
people were disappointed when they
realized that, he added.
By contrast, Agnew said, people
were looking too much at Carter's re
cent performances.
"I really hope we strike the happy
medium soon," he said.
"I'm not getting too pessimistic or
too optimistic about any of the news
I've heard, but 1 realize there's a lot of
time left for a lot of things to happen,"
Agnew said, conceding that Kennedy
realistically needed at least a dead heat
to help his financial situation.
Freshman Adam Newar, of the Bush
organization, cited a similar overesti
mation of Bush's strength. "Once the
American people see him win they ex
pect him to win again, and from that
sense it has hurt him." he said.
'Gaining? 1
"But one of Bush's top aides charac
terized Bush as 'the man who's always
gaining, gaining, gaining,"' Newar
quoted.
" I think you'll be surprised when you
see the Massachusetts returns," said
Friedman, referring to next Tuesday's
primary.
"I don't Bush has reached or passed
his peak," said Jim Issacs, one of the
students who participated in KZSU's
Baker-Bush debate Tuesday night.
Isaacs suggested the possibility that
the race may run so close as to produce
a deadlocked convention in Detroit in
July. In that cast, he said, the Republi
can Party will realize that is needs to
appeal to a broader range of voters by
selecting a moderate candidate,
namely Bush.
Despite his sound victory in New
Hampshire, California favorite son
Reagan has no organized campaign ef
fort here at Stanford.
Carter, the Democratic Party's big
winner in New Hampshire, appears to
have a sizable campus following as
does Kennedy.
Brad Heinz of Stanford Students for
Carter said Carter's Tuesday victory

"shows that people see the advantage
in reelecting an incumbent president."
"It's a remarkable display of confi
dence in the president's handling of the
constantly changing situations in Iran
and Afghanistan," added another
organizer of the Carter effort here.
Beat the polls
The only other candidate with or
ganized support on campus so far is
Howard Baker, whose followers said
that beating the polls was "reasonably
heartening.
"You couldn't really expect a
senator from Tennessee, who got
started late in the primaries because he
had a job to do while no one else did, to

take New Hampshire," said junior
James Gable of Stanford Students for
Baker.
"I think it would he a great disservice
to voters to say that it's a two-man race
at this point. I don't think it's wise to let
two or three primaries determine who
is going to become the president of the
United States," he said.
Gable said that Baker will begin to
gain ground when "people can get
away from the media blitz for awhile
and really ask why they should be for
Baker instead of Bush.
