Critic a 'moron*
I firmly believe that Ronald
Reagan should not and will not
be our next president. However I
was embarrassed that the Daily
printed Mike Charlson's letter
on Feb. 26.
Calling presidential candidates
moronic and stupid is hardly the
type of intellectual reasoning
from a Stanford student that is
worth newspaper space. Stan
ford students especially should
base criticisms on concrete
specifics rather than passionate
jabs that anyone is capable of.
Letters to the editor are a re
flection of general Stanford intel
lect and I would rather not see
their image tarnished by some
moron.

Bias in report
My feelings ranged from
amusement to annoyance upon
reading the report (Daily, Feb.
13) of Steve Hansch, who is
"currently touring the southern
states."
It seems that llansch. when he

has "engaged the locals in dis
cussion about their former go\-
ernor" (much to the amusement
of "locals," I'm sure), has found
that "everyone I've met here
feels that the present governor.
George Busby (sic — it's a pity
no one told him how to spell
Busbee's name) has done a hell
of a lot more to make Georgia a
dynamic, growing economy than
Carter ever did as governor."
This puzzled me. a native
Georgian who has lived in At
lanta for more than 21 years,
until 1 realized that Hansch had
probably been doing a lot of
"touring" in the area of Albany,
Georgia, not far from Plains (not
exactly the center of Georgia or
of the South in any respect).
Albany is Busbee's hometown
and may perhaps feel itself to
have benefited economically
trom Busbee's governorship. I
believe that were Hansch to
carry his researches into north
ern Georgia, particularly At
lanta. he might well receive a dif
ferent impression ol Georgian
polities.
Regarding I lanschV'shrewd"
political observation that south
erners will support President

Jimmy Carter's reelection simply
because he is a southerner, I can
only say that, in the face of the
condescension towards the
South which Hansch himself
(perhaps unconsciously)
exhibits, such political prefer
ence for one ot their own on the
part of many southerners is not
surprising.

Non-energy farming
In response to Edward Teller's
prediction that a massive energy
shortage would mean wide
spread starvation in the Third
World (Daily, Feb. 19), I ask him
to study the world agricultural
situation more thoroughly he
tore making such an assertion.
With Ins prediction. Teller is im
plying that an energy-intensive
system of agriculture is necessary
to solve the world's hunger prob
lems. I believe he is wrong.
I irst of all. there are many al
ternatives to using petroleum
based fertilizers and pesticides:
crop rotation, the use of draft
animals, mixed cropping, muleh
inu. hand weeding, natural

methods ol insect control and
natural fertilizers (compost and
manure). These methods have
been proven effective.
Secondly, in the booklet
Worhi Hunger: Ten Myths, Fr
ances Lappe and Joseph Collins
argue that world hunger is
caused by an international sys
tem of agriculture in which very
few people control the agricul
tural resources. These elites use
the agricultural products of their
countries to further their self
interests, not those of the starv
ing. They argue that "every
country in the world has the re
sources necessary for its people
to free themselves from hunger."
Quite a statement, and they have
strong evidence to back it up.
i
1 urge everyone who is con
cerned about world hunger to
read this booklet in order to dis
pel the myth that an energy
intensive agricultural system is
necessary to feed the millions of
starving people in the world. The
tact is that these starving people
need an agricultural system in
which they themselves control
their countries' resources and
use them in ways that are proven

and renewable, instead of being
dependent on scarce, expensive
chemicals and energy sources
which have known deleterious
effects on the soil and its food
producing ability.

1 urge everyone who is con
cerned about world hunger to
read this booklet in order to dis
pel the myth that an energy
intensive agricultural system is
necessary to feed the millions of
starving people in the world. The
tact is that these starving people
need an agricultural system in
which they themselves control
their countries' resources and
use them in ways that are proven

and renewable, instead of being
dependent on scarce, expensive
chemicals and energy sources
which have known deleterious
effects on the soil and its food
producing ability.

Critic a 'moron*
I firmly believe that Ronald
Reagan should not and will not
be our next president. However I
was embarrassed that the Daily
printed Mike Charlson's letter
on Feb. 26.
Calling presidential candidates
moronic and stupid is hardly the
type of intellectual reasoning
from a Stanford student that is
worth newspaper space. Stan
ford students especially should
base criticisms on concrete
specifics rather than passionate
jabs that anyone is capable of.
Letters to the editor are a re
flection of general Stanford intel
lect and I would rather not see
their image tarnished by some
moron.

Bias in report
My feelings ranged from
amusement to annoyance upon
reading the report (Daily, Feb.
13) of Steve Hansch, who is
"currently touring the southern
states."
It seems that llansch. when he

has "engaged the locals in dis
cussion about their former go\-
ernor" (much to the amusement
of "locals," I'm sure), has found
that "everyone I've met here
feels that the present governor.
George Busby (sic — it's a pity
no one told him how to spell
Busbee's name) has done a hell
of a lot more to make Georgia a
dynamic, growing economy than
Carter ever did as governor."
This puzzled me. a native
Georgian who has lived in At
lanta for more than 21 years,
until 1 realized that Hansch had
probably been doing a lot of
"touring" in the area of Albany,
Georgia, not far from Plains (not
exactly the center of Georgia or
of the South in any respect).
Albany is Busbee's hometown
and may perhaps feel itself to
have benefited economically
trom Busbee's governorship. I
believe that were Hansch to
carry his researches into north
ern Georgia, particularly At
lanta. he might well receive a dif
ferent impression ol Georgian
polities.
Regarding I lanschV'shrewd"
political observation that south
erners will support President

Jimmy Carter's reelection simply
because he is a southerner, I can
only say that, in the face of the
condescension towards the
South which Hansch himself
(perhaps unconsciously)
exhibits, such political prefer
ence for one ot their own on the
part of many southerners is not
surprising.

Non-energy farming
In response to Edward Teller's
prediction that a massive energy
shortage would mean wide
spread starvation in the Third
World (Daily, Feb. 19), I ask him
to study the world agricultural
situation more thoroughly he
tore making such an assertion.
With Ins prediction. Teller is im
plying that an energy-intensive
system of agriculture is necessary
to solve the world's hunger prob
lems. I believe he is wrong.
I irst of all. there are many al
ternatives to using petroleum
based fertilizers and pesticides:
crop rotation, the use of draft
animals, mixed cropping, muleh
inu. hand weeding, natural

methods ol insect control and
natural fertilizers (compost and
manure). These methods have
been proven effective.
Secondly, in the booklet
Worhi Hunger: Ten Myths, Fr
ances Lappe and Joseph Collins
argue that world hunger is
caused by an international sys
tem of agriculture in which very
few people control the agricul
tural resources. These elites use
the agricultural products of their
countries to further their self
interests, not those of the starv
ing. They argue that "every
country in the world has the re
sources necessary for its people
to free themselves from hunger."
Quite a statement, and they have
strong evidence to back it up.
