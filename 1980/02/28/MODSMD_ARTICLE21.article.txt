# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Gregg Garmisa Senate resolution fair 
### 
Whereas we as senators should act as leaders of
student opinion in the absence of a clear student
consensus, therefore he it resolved that the ASSU
Senate opposes President Carter's proposed legisla
tion for registration.
On Feb. 25, the Daily published a letter by John
Mason in which he criticized the above senate re
solution. More specifically. Mason suggested that
the eight senators who voted tor the resolution did
so en masse, with purposeful fraudulence and
media hype as their goals.
As one who witnessed the debate prior to the
vote, I would be hard-pressed to diagnose a sole
rationale for the eight votes, let alone the one he
perceived. More accurately, the personal convic
tions that motivated each person that night were
far too diverse to be handily dismissed as unilater
ally directed at grabbing headlines.
Mason would have been well advised to concen
trate on the debate before having made his re
marks. Assuming that he was not present at the
resolution debate, I would like to clarify what actu
.i!l\ occurred. That night's discussion focused on
perceptions of student opinion and questions re
garding the senate's role.
Regarding the first topic, all those not present
that evening missed a magnificent seminar on the
possible interpretations of the opinion poll.
Senators debated the consistency, inconsistency,
and degree of validity of the town-hall meeting
informational sheets and the results of a random
telephone poll of the University community.
This example of in-fighting resolved itself in the
portion of the resolution that admitted to an "ab
sence of a clear student consensus."
Not wholly unrelated to the first problem was the
more perplexing issue of the senate's role. Ex
trapolating from Mason's letter, the senate should
not act in matters other than campus related ones.
I le offers the examples of lighted tennis courts and
parties as legitimate senate concerns.

To my recollection, not one senator of those
present embraced such a narrow interpretation of
the senate role. (Indeed, to some senators there are
few issues more campus-related than registration.)
Instead, much of the debate centered on the ques
tion of whether the senate could act as delegates â€”
that is leaders of the community, without total
student body support.
The divergent positions eventually merged to
form a majority agreement to oppose registration,
while expressly recognizing that the senate was
acting as delegates of the student body.
At least from my perspective, the senate resolu
tion was an honest compromise and reflection of
the complex and diverse positions presented dur
ing the debate.
Granted, the wording of the resolution could
have been better. However, its general thrust can
not be faulted lor" . . . manipulating us in a way
that discredits them (the senators) and undermines
the integrity of our student government," to quote
Mason.
It might be worth asking, how could an institu
tion so long accused of being devoid of integrity
manipulate us now?
Might not one suggest that a senate role solely
devoted to advancing the causes of lighted tennis
courts and parties, the very role Mason would have
the senate fulfill indefinitely, is partly responsible
for the senate's lack of viability?
Is it not possible that an honest political state
ment by the senate, in times of emotional
campus-wide reflexes, is at least a slight movement
toward renewed senate credibility?
To have done more than the senate did, under
the then current state of confusion, might have
been circumspect.
To have done less, once it decided to act, cer
tainly would have been irresponsible.
