## Leland learns the truth 
### 
"Mother. Mother, I just had a
horrible dream."
"What was it. tiny Leland?"
"I was playing as usual with
my friends at the Stanford
schoolground when suddenly a
tall figure appeared who told me
he was the spirit ot '60s past and
had something to show me."
"What was that, dear?"
"He showed me that outside
our school there are many
people who don't simply learn
and play all day.and that most of
them are usually fearful and ill
informed."
"Yes? And what else?"
"He showed me a place called
Washington, from which ambiti
ous men manipulate the people's
ignorance and fears by threaten
ing them with possible attack by
another mighty group of people
far away in a place called the
Soviet Union."
"Tell me all about it. son."
"He showed me that actually
the ambitious men may have
their own plans to attack the
Soviets first, and have been
known to lie to the people about
their plans in the past. Oh.
Mother!"
"What is it. my little one?"
"Then he showed me the pos
sible effects of fighting between
the two peoples. Death, Mother;
death to everyone and every
thing. either at once or after a
while."
"My poor innocent darling.
Didn't the dream have a happy
ending?"
"Perhaps, Mother. He prom
ised that if my friends and I held
daily protest meetings at the
playground we might help pre
vent fighting and death. But im
mediately afterward, he van
ished. Another tall figure ap
peared. who called himself the
spirit of actual experience."
"And what did he do, darl

ing?"
"He took me to a place called
England between the world
wars, and showed me an entire
country of people who did no
thing but go to meetings against
fighting and death night and day.
and managed only to precipitate
worse fighting and more death."
"And then?"
"He showed me ambitious
men in a place called Moscow,
who not only lie to their people
as a matter of course, but who
usually don't allow them to know
any thing of importance from any
other source."
"What else, dear?"
"He showed me how these
ambitious men also have plans to
attack first. He showed me how
swiftly they moved to capture or
hold a fighting advantage in
places called Hungary, Czechos
lovakia, Ethiopia, Vietnam and
Afghanistan."
"Anything more?"
"Yes. He showed me how
much they hate and envy the
ambitious men in Washington,
and how their avowed aim is to
win dominance from them by the
fastest, most reliable means. But
most of all. they showed me how
horribly afraid they are."
"Of what?"
"Of the men in Washington, and
of a place called China — of
countries in another place called
Eastern Europe which are sup
posed to be their friends but that
in reality hate Soviets.
Of producing less and less

food, energy and other goods,
I everything except weapons.,
which get first priority. Of
people within the Soviet Union
who are not ethnic Russians, but
who will soon outnumber them
— and ot other tactions ot am
bitious men in Moscow who want
their power and positions."
"Poor men."
"Yes, Mother. They know thai
their real enemy is the future:
each day their problems mount
, higher and their enemies get
stronger. So I was frightened too,
for I saw that more and more
they relied on their one
strength."
"What is that, son?"
"Force ot arms. Mother. And
so I cried out: don't fight! But
none of them heard: they disap
peared. And suddenly I was be
fore the men in Washington
again — and they heard, they lis
tened. And Mother . . ."
"Yes?"
"They too are ambitious, and af
raid. but they're also ours, and
they listen. What they told me
• frightened me most ot all."
"What was that?"
"They're trapped. Mother.
The only way to prevent fighting
is to be ready to fight. All of a
sudden I felt small and helpless. I
was back in the schoolyard, but
I now it was gray and cold.
I "Daily meetings won't change
it. There is no easy way out."
