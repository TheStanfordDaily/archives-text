Wendy Wasserstein's 1975
play is scnsitiv e and slick (a little
too?), a picture of survival at an
allegedly high-class institution
the insanity and sentiment
naturally and. perhaps, embar
rassingly familiar.
The characters and situations
in this Michael Cheung produc
tion are drawn fast and true: the
vignettes feature people you'd
meet in the Toyon lounge or see
detaining professors in the
Quad; scenes are straight out of a
dorm all-nighter.
The questions hit home. too.
Why .1111 I here? Is it worth the
money? What am I gonna do
when 1 get out?
The answers, unfortunately,
don't always make it. June
Richards' cast catches the
rhythm of high college life, but
don't Ivy l eague women have
acne? Everyone here is so beaut
iful. so well read, so equally into
James Taylor and Germaine
Greer. Those agoni/ing
smmding dilemmas over failed

Blushing or blurting, the 'sisters' agree: you
seize a man's body, but you hug a woman's
soul. . .

job interviews and being
treated-as-an-object don't hold
as much weight when the agoniz
ers seem to spend much of their
time 1 (drinking 2 (sleeping
around 3)morali/ing.
But, that's college, right.
Wasserstein's language tends

toward the high-flown and
preachy, but it's never annoy
ingly blatant. The humor often
sits in the gutter, but its points
are clear.
The play cleverly pays tribute
to great women and woman
hood. The worldly snap-wit of

The worldly sua/)- wit of Roxy ushers and
Gertrude Stein complements
home-shrouded Emily Dickinson. . .

Row ushers and Gertrude Stein
complements home-shrouded
Emily Dickinson, whose voice
sounds loudly, quite naturally , at
this South Hadley campus.
The characters range from a
Carson McCullers' renegade
(Carter, not a sister, beautifully
played by Rhonda /.irkle) to
Kate (Tammis Day). who aspires
to be "Katharine Hepburn in
Adam's Rib" — a Harvard
Law-bound career type with an
attache growing out of her side.
Rita, the most intriguing,
wants to get it on with men. wo
men. dogs, cats and ashtrays.
She's a bit of Erica Jong. Rita
Mae Brown, a would-be novelist
on the run. running not to but
toward, and always promising:
"In five years (from whenever)
we're gonna be pretty fucking in
credible." Katie Budge is pretty
incredible.
Ah. but also, there's Mullet

( Rhonda Spit/), awaiting her Pr
ince. She's torn between being
Liberated and "falling in
love...even if 1 do. I'll still re
member the art-history dates."
Samantha (Carla Befera) is en
gaged in her senior year. (" But."
sav her friends, "at least she's

made a choice.") Susie Friend
(Terry Ross) bats her eyes, plans
Piglet parties and organizes
dorm activities (including mys
tery elves which put Secret San
tas tii shame.) Fun stuff.
Wasserstem is less successful
with Holly and I.eilah. The parts

lack consistency and credibility.
Wasserstein tries to make Holly
( Diana Moore) a rich kid (daddy
invented velveteen) who wants
to be someone special, but who
can't get away from a father
standing in the distance, hands
on hips, waiting. Leilah (Cynthia
Wands) sulks and looks mvsteri
ous. Both roles lack solid moti\ a
tions. Both actresses give deter
mined performances but can't
quite make up for the holes.
The women suffer the proxim
ity of a house mother named
Mrs. Plumm. who knows how
and why you feel guilty and
makes it her duty to stick your
wounds with knitting needles.
Olwen Morgan and Wasserstein
combine for some good, but tired
laughs in this soft spot. Just too
much Mrs. Folgers-Amy Van
derbilt to survive.
Uncommon Women is a series
ot vignettes, centered on late
night meetings, when the day's
events are recounted for the
inner circle. "Sometimes I want a
date or a relationship to be over.
just so I can come back and tell
you all about it."
rhat secret community and
security reflect a strong sense of
womanlove. Blushing or blurt
ing. the "sisters" agree: yousei/e
a man's body, but you hug a wo
man's soul.
That need and hunger which
comes from wanting to be spe

cial, and yet not alone, of want
ing to press vour heart against
another's. Having choices. Not
deciding. Having none and de
spairing. Worst, thinking you
have them.
I ife can't be just Lei's Make a
Deal." I had a dream." Rita say s.
"My future was behind the cur
tain and the audience kept yel
ling. 'Take the box!'"
She refused. She had the
strength, Wasserstein tells us.
because women have the
strength, especially when joined
by women. Especially when
wanting to be uncommon.
