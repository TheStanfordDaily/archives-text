# Vermeer, Guarneri quartets
## A
						beautiful blend for Lively Arts 
### 
The Liv ely Arts held a furid raising con
cert last weekend in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium.
Concertgoei s paid up to $35 a ticket to
see the Vermeer and Guarneri string
quartets combine in a pleasant, some
times spectacular, afternoon of music.
The Vermeer quartet began the prog
ram with the Quartet No. 12 in E-flat.
Opus 127. by Beethoven. As performing
artists, the Vermeer musicians do not
enjoy the reputation many others do, but
their performance left no doubt about the
group's ability as individuals.
However, one felt that throughout the
Beethoven the quartet lacked the cohe
siveness and the instinct for ensemble
which arc required to perform the late
Beethoven quartets with success.
Each musician handled his part with
marvelous skill, yet the group sound
seemed to lack balance, texture and

dynamic contrast.
The problem of balance was apparent
especially in the first and second move
ments. during which first violinist Shmuel
Ashkenasi's sensitive interpretations
were covered by his collaborators.
I lowever. in sections of the work which
required force and power, the four voices
of the quartet worked in agreement.
Two in one
For the second half of the program, the
Vermeer Quartet combined with the
Guarneri Quartet in a performance of the
Octet in E-flat for Strings. Opus 20, by
Mendelssohn.
I liis portion of the concert left little to
be desired. The groups combined togiv e a
wonderfully spirited and exciting rendi
tion of this popular work.
Particularly exhilarating was the play
ing of Guarneri Quartet first violinist Ar
nold Steinhardt. Despite the intense

technical difficulty of his part, lie man
aged to project his sound through an ac
companiment which would overwhelm
most violinists. The other musicians each
displayed marvelous virtuosity when their
turn to handle principal subjects came.
Equally as impressive was the ability of
the groups to blend their individual
sounds. One was ama/ed that two ensem
bles which seldom play together could
manage to match each other's colors and
textures so well.
The entire performance of the piece
was well conceived. One felt that each
section flowed smoothly into the others,
giv ing the work a pleasing sense of order.
This was particularly true in the final
movement, during which the audience,
finding itself swept along to the "resolute
conclusion" mentioned in the program
notes responded with a standing ovation.
