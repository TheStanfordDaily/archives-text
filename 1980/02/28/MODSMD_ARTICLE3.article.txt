in Tehran yesterday in the second major show of
anti-American sentiment in three days. See page 2.
3-D pictures of Mars
Dr. C. Elliot Levinthal, an adjunct professor at the Medical
School here, has fused film from two different cameras to give
a special 3-D view of Mars. Using those photos, he also made a
movie which was shown here last night. See page 3.
Drama workshop
Sixteen hours a day, six days a week. Lots of work? Lots of fun.
Summer theater at Stanford promises 10 shows in eight weeks
— a great way to learn the trade, according to workshop
director Michael Ramsaur. See page 8.
