"When I started to to go to
college, my mother said she
didn't think I was very practi
cal and suggested more prac
tical professions," Men
delowitz told the Daily in Oc
tober.
"But my heart was set on
being an artist."
And an artist he became.
I le captured Bay area scenes,
often the most unlikely — the
Dumbarton salt flats, for in
stance — with a refreshing
free-flown style — usually in

his favorite medium:
"Watercolor was practical,
not messy to carry in the car.
Oils were just too slow. With
watercolor, you can finish a
painting in three to four
hours."
Mendelowitz also excelled
as a teacher and scholar. He
taught classes in art history
and studio art and also of
fered the state's first college
course in film history.
