# The 						Clash headed for crossroads in weekend shows
## 
### 
The Clash, who, if nothing else
â€¢probably are the most controver
sial rock band in the world, will
play Sun Francisco's Warfield
Theatre Saturday and Sunday
nights at 8.
The band consists of vocalist
and rhythm guitarist Joe Strum
mer, lead guitarist Mick Jones,
bassist Paul Simonon and
ilrummer Topper Headon.
Strummer and Jones co-write
most of the Clash's songs, and
Jones often shares the lead vocal
duties with Strummer.
The first Clash album, re
leased in late in England
but not issued in this country
until last year, stood lirmlv in the

political, so-called "punk" style,
jvvith its blistering, raw sound.
Without losing punk's reckless
energy and spirit, the hand has
tried to avoid the kind of self
destructiveness which consumed
the Sex Pistols.
Give 'Em Enough Rope, the
hand's second album, took
longer to record and was more
ambitious than the debut effort.
Without abandoning the punk
sound, the Clash were clearly in a
state of evolution.
With their latest release, the
19-song two-record set London
Calling, Hue Clash have squarely
placed themselves on the firing
line. The Clash still disdain a

"professional" studio sound, but
the new record features a wide
variety of musical styles, from
the roaring rocker
"Clampdown" and the reggae
" Revoluton Rock" (more typi
cal of the band's earlier sound) to
the near-ballad "Lost in the
Supermarket" and the virtual
pop song "Lovers Rock."
I'he record is currently in the
top 50 nationwide: many feel
that the Clash have repudiated
punk, and the calls of sell-out al
ready have been heard.
Critical reaction to the album
has been largely favorable, how -
ever. Many critics admire the
band's insolent, uncompromis

ing stance; tHey've dealt with the
new album by saying that this is
part of a natural growing-up pro
cess for the band, and they deny
that the Clash have abandoned
punk's ideals and spirit.
I"his weekend's shows should
be an excellent opportunity to
decide for yourself. Whether the
Clash highlight the diverse mate
rial of London ( ailing or em
phasize their earlier songs during
this eight-city tour will provide a
good indication of where the
band is heading.
And no matter where the
Clash go. controversy alwavs
seems to be close behind.
