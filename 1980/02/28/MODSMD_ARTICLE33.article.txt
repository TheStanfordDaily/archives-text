"We're looking lor people to
come and say, 'I'd like to play

show.' " Kamsaur explained.
The play s should reflect a eon
temporary American theme and
include works which are not usu

"We're going to do a lot more
Broadway stuff, maybe a melod-
—i

Resident costunier Barbara
Cleveland will design and lec
turer Paul Murgatroyd will be

"As tor the students," Rum
saur added, "that's up in the air.
We have to see what kind of re
sponse we have from Stanford
people . . . then, we can see how
big the shows should he, what
kind of plays we should do."
He said the summer workshop
offered more possibilities to ex
periment and indulge: "We
don't have to worry as much
about which play will help which
student academically ... or how
to give this director the best play
to use when he looks for a teach
ing position."
Also, the technical staff will
has e more fun. In both designing
and construction. "We use our
creativity a lot more than we do
during the year ... we have to.
Just like that you're putting up

another show. If something
needs to be fixed, you've got to
do it right then . . . There's no
waiting until tomorrow."
Despite the long hours and
grueling schedule, Ramsaur,
said, the ensemble participants
will have time for midnight par
ties. weekly picnics and vol
leyball games.
"So much work lends itselt to a
great sense of camaraderie. A
fellow ship dev clops which is ter
rific."
The department expects total
commitment from the program
participants.
And that, he said, is the fun.
Applications for the summer
workshop will be available at the
meeting or at the Drama De
