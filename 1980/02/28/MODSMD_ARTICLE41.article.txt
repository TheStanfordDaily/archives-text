' CONCORD. N.H. — President Jimmy Carter's
qtmpaigners are mapping a cross-country effort to
eliminate Sen. Edward Kennedy as a presidential
contender, but the senator said yesterday he'll fash

Iran says hostages stay to May
Iran's new parliament will not be ready to decide
the fate of the U.S. Embassy hostages until May at the
earliest, a top Iranian official said yesterday.
The official, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti. first
secretary of the Revolutionary Council, indicated
that only a change of heart by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini could lead to an earlier release of the hos
tages, held by Iranian militants since Nov. 4.

Khomeini, leader of Iran's revolution, said last
weekend the decision on whether to free the Ameri
cans would be up to the Majlis, or parliament, which
will be elected in March and early April.
Reacting to Beheshti's statements, a high-level
U.S. official said in Washington,"It would be of
grave concern if the process dragged on that long."
The U.N. investigative commission on Iran, con
tinuing its work in Tehran, met for two hours with
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and discussed
the commission's plans for visiting with the hostages,
U.N. officials said in New York.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar did not say
whether final plans had been agreed upon, but he said
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim "hopes the hos
tages can be seen soon."
The five-member commission was established to
hear Iranian grievances about alleged brutality and
corruption during the rule of the deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and alleged U.S. interfer
ence in Iranian affairs, and U.S. grievances over the
hostage-taking.
House panel slashes draft funds
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
draft registration plan failed its first test in Congress
when a House committee refused yesterday to ap
prove funds the administration had sought for the
program.
Opponents of registration hailed the House Ap
propriations subcommittee action as a serious set
back for the Carter administration.
However, administration officials and backers of
Carter's program predicted the president's plan will
be approved in the full Appropriations Committee at
a later date.
Carter had asked Congress for 521.9 million in the
current fiscal year to begin registering men and wo
men. aged 19 and 20. beginning this summer. The
committee did not even consider the issue of register
ing women, and first struck $8.5 million from the bill.
That left about 513.3 million in the bill.
On the key vote, the panel deadlocked 6-6 on
whether to recommend approval of the $13.3 million.
A tie vote traditionally kills a measure, but Carter's
supporters tried to argue that the bill should be sent
to the full committee for action, anyway.
In the end. the committee decided to approve legis
lation appropriating $4.7 million — an amount that
would not allow for registration this year. But it
would finance a program proposed by Selective Ser
\ ice — and later discarded — for a registrating prog
ram only after the president signed an emergency
proclamation to mobilize recruits.

MANILA. Philippines — All but one of 135 per
sons aboard survived a fire and explosion that

dived unexpectedly as he landed and he could not
regain control. The Philippine Bureau of Air Trans
portation began an investigation to determine the
cause of the crash.

based airline, said three passengers earlier reported
missing had been located during overnight checks of
Manila hospitals.
She said 74 passengers were unhurt. 15 were in
jured slightly and 35 remained in hospitals. The 1 1

Afghan repression on increase
ISLAMABAD. Pakistan — Afghan authorities re
sorted to large-scale repression and executions fol
lowing last week's anti-Soviet uprising in the capital
of Kabul, according to a report published here yes

terday.
Mass arrests also were made, the report said.
Medical sources said at least 300 civilians and an
undetermined number of Soviet and Afghan troops
were killed in the fighting that led to the imposition of
martial law in Kabul. That, in effect, made the Soviet
commander there the head of the Afghan govern
ment.
In one incident, the report said, rebels ambushed a
caravan of government troops on a road
Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, and Kabul and
"killed 400 troops and destroyed a number of ar
mored vehicles."
There were indications, meanwhile, that Soviet
leaders were softening conditions under which they
might withdraw their troops.
In Moscow, American businessman Armand
Hammer said Soviet President Lenoid Brezhnev told
him during a meeting that the "problem could be
solved" if the United States and Afghanistan's
neighbors "guarantee they would tise their influ
ence" to end interference in Afghanistan's internal
affairs. /
Some U.S. analysts now believe the Soviets would
have to send 400.000 troops into Afghanistan to
smash the insurgency, and one militaty' specialist,
who asked not to be identified, said. "The smart
money says the Russians have a very difficult
ballgame ahead of them" if they stay in Afghanistan.

OROVILLE — Two white men who admitted
murdering a deaf black man because they found no
game to kill on a drunken hunting expedition were
sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison
yesterday by a judge who said they should never be
set free.

have demonstrated for some time their total disre
gard for the rights of others," said Butte County

"Their action in this case was callous and malicious
with a total wanton disregard for the right of another
to live ... it is my recommendation that their terms
be fixed at life and that they be kept in prison for life
without any parole whatsoever at any time."
The sentence is the maximum for the first-degree
murder charge to which Noor, 19, and McCarter, 20,
pleaded guilty Jan. 30.

Iran says hostages stay to May
Iran's new parliament will not be ready to decide
the fate of the U.S. Embassy hostages until May at the
earliest, a top Iranian official said yesterday.
The official, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti. first
secretary of the Revolutionary Council, indicated
that only a change of heart by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini could lead to an earlier release of the hos
tages, held by Iranian militants since Nov. 4.

Khomeini, leader of Iran's revolution, said last
weekend the decision on whether to free the Ameri
cans would be up to the Majlis, or parliament, which
will be elected in March and early April.
Reacting to Beheshti's statements, a high-level
U.S. official said in Washington,"It would be of
grave concern if the process dragged on that long."
The U.N. investigative commission on Iran, con
tinuing its work in Tehran, met for two hours with
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and discussed
the commission's plans for visiting with the hostages,
U.N. officials said in New York.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar did not say
whether final plans had been agreed upon, but he said
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim "hopes the hos
tages can be seen soon."
The five-member commission was established to
hear Iranian grievances about alleged brutality and
corruption during the rule of the deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and alleged U.S. interfer
ence in Iranian affairs, and U.S. grievances over the
hostage-taking.
House panel slashes draft funds
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
draft registration plan failed its first test in Congress
when a House committee refused yesterday to ap
prove funds the administration had sought for the
program.
Opponents of registration hailed the House Ap
propriations subcommittee action as a serious set
back for the Carter administration.
However, administration officials and backers of
Carter's program predicted the president's plan will
be approved in the full Appropriations Committee at
a later date.
Carter had asked Congress for 521.9 million in the
current fiscal year to begin registering men and wo
men. aged 19 and 20. beginning this summer. The
committee did not even consider the issue of register
ing women, and first struck $8.5 million from the bill.
That left about 513.3 million in the bill.
On the key vote, the panel deadlocked 6-6 on
whether to recommend approval of the $13.3 million.
A tie vote traditionally kills a measure, but Carter's
supporters tried to argue that the bill should be sent
to the full committee for action, anyway.
In the end. the committee decided to approve legis
lation appropriating $4.7 million — an amount that
would not allow for registration this year. But it
would finance a program proposed by Selective Ser
\ ice — and later discarded — for a registrating prog
ram only after the president signed an emergency
proclamation to mobilize recruits.

Afghan repression on increase
ISLAMABAD. Pakistan — Afghan authorities re
sorted to large-scale repression and executions fol
lowing last week's anti-Soviet uprising in the capital
of Kabul, according to a report published here yes

terday.
Mass arrests also were made, the report said.
Medical sources said at least 300 civilians and an
undetermined number of Soviet and Afghan troops
were killed in the fighting that led to the imposition of
martial law in Kabul. That, in effect, made the Soviet
commander there the head of the Afghan govern
ment.
In one incident, the report said, rebels ambushed a
caravan of government troops on a road
Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, and Kabul and
"killed 400 troops and destroyed a number of ar
mored vehicles."
There were indications, meanwhile, that Soviet
leaders were softening conditions under which they
might withdraw their troops.
In Moscow, American businessman Armand
Hammer said Soviet President Lenoid Brezhnev told
him during a meeting that the "problem could be
solved" if the United States and Afghanistan's
neighbors "guarantee they would tise their influ
ence" to end interference in Afghanistan's internal
affairs. /
Some U.S. analysts now believe the Soviets would
have to send 400.000 troops into Afghanistan to
smash the insurgency, and one militaty' specialist,
who asked not to be identified, said. "The smart
money says the Russians have a very difficult
ballgame ahead of them" if they stay in Afghanistan.

OROVILLE — Two white men who admitted
murdering a deaf black man because they found no
game to kill on a drunken hunting expedition were
sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison
yesterday by a judge who said they should never be
set free.
"Marvin Dean Noorand James Thomas McCarter
have demonstrated for some time their total disre

Superior Court Judge Jean Morony.
"Their action in this case was callous and malicious
with a total wanton disregard for the right of another
to live ... it is my recommendation that their terms
be fixed at life and that they be kept in prison for life
without any parole whatsoever at any time."
The sentence is the maximum for the first-degree
murder charge to which Noor, 19, and McCarter, 20,
pleaded guilty Jan. 30.

Campbell, 22, from their car as he walked along a
railroad track in nearby Chico on Jan. 13, 1979. They

Iran says hostages stay to May
Iran's new parliament will not be ready to decide
the fate of the U.S. Embassy hostages until May at the
earliest, a top Iranian official said yesterday.
The official, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti. first
secretary of the Revolutionary Council, indicated
that only a change of heart by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini could lead to an earlier release of the hos
tages, held by Iranian militants since Nov. 4.

Khomeini, leader of Iran's revolution, said last
weekend the decision on whether to free the Ameri
cans would be up to the Majlis, or parliament, which
will be elected in March and early April.
Reacting to Beheshti's statements, a high-level
U.S. official said in Washington,"It would be of
grave concern if the process dragged on that long."
The U.N. investigative commission on Iran, con
tinuing its work in Tehran, met for two hours with
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh and discussed
the commission's plans for visiting with the hostages,
U.N. officials said in New York.
U.N. spokesman Rudolf Stajduhar did not say
whether final plans had been agreed upon, but he said
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim "hopes the hos
tages can be seen soon."
The five-member commission was established to
hear Iranian grievances about alleged brutality and
corruption during the rule of the deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and alleged U.S. interfer
ence in Iranian affairs, and U.S. grievances over the
hostage-taking.
House panel slashes draft funds
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
draft registration plan failed its first test in Congress
when a House committee refused yesterday to ap
prove funds the administration had sought for the
program.
Opponents of registration hailed the House Ap
propriations subcommittee action as a serious set
back for the Carter administration.
However, administration officials and backers of
Carter's program predicted the president's plan will
be approved in the full Appropriations Committee at
a later date.
Carter had asked Congress for 521.9 million in the
current fiscal year to begin registering men and wo
men. aged 19 and 20. beginning this summer. The
committee did not even consider the issue of register
ing women, and first struck $8.5 million from the bill.
That left about 513.3 million in the bill.
On the key vote, the panel deadlocked 6-6 on
whether to recommend approval of the $13.3 million.
A tie vote traditionally kills a measure, but Carter's
supporters tried to argue that the bill should be sent
to the full committee for action, anyway.
In the end. the committee decided to approve legis
lation appropriating $4.7 million — an amount that
would not allow for registration this year. But it
would finance a program proposed by Selective Ser
\ ice — and later discarded — for a registrating prog
ram only after the president signed an emergency
proclamation to mobilize recruits.

Afghan repression on increase
ISLAMABAD. Pakistan — Afghan authorities re
sorted to large-scale repression and executions fol
lowing last week's anti-Soviet uprising in the capital
of Kabul, according to a report published here yes

terday.
Mass arrests also were made, the report said.
Medical sources said at least 300 civilians and an
undetermined number of Soviet and Afghan troops
were killed in the fighting that led to the imposition of
martial law in Kabul. That, in effect, made the Soviet
commander there the head of the Afghan govern
ment.
In one incident, the report said, rebels ambushed a
caravan of government troops on a road
Jalalabad, in eastern Afghanistan, and Kabul and
"killed 400 troops and destroyed a number of ar
mored vehicles."
There were indications, meanwhile, that Soviet
leaders were softening conditions under which they
might withdraw their troops.
In Moscow, American businessman Armand
Hammer said Soviet President Lenoid Brezhnev told
him during a meeting that the "problem could be
solved" if the United States and Afghanistan's
neighbors "guarantee they would tise their influ
ence" to end interference in Afghanistan's internal
affairs. /
Some U.S. analysts now believe the Soviets would
have to send 400.000 troops into Afghanistan to
smash the insurgency, and one militaty' specialist,
who asked not to be identified, said. "The smart
money says the Russians have a very difficult
ballgame ahead of them" if they stay in Afghanistan.

OROVILLE — Two white men who admitted
murdering a deaf black man because they found no
game to kill on a drunken hunting expedition were
sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison
yesterday by a judge who said they should never be
set free.
"Marvin Dean Noorand James Thomas McCarter
have demonstrated for some time their total disre

Superior Court Judge Jean Morony.
"Their action in this case was callous and malicious
with a total wanton disregard for the right of another
to live ... it is my recommendation that their terms
be fixed at life and that they be kept in prison for life

sentenced to the maximum 25 years to life in prison
yesterday by a judge who said they should never be
set free.
"Marvin Dean Noorand James Thomas McCarter
have demonstrated for some time their total disre
gard for the rights of others," said Butte County
Superior Court Judge Jean Morony.
"Their action in this case was callous and malicious
with a total wanton disregard for the right of another
to live ... it is my recommendation that their terms
be fixed at life and that they be kept in prison for life
without any parole whatsoever at any time."
The sentence is the maximum for the first-degree
murder charge to which Noor, 19, and McCarter, 20,
pleaded guilty Jan. 30.
Noor and McCarter admitted shooting Jimmy Lee
Campbell, 22, from their car as he walked along a
railroad track in nearby Chico on Jan. 13, 1979. They
had been drinking heavily and had been unable to
find a deer or a cow to shoot.
