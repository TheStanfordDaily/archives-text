### Fred Yen Staff Writer 
Finding few points of disagreement,
campus supporters of presidential
hopefuls Howard Baker and George
Bush debated the candidates' respec
tive qualifications and discussed plat
form issues on KZSU's Campus Con
ference Tuesday night.
In a live broadcast from Roble
Lounge, supporters of Bush and Baker
said their candidates both support the
development of alternative energy
sources, a stronger national defense
and a balanced federal budget. Each
group also outlined additional reasons
they felt make their candidate the most
capable man for the presidency.
The Baker camp stressed the
senator's record and experience as a
decision maker, primarily as minority
leader and as a member of the foreign
relations committee. They said Baker
is clearly the most electable of all the
major GOP candidates, and is the Re
publican that President Jimmy Carter
fears the most.
They added that Baker had proven
his electability.against Democrats by
becoming the first Republican Senator
from Tennessee, and they said that
Baker possessed the ability to work in a
bi-partisan way. Baker, they said, "has
refused to fulfill the role of a knee-jerk
opposition."
With respect to foreign affairs.
Baker's supporters said that "none of
his opponents can equal his detailed,
up-to-date, hands-on experience in

foreign policy." They noted that Baker
has met with 35 foreign leaders, includ
ing two meetings with Soviet President
Leonid Brezhnev.
According to his supporters, Bush
feels that during the 19K()s the United
States "will enter a period of maximum
and unprecedented vulnerability to a
Soviet 'first strike."'They cited Bush's
experience as United Nations ambas
sador, CIA director and China liaison
as ample evidence of the candidate's
ability to conduct foreign policy.
The Baker camp also outlined their
candidate's key domestic issues. They
said Baker favors increased revenue
sharing and a constitutional amend
ment to force the government to ba
lance the budget, hut only if that
amendment would allow Congress to
over-ride the budget constraints by a
two-thirds vote.
In the most substantive disagree
ment ot the debate. Bush's supporters
said their candidate does not favor a
constitutional amendment to balance
the budget because it denies the presi
dent flexibility in key situations. In
stead, Bush favors indexing personal
income tax rates to the rate of inflation,
they said.
Concentrating on Bush's specific
ideas for solving America's problems,
the candidate's supporters described
plans to revamp the nation's railway
system, provide federal transportation
assistance to the handicapped, bring
back the B-l bomber and develop the
neutron bomb.
Both sides stated that their candi
dates favored tax cuts to stimulate the
private sector and opposed the current
SALT II treaty.
The debate was organized with the
help of the College Republicans.
