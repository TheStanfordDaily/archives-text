Corrections
A Daily restaurant review Feb. 22
urged patrons of a Portola Valley re
staurant, the Portola Valley Kitchen, to
walk through orchards and fields adja
cent to the restaurant. The Daily
wishes to make clear that those areas
are private property. Accordingly,
walking through them would constitute
trespassing and hence be illegal.
Yesterday, the Daily stated that the
Stanford Hospital agreed to cosponsor
the Penthouse carwash. According to
Inter-Fraternity Council President
John Kinney, the Hospital, as well as
Coors Beer, are only potential spon
sors of the event.
Also yesterday, the Daily stated that
the Burbank-House-produced play.
Something Funny Happened on the
Way to the Forum, would be produced
tonight and Friday. The performances
are in fact tonight and Saturday.
The Daily regrets the errors.
