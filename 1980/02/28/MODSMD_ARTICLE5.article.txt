# Senate discusses moving ASSU elections to spring
## 
### Fran Miller Staff Writer 
"The purpose of election reform is to
strengthen the senate as an institution
and to give it a broader basis for growth
in the future," said ASSU Sen. Marc
Ventresca. one of the main proponents
of reform, at last night's senate meet
ing.
After a two-hour debate, the senate
voted 12 to 3 to send the original re
form proposals back to the Rules
Committee.
The committee will draw up a formal
proposal that the full senate will vote
on at its March 12 meeting.
The proposal, submitted to the se
nate by the Rules Committee would
move the current fall elections to the
spring. Ten non-voting members
would be appointed by the senate in the
fall. Four of these "senate associates"
would be freshman and new student
transfers, four would be first-year
graduate students and two would come
from either group.

Fourteen senators must vote in favor
of the proposal to place it on the spring
ballot.
Ron Johnson, a former senator who
assisted the Rules Committee,
explained to the senate that this is the
second time in several years that a re
form proposal has heen put before the
senate. He said, " It is important to re
member that no proposal is perfect,
that it must be approved early in order
to go into effect this year, and that if it is
complex, students won't go for it."
Leading the discussion. Deputy Se
nate Chair Yvonne Hiltz explained the
process the committee went through in
arriving at the current proposal.
She said the biggest problems with
the present system of fall elections is
the lack of continuity and experience
from year to year. Because there is no
time for senators to orient themselves
to their jobs, she said, it takes at least
two or three meetings for the senators
to get acquainted and organized.
"In other words," she said, "we have
essentially a two-quarter senate and
that's not enough time to get anything
done."
Three types
Hiltz listed pros and cons of the three
types of election reforms discussed at
committee meetings. These were dis
tricting, staggered elections and spring
.elections.
She said that although districting
would give students greater accessibil
ity to senators and provide for more
effective campaigning, there were pos
sibilities for gerrymandering.
Minorities would have less opportunity
for representation, she added.
The strength of elections staggered
throughout the year included the pos
sibility of having freshman and transfer
senators and would provide for con
tinuity. However, Hiltz cited logistical
problems including the timing of the
elections, as an argument against this
type of election process.

Hiltz said that spring elections for
the following year's senate would pro
vide the continuity that is desired and
time during the summer for senators to
begin organizing. It would also save
money, she said, because the ASSU
structure is largely set up in the spring,
with the selection of project managers
and the Council of Presidents.
There would also be a larger voter
turnout in the spring, she added, and
students would be more informed
about the issues. She said that although
people would not be able to "see the
political action in process in the fall,"
freshmen, transfers and first-year
graduate students who are interested in
student government could apply
through the ASSU Nominations
Committee to be senate associates.
Johnson argued in favor of this
proposal, citing statistics from previous
referenda which show that 70 percent
of the voters said they wanted election
reform. However, the majority of vot
ers were against staggered elections
and districting. Spring elections were
not part of those straw votes.
Graduate opposition
The greatest opposition to the prop
osal came from graduate students who
said that not as many people would run
in the spring because they would an
ticipate heavy course loads. Although
it was proposed to have a separate elec
tion for graduate senators through the
Graduate Student Association, oppo
nents of that idea suggested that a sepa
rate election would only serve to widen
the gap between undergraduates and
graduates.
Sen. Chris Heftel commented that
although maybe fewergraduates would
run for election in the spring, there
would he a bigger voter turnout.
In other senate business. Sen. Dick
Butterfield gave a report on the prog
ress of the Coffeehouse Task Force
which is working on a plan for a
student-run Coffeehouse. He said that
