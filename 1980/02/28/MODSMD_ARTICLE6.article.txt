# Bar owner countersues
## Homeowner files suit against the Oasis 
### Dianne Cahoon News Editor 
The Oasis Beer Garden, a Menlo
Park establishment frequented by Uni
versity students since the repeal of
Prohibition in the early 19305. has
been sued by owners of an adjacent
residence for operating in a manner in
compatible with the surrounding resi
dential area.
The Oasis has filed a countersuit.
Fred and Cheryl Slightam, who
purchased the fS 12 Cambridge Ave.
house last November for investment
purposes, filed suit against the Oasis in
Menlo Park small claims court shortly
thereafter. They are requesting
$250,000 in damages resulting from
the "diminuation of property values
because of the way the Oasis is operat
ing," according to their attorney.
Clayton Rost.
The Slightams are further asking for
a court injunction barring the con
tinued operation of the bar in the same
manner.
The suit claims that the Oasis is "of
fensive to the senses" because of flood
lights and loudspeaker announcements
emanating from its patio and because
of the alleged indecent behavior of its
patrons.
The Slightams complained that the
tavern's customers litter and urinate on

nearby lawns, as well as shouting and
racing their car engines in the parking
lot bordering the Slightam property.
Bernard Tougas, owner of the Oasis
for 22 years, has filed a countersuit
against the couple in San Mateo
County Superior Court for more than
$1 million in damages stemming from
the Slightams' alleged harassment.
Rost said that his clients' (the
Slightams) suit "arises as a dispute in
which the Oasis management doesn't
want to modify its operating manner."
Although the bar is situated on the El
Camino strip zoned for commercial en
tities. Rost maintained that it can't be
operated so as to cause damage to the
neighboring area.
As the crowded and raucous atmos
phere of the Oasis"is conducting a nui
sance on property rights" and driving
down rents, his clients desire that the
residential character of their property
be preserved, Rost said.
The Slightams, who do not actually
inhabit the house concerned, were not
available for comment.
Tougas said that this is the first legal
action ever instituted against the Oasis
and intimated that the true reason for
the Slightam suit involved motivation
other than their stated grounds.
He said he had held a gentlemen's
agreement for; about 10 years with the

house's previous owner, Mario Testa,
to rent five parking spaces on Testa's
land.
Last August,.Tougas refused a rent
hike on the parking spaces from $75 to
$ 125. Tougas and Testa settled upon a
monthly price of $100 for the "unim
proved parking â€” no stripes and trees
in your windshield," Tougas said. The
Slightams, however, upon obtaining
ownership, demanded a 150 percent
increase in the parking price to $250.
Slightam "said he was buried in his
property and had to have more
money." Tougas related. "I said 1
wasn't interested. The rent had just
been raised, and it was really just plain
and simple economics."
When Tougas refused to agree to the
price increase, Slightam "brought up
the noise." the Oasis owner said. Then,
"when I said, 'if I pay, would it stop the
noise?' Slightam said, 'it would help,"'
Tougasadded.
Informed of that comment. Rost
said, "1 do not believe that's correct.
That's not the version my clients told
me."
Following Tougas' refusal. Slightam
constructed a fence around the space
and filed the suit against Tougas, who
countersued.
"It's principle. If (Slightam) had
been reasonable, thete would have

been no problem. Tougas said.
"Through the years, there have been
very few, isolated cases of complaints,"
he stated. "Certainly nothing like this.
J'd always been able to get along with
(Testa) very well."
Yet, Rost emphasized, "my client is
attempting and has attempted to be
reasonable in trying to find some
method of compatibility to maintain
the residential nature of the area and is
willing to do that which is necessary" to
accomplish that goal.
"The parking is a diversionary mat
ter," used to cloud the "real issue of
what's right and just in operating the
establishment in a residential area,"
Rost asserted. "If you owned the Oasis
and didn't want to change the opera
tion. it would be good to find some kind
of claim," he said.
Menlo Park Police Supervising
Agent Sarita Ledet said her depart
ment has fewer problems with the
Oasis than with most other bars in the
city, according to a report in the Penin
sula Times Tribune.
Since 1972, police have written re
ports about incidents at the Oasis on an
average of less than three times a year.
"That's really low for a bar." according
to Ledet. "On a scale of one to 10, I'd
izive that a two.
