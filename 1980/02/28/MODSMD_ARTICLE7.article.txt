# All oppose registration
## Five candidates challenge McCloskey 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
For more than a decade. Congressman Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) has represented the
12th District in the United States House of Represen
tees.
Over the past twelve years, McCloskey has de
feated all contenders for his Congressional post. Yet
five of those challenging the Republican in the up
coming September election say they have solid
chances of ending his reign.
Those who have announced their intentions to run
include Kirsten Olsen and Marc Strassman on the
Democratic ticket. Libertarian Bill Evers, Adelc
Fuminofor the Peace and Freedom Party and Royce
Cole on the Republican ticket.

Though varied in political beliefs and goals, all are
united in their opposition to registration and the draft
at this time, and emphasize that defeating McCloskey
will signal to other congressmen and public officials
just how unpalatable the reinstitution of registration
is to the American people.
Olsen, a 37-year-old Palo Alto stockbroker, will be
facing McCloskey for the second time, should she win
the Democratic primaries. In the 1978 Congressional

elections, Olsen received only 21.5 percent of the
total tally, McCloskey defeating her by more than
80,000 votes. She said she feels she has a chance of
winning this time because she is a better candidate.
Naming the draft issue as the focal point of her
campaign and condemning McCloskey's National
Youth Service proposition as a form of youth slavery,
Olsen added that she would never support the draft in
any form.
Olsen also contended that McCloskey ignores a
large part of the 12th district, which stretches from
Redwood City to northern San Jose, in particular
many of its economic concerns.
"He spends too much time gallavanting around on
cosmic issues," Olsen said. He also spends too much
time with national, rather than local concerns, she
added.
Olsen pointed out that her positions on certain
issues have effected McCloskey's stand and in some
instances he has adopted her issues as his own.
"Originally McCloskey voted against the Equal
Rights Amendment, but later voted for it because I
became a candidate in support of the ERA." Olsen
said.
Strassman, a 32-year-old graduate of Harvard who
is currently a typist for Pacific Sun Incorporated, a
solar energy firm, will be opposing Olsen in the
Democratic primaries.

Strassman will be emphasizing "generational is
sues" which he defines as the need to bring the ideas,
background and temperament of a younger genera
tion into government.
"Most of the politicians in office belong to an older
generation and their solutions reflect their view of the
world," he said. "These people have a different set of
priorities and values from ours."
Strassman's other major interests are "electronic
democracy" and energy self-sufficiency.
He said he visualizes a society linked by computer
technology that will give each individual access to any
desired information and also allow the individual's
responses to be processed and considered.
Strassman's vision of computers in every home ties
in with his energy policy, since need for transporta
tion will be greatly decreased by the availability of
information at home.
Our basic energy problem is being dependent on
depleting resources, the candidate said.
"The solution is to use renewable energy re
sources, principally solar energy, and also wind, tidal,
ocean, which is being investigated, and hydroelec
tric power," he said.
He does not, however, support the development of
nuclear energy.
"A vote for me is a vote against the draft and
against nuclear energy," Strassman declared.
