WASHINGTON — Kim Jae Kyu. confessed as
sassin of South Korea's President Park Chung Hee.
has sent a secret appeal to that country's highest
court to be allowed to commit suicide rather than
he executed. The suicide proposal was included in a
court document privately circulated in Korea and
made available to The Washington Post.
There is virtually no chance that South Korea's
Supreme Court will comply with Kim's emotional
plea, contained in a 16-page memorandum pre
pared by his lawyers and submitted to the court
Feb. 5. A final review of Kim's death sentence is
scheduled to be concluded next month with the
execution expected to follow soon after.
The memorandum was couched in terms that
made it in part a last political testimonial and in
part an effort by Kim to depict himself as a patriot
who shot and killed Park Oct. 26 to save the coun
try a bloodbath and to "restore liberal democ
racy."
"If the government executes me." Kim wrote.

"citizens will bear a grudge against the govern
ment.'" He argues that it he were to take his own
life his death would not become a catalyst for the
renewal of anti-government activities among stu
dents, religious leaders and intellectuals.
In the memorandum. Kim also claimed that he
had been tortured by his interrogators and forced
to donate all of his property to the government. He
asked that the property be returned and distributed
to families of his co-defendants.
Kim asserted that the potential for a civilian
uprising against the "dictatorial regime of Park"
was tar more serious than has generally been
realized. Kim claimed that Park was about to throw
the country into turmoil by launching a bloody
repression against students in Pusan and other
urban centers.
The students rioted against Park's rule in early
October and sparked a political crisis within South
Korea. Kim's assertions portrayed a much wider
dissatisfaction with the government than the gov
ernment has ever acknowledged.
