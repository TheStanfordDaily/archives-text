# Israelis raid West Bank town

### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
HAI HOUI.. Occupied West Bank - Ul
tranationalist vigilantes from a nearby Israeli set
tlement raided this Arab town early Wednesday,
breaking windows, slashing tires ot about 30 cars
and threatening residents at gunpoint,
townspeople and municipal officials said.
The 2 a.m. attack was the latest of a series ot
blood-feud clashes here and in nearby Hebron,
where a 23-year-old Israeli settler was murdered
last month. Wednesday's attack appeared to be
part ot a vendetta by Jewish civilian settlers from
the Kiryat Arba settlement, who have demanded
the right to move into houses in exclusively Arab
I lebron.
Halhoul has been the scene ol numerous de
monstrations against the occupation (if the West
Bank by Israel, and following Wednesday's raid,
students trom a girls' school pelted a tourist bus
with rocks, slightly injuring the driver.
Officials at the military government headquar
ters said they did not know who participated in
Wednesday's attack on Arab-owned cars, in which
two carloads ot armed men swept through the town
smashing the windshields ol parked automobiles
with rifle butts and hammers, according to Halhoul
residents.
But every local resident interviewed pointed in
the direction ot Kiryat Arba. a sprawling urban
development on the outskirts ol Hebron, and com
plained bitterlv that residents there were responsi
ble.
'Unwanted'
"They consider us unwanted people in our own
town. We can't protect ourselves. We can't carry a
knife or a club, or the (army ) patrols will arrest us.
We want to live justly. We don't want to be ruled by
Kiryat Arba." said Muhammed Kashkis. whose
Volkswagen minibus was heavily damaged.
Tow nspeople pointed to two cars parked just oft
the main Jerusalem-Hebron road, one with blue
license tags denoting Arab ownership, and the
other with yellow Israeli tags, owned by a Bedouin
Israeli citi/en visiting overnight here. The
windshield of the blue-tagged car was splintered,
but that ol the other vehicle was untouched.

Police Wednesday night said they had arrested
an Israeli, described as a "former" Kiryat resident,
as a suspect in the raid. Authorities said they had
counted 27 cars damaged in the attack. They said
the suspect may he the "key" to identifying others
mv oKed.
Curfew
Abdul Al-Atrash.a member ol the town council,
said several residents heard breaking glass and in
vestigated but were ordered inside by men carrying
rifles because a "curlew" was in effect. Halhoul.
which frequently is sealed oft by security forces, is
not currently under a curlew.
The townspeople described the armed men as
Jewish ci\ ilians. A spokesman for the military gov -
ernment said "unknown people" caused the dam
age. although it was learned authorities were ques
tioning people at Kiryat Arba, which is a center for
Rabbi Meir Kahane's militant Jewish Defense
League. The JDI lias been implicated in similar
raids in the past.
The Halhoul municipal council drafted a tele
gram Wednesday to be sent to United Nations
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim complaining
about the "cruel actions" of Kiryat Arba settlers.
The U.N. Security Council is considering motions
against Israel's settlement policies.
Encouragement
During the Halhoul council meeting, several
members charged that the Kiryat Arba residents
have been encouraged by a lack of action by the
military government in such incidents. "They
won't punish Kiryat Arba. I can promise you that.
Wednesday they damaged 40 cars. Next time they
may kill 40 people, but nothing will be done." said
one councilman, who asked not to be named.
In March, during a rock-throwing demonstra
tion here, army troops and armed Kiryat Arba
settlers opened lire on a group ot students, killing
two. including a 1 7-year-old girl. Nobody has been
charged in that incident, which resulted in a 1 7-day
curfew in Halhoul. although one Kiryat Arba set
tler was held for a while because authorities
learned he had changed the barrel of his rifle, fie
was released lor lack of evidence.
Since then, security forces have broken up
numerous protests in the town in which Israeli cars
have been stoned while passing through Halhoul.
