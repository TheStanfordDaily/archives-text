# Vance restates Iran 'understanding'
## 
### Oswald Johnston The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — In the
face of repeated public signals
from Iran that the U.S. hostages
may be held many more weeks.
Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance Wednesday restated the
administration's belief that it was
a firm "understanding" that the
captives will be released while
the United Nations commission
now in Tehran does its work.
The commission, Vance told
reporters at the State Depart
ment. had a two-fold mandate,
worked out in negotiations at the
U.N. in recent weeks: "To hear
the grievances of Iran, and to
bring about a speedy release ol
the hostages and end the crisis."
Vance declared in un
equivocal terms that, despite
Iranian denials that the commis
sion mandate has anv connection

with the hostages, "the under
standing ol the United Nations
and ourselves has been clearly
set forth by the secretary-general
(Kurt Waldheim) . . . the under
stand ing was a nd re ma ins clear."
Nevertheless. U.S. officials
privately expressed increasing
concern that public statements
by Iranian clerics have thrown
the understanding into doubt.
And one official declared that
the Carter administration would
regard with "grave concern" any
delay until April or May in decid
ing the hostages' fate.
Ayatollah Mohammed Be
heshti, a prominent cleric closely
identified with the views of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
was quoted Wednesday as saying
that the still-unelected Iranian
parliament could not act on the
hostages question before May.
Khomeini last Saturday jolted
U.S. officials by announcing that
the question ot the hostages
could not be decided in conjunc
tion with the I .N. commission's
expected two-week stay in
fehran, but rather by the parli
ament. which will not assume of
fice until April.
As a result ot this erosion ot

the administration's "under
standing" with Waldheim and
Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr. officials have begun
to declare that no deadline for
release ol the hostages had ever
been realistically expected.
At the same time, the officials
conceded privately that Presi
dent Jimmy Carter took a politi
cal risk when he agreed to the
dispatch ot the U.N. commission
— a risk that Bani-Sadr and Ira
nian authorities have yet to
match. To meet its end ot the
bargain, the government in
Tehran would have to put its au
thority on the line and take con
trol ot the hostages from the
militants holding them in the
U.S. Embassy.
l ar from doing so. it now ap
pears that the Iranians are deny
ing there ever was such a bar
gain. Instead, they have won.
without cost, what they had been
seeking since the crisis began last
Nov ember: a public airing of the
alleged crimes ol the deposed
shah ot Iran before any com
mitment is made to release the
hostages.
The administration has little
bargaining leverage left. In fact.

the United States appears to be
limited to three unsatisfactory
options it administration
policymakers conclude that the
understanding has been viol
ated:
— Persuade Waldheim that
Ins own prestige and that ol the
U.N. is at stake and urge him to
recall the five-man commission
before it has finished hearing the
Iranian case.
— Urge the commission to
delay issuing its report on Ira
nian grievances until the hos
tages are released.
— Urge delay ot the final re
port but permit the commission
to issue a preliminary report
while still in Tehran as a gesture
of good faith.
"If it begins to look as though
things have eroded too far, I
think we would ardently urge our
case on the secretary-general,"
an official said.
Publicly, however, officials are
taking the position that the
statements coming out ol Tehran
are predictable rhetoric repeated
lor reasons ot domestic politics
and are not a serious indication
of what will really happen.
