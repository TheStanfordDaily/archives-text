# Studies urge nuclear energy development

The Los Angeles Times
VIENNA, Austria — A 59-
nation technical conference con
cluded Wednesday that world
nuclear energy development
must he continued despite the
danger of the spread of nuclear
weapons.
It set forth this priority in a
communique that ended a two
year evaluation of nuclear fuel
problems which resulted in an
exhaustive and massive series ot
technical studies.
The countries involved in the
International Nuclear Fuel Cycle
Evaluation Conference agreed
that "effective measures can and
should he taken to minimize the
danger" of the proliferation of
nuclear weapons.
But they also agreed that
non-proliferation measures had
to he applied "without jeopar
dizing energy supplies or the de

velopment of nuclear energy for
peaceful purposes."
The technical studies them
selves also endorsed both the de
velopment of fast-breeder nuc
lear reactors which run on
plutonium, and the economic
and technical necessity for re
processing used nuclear-tuel
rods. Both moves will increase
the amount of weapons-grade
plutonium in the world. But the
technical studies found both
steps to be justified and neces
sary from the standpoint ol im
proving the world's energy sup
ply.
By coincidence, as the meeting
ended, the nationalized Electric
ity Authority of France an
nounced in Paris that it would
place orders for two massive
fast-breeder reactors, each cap
able of producing power in the
1500-megawatt range before
19N5. France is already far ahead
in fast-breeder reactor develop
ment, with completion of a
1300-megawatt plant due to
come on line to produce power in
1983.
The conclusionsof the massive
INFCE study now pose some
philosophical and policy ques
tions for the Carter administra
tion, which started things in 1977
in an effort to alert the world to
the dangers of weapons prolifer
ation inherent in the growth of
nuclear power.
When President Jimmy Carter
took office, he stopped work on
construction of a big U.S. repro
cessing center and tried to halt
fast-breeder development in the
United States. He also drasti
cally tightened licensing proce
dures and controls over U.S. ex
ports (if enriched uranium.
I'he hope of the administra
tion apparently was to gain con
sensus on the limitation of nuc
lear power development that
would increase the amount of
plutonium in the world and
thereby increase the danger of
proliferation.
But as the eight volumes of
technical studies and the final
communique of this conference
conclude, world consensus is that
nuclear power development
must go forward without being
circumscribed or impeded.
