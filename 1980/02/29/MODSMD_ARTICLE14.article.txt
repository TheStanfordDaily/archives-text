# Soviets see Afghan reality through deaths
## 
### Dan Fisher The Los Angeles Times 
MOSCOW â€” The photograph ot the
young Russian soldier is in a new black
mourning frame. His mother has a certificate
saying he died a hero, defending his home
land.
Death in war is no stranger in this country.
It is hard to find a Soviet family that was not
touched by the slaughter of World War 11.
and even today there is an honest, grass
roots pride in those 20 million war dead.
However, a close friend of the grieving
Russian mother said she feels no pride to
help ease her sorrow as she gazes at the
photograph of her son. Despite what the
death notice says, she has told this friend she
does not think Afghanistan is worth dying
for.
112 lic reaction is that of only one woman. It
may or may not be an indication of things to
come as the Soviet involvement in Afghanis
tan continues. And even if others here think
the same way, the political and cultural
realities of Soviet life guarantee that there
will be no mass domestic outcry against the
Kremlin's move into Afghanistan, certainly
nothing like the one in the United States over
the much larger action in Vietnam.
Emotional reality
But the case of the Russian mother does
show that even in this closed society, a few
people, if only through tragedy, are being
forced to deal emotionally with the reality of
Afghanistan.
Until recently, most Soviet citizens
seemed to view Afghanistan primarily as the
rather unlikely spark that touched off the

latest in a long string of political crises bet
ween the superpowers. It didn't really appear
to touch them any more than talk of the
energy crisis seemed to touch Americans
until there were lines at the gasoline stations.
Moscow did not admit publicly that there
were any Soviet troops in Afghanistan until
three days after the Kremlin-engineered
coup of Dec. 27 that overthrew Hafizullah
Amin and installed Babrak Karmal as his
successor. And the official press has still
never said how many troops are there. It
refers to what Washington now claims is
70.000 men as a "limited military contin
gent" in Afghanistan at the request of a
legitimate government under imperialist
siege.
No hints
So far, there has not been the slightest hint
in the press here that Soviets have been in
volved in any lighting, and the last official
word, quoting Afghan authorities, was that
there has not been a single Soviet casualty
there.
Now. however, the first sealed metal cof
fins from Afghanistan are arriv ing in the cap
ital city, bringing the grimmer realities of the
Soviet occupation into the homes of the Rus
sian mother and an unknown number of
others like her.
The reports are impossible to check, but
true or false, they indicate the growing
awareness and concern about Afghanistan
here.
Sensitive
The Kremlin is extraordinarily sensitive to
the subject of casualties. Its entire prop
aganda campaign is designed to deemphasize

Soviet involvement in Afghanistan while
simultaneously whipping up national support
by depicting the move as an effort to forestall
imperialist plans to install a hostile govern
ment on its southern border, one Western
diplomat suggested. *!
Even privately, Soviet officials skirt
around the casualty issue, saying only "that
Western reports are "wildly exaggerated "
One semi-official source here said last week
that "in military terms the casualties arcf no
thing to speak about" and compared t+Tpm
with accidents that occur on ordinary milit
ary maneuvers.
The closest he would give to an actual
count was to say that in the final 10 days of
January, the number of Soviets killed in Af
ghanistan was in "two digits," and that most
were killed by sniper fire in the provinces.
Not many
Among supporters of the Soviet action are
traditional Marxists who truly believe it is a
Soviet obligation to help transform Af
ghanistan's feudal society into a socialist one.
"But there are not many of those," a more
liberal Marxist commented.
Some of those who disapprove of the
Soviet action nonetheless feel that the Un
ited States has overreacted to it. After all,
they say, Afghanistan is a bordering nation to
the Soviet Union, while the United States is
thousands of miles away.
In the end, the most important reactions
may still be those of the parents like the
Russian mother with the photograph in the
mourning frame who must ask themselves:
"What did he die for?"
