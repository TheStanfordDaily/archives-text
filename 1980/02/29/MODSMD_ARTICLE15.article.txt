### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
Differences in the scope and
style of European and U.S. jour
nalism are a cause ol mutual
misunderstanding between
Americans and Europeans, An
drew Knight, editor of The
Economist ol London, said here
Tuesday evening.
American papers focus pre
dominantly on local news, and
European papers regularly carry
more national and international
stories. Knight observed. There
fore. Americans and Europeans
perceive world events differently
and cannot understand each
others' different reactions, he
said.

"American newspapers do,
I m a Ira id, appear to be paroc
hial and small in their compass,"
Knight commented in Ins presen
tation ol the I sth annual Carlos
McC'latchy lecture before a
packed audience in Terman Au
ditorium.
Knight said that American re
porting is drab and "eschews ad
venture or biting analysis.
I he weekly press is Ar. erica
is largely a reaction to the in
adequacy ol the regional
monopolistic daily press . . . and
above all. to the uniform and
local nature of the daily press,"
Knight said. Me cited the
monopolistic character ol most
U S. papers and the growth of

paper chains as the reasons lor
this uniformity.
"Growth of paper chains
doesn't necessarily imply un
iformity, just as power doesn't
necessarily imply corruption,"
Knight remarked sarcastically.
Ideally, the media are not
"purveyors to the general public
except in specialized ways,"
Knight said. However, there is a
general tendency for American
papers to attempt to appeal to a
wide cross-section, he said.
I his can he explained. Knight
said, hy the fact that American
papers tend to rely heavily on
local advertising, while British
and European papers depend on
national and international busi

ness advertising.
"Ihis is crucial. American
papers are vast in hulk, relying
on vast reams of advertising. We
rely on very expensive, but not
very voluminous advertising.
This has. in my view, an impact
on the way news is carried."
Knight asserted.
Rambles
The result is that American
journalism tends to ramble,
whereas European journalism is
more compressed. Knight said.
While the large size of Ameri
can newspapers may provide
license for undisciplined jour
nalism. the brevity of the Euro
pean press, which tends to be
analytical in context, can also

lead to misunderstanding.
Knight observed.
However, lie cited British
newspapers' "drip-drip" method
of getting knowledge to its read
ers through repetition as an ad
vantage over American news
papers' "blockbuster or no
thing" approach.
New angles
"A good journalist learns to
attack the same picture a number
ol times from different angles,
but it's always the same story,"
Knight said, explaining British
newspapers' "drip-drip" ap
proach.
As an example. Knight
explained that British citizens
were not as surprised as Ameri

cans hy recent events in Iran and
Alghanista n.
"We were almost weary of the
Iranian problem when the
American press began covering
the issue after the embassy
takeover," Knight said. "We
sloughed it off as not very impor
tant."
lie added that the U.S. press
never mentioned Afghanistan
before the Russian incursion, but
has now made it a blockbuster.
"Now Afghanistan has impacted
itself on American thought
daily."
As a result of these different
stales ol coverage. Americans
and Europeans tend to misun
derstand each others' reactions
to international crises. Knight
said.
Editors' jobs
Knight also observed impor
tant differences in the roles o!
editors in British and American
journalism. While British editors
are in charge of the lull paper.
American editors tend to have
more isolated roles. In addition,
editorial writers here rarely
communicate with news repor

tors on the same events, he said.
"The reasons lor this (policy)
are excellent and have been
strongly reinforced by Water
gate. hut. in my view, it is purity
gone mad." Knight said, refer
ring to American newspapers'
separation of the two functions.
He added that the strict rules ol
American journalism have
turned the reporters into au
tomatons.
"I S. chains now pursue the vir
tues ol orthodoxy. regularity and
professionalism. Am I alone in
thinking we need a little unor
thodoxy. irregularity and an
'amateur quality in the I Tench
sense ol the word?" Knight
asked.
Knight became editor ol The
Economist in 1974 at the age ol
35, after working on the publica
tion for eight years. A renowned
expert on world affairs. Knight is
the lirst non-American jour
nalist to he invited to deliver the
annual McClatchy lecture. I lie
memorial lecture was estab
lished in 1964 by the family ol
the lounderand lust editorol the
I rcsno lire.

on vast reams of advertising. We
rely on very expensive, but not
very voluminous advertising.
This has. in my view, an impact
on the way news is carried."
Knight asserted.
Rambles
The result is that American
journalism tends to ramble,
whereas European journalism is
more compressed. Knight said.
While the large size of Ameri
can newspapers may provide
license for undisciplined jour
nalism. the brevity of the Euro
pean press, which tends to be
analytical in context, can also

lead to misunderstanding.
Knight observed.
However, lie cited British
newspapers' "drip-drip" method
of getting knowledge to its read
ers through repetition as an ad
vantage over American news
papers' "blockbuster or no
thing" approach.
New angles
"A good journalist learns to
attack the same picture a number
ol times from different angles,
but it's always the same story,"
Knight said, explaining British
newspapers' "drip-drip" ap
proach.
As an example. Knight
explained that British citizens
were not as surprised as Ameri

cans hy recent events in Iran and
Alghanista n.
"We were almost weary of the
Iranian problem when the
American press began covering
the issue after the embassy
takeover," Knight said. "We
sloughed it off as not very impor
tant."
lie added that the U.S. press
never mentioned Afghanistan
before the Russian incursion, but
has now made it a blockbuster.
"Now Afghanistan has impacted
itself on American thought
daily."
As a result of these different
stales ol coverage. Americans
and Europeans tend to misun
derstand each others' reactions
to international crises. Knight
said.
Editors' jobs
Knight also observed impor
tant differences in the roles o!
editors in British and American
journalism. While British editors
are in charge of the lull paper.
American editors tend to have
more isolated roles. In addition,
editorial writers here rarely
communicate with news repor

tors on the same events, he said.
"The reasons lor this (policy)
are excellent and have been
strongly reinforced by Water
gate. hut. in my view, it is purity
gone mad." Knight said, refer
ring to American newspapers'
separation of the two functions.
He added that the strict rules ol
American journalism have
turned the reporters into au
tomatons.
"I S. chains now pursue the vir
tues ol orthodoxy. regularity and
professionalism. Am I alone in
thinking we need a little unor
thodoxy. irregularity and an
'amateur quality in the I Tench
sense ol the word?" Knight
asked.
Knight became editor ol The
Economist in 1974 at the age ol
35, after working on the publica
tion for eight years. A renowned
expert on world affairs. Knight is
the lirst non-American jour
nalist to he invited to deliver the
annual McClatchy lecture. I lie

Differences in the scope and
style of European and U.S. jour
nalism are a cause ol mutual
misunderstanding between
Americans and Europeans, An
drew Knight, editor of The
Economist ol London, said here
Tuesday evening.
American papers focus pre
dominantly on local news, and
European papers regularly carry
more national and international
stories. Knight observed. There
fore. Americans and Europeans
perceive world events differently
and cannot understand each
others' different reactions, he
said.

"American newspapers do,
I m a Ira id, appear to be paroc
hial and small in their compass,"
Knight commented in Ins presen
tation ol the I sth annual Carlos
McC'latchy lecture before a
packed audience in Terman Au
ditorium.
Knight said that American re
porting is drab and "eschews ad
venture or biting analysis.
I he weekly press is Ar. erica
is largely a reaction to the in
adequacy ol the regional
monopolistic daily press . . . and
above all. to the uniform and
local nature of the daily press,"
Knight said. Me cited the
monopolistic character ol most
U S. papers and the growth of

paper chains as the reasons lor
this uniformity.
"Growth of paper chains
doesn't necessarily imply un
iformity, just as power doesn't
necessarily imply corruption,"
Knight remarked sarcastically.
Ideally, the media are not
"purveyors to the general public
except in specialized ways,"
Knight said. However, there is a
general tendency for American
papers to attempt to appeal to a
wide cross-section, he said.
I his can he explained. Knight
said, hy the fact that American
papers tend to rely heavily on
local advertising, while British
and European papers depend on
national and international busi

ness advertising.
