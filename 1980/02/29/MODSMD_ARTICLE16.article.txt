Statistics I promised you, and statistics I have,
first, to answer those questions you've been pon
dering all week: (Remember? At the end of my last
column? Oh, never mind, here are the answers
anyway.)
Approximately 24 percent of the under
graduates here are awarded credit for advanced
placement courses completed in high school. And
almost 4<S percent of University undergraduates
have one or more units ol transfer credit on their
transcripts when they graduate. Less than 20 per
cent ol these students are actually "transfer stu
dents."
This information comes to me from Bill
Washburn, a graduate student in the School of
Education and the research coordinator for under
graduate studies. Washburn gets these numbers
from analyses of transcripts of graduated classes.
I his information comes to me because of a ques
tion submitted about a month ago.
Dear Hug Me,
How many and what percentage of students here:
/) stop out
2 1 go overseas
3) participate in Hopkins
4) graduate early /late
5) have cars
6) participate in internships
Thank you.
Statistics huff

You see? I don't just make these things up. Why,
then, I'm sure you're asking now, did I just give you
two statistics which Buff didn't even ask for? Be
cause I thought you might want to know.
Actually, Washburn gave me that info while I
was finding out from him how many students go
overseas. In the class of I 978,574 of 1638 students
went to campuses overseas. That's about 34 per
cent. "The year before," Washburn said, "it was 35
percent. So it looks like around one third."
Automobiles can't be counted on transcripts, so
I called Police Services to find out how many cars
are registered to students here. Altogether, there
are just under 5000 permits issued to student vehi
cles at present. Almost half (2430) are for principle
cars for on-campus students; another 150 are for
second vehicles for these students. Off-campus
students have registered 2031 principle vehicles
and 106 additional ones.
The statistics for the I fopkins Marine Station are
quicker. Val Mallin, administrative officer for
Biological Sciences, gave me these numbers: dur
ing autumn quarter, about a dozen students par
ticipate. Winter quarter is "vacation." In the
spring, Irom 20 to 25 is the general number ol
students.
Summer quarter is special at Hopkins. There are
two five-week programs, both of which are open to
visitors as well as University students. Overall
about 160 people participate, half of whom might
be Stanford undergrads. Andrew Rich
