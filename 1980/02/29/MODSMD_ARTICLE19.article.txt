# How to overcome the 'No-Date Dilemma'
## 
### 
I just received this letter from my sister Kay, who is a
sophomore at Trinity College, and who hasn't been on a
date lor 3 1 2 years.
/)eur '' Early-Dale,
What's going on, dude? Yon know / really don't miss
yon at all, but like everyone else in our family, I have a
problem. Bill, I haven't been on a date since you took me
to your Senior prom! What the "hudda-' It seems like
everyone just wants to be friends. Besides washing my
hair and brushing mv teeth, is there anything else I can
do?
Your sister, Kav "No-Date" Kemmeries
Dear "No-Date."
I must console you with the tact that you are not alone.
Many girls from all across the country are suffering from
exactly the same problem — it's called the "No-Date
Dilemma." II you think the "Early-Date Syndrome" is a
problem, the "No-Date Dilemma" is even worse.

Kay. diiling is like baseball — some ol us are hitting
home runs, while others always seem to strike out. In
your case you are not even getting up to bat. I his is
terrible, although taking yoursell into account, under
standable.
This "No-Date Dilemma" also happens to guvs. In

fact. I know a lot ot'guys who arc moping in the dugouts,
just standing around with their warm-ups on. What can
we do ahout this? Well honey, start walking to the plate!
I've come up with some styles and techniques that will
solve this social problem tor both girls and guys.
For girls:
1) Peer Pressure Technique: Although not for the shy,
this is ;t ver\ effective technique. It you want to guaran
tee a date for sure, ask him out in front of a whole bunch
of people, preferably his friends. Forexample. if you like
a guy in a fraternity, eat over there for dinner. When you
are about to be introduced, throw your glass against the
wall, jump on the table and shout. "Hey, 1 want to be
so-and-so's woman this Friday night!" You've got him.
Immediately everyone will stiirt throwing food in the ;iir.
breaking chairs, dancing and chanting. "So-and-so's got
a date. So-and-so's got a date!" I guarantee you that the
peer pressure will be tot) much, and he will go out with
you.
2) "Wanna Gel Lucky" Style: Girls. I admit that this
style is pretty wild, but I guarantee you that it will work
sometimes. What you do is call a guy and ask hi m if he'd
like to get together with you. If he hesitates at all. im
mediately whisper. "Hey baby, you wanna get lucky?"
Always stress the "wanna" in a sensuous way. Although
I've never actually heard of this style being used for a
date, I've seen it employed all the time at parties. Per
sonally. I get turned off In girls using the "Wanna get
lucky?" style. I figure that any girl who says she wants to
get "lucky" with Bill "Early-Date" Kemmeries would
probably get lucky with just about anyone. Be careful
when using this.
For guys:
1 1 I .8.1. Style: Guys, what you do is find out all you can
about the girl before you ask her out. Talk to her room
mate and see what the girl's plans are for the weekends.
Get a copy of the syllabus (breach of her classes. I know
it's a lot ot work, but study carefully and know every
movement she'll be making in the next two weeks.

Then, when you ask her out, and she says something like
"Oh shoot, oh darn, I would love to go out with you. hut I
have a midterm Monday," you can answer, "You lying
witch, you don't have a test lor 1 2 days, now how about
it?'' Now some girls will get a little upset by the name
calling (never substitute a "b" for a "w" in the above)
and by the fact that you have caught them in a lie, but a
lot of girls will be so flustered that they will nervously
accept your invitation.
2) Total Kamikaze Technique: This technique takes a
lot of confidence, but is good when you are really desp
erate and need a date quickly for a formal or something.
Guys, what you do is get all dressed up in your suit, buy
some flowers, get in your car and go over to the girl's
dorm/house. It also helps if you down a couple be
forehand. Then, out of the blue, just knock on her door
and say, "Hurry up, we are really late. Hurry up. we arc
really late." If you have a lot of guts, just stay in your car
and honk the horn until she comes out. Now I know a lot
of you are wondering right now, "Hey, what if she is not
there, "Early-Date" won't I look pretty stupid?" Well,
Mr. Gigolo, just drive your car and honk your horn at
some other girl's place! It ain't that hard. However, if
you haven't been doing too well with ladies, always gas
up before using this technique.
Well. Kay, those are the styles and techniques to stop
the "No-Date Dilemma." and I hope that they help you
this year. Personally I believe the best thing for both
sexes to guarantee a date is the "Pest-Persistence-
Program" (P.P.P.) — just bug the heck out of someone
until he or she goes out with you. For example, if the guy
or girl you like has a car. somehow get inside and don't
leave until you are assured of a date. Eat in there, sleep
in there, but never leave the car! Even if the person goes
on a short trip to the store, you stay in the back seat
constantly poking your fingerat him orherand shouting.
"Now how about a date, huh?"
You won't believe how mad some people get about
this, but in the end you'll be guaranteed a date for sure.
By the way, my car is a blue '67 Mustang with . . .
