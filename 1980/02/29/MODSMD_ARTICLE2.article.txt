### Richard Hefter Staff Writer 
About $7()(> damage was incurred last weekend on three
campus fraternity houses by visiting Sigma Alpha Epsilon
Iraternity members during a province convention hosted by
the Stanford SAE chapter, according to SAE president Lou
Armstrong.
Eight Northern California SAE chapters visited the cam
pus SAE house for the bi-annual convention.
Armstrong said that several SAE members from Fresno
State and UC-Davis were involved 111 the destruction that
included two broken windows at the Phi Delta Theta house,
damage to a motorcycle, a kitchen door at Kappa Sigma,
and a wall hanging at the SAE's.
"It sa shame," lie said. "In the past there's never been a
problem. I think everbody (at the Stanford SAE house) was
caught unaware."
Friday
On I riday night, several students from Fresno tried to get
into a closed semi-formal party at Kappa. The students had
been drinking, Armstrong said.
According to Kappa Sigma member Kevin McCaffery,
the Fresno group broke into the kitchen at the back of the
house and "a scuttle broke out with one of the Kappa Sigma
members."
1 he Fresno SAE's left but came back later "to renew the
fight," McCaffery said.
I his time, however, several Stanford SAE members
came by to try and break up the fight.
I he Stanford SAE s did a lot to settle things down,"
McC alfery said, but he added that the disruption caused the
party to break up earlier than expected.
I lie Stanford police were called to the scene, but no

report was put out, according to Capt, William
Wullschleger.
At Saturday morning's convention meeting, Armstrong
said he spoke to the chapters condemning Friday night's
actions.
He said lie also explained to them that while fraternities
at other schools own their houses and land, the fraternity
houses here are owned In the University. Thus here, 112 rater
nities cannot get away with damage they can at other
schools.
The chapter from Davis, however, was not at Saturday
morning's meeting. They arrived here in the afternoon and
instigated the rest ol the trouble, according to Armstrong.
Rock throwing
On Saturday afternoon, the students from Davis got
drunk and. without provocation "started throwing rocks at
the Phi Dolt house next door, breaking two windows."
Armstrong said.
lie said that the Davis SAE's then went over to the Phi
Delt house and pushed over two motorcycles.
At the SAE house, several items, including a pool table,
were damaged, but they are reparable. Armstrong said.
The only thing broken was a wall hanging.
Mike Kavoukjian. Phi Delt president, expressed his
anger .it the vandals, calling them "a bunch ol yahoos who
are averse to all signs ol higher civilization â€” such as glass,
buildings and complete sentences."
Kavoukjian said that he holds no animosity toward ttyc
Stanford SAE's. who"were very cooperative and offered to
pay for the damage."
According to SAE member John Peck, the SAl"s here
"learned a lesson" from last weekend.
"Stanford students are a different breed." he said.
