## We are not just machines 
### 
The purpose of this column is to familiarize
people with the epistemological outlook of Lyndon
Larouche, Jr.. Democratic candidate for president.
Evidence derived from anthropology, history
and hypnosis indicates that the way humans act is
largely determined by their sense of identity, their
self-conception. How we relate to others, and how
successfully we lead our lives depends largely on
who and what we think we are. Clearly, self
deception is likely to lead to disaster: recall the age
old dictum, "know thyself."
In this context, I raise the following question, a
question both central to the upcoming presidential
campaign and key to the future of the world in
general. Are we machines?
"Of course we; re not machines!" you reply, re
turning to your work. Let us, however, probe this
matter embarrassingly further.
What is a machine? This is the logical place to
begin our discussion. I submit that a machine is an
entity governed by a fixed set of laws: a machine
has a fixed relationship to its environment, and
simply reacts in a determinate fashion to external
stimuli. Of course, the machine may not always
react in the same way, as when some of the laws
become inoperative, i.e. when the machine breaks
down.
Notice, however, that these machines still obey a
fixed set of laws, albeit a more general one. Mal
leability is an important characteristic of these
machines, since it enables us to use them for many
purposes. This, however, does not change their
status as determinate beings; wires, too, can be
bent and twisted as needed.
A human, I posit, is something more. Although
the University may at times make us feel like prog
rammable calculators, we should keep in mind that
ideas originate with humans, not with machines.
Why not consider humans an idea-making
machine? l.et us consider the nature of an idea.
Insofar as ideas determine the way we behave —
and they do so to a far greater extent than most
people believe — they are our characteristics, our
relationship to our environment. Imagine a cave
man. His ideas, his technology, his way of trans
forming nature is his relationship to nature. But
this relationship is not a fixed one. Man's charac
teristics change as new ideas and new ways of se
eing and doing things are created and communi

cated.
Man, unlike machines, has the capacity to grow.
In all previous biological evolution, new species
arose when new characteristics were necessary;
with humans, progress is huilt right into the species
itself. Otherwise stated, humans are not bound to
merely react, but can act in love and can create
original solutions to important problems.
In short, humans can evaluate the efficacy of
their characteristics and choose to rid themselves
of some characteristics, developing higher ones in
their stead. Man's characteristics were not stamped
in for eternity by some arbitrary god, but were
self-created; man is a free or self-determining be
ing. His attributes are internal, but not immutable;
they are potentially appropriate to his environ
ment, but not determined from without.
Indeed, imagine asking a man with big muscles if
he had been born with these or had purchased
them. I suggest the same holds for the mind, except
to a much greater extent: one develops the capacity
to solve problems by actually solving problems, not
by wishing for a gene transplant, nor by acquiring
the externalities of intelligence (e.g. a Stanford
degree).
We are not machines, not sophisticated struc
tures of simple parts; our qualities are determinate,
temporary reifications of ourselves as evolving
wholes. As such, our qualities are not eternal but
are only appropriate to our particular stage of de
velopment.
At this point, I could make a case for a sort of
naturalism, saying it best to be treated according to
one's nature. But there are much stronger reasons
for not treating ourselves as machines. We should
take pride in our capacities to think and feel, for
these enable us to help ourselves and those around
us. In short, a society of compassionate, problem
solving human beings has far greater survival po
tential than one of narrowminded sheep.
Clearly, we need a president with a coherent
ethical outlook: pragmatic special-interest ap
peasement ultimately dissolves into corruption.
But we do not need a Khomeini, a man who will
lecture us on our greediness and urge us to make
sacrifices. Larouche is a man who believes in free
dom, with progress as the task of freedom.
