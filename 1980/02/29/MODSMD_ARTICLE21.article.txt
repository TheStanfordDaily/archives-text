## Draft the 'upper class' 
### 
Instead of resorting to the
usual banter of cliched, pacifist
rhetoric in my argument against
registration of IS and 19-year
olds. I hope to offer a viable al
ternative. Although admittedly
somewhat unconventional, I feel
that the measures I propose are
truly superior strategically when
all outcomes are considered.
Acknowledging the necessity
for registration should not com
mit us to the old tradition of sing
ling out only young men for in
duction into service. Since mod
ern warfare has evolved in such a
way that physical strength is no
longer essential for many posi
tions (as exemplified by the call
to register women), the base for
selection of our military need not
be restricted to any specific age
group.
Instead, I propose we proceed
to register another demographic
group, which in general share
characteristics more advantage
ous for the war which we are now
contemplating. For reasons I will
develop later I propose that this
time, instead of the young, the
"upper-class" be drafted. Speci
fically, a sizable portion of
white-collar workers, bureauc
rats, financiers, the idle wealthy
and of course, college students.
Although your initial reaction
may be one of shock, or perhaps
satiric amusement, allow me to

point out the practical superior
ity of this proposition.
First, since the initial and
hopefully only purpose of regist
ration is mobilization anil an ex
ternal show of unity and pre
paredness, what better way to
appeal to the national spirit than
to register its leaders, role mod
els and most influential citizens.
We'd be calling to arms the very
apostles of the American way of
life. What possible gesture could
do more to evoke patriotism?
Furthermore, the very unwon
tedness of the action would frus
trate the expectations of our
enemies, thus giving us a certain
strategic advantage.
There is also, of course, some
poetic justice in the plan by
which those who had the most to
lose (materially speaking) would
be those sacrificing the most.
This irony however, is apt to be
clouded by various ideological
persuasions, yet due to the blat
ant materialistic nature of the
war we are contemplating it
seems appropriate to some.
Nevertheless, I plead its case
purely on tactical advantages.
The real test of this plan's via
bility must lie in its functionabil
ity if worst comes to war and the
draft must actually be effected.
In this case we must consider all
aspects of the situation and make
some realistic projections in
order to assess the best action.
It is safe to assume that if the
United States went to war to de
fend its strategic oil from Soviet
aggression, its contest with the
world's most powerful military
force would constitute World
War 111. In other worlds, no
minor skirmish, but an all-out
showdown for possession of the
world's energy reserves.
Consider also, that during this
time of crisis the entire country
would have to be mobilized.
Many of the service-oriented
and financial enterprises
(primarily white collar) would
have to be suspended while, con
versely, the means of direct pro

duction (chiefly blue collar)
would be going full throttle.
It is evident than, that most of
the truly expendable (atjeast
temporarily) manpower would
be in the upper echelons of busi
ness. finance, etc. This temporar
ily displaced class would make
itself most useful on the
frontlines, while their "pro
letariat" counterparts kept them
in supplies.
The millions of American col
lege students, tor instance, are a
prime resource of dispensable
manpower and fit the bill of
youth and physical aptitude to
boot. We're the obvious choice
for frontlinemen.
Thus far I have presented the
strategical benefits of drafting
the upper class in case of regist
ration and/or actual war, yet the
real beauty of this plan is that
even in the worst possible case, it
would allow for the least trauma
tic defeat. You see there exists
the distinct possibility that
should Russia "call our bluff"
and we are plunged into war, we
may suffer a humiliating and de
cisive loss.
In this case, my plan is clearly
superior in its methodical elimi
nation (by morally defensible
process — that is war) of the
"upper class." This would allow
for a much smoother transition
of power, as the largely pro
letariat population left in the Un
ited States would supposedly
lend itself much better to to
talitarian indoctrination than the
disposed "intellectual" class.
By putting our elite bourgeois
class on the front lines, there
would never be the need to sub
ject them to such atrocities as
genocide, dispossession, purges,
etc.
Induction of the "upper class"
may not be the perfect solution
but 1 challenge anyone to come
up with a better one.

seems appropriate to some.
Nevertheless, I plead its case
purely on tactical advantages.
The real test of this plan's via
bility must lie in its functionabil
ity if worst comes to war and the
draft must actually be effected.
In this case we must consider all
aspects of the situation and make
some realistic projections in
order to assess the best action.
It is safe to assume that if the
United States went to war to de
fend its strategic oil from Soviet
aggression, its contest with the
world's most powerful military
force would constitute World
War 111. In other worlds, no
minor skirmish, but an all-out
showdown for possession of the
world's energy reserves.
Consider also, that during this
time of crisis the entire country
would have to be mobilized.
Many of the service-oriented
and financial enterprises
(primarily white collar) would
have to be suspended while, con
versely, the means of direct pro

duction (chiefly blue collar)
would be going full throttle.
It is evident than, that most of
the truly expendable (atjeast
temporarily) manpower would
be in the upper echelons of busi
ness. finance, etc. This temporar
ily displaced class would make
itself most useful on the
frontlines, while their "pro
letariat" counterparts kept them
in supplies.
The millions of American col
lege students, tor instance, are a
prime resource of dispensable
manpower and fit the bill of
youth and physical aptitude to
boot. We're the obvious choice
for frontlinemen.
Thus far I have presented the
strategical benefits of drafting
the upper class in case of regist
ration and/or actual war, yet the
real beauty of this plan is that
even in the worst possible case, it
would allow for the least trauma
tic defeat. You see there exists
the distinct possibility that
should Russia "call our bluff"
and we are plunged into war, we
may suffer a humiliating and de
cisive loss.
In this case, my plan is clearly
superior in its methodical elimi
nation (by morally defensible
process — that is war) of the
"upper class." This would allow
for a much smoother transition
of power, as the largely pro
letariat population left in the Un
ited States would supposedly
lend itself much better to to
talitarian indoctrination than the
disposed "intellectual" class.
By putting our elite bourgeois
class on the front lines, there
would never be the need to sub
ject them to such atrocities as
genocide, dispossession, purges,
etc.
Induction of the "upper class"
may not be the perfect solution
but 1 challenge anyone to come
up with a better one.

Instead of resorting to the
usual banter of cliched, pacifist
rhetoric in my argument against
registration of IS and 19-year
olds. I hope to offer a viable al
ternative. Although admittedly
somewhat unconventional, I feel
that the measures I propose are
truly superior strategically when
all outcomes are considered.
Acknowledging the necessity
for registration should not com
mit us to the old tradition of sing
ling out only young men for in
duction into service. Since mod
ern warfare has evolved in such a
way that physical strength is no
longer essential for many posi
tions (as exemplified by the call
to register women), the base for
selection of our military need not
be restricted to any specific age
group.
Instead, I propose we proceed
to register another demographic
group, which in general share
characteristics more advantage
ous for the war which we are now
contemplating. For reasons I will
develop later I propose that this
time, instead of the young, the
"upper-class" be drafted. Speci
fically, a sizable portion of
white-collar workers, bureauc
rats, financiers, the idle wealthy
and of course, college students.
Although your initial reaction
may be one of shock, or perhaps
satiric amusement, allow me to

point out the practical superior
ity of this proposition.
First, since the initial and
hopefully only purpose of regist
ration is mobilization anil an ex
ternal show of unity and pre
paredness, what better way to
appeal to the national spirit than
to register its leaders, role mod
els and most influential citizens.
We'd be calling to arms the very
apostles of the American way of
life. What possible gesture could
do more to evoke patriotism?
Furthermore, the very unwon
tedness of the action would frus
trate the expectations of our
enemies, thus giving us a certain
strategic advantage.
There is also, of course, some
poetic justice in the plan by
which those who had the most to
lose (materially speaking) would
be those sacrificing the most.
This irony however, is apt to be
clouded by various ideological
persuasions, yet due to the blat
ant materialistic nature of the
war we are contemplating it
seems appropriate to some.
