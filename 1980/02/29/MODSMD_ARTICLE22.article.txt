## Feminism no game 
### 
"No person can abdicate re
sponsibility Jar the perpetuation
of sexism in our society. How
ever, some people have a greater
responsibility than others."
Upon publication of his edito
rial "Help Male Feminists Play
the Game." (Daily, Feb. 25) Mal
colm Bertoni has placed himself
in the designated group of
people with a greater responsi
bility. He uses the Daily editorial
page as a soapbox upon which to
elicit sympathy for personal feel
ings of anxiety, frustration and
guilt encountered in his effort to
put a feminist ethic into practice.
The dangerous fallacy in his
argument lies in the representa
tion of the evolution of a social
value system as a game with an
a-priori set of rules. From this
mistaken assumption, he con
cludes that even though "the
game is noble," he can be justifi
ably indignant if the other
players — from President Jimmy
Carter to his date — do not fol
low the rules.
I'd like to reply to Bertoni by
pointing out that inherent in any
conscious altering of one's value
system is the acknowledgement
of the fallacy of former values,
the acknowledgement of mis
conception, injustice — the ad
mittance of error.
Not only is it extremely dif
ficult for human beings to admit
that they have been wrong, but
that acknowledgement is even
more painful when it implies the

deprivation of former pleasures.
You better believe that I. too,
feel anxiety, frustration and guilt
when arguing with my date over
splitting the restaurant bill.
Nevertheless, since each per
son is individually responsible
for formulating and following
the ethic with which he/she deals
with others — for making his
own rules — I do not then decry
the lack of effective leadership
which allows my date to play by
different rules. Social change is
effected by individuals taking re
sponsibility for changing their
own actions, regardless of the ir
responsibility of others.
Since the change of values and
admittance of error are so dif
ficult. it will take a long time and
a lot of individual incentive to rid
the entire society of an ethic as
deeply and historically rooted as
sexism.
The point is that it is not a
game with ready-made rules.
And statements like "One
should never underestimate the
power of women's deepest con
victions. nor the cunning with
which she will protect and nur
ture those convictions" reveal
the reluctance of many members
of society to face up to the chal
lenge of dispelling old myths,
creating new rules and placing
themselves in the category of
people with a greater responsi
bility for eradicating sexism.
