Prop. 9 'crippling'
I find the comments by Alvin
Rubushka, senior fellow at
Hoover Institution, (Daily, Feb.
21) to be both irresponsible and
insensitive.
Rabushka stated that the Uni
versity might be indirectly bene
fited by the passage of the "Jar
vis 11" Initiative. His
reasoning was that the increases
in tuition at state schools would
make Stanford seem more at
tractive to prospective students.
To this I respond:
1) Stanford hardly needs to
seem more attractive to students,
as it is already the most selective
school in California.
2) I challenge Rabushka to
show any example of significant
numbers of students turning
Stanford down to attend public
institutions because of price.
3) I challenge Rabushka to
prove that the institution of tui
tions at public universities in
California, that could at
maximum be less than half of

Stanford's, will make Stanford
significantly more appealing
than it already is.
Rabushka ignores the detri
mental impact the initiative will
have on state scholarship win
ners. The great hulk of the tax
savings will he returned to those
who can already afford Stanford,
while the parents of students
who lose financial aid will re
ceive very little, probably less
than the financial aid dollars they
will lose.
The net impact for the state as
a whole will be to diminish edu
cation opportunities for the
poor, and following Rabushka's
logic, enhance these oppor
tunities for the rich.
Proposition 9 will have a crip
pling cffcct on public education
in California, and those who be
lieve the University can profit
from the misery of others are
quite deluded.
