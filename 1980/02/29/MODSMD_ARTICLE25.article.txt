## 'A la carte' tuition more palatable 
### 
About $9000 a year. There is no question
that that's a lot of bubble gum (approxi
mately 450.000 pieees). But, we shouldn't be
playing around with figures. The question is
not what we pay to go to Stanford, but
whether Stanford is worth it.
Why do we come to Stanford after all? Do
we pay such large sums of money to have our
perceptions changed and broadened or our
minds expanded? Be honest.
As good consuming Americans we were
not brought up to pay good money (the equi
valent of two reasonably priced cars or 45
good ten-speed bikes a year) to have our
minds expanded. We don't pay cash to have
our world views transformed. We pay cash
for things. What//////j,».v do we gel out of Stan
ford?
Well, we get three things. I hex are. in
descending order of importance. The Stan
ford Diploma. The Stanford Education, and
The Stanford Experience. That's not what
the tuition bill on your I'TR says, but that
doesn't mean it isn't true.
The Stanford Diploma is. l ar and away, the
most important of these items because we
believe that it will get us a good job. It is a
capital investment of sorts. With it. we hope,
we can earn sums of money which will make
$9000 a year look like chicken feed.
We go to football games and see the
alumni dri\ ing around in their Mercedes and
BMWs. We see them donate enough money
to build dormitories and science complexes
and we believe. T he Stanford Diploma seems
to be worth having.
Then there's the Stanford Education. Cer

tainly, the Stanford Diploma would be worth
having even without the Stanford Education.
I nfortunately. the two. generally though not
always, come as a package deal. You have to
take the bad with the good.
The Stanford Education does have some
advantages. (Though they may not compare
with what the diploma seems to offer.) If the
jobs we get with our Stanford Diploma in
volve work then we may be faced with prob
lems for which the education may provide
solutions or at least dodges.
It youcan't solve a problem you can always
blame it on somebody else. After all. he
probably isn't as well-educated as you are.
The Stanford Education isn't such a bad
thing to have.
l inally there is T he Stanford Experience.
A side dish when compared to The Diploma
or The Education. Some Stanford students
avoid The Stanford Experience altogether.
By dividing their time between the library
and their rooms they manage to avoid those
activities that the rest of us consider fun
(basic to The Stanford Experience.)
These students do not get reduced tuition
rates. This means one of two things. Either
The Stanford Experience is free (very un
likely ) or they are paying for something they
don't get. The ethics of this group, however,
prevent them from getting involved enough
in student politics to demand a rebate on The
Stanford Ex per ie n ce.
For most of us The Stanford Experience is
real enough. But is it worth what we pay?
One good point about the experience is that
in the years to come, we can discuss it with

other alumni who may he in positions to get
us jobs, raises or promotions or into the
country cluh or the marina. In other words
The Stanford Experience may help us make
the most of The Stanford Diploma.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
The Stanford Experience is too diverse to be
invoked without discretion. For instance, it is
not always a good idea to identify yourself as
the guy who used to sell the Workers Van
guard in White Plaza.
It is the conviction that some species ol
The Stanford Experience are better than
others that keeps a number ol fraternities
and sororities alive. If. at some future time, a
person in a position to give you some social
or economic goodies was a so-and-so and
you were a so-and-so. then you can, at least,
exchange secret handshakes and recount
running naked through some dorm or other
late at night.
Nine thousand dollars for T he Stanford
Diploma. The Stanford Education and The
Stanford Experience: is it worth it? Obvi
ously. it depends on who you are. Personal
moral idiosyncracies may well limit your abil
ity to use these items to theit 1 best advantage
when you get out into the real world.
It would make things a great deal easier il
we could buy just the items we wanted. Why
should someone have to take classes if all
they are interested in is The Stanford Dip
loma and alumni status. If they introduced a
la carte tuition rates the system would be
much more palatable.

It is the conviction that some species ol
The Stanford Experience are better than
others that keeps a number ol fraternities

person in a position to give you some social

you were a so-and-so. then you can, at least,
exchange secret handshakes and recount
running naked through some dorm or other

Nine thousand dollars for T he Stanford
Diploma. The Stanford Education and The

when you get out into the real world.
It would make things a great deal easier il
we could buy just the items we wanted. Why
should someone have to take classes if all
they are interested in is The Stanford Dip

much more palatable.

About $9000 a year. There is no question
that that's a lot of bubble gum (approxi
mately 450.000 pieees). But, we shouldn't be
playing around with figures. The question is
not what we pay to go to Stanford, but
whether Stanford is worth it.
Why do we come to Stanford after all? Do
we pay such large sums of money to have our
perceptions changed and broadened or our
minds expanded? Be honest.
As good consuming Americans we were
not brought up to pay good money (the equi
valent of two reasonably priced cars or 45
good ten-speed bikes a year) to have our
minds expanded. We don't pay cash to have
our world views transformed. We pay cash
for things. What//////j,».v do we gel out of Stan
ford?
Well, we get three things. I hex are. in
descending order of importance. The Stan
ford Diploma. The Stanford Education, and
The Stanford Experience. That's not what
the tuition bill on your I'TR says, but that
doesn't mean it isn't true.
The Stanford Diploma is. l ar and away, the
most important of these items because we
believe that it will get us a good job. It is a
capital investment of sorts. With it. we hope,
we can earn sums of money which will make
$9000 a year look like chicken feed.
We go to football games and see the
alumni dri\ ing around in their Mercedes and
BMWs. We see them donate enough money
to build dormitories and science complexes
and we believe. T he Stanford Diploma seems
to be worth having.
Then there's the Stanford Education. Cer

tainly, the Stanford Diploma would be worth
having even without the Stanford Education.
I nfortunately. the two. generally though not
always, come as a package deal. You have to
take the bad with the good.
The Stanford Education does have some
advantages. (Though they may not compare
with what the diploma seems to offer.) If the
jobs we get with our Stanford Diploma in
volve work then we may be faced with prob
lems for which the education may provide
solutions or at least dodges.
It youcan't solve a problem you can always
blame it on somebody else. After all. he
probably isn't as well-educated as you are.
The Stanford Education isn't such a bad
thing to have.
l inally there is T he Stanford Experience.
A side dish when compared to The Diploma
or The Education. Some Stanford students
avoid The Stanford Experience altogether.
By dividing their time between the library
and their rooms they manage to avoid those
activities that the rest of us consider fun
(basic to The Stanford Experience.)
These students do not get reduced tuition
rates. This means one of two things. Either
The Stanford Experience is free (very un
likely ) or they are paying for something they
don't get. The ethics of this group, however,
prevent them from getting involved enough
in student politics to demand a rebate on The
Stanford Ex per ie n ce.
For most of us The Stanford Experience is
real enough. But is it worth what we pay?
One good point about the experience is that
in the years to come, we can discuss it with

other alumni who may he in positions to get
us jobs, raises or promotions or into the
country cluh or the marina. In other words
The Stanford Experience may help us make
the most of The Stanford Diploma.
Unfortunately, this is not always the case.
The Stanford Experience is too diverse to be
invoked without discretion. For instance, it is
not always a good idea to identify yourself as
the guy who used to sell the Workers Van
guard in White Plaza.
