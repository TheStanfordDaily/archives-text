## Photography: more for less elsewhere 
### 
As a faculty member and an
outsider (I have just a one-year
appointment here), I think I may
be able to offer some thoughts
from a different perspective than
that of your other writers.
For the past few years, I have
been teaching photography at
Cabrillo College near Santa
Cruz, San Jose State. Monterey
Peninsula College and UCSC
Extension; this year. I am at
Stanford. The courses offered
here have the same titles as those
at the other schools, but there
are differences. Photography
classes here meet four hours per
week for 12 weeks (4N hours),
while at the junior colleges they
meet six hours per week for lb
weeks (96 hours). Also, tuition
at Cabrillo College is nine dollars
per semester; it is higher here.
From that perspective, the
junior college offers twice the in
structional time by the same in
structor at about 9/2000 th the
cost. Also, all of the other col
leges mentioned offer a vastly
greater range of photography
courses than Stanford, which
concentrates almost entirely
upon first and second semester
black-and-white courses.
Stanford's lab facilities for
photography are usable but spar
tan; those at nearby Foothill and
De An/a Colleges are incompar
ably larger and better equipped.
To the hundreds of Stanford stu
dents who find themselves each
year on waiting lists for even
basic photo courses, the decision
of the Art Department not to ex
pand its offerings in that medium
could be considered a suppres
sion of the students' interests and
potential.
Likewise, the lack of any offer
ings in color photography here
effectively cuts the student oil
from a leading edge of contem
porary art.
At the other schools men
tioned above (excepting San
Jose State), students do not usu
ally have a declared major and
tend to view all classes as poten

tially important, and after the
first couple of weeks of the
semester throw themselves heart
and soul into the courses they
find rewarding. At Stanford, al
most all of my students are al
ready majors in some field other
than art, and view photography
as simply a three-unit elective for
which they pre-allot a certain
amount of time.
In this way. by arbitrarily con
straining their commitment to a
field (art) which by its nature
demands their passion, the stu
dents short-change themselves.
Likewise, school-wide policy
that disallows taking more than a
very limited number of non
major courses for credit makes it
all but impossible (practically
speaking) for the student to pur
sue additional courses in the
medium even it he is greatly ex
cited by his initial results in it.
Intellectually, Stanford stu
dents could run circles around
any other groups I've worked
with. Artistically, however, ihey
are (with a few wonderful excep
tions) only average; this is
perhaps the result of an earlier
suppression of non-linear (right
hemisphere) thinking while in
pursuit of the type of knowledge
that shows to advantagc on SAT
tests.
The main difference between
students at Stanford and those
elsewhere, however, is in the
heterogeneity of the latter
group. At the junior colleges,
especially, a typical class will in
clude grandmothers and unwed
mothers, Vietnam veterans and
surfer space cadets and "re
entering" housewives. While the
resulting mix of ideas and value
systems is occasionally tumultu
ous. it is always invigorating and
intimately related to the stu
dent's growth as a person.
At Stanford, by comparison. I
can count on the fingers of one
hand those among my 60-odd
students who are anything other
than IS or 21-year-old whites

Irom middle or upper-class
families. And while it is certainly
no stigma for any particular per
son to fall within that category
(after all, I do also), the creation
of a sheltered campus that effec
tively excludes all hut a token
handful of exceptions serves to
eliminate an important source of
cultural growth for the student.
As a small but specific exam
ple, this cultural tunnel vision is
reflected in photography classes
in the types of subject matter
which students uniformly avoid
— e.g. death, nudity (especially
as self-portrait), people of dis
similar race, and intense emo
tions. reminders of people like
farm workers or factory workers
"who form the base of the

pyramid.'" and in general any to
pics which make people of gen
teel upbringing feel squeamish
or guilty.
While one might well draw
negative conclusions from the
above particulars, it is important
to bear in mind that they are just
that — particulars — and as such
constitute only a tiny facet of the
complete Stanford Lxperience.
There are a plurality of worlds
out there, and each of us is free to
construct our own cosmology —
or to coast into the one already
prepared for us by our parents.
As Pogo said. "We are faced
with insurmountable oppor
tu ni ties."
