## Won't transfer back 
### 
Nine thousand dollars a year is
a fearful sum to pay for anything,
including an education. Without
intention of offending anyone,
however, I suspect that those
who arc complaining arc the
same ones who fail to take full
advantage of the human re
sources found in a high quality
school, and would complain
under any circumstances.
Although the California
weather may be one of Stan
ford's drawing points, it really
takes money to attract faculty of
the excellence Stanford is known
for, and undergraduate students
should share in this cost. If it
came to light that under
graduates were bearing a dispro
portionate share of this cost,
then I. too, would seek change.
Hut until then I will not hold
Stanford responsible for infla
tion.
If prospective students are de
nied access to Stanford because
ol the cost, then perhaps we
should question the system that
Stanford is a part of and not just

the school itself. However, most
of us have found a way to pay
through work, loans and grants,
and consider it worth the effort.
I lost 49 units when I transfer
red here. I work part time, and
I'm borrowing money to pay a
tuition eight times greater than
I'm used to. It's worth it. I'm not
transferring back, and I'm happy
to be here.
