Stanford costs are rising again, increasing 12.2
percent to at least $9000 next year. Students caus
tically joke about and bemoan the high cost of a
Stanford education. Yet. in greater numbers than
ever, would-be Stanfordites are pounding the
doors of 1 red Hargadon's office with over 12.000
high school seniors for the 2400 undergraduate
admission slots.
Why? What is the mystic allure which drives so
many to work so hard and spend so much for the
privilege of attending our illustrious institution?
Does this demand reflect the quality of a Stanford
education, the level of academic excellence visa vis
other institutions or does it perhaps reflect a desire
for acceptance to a highly select club.' an elite
group of highly capable people who traditionally
go on to succeed in the upper echelons of our
society? Answering these questions requires a brief
examination of the role of education in America.
Education is still believed by most Americans to
be the means of upward mobility in our society. A
better education traditionally has meant a better
job. The liberal notion that improved quality and
access to schooling raises living standards has
guided American educational policy since the
I U3()s. Indeed, roughly one-third to one-half the
increased living standard since 1930 can be linked
to the tremendous increase in educational attain
ments during the period. Education traditionally
has been a good investment.
Then arrived the 19705. College graduate
placements declined, real salaries fell, and for the
tiist time in American history a large number of
college graduates did not find jobs in their field.
You know the rest: increased grade anxiety,
early-morning \ igils at the placement office, and an
increasing emphasis on pursuing a marketable
major. These days careful selection of a career is a
must for the simple reason that many fields are
swamped with college graduates.
The single biggest factor in the decline of returns
to schooling is. of course, the post-war baby boom.
Remember those crowded grade-schools you at
tended where, in response to a question, 30 flaying
arms instantly appeared, each striving to gain the
teacher's attention. Well those arms are Mill
around only now they are striving for the attention
ot employers.
That translates into lower salaries and greater
job competition between college grads resulting in
lower returns tit investments in college education.
These economic facts are born out by recent trends
in college enrollment with the percentage of male
IS and 19-year-olds having declined 10 percent
since 1969 to 33.4 percent and female enrollment
leveling oil at about 33 percent.
With returns to education declining and enroll
ment decreasing, other factors must be behind the
continued strong demand for a Stanford education.
A plausible theory and one much in evidence in
the enrollment literature, is that the 112 arm prov ides

a substantially better quality education than do
most institutions.
Although figures are not available on the aver
age salaries received by Stanford grads, a study of
engineering salaries was done on graduates of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The
1974 study revealed that Ml I engineers received
only five to 10 percent more than the average for
all graduating engineers. It's safe to surmise that
our graduates do not fare much better.
It thisexpensive education doesn't seem to get us
higher salaries, wouldn't our money be better spent
attending Berkeley and investing the over 50 per
cent savings in high-yield U.S. Treasury certifi
cates?
Admittedly, the Stanford experience is unique
and on the whole very enjoyable, but I can think of
a lot ot experiences that could be enjoyed with
5000 bucks, for instance, ski vacations in Colorado,
spring breaks in I lawaii. maybe even a stint travel
ing around Europe. So Stanford must be worth
something extra it only to assure myself that I
haven't missed three years ol luxury.
It is. The Mi l study revealed one other interest
ing bit of information: by mid-career a significantly
greater percentage of MIT graduates had advanced
to management positions than had other engineer
ing graduates of the same year. True to our general
perception and desperate hopes, that title
"Graduate Stanford University" distinguishes us
from the mass of college graduates, leading even
tually to higher positions and greater life-time
earnings. j
Assuming that higher incomes and greater job
responsibilities lead to greater self-fulfillment, our
expensive education may indeed be worth its stel
lar cost.
But what did Stanford do to contribute to that
distinction beyond bestowing its weighty name?
Nothing. II distinction doesn't manifest itsell in
increased earnings until 1 5 to 20 years after gradu
ation. then the skills received in school must have
little to do with future success.
More likely, innate skills are the crucial factor in
career success and Stanford, through its extremely
selective admisssions process, screens out the most
talented members from an already verv talented
applicant pool. The true economic value of a Stan
ford education lies in that initial letter of accep
tance to this exclusive gathering of abilities and
talents and then sticking around until graduation.
So the question still remains, is a Stanford educa
tion worth the price? Yes, il you are interested in
enhancing your prospects for future career success
and satisfaction. No. il you are interested purely in
the pursuit of intellectual growth.
Since most of us are oriented toward a combina
tion ol these two possibilities, each student must
individually evaluate the value of this educational
institution remembering that in the final analysis
Stanford is just a very elite "club."
