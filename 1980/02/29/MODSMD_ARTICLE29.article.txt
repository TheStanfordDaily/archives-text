## Wise weigh Marxian values 
### 
Karl Miirx would smile at the
$«•)()()() price t;iii attached to ;i
Stanford education. It conforms
in a way to his analysis of
capitalism, which means that we.
who faithfully study Marxian
economics and proletarian re
volutions, may be certified
capitalists at heart.
Iromobserv ing myself and my
campus colleagues, our am
bitions. our majors, our use of
leisure time, il we schedule any
at all. I have come to see that we
take our education very seri
ously. expecting it to be the de
termining factor in deciding what
careers we eventually enter.
In a pamphlet published by
Hoover Press. Alexander Sol
/henitsyn reflects on the time he
spent researching at Stanford.
He especially remembers peer
ing down from Hoover Tower
and watching "student bicycles
whir, rapid and businesslike."
This should not be too surpris
ing. since many of us will go into
business and accordingly be
come businesslike, il we are not
aire ad v.

Most of us. I wager, ha\ e gone
into business, though we could
argue about that. You might
agree with me if you are familiar
with Marx's distinction between
use value and exchange value.
II you purchase a ticket to a
Willy Nelson concert, tor exam
ple. and then go to it. whoop it up
and even choke on chewing to
bacco as any sincere fan would,
then you have obtained a use
value from the ticket.
Now if you purchase a ticket
while secretly despising Willy
Nelson, but buy it anyway to
scalp it at the gate, you obtain an
exchange value. By walking from
the box office to the gate and
selling the ticket on the night of
the performance, you increase
the exchange value and cash in
on a profit.
All of us will "profit" from at
tending Stanford. It will be a use
value for some, mostly intellec
tual diehards, who insist on
studying the humanities and re
solutely look the other way when
they walk by the Career Planning
and Placement Center. For

others, the majority I think, the
worth of their 12-quarter.
$40.000 investment will come
when they exchange a degree,
say engineering or economics,
lor a job with a starting salary at
least half as high as the amount
ol money they, subsidized by
their parents, have spent at Stan
lord.
II everything we attempt in
these years is calculated to con
tribute solely to that momentous
exchange, we are already in bus
iness. We are dealing in com
modities. not humanities or sci
ences.
I say this perhaps in self
justification, but I have placed
my bets on the humanities in
choosing my courses at Stanford,
enjoying their use value now and
judging that over the long run an
investment 111 them will pay off.
But both kinds of values, use
and exchange, will be weighed by
the wise among us, for no better
reason I suppose, than to enable
them to get their money's worth.
