Housing rezoned
All those who remember what
a battle it was to get off-campus
housing last quarter will be un
happy to learn that the situation
may well be worse next year.
I returned to my rented house
in Mcnlo Park the other day to
find a note on my door with "re
zoning?" and "demolition?"
sprawled all over it in huge print.
It seems that my home is one
of zi)3 in Menlo Park which are
the subject of a proposition by
Councilmember Jim Bloch for
rezoning. Apparently the areas
concerned would be rezoned for
"multiple unit residences,'
which. I'm sure, is a euphemism
for condominiums.
The landlords who own the
property would probably wel
come this change since it would

give them an opportunity to mul
tiply their profits many times.
Also, on the face of it, it will
increase the amount of off
campus accommodation availa
ble to students. However. I think
we would be naive to imagine
that the rents for these con
dominiums will lie within a stu
dent budget.
In view of the fact that three
homes on Roble Avenue have
already been demolished to
make way for an expensive
seven-unit condominium com
plex. I think the matter demands
immediate attention. I would be
interested in hearing other
people's opinions.

Employees rude
I found the story about law
students acting rude to Sequoia
Travel employees (Daily, Feb.
12) laughable. But then again
Sequoia should certainly recog
nize rudeness when they see it.
In my experience with service
companies, I have consistently
found the employees of Sequoia
to among the rudest, least help
ful anywhere. And they work for
an agency which provides less
service at greater cost than any
other I have encountered. I had
never heard of a travel agency
charging for anything before I
came to Sequoia.
But I learned my lesson. I buy
my tickets oil campus. That way
I can't offend anyone at Sequoia
