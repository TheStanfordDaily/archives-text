## 'Dear Abby' keeps learning 
### Kathleen McClung Staff Writer 
Dear Ah by,
1 have a terrible problem. I
hope you can help me.
The problem is that I've be
come cynical. For instance, w hen
I heard that you would be gi\ ing
a lecture here in the Communi
cation Department Tuesday, my
first reaction was to snicker.
"Dear Abby at Stanford?" I
thought. "Wow. Next we'll get
Captain Kangaroo or maybe Zsa
Zsa Gabor."
I swallowed my cynicism tem
porarily and went to your lec
ture, "Confessions of a Syndi
cated Columnist."
You began by answering the
one question you're asked most:
how did you ever get started writ
ing an advice column?
'Disgusted'
"When my family first moved
to Hillsborough, California in
1955 I decided that the San
Francisco Chronicle needed a lot

of help. I was disgusted with the
advice column. So I just rang up
the editor and asked if he'd let
me do it. 1 had no experience
whatsoever. I was a 37-year-old
housewife. I just had a gut feel
ing I could do it."
That gut feeling certainly paid
off. Your column now appears in
hundreds of newspapers all over
the world. You receive 12,000 to
14,000 letters each week.
"There's no way to answer all
of them. Eighty percent of my
mail is unanswerable, because
they've signed 'Perplexed in
Houston' or something.
Leg-shaving
"I get an awful lot of ear
piercing or leg-shaving ques
tions. "My mother won't let me
pierce my ears. What'll I do?'
type of thing. But I don't create
any letters. I don't have to create
them. I receive so many.

structivc advice, to point out
both sides of a situation.
"I do think I'm more liberal
now. I was raised in a middle
class. Jewish. Midwest family.
My sister and I were very good
girls. We were respectable, re
sponsible. obedient. We didn't
smoke, drink or go too far. I
don't know how far is too far
now.
Living together
" I've done a lot of growing and
I'm still learning. For example,
I've changed my mind on the
subject of living together.
Twenty years ago I couldn't see
that. It was a no-no. It just wasn't
done. I've learned since that it
could be helpful, and very heal
thy. It's not all that bad.
"I also feel strongly about the
subjects of abortion and
homosexuality. No woman
should be forced by law to have a
child she doesn't want.
"1 think that homosexuals are
not sick. It's a God-given right to
love in your own way. My sister
(columnist Ann l anders) says
homosexuals are sick. Well, I say
she's sick.
A prophet
"You know, my real name is
I'auline Phillips. I chose the
name Abigail Van Buren be
cause in the Old Testament
Abigail was a prophet. It was
said about her, 'blessed art thou
and blessed is thy advice.' To-i
gether with Van Buren, which isj
aristocratic and very American, I
knew that that was the name I
wanted.
I truly love what I do. I would
pay them to let me do it."
Dear Abby, your candid and
characteristically witty remarks
seemed to charm the audience
that filled the auditorium. After
listening to you. I felt somehow a
little less cynical. 1 think, in a
way, you helped me solve my
problem.
Signed,
Grateful at Stanford
Dear Grateful,
Vour mother is right, toots.
You are too young to pierce your
ears.
Abby
