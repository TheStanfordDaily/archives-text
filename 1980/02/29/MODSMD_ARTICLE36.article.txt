II you're taken aback by midterms,
there are other frustrations in life,
lake my joh. following is a question
that has stymied me for a month.
When did women start slia\ing their
leg.s, unci why?
Nnlis to Know
Deai Stubbles,
Your benign-sounding question al
most pushed me over the brink. In
seareh of a suitable answer. I first tried
to solieit help from the logieal
aeademie departments — anthropol
ogy, psychology, soeiology and human
biology. Did any ol them know any
thing about such a mundane subject?
Of course not, I rejoin.
Hp against a brick scholastic wall. I
desperately subjected my sell to more
sniggering replies and giggles..l called
the Graduate School ol Business, as
suming that such a hav en of corporate
endeavor would undoubtedly be
stockpiled with reams ol historical ad
vertising material. Well. I did learn
trom a friendly voice that flappers 111
the 20s used to shave and even dye
their legs. b\en the Women's Center
and the Center for Research on
Women at Stanford were stumped.
I inally, a reference librarian at
(ircen provided me with a I U7 1 publi
cation. frankly titled Hair, by Wendy
Cooper. Although only nicking mod
em customs, the book did contain in
sight on the roots ol body-hair re
moval.
Apparently the tradition began in
ancient Egypt, where neither men
nore women allowed any body hair to
remain; it was clearly thought to be
boll) ugly and unhygienic. In ancient
Greece. complete depilation was the

rule for women, always excepting head
hair. Young boys were also expected
to remove hairs from their legs, but to
retain their pubic hair.
I he Cireek influence had an effect
on Koine, where the widespread cus
tom was to remove all hair from the
body. In the Middle Ages, returning
Crusaders brought back to Europe
from the Fast the idea of depilation for
women, and such was adopted tor a
time by the European aristocracy.
Hair removal practices also
emerged in totally separate cultures.
I he Dodingo ol Uganda practiced de
pilation ol all body hair, including the
pubic.
South American Indian lore
suggested that body hair was removed
because the Indian considered brute
creation so inferior to himself that lie
thought it degrading to resemble an
animal in any way. even in hairiness.
Depilation was common, as well,
among the North American Indians,
who have sparse body hair anyway.
Among the Bakitara of central Af
rica, a young girl approaching mar
riage had all her body hair shaved oil.
excluding pubic hair, which was
plucked by her mother. The process
was so painful that it took a week to
accomplish. The Ba-ila of Northern
Rhodesia also required young adults
to remove pubic and armpit hair by
rubbing it with warm ashed and then
plucking it.
In a partial but not total non
sequitur. I'll bet you never knew that
even King Solomon, that renowned
mine mogul, was reputed to have de
manded that the Queen of Sheba re
move "nature's veil" before he would
sleep with her.
Anyway, in most of the Western

world today, women remove unde
rarm and leg hair, mostly by shaving,
but I'm not quite sure when the custom
was actually resumed — perhaps in the
'20s? In this practice, most women
seem to be willing to yield to male
preferences, which a survey by author
Wendy Cooper showed to favor such
auxiliary shaving by a 75 to 16 percent
margin.
112 urthermore, many athletes of both
sexes shave their bodies, more for
practical than aesthetic reasons, lor
example, cyclists shave their legs to
avoid painful entanglements, swim
mers shave both for physiological and
psychological benefits, and body buil
ders shave and oil their bodies for the
sake of an even more muscular ap
pearance.
Leg shav ing is also viewed as a pas
sing phase by some. Lillian Roxon, a
journalistic authority on the young,
earlier said that "In the '70s women
will stop shaving their legs. By 1975
every pretty girl will have hairy legs.
Otherwise, she will look old
fashioned."
I don't think her dream has
materialized just yet. but who knows?
And, speaking of unconsciousness,
here's a plea from a red-eyed inquirer.
/ wake n/> throughout the night to the
slightest noise. Is there any way that <o
light sleeper can become a heavy
sleeper?
- lired of Waking Up
Dear Big Ears.
Dr. Richard Coleman, a research as
sociate at the sleep center at the Medi
cal Center, said that his answer would
depend on the cause ol your wakeful
ness. If vou are victimized by some

kind of sleep disorder, such as noctural
myoclonus (excessive leg movement
and muscle jerks throughout the
night), your case could be researched
and treated.
Hut. if a sleeping disorder is not in
volved and you simply respond to
sounds in your sleep. Coleman was not
sure ot any real training which could
ameliorate your problem. You could
directly attack the source of your dis
content by attempting to eliminate the
noise.
Such action might, in some dorms,
achieve your ultimate ends by placing
you permanently in a sound-proot
room. Yet a better idea would be to
invest in a pair of earplugs.
Mot off the presses is ;m update on
last week's column. A report entitled
Sexuality and College Life was recently
published by Joseph kat/ and Denise
Cronin on a study undertaken by them
between 1970 and 1977. Using Stan
lord as a base, data was collected from
609S men and women residential stu
dents at 13 different colleges and uni
versities.
The authors reported that "today's
students have sex more often, and
their lirst sexual experiences take
place at an earlier age. In 1970 about
halt ot the men and women students
reported having had sexual inter
course. Seven years later the figures
were much higher: 7«S percent ot the
men and 72 percent of the women (for
all four years combined."' The average
age ot the student at the time o! the
first sexual experience had dropped
from IS to 17. So, I will again iterate
that the college virgin does appear to
be a vanishing breed.
