# Senators move to limit Fed budget
## 
### John Averill The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — A bipar
tisan group of senators
threatened Wednesday to launch
an "anti-inflation" filibuster un
less the Senate agreed to vote on
their plan to cut President Jimmy
Carter's budget by $26 billion.
Only one of the group. Sen.
William Proxmire (I)-Wis.). was
willing to specify where the cuts
should be made, but the other
senators quickly objected to his
proposed reductions in defense
spending and federal revenue
sharing.
"Absolutely not," said Sen.
Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) when
the five senators who joined
Proxmire at a news conference
were asked if they would go
along with a cut in defense
spending. The rest nodded ag
reement with Domenici.
The news conference was cal
led by Sen. William Roth (R-
Del.) to unveil a non-binding
"sense ot the Senate" resolution
that would call for limiting fed
eral spending to 21 percent ot
the nation's gross national pro
duct.
Carter's budget proposed
spending $615.8 billion in the
fiscal year beginning next Oct. 1.
with a deficit of SI 5.<S billion.
The budget represents 22.3 per
cent of the gross national pro
duct. Should Roth's proposal be
approved, it would result in a
budget of $590 billion and a
surplus of $ I 0 billion.
More guns, less taxes
Roth said the surplus could be
used to cut taxes and to increase
defense spending over the
$142.7 billion that Carter has

proposed. The president's
budget calls for a $15.3 billion
boost in defense spending over
the current fiscal year.
Declaring that the present rate
of inflation of IX percent has
produced a "national
emergency," Roth said his group
was prepared to mount a filibus
ter unless the Senate agreed to
vote on his resolution, which has
42 co-sponsors.
"If necessary, we're going to
bring business-as-usual to a halt
in the Senate until we get a vote
on limiting federal spending, "
Roth said.
Muskie challenge
Roth and the others were chal
lenged by Sen. Edmund Muskie
(D-Maine), chairman of the
Seante Budget Committee, to
specify where the spending cuts
should be made.
Muskie noted that last month
34 of Roth's co-sponsors, but not
Roth himself, voted to "break
the budget for veterans' prog
rams" by $350 million and that
26 co-sponsors voted to waive a
provision of the disability insur
ance bill that would cost $132
million, a figure not con
templated in the budget.
"It is encouraging to see that
so many of these senators who
refused to pay the price for fiscal
discipline just one month ago are
now eager to make public de
mands to end such profligacy,"
Muskie said.
'Not constructive*
Although Proxmire said he ag
reed with Roth and the others on
the need to cut spending, he said
he would not join in a filibuster.

to legislate." he said.
