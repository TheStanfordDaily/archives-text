# Dance Week begins
## 
### Hillary Hall Staff Writer 
If you're tired of art as an
isolated moment of brilliance
that you missed â€” as some
thing passe, framed and fro
zen in museums or rehearsed
and endlessly reiterated in
concert halls, then plan to at
tend the workshops and per
formances offered during
Dance Week 'SO.
From tomorrow until
Thursday, the Stanford
Dance Division and the Stan
lord Dance Quorum are col
laborating for the first time to
produce a varied program
that will include some of the
newest dance and accompan
iment currently coming out ol
New York and Los Angeles.
Eugene Haney, a coor
dinator ol Dance Week SO,
said that "the goals ol the
program are to encourage
Bay area participation in
Stanford dance activities as
well as to call attention to the
fact that Stanford does have
an active dance department."
Although department di
rector Inga Weiss has held
weekly workshops in the past,
and the Dance Quorum has
sponsored several lecture
demonstrations and master

classes each quarter, Haney
obseved that "the integrated
aspect of and the collabora
tion involved in the week
long program are significant
new developments." In the
past, Haney said, "the Stan
lord Dance Division and the
Quorum acted singly, spon
soring events independent of
one another."
Dance Week 'SO will also
draw attention to the newly
established Stanford Dance
Quorum which is student-run
and funded through ASSU.
Although only in its second
year, the Quorum hasalready
expanded upon the class of
ferings in the Dance Depart
ment by setting up ballet and
jazz classes outside of the of
ficial University curriculum.
In addition. Dance Week
SO provides an opportunity
lor University dancers and
musicians to work with out
side professionals that are ac
tive in this contemporary
creative medium. In Roble
dance studio tomorrow from
1 0 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sunday
from 2 to 4 p.m., dancers will
be able to participate in a
dance/music workshop enti
tled "Variations for Dan
cers.'* featuring Weiss,

Michael Cava, a visiting
pianist from New York, and
San Francisco-based cellist
composer Gwendolyn Wat
son.
Also in Roble tomorrow at
S p.m. and Sunday at 5 p.m.,
the "Dime a Dance" com
pany from New York will per
form with Diane De Franco
of the I.os Angeles Dance
Theater. As a part of the
program, the company will
present the first-prize piece
from the International Dance
Festival in Cologne (1979)
and a piece choreographed by
the University's Diane I rec
cero that premiered just hist
year in New York.
