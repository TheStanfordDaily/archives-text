# Leap year day means extra profits
## 
### Robert E. Dallos The Los Angeles Times 
NEW YORK — McDonald's will sell an
extra six million hamburgers today.
California will collect an added $50 mill
ion in taxes.
Resorts International Inc., the giant
gambling company, stands to boost its annual
profits by about $250,000.
It is all due to Feb. 2 ( ), an extra day that
comes around but once every four years.
And while the women's liberation movement
has made passe that old Leap Year cliche
that allows ladies to take the matrimonial
initiative on this day, there is another impor
tant aspect that still occurs — the nation's
cash registers jingle. Feb. 2M means an added
day of activity for most businesses.
The extra day, especially when it falls on a
working day as it does Friday, causes a "rip
ple effect throughout the entire economy,"
according to one economist. And, while it is
true that some businesses — the insurance
industry, for example — suffer adversely
from the extra Leap Year day. most reap a
windfall.
All told, an extra $3.5 billion to $4.5 bill
ion will be pumped into the economy. esti
mates Kenneth Goldstein, associate
economist of the Conference Board.
"It's an extra day of economic activity," he
says."It results in an extra day ol spending
power. Workers can go to the grocery store,
the clothing store and the auto showroom
with the extra dollars they earned that day to
buy the things they want to buy. As a result, it
boosts the entire economy. Those extra dol
lars spent by workers boost business income

and result in added corporate profits. They
boost taxes. They boost church contribu
tions. They boost savings. They boost in
vestment."
Robert Lewis, a vice president of Citibank,
maintains that the added day could have
even more important implications for the
American economy.
"In this year when everyone is worried
whether the gross national product is going
to rise by I percent or fall by 1 percent, that
extra one-365th more production we'll be
getting will mean that the CjNP is going to be
0.3 percent higher than it would in a non-
Leap Year. And if one calculated it on the
basis of working days — there are about 260
in a year — it will boost production by 0.4
percent. In a year that is hanging in the ba
lance, it would make the difference between
a plus or a minus year."
As expected, the extra profits to
businesses also mean added tax revenues to
government on all levels. The office of Tax
Analysis of the Treasury Department esti
mates that Uncle Sam will collect'an addi
tional 51.4 billion to $ 1.5 billion in all forms
of taxes. Not all will be a windfall, for the
federal government, for example, will be
conducting business as usual today, so it must
spend money, too. Just the extra day's fed
eral government payroll for all 2.S million
civilian government employees will total
roughly $208 million, according to the Office
of Management and Budget.
Of the $50 million in taxes California will
collect, $37 million will be channeled to local
governments, while the rest will be retained
by the state for operating expenses. An offi

cial dI the Board of Equalization said last
Friday that state employees are paid on a
monthly basis, so they will not have to pay
extra wages.
Business, like the federal government, also
must pay tor an added day's overhead —
payroll, utilities, taxes and the like before
they can calculate how much of a real benefit
they will receive from the extra day's busi
ness.
According to the Air Transport Associa
tion, an industry group, the 3 1 hard-pressed
scheduled airlines will generate passenger
and freight revenues of 170 million today.
Since it is expected that, as an industry, they
will make somewhat less than two cents in
profits on every dollar of revenues, the ATA
figures about $1 million of today's extra bus
iness will filter down into the profit column.
"F or an industry that is only making two
cents on the dollar," says an ATA spokes
man, "the extra day is meaningful. Of course,
we'd much rather have that extra day in the
summer when more of our revenue dollar
ends up in the profit column. But then you
can't have everything."
Since everyone has to eat on Leap Year,
the restaurant industry reaps a bonanza, too.
Just look at McDonald's to set the signifi
cance. The chain has 5769 facilities
worldwide, each is patronized by an average
of 1000 people daily. The result: an extra
$5.3 million net profits for the chain of fast
food restaurants.
Banks and mutual funds whch compound
interest annually must also pay depositors for
an extra day's use of their deposits.

Business, like the federal government, also
must pay tor an added day's overhead —
payroll, utilities, taxes and the like before
they can calculate how much of a real benefit
they will receive from the extra day's busi
ness.
According to the Air Transport Associa
tion, an industry group, the 3 1 hard-pressed
scheduled airlines will generate passenger
and freight revenues of 170 million today.
Since it is expected that, as an industry, they
will make somewhat less than two cents in
profits on every dollar of revenues, the ATA
figures about $1 million of today's extra bus
iness will filter down into the profit column.
"F or an industry that is only making two
cents on the dollar," says an ATA spokes
man, "the extra day is meaningful. Of course,
we'd much rather have that extra day in the
summer when more of our revenue dollar
ends up in the profit column. But then you
can't have everything."
Since everyone has to eat on Leap Year,
the restaurant industry reaps a bonanza, too.
Just look at McDonald's to set the signifi
cance. The chain has 5769 facilities
worldwide, each is patronized by an average
of 1000 people daily. The result: an extra
$5.3 million net profits for the chain of fast
food restaurants.
Banks and mutual funds whch compound
interest annually must also pay depositors for
an extra day's use of their deposits.
NEW YORK — McDonald's will sell an
extra six million hamburgers today.
California will collect an added $50 mill
ion in taxes.
Resorts International Inc., the giant
gambling company, stands to boost its annual
profits by about $250,000.
It is all due to Feb. 2 ( ), an extra day that
comes around but once every four years.
And while the women's liberation movement
has made passe that old Leap Year cliche
that allows ladies to take the matrimonial
initiative on this day, there is another impor
tant aspect that still occurs — the nation's
cash registers jingle. Feb. 2M means an added
day of activity for most businesses.
The extra day, especially when it falls on a
working day as it does Friday, causes a "rip
ple effect throughout the entire economy,"
according to one economist. And, while it is
true that some businesses — the insurance
industry, for example — suffer adversely
from the extra Leap Year day. most reap a
windfall.
All told, an extra $3.5 billion to $4.5 bill
ion will be pumped into the economy. esti
mates Kenneth Goldstein, associate
economist of the Conference Board.
"It's an extra day of economic activity," he
says."It results in an extra day ol spending
power. Workers can go to the grocery store,
the clothing store and the auto showroom
with the extra dollars they earned that day to
buy the things they want to buy. As a result, it
boosts the entire economy. Those extra dol
lars spent by workers boost business income

and result in added corporate profits. They
boost taxes. They boost church contribu
tions. They boost savings. They boost in
vestment."
Robert Lewis, a vice president of Citibank,
maintains that the added day could have
even more important implications for the
American economy.
"In this year when everyone is worried
whether the gross national product is going
to rise by I percent or fall by 1 percent, that
extra one-365th more production we'll be
getting will mean that the CjNP is going to be
0.3 percent higher than it would in a non-
Leap Year. And if one calculated it on the
basis of working days — there are about 260
in a year — it will boost production by 0.4
percent. In a year that is hanging in the ba
lance, it would make the difference between
a plus or a minus year."
As expected, the extra profits to
businesses also mean added tax revenues to
government on all levels. The office of Tax
Analysis of the Treasury Department esti
mates that Uncle Sam will collect'an addi
tional 51.4 billion to $ 1.5 billion in all forms
of taxes. Not all will be a windfall, for the
federal government, for example, will be
conducting business as usual today, so it must
spend money, too. Just the extra day's fed
eral government payroll for all 2.S million
civilian government employees will total
roughly $208 million, according to the Office
of Management and Budget.
Of the $50 million in taxes California will
collect, $37 million will be channeled to local
governments, while the rest will be retained
by the state for operating expenses. An offi

cial dI the Board of Equalization said last
Friday that state employees are paid on a
monthly basis, so they will not have to pay
extra wages.
