# Belton sets records as UCLA wins
## Cagers lose, 75-62 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
"It's nice tn break a record,
but when you lose while you're
doing it.it takes away a lot of the
joy"
That sums up the essence of
senior forward Kimberly Bel
ton's career at Stanford. Belton
became the most productive
player 111 Stanford history last
night as he scored 23 points to
raise his career total to 1577.
That's 27 points more than
Claude Terry who had held the
record before him.
With 5 7 left in the game Bel
ton sent a twisting bank shot o\er
All-America Kiki Vandeweghe
to break the record and lift al
most 6000 fans off their seats lor
a stand ovation. But in the same
game, the Cards fell to a
mediocre UCLA team 75-62
and dropped their record in the
Pac-10 to 4-13 (6-19 overall).
Belton could play forany team
m the country and probably do
just as well as he has done on the
Farm. But he doesn't play for the
Kentuckys or the DePauls or
even the Oregon States. He plays
for Stanford, a program which
has a Pac-10 record of 21-56
over the last five years. That
would take a lot of the joy out ot
a career which deserves a lot of
exultation.
Belton found some satisfac
tion in breaking the record,
though, as. of course he should,
saying that. "Everybody always
said I couldn't shoot, couldn't
shoot from the outside. But I
guess this shows that I can score.
I'm happ\ with being able to play
for four years fighting off the in
juries and all that." He has
played 106 consecutive games,
starting 103 of those.
"Every night out Belton plays
as close to his maximum as he is
capable." said Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso. "I think
that's what even body wants to
do. whether it be as a basketball
player, a student, or even you
guys as sportswriters. I'm very
happy for him. because he's
worked hard for this."
The game itself was somew hat
overshadowed by Belton's
achievement. The fans in Maples

Pavilion found themselves smil
ing through defeat as UCLA
began to pull away with the game
after the official time out held in
Belton's honor. After Claude
Terry came on the floor to relin
quish the record and present Bol
ton with an award, the Cards re
turned to the tloor — little flus
tered by all the excitement and
never seemed to regain total
composure.
Stanford started out the game
controlling the tempo and mak
ing the Bruins answer in the
tradeoff for points. The Cards
were content throughout the
game to pass the ball until the
right shot came around. They
have been improving in that re
gard for the last eight games. It
payed off last night as Stanford
looked at a 2 1 -2 1 tie with 7:2<S to
go in the first half. Even when
they lost the ball to UCLA's tight
man-to-man defense, the Bruins
often blew the opportunity to go
ahead. Most of this had to do
with the fact that Stanford
played tough defense as well,
holding UCLA below .500 in
shooting and holding their
mainstay. Vandeweghe, to only
two points all half.
But the Bruins took the lead in
the tradeoff by halftime. 31-31.
and were there to stay.
Vandeweghe scored first out
of the lockerroom on his way to
14 second half points. The
Bruins stretched it out to 39-33
in the next two minutes but Stan
ford pulled it back to within one
with 14:01 to go on shots by
Brian Welch and Belton. In the
next two minutes, however, the
Cards dropped nine points to
UCLA and were forced to take
two time outs. Stanford simply
lost the ball a couple of times and
Doug Marty rushed a shot while
UCLA decided to improve their
scoring percentage all at once.
Shots by Rod Foster, Michael
Holton, Cliff Pruitt and Van
deweghe pretty much closed the
doors on the Cards for the night.
Last night's game was the sec
ond in a row and one of many this
season in which the Cards played
well, sometimes very well, but
not well enough to win.
"It seems as though we almost

have to play error-free to make it
happen." Dißiaso said after the
game. "There were two keys to
night. One was their transition
baskets. They hit so many short
jumpers and lay tips. And two,
they shot extremely well in the
second half."
UCLA coach Larry Brown
echoed what every other coach
the Cards have met this year has
said. It's vinegar in the ears to
anyone calling for Dißiaso's job.
"They aren't real high up in
the league as lar as talent," said
Brown, "but they are as discip
lined and well coached as any
team in the league. We haven't
done that well this year and we
•have a lot of young players. I can
appreciate what he's going
through. They controlled the
tempo verv well in the first half.
We finally got our momentum in
the second half."
Stanford finishes up its season
tomorrow night against USC.
The disappointments of the sea
son could probably be alleviated
quite a bit. at least in the mem
ory. it the Cards could muster up
a win. It's entirely possible — Cal
did it last night. And, by the way.
Belton needs only one more re
bound this year to break Rich
Kelly's career record ol 944.
Somehow it seems right that he
should save the best for last.

Belton could play forany team
m the country and probably do
just as well as he has done on the
Farm. But he doesn't play for the
Kentuckys or the DePauls or
even the Oregon States. He plays
for Stanford, a program which
has a Pac-10 record of 21-56
over the last five years. That
would take a lot of the joy out ot
a career which deserves a lot of
exultation.
Belton found some satisfac
tion in breaking the record,
though, as. of course he should,
saying that. "Everybody always
said I couldn't shoot, couldn't
shoot from the outside. But I
guess this shows that I can score.
I'm happ\ with being able to play
for four years fighting off the in
juries and all that." He has
played 106 consecutive games,
starting 103 of those.
"Every night out Belton plays
as close to his maximum as he is
capable." said Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso. "I think
that's what even body wants to
do. whether it be as a basketball
player, a student, or even you
guys as sportswriters. I'm very
happy for him. because he's
worked hard for this."
The game itself was somew hat
overshadowed by Belton's
achievement. The fans in Maples

Pavilion found themselves smil
ing through defeat as UCLA
began to pull away with the game
after the official time out held in
Belton's honor. After Claude
Terry came on the floor to relin
quish the record and present Bol
ton with an award, the Cards re
turned to the tloor — little flus
tered by all the excitement and
never seemed to regain total
composure.
Stanford started out the game
controlling the tempo and mak
ing the Bruins answer in the
tradeoff for points. The Cards
were content throughout the
game to pass the ball until the
right shot came around. They
have been improving in that re
gard for the last eight games. It
payed off last night as Stanford
looked at a 2 1 -2 1 tie with 7:2<S to
go in the first half. Even when
they lost the ball to UCLA's tight
man-to-man defense, the Bruins
often blew the opportunity to go
ahead. Most of this had to do
with the fact that Stanford
played tough defense as well,
holding UCLA below .500 in
shooting and holding their
mainstay. Vandeweghe, to only
two points all half.
But the Bruins took the lead in
the tradeoff by halftime. 31-31.
and were there to stay.
Vandeweghe scored first out
of the lockerroom on his way to
14 second half points. The
Bruins stretched it out to 39-33
in the next two minutes but Stan
ford pulled it back to within one
with 14:01 to go on shots by
Brian Welch and Belton. In the
next two minutes, however, the
Cards dropped nine points to
UCLA and were forced to take
two time outs. Stanford simply
lost the ball a couple of times and
Doug Marty rushed a shot while
UCLA decided to improve their
scoring percentage all at once.
Shots by Rod Foster, Michael
Holton, Cliff Pruitt and Van
deweghe pretty much closed the
doors on the Cards for the night.
Last night's game was the sec
ond in a row and one of many this
season in which the Cards played
well, sometimes very well, but
not well enough to win.
"It seems as though we almost

have to play error-free to make it
happen." Dißiaso said after the
game. "There were two keys to
night. One was their transition
baskets. They hit so many short
jumpers and lay tips. And two,
they shot extremely well in the
second half."
UCLA coach Larry Brown
echoed what every other coach
the Cards have met this year has
said. It's vinegar in the ears to
anyone calling for Dißiaso's job.
"They aren't real high up in
the league as lar as talent," said
Brown, "but they are as discip
lined and well coached as any
team in the league. We haven't
done that well this year and we
•have a lot of young players. I can
appreciate what he's going
through. They controlled the
tempo verv well in the first half.
We finally got our momentum in
the second half."
Stanford finishes up its season
tomorrow night against USC.
The disappointments of the sea
son could probably be alleviated
quite a bit. at least in the mem
ory. it the Cards could muster up
a win. It's entirely possible — Cal
did it last night. And, by the way.
Belton needs only one more re
bound this year to break Rich
Kelly's career record ol 944.
Somehow it seems right that he
should save the best for last.

Stanford senior kimberley Helton rewrote the Cardinal re
cord book last night when he scored this basket, and his 1551st
career point breaking Claude Terry's career scoring record.
"It's nice tn break a record,
but when you lose while you're

joy"
That sums up the essence of
senior forward Kimberly Bel

became the most productive
player 111 Stanford history last
night as he scored 23 points to
raise his career total to 1577.
That's 27 points more than
Claude Terry who had held the
record before him.
With 5 7 left in the game Bel
ton sent a twisting bank shot o\er
All-America Kiki Vandeweghe
to break the record and lift al
most 6000 fans off their seats lor
a stand ovation. But in the same
game, the Cards fell to a
mediocre UCLA team 75-62

Pac-10 to 4-13 (6-19 overall).
