# Batmen face Pac-10 opener ranked No. 1
## 
### Peter Finch Staff Writer 
The time to get serious, as they
say, is now for Mark Marquess
and the Stanford baseball team.
I folding a very unexpected No.
1 national ranking by Collegiate
H its eb ill I.the Cardinals open
their Pacific-10 season this
weekend at Sunken diamond
with three games against the
powerful Arizona Wildcats.
As of last week, Stanford was
12-0 and the only undefeated
team in the Pac-10. A disap
pointing 10th inning loss to
Santa Clara this Tuesday, how
ever. marred the Cards' un
blemished record, but was appa
rently not enough to knock them
out of their No. 1 spot.
In preseason play last year,
Stanford posted a 15-4 record,
stringing together a 9-game win
ning streak at the season's out
set. When it came to Pac-10
competition, though, the Cards
struggled, managing only a
13-17 league mark. At season's
end, they were left with a 35-23
record and fifth place in the
Pac-10 Southern Division.
Now Marquess can only hope
for a stronger conference per
formance. He is fully aware of
the strength of each team in the
conference, probably the tough
est in all of collegiate baseball.
He needs consistent outings
from all his players if he wants to
succeed — 1 ike he's done so far
this year.
But conference play is diffe
rent.
Arizona, which finished sec
ond in the Pac-10 Southern Divi
sion last year behind UCLA, is
presently ranked No. 3 in the na
tion. Many predict the Wildcats
will be the post season national
champions lor 1980.
Marquess doesn't disagree.
"Arizona is a very tough
team," he said. "They are the
favorite to win the league. They
hit extremely well, and they have
a lot of veterans this year — lots
of juniors and seniors."
But. Marquess has far from
thrown in the towel on this
weekends' games.
" I think we're capable of beat
ing them," he said."We have not
hit very well lately, but hopefully
we can put it together, breakout,
and hit better."
The Wildcats, 8-2-1 thus far,
lost to Fullerton and San Diego
State, and tied UCLA in a 12-
inning marathon. They're led by
first-team AII-Pac-10 selections
Craig Lefferts (2-0. 3.0 ERA),

first-baseman/out fielder Wes
Clements (.385, five home runs,
24 RBI), first-baseman/
outfielder Terry Francona
(.448), and shortstop Clark Crist
(.304, 1 1 RBI).
The Wildcats will likely start
Lefferts, a left-hander, in Fri
day's opener. Right-hander
Greg Barger (1-0, 0.00 ERA in
19 innings) should start game no.
2, and one of three lefties — Ed
Vosberg (1-0, 1.64), Jeff Morris
(1-0, 5.79) or Ron Sismondo
(1-2, 8.31) will start Sunday's
game.
Marquess expects to start
transfer student Lee Cline (3-0,
2.225 ERA), the Cards' top
pitcher right now, on Friday.
Senior Larry Kuhn (2-0, 2.78)
should be on the mound Satur
day, and sophomore right
hander Brian Mignano (2-0,
2.95 ERA) will pitch Sunday.
The Cards' top reliever remains
sophomore Mike Sullivan (2-0.
2.54). He will probably see some
action this weekend as well.
Offensively, Stanford is led by
freshman Mike Aldrete, who is
hitting .448 in 10 games. Close
behind him is senior second
baseman Paul Zuvella, a .436
batter who has been walked a
team-leading 12 times.
Third baseman Steve
Buechele, a freshman, leads the
team with 1 1 RBI and junior
catcher Bill Worden is in front
with three homers, while batting
a strong .355. Other key hitters
include first baseman Loring
Davies (.300), and outfielders
Mike Dotterer (.290). John
Elway (.286) and Mike Tooth
man (.281).
According to Marquess, the
team is not at all nervous about
entering conference play.
"We're going to play hard all
the time." he said. "We've be
come close as a team and we're
ready to play. This league's al
ways a challenge, but that's what
it's all about.
"If we continue to work hard,
we'll get better as we go along."
Marquess' words ring with typ
ical preseason confidence, to be
sure. But he also knows things
may not be that simple.
"You can't play this caliber ol
teams (in the Pac-10) and not
lose. It's not possible," he said.
"We're playing well-coached
teams with a lot of talent."
Apparently, others have a lot
of confidence in Stanford's team,
hence the national ranking. Only
the Pac-10 season can prove
them wrong or right.
