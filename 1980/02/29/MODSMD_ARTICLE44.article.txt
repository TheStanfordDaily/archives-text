# Coach Wiggin discusses recruiting
## 
### 
Paul Wiggin, who started out
playing for Stanford in the '50s
and now returns us its head coach
in the '80s, faces a coach's night
rtiare as he reestablishes himself
on the Farm. The team he is to
coach has seen three coaches in
four years and a number of set
backs. The program doesn 't even
have a set group of assistant
coaches. But the team lias also
done some great things in those
four years and has grown a lot.
That should ease the transition.
Wiggin's haircut suggests an
Army seargent, but that is only
reinforced by his vigor, not his
attitude. He is glad to be back. In
this Friday Interview with Sally
Jenkins, Wiggin explains what it's
like.
Jenkins: How do you think the
recruiting effort went? Are you
happy with what you got?
Wiggin: I think it was well done
in the sense of all the things being
considered. I think someone
ranked us as tied for ninth in the

nation. It's difficult for mc to
rank this young player against
apother just off the top of my
head because I came in in the
midst of all of it and did not get a
chance to look at film, did not get
a chance to say this player is bet
ter than that player, where does
he rank and how does he lit na
tionally. We are dealing a little
bit differently at Stanford be
cause it's a scholar-athlete that
we are looking at. so a lot of
weeding out goes at that level.
There are players we would like
to have that we can't even deal
with, because you know you are
going to get cut off at the admis
sions office anyway.
So what we had was, all things
considered, an outstanding re
cruiting year. And I say that, not
patting myself 011 the back, be
cause I really had very little to do
with it. Doug Single coordinated
it. Ray Handley from the staff
standpoint was involved in the
coordinating. From the coaches

point of view Jim Fassil and
Brian Shaw were the people who
really did the work.
All 1 did was come in and meet
families and meet kids and from
my standpoint really sell Stan
ford from a couple of decades
ago. My departure from Stan
ford had really been as a profes
sional player and then as a coach.
The neat part for me
recruiting-wise was the fact that
the only thing I really knew was
Stanford, so my sales pitch or
whatever you want to call it was
based on just the positive things I
knew about the University and it
was neat that all the things that 1
believed in 25 years ago still
exist: the excellence in
academics and athletics, things
like that. Based on everything 1
know about your people, I think
we had an exceptional year. We
reinforced our team in two criti
cal areas, offensive and defen
sive linemen.
Ours has been a team based on

skill, we have always had the
great quarterbacks and receivers
and runningbacks and I think a
year from now we are going to
have to look in those areas. We
will lose Ken Margerum, and we
want to keep that skill level up.
We did not reinforce our receiv
ing corps, or our quarterbacks,
which will hurt us a little bit. So 1
would just say that the fact we
brought the caliber of our secon
dary and defensive backs up to a
higher plane and our lines, shows
that we did an outstanding job.
Jenkins: What kind of adjust
ments have you had to make, or
are you going to have to make
going from coaching pro hall to
coaching Stanford?
Wigjjin: Football is football basi
cally, and that part of it stands
up. Our concept of football is
very close to the pro's and some
times even more complex and I
think that's attributable to the
quality of the intellect of the
Stanford athlete.
I think the thing you're going
to find is that we are dealing with
kind of a cycle. The first cycle
would certainly he football itsell
during the season. The next one
would be recruiting, and the next
one would be spring practice. It's
a little bit different; il I were still
at New Orleans right now, loot
ball season, which would be a 20
game schedule, would be a much
more intensified thing for a
longer period ol time. Here it's
an I 1 game season with maybe a
bowl game at the end as the frost
ing on the cake. That's the main
difference. It's an endurance
thing for the coach. You must
stay with it when you really want
to say hey, this is enough, and at
that point you have seven or
eight more games to go. In col
lege it's a more natural season.
Then the off season is the
reorganization — you try to up
grade and innovate. In pro loot
ball you have a little more time to
spend on that. Unfortunately. I
think sometimes we don't spend
enough time on that. You have a
little hit of success and you can
get a little complacent.
Jenkins: How much do you think
it affects a team to switch couches
so rapidly, as Stanford has done
in the last three years?
Wiggin: I would say that's not a
good thing to do to anyone. I
think that when you continually
change leadership, well, we're
dealing with a team concept,
well. I'm glad they changed one
more time to be honest with you.
But I would hope that I can be
here for a while, because I don't
think it's fair to the situation.
The neat part of recruiting was
that the name Stanford held up.
and the quality of what the name
represents held up, and it held up
through some very tough times
because in the chess play of re
cruiting you find that it's a ploy
that other schools use. They say
things like if Stanford is so i>ood

why do they keep changing
coaches. Actually it's a very
natural thing. Bill Walsh just
grew and grew and was great for
Stanlord and Stanford was great
tor him. Rod Dowhower for
some reason, something hap
pened, but what it came down to
was he chose to leave. It's
natural, but it's not good or sta
ble.
Jenkins: Do you think il is going
to have an effect on the people
you will he dealing with this sea
son?
Wiggin: We are going to try and
minimize the transitional shock
of this thing. One thing we are
going to try and do is continue to
use the same offensive terminol
ogy. When you have players like
Darrin Nelson and Ken
Margerum you don't want to
come in and change things if
what they were doing was work
ing. You want to stay with it. you
don't want to shoot the goose
that lays the golden eggs.
I think their reaction to me by
personality will be okay. I'm
banking on that. I can't say I
have a plan to deal with Stanford
athletes, but I haven't had a
problem with people before, so 1
think that will come very natur
ally. 1 feel good about it. I don't
think they will spend a lot of time
wondering where I am coming
from. I don't try to play games. I
don't pretend I'm Paul Brown or
Tom Landry. I'm Paul Wiggin
and I am going to roll the dice on
that basis.
Jenkins: What factors influenced
your decision to come here? Did
the fact that you went to school
here have anything to do with it?
Wiggin: It intluenced me a lot. In
evaluating my life, you look back
when you are 40. at least I did.
and try to evaluate where you are
and what you have done up to
that point — what was right, and
what was wrong. I think you
make three or four great deci
sions in your life and I think

Stanford was one of the great de
cisions I made.
In this situation everything
was right. Even though there was
a time in my life, when I went to
Kansas City to coach, when I
thought I had left it all behind,
the thought of ever coming back
was all behind and I was on a new
level. Up to that point I had al
ways had Stanford in the back of
my mind, the thought of coming
back here someday. It's always
been kind of a dream, though
there was that time when it kind
of diminished. But when this op
portunity came up it made sense.
There is a fear of the unknown
involved. When you're coaching
you would probably rather use
the word challenge instead of
fear, but legitimately it's fear. It's
scary. Right now I have to put
together a staff and we are going
to start spring practice in early
April and I don't even have a
staff. Somehow and someway it
will get done — we aren't just
going to play touch football.
That, believe me, represents a
little bit of the unknown and a
little bit of fear.
Jenkins: How are yon going to
deal with the Stanford syndrome,
the thought that the team rises to
the occasion hut doesn 't play well
against teams they are supposed
to heat?
Wiggin: It does seem that they
can rise higher than anyone, and
dive lower. I'm not sure how to
deal with it. I just hope that we
will be good enough to overcome
it.and I think that comes from
motivational factors.
I don't know that it's a syn
drome. You have to believe that
you can play the same way
against everybody. I hope we can
continue to climb the mountains
that Stanford has been able to
climb over the years. They have
had some great victories. But I
just hope we can stay out of the
valley a little more.

Wiggin: I think it was well done
in the sense of all the things being
considered. I think someone
ranked us as tied for ninth in the

nation. It's difficult for mc to
rank this young player against
apother just off the top of my
head because I came in in the
midst of all of it and did not get a
chance to look at film, did not get
a chance to say this player is bet
ter than that player, where does
he rank and how does he lit na
tionally. We are dealing a little
bit differently at Stanford be
cause it's a scholar-athlete that
we are looking at. so a lot of
weeding out goes at that level.
There are players we would like
to have that we can't even deal
with, because you know you are
going to get cut off at the admis
sions office anyway.
So what we had was, all things
considered, an outstanding re
cruiting year. And I say that, not
patting myself 011 the back, be
cause I really had very little to do
with it. Doug Single coordinated
it. Ray Handley from the staff
standpoint was involved in the
coordinating. From the coaches

point of view Jim Fassil and
Brian Shaw were the people who
really did the work.
All 1 did was come in and meet
families and meet kids and from
my standpoint really sell Stan
ford from a couple of decades
ago. My departure from Stan
ford had really been as a profes
sional player and then as a coach.
The neat part for me
recruiting-wise was the fact that
the only thing I really knew was
Stanford, so my sales pitch or
whatever you want to call it was
based on just the positive things I
knew about the University and it
was neat that all the things that 1
believed in 25 years ago still
exist: the excellence in
academics and athletics, things
like that. Based on everything 1
know about your people, I think
we had an exceptional year. We
reinforced our team in two criti
cal areas, offensive and defen
sive linemen.
Ours has been a team based on

skill, we have always had the
great quarterbacks and receivers
and runningbacks and I think a
year from now we are going to
have to look in those areas. We
will lose Ken Margerum, and we
want to keep that skill level up.
We did not reinforce our receiv
ing corps, or our quarterbacks,
which will hurt us a little bit. So 1
would just say that the fact we
brought the caliber of our secon
dary and defensive backs up to a
higher plane and our lines, shows
that we did an outstanding job.
Jenkins: What kind of adjust
ments have you had to make, or
are you going to have to make
going from coaching pro hall to
coaching Stanford?
Wigjjin: Football is football basi
cally, and that part of it stands
up. Our concept of football is
very close to the pro's and some
times even more complex and I
think that's attributable to the
quality of the intellect of the
Stanford athlete.
I think the thing you're going
to find is that we are dealing with
kind of a cycle. The first cycle
would certainly he football itsell
during the season. The next one
would be recruiting, and the next
one would be spring practice. It's
a little bit different; il I were still
at New Orleans right now, loot
ball season, which would be a 20
game schedule, would be a much
more intensified thing for a
longer period ol time. Here it's
an I 1 game season with maybe a
bowl game at the end as the frost
ing on the cake. That's the main
difference. It's an endurance
thing for the coach. You must
stay with it when you really want
to say hey, this is enough, and at
that point you have seven or
eight more games to go. In col
lege it's a more natural season.
Then the off season is the
reorganization — you try to up
grade and innovate. In pro loot
ball you have a little more time to
spend on that. Unfortunately. I
think sometimes we don't spend
enough time on that. You have a
little hit of success and you can
get a little complacent.
Jenkins: How much do you think
it affects a team to switch couches
so rapidly, as Stanford has done
in the last three years?
Wiggin: I would say that's not a
good thing to do to anyone. I
think that when you continually
change leadership, well, we're
dealing with a team concept,
well. I'm glad they changed one
more time to be honest with you.
But I would hope that I can be
here for a while, because I don't
think it's fair to the situation.
The neat part of recruiting was
that the name Stanford held up.
and the quality of what the name
represents held up, and it held up
through some very tough times
because in the chess play of re
cruiting you find that it's a ploy
that other schools use. They say
things like if Stanford is so i>ood

why do they keep changing
coaches. Actually it's a very
natural thing. Bill Walsh just
grew and grew and was great for
Stanlord and Stanford was great
tor him. Rod Dowhower for
some reason, something hap
pened, but what it came down to
was he chose to leave. It's
natural, but it's not good or sta
ble.
Jenkins: Do you think il is going
to have an effect on the people
you will he dealing with this sea
son?
Wiggin: We are going to try and
minimize the transitional shock
of this thing. One thing we are
going to try and do is continue to
use the same offensive terminol
ogy. When you have players like
Darrin Nelson and Ken
Margerum you don't want to
come in and change things if
what they were doing was work
ing. You want to stay with it. you
don't want to shoot the goose
that lays the golden eggs.
I think their reaction to me by
personality will be okay. I'm
banking on that. I can't say I
have a plan to deal with Stanford
athletes, but I haven't had a
problem with people before, so 1
think that will come very natur
ally. 1 feel good about it. I don't
think they will spend a lot of time
wondering where I am coming
from. I don't try to play games. I
don't pretend I'm Paul Brown or
Tom Landry. I'm Paul Wiggin
and I am going to roll the dice on
that basis.
Jenkins: What factors influenced
your decision to come here? Did
the fact that you went to school
here have anything to do with it?
Wiggin: It intluenced me a lot. In
evaluating my life, you look back
when you are 40. at least I did.
and try to evaluate where you are
and what you have done up to
that point — what was right, and
what was wrong. I think you
make three or four great deci
sions in your life and I think

Stanford was one of the great de
cisions I made.
In this situation everything
was right. Even though there was
a time in my life, when I went to
Kansas City to coach, when I
thought I had left it all behind,
the thought of ever coming back
was all behind and I was on a new
level. Up to that point I had al
ways had Stanford in the back of
my mind, the thought of coming
back here someday. It's always
been kind of a dream, though
there was that time when it kind
of diminished. But when this op
portunity came up it made sense.
There is a fear of the unknown
involved. When you're coaching
you would probably rather use
the word challenge instead of
fear, but legitimately it's fear. It's
scary. Right now I have to put
together a staff and we are going
to start spring practice in early
April and I don't even have a
staff. Somehow and someway it
will get done — we aren't just
going to play touch football.
That, believe me, represents a
little bit of the unknown and a
little bit of fear.
Jenkins: How are yon going to
deal with the Stanford syndrome,
the thought that the team rises to
the occasion hut doesn 't play well
against teams they are supposed
to heat?
Wiggin: It does seem that they
can rise higher than anyone, and
dive lower. I'm not sure how to
deal with it. I just hope that we
will be good enough to overcome
it.and I think that comes from
motivational factors.
I don't know that it's a syn
drome. You have to believe that
you can play the same way
against everybody. I hope we can
continue to climb the mountains
that Stanford has been able to
climb over the years. They have
had some great victories. But I
just hope we can stay out of the
valley a little more.

Kcllv Asplund (above) and Barbara Major should get some
competition in the 100 and 200 yard freestyle events from
Karen Rempal of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in the
Stanford Invitational meet, held at deGuerre Pool tomorrow
and Sunday.
Paul Wiggin, who started out
playing for Stanford in the '50s
and now returns us its head coach
in the '80s, faces a coach's night
rtiare as he reestablishes himself
on the Farm. The team he is to
coach has seen three coaches in
four years and a number of set
backs. The program doesn 't even
have a set group of assistant
coaches. But the team lias also
done some great things in those
four years and has grown a lot.
That should ease the transition.
Wiggin's haircut suggests an
Army seargent, but that is only
reinforced by his vigor, not his
attitude. He is glad to be back. In

considered, an outstanding re
cruiting year. And I say that, not
patting myself 011 the back, be
cause I really had very little to do
with it. Doug Single coordinated
it. Ray Handley from the staff
standpoint was involved in the
coordinating. From the coaches

point of view Jim Fassil and
Brian Shaw were the people who
really did the work.
All 1 did was come in and meet
families and meet kids and from
my standpoint really sell Stan
ford from a couple of decades
ago. My departure from Stan
ford had really been as a profes
sional player and then as a coach.
The neat part for me
recruiting-wise was the fact that
the only thing I really knew was
Stanford, so my sales pitch or
whatever you want to call it was
based on just the positive things I
knew about the University and it
was neat that all the things that 1
believed in 25 years ago still
exist: the excellence in
academics and athletics, things
like that. Based on everything 1
know about your people, I think
we had an exceptional year. We
reinforced our team in two criti
cal areas, offensive and defen
sive linemen.
Ours has been a team based on

skill, we have always had the
great quarterbacks and receivers
and runningbacks and I think a
year from now we are going to
have to look in those areas. We
will lose Ken Margerum, and we
want to keep that skill level up.
We did not reinforce our receiv
ing corps, or our quarterbacks,
which will hurt us a little bit. So 1
would just say that the fact we
brought the caliber of our secon
dary and defensive backs up to a
higher plane and our lines, shows
that we did an outstanding job.
Jenkins: What kind of adjust
ments have you had to make, or
are you going to have to make
going from coaching pro hall to
coaching Stanford?
Wigjjin: Football is football basi
cally, and that part of it stands
up. Our concept of football is
very close to the pro's and some
times even more complex and I
think that's attributable to the
quality of the intellect of the
Stanford athlete.
I think the thing you're going
to find is that we are dealing with
kind of a cycle. The first cycle
would certainly he football itsell
during the season. The next one
would be recruiting, and the next
one would be spring practice. It's
a little bit different; il I were still
at New Orleans right now, loot
ball season, which would be a 20
game schedule, would be a much
more intensified thing for a
longer period ol time. Here it's
an I 1 game season with maybe a
bowl game at the end as the frost
ing on the cake. That's the main
difference. It's an endurance
thing for the coach. You must
stay with it when you really want
to say hey, this is enough, and at
that point you have seven or
eight more games to go. In col
lege it's a more natural season.
Then the off season is the
reorganization — you try to up
grade and innovate. In pro loot
ball you have a little more time to
spend on that. Unfortunately. I
think sometimes we don't spend
enough time on that. You have a
little hit of success and you can
get a little complacent.
Jenkins: How much do you think
it affects a team to switch couches
so rapidly, as Stanford has done
in the last three years?
Wiggin: I would say that's not a
good thing to do to anyone. I
think that when you continually
change leadership, well, we're
dealing with a team concept,
well. I'm glad they changed one
more time to be honest with you.
But I would hope that I can be
here for a while, because I don't
think it's fair to the situation.
The neat part of recruiting was
that the name Stanford held up.
and the quality of what the name
represents held up, and it held up
through some very tough times
because in the chess play of re
cruiting you find that it's a ploy
that other schools use. They say
things like if Stanford is so i>ood

why do they keep changing
coaches. Actually it's a very
natural thing. Bill Walsh just
grew and grew and was great for
Stanlord and Stanford was great
tor him. Rod Dowhower for
some reason, something hap
pened, but what it came down to
was he chose to leave. It's
natural, but it's not good or sta
ble.
Jenkins: Do you think il is going
to have an effect on the people
you will he dealing with this sea
son?
Wiggin: We are going to try and
minimize the transitional shock
of this thing. One thing we are
going to try and do is continue to
use the same offensive terminol
ogy. When you have players like
Darrin Nelson and Ken
Margerum you don't want to
come in and change things if
what they were doing was work
ing. You want to stay with it. you
don't want to shoot the goose
that lays the golden eggs.
I think their reaction to me by
personality will be okay. I'm
banking on that. I can't say I
have a plan to deal with Stanford
athletes, but I haven't had a
problem with people before, so 1
think that will come very natur
ally. 1 feel good about it. I don't
think they will spend a lot of time
wondering where I am coming
from. I don't try to play games. I
don't pretend I'm Paul Brown or
Tom Landry. I'm Paul Wiggin
and I am going to roll the dice on
that basis.
Jenkins: What factors influenced
your decision to come here? Did
the fact that you went to school
here have anything to do with it?
Wiggin: It intluenced me a lot. In
evaluating my life, you look back
when you are 40. at least I did.
and try to evaluate where you are
and what you have done up to
that point — what was right, and
what was wrong. I think you
make three or four great deci
sions in your life and I think

Stanford was one of the great de
cisions I made.
In this situation everything
was right. Even though there was
a time in my life, when I went to
Kansas City to coach, when I
thought I had left it all behind,
the thought of ever coming back
was all behind and I was on a new
level. Up to that point I had al
ways had Stanford in the back of
my mind, the thought of coming
back here someday. It's always
been kind of a dream, though
there was that time when it kind
of diminished. But when this op
portunity came up it made sense.
There is a fear of the unknown
involved. When you're coaching
you would probably rather use
the word challenge instead of
fear, but legitimately it's fear. It's
scary. Right now I have to put
together a staff and we are going
to start spring practice in early
April and I don't even have a
staff. Somehow and someway it
will get done — we aren't just
going to play touch football.
That, believe me, represents a
little bit of the unknown and a
little bit of fear.
Jenkins: How are yon going to
deal with the Stanford syndrome,
the thought that the team rises to
the occasion hut doesn 't play well
against teams they are supposed
to heat?
Wiggin: It does seem that they
can rise higher than anyone, and
dive lower. I'm not sure how to
deal with it. I just hope that we
will be good enough to overcome
it.and I think that comes from
motivational factors.
I don't know that it's a syn
drome. You have to believe that
you can play the same way
against everybody. I hope we can
continue to climb the mountains
that Stanford has been able to
climb over the years. They have
had some great victories. But I
just hope we can stay out of the
valley a little more.

Kcllv Asplund (above) and Barbara Major should get some
competition in the 100 and 200 yard freestyle events from
Karen Rempal of the University of Nevada-Las Vegas in the
Stanford Invitational meet, held at deGuerre Pool tomorrow
and Sunday.
Paul Wiggin, who started out
playing for Stanford in the '50s
and now returns us its head coach
in the '80s, faces a coach's night
rtiare as he reestablishes himself
on the Farm. The team he is to
coach has seen three coaches in
four years and a number of set
backs. The program doesn 't even
have a set group of assistant
coaches. But the team lias also
done some great things in those
four years and has grown a lot.
That should ease the transition.
Wiggin's haircut suggests an
Army seargent, but that is only
reinforced by his vigor, not his
attitude. He is glad to be back. In
this Friday Interview with Sally
Jenkins, Wiggin explains what it's
like.
Jenkins: How do you think the
recruiting effort went? Are you
happy with what you got?
Wiggin: I think it was well done
in the sense of all the things being
considered. I think someone
ranked us as tied for ninth in the

nation. It's difficult for mc to
rank this young player against
apother just off the top of my
head because I came in in the
midst of all of it and did not get a
chance to look at film, did not get
a chance to say this player is bet
ter than that player, where does
he rank and how does he lit na
tionally. We are dealing a little
bit differently at Stanford be
cause it's a scholar-athlete that
we are looking at. so a lot of
weeding out goes at that level.
There are players we would like
to have that we can't even deal
with, because you know you are
going to get cut off at the admis
sions office anyway.
So what we had was, all things
considered, an outstanding re
cruiting year. And I say that, not
