# Coach Wiggin discusses recruiting
## 
### 
Paul Wiggin, who started out
playing for Stanford in the '50s
and now returns us its head coach
in the '80s, faces a coach's night
rtiare as he reestablishes himself
on the Farm. The team he is to
coach has seen three coaches in
four years and a number of set
backs. The program doesn 't even
have a set group of assistant
coaches. But the team lias also
done some great things in those
four years and has grown a lot.
That should ease the transition.
Wiggin's haircut suggests an
Army seargent, but that is only
reinforced by his vigor, not his
attitude. He is glad to be back. In
this Friday Interview with Sally
Jenkins, Wiggin explains what it's
like.
Jenkins: How do you think the
recruiting effort went? Are you
happy with what you got?
Wiggin: I think it was well done
in the sense of all the things being
considered. I think someone
ranked us as tied for ninth in the

nation. It's difficult for mc to
rank this young player against
apother just off the top of my
head because I came in in the
midst of all of it and did not get a
chance to look at film, did not get
a chance to say this player is bet
ter than that player, where does
he rank and how does he lit na
tionally. We are dealing a little
bit differently at Stanford be
cause it's a scholar-athlete that
we are looking at. so a lot of
weeding out goes at that level.
There are players we would like
to have that we can't even deal
with, because you know you are
going to get cut off at the admis
sions office anyway.
So what we had was, all things
considered, an outstanding re
cruiting year. And I say that, not
patting myself 011 the back, be
cause I really had very little to do
with it. Doug Single coordinated
it. Ray Handley from the staff
standpoint was involved in the
coordinating. From the coaches

point of view Jim Fassil and
Brian Shaw were the people who
really did the work.
All 1 did was come in and meet
families and meet kids and from
my standpoint really sell Stan
ford from a couple of decades
ago. My departure from Stan
ford had really been as a profes
sional player and then as a coach.
The neat part for me
recruiting-wise was the fact that
the only thing I really knew was
Stanford, so my sales pitch or
whatever you want to call it was
based on just the positive things I
knew about the University and it
was neat that all the things that 1
believed in 25 years ago still
exist: the excellence in
academics and athletics, things
like that. Based on everything 1
know about your people, I think
we had an exceptional year. We
reinforced our team in two criti
cal areas, offensive and defen
sive linemen.
Ours has been a team based on

skill, we have always had the
great quarterbacks and receivers
and runningbacks and I think a
year from now we are going to
have to look in those areas. We
will lose Ken Margerum, and we
want to keep that skill level up.
We did not reinforce our receiv
ing corps, or our quarterbacks,
which will hurt us a little bit. So 1
would just say that the fact we
brought the caliber of our secon
dary and defensive backs up to a
higher plane and our lines, shows
that we did an outstanding job.
Jenkins: What kind of adjust
ments have you had to make, or
are you going to have to make
going from coaching pro hall to
coaching Stanford?
Wigjjin: Football is football basi
cally, and that part of it stands
up. Our concept of football is
very close to the pro's and some
times even more complex and I
think that's attributable to the
quality of the intellect of the
