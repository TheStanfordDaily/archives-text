# Dons halt Card playoff drive
## 
### Richard Martinez Sports Editor 
Stanford's women's basketball
team had its season — and
playoff hopes — terminated last
night as the University of San
Francisco downed the Cards,
67-56, in a game much closer
than the score indicates.
The Lady Dons, who are first
in the Northern California Ath
letic Conference and ranked
No. 12 in the nation, lived up
to their reputation. They played
a solid defensive game, domi
nated underneath offensively,
and refused to buckle under
pressure when Stanford made a
run at them.
The last time the two clubs
met, San Francisco not only
dominated the game, it held
Jeanne Ruark well below her
22-point season average. Ruark
had only four points and USF
won by 21.
Last night's game was entirely
different from their earlier meet
ing. The first half of the initial
period was played closely and
with little scoring. The score read
12-10 San Francisco with 10 mi
nutes remaining in the first half.
The Lady Dons upped the lead
to 18-12 but a determined Stan
ford squad fought back to tie the
score at 20 with five minutes to
go.
As happened all evening, USF
pulled ahead, Stanford caught up,
and San Francisco ran off again.
With two minutes remaining
in the half, the Cards were on the
low end of a tight 27-26 score.
Two consecutive Cardinal tur

novers and a San Francisco bas
ket at the buz/er put USF ahead
by three for intermission, 3 1-2 K.
Ruark refused to be shut down
thisgame as she led the scoring at
halftime with 12 points.
The Lady Dons jumped to a
five-point lead at the opening of
the second half but Stanford tied
the score at 33 on an Ann Miller
basket and a three-point play by
Kim Kupferer following a beaut
iful pass from Paccione with
three minutes expired.
The next 10 minutes saw both
teams playing cat-and-mouse. A
Stanford rally then a USF surge
kept the lead see-sawing back
and forth, t he score was tied five
times during that time span.
With the score tied at 44 with
nine minutes remaining, Stan
ford switched to a man-on-man
defense. Despite this aggressive
strategy. USI- climbed back into
a lead it would never again relin
quish.
The lead was increased to six,
55-49, with just over five mi
nutes remaining and it was nerv
ous time at Maples. Another
Kupferer three-point with 3:30
remaining cut the lead to 57-54
and it looked as if Stanford might
pull off an upset.
Crucial turnovers then began
to haunt the Cards. Unable to
take advantage of USI- mistakes,
Stanford bumbled the ball right
back to its opponents.
Three points behind with 2:15
remaining, the Cards still were
within striking range. But the
combination of Cardinal errors
and San Francisco poise kept the

Lady Dons' lead intact. Six
straight freethrows gave USF its
1 I -point victory.
Stanford, suffering its first
home defeat of the season,
ended its year with 17-13 overall
and 7-5 league record. Posses
sing all the talent to equal their
opponents, the Cards seem to
lack just a bit of poise, confi
dence and aggressiveness of a
league-leading team. Stanford is
not losing a single player, how
ever. and there is much time for
development.

won by 21.
Last night's game was entirely
different from their earlier meet
ing. The first half of the initial
period was played closely and
with little scoring. The score read
12-10 San Francisco with 10 mi
nutes remaining in the first half.
The Lady Dons upped the lead
to 18-12 but a determined Stan
ford squad fought back to tie the
score at 20 with five minutes to
go.
As happened all evening, USF
pulled ahead, Stanford caught up,
and San Francisco ran off again.
With two minutes remaining
in the half, the Cards were on the
low end of a tight 27-26 score.
Two consecutive Cardinal tur

novers and a San Francisco bas
ket at the buz/er put USF ahead
by three for intermission, 3 1-2 K.
Ruark refused to be shut down
thisgame as she led the scoring at
halftime with 12 points.
The Lady Dons jumped to a
five-point lead at the opening of
the second half but Stanford tied
the score at 33 on an Ann Miller
basket and a three-point play by
Kim Kupferer following a beaut
iful pass from Paccione with
three minutes expired.
The next 10 minutes saw both
teams playing cat-and-mouse. A
Stanford rally then a USF surge
kept the lead see-sawing back
and forth, t he score was tied five
times during that time span.
With the score tied at 44 with
nine minutes remaining, Stan
ford switched to a man-on-man
defense. Despite this aggressive
strategy. USI- climbed back into
a lead it would never again relin
quish.
The lead was increased to six,
55-49, with just over five mi
nutes remaining and it was nerv
ous time at Maples. Another
Kupferer three-point with 3:30
remaining cut the lead to 57-54
and it looked as if Stanford might
pull off an upset.
Crucial turnovers then began
to haunt the Cards. Unable to
take advantage of USI- mistakes,
Stanford bumbled the ball right
back to its opponents.
Three points behind with 2:15
remaining, the Cards still were
within striking range. But the
combination of Cardinal errors
and San Francisco poise kept the

Lady Dons' lead intact. Six
straight freethrows gave USF its
1 I -point victory.
Stanford, suffering its first
home defeat of the season,
ended its year with 17-13 overall
and 7-5 league record. Posses
sing all the talent to equal their
opponents, the Cards seem to
lack just a bit of poise, confi
dence and aggressiveness of a
league-leading team. Stanford is
not losing a single player, how
ever. and there is much time for
development.

postseason playoff competition with a 61-56 victory.
