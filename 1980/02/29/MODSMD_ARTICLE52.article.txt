### Edie Bogart Staff Writer 
The Stanford Cardinals whip
ped San Diego State yesterday
afternoon, N-1. bringing the sea
son's record to 3-0. coach Frank
Brennan feels good about the
women's tennis season so far.
"So far. so good," he com
mented after the match. The top
two players, Alycia Moulton and
Caryn Copland, were out yester
day: Moulton played in a profes
sional tournament in Atlanta.
Ga. and Copland is ill. Brennan
admitted he "felt a bit shakey
nbout this match" but is very
proud of'the way the\ played.
Among the singles matches.
Julia Leighton. Gail Chan, and
Lisa Gordon had especially dif
ficult opponents. All three con
centrated well and played "smart
tennis." according to Coach
Brennan. Leighton played a
quick retriever so she was forced
to stay back. Brennan com
mented. "It was a very tough
match â€” very close, and the only
thing to do was drop the ball
close to the net." Leighton ad
mitted the same about her
match. "She was too
steady . . . she ran everything
down so I had to drop shot a
lot ... it felt good to play,
though, and get the kinks out."
Lisa Gordon's match was

closer than Leighton's score
wise (3-6. t>-4. 7-5) but she also
played "smart tennis" according
to Brennan. "She cut down on
her own errors, forcing mistakes
from her opponent. She really
showed what she's made of."
Gordon felt less heroic about her
close match. "It was a little too
long. I really had ni hang in
there."
Freshman Judy Jordan, also
showed her talents in Thursday's
match against San Diego State.
She defeated her opponent 6-3.
6-3 and felt "pretty confident.
I'm improv ing a lot and I had to
be patient today and run her
from side to side to keep her
back." Jordan joined the team
after Tlianksgiv ing and is "defi
nitely the hardest working
member of the team." said coach
Brennan. "She improves each
match."
The Cards are ranked second
in the nation, and these first two
weeks of their season are "fairlv
easy.'' says Brennan. The team
will travel to Arizona next
weekend to play the Universitv
of Arizona and Arizona State.
Brennan expects a "good test''
from these matches. "We'll see
how the team squares away."
This year's team is young and
growing: two "veteran" juniors
and the remaining freshmen and

sophomores constitute the Car
dinals.
