Washington State's Don Collins
set a number of personal seoring
records last night as he led the
Cougars to a 71-5S upset win
over Arizona State in a Pacific
-10 Conference basketball show
down.
In addition, Collins and the
Cougars all but clinched an
NCAA post-season playoff invi
tation.
The loss knocked Arizona
State out of a first-place tie with
Oregon State in the Pac-10 and
left the Cougars with a chance to
tie Arizona State for the run
nerup position.
Arizona State was able to keep
pace with the Cougars for the
first four minutes of the game,
but Washington State built a
six-point lead before the half,
forcing the taller Sun De\ ils into
a man-to-man defense. Arizona
State then had to foul late in the
game in an attempt to get back in
the contest.
The Cougars held Kurt Nim
phius. the Pac-10's fifth leading
scorer, to nine points, and
freshman guard Byron Scott,
who scored 31 and 21 points in
his last two games to five points.
Collins led four Cougar
players in double figures with 2 1
points.
He set a new single season
scoring record for Washington
State and became only the third
player in conference history to
score 1000 points or more in
league play.
Ron Lee of Oregon leads with
107S, Lou Alcindor (Kareem

Abdul-Jabbar) had 1050 and
Collins now has 1007.
Collins is also four points away
from setting a single season scor
ing record for conference games,
and should achieve that distinc
tion in the Cougars' season finale
tomorrow afternoon.
The win lifted Washington
State's season record to 21-5.
The Cougars are 13-4 in confer
ence play. Arizona State drop
ped to 20-6 overall and 14-3 in
the conference.
