# Men's net pairings at Pac Coast tourney
## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
The men's tennis team, rained
out of their Wednesday match
with Foothill, travels south this
weekend for some sunshine and
the 91st Pacific Coast Sectional
Doubles Championships at La
Jolla. Along with Stanford, the
tournament will include tennis
powers UCLA. USC, UC-
Berkeley and Pepperine. Stan
ford, UCLA and Cal are re
garded as the top three collegiate
teams in the country.
In the past two years, the
championships have been domi
nated by Stanford teams. In
197H John McEnroe and Bill
Maze defeated Matt Mitchell
and Perry Wright in an all Stan
lord final and last year Peter Rc
nnert and Lloyd Bourne beat
C al s Marty Davis and Chris
"Slam" Dunk to take the tour
nament.
This year coach Dick Gould is
sending down three teams to the
championships — Rennert-
Bourne, Tim Mayotte-Jeff
Arons and Scot Bondurant-Jim
Gurfein. Gurfein is replacing
Dave Sieger, Stanford's standout
treshman, who is still recovering
from the flu. Rennert-Bourne,
Stanford's top team, is seeded
third and Mayotte-Arons is

seeded number eight.
Gould seemed pleased to have
his team get some needed doubles
competition. As he pointed out,
"So far this year we haven't
exactly set the courts on fire with
our doubles play and this will be
an excellent chance to focus on
just the doubles. The pressure is
not sd strong this weekend be
cause no team standings are kept
so it will be a good chance to
simply get some needed work on
our games."
I lie complete seedings for the
tournament in order are: UC-
I.A s Dick Met/-Blaine Willen
borg; Cal's Davis-Dunk; Stan
lord's Rennert-Bourne; inde
pendents Tom Leonard-Jerry
Van Linge; USCs Robert Van't
Hot-Doug Adler; Pepperdine's
Eddie Edwards-Rolando Vas
quez; UCLA's Mike
Harrington-Marcel Freeman
and Stanford's Mayotte-Arons.
Play will begin today with two
rounds. The semifinals and finals
will be on Sunday. Matches will
be played at the La Jolla Beach
and Tennis Club.
Stanford will complete the
rained out match with Foothill
College on Thursday at the var
sity courts starting at 2:30. The
Cards were leading in the match
2-0 when rain halted play.
