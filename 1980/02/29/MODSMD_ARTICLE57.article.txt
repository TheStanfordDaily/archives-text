### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
The women's swim team hosts
seven collegiate teams for the
Stanford Invitational today, to
morrow and Sunday at deGuerre
Pool.
For the Cards, "the meet is re
ally important," according to
coach Claudia Thomas, because
it will be their last chance to qual
ify for the AI AW national
championships held over finals
week.
So far, 12 of the Cardinals' 19
swimmers have qualified for the
national competition, and"I
fully expect to pick up at least
four more" qualifiers at this
meet, Thomas said. Should 16
Cards actually match the stan
dard times, it would be the
largest Stanford squad to ever at
tend the AIAWs, she noted.
Diver Lisa Mariani has also
qualified for the nationals.

"Although a good percentage
of the team lias already qualified,
many who have qualified have
standards to meet in other
events," Thomas said.
The Cards are well-prepared,
as they have already begun their
taper (shorter workouts) for the
national meet. "I think everyone
will swim very well." Thomas
commented.
Even though the Cards are in
top form for this weekend, their
competition will not be as chal
lenging as in past Invitationals
because of the absence of South
ern California teams. Those
teams will be participating in
their conference match in the
south instead.
The abbreviated team roster
features Cal, San Jose State,
University of Pacific, Fresno
State, UC-Davis, University of
Hawaii and University of

Nevada at Las Vegas.
Freestyler Margie McFarland
and breaststroker Bridget Kress
are expected to perform well for
Cal. Karen Rempal of UNLV
has excellent times in the 100
and 200 yard freestyle events, ac
cording to Thomas, and could
push Card leaders Kelly Asplund
and Barbara Major. Eileen
Campbell of San Jose State is
also a solid breaststroker.
Among others, Cards Kim
Carlisle and Zena Herrmann will
be striving to clock qualifying
times in the I 00 yard backstroke,
as will Libby Beaudet in the 100
butterfly, the 400 individual
medley and the 100 IM, Laura
Raymond in the 500 freestyle
and Jeanne Barkey in the 50 and
100 fly.
Trial heats begin at 9:30 a.m.
all three days. Finals heats begin
at 2 p.m.
