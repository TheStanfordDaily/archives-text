The I.os Angeles Times
LOS ANGELES — The
Pacific 10 Conference's execu
tive director has instructed
member schools to make a sys
tematic search of all athletes'
academic transcripts, dating
back to 1977, for possible ir
regularities in the wake of disclo
sures that athletes at Pac-10
schools had received credit for
courses not taken.
In a memo to the 10 univer
sities. Wiles Ilallock listed 19
suspect junior colleges and in
stitutions that offer extension
courses.
The memo said that if member
schools found athletes had re
ceived credit from any of the I 9
institutions, "we suggest you
conduct an internal investigation
to determine it the credits were

properly earned and report the
results of your investigation to
the conference office."
Athletes on squads of four
Pac-10 schools — UCLA,
Arizona State, Oregon and Ore
gon State — have been found to
have tainted transcripts crediting
them with taking courses that
they never completed.
Ilallock said the memo was
sent to both athletic directors
and athletic faculty representa
tives at the Pac-10 schools.
They were instructed, he ad
ded, to check the transcripts of
athletes involved in minoras well
as major sports programs.
He declined to name the 19
schools listed in the memo, but
said they were institutions iden
tified in recent months in an on
going series of intercollegiate
athletic scandals. Me said they
were "ones which, for one
reason or another, we think
might be problems."
Prominent among these have
been Ottawa University of Kan
sas, Rocky Mountain College of
Idaho and Los Angeles Valley
College.
Forgeries from Valley College
turned up on three football
players' transcripts at UCLA
and four at Oregon.
In addition, it was reported
last week that 34 athletes at USC
had been enrolled in a speech
course last fall that they did not
attend. Most were football
players.
A UCLA spokesman said yes
terday that the school had almost
completed a search back to 1977
of all athletes who had engaged
in "the revenue sports" — foot
ball and basketball — and would
soon embark on an examination
of transcripts of students who
engaged in track and field and
what are considered "the minor
sports."
