and voluminous work. While
llomc )do's. Indeed, there is
much to pi aise in this I 500-page
lirst volume ol his White House
memoirs. Yet this imposing woik
can't escape criticism, and even
invites it. especially in liglil ol
more recent developments m
I S lorcign all.ins.
rormer President Richard Ni
xon's choice ol Kissinger lor the
National Security Council post
was a recognition not only ol
Kissinger's abilities, but was also
a chance to tweak the nose ol the
I astern liberal establishment In
co-opting one ol its most promis
ing members. So began a love
hate relationship that would
change the shape ol Iv lorcign
policy lorcver.
Kissmgci clearly resented liav
ing to he dependent on N i\on loi
his power base, but lie also saw in
him a certain global allaiis
sophistication that held the op
portunity lor correcting many ol
the past I S lorcign policy lai
lures. I hey reasoned, and rightly
so. that the I nited States needed
to pursue a more fluid and com
prehensive lorcign policy
strategy, in tune more with tlie
complex international balance ol
power realities than the simplis
tic I rcc World Communist bipo
lai notions that led us into the
Vietnam war.
Such reasoning led to the
dramatic opening up ol China
and detente with the Sov iel I 11-

lon. which Kissingei loudly de
scribes as Ins most significant
achiev cmcnt llc and Nixon v eiy
correctly saw that the ultimate
morality in lorcign allairs was
the prevcntion ol superpower
nucleai conflict. I lie pursuit ol a
supposedly moral lorcign policy
in the name ol an outdated or
lust plain simplistic ideology (i.e.
"Ivltci dead than Red") was
thus not only unwise, but actu
ally immoral in the long-run.
What got Nixon and Kissing
er's foreign policy caught up
altei a time was the failure to

reali/e thill Mich moral strategic'
ends don't necessarik justih ain

as with the cases ol Chile aiul
Camhodui. kissmgei anil Nixon
tried to counter perceived
Communist thieats resorting to
cloak-and-daggei methods tlial
would ha\e ntiide Machiavclli

proud.
Kissinger also goes into great
detail describing the bureaucra
tic in-lighting that went 011 dur
ing he and Nixon's struggle to
gain control over the U.S.
foreign policy-making machin
ery. Here we find great insight
into the way real power is
gathered and used 111 our compli
cated political system, so much
so that these sections read almost
like a bible for the enthusiastic
International Relations or other
social science major interested 111
government policy-making. Kis
singer points out that he and
Nixon were very concerned,
again with good reason, that they
he able to dev clop a more unified
and focused decision-making
process through which to imple
ment their creative new lorcign
policy initiatives. I'he difficulty,
ol course, is that such a concent
ration of powci in one place as
Kissinger attained olten makes it
hard to gain the support ol the
otliei facets ol government that
have been ovcrrulcd.
Complicating these problems
w.is the almost obsessive desire
101 secrecy in the carrying 011 ol
the Nixon-Kissinger foreign pol
icy Numerous times Kissinger
delends the need for covert dip
lomacy and decision-making,
most succcssl ully when describ
ing the marvelously well-kept
secret ol his trip to China. Other
times, however, such clandes
tine means blew up in his face,
most notably when he tried to
present the "peace is at hand"
negotiated settlement between
the I Sand North Vietnam as a
I.ut accompli to the South Viet
namese. South Vietnam's Thieu

government, looking with great
distrust on a settlement it had not
been party to. refused to accept,
and this forced Nixon and Kis
singer into the infamous 1972
Christmas bombing ol Hanoi.
I'he very secrecy Kissingei
speaks of as so necessary for the
conduct of policy thus also lost
him legitimacy 111 U.S. public
opinion and consequently de
nied linn the use ill a powerful
political weapon in foreign pol
icy. In all fairness to Kissinger,
much ol this lost legitimacy was
the product ol Nixon's failures as
a domestic political leader.
These domestic difficulties. Kis
singer observes, had the effect ol
poisoning Nixon's foreign policy,
especially when they culminated
111 the disastrous Watergate af
fair.
Hut Kissinger's theatrical dip
lomacy was also at fault for
dangerously raising public ex
pectations. As the sc 11 -
appointed imperial court wizard
111 foreign affairs lor the Nixon
administration. Kissinger daz
zled the public with his sophisti
cated style and spectacular suc
cesses in China and the Soviet
I nion. I'he problem 111 this
country's political system is that
people become distinctly uneasy
with the uncertainty ol magic in
government. While they may put
up with not knowing how the
tricks arc performed as long as
they are successful, when some
ol the rabbits being pulled out of
the foreign policy hat start com
ing out toads, warts and all. all
hell breaks loose.
And toads there are. But Kis
sinuer doesn't no out ol his wav

to point them out and. indeed,
even tries to gloss over sonic with
rather disingenuous explana
tions ol geopolitical necessity.
As lor the Chile affair, lie inno
cently contends that Salvador
Allcnde had come to power by
way ol an institutional fluke,
with less than a majority vote,
and that ex-president and demo
crat I'duardo I rei Montalva
would have won 1 lie vote il lie
had been allowed to seek
another term by Chile's constitu
tion. I liis is used as justification
lor a badly-bungled intervention
by the CIA.
What Kissinger doesn't say is
that I rei hinisell refused to go
along with the U.S. plan to get
hi 111 re-elected because he and
most ol Chile's population felt
Allcnde a worthy candidate who
should be given a chance at
power. Kissinger, who couldn't
have known more than I rei
about Allcnde's reputation, con
sidered Allcnde a dyed-in-the
wool radical and did everything
lie could to later polarize Chilean
public opinion. II Kissinger had
other, more global reasons lor
making such an assessment, he
certainly doesn't reveal them
here.
Another example is his undy
ing praise for the shall ol Iran,
whom he praised as the wise and
benevolent leader of a nation
with a long authoritarian herit
age. Kissinger tails to point out
that the Socialist government the
CIA overthrew in 1953 to put
the shah back 011 Ins throne was
popularly elected and that the
more recent revolution occurred
because even Iran's educated
middle class saw him and his

SAVAK secret police as some
thing less than wise and benevo
lent.
Anyone can make a mistake or
two. and sonic of these can be
excused for their role in the also
important U.S.-Soviet struggle,
which Kissinger undeniably is a
master of. But these failures also

ning lor office, which is not too
lur from the truth. As the domin
ant foreign policy-maker under
the Nixon and l ord administra
tions he was a man who did
things lor their ellect. in the long
run and globally. Phis is still the
case.
