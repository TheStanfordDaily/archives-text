point to a consistent willingness
011 Kissinger's part to treat Third
World nations as pawns 111 this
global struggle, and even to
make pawns out ol those that
weren't already such. Although
he is able to recognize that
communism 111 China and the
So\ ict Union isn't monolithically
evil and can be moderated, he
curiously tails to understand the
reason for its appeal in the Third
World. By assuming that the in
ternational status quo needs and
deserves to he kept intact, while
most ol the Third World has
legitimate need for its change,
Kissinger's foreign policy invites
the kindol convulsive instability
seen in the recent Iran and Ango
lan revolutions. It also fails to
recognize the opportunity for the
U.S. to score points morally and
111 its global competition by sup
porting and moderating these
llurd World needs, as we are
currently trying to do 111
Nicaragua and may in the future
with Iran.
Kissinger himself may very
well be aware of these criticisms,
but these memoirs obviously
aren't the place lor Ins exposition
ol them. He presents instead a
very long. elegant and
thoroughly knowledgeable de

suggest that Kissinger had
hoped, by rushing his memoirs
out, to position himself for a
chance to assume high-level
foreign policy making should a
Republican win the presidential
election in November. There has
also been talk ol his advising
Ronald Reagan on foreign policy
matters. If this has any truth in it.
his memoirs have certainly re
established publicly his creden
tials as one of the leading experts
in foreign policy in the country, if
anyone ever had any doubt. It
also helps to explain the some
what self-serving anil defensive
slant the memoirs take, and why
he doesn't go too lar into outlin
ing the "grand design" lie almost
surely lias behind his various pol
icy approaches.
I here remains the question ol
whether the values and morality
behind this grand design match
the more general breadth ol Ins
expertise in foreign affairs. Then
there is also Ins second volume
and, il for 110 other reason than
this, one almost hopes his im
mediate government ambitions
are less than successful. A man
with as much to say as Henry
Kissinger should be left unlet

at least for a while.
