Chapter Two itit
Menlo C inema, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, they marry, they have
problems, they resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one
liners and even a moment here or
there that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-good self.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles but the movie's worth
a tree night (if any of us ever had
one). A good one for Mom and
Dad.

Cruising
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
Writer-director William Fried
kin hasalwaysdealt in cheapthrills,
but he's never made a movie as
ugly, discordant, sloppily made,
poorly thought-out and morally
bankrupt as this one. Depending
on your mood, Friedkin's depiction
of homosexual life is akin to either
how blacks were treated on slave
ships or Milton's description of
hell. It's an utterly insensitive por
trait of a world Friedkin doesn't
even attempt to understand. And
f-riedkin's idea of what constitutes
goodness — that is, a heterosexual
relationship — is so stupidly and
sketchily presented that even it is
lifeless. Most pornographically vio
lent movies (for example. Midnight
Express) develop a relentless in
evitability that some people re
spond to; but Cruising is so badly
paced and ineffectually acted (by
Al Pacino, among others) that sit
ting in front of a rock for two hours
will probably evoke a more positive
emotional response.

Paths of Gloryitififit
Monday, Cubberley 7 p.m.
Working with power and effec
tiveness in a documentary style, di
rector Stanley Kubrick's anti-war
movie is one of the classics of the
genre. It's a simple tale, perhaps
too simple, but Kubrick gives the
movie a compelling sense of
urgency. Starring Kirk Douglas.
— R.L.
Apocalypse Sow it if it it
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness , he employs Conrad's es
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images of
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor.

sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It'sa journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this "impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.
— R.L..
Dr. Strangelove ★★★★
Saturday, New Varsity
I love this movie, yet it's the kind
of tilm that makes you question
your emotions (and perhaps even
doubt your sanity). Strangelove
exploits your reactions in obviously
threatening ways; just why do we
laugh so hard at the notion of com
plete destruction?
Director Stanley Kubrick's orig
inal conception of Strangelove was
for it to be serious drama, but he
found that he couldn't take the idea
of planned holocaust seriously.
Kubrick realizes that even though
the movie brings us face to face with
fiery, horrible death, some of us, in
the end, will still want to ride that
missile with Slim Pickens. It's black
humor that's truly chilling, and it
hits you hard afterward. Peter Sel
lers is amazing in multiple roles; his
Kissinger and Werner Von Braun
inspired scientist-adviser is
frighteningly funny.
— R.L.
Breaking Away ***
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his talent
on a bicycle. Nominated for a Best
Picture Oscar.
— Mike Kohn
Swept Away by an Unusual De
stiny on the Blue Sea in August
itir
Sunday-Monday, New Varsity
Director Lina Wertmuller is at
her most strident here with this
screechy, enormously obvious tale
of a rich capitalistic woman who is
shipwrecked on a desert island with
an embittered, socialistic sailor.
Neither of the characters is well
enough defined to hold our atten
tion for the seemingly interminable
amount of time they're on screen.
You might be able to get some ple
asure out of the lovely tropical
scenery, but that's scarcely enough
to make this tract on social Dar
winism bearable.
— Jim Mattson

And Justice For All ★
Saturday, New Varsity
About 10 years ago, this movie
would have made a great TV pilot
film, and that's probably the best
that can be said for it. Lots of the
"can the honest, crusading lawyer
keep his integrity in the ugly, dog
eat-dog world of criminals, dirty at
torneys and dishonest judges?"
type conflict. Norman Jewison,
who should know better, directs
the shallow dramatics and cheap
comedy in the script with an em
barrassing earnestness. Al Pacino
has never seemed so ordinary; by
sheer force of will, he's interesting,
but the biggest question this movie
may leave you with is "will Al
Pacino be successful in his bid for a
weekly series?" Pacino must be

more ambitious than that.
— R.L.
Girlfriends ★★★
Tuesday-Wednesday, New Varsity
ClaudiaWeill directed tjiis movie
about a woman who finds success
and love by discovering that she is
the only one who can make them
happen. Girlfriends is a warm, very
good natured feminist film, full of
quiet insights and what Francois
Truffaut would describe as
"privileged moments:" episodes
which relate less to the plot than to
the meaning of the movie as a
whole. Interestingly, while the
female characters are unusually
well developed, the male charac
ters are cardboard plot-movers —

quite a twist on the outlook of the
ordinary film. Melanie Mayronand
Alice Skinner star.
— R.L.
Saturn
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read
"something is wrong on Saturn 3."
They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion ol
Demon Seed. but the result is two
boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis
tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter
tainment here, folks. Unless watch
ing animals being crushed and
people being dismembered is your

type of trip, plan a vacation some
where else.

American Gigolo
Bijou. Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it, Schrader's
voyeurisn: borders on obsession;
he's so wr.pped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have
much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience feel more like
peeping toms than vital particip-

Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a lire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on ,hkl this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateui ish end
ing, Gere is convicted ol a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden ru>h of images,
Schradcr lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
L.auren Hutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.
Lawrence of Arabia ★★★ it
Sunday, Mein Aud 9 p.m.
The epic of epics. The dwindling
'60s audiences caused many
studios to seek the "big movie" to
pull them away from their televi-

sion sets, but LOA is different in
that it is intelligently made as well
as spectacular. Peter O'Toole and
the desert have never looked bet
ter. Directed by David Lean.
—Dana Polan
Kramer rv. Kramer ■kit +
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is tor the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart. Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffaut
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for

his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
t Meryl Strcep)? I ler case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, hut instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.L.
Going in Style ★★★
Palo Alto Square
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified. George
Burns. Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut.
2K-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; after that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.
Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
you to be effective.
— R.L.
I he Rose ★
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
of A Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1%9 setting
and centered on a character vag
uel> based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie makes only three references
to '69, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates. Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.
— R.L.

1941 ★★★
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion'for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of \isual comedy. 1941 is the
strongest effort in years Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-rcelcr. J941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too-
Irequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, trenzied comic action may he
horribly out of place now
Despite alI that, I like this movie
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Aykroyd. Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwcll. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— K.L
Phantom of the Paradise ★★★
Thursday, New Varsity
Director Brian DePalma's mov ie
is an entertaining mess that seems
likely to self-destruct at any time
At first glance, this movie is an ex
tremely broad parody of The f'han
tom of the Opera; with your next
glance it's a parody of the whole
music business; before long, it
turns into a big parody ot itself.
DePalma's humor and style
triumph throughout. Starring Paul
Williams.
— R.L
Electric Horseman ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Almost constructed as the \ isual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
•The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Rcdford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a SI 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse tree. Of
course. Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially.
Redford's. are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.


James Caan and Marsha Mason star in Chapter Two, the latest product from the Neil
Simon corporation.
