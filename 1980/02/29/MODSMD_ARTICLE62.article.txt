and agreed it was time to forget the incident and go on with
the campaign.
Joining front-runner Ronald Reagan in the debate were
George Bush ol Texas. Sen. Howard Baker of Tennessee
and former Texas Gov. John Connally.
In their first verbal joust since Reagan's landslide victory
in New Hampshire, the GOP candidates debated at the
University ol South Carolina in advance ol the state's
March S Republican primary election.
The mood was remarkably friendly, contrary to sonic
expectations that the three candidates who ran behind
Reagan in New llampshiie would concentrate their fire on
the front-runnei
barly in the debate, the discussion turned to last
weekend schaotic forum in Nashua, where four Republican
candidates were excluded before Reagan and Bush went
one-on-onc.
"I'm not ordinarily an angry man. but I was angry that
night." said Baker, one ol those excluded from the debate.
Much ol last night's debate dealt with political strategy.
Each ol the hopefuls bid for South Carolina's sizeable
black vote, each citing his record on civil rights.

Efforts to arrange a commission meeting with the Ameri

It was feared the approximately 50 Americans, who have
been captive in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran for I 17 days,

said it might take that long for the as-yet-unformed Parlia

On Us lifth lull day in Iran the I N. panel visited the
ousted shah's main residence, then toured F.vin prison
where thousands allegedly were tortured by SAX AK. the
shah's secret police, before the monarch was forced from
the throne in last year's Islamic revolution.
A report from the commission, released at the United
Nations, said the members went through a crowd ol 1200
alleged victims and examined individual cases of obvious
physical mutilation.
"Co-chairman Mohamed spoke to the \ ietims.

NRC ends licensing moratorium
WASHINGTON —The Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion voted yesterday to issue a license for testing ol a new
nuclear power plant 111 Tennessee, ending .1 self-imposed
moratorium in effect since the Three Mile Island accident
nearly a year ago.
I lie NRC said it would allow nuclear fuel to be loaded
into the reactor at the Tennessee Valley Authority's
Sequoyah power plant near Chattanooga. I enn. I he com
missioners gave stall experts authority to decide w hen to let
the company conduct low-power generating tests at the
plant.
In authori/ing the license for the Sequoyah plant, the
NRC opened the door to granting permission for several
other completed plants to go on line. Many of the plants
have been operational, but have not been allowed to gener
ate power until the government investigations ol the I'll ree
Mile Island accident were completed and new safety proce
dures initiated.
1 lie decision to permit the fuel loading operation at the
Sequoyah plant came several hours after NRC Chairman
John Ahearne said he did not expect Tuesday's nuclear
plant accident in l londa to require a shutdown ol other
reactors by the same designer.
I lowever. Ahearne told a Senate subcommittee he won't
make a linal decision until after he receives a lull report on
the Florida incident, which he said he expects next Tuesday.
