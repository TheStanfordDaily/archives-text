An article in yesterday's Daily classified Marjk Agnew ol
the Stanford Students for Kennedy as a sophomore rather
than a junior. Also, lie contacted nearly 700 voters in New
Hampshire, not 6700 as the article stated.
Yesterday, the Daily incorrectly called Jim McCirath a
professor of computer science. McGrath is actually a junior
majoring in mathematical sciences.
In Wednesday's Daily, assistant director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center Sidney Drell was quoted as say
ing that he feared for Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov's
possible execution. Instead, he expressed concern about the
effects ol Sakharov's recent harrassment and banishment
I rum Moscow on his trail health.
The Daily regrets the errors.
