# Campus parking fine may rise again

### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
Parking tines and parking stickcr tecs perhaps should go
higher in the immediate future. Chief of Police Services
Marvin Herrington has warned the University Committee
on Parking and Transportation.
I 'niversitv parking fines recently went up from $2 to $5,
Inrt Bob Mamrdla. chairman of the Committee on Parking
and Transportation, s;iid that Stanford will not see any of
the money from these fines.
"University money comes from parking sticker fees. Fine
money goes to the county," said Mamrdla
Parking Ices and tines go towards two areas, according to
liamrdla; the Marguerite and the enforcement of parking
law s.
'Delighted'
"We were delighted that the fines were raised recently
from $2 to $5. hut if it were our choice, fines would he $10
oi $20. I he fines help with enforcement. $2 was easy, but
$5 makes things a little bit harder," cxpalined Mamrdla.
I lowever, the money from parking stickerfees is what the
University uses for funding.
"We have not raised the price of'C permits for the past
three years. I ;ist year, we lowered the cost of A permits by
$10 because we abolished the B permit," explained
Mamrdla. "People have to realize this."
Likely
Adoption of increased fines and parking fees in the future
seems likely if the Committee on Parking and Transporta
tion recommends it. The committee, which makes recom
mendations to William Massw Vice-President lor Business

and Finance, has had all of its recommendations accepted
tor the past three years in toto.
Rut, Hamrdla noted, "We have made utterly no decision
thus far." The discussion will come up in committee in the
spring. 4
"It's an issue of convenience." said Hamrdla. "Parking
spaces are always available on campus. But none of us like
to park far away from where we're going. We want to
encourage people to walk or take the Marguerite," he ad
ded.
Alternatives
One alternative to raised fees that is heing considered by
the committee is the abolishing of one of the two Marguer
ite routes. "We must consider how viable the current two
route system really is," said Hamrdla.
Enforcement of parking regulations has always been a
problem. Almost 50,000 tickets are written here each year.
But. the problem lies in that many students ignore their
citations. Stanford police hope to upgrade the enforcement
of the citations in the near future.
"We can keep track of out-of-state ticketed cars," said
Stanford Police Captain Wullschleger. "After five tickets
we check with the court records, and we can tow the cars
away. This costs the student money."
California ticket abusers can also be followed up on, and
warrants can be issued to them.
Mopeds
One special area of concern tor the transportation com
mittee is the increased use of mopeds. I lamrdla encouraged
students to" Park it or pedal it, but don't ride it in pedestrian
areas."
