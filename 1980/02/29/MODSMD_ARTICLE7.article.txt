Evers, a 31-year-old Stanford
graduate, is currently the editor of In
quiry, a nationally circulated political
opinion magazine. He listed the central

issues in his campaign as the draft and
inflation.
The Libertarian party, which stands
for "individual liberty, personal re
sponsibility, tolerance and a live-and
let-live attitude," according to Evers'
campaign manager Colin Hunter, op
poses the draft on two counts.
Evers explained that in addition to
the draft's obvious infringement on in
di\ idiuil rights. Libertarian foreign pol
icy focuses only on defense of the Un
ited States and condemns intervention
in other parts of the world.
II the Defense Department's sole
purpose is to defend the United States,
the number of soldiers needed is re
duced. said Evers.
Evers also pointed out that salaries
are not high enough to attract people
into the armed services. According to
Hunter, enlistees only receive SO per
cent of the minimum wage.

Libertarians view the creation of
money as the source of inflation, and
thus the government, which creates
money, is responsible for and can con
trol inflation, according to Evers.
"Many tend to explain inflation as a
law of nature, but Libertarians have
analyzed it and think it is unfair and
illegal," Evers said.
Evers supports balancing the budget,
and also recommends deep tax cuts and
raising the income level for individuals
who do not have to pay taxes.
He opposes drug law s on the grounds
that "people ought to be able to ingest
whatever they want to in the way of
vitamins. supplements, pleasure drugs,
whatever. .
An advantage in supporting the
Libertarian Party is that it provides a
theory that is consistent with its stand
on all issues, Eveis said. It differs from
