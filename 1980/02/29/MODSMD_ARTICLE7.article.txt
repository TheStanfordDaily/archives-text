## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
Five candidates have announced
their intentions to challenge Rep. Pete
McCloskey (R-Menlo Park) for Ins
seat in the I louse of Representatives, a
position he has held for more than
twelve years.
Those who have announced their in
tention to run include Kirsten Olsen
and Marc Strassman on the Democra
tic ticket. Libertarian Bill Evers, Adele
Fumino for the Peace and Freedom
Party and Royce Cole on the Republi
can ticket.

(Second of two parts)

Evers, a 31-year-old Stanford
graduate, is currently the editor of In
quiry, a nationally circulated political
opinion magazine. He listed the central

issues in his campaign as the draft and
inflation.
The Libertarian party, which stands
for "individual liberty, personal re
sponsibility, tolerance and a live-and
let-live attitude," according to Evers'
campaign manager Colin Hunter, op
poses the draft on two counts.
Evers explained that in addition to
the draft's obvious infringement on in
di\ idiuil rights. Libertarian foreign pol
icy focuses only on defense of the Un
ited States and condemns intervention
in other parts of the world.
II the Defense Department's sole
purpose is to defend the United States,
the number of soldiers needed is re
duced. said Evers.
Evers also pointed out that salaries
are not high enough to attract people
into the armed services. According to
Hunter, enlistees only receive SO per
cent of the minimum wage.

Libertarians view the creation of
money as the source of inflation, and
thus the government, which creates
money, is responsible for and can con
trol inflation, according to Evers.
"Many tend to explain inflation as a
law of nature, but Libertarians have
analyzed it and think it is unfair and
illegal," Evers said.
Evers supports balancing the budget,
and also recommends deep tax cuts and
raising the income level for individuals
who do not have to pay taxes.
He opposes drug law s on the grounds
that "people ought to be able to ingest
whatever they want to in the way of
vitamins. supplements, pleasure drugs,
whatever. .
An advantage in supporting the
Libertarian Party is that it provides a
theory that is consistent with its stand
on all issues, Eveis said. It differs from

other parties in which the politicians
tend to sway with public opinion rather
than keeping in mind what is necessar
ily best or right, he added.
I umino. who opposed McCloskey in
the 1 1 '7S election, will be a representa
tive of the Peace and I reedom Partv
which defines itsell as committed to
socialist democracy and feminism.
Though concerned with the draft is
sue. I umino's main focus will be on tax
reform. She said that the excessive em
phasis placed by our government on
the draft and registration issue has
been an attempt to shift attention from
the critical state ot our economy.
"There shpuld be a reduction in
military expenditures and a rechannel
ing ot money to social needs, focusing
primarily on the unemployment prob
lem," 1 umino said.
She does not support the tax-cutting
Proposition 13 or Jarvis II on the
grounds that "structural changes,
rather than simple tax cuts, are
needed."
Draft stance
I umino is not opposed to the draft
and registration on a theoretical basis,
maintaining that a just society has the
right toexpect support from its citizens.
"This particular call for registration,
however, is obviously an attempt to
turn our concerns from problems in our
country and focus them on outside con
cerns." I umino explained.
Cole will be challenging McCloskey

in the Republican primary lor the sec
ond time. He last opposed McCloskey
in 1962.
Cole identified the state ot the
economy and the draft question as the
hottest issues in the coming election.
Debt
Cole is concerned with "getting our
economic house in order," adding that
we have suffered from a drain on na
tional wealth through deficit spending
and the costs of energy.
"Due to our crushing debt, the
economy has become so unwieldly it
may not recover," Cole said.
Cole is opposed to the draft because
it is mi likely it will provide necessary
military forces, and because he consid
ers the Afghanistan situation an invalid
justification for the use of military
force.
"It this indeed were a valid reason
for military intervention, you couldn't
have kept the American people out of
the military," Cole said.
Cole also wanted to clarify his stand
on the abortion issue. He said over one
million abortions were performed in
the United States last year, and said
this displayed a disturbing attitude.
"I do no oppose free choice, but the
choice should be whether or not to get
pregnant and not whether or not to
have an abortion," Cole said.
As of yet, no other citi/ens have an
nounced their intentions to run in the
upcoming Congressional elections.
Deadline for filing papers is March 7.

issues in his campaign as the draft and
inflation.
The Libertarian party, which stands
for "individual liberty, personal re
sponsibility, tolerance and a live-and
let-live attitude," according to Evers'
campaign manager Colin Hunter, op
poses the draft on two counts.
Evers explained that in addition to
the draft's obvious infringement on in

in other parts of the world.

the number of soldiers needed is re
duced. said Evers.
Evers also pointed out that salaries
are not high enough to attract people
into the armed services. According to
Hunter, enlistees only receive SO per
cent of the minimum wage.

Libertarians view the creation of
money as the source of inflation, and
thus the government, which creates
money, is responsible for and can con
trol inflation, according to Evers.
"Many tend to explain inflation as a
law of nature, but Libertarians have
analyzed it and think it is unfair and
illegal," Evers said.
Evers supports balancing the budget,
and also recommends deep tax cuts and
raising the income level for individuals
who do not have to pay taxes.
He opposes drug law s on the grounds
that "people ought to be able to ingest
whatever they want to in the way of
vitamins. supplements, pleasure drugs,
whatever. .
An advantage in supporting the
Libertarian Party is that it provides a
theory that is consistent with its stand
on all issues, Eveis said. It differs from

Draft stance
I umino is not opposed to the draft
and registration on a theoretical basis,
maintaining that a just society has the
right toexpect support from its citizens.
"This particular call for registration,
however, is obviously an attempt to

Cole will be challenging McCloskey

in the Republican primary lor the sec

in 1962.
Cole identified the state ot the
economy and the draft question as the
hottest issues in the coming election.
Debt
Cole is concerned with "getting our
economic house in order," adding that
we have suffered from a drain on na
tional wealth through deficit spending
and the costs of energy.
"Due to our crushing debt, the
economy has become so unwieldly it
may not recover," Cole said.
Cole is opposed to the draft because
it is mi likely it will provide necessary
military forces, and because he consid
ers the Afghanistan situation an invalid
justification for the use of military
force.
"It this indeed were a valid reason
for military intervention, you couldn't
have kept the American people out of
the military," Cole said.
Cole also wanted to clarify his stand
on the abortion issue. He said over one
million abortions were performed in
the United States last year, and said
this displayed a disturbing attitude.
"I do no oppose free choice, but the
choice should be whether or not to get
pregnant and not whether or not to
have an abortion," Cole said.
As of yet, no other citi/ens have an

upcoming Congressional elections.
