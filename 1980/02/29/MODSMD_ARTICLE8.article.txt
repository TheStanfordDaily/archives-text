# Local drivers adjust to rising gas prices
## 
### Michelle Vaughen Staff Writer 
At least one-half of all students here
share a common problem: keeping
their cars filled with gasoline.
A year ago that meant getting up at
early morning hours to beat block-long
gas lines, writing home for ever
increasing gas allowances, and dili
gently red-marking the odd or even
days on the calendar.
You don't seem to hear many of
these complaints now. Have these
problems disappeared within the past
year, or have car owners simply come
to accept increasing gas prices, uncer
tain fuel availability and other incon
veniences as inevitable?
According to David Byrd, manager

of the Shell station on El Camino and
Middle Ave. in Palo Alto, "people as
sume the price is high and that it is
going to get even higher."
In a survey released two weeks ago
by the California State Automobile
Association (CSAA). the average re
tail price lor a gallon of gas was $1.21.
One year ago prices were in the $0.78 a
gallon range.
Some oil-industry analysts have said
regular gas prices will climb to $ 1.84 by
the end of the year.
Survey
A Daily survey of 16 local gas sta
tions revealed that the average cost of
gas this week is about $ 1.25 a gallon in
the Stanford area. And according to
most local gas station managers, prices

have been rising at a rate of 3 cents a
week since the first of the year.
Average self-service prices of regu
lar, unleaded and premium grades of
gasoline are $1.22, $1.26 and $1.27 a
gallon, respectively. Full service prices
run about one cent higher on the aver
age for each grade.
Although prices continue to climb,
customers do not seem to be complain
ing as much as they did a year ago,
according to most station managers.
Occasionally, Campus Shell dealer
owner Gary Andrews will hear a cus
tomer mutter, " 'Oh gee, there it goes
again,' but as far as belligerent com
ments about price increases, no, we ha
ven't had any."
Most station managers feel that

people arc voluntarily conserving more
gasoline than ever before.
'•When you get up to $1.30 a gallon
you think twice when deciding, 'Should
1 drive to the store while it's raining, or
wait 'til it's sunny and ride a bike,' "
said Andrews.
Conservation may not be an across
the-board practice, however, accord
ing to Ed McLoughlin, dealer-owner of
the Arco station on El Camino and
Oak Grove.
Hurts middle-class
"There are people in this area whose
average yearly income is very great and
if they want to go to Lake Tahoe,
they'll pay the price to go," he said.
"High gas prices only eliminate
people in the middle-income area from
traveling the way they want to."
Overall, however, ;i significant
number ol people do seem to he buying
less gas. I his, in turn, has virtually
eliminated both waiting lines and the
enforcement ol the odd-even system,
said most dealers.
"We don't enforce (the odd-even
system)." said Jim Brett, manager of
Exxon on I I ('amino and Cambridge
Ave.
"I'm not a policeman. I'll he
damned, when there's no line, il I'm
going to say, 'Hey. sorry. You can't
have any gas. It's not your day." "
Odd-even bad
With the disappearance of lines,
most dealers agree that the odd-even
s\stem is both unnecessary and bad tor
business.
Byrd estimates that "90 percent ot
the service stations in California are
not observing the system," adding that
he does not enforce it because "I can't
afford to."
Pump lines and odd-even enforce
ment cannot be entirely dismissed as
vestiges ol the past, however. At cer
tain hours lines ol cars can be found
curled around two local Standard sta
tions. one on HI ("amino Real near
Town and Country Village and the
other on Marsh road near Highway
101.
Cheap gas
The lure: prices which run as much as
20 cents cheaper than those of some
local competitors.
Although Standard station manager
Jerry Towney refused to comment,
other dealers offered explanations for
the low prices. Both stations are com
pany owned and operated, run by
Standard employees as opposed to
dealers who either own or lease the
station. By eliminating the dealer,
Standard does away with the 16.1 cent
a gallon profit margin dealers are leg
ally entitled to add per gallon.
Dealers are also quick to emphasize

that Standard's lower prices also bear
with them limited hours ol service,
strict enforcement of the odd-even sys
tem. uncertain fluctuations in gas av
ailability and aggravating waits that can
run up to an hour.
The future?
I hese inconveniences may portend
the future ol the gas pumping business.

warns Brett, as such oil company
owned and operated stations are forc
ing smaller independent dealers out of
the market.
" In a couple of years you're going to
see all small gas stations go out of busi
ness," said Brett. "Big oil companies
will run all the stations, and they're
really going to screw everybody."

gently red-marking the odd or even
days on the calendar.
You don't seem to hear many of
these complaints now. Have these
problems disappeared within the past
year, or have car owners simply come
to accept increasing gas prices, uncer
tain fuel availability and other incon
veniences as inevitable?
According to David Byrd, manager

of the Shell station on El Camino and
Middle Ave. in Palo Alto, "people as
sume the price is high and that it is
going to get even higher."
In a survey released two weeks ago
by the California State Automobile
Association (CSAA). the average re
tail price lor a gallon of gas was $1.21.
One year ago prices were in the $0.78 a
gallon range.
Some oil-industry analysts have said
regular gas prices will climb to $ 1.84 by
the end of the year.
Survey
A Daily survey of 16 local gas sta
tions revealed that the average cost of
gas this week is about $ 1.25 a gallon in
the Stanford area. And according to
most local gas station managers, prices

have been rising at a rate of 3 cents a
week since the first of the year.
Average self-service prices of regu
lar, unleaded and premium grades of
gasoline are $1.22, $1.26 and $1.27 a
gallon, respectively. Full service prices
run about one cent higher on the aver
age for each grade.
Although prices continue to climb,
customers do not seem to be complain
ing as much as they did a year ago,
according to most station managers.
Occasionally, Campus Shell dealer
owner Gary Andrews will hear a cus
tomer mutter, " 'Oh gee, there it goes
again,' but as far as belligerent com
ments about price increases, no, we ha
ven't had any."
Most station managers feel that

people arc voluntarily conserving more
gasoline than ever before.
'•When you get up to $1.30 a gallon
you think twice when deciding, 'Should
1 drive to the store while it's raining, or
wait 'til it's sunny and ride a bike,' "
said Andrews.
Conservation may not be an across
the-board practice, however, accord
ing to Ed McLoughlin, dealer-owner of
the Arco station on El Camino and
Oak Grove.
Hurts middle-class
"There are people in this area whose
average yearly income is very great and
if they want to go to Lake Tahoe,
they'll pay the price to go," he said.
"High gas prices only eliminate
people in the middle-income area from
traveling the way they want to."
Overall, however, ;i significant
number ol people do seem to he buying
less gas. I his, in turn, has virtually
eliminated both waiting lines and the
enforcement ol the odd-even system,
said most dealers.
"We don't enforce (the odd-even
system)." said Jim Brett, manager of
Exxon on I I ('amino and Cambridge
Ave.
"I'm not a policeman. I'll he
damned, when there's no line, il I'm
going to say, 'Hey. sorry. You can't
have any gas. It's not your day." "
Odd-even bad
With the disappearance of lines,
most dealers agree that the odd-even
s\stem is both unnecessary and bad tor
business.
Byrd estimates that "90 percent ot
the service stations in California are
not observing the system," adding that
he does not enforce it because "I can't
afford to."
Pump lines and odd-even enforce
ment cannot be entirely dismissed as
vestiges ol the past, however. At cer
tain hours lines ol cars can be found
curled around two local Standard sta
tions. one on HI ("amino Real near
Town and Country Village and the
other on Marsh road near Highway
101.
Cheap gas
The lure: prices which run as much as
20 cents cheaper than those of some
local competitors.
Although Standard station manager
Jerry Towney refused to comment,
other dealers offered explanations for
the low prices. Both stations are com
pany owned and operated, run by
Standard employees as opposed to
dealers who either own or lease the
station. By eliminating the dealer,
Standard does away with the 16.1 cent
a gallon profit margin dealers are leg
ally entitled to add per gallon.
Dealers are also quick to emphasize

that Standard's lower prices also bear
with them limited hours ol service,
strict enforcement of the odd-even sys
tem. uncertain fluctuations in gas av
ailability and aggravating waits that can
run up to an hour.
The future?
I hese inconveniences may portend
the future ol the gas pumping business.

warns Brett, as such oil company
owned and operated stations are forc
ing smaller independent dealers out of
the market.
" In a couple of years you're going to
see all small gas stations go out of busi
ness," said Brett. "Big oil companies
will run all the stations, and they're
really going to screw everybody."
At least one-half of all students here
share a common problem: keeping
their cars filled with gasoline.
A year ago that meant getting up at
early morning hours to beat block-long
gas lines, writing home for ever
increasing gas allowances, and dili
gently red-marking the odd or even
days on the calendar.
