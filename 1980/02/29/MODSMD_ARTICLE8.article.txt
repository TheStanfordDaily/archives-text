# Local drivers adjust to rising gas prices
## 
### Michelle Vaughen Staff Writer 
At least one-half of all students here
share a common problem: keeping
their cars filled with gasoline.
A year ago that meant getting up at
early morning hours to beat block-long
gas lines, writing home for ever
increasing gas allowances, and dili
gently red-marking the odd or even
days on the calendar.
You don't seem to hear many of
these complaints now. Have these
problems disappeared within the past
year, or have car owners simply come
to accept increasing gas prices, uncer
tain fuel availability and other incon
veniences as inevitable?
According to David Byrd, manager

of the Shell station on El Camino and
Middle Ave. in Palo Alto, "people as
sume the price is high and that it is
going to get even higher."
In a survey released two weeks ago
by the California State Automobile
Association (CSAA). the average re
tail price lor a gallon of gas was $1.21.
One year ago prices were in the $0.78 a
gallon range.
Some oil-industry analysts have said
regular gas prices will climb to $ 1.84 by
the end of the year.
Survey
A Daily survey of 16 local gas sta
tions revealed that the average cost of
gas this week is about $ 1.25 a gallon in
the Stanford area. And according to
most local gas station managers, prices

have been rising at a rate of 3 cents a
week since the first of the year.
Average self-service prices of regu
lar, unleaded and premium grades of
gasoline are $1.22, $1.26 and $1.27 a
gallon, respectively. Full service prices
run about one cent higher on the aver
age for each grade.
Although prices continue to climb,
customers do not seem to be complain
ing as much as they did a year ago,
according to most station managers.
Occasionally, Campus Shell dealer
owner Gary Andrews will hear a cus
tomer mutter, " 'Oh gee, there it goes
again,' but as far as belligerent com
ments about price increases, no, we ha
ven't had any."
Most station managers feel that

people arc voluntarily conserving more
gasoline than ever before.
'â€¢When you get up to $1.30 a gallon
you think twice when deciding, 'Should
1 drive to the store while it's raining, or
wait 'til it's sunny and ride a bike,' "
said Andrews.
Conservation may not be an across
the-board practice, however, accord
ing to Ed McLoughlin, dealer-owner of
the Arco station on El Camino and
Oak Grove.

"There are people in this area whose
average yearly income is very great and
if they want to go to Lake Tahoe,
they'll pay the price to go," he said.
