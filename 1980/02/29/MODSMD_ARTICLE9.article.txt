## High turnout on first day Zimbabwe blacks vote 
### 
From the Daily wire serv ices
SAI ISBURY. Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia â€” Upwards of one
million Zimbabwe blacks voted
Wednesday in an overwhelming
first-day turnout for elections
that could sharply alter the poli
tics of southern Africa.
Despite rain in much of the
country, long lines started form
ing hours before the polls
opened in many areas and were a
mile and a halt long by late after
noon. No serious incidents were
reported, and the mood of the
crowds was generally cheerful.
The election, the culmination
ol a three-month return to colo
nial status for the breakaway na
tion. is designed to bring the
country to legal independence
under the African name Zim
babwe. International recogni
tion would finally put to rest the
unilateral declaration ot
independence to maintain white
minority rule and end Africa's
bloodiest struggle against white
domination.
Cow pasture polls
In Bcmbcsi. some arrived by
cart, but most walked miles to be
at the cow pasture polling place
when it opened Wednesday
morning.
The early arrivals separated,
as is tribal custom, into two lines,
men in one and women in
another, even before the poll
takers arrived.
When the election officials did
arrive, a British "bobbie" const
able. Alan Buchanan, was with
them, serving as a symbol of En
glish determination to hold a tree
and fair election in Africa, where
such elections arc practically un
known.
Except lor having doffed his
brass button coat in the muggy
weather. Constable Buchanan
was in the same uniform that he

was wearijig last week in the
Scottish town of Dumfries. His
polished black shoes stood out in
contrast to the mud-spattered
canvas shoes of the voters as the
lines merged and three men and
three women took their place in
front ol the tent. ready to vote.
'Age check'
Awkwardly, the process be
gan. There was the "age check."
merely a glance by a white voting
officer to determine whether the
voter was IS years or older. II
challenged, voters had to pro
duce a document to indicate
birth date. There was a stamp of
"magic ink" on the voter's hand
to prevent voting elsewhere.
There is no voter registration roll
in rural Rhodesia.
The voter was then handed a
ballot and sent to an open-air
booth beyond the tent, where the
ballot was marked. The ballot
was then folded and pressed
through a thin slit into the pad
locked ballot bo\.
At first it went slowly, for
many early arrivals were elderly,
unable to read or white, or afraid
even to attempt to make an "x"
after the symbol of the parties
that they favored.
Under the election law. the
chief polling officer, usually a
white local civil servant able to
speak the local tribal language,
can assist by marking the ballot
after establishing the voter's
choice.
Irony
It is yet another irony of these
elections: a white assisting a
black to vote tor a black party
pledged to supplant white minor
ity rule.
By mid-morning the voting
was moving faster, and yet the
serpentine lines of men and
women waiting to vote grew

longer.
"We began walking before the
moon went down to be here
early." said Irvine Dhlodhlo. a
22-year-old whose bride was
waiting in the female line. "We
walked seven miles, and now we
have waited four hours."
But he was not upset. He was
eager, tor now he stood ready to
be the next to enter the voting
tent.
Although the voting will con
tinue through today, ballots wHI
not be counted until Monday,
and the results are not expected
until Tuesday morning. The
weekend will be spend moving
ballot boxes from 657 polling
stations, many of them remote,
to eight provincial capitals for
counting. The purpose is to avoid
intimidation by making it impos
sible to tell how any district
voted.
