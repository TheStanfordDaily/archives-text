# Replaced by East Asian Studies
## Res Ed cancels French theme house 
### Bob Deyling Staff Writer 
An East Asian Studies theme house will replace
the French House beginning next year, the Office of
Residential Education decided last week.
French House residents immediately asked As
sociate Dean for Residential Education Norm Robin
son to reconsider his decision.
Robinson said he has agreed to review his ruling
and will make a final decision sometime this week.
He expressed doubt, however, that both the
French House and the newly approved East Asian
Studies house could be given space in the housing
system next year.
"This is definitely a zero-sum game: in order to get
a new house into the system something else must go,"
Robinson said.
Robinson made his decision last week after he
received a recommendation from the Configuration
Panel, an expanded version of the Committee on
Services to Students Subcommittee on Residences
(COSS-R) to discontinue the house.
The panel also evaluated American Studies, La
Casa Italiana and Haus Mitteleuropa as well as the
proposals for the East Asian Studies house and a
performing arts house. Intermedia.
The panel did not accept the Intermedia proposal.
"The decision of the panel (to discontinue the
French House) was unanimous, and 1 accepted their
recommendations," Robinson said. He makes the
final decisions on theme house programs.
French House residents have circulated campus
wide petitions urging the support and continuation of

their house program. In addition, 24 of the 36 resi
dents there wrote letters to Residential Education.
In a letter to French House residents, the panel said
it based its recommendation on concern over the
quality of leadership within the house, student in
volvement and its sense of community.
"Given the problems of the house this year, the
panel . . . was not persuaded that next year would be
significantly different," wrote Thomas McDonough,
student chairman of the panel.
Kamal Zein, resident fellow in the French House,
criticized the housing committee's policies on theme
house evaluation.
"The French house has been in existence for five
years and I don't think the process we must go
through every year to justify the house is fair," he
said.
It is an added burden on the students if they feel
they must constantly prove to the administration the
success of the program.
"It is a shame that no one on the committee ever
came to the house to observe us," he added.
The only testimony the committee heard on any of
the houses under scrutiny was written reports and
oral presentations by students from the residences in
question.
Annual review of academic theme houses was insti
tuted last year to "systematically evaluate on a regu
lar basis the health of all the houses in the residence
system; encourage the development of new academic
theme proposals and to implement them."
The COSS-R observed that academic theme

houses provided "many exciting programs" during
their first and second years, but that after the initial
group of students moved on, the house "often experi
enced a period of inactivity."
The COSS-R also discussed the fact that houses
which best accommodate academic theme programs
are often the sought-after row houses and expressed a
special reluctance to remove general access to a row
house in order to set up a theme house.
"We encourage new proposals and the expectation
is built in that there will be periodic change in the
configuration of houses," said McDonough.
The COSS-R approved the East Asian Studies
proposal last year, but no space was available to
implement the program.
Dan and Nancy Okimoto, resident fellows at
Toyon who have supported the East Asian idea, are
optimistic about the new house.
"This will be one of the first East Asian theme
houses created by any university in the country and
we feel it will be an enriching and culturally exciting
place to live." Dan Okimoto, an assistant professorof
political science, said.
"The East Asian house would have a different
focus than Okada house in Wilbur," said Steve Chel
berg, a senior international relations major who
wrote the proposal for the new theme house.
Okada's program stresses the Asian-American ex
perience, and the new house would stress the Asian
theme, incorporating studies of language and art in
the program, he said.
Chelberg is now a resident of the French House.
