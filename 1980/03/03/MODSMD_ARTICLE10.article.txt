WASHINGTON — For the first time in mem
dry, Radio Moscow's English language broadcasts
are being beamed to parts of the United States on a
standard AM frequency, federal officials say.
'"I don't know of any other instance in which
we've picked up Moscow's propaganda, in English,
coming into the United States . . . where any aver
age Joe can pick it up in his car," said a Federal
Communications Commission source who asked
not to be identified.
The broadcasts, monitored in Florida on Tues
day and Wednesday, were relayed by a Cuban
station.
"It was pure propaganda aimed at the United
States." said James McKinney of the FCC. "By
broadcasting primarily at night, they were clearly
trying to reach as much of Florida and beyond as
possible."
Radio Moscow, heard around the world via

short-wave transmissions, recently has presented
as news the Kremlin's position on the Russian oc
cupation of Afghanistan. IT»c state-run facility typ
ically presents only the government's view of de
velopments around the world, often railing against
"American imperialism."
State Department officials said they could not
predict whether the Cuban relays marked the start
of a propaganda campaign aimed at masses of
American listeners.
"We started monitoring when we received a
complaint of interference from WSNY-AM in
Jacksonville, which broadcasts on the same 600
kilohertz frequency." he added.
McKinney said he could not immediately deter
mine whether the transmissions were in violation
of hemispheric agreements that limit the frequen
cies used by stations close to international borders.
William Shinn, director of the State Depart
ment's Soviet affairs office, said Thursday night he
was not aware of the FCC's monitoring report.
