# Rare snow hits Jerusalem yesterday

### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
JERUSALEM â€” A crippling snow storm,
the first to hit the city since 1977, cut
Jerusalem off from the rest of the country
yesterday morning. Snow plows later
reopened key highways, but more snow was
predicted.
Snow rarely falls in this Israeli city, which
lies at an elevation of 3000 feet on the ridge
between the coastal plain and the Judean
Desert. Yesterday's snowfall totaled 8 inches
enough to paralyze public transport and
hamper most business and government of
fices.
Mayor Teddy Kollek declared a snow
emergency and opened a command post to
direct operations. Soldiers in jeeps helped
city crews aid stranded families, stalled

motorists and pregnant women needing hos
pitalization.
Until the Jerusalem-Tel Aviv road was
opened at noon, the only link between the
two main cities was one morning train.
Another main highway, leading to the south,
was closed by 20 inches of snow at Hebron in
the Judean hills.
The Cabinet of Prime Minister Menachem
Begin did not meet as scheduled, because
some Cabinet members could not make it to
the capital. The session was postponed until
Tuesday.
1 he Cabinet is expected to discuss the
U.N. Security Council resolution condemn
ing Israeli settlements in the occupied ter
ritories.
Israel has expressed "disappointment"

that the United States voted with the major
ity against Israel. The United States has long
considered the settlements "an impediment
to peace," but has not voted against Israel
before.
Begin braved icy roads and gale-driven
snow flurries to join about 3000 mourners at
the Sea ot Galilee, or Lake Kinneret as it is
known locally, for funeral services for former
Foreign Minister Yigal Allon.
The funeral was held in the Galilee farm
land area where Allon was born 61 years ago.
He was a leading official of the opposition
Labor Party, which Begin's Likud bloc
ousted in 1977, and was the top field com
mander in Israel's War of Independence in
1 948-49. He died Friday of a sudden heart
attack.
