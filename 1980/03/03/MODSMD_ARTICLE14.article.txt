# Grads pursue careers, school
## There's life after Stanford 
### Samuel Howe Staff Writer 
Optimism about the job mar
ket for Stanford students seems
to have come back into vogue
recently. Recently released
statistics show that the number
of job placements made through
the University for students has
risen by as much as 10 percent in
single year.
And, despite whatever na
tional trends may show, "the fact
is that the Stanford student
graduating is only one student
looking for one job," said Ralph
Keller, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center
here.
With prospects good and
career options for many left
open, what do Stanford students
plan to do with themselves after
they graduate?
Exact statistics are hard to
compile, since only about half of
all graduating seniors respond to
the Academic Information
Center (AlO's "senior survey,"
which asks questions about stu
dents' future career plans and
career choices. Further, the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) keeps files on
only those students who specifi
cally use the CPPC for help in
gaining employment.
But while definite figures on
the number ot students who plan
to be lawyers, doctors or profes
sional hippopotamus trainers
remain elusive, certain trends
have become evident among

those who did respond to last
spring's senior survey.
(irad school decline
112 irst of all, the number of stu
dents who are continuing di
rectly to graduate school has de
clined over the past lew years.
However, the AlC's report on
the survey did indicate that many
students go on to grad school
after a year or more in the work
force; nearly 74 percent of
seniors planned graduate study
within three years of graduation.
Also, the number of women
graduates who go on to work
immediately following gradua
tion has risen dramatically in the
past few years, the report stated.
Four years ago, a little more than
30 percent of women went on to
work; last year s figure was more
than 60 percent.
Ot those seniors who re
sponded to last year's survey. 54
percent said they were going di
rectly to work — 60 percent of
the females and 50 percent of the
males.
About 35 percent said they
were pursuing graduate study
immediately; this figure broke
down to about 40 percent of the
males and 2<N percent of females.
The remaining seniors, around
1 0 percent, had plans to combine
work and study. to travel or were
indefinite.
Ot those who did have plans
tor graduate study, a great per
centage indicated interest in bus
iness. law, medicine, education
and engineering.

What determines the choice ol
a career? Obviously, individual
motives vary, but Keller said he
thinks that money ranks"'at least
no better than third" as an influ
ence on a Stanford student's
choice ot career. Despite charges
leveled at today's generation of
students that they tend to be
more economically motivated
than their older brothers and sis
ters. Keller said that "what kind
ot life will I lead?" and "where
will I be working?" are each
more important questions to the
typical student than "how much
money will I be making?"
Morever, Keller said, recogni
tion is what the job seeker wants
most of all in employment.
"Everybody wants to percei\e
that they are successful," he con
tinued. and most Stanford stu
dents do not place a primary link
between money and success.
"I just don't think most stu
dents here are much influenced
hy that. . . they want to like what
they are doing. I hope they're not
too influenced by supply and
demand."
High success rate
I he CPPC keeps figures only
lor those students who actually
register with the office for help.
Almost 3000 University stu
dents and alumni registered with
the CPPC in 1979. Of these, only
13 percent reported themselves
as still available for employ ment
at ihe time ol the CPPC's annual
report. Many of those were
known to be employed at the

time, hut were or are still looking
lor advancement. It was esti
mated in the report that only 2
percent ol those registered were
actually unemployed.
While figures lor actual career
placement are not available for
University students, sonic in
teresting trends have been dis
cerned recently in the tentative
career choices ol incoming col
lege students. Results ol a survey
of entering freslfmen are com
piled each year In the American
Council ol Education and
IJC'I.A.
Most students tend to reline or

completely change their career
choices while in college, hut
nevertheless the lie Ids ol
medicine, law. engineering and
business do rank as the top four
choices among this year's
freshmen at Stanford, and these
liekls are the dominant ones in
which seniors pursue graduate
study.
In the Ircshman class, nearly
20 percent indicated a desire to
be a physician. 12.5 percent an
cngineerand I 1 percent a lawyer
or judge. .Additionally. S percent
indicated an interest in business,
7.5 percent in scientific research

and more than 4 percent in writ
ing or journalism, l or every re
maining field, no more than 2
percent ol the students indicated
a tentative career choice in that
I icld.
I here is lite after Stanford, it
seems, hut then there is life altei
e\ery educational institution as
well. What is is like for others?
Nationally, the freshmen sur
veyed appear as a whole to have
some different leanings Ironi
those entering Stanford Irosh.
Only 4 percent plan to he
physicians, and 5 percent go into
law. However, more similar to

Stanford, some IS percent ex»
pressed an interest in business as
a career, and nearly 17 percent
plan to be engineers.
I wo major fields in which
Stanford students do not appear
to he as interested are computer
programming and accounting.
Nationally, nearly 6 percent of
the nation's freshmen plan to be
accountants or actuaries, and
almost 5 percent to be computer
programmers or analysts. At
Stanford, only ' 1 > percent of the
Irtish said tliev planned to be the

eager heavers with the ultimate reward: jobs.
Optimism about the job mar
ket for Stanford students seems
to have come back into vogue
recently. Recently released
statistics show that the number
of job placements made through
the University for students has
risen by as much as 10 percent in
single year.
And, despite whatever na
tional trends may show, "the fact
is that the Stanford student
graduating is only one student
looking for one job," said Ralph
Keller, director of the Career
Planning and Placement Center
here.
With prospects good and
career options for many left
open, what do Stanford students
plan to do with themselves after
they graduate?
Exact statistics are hard to
compile, since only about half of
all graduating seniors respond to
the Academic Information
Center (AlO's "senior survey,"
which asks questions about stu
dents' future career plans and
career choices. Further, the
Career Planning and Placement
Center (CPPC) keeps files on
only those students who specifi
cally use the CPPC for help in
gaining employment.
But while definite figures on
the number ot students who plan
to be lawyers, doctors or profes
sional hippopotamus trainers
remain elusive, certain trends
have become evident among

those who did respond to last
spring's senior survey.
(irad school decline
112 irst of all, the number of stu
dents who are continuing di
rectly to graduate school has de
clined over the past lew years.
However, the AlC's report on
the survey did indicate that many
students go on to grad school
after a year or more in the work
force; nearly 74 percent of
seniors planned graduate study
within three years of graduation.
Also, the number of women
graduates who go on to work
immediately following gradua
tion has risen dramatically in the
past few years, the report stated.
Four years ago, a little more than
30 percent of women went on to
work; last year s figure was more
than 60 percent.
Ot those seniors who re
sponded to last year's survey. 54
percent said they were going di
rectly to work — 60 percent of
the females and 50 percent of the
males.
About 35 percent said they
were pursuing graduate study
immediately; this figure broke
down to about 40 percent of the
males and 2<N percent of females.
The remaining seniors, around
1 0 percent, had plans to combine
work and study. to travel or were
indefinite.
Ot those who did have plans
tor graduate study, a great per
centage indicated interest in bus
iness. law, medicine, education
and engineering.

What determines the choice ol
a career? Obviously, individual
motives vary, but Keller said he
thinks that money ranks"'at least
no better than third" as an influ
ence on a Stanford student's
choice ot career. Despite charges
leveled at today's generation of
students that they tend to be
more economically motivated
than their older brothers and sis
ters. Keller said that "what kind
ot life will I lead?" and "where
will I be working?" are each
more important questions to the
typical student than "how much
money will I be making?"
Morever, Keller said, recogni
tion is what the job seeker wants
most of all in employment.
"Everybody wants to percei\e
that they are successful," he con
tinued. and most Stanford stu
dents do not place a primary link
between money and success.
"I just don't think most stu
dents here are much influenced
hy that. . . they want to like what
they are doing. I hope they're not
too influenced by supply and
demand."
High success rate
I he CPPC keeps figures only
lor those students who actually
register with the office for help.
Almost 3000 University stu
dents and alumni registered with
the CPPC in 1979. Of these, only
13 percent reported themselves
as still available for employ ment
at ihe time ol the CPPC's annual
report. Many of those were
known to be employed at the

time, hut were or are still looking
lor advancement. It was esti
mated in the report that only 2
percent ol those registered were
actually unemployed.
While figures lor actual career
placement are not available for
University students, sonic in
teresting trends have been dis
cerned recently in the tentative
career choices ol incoming col
lege students. Results ol a survey
of entering freslfmen are com
piled each year In the American
Council ol Education and
IJC'I.A.
Most students tend to reline or

completely change their career
choices while in college, hut
nevertheless the lie Ids ol
medicine, law. engineering and
business do rank as the top four
choices among this year's
freshmen at Stanford, and these
liekls are the dominant ones in
which seniors pursue graduate
study.
In the Ircshman class, nearly
20 percent indicated a desire to
be a physician. 12.5 percent an
cngineerand I 1 percent a lawyer
or judge. .Additionally. S percent
indicated an interest in business,
