" 'Think globally, act locally*
is an essential concept of our or
ganization," said Richard
Rathbun, president of Creative
Initiative (CI). "Each person
.must take full responsibility for
'himself and the whole." This is
the type of mental attitude that
â– Creative Initiative tries to foster
in its prospective members and
expanding interny
jtional family.
i This non-profit, educational
and research foundation was
founded in 1962 by 10 women
from Escondido Village.
The group grew into a
Jniddle-aged, middle-class
jnovemcnt. Most members are
between 25 and 45 years old.
They are well-educated, eman
cipated and financially secure,
and have the time to commit
themselves to CI. Today its 3000
members are spread throughout
16 states and several foreign
countries.
"Our role is education of a
special kind." said Gary Wil
liams, assoc. dean of the
graduate business school here,
and an active member of CI since
1965. "We are not an activist
group. We focus on educating
Ourselves and others to under
stand the context in which we
live, to understand the honest
feality of the world and not the
illusion. And then we ask what
we can do to improve the situa
tion."
Williams stresses that "it all
comes down to the individual.
We get people to evaluate their
goals and their motives and then
ask themselves, am I being hon
est? Is my life adding up and tak
ing me where 1 want to go?" The
end is not important: CI focuses
on getting there.
CI members contend that only
when individuals function in a
clear mindstatc with a willing
ness to move out to others can a
group like CI successfully pro
cure a common goal. That goal,
added Rathbun, "is for the Un

ited States to model a lifestyle
viable for the future to enable
Third World countries to de
velop. while at the same time
maintaining a high quality of life
in America."
CI is proud ol the potential
that the United States has to set a
model example attainable by the
rest ol the world. But. "we're not
modeling an attainable world
now." said Rathbun. "We take
so much for granted."
Jim Burch, another CI
member, continued that our
lifestyles would be re
volutionized il we just under
stood that the world is a "closed
system, it is all interrelated and
we are all one." This realization
would motivate us to improve
our relations with other people
and other nations, he said.
Although unaffiliated with
any particular denomination, CI
is a religiously based movement.
I hey trace their philosophy
hack to the basic teachings ol
Jesus removed from the Christ
ian tradition, and to his histori
cally pragmatic approach to life.
"Jesus tried to communicate
with people on how to fulfill their
goals," said Rathbun.
CI does not operate hierarchi
cally. as most organizations do.
Rathbun holds the "president"
title solely for tax and business
purposes. Members with much

past experience form a steering
committee, but the committee
constantly changes. All decisions
concerning the CI process ol
education, activities and out
reach are reached by a consen
sus. Not only must all Palo Alto
members endorse an action. Init
all Bay Area members must sup
port it as well.
I he continued, active opera
tion ol CI depends on individual.
annual pledges and volunteers.
Presently the Palo Alto office
has 35 lull-time. volunteer stall
and three salaried stall members
who have no other source ol in
come.
Expenses are minimal. The CI
office is a starkly furnished, re
habilitation repair garage with
low rent. It is located near public
transportation and the
downtown area. Rathbun com
mented, "Our dependency on
material property is down to a
minimum. We're interested in
people, not in things or build
ings."
Members attribute their
gradual but constant growth to a
"one to one" communication
system. "We don't send people
out like missionaries and recruit
people." said Williams.
CI grows carefully and hon
estly. Williams said there is great
concern not to violate anyone in

the process by allowing them to
join on false pretenses, pretenses
that CI is "lull of fun and group
encounter sessions." "We never
expect to be very big." lie added,
"because CI takes a tremendous
commitment and constant con
tribution. Most people don't
have the time lo give."
However, the movement to
change the planet does not
necessitate large numbers. CI
philosophy is based on the prin
ciple ol an N percent Creative
Minority those people in
terested in world \iev\s. interre
lations ol people and nations and
the environment. Presently CI
members comprise 2 percent ol
the population, and they calcu
late that, given UK-ears. they'll
increase to 5 percent.
I he figure needed to change
the direction ol mankind is only
N percent, said Rathbun. "To
help us grow. we're looking to all
types ol communications." he
added, "radio shows, tapes. slide
shows, films and outreach prog
rams with various high schools
and colleges
Taking 16 CI members on a
recent six-month trip to Nepal
fulfilled part ol ( I s educational
goal to teach people about the
"honest reality ol the world."
Ranging Irom I 6 to 22 years old
and accompanied by adult ad
visors. these members partici-

pa ted in organized projects with
the United Mission I und and
I NIC'I I I hey helped to prom
ote health care, sanitation, edu
cation and residential rehabilita
tion in the country's rural areas.
"We want to make sure that
the young people who come
alone don't sutler from lack ol
real world knowledge like we
did." s;ud Williams. A trip like
this is good "to blow their minds
open." lie added.
( I believes it is essential for
e\ery person to have a similar
experience, preferably at the be
ginning ol her universiiv career.
Many students enter and leave a
university never really question
ing why they are there, or
prioritizing what they hope to
accomplish.
Members see a direct link be
tween the energy crisis and war.
I hey do not support war. but
neither are they draft resistcrs.
"Because of the incredible
opportunities we've been given
in this country, we feel an obliga
tion to give back. Serving in
some fashion is good for
everyone." said Williams. He
added, however, that he wishes
services could be divorced Irom
the military and be strictly volun
