# 'Affectation' simply striving, aiming
## 
### 
Affectation is a word that has a
had connotation for almost
everyone. We conjure up pic
tures of stuffy fat ladies holding
afternoon teas for the pretenti
ous. and we wait hopefully for
Groucho Marx or the Three
Stooges to come along and make
a mess.
Part ol the reason for this is
that our collective egalitarian
■superego makes us uncomforta
ble with someone who seems not
to he convinced ol his or her
equality We identity affectation
with crass social climbing, and it
is literally easier for us to think ol

an excuse for armed robber)
than for that kind of affectation.
But this is a misunderstanding
of the term. The dictionary has it
right when it calls affectation
simply "a striving after, aiming
at." This emphasizes its
etymological connection with
the word affection: as well it
should, since both activities in
volve essentially a movement ol
the mind or heart outward to
ward something outside itself.
And m I act we often use the
term 111 this more general sense.
The suburban business executive
who makes a show ol his famil
iarity with the street wisdom of a
black uhetto incurs our inner

ridicule as much as the one who
displays a suspect appreciation
of ballet. Affectation is a general
human phenomenon, not a func
tion of the special case of social
climbing.
But this example suggests
another reason affectation has
become a pejorative term. We
value sincerity, being true to our
inner selves. We wax somber
when talking about the necessity
of showing ourselves to the
world as we really are. One con
sequence of this fairly recent de
velopment is that affectation has
come to be identified with

hypocrisy. The dictionary re
flects this change when it defines
affectation as "simulation, pre
tense."
But I think this is a mistake.
There is a bin difference between

trying to pass ourselves off as
something we know we are not.
and striving to become some
thing we would genuinely like to
be. The latter passes impercepti
bly into the mere cultivation of a
self-image, which virtually
everyone in our society agrees is
a good thing.
What we end up criticizing,
then, is people striving to be
come what they are 111 fact in
capable of becoming. But first ol
all. who are we to decide what
such a person is and is not capa
ble ot becoming? And in any
event, such persons we ought to
accuse of self-ignorance as much
as affectation.
Furthermore, the futile at
tempt of a self-reflective culture
like ours to attain the natural
spontaneity that our high valua
tion of sincerity demands has
spawned a whole array of affec
tations of its own: fast, chirpy
talk that exudes an
ing good feeling; kissing the
cheeks of acquaintances upon
meeting them: nervous whistl
ing; happy talk on the local news
— all designed to impress people
with how natural, how normal,
how reasonable, how . . . well,
how nice we are.
The main problem, though, is
that in our society, affectation
rarely occurs as a consistent and
identifiable character trait. It
tends instead to pop up as an iso
lated and discrete part of one's
personality, often producing
peculiar discontinuities.
Everyone knows of someone
who feels compelled for some
unknown reason to demonstrate
Ins familiarity with or apprecia
tion ot something or another, but
who is otherwise a sincere and
se I f-con ten t ed person.
The symbols of status and

hence the objects of our affecta
tions are manifold and rapidly
changing. We tend toad as indi
viduals, and most of our affecta
tions have specific meanings tor
the individuals who engage in
them. Similarly, our aversion to
affectations tends in practice to
he selective, and we rev eal more
about ourselves when we accuse
someone of being an affectations
sort of person than about the
person in question.
What we often reveal about
ourselves, I suspect, is that we
feel a simmering dissatisfaction
with what we are making of our
lives. Thoreau had more than a
grain ol truth when he said that
most people live lives ot quiet
desperation. Aiul the spectatcle
ot someone striving to become
what he is not, especially it it
holds a prospect of success, is an
uncomfortable reminder ot liovv
much we have had to forego in
order to become a person.

Affectation is a word that has a
had connotation for almost
everyone. We conjure up pic
tures of stuffy fat ladies holding
afternoon teas for the pretenti
ous. and we wait hopefully for
Groucho Marx or the Three
Stooges to come along and make
a mess.
Part ol the reason for this is
that our collective egalitarian
■superego makes us uncomforta
ble with someone who seems not
to he convinced ol his or her
equality We identity affectation
with crass social climbing, and it
is literally easier for us to think ol

an excuse for armed robber)
than for that kind of affectation.
But this is a misunderstanding
of the term. The dictionary has it
right when it calls affectation
simply "a striving after, aiming
at." This emphasizes its
etymological connection with
the word affection: as well it
should, since both activities in
volve essentially a movement ol
the mind or heart outward to
ward something outside itself.
And m I act we often use the
term 111 this more general sense.
The suburban business executive
who makes a show ol his famil
iarity with the street wisdom of a
black uhetto incurs our inner

ridicule as much as the one who
displays a suspect appreciation
of ballet. Affectation is a general
human phenomenon, not a func
tion of the special case of social
climbing.
But this example suggests
another reason affectation has
become a pejorative term. We
value sincerity, being true to our
inner selves. We wax somber
when talking about the necessity
of showing ourselves to the
world as we really are. One con
sequence of this fairly recent de
velopment is that affectation has
come to be identified with

hypocrisy. The dictionary re
flects this change when it defines
affectation as "simulation, pre
tense."
But I think this is a mistake.
There is a bin difference between

trying to pass ourselves off as
something we know we are not.
and striving to become some
thing we would genuinely like to
be. The latter passes impercepti
bly into the mere cultivation of a
self-image, which virtually
everyone in our society agrees is
a good thing.
What we end up criticizing,
then, is people striving to be
come what they are 111 fact in
capable of becoming. But first ol
all. who are we to decide what
such a person is and is not capa
ble ot becoming? And in any
event, such persons we ought to
accuse of self-ignorance as much
as affectation.
Furthermore, the futile at
tempt of a self-reflective culture
like ours to attain the natural
spontaneity that our high valua
tion of sincerity demands has
spawned a whole array of affec
tations of its own: fast, chirpy
talk that exudes an
ing good feeling; kissing the
cheeks of acquaintances upon
meeting them: nervous whistl
ing; happy talk on the local news
— all designed to impress people
with how natural, how normal,
how reasonable, how . . . well,
how nice we are.
The main problem, though, is
that in our society, affectation
rarely occurs as a consistent and
identifiable character trait. It
tends instead to pop up as an iso
lated and discrete part of one's
personality, often producing
peculiar discontinuities.
Everyone knows of someone
who feels compelled for some
unknown reason to demonstrate
Ins familiarity with or apprecia
tion ot something or another, but
who is otherwise a sincere and
se I f-con ten t ed person.
The symbols of status and

hence the objects of our affecta
tions are manifold and rapidly
changing. We tend toad as indi
viduals, and most of our affecta
tions have specific meanings tor
the individuals who engage in
them. Similarly, our aversion to
affectations tends in practice to
he selective, and we rev eal more
about ourselves when we accuse
someone of being an affectations
sort of person than about the
person in question.
What we often reveal about
ourselves, I suspect, is that we
feel a simmering dissatisfaction
with what we are making of our
lives. Thoreau had more than a
grain ol truth when he said that
most people live lives ot quiet
desperation. Aiul the spectatcle
ot someone striving to become
what he is not, especially it it
holds a prospect of success, is an
