## End violence against women 
### 
I riday night, I eb. 21. a group of 75 women and
men held an important and exhilarating march
through the Stanford community and College Ter
race. It followed a showing of the slideshow by
Women Against Violence and Pornography in the
Media (WAN I'M), which exposes the portrayal of
violence against women on current album covers,
billboards, advertising, soft and hardcore porn
maga/ines. including Penthouse, I'layboy and
Hustler.
The images are often startling and gruesome, the
worst being a picture of a woman with a knife
twisted in her bloodied vagina: how lar from the
reality ol love and sexuality such images remove
us! I "lie march was a demonstration ol protest
against this violence, which manifests itself in ac
tual rape and battery ol women, and. to a lesser
degree, in the lack ol love and mutual respect that
can happen 111 male-lemale relationships.
Our march went through College Terrace,
through the center ol campus and by the frater
nities. We held candles and sang songs and chants,
calling to people 111 their houses and dorms that we
are "taking back the night." that we want women
to feel sale in the streets even alone, even at night
â€” that it is a woman's right to live in this world
without tear.
College Terrace was a focus for us because ol
four rapes ol women living there alone in the past
year. The rapist has not been caught, though police
and community action have been very supportive.
In the meantime, we live in terror.
One ol the chants was "No more Penthouse, no
more rape." The connection is more obvious than
it seems: the perpetuation of pornography per
petuates a psychology that allows women to be
nothing more than asses, crotches or breasts to men

who are nothing more than cocks. Such a simplifi
cation of male-lemale relationships encourages
rape and battery, when men don't look at women
as thinking, feeling people, only as "it."
This connection was made most obvious on the
march when some fraternity men exposed their
sexism. Some yelled at us from their windows.
"Exploit women!," " Rape them and celebrate with
100 kegs of beer!" At another fraternity one man
dropped his pants and jumped around like a gorilla
on his front stoop, making fun of us. We asked why
he was so threatened: didn't he care about women
he knew who could be hurt by rape, his girlfriend
perhaps, the women he loves?
"I don't love anvhodv." he yelled.
"That says a lot." we replied, sadly, and moved
on.
Another man on his way to a formal said, very
rationally. "I understand what the issue is about,
and I think you're wrong. But I don't have any
arguments prepared now. So please, don't spoil my
good time." His woman friend didn't even know
what the issue was about.
Iliis issue reaches into all ol our lives. These
three examples are shocking when you realize we
are talking about supposed future leaders ol
America who are too rational or irrational to feel
the danger or horror ol what we are protesting.
fortunately there was much support coming
I torn people along the way. and even cheers at the
Alpha Delts' fraternity. It you are a supporter of
non-violence against women, bring your opinion
into the open, and especially talk to the Inter
fraternity Council. It is essential to stop the vio
lence before it hurts any more women, maybe
someone you know, if it hasn't already.
