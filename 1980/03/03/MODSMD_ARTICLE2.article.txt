# Merits of French House outweigh flaws, residents claim
## 
### Andrea James News Editor 
There was little enthusiasm in the French House Satur
day night.
The 36 students living in La Maison Francaise on the
Row learned late last week that their theme had been
guillotined by Residential Education. It was a shock and a
disappointment for most of them.
"Sure the house had its problems this year, but no more
than most houses," said senior Ira Daves, a second-year
resident.
"There were personality conflicts and tensions between
people who didn't get along. But it was the theme that was
important and that's what I hate to see go.
"This house was a gathering place for people who enjoy
ihe French culture. It was just as important as the Asian-

American or the Italian theme house," he said.
The house had 40 eating associates, people who didn't
live in the house but who ate all their meals there, chatting
in French and sharing their views on French politics or
telling tales of Stanford campuses in Tours or Paris.
French culture
For David Combs, a first-year resident who said he would
have applied to live in the French House next year, the
residence gave him an opportunity to fit some French lan
guage and culture into his busy schedule.
"1 don't have a lot of time to take French language or
history courses," he said. "Here, I've been able to talk with
eating associates or residents who know a lot about these
subjects, who have been to campuses in France and who can
tell me what France is really like."
And as one other resident put it, "It's the only place

where you can speak French and not be called a snob."
Several residents agreed with Residential Education's
charge that the theme suffered from poor leadership this
year.
For example, the "cuaseries" —sherry hours and discus
sion groups with professors or other guests — dwindled
down to once every two or three weeks instead of the
regularly scheduled Thursday afternoon sessions of last year
and two years ago.
La Creperie, the one big activity the house had planned
for the year, was shelved this quarter due to lack of coopera
tion from volunteer workers.
"There was just no way of ensuring volunteer help,"
explained Daves, the resident in charge of the Saturday
night French cafe. "You just can't run a business that's
going to be that unpredictable. There's no way of making

sure that service is consistent and efficient."
But they argued that absence of leadership is no reason
for stopping the program.
"Next year there will he totally different people here,"
one resident said. "The resident fellow, the house associate
and 14 seniors will he leaving. There's just no justification
for canning this good a program."
John Mason, a co-terminal student who has lived in the
house for two years, agreed that by killing the theme. Resi
dential Education killed the potential for an excellent prog
ram.
"When I lived in the house last year. I found it to be an
exciting, educational place," he said. "There weren't a lot of
activities here this year, but 1 still would have chosen to live
here again next year. There's lots of potential here. It could
be really good."
