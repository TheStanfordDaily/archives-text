1 1 is always useful to view events in perspective.
With that goal in mind, I would like to point out
what $90,000 could he used for:
—Nine extravagant students' total costs for a
year at Stanford;
I he start up costs lor Palo Alto's solar prog
rani, with $15,000 left over;
— Halt the price ol a home in Palo Alto;
—Several years salary for Arieh Loya, former
professor of Arabic and Hebrew at Stanford;
—600 commuter quality bicycles;
len years operating expense for the Stanford
Recycling Center;
l ) 000 monthly passes on Santa Clara County
Transit buses;
Wooden and concrete bollards at numerous
locations on the Stanford campus . . . largely re
placing the metal posts that were admirably serving

their purpose of reducing automobile traffic on
campus. %
1 he white paint and red stripe on the metal posts
made them very visible at night. The subdued green
ot the new bollards may be aesthetic, but as far as
siitety goes, they are a disaster. They are invisible at
night, and the fact that they are two to three times
as wide as the metal posts causes added danger to
bicyclists. The round reflectors recently added do
little to improve the situation.
One wonders whether the installation of the bol
lards began in the summer in order to prevent input
Irom students about the project. Certainly, no
input was solicited prior to the project's implemen
tation.
If the University had $90,000 to throw away, it
seems there are many more worthwhile projects on
which to spend it.
