## IFC failed members' interests 
### 
As an objective observer I
would like to comment on the
Inter-Fraternity Council's
(1.F.C.) recent decision to reject
Penthouse's cur wash offer.
It appears as though the par
ties involved in this decision
managed to lose all touch with
the issue at hand, which is pre
cisely this: do we or do we not
desire the chance to make a sig
nificant contribution to charity at
absolutely no personal expense
to anyone other than Penthouse.
Those who feel that this does
not constitute the central issue
may be correct, but no more cor
rect than I am in asserting that
none of the issues which were
prominent in the recent debate
should have had any bearing on
the decision either.
I heard concern voiced over
the question of who would be

using whom. Others contended
that we are morally and socially
bound to combat sexism at the
most sexually oriented functions
in our society, namely parties.
But most ama/ingly of all. the
totally unsupported contention
that Penthouse perpetuates rape
became the redundant theme of
the highly over-emotional and
overbearing minority which
spearheaded the battle against
the charity car wash.
I cannot forsee the "Carwash
Crusade" in future history books
as a landmark of the feminist
movement. Think about the in
significance of it all.
V have resorted to the above
emotional statements only to
satirically illustrate the purely
emotional foundation on which
the outspoken opposition based
its arguments. They completely

ignored the most recent evidence
coming out of European coun
tries which shows absolutely no
increase in rape frequency sub
sequent to the lifting of pornog
raphy bans.
Furthermore, recent
psychological research (Ger
bhard et al; 1965) tends to clas
sify the act of rape as an expres
sion of aggression rather than a
desire for sexual gratification.
How the dissidents managed to
assert the opposite of these re
search findings as fact during the
debates remains a complete mys
tery.
Enough for being off the sub
ject as much as everyone else,
though. I would further like to
express my dissatisfaction with
the I.F.C.'s inability to pursue
the interests of its members
rather than the nebulous

idealism of some removed spe
cial interest group.
I would also like to add, as an
afterthought, to the opposing
group: Could you not have bet
ter advanced your interests by
permitting the car wash to take
place and then picketing the
party afterwards? In this man
ner, you could have incurred
large expense and discredit to
your real foe. Penthouse, gained
national attention for your pro
tests, and still allowed the I.F.C.
to achieve its original goal of ad
vancing a charitable cause. •
You could have offered the
entire student body the oppor
tunity to express their true sen
timents by their attendance at
the party. You only stood to lose
the credibility of your argu
ments.
