Reward secretaries
I know that somewhere at the
University someone is consider
ing the question of the salary
range for secretaries. However, I
am unable to find out who it is or
what committee is responsible,
and therefore I am hoping to fer
ret out the appropriate person or
committee by writing this letter.
It is my belief that the sec
retaries at the University and the
Medical Center are underpaid. I
also believe that there are
categories of employees per
forming work requiring much
less training, much less sophisti
cation and much less loyalty who
are receiving much more money
than the secretaries receive.
I believe that there should be
an across-the-board increase in
remuneration for secretaries, a
minimum of 10 percent, and it
should be unrelated to the cost of
living allowances or merit in
creases.
The whole classification needs
a boost, and it should be accom
panied by an official statement
acknowledging that the increase
is in recognition true worth
of the secretaries.
I know there have been discus
sions about unionization of sec
retaries, but I believe this would
be a terrible outcome, and would
significantly change the relation
ship between supervisors and
secretaries. It is my understand

ing that the major issue in these
discussions relates to salary, and
I can understand the secretaries'
frustrations.
I hope this letter will provoke
some discussion, and will ulti
mately result in improved com
pensation for all secretaries at
the University and the Medical
Center.

In my Feb. 21 column in the
Daily, I suggested that we con
sider the function of language
study. Nothing has been more
detrimental to foreign language
study at Stanford than the petty
distinction we have made bet
ween first-year "skill" courses
and subsequent "intellectual
content" courses.
In any important form of
learning, can we really pinpoint
the fine lines that exist between
the use of intellect and the use of
other faculties? Can we be so
presumptuous as to assume that
even the most scientific discip
lines do not call upon imagina
tion, sensitivity and even
memorization?
The acquisition of foreign lan
guage proficiency is a rich and
meaningful experience in itself
and like other disciplines, it
draws upon many forms of

awareness. Instead of wasting
our time on futile distinctions be
tween what is or is not intellec
tual, let us view language study
as an integrated structure that
cannot possibly exist without a
strong lirst-year foundation.
Then we will be able to argue
tor the restoration ol the lan
guage requirement.

ERA/draft questions
President and Mrs. Jimmy
Carter have both supported draft
registration for women but indi
cated that, if drafted, women
should be excluded from combat
duty. Isn't this exactly the type of
discrimination that would be il
legal if the Equal Rights
Amendment passed?
An Israeli officer once told me
that even though Israeli women
are subject to the draft, officers
prefer not to use them for com
bat duty. They feel that 1) in
general women would be at a
disadvantage in hand-to-hand
combat situations, 2) there is a
very high likelihood that they
would be repeatedly raped, if
captured,and 3) in extended bat
tle situations, they tend to be
under pressure from their male
counterparts to perform sexual
favors.
Would the ERA allow U.S. of

ficers discretionary power to
exclude women from combat
duty if it seemed prudent?
Can anyone really answer
these questions or must we wait
for the specific rules and regula
tions to be handed down by a
regulatory agency? Which
agency would it be — a new one
with judicial power similar to
OS HA? Would there be a vote
on those regulations? Or, by pas
sing the ERA, would we give the
agency a blank check?

Supporters of the ERA cite its
simplicity to be its real beauty
and power. Might it not also be
its danger? It would not allow
discrimination for any reason,
even if it's prudent (combat
duty), reasonable (rape litiga
tion), or perhaps even desired by
everyone involved (separate
men's and women's athletic
programs).

Languages vital
In my Feb. 21 column in the
Daily, I suggested that we con
sider the function of language
study. Nothing has been more
detrimental to foreign language
study at Stanford than the petty
distinction we have made bet
ween first-year "skill" courses
and subsequent "intellectual
content" courses.
In any important form of
learning, can we really pinpoint
the fine lines that exist between
the use of intellect and the use of
other faculties? Can we be so
presumptuous as to assume that
even the most scientific discip
lines do not call upon imagina
tion, sensitivity and even
memorization?
The acquisition of foreign lan
guage proficiency is a rich and
meaningful experience in itself
and like other disciplines, it
draws upon many forms of

awareness. Instead of wasting
our time on futile distinctions be
tween what is or is not intellec
tual, let us view language study
as an integrated structure that
cannot possibly exist without a
strong lirst-year foundation.
Then we will be able to argue
tor the restoration ol the lan
guage requirement.

ERA/draft questions
President and Mrs. Jimmy
Carter have both supported draft
registration for women but indi
cated that, if drafted, women
should be excluded from combat
duty. Isn't this exactly the type of
discrimination that would be il
legal if the Equal Rights
Amendment passed?
An Israeli officer once told me
that even though Israeli women
are subject to the draft, officers
prefer not to use them for com
bat duty. They feel that 1) in
general women would be at a
disadvantage in hand-to-hand
combat situations, 2) there is a
very high likelihood that they
would be repeatedly raped, if
captured,and 3) in extended bat
tle situations, they tend to be
under pressure from their male
counterparts to perform sexual
favors.
Would the ERA allow U.S. of

ficers discretionary power to
exclude women from combat
duty if it seemed prudent?
Can anyone really answer
these questions or must we wait
for the specific rules and regula
tions to be handed down by a
regulatory agency? Which
agency would it be — a new one
with judicial power similar to
OS HA? Would there be a vote
on those regulations? Or, by pas
sing the ERA, would we give the
agency a blank check?

Supporters of the ERA cite its
simplicity to be its real beauty
and power. Might it not also be
its danger? It would not allow
discrimination for any reason,
even if it's prudent (combat
duty), reasonable (rape litiga
tion), or perhaps even desired by
everyone involved (separate
men's and women's athletic
programs).

Reward secretaries
I know that somewhere at the
University someone is consider
ing the question of the salary
range for secretaries. However, I
am unable to find out who it is or
what committee is responsible,
and therefore I am hoping to fer
ret out the appropriate person or
committee by writing this letter.
It is my belief that the sec
retaries at the University and the
Medical Center are underpaid. I
also believe that there are
categories of employees per
forming work requiring much
less training, much less sophisti
cation and much less loyalty who
are receiving much more money
than the secretaries receive.
I believe that there should be
an across-the-board increase in
remuneration for secretaries, a
minimum of 10 percent, and it
should be unrelated to the cost of
living allowances or merit in
creases.
The whole classification needs
a boost, and it should be accom
panied by an official statement
acknowledging that the increase
is in recognition true worth
of the secretaries.
I know there have been discus
sions about unionization of sec
retaries, but I believe this would
be a terrible outcome, and would
significantly change the relation
ship between supervisors and
secretaries. It is my understand

ing that the major issue in these
discussions relates to salary, and
I can understand the secretaries'
frustrations.
I hope this letter will provoke
some discussion, and will ulti
mately result in improved com
pensation for all secretaries at
the University and the Medical
Center.
