# Green library gets Hernmarck tapestry
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Fiberarts magazine has called
her "an artist whose work appe
als to just about everyone . . . (it)
speaks in some kind of 'Univer
sal' language."
Helena Hernmarck, currently
one of the foremost weavers in
the world has "spoken" to the
Stanford community in a tapes
try she simply calls Wordscape,
now hanging in the new east wing
l! ' of Green Library.
"It was our idea to have a
'' major work of art in the stairwell
'of the library." said Phyllis

Martin-Vegue. an interior de
sign consultant for the Univer
sity. Martin-Vegue was respon
sible for obtaining the work of
the highly sought after Swedish
designer.
Hernmarck's tapestries hang
in banks, corporate offices and
museums both in the United
States and in Europe. Although
she has lived in several different
countries, she and her husband
Niels Diffrient, an industrial
designer, now liv e and work in a
renovated loft studio in New
York.
Some of her more famous
pieces have included a tapestry
entitled Rain toresl for the
Weyerhauser Corporation, and a
massive piece called Sailing
which was exhibited in the Na
tional Museum in Stockholm.
Sweden.
Trips here
, After she was commissioned
to do the Green Library tapestry.

Hernmarck visited Stanford
twice to preview the space where
it would hang and get a feel for
what kind of design would be ap
propriate.
"When choosing the theme for
the Stanford University tapestry,
it was immediately clear to me
that it would be interesting to
work with the printed word."
Hernmarck stated in a written
description of her composition.
I he finished product involves
words and fragments of sen
tences on a landscape-type
background. The texts are taken
from Dante, Hamlet and the Bi-

hie.
The words and fragments were
not chosen for their meanings,
she said. "I'm only concerned
with the form of the letters rather
than their meanings."
Hanging occurs
The 39-foot tapestry was hung
last Tuesday in the main stairwell
of the new library wing.
Mounted on a maple wood
background, the piece is done
predominantly in shades of blue,
gray and light greens. These
tones were chosen, according to
Hernmarek who flew out from
New York to supervise the hang
ing. "to fit the scheme used for
other furnishings in the build
ing."
"To bring in color and depth
to the composition. I added
pieces of landscape. These arc
seen from afar, since the stairs,
where the tapestry hangs, give
the viewer a floating viewpoint,
where you have no sense of top

or bottom. However, it was more
important to end it on a more
solid feeling; therefore, the land
is at the bottom. Halfway up in
the tapestry I put a tree as a re
ference to the tree of know
ledge," she explained.
Hernmarck is most famous for
a weaving technique labelled
"photorealism." She takes a
photoenlargement of a photo
graph and virtually reproduces it
on a large scale in her tapestries.
The effect is amazingly realistic,
especially the further one gets
from the design. It is present in
Wordscape only near the bot
tom.
Different technique
Hernmarck said she was glad
to have had the opportunity to
use a "rosepath" technique in
Wordscape which is less rep
resentative than the primarily
photorealistic weaving she has
done in the past few years.
Her adherence to realism in
most of her tapestries has caused
some in the art world to label her
a craftsman rather than an artist.
"I would like to think of my-

self as a craftsman, but I think
people should stop worrying
about titles and just do good
quality work," she said.
Holy controversy
In the middle of the Green Lib
rary tapestry is a section with the
word "HOLY" written promi
nently. Hernmarek explained
that in her original design, that
section was to contain only a
fragment of the two words,
"Holy Bible" which would read
"OLY B." When the University
noticed this in the design, they
asked her to alter it.
"I didn't realize the beer out
here was called OLY so I was
happy to change it," she said.
"They were afraid the students
might write on the wall."
This is only the second tapes
try Hernmarek has done for a
university. The first was for Case
Western Law School in Cleve
land, Ohio.
"It's nice to have a tapestry

hanging in a library for students
to see," she said. "Most of my
works are on the executive floors
of corporations."
Immediate approval
Martin-Vegue first presented
the concept of securing a
Hernmarck tapestry for the lib
rary to the Office of Planning
and to Director of Libraries
David Weber about two years
ago. It received immediate ap
proval.

The University paid about
$24,000 for the tapestry out ol
the furnishing budget forthe new
library wing. The Office of De
velopment had considered
financing the artwork as a gift to
the University because of its

"concept and relationship to the
library," according to Roger
Cairns, project manager tor
Facilities and Planning, hut this
plan did not matcriali/e.
Despite the seemingly high
price, I Jernmarck said she barely
made a profit on the piece. Her
usual fees have been quoted at
around $400 pci square loot.
For the 39 by 5 foot tapestry, this

would have amounted to
$78,000.
"Ph> 11 is ( Martin-Vegue)
talked me into doing it for less. It
ruined my eeonomy for last year,
hut there is a certain amount of
prestige and PR about having
your work hang in Stanford Uni
versity," she said.
Two sections
Hernmarck designed the
tapestry so that it would he faster
to weave than her usual pieces.
As it was. it took her and two
assistants IS weeks to complete
the work.
The tapestry was woven in two
sections, side-by-side on
Hernmarck's 11-foot loom so
that it would be easier to trans
port and hang correctly. But
when the workmen began to fas
ten the work to the wall last
Monday, a problem arose.
The hooks which support the
tapestry had to be sunk into the
concrete prior to the hanging and
a mistake was made in the spac
ing. Usually the hooks are not
installed until the piece is hung,
Hernmarck said. The two sec-

tions ol the tapestry were to fit
together, but the hooks created
about a foot and a half gap bet
ween them.
Hernmarck was \isibl\ upset
by the problem.
•Cairns, however, assured the
artist I uesday that the problem
would be corrected and said
Thursday that the correction had
been made.

Another difficulty arose in the
lighting on the stairs. "The light
ing is the most important thing."
s;iid Hernmarck. She was con
cerned thiit the "top lighting"
had an undesirable effect on the
work. "You can see too much of
a texture. It almost looks like
pearled stitches. You can't even
read the words." she said.
Cairns said that the library
stall would be asked to complv
with Hernmarck's wishes and
that except for "unusually dark
days" the problem lights would
he turned off.
Personal touches
Hernmarck clearly seems to be
a dedicated and talented artist
worthy of the praise and acclaim
gi\ en her. As she stood super\ is
ing the hanging (at one point she
mounted the scaffolding herselt
to make sure the tapestry was
hung correctly), several students
and library staff persons ap
proached her to say how much

they liked Wordscape. To
each of them Hernmarck would
say. "Thank you. but it's ,not
right yet," and explain the spac
ing and lighting problems, not
wanting anyone to think thaLher
work was less than perfect.
Despite her misgivings, sev -
eral persons were heard to say,
"I never would have realized
that anything was wrong." r-
But by that time Hernmarck
would be gone, at another level
checking the lighting, or talking
to workmen about what could be
done about the hooks.
ft
After waiting for years to sec
ure a piece of Helena
Hernmarck's work, Martin-
Yeguc summed it up." It looks so
beautiful, it's so exciting to ti
nally see it up there." she sighed.
Hernmarck will return to
Stanford in July to speak a
design conference sponsored by
the Alumni Association.

Two sections
Hernmarck designed the
tapestry so that it would he faster
to weave than her usual pieces.
As it was. it took her and two
assistants IS weeks to complete
the work.
The tapestry was woven in two
sections, side-by-side on
Hernmarck's 11-foot loom so
that it would be easier to trans
port and hang correctly. But
when the workmen began to fas
ten the work to the wall last
Monday, a problem arose.
The hooks which support the
tapestry had to be sunk into the
concrete prior to the hanging and
a mistake was made in the spac

installed until the piece is hung,
Hernmarck said. The two sec-

together, but the hooks created
about a foot and a half gap bet

Hernmarck was \isibl\ upset

Helena Hernmarck, currently
one of the foremost weavers in
the world has "spoken" to the
Stanford community in a tapes
try she simply calls Wordscape,
now hanging in the new east wing
l! ' of Green Library.
"It was our idea to have a

Martin-Vegue. an interior de

sible for obtaining the work of
the highly sought after Swedish
designer.
Hernmarck's tapestries hang
in banks, corporate offices and
museums both in the United
States and in Europe. Although
she has lived in several different
countries, she and her husband
Niels Diffrient, an industrial
designer, now liv e and work in a

pieces have included a tapestry

Trips here
, After she was commissioned
to do the Green Library tapestry.

Hernmarck visited Stanford
twice to preview the space where
it would hang and get a feel for
what kind of design would be ap
propriate.
"When choosing the theme for
the Stanford University tapestry,
it was immediately clear to me
that it would be interesting to
work with the printed word."
Hernmarck stated in a written
description of her composition.
I he finished product involves
words and fragments of sen
tences on a landscape-type
background. The texts are taken
from Dante, Hamlet and the Bi-

hie.
The words and fragments were
not chosen for their meanings,
she said. "I'm only concerned
with the form of the letters rather
than their meanings."
Hanging occurs
The 39-foot tapestry was hung
last Tuesday in the main stairwell
of the new library wing.
Mounted on a maple wood
background, the piece is done
predominantly in shades of blue,
gray and light greens. These
tones were chosen, according to
Hernmarek who flew out from
New York to supervise the hang
ing. "to fit the scheme used for
other furnishings in the build
ing."
"To bring in color and depth
to the composition. I added
pieces of landscape. These arc
seen from afar, since the stairs,
where the tapestry hangs, give
the viewer a floating viewpoint,
where you have no sense of top

or bottom. However, it was more
important to end it on a more
solid feeling; therefore, the land
is at the bottom. Halfway up in
the tapestry I put a tree as a re
ference to the tree of know
ledge," she explained.
Hernmarck is most famous for
a weaving technique labelled
"photorealism." She takes a
photoenlargement of a photo
graph and virtually reproduces it
on a large scale in her tapestries.
The effect is amazingly realistic,
especially the further one gets
from the design. It is present in
Wordscape only near the bot
tom.
Different technique
Hernmarck said she was glad
to have had the opportunity to
use a "rosepath" technique in
Wordscape which is less rep
resentative than the primarily
photorealistic weaving she has
done in the past few years.
Her adherence to realism in
most of her tapestries has caused
some in the art world to label her
a craftsman rather than an artist.
"I would like to think of my-

self as a craftsman, but I think
people should stop worrying
about titles and just do good
quality work," she said.
Holy controversy
In the middle of the Green Lib
rary tapestry is a section with the
word "HOLY" written promi
nently. Hernmarek explained
that in her original design, that
section was to contain only a
fragment of the two words,
"Holy Bible" which would read
"OLY B." When the University
noticed this in the design, they
asked her to alter it.
"I didn't realize the beer out
here was called OLY so I was
happy to change it," she said.
"They were afraid the students
might write on the wall."
This is only the second tapes
try Hernmarek has done for a
university. The first was for Case
Western Law School in Cleve
land, Ohio.
"It's nice to have a tapestry

hanging in a library for students
to see," she said. "Most of my
works are on the executive floors
of corporations."

Trips here
, After she was commissioned
to do the Green Library tapestry.

Hernmarck visited Stanford
twice to preview the space where
it would hang and get a feel for
what kind of design would be ap
propriate.
"When choosing the theme for
the Stanford University tapestry,
it was immediately clear to me
that it would be interesting to
work with the printed word."
Hernmarck stated in a written
description of her composition.
I he finished product involves
words and fragments of sen
tences on a landscape-type
background. The texts are taken
from Dante, Hamlet and the Bi-

hie.
The words and fragments were
not chosen for their meanings,
she said. "I'm only concerned
with the form of the letters rather
than their meanings."
Hanging occurs
The 39-foot tapestry was hung
last Tuesday in the main stairwell
of the new library wing.
Mounted on a maple wood
background, the piece is done
predominantly in shades of blue,
gray and light greens. These
tones were chosen, according to
Hernmarek who flew out from
New York to supervise the hang
ing. "to fit the scheme used for
other furnishings in the build
ing."
"To bring in color and depth
to the composition. I added
pieces of landscape. These arc
seen from afar, since the stairs,
where the tapestry hangs, give
the viewer a floating viewpoint,
where you have no sense of top

or bottom. However, it was more
important to end it on a more
solid feeling; therefore, the land
is at the bottom. Halfway up in
the tapestry I put a tree as a re
ference to the tree of know
ledge," she explained.
Hernmarck is most famous for
a weaving technique labelled
"photorealism." She takes a
photoenlargement of a photo
graph and virtually reproduces it
on a large scale in her tapestries.
The effect is amazingly realistic,
especially the further one gets
from the design. It is present in
Wordscape only near the bot
tom.
Different technique
Hernmarck said she was glad
to have had the opportunity to
use a "rosepath" technique in
Wordscape which is less rep
resentative than the primarily
photorealistic weaving she has
done in the past few years.
Her adherence to realism in
most of her tapestries has caused
some in the art world to label her
a craftsman rather than an artist.
"I would like to think of my-

self as a craftsman, but I think
people should stop worrying
about titles and just do good
quality work," she said.
Holy controversy
In the middle of the Green Lib
rary tapestry is a section with the
word "HOLY" written promi
nently. Hernmarek explained
that in her original design, that
section was to contain only a
fragment of the two words,
"Holy Bible" which would read
"OLY B." When the University
noticed this in the design, they
asked her to alter it.
"I didn't realize the beer out
here was called OLY so I was
happy to change it," she said.
"They were afraid the students
might write on the wall."
This is only the second tapes
try Hernmarek has done for a
university. The first was for Case
Western Law School in Cleve
land, Ohio.
"It's nice to have a tapestry

hanging in a library for students
to see," she said. "Most of my
works are on the executive floors
of corporations."
Immediate approval
Martin-Vegue first presented
the concept of securing a
Hernmarck tapestry for the lib
rary to the Office of Planning
and to Director of Libraries
David Weber about two years
ago. It received immediate ap
proval.

The University paid about
$24,000 for the tapestry out ol
the furnishing budget forthe new
library wing. The Office of De
velopment had considered
financing the artwork as a gift to
the University because of its

"concept and relationship to the
library," according to Roger
Cairns, project manager tor
Facilities and Planning, hut this
plan did not matcriali/e.
Despite the seemingly high
price, I Jernmarck said she barely
made a profit on the piece. Her
usual fees have been quoted at
around $400 pci square loot.
For the 39 by 5 foot tapestry, this

would have amounted to
$78,000.
"Ph> 11 is ( Martin-Vegue)
talked me into doing it for less. It
ruined my eeonomy for last year,
hut there is a certain amount of
prestige and PR about having
your work hang in Stanford Uni
versity," she said.
Two sections
Hernmarck designed the
tapestry so that it would he faster
to weave than her usual pieces.
As it was. it took her and two
assistants IS weeks to complete
the work.
The tapestry was woven in two
sections, side-by-side on
Hernmarck's 11-foot loom so
that it would be easier to trans
port and hang correctly. But
when the workmen began to fas
ten the work to the wall last
Monday, a problem arose.
The hooks which support the
tapestry had to be sunk into the
concrete prior to the hanging and
a mistake was made in the spac
ing. Usually the hooks are not
installed until the piece is hung,
Hernmarck said. The two sec-

tions ol the tapestry were to fit
together, but the hooks created
about a foot and a half gap bet
ween them.
Hernmarck was \isibl\ upset
by the problem.
•Cairns, however, assured the
artist I uesday that the problem
would be corrected and said
Thursday that the correction had
been made.

Another difficulty arose in the
lighting on the stairs. "The light
ing is the most important thing."
s;iid Hernmarck. She was con
cerned thiit the "top lighting"
had an undesirable effect on the
work. "You can see too much of
a texture. It almost looks like
pearled stitches. You can't even
read the words." she said.
Cairns said that the library
stall would be asked to complv
with Hernmarck's wishes and
that except for "unusually dark
days" the problem lights would
he turned off.
Personal touches
Hernmarck clearly seems to be
a dedicated and talented artist
worthy of the praise and acclaim
gi\ en her. As she stood super\ is
ing the hanging (at one point she
mounted the scaffolding herselt
to make sure the tapestry was
hung correctly), several students
and library staff persons ap
proached her to say how much

they liked Wordscape. To
each of them Hernmarck would
say. "Thank you. but it's ,not
right yet," and explain the spac
ing and lighting problems, not
wanting anyone to think thaLher
work was less than perfect.
Despite her misgivings, sev -
eral persons were heard to say,
"I never would have realized
that anything was wrong." r-
But by that time Hernmarck
would be gone, at another level
checking the lighting, or talking
to workmen about what could be
done about the hooks.
ft
After waiting for years to sec
ure a piece of Helena
Hernmarck's work, Martin-
Yeguc summed it up." It looks so
beautiful, it's so exciting to ti
nally see it up there." she sighed.
Hernmarck will return to
Stanford in July to speak a
design conference sponsored by
the Alumni Association.

Helena Hernmarck, currently

the highly sought after Swedish
designer.
