WASHINGTON — Despite a
sharp decline in oil imports, the
nation's trade deficit increased in
January to $4.K billion, the high
est level in two years, the Com
merce Department reported last
week.
Last month's deficit was up
from the $4.1 billion by which
imports exceeded exports in De
cember.
It was the largest since a $5.2
billion deficit in February 197N
and was the second highest since
the department began keeping
this series of statistics six years
ago.
The deficit worsened even
though oil imports fell 9 percent
from December to 235 million
barrels in January and the value
fell 4 percent to $6.5 billion.
Courtcnay Slater, chief Com
merce Department economist.

blamed "a large increase in im
ports of manufactured goods and
some drop in exports of agricul
tural commodities." She added
that "imports of aircraft, office
machinery, telecommunications
equipment, automobiles and
non-ferris metals — particularly
copper and nickel — showed
substantial increases."
The trade totals were derived
by a method of calculation that
previously was not emphasized
by the Commerce Department
The Trade Agreements Act
passed by Congress last year now
requires the department to in
clude the cost of insurance and
shipping when reporting the
value of imports. These costs are
not included in valuation of ex
ports. however. This tends to
overstate the value of imports
and. thus, overstates any deficit
and understates any surplus.
