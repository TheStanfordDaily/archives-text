# Colombians meet with guerrillas

### Charles Krause The Washington Post 
BOGOTA, Columbia — Represen
tatives of the Colombian government
met for the first time yesterday with
leftist guerillas holding more than 40
hostages, and the guerrillas then freed
five more of their captives.
The initial negotiating session, last
ing 90 minutes, was held in a police van
parked otside the Dominican Embassy
that the guerrillas seized during a re
ception last Wednesday.
While the hostages include 14 am
bassadors and numerous other dip
lomats, those released included four
waiters and a doctor. With the women
and wounded released earlier, 23 hos
tages have been freed.
Representing the government were
Camilo Jimenez Villalba and Ramiro
Zambrano, both high-ranking officials
in the Foreign Ministry. They met with
one of the guerrillas, her head covered
by a white hood to prevent identifica
tion; and Mexican Ambassador
Ricardo Galan, one of the envoys
among the hostages.
Neither side gave details of the first
round of negotiations nor said when
another session would occur.
10th communique
The Columbian government issued
its 10th communique since the crisis
began, saying only that the M-19 guer
rillas formally presented their demands
and that the government had expressed
its desire to resolve the tense situation
as quickly as possible and achieve the
sate release of the hostages "with re
spect for tne constitution and laws" of

Colombia.
The guerrillas' principal demand is
that 311 political prisoners, more than
200 of them members of the M-19, be
freed from Colombian jails and flown
out of the country in exchange for the
remaining hostages, among them U.S.
Ambassador Diego Asencio.
Jurists and government officials are
debating whether President Julio Cesar
Turbay Ayala could legally agree to
release the prisoners, even if he de
cided he wanted to do so.
It is believed that the M-19 com
mando force still holds about 40 hos
tages, among them the ambassadors of
the Dominican Republic, the United
States, Brazil, Mexico, Uruguay, Ven
ezuela, Guatemala, Austria, Switzer
land, El Salvador, Haiti, Egypt, Israel
and the Vatican.
'Flexibility?'
Frank Perez, the deputy director of
the State Department's office to com
bat terrorism — sent from Washington
shortly after the siege began — said
yesterday that the guerrillas' decision
to release more hostages "may indicate
that the terrorists find it easier to main
tain fewer number of hostages (or) it
could indicate that they're showing
some flexibility."
About an hour before the negotia
tions began, police killed at least one
occupant of a car that entered the zone
surrounding the embassy, reportedly
having ignored warnings to halt. It was
not immediately clear if the car's oc
cupants had any connection with the
siege.
Perez said that the United States has

so far not tried to influence the Colom
bian government's policies or conduct
since the takeover other than to inform
the government here that "we would
not want (it) to do anything precipitous
to endanger the lives of the hostages."
No ransom
Perez said that it is U.S. policy not to
pay ransom for American government
personnel kidnapped or held hostage,
either in the United States or abroad,
nor to release prisoners to satisfy guer
rillas' demands.
Perez said that he believes the M-19
guerrillas inside the Dominican Repub
lic's embassy are "a very disciplined
terrorist group." He characterized the
embassy takeover Wednesday as "a
very well-planned operation" and said
that he believes the M-19's"goal is to
bring down the Colombian govern
ment."
The situation now, Perez said, ap
pears to have stabilized somewhat and
"the longer these things go on, the bet
ter the chance the hostages have of
coming out alive." This, he said, is be
cause of psychological affinities that
develop between guerrillas and their
hostages and vice versa which makes it
more difficult to carry out death
threats.
Perez stressed that the United
States' most important concern now is
to avoid another incident like the one
that occurred last year in Afghanistan
when U.S. Ambassador Adolf (Spike)
Dubbs was killed when Afghani troops
rushed a hotel where the ambassador
was sequestered against the advice and
wishes of the United States.
