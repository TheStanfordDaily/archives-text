i.'Kimberly Belton saved his
'"■-best for last. In his final appear
ance before the fans at Maples
Pavilion. Belton took control of
r, 'the game and led the Cardinals
• >'4o a 93-91 overtime victory
against the Trojans from USC.
The senior forward scored a
career-high 41 points, grabbed
14 rebounds and had his name
inscribes into the record books a
.few more times with other
achievements.
W ith almost two minutes ex
pired in the second half. Belton
became the number-one re
bounder in Stanford history,
breaking Rich Kellev's record of
944.
His basket with 6:02 remain
ing in the game made Belton
only the fourth player in
•.((Pacific-10 history to score over
niMOO points in conference play,
jd ,Records are one thing, how
ever, and a victory is another. As
, Belton said Thursday evening
■following Stanford's loss to
,i>UCLA, "It's nice to break a re
:i'.cord, but when you lose while
■ you're doing it. it takes away a lot
/u af the joy."

Stanford's scoring king was
able to savor both his records
and a win as the Cards improved
their league record to 5-13 and
finished the season tied with
USC and Oregon for seventh
place.
The game was played with
plenty of emotion, if not preci
sion, as four Cardinals took to
the floor for the last time. Be
sides Belton. Daryle Morgan
(who has been out of action since
the fifth game of the season).
Tom Schmalzried and Doug
Barnes were honored before the
game for their past seasons of
Stanford basketball.
Down by as many as 14 in the
second half, the Cards seemed to
be sparked by their emotions.
With some gutsy play, they came
to tie the score at 84 with 43
seconds remaining in the game
and put the contest into over
time.
Stanford controlled the tip and
Belton promptly canned a 17-
footer — his third outside
jumper of the game. Southern
Cal missed the next time down
and Mr. Belton answered with
another two — this time a driving
lay-up. Momentum had totally

swung to Stanford and the Tro
jans called a time-out.
The Cards came out playing
tenacious defense and Don Car
fino. SCs money player all even
ing, traveled with just under
four minutes reading on the
clock.
Stanford had its share of luck.
As Belton missed a 15-footer,
the Trojan rebounder slipped
out-of-bounds. The Cards were
quick to take advantage as Brian
Welch hit Belton for another
score and a 90-84 Stanford lead
with 2:23 remaining.
The cagers must have then fi
gured that the fans hadn't had
enough excitement and that an
easy victory would just be antic
limactic.
Terry Smith fouled out with
2:09 left and thus Doug Marty
became the only skilled ball
handler on the court for the
Cards. He was fouled by Carfino
but a lane violation gave the ball
back to the Trojans. Barry
Brooks converted one of two
free throws following a Belton
foul and the score read 90-85
with 1:51 to go.
Southern California must not
have wanted to spoil the seniors'

farewell, also, as they failed to
take advantage of Stanford
blunders.
Marty threw the ball away but
Maurice Williams fouled him
going up for the shot. Marty con
verted one of the two penalty
shots and the Trojans found
themselves six down instead of
pulling within three.
Welch, who was playing with a
hurt tendon for the last 10 mi
nutes of the contest, had the ball
stolen by Carfino who made the
lay-up and cut the lead to 91-87
with 1:13 to go.
After a Trojan time out,
Welch again turned it over by
traveling and Carfino again
sunk a jumper to narrow the lead
to 91-89 with 49 seconds left on
the clock.
SC had a prime opportunity to
tie the score as Stanford threw
the ball away once again. Carfino

was called for carrying over,
however, and the Cards had
another lease on life.
Welch was fouled with 22 sec
onds remaining and he con
verted both attempts to pad the
lead, 93-89. The Trojans co
verted a one-and-one with 14
seconds to go and Orlando Ward
missed his attempt after being
fouled but Stanford's defense
prevailed and the contest ended
with Stanford a two-point victor.
USC totally dominated first
half action as Carfino and his
cohorts iook out on the Cards
their frustrations from the loss to
Cal on Thursday. Belton's and
Welch's 11 points kept the game
from becoming history as the
Cards were down by eight,
46-38, at halftime.
Both teams played in spurts
during the opening minutes of
the final period but an inspired

Belton led the Cards gradual yet
deliberate comeback.
Besides Welch's 21, Marty
turned in another tremendous
performance with 13 points and
8 assists. Jeff Ryan also shined
with eight points in 25 minutes of
reserve action.
The evening, however, was
undoubtedly Belton's. Perhaps
the greatest player to wear a
Stanford uniform, he combined
total physical exertion with 100
percent mental and emotional
preparation.
So a great player leaves a not
so-great team. Commenting on
the victory and the season, Bel
ton said, "It (the win) doesn't
make up for the season entirely,
but it makes it a whole lot swee
ter." And after four years of
more downs than ups. Kimberly
Belton leaves Stanford the,way
he should — a winner.





Senior forward kimberly Belton illustrates the graceful yet powerful art
of the slam dunk in Thursday's game against UCLA. That night he

became Stanford's all-time scoring leader, surpassing Claude Terry. Last
night Belton led the Cards to a 93-91 overtime against USC. Scoring a

career-high 4 1 points, he became only the fourth player in Pac-10 history
to score more than 1000 points in league play.
