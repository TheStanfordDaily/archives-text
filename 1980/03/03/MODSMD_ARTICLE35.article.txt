# Card-9 take two from No. 3 Wildcats
## 
### Cathy Dickerson Staff Writer 
If they continue to do what
they did this weekend, it's going
to be tough for any team in the
Southern Division of the Pac-10
to stop the 1980 Cardinals from
going all the way to the league
playoffs in May.
The Card-9 defeated the No. 3
rated University of Arizona
Wildcats twice this weekend,
10-6 Friday and 8-6 Saturday, in
the opening games of league
play.
Rain yesterday prevented the
two teams from playing the third
and final game of the scheduled
three-game series, but it is to be
made up today at 1 p.m. if the
soggy infield at Sunken
Diamond has dried out by that
time.
If bad weather conditions can
cel the game today, Stanford will
have to plan on playing four in
stead of three games when it
travels to Tucson the weekend of

April 18: something Cardinal
head coach Mark Marquess de
finitely does not want to do.
Stanford would he at an obvious
disadvantage pitching-wise if
that were to occur.
After the two victories this
weekend. Marquess said. "We
couldn't have asked for a better
beginning in league play. Now
we just have to see if the younger
players can maintain it (the cur
rent level of play). Consistency,"
he added, "is what's important
when you have 30 league games
to play."
Extra-base hits were the key
to both of the Cards' victories
this weekend. Arizona either
matched or out-hit Stanford in
both of the games, but of the
Cardinals' 16 hits in the two
games, nine were for extra bases.
Four of these were home runs.
Friday, nine hits produced 10
runs for Stanford, but the same
number produced only six runs
for Arizona. Saturday it took

only seven hits for the Cards to
make eight runs and win the
game, while the Wildcats had 12
hits but again only scored six
times. In the two games Arizona
stranded 22 runners on base as
compared to Stanford's nine.
"We continued to put men on
base, but the middle of the lineup
wasn't able to bring them in,"
Arizona head coach Jerry Kin
dall explained. "We were too
sloppy on the field too," he con
tinued. "Stanford deserves to be
2-0 in the series; they've out
played us," he admitted.
One minor change in the
lineup that Marquess used dur
ing pre-season play proved ex
tremely beneficial to the Cards'
offensive performance this
weekend.
Veteran second baseman Paul
Zuvella moved up from third in
the batting order to first. In the
two games batting lead-off,
Zuvella went three-for-six, had
three RBI and scored three

times.
Other variations in the Cardi
nal batting lineup were due to
Arizona's principally left
handed pitching squad. Seven
out of their bullpen's 1 1 pitchers
are left-handed.
Thus, Marquess substituted
right handed hitters Darrell
Stephens and Phil Wilson for
John Elway and Mike Aldrete in
the outfield and used freshman
right-hander Eric Hardgrave as
designated hitter in Friday's
game when left-handed Wildcat
Craig Lefferts was on the
mound.
Hardgrave earned a spot in
Saturday's game after going
two-for-three Friday with one of
his hits being a solo home run tp
straight-away center field in the
sixth inning. Hardgrave played
first base Saturday and belted
another solo home run in one of
his three trips to the plate. I
With a right-hander pitching
Saturday, Dave Dacus filled the
DH spot, and Elway and Aldrete
took the outfifcld.
Freshman Aldrete made a key
contribution to Saturday's Car
dinal victory with his second
home run of the year — a two
run shot over the left center field
fence to highlight the four-run
fourth inning that put the Cards
ahead to stay.
In that fourth inning, Stanford
was trailing 5-3. With one out,
Elway was walked. Outfielder
Mike Toothman singled Elway
to third and Zuvella then dou
bled into the right power alley
scoring both Elway and Tooth
man. Aldrete did his damage
after watching two balls go b\.
He hit the third pitch that he saw
out of the park for the third and
fourth runs of the inning.
Hardgrave"s solo homer in the
eighth gave Stanford a somewhat
more secure two-run edge
Arizona had shaved to one ear
lier when the Cats scored a single
run off reliever George Lope/ in
their half of the sixth.
Lopez entered the game in the
fifth inning in relief of senior
staffer Larry Kuhn. He was cre
dited with the win after pitching
four full innings and leaving the
last two outs lit the game to Bob
Boatman.
Stanford pitching coach Tom
Dunton was extremely pleased
with the pitchers' performances

this weekend. "They really ne
gated their (Arizona's) hig hit
ters," he said He has great con
fidence in the Card bullpen, and
with the relievers pitching the
way they have been. Dunton
says,"The starters aren't going
to have many complete games
this year."
