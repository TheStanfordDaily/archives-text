## Tracksters edge Fresno 
### 
The Stanford men's track
team squeaked out a victory
against Fresno State Saturday,
84-79. Gordon Banks and Bill
Gail won two events each to pace
the Cards past the Bulldogs, hut
it wasn't until it won the last two
events that Stanford had the
meet secured.
"Essentially, we got off," said
Stanford coach Brooks Johnson.
"We went ahead on those last
two (the 400 relay and the mile
relay) but the team had the fact
that we were behind on their
minds for all the meet before
that."

brightest stars for Stanford as

they edged Fresno. Banks won
the 200 meter and 400 meter
races at 21.56 and 48.03 respec

Banks in the 200. Margerum
