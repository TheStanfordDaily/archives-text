The Stanford women's tennis
team increased its undefeated
season record to 4-0 with an easy
N-l victory over Fresno State
Saturday. The Cardinals picked
up victories in five singles
matched and all the doubles
matches to coast to the easy win.
Head coach Frank Brennan
was "pretty happy" with the win,
but would have liked the shut
out. "I'm kind of disappointed
with the one loss because Lisa
(Ciordon) didn't play particu
larly well. It's always tough to
lose, but I think she learned a lot
from the match."
Aside from Gordon's loss and
a three-set comeback by Andrea
Markl playing the number six
singles spot, the Cards won their
matches handily.
Number one singles player,
Donna Rubin, easily beat
Shawna Goedhard 6-0, 6-1.
Brennan remarked,"Playing the
number one spot is always a
tough match, no matter who
you're playing. Donna has been
playing it for us all year and has
been doing a real good job. Her
points are always long and her
matches are always long, but it
seems they're always shaking
hands with Donna having a 6-0
or 6-1 win in straight sets."
Julia Leighton crushed Vicki
Stewart 6-2. 6-1 in the number
two spot. Leighton, a sophomore
from Redondo Beach used a
more aggressive style of play in
her match. "Julia has been play
ing pretty well." said Brennan.
"She's been playing a lot more
aggressively lately and I've been
real happy with that."
In the third singles match,
Gayle Chan, a freshman from
San Anselmo, destroyed Holly
Heath 6-1. 6-0. Brennan has
been very impressed with the

youngster's progress. "Gayle
Chan has been playing just great.
The only set she's dropped this
year was last week and that was
really a fluke," said Brennan.
"She just lost her concentration
and it got away."
After Fresno's Karen Shaw
upset Gordon in the number four
match, Judy Jordan easily hand
led Christina Frazier 6-1, 6-2.
Jordan, also a freshman, usually
plays in the number eight spot on
Stanford's ladder, but was
moved up for the Fresno State
match. Brennan explained,
"Judy Jordan has really been
playing well. She's usually
number eight, but the way she's
been playing she might move up
to a spot in the top six."
In the final singles match,
Andrea Markl dropped the first
set and was struggling in the sec
' ond before she came around to
defeat Bonnie Hippensteil 2-6,
6-3, 6-0. "This was Andrea's
first match," said Brennan, "and
she started out kind of slow, but
she really came around at the
end."
In the doubles, the Cards had
little trouble in racking up all
three wins. Brennan was pleased
with the number one doubles
match, especially, because it was
his first look at another one of his
freshmen, Caryn Copeland.
"Caryn really came on strong so
I was really pleased. She's been
sick all year so I hadn't seen her
play yet." . ,
Copeland teamed with Rubin
to defeat Goedhard and Stewart
6-3, 6-2.
In the number two doubles
match, Leighton and Chan
whipped Heath and Hippensteil
6-2, 6-2 and Corrine Nevinny
and Markl heat Shaw and Bailey
7-5, 6-2 in the number three
match.
