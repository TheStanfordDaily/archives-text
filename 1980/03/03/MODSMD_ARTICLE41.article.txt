### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
Was 1 ong Beach that good or
was Stanford that bad? That was
the question that came to mind
as the 49ers swept three games in
a row from the Cardinals, 15-4.
15-4 and 15-12 in men's vol
leyball action Friday night at
Maples.
Stanford's record drops to 3-4
overall and 1-3 in the OVA.
while l ong Beach State betters
its mark to 7-1 o\ erall and 2-1 in
league play.
Team captain Rod Fletcher
agreed with the analysis. "We
didn't play as a team, we didn't
get in the groove all night." he
said.
Stanford began the match with
a major lineup change at setter,
w here sophomore Bob Dean re
placed injured starter Kip Fn
gen. Unlike their opponents, the
44ers opened the first game with
a quick pace, employing .1 crisp
precision offense and stonewall
defense at the net. This alert
play, combined with Cardinal
miscues. allowed the 4 l 'ers to
huild a sjx-poi nt lead before

Stanford could get on the
scoreboard.
The Cardinals made half of
their first game points in quick
succession as a 49er spike hit
past the endline. following a car
rying call on Long Beach State.
After this, though, the 49erscon
tinued to dominate.
The first game established the
tone for the night. Stanford
failed for the most part to match
the 4 l )ers diving saves and
lightning-quick spikes.
Card middle blocker Jack
Foxworth began the second
game with an inspiring defensive
effort. The native Texan hustled
to make a save with his back to
the net. followed by a pair of div
ing saves. The offense couldn't
get generated, however, and the
struck for eight un
answered points. Playing a big
role in developing the lead was
Willie Wilson, a lanky six-foot
five blocker whose cat-like re
flexes accounted for three of the
points.
Stanford began to rally to
wards the end ol the game, but it
was too late. During one quick

exchange Cardinals John NlcColl
and Tom Grimes prevented
scores with quick saves. Blocking
artist Kim Lum also stopped a
pair of spikes, bouncing the sec
ond one over for the point.
Stanford displayed more
cohesiveness in the second game,
hut they were still out-classed by
the squad.
rhe final game of the night
loomed as the battle of the
benches as both coaches changed
their starting lineups. Grimes,
hitter Cory Brown, and middle
blocker Mark Reagan replaced
Fletcher. Lum and hitter Frank
Anderson for the Cardinals.
Although it wasn't the best
volleyball display of the night,
the third game was the most
evenly matched. Stanford kept
the game tied for the first three
points before mistakes gave
Long Beach State the lead. 6-3.
The Cardinals didn't give up.
however. Scores by Brown,
Foxworth and Reagan brought
them within one. 7-6.
Defensively. Foxworth and
Grimes blocked 44er shots dur
ing an intense exchange that
ended with a Long Beach State
spike over Stanford's front
line. Brown put on an offensive
show with a pair of slams that the
couldn't handle, and one
that threaded their defense to hit
the floor. Nevertheless, Long
Beach State's precision again
prevailed, and they terminated
the match. 15-12.
The spikers have this week to
regroup before traveling to San
Luis Obispo to take on Cal-Poly
Friday. Bekins made it clear that
the team should make a better
showing. "1 expect next time
we'll go out and play the way we
are capable of play ing." he said.
