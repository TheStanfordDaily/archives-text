"It took the team as a whole
doing exceptional!) at each occa
sion to put the wins together, hut
the\ were spread around so. we
couldn't get the individual
scores," said fencing coach Jean
Hetliwell.
TTie results of the Men's West
ern Fencing Competition at San
Jose State this weekend arc re
flected in that comment: Stan
ford finished with an impressive
second place all around, but
qualified only one man — Phil
Gerring — for the individual
NCAA Championships.
Competing in a total of nine
rounds over the course of the
weekend. Stanford men attained
a third place in foil, fourth in
sahre and a first in epec. These
triumphs put Stanford just he
hind first place Air Force
Academy in overall scores.
The epee team's domination
w as particularly notable,
explained Helliwell, as Gerring
was the only experienced player
on this year's team. "The team
was put together just this year.
For epee to have come in and
taken what they did is quite a
feather in their caps."
Card fencers took few feathers
on the individual competitions,
however. They were unable to
qualifv plavcrs for the NCAA

championships in either foil or
sabre.
"Our men would have been
next to go if there had been more
slots for the NCAAs. We were
right at the end of the line. But
the West only has four slots.''
said Helliwell.
"We sagged a little Sunday. A
few victories were a little too
close, then we lost a couple we
shouldn't have." she explained.
But Phil Gerring did qualify,
with 19 wins, four losses and a
second place standing in epee.
This affords him the opportunity
to compete in March 13 to 15 at
the NCAA Championships at
Penn State.
"A couple (of his bouts) were
unusually good. Phil had to meet
some things he hadn't coped with
before. The hardest thing,
though, is to be consistent for
three days. He was steady all the
way through." said Helliwell.
In light of tournament proce
dure. this feat of consistency
gains credence: each team plays
each of the eight other teams and
each team competition demands
three bouts per man within the
three-day period. That's five to
six hours of bouts each day.
The Men's Westerns Competi
tion this weekend ended the sea
son with Stanford Men's Fencing
the number-two team in the
West.
