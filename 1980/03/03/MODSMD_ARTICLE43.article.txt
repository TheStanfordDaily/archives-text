# Women shutout Santa Cruz
## 
### Jennifer Seymour Staff Writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team maintained
its victory stance in Saturday's 6-0 romp over UC"-
Santa Cruz.
The score speaks for the game: Stanford landed
its first goal on a cross-shot by Kim Goumer just
five minutes into the contest. The Cards continued
to control the field throughout the game.
Card domination became most apparent during
the last 20 minutes of the first half. The team
played a loose 4-3-3 line-up. Fullback Maria
C'urgea's powerful clears generated play from
either wing, feeding the ball to the halfbacks who
provided give-and-go passes to shoot off.
I hese manipulations earned Stanford two more
goals, put in by Cathy Carey and Sarah Little. Both
were sailing cross-shots taken from outside the
penalty box.
Before the first half ended. Cindy Shorney's
razzle-dazzle ball control drove two more shots

past Santa Cruz's goalie. The first of these, a pen
alt) shot, was a low ball to the left corner. The
other goal, assisted by halfback Sue Handle, was
the topping of a midfield break from about the 35
yard line into the penalty box.
After this booming start, second-half play was a
little tepid. UCSC tightened up its defense, fre
quently filling its penalty box with five or six defen
ders so that play was held back primarily between
UCSC's 30-50 yard lines.
"They played really slowly. It's hard to play
tough when you're ahead 5-0. We should've used
the time to work on our control and play a'two
touch game. We did to an extent, 1 guess," said
Shorney about Stanford's play.
Cathy Carey booted in Stanford's final goal of
the game â€” a straight-on shot off Shorney's lead
ing cross from the wing.
This victory gives the Cards a 2-0 record, having
already defeated Berkeley. Stanford travels north
to face Humboldt next Saturday.
