# Sleep and Dreams, SLITS on top

### Rick Ostiller Staff Writer 
The IM playoffs opened yes
terday and Sleep and Dreams,
BAD Company, Hockey Red
1, S 1. I I Sand Madera are all
tabbed as slight fa\ orites to come
away with titles in their respec
tive divisions.
No team made it through the
rugged "A" leagues unbeaten,
and only a surprising loss by
Jumpshots for Jesus prevented
all three leagues from ending in
three-way ties for first. One team
that did finish first, Phred's
Phaces. will not be in the
playoffs. The Phaces, fifth in last
week's poll, missed out on their
referee obligation, and have
been dropped from the playoffs.
The nod for the top spot in
the "A" division went to Sleep
and Dreams by virtue of a one
point overtime victory over the
Theta Delts. who dropped from
first to third. FACE lias the sec
ond seeding, while Loss Causa
tion. last year's champs, are
seeded fourth. The "A" leagues
are close enough that no team
should get blown out. Look for
the four seeds to advance, al
though the Bootables-l os Cau
sation game could go either way.
While the "A" leagues are
without an undefeated team, the
"B" leagues had a whopping 21

clubs go 5-0. Overall, 52 "B"
teams made the playoffs, by far
the most of any classification,
and the field will be narrowed to
32 after Sunday's opening
games. B A D Company tops
the seedings as it has all year,
although several teams have
legitimate title aspirations. The
Fellas, seeded sixth, could be the
dark horse. Failures to meet ob
ligations ended the season pre
maturely for four playoff-bound
teams, as the Izods, Trancos,
DSD and Grove all missed their
appointments to officiate.
The women's "A" league has
witnessed the downfall of the
Substituents. Riding high after
an early win over Hockey Red 1,
the Substituents proceeded to
drop their last two games to the
Californians and 558 Mayfield.
Hockey Red I claims the top
seeding because of a victory over
the Californians and the team
should reverse the previous deci
sion against the Substituents in
the semifinals. Look for the
Californians to repeat an earlier
win over 55<S Mayfield in the
other semifinal. Those predic
tions project wins by the Sub
stituents and 55N Mayfield over
The Ladies and Roble respec
tively. but both teams were vic
torious during the regular sea

son.
In women's "B" league play,
the S L I T S came on strong to
earn the top seed. Serra I went
undefeated as well, and Larkin's
Leapers were most impressive in
heating the Seedy Gourmets in
their league championship tus
sle. SMACK and Mirlo have a
chance to avenge earlier losses in
the playoffs, but definitely look
for two of the three unheatens to
battle it out for the title. Unlike
the men's division, no team
bound for the playoffs lost its
eligibility because of a missed re
ffing obligation.
Eligibility wreaked the most
havoc in the "C" leagues as the
first and third ranked teams have
been banished from the playoffs.
Hammer's Jammers and Belin's
Bombers, who along with Mad
era posted the only unbeaten re
cords in the "C' division, will
have to watch the playoffs be
cause of missed obligations.
Ihe two "C" teams' errors
should open the door for Mad
era, ahtough both Faisan Gulch
II and El Tigre cannot be over
looked.
The playoff charts have been
posted outside the IM Office,
and each team is responsible for
finding out its schedule.
