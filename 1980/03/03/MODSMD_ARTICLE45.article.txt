The women's swimming team
swept its own three-day invita
tional over the weekend with a

1425 point tally, almost 600
points more than its nearest
competitor, Cal. More impor
tantly , 10 Cards made qualifying
standards in their last chance to

achieve those marks for the na
tional AIAW championships in
Las Vegas in two weeks.
The meet also featured teams
from University of Nevada-Las
Vegas, University of Hawaii,
University of Pacific, San Jose
State, Fresno State and UC-
Davis.
Three Stanford swimmers who
had not previously attained na
tional times accomplished those
clockings during the weekend to
bring the Cards' AIAW-bound
squad to 16, including diver Lisa
Mariani. Hence, only four
swimmers failed to qualify for
the Las Vegas trip.
Nevertheless, Jeanne Barkey,
Helen Casabona and Nancy
Thompson retained the racing
edge needed to grab a spot for
the first time on the AIAW ros
ter. Barkey churned to 50 and
100 yard butterfly berths,
Casabona clinched a standard in
the 200 tly and Thompson grab
bed a 50 freestyle position.
Kim Carlisle made

the 100 and 200 backstroke
events and the 200 individual
medley; while Libby Beaudet
picked an extra three races in the
100 fly and the 100 and 400 IMs.
Maria Pease cruised to qualifi
cation in the 1650 free in
16:54.54, an effort Thomas
termed great. Pease also qual
ified for 200 free AIAW compet
ition.
Zena Herrmann and Dana
Morton added single events
to their national lists in the 100
backstroke and the 50
breaststroke, respectively. Patty
Spees scored "a little bonus" for
the Cards, according to Thomas,
by qualifying for the AIAW 200
IM.
Linda Jezek, who had previ
ously matched all her national
standards, led the Cards with
four meet wins and two seconds,
all well below the standard cut
offs.
Janet Buchan, although nurs
ing a sore shoulder, managed to
lower her 200 back time to
2:04.23.
