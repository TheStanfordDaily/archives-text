Militants resist commission visit
A U.N. spokesman in Tehran said yesterday that
negotiations being conducted to arrange a meeting
between the U.N. commission and the estimated 50
American hostages at the U.S. Embassy have
reached a sensitive stage, but another day passed and
no date for the meeting was announced.
"1 wouldn't call it trouble really," said U.N.
spokesman Samir Sambar. "The commission is pro
ceeding through very delicate work."
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who last night was
released from the Tehran hospital where he was
treated since late January after a heart attack, gave
what Tehran Radio called a five-minute "farewell
address" to the hospital staff but made no mention of
the hostages or the U.N. commission.
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr told re
porters yesterday: "1 hope the (commission's) visit
(to the embassy) will take place."
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh had
promised Thursday that the meeting between the
commission members and the hostages would be ar
ranged, but government officials made clear yester
day that militants holding the embassy are continuing
to resist the suggestion.
The commission members have made no public
appearance since Thursday, and there were rumors in
Tehran that the panel had presented Iranian au
thorities with a deadline for arranging a meeting with
the hostages.
Ford raps Reagan candidacy
WASHINGTON — Former president Gerald
Ford, who this weekend virtually invited his fellow
Republicans to demand that he enter the presidential
race, would face some formidable obstacles should he
decide to challenge his old adversary, Ronald
Reagan.
Ford issued the invitation in an interview published
yesterday in the New York Times in which he said that
Reagan, as a "very conservative Republican." would
face "an impossible situation" in the November gen
eral election and would be defeated by the Democra
tic nominee.
"If there was an honest-to-goodness, bona fide
urging by a broad-based group in my party. 1 would
respond," Ford was quoted as saying about the
suggestions that he enter the GOP presidential race
as an alternative to the front-running Reagan.
Bob Barrett. Ford's executive assistant, yesterday
portrayed the former president as a man grow n weary
of the increasing number of private urgings that he
enter the race. So he decided to force the issue pub
licly by asserting that Reagan is a sure loser in
November.
The timing of Ford's statement suggests that he
recognizes that he is rapidly approaching a point of no
return in deciding whether to try to head off Reagan,
whose landslide victory in last week's New Hamp
shire primary placed him in a commanding early posi
tion in the Republican presidential field.
Bush attacks Carter Iran policy
CAMBRIDGE. Mass. — Republican presidential
candidate George Bush yesterday accused the Carter
administration of deliberately misleading the Ameri
can public to build "false hopes" about the Iran hos
tages. who Bush called "the flesh and blood victims of
a weak and vascillating foreign policy."
In his sharpest attack yet on President Jimmy Car
ter. Bush said that "we are no closer to solving the
hostage crisis than we were at the moment the em
bassy was seized."
Bush, speaking at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government, said, "The time is long overdue for the
Carter administration to be honest with the Ameri
can people about the reality of this situation. We need
to know the truth behind the facade of diplomatic
activity that the administration claims has been tak
ing place in recent weeks — truth that can only come
from the president himself, not through White House
or State Department leaks calculated to build up a
false sense of optimism."
Saying that the foremost threat to America re

mains "the expansionist policies of the Soviet Un
ion." Bush said that Carter's foreign policy "more
than anything else, triggered the crisis now taking
place in Iran, Afghanistan and other critical areas of
the world."
lowa, Oregon edge toward Bush
DES MOINES. lowa — George Bush expanded
his lead over Ronald Reagan in lowa this weekend as
state Republicans completed the second step in
selecting delegates to the GOP National Convention
in Detroit next July.
An Associated Press survey of the 99 county con
ventions held Saturday showed that with 96 percent
of the balloting tabulated. Bush had gained 1078
delegates to the state convention.
That gives the former Texas congressman and U.N.
ambassador a lead of 37.4 percent to 29.2 percent
over Reagan, the former California governor, who
won 542 delegates.
The figures gathered yesterday show that Reagan
neither gained nor lost ground since the state's widely
watched precinct caucuses Jan. 21, where he lost to
Bush by a margin of 31.6 percent to 29.5 percent.
In Oregon this weekend, George Bush scored an
easy 2-1 victory among almost 600 delegates attend
ing the ISth annual Dorchester Conference, an in
formal gathering of the party's most active members.
The results are not binding on Oregon's delegates
to the national Republican convention this summer in
Detroit. Those delegates will be apportioned on the
basis of the outcome of the state's May 20 primary.
But the size of Bush's margin surprised even his
supporters and demonstrated that Reagan can't take
Oregon for granted despite its proximity to California
where Reagan was governor for two terms.
Registration faces House test
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's
draft registration plan, a loser in its first congressional
test, faces critical votes this week on the program's
future and whether women should be registered
along with men.
The big question is whether the 54-member House
Appropriations Committee will approve the money
the administration needs to begin registration this
summer of young men. aged 19 and 20.
On the other issue — registration of women — the
verdict appears certain. The House Armed Services
personnel subcommittee is expected to fulfill the
prophecy of House leaders and vote overwhelmingly
Thursday against women's registration.
The outcome of the dispute over funds to register
men seems less certain, however.
Last week, a subcommittee of the Appropriations
Committee voted 6-6 against Carter's proposal — a
sharp setback to the administration's plans.
Instead, the subcommittee approved only enough
money to set up a standby system in which registra
tion would not start until the president ordered milit
ary mobilization in an emergency.
Carter budget comes under fire
WASHINGTON — Two key senators yesterday
proposed politically-explosive cuts in the federal
budget that would restrict increases in Social Security
checks and eliminate billions of dollars in federal aid
to state governments.
President Jimmy Carter's "guns and butter
budget" for the next fiscal year should be replaced by
a "guns and margarine budget," said Sen. Lloyd
Bensten ( D-Texas). chairman of the Joint Economic
Committee of Congress. "Everybody must sacrifice
some," he said during an appearance on the NBC
program. Meet the Press.
Sen. Russell Long (D-La.) said. "I don't think
anything should be a sacred cow in the budget."
Democratic and Republican leaders should devise a
tough budget-cutting package and present it to the
Senate on a "take-it-or-leave-it basis." Long, power
ful chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said
on the CBS program. Face the Nation.
Both Long and Bensten proposed changing the
automatic cost-of-living increases granted to people

receiving Social Security checks, a proposal bound to
stir the ire of millions of voters. Under current law.
Social Security payments are raised in direct tandem
with increases in the federal Consumer Price Index,
which measures the cost of living for the typical urban
resident.
Bentsen also called for elimination of federal
revenue-sharing payments to the states, which
amount to $3 billion-a-year.
U.N. resolution angers Israel
JERUSALEM — The Israeli government reacted
angrily yesterday to the United Nations Security
Council resolution condemning Jewish civilian set
tlement on the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,
calling the U.N. action "unjustified and one-sided,"
and saying that U.S. support of the measure was a
"deep disappointment."
The Foreign Ministry, in a statement by spokesman
Michael Shiloh, responded to the unanimous Security
Council vote by declaring that "settlement in the
West Bank is not only a right, but an integral part of
our security system."
Since the 1967 Six-Day War Israel has built about
100 settlements in the occupied territories, with an
estimated population of about 9000 persons.
"Such a one-sided resolution cannot serve the
peace process going on between Israel and Egypt,"
Shiloh said, adding that the government "deeply"
regrets the U.S. vote on the issue.
"We've known the position of the United States
against settlements for a long time, but for the past
two years the United States was abstained on much
milder (U.N.) resolution," he said. The United States
has long charged that Israel's settlement policy viol
ates international law and is an obstacle to Middle
East peace.
March storm blankets nation
A record-breaking March snowstorm chilled much
of the nation yesterday, spreading a deadly mantle on
roads and sending temperatures plummeting. At
least 22 deaths were blamed on the storm and snow
covered bodies were found in Missouri and Virginia.
The storm moved over the mid-Atlantic Coast
after dumping a foot of snow in parts of Indiana and
Ohio and extending its grasp as far south as
Louisiana. In heading out to sea before reaching New
England, the storm continued the pattern of the
1978-80 winter season — virtually no snow for the
Northeast.
Snowfall ranged from 18 inches in Greene County
in central Virginia to a dusting at New Orleans.
Temperature records for the date included readings
of 7 below zero in Kansas City and St. Joseph, Mo.,
15 below in Syracuse, N.Y. and 29 degrees in New
Orleans. The record low in Louisiana's largest city
broke the mark set in 1890.
Grocery clerks ratify contract
OAKLAND — Union grocery clerks voted over
whelmingly yesterday to accept a new contract and
end a six-week strike against major supermarkets in
the eight-county San Francisco Bay area.
More than 13.000 workers had been idled by the
selective strike which began Jan. 21 and included a
lockout by members of Food Employers Council who
were not struck.
The members of the United Food and Commercial
Workers union voted 6655 to 651 to approve the pact
and return to work almost as soon as possible, accord
ing to union spokesman Frank Dininger.
Details and the length of the contract were not
immediately announced, but Dininger said the union
had won its fight over seniority and job protection.
" Money was never the main issue," Dininger said.
The union had been picketing all Safeway and
some Raley's stores and had been locked out of other
chains such as Alpha Beta. Lucky's. Ralph's and Al
bertson's.
Agreement on a new contract was reached Friday
in Washington D.C. after two days of bargaining
under the supervision of the Federal Mediation and
Conciliation Service.
