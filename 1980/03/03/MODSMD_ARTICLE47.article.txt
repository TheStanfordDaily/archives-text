# Bush, Kennedy losing early leads in Mass.
## 
### Bill Staff The Los Angeles Times 
BOSTON — Less than a month ago,
native sons George Bush and Edward
Kennedy were overwhelming favorites
to win the Republican and Democratic
presidential primary elections in Mas
sachusetts tomorow.
But the shifting political winds of this
volatile election season seem to be
blowing through Massachusetts, too.
The early odds have changed and to
day, the Bush and the Kennedy cam
paigns are battling to survive Mas
sachusetts with respectable showings
against Ronald Reagan and President
Jimmy Carter.
About half of the state's three mill
ion registered voters are expected to go
to the polls tomorrow if the weather is
fair. The turnout was 29 percent four
years ago when then President Gerald
Ford defeated Reagan 2-1 in the GOP
primary and Sen. Henry Jackson of
Washington State won the Democrtic
primary.
There are some major unknown fac
tors at work that make predictions of
tomorrow's outcome extremely
hazardous. One out of every third voter
in Massachusetts is registered as an in
dependent. Both primaries could be
significantly affected by how the inde
penents turn out and for whom they
vote.
Rep. John Anderson of Illinois has
campaigned vigorously for indepen
dent votes and is counting on a solid
third-place GOP finish, somewhere
back of Reagan and Bush and well
ahead of Sen. Howard Baker of Ten
nessee. Some political insiders say pri
vately that a second-place finish for
Anderson is not impossible.
The Vermont primary is also tomor
row, and Baker, with the support of
Gov. Richard Snelling, is concentrating
on that state.
Ford
Another uncertainty was the possi
ble effect of Ford's announcement in a
newspaper interview yesterday. In it
Ford said that Reagan could not win in
the general election and that he might
enter the Republican race if there was a
demand from "a broad-based group in
my party."
So far, here has been no such de
mand, Ford said. But any talk of a Ford
candidacy would not help Bush, who
has relied heavily on the support of
Republicans who backed Ford against
Reagan in 1976.
On the Democratic side, Kennedy
has been the dominant political force in
Massachusetts for more than 15 years,
rolling up landslide victories in each of
his Senate campaigns.
In spite of Kennedy presidential
campagn troubles through the fall and
winter, the idea of him losing his home
state to Carter or anyone else would
have been unthinkable as recently as a
few weeks ago. No one is openly pre
dicting a Carter victory, but some in
siders at least acknowledge now that it
could happen.
Poll
A Boston Globe opinion poll pub
lished yesterday showed Kennedy lead
ing Carter 52 percent to 37 percent
based on interviews conducted last
Tuesday — the day of Carter's victory
over Kennedy in the New Hampshire
primary — by 49 percent to 38 percent

— through Thursday.
What must be disturbing to Ken
nedy's supporters is the fact that Ken
nedy's margin eroded significantly as
news of Carter's victory circulated.
Those prospective Massachusetts vot
ers who were contacted on Thursday
backed Kennedy by only 47 percent to
42 percent.
The same poll showed Bush favored
over Reagan by 36 percent to 33 per
cent; but like Kennedy; Bush's
strength ebbed as time went on.
Reagan led Bush among voters inter
viewed on Wednesday and Thursday.
Andeson third
Anderson ran third with 17 percent
and Baker was fourth with 6 percent.
Just a month ago, Bush, riding the crest
of his upset victory over Reagan in
lowa, was favored three-to-one by Mas
sachusetts Republicans and indepen
dents who said they likely would vote in
the GOP primary.
In terms of the magnitude of poten
tial votes and the delegates at stake,
111 for Democrats and 42 for Republi
cans, Massachusetts provides the most
significant event of the young political
season. But until the past week, par
ticularly since New Hampshire, the im
pact of Massachusetts on the overall
nominating process was not expected
to be great.
The conventional wisdom, among
the candidates as well as observers, was
that Kennedy would sweep the Demo
cratic primary and Bush the Republi
can balloting. Until recent days, the
Carter and Reagan campaigns made
little more than token efforts to win
voters.
Reagan publicly called Mas
sachusetts "my worst state." But the
New Hampshire victory over Bush. 50
percent to 23 percent, injected fresh
interest in Reagan'scampaign here. A
corps of Reagan workers from New
Hampshire, including Jerry Carmen,
his state campaign manager there, was
imported to Boston for an invigorated
effort to get out Republican and inde
pendent voters for the former Califor
nia governor.
Bush, the former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations and onetime CIA
director, was born in Milton, Mass. and
attended Phillips Academy in An
dover. He has drawn heavily on his
family, school and political ties to Mas
sachusetts and the rest of New England
during his months of campaigning in
the Northeast.
After upsetting Reagan in lowa, the
55-year-old Bush hoped to build on
that momentum in his home ground of
New England and then provide a
strong challenge to Reagan in the
South.
California Gov. Jerry Brown gave up
active campaigning in Massachusetts to
concentrate on the Wisconsin primary
April 1, but his name remains on the
Democratic ballot along with Ken
nedy's and Carter's.

interest in Reagan'scampaign here. A
corps of Reagan workers from New
Hampshire, including Jerry Carmen,
his state campaign manager there, was
imported to Boston for an invigorated
effort to get out Republican and inde
pendent voters for the former Califor
nia governor.
Bush, the former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations and onetime CIA
director, was born in Milton, Mass. and
attended Phillips Academy in An
dover. He has drawn heavily on his
family, school and political ties to Mas
sachusetts and the rest of New England
during his months of campaigning in
the Northeast.
After upsetting Reagan in lowa, the
55-year-old Bush hoped to build on
that momentum in his home ground of
New England and then provide a
strong challenge to Reagan in the
South.
California Gov. Jerry Brown gave up
active campaigning in Massachusetts to
concentrate on the Wisconsin primary
April 1, but his name remains on the
Democratic ballot along with Ken
nedy's and Carter's.
BOSTON — Less than a month ago,
native sons George Bush and Edward
Kennedy were overwhelming favorites
to win the Republican and Democratic
presidential primary elections in Mas
sachusetts tomorow.
But the shifting political winds of this
volatile election season seem to be
blowing through Massachusetts, too.
The early odds have changed and to
day, the Bush and the Kennedy cam
paigns are battling to survive Mas
sachusetts with respectable showings
against Ronald Reagan and President
Jimmy Carter.
About half of the state's three mill
ion registered voters are expected to go
to the polls tomorrow if the weather is
fair. The turnout was 29 percent four
years ago when then President Gerald
Ford defeated Reagan 2-1 in the GOP
primary and Sen. Henry Jackson of
Washington State won the Democrtic
primary.
There are some major unknown fac
tors at work that make predictions of
tomorrow's outcome extremely
hazardous. One out of every third voter
in Massachusetts is registered as an in
dependent. Both primaries could be
significantly affected by how the inde
penents turn out and for whom they
vote.
Rep. John Anderson of Illinois has
campaigned vigorously for indepen
dent votes and is counting on a solid
third-place GOP finish, somewhere
back of Reagan and Bush and well
ahead of Sen. Howard Baker of Ten
nessee. Some political insiders say pri
vately that a second-place finish for
Anderson is not impossible.
The Vermont primary is also tomor
row, and Baker, with the support of
Gov. Richard Snelling, is concentrating
on that state.
Ford
Another uncertainty was the possi
ble effect of Ford's announcement in a
newspaper interview yesterday. In it
Ford said that Reagan could not win in
the general election and that he might
enter the Republican race if there was a
demand from "a broad-based group in
my party."
So far, here has been no such de
mand, Ford said. But any talk of a Ford
candidacy would not help Bush, who
has relied heavily on the support of
Republicans who backed Ford against
Reagan in 1976.
On the Democratic side, Kennedy
has been the dominant political force in
Massachusetts for more than 15 years,
rolling up landslide victories in each of
his Senate campaigns.
In spite of Kennedy presidential
campagn troubles through the fall and
winter, the idea of him losing his home
state to Carter or anyone else would
have been unthinkable as recently as a
few weeks ago. No one is openly pre
dicting a Carter victory, but some in
siders at least acknowledge now that it
could happen.
Poll
A Boston Globe opinion poll pub
lished yesterday showed Kennedy lead
ing Carter 52 percent to 37 percent
based on interviews conducted last
Tuesday — the day of Carter's victory
over Kennedy in the New Hampshire
primary — by 49 percent to 38 percent

— through Thursday.
What must be disturbing to Ken
nedy's supporters is the fact that Ken
nedy's margin eroded significantly as
news of Carter's victory circulated.
Those prospective Massachusetts vot
ers who were contacted on Thursday
backed Kennedy by only 47 percent to
42 percent.
The same poll showed Bush favored
over Reagan by 36 percent to 33 per
cent; but like Kennedy; Bush's
strength ebbed as time went on.
Reagan led Bush among voters inter
viewed on Wednesday and Thursday.
Andeson third
Anderson ran third with 17 percent
and Baker was fourth with 6 percent.
Just a month ago, Bush, riding the crest
of his upset victory over Reagan in
lowa, was favored three-to-one by Mas
sachusetts Republicans and indepen
dents who said they likely would vote in
the GOP primary.
In terms of the magnitude of poten
tial votes and the delegates at stake,
111 for Democrats and 42 for Republi
cans, Massachusetts provides the most
significant event of the young political
season. But until the past week, par
ticularly since New Hampshire, the im
pact of Massachusetts on the overall
nominating process was not expected
to be great.
The conventional wisdom, among
the candidates as well as observers, was
that Kennedy would sweep the Demo
cratic primary and Bush the Republi
can balloting. Until recent days, the
Carter and Reagan campaigns made
little more than token efforts to win
voters.
Reagan publicly called Mas
sachusetts "my worst state." But the
