# Bush, Carter take Branner
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
After a three-day mock political convention, Branner
selected George Bush and Jimmy Carter as presidential
candidates for 1980. Unfortunately tor the two. they will
face real-life challengesin November.
Bush won on a second round of the Republican con
vention from the support of the Ronald Reagan-Howard
Baker-Bush coalition. Carter won the Democratic con
vention on the fourth round.
Branner held its preliminary caucus last Wednesday
night, its primaries on Thursday and the two conventions
on Friday.
In the Democratic caucus Carter won nine delegates,
Kennedy took five and Lyndon Larouche garnered one.
On the Republican side. Baker won four delegates. John
Anderson captured three. Bush and Reagan won two
apiece.
According to Branner staff member Bill Offutt, voter
turnout was low because of heavy rain. Branner resi
dents (who could cast two votes) and other students cast
a total of 150 votes.
Republian glut
"Many more people turned out to vote Republican,"
said Offutt. because of the four major Republican cam
paigns in contrast to the two major Democratic cam
paigns.
According to Offutt, 250 to 300 people voted in
Thursday's primaries, and 560 voted during all three
days.
Four state-styled primaries were held Thursday: New
Hampshire, New York, Michigan/Illinois and Califor
nia.
Fifty Democratic and 40 Republican delegates went
into the conventions Friday. Each party randomly drew
10 uncommitted delegates.
Carter edge
Entering the convention, the committed Democratic
votes included 22 for Carter, 15 for Kennedy and 3 for
Larouche. The Republican delegates consisted of 13Va
for Anderson, 4 for Baker, 8 for Reagan and 4Vi for
Bush.
Offutt modelled the convention after the 1972 presi
dential election in which Humphrey and McGovern
challenged the right of certain delegates to sit on the
floor.
Grounds for challenge arc an improper delegate selec
tion process or a lack of women or minority representa

tion;" he said.
"It happened on the Democratic side perfectly," said
Offutt. The Kennedy people challenged the Carter win
in California, as Humphrey had challenged McGovern
in 1972.
Carter lost two delegates to that challenge, but Ken
nedy lost another two when Carter challenged the New
York results.
A Democratic candidate needed 26 delegates to win.
"On the first ballot, the delegates were pledged to
vote as they were originally assigned," said Offutt.
Because one Carter delegate was absent. Carter re
ceived only 25 delegates rather than the 26 needed to
win.
On the second ballot Kennedy offered Larouche the
vice-presidency in return for Larouche delegate support.
The Carter people offered the same before the third
ballot.
A Kennedy delegate switched on the fourth ballot,
and Carter won. "She didn't want it (the convention) to
go on all night," said Offutt.
Sell out
On the Republican side, the Anderson people went
into the convention with a lead. The Bush-Reagan-
Baker coalition, however, "ganged up against Ander
son," said Offutt. "On the second ballot they went be
hind Bush."
Offutt said that "the Anderson people felt they'd been
sold out." They received over 40 percent of all votes cast.
According to Tom Garrett, campaign manager for
Bush, Ambassador Bush owed his victory to the
Reagan-Bush-Baker coalition. Reagan and Baker felt
Anderson didn't represent the views of the Republican
party. We felt Bush had the best chance of beating
Carter."
Jim Gable, president of Stanford Students for Baker,
said, "We decided to merge with Bush because he was the
candidate ideologically closest to us."
He added, "There is no way Baker would go for
Anderson over Bush."
Ron Johnson, a Branner housing assistant (RA) said,
"Because they (the Bush people) knew they were going
to merge, that influenced the whole convention. Every
challenge was leaning toward that eventual coalition."
Each winning party will receive a minimum of $50.
According to Offutt, the Carter people will probably
have a bowling party and the Bush campaign will throw a
dorm party.

On the second ballot Kennedy offered Larouche the
vice-presidency in return for Larouche delegate support.
The Carter people offered the same before the third
ballot.
A Kennedy delegate switched on the fourth ballot,
and Carter won. "She didn't want it (the convention) to
go on all night," said Offutt.
Sell out
On the Republican side, the Anderson people went
into the convention with a lead. The Bush-Reagan-
Baker coalition, however, "ganged up against Ander
son," said Offutt. "On the second ballot they went be
hind Bush."
Offutt said that "the Anderson people felt they'd been
sold out." They received over 40 percent of all votes cast.
According to Tom Garrett, campaign manager for
Bush, Ambassador Bush owed his victory to the
Reagan-Bush-Baker coalition. Reagan and Baker felt
Anderson didn't represent the views of the Republican
party. We felt Bush had the best chance of beating
Carter."
Jim Gable, president of Stanford Students for Baker,
said, "We decided to merge with Bush because he was the
candidate ideologically closest to us."
He added, "There is no way Baker would go for
Anderson over Bush."
Ron Johnson, a Branner housing assistant (RA) said,
"Because they (the Bush people) knew they were going
to merge, that influenced the whole convention. Every
challenge was leaning toward that eventual coalition."
Each winning party will receive a minimum of $50.
According to Offutt, the Carter people will probably
have a bowling party and the Bush campaign will throw a
dorm party.

Delegates listen to debate on the floor of Branner's mock convention Friday.
After a three-day mock political convention, Branner
selected George Bush and Jimmy Carter as presidential
candidates for 1980. Unfortunately tor the two. they will
face real-life challengesin November.
Bush won on a second round of the Republican con
vention from the support of the Ronald Reagan-Howard
Baker-Bush coalition. Carter won the Democratic con
vention on the fourth round.
Branner held its preliminary caucus last Wednesday
night, its primaries on Thursday and the two conventions
on Friday.
In the Democratic caucus Carter won nine delegates,
Kennedy took five and Lyndon Larouche garnered one.
On the Republican side. Baker won four delegates. John
Anderson captured three. Bush and Reagan won two
apiece.
According to Branner staff member Bill Offutt, voter
turnout was low because of heavy rain. Branner resi
dents (who could cast two votes) and other students cast
a total of 150 votes.
Republian glut
"Many more people turned out to vote Republican,"
said Offutt. because of the four major Republican cam
paigns in contrast to the two major Democratic cam
paigns.
According to Offutt, 250 to 300 people voted in
Thursday's primaries, and 560 voted during all three
days.
Four state-styled primaries were held Thursday: New
Hampshire, New York, Michigan/Illinois and Califor
nia.
Fifty Democratic and 40 Republican delegates went
into the conventions Friday. Each party randomly drew
10 uncommitted delegates.
Carter edge
Entering the convention, the committed Democratic
votes included 22 for Carter, 15 for Kennedy and 3 for
Larouche. The Republican delegates consisted of 13Va
for Anderson, 4 for Baker, 8 for Reagan and 4Vi for
Bush.
Offutt modelled the convention after the 1972 presi
dential election in which Humphrey and McGovern
challenged the right of certain delegates to sit on the
floor.
Grounds for challenge arc an improper delegate selec
tion process or a lack of women or minority representa

tion;" he said.
"It happened on the Democratic side perfectly," said
Offutt. The Kennedy people challenged the Carter win
in California, as Humphrey had challenged McGovern
in 1972.
Carter lost two delegates to that challenge, but Ken
nedy lost another two when Carter challenged the New
York results.
A Democratic candidate needed 26 delegates to win.
"On the first ballot, the delegates were pledged to
vote as they were originally assigned," said Offutt.
Because one Carter delegate was absent. Carter re
ceived only 25 delegates rather than the 26 needed to
win.
On the second ballot Kennedy offered Larouche the
vice-presidency in return for Larouche delegate support.
The Carter people offered the same before the third
ballot.
A Kennedy delegate switched on the fourth ballot,
and Carter won. "She didn't want it (the convention) to
go on all night," said Offutt.
