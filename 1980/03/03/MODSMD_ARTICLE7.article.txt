## Castes battle in India 
### Dilip Ganguly Agence France-Presse 
NEW DELHI — Last Thurs
day , when Indians here looked at
the morning newspapers, they
were faced with a front-page pic
ture of the charred remains of a
group of harijans. the Hindu un
touchables, who were killed by
upper-caste Hindus last Monday
in a Bihar village about 600 miles
east of New Delhi.
Every year at least 300 hari
jans are killed in caste riots in
India, according to government
statistics. In the first two months
of this year 36 such deaths have
been reported. The harijans, a
name given them by Mahatma
Ghandi that means children of
God, live in fear and eternal
poverty.
From generation to genera
tion they suffer at the hands of
their caste superiors. In rural In
dia, for example, if a harijan
draws water from the well of an
upper-caste brahmin, he is
beaten, and in most cases it leads
to death.
Last summer in a village in the
state of Bihar a harijan girl who
had failed in love with an upper
caste Hindu hoy, was stripped
naked and tied to a tree trunk
and left unattended. On the third
day she died of dehydration.
Sprinking water
The orthodix brahmins still be
lieve that if the shadow of a hari
jan falls on them, they are pol
luted and must purify themselves
by sprinkling water from the holy
Ganges River over themselves.
In an incident last Monday 14
harijans, including seven women
and four children, were killed by
a mob of 500 upper-caste Hin
dus at Pirpa village.
The mob raided the village at

10 p.m., dragged the harijansout
from their mud houses, shot
them and later set the dead and
dying bodies on lire.
Kupe
On Jan. 14, in Narianpur, in
Uttar Pradesh, about 250 miles
east of New Delhi, a group of
policemen beat up harijan men,
women and children, raped the
women and robbed several hari
jan families of their meager be
longings.
Three weeks later upper-caste
Hindus killed 12 harijans, in
cluding seven women and two
children, in Parasbigha village in
Bihar state. A 150-strong mob of
hired hoodlums surrounded the
village around midnight, fired
indiscriminately at the harijans
and set fire to their houses.
The main reason behind the
incidents is the ancient belief
that the harijans, the lowest
ranking group in the Hindu caste
structure, are born to serve Hin
dus of the other castes.
'Serious note'
Prime Minister Indira Gan
dhi's Congress government has
taken serious note of the inci
dents, and vulnerable harijan vil
lages are being protected by
armed police guards.
Killing of harijans is nothing
new to India, but what has as
sumed importance is the slow but
steady infiltration by the Naxa
lites. the pro-Peking political ex
tremists, among the harijans.
Interior Ministry reports
speak of the partial success ol
political indoctrination of hari
jans by the volatile extremists
from neighboring West Bengal
state.
The extremists found a ready
base — the outcome of age-old
exploitation — to propogate

their political ideology, and dur
ing the 1970s they enlisted at
least 8000 harijans as members,
the reports said. At the peak of
the Naxalite movement the hari
jans "annihilated" at least 40
"class enemies" in the Arrah and
Bhojpur districts of Bihar, and in
police retaliations 50 Naxalite
harijans lost their lives, the In
terior Ministry reports said.
Power
A harijan man, Hari Dushad,
who now believes that "power
comes from the barrel of a gun"
said that he had no better option
than to join with the Naxalites.
He said his father was killed by a
raj put (upper-caste Hindu), and
"I could do nothing, but now —
let them come now."
Dushad was kept in prison for
three years and was released
onlv recently when police failed
to prove charges against him. He
was accused of killing five land
lords.
Dushad, 27, said, "We would
have reacted long back, but the
problem is that if we fight with
the landlords, our folk lose their
jobs." Most harijans work as
laborers on the farms of the land
lords.
"Time has come"
"But now we feel we have had
enough and time has come for us
to retaliate," Dushad said. He is
one of the few harijans to have
completed a college education.
Government statistics speak
volumes of the caste hatred that
plagues Indian society. A
government-appointed commis
sion's report says that as many as
10,879 cases of atrocities against
harijans were registered during
1977, an increase of more than
75 percent over those reported
during 1976.

and four children, were killed by
a mob of 500 upper-caste Hin
dus at Pirpa village.
The mob raided the village at

10 p.m., dragged the harijansout
from their mud houses, shot
them and later set the dead and
dying bodies on lire.
Kupe
On Jan. 14, in Narianpur, in
Uttar Pradesh, about 250 miles
east of New Delhi, a group of
policemen beat up harijan men,
women and children, raped the
women and robbed several hari
jan families of their meager be
longings.
Three weeks later upper-caste
Hindus killed 12 harijans, in
cluding seven women and two
children, in Parasbigha village in
Bihar state. A 150-strong mob of
hired hoodlums surrounded the
village around midnight, fired
indiscriminately at the harijans
and set fire to their houses.
The main reason behind the
incidents is the ancient belief
that the harijans, the lowest
ranking group in the Hindu caste
structure, are born to serve Hin
dus of the other castes.
'Serious note'
Prime Minister Indira Gan
dhi's Congress government has
taken serious note of the inci
dents, and vulnerable harijan vil
lages are being protected by
armed police guards.
Killing of harijans is nothing
new to India, but what has as
sumed importance is the slow but
steady infiltration by the Naxa
lites. the pro-Peking political ex
tremists, among the harijans.
Interior Ministry reports
speak of the partial success ol
political indoctrination of hari
jans by the volatile extremists
from neighboring West Bengal
state.
The extremists found a ready
base — the outcome of age-old
exploitation — to propogate

their political ideology, and dur
ing the 1970s they enlisted at
least 8000 harijans as members,
the reports said. At the peak of
the Naxalite movement the hari
jans "annihilated" at least 40
"class enemies" in the Arrah and
Bhojpur districts of Bihar, and in
police retaliations 50 Naxalite
harijans lost their lives, the In
terior Ministry reports said.
Power
A harijan man, Hari Dushad,
who now believes that "power
comes from the barrel of a gun"
said that he had no better option
than to join with the Naxalites.
He said his father was killed by a
raj put (upper-caste Hindu), and
"I could do nothing, but now —
let them come now."
Dushad was kept in prison for
three years and was released
onlv recently when police failed
to prove charges against him. He
was accused of killing five land
lords.
Dushad, 27, said, "We would
have reacted long back, but the
problem is that if we fight with
the landlords, our folk lose their
jobs." Most harijans work as
laborers on the farms of the land
lords.
"Time has come"
"But now we feel we have had
enough and time has come for us
to retaliate," Dushad said. He is
one of the few harijans to have
completed a college education.
Government statistics speak
volumes of the caste hatred that
plagues Indian society. A
government-appointed commis
sion's report says that as many as
10,879 cases of atrocities against
harijans were registered during
1977, an increase of more than
75 percent over those reported
during 1976.
NEW DELHI — Last Thurs
day , when Indians here looked at
the morning newspapers, they
were faced with a front-page pic
ture of the charred remains of a
group of harijans. the Hindu un
touchables, who were killed by
upper-caste Hindus last Monday
in a Bihar village about 600 miles
east of New Delhi.
Every year at least 300 hari
jans are killed in caste riots in
India, according to government
statistics. In the first two months
of this year 36 such deaths have
been reported. The harijans, a
name given them by Mahatma
Ghandi that means children of
God, live in fear and eternal
poverty.
From generation to genera
tion they suffer at the hands of
their caste superiors. In rural In
dia, for example, if a harijan
draws water from the well of an
upper-caste brahmin, he is
beaten, and in most cases it leads
to death.
Last summer in a village in the
state of Bihar a harijan girl who
had failed in love with an upper
caste Hindu hoy, was stripped
naked and tied to a tree trunk
and left unattended. On the third
day she died of dehydration.
Sprinking water
The orthodix brahmins still be
lieve that if the shadow of a hari
jan falls on them, they are pol
luted and must purify themselves
by sprinkling water from the holy
Ganges River over themselves.

harijans, including seven women
