# Yugoslavs prepare for invasion
## 
### Michael Dobbs The Washington Post 
BELGRADE — In recent
months sirens have wailed in (his
Yugoslav capital as •"enemy"
planes swooped in on vital
targets. Near the Bulgarian bor
der "agents provocatuers" infil
trate factories, urging workers to
protest against food shortages or
low pay.
These war games, often
code-named "Nothing Will Sur
prise Us," are routine here —
illustrating how highly organized
are Yugoslavia's defenses.
That defense system presents
massive risks for any
Afghanistan-style in\ asion
should the Soviet Union be
tempted to intervene after the
death ot President Josip Bro/
Tito.
Like Afghanistan. Yugoslavia
is a strategically placed
nonaligned nation bordering on
the Soviet bloc. Both countries
are covered by high mountain
ranges well suited to guerrilla
warfare — and both boast deep
rooted warrior traditions of re
sisting enemy occupation.
The essential military differ
ence is that the Yugoslavs have
been preparing in earnest for a
Soviet invasion ever since iy4N.
when they became the first
communist country to break
away from Moscow. It is the
thoroughness of these prepara
tions. they believe, that now
forms the ultimate guarantee of

Yugoslavia's future indepen
dence.
Yugoslav defense strategy had
drawn its inspiration from the
partisan uprising led by Tito
against German and Italian oc
cupation in World War 11. But it
had been refined and updated to
meet modern conditions.
In the event of another inva
sion. it would he the task of
Yugoslav ia's 2b0.000-man army
to withstand the frontal attack
for as long as possible. Much ot
the remaining 22 million popula
tion would retreat to the moun
tains for a partisan-type defense.
Capitulation to the enemy has
heen declared unconstitutional.
The regulai army is
supplemented by half a million
reservist and by territorial de
fense units numbering several
million. Nearly all Yugoslav
adult males have had some milit
ary training. Compulsory milit
ary service lasts about 15
months. Stores of weapons, am
munition. and food are hidden in
■%ie mountains, ready for a prot
racted struggle.
In addition to the reservists,
who must be prepared to answer
a call-up in three hours, regular
exercises are held for territorial
defense units without prior
notice. In the Croatian capital of
Zagreb, for instance, a news
paper office was hurriedly
evacuated to the countryside fol
lowing a mock poison-gas attack.
The philosophy of territorial

defense was stated clearly by
Tito in a speech last year: "We
are trying to ensure the kind of
defense which will make anyone
wanting to attack us give up his
plans in advance. (During the
war) we had no arms of our own
and instead had to arm ourselves
with the weapons of the oc
cupiers. Dealing with a possible
new aggressor now will be much
easier."
The strategy sounds simple,
but there are several possible
snags. Despite the Afghan and
Czechoslovak precedents, the
Soviets would be unlikely to pur
sue its objectives here through
open invasion.
Furthermore. Yugoslavia it
self has undergone a massive
sociological transformation since
the 19405, when peasants liv ing
in the mountains formed the
backbone of Tito's partisans.
In 1941. when I litler attacked
Yugoslav ia, nearly 70 percent of
the population lived in rural aras.
Like generations of South Slav
peasants before them, their first
instinct was to defend their
families and homes, to fight for
their own survival. Tito's genius
lay in transforming them into a
disciplined army led by com
munists.
Today Yugoslav ia has become
a predominantly urban-based
consumer society. Personal ad
vancement rather than personal
survival is a basic tenant. The
rural population has dwindled to
around 30 percent.

While eight out of 10 young
Yugoslavs declared in a recent
opinion poll that they would he
prepared to die for their country
in the event of an invasion, the
shift in population and values
poses questions about the effec
tiveness of partisan-type de
fense.
