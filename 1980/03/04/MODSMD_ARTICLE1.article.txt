# FIRE GUTS STOREY HOUSE
## Damage estimates exceed $300,000 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
A three-alarm electrical fire gutted
much of the upper floors of Store)
House yesterday afternoon, lea\ ing the
building almost a total loss.
None of the 39 female residents was
injured in the blaze, which caused an
estimated $300.000 to $400.000 dam
age to the KO-year-old structure.
Two firefighters were slightly in
jured while containing the fire. They
were hospitalized and released shortly
thereafter.
A smoke detector relayed the initial
alarm to the Palo Alto l ire Depart
ment at 2:15 p.m. The first truck ar
med at the scene six minutes later, ac
cording to Battalion Chief Charles
Challenger.
The fire started in the second story
corner room of Suzie I'az and Jennie
Thompson when electrical wiring from
a refrigerator to a wall outlet over
heated. said Santa Clara County Fire
Marshal Cliff Johnson.
The room was just smoking when
resident Tina Rising pulled Paz out of
the room. Paz had been sleeping in the
room just before the fire broke out.
Rising said.
Another Storey resident, Pam
Hutchcraft. said she tried to find a fire
extinguisher on the floor to battle the
blaze with. She said she couldn't find
one on that floor, and had to go
downstairs to get one.
By the time she arri\ed back at the
room, the fire was too large for
her to control, she said.
The 15 women in the house were
then alerted and left the house. Hutch
craft said.
Evacuated
A lire extinguisher was found on the
second tloor after the blaze was extin
guished. according to Santa Clara
County l ire Marshal Cliff Johnson.
I he tire probably could not have been
put out with just an extinguisher, he
added.
Rumors that the lire extinguishers

on the tloor had been stolen or tam
pered with before the fire remain un
substantiated.
A total of 13 \ehicles including six
fire engines and three fire trucks were
called to combat the blaze, which was
not contained until 4:5 1 p.m., said Fire
Captain J.D. Timko.
Delayed arrival
The arri\ al time of the first truck was
delayed by the bollards which border
the inner campus, according to firefigh
ter Lee Caudill.
"We were at most two minutes
slower in responding." because of the
need to go "the long way around" to
get to the fire, he said.
The first truck did not knock down
the wood posts to enter the campus (as
they are supposed to do in an
emergency situation) because "we
didn't want to stop to see if they could
be knocked o\er." he said.
A crowd of more than 1000 spec
tators ringed the structure while the
fire was fought.
Firefighters enter
Firefighters first entered the house in
an attempt to combat the fire from the
inside, said Timko.
1 hey were forced to leave the house
when they found the hall filled with
noxious smoke and gasses, he said.
A second crew arriving at the scene
then began the attack from the outside.
The fire quickly spread to the third
tloor and then to the attic, a develop
ment that further complicated the
firefighters' task, said Timko.
'Concede roof
I he firefighters "conceded the roof'
when efforts to control the flames in
the attic by cutting holes in the roof
failed. Timko said.
"We couldn't get ahead of the fire,"
and had to let the roof burn so that we
could protect the rest of the house." he
said.
I he methods used were the "classic
ways to fight a fire of this type," he said.
