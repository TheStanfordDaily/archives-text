### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
A three-alarm electrical fire gutted
much of the upper floors of Store)
House yesterday afternoon, lea\ ing the
building almost a total loss.
None of the 39 female residents was
injured in the blaze, which caused an
estimated $300.000 to $400.000 dam
age to the KO-year-old structure.
Two firefighters were slightly in
jured while containing the fire. They
were hospitalized and released shortly
thereafter.
A smoke detector relayed the initial
alarm to the Palo Alto l ire Depart
ment at 2:15 p.m. The first truck ar
med at the scene six minutes later, ac
cording to Battalion Chief Charles
Challenger.
The fire started in the second story
corner room of Suzie I'az and Jennie
Thompson when electrical wiring from
a refrigerator to a wall outlet over
heated. said Santa Clara County Fire
Marshal Cliff Johnson.
The room was just smoking when
resident Tina Rising pulled Paz out of
the room. Paz had been sleeping in the
room just before the fire broke out.
Rising said.
Another Storey resident, Pam
Hutchcraft. said she tried to find a fire
extinguisher on the floor to battle the
blaze with. She said she couldn't find
one on that floor, and had to go
downstairs to get one.
By the time she arri\ed back at the
room, the fire was too large for
her to control, she said.
The 15 women in the house were
then alerted and left the house. Hutch
craft said.
Evacuated
A lire extinguisher was found on the
second tloor after the blaze was extin
guished. according to Santa Clara
County l ire Marshal Cliff Johnson.
I he tire probably could not have been
put out with just an extinguisher, he
added.
Rumors that the lire extinguishers

on the tloor had been stolen or tam
pered with before the fire remain un
substantiated.
A total of 13 \ehicles including six
fire engines and three fire trucks were
called to combat the blaze, which was
not contained until 4:5 1 p.m., said Fire
Captain J.D. Timko.
Delayed arrival
The arri\ al time of the first truck was
delayed by the bollards which border
the inner campus, according to firefigh
ter Lee Caudill.
"We were at most two minutes
slower in responding." because of the
need to go "the long way around" to
get to the fire, he said.
The first truck did not knock down
the wood posts to enter the campus (as
they are supposed to do in an
emergency situation) because "we
didn't want to stop to see if they could
be knocked o\er." he said.
A crowd of more than 1000 spec
tators ringed the structure while the
fire was fought.
Firefighters enter
Firefighters first entered the house in
an attempt to combat the fire from the
inside, said Timko.
1 hey were forced to leave the house
when they found the hall filled with
noxious smoke and gasses, he said.
A second crew arriving at the scene
then began the attack from the outside.
The fire quickly spread to the third
tloor and then to the attic, a develop
ment that further complicated the
firefighters' task, said Timko.
'Concede roof
I he firefighters "conceded the roof'
when efforts to control the flames in
the attic by cutting holes in the roof
failed. Timko said.
"We couldn't get ahead of the fire,"
and had to let the roof burn so that we
could protect the rest of the house." he
said.
I he methods used were the "classic
ways to fight a fire of this type," he said.

Despite the firefighters' efforts, the flames consumed the third floor, the
the Encina t'ireol 1972 and was "one of
the most difficult to light ol recent
years." Timko said.
In addition to the total loss on the
third floor, the corner room on the sec
ond story where the Maze started \v;is
also destroyed. There was also smoke
and water damage to other areas of the
house. Timko added.
Daily reporters who entered the
house late yesterday afternoon tound
piles of debris from the roof shingles
sti aii throughout the third floor.
Water was dripping from the ex
posed roof beams and accumulated to a
depth of several inches in the hallways
before cascading down the staircase.
Walls were chaired and uutted 111

places, mirrors cracked, beds soaked,
and stereos, books and personal effects
drenched with water.
Corners ol various rooms were still
smoldering while firefighters poured
water 011 the embers.
Damage to the structure was esti
mated at more than $300,000 by
Robert Beth, director of risk manage
ment for the University. The Univer
sity has an accumulated self-insurance
I und ol about $ 1.7 million for accidents
such as these, lie said.
I'lie University has 110 provision to
provide insurance for the personal ef
fects ol the residents, lie said. Mow
ever. lie said, their belongings should
be covered under their parents'
homeowners insurance.

Hrefighters placed protective cover
ings over personal belongings on the
second and first floor, Timko said.
Salvage effects
The residents will he allowed to
enter the house tomorrow to retrieve
any salvagable personal effects, accord
ing to Norm Robinson, associate dean
for residential education.
Security was provided around the
house last night to protect personal be
longings. said James Lyons, dean ol
student affairs.
II more than 25 percent of the struc
ture is damaged, the entire structure
has to be brought up to current fire
codes, said [Jill Korff, Palo Alto l ire
Chief. The entire house will probably

have to be rebuilt from the ground up.
he said.
Fire codes
"Storey House wouldn't meet the
codes for new buildings." I d Scoles.
director of housing and food services
said. It did meet current codes for older
structures, he added.
More than $<S()().()()() worth ol work
was recently performed to upgrade
both fire detection systems and escape
routes in the row houses, Scoles said.
Smoke detectors were installed in
Storey House last summer, he said In
addition, a fire escape was added to
those already on the building, Scol- s
said.
Students in Storey anil other
houses are "adequately protected'

he w;ii nod ot a lire and to escape safely,
he said.
Ihe Iniversity hegan a policy 10
Nears ago to install sprinkler systems 111
new and renovated residence luills on
campus. Scoles said. Row houses that
have such systems include 558
Mayfield. Delta I psilon. BetaTheta Pi
and Ihirlhurt, he said.
Sprinkler systems have not been in
stalled m other houses because the
I diversity does not have the $40,000
to $50,000 needed per house to do so.
Scoles said.
A report commissioned by the Uni
versity on "the total aspect of lire
safety in all row residences" is nearing
completion, said Peter Hopf. associate
diicctor ot facilities and properties.

The report will examine the current
state ot code compliance in the houses
and will judge the adequacy ot the pre
sent systems, he said.
Storey House is one of the houses to
be examined in the report.
Smoke from the tire wafted into
nearby Lathrop. Columbae and Sigma
Chi houses. No damage to these houses
was reported.
Parnie Storey House was completed
in 1900 and was originally designed to
be the Delta Gamma sorority house,
according to Mary Hall, an expert on
Stanford history.
Ihe structure was remodeled in
1933 and became a row house in the
40s when sororities were banned from
the campus, she said.

A three-alarm electrical fire gutted
much of the upper floors of Store)
House yesterday afternoon, lea\ ing the
building almost a total loss.
None of the 39 female residents was
injured in the blaze, which caused an
estimated $300.000 to $400.000 dam
age to the KO-year-old structure.
Two firefighters were slightly in
jured while containing the fire. They
were hospitalized and released shortly
thereafter.
A smoke detector relayed the initial
alarm to the Palo Alto l ire Depart
ment at 2:15 p.m. The first truck ar
med at the scene six minutes later, ac
cording to Battalion Chief Charles
Challenger.
The fire started in the second story
corner room of Suzie I'az and Jennie
Thompson when electrical wiring from
a refrigerator to a wall outlet over
heated. said Santa Clara County Fire
Marshal Cliff Johnson.
The room was just smoking when
resident Tina Rising pulled Paz out of
the room. Paz had been sleeping in the
room just before the fire broke out.
Rising said.
Another Storey resident, Pam
Hutchcraft. said she tried to find a fire
extinguisher on the floor to battle the
blaze with. She said she couldn't find
one on that floor, and had to go
downstairs to get one.
By the time she arri\ed back at the
room, the fire was too large for
her to control, she said.
The 15 women in the house were
then alerted and left the house. Hutch
craft said.
Evacuated
A lire extinguisher was found on the
second tloor after the blaze was extin
guished. according to Santa Clara
County l ire Marshal Cliff Johnson.
I he tire probably could not have been
put out with just an extinguisher, he
added.
Rumors that the lire extinguishers

on the tloor had been stolen or tam
pered with before the fire remain un
substantiated.
A total of 13 \ehicles including six
fire engines and three fire trucks were
called to combat the blaze, which was
not contained until 4:5 1 p.m., said Fire
Captain J.D. Timko.
Delayed arrival
The arri\ al time of the first truck was
delayed by the bollards which border
the inner campus, according to firefigh
ter Lee Caudill.
"We were at most two minutes
slower in responding." because of the
need to go "the long way around" to
get to the fire, he said.
The first truck did not knock down
the wood posts to enter the campus (as
they are supposed to do in an
emergency situation) because "we
didn't want to stop to see if they could
be knocked o\er." he said.
A crowd of more than 1000 spec
tators ringed the structure while the
fire was fought.
Firefighters enter
Firefighters first entered the house in
an attempt to combat the fire from the
inside, said Timko.
1 hey were forced to leave the house
when they found the hall filled with
noxious smoke and gasses, he said.
A second crew arriving at the scene
then began the attack from the outside.
The fire quickly spread to the third
tloor and then to the attic, a develop
ment that further complicated the
firefighters' task, said Timko.
'Concede roof
I he firefighters "conceded the roof'
when efforts to control the flames in
the attic by cutting holes in the roof
failed. Timko said.
"We couldn't get ahead of the fire,"
and had to let the roof burn so that we
could protect the rest of the house." he
said.

In addition to the total loss on the
third floor, the corner room on the sec

A three-alarm electrical fire gutted
much of the upper floors of Store)
House yesterday afternoon, lea\ ing the
building almost a total loss.
None of the 39 female residents was
injured in the blaze, which caused an
estimated $300.000 to $400.000 dam
age to the KO-year-old structure.
Two firefighters were slightly in
jured while containing the fire. They
were hospitalized and released shortly
thereafter.
A smoke detector relayed the initial
alarm to the Palo Alto l ire Depart
ment at 2:15 p.m. The first truck ar
med at the scene six minutes later, ac
cording to Battalion Chief Charles
Challenger.
The fire started in the second story
corner room of Suzie I'az and Jennie
Thompson when electrical wiring from
a refrigerator to a wall outlet over
heated. said Santa Clara County Fire
Marshal Cliff Johnson.
The room was just smoking when
resident Tina Rising pulled Paz out of
the room. Paz had been sleeping in the
room just before the fire broke out.
Rising said.
Another Storey resident, Pam
Hutchcraft. said she tried to find a fire
extinguisher on the floor to battle the
blaze with. She said she couldn't find
one on that floor, and had to go
downstairs to get one.
By the time she arri\ed back at the
room, the fire was too large for
her to control, she said.
The 15 women in the house were
then alerted and left the house. Hutch
craft said.
Evacuated
A lire extinguisher was found on the
second tloor after the blaze was extin
guished. according to Santa Clara
County l ire Marshal Cliff Johnson.
I he tire probably could not have been
put out with just an extinguisher, he
added.
Rumors that the lire extinguishers

on the tloor had been stolen or tam
pered with before the fire remain un
substantiated.
A total of 13 \ehicles including six
fire engines and three fire trucks were
called to combat the blaze, which was
not contained until 4:5 1 p.m., said Fire
Captain J.D. Timko.
Delayed arrival
The arri\ al time of the first truck was
delayed by the bollards which border
the inner campus, according to firefigh
ter Lee Caudill.
"We were at most two minutes
slower in responding." because of the
need to go "the long way around" to
get to the fire, he said.
The first truck did not knock down
the wood posts to enter the campus (as
they are supposed to do in an
emergency situation) because "we
didn't want to stop to see if they could
be knocked o\er." he said.
A crowd of more than 1000 spec
tators ringed the structure while the
fire was fought.
Firefighters enter
Firefighters first entered the house in
an attempt to combat the fire from the
inside, said Timko.
1 hey were forced to leave the house
when they found the hall filled with
noxious smoke and gasses, he said.
A second crew arriving at the scene
then began the attack from the outside.
The fire quickly spread to the third
tloor and then to the attic, a develop
ment that further complicated the
firefighters' task, said Timko.
'Concede roof
I he firefighters "conceded the roof'
when efforts to control the flames in
the attic by cutting holes in the roof
failed. Timko said.
"We couldn't get ahead of the fire,"
and had to let the roof burn so that we
could protect the rest of the house." he
said.
I he methods used were the "classic
ways to fight a fire of this type," he said.
The blaze was the laruest here since

Despite the firefighters' efforts, the flames consumed the third floor, the
the Encina t'ireol 1972 and was "one of
the most difficult to light ol recent
years." Timko said.
In addition to the total loss on the
third floor, the corner room on the sec
ond story where the Maze started \v;is
also destroyed. There was also smoke
and water damage to other areas of the
house. Timko added.
Daily reporters who entered the
house late yesterday afternoon tound
piles of debris from the roof shingles
sti aii throughout the third floor.
Water was dripping from the ex
posed roof beams and accumulated to a
depth of several inches in the hallways
before cascading down the staircase.
Walls were chaired and uutted 111

places, mirrors cracked, beds soaked,
and stereos, books and personal effects
drenched with water.
Corners ol various rooms were still
smoldering while firefighters poured
water 011 the embers.
Damage to the structure was esti
mated at more than $300,000 by
Robert Beth, director of risk manage
ment for the University. The Univer
sity has an accumulated self-insurance
I und ol about $ 1.7 million for accidents
such as these, lie said.
I'lie University has 110 provision to
provide insurance for the personal ef
fects ol the residents, lie said. Mow
ever. lie said, their belongings should
be covered under their parents'
homeowners insurance.

Hrefighters placed protective cover
ings over personal belongings on the
second and first floor, Timko said.
Salvage effects
The residents will he allowed to
enter the house tomorrow to retrieve
any salvagable personal effects, accord
ing to Norm Robinson, associate dean
for residential education.
Security was provided around the
house last night to protect personal be
longings. said James Lyons, dean ol
student affairs.
II more than 25 percent of the struc
ture is damaged, the entire structure
has to be brought up to current fire
codes, said [Jill Korff, Palo Alto l ire
Chief. The entire house will probably

have to be rebuilt from the ground up.
he said.
Fire codes
"Storey House wouldn't meet the
codes for new buildings." I d Scoles.
director of housing and food services
said. It did meet current codes for older
structures, he added.
More than $<S()().()()() worth ol work
was recently performed to upgrade
both fire detection systems and escape
routes in the row houses, Scoles said.
Smoke detectors were installed in
Storey House last summer, he said In
addition, a fire escape was added to
those already on the building, Scol- s
said.
