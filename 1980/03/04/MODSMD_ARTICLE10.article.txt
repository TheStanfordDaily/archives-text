# Tanzania experiment faces difficulties
## 
### David Lamb The Los Angeles Times 
DAR F.S SALAAM, Tanzania — In
foreign capitals they call him the conscience
ol Black Africa. Here at home he is known
simply as Mwalimu. the Swahili word tor
teacher. Scholars and statesmen from both
East and West seek his advice: Moscow and
Washington analyze his every word.
I or 1 9 years. Julius Nyerere has enjoyed a
position of respect unique among African
heads ol state He is a man ol intellect, humor
and charm. His salary as president of Tan
zania is only $6000 a year, and he neither
pilfers the national treasury nordoes he build
monuments to himself. His blueprint for
socialism is a textbook model of Third World
development.
At his modest beachfront home. Nyerere
entertains guests on his veranda without the
slightest touch ol pomp. Flies bu/z about and
servants in shabby jackets serve warm
orange soda. Nyerere kicks off his shoes and
begins his discourse on Africa. Few visitors
leave his presence without being spellbound.
President Jimmy Carter, welcoming Nye
rere to the White House in 1977. praised him
as "a senior statesman, a scholar, a
philosopher, a great writer" who "has for
gone material wealth and ease in a sacrificial
way for his own people."
Different talk
Nyerere, 57. is indeed all those things. But
in Dares Salaam and other African capitals,
one hears a different kind of talk these days.
What Nyerere theorizes, some people say, is
not necessarily what Nyerere practices. And
what he practices is bringing few visible be
nefits to his country. Among other criticisms
are the following:

— No other African president has ever
overthrown a neighboring government. Nye
rere has helped topple three — the Comoros
in 1975, the Seychelles in 1977 and Uganda
in 1979. He has 20,000 troops in Uganda.
120 in the Seychelles and had. until recently,
400 in Mozambique.
— Until last year, when Nyerere granted
amnesty to 6400 prisoners. Tanzania held
more political prisoners than South Africa. It
still holds hundreds, according to Amnesty
International, the London-based human
rights organization. No dissent is tolerated by
Nyerere, the newspapers long ago were
brought under government control, and all
avenues of opposition and free expression
are closed.
— Although he complains that the West
uses foreign aid as a lever for influence, Nye
rere accepts more of it than any other presi
dent in Black Africa. This year Tanzania is
expected to receive $600 million in grants
and low-interest loans.
— Despite the money, few nations have
made such modest progress in the indepen
dence era. Agricultural production is drop
ping. factories are limping along at about 40
percent of capacity, Dares Salaam grows
shabbier by the day, and a listlessness grips
the land.
On paper
"On paper everything Nyerere advocates
looks perfect," a representative of a Christ
ian aid organization said recently.
"Nyerere and Tanzania are what white
liberals think Africa should be all about —
non-aligned, socialistic, poor, idealistic. But
the truth is that the place is a disaster area,
and the Tanzanians have become the most
de-motivated people I've seen anywhere in

the world."
I.ike most Third World nations, Tanzania
has been buffeted by many forces beyond its
control: the collapse of sisal prices on the
world market in the mid-19605, a drought in
the early 19705, the rise of oil prices.
Many critics contend that Tanzania's most
pressing problems are made at home. Nye
rere has deliberately stripped the country of
all economic incentives — anyone earning
more than $30,000 a year is in the 95 percent
tax bracket — and as a result production has
declined, corruption has increased and inef
ficiency has reached mind-boggling levels.
Incentive?
' I'm not at all sure Nyerere's idealism
translates into a workable African system," a
Ghanian diplomat in another capital said.
"He tells people to grow more, to work har
der. to forget personal gain. But what's the
incentive he's offering them?"
Nevertheless, Nyerere insists that his is the
only path for his 16 million countrymen.
"People who think Tanzania will change
her cherished policy of ujamaa (socialism)
and self-reliance because of the current
economic difficulties are wasting their time,"
Nyerere said recently, "We shall never
change."
Mucii of Tanzania's economic difficulty
stems from the $500 million it cost Nyerere
to overthrow Ugandan President ldi Amin in
a seven-month war last year. Nyerere asked
the West to reimburse him for the cost of the
war. but with Uganda now a quast-colony of
Tanzania (Nyerere has veto power over all
major government decisions in Kampala), no
one has come through.
