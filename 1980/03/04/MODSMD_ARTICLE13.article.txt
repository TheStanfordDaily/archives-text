## Draw changes suggested THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS 
### 
On Jan. 28, 1980, the Re
sidences Subcommittee of the
Committee on Services to Stu
dents (a student majority com
mittee) made recommendations
for the alteration of the 1980
Draw policies concerning special
priorities and returning-resident
priorities. The recommendations
are as follows:
1) The number of priority
categories in addition to that of
returning resident he limited to
two.
2) Only one priority may re
quire visiting the house and
further, the maximum number of
visits should be limited to two.
3) No eating associate priority
should be allowed.
4) The returning resident prior
ity should not be granted to stu
dents seeking housing in their
non-guaranteed year.
The committee affirms the
principle that the purpose of the
priorities is to educate prospec
tive and current residents about
the lifestyles and requirements
associated with particular dorms
or houses. Thus any activity re
quired to obtain a priority should
be reasonable and related to this
objective.
The committee is concerned,
however, that multiple visits to a
house in order to climb a scale of
priorities did little to achieve the
purpose that priorities are meant
to fulfill, and indeed added need

lessly to the complexity and diffi
culty of the draw.
Furthermore, the committee
felt that the issuance of priorities
to eating associates is unfair in
that it is unattainable without
considerable expense to those
who must purchase University
meal plans. Priorities issued to
eating associates are thus not ob
jective in nature as they are not
attainable by all who want them.
In recommending that return
ing resident priority not be
granted to those people in a
non-guaranteed year, the com
mittee is trying to correct a situa
tion in which non-guaranteed
students may receive housing be
fore those with guarantees. Such
a situation is in part the reason
for guarantees in the first place,
and has created an impression of
unfairness among many stu
dents.
Consistent with the goal of

continuity within the dorms,
however, the committee wishes
to emphasize that returning resi
dent priority will he granted to
guaranteed students even if their
non-guaranteed year intervenes
between the two guaranteed
years.
The committee believes that
these changes, which are plan
ned to go into effect for the Draw
this spring, will make the Draw
less complex, less time
consuming and more equitable.
Through the rest of this year we
will continue to consider any
other changes necessary to make
the Draw the most satisfactory
process possible.
