# Correction
## 
### 
In David Miller's column of
Feb. 25, "Abandon two-party
system," the word "never" was
omitted from the first paragraph.
The correct version should
have read,"Historian T.S. Kuhn
once pointed out that bad ideas
are never rejected simply be
cause they are known to be false
or inadequate. . .."
The Daily regrets the error.
