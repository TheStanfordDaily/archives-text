# Grad, admissions dean debate Nader ETS study
## Karen Croft Examine tests' role in education 
### 
In the February 19N0 issue ot the Stanford Observer and
the Jan. 17. 1980 issue ot the Dean of Admissions
Fred Hargadon is quoted extensively on the subject ot stan
dardized tests, admissions policies, and the report The Reign
of Educational Testing Service (ETS): The Corporation that
Makes Up Minds.
As one ot the editors ot Ralph Nader's recent report, let
me assure you that each (it Hargadon's points can be ettec
tively rebutted. Let me comment on just a feu:

Honestly, / hoped for a more even-handed,
measured response from Hargadon - one
calling for a closer look at this giant testing
institution, ETS, and its influence over all
the students in this country.

Hargadon states, rather misleadingly: that "less than one
percent of the nation's leading private colleges and univer
sities cite test scores as the most important factor in admis
sions decisions."
To he exact, in a 1979 College Board survey (to which I
assume he refers in his statement), most ot the tour-year
colleges didn't list anything as the "most important factor in
admissions, and more than 50 percent said that tests were a
"\ery importatnt" factor.Although cut-offs may not he used
at Stanford. 30 percent ot all colleges do use them (as found
in the same 1979 College Boards survey).
"Nader and his supporters." contrary to Hargadon's be
lief. do want to acknowledge the variation in quality and
courses offered hy the 26.000 high schools in this country.
But the use of test scores does not equalize these variations.
The tests add only two to five percent accuracy to high school
averages in the prediction of college grades.
This slim increase is gained at the cost of systematically
littering out the low-income students who receive the lowest
ETS scores. Instead, a wider variety of selection criteria
would truly reflect the diversity ot American education —
these include personal interviews, examples of accomplish
ments hy the students in their high school and extra
curricular activities, and specific examples ot their abilities
(such as essays rather then multiple-choice tests to show
writing skills).

It is worth noting that ETS itself has found previous ac
complishments to be the best predictors of future success; at
the same time they have not been found — unlike the tests—
to correlate to income.
Hargadon says"The testing agencies are being unfairly
whipsawed here. II there are colleges and universities which
err 111 overemphasis placed on tests scores, that is not reason
to go after the testing agencies."
What we have to realize is that schools rely on the tests in
large part because ot the institutional prestige ot ETS and
because ETS purports to measure such desirable intangibles
as "aptitude" and "potential for future success" so impor
tant to admissions officers. The testing agencies claim to
measure the "aptitude" and predict the chances of "success"
tor eight million people annually.
But they have not accepted the responsibility of disclosing
to the test-takers exactly how the tests are developed and
used by the "gatekeepers" of professional as well as scholas
tic opportunity. To press lor this accountability is the goal of
the Truth-in-Testing legislation that Hargadon describes as
"consumer fraud."
My four years at Stanford taught me to respect intelligent
analysis and diversity ot opinion. One of the most positive
aspects of lite on campus was the continuing and open de
bate on every subject. 1 don't believe it helps the quest for
truth or clarity to brand someone "willfully ignorant' or to
categorically dismiss a report ot this magnitude and value.
Honestly. I hoped tor a more even-handed, measured
response from Hargadon — one calling for a closer look at
this giant testing institution. ETS. and its influence over all
the students in this country. But perhaps his institutional
allegiance as head of the College Board has overshadowed
his commitment to open debate. The long-standing, unques
tioning acceptance of ETS' central role in American educa
tion is something to be examined, in and of itself.
I hope Hargadon will not shut off the debate so early by
denouncing outright the value of Nairn's and Nader's argu
ments. This subject is of vital interest not only to the stu
dents. faculty, and staff ol Stanford University, but to
families across the country.
I suggest and request that Nairn and Nader be invited to
Stanford lor a debate with Hargadon in tront of the entire
student body. I think everyone involved would benefit from
an open forum on this important topic.
