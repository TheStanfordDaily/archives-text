## Report 'clip and paste' job 
### 
In true Naderite fashion. Croft, in her column suggests
that any strongly expressed disagreement with what is
sues forth from the self-appointed spokesmen for "the
public interest" in their bunker there on the Potomac
can only be an attempt to close oft debate on the subject
of testing. Indeed, let me suggest that Ralph Nader and
his associates do not know what an open mind is nor
have they any idea of what true research is all about.
In retrospect, my referring to Naderasbeing"willfully
ignorant" on the subject of testing was a generous com
ment. At that time I had readonly the 52-page summary
ot his "study." Hav ing now read the full document, 1 find
it an abominable "clip and paste" job masquerading as
"research." It is available only as a reprint costing about
$30. which leads me to believe no respectable publisher
would touch it.
Croft suggests she can "effectively rebut",-my criti
cisms ot the report, and attempts to do so in a variety of
ways. In quoting directly from the report she simply
quotes the authors on the matter of how useful the tests
are.

'I am tempted to suggest that Croft, as an
editor of the Nader-Nairn report on
testing, has an allegiance to Nader which
leads her to want to shut off any criticism
of that report and to engage in questioning
the motives of anyone who makes such
criticisms

The authors are wrong. She is wrong. Their use of
statistics is wrong. Their conclusion is wrong. Even the
media, which is generous to Nader, have pointed this out
in articles from coast to coast.
Curiously, hut not untypical of Naderite thought pro
cesses, the finding of a recent survey indicating that
fewer than one percent of colleges and universities cite
test scores as the most important factor in admissions is

"effectively rebutted" by Croft by pointing out that
"most of the four year colleges didn't list anything as the
most important factor." It is not clear to me in just what
respect that constitutes a "rebuttal."
That some colleges and universities use cut-off scores
is known. It is, by the way, the College Board
which reports that fact, not any independent research on
the part of the Nader group. What we do not know, and
what the Naderites do not know, is what that means. At
what level are such cut-offs set? At a combined score (on
the SAT) of 1400? Or at a combined score of 600?
My impression is that cut-off scores, where used, are
generally set at the very low end of the scale, arc used
primarily by public institutions, and generally come into
play only when an applicant's grades fall below that level
which normally guarantees automatic admission to such
schools.
Nader and his associates keep talking about "ac
complishments" as the best predictors of "success in
lite." One has a difficult time knowing what "ac
complishments" he has in mind, save for his illustrating
the point on a recent Tonight show by suggesting singers
Crosby. Stills and Nash and Jackson Browne. He doesn't
have much to say about academic and intellectual ac
complishments, an area he is decidedly uncomfortable
with.
I am tempted to suggest that Croft, as an editor of the
Nader-Nairn report on testing, has an allegiance to
Nader which leads her to want to shut off any criticism of
that report and to engage in questioning the motives of
anyone who makes such criticisms. But I won't, for to do
so would be to revert to the tactic of Nader and his
associates: that of employing one set of standards for
themselves and a quite different set for the rest of us to
meet.
Croft must know that weeks ago, a member of the
Speaker's Bureau here at Stanford (and, not inciden
tally, a resident of the American Studies House) called
the Nader office in an attempt to arrange a debate bet
ween me and Nader. He was told Nader's fee would be
$4000.
That, folks, is a real live consumer fraud! I will be
happy to debate either Nader or Nairn, or both, should
they see lit to do so for expenses alone. Now that would
be in the "public interest." '
