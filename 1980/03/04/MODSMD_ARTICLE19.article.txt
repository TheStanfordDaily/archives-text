# Brown concerned with own career, not state
## 
### 
When we look at any political situation within our
system, it is very easy to be cynical and pessimistic. The
leaders that we have selected to lead us and in whom
we have put our utmost trust seem all too often to be
self-oriented and unworthy of the responsibility we give
them. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the highest
echelons of California state government.
Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown, self-styled idealist and
eccentric, has earned a reputation for opportunism. His
flip-flop positions on nuclear power in 1976 and on
Proposition 13 in 1978 have left voters wondering what
doctrinal commitment he will have next.
Wearing his ambition on his sleeve, he makes it obvi
ous to everyone that his primary concern is his own
career, and not the welfare of the state of California. The
neglect he shows for Californians in leaving the state to
campaign for the presidency epitomizes this selfishness.
(iiven these facts, it is amazing that Brown retained
the governor's seat in 1978 with the largest plurality of
votes in any gubernatorial race nationwide, while Re
publicans swept most of the other California races.
Fortunately for California, one of these Republican
winners was Lt. Gov. Mike Curb, who came to the office
as an eminently successful businessman but a political
virgin. This situation of the two leaders being from diffe
rent parties, for the first time this century, started a
battle that has raged ever since.
Of course the lieutenant governor must assume the
duties of chief executive when the governor is absent or
disabled in a state of emergency, but Curb has applied
that rule beyond the realm of emergency, and into the
realm of competitive politics.
For awhile, it was like a game; every time Brown left
the state. Curb would do the most drastic thing he could
think of to exercise his temporary power. His crucial act
was the appointment of a conservative judge to a South
ern California seat to which Brown had planned to ap
point a much more liberal jurist a week later.
In this instance. Curb recanted, but the basic question
was taken to court and the outcome was, in principle, in

favor of Curb. The Supreme Court said that Curb was
governor when Brown was out of the state.
Regardless of the court's decision, the voters should
ask themselves an ethical question: After all, we did
elect Brown governor, so shouldn't his ideas be carried
out. wherever he is?
No. True power is, and rightly should be, in the hands
of those willing to take responsibility for it.
If the governor has better things to do, such as running
for president and participating in demonstrations, then
maybe we should be led by someone else who is willing to

attend to this state full time.
It looks like Brown has little chance of winning his
party's nomination for president this year, but he proba
bly will stay in the race until June, to run in the California
primary. So, we will see just how much power Curb
chooses to employ during the governor's campaign, and
how much attention Brown pays to California after he
loses the presidential race, and decides he may again
need our votes someday.
The least we can do is pay attention to what each of
these leaders is doing. It's about time we knew which of
our politicians can be counted on and which cannot.
The fact is that Curb is not abusing any power at all;
the situation is totally in the hands of the governor.
Brown Gin stop Curb from being acting governor at any

time by simply staying home. But the governor chooses
to leave.
Whichever party one belongs to, and wherever one
stands on the political spectrum, one point cannot be
denied: Curb is taking responsibility for the office to
which we elected him, and Brown is not.
In evaluating the leadership qualities of our state offi
cials, consider the man who spends full time attending to
the needs of our state, and the man who exploits Califor
nia and Californians as a platform for the promulgation
of his national political image.

virgin. This situation of the two leaders being from diffe
rent parties, for the first time this century, started a
battle that has raged ever since.
Of course the lieutenant governor must assume the
duties of chief executive when the governor is absent or
disabled in a state of emergency, but Curb has applied
that rule beyond the realm of emergency, and into the
realm of competitive politics.
For awhile, it was like a game; every time Brown left
the state. Curb would do the most drastic thing he could
think of to exercise his temporary power. His crucial act
was the appointment of a conservative judge to a South
ern California seat to which Brown had planned to ap
point a much more liberal jurist a week later.
In this instance. Curb recanted, but the basic question
was taken to court and the outcome was, in principle, in

favor of Curb. The Supreme Court said that Curb was
governor when Brown was out of the state.
Regardless of the court's decision, the voters should
ask themselves an ethical question: After all, we did
elect Brown governor, so shouldn't his ideas be carried
out. wherever he is?
No. True power is, and rightly should be, in the hands
of those willing to take responsibility for it.
If the governor has better things to do, such as running
for president and participating in demonstrations, then
maybe we should be led by someone else who is willing to

attend to this state full time.
It looks like Brown has little chance of winning his
party's nomination for president this year, but he proba
bly will stay in the race until June, to run in the California
primary. So, we will see just how much power Curb
chooses to employ during the governor's campaign, and
how much attention Brown pays to California after he
loses the presidential race, and decides he may again
need our votes someday.
The least we can do is pay attention to what each of
these leaders is doing. It's about time we knew which of
our politicians can be counted on and which cannot.
The fact is that Curb is not abusing any power at all;
the situation is totally in the hands of the governor.
Brown Gin stop Curb from being acting governor at any

time by simply staying home. But the governor chooses
to leave.
Whichever party one belongs to, and wherever one
stands on the political spectrum, one point cannot be
denied: Curb is taking responsibility for the office to
which we elected him, and Brown is not.
In evaluating the leadership qualities of our state offi
cials, consider the man who spends full time attending to
the needs of our state, and the man who exploits Califor
nia and Californians as a platform for the promulgation
of his national political image.
