## 
### Fran Miller Staff Writer 
Amid occasional cries for visine and aspirin, the 39
Storey I louse women held a meeting last night at Roth
House to obtain answers to questions and discuss problems
caused by the fire which destroyed most ot their house
earlier yesterday.
Although most of the women arrived at Roth possessing
only the clothes they were wearing, several of them man
aged to secure a few valuable items such as jewelry before
they evacuated the house.
They remained calm as they listened to concerned ad
ministrators enumerate the steps that will he taken to lessen
the inconveniences resulting from the tire. The continuing
high tension was broken with light-hearted suggestions of
"Storey refugee" meal cards and the exemption from pay
ment of last month's phone bill as partial compensation tor
the loss.
Some of the women spent last night at Roth, while others
stayed with friends at other campus residences.
Among those present at the meeting, which preceded a
special steak dinner provided by Food Service, were Presi
dent Richard Lyman and his wife Jing, Dean ol Student
Affairs James Lyons, Vice-President and Provost Donald
Kennedy, Associate Dean for Residential Education Nor
man Robinson, Assistant Director of Residential Educa
tion Diana Conklin, Assistant Dean for Residential Educa
tion Alice Supton, Director of Housing and Food Service
Edward Scoles and Director of the Row Mike Bever.

Two people from Cowell Counseling and Psychological
Services offered their support to "anyone who wanted to
come in and talk."
Lyman commented that he is grateful the lire happened
in the afternoon instead of at night, and said that il there is a
benefit to he found, it is that it is bringing people together.
Pillows, towels and toothbrushes were provided almost
immediately by housing services, and a large collection ol
sleeping bags, clothes, shoes and toiletries are being fur
nished through various other sources.
Numerous faculty members have extended offers ol re
fuge to the women 011 both a short- and long-term basis.
Lyons said.
Thirty-nine roses from the Delta Kappa Epsilon frater
nity and a banner welcoming the homeless Storey residents
greeted them as they arrived at Roth for dinner.
Council of Presidents member Laura Mead said that
ASSU Special Services would prov ide items such as lecture
notes free of charge to Storey women.
Robinson said that the Row Office will serve as an infor
mation center lor residents and will coordinate most ol the
serv ices provided for fire victims. It will be open 24 hours a
day.
Meals will be served at Roth, and Robinson requested
that the women eat together in order to use this time to
exchange information and keep up with each other. He said
that the Bookstore has agreed to lend all needed textbooks.
Loans "without a check for credit rating" will be available
from Bever's office beginning today.

Robinson urged the women to think about other people
they would need to contact besides their parents, saying that
news ot the lire is certain to be widespread.
I lesaida lettei w ill be sent to faculty members containing
the names ol all Storey residents. Robinson assured their
cooperation in academic difficulties.
Robinson also asked the residents to draw up a list of
personal property, to be used for insurance purposes. He
appointed a committee to put together a daily newsletter to
answer questions and provide updates 011 housing and fi
nances.
Committees to begin coordinating housing alternatives,
message relaying, compiling lists of classes and professors
and answering questions concerning insurance and finances
were also established. Robinson also assured residents that
needed meal cards and student IDs will be provided as soon
as possible.
The meeting ended with a Storey resident's comment ol
thanks for all the aid. both material and emotional that the
community was providing.
Other residents' concerns ranged from obtaining sweats
and running shoes to the general problem faced by all.
"Although people are being really nice, it is just a matter of
inconvenience," one resident said.
The women, despite their frustration said they are very
appreciative of the support they are getting from the Uni
versity. Their empathy lor one another was evidenced by
the comforting hugs and sympathetic comments which were
abundant at the meeting.

"We just have to put ourselves hack together again, and
consider how fortunate we are that no one was hurt," com
mented cme shoeless Storey resident.
Some of the women, after realizing that everyone was
unhurt and accounted for. said they quickly began to worry
about chemistry finals and term papers. One resident was
seen hugging a firefighter after he handed her a term paper
he had rescued from the bla/e.
Although the mood had been set by teary-eyed lament
earlier in the day.the group last night seemed more shaken
by disbelief than by regret over lost possessions.
"It was incredible watching our house burn room by
room and not being able to do anything about it." com
mented one sophomore. "It'll make great conversation for
a long time." she added.
Sophomore Chris Mesa commented that smoke detectors
have gone off frequently, so no one thought this alarm was
"for real" in the beginning. She said that the incident has
"brought the group together," but expressed her concern
that the house itself was "basically a fire-trap."
In a preliminary meeting this afternoon all residents were
accounted for. and told to get in contact with their parents.
Lyons assured students that housing spaces would be
created, money provided and academic deadlines forgiven.
"We'll do our best to make it easy for you," he said.
His comment that the bulk of the strain would be on the
residents themselves was brought home by one student who
summarized her experience: "I think I now know how it
feels to be reallv destitute."

House to obtain answers to questions and discuss problems
caused by the fire which destroyed most ot their house
earlier yesterday.
Although most of the women arrived at Roth possessing
only the clothes they were wearing, several of them man
aged to secure a few valuable items such as jewelry before
they evacuated the house.
They remained calm as they listened to concerned ad
ministrators enumerate the steps that will he taken to lessen
the inconveniences resulting from the tire. The continuing
high tension was broken with light-hearted suggestions of
"Storey refugee" meal cards and the exemption from pay
ment of last month's phone bill as partial compensation tor
the loss.
Some of the women spent last night at Roth, while others
stayed with friends at other campus residences.
Among those present at the meeting, which preceded a
special steak dinner provided by Food Service, were Presi
dent Richard Lyman and his wife Jing, Dean ol Student
Affairs James Lyons, Vice-President and Provost Donald
Kennedy, Associate Dean for Residential Education Nor
man Robinson, Assistant Director of Residential Educa
tion Diana Conklin, Assistant Dean for Residential Educa
tion Alice Supton, Director of Housing and Food Service
Edward Scoles and Director of the Row Mike Bever.

Two people from Cowell Counseling and Psychological
Services offered their support to "anyone who wanted to
come in and talk."
Lyman commented that he is grateful the lire happened
in the afternoon instead of at night, and said that il there is a
benefit to he found, it is that it is bringing people together.
Pillows, towels and toothbrushes were provided almost
immediately by housing services, and a large collection ol
sleeping bags, clothes, shoes and toiletries are being fur
nished through various other sources.
Numerous faculty members have extended offers ol re
fuge to the women 011 both a short- and long-term basis.
Lyons said.
Thirty-nine roses from the Delta Kappa Epsilon frater
nity and a banner welcoming the homeless Storey residents
greeted them as they arrived at Roth for dinner.
Council of Presidents member Laura Mead said that
ASSU Special Services would prov ide items such as lecture
notes free of charge to Storey women.
Robinson said that the Row Office will serve as an infor
mation center lor residents and will coordinate most ol the
serv ices provided for fire victims. It will be open 24 hours a
day.
Meals will be served at Roth, and Robinson requested
that the women eat together in order to use this time to
exchange information and keep up with each other. He said
that the Bookstore has agreed to lend all needed textbooks.
Loans "without a check for credit rating" will be available
from Bever's office beginning today.

Robinson urged the women to think about other people
they would need to contact besides their parents, saying that
news ot the lire is certain to be widespread.
I lesaida lettei w ill be sent to faculty members containing
the names ol all Storey residents. Robinson assured their
cooperation in academic difficulties.
Robinson also asked the residents to draw up a list of
personal property, to be used for insurance purposes. He
appointed a committee to put together a daily newsletter to
answer questions and provide updates 011 housing and fi
nances.
Committees to begin coordinating housing alternatives,
message relaying, compiling lists of classes and professors
and answering questions concerning insurance and finances
were also established. Robinson also assured residents that
needed meal cards and student IDs will be provided as soon
as possible.
The meeting ended with a Storey resident's comment ol
thanks for all the aid. both material and emotional that the
community was providing.
Other residents' concerns ranged from obtaining sweats
and running shoes to the general problem faced by all.
"Although people are being really nice, it is just a matter of
inconvenience," one resident said.
The women, despite their frustration said they are very
appreciative of the support they are getting from the Uni
versity. Their empathy lor one another was evidenced by
the comforting hugs and sympathetic comments which were
abundant at the meeting.

"We just have to put ourselves hack together again, and
consider how fortunate we are that no one was hurt," com
mented cme shoeless Storey resident.
Some of the women, after realizing that everyone was
unhurt and accounted for. said they quickly began to worry
about chemistry finals and term papers. One resident was
seen hugging a firefighter after he handed her a term paper
he had rescued from the bla/e.
Although the mood had been set by teary-eyed lament
earlier in the day.the group last night seemed more shaken
by disbelief than by regret over lost possessions.
"It was incredible watching our house burn room by
room and not being able to do anything about it." com
mented one sophomore. "It'll make great conversation for
a long time." she added.
Sophomore Chris Mesa commented that smoke detectors
have gone off frequently, so no one thought this alarm was
"for real" in the beginning. She said that the incident has
"brought the group together," but expressed her concern
that the house itself was "basically a fire-trap."
In a preliminary meeting this afternoon all residents were
accounted for. and told to get in contact with their parents.
Lyons assured students that housing spaces would be
created, money provided and academic deadlines forgiven.
"We'll do our best to make it easy for you," he said.
His comment that the bulk of the strain would be on the
residents themselves was brought home by one student who
summarized her experience: "I think I now know how it
feels to be reallv destitute."
