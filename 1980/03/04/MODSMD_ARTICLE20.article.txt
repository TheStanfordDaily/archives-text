# RA selection process is rigorous
## 
### John Mason Staff Writer 
Imagine that you arc the house
associate (RA) in a fraternity —
the only "authority" in the house
— and some uninvited guests
begin disrupting a party. Do you
let the five largest residents
handle the intruders, or do you
call the police?
I low about if you were the RA
in charge of your dorm's "Great
Gatsby" party and a few mem
bers of a racial minority argued
that the party's theme rep
resented a period of prejudice
and oppression in America?
What would you tell them?
Questions like these, along
with many other types of queries,
are being formulated as the resi
dential education system gears
up for its annual selection of
RA's.
Informational meetings this
week will begin a two-stage pro
cess that placed 165 out ol 373
applicants in RA positions last
year.
As part of the first stage, all
candidates will be required to
submit an application form and a
brief essay by April 4. In addi
tion, they will have to obtain two
recommendations from people
who know both them and the
residential education system.
After they have turned in their
applications, each candidate will
be interviewed by a panel of cur
rent RAs, a resident fellow (RF),
and a representative from the
Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs.
This "first stage" of the selec
tion process is designed, in the
words of Assistant Dean of Stu
dent Affairs for Residential
Education Alice Supton, to "dis
tinguish between those students

who would make good residents
and those who would make good
staff members." In other words,
"candidates need to show more
than a likeable character," she
said.
Last year, KO applicants failed
to exhibit what Supton called
"demonstrated strength in at
least one area of job responsibil
ity," and were therefore rejected
after the first stage.
The second stage brings the
remaining applicants together
with their potential employers,
the RFs. This interaction takes
place in a number of ways, de
pending upon which dorm the
candidate is interested in.
Bob Hamrdla, RF in Larkin
House, Stern Hall, said he invites
any applicant interested in his
dorm to attend one in a series of
"group interviews." At these
meetings Hamrdla poses ques
tions and lets the candidates dis
cuss them among themselves
while he evaluates their ability to
interact. Skillful and considerate
discussants are invited back for a
final interview, he said.
Another approach is the one
Dan Okimoto, RF in Toyon
Hall, uses. Okimoto and his cur
rent residence staff read through
the files of all the applicants, ar
riving at a list of 40 candidates.
These students are then invited
to Okimoto's apartment for a
group dinner/interview.
The 15 students who make the
best impression then become the
objects of his scrutiny. Okimoto
may drop by their current resi
dence to talk to staff or students
who have insights into the candi
date's RA potential. Or. he may
seek out members of organiza
tions to which the candidate be
longs.

Is his an intrusion of the can
didate's privacy? Not so, said
Okimoto. He explained that
applicants are always informed
of this process; and that his in
quiry "never borders on gossip.
It's a discussion of qualities." On
the other hand, as Toyon staff
member Ann Jennings noted
wryly, "It's a little disconcerting
at first."
Still another, simpler ap
proach is the one used by Dan
and Maureen Williams. RFs in
Branner Hall. They go through
and read all the files of students
interested in Branner, give indi
vidual interviews to 50, and
select as many students as are
needed to fill spots being vacated
by departing RAs.
And what arc the RFs looking
for in a potential RA? For
Hamrdla it is common sense and
openness, for Okimoto it is the
capability to facilitate interper
sonal relations and "a broad no
tion of residential education,"
and for the Williams it is "some
one whom we like."
But making it through the
selection process is only the first,
and perhaps least imposing of
the challenges awaiting the po
tential RA. The job itself is a
demanding and difficult one,
while the material rewards are
limited — a single room and
$1550-$ 1950 for the year (de
pending upon the RA's
academic level and staff experi
ence).
But for many RAs, the costs
and benefits of the job stack up
in a way too subtle to be captured
by hours spent and dollars
earned. As Tom Wilmanns, RA
in Loro House in Florence
Moore put it,"I don't see how
anyone could remain sane if they

were just doing it for the
money."
Indeed, to an outsider, the
world of the RA often seems a
harried one, where spare time
and energy a ( e rare or non
existent. And the Office of Resi
dential Education's slogan being
"people first, students second,
and RAs last" never ever seems
to fit, many RAs said.
Resident fellows and rep
resentatives from the Office of
Residential Education insist that
they encourage RAs to keep a
normal perspective; but the RAs
themselves seem to plunge —
knowingly — headlong into their
jobs.
Maureen Williams com
mented that "the motivations
(for becoming an RA) are quite
noble," and this is born out by
the reflections made by curent
RAs.
Wilmanns and Larkin House
RA Janice Kimball both said
they were rewarded by and
proud of their roles as counselors
and facilitators in their dorms.
Even law and business student
John Ouigley, who said his role
as RA in the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity was mostly administra
tive, said that counseling house
members about professional
schools was a most gratifying and
important activity.
And perhaps equally impor
tant to RAs are those memora
ble things which only happen to
them because of their position on
the residence staff.
Instances are known in which
they have had pies thrown at
them; the doors to their rooms
have been stolen; and sometimes
they have come home from the
library to find nude residents
lounging in their rooms.

associate (RA) in a fraternity —
the only "authority" in the house
— and some uninvited guests
begin disrupting a party. Do you
let the five largest residents
handle the intruders, or do you
call the police?
I low about if you were the RA
in charge of your dorm's "Great
Gatsby" party and a few mem
bers of a racial minority argued
that the party's theme rep
resented a period of prejudice
and oppression in America?
What would you tell them?
Questions like these, along
with many other types of queries,
are being formulated as the resi
dential education system gears
up for its annual selection of
RA's.
Informational meetings this
week will begin a two-stage pro
cess that placed 165 out ol 373
applicants in RA positions last
year.
As part of the first stage, all
candidates will be required to
submit an application form and a
brief essay by April 4. In addi
tion, they will have to obtain two
recommendations from people
who know both them and the
residential education system.
After they have turned in their
applications, each candidate will
be interviewed by a panel of cur
rent RAs, a resident fellow (RF),
and a representative from the
Office of the Dean of Student
Affairs.
This "first stage" of the selec
tion process is designed, in the
words of Assistant Dean of Stu
dent Affairs for Residential
Education Alice Supton, to "dis
tinguish between those students

who would make good residents
and those who would make good
staff members." In other words,
"candidates need to show more
than a likeable character," she
said.
Last year, KO applicants failed
to exhibit what Supton called
"demonstrated strength in at
least one area of job responsibil
ity," and were therefore rejected
after the first stage.
The second stage brings the
remaining applicants together
with their potential employers,
the RFs. This interaction takes
place in a number of ways, de
pending upon which dorm the
candidate is interested in.
Bob Hamrdla, RF in Larkin
House, Stern Hall, said he invites
any applicant interested in his
dorm to attend one in a series of
"group interviews." At these
meetings Hamrdla poses ques
tions and lets the candidates dis
cuss them among themselves
while he evaluates their ability to
interact. Skillful and considerate
discussants are invited back for a
final interview, he said.
Another approach is the one
Dan Okimoto, RF in Toyon
Hall, uses. Okimoto and his cur
rent residence staff read through
the files of all the applicants, ar
riving at a list of 40 candidates.
These students are then invited
to Okimoto's apartment for a
group dinner/interview.
The 15 students who make the
best impression then become the
objects of his scrutiny. Okimoto
may drop by their current resi
dence to talk to staff or students
who have insights into the candi
date's RA potential. Or. he may
seek out members of organiza
tions to which the candidate be
longs.

Is his an intrusion of the can
didate's privacy? Not so, said
Okimoto. He explained that
applicants are always informed
of this process; and that his in
quiry "never borders on gossip.
It's a discussion of qualities." On
the other hand, as Toyon staff
member Ann Jennings noted
wryly, "It's a little disconcerting
at first."
Still another, simpler ap
proach is the one used by Dan
and Maureen Williams. RFs in
Branner Hall. They go through
and read all the files of students
interested in Branner, give indi
vidual interviews to 50, and
select as many students as are
needed to fill spots being vacated
by departing RAs.
And what arc the RFs looking
for in a potential RA? For
Hamrdla it is common sense and
openness, for Okimoto it is the
capability to facilitate interper
sonal relations and "a broad no
tion of residential education,"
and for the Williams it is "some
one whom we like."
But making it through the
selection process is only the first,
and perhaps least imposing of
the challenges awaiting the po
tential RA. The job itself is a
demanding and difficult one,
while the material rewards are
limited — a single room and
$1550-$ 1950 for the year (de
pending upon the RA's
academic level and staff experi
ence).
But for many RAs, the costs
and benefits of the job stack up
in a way too subtle to be captured
by hours spent and dollars
earned. As Tom Wilmanns, RA
in Loro House in Florence
Moore put it,"I don't see how
anyone could remain sane if they

were just doing it for the
money."
Indeed, to an outsider, the
world of the RA often seems a
harried one, where spare time
and energy a ( e rare or non
existent. And the Office of Resi
dential Education's slogan being
"people first, students second,
and RAs last" never ever seems
to fit, many RAs said.
Resident fellows and rep
resentatives from the Office of
Residential Education insist that
they encourage RAs to keep a
normal perspective; but the RAs
themselves seem to plunge —
knowingly — headlong into their
jobs.
Maureen Williams com
mented that "the motivations
(for becoming an RA) are quite
noble," and this is born out by
the reflections made by curent
RAs.
Wilmanns and Larkin House
RA Janice Kimball both said
they were rewarded by and
proud of their roles as counselors
and facilitators in their dorms.
Even law and business student
John Ouigley, who said his role
as RA in the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity was mostly administra
tive, said that counseling house
members about professional
schools was a most gratifying and
important activity.
And perhaps equally impor
tant to RAs are those memora
ble things which only happen to
them because of their position on
the residence staff.
Instances are known in which
they have had pies thrown at
them; the doors to their rooms
have been stolen; and sometimes
they have come home from the
library to find nude residents
lounging in their rooms.
