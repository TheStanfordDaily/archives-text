### Thomas Morgan The Washington Post 
RICHMOND. Va — The na
tion's black leaders ended a
three-day conference here
Saturday during which the ab
sence of presidential candidates
invited to a forum underscored a
deepening fear and resentment
that the media, the Congress and
the candidates are ignoring im
portant issues in the black com
munity.
At one conference session, the

Rev. Jesse Jackson, leader of
Operation PUSH, drew thun
derous applause when he charac
terized the presidential cam
paign as a "three-ring circus"
and an "exercise in entertain
ment and a diversion from the
real issues that affect the lives of
Americans, especially black
Americans."
Richmond Mayor Richard
Hatcher, one of the conference
convenors, criticized the media
for focusing on the canceled

presidential forum and diverting
attention from what he said were
critical areas affecting black
people.
"We came here to write a
black agenda.
"We came here to bring blacks
of all .political persuasions to
gether in unity, and we have
achieved that unity."
The black leaders, who rep
resented about 300 organiza
tions that touch every area in the
black community, discussed is
sues and strategies with a sense

of urgency about combating
eroding civil rights gains and af
firmative action policies and
U.S. budget cuts that affect na
tional programs that give aid to
the poor.
Benjamin Hooks, head of the
National Assn. for the Ad
vancement of Colored People,
told the conference that "the
economic decline of the late "70s
has all but wiped out the steady
economic progress that blacks
made in the 19605.
"In his dissent in the Bakke
decision. (Supreme Court Jus
tice) Thurgood Marshall re
minded this nation that the black
male who completes four years
of college can expect a median
annual income of merely $110
more than a white male who has
only a high school diploma,"
Hooks said.
The black leaders devised an
agenda for the 1980s that sets
forth areas of concern in affirma
tive action, housing, unemploy
ment, voter registration and
health care, some of them with
specific timetables.
