# Alumnae counsel students
## 
### Kathy Bowman Staff Writer 
Stanford women may meet informally with
alumnae to discuss career interests during spring
break, under the auspices of the Stanford Profes
sional Women's Club of Los Angeles.
Through the Careers Externship Program, a stu
dent will be able to spend time at a club member's
job, to watch day-to-day experiences of her career
and to ask questions.
"It's like having a day in the field. - ' said Margot
Palmer, Alumni Association Student Program Di
rector. Palmer said that students will spend varying
amounts of time with the alumnae, "some for a
couple of hours, and others will stay at the job all
day." The program will last a week, and according
to Palmer. 130 places are available. The deadline
for signups is tomorrow.
Participating alumnae's fields include editing,
television and novel writing, education, special
education, movie production, real estate, comput
ers, social science, economics, urban planning,
counseling and law.
While the program is not a placement service,
"contacts are valuable, and can often lead to jobs,
said Palmer. "It's always good to know people in
the field you're interested in."
Senior Barbie Skinner, who is coordinating the,

University's part in the program and will partici
pate in it, said that many people have asked why
only women students are included in the program.
Palmer said that the Stanford Professional Wo
men's Club made this policy. Skinner said she
hopes to see a similar program next year for men.
and possibly for students in the Bay area.
"But there are Alumni Contact Services that are
available to anyone, anytime," said Palmer. Ac
cording to Palmer, these contact services are lo
cated in the Bay area, Los Angeles. Oregon and
Southwest Washington, New York and Boston.
The Bay area contact service alone has nine
hundred contacts, she added.
Janice Kimball, one of the 40 students who
participated last year, also said she hopes the prog
ram can "branch out as much as posssible." Kim
ball, who spent her time with a senior vice
president at a bank, said the alumna "was very
receptive to all my questions," but that she "would
have liked a chance to observe more of what she
was doing on the job."
Kimball added, "I think it's a terrific idea. It's
good for college women to be exposed to the fact
that there are successful women in the business
world. It inspires us to make goals higher and be
more aggressive in seeking a job."
