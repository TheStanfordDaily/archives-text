# Proposal afoot for ASSU Consumer Affairs Bureau
## 
### Kathy Fogarty Staff Writer 
A student-run Consumer Af
fairs Bureau, dedicated to in
forming people about the pro
ducts and services they use. has
been set up by Council of Presi
dents member Laura Mead and
senior David Gerst.
The newly formed organiza
tion "will provide students with
an opportunity to explore op
tions, make conscious choices
and reach decisions" on various
consumer-related issues, said
Mead.
The organization could re
search student alcohol consump
tion in conjunction with Cowell
Student Health Service, survey
student opinion of Food Service
and discover how much demand
exists for lighted tennis courts,
lor example. These are the pro
jects outlined in a proposal for
the bureau that Mead and Gerst
wrote.
The bureau will help facilitate
student-initiated research, pro
vide a means for community
members to contact student re
searchers for consumer projects
and keep a library of completed
projects, they said.
According to the proposal put
before the ASSU Senate, the
bureau will combine and im
prove upon the two consumer

groups — Public Interest Re
search Group (PIRG) and the
ASSU Consumer Affairs Task
Force — that were in operation
last year.
The large amount of student
interest shown in both of these
groups pointed to the need for a
permanent organization on
campus. PIRG looked into the
food options on campus, while
the ASSU Consumer Affairs
Task Force devoted itself to deal
ing with the Post Office, Tresid
der and the Bookstore.
PIRG failed to establish itself
on campus and collect a fee as
sessment mainly because of stu
dent dissatisfaction with PIRG's
proposed salaried staff and
membership dues to the national
PI RG organization, according to
the proposal.
The newly formed bureau will
"combine and improve upon the
services of these two organiza
tions." said Mead and Gerst. It
will be completely student-run
and have three basic functions.
As well as opening up com
munication between the com
munity and students and aiding
student research, it will give sup
port and official ASSU sanction
to students interested in doing
projects on consumer issues and
open information channels
further.
The bureau will also work to

keep students informed on per
tinent consumer issues such as
which hairdriers have asbestos
insulators. An active role will be
taken by the bureau in relaying
student suggestions and com
plaints to the appropriate busi
ness or service. Mead and Gerst
said.
In the case where a student
wants to respond to some issue
with a major project, the bureau
will trv to get the student credit
through ARLO. SCIRE. Un
dergraduate Research Oppor
tuities or the appropriate de
partment.
"The ASSLJ Consumer Af
fairs Bureau can effectively
translate student interest in con
sumer affairs into a valuable
Stanford resource," said Mead
and Gerst.
The bureau will keep students
informed by maintaining an ac
tive phone line and suggestion
box. Project opportunities will
be posted on a special bulletin
board, advertised in Once
Around the Quad in the Daily,
and forwarded to appropriate
department offices. Other po
tential publicity channels include
a weekly column in the Daily and
dorm outreaches, said Gerst and
Mead.
The first meetings ol the
bureau will be held tonight. All
interested students mav attend.
