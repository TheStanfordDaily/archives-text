## 'American Film' a long fly ball 
### 
What is A History of the
American Film?
Well, imagine a young rookie
up at hat tor his tirst time ever in
the big leagues. Call him Christ
opher Durang if you want. He's
young; he's green and. maybe,
he's scared. So what does he do
but swing at the first pitch.
Smack! He hits that baby deep
to center field. In a flash, the
center tielder races hack on a
dead run toward the fence. The
crowd is on its feet, cheering
wildly. And the announcer:
. . it's going . . . go
ing ... it's . . .oh. caught on the
warning path." The fans fall back
into their seats, disgruntled and
mumbling to each other, and ev
erything returns to normal.
And that's what this play is: a
wonderful, spectacular show that
gets its audience going hut. in the
end, is just another "out."
Durang got the idea for this
play when he was only in his
early 2()s and a student at
the Yale School of Drama. And.
as with most playwrights of that
age. his imagination is untamed
and far exceeds his technique.
So. Film is not a study in
craftsmanship. But then, it isn't
meant to be. It does have its
moments. And.occasionally, it is
funny, though not often enough.
Durang lacks the wit. the skill
and the focus of other writers ol
comedy, parody and romance
such as Neil Simon or Woody Al
len. And.ol all things. Film needs
focus. The play really isn't about
anything. It merely chronicles
the last hall century or so of

American motion pictures in a
sort of amusing way.
Coming out of a movie house
one day. where he had just seen
the film. .4 Man's Castle,
starring Spencer Tracy and
Loretta Young. Durang says: "1
thought I'd write my own hobo
shanty town romance, and it
began to spin oft into a satire.
"1 suddenly realized that the
character called l oretta (the
heroine of the play) could also be
the girl in the Busby Berkeley
movies who goes on when the
star breaks her leg. Then I
realized she could be everyone."
Well, it becomes obvious from
what Durang says that he really
had no idea of what his play was
about, as well as how it would
end. And. in fact, the play is
much too long. There is a false
ending — about 10 minutes be
fore the real ending — that
should have been the real end
ing. And for those last minutes,
we are all wondering "when is it
e\er going to end?"
The main problem is that
Durang had too much material
to deal with in a two-hour-and
-40-minute play. His selection
of movies and movie stars to
parody is completely random.
The question is. "why did he pick
out the bits and pieces of film
nostalgia (especially of the 1930s
and '40s) that we see?" We sim
ply don't know.
Durang admits. "Bringing in
literary allusion or film refer
ences into a play is fun. But you
do run the risk ot alienating au
diences it you don't turn them on
to the references." Yes. it's fun

tor a while. But, without some
thing more to say in these
parodies, the gimmick loses its
effect, and the pace becomes
strange.
On the other hand. Film is a
fabulous vehicle for the actors.
And leads Libby Boone
(Loretta). Daniel Davis (Jimmy)
and Susan Pellegrino (Bette)
have a good time playing their
roles. Why not? Where else can
someone play Cagney, Bogart.
Brando and Burton (among
others) in just one production?
Director Allen Fletcher does a
wonderfully hokey job amid the
lavish set decorations, costumes
and lighting that, themselves,
parody the cheap glamour of the
silver screen. He notes, "the ac
tors possess a unique chemistry
for comedy which is derived

from working together in reper
toire."
And how true! Everybody is
good, iind everybody exudes a
kind of joy and tun spirit to the
entertainment. Isiah Whitlock
plays a hilarious old southern,
"yah mastuh" kind ol black
maid. And Thomas Oglesby
(Hank) portrays a grotesque
mixture of the shy Billy Bibbit ol
One /lew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest and the nut from Psycho.
But. unfortunately, the plea
sure found in the range of movies
covered and movie stars por
trayed does not hold us over.
There is too much of everything
and not enough of one thing.'
Durang's drama is an 'out.' but
the energy of a long fly ball is
there.
