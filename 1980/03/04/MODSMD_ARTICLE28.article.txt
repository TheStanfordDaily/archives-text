# Holly Near
## Women changing, singing 
### 
"The purpose of my concerts is to empower
people with their own self-goodness, rather than
alienate them and make them feel helpless," said
singer-composer Holly Near in a recent interview
with the Daily.
The increasingly well-known artist will perform
at S p.m. tomorrow in Dinkelspiel Auditorium in a
concert sponsored by the Women's Center and
ASSU Special Events. Included in the all-women
production are pianist Adrienne Torf (a '79 Stan
ford graduate), and a three-woman band consisting
of Robin Flower, Laurie Lewis and Nancy Vogl,
who play a mixture of bluegrass, folk-rock and
jazz.
Commenting on her desire to entertain and chal
lenge her audience. Near said, '"We are seldom
truly entertained, we're usually pacified.'' Instead,
she dynamically combines art and politics, with
powerful results. "Political music has got to be
exciting, because our lives are exciting," she said.
Diversity
In concert. Near sings and educates on a variety
of issues, including the women's and lesbian/gay
movements, the rights of disabled people, and en
vironmental issues such as the dangers of nuclear
energy.
"One of the things I hold dear 'o my music is its
diversity." she said. "In the music industry you have to
label yourself a certain type to make it easy for
them to sell you. Well, I can't do that."
Citing the influences upon her music, including
country, black and labor movement music. Broad
way shows, Aretha Franklin, Elvis Presley and
Judy Garland, Near said "They're all in there
somewhere; I let them work through me."
"1 have a huge commitment to trying to repre
sent women's lives as honestly as possible," she
continued. "1 would like to see men enjoy coming
to hear my music because it is women's music."
Changes
Imagine My Surprise, Near's latest album, pro
duced by Redwood Records, was voted Best
Album of the Year by the National Association of
Independent Record Distributors in 1979. Consist
ing of emotionally moving, affirming songs of wo
men's lives, the album was the first in which she
expressed a lesbian identity.
"When I go through changes, 1 translate and put
them into my music," she said.
When Near speaks of personal changes, she
means it. Raised on a farm near Ukiah, California,
she began performing at 7. was a film and TV
actress in the '60s and early '70s in such shows a*. All
In The Family and Room 222, and was a lead in
Hair on Broadway.
In 1971, when the Hair cast refused tosing"Let
the Sunshine In" to protest the Kent State shoot
ings, "I saw the power that these artists had on this
audience, to say when something this tragic is hap
pening. we can't go on, 'business-as-usual,' " she
said.
Near put her "life on the line" in 1973 by join
ing Jane Fonda's "Free The Army" show which
entertained protesting Gls in Japan and S.E. Asia.
Her first album. Hang In There, was an expression
of her anti-war sentiments.
She went on to record A Live Album ("when I
was asking myself a lot of questions.") and You Can
Know All I Am ("I was in transition, about to reach
a new plateau").
On nuclear energy and the environment. Near's
philosophy is based on her belief that "We don't
own this planet, it was just leased to us. We need to
return it at each of our deaths in better shape than
we found it."
In addition. Near became aware of the limita
tions of the hearing-impaired, the wheelchair
bound and other disabled people simply because
"somebody started talking to me about it." Her
concerts are signed for the deaf and are wheelchair
accessible.
Coming out
Of all the changes Near has undergone publicly,
coming out was hardest "because lesbianism and
gayness are so associated with sexuality. You have
to redefine in people's minds what it means to be

gay. I has to do with a lot of other things besides
whom 1 sleep with," she said.
By contributing her energy to so many causes,
what keeps Holly Near going? She explained.
"Someone told me that the first time they heard my
music was in a Chilean prison. The fact that that
song traveled from here to there, connecting
people along the way, gives me hope."
"1 focus on the positive things progressive
people are doing, and 1 gain support from the
women in my life," she added.
One of those women is Tort, chosen in January
to replace Near's former pianist, J.T.
Thomas. "This is exactly what I want to be doing,
performing music with women, not merely for en
tertainment, but for education," Torf commented.
Originally from Boston, where she played in a
women's dance band. Tort transferred from Smith
College to Stanford in 1977. Here she studied
political science, worked on Aurora and organized
last spring's Women's Music Night.
"I used to think Holly was a saintly person. Now
I'm getting to know her as a human being, but it
doesn't detract from the magic she docs onstage."
said Adrienne.
Back-up band
All of the members of Near's opening act and
back-up band are accomplished musicians in their
own right. Guitarist/fiddler Robin Flower has per
formed old-time-bluegrass with many groups and
recently released a solo album. More Than Friends.
Fellow fiddler Laurie Lewis placed first in the
California champion old-time fiddler contest in
1974 and 1977 in the women's division, and cur
rently performs with The Grant St. String Band.
Instrumentalist and songwriter Vogl
helped from the Berkeley Women's Music Collec
tive in 1973. which has released two albums, one
bearing the group's name, and the other entitled
Tryin To Survive. The collective was one of the
first woman-identified bands to form, devoted to
"writing and performing music which focused on
the integrity of women."

somewhere; I let them work through me."
"1 have a huge commitment to trying to repre
sent women's lives as honestly as possible," she
continued. "1 would like to see men enjoy coming
to hear my music because it is women's music."
Changes
Imagine My Surprise, Near's latest album, pro
duced by Redwood Records, was voted Best
Album of the Year by the National Association of
Independent Record Distributors in 1979. Consist
ing of emotionally moving, affirming songs of wo
men's lives, the album was the first in which she
expressed a lesbian identity.
"When I go through changes, 1 translate and put
them into my music," she said.
When Near speaks of personal changes, she
means it. Raised on a farm near Ukiah, California,
she began performing at 7. was a film and TV
actress in the '60s and early '70s in such shows a*. All
In The Family and Room 222, and was a lead in
Hair on Broadway.
In 1971, when the Hair cast refused tosing"Let
the Sunshine In" to protest the Kent State shoot
ings, "I saw the power that these artists had on this
audience, to say when something this tragic is hap
pening. we can't go on, 'business-as-usual,' " she
said.
Near put her "life on the line" in 1973 by join
ing Jane Fonda's "Free The Army" show which
entertained protesting Gls in Japan and S.E. Asia.
Her first album. Hang In There, was an expression
of her anti-war sentiments.
She went on to record A Live Album ("when I
was asking myself a lot of questions.") and You Can
Know All I Am ("I was in transition, about to reach
a new plateau").
On nuclear energy and the environment. Near's
philosophy is based on her belief that "We don't
own this planet, it was just leased to us. We need to
return it at each of our deaths in better shape than
we found it."
In addition. Near became aware of the limita
tions of the hearing-impaired, the wheelchair
bound and other disabled people simply because
"somebody started talking to me about it." Her
concerts are signed for the deaf and are wheelchair
accessible.
Coming out
Of all the changes Near has undergone publicly,
coming out was hardest "because lesbianism and
gayness are so associated with sexuality. You have
to redefine in people's minds what it means to be

gay. I has to do with a lot of other things besides
whom 1 sleep with," she said.
By contributing her energy to so many causes,
what keeps Holly Near going? She explained.
"Someone told me that the first time they heard my
music was in a Chilean prison. The fact that that
song traveled from here to there, connecting
people along the way, gives me hope."
"1 focus on the positive things progressive
people are doing, and 1 gain support from the
women in my life," she added.
One of those women is Tort, chosen in January
to replace Near's former pianist, J.T.
Thomas. "This is exactly what I want to be doing,
performing music with women, not merely for en
tertainment, but for education," Torf commented.
Originally from Boston, where she played in a
women's dance band. Tort transferred from Smith
College to Stanford in 1977. Here she studied
political science, worked on Aurora and organized
last spring's Women's Music Night.
"I used to think Holly was a saintly person. Now
I'm getting to know her as a human being, but it
doesn't detract from the magic she docs onstage."
said Adrienne.
Back-up band
All of the members of Near's opening act and
back-up band are accomplished musicians in their
own right. Guitarist/fiddler Robin Flower has per
formed old-time-bluegrass with many groups and
recently released a solo album. More Than Friends.
Fellow fiddler Laurie Lewis placed first in the
California champion old-time fiddler contest in
1974 and 1977 in the women's division, and cur
rently performs with The Grant St. String Band.
Instrumentalist and songwriter Vogl
helped from the Berkeley Women's Music Collec
tive in 1973. which has released two albums, one
bearing the group's name, and the other entitled
Tryin To Survive. The collective was one of the
first woman-identified bands to form, devoted to
"writing and performing music which focused on
the integrity of women."
