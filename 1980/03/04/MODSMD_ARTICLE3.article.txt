Residential education is gearing up for a rigorous selection
process to choose housing associates (RAs) for next year and

Women's music
Singer Holly Near says she has a "huge commitment to trying
to represent women's lives as honestly as possible." But, she
would like men to "enjoy coming to hear my music because it
is women's music." She'll be performing with Adrienne Torf
and a three-woman band tomorrow in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. See page 8.
