# The 						Clash
## A 						vanguard group going nowhere 
### 
The Clash play great great rock ' 11' roll
often enough that criticism sometimes seems
out of place. But Saturday night's show at
San Francisco's Warficld Theatre, lor all its
extraordinary moments, was too often a
self-indulgent exercise that belied the great
ness this band has always seemed to promise.
A charged, tense atmosphere prevailed
prior to the concert. Outside, political leal
lets were passed out and Clash lyrics were
chanted (sample: "Kick over the wall/'Cause
governments to fall/How can you refuse
it'£"). Inside, even Bill Graham was expec
tant — he nervously went around the War
field making sure that people didn't stand on
chairs.
Mi key Dread, the opening act. sang along
with a tape because he didn't bring a band.
The Clash's Mick Jones and Joe Strummer.
poorly disguised by bulky suits and hats,
went onstage to dance along with Dread's
reggae, which echoed badly over the ex
tremely loud speaker system.
The very great rhythm and blues artist Lee
Dorsey followed (with a band) and played
superbly, il a bit uncertainly 111 front ol an
audience almost totally unfamiliar with his
music.
Not ready
As is typical of Clash shows, the opening
acts didn't quite prepare the audience for the
ferocity ot the band's attack. Vocalist
Strummer was particularly fired-up as the
Clash took the stage; the band's intensity and
aggressiveness was clearly 110 act.
The wild unevenness of Strummer's \ ocals
was characteristic ol the show as a whole: the
19-song set varied widely 111 quality.
Fierce
As drummer Topper Ncadon and bassist
Paul Simonon banged away, the band
fiercely launched into"Clash City Rockers."
from the Clash's debut release. Strummer
carried the song with extraordinary power.
But 011 the very next song. "Brand New
Cadillac." a cover of a '50s classic from the
band's latest release. London Culling.
Strummer's singing never got going. On this
song, there was absolutely 110 element ol sur
prise in Strummer's \oice — he had nothing

new to offer. With no expressiveness.
Strummer droned through the song.
This pattern would be repeated all night,
lor every great vocal — on "London Cal
ling"' or "Julie's Been Working for the Drug
Squad." say — there would be two or three
that sucked — "Jimmy Jazz." "White Man in
Hammersmith Palais." or "Police and
Thieves."
Worst
"Jimmy Ja/z." a bluesy cut from the new
album, showed Strummer at his worst, play
ing vocal games that interest 110 one but him
self. allowing the song to drag far too long.
And when bassist Simonon launched into
"Guns ot Brixton" just a few songs later, the
show seemed headed for disaster. Simonon
has a weak voice: any chance he had was
completely destroyed by a keyboardist who
played endless, discordant chords through
out the song.
To the rescue
But the saving grace ol the Clash,
guitarist/vocalist Mick Jones, began to con
tribute more at this point, and the show fi
nally began to take off. Jones' reedy, almost
wistlul voice is a welcome change from
Strummer's bluster, and his vocal on "Train
m Vian." a snappy rocker from the new al
bum. was superb.
Jones' guitar work powered the medley ol
"Koka Kola" and"I Fought the I aw." and
the vocal sparring between Jones and
Strummer was the highlight ol "Wrong "Em
Boyo." a country & western-tinged rave-up.
And finally, with "Stay Free" Jones
showed just how good the Clash can be:
without pretense. Jones sings ol growing up.
ol being alienated, without becoming senti
mental — the song kicks sentimentality in the
face.
Troublesome
Despite moments like these, the general
attitude ol the show was bothersome. In
"White Man 111 Hammersmith Palais."
Strummer sings "so you think it's funny/
turning rebellion into money." But increas
ingly that's precisely what the Clash are do
ing. and no amount of sneering at the fact is
going to make it go away.

Since the Clash have decided to work
within the corporate system, they have at
least partially undermined their uncom
promising stance. In trying to resolve this
conflict between a punk ideal ol performing
rock solely as a statement and the corporate
goal of making money, the Clash have shown
themselves to he as elitist as any ot the hands
they claim to despise.
More and more the question becomes who
the Clash is playing and performing lor. and
more and more the answer is lor themselves.
Posing
The wall-hanging of factories in the
background ol the stage in Saturday night's
show was part of a general attempt to portray
a style, rather than depict reality. Whether
the Clash has anything to do with the work
ing class is increasingly doubtful — they cer
tainly don't mind charging SS.SO per ticket
and then laughing at the people who support
them.
There's nothing necessarily wrong with
this elitism and self-centeredness. except
that the Clash still try to deny it. The lyrics on
the band's new album are full of Lenin-style
references that not-too-subtly proclaim the
Clash as a \ anguard group, seemingly able to
destroy the pressures that cripple other
hands.
Hnt the Clash still don't miss a chance to
condemn those who give in. In "Death or
(ilory." a song from the new album they
didn't play Saturday night, they give an apt
description of the problems faced by artists
who try to triumph in the corporate system:
And every gimmick-hungry yoh
Digging gold from rock and roll
drain the mike to tell us
He'll die before lie s sold
Hut I believe in this
And it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns
Will later join the church.
Well, the Clash have joined the church, lor
better or for worse, and it's time lor them to
cit her lay that on the line or shut up. They did
neither Saturday night.

poorly disguised by bulky suits and hats,
went onstage to dance along with Dread's
reggae, which echoed badly over the ex
tremely loud speaker system.
The very great rhythm and blues artist Lee
Dorsey followed (with a band) and played
superbly, il a bit uncertainly 111 front ol an
audience almost totally unfamiliar with his
music.
Not ready
As is typical of Clash shows, the opening
acts didn't quite prepare the audience for the
ferocity ot the band's attack. Vocalist
Strummer was particularly fired-up as the
Clash took the stage; the band's intensity and
aggressiveness was clearly 110 act.
The wild unevenness of Strummer's \ ocals
was characteristic ol the show as a whole: the
19-song set varied widely 111 quality.
Fierce
As drummer Topper Ncadon and bassist
Paul Simonon banged away, the band
fiercely launched into"Clash City Rockers."
from the Clash's debut release. Strummer
carried the song with extraordinary power.
But 011 the very next song. "Brand New
Cadillac." a cover of a '50s classic from the
band's latest release. London Culling.
Strummer's singing never got going. On this
song, there was absolutely 110 element ol sur
prise in Strummer's \oice — he had nothing

new to offer. With no expressiveness.
Strummer droned through the song.
This pattern would be repeated all night,
lor every great vocal — on "London Cal
ling"' or "Julie's Been Working for the Drug
Squad." say — there would be two or three
that sucked — "Jimmy Jazz." "White Man in
Hammersmith Palais." or "Police and
Thieves."
Worst
"Jimmy Ja/z." a bluesy cut from the new
album, showed Strummer at his worst, play
ing vocal games that interest 110 one but him
self. allowing the song to drag far too long.
And when bassist Simonon launched into
"Guns ot Brixton" just a few songs later, the
show seemed headed for disaster. Simonon
has a weak voice: any chance he had was
completely destroyed by a keyboardist who
played endless, discordant chords through
out the song.
To the rescue
But the saving grace ol the Clash,
guitarist/vocalist Mick Jones, began to con
tribute more at this point, and the show fi
nally began to take off. Jones' reedy, almost
wistlul voice is a welcome change from
Strummer's bluster, and his vocal on "Train
m Vian." a snappy rocker from the new al
bum. was superb.
Jones' guitar work powered the medley ol
"Koka Kola" and"I Fought the I aw." and
the vocal sparring between Jones and
Strummer was the highlight ol "Wrong "Em
Boyo." a country & western-tinged rave-up.
And finally, with "Stay Free" Jones
showed just how good the Clash can be:
without pretense. Jones sings ol growing up.
ol being alienated, without becoming senti
mental — the song kicks sentimentality in the
face.
Troublesome
Despite moments like these, the general
attitude ol the show was bothersome. In
"White Man 111 Hammersmith Palais."
Strummer sings "so you think it's funny/
turning rebellion into money." But increas
ingly that's precisely what the Clash are do
ing. and no amount of sneering at the fact is
going to make it go away.

Since the Clash have decided to work
within the corporate system, they have at
least partially undermined their uncom
promising stance. In trying to resolve this
conflict between a punk ideal ol performing
rock solely as a statement and the corporate
goal of making money, the Clash have shown
themselves to he as elitist as any ot the hands
they claim to despise.
More and more the question becomes who
the Clash is playing and performing lor. and
more and more the answer is lor themselves.
Posing
The wall-hanging of factories in the
background ol the stage in Saturday night's
show was part of a general attempt to portray
a style, rather than depict reality. Whether
the Clash has anything to do with the work
ing class is increasingly doubtful — they cer
tainly don't mind charging SS.SO per ticket
and then laughing at the people who support
them.
There's nothing necessarily wrong with
this elitism and self-centeredness. except
that the Clash still try to deny it. The lyrics on
the band's new album are full of Lenin-style
references that not-too-subtly proclaim the
Clash as a \ anguard group, seemingly able to
destroy the pressures that cripple other
hands.
Hnt the Clash still don't miss a chance to
condemn those who give in. In "Death or
(ilory." a song from the new album they
didn't play Saturday night, they give an apt
description of the problems faced by artists
who try to triumph in the corporate system:
And every gimmick-hungry yoh
Digging gold from rock and roll
drain the mike to tell us
He'll die before lie s sold
Hut I believe in this
And it's been tested by research
He who fucks nuns
Will later join the church.
Well, the Clash have joined the church, lor
better or for worse, and it's time lor them to
cit her lay that on the line or shut up. They did
neither Saturday night.

The Clash play great great rock ' 11' roll

out of place. But Saturday night's show at
San Francisco's Warficld Theatre, lor all its
extraordinary moments, was too often a
self-indulgent exercise that belied the great

A charged, tense atmosphere prevailed
prior to the concert. Outside, political leal
