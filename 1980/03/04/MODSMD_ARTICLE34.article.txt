U.N. panel will meet with hostages
Iran's ruling Revolutionary Council decided unanim
ously that the five-man United Nations commission in
Tehran will meet with all the U.S. Embassy hostages, it was
announced yesterday.
No time for the meeting between commission members
and the approximately 50 hostages being held by militants
at the embassy was revealed by U.N. spokesman Samir
Sanbar, but he told reporters Foreign Ministry officials
were in close contact with the commission over final ar
rangements.
The embassy militants again refused publicly to endorse a
meeting between the hostages and the commission. A
spokesman said yesterday the group had no knowledge of
the council's decision and militants had not yet given per
mission for the visit.
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr was quoted as
saying the militants "have nothing to decide" on the hos
tages' fate, and "they have only to obey." The West Ger
man magazine Stern quoted him as saying Thursday thev
"cannot resist an entire people" if a decision is made to set
the prisoners tree.
The State Department denied Iranian charges that Victor
Tomseth. the U.S. Embassy's political officer in Tehran,
had links with the Iranian left-wing group Forghan. The
prosecutor general in Iran made the accusation on Sunday
and asked Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotzbadeh to
turn him over to the courts, but there has been no indication
of the minister's response.
Tomseth. 3K, and two other embassy officials have been
held at the Iranian Foreign Ministry since Nov. 4. the day
Iranian militants seized the embassy.
An Iranian tiring squad executed seven Forghan mem
bers yesterday. They were sentenced to death for five mur
ders. an attempted assassination and an armed bank rob
bery.
The assurance of the meeting with the hostages was deli
vered yesterday morning during a one-hour meeting bet
ween the commission and Ghotzbadeh.
Sanbar also said in a brief statement that Iranian au
thorities promised to turn over to the commission all docu
ments relevant to the panel's mandate bv tonight.
That statement heightened speculation the commission
was preparing to leave Iran. Sanbar said he assumed the
panel would be gone by the end of the week.

Rhodesian parlaimentary election, the election office an
nounced today.

pendence from Britain to avoid rule by the black majority
that makes up 6.5 million of the 7.2 million population.

guerrilla war, which was officially ended by a cease-fire

ment. Rhodesia temporarily became a British colony again,

Carter orders crash cuts in budget
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's aides are
drafting $20 billion worth of federal spending cuts that
would permit the president to send Congress a revised,
balanced budget, informed sources said yesterday.
The federal budget has not been balanced since 19f->y.
Carter, apparently scrapping the spending plan he sent to
Capitol Hill onlv five weeks ago. ordered the crash rev iew
of budget cuts to dramatize his concern over the rising rate
of inflation.
Aides said a cut of $2 billion or more was being consi
dered in the $6.9 billion revenue-sharing program for state
and local governmens to help eliminate the $15.8 billion
deficit that Carter projected when he sent Ins budget to
Congress on Jan. 2N. The fiscal year starts Oct. I.
Federal agencies proposed reductions totalling $10 bill
ion to the Office ot Management and Budget yesterday
after a weekend scramble bv Cabinet officers and their
budget analws to meet a 48-hour deadline imposed Friday
bv James Mclntyre. director of the budget office, sources
said.
The Office of Management and Budget staff itself will
recommend another $10 billion in cuts from Carter's few
new proposals and the so-called "entitlement programs"
such as Social Security payments, welfare benefits and food
stamps.
While Social Security benefits are not likely to be affected
by the budget-cutting drive, informed sources said the
White House might seek a new formula to lower the annual
cost-of-living adjustment that now is running at a total ot
$ 1 5 billion a year.

Candidates hope for Mass. support
BOSTON — Democrat Edward Kennedy and Republi
can George Bush, both sons of Massachusetts, are looking
to the state's primary today to pump new life into their
presidential bids. But recent polls show some erosion in the
support each can expect from voters.
While Kennedy and most of the Republican candidates
campaigned hard in Massachusetts, another GOP hopeful.
Sen.Howard Baker, shifted his attention to Vermont. That
state also holds its primary today and Baker felt he had a
better chance there of making a good showing to keep his
campaign alive.
I hat left the Massachusetts Republican lield to Bush,
former California Gov. Ronald Reagan and Rep. John
Anderson ot Illinois. Former Texas Gov. John Connally is
putting his efforts into South Carolina.
It appears Kennedy, still expected toeasily top President
Jimmy Carter, and Bush, in a virtual dead-heat with
Reagan, have the most at stake in Massachusetts.
Secretary warns against registration
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Harold Brown
told key congressmen yesterday that denial of money to
start peacetime draft registration would send the Soviet
Union an "especially negative signal" on U.S. resolve to
safeguard vital American interests.
Administration sources said Brown used this argument at
a White House session with membersof the House Approp
riations Committee in an effort to persuade them to over
turn a subcommittee vote last week to withhold funds for
that purpose.
President Jimmy Carter already has legal powers to order
pecetime registration of young men, but he needs congres
sional authorization ol money to put it into operation.

High court lets Kissinger keep files
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court decided 5 to 2
yesterday that the Freedom of Information Act does not
require public disclosure of the transcripts that Henry Kis
singer's secretaries made of his phone conversations while
he served as national security adviser and secretary of state.
Rejecting the appeals of historians, political scientists
and journalists,,tlje justices concluded that the information
law does not apply to the transcripts because Kissinger
removed them from the Department of State in 1976 before
anyone asked the department for them.
A few weeks before stepping down as secretary of state,
Kissinger moved the documents to the private estate of Vice
President Nelson Rockefeller in Pocantico Hills, N.Y. Kis
singer then donated the materials to the Library of Con
gress — an arm of the legislative branch of government that
is not subject to the Freedom of Information Act — on
condition that the library not make them public for at least
25 years.
In a ruling that could doom ettorts to obtain government
documents, the court held that a government agency has no
legal obligation under the Freedom of Information Act to
try to keep possession of valuable records. Instead, the
court said, the law merely requires an agency to make public
whatever records it happens to possess at the time a suit is
filed.
Dissenting, Justice John Paul Stevens said the court's
interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act "creates
an incentive for outgoing agency officials to remove poten
tially embarrassing document from their files in order to
frustrate future FOIA (information law requests)."
