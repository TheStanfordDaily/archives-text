# Shockley defends exclusive sperm bank

Defining its purpose as "humanita
rian," Nobel Laureate Dr. William
Shockley last week publicly confirmed
his contribution to the Repository for
Germinal Control, a sperm bank estab
lished for men of exceptional intelli
gence or achievement.
In defending his participation in the
controversial program founded by
Robert Graham, Shockely said the
sperm bank would "give more freedom
to people." He cited instances where
couples want children when the hus
band is sterile.
He claimed that criticism of the
breeding tendencies inherent in this
exclusive gene pool ignores the fact
that existing sperm banks utilize medi
cal students. "If a woman feels her hus
band is superior to a mcdical student,
this bank will offer her a freedom," he
explained.
The Los Angeles Times reported
Friday that Graham — an Escondido,
Calif, businessman — received dona
tions from at least three U.S. Nobel
Prize science winners and called the
idea: "elitist, not racist." Graham said

his intent was "to increase the number
of offspring of our most creative scien
tists and to give bright, young, healthy
women a choice from among the three
Nobelists which they would have as the
father of their child, providing their
husbands agreed also." Three women
already have been artificially insemi
nated with sperm from the bank.
Shockley, former Alexander
Poniatoff Professor of electrical en
gineering, and a Nobel Prize winner for
work in invention of the transistor, said
he is "not proposing to make super
men."
But, he added, "I am endorsing
Graham's concept of increasing the
people at the top of the population,
which is to be differentiated from
anti-dysgenics — my past and present
emphasis on reducing the tragedy for
the genetically disadvantaged at the
bottom.
"I welcome this opportunity to be
identified with this important cause,"
he said. "But I want to make it clear
also that I don't regard myself as a per
fect human being or the ideal candi
date."
