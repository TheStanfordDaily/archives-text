# Shockley defends exclusive sperm bank
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
Defining its purpose as "humanita
rian," Nobel Laureate Dr. William
Shockley last week publicly confirmed
his contribution to the Repository for
Germinal Control, a sperm bank estab
lished for men of exceptional intelli
gence or achievement.
In defending his participation in the
controversial program founded by
Robert Graham, Shockely said the
sperm bank would "give more freedom
to people." He cited instances where
couples want children when the hus
band is sterile.
He claimed that criticism of the
breeding tendencies inherent in this
exclusive gene pool ignores the fact
that existing sperm banks utilize medi
cal students. "If a woman feels her hus
band is superior to a mcdical student,
this bank will offer her a freedom," he
explained.
The Los Angeles Times reported
Friday that Graham — an Escondido,
Calif, businessman — received dona
tions from at least three U.S. Nobel
Prize science winners and called the
idea: "elitist, not racist." Graham said

his intent was "to increase the number
of offspring of our most creative scien
tists and to give bright, young, healthy
women a choice from among the three
Nobelists which they would have as the
father of their child, providing their
husbands agreed also." Three women
already have been artificially insemi
nated with sperm from the bank.
Shockley, former Alexander
Poniatoff Professor of electrical en
gineering, and a Nobel Prize winner for
work in invention of the transistor, said
he is "not proposing to make super
men."
But, he added, "I am endorsing
Graham's concept of increasing the
people at the top of the population,
which is to be differentiated from
anti-dysgenics — my past and present
emphasis on reducing the tragedy for
the genetically disadvantaged at the
bottom.
"I welcome this opportunity to be
identified with this important cause,"
he said. "But I want to make it clear
also that I don't regard myself as a per
fect human being or the ideal candi
date."


William Shockley
Shockley was initially contacted by
Graham in about the idea of
creating this type of sperm bank and by
the time Graham had implemented the
idea, "I'd made up my mind." he said.
Shockley elaborated on the position
he has advocated on genetic differ
ences according to race, a position
which has caused enormous con
troversy since the early '70s.
"To say that all men are created
equal is a misinterpretation of the lan
guage in the Declaration of Indepen
dence," he said. "There will always be
genetic differences. All men are
created with equal rights.
"The notion that some people have a
bad set of genes is repugnant." he ad
mitted. "It comes from"The Apple ot
God's Eye" obsession. No one wants to
believe that God would be so unkind to
men to set up situations that men can't
make it no matter how hard they try or

how good their intentions are. This un
derlies the enormous resentment and
amount ot hostilities there are over the
subjects I bring up." he said.
Graham says he would like 100
women a year to become pregnant
through his program before long. He
denied any intentions of developing a
"master race" similar to that con
templated by the Nazis under Hitler.
" I don't know much about Hitler and
his \ ision. I don't see a parallel. I'm not
thinking in termsof a super race — only
ot ensuring a few more intelligent
human beings who otherwise would
not have been born."
The sperm bank offers a woman
selection. Graham explained. "She
sees those forms the Nobelists fill out.
but with the names removed. The
forms include a donor's weight, height,
age. 10. various hereditary' and "out
standing" characteristics, color of eyes,
skin. hair, the number of offspring and

normal children." he explained.
He said he so tar has contacted 17
Nobel winners. Some are "diffident,
some are incapable, and some are not
responsive." he said.
Burton Richter, a professor at SLAC
and Nobel Laureate, said. "I think the
whole idea is somewhat weird; it
doesn't impress me as the world's
greatest idea. The first question is.
what characteristics you are trying to
improve by selective breeding? There
is little evidence that the way these
people are proceeding will produce a
great race of geniuses. The upbringing
is more important than who supplies
the sperm." he added.
Linus Pauling. Emeritus Prof, of
chemistry here, and a two-time Nobel
prize winner, said. "His (Graham's)
opinion of Nobel Laureates maybe is
higher than mine. Some people are just
luckier than others. If good luck is inh
erited maybe it will work," he added.

Dr. Arthur Jensen, professor of
genetics ;it UC-Berkeley, addressed
the implications of this type of artificial
insemination for the resulting children.
"I would hate to he a child from a
mother who had been inseminated by a
Nobel Prize winner. She'll expect to
have an Einstein or a Shockley on her
hands and that's not realistic. You
don't merely inherit the rare combina
tion of genes that makes those people
exceptional," he stressed.
Jensen is not theoretically opposed
to the concept, however, "as long as
there is no coercion involved. Artificial
insemination is common practice," he
added.
Response from the European com
munity of former Nobel winners was
markedly more pronounced, and nega
tive.
"It is absolutely and basically wrong.
The way the human race develops, if it
developes at all, cannot be fiddled

with,'" said Sir Marint Pyle, 1974
physics laureate.
"The world would be a terrible place
it we were all Nobel Prize winners,"
declared Sir Alan Hodgkin, a 1963
winner for medicine.
Francis Crick, a Nobel Prize scien
tist, refused to participate after being
asked to donate to the hank, according
to the London Daily Telegraph.
Addressing some of the criticism,
Shockley said that he was "engaged in a
form of genetic engineering that could
have adverse effects without realizing
it. The question is, can we find any
humane ways to deal with the prob
lem?" he asked. He suggested volun
tary sterilization as a thinking exercise
as one way.
When questioned about an exclu
sively white sperm bank, he said, "It
shouldn't be limited to whites. We
could make sperm banks for good bas
ketball players if we wanted to, too."
