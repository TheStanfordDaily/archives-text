# Socialists confuse Japanese politics
## 
### Sam Jameson The Los Angeles Times 
TOKYO — When the
Socialist Party signed a policy ag
reement in January with Japan's
must important centrist parts, it
appeared that the Socialists were
gi\ ing up their Marxist approach
to politics.
But the Socialists ha\e now
confounded their new, partners
and confused the Japanese polit
ical scene In confirming their
appros al ot the agreement — but
rejecting the policies that were
supposed to hase been the basis
lor cooperation between the two
parties.
The agreement with the
Romei (Clean (ios ernment)
Parts said that the Socialists
would put aside lor future con
sideration their attitudes toward
the I S.-Japan security treats
and the nation's
member armed forces. The
Socialists traditionally liase la
sored renouncing the treats and
doing aw;is ssith the armed
forces.
The Socialists also agreed to
exclude the Communist Parts
Ironi ans future coalition gos
ernment insolsing them. And
the pact resersed the Socialists
presious opposition to deselop

ment ol nuclear energy.
Condemned by the Com
munist Parts as a "turn toward
the right." the agreement was
hailed by most political analysts
as a mose ass as from ideology
and toward realism for the
Socialists.
Adding apparent signilicance
to the accord svas the fact that the
Komei Party in December had
svorked out a separate agree
ment for cooperation with the
nation's other centrist parts, the
Democratic Socialists.
The three parties together
control 201 seats in Parliament's
powerful lower house, which
selects the prime minister.
Although that total is 55 seats
short ot a majority, cooperation
among the three parties ap
peared to oiler a possible alter
nate e to a coalition led by the
ruling I iberal Democrats il that
consersatise parts loses its
majority sometime in the future.
The I iberal Democrats noss
liase a three-seat margin in the
lower house.
Mosseser. at a Socialist Parts
consention that ended l eb. 10.
ultra-left-sving members forced
parts Chairman Ichio Asukata to
accept a res ision of the party's
proposed "action plan" for

19S0. The res ision asserted that
nothing in traditional Socialist
policy had been changed by the
agreement ssith the Komei
Parts.
Asukata attempted to explain
the contradiction by declaring
that his agreement with the
Komei Parts had set only short
term glials tor the party. After
those are achiesed. he said, the
Socialists can return to their
long-term goals.
Despite the confusion. Junya
Yano. secretary general ot the
Komei Party, said his parts
would still try to work out details
ol cooperation ssith the
Socialists, but he said his parts
tears "that the Socialists will turn
tlietr agreement with us into a
skeleton without substance."
The real test ssill come this
summer in an election tor Parli
ament's upper house. Under the
agreement, the Socialists and the
Komei Parts are to decide on
and enter a single candidate in
districts where neither party is
beliesed to liase enough support
to beat I iberal Democrat candi
dates.
The two parties have set a goal
ol electing at least six such joint
candidates — enough to deprive
the Liberal Democrats ol their

thin majority in the upper house
it both the Socialist and the
Komei parties can retain their
present number of seats.
However, grass-roots suppor
ter ot the Komei Party — pre
dominantly members ot the
neo-Buddhist laymen's society
called the Soka Gakkai
(Value-Creating Society) — are
reported to have been alienated
by the Socialists' action at their
convention.
Collapse ot the agreement
would greatly benefit the Liberal
Democrats, for political analysts
often cite that inability of the
splintered opposition to present
a viable alternative as the major
reason tor the conservatives' un
broken rule of Japan since 1948.
