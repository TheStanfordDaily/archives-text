# Attempt to expand influence
## Soviets court Latin America 
### David Belnap The Los Angeles Times 
BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
— In Argentina and elsewhere in
America, the Soviet Union is
making a skillf ul effort to expand
its importance in the wake of
what one writer has described as
"the American policy of
strategic retrenchment and low
profile in the region."
The Soviets' progress "has
been gradual and not without
setbacks, but it has gained a cer
tain momentum," according to a
book by James Theberge, an
American political scientist and
diplomat.
In his book, Theberge said:
"Soviet influence has grown
not because of the spread of
Communist ideology, although
Marxist ideas are widespread
and influential, but as a result of
efforts made on different levels
to make friends — especially (in)
support of the Latin American
countries in their disputes with
the United States."
Theberge's study was pub
lished five years ago, but the
momentum he mentioned is
even more apparent today.
In small, democratic Costa
Rica, the Soviet Union grants
hundreds of scholarships each
year for study in Russian institu
tions. These are handed out
through local Communist Party
offices in each community with
great fanfare in the press.
'Military socialism'
In Peru, where an armed
forces government is concluding
a 12-year-old experiment in
"military socialism," the Soviets
have sold more planes, tanks and
other hardware and posted more
technicians than anywhere else
in the hemisphere outside of
Cuba. But the Russians on the
scene keep their ideological pro
files low in deference to their of
ficial hosts who, though leaning
leftward, are firmly anti-
Communist.
In Argentina, where the milit
ary government is right-wing as
well as steadfastly anti-
Communist, there is little public

evidence that the Soviets even
speak to the local Communist
Party, which claims to he the
largest in Latin America outside
of Cuba.
The Soviet Embassy here is in
the capital's poshest neighbor
hood. The diplomats who inhabit
it speak Spanish easily and
idiomatically and are familiar
with Argentina's political and
cultural history down to the
anecdotal level.
This appeals to Argentina's
uppercrust intellectuals, who are
regularly invited to receptions at
the embassy.
Best parties
"In the diplomatic corps, they
(the Soviets) speak the best
Spanish and are highly cultured,
and they give the best parties,"
said one conservative Roman
Catholic writer who confessed to
a fondness "for caviar, which
they serve unstintedly."
Soviet cultural salvos are
well-aimed at nearly every level
of society. Regular visits of per
forming artists include gymnasts
and the Moscow Circus as well as
classical musicians and dancers.
Argentina is the Soviet Un
ion's "friendship" target in
South America for practical
reasons. It has things the Soviets
need and want: food and feed
grains for the most part, but last
year it bought nearly $2 million
worth of Argentine zinc, the first
transaction of its kind with this
country.
The Soviets would like to have
access to the abundant fishing
grounds in Argentina's Atlantic
•coastal waters and landing rights
here for their state airline.
Aerotlot. They would like to sell
arms to Argentina and have been
trying to do so even harder,
though still unsuccessfully, sin.ee
the United States ended all arms
sales to Argentina to express dis
approval of Argentina's record
on human rights.
No condemnation
The Soviets have taken no
known part in the international
chorus of condemnation of
Argentina for human rights

abuse. In their contacts with
Argentina's officials, Soviet dip
lomats picture the U.S.S.R. as
flexible and realistic, as opposed
to what Argentina calls "lack of
U.S. comprehension" of the
long, dirty war against terrorism
here that spawned human rights
violations.
In the United Nations and
other international assemblies,
the Soviets support Argentina's
claim to the British-held Falk
land Islands off this country's
South Atlantic coast. And, the
Soviets back Argentina in its ter
ritorial dispute with Chile con
cerning the Beagle Channel at
South America's southern tip.
112 Rom Argentina's viewpoint,
the Soviet Union — in fact, all
Communist countries, including
Cuba and China — is important
economically, yielding this coun
try's most profitable returns on
overseas trade. A local official
recently gave the following il
lustration:
On an average, Argentina
buys $2 worth of goods from the
United States for every $1 worth
it sells to that country: the
Soviets spend $10 for Argentine
commodities for every $1 worth
of Soviet goods and services
bought by Argentina.
Embargo
The importance of the Soviet
Union to Argentina surfaced in
headlines recently when this
country declined to join the U.S.
grain embargo against the
Soviets, although Argentina
pledged not to seek "commercial
advantage" from the American
action.
Potential Communist markets
will acquire even greater impor
tance in the future because
Argentina's planners hope to
triple the country'sgrain produc
tion in the 198()s.
The Soviet Union's principal
sales items to Argentina now are
electric turbines and generators
and hydroelectric technology.
Trade negotiators from both
countries have searched for
other Soviet products that might
appeal to local importers, with
little luck so far.

BUENOS AIRES, Argentina
— In Argentina and elsewhere in
America, the Soviet Union is
making a skillf ul effort to expand
its importance in the wake of
what one writer has described as
"the American policy of
strategic retrenchment and low
profile in the region."
The Soviets' progress "has
been gradual and not without
setbacks, but it has gained a cer
tain momentum," according to a
book by James Theberge, an
American political scientist and
diplomat.
In his book, Theberge said:
"Soviet influence has grown
not because of the spread of
Communist ideology, although
Marxist ideas are widespread
and influential, but as a result of
efforts made on different levels
to make friends — especially (in)
support of the Latin American
countries in their disputes with
the United States."
Theberge's study was pub
lished five years ago, but the
momentum he mentioned is
even more apparent today.
In small, democratic Costa
Rica, the Soviet Union grants
hundreds of scholarships each
year for study in Russian institu
tions. These are handed out
through local Communist Party
offices in each community with
great fanfare in the press.
'Military socialism'
In Peru, where an armed
forces government is concluding
a 12-year-old experiment in
"military socialism," the Soviets
have sold more planes, tanks and
other hardware and posted more
technicians than anywhere else
in the hemisphere outside of
Cuba. But the Russians on the
scene keep their ideological pro
files low in deference to their of
ficial hosts who, though leaning
leftward, are firmly anti-
Communist.
In Argentina, where the milit
ary government is right-wing as
well as steadfastly anti-
Communist, there is little public

evidence that the Soviets even
speak to the local Communist
Party, which claims to he the
largest in Latin America outside
of Cuba.
The Soviet Embassy here is in
the capital's poshest neighbor
hood. The diplomats who inhabit
it speak Spanish easily and
idiomatically and are familiar
with Argentina's political and
cultural history down to the
anecdotal level.
This appeals to Argentina's
uppercrust intellectuals, who are
regularly invited to receptions at
the embassy.
Best parties
"In the diplomatic corps, they
(the Soviets) speak the best
Spanish and are highly cultured,
and they give the best parties,"
said one conservative Roman
Catholic writer who confessed to
a fondness "for caviar, which
they serve unstintedly."
Soviet cultural salvos are
well-aimed at nearly every level
of society. Regular visits of per
forming artists include gymnasts
and the Moscow Circus as well as
classical musicians and dancers.
Argentina is the Soviet Un
ion's "friendship" target in
South America for practical
reasons. It has things the Soviets
need and want: food and feed
grains for the most part, but last
year it bought nearly $2 million
worth of Argentine zinc, the first
transaction of its kind with this
country.
The Soviets would like to have
access to the abundant fishing
grounds in Argentina's Atlantic
•coastal waters and landing rights
here for their state airline.

arms to Argentina and have been
trying to do so even harder,
though still unsuccessfully, sin.ee
the United States ended all arms
sales to Argentina to express dis
approval of Argentina's record
on human rights.
No condemnation
The Soviets have taken no
known part in the international
chorus of condemnation of
Argentina for human rights

abuse. In their contacts with
Argentina's officials, Soviet dip
lomats picture the U.S.S.R. as
flexible and realistic, as opposed
to what Argentina calls "lack of
U.S. comprehension" of the
long, dirty war against terrorism
here that spawned human rights
violations.
In the United Nations and
other international assemblies,
the Soviets support Argentina's
claim to the British-held Falk
land Islands off this country's
South Atlantic coast. And, the
Soviets back Argentina in its ter
ritorial dispute with Chile con
cerning the Beagle Channel at
South America's southern tip.
112 Rom Argentina's viewpoint,
the Soviet Union — in fact, all
Communist countries, including
Cuba and China — is important
economically, yielding this coun

overseas trade. A local official
recently gave the following il
lustration:
On an average, Argentina
buys $2 worth of goods from the
United States for every $1 worth
it sells to that country: the
Soviets spend $10 for Argentine
commodities for every $1 worth
of Soviet goods and services
bought by Argentina.
Embargo
The importance of the Soviet
Union to Argentina surfaced in
headlines recently when this
country declined to join the U.S.
grain embargo against the
Soviets, although Argentina
pledged not to seek "commercial
advantage" from the American
action.
