# Anderson gets into GOP spotlight; Dems split
## 
### Walter Mears The Associated Press 
BOS TON — Ronald Reagan defeated Rep.
John Anderson in Vermont's presidential
primary early today by a margin so ra/or-thin
that it was subject to an unofficial, morning
after recount. George Hush held an equally
slender advantage in Massachusetts as Ander
son mounted a pair of surprisingly still GOP
primary challenges.
Massachusetts Democrats gave Sen. Edward
Kennedy a landslide victory over President
Jimmy Carter, but Carter swamped Kennedy
in Vermont.
Reagan led Anderson by 616 votes with 99
percent of Vermont's towns reporting. Bush
led Anderson by just over 1000 votes with 91
percent of the precincts counted in Mas
sachusetts.
The News Election Service, a vote
tabulating service organized by major news
agencies and networks, said it would recanvas
the Vermont Republican vote today because
the margin was so thin.
The Vermont vote was so close that several
news organizations — including The As
sociated Press —called Anderson the victor, or
Reagan, only to pull back when final returns
showed such a narrow margin.

Though trailing narrowly. Anderson — the
white-thatched congressman from Illinois —
was the big gainer in a two-primary day. Alter
campaigning as a lonely, liberal outsider, he
earned his credentials as a contender in con
tests to come.

Kennedy was gaining almost two-thirds of
Massachusetts' Democratic \ote. He told a
Boston victory rally that his victory proves the
voters "will not tolerate an inflation rate of 20
percent and an interest rate of 17 percent." and
want the wage-prize freeze he advocates.
Even as Carter conceded Ins first defeat to
Kennedy, spokesman Jody Powell said Mas
sachusetts "wasn't a real test" because it was
the senator's home state.
Anderson validated Ins claim that the Re
publican race has not narrowed to a two
candidate affair between Reagan and Bush.
With more than 90 percent of the Mas
sachusetts precincts counted. Anderson and
Bush were each gaining 31 percent of the vote,
and Reagan 29 percent.
In Vermont, Reagan had 3 I percent. Ander
son 30 percent and Bush 22 percent.
That left the candidates short of the 40 per
cent required to win any delegates there: they
will be chosen later at a state party com ention.
The three GOP leaders were to di\ ide about
equally most of Massachusetts' 42 Republican
delegates.
Reagan and Bush, who had struggled for the
elusive mantle of Republican frontrunner, and
left the Republican field without a clear leader.
This could make it easier for former President

Gerald Ford to enter the competition be
latedly.
Anderson's support was bouyed by a hefty
turnout of independent voters in the Republi
can primaries in both states. That won't be
a\ ailable to him later in closed primaries where

only registered Republicans can vote.
With 91 percent of Massachusetts' precincts
reporting, the Democratic contest stood:
Kennedy 521,766 or 66 percent.
Carter 229,N56 or 29 percent.
• California Gov. Jerry Brown 27,529 or 3
percent.
The rest were uncommitted.
Kennedy stood to win 77 of Massachusetts'
111 Democratic convention delegates. Carter
was leading for the other 34.
On the Republican side, the Massachusetts
numbers read:
Bush 108.103 or 31 percent.
Anderson 107.072 or 31 percent.
Reagan 100,041 or 29 percent.
Tennessee Sen. Howard Baker 17.300 or 5
percent.
112 ive other candidates had scattered support.
The returns from Vermont stood this way
with 99 percent of the 265 towns reporting in
the Democratic primary:
Carter 2K.622 or 74 percent.
Kennedy 9K96 or 26 percent.
In Vermont's Republican primary, it was:
Reagan 19,441.31 percent.
Anderson 18,N25 or 30 percent.
Bush 14,006 or 23 percent.
Baker 7936 or 13 percent.

BOS TON — Ronald Reagan defeated Rep.
John Anderson in Vermont's presidential
primary early today by a margin so ra/or-thin
that it was subject to an unofficial, morning
after recount. George Hush held an equally
slender advantage in Massachusetts as Ander
son mounted a pair of surprisingly still GOP
primary challenges.
Massachusetts Democrats gave Sen. Edward
Kennedy a landslide victory over President
Jimmy Carter, but Carter swamped Kennedy
in Vermont.
Reagan led Anderson by 616 votes with 99
percent of Vermont's towns reporting. Bush
led Anderson by just over 1000 votes with 91
percent of the precincts counted in Mas
sachusetts.
The News Election Service, a vote
tabulating service organized by major news
agencies and networks, said it would recanvas
the Vermont Republican vote today because
the margin was so thin.
The Vermont vote was so close that several
news organizations — including The As
sociated Press —called Anderson the victor, or
Reagan, only to pull back when final returns
showed such a narrow margin.

Though trailing narrowly. Anderson — the
white-thatched congressman from Illinois —
was the big gainer in a two-primary day. Alter
campaigning as a lonely, liberal outsider, he
earned his credentials as a contender in con
tests to come.

Kennedy was gaining almost two-thirds of
Massachusetts' Democratic \ote. He told a
Boston victory rally that his victory proves the
voters "will not tolerate an inflation rate of 20
percent and an interest rate of 17 percent." and
want the wage-prize freeze he advocates.
Even as Carter conceded Ins first defeat to
Kennedy, spokesman Jody Powell said Mas
sachusetts "wasn't a real test" because it was
the senator's home state.
Anderson validated Ins claim that the Re
publican race has not narrowed to a two
candidate affair between Reagan and Bush.
With more than 90 percent of the Mas
sachusetts precincts counted. Anderson and
Bush were each gaining 31 percent of the vote,
and Reagan 29 percent.
In Vermont, Reagan had 3 I percent. Ander
son 30 percent and Bush 22 percent.
That left the candidates short of the 40 per
cent required to win any delegates there: they
will be chosen later at a state party com ention.
The three GOP leaders were to di\ ide about
equally most of Massachusetts' 42 Republican
delegates.
Reagan and Bush, who had struggled for the
elusive mantle of Republican frontrunner, and
left the Republican field without a clear leader.
This could make it easier for former President

Gerald Ford to enter the competition be
latedly.
