# Liberian liberalization challenges elite
## 
### Leon Dash The Washington Post 
MONROVIA. Liberia —
Liberia, black Africa's oldest re
public. is undergoing the wrench
ing change of a political liberali
zation that promises to challenge
the power of the ruling elite of
this country for the first time in
more than a century.
Ten months ago the True
Whig Party, which has ruled
Liberia uncontested since 1878,
was jolted by violent riots against
government-proposed rice price
increases in which 40 persons
were killed.
Since then, the party, under
President William Tolbert,
has taken a close look at itself
and begun moves to broaden its

base and create a more democra
tic society.
But these tentative steps by
the party leadership are seen as
too little by a militant faction in
the party and by opposition
groups who, for the first time, are
managing to gain legal status as
political parties.
Two leftist parties are at work
organizing urban workers and
rural peasants in an effort to
transform Liberia, traditionally
one of the United States' closest
allies in black Africa, into a
socialist state.
'Settlers'
While the ferment in Liberia
parallels recent developments in
several other West African
states, the clamor for a broader
franchise in this country is com
plicated by the dominant posi
tion of the land-owning black
"settler" population, some
45,000 descendants of former
slaves who were repatriated here
from the United States in the
early 19th century and founded
the Liberian republic.
The young militants are chal
lenging the old guard's grip on
the Trug Whig Party, which
takes its name from the Ameri
can party that had its heyday in
the pre-civil war period. The two
avowedly leftist groups outside
the party are pushing for a
change in the way Liberia has

been run for generations.
At the center of the tumult is
Tolbert, 66, Liberia's president
since 197 1. For 19 years Tolbert
lived in a quiet obscurity as vice
president under the tough rule of
the country's late president Wil
liam Tubman.
Tolerance
Both critics and supporters say
that, ironically, it is Tolbert's to
lerance of dissent, which Tub
man never permitted, and his re
laxation of controls on the press
that have created a growing de
mand for still greater reform.
Two other Tolbert policies —
bringing large numbers of
Liberia's aboriginal Africans
into the government and an em
phasis on economic develop
ment — have nurtured this de
mand.
Since its independence in
1547, Liberia, a tropical country
the size of Pennsylvania, has
been controlled by the
"settlers," also called
Americo-Liberians, who make
up less than 3 percent of the pre
sent population of 1.7 million.
In recent years, however, the
settlers have absorbed some of
the area's native population and
together this ruling elite, closely
identified with the True Whig
Party, forms a distinct power
wielding class. They are recog

nizable by their Western names,
adherence to Christianity and
membership in the Masonic
I.odge. long a Liberian power
center but now on the wane.
Rice riot
The incident that jarred the
True Whigs and acted as a
catalyst for opposition groups
was the "rice riot" in Monrovia
last April that resulted in the
deaths of some 40 people with
600 others injured and property
damage estimated at $60 mill
ion.
The riot erupted when poorly
prepared police and soldiers
opened fire on demonstrators
protesting a government prop
osal to increase the price of rice,
the staple food of Liberians, 36
percent, from $22 for a 100-
pound bag to $30. The average
Liberian worker earns $80 a
month.
The proposal was dropped and
the price was reduced to $20 pei 1
hundred pounds. But the at
titudes of the militants, who sup
ported the demonstrations, and
the conservatives, who called for
a return to Tubman's no
nonsense controls have har
dened.
An opposition party, the Prog
ressive People's Party, managed
to register in December after a
long court battle.

the Trug Whig Party, which
takes its name from the Ameri
can party that had its heyday in
the pre-civil war period. The two
avowedly leftist groups outside
the party are pushing for a
change in the way Liberia has

been run for generations.
At the center of the tumult is
Tolbert, 66, Liberia's president
since 197 1. For 19 years Tolbert
lived in a quiet obscurity as vice
president under the tough rule of
the country's late president Wil
liam Tubman.
Tolerance
Both critics and supporters say
that, ironically, it is Tolbert's to
lerance of dissent, which Tub
man never permitted, and his re
laxation of controls on the press
that have created a growing de
mand for still greater reform.
Two other Tolbert policies —
bringing large numbers of
Liberia's aboriginal Africans
into the government and an em
phasis on economic develop
ment — have nurtured this de
mand.
Since its independence in
1547, Liberia, a tropical country
the size of Pennsylvania, has
been controlled by the
"settlers," also called
Americo-Liberians, who make
up less than 3 percent of the pre
sent population of 1.7 million.
In recent years, however, the
settlers have absorbed some of
the area's native population and
together this ruling elite, closely
identified with the True Whig
Party, forms a distinct power
wielding class. They are recog

nizable by their Western names,
adherence to Christianity and
membership in the Masonic
I.odge. long a Liberian power
center but now on the wane.
Rice riot
The incident that jarred the
True Whigs and acted as a
catalyst for opposition groups
was the "rice riot" in Monrovia
last April that resulted in the
deaths of some 40 people with
600 others injured and property
damage estimated at $60 mill
ion.
The riot erupted when poorly
prepared police and soldiers
opened fire on demonstrators
protesting a government prop
osal to increase the price of rice,
the staple food of Liberians, 36
percent, from $22 for a 100-
pound bag to $30. The average
Liberian worker earns $80 a
month.
The proposal was dropped and
the price was reduced to $20 pei 1
hundred pounds. But the at
titudes of the militants, who sup
ported the demonstrations, and
the conservatives, who called for
a return to Tubman's no
nonsense controls have har
dened.
An opposition party, the Prog
ressive People's Party, managed
to register in December after a
long court battle.
MONROVIA. Liberia —
Liberia, black Africa's oldest re
public. is undergoing the wrench
ing change of a political liberali
zation that promises to challenge
the power of the ruling elite of
this country for the first time in
more than a century.
Ten months ago the True
Whig Party, which has ruled
Liberia uncontested since 1878,
was jolted by violent riots against
government-proposed rice price
increases in which 40 persons
were killed.
Since then, the party, under
President William Tolbert,
has taken a close look at itself
and begun moves to broaden its

base and create a more democra
tic society.
But these tentative steps by
the party leadership are seen as
too little by a militant faction in
the party and by opposition
groups who, for the first time, are
managing to gain legal status as
political parties.
Two leftist parties are at work
organizing urban workers and
rural peasants in an effort to
transform Liberia, traditionally
one of the United States' closest
allies in black Africa, into a
socialist state.
'Settlers'
While the ferment in Liberia
parallels recent developments in
several other West African
states, the clamor for a broader
franchise in this country is com
plicated by the dominant posi
tion of the land-owning black
"settler" population, some
45,000 descendants of former
slaves who were repatriated here
from the United States in the
early 19th century and founded
the Liberian republic.
The young militants are chal
lenging the old guard's grip on
the Trug Whig Party, which
takes its name from the Ameri
can party that had its heyday in
the pre-civil war period. The two
avowedly leftist groups outside
the party are pushing for a
change in the way Liberia has

been run for generations.
