# Trudeau names new Canadian cabinet

### Stanley Meisler The Los Angeles Times 
TORONTO â€” Pierre Elliot Trudeau took
office as prime minister of Canada for the
fourth time Monday and named a Cabinet
that included a number of familiar faces from
previous administrations but a surprise as
foreign minister.
Mark MacGuigan, 49. who has never
served in any of the previous Trudeau
cabinets, was appointed to the prestigious
post of foreign minister, known here as ex
ternal affairs minister. As a Liberal Party
backbencher in past Trudeau administra
tions. MacGuigan, a former professor of law
from Windsor. Ontario, was an adviser to the
prime minsiter on constitutional issues.
MacGuigan told a television reporter that
the appointment took him by surprise.
Asked to describe some of the foreign-policy
problems that he expects to face. MacGuigan
replied," I couldn't discuss policy on my first
five minutes on the job."
His appointment appeared to be part of an
attempt to put a new face on at least part of
this latest administration of Trudeau, a 60-
year-old leader who had been counted out of
politics just a short while ago. Defeated last
May, Trudeau announced his retirement in
November, only to withdraw it a few weeks

later when Canada was plunged into a sur
prise election.
Two languages
Trudeau took the oath of office Monday, in
both English and I rench, in the presence ol
Governor General Edward Schreyer in the
ballroom of the governor general's residence
in Ottawa. Schreyer is officially regarded as
the representative in Canada of Queen
Elizabeth. The ceremonies were televised
nationally.
In all. Trudeau named 14 Liberals without
previous Cabinet experience to his new
Cabinet of 30 men and two women. Two ol
those named had never even served in the
House of Commons before. For some of the
more vital positions, however, Trudeau
turned to old lieutenants. That prompted
Allan Lawrence, a member of the ousted
Clark Cabinet, to denounce the new Trudeau
Cabinet as "the same old crowd, the same old
crew, the old clique."
To fill the key post of minister of finance.
Trudeau chose Allan J. MacEachen, the
politician credited with organizing the defeat
of the Progressive Conservative government
of then-Prime Minister Joe Clark in the
House of Commons last December.
MacEachen, a 58-year-old Nova Scotian.

h;is served in every Irudeau Cabinet since
the l iist in 196 N. holding such jobs as exter
nal af tairs minister and deputy prime minis
ter. While minister of finance, he will again
have the title of deputy prime minister.
Macl achen succeeds John Croshie, whose
austere budget with high gasoline prices pre
cipitated the tall o! the Clark government in
the House ot Commons, and probably con
tributed a good deal to Clark's defeat by the
voters on Feb. IS.
No surprise
Two of the appointments, though no sur
prise. probably bothered the government of
Alberta and some circles in Quebec.
I rudeau named Marc I alonde. an old ally
from Quebec, as minister of energy, the fed
eral official who must negotiate new oil
prices with Premier Peter Lougheed of Al
berta. I alonde, 50. a former minister of jus
tice. is known as a stubborn and aggressive
politician closely in line with Trudeau's
philosophy of strong central government.
Jean Chretien, another close associate
from Quebec with similar views about the
central government, was named minister of
justice. In that job Chretien will probably
play a key role 111 the campaign against the
Quebec government's referendum on
separatism this spring.
