# FDA regulation problem: protection vs. intervention
## 
### 
One dI the main difficulties of modern Federal
Drug Administration regulation "has to do with
the universal question â€” how much protection do
we want and how much government intervention
will we put up with to have that protection?" said
Provost Donald Kennedy, former I DA commis
sioner.
Kennedy spoke at the conference on "Nero or
Nanny: The(io\ernment's Role in Health Regula
tion."
Kennedy said the question would be easier to
answer it protection ol risk dealt only with self
inflicted diseases.
But the "demography of disease" has changed,
he said, such that diseases of older age, such as
cardiovascular and cancer illnesses, have become
more prevalent. This in turn has led to a greater
need for FDA regulation.
These are the "new social diseases," according
to Kennedy, because they depend upon tilings
people to one another as well as what they do to
themseb es.
The diseases involve risks that are "created by
some and affect others." he s;iid.
In dealing with problems arising from environ
mental health hazards, it is difficult to diicetly re
late the cause to the effect.
"We have been arrayed against some cause and
effect relationships that are almost impossible to
untangle," Kennedy said, and thus, "societies have
come to rely on a system of regulation of sources."
However, the need for regulation is not univer
sally accepted. Kennedy said, because society has a
double standard regarding the freedom of choice.
On the one hand, there is a large number of
people who are adequately informed about drugs
and their effects, and who feel that the choice of

using those drugs "is one they ought to be able to
make."
On the other hand, there are others who don't
have adequate information and who have the need
for and the right to some kind of government pro
tection through regulation, he added.
Kennedy said another question about FDA reg
ulation is balancing the overall costs and benefits of
regulation.
A common argument, he said, is that the FDA
may be costing society more by stifling the innova
tion and development of new drugs than it is be
nefiting society by protecting it from possibly un
safe drugs.
Kennedy admitted that since tougher FDA rules
have been adopted, "it costs more now in time and
money for pharmaceutical companies to market a
new drug."
