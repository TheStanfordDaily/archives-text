# Babcock speaks on women in power
## 
### 
Women in positions of power
should not mind that they got
their jobs because they are wo
men, said Law School Prof. Bar
bara Babcock. Rather, women
should seize on that opportunity
and make the most of it.
"It's not how you got the job,
but how you do it that's impor
tant," Babcock emphasized,
speaking on "Women in Power"
at the Stanford Conference in
Los Angeles.
Babcock was the first female
professor at the Law School here,
and was named assistant attor
ney general in the Department ot
Justice in 1977 by President
Jimmy Carter.
Referring to her federal ap
pointment, Babcock said it was
"not a job that 1 ever aspired to"
and it was "entirely a result ol

the women's movement and my
role in it that I got the job."
She said that after being ap
pointed. she was constantly
asked how she felt about getting
the job just because she was a
woman.
"And the stock answer I came
up with was. It's a hell of a lot
better than not getting the job
because I'm a woman.' "
Babcock also stressed that
once women have gained posi
tions ol power, they "should feel
a responsibility to other women
coming along after them" and
work to further the rights of all
women.
"I'm distressed when women
make it and then divorce them
selves from the women's move
ment," she said. Many women
who become successful feel that
because they were able to make
it. other women should put forth

the same effort ;ind go through
the same struggle to gain success.
Bahcock said.
This is linked to the notion
that women must he of outstand
ing ability and ambition to gain
success, she added. But both of
these notions are wrong, she ar
gued.
"Our goal is for the average
woman to be \ iewed in the same
light as the average man and
we're a long, long way from that
goal."
Babcock told about a speech
she gave as the new assistant at
torney general to the lawyers
working for her at the time, In
describing herself, she men
tioned that she was a feminist.
Although she didn't reali/e it
then, "nothing 1 could ha\ e done
could have created more terror
in so many people." she said, be
cause thev feared she would

enact drastic reforms in the heav
ily male-dominated field.
Reflecting later on why she
said she was a feminist. Babcock
said that she meant she would
view policy decisions from n
perspective ot "how will this af
fect women?" and would try to
make decisions that would be
nefit women overall.
"1 feel this is the appropriate
attitude to have," she added.
According to Babcock, "women
in power have got to be sensitive
to issues that affect their sisters"
and consider issues very closely
before passing they off as "two
bit or trivial."
Babcock also commented 011
the double standard which
applies to men and women suck
ing powerful jobs. Babcock said
she has seen this double standard
applied most clearly in the selec
tion of federal judges.
"Judges, especially federal
judges, are actually and symboli
cally extremely powerful fi
gures." she explained, "so it
doesn't seem right to a lot of
people that women should have
these jobs."
Another problem, according
to Babcock. is that women have
been excluded from positions
traditionally leading up to higher
appointments, so that 111 consid
ering previous experiences "on
paper women don't measure up
to men." But this "doesn't mean
they're unqualified for the job,"
she added.
When asked about the hiring
of women .it the University.
Babcock responded, "the Uni
versity setting, particularly the
Law School, is one ot the most
blatant areas of discrimination
anywhere. I don't know if any
thing can compare."
Prof. Carl Djerassi, ot the
chemistry department here. said
the situation is even worse in the
I niversity's science depart
ments.
However. Babcock pointed
out that 111 contrast to the science
departments, the Law School
cannot use the excuse that there
arc few qualified women from
which to choose because there
has been a steady stream of out
standing women graduating
from law schools for years.
Babcock said the law school is
working on the problem of hiring
more women professors and
progress is being made — "but
we're a long way from solving
it." she concluded.

chemistry department here. said
the situation is even worse in the
I niversity's science depart
ments.
However. Babcock pointed
out that 111 contrast to the science
departments, the Law School
cannot use the excuse that there
arc few qualified women from
which to choose because there
has been a steady stream of out
standing women graduating
from law schools for years.
Babcock said the law school is
working on the problem of hiring
more women professors and
progress is being made — "but
we're a long way from solving
it." she concluded.
Women in positions of power
should not mind that they got
their jobs because they are wo
men, said Law School Prof. Bar
bara Babcock. Rather, women
should seize on that opportunity
and make the most of it.
"It's not how you got the job,
but how you do it that's impor
tant," Babcock emphasized,
speaking on "Women in Power"
at the Stanford Conference in
Los Angeles.
Babcock was the first female
professor at the Law School here,
and was named assistant attor
ney general in the Department ot
Justice in 1977 by President
Jimmy Carter.
Referring to her federal ap
pointment, Babcock said it was
"not a job that 1 ever aspired to"
and it was "entirely a result ol

the women's movement and my
role in it that I got the job."
She said that after being ap
pointed. she was constantly
asked how she felt about getting
the job just because she was a
woman.
"And the stock answer I came
up with was. It's a hell of a lot
better than not getting the job
because I'm a woman.' "
Babcock also stressed that
once women have gained posi
tions ol power, they "should feel
a responsibility to other women
coming along after them" and
work to further the rights of all
women.
"I'm distressed when women
make it and then divorce them
selves from the women's move
ment," she said. Many women
who become successful feel that
because they were able to make
it. other women should put forth

the same effort ;ind go through
the same struggle to gain success.
Bahcock said.
This is linked to the notion
that women must he of outstand
ing ability and ambition to gain
success, she added. But both of
these notions are wrong, she ar
gued.
"Our goal is for the average
woman to be \ iewed in the same
light as the average man and
we're a long, long way from that
goal."
Babcock told about a speech
she gave as the new assistant at
torney general to the lawyers
working for her at the time, In
describing herself, she men
tioned that she was a feminist.
Although she didn't reali/e it
then, "nothing 1 could ha\ e done
could have created more terror
in so many people." she said, be
cause thev feared she would

enact drastic reforms in the heav
ily male-dominated field.
Reflecting later on why she
said she was a feminist. Babcock
said that she meant she would
view policy decisions from n
perspective ot "how will this af
fect women?" and would try to
make decisions that would be
nefit women overall.
"1 feel this is the appropriate
attitude to have," she added.
According to Babcock, "women
in power have got to be sensitive
to issues that affect their sisters"
and consider issues very closely
before passing they off as "two
bit or trivial."
Babcock also commented 011
the double standard which
applies to men and women suck
ing powerful jobs. Babcock said
she has seen this double standard
applied most clearly in the selec
tion of federal judges.
"Judges, especially federal
judges, are actually and symboli
cally extremely powerful fi
gures." she explained, "so it
doesn't seem right to a lot of
people that women should have
these jobs."
Another problem, according
to Babcock. is that women have
been excluded from positions
traditionally leading up to higher
appointments, so that 111 consid
ering previous experiences "on
paper women don't measure up
to men." But this "doesn't mean
they're unqualified for the job,"
she added.
When asked about the hiring
of women .it the University.
Babcock responded, "the Uni
versity setting, particularly the
Law School, is one ot the most
blatant areas of discrimination
anywhere. I don't know if any
thing can compare."
Prof. Carl Djerassi, ot the
chemistry department here. said
the situation is even worse in the
I niversity's science depart
ments.
