# 'Supermarket' of contraceptives is needed, says Prof. Carl Djerassi
## 
### 
"'l here is no such thing ;is an
ideal contraceptive tor the
world." because what's hest for
one country is different from
what's best for another, said
Chemistry Prof. Carl Djerassi.
Djerassi. who has taught here
since 1960, received the Na
tional Medal ol Science in 1973
for the synthesis of the first oral
contraceptive and is one ol the
most cited organic chemists in
the world.
Speaking at the Los Angeles
conference on "The Politics of
Contraception," Djerassi said it
is impossible to find an effective
method of birth control that is
totally sale and without side ef
fects.
"What we need is a supermar
ket of different methods so that
people can pick and choose" to
find the method they prefer, he
said. But in the research and de
velopment of contraceptives,
"we have not taken that as our
goal." he added.
Djerassi said there are nine
steps to pregnancy which are
susceptible to regulation. The
lirst two of these deal only with
men and the third applies to both
men and women. The last three
steps occur after fertilization, al
though he said even anti

abortionists would probably not
call these forms of abortion.
One such step is preventing
the fertilized egg from being im
planted in the uterus. Djerassi
said it might be possible to de
velop a "once-a-month" pill to
this effect.
Djerassi pointed out. how
ever. that it takes a very long
time for anv research develop
ment to reach the mass market
ing stage. The once-a-month pill,
for example, would take from
1 26 to 2 1 0 months to get on the
market.
The situation is "even more
brutal" with male contracep
tives. he said, taking at least 150
to 250 months for marketing.
One reason that male contracep
tives have been slower in de
veloping is that the life of a
sperm is 75 days, much longer
than the life of an egg. so more
time is needed to study the vari
ous stages and effects, he
explained.
Djerassi said that because de
velopment takes so long and is so
expensive, "the private indust
rial sector is not spending any
more money" in the area of birth
control. "At this stage, efforts in
fertility control are going on at a
lower and less effective level
than 20 years ago," he added.
Thus, he predicted that "prac

tical fertility control will not dif
fer for the rest of this century."
According to Djerassi. prob
lems in population control are no
longer technological, but rather
political probletrfs.
Djerassi used the computer
terms "hardware" and
"software" to discuss the diffe
rent factors in fertility control.
Hardware refers to the actual
methods of preventing birth, in
cluding abortion as well as con
traceptives. Software refers to
the political, economic and social
issues of birth control, such as
attitudes, values and mores.
Djerassi used China, which
holds one-fourth of the world's
population, as an example of a
country which has effectively
lowered its national fertility rate.
The crucial factors, according
to Djerassi, were lowering the in
fant mortality rate, getting more
women into the labor force, rais
ing the age at which women
marry and offering economic in
centives for couples to practice
birth control.
Chinese families with only one
child receive a "planned parent
hood glory coupon" which enti
tles them to special benefits such
as preferential health care
treatment. Also, parents with
one son receive payments of five
yuan (about 75 cents), or si.x

\u;in for one daughter. Djerassi
explained that more is paid tor
daughters to counter the notion
that everyone wants to have one
male child.
Djerassi mentioned all these
(actors as software issues. "It \ ou
have only hardware and you pay
no attention to these factors,
you're not going to get any
where." he said.
Another example of a
software issue is religion.
Djerassi said. Although the
Catholic church may he an effec
tive harrier to birth control in
some areas, such as Ireland.
Djerassi gave statistics showing
almost no difference between
the use of contraceptives by
Catholic and non-Catholic
women worldwide. Also, the
percentage ol practicing
Catholics relying on the rhythm
method of hirth control dropped
from about 31 percent in 1 965 to
about 6 percent in 1975.
