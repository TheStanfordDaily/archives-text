## Clark is for tax reform, civil liberty 
### 
This Friday. Libertarian presi
dential nominee Ed Clark will
speak in White I'la/a ;it the l ni
versity.
Clark is the first — and proba
bly the only — presidential can
didate to speak at the I arm dur
ing this election year. But there
are weightier reasons why Clark
deserves your attention and sup
port.
Clark will be the only credible
peace candidate on the
November presidential ballot.
No Republican or Democratic
candidate has taken a lirm. out
spoken and principled stand
against registration, the dratt
and all forms ol compulsory na
tional serv ice.
Clark opposes registration or
conscription under any cir
cumstances.
The Democratic and Republi
can nominees will probably be
President Jimmy Carter and
either Reagan or Bush — all men
devoted to maintaining and ex
panding the present policies ot
military intervention, nuclear
brinkmanship, and counter
productive meddling in the af
fairs of other nations.
Clark, on the other hand, sup
ports a reduction in military
spending, a withdrawal from

military bases abroad, an end to
foreign military intervention and
a return to the traditional
American policy of a defense
adequate to protect the people
and territory of the United
States.
II you are distressed by our
current foreign policy and out
raged by the resumption ol re
gistration and the draft, your
only leal choice next November
4 will be to vote lor Clark or to
stay home
Although Clark holds a degree
in international relations, his
concerns are not limited to
foreign policy. As candidate lor
governor of California in 197 N.
Clark called for repeal ol the
sales tax. a regressive tax that
tails hardest upon the working
class and the poor. He also enun
ciated an educational tax credit
proposal which would bring to
everyone the educational oppor
tunities now enjoyed only by the
privileged few.
As a Libertarian. Clark views
the welfare state as a massive
Iraud hiding the reality of
government-created pri\ ileges
granted to politically and
economically powerful busines
ses and interest groups.
Clark would sweep away this

web of privilege by ending gov
ernment intervention 111 the
economy.
Clark supports a massive re
duction in taxation — to return
to people control over their earn
ings and to stimulate the
economic growth and creation of
new jobs that are needed to end
unemployment and poverty.
On inflation, Clark has stated.
"Inflation is legalized counter
feiting. I'll stop it — not by blam
ing and scapegoating
businessmen or workers and ask
ing them to sacrifice, but by put
ting an end to the only funda
mental cause ol inflation deficit
spending and expansion of the
money supply
In the area ol civil liberties.
Clark supports untrammeled
freedom of expression, the re
peal of all laws against victimless
crimes, and strict restrictions on
government secrecy and spving.
He stands for a new political
order based on principle, com
passion. and the ultimate value
of each individual, and for a new
social order based on mutual and
voluntary cooperation.
Clark intends to offer the mill
ions of Americans — from left,
right and center — who reject
the foreign and domestic policies

ol the Democrats and Republi
cans and who feel alienated from
the two-party system a chance to
voice their discontent.
II you are one of the millions
who believe that Reagan vs. Car
ter. or Kennedy vs. Bush is not
really any choice at all, use the
coming opportunity on March 7
to investigate the alternative ot
tered by Libertarian Clark.

II you are distressed by our
current foreign policy and out
raged by the resumption ol re
gistration and the draft, your
only leal choice next November
4 will be to vote lor Clark or to
stay home
Although Clark holds a degree
in international relations, his
concerns are not limited to
foreign policy. As candidate lor
governor of California in 197 N.
Clark called for repeal ol the
sales tax. a regressive tax that
tails hardest upon the working
class and the poor. He also enun
ciated an educational tax credit
proposal which would bring to
everyone the educational oppor
tunities now enjoyed only by the
privileged few.
As a Libertarian. Clark views
the welfare state as a massive
Iraud hiding the reality of
government-created pri\ ileges
granted to politically and
economically powerful busines
ses and interest groups.
Clark would sweep away this

web of privilege by ending gov
ernment intervention 111 the
economy.
Clark supports a massive re
duction in taxation — to return
to people control over their earn
ings and to stimulate the
economic growth and creation of
new jobs that are needed to end
unemployment and poverty.
On inflation, Clark has stated.
"Inflation is legalized counter
feiting. I'll stop it — not by blam
ing and scapegoating
businessmen or workers and ask
ing them to sacrifice, but by put
ting an end to the only funda
mental cause ol inflation deficit
spending and expansion of the
money supply
In the area ol civil liberties.
Clark supports untrammeled
freedom of expression, the re
peal of all laws against victimless
crimes, and strict restrictions on
government secrecy and spving.
He stands for a new political
order based on principle, com
passion. and the ultimate value
of each individual, and for a new
social order based on mutual and
voluntary cooperation.
Clark intends to offer the mill
ions of Americans — from left,
right and center — who reject
the foreign and domestic policies

ol the Democrats and Republi
cans and who feel alienated from
the two-party system a chance to
voice their discontent.
II you are one of the millions
who believe that Reagan vs. Car
ter. or Kennedy vs. Bush is not
really any choice at all, use the
coming opportunity on March 7
to investigate the alternative ot
tered by Libertarian Clark.
