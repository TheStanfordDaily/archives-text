# One term for presidents
## 
### 
Republican presidential contender John Ander
son recently remarked that "I am willing to do the
things that would make me a one-term president."
Therein, he seemed to imply that a president acting
in the best interests of the United States would be
unable to win a vote of confidence from the people.
Inversely, he intimated that a typical president,
desirous of re-election, would not take the drama
tic steps necessary to lessen the flaws in our gov
ernment and to improve our society.
Unfortunately, in this era of time-consuming,
systematically plotted and richly budgeted cam
paigns, Anderson's hinted contention is a legiti
mate cause for concern. When a president hires an
"image maker" and gauges his ranking in public
opinion polls more scrupulously than the perfor
mance of economic indicators, perhaps our democ
ratic sense of popular rule has become unbounded.
When only a president, with no further political
ambitions to fulfill, will actively strive toward the
implementation of his convictions, perhaps a pres
ident should be legally limited to but one term.
Members of the Constitutional Convention of
1787, adhering to a balance of powers philosophy,
feared the possibility of an overly strong executive.
In fact, the issue of presidential election was "the
most difficult of all on which we had to decide,"
according to Pennsylvania delegate James Wilson.
Originally, the convention sent to its Committee
of Detail a plan for Congressional selection of the
executive for a seven-year term with no re
eligibility, in order to reduce the potential of presi
dential intrigue with Congress for a second term.
Subsequently, that measure was modified to pro
vide for the electoral college, and abbreviated,
four-year terms with re-election contingency.
Until Franklin Roosevelt's war-torn, four-term
tenure in office, presidents abided by Teddy
Roosevelt's "wise custom which limits the Presi
dent to two terms." In 1951 the passage of the
Twenty-second Amendment formally foreclosed
the opportunity to serve more than two terms to all
presidents.
Several truths are, however, undeniable. If
Richard Nixon had not been eligible for re
election, his Committee to Re-elect the President
would have had no reason to exist, much less to
employ the now-infamous Watergate "plumbers."
Hence, if Nixon had been precluded from another
four years in the Oval Office, the debacle of the
Watergate scandal would have been avoided.
Secondly, if President Jimmy Carter had been
constrained to a single term, he would not now be
engaged in political maneuvers and petty bickering
with his opponent, Ted Kennedy, but would in
stead be devoting his entire energy to the im
mediate and grave confrontations facing the coun
try. Rather than biding his time with long-distance

telephone solicitations and chats with his campaign
director. Robert Strauss, he should be formulating
a defense proposal that is more than a mere politi
cal ploy. Rather than expanding his budget for
political expediency, he should be attending to the
current price spiral, which may soon explode into
an unheard-of American hyperinflation.

Moreover, Carter's presidency is solid proof that
the Founding Fathers' election process to guaran
tee, in the words of Alexander Hamilton, "the
energy in office of a leading character in the defini
tion of good government," is sadly outmoded. The
expanded scope of the media and special interest
groups has molded the presidency into a popularity
contest between maverick politicians. The presi
dent has become a winsome sycophant, simply sp
outing forth rhetoric to impress and satisfy a fickle
public constituency.
Carter has forged a path of equivocation by
mouthing empty "campaign" promises in office.
He has amateurishly directed the country into its
present morass by following policies better suited
to furthering his political career than to achieving
broader national goals. But as long as presidents can
serve multiple terms, we can expect the parochial
influence of party politics togenerate this misdirec
tion in American leadership.
We need a president who can courageously stand
by his moral beliefs, not one who must use his
religion, his smile or any other superficial means to
attract votes. We need a president who will protect
the rights and interests of our nation, no matter
how unpopular or politically damaging such a stand
might be. We need to nip rose-garden political
strategy in the bud. We need a statute to restrict
presidents to one term.
