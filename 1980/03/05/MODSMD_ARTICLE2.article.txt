## 
### Andrea James News Editor 
A University panel yesterday re
fused to change its recommendation
that the French theme house here be
discontinued.
La Maison Francaise Resident Fel
low Kamal Zein said he was not con
tacted last night by Assoc. Dean of Re
sidential Education Norm Robinson as
to whether the dean would continue to
follow the panel's decision.
About 15 of the 36 French house
residents and several members of the
French department yesterday appealed
io the Configuration Panel, an en
larged version of the Committee Ser
vices to Students. Subcommittee on
Residences (COSS-R).
"Nothing in the proceedings con

vinced us to change our decision." said
Thomas McDonough. student chair
man of the panel.
McDonough said the panel, com
posed of faculty, administrators and
students, deliberated about 41) minutes
on the issue before reaching its deci
sion.
During the appeal residents claimed
they had not been involved in writing
the house evaluation or proposal on
which the panel made its decision to
cancel the French studies theme.
That decision was announced late
last week and approved by Robinson.
*'We were all very shocked when we
read the house evaluation," said Brad
Melmon, a sophomore living in the
house this year. He said house as
sociate (RA) Robin Kenmore pre

pared the evaluation alter reviewing
questionnaires that residents thought
were to be used only for the in-house
purpose of improving leadership prob
lems.
"We wanted to improve the little
things that can go wrong in any house."
he said. "We were being highly critical
because we were thinking of every thing
we wanted to change."
He added that many residents did
not read the evaluation that was turned
in to the committee until just yester
day.
"That's remarkable," Robinson
commented.
Kenmore said time constraints
forced him to write the evaluation him
self.
"When we (house leaders) found

tlicit tins evaluation had to he done, we
had just gotten out of the agonizing
situation with La Creperie," he
explained. La Creperie, a Sunday night
French cafe in La Maison Krancaise,
folded at the end of fall quarter due to a
lack of volunteer workers.
"It was not an appropriate time for
residents to try to critique the house."
he continued. "It would take time to
pull together all the things that had
happened. So the big thing going
against us was the time frame."
Students also complained that they
had not been involved in the writing of
next year's theme proposal. Zein said
he had worked with the I Tench de
partment instead of with the residents
in writing the proposal because "I did

not see lum the house could conic to a
consensus during a house meeting."
Students told the panel that house
meetings sometimes took more than
three hours, ev en without controversial
issues.
In Ins letter last week to the I rench
house residents, McDonough cited
poor leadership, lack ol student par
ticipation and no sense ol community
as the three reasons lor canceling the
theme.
"Given the problems ol the house
this year, the panel . . . was not per
suaded that next year would he sig
nificantly different." he stated.
Hie residents appealed the decision,
claiming that the house had potential
and that one year ol poor leadership in
the house was no reason to stop the
entire theme. Iwenty-four ol the 36
residents, plus some non-residents,
wrote personal letters to Resident
Education urging the continuation of
the theme.
