## Anderson is honest, able 
### 
Rep. John Anderson, 20-year veteran of Con
gress from Illinois, would make an incredibly good
president.
His fellow long-shot contender, Sen. Robert
Dole (R-Kansas), refers to Anderson as "the most
intelligent candidate in the race." Gerald Ford has
called Anderson "one of the most able people I
know."
In an article on the merits of Anderson, The New
York Times shamelessly re-appropriated President
Jimmy Carter's title, "Why not the best?"
The list could continue, but the point should now
be evident. The country does not yet seem to know
it, but Anderson is indeed the best.
Admirable though it may seem to the politically
unseasoned, honesty is one of Anderson's chief
liabilities. Unlike nearly every politician lucky
enough to be elected president, Anderson actually
says what he thinks, much as Harry Truman did.
They both were honest not only in terms of not
taking bribes, but also in taking positive actions —
they openly pursued what was right in the face of
political reality.
Anderson was elected to Congress in 1964 as an
extreme conservative who campaigned for Barry
Goldwater with fervor. Yet, in the midst of the
Vietnam War, he switched, turning his back on
both his beliefs and those of his constituency.
Heralded as political suicide, his decisions to favor
civil rights, the ERA and open housing and to
oppose the Vietnam War were self-motivated, and
resulted from the kind of deep, long-term reflec
tion that we expect from a president.
In 1973, shortly after endorsing another candi
date — Richard Nixon — Anderson again pulled
an about-face. He was the first Republican in Con
gress to openly criticize the president for Water
gate. Once again, he proved his ability to react to
change, and reform his views accordingly. It
prompted considerable criticism when he, the
third-ranking Republican in Congress, called for
Nixon's resignation, but he correctly felt that it was
the proper action.
A delegate, in political terms, is a politician sent
to office who votes exactly as the people
would. A trustee, on the other hand, votes his
conscience and his own mind.
Today, we have neither strict trustees nor dele
gates. Rather, our representatives vote essentially
in response to those who elect them; first in order
of importance are special interest groups. The
short-term opinions of the public rank a distant
second, and the distant needs of the country are
usually forgotten.
This may appear to be a cynical view, and it
requires proof. Briefly, one can examine two is
sues, gun control and energy.
Stricter gun-control laws have long been desired
by the public, usually about 70 to 80 percent of
those polled. However, less than 1 percent of the
population has united in an anti-gun-control lobby,
otherwise known as the National Rifle Associa
tion. By effectively contributing to opponents of
pro-gun-control congressmen, this interest group

has succeeded in either frightening or defeating
enough potential delegates to overcome the obvi
ous popular opinion.
The gun-control problem thus exemplifies the
case of a special-interest group subverting the
short-run public belief. Our present energy crisis
likewise demonstrates a second case, that of politi
cians opting for short-term prosperity, in spite of
long-term disaster.
It would have required little foresight in the
1960s to prepare for, and even avert, that crisis.
The simple and best solution would have been to
increase the price of gasoline, giving incentive to
the private sector to improve alternate energy
sources, such as solar power. Simultaneously, con
servation would have been induced, and a tew
years of mild deprivation would have resulted in a
much more promising future.
Yet, as is too often the case, our government
preferred short-term prosperity to lasting good.
Anderson, much to the chagrin of lobbyists, does
not fall into the pattern I have just described. Like
many of his fellow congressmen, he does not al
ways listen to the public. But unlike other legis
lators, neither does he obey special interests. He is
rather a straightforward delegate, acting and vot
ing his conscience — and often predicting the fu
ture with extraordinary brilliance.
Anderson's current proposals feature a 50-cent
tax on gasoline, levied on each gallon imported, to
be refunded with a Social Security tax reduction
(from 6.1 percent to 3 percent). The Washington
Star, among other newspapers, endorsed this idea
as political "suicide." which would "actually work,
and work immediately." Needless to say, Ander
son's "suicide" has not been espoused by his oppo
nents.
In addition, Anderson favors a moderate de
fense budget, environmental protection, stricter
gun control and ratification of the ERA and Salt 11.
He is a fiscal conservative, advocating a balanced
budget, despite his vote for the Kemp-Roth bill
(which called for massive tax cuts). And, to give
one final viewpoint of his many, he argues for the
formation of an oil-consuming cartel, to counter
OPEC.
Indeed, Anderson's ideas, unlike those of most
candidates for the presidency, are hard to briefly
summarize. This is another of his difficulties. While
television and most politicians lull people into be
liefs with cliches, Anderson tries to make them
think about his provocative ideas, a pasttime seem
ingly losing popularity in automated America.
Nevertheless, he may win. Before the primary,
Atlantic magazine predicted that he would be in the
race if he got 10 percent in New Hampshire, a
conservative state. He got exactly that amount. As
Gerald Ford said. "John could surprise some
people."
Perhaps we could even help him. If you think you
can, and you would like to form an Anderson
committee, contact me. The best might not win, but
hopefully it will not be because we failed to try.
