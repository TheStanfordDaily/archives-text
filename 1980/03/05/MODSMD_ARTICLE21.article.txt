## Let students run the Coffee House 
### 
A day-long series of informa
tional meetings and tours on
Feb. 21 marked the opening of
bidding for the food service op
erations contract at Tresidder
I nion and Encina Station. The
current contract, held by
Guckenheimer/TDS Inc., ex
pires May 1. 1980, and applies to
The Transition, including cater
ing. Encina Station and the Cof
fee House.
Prospective contractors may
bid for each individual unit or for
the entire package. Among the 15
bidders present were representa
tives from several of the largest
food service corporations in the
United States, and a group from
the Stanford community itself,
the ASSU Coffee House Task
Force.
Since last November the task
force, composed of under
graduates. graduates (including
members of the law and business
schools), and former Coffee
House staff has been piecing to
gether an ASSU bid for the Cof
fee House portion of the contract
— a proposal that would, if ac
cepted, put the Coffee House
back into student hands.
The result of many long hours
of student and administration in
teraction. the contract is exacting
and quite lengthy. The specifica
tions call for much greater in
volvement by the contractor in
the University community than
the present contract does, and
demand considerable financial
guarantees. The contract has
consequently necessitated in
volving a wide spectrum of the
University community.
Why do the students on the
task force feel such a strong need
to win the contract and run the
Coffee House themselves, espe
cially when it would be so much
easier to just let a corporation

jump into the driver's seat and
assume responsibilities for the
operation of the facility?
Quite simply, the future of
Tresidder Union as a central
gathering spot and focal point of
the campus depends a great deal
on the success of the union's food
service operations. On-campus
eateries have a potential to pro
vide more than just calories, and
can create a base for student ac
tion and communication. The
operator must recognize the
ever-changing community
needs, and be eager to respond
to them.
At present, Tresidder is
clearly lacking the student in
volvement so crucial to a success
ful student union.
Changes must and will be
made. TTiis food contract is one
of the essential starting points.
The infusion of student energy
and awareness would help trans
form the Coffee House, and ul
timately Tresidder Union, into a
healthy and relaxing student
center. Meyer Library does not
constitute a healthy and relaxing
community center.
Why give the ASSU the con
tract? Students have shown that
they can run a variety of busines
ses, food service operations in
cluded. The Coffee House, in
fact, was originally started and
staffed by students.
The task force group is qual
ified to write the contract and
implement the actual opera
tions; the last four months have
convinced me that the contract
should be awarded to the ASSU
on the merits of the task force
alone. The members have more
than just food service experience
— they represent the diverse
student population and under
stand its needs. Who can be more
attentive to student needs than

students themselves?
It is important to keep in mind
that the other three food service
operations up tor bidding (The
Transition, catering and Encina
Station) will undoubtedly go to
non-student groups, leaving the
Coffee House the only facility in
the contract that would give stu
dents the chance to become ac
tively involved in Tresidder food
operations.
While other contractors seek
the contract for profits or the
prestige of a University account,
only the ASSU Coffee House
Task Force pursued the contract
solely for the betterment of the
University. Any profits would be
essentially reinvested into the
Stanford community, and not
thrown into the coffers of an out
side firm.
Lacking the high overhead of
upper-level management and
corporate profit allowances, a
student-run Coffee House would
also offer lower prices, and prog
ramming and atmosphere would
directly reflect student tastes,
not merely what someone thinks

students might like.
At the moment, everyone in
volved in the project is working
intensely to get a contract writ
ten that simply demands accep
tance. given the strong financial
backing of the ASSU, the impor
tance of the contract to the fu
ture of Tresidder Union and the
University and the inherent right
of students to be involved in their
own communtiy.
The completed proposal is due
by 4 p.m. on March 12. In the
meantime, any support of the
ASSU bid by the Stanford com
munity will help to insure the
bid's acceptance.
Let yourself be heard by writ
ing to the Daily or talking to
University administrators, fa
culty or staff that you meet. If
you would like to know more
about the contract, the Coffee
House Task Force, or offer any
suggestions, please contact me at

the ASSU Coffee House Task
Force.
Since last November the task
force, composed of under
graduates. graduates (including
members of the law and business
schools), and former Coffee
House staff has been piecing to
gether an ASSU bid for the Cof
fee House portion of the contract
— a proposal that would, if ac
cepted, put the Coffee House
back into student hands.
The result of many long hours
of student and administration in
teraction. the contract is exacting
and quite lengthy. The specifica
tions call for much greater in
volvement by the contractor in
the University community than
the present contract does, and
demand considerable financial
guarantees. The contract has
consequently necessitated in
volving a wide spectrum of the
University community.
Why do the students on the
task force feel such a strong need
to win the contract and run the
Coffee House themselves, espe
cially when it would be so much
easier to just let a corporation

jump into the driver's seat and
assume responsibilities for the
operation of the facility?
Quite simply, the future of
Tresidder Union as a central
gathering spot and focal point of
the campus depends a great deal
on the success of the union's food
service operations. On-campus
eateries have a potential to pro
vide more than just calories, and
can create a base for student ac
tion and communication. The
operator must recognize the
ever-changing community
needs, and be eager to respond
to them.
At present, Tresidder is
clearly lacking the student in
volvement so crucial to a success
ful student union.
Changes must and will be
made. TTiis food contract is one
of the essential starting points.
The infusion of student energy
and awareness would help trans
form the Coffee House, and ul
timately Tresidder Union, into a
healthy and relaxing student
center. Meyer Library does not
constitute a healthy and relaxing
community center.
Why give the ASSU the con
tract? Students have shown that
they can run a variety of busines
ses, food service operations in
cluded. The Coffee House, in
fact, was originally started and
staffed by students.
The task force group is qual
ified to write the contract and
implement the actual opera
tions; the last four months have
convinced me that the contract
should be awarded to the ASSU
on the merits of the task force
alone. The members have more
than just food service experience
— they represent the diverse
student population and under
stand its needs. Who can be more
attentive to student needs than

students themselves?
It is important to keep in mind
that the other three food service
operations up tor bidding (The
Transition, catering and Encina
Station) will undoubtedly go to
non-student groups, leaving the
Coffee House the only facility in
the contract that would give stu
dents the chance to become ac
tively involved in Tresidder food
operations.
While other contractors seek
the contract for profits or the
prestige of a University account,
only the ASSU Coffee House
Task Force pursued the contract
solely for the betterment of the
University. Any profits would be
essentially reinvested into the
Stanford community, and not
thrown into the coffers of an out
side firm.
Lacking the high overhead of
upper-level management and
corporate profit allowances, a
student-run Coffee House would
also offer lower prices, and prog
ramming and atmosphere would
directly reflect student tastes,
not merely what someone thinks

students might like.
At the moment, everyone in
volved in the project is working
intensely to get a contract writ
ten that simply demands accep
tance. given the strong financial
backing of the ASSU, the impor
tance of the contract to the fu
ture of Tresidder Union and the
University and the inherent right
of students to be involved in their
own communtiy.
The completed proposal is due
by 4 p.m. on March 12. In the
meantime, any support of the
ASSU bid by the Stanford com
munity will help to insure the
bid's acceptance.
Let yourself be heard by writ
ing to the Daily or talking to
University administrators, fa
culty or staff that you meet. If
you would like to know more

House Task Force, or offer any
suggestions, please contact me at
