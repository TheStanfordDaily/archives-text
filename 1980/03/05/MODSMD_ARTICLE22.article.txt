# Friday Forum:
## Decriminalize marijuana? 
### 
The California Marijuana Initiative '80 is a proposed statut
ory amendment. It provides that adults possessing, transport
ing or cultivating marijuana for personal use would not be
punished criminally. A state commission would be established
tostudy-the potential agricultural, economic and tax benefits of
regulating the marijuana market.
Is the decriminalization of marijuana a good idea? How
would the measure affect Stanford?
