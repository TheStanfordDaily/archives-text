### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
University Director Â«.>) Planning Philip
Williams said he was "disappointed" with
reports in the aftermath ot Monday's lire ai
Storey House that new bollards hampered
firefighters' efforts to reach the blaze.
"We've gone to so much trouble making
clear to the fire department by the number ol
reflectors which are the knockdown-type
bollards. I was pretty surprised by what I
read (about difficulties with the bollards),"
said Williams.
He said that planners were in consultation
with tire and police officials throughout pre
pa ration of the system, "it was disappointing
to see that after all the planning that went
into the system, the lire department still
didn't know what to do." Williams said.
"There's no way to make (the bollards)
perfect. If you leave it open, you leave it open
to every private car. The only solution is a
well-planned bollard system," he said
Firemen countered that new bollards, of
which they were not aware, did cause a short
delay in reaching the blaze.
Fire captain .1.1). Timko. second m com
mand at the Stanford I ire Station Monday
afternoon, said the driver ol the first engine
to arrive on the scene, l ee Caudill. is one ol
the finest in the department and "knows the
campus as well as anyone.
"They wanted to come down I asuen (the
street in front ol Storey, because) they knew
where the hydrant was. but the bollards
slowed them down." lie said.
'Find by exploring'
"We have to find new bollards by explor
ing," 'I'imko said ol the continuing installa
tion. "To my knowledge (the University
doesn't) send us a schedule ol where barriers

are going up. One day a barrier is there and
we hav eto find a new way to get (to the scene
ol a tire ).' he said.
.According to Williams, the fire de
partment is constantly provided with up
dated maps listing the location of the bol
lards, I It said he was unable to comment on
the contusion, adding that the planning office
may hear something from the fire depart
ment on the pioblcm.
Timko also attempted to dispel rumors
that the liicfighters were slow or inefficient
in controlling the lire, citing the difficult na
tute of the apparently electrical fire and the
construction ol the s()-\ear-old structure.
Not like TV
" \s you're standing there watching your
home burn down. 10 seconds can seem like
an eternity, said I'imko. "You don't just
haphazardh run into a fire like thev do on
l\ "
I he fire apparently started in an electrical
socket or possibly 111 the wall, said Timko.
spreading the llames through the walls more
quickly than the firefighters anticipated.
I imko s:ikl Capt. I'.it ( adv. firefighter in
command ol Fngine 6, made the
"textbook-perfect initial decision" in attack
ing the blaze, "but sometimes textbook
perl ect isn t good enough. A decision has to
be made without all the information, such as
how I.ir the lire has advanced, Timko
explained.
"We first attacked the fire the way you're
supposed to. from the inside. We thought the
fire was confined to the one room." he said.
I delighting was further complicated by
the construction ol the circa 1900 structure.
The thick smoke made it doubly difficult to
find the way to the back ol the house, accord
ing to I imko.

"In order to get to the room where it
started, you had to turn right, then left, then
right again. We don't know the structure the
vv;|\ the residents do." he said.
limko explained that tiremen always at
tempt to work from the inside lust, in an
attempt to blow the tire "out the windows."
rather than attacking it trom the outside,
which tends to spread the fire.
I lie second truck began working trom the
outside 011 a tire escape only after the first
approach tailed to make any headway .
Even an attempt to ventilate the root In
cutting holes 111 it. a procedure in which one
firefighter was burned as flames shot up
through the opening, did not do the job.
"We ventilate the roof to let the smoke
and gases and heat out so we can get in from
the inside, but it didn't work. We pulled
hoses up to the third floor and nothing hap
pened. the fire just kept on going." said
Timko.
Root burnt away
Only at ter the smoke and heat were able to
escape through the roof, as it continued to
burn away. were firefighters able to gain bet
ter access. I his is the point where observers
011 the street thought they saw a second
flareup of the blaze.
At the same time, men on the third floor
directly below were able to work without
masks, said I imko.
"If that fire had occurred in San Francisco,
they would have had 100 men there. We had
30-some (men). That's not an excuse, it's a
fact of life we have to live with." he con
cluded.
"I'm proud of the work the guys did. I
don't think that they have anything to be
ashamed of or sorrv for."
