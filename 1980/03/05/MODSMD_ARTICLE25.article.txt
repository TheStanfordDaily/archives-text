## Storey residents dealing with destruction from fire 
### Mac Funk Richard Hotter Staff Writers 
. The 39 residents of Storey
House returned to what re
mained ot their home yesterday
after Monday's fire to dig
through the ashes for what be
longings they could salvage.
I or most of the women, pleas
ant surprises were in order: for
some, however, expectations of
being left with virtually nothing
were realized.
The lawn in front of Storey
was covered with huge tarpaulins
as the women collected their he
longings in plastic bags. Every
thing was soaked, and very little
was without some trace of fire
and smoke. Friends and relatives
of the residents helped out as the
women made trips back and
forth from their rooms to the
front lawn, sorting out the de
stroyed clothes. books,
appliances, records and sporting
equipment.
Senior Vanessa Reed, who
lived on the third floor, de
scribed the present state of her
room. "The chimney fell right
into the room. Junk was piled up
to my neck, so I had to climb over
it to get my stuff out."
Jewelry saved
She added that the overall
situation was better than ex
pected. "Everyone pretty much
was able to get out their
jewelry." she said.
"Everything was covered with
chunks of burned wood."

sophomore Susie Abosch said.
"There are some girls who don't
have rooms left ;it all — I guess
I'm lucky," said Ahoseh, who
lost her stereo, hooks and all her
shoes.
For Joyce Chang, a sopho
more. the situation gave very lit
tle reason lor relief . I ler room on
the front of the third floor was
completely gutted, and she was
left with "one bra and one ba
thing suit."
Many residents expressed re
lief that the fire damaged only
possessions, and not lives. Junior
Risa Forister said she is still
"numb, really numb," hut ad
ded. "I'm just so glad that no one
was hurt."
For others, finding personal
items amidst the ashes took away
some of the frustration. Jenny
Thompson, a sophomore who
lived in the room in which the
fire started, wore a small, slightly
charred gold cross which her
father gave her "years and years
ago.
"At least I have something."
said Thompson.
Academics bleak
The academic situation of the
Storey residents, is fairly bleak.
Most lost much, if not all. of their
coursework and notes for the
quarter, and Thompson said. "I
guess we'll have to take a lot of
incompletes." Other residents
expressed hope of finishing the
quarter on time.
Sophomore Tern Oppelt said.
"I'm banking my hope on some

soaked notes, and hoping for the
best."
Other students do not even
have that hope. Sophomore
Susie Pa/, the other resident ot
the room in which the fire began,
said that "1 can't get into study
ing. I seriously would rather just
go home."
Paz added that her house
mates have been holding up well
throughout the ordeal. "The
girls are taking it well — may he it
hasn't hit us yet. Hie entire cam
pus has been so helpful. We feel
like refugees."
Oppelt added that "the high
morale says a lot for the girls
here."
The general atmosphere was
one of relief, resignation and
even some joviality. Diane
Krgyenhagen. a sophomore,
gazed at the piles of personal
possessions at her feet and said.
"I can't believe I had that much
stuff! I'm embarrassed!"
Upon finding out that
everyone was safe. Oppelt said
her thoughts turned to other
matters. "We had 1 I tickets for
the train to Mazatlan on spring
break. We'll get them back: we
have to." she said. 1 1
l ong-term housing for the
women remains unsettled. Many
expressed the hope that they
would be able to find accommo
dations in groups. Kreyenhagen.
however, said that it might not
work out that way. "The main
thing is to just keep track ol each
other."
