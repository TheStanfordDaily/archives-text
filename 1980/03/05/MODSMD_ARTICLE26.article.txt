# Preparation courses available for graduate school exams
## 
### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
As graduate school admissions
test dates approach, students
begin to worry about how to pre
pare themselves for the exams,
what to study and where to go tor
help. The answer for many stu
dents here seems to be profes
sional test preparation centers.
But what do these courses actu
ally do?
The two most popular courses
in the Bay Area are run by the
Amity Testing Institute and the
Stanley H. Kaplan Educational
Center. Both centers have de
veloped methods for test prep
aration that they hope will help
students to score well on their
graduate school tests.
"We try to teach students to
judge, think and analyze and not
to just memorize," Stanley Kap
lan. president of the Kaplan test
ing organization, said in a recent
telephone interview.
"We don't believe in treating
students like race horses and
doping them up with knowledge,
letting them take the test, and
then when they come off the
dope, they can't repeat their per
formance," he added.
Kaplan and Amity bourses
offer two different ways to pre
pare for the tests, and students
must decide which will lit them
best.
Long and costly
Kaplan courses are by far the
longer and more expensive of the
two organizations. Preparation
consists of a combination of class
lessons, home study and audio
tape reinforcement.

Kaplan classes run from eight
to 10 weeks for four hours each
week. Each lesson includes a lec
ture reviewing specific areas on
the exam, a test based on the lec
ture and finally a discussion ol
the test.
Kaplan amplified, "Only one
teacher teaches all sections of the
test because if a student has to
know all areas, teachers should
tot). We want an integration of
the material. This way student
and teacher get to know each
other and develop empathy for
each other."
Tapes galore
The unique addition to Kaplan
courses is the "Test 'n' Tape"
method that offers each student
over 100 hours of practice tests
with detailed explanations. Stu
dents can listen to the tapes at
the center on their own time for
additional practice.
Costs lor a Kaplan course
range from $275 to $290 for the
law (LSAT) and business school
(GMAT) exams to $325 for the
medical school exams (MCAT).
with an additional $50 return
able deposit for materials. Scho
larships based on financial need
are available.
Amity Testing Institute is a
newcomer to the field, having
been in business for only six
years. It offers the student two
different approaches to test pre
paration.
"We divide all courses into
several sections." said Brian
Fenton, president of Amity Test
ing. "A different instructor
teaches each section. The sec

tions deal with the math, writing
and other parts of the tests.
Instructor specialization
"Each instructor has a
background in his specific area
and becomes very familiar with
the material on that portion of
the test," he added.
Amity currently offers prep
aration for the GMAT and
I.SAT and is planning a new
course for the MCAT. The stan
dard full-length course runs from
28 to 30 hours and ranges from
$1 15 for the GMAT to $195 for
the LSAT. Classes run on Satur
days and/or Sundays for two to
four weeks.
In addition to the full-length
program. Amity offers a three
day "Intensive Weekend Prog
ram," which gives the student
full exposure to every section ol
the test over the course ol a
single weekend.
Kxani proximity
"We encourage the student to
take the courses for the LSAT
and CiMAT fairly close to the
exam. There are no real substan
tial facts that can be learned, so
the main focus is on familiarizing
one with the test format," said
I enton.
In addition to classwork.
Amity puts out a 75-page "Math
Refresher" book with a selt
teach format for those who plan
to take the LSAT or GMAT.
l enton hopes that this will help
students with the math section of
both tests.
Students here have mixed
reactions to the courses.
"If you're the type who has
done well in the past on standar

dized tests then I wouldn't re
commend the course," said
senior Ann Muzzy, a Kaplan
LSA'f student. "On the other
hand, it you're paranoid about
tests as 1 was, it might do some
good."
Varied reasons
Reasons for taking a profes
sional course range from needing
a review of the material to hop
ing for test insight.
" I wanted to be forced to look

at the material, because I have a
tendency to procrastinate and
put things oil. They did force me
to look at it," said Robin
Sweeney, a senior who took Kap
lan's MCAT preparation.
Currently, there are no plans
tor a University-sponsored
course on graduate school test
prepa ration.
"There has been some interest
in creating a course on campus,
but nothing has ever come of it,"
said Carrie Walker, director of
the Learning Assistance Center
(LAC) here.
"I'm not saying that nothing
ever will," she added.
Study profitable
Walker, who once taught a
course for standardized test pre
paration at the University of San
Francisco, said she believes that
there are some areas, like voc
abulary and math skills, that stu
dents can study for the exams.
"We tell students that the pro
fessional courses are available.
LAC has never done anything
formally, but one could explore
the possibilities of workshops,"
said Walker.
/
However, many students are
not convinced that the programs
serve their purpose. "I don't
think I got as much out of the
course as I should have lor the
amount of money that I paid,"
said Sweeney.
"It helped me to learn about
the directions on the tests, but I
missed so many on the practice
tests, it didn't bui'd any confi
dence," added Muzzy.

As graduate school admissions
test dates approach, students
begin to worry about how to pre
pare themselves for the exams,
what to study and where to go tor
help. The answer for many stu
dents here seems to be profes
sional test preparation centers.
But what do these courses actu
ally do?
The two most popular courses
in the Bay Area are run by the
Amity Testing Institute and the
Stanley H. Kaplan Educational
Center. Both centers have de
veloped methods for test prep
aration that they hope will help
students to score well on their
graduate school tests.
"We try to teach students to
judge, think and analyze and not
to just memorize," Stanley Kap
lan. president of the Kaplan test
ing organization, said in a recent
telephone interview.
"We don't believe in treating
students like race horses and
doping them up with knowledge,
letting them take the test, and
then when they come off the
dope, they can't repeat their per
formance," he added.
Kaplan and Amity bourses
offer two different ways to pre
pare for the tests, and students
must decide which will lit them
best.
Long and costly
Kaplan courses are by far the
longer and more expensive of the
two organizations. Preparation
consists of a combination of class
lessons, home study and audio
tape reinforcement.

Kaplan classes run from eight
to 10 weeks for four hours each
week. Each lesson includes a lec
ture reviewing specific areas on
the exam, a test based on the lec
ture and finally a discussion ol
the test.
Kaplan amplified, "Only one
teacher teaches all sections of the
test because if a student has to
know all areas, teachers should
tot). We want an integration of
the material. This way student
and teacher get to know each
other and develop empathy for
each other."
Tapes galore
The unique addition to Kaplan
courses is the "Test 'n' Tape"
method that offers each student
over 100 hours of practice tests
with detailed explanations. Stu
dents can listen to the tapes at
the center on their own time for
additional practice.
Costs lor a Kaplan course
range from $275 to $290 for the
law (LSAT) and business school
(GMAT) exams to $325 for the
medical school exams (MCAT).
with an additional $50 return
able deposit for materials. Scho
larships based on financial need
are available.
Amity Testing Institute is a
newcomer to the field, having
been in business for only six
years. It offers the student two
different approaches to test pre
paration.
"We divide all courses into
several sections." said Brian
Fenton, president of Amity Test
ing. "A different instructor
teaches each section. The sec

tions deal with the math, writing
and other parts of the tests.
Instructor specialization
"Each instructor has a
background in his specific area
and becomes very familiar with
the material on that portion of
the test," he added.
Amity currently offers prep
aration for the GMAT and
I.SAT and is planning a new
course for the MCAT. The stan
dard full-length course runs from
28 to 30 hours and ranges from
$1 15 for the GMAT to $195 for
the LSAT. Classes run on Satur
days and/or Sundays for two to
four weeks.
In addition to the full-length
program. Amity offers a three
day "Intensive Weekend Prog
ram," which gives the student
full exposure to every section ol
the test over the course ol a
single weekend.
Kxani proximity
"We encourage the student to
take the courses for the LSAT
and CiMAT fairly close to the
exam. There are no real substan
tial facts that can be learned, so
the main focus is on familiarizing
one with the test format," said
I enton.
In addition to classwork.
Amity puts out a 75-page "Math
Refresher" book with a selt
teach format for those who plan
to take the LSAT or GMAT.
l enton hopes that this will help
students with the math section of
both tests.
Students here have mixed
reactions to the courses.
"If you're the type who has
done well in the past on standar

dized tests then I wouldn't re
commend the course," said
senior Ann Muzzy, a Kaplan
LSA'f student. "On the other
hand, it you're paranoid about
tests as 1 was, it might do some
good."
Varied reasons
Reasons for taking a profes
sional course range from needing
a review of the material to hop
ing for test insight.
" I wanted to be forced to look

at the material, because I have a
tendency to procrastinate and
put things oil. They did force me
to look at it," said Robin
Sweeney, a senior who took Kap
lan's MCAT preparation.
Currently, there are no plans
tor a University-sponsored
course on graduate school test
prepa ration.
"There has been some interest
in creating a course on campus,
but nothing has ever come of it,"
said Carrie Walker, director of
the Learning Assistance Center
(LAC) here.
"I'm not saying that nothing
ever will," she added.
Study profitable
Walker, who once taught a
course for standardized test pre
paration at the University of San
Francisco, said she believes that
there are some areas, like voc
abulary and math skills, that stu
dents can study for the exams.
"We tell students that the pro
fessional courses are available.
LAC has never done anything
formally, but one could explore
the possibilities of workshops,"
said Walker.
/
However, many students are
not convinced that the programs
serve their purpose. "I don't
think I got as much out of the
course as I should have lor the
amount of money that I paid,"
said Sweeney.
"It helped me to learn about
the directions on the tests, but I
missed so many on the practice
tests, it didn't bui'd any confi
dence," added Muzzy.
