# Returning visitors to Iran to speak

### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
"The U.S. government in
sulted the Iranians and provoked
the taking of hostages know
ingly." said James Cockcroft, as
sociate professor of sociology at
Rutgers University.
Cockcroft and his wife Eva,
who went to Iran during the
Shah's regime in 197K and re
turned during the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's govern
ment upon invitation by the Con
federation of Iranian Students,
will speak and show slides here
tonight from 7:30 to 9:30 in
Room 370 in the Quad.
"The United States expected
the taking of the hostages," said
Cockcroft. "(President Jimmy)
Carter and the State Department
were in communication since at
least July of 1979 about bringing
the shah to the United States and
what the consequences would be
in Iran."
According to Cockcroft, the
United States decided to receive
the shah regardless of these con
sequences.
"It (the hostage situation)
would have been resolved a
week after it happened by send
ing the shah back to Iran." he
said.
Different strokes
Cockcroft is against any U.S.
intervention in Iran. "We may
not like Islamic law, but different
strokes for different folks," he
said.
Khomeini's government
'committed excesses but far

fewer excesses than most other
revolutions in recent history," he
added.
The Ayatollah's vision of an
Islamic republic involves redis
tribution of wealth; national con
trol of the economy; a modern
industrial program emphasizing
basic heavy industry instead of
assembly of imported parts;
mechanization of agriculture; re
ligious freedom; social rights for
women; and a multiparty elec
toral system, said Cockcroft.
Early warning
In 1978 Cockcroft warned of a
pro-shah bias in the press.
"Hands off in Iran, because this
is another Vietnam," he said.
The media, as with Vietnam,
"gave little warning of or sym
pathy for the impending erup
tion."
According to Cockcroft, the
U.S. media presents Iran's re
volution "as one of right-wing
fanatical mullahs (priests) and

ayatollahs.
"We feel that the shah is a
criminal and a thief," he said.
"He is responsible for crimes
against humanity."
He said international law,
based on the U.N. declaration of
human rights and the 1949
Geneva Convention, dictates
that "criminals" should not be
given asylum.
Search call
"We are calling for a public
investigation of how this (hos
tage) mess came about. I'm ad
vocating any such investiga
tions."
Cockcroft said he "encourages
the activity of all Iranians against
the two superpowers."
Cockcroft emphasized that Is
lamic. not Marxist, students took
over the embassy.
He added that "Khomeini al
ways wanted to make it clear that
his philosophy is anti-Marxist."

He said he does not regard
Khomeini as "a voice of pre
judice and intolerance," but that
"all his political statements are
exaggerated because that's his
basic style."
Cockcroft. who is on sabbati
cal this year, and his wife, who is
research coordinator for the City
Arts Workshop in New York,
are touring about eight to 10
universities, including the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, Syracuse.
UC-Santa Barbara, UC-Santa
Cruz and UC-Irvine.
"We're doing this (tour) on
our own," said Cockcroft. The
universities, however, pay
speech fees.
The Cockcrofts first visited
Iran with Prof. Michael Zweig.
Prof, of Economics at the State
University of New York. "The
three of us have been actively
working for any group calling for
the return of the shah," said
Cockcroft.
