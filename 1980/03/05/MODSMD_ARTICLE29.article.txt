The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — The FBI
brought a top-ranking, turncoat
Soviet spy before an extraordi
nary news conference Monday to
describe how he had reported
American political trends to the
Soviet Union while posing for 11
years as a freelance photo
grapher in the New York area.
For one hour he sat on a stage
behind an opaque glass screen
through which only his profile
could be seen, answering ques
tions in a heavy eastern-
European accent and in often -
ungrammatical English. The FBI
said his voice was modulated
electronically to disguise the ac
cent.
The spy, whom FBI officials
said they apprehended and con
vinced to cooperate with U.S.
authorities "some years ago,"
was identified only by the cover
name he used here. Rudolph Al
bert Herrmann. He was iden
tified as a colonel in the Soviet
KGB intelligence apparatus.
Among the activities Her

rmann described were an unsuc
cessful effort to abort a manned
U.S. space shot, efforts to get
close to American Presidential
candidates, and the establish
ment and servicing ol "dead
drops." locations at which spies
leave money, information, in
structions or equipment for
other spies to pick up.
Homer Boynton. executive as
sistant FBI director.said that the
FBI did not believe Herrmann
ever passed classified informa
tion to the Soviet Union, but
Boynton described him as "a big
fish." Herrmann himself said
that he thought some of the in
formation he passed to the
Soviet Union was detrimental to
U.S. security, particularly iden
tification of some U.S. citizens
and resident aliens.
Herrmann is the highest
ranking illegal Soviet resident
spy publicly identified since the
arrest in 1957 of Col. Rudolf
Abel. Abel was swapped back to
the Soviet Union in 1962 in ex
change for downed U-2 pilot
Francis Gar\ Powers.
