# Dorm mailboxes' installation stalled
## 
### Jane West Staff Writer 
The issue ot mail delivery to all
University dorms still awaits a
decision.
"A planner has been assigned
to prepare a feasibility report de
tailing the cost estimates ol the
project," said Edward Scoles. di
rector of housing management.
The ASSU Consumer Task
Force prepared a plan last spring
to have mailboxes installed in all
of the dorms.
The task force investigated the
benefits of having the U.S. Postal
Service deliver mail directly to
the dorms and discovered that
the process would be cheaper
than the system now in use.
"You now have to pay $20 for
the year to have the mail not de
livered to you," said Tom Vir
den, a member of the senate last
year.
"If the boxes were to be instal
led, a five-dollar fee would be
tacked on to the cost of room and
board," said Sandy Reback, a
member of the three-person task
force.
Besides being less expensive,
inequities in the dorms' postal
service would be resolved. Stern
Hall, except for Donner House,
is now the only dorm complex
that receives mail.
The offices of Residential
Education and Housing Man
agement approved the project
last spring, hut complications
arose that delayed the installa
tion of the mailboxes.
"The project was put hack at
least a year because fire codes
had to be satisfied," said Scoles.
and money had to be diverted to
rectifying that problem first.
"Most of the exits on the
upper floors of row houses and of
Branner, Toyon and Roble halls
had to be improved." he added.
"We hope to get it done this

year, but we have to examine it
along with the other projects that
have been submitted." he added.
"It is a question of value judg
ments, We have to decide what's
needed by going over a long list
of repairs and improvements."
Virden said that the administ
ration had been very receptive to
the proposal, which is mentioned
as an auxiliary project in the final
plan for "the University facilities
plan and capital funding fore
cast" for 1979-80 and 1980-81.
When the mailboxes are instal
led, the Postal Service will de
li\er to the individual dorms and
people will be hired to sort the
mail. Said Sandv Reback, "It will
be one-hall to one-forth cheaper
this wav."
