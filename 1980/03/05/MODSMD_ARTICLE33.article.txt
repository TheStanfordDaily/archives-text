# Nuke fuel illegally buried

### Joanne Omang The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON â€” South Carolina authorities
are investigating charges that highly radioactive
spent nuclear fuel rods have heen buried illegally
and in a potentially dangerous way at the Barnwell,
S.C., low-level nuclear waste dump.
Sources said the U.S. Department of Justice has
joined in the investigation to check allegations that
state officials are involved. Susan Byers Lott. a
former accountant for the dump site operator,
Chem-Nuclear Systems Inc., told state inves
tigators last month that 26 shipments of spent fuel
from Boston Edison's Pilgrim nuclear power plant
were buried at Barnwell between mid-1977 and
January 1978.
Two other utilities also sent spent fuel to
Barnwell, while other nuclear facilities routinely
sent banned nuclear wastes and other prohibited
material, Lott alleged.
She said Boston Edison was billed for a surface
radiation level on the shipments of 17.000 to
20,000 rem per hour, a level that would be fatal to
humans.
Spokesmen for both Boston Edison and
Chem-Nuclear denied the charges, pointing out
that spent fuel radiation levels are generally much
higher. Walter Salvi of Boston Edison said the
utility had shipped used fuel channels, part of the
support and tubing inside a nuclear power plant
core, during the period in question, and that such
channels would have exhibited the 17,000-20,000
rem level. Shipments of such channels would be
within the law.
There is "absolutely no truth" to Lott's charges
that the shipments involved spent fuel rods. "All
the fuel that came into that plant is still in that
plant," he said.
Must he isolated
Spent nuclear power plant fuel is classified as
high-level waste and must be kept isolated from the
environment for hundreds if not thousands of
years. It is beginning to pile up in the temporary
"swimming pool" storage tanks at each of the na
tion's 70 operating reactors.

Several utilities, although not Boston Edison,
have said they may have to shut the reactors down
in the next decade if a solution to the storage prob
lem is not found. Controversial legislation is pend
ing in Congress that would establish a variety of
approaches to dealing with it.
Burial of such waste anywhere would violate "a
whole host of rules" and would lead to revocation
of licenses for both Chem-Nuclear and any utility
involved, plus possible criminal charges, according
to Nuclear Regulatory Commission enforcement
chief Victory Stello.
Under oath
Lott. 31, made her charges under oath in a Feb. N
meeting with South Carolina law enforcement and
health officials.
According to a transcript of the meeting ob
tained by The Washington Post, Lott said she
helped draw up a contract between Chem-Nuclear
and Boston Edison in 1977 for the disposal by
burial of 26 loads of spent fuel rods.
Each load was accompanied by a Radiological
Survey Report (RSR) form that is part ol Chem-
Nuclear's billing system, and all the RSRs listed
spent fuel rods as the cargo. Lott testified.
Forms missing
Lott said she was responsible for billing custom
ers and was given all the RSRs to file for that
purpose. However, the RSRs for the 26 shipments
from Boston Edison were missing from the files
obtained from Chem-Nuclear by the state attorney
general's office, she said.
She pointed out staple holes and upside-down
and backward forms that indicated the remaining
papers had been gone through hastily before being
turned over to the authorities.
Three of those remaining documents indicated
shipments of 17,000 to 20,000 rem per hour mate
rial sent from Boston Edison on Aug. 31, 1978, in
the "silver Bullet"' casks, but Lott said there were
probably other waste materials. Such high levels of
radiation were "nothing unusual," she testified.
