# Slippin' and slidin' at soggy Sunken Diamond
## Freshman hurls Wildcats past Cards, 3-2 
### Cathy Dickerson Staff Writer 
It took two hours (at SI 25 per
hour) ot helicopter-created
winds to dry out the soggy soil ot
Sunken Diamond, and two more
hours ot shoveling dirt, raking
and dragging the infield before
the third and final game tit the
series between Stanford and the
I niversity of Arizona could get
underway Monday afternoon.
Hut the Cardinals couldn't
have bought a win that cold and
rain>, miserable day. The
Wildcats were determined to get
something in return tor having
spent an extra day in Cardinal
country.
The something they got was
their first league v ictorv — a 3-2
squeaker that the Cards nearly
robbed them ot with a ninth
inning rally.
Fhe Wildcats' highly touted
freshman pitcher. Ed V'osberg. a
six-foot. 1 NO-pound left hander.
shut down the Cards' offense
while his teammates continued
to make good contact at the
plate.
Vosberg went the distance for
the Cats, limiting Stanford to
only four hits, striking out si\
Cardinal batters and allowing
only two walks — both in the
bottom of the ninth after it had
been raining tor a solid inning.
Meanwhile, the Arizona ot
lense did something it had been

doing throughout the series, put
runners on base; and something
it had not. brought runners
home.
In only tour ol the 27 innings
they came to bat in the series did
the Wildcats go down in order. In
e\ ery other inning Arizona got at
least one runner on base. But
Friday, Arizona left 10 men
stranded, and Saturday they lett
I 2. Monday, they only lett seven
and Stanford left five.
"We didn't play the way we're
capable of playing,"' Arizona
head Coach Jerry Kindall com
mented about the series as a
whole. "But we managed to hang
in there and salvage one of the
games We think we're a good
team.'' he continued, "even
though we're 1-2 (in league)."
Stanford, having taken two
out of three games from the 'Cats,
increased its overall win-loss
mark to 14-2 and stands on top
of the heap in the Pac-10 South
ern Dn ision at the conclusion of
the series.
Monday's game was not the
ottensive clash that Friday's and
Saturday's games had been. In
stead it was a pitchers' duel and
defensive battle. Arizona put the
tiist run on the board in the top
of the third inning, but Stanford
answered with a run on the bot
tom of the third and the score
remained knotted 1-1 until the
seventh.
In the seventh, with one out.

Cat catcher Don Hytnan battled
back from a 2-0 count to a lull
count and singled to right oft
Stanford starter Brian Nlignano.
Dwight Taylor. Arizona's out
standing sophomore right fielder
brought llyman home with a tu
ple that went into the right field
corner.
Second baseman Ron Quick
got the third consecutive hit oft
Mignano — a single to left that
scored Taylor — and kept the
one-out rally alive. At that point
Mignano was relived by senior
right hander Larry Rutin.
Ruhn had to face only one bat
ter. Center fielder John Moses
lined one right back at Ruhn for
the second out of the inning and
Ruhn's flip to first doubled off
Quick.
In the eighth inning the rain
started to fall. The infield and
mound turned to mud. the bat
ters had to use towels and rosin
bags to keep their hands and bat
handles dry and the pitchers kept
having to exchange wet baseballs
tor dry ones. But the game went
on.
The rain let up and finally
stopped in the bottom halt of the
ninth — for Stanford's last
chance to make up the two-run
deficit.
Marquess sent Phil Wilson to
bat for left-hander John Flway.
Wilson waited out a base-on
balls. With a 2-1 count, shortstop
David Meier almost tied it up

with one swing of the bat. but the
ball curled foul and landed at the
base of the red wall behind the
visitors' bullpen.
Meier hit the next pitch on the
ground to the Arizona third
baseman who threw to second to
force Wilson. A wild pitch
moved Meier to second and
catcher Hill Worden drove him
home with a solid line drive to
left. The margin was now one
run.
Lric Hardgrave then drew a
walk on five pitches and Mike
Dotterel came in to run for him.

but Dotterer was out at second
when Mike Toothman hit into a
fielder's choice. Stanford now
had two outs, runners on first
and third, and every player on
the team had hopes of sending
the game into extra innings.
Hut Vosberg got the next Car
dinal batter to pop up to the in
tield and the game was over.

a series ol three night games this
weekend at ASU
in its fust of two consecutive
road trips.


Freshman Eric Hardgruve watches the flight of one of his hits
against Arizona. The first baseman designated hitter had two
home runs in last weekend's action. He. like hi> teammates,
however, had trouble Monda\ and went hitless.
It took two hours (at SI 25 per
hour) ot helicopter-created
winds to dry out the soggy soil ot
Sunken Diamond, and two more
hours ot shoveling dirt, raking
and dragging the infield before
the third and final game tit the
series between Stanford and the
I niversity of Arizona could get
underway Monday afternoon.
Hut the Cardinals couldn't
have bought a win that cold and
rain>, miserable day. The
Wildcats were determined to get
something in return tor having
spent an extra day in Cardinal
country.
The something they got was
their first league v ictorv — a 3-2
squeaker that the Cards nearly
robbed them ot with a ninth
inning rally.
Fhe Wildcats' highly touted
freshman pitcher. Ed V'osberg. a
six-foot. 1 NO-pound left hander.
shut down the Cards' offense
while his teammates continued
to make good contact at the
plate.
Vosberg went the distance for
the Cats, limiting Stanford to
only four hits, striking out si\
Cardinal batters and allowing
only two walks — both in the
bottom of the ninth after it had
been raining tor a solid inning.
Meanwhile, the Arizona ot
lense did something it had been

doing throughout the series, put
runners on base; and something
it had not. brought runners
home.
In only tour ol the 27 innings
they came to bat in the series did
the Wildcats go down in order. In
e\ ery other inning Arizona got at
least one runner on base. But
Friday, Arizona left 10 men
stranded, and Saturday they lett
I 2. Monday, they only lett seven
and Stanford left five.
"We didn't play the way we're
capable of playing,"' Arizona
head Coach Jerry Kindall com
mented about the series as a
whole. "But we managed to hang
in there and salvage one of the
games We think we're a good
team.'' he continued, "even
though we're 1-2 (in league)."
Stanford, having taken two
out of three games from the 'Cats,
increased its overall win-loss
mark to 14-2 and stands on top
of the heap in the Pac-10 South
ern Dn ision at the conclusion of
the series.
Monday's game was not the
ottensive clash that Friday's and
Saturday's games had been. In
stead it was a pitchers' duel and
defensive battle. Arizona put the
tiist run on the board in the top
of the third inning, but Stanford
answered with a run on the bot
tom of the third and the score
remained knotted 1-1 until the
seventh.
In the seventh, with one out.

Cat catcher Don Hytnan battled
back from a 2-0 count to a lull
count and singled to right oft
Stanford starter Brian Nlignano.
Dwight Taylor. Arizona's out
standing sophomore right fielder
brought llyman home with a tu
ple that went into the right field
corner.
Second baseman Ron Quick
got the third consecutive hit oft
Mignano — a single to left that
scored Taylor — and kept the
one-out rally alive. At that point
Mignano was relived by senior
right hander Larry Rutin.
Ruhn had to face only one bat
ter. Center fielder John Moses
lined one right back at Ruhn for
the second out of the inning and
Ruhn's flip to first doubled off
Quick.
In the eighth inning the rain
started to fall. The infield and
mound turned to mud. the bat
ters had to use towels and rosin
bags to keep their hands and bat
handles dry and the pitchers kept
having to exchange wet baseballs
tor dry ones. But the game went
on.
The rain let up and finally
stopped in the bottom halt of the
ninth — for Stanford's last
chance to make up the two-run
deficit.
Marquess sent Phil Wilson to
bat for left-hander John Flway.
Wilson waited out a base-on
balls. With a 2-1 count, shortstop
David Meier almost tied it up

with one swing of the bat. but the
ball curled foul and landed at the
base of the red wall behind the
visitors' bullpen.
Meier hit the next pitch on the
ground to the Arizona third
baseman who threw to second to
force Wilson. A wild pitch
moved Meier to second and
catcher Hill Worden drove him
home with a solid line drive to
left. The margin was now one
run.
Lric Hardgrave then drew a
walk on five pitches and Mike
Dotterel came in to run for him.

but Dotterer was out at second
when Mike Toothman hit into a
fielder's choice. Stanford now
had two outs, runners on first
and third, and every player on
the team had hopes of sending
the game into extra innings.
Hut Vosberg got the next Car
dinal batter to pop up to the in
tield and the game was over.
