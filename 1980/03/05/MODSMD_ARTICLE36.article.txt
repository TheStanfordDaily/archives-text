## Women gymnasts breeze

'i never thought when I made
up this schedule and included
USC and UCLA that we'd be
9-0." grinned coach Jackie
Walker. With a mixed sense of
accomplishment and amaze
ment. Walker noted her team's
completion of a perfect regular
season of gymnastics competi
tion.
Compared to the season
opening upset victory over the
Trojans, rated fifth in the coun
try at the time. Saturday after
noon's meet against Fresno State
was anticlimactic.
As was the case in the San Jose
State meet last Thursday night,
injuries stole some of the spot
light away from the Cards' ac
complishment.
"The only thing that could
make it (the perfect season) bet
ter would be if everyone were
healthy." Walker said. "It was a
bad meet with Trina's (Wiggins)
injuryand Karen (Hall) recover-

ing from iniuries, but it was a
good meet for the kids who got to
compete, like Cindy Stevenson
being able to go all-around."
W iggins, suffering a knee in
jury halfway through the San
Jose meet, staved out of compet
ition altogether and Hall was
onlv entered in the uneven paral
lel barse\ent which she won with
a 9.15 score.
In the team competition. Stan
ford breezed to a 133.30 to
119.10 \ ictory over the Bulldogs
to finish the year undefeated in
NorCal competition at 3-0.
Anne Smith paced a three-
Card sweep in the all-around
competition with a 35.05 total,
her second highest of the season.
Included in her afternoon talk
were third place on bars (8.60)
and three first-place showings on
beam (9.05). floor exercise
(8.50) and vaulting (8.40).
Smith's judging on beam bet
tered her previous top score of
8.60 points.
Second place in all-around

went to Julie Bledsoe with 33.75
points. Among her perfor
mances were a third in vaulting
(8.45) a tie for second on beam
(8.45),and second on floor, also
an 8.45 score.
Jennifer Roberts earned third
place in all-around with a 33.05
sum. including fourths in vault
ing (8.30), bars (8.50) and beam
(7.95) and a third on floor
(8.30).
Top performer for Fresno
State was Diane Ashlock who
placed fourth in all-around com
petition (32.85). tied Bledsoe on
beam for second (8.45) and
finished second in vaulting with
8.55.
The near future for Walker's
team doesn't include any meets
until the Vlar. 14 NorCal confer
ence meet at San Jose State. The
next two weeks promise a lot of
workouts however, as the squad
gears up for the NorCals and the
WAIAW Championships. Mar.
21-22 at San Diego State.
