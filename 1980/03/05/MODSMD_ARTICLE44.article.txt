Shooting the lowest one-day
total in Stanford history, the
men's goll team climbed from
eleventh to fifth place in last
week's Riverside Intercollegiate
Cjolt Tournament in Southern
California. Meanwhile, the wo
men's team was defeated by San
Jose State in a NorCal match last
Monday at The Villages in San
Jose 328-610.
Starting the three-day tourney
with a team total of 373. putting
them mid-way back in a 22-team
field, the men looked to be com
pletely out of the race for the

title. Paced by final round, three
under par 68's by Neil Robinson,
Kenny liakst. and Dav id C iames.
the men finished respectably
near the top of the field
"For you to jump from
eleventh to filth place in college
play, you've got to be playing in
credibly." commented head
coach David Yates.
"Our final round showed that
we can rally." added Doug
Clarke, who fired a consistent
76. 75. 74.
One of the brightest spots ol
the tournament was the return of
David (iames to the caliber ol
play which he lias *hown in the

past, but has lacked so far this
year.
Neil Robinson, who finished
fourth in the tournament, has
come alive lately with a couple of
fine performances.
Perhaps the most consistent
player lor Stanford, however,
has been sophomore Jack Skil
ling. who finished at 217. "It
seems that Jack is somewhere
near the top every week," said
Yates. "He finished eighth in
1 lawaii last week and played well
in Riverside.
For the women it's the same
story: wait. Also beaten by SJS
last Friday. they don't play until

next quarter.
"The women have prosed that
they can play wih anyone on a
gi\en day." stated Yates. "But
they're a player or two away
from playing with them day in
and day out. Hve girls are play
ing well right now. hut we need 7
or X to match the depth of San
Jose.
