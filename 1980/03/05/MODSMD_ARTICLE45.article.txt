# Steve Buechele: the freshman star who could've gone pro
## 
### Peter Finch Staff Writer 
For most students, deciding
on a college involves little
more than choosing between
a couple ol schools. I or
freshman Steve Buechele. the
decision to come to Stanford
was far more difficult.
The starting third baseman
on Stanford's varsity baseball
team. Buechele made what
was probably the biggest de
cision ot his life when he
elected to enroll here this fall.
Out of Servite High School
in Fullerton, California.
Buechele knew he wanted
either to attend Stanford or
nearby l ullerton State, both
strong baseball schools. But
then came the White So\.
First-round draft pick
Buechele was the ninth
player selected in last June's
Major League Baseball draft
as the choice of the Chicago
White Sox. Understandably,
he was faced with a difficult

choice. All three teams
wanted him desperately, and
they all had their distinct ad
vantages.
I ullerton State was close to
home, and Buechele's lormer
high school coach had just
been appointed assistant
coach there.
Stanford had a strong
academic reputation as well
as a solid baseball program.
And the White Sox had the
bucks. I\iiough. in fact, to
iieailv persuade Buechele to
join their ranks.
'I in going to school'
"The money they offered
was enough to get me to
sign." Buechele said. "But
the way they handled the
negotiations kind ol turned
me off. I hev made three oi
lers right m a row. and none
ol them suited what I wanted.
I he 11 they said. "Ok. that's it.
I hat's all we can offer you.'
And I said. '()k. il that's it.
then I can't take that. I'll no to

school.' then they waited
about a month to a month and
a halt and came back with
another one and I just said
'no. I'm going to school.
I ike many players, it was a
long-time ambition ol
Buechele's to play profes
sional baseball. But until his
senior year in high school, it
was only a remote possibility.
"In high school. I was al
ways tin liking about college."
he said. "I always wanted to
play professional baseball,
that was my goal, but it never
struck me that I'd have the
chance out ol high school
until my senior year when sc
outs would be at the game
. . . saying there's a possibil
ity I'd be drafted.''
First since 1^65
Stanford coach Mark Mar
quess considers himself very
fortunate to have landed a
player of Buechele's caliber.
Not since 1965. when pitcher
Sandy Vance enrolled at

Stanford, have the Cardinals
had a first-round draft pick on
the team.
"It was a tough decision for
Steve to come to Stanford,"

Marquess said. "We just had
to show him what we could
offer him. and fortunately we
won out.
Buechele seems happy with
his decision, too.
"I like it a lot." he said.
"I'm elad I decided to come

here. I guess the biggest thing
is the academies it's hard,
it's harder than hell. Hut it's
no big deal."
Still, now that lie's here,
one wonders how long he'll
stay. A person can only turn
down so much money.
'"It's hard to say (how long
I'll sta\)." he said. '*1 imagine
alter my junior year, il I
would get dratted. I would
lut\e better bargaining power
then. That's kind of tar away.
It's hard to say right now."
Better than expected
At present. Buechele is
playing extremely well.
Perhaps e\en better than
coach Marquess expected.
"He can do everything.
He's a great fielder, and he
can hit.'" Marquessexplained.
"He's a tremendous com
petitor. He does best in tight
spots. That's a quality you'll
find in your better atheletes
he plays his best when the
pressure's really on."

Through the season's first
12 games Buechele batted a
healthy .317. and he is pre
sently tied for the club lead
with 13 RBI. At the plate he
wears a football facemask at
tached to his batting helmet.
This is because of an injury he
suffered earlier this year
when struck by a pitch. The
ball cracked Buechele s
cheekbone, but the accident
doesn't appear to have hin
dered his ability to play at all.
The Cardinals' number one
preseason ranking came as a
pleasant surprise to
Buechele. and while he claims
he didn't expect it.he feels
the team is worthy of the dis
tinction.
" The team's great." he
said. "It's probably the most
fun team I've ever played on
it's the best team I've ever
played on."
Quality baseball
Buechele is happy with the
instruction lie's getting here.

too. The coaching in
baseball's minor leagues, he
claimed, is often ol below
average quality.
Pacil ic-1 <â€¢ Confere nee
coaches and players are
among the best in collegiate
baseball. That's why it could
be difficult for a young player,
fresh out of high school, to
step into a starting role. But
Buechelc. and several othei
Stanford treshmen. ha\e
handled the transition with
apparent ease.
Quick adjustment
Marquess, however, is im
pressed with Buechelc's abil
ity to immediately compete in
the Pac-in.
"He's done exceptionally
well, he said. "Especially for
a freshman."
If w hat has been seen so far
is ai". indication of ihings to
come. Buechelc is in for an
outstanding career, lie's
happy to be here, his coaches
are happy lie's here.
