UN vote on Israel questioned
W ASH INC 11 ON — President Jimmy Carter
was quoted yesterday as telling Jewish leaders
that the I nited States should not have voted loi a
controversial I .N. resolution it it included am
reference to dismantling Israeli settlements in oc
cupied Arab territory.
But the White House within minutes issued its
own version ol the president's statement, saving
that he asserted only that the United States
should have made clear in the I'mted Nations
that it opposed dismantling the settlements
I he first report was made by several represen
tatives ot Jewish organizations after a 20-mmute
White House meeting with Carter.
The I V resolution criticized the Israeli set
tlements and the I S. vote brought strong reac
tion from the Israeli government.

Saturday, had been a mistake. Yesterday the

communication between Washington and \m
bassador Donald McHenry. the I S. env ov to the
United Nations.
Rabbi Arthur Scheier. chairman ot the \meri
can section ol the World Jewish Congress, said
alter he and about 30 others met with Carter that
the president "made it clear that there were clear
indications, and in a way orders, given that an
abstention was in order and under no cir
cumstances should there be any reference to
Jerusalem or to the dismantling ot settlements" m
the resolution.
But minutes later, deputy White House press
secretary Rex Ciranum distributed what he said
was a verbatim report on the president's talk,
quoting the president as saying to his visitors:
"I instructed that we would abstain from the
L'.N.'s resolution that had any reference in it to
Jerusalem, and that we would make it clear that
we did not tavor the dismantling ot existing set
tlements."
Late Monday evening, the president said in a
written statement that the I S approval ot the
resolution stemmed from miscommunications ot
instructions to I N \nibassador Donald
McHenry.
State Department spokesman Hoddmg Cartel
said yesterday that Secretary of State Cvrus
\ a nee was taking responsibility tor the "toulup"
and that President Carter's instructions on how to
vote on the issue were not transmitted correctlv
to McHenry.
