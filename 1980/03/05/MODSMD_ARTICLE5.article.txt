## 
### Richard Hefter Staff Writer 
In the wake of the fire that gutted
Storey House Monday, much ot the
University community has been work
ing to give the 39 female residents in
terim housing and help them replace
the possessions they lost in the three
alarm blaze.
Last night. Row Director Mike
Bever met with the women to discuss
the housing options available to them.
"There are enough spaces in the
(University housing) system to take
care of everybody," he said, and added
that community residents have offered
to house the women. "We just want to
sort out priorities," he said.
in the meantime, most of the women
are staying with friends or relatives.
"We received quite a few calls to offer
them housing. It's been amazing how
many people have come to their aid."
said Sally Yost, manager of the Row
office.
Benefit dance
Yost said that there will be a benefit
dance Saturday night to help buy books
and clothes for the women. Tresidder
Union has donated its lounges, two or
three bands will donate their talents
and Adolph Coors Brewing Co. may be
donating beer for the event. A dona
tion of SI per person will be requested.
The women will meet today with Di
rector of Insurance and Risk Manage
ment Bob Beth to discuss insurance for
their losses.
Beth said that parents' homeowners
insurance should cover most of the los
ses. "If students need assistance in pre
paring insurance claims, we're pre
pared to help," he assured.
However, one woman who asked not
to be identified, a resident on the heav
ily damaged third floor, explained that
her parents live overseas and they do
not have any homeowners insurance.
She said there are other women
without the insurance also. "The issue
of University reimbursement will have
to come up. But the University is being
incredibly helpful — I think they'll do
everything in their power to be fair."
she said.

In addition to the enormous cost in
the loss of personal items like hooks,
clothes, jewelry, stereos, appliances,
etc.. the damage to the building itself is
about $500,000. according to an esti
mate made by Frank Jurian. assistant
director of public safety here.
No official estimate has been made
yet. according to Beth. He said that a
contractor has been hired to estimate
the cost of bringing the building back to
its original condition, as well as the cost
of bringing the building up to present
codes.
Beth added, however, that the fact
that the University is getting these fi
gures "doesn't mean we're rebuilding
the building."
It will be a matter of at least a couple
ol months before a decision is made to
rebuild it or tear it down, he said.
A plastic roof was put on Storey
yesteday to protect the building during
inspection, according to Jim Morgan,
associate director of facilities opera
tions and maintenance.
Fire fighters are still searching the
rubble for more information concern
ing the cause of the blaze. Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Chi ft Johnson
said he believes a short in an extension
cord ignited a bed. in a second floor
room. The blaze then traveled up
through the ceiling to the attic.
Johnson said firemen found a lire
extinguisher still on the wall within six
or eight feet of the room where the
blaze began. However, he explained
that the women probably could not see
it in the thick smoke.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, director of public safety, said
he found only six of the seven fire ex
tinguishers in Storey, and that one may
have been stolen before the lire.
He also said that one of the six fire
extinguishers in the house was empty.
"We've had problems before in
Storey with stolen or expended fire ex
tinguishers,-" he said.
Herrington added that the extin
guishers in Storey were checked on
Feb. 6 of this year.

The women will meet today with Di
rector of Insurance and Risk Manage
ment Bob Beth to discuss insurance for
their losses.
Beth said that parents' homeowners
insurance should cover most of the los
ses. "If students need assistance in pre
paring insurance claims, we're pre
pared to help," he assured.
However, one woman who asked not
to be identified, a resident on the heav
ily damaged third floor, explained that
her parents live overseas and they do
not have any homeowners insurance.
She said there are other women
without the insurance also. "The issue
of University reimbursement will have
to come up. But the University is being
incredibly helpful — I think they'll do
everything in their power to be fair."
she said.

In addition to the enormous cost in
the loss of personal items like hooks,
clothes, jewelry, stereos, appliances,
etc.. the damage to the building itself is
about $500,000. according to an esti
mate made by Frank Jurian. assistant
director of public safety here.
No official estimate has been made
yet. according to Beth. He said that a
contractor has been hired to estimate
the cost of bringing the building back to
its original condition, as well as the cost
of bringing the building up to present
codes.
Beth added, however, that the fact
that the University is getting these fi
gures "doesn't mean we're rebuilding
the building."
It will be a matter of at least a couple
ol months before a decision is made to
rebuild it or tear it down, he said.
A plastic roof was put on Storey
yesteday to protect the building during
inspection, according to Jim Morgan,
associate director of facilities opera
tions and maintenance.
Fire fighters are still searching the
rubble for more information concern
ing the cause of the blaze. Santa Clara
County Fire Marshal Chi ft Johnson
said he believes a short in an extension
cord ignited a bed. in a second floor
room. The blaze then traveled up
through the ceiling to the attic.
Johnson said firemen found a lire
extinguisher still on the wall within six
or eight feet of the room where the
blaze began. However, he explained
that the women probably could not see
it in the thick smoke.
Stanford Police Chief Marvin Her
rington, director of public safety, said
he found only six of the seven fire ex
tinguishers in Storey, and that one may
have been stolen before the lire.
He also said that one of the six fire
extinguishers in the house was empty.
"We've had problems before in
Storey with stolen or expended fire ex
tinguishers,-" he said.
Herrington added that the extin
guishers in Storey were checked on
Feb. 6 of this year.
