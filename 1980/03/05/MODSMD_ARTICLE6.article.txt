# Hayden opposes draft, urges conservation
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
Activist Tom Hayden spoke out yes
terday against registration for the
military draft and re-emphasized the
need to reduce American dependence
on foreign energy resources at a noon
rally here.
"We're running on borrowed time,
borrowed money and borrowed
energy, and if we're not more careful,
the debt is going to be called in — in the
form of insufficient energy, bad air. and
a ruined economy."
Hayden stressed that the problems
of inflation, energy and possible war in
the Middle East are interrelated. The
increasing national debt, he said, com
bined with growing fuel costs, simul
taneous recession and inflation, as well
as a general unwillingness to conserve
energy and make use of alternative
sources such as solar energy, have
created a situation which makes war in
the Middle East more likely.
"Dependence on fossil fuel means
we may have to go beyond the brink
and into war," he said.
Hayden decried what he called a
"whole petrochemical society that has
developed over the last 120 years since
oil was first discovered.

"We arc so dependent on foreign oil
now," he said, "that when we lost 2 1 :
percent of our total energy require
ments (during the 1 973 oil embargo). it
ended in a situation where people were
shooting each other in the gas stations.
"U.S. dependence on foreign oil,"
he claimed, "has turned our economy
into a house of cards."
Another factor which Hayden view
ed as contributing to these problems
is President Jimmy Carter's decision to
register IN-year-olds for the military
draft. According to Hayden, draft re
gistration is a political device being
used by Carter to gain popularity, but
which fails to deal with the basic under
lying problems of energy and the
economy.
"This generation wants conserva
tion. not conscription," Hayden said.
"Why rush pell-mell to conscription of
18-year-olds, but only make a token
move to conserve energy?"
During a question and answer
period, Hayden urged students to resist
the draft and the Persian Gulf Doctrine
by seeing themselves "as a brick in the
foundation of the Carter Doctrine. If
you pull yourself out, you see it begin to
crumble."
Hayden got little overt response

from the crowd of 400 that gathered to
hear him speak. The crowd decreased
to about 300 before Hayden left the
podium.
Hayden is chairperson of the Cam
paign for Economic Democracy. He
has been a highly visible figure in civil
rights, anti-war, anti-nuclear and anti
draft movements for the past 20 years.
In 1M62, he helped draft the radical
manifesto of the Students for a Democ
ratic Society, the Port Huron State
ment. He was a member of the Chicago
7 of I%N. He is currently married to
actress/activist Jane Fonda.
"Students today," he said,"have just
become aware of the fact that the first
layer of apathy is being torn off as the
long arm of the state reaches in and
closes books and tells you that poten
tially you have to be ready to die."
I layden warned of the consequences
of changes taking place in the present
Carter administration in which liberals
such as Andrew Young are "being re
placed by an unreeonstituted old guard
who view the Cold War as the 'good old
days.' "
These changes, coupled with U.S.
overdependence on foreign energy re
sources, he said, "leads us to a Kit Car
son mentality: 'Draw the wagons

"round us. boys, and keep the Indians at
hay.'
"We've never really made an effort
to consider the alternatives (to war),"
Hayden said, "or realize what a small
part of the answer the military factor
is."
Later on, he added, "I don't think the
Ayatollah Khomeini (the Iranian re
ligious leader) won because he had a
better military budget.
"We've made relatively few deci
sions to go to war that haven't been
questioned later on."
With regard to the presidential elec
tions now underway in this country.
Hayden reiterated his support for
California Gov. Jerry Brown. He
further denied speculation in a recent
article about him in the left-wing
periodical Mother Jones that he in
tended to run for president.
Speaking about the presidential can
didate John Anderson he said, "I think
of him what I thought of Jimmy Carter
four years ago. He's an honest, reason
able and candid man — the latest hon
est man to come walking down the
road."

didate John Anderson he said, "I think
of him what I thought of Jimmy Carter
four years ago. He's an honest, reason
able and candid man — the latest hon
est man to come walking down the
road."
Activist Tom Hayden spoke out yes
terday against registration for the
military draft and re-emphasized the
need to reduce American dependence
on foreign energy resources at a noon
rally here.
"We're running on borrowed time,
borrowed money and borrowed
energy, and if we're not more careful,
the debt is going to be called in — in the
form of insufficient energy, bad air. and
a ruined economy."
Hayden stressed that the problems
of inflation, energy and possible war in
the Middle East are interrelated. The
increasing national debt, he said, com
bined with growing fuel costs, simul
taneous recession and inflation, as well
as a general unwillingness to conserve
energy and make use of alternative
sources such as solar energy, have
created a situation which makes war in
the Middle East more likely.
"Dependence on fossil fuel means
we may have to go beyond the brink
and into war," he said.
Hayden decried what he called a
"whole petrochemical society that has
developed over the last 120 years since
oil was first discovered.

"We arc so dependent on foreign oil
now," he said, "that when we lost 2 1 :
percent of our total energy require
ments (during the 1 973 oil embargo). it
ended in a situation where people were
shooting each other in the gas stations.
"U.S. dependence on foreign oil,"
he claimed, "has turned our economy
into a house of cards."
Another factor which Hayden view
ed as contributing to these problems
is President Jimmy Carter's decision to
register IN-year-olds for the military
draft. According to Hayden, draft re
gistration is a political device being
used by Carter to gain popularity, but
which fails to deal with the basic under
lying problems of energy and the
economy.
"This generation wants conserva
tion. not conscription," Hayden said.
"Why rush pell-mell to conscription of
18-year-olds, but only make a token
move to conserve energy?"
During a question and answer
period, Hayden urged students to resist
the draft and the Persian Gulf Doctrine
by seeing themselves "as a brick in the
foundation of the Carter Doctrine. If
you pull yourself out, you see it begin to
crumble."
Hayden got little overt response

from the crowd of 400 that gathered to
hear him speak. The crowd decreased
to about 300 before Hayden left the
podium.
Hayden is chairperson of the Cam
paign for Economic Democracy. He
has been a highly visible figure in civil
rights, anti-war, anti-nuclear and anti
draft movements for the past 20 years.
In 1M62, he helped draft the radical
manifesto of the Students for a Democ
ratic Society, the Port Huron State
ment. He was a member of the Chicago
7 of I%N. He is currently married to
actress/activist Jane Fonda.
"Students today," he said,"have just
become aware of the fact that the first
layer of apathy is being torn off as the
long arm of the state reaches in and
closes books and tells you that poten
tially you have to be ready to die."
I layden warned of the consequences
of changes taking place in the present
Carter administration in which liberals
such as Andrew Young are "being re
placed by an unreeonstituted old guard
who view the Cold War as the 'good old
days.' "
These changes, coupled with U.S.
overdependence on foreign energy re
sources, he said, "leads us to a Kit Car
son mentality: 'Draw the wagons

"round us. boys, and keep the Indians at
hay.'
"We've never really made an effort
to consider the alternatives (to war),"
Hayden said, "or realize what a small
part of the answer the military factor
is."
Later on, he added, "I don't think the
Ayatollah Khomeini (the Iranian re
ligious leader) won because he had a
better military budget.
"We've made relatively few deci
sions to go to war that haven't been
questioned later on."
With regard to the presidential elec
tions now underway in this country.
Hayden reiterated his support for
California Gov. Jerry Brown. He
further denied speculation in a recent
article about him in the left-wing
periodical Mother Jones that he in
tended to run for president.
Speaking about the presidential can
didate John Anderson he said, "I think
