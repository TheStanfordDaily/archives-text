## Israelis angered by UN resolution U.S. vote mirrors frustration 
### John Goshko The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Ad
ministration sources said Mon
day the U.S. support of a United
Nations resolutions condemning
Israeli settlements in occupied
Arab lands had been approved
bv President Jimmy Carter and
Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance as a signal of deepening
I S. unhappiness over Israel's
settlements policy.
The vote Saturday in the U.N.
Security Council provoked a
storm ol angry reaction in Israel,
where officials ol Prime Minister
Menachem Begin's government
called it "unjustified and one
sided" and expressed "deep dis
appointment"' over U.S. support
for the measure.
It was the first time the council
had voted unanimously for a re
solution that, in effect, con
demned Jewish civilian settle
ments on the West Bank and
Ga/a Strip. The United States
had abstained on two previous

votes dealing with the controver
sial settlements issue.
Stories
In the wake of the vote, stories
began circulating here Monday
that the U.S. decision to support
the resolution had caused deep
divisions within the administra
tion. According to these stories,
the State Department and Car
ter's special Mideast mediator,
Sol I inowit/. had favored a U.S.
abstention but had been over
ruled after Donald McHenry.
U.S. Ambassador to the United
Nations, appealed directly to the
president for instructions to vote
in favor.
In the face of these rumors the
administration responded Mon
day by having State Department
spokesman Tom Reston read a
statement saying the vote did not
represent any change in U.S. pol
icy. In the statement Reston said
U.S. support for Israeli security
"remains firm and unwavering,"
but that U.S. objection to Israeli

settlements in the occupied ter
ritories "has been consistently
stated over a number of months
and remains unchanged."
Violates law
Although Reston did not say
so specifically, the U.S. position
has been that Israel's settlements
policy violates international law
and is an obstacle to Middle l ast
peace.
Reliable sources said privately
that the U.S. decision, made
alter several days ol wavering
between an abstention and a
"yes" vote, was attributable to
Vance and Carter directly and
did not reflect an intervention In
McHenry or anyone else.
In fact, the sources said, while
McHenry ended upas one of the
senior administration officials
recommending that the United
States back the resolution, he
previously changed his position
several times during the behind
the-scenes maneuvering at the
U.N. about the nature and word

mg ol the resolution.
In the end. the sources added.
Mcllenrv was told speciliciilly to
\ ote lor the resolution hy Vance
in a telephone conversation on
Saturday morning shortly before
the Security Council met and
adopted the resolution by vote ol
nil 15 members.
Consultation
At no time in the d;ivs preced
ing the \ote did McHenry meet
or speak directly with Carter, the
sources insisted. Instead, they
said, the basic decisions were
made In Vance in consultation
with the president.
Senior administration officials
dealing with the Middle Hast
have become increasingly con
cerned in recent weeks about the
possibility that the Begin gov
ernment's settlement policy
could jeopardize the Israeli-
I gyptian negotiations on creat
ing a sell-governing sy stem for
the Palestinian inhabitants of the
West Bank and Gaza.
