# Thatcher satire strikes British isles

### Nikki Finke The Associated Press 
LONDON — Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is becoming
something of a cult figure — the
target ot cartoonists, the butt ot
impressionists and even the
model of an "Iron 1 ady" Doll.
The paraphernalia that has
sprung up since Mrs. Ihatcher
took office shows how eager
British stores and showbiz
people are to cash in on the fame
surrounding Europe's first
female prime minister.
A British toy company is man
ufacturing an eight-inch
Thatcher Doll faithfully repro
ducing her full-figured body,
laquered hairstyle and school
teacher clothes.
It even comes with the outfit
she wore the day ot her electoral
triumph last year — a blue suit,
black poeketbook and pumps.
Lest you dare forget, the date
ol Thatcher's Conservative Party
win — May 3 — is stamped on
the back of her neck. And the
doll's wrist bears a tag gi\ ing ex
tracts from her victory speech.
Already the Thatcher dolls are
crossing the Atlantic. Peggy Nis
bet. whose Avon-based firm is
marketing the doll, says it has
been a huge success among U.S.
toy firms.
"The Americans really admire
Mrs. Thatcher.'" said Nisbet. 71.
who just happens to he an ardent
Conservative Party supporter.
"When I took the prototype
over there recently, the idea sold
straight away."
The doll retails lor about $27.
One has already been sent to
No. 10 Downing Street, though

no one knows |ust how the prime
minister likes her new. it unsol
icited. gilt.
Just as Richard \1 Nixon had
his series ol comic look-alikes.
Th a t eh e r* s m arbles-in-the
mouth speech and parlor-perfect
looks have gi\ en birth to a pair ol
lemale impersonators.
One ol them. Janet Brown,
can pass as the real McCoy when
she puts on the prim and proper
clothes that Mrs. Thatcher
wears. Her imitation is so good,
it once tooled a House ol Com
mons guard.
Not only does Brown include
Thatcher's likeness in a cabaret
act. but she has just come out
with a record album that is ;i
take-oft from one ot the prime
minister's famous speeches.
The original compared the
roots of the Conservative Party
to "early man's search for God."
Brown's version aims for laughs
with Thatcher allegedly talking
about Noah's construction ol the
arc as the lirst case of free enter
prise boat-building.
One British newspaper ar
ranged for Brown — dressed in
her prime minister role — to
come tace-to-facc with
Thatcher.
"Now don't you change too
much."
"No." replied Thatcher with a
careful smile. "I mustn't deprive
you of your li\ elihood."
The other mimic. Faith
Brown, has her own Saturday
night television show on Bri
tain's commercial station this
season.
She also looks convincingly
like Thatcher — but with a dif

ference. Her skit that gets the
best laugh has Thatcher turning
into a bosomy. scantily dressed
Wonder Woman in times of
trouble.
This portrayal of Thatcher as
more a woman than a prime
minister is a favorite ploy of Bri
tain's political cartoonists.
Just recently, the Daily Ex
press tabloid wanted to illustrate
how Thatcher's policies are
being chipped away by dissen
sion in her cabinet and the barbs
ol her opposition, the Labor
Party.
What did the cartoon show?
Thatcher is .1 topless Venus de
Milo — or rather Venus ol
Downing Street as the pedestal
under her said.
When the trusted ministers
knocked the arms oil the famous
statue, the caption exclaimed:
"Oops. Let's sav the cat did it!"
One of London's left-wing
publications. Time Out, has a
weekly comic strip that trans
forms Thatcher and her cabinet
into animals — and the charac
ters are fat. ugly-looking beasts.
Even the Labor Party is get
ting in on the act.
The opposition came out with
a cartoon of Thatcher looking
like a cross between a witch and a
vulture and made it the center
piece of a new advertising cam
paign to boost membership.
The drawing by political car
toonist Ralph Steadman made its
debut in several London news
papers last month and will ap
pear on posters, badges and beer
mug coasters in the very near tu
tu re

Eric Heller, chairman ot
I.abor'sorganization committee,
fiercely denied claims that the
cartoon was nasty or cruel.
"I think it's rather flattering."
he said.
Is the cult around Thatcher
going a bit too far?
Just recently it was announced
that Thatcher's birthplace, a
former grocery store in Gran
tham. Lincolnshire, is going to be
turned into a high-class restaur
ant.

roots of the Conservative Party
to "early man's search for God."
Brown's version aims for laughs
with Thatcher allegedly talking
about Noah's construction ol the
arc as the lirst case of free enter

One British newspaper ar
ranged for Brown — dressed in
her prime minister role — to
come tace-to-facc with
Thatcher.
"Now don't you change too
much."
"No." replied Thatcher with a
careful smile. "I mustn't deprive
you of your li\ elihood."
The other mimic. Faith
Brown, has her own Saturday
night television show on Bri
tain's commercial station this
season.
She also looks convincingly
like Thatcher — but with a dif

ference. Her skit that gets the
best laugh has Thatcher turning
into a bosomy. scantily dressed
Wonder Woman in times of
trouble.
This portrayal of Thatcher as
more a woman than a prime
minister is a favorite ploy of Bri
tain's political cartoonists.
Just recently, the Daily Ex
press tabloid wanted to illustrate
how Thatcher's policies are
being chipped away by dissen
sion in her cabinet and the barbs
ol her opposition, the Labor
Party.
What did the cartoon show?
Thatcher is .1 topless Venus de
Milo — or rather Venus ol
Downing Street as the pedestal
under her said.
When the trusted ministers
knocked the arms oil the famous
statue, the caption exclaimed:
"Oops. Let's sav the cat did it!"
One of London's left-wing
publications. Time Out, has a
weekly comic strip that trans
forms Thatcher and her cabinet
into animals — and the charac
ters are fat. ugly-looking beasts.
Even the Labor Party is get
ting in on the act.
The opposition came out with
a cartoon of Thatcher looking
like a cross between a witch and a
vulture and made it the center
piece of a new advertising cam
paign to boost membership.
The drawing by political car
toonist Ralph Steadman made its
debut in several London news
papers last month and will ap

LONDON — Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher is becoming
something of a cult figure — the
target ot cartoonists, the butt ot
impressionists and even the
model of an "Iron 1 ady" Doll.
The paraphernalia that has
sprung up since Mrs. Ihatcher
took office shows how eager
British stores and showbiz
people are to cash in on the fame
surrounding Europe's first
female prime minister.
A British toy company is man
ufacturing an eight-inch
Thatcher Doll faithfully repro
ducing her full-figured body,
laquered hairstyle and school
teacher clothes.
It even comes with the outfit
she wore the day ot her electoral
triumph last year — a blue suit,
black poeketbook and pumps.
Lest you dare forget, the date
ol Thatcher's Conservative Party
win — May 3 — is stamped on
the back of her neck. And the
doll's wrist bears a tag gi\ ing ex
tracts from her victory speech.
Already the Thatcher dolls are
crossing the Atlantic. Peggy Nis
bet. whose Avon-based firm is
marketing the doll, says it has
been a huge success among U.S.
toy firms.
"The Americans really admire
Mrs. Thatcher.'" said Nisbet. 71.

"When I took the prototype
over there recently, the idea sold

looks have gi\ en birth to a pair ol

One ol them. Janet Brown,
can pass as the real McCoy when
she puts on the prim and proper
clothes that Mrs. Thatcher
wears. Her imitation is so good,
it once tooled a House ol Com

Not only does Brown include
Thatcher's likeness in a cabaret
