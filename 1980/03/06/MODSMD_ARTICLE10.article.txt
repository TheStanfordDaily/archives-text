# Harris: 'No strategic advantage in registration'
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
(David Harris, 34, is a Stan
ford graduate who spent 30
months in jail for resisting the
draft during the Vietnam War. He
is currently active in movements
against resumption of military re
gistration and conscription. He
has made speeches nationwide
against registration and conscrip
tion. Last week, Harris talked to
the Daily about the latest gov
ernmental effort to reinstitute re
gistration.)
Daily: Why do you think Presi
dent Carter has called for a re
sumption of military registration?
Harris: There is no significant
strategic advantage in resuming
military registration.
There is a political advantage
for Carter here. Carter is suffer
ing from a crisis in his leadership
image. This (resumption of re
gistration) is an attempt to act as
if he is strong without offending a
major portion of his consti
tuency. He needs to win reelec
tion, and a good portion of his
constituency is in the mood to
play John Wayne. Carter is at
tempting to tap into that.
Daily: Is resumption of registra
tion a valuable signal to the Sbviet
Union of American strength?
Harris: I don't think it is a signal
at all. Gas rationing would be a
much more effective signal to the
Russians. The Soviets are capa
ble of understanding what is
going on in the United States.
Registration is not some signal or
statement of strength. It requires
no sacrifice.
Daily: Is the second Cold War
coming?
Harris: Clearly, yes. It is a mis
take to interpret the current situ
ation as completely similiar to
that of the '50s. There are diffe
rent twists in this situation. It will
be a whole lot colder than that
that went before. In the long run.
our actions are aimed not just at
Russia. There arc many other
implications. This is the first time
in history that the United States
has gone on record to fight for
resources, to fight for petroleum.
1 see this as an extremely
dangerous precedent. I think we
are now committed to fight for a
series of resources, according to
the Carter Doctrine.
Daily: Should Congress draft
women?
Harris: If there is a draft,
everyone ought to be drafted.
But I don't think there should be
a draft. I don't think Congress
will pass the draft for women.
Daily: Will registration pass
Congress this year?
Harris: That's an open question.
If I had to make a bet. I would
say yes, it will pass.
Daily: Do you think most stu
dents will register?
Harris: Yes. I do.
Daily:/ v conscription far behind,
if registration passes?
Harris: I think a full-fledged
draft is definitely behind regist
ration. The real danger is not
that there will be a war tomorrow
but that they (administration of
ficials) will make military plans
with the blank check ot man

power that registration and the
draft provides. Within a year,
after registration, I believe they
will start drafting people.
Daily: Are we seeing on college
campuses today the beginnings of
a major protest movement like
that of the '60s?
Harris: It is unlikely. Published
reports saying that demonstra
tions today are small by the stan
dards of the '60s are untrue.
The demonstrations today
are not small by the stan
dards of 1967, maybe by those of
the early '70s. But this (student
reaction) is not a return to the
'60s. The historical circumstances
are very different. Whether this
protest will grow into something
bigger is an open question. Stu
dents today start ahead of what
we did. Today's students are
much more open to questions
and to questioning the act of
fighting for one's country than
my generation. On the other
hand, they (today's students) do
not have the organizational skills
that we had. We acquired a lot of
direct political experience in the
'60s. Students today will have to
learn a lot of lessons the hard
way — by making mistakes. If
conscription passes, the resis
tance movement will gradually
expand. Frankly, 1 have been as
tounded by large crowds. I spoke
to a crowd of 2500 in San Diego
recently.
Daily: Speaking here in January
you said reinstating registration
was a political move on Carter's
part? Is it a risky move?
Harris: In the long run. It will be
perceived as a poorly thought
out policy. It has created need
less head-to-head confrontation
between the United States and
the Soviets. Its long term impli
cations are that it will deteriorate
Carter's political base. Inflation
will rise. Nothing nurses inflation
more than military spending.
Carter's call for 200 billion
spending on defense will gener
ate significant inflation. I don't
know if this will show up by the
election. But Carter's first reac
tion is to go for the John Wayne
image. There should be a general
shift away from this attitude on
the public part as they realize in
flationary and other implica
tions.
Daily: Do you think the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan poses, as
/'resident Carter has suggested,
"the greatest threat to world peace
since World War II?"
Harris: As a member of the Vie
tnam generation, I am insulted
by Carter passing over the im
portance of two wars — the Ko
rean and Vietnam Wars — in this
manner. It is historical absurdity.
But I do not think the Soviet in
vasion was a move toward the
Persian Gulf. The invasion is a
step consistent with the last 30
years of Soviet foreign policy.
The Soviets have given more
foreign aid to Afghanistan in the
last 20 years than to any other
country. II you are going to the
Persian Gulf, you don't go
through Afghanistan. You go
through Iran. Now the Soviets

have their Vietnam. The best
policy would he to keep Af
ghanistan from running out of
ammunition. The Carter Doe
trine does not let us take advan
tage of the situation. Now we
have both feet in defending the
Carter Doctrine — a doctrine
which does not recognize the
realities of the Middle East. We
need to remake our relationship
with Islam.
Daily: Will C 'otigress press for le
nient or strict measures for people
refusing to register?
Harris: The best policy is to as
sume the worst. Foranyone mak
ing a decision as to whether to
register, I think they should as
sume that penalities will be the
same as those during the Viet
nam War (5 years in prison). The
government has a significant
problem in enforcement. If 1
percent of young adults don't re
gister. you have 100,000 people.
That is a lot for the court and
prison system to handle. The
government will probably prose
cute the visible ones rather than
everybody.
Daily: How do you view the Stan
ford reaction?
Harris: I am very pleased and
surprised. I feel a historical con
nection here. I feel Stanford
University has a tradition of
standing up to the government
on this sort of thing. 1 am glad the
tradition is carrying on.

draft is definitely behind regist
ration. The real danger is not
that there will be a war tomorrow
but that they (administration of
ficials) will make military plans
with the blank check ot man

power that registration and the
draft provides. Within a year,
after registration, I believe they
will start drafting people.
Daily: Are we seeing on college
campuses today the beginnings of
a major protest movement like
that of the '60s?
Harris: It is unlikely. Published
reports saying that demonstra
tions today are small by the stan
dards of the '60s are untrue.
The demonstrations today
are not small by the stan
dards of 1967, maybe by those of
the early '70s. But this (student
reaction) is not a return to the
'60s. The historical circumstances
are very different. Whether this
protest will grow into something
bigger is an open question. Stu
dents today start ahead of what
we did. Today's students are
much more open to questions
and to questioning the act of
fighting for one's country than
my generation. On the other
hand, they (today's students) do
not have the organizational skills
that we had. We acquired a lot of
direct political experience in the
'60s. Students today will have to
learn a lot of lessons the hard
way — by making mistakes. If
conscription passes, the resis
tance movement will gradually
expand. Frankly, 1 have been as
tounded by large crowds. I spoke
to a crowd of 2500 in San Diego
recently.
Daily: Speaking here in January
you said reinstating registration
was a political move on Carter's
part? Is it a risky move?
Harris: In the long run. It will be
perceived as a poorly thought
out policy. It has created need
less head-to-head confrontation
between the United States and
the Soviets. Its long term impli
cations are that it will deteriorate
Carter's political base. Inflation
will rise. Nothing nurses inflation
more than military spending.
Carter's call for 200 billion
spending on defense will gener
ate significant inflation. I don't
know if this will show up by the
election. But Carter's first reac
tion is to go for the John Wayne
image. There should be a general
shift away from this attitude on
the public part as they realize in
flationary and other implica
tions.
Daily: Do you think the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan poses, as
/'resident Carter has suggested,
"the greatest threat to world peace
since World War II?"
Harris: As a member of the Vie
tnam generation, I am insulted
by Carter passing over the im
portance of two wars — the Ko
rean and Vietnam Wars — in this
manner. It is historical absurdity.
But I do not think the Soviet in
vasion was a move toward the
Persian Gulf. The invasion is a
step consistent with the last 30
years of Soviet foreign policy.
The Soviets have given more
foreign aid to Afghanistan in the
last 20 years than to any other
country. II you are going to the
Persian Gulf, you don't go
through Afghanistan. You go
through Iran. Now the Soviets

have their Vietnam. The best
policy would he to keep Af
ghanistan from running out of
ammunition. The Carter Doe
trine does not let us take advan
tage of the situation. Now we
have both feet in defending the
Carter Doctrine — a doctrine
which does not recognize the
realities of the Middle East. We
need to remake our relationship
with Islam.
Daily: Will C 'otigress press for le
nient or strict measures for people
refusing to register?
Harris: The best policy is to as
sume the worst. Foranyone mak
ing a decision as to whether to
register, I think they should as
sume that penalities will be the
same as those during the Viet
nam War (5 years in prison). The
government has a significant
problem in enforcement. If 1
percent of young adults don't re
gister. you have 100,000 people.
That is a lot for the court and
prison system to handle. The
government will probably prose
cute the visible ones rather than
everybody.
Daily: How do you view the Stan
ford reaction?
Harris: I am very pleased and
surprised. I feel a historical con
nection here. I feel Stanford
University has a tradition of
standing up to the government
on this sort of thing. 1 am glad the
tradition is carrying on.
(David Harris, 34, is a Stan
ford graduate who spent 30
months in jail for resisting the
draft during the Vietnam War. He
is currently active in movements
against resumption of military re
gistration and conscription. He
has made speeches nationwide
against registration and conscrip
tion. Last week, Harris talked to
the Daily about the latest gov
ernmental effort to reinstitute re
gistration.)
Daily: Why do you think Presi
dent Carter has called for a re
sumption of military registration?
Harris: There is no significant
strategic advantage in resuming
military registration.
There is a political advantage
for Carter here. Carter is suffer
ing from a crisis in his leadership
image. This (resumption of re
gistration) is an attempt to act as
if he is strong without offending a
major portion of his consti
tuency. He needs to win reelec
tion, and a good portion of his
constituency is in the mood to
play John Wayne. Carter is at
tempting to tap into that.
Daily: Is resumption of registra
tion a valuable signal to the Sbviet
Union of American strength?
Harris: I don't think it is a signal
at all. Gas rationing would be a
much more effective signal to the
Russians. The Soviets are capa
ble of understanding what is
going on in the United States.
Registration is not some signal or
statement of strength. It requires
no sacrifice.
Daily: Is the second Cold War
coming?
Harris: Clearly, yes. It is a mis
take to interpret the current situ
ation as completely similiar to
that of the '50s. There are diffe
rent twists in this situation. It will
be a whole lot colder than that
that went before. In the long run.
our actions are aimed not just at
Russia. There arc many other
implications. This is the first time
in history that the United States
has gone on record to fight for
resources, to fight for petroleum.
1 see this as an extremely
dangerous precedent. I think we
are now committed to fight for a
series of resources, according to
the Carter Doctrine.

portance of two wars — the Ko
rean and Vietnam Wars — in this
manner. It is historical absurdity.
But I do not think the Soviet in
vasion was a move toward the
Persian Gulf. The invasion is a
step consistent with the last 30
years of Soviet foreign policy.
The Soviets have given more
foreign aid to Afghanistan in the
last 20 years than to any other
country. II you are going to the
Persian Gulf, you don't go
through Afghanistan. You go
through Iran. Now the Soviets

have their Vietnam. The best
policy would he to keep Af
ghanistan from running out of
ammunition. The Carter Doe
trine does not let us take advan
tage of the situation. Now we
have both feet in defending the
Carter Doctrine — a doctrine
which does not recognize the
realities of the Middle East. We
need to remake our relationship
with Islam.
Daily: Will C 'otigress press for le
nient or strict measures for people
refusing to register?
Harris: The best policy is to as
sume the worst. Foranyone mak
ing a decision as to whether to
register, I think they should as
sume that penalities will be the
same as those during the Viet
nam War (5 years in prison). The
government has a significant
problem in enforcement. If 1
percent of young adults don't re
gister. you have 100,000 people.
That is a lot for the court and
prison system to handle. The
government will probably prose
cute the visible ones rather than
everybody.
Daily: How do you view the Stan
ford reaction?
Harris: I am very pleased and
surprised. I feel a historical con
nection here. I feel Stanford
University has a tradition of
standing up to the government
on this sort of thing. 1 am glad the
tradition is carrying on.
