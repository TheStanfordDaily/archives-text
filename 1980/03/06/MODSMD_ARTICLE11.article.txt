# McCloskey: 'Second Cold War has started'
## 
### Nancy Koehn 
In February, 1979, U.S. Rep
resentative Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) introduced a
National Youth Service bill in the
U.S. House of Representatives. //
passed, this bill would require all
18-year-olds to choose between
military or civilian service with
benefits given according to what
type of service was chosen. For
the last 12 months, McCloskey
has spoken extensively on this
and other registration or con
scription proposals. Recently,
McCloskey spoke to the Daily
about President Jimmy Carter's
request to Congress for reinstitu
tion of military registration.
Daily: Why has President Carter
called for resumption of military
registration?
McCloskey: I think he took the
occasion of the Afghanistan in
vasion and the general unrest
over the Iranian situation and
Afghanistan to move toward a
situation he couldn't otherwise
politically have afforded. This
(reinstitution of registration) is
also a clear admission, on the
administration's part, that our
all-volunteer army is not work
ing. This move should he consi
dered as the first step towards
the draft. However. I don't be
lieve in the draft. We will have to
take some step like my proposal
for a National Youth Service.
Daily: Much lias been said about
the value of military registration
us a symbol or signal to the Soviet
Union of United States determi
nation or strength. Is this a valid
contention?
McCloskey: Not unless we
couple registration with an ob
servable willingness to improve
our army. Also, people may not
construe this as a sign ot tough
ness because like so much of
what Carter says, he has gone
back and forth many times.
Daily: Is the United States mov
ing toward a second Cold War in
its dealings with the Soviet Un
ion?
McCloskey: The second Cold
War has started. The question
now is whether this flurry of ac
tions can be tempered with the
realization that there is an alter
native to this fluttering back and
torth \s both countries' leaders
reali/e. continued deterioration
in I .S.-Soviet relations brings
the possibility ol nuclear war
closer. At some point. I would
hope reason would take over and
both countries' leaders would
take a step back and reali/e the
danger ot escalation, and at
tempt to find a different solution
to the problem. Essentially. this
would have to be done at a sum
nut meeting between the leaders
ol the two countries.
Daily: Do you support or oppose
the president s call for resump
tion of military registration?
McCloskey: I \ote: On February
It). 19,50, McCloskey told a Uni
versit\ audience here that he will
vote tn favor of dra ft registration
lor both men and women. Ile said
then that registration should be
limited to IS year-olds.) I voted

against registration last fall be
cause there was no compromise
in that hill about getting a Na
tional Youth Service (NYS) re
port from the Administration.
Since that time, the Administra
tion has reported on the National
Youth Ser\ ice as the most prom
ising alternative to registration.
II registration comes up for a
vote and I can make it consistent
with National Youth Service
proposals. I will support it. I
favor the registration uf women
and men for NYS. However. I
wouldn't want to draft women
unless the Equal Rights
Amendment passes. I support
ERA. (Note: On Feb. 10, 1980,
McCloskey said here that he did
not think women should be con
sidered for combat duty.)
Daily: Does America support the
reinstitution of registration?
McCloskey: Sure. The polls
show something like 70-30 per
ce nt of older A mericans su ppo rt -
ing registration and I believe
something like 80-20 percent ot
younger Americans oppose it. 1
am interested in how 21 year
olds feel about registration now
that they are not eligible. Now. if
40 year-olds hiid to register. I am
sure the polls would show diffe
rent results.
Daily: Is this a politically risky
move on Carter's part'.''
McCloskey: I can't escape the
speculation that politics is part ot
Carter's motivation. I don't
know if it's risky. Most older
people support it. Most younger
people do not. Although quite
clearly, it (student reaction) is
not the kind of protest on the
campuses that it was in the '60s.
There is a lot of sober thought on
this subject on the campuses to
day.
Daily: Will registration pass
Congress?
McCloskey: 1 honestly don't
know. My colleagues right now
are thinking of reelection. The
chairman of the House Sub
committee on Manpower has
said we don't need registration
since the president presently has
the power to call men to register.
There is a general inertia in the
Congress. I really couldn't make
a prediction as to whether regist
ration will pass.
Daily: // registration passes the
Congress,is conscription far be
hind'.'
McCloskey: Yes. the only reason
tliev are not coupled together is
because it is an election year.
Daily: Does the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan pose, as I'resident
Carter contends, "the greatest
threat to world peace since World
War II?"
McCloskey: I don't know. He
(Carter) may have overreacted.
One question is whether the
Sov lets, in invading Afghanistan,
were reacting to a local situation.
The more difficult question is.
are the Soviets after the Persian
Gulf? I suspect the invasion was
a local reaction. However, when
the Soviets v ievv the Carter reac
tion. they are now in a position to
far more seriously weigh thepos

sibility of moving toward the
Persian Gulf. To this extent,
there is a grave threat to world
peace although not tor Carter's
reasons.
Daily: Will Congress, assuming
registration passes, adopt lenient
or stringent measures for students
refusing to register?
McCloskey: Unfortunately, I
think my colleagues will make it
a crime to refuse to register. I
favor the denial ot federal
privileges to students refusing to
register. This, I believe, is a
proposal by a Stanford profes
sor. This proposal would take
away certain privileges of living
in this country such as use of the
national parks, etc. I think this is
a far more efficient proposal
than jail sentences. Why not take
the privileges of being a citizen
away from those not registering?
But, knowing my colleagues, I
think they will take the easy way
out and institute jail sentences.
Daily: Do you think most stu
dents will register?
McCloskey: Reasonable people
will not refuse to register. Tins
(refusing to register) is a hollow
glory. However, I can under
stand resisting the dratt. I don t
think the principle behind regist
ration is all that clear.
Daily: You were quoted as saying
last year that an army of reluctant
conscripts would bring with them
a reluctance to fight which would
do more to prevent our involve
ment in future conflicts. Does this
reasoning apply to Carter's
reinstitution of the draft?
McCloskey: With my military
experience, I feel familiar with
the military mind. 1 would much
rather have a citizen army made
up ot men and women from all
walks of life than an army of pro
fessional soldiers. The people
who get killed in wars are the IN
and 19 year-olds. I would rather
have a cross-section of students
in the army than people who
want to be there. It's like people
who want to be policemen be
cause they want to carry a gun.
Fhey are perhaps more likely to
head into conflict than more re
luctant conscripts.

In February, 1979, U.S. Rep
resentative Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) introduced a
National Youth Service bill in the
U.S. House of Representatives. //
passed, this bill would require all
18-year-olds to choose between
military or civilian service with
benefits given according to what
type of service was chosen. For
the last 12 months, McCloskey
has spoken extensively on this
and other registration or con
scription proposals. Recently,
McCloskey spoke to the Daily
about President Jimmy Carter's
request to Congress for reinstitu
tion of military registration.
Daily: Why has President Carter
called for resumption of military
registration?
McCloskey: I think he took the
occasion of the Afghanistan in
vasion and the general unrest
over the Iranian situation and
Afghanistan to move toward a
situation he couldn't otherwise
politically have afforded. This
(reinstitution of registration) is
also a clear admission, on the
administration's part, that our
all-volunteer army is not work
ing. This move should he consi
dered as the first step towards
the draft. However. I don't be
lieve in the draft. We will have to
take some step like my proposal
for a National Youth Service.
Daily: Much lias been said about
the value of military registration
us a symbol or signal to the Soviet
Union of United States determi
nation or strength. Is this a valid
contention?
McCloskey: Not unless we
couple registration with an ob
servable willingness to improve
our army. Also, people may not
construe this as a sign ot tough
ness because like so much of
what Carter says, he has gone
back and forth many times.
Daily: Is the United States mov
ing toward a second Cold War in
its dealings with the Soviet Un
ion?
McCloskey: The second Cold
War has started. The question
now is whether this flurry of ac
tions can be tempered with the
realization that there is an alter
native to this fluttering back and
torth \s both countries' leaders
reali/e. continued deterioration
in I .S.-Soviet relations brings
the possibility ol nuclear war
closer. At some point. I would
hope reason would take over and
both countries' leaders would
take a step back and reali/e the
danger ot escalation, and at
tempt to find a different solution
to the problem. Essentially. this
would have to be done at a sum
nut meeting between the leaders
ol the two countries.
Daily: Do you support or oppose
the president s call for resump
tion of military registration?
McCloskey: I \ote: On February
It). 19,50, McCloskey told a Uni
versit\ audience here that he will
vote tn favor of dra ft registration
lor both men and women. Ile said
then that registration should be
limited to IS year-olds.) I voted

against registration last fall be
cause there was no compromise
in that hill about getting a Na
tional Youth Service (NYS) re
port from the Administration.
Since that time, the Administra
tion has reported on the National
Youth Ser\ ice as the most prom
ising alternative to registration.
II registration comes up for a
vote and I can make it consistent
with National Youth Service
proposals. I will support it. I
favor the registration uf women
and men for NYS. However. I
wouldn't want to draft women
unless the Equal Rights
Amendment passes. I support
ERA. (Note: On Feb. 10, 1980,
McCloskey said here that he did
not think women should be con
sidered for combat duty.)
Daily: Does America support the
reinstitution of registration?
McCloskey: Sure. The polls
show something like 70-30 per
ce nt of older A mericans su ppo rt -
ing registration and I believe
something like 80-20 percent ot
younger Americans oppose it. 1
am interested in how 21 year
olds feel about registration now
that they are not eligible. Now. if
40 year-olds hiid to register. I am
sure the polls would show diffe
rent results.
Daily: Is this a politically risky
move on Carter's part'.''
McCloskey: I can't escape the
speculation that politics is part ot
Carter's motivation. I don't
know if it's risky. Most older
people support it. Most younger
people do not. Although quite
clearly, it (student reaction) is
not the kind of protest on the
campuses that it was in the '60s.
There is a lot of sober thought on
this subject on the campuses to
day.
Daily: Will registration pass
Congress?
McCloskey: 1 honestly don't
know. My colleagues right now
are thinking of reelection. The
chairman of the House Sub
committee on Manpower has
said we don't need registration
since the president presently has
the power to call men to register.
There is a general inertia in the
Congress. I really couldn't make
a prediction as to whether regist
ration will pass.
Daily: // registration passes the
Congress,is conscription far be
hind'.'
McCloskey: Yes. the only reason
tliev are not coupled together is
because it is an election year.
Daily: Does the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan pose, as I'resident
Carter contends, "the greatest
threat to world peace since World
War II?"
McCloskey: I don't know. He
(Carter) may have overreacted.
One question is whether the
Sov lets, in invading Afghanistan,
were reacting to a local situation.
The more difficult question is.
are the Soviets after the Persian
Gulf? I suspect the invasion was
a local reaction. However, when
the Soviets v ievv the Carter reac
tion. they are now in a position to
far more seriously weigh thepos

sibility of moving toward the
Persian Gulf. To this extent,
there is a grave threat to world
peace although not tor Carter's
reasons.
Daily: Will Congress, assuming
registration passes, adopt lenient
or stringent measures for students
refusing to register?
McCloskey: Unfortunately, I
think my colleagues will make it
a crime to refuse to register. I
favor the denial ot federal
privileges to students refusing to
register. This, I believe, is a
proposal by a Stanford profes
sor. This proposal would take
away certain privileges of living
in this country such as use of the
national parks, etc. I think this is
a far more efficient proposal
than jail sentences. Why not take
the privileges of being a citizen
away from those not registering?
But, knowing my colleagues, I
think they will take the easy way
out and institute jail sentences.
Daily: Do you think most stu
dents will register?
McCloskey: Reasonable people
will not refuse to register. Tins
(refusing to register) is a hollow
glory. However, I can under
stand resisting the dratt. I don t
think the principle behind regist
ration is all that clear.
Daily: You were quoted as saying
last year that an army of reluctant
conscripts would bring with them
a reluctance to fight which would
do more to prevent our involve
ment in future conflicts. Does this
reasoning apply to Carter's
reinstitution of the draft?
McCloskey: With my military
experience, I feel familiar with
the military mind. 1 would much
rather have a citizen army made
up ot men and women from all
walks of life than an army of pro
fessional soldiers. The people
who get killed in wars are the IN
and 19 year-olds. I would rather
have a cross-section of students
in the army than people who
want to be there. It's like people
who want to be policemen be
cause they want to carry a gun.

head into conflict than more re

In February, 1979, U.S. Rep
resentative Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) introduced a
National Youth Service bill in the
U.S. House of Representatives. //
passed, this bill would require all
18-year-olds to choose between
military or civilian service with
benefits given according to what
type of service was chosen. For
the last 12 months, McCloskey
has spoken extensively on this
and other registration or con
scription proposals. Recently,
McCloskey spoke to the Daily
about President Jimmy Carter's
request to Congress for reinstitu
tion of military registration.
Daily: Why has President Carter
called for resumption of military
registration?
McCloskey: I think he took the
occasion of the Afghanistan in
vasion and the general unrest
over the Iranian situation and
Afghanistan to move toward a
situation he couldn't otherwise
politically have afforded. This
(reinstitution of registration) is
also a clear admission, on the
administration's part, that our
all-volunteer army is not work
ing. This move should he consi
dered as the first step towards
the draft. However. I don't be
lieve in the draft. We will have to
take some step like my proposal
for a National Youth Service.
Daily: Much lias been said about
the value of military registration
us a symbol or signal to the Soviet
Union of United States determi
nation or strength. Is this a valid
contention?
McCloskey: Not unless we
couple registration with an ob
servable willingness to improve
our army. Also, people may not
construe this as a sign ot tough
ness because like so much of
what Carter says, he has gone
back and forth many times.
Daily: Is the United States mov
ing toward a second Cold War in
its dealings with the Soviet Un
ion?
McCloskey: The second Cold
War has started. The question
now is whether this flurry of ac
tions can be tempered with the
realization that there is an alter
native to this fluttering back and
torth \s both countries' leaders
reali/e. continued deterioration
in I .S.-Soviet relations brings
the possibility ol nuclear war
closer. At some point. I would
hope reason would take over and
both countries' leaders would
take a step back and reali/e the
danger ot escalation, and at
tempt to find a different solution
to the problem. Essentially. this
would have to be done at a sum
nut meeting between the leaders
ol the two countries.
Daily: Do you support or oppose
the president s call for resump
tion of military registration?
McCloskey: I \ote: On February
It). 19,50, McCloskey told a Uni
versit\ audience here that he will
vote tn favor of dra ft registration
lor both men and women. Ile said
then that registration should be
limited to IS year-olds.) I voted

against registration last fall be
cause there was no compromise
in that hill about getting a Na
tional Youth Service (NYS) re
port from the Administration.
Since that time, the Administra
tion has reported on the National
Youth Ser\ ice as the most prom
ising alternative to registration.
II registration comes up for a
vote and I can make it consistent
with National Youth Service
proposals. I will support it. I
favor the registration uf women
and men for NYS. However. I
wouldn't want to draft women
unless the Equal Rights
Amendment passes. I support
ERA. (Note: On Feb. 10, 1980,
McCloskey said here that he did
not think women should be con
sidered for combat duty.)
Daily: Does America support the
reinstitution of registration?
McCloskey: Sure. The polls
show something like 70-30 per
ce nt of older A mericans su ppo rt -
ing registration and I believe
something like 80-20 percent ot
younger Americans oppose it. 1
am interested in how 21 year
olds feel about registration now
that they are not eligible. Now. if
40 year-olds hiid to register. I am
sure the polls would show diffe
rent results.
Daily: Is this a politically risky
move on Carter's part'.''
McCloskey: I can't escape the
speculation that politics is part ot
Carter's motivation. I don't
know if it's risky. Most older
people support it. Most younger
people do not. Although quite
clearly, it (student reaction) is
not the kind of protest on the
campuses that it was in the '60s.
There is a lot of sober thought on
this subject on the campuses to
day.
Daily: Will registration pass
Congress?
McCloskey: 1 honestly don't
know. My colleagues right now
are thinking of reelection. The
chairman of the House Sub
committee on Manpower has
said we don't need registration
since the president presently has
the power to call men to register.
There is a general inertia in the
Congress. I really couldn't make
a prediction as to whether regist
ration will pass.
Daily: // registration passes the
Congress,is conscription far be
hind'.'
McCloskey: Yes. the only reason
tliev are not coupled together is
because it is an election year.
Daily: Does the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan pose, as I'resident
Carter contends, "the greatest
threat to world peace since World
War II?"
McCloskey: I don't know. He
(Carter) may have overreacted.
One question is whether the
Sov lets, in invading Afghanistan,
were reacting to a local situation.
The more difficult question is.
are the Soviets after the Persian
Gulf? I suspect the invasion was
a local reaction. However, when
the Soviets v ievv the Carter reac
tion. they are now in a position to
far more seriously weigh thepos

sibility of moving toward the
Persian Gulf. To this extent,
there is a grave threat to world
peace although not tor Carter's
reasons.
Daily: Will Congress, assuming
registration passes, adopt lenient
or stringent measures for students
refusing to register?
McCloskey: Unfortunately, I
think my colleagues will make it
a crime to refuse to register. I
favor the denial ot federal
privileges to students refusing to
register. This, I believe, is a
proposal by a Stanford profes
sor. This proposal would take
away certain privileges of living
in this country such as use of the
national parks, etc. I think this is
a far more efficient proposal
than jail sentences. Why not take
the privileges of being a citizen
away from those not registering?
But, knowing my colleagues, I
think they will take the easy way
out and institute jail sentences.
Daily: Do you think most stu
dents will register?
McCloskey: Reasonable people
will not refuse to register. Tins
(refusing to register) is a hollow
glory. However, I can under
stand resisting the dratt. I don t
think the principle behind regist
ration is all that clear.
Daily: You were quoted as saying
last year that an army of reluctant
conscripts would bring with them
a reluctance to fight which would
do more to prevent our involve
ment in future conflicts. Does this
reasoning apply to Carter's
reinstitution of the draft?
McCloskey: With my military
experience, I feel familiar with
the military mind. 1 would much
rather have a citizen army made
up ot men and women from all
walks of life than an army of pro
fessional soldiers. The people
who get killed in wars are the IN
and 19 year-olds. I would rather
have a cross-section of students
in the army than people who
want to be there. It's like people
who want to be policemen be
cause they want to carry a gun.
Fhey are perhaps more likely to
head into conflict than more re
luctant conscripts.
