# America's all-volunteer forces in review
## Defense secretary reports problems in retention, reserve 
### Jimmy Glanzer Joan O'Connell 
By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy
Carter has indicated that the cur
rently all-volunteer forces are in
sufficient to meet national milit
ary demands.
Allegations of racial imba
lance and discrimination, high
drug use. and a widespread lack
of morale and quality in the
All-Volunteer Force (AVF)
have beset the armed services in
the past few years. Arguments in
favor of a return to the draft have
brought these charges to the
forefront in political debate.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), a critic of the
AVF. has called the forces in
adequate and told a group here
on Feb. 10. that many sen ice
men can barely read at a ninth
grade level. McCloskey said he
favors a draft, not to increase the
size of the armed forces, but be
cause "it's a question of restoring
the quality of the Army."
However, as Stanford Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
has said. "The quality of the Un
ited States Army is a matter of
great debate. The secretary of
the Army. Clifford Alexander, is
against the (proposed) draft be
cause he says the all-volunteer
force is working."
Martin Anderson, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
concurred. People like McClos
key. Anderson added, "believe
every young man has a patriotic
duty to sign up although they
can't explain why."
Nevertheless, Marshall noted
that "many people who don't
have an axe to grind say the AVF
is in bad shape."
Manpower and Cost
In the Department of Defense
(DOD) annual report for the
1980 fiscal year. Secretary of
Defense Harold Brown stated:
"The overriding Defense man
power objective is to increase the
combat-effectiveness of the
Armed Forces. In that effort, the
most important factor, often
taken for granted in discussions
of sophisticated equipment, is at
tracting and retaining capable,
motivated people — the soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines who

comprise our forces and the civi
lians who maintain and support
our forces."
Since Jan. 2. 1973. when the
draft ended and the AVF was
installed, some 2,850.000 per
sons have entered one or another
of the active or reserve forces as
officers or as enlisted personnel,
according to the DOD report.
In 1979, the DOD employed a
"total force" of approximately 2
million active duty personnel. 1
million civilians and a ho u t
cSOO.OOO resets ists. In addition to
the total force's expenses, there
are approximately 1.3 million
military retirees receiving pen
sions out of the budget. The cost
of paying these 5 million people
for c>ast and present service was
$63.7 billion in 1979. or 55 per
cent of the defense budget.
The manpower cost figures are
often cited in the dispute over
whether the AVF costs too
much. Brown reported in the
1479 DOD report that a cost
comparison of the draft and the
AVF by the DOD'sGeneral Ac
counting Office shows that a re
turn to the draft would not. by
itself, save money. "If you be
lieve payments (salaries) should
be comparable to private sector
payments." Brown wrote, "the
annual savings would be $500
million" which is less than one
half of one percent of the total
defense budget.
In fact, in a report by jour
nalist David Boorstin in 1975,
the author noted that if junior
enlistment pay were reduced, the
DOD could save $1.5 to $3 bill
ion. depending on congressional
guidelines. Boorstin claimed
manpower costs grew from 43
percent of the defense budget in
1964 to 55 percent in 1975. This,
however, resulted from increases
in retirement and civilian pay, as
Brown has indicated. Further
more, a return to the draft would
not affect pay increases of milit
ary careerists.
In terms of manpower, accord
ing to Brown, the most serious
problem lacing the AVF is reten
tion of recruits.
"Only a small fraction of the
recruits complete their initial
six-year contract and many are
gone within the first year." the
report says.
Brown reported that "mem

hers who joined the AVI in the
early years are re-enlisting at a
satisfactory rate (but that) reen
listment of service members with
seven to 10 years of service is
declining." The downward trend
in second term reenlistments is
particularly serious in the Navy.
To combat this. Brown outlined
various economic incentives in
cluding reenlistment bonuses
and better educational oppor
tunities for enlisted personnel.
Recruitment and quality
In regard to the quality of the
current AVF, Brown claimed
that in the past year, the Army.
Navy and Marine Corps have all
accepted recruiting shortfalls in
order to maintain the highest
percentage of high school
graduates within the services
since AVF's inception in 1973.
The DOD report contains a
table citing statistics gleaned
from the Armed Forces Ap
titude Oualitying Test (AFQT)
which was formerly the sole en
listment eligibility criterion.
The AFOT divides individuals
into five "mental groups" rang
ing from Category 1 — those
who score highest on the test —
to Category 5. those posting the
lowest scores.

While persons in Category 5
are prohibited by law from serv
ing in the military, the ad\isabil
it\ of accepting persons with
Category 4 status is subject to
debate. Reports indicate that in
recent years the biggest recruit
ment of Category 4 persons was
in 1972. when manpower was
needed during the Vietnam War.
"There was some question
about whether they (persons
with Category 4 status) were
trainable, whether they could do
army work." said Maryann
Knight, a graduate student in
political science here who taught
in a high school-level program
for troops in an army base in
Germany during the Vietnam
War. "My impression was that
they couldn't," she said.
In fact, according to Knight,
the term "CAT 4" came.to be
synonymous with stupidity
around the army bases. "Nearly
all of them were illiterate, had
not finished high school: they
were semi-trainable," she said.
The DOD report points to the
decline in Category 4 personnel
since 1972 and concludes, "the
active forces are obtaining enlis
tees with the mental abilities to
meet force requirements."
However. Clarissa Eastham, a

Stanford student who is a candi
date tor Navy ensign when she
completes school, said she feels
"the standards are way too low
lor geting into the Army. You
wouldn't believe how excited
they were in having someone
with an education."
Brown claims in his report,
however, that mental and physi
cal standards are currently more
difficult for both enlistments and
reenlistments. More difficult, he
asserted, than they were during
either the draft or the Vietnam
War. The DOD report maintains
that at all times since the draft
ended, it has "consistently" met
strength targets while maintain
ing high standards.
In terms of numerical
strength, the AVF must contend
with the decline in the number of
service-eligible males. By 19K5.
the number of 18 year olds in the
general population will drop to
S5 percent of their number in
1 977. Brown has argued that in
creasing competition for jobs in
the private sector may brighten
recruitment prospects, or at least
buffer any shortfalls. The DOD
estimates that the labor pool will
increase 20 percent by 1990.
Knight said the two groups of
people the services have the
most trouble recruiting and re
taining are the highly specialized
technicians who could easily find
jobs in industry, and the basic
army infantrymen.
"While the infantry does ter
ribly unpleasant things in time of
war. it does incredibly boring
things — like painting rocks — in
time ot peace." she observed.
Knight also mentioned the fact
that infantrymen generally re
ceive little specialized training
and that if a career infantryman
retires after 20 years of active
service, he will enter the job


Fiscal year
market with virtually no skills.
Boorstin's 1975 report noted
that the quality of the armed
forces is ultimately measured by
"combat-readiness." In 1974, he
noted, the Department of the
Army reported that all 13 of its
divisions were combat-ready.
This had not always been the
case during the Vietnam War,
according to Boorstin.
The Reserves
An area of major concern in
the AVI is the state of the milit
ary's reserve forces.
According to Brown, the suc
cess of today's total force is
"heavily dependent on the rapid
mobilization and deployment of
reserves to light in a major,
high-intensity, conventional war
in Europe."
In 1979, Pentagon officials re
ported that the army counts on
reser\es to pro\ ide 45 percent ot
"quick reaction" manpower,
while the Navy, Air Force and
Marines reserves will provide
about 15 to 20 percent. As of
June 1979, the nation had ap
proximately 1.15 million re
serves who could be called to ac
tive duty, a figure 600.000 short
of the minimum number needed
in the event of a war. according
to figures cited in U.S. News and
World Report.
The article attributes this in
sufficient reserve roster or
"manpower crisis'" within the re
serves to two developments:
I irst. under \ oluntary recruiting,
young men are no longer signing
up for the reserves to escape the
draft, and secondly, the armed
forces have shrunk from a Viet
nam war peak of 3.5 million en
listed personnel, to two million
volunteers in active service, thus
lowering the number of \ eterans
in position to join the Individual
Ready Reserve Units.
"Maintaining personnel le\el
in the reserve force-continues to
be the most difficult problem we
are experiencing in ensuring re
serve readiness." the I 9KO DOD
report states.
In addressing this problem,
the department has im
plemented programs involving
reenlistment bonuses, recruiting
assistance and other training
programs.
Racial imbalance
The armed forces have experi
enced a great increase in both the
number of blacks volunteering
for the military and also higher
than average rates for reenlist
ment among black personnel.
The Army has historically had
the highest number of blacks and
the Navy the lowest, according to
the DC)I) report.
The proportion of blacks cur
rently enlisted has risen from I
percent in 196 1 ) to 18 percent in
1977. and increases have also
occurred in the proportion ot
black officers.
The percentage of all active
duty officers who are black more
than doubled between 1964
when it was 1.7 percent and 1977
when it was 4 percent.
Marshall feels this is particu
larly attributable to the fact that
the AVF can be thought of as an
"upward mobility track for poor,
ghetto blacks." indeed, recruit
ment has been best during reces
sion years like 1973-1975, ac
cording to most reports.
Knight observed during her
stay in Germany that a good
proportion ot the blacks were re
legated to "warehouse-type"
jobs because ol their generally
limited education. Hiese men
seldom got the opportunity to
move into more highly
specialized or technical posi
tions. Knight said.
"There is an enormous
amount of discrimination in the

Army against blacks — the ques
tion is where is starts," she said.
A lot of it starts among the offic
ers. For instance, they like to
have college-educated people
for clerks, so those are the ones
they pull out (of the enlisted per
sonnel ranks)." Very lew-blacks
in the Army are college
educated. she observed.
"I guess the Army is really no
more racist than the rest of soci
ety. although I'd say it was more
integrated." Knight said.
Drujj Use
One i)l the most sensitive
areas in discussions of the AVI is
the degree of drug use by milit
ary personnel. In January o!
I ( >75. A Study of Department of
Defense Drug Ahitse Prevention
and Control Programs was pub
lished by an independent grou>
working in cooperation with the
DOD. "
The report concluded from the
collected, self-reported data of
12.000 service members that
marijuana was being used by 3N
percent ol the armed services.
This average was then broken
down and analyzed, revealing
the following statistics:
In all categories ol drug use,
the Air Force consistently
showed the lowest degree of par
ticipation.
— Use of hard drugs, such as
hallucinogens, amphetamines
and barbiturates, was most often
confined to less than 15 percent
of the serv ice. However, 25 pe
cent of the Marine Corps per
sonnel responding to the study,
reported use of amphetamines.
— On-the-job use of drugs
was halved in almost all
categories. Collectively, 16 per
cent ol respondents reported
on-the-job use of marijuana.
The report reached the con
clusion that most drug use in the
services is by persons aged 21
and under. In the services as a
whole these people include 63 to
73 percent of those who have
tried any given drug.
In addition, high school
drop-outs were disproportion
ately represented among armed
forces drug users. Also, the
majority ol current drug users,
about 65 percent, were users be
fore entering the armed serv ices.
Although drug use varies by
location — the bases in the
Pacific reported the greatest
number of drug users — it ap
peared to the authors of the re
port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine
Corps lias the highest desertion
rate with 4.7 desertions per 100
recruits. The Air Force ranks
lowest in this category.
In 1964, Boorstin cited, there
were less than two desertions per
1 00 enlisted Marines. During the
Vietnam conflict this rate
skyrocketed to 6.53 desertions
per 100 enlisted men. All ser
vice's have shown improvement
since the war's end. although the
desertion rates are not as low as
they were in 1964. The only ex
ception to these improvements
has been "an alarming increase"
in the number of those Absent
Without Official Leave
(AWOL) in the Navy, according
to the Defense Secretary's 1979
report.
"The Chief of Naval Opera
tions has recently identified as
one of his principal objectives, a
radical reduction in the inci
dence of unauthorized absence,
of which the desertion rate is the
most dramatic and serious indi
cator." the I9NO Defense report
concludes.

By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy
Carter has indicated that the cur
rently all-volunteer forces are in
sufficient to meet national milit
ary demands.
Allegations of racial imba
lance and discrimination, high
drug use. and a widespread lack
of morale and quality in the

since the war's end. although the
desertion rates are not as low as
they were in 1964. The only ex
ception to these improvements
has been "an alarming increase"
in the number of those Absent
Without Official Leave
(AWOL) in the Navy, according
to the Defense Secretary's 1979
report.
"The Chief of Naval Opera
tions has recently identified as
one of his principal objectives, a
radical reduction in the inci
dence of unauthorized absence,
of which the desertion rate is the
most dramatic and serious indi
cator." the I9NO Defense report
concludes.

By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy
Carter has indicated that the cur
rently all-volunteer forces are in
sufficient to meet national milit
ary demands.
Allegations of racial imba
lance and discrimination, high
drug use. and a widespread lack
of morale and quality in the
All-Volunteer Force (AVF)
have beset the armed services in
the past few years. Arguments in
favor of a return to the draft have
brought these charges to the
forefront in political debate.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), a critic of the
AVF. has called the forces in
adequate and told a group here
on Feb. 10. that many sen ice
men can barely read at a ninth
grade level. McCloskey said he
favors a draft, not to increase the
size of the armed forces, but be
cause "it's a question of restoring
the quality of the Army."
However, as Stanford Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
has said. "The quality of the Un
ited States Army is a matter of
great debate. The secretary of
the Army. Clifford Alexander, is
against the (proposed) draft be
cause he says the all-volunteer
force is working."
Martin Anderson, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
concurred. People like McClos
key. Anderson added, "believe
every young man has a patriotic
duty to sign up although they
can't explain why."
Nevertheless, Marshall noted
that "many people who don't
have an axe to grind say the AVF
is in bad shape."
Manpower and Cost
In the Department of Defense
(DOD) annual report for the
1980 fiscal year. Secretary of
Defense Harold Brown stated:
"The overriding Defense man
power objective is to increase the
combat-effectiveness of the
Armed Forces. In that effort, the
most important factor, often
taken for granted in discussions
of sophisticated equipment, is at
tracting and retaining capable,
motivated people — the soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines who

comprise our forces and the civi
lians who maintain and support
our forces."
Since Jan. 2. 1973. when the
draft ended and the AVF was
installed, some 2,850.000 per
sons have entered one or another
of the active or reserve forces as
officers or as enlisted personnel,
according to the DOD report.
In 1979, the DOD employed a
"total force" of approximately 2
million active duty personnel. 1
million civilians and a ho u t
cSOO.OOO resets ists. In addition to
the total force's expenses, there
are approximately 1.3 million
military retirees receiving pen
sions out of the budget. The cost
of paying these 5 million people
for c>ast and present service was
$63.7 billion in 1979. or 55 per
cent of the defense budget.
The manpower cost figures are
often cited in the dispute over
whether the AVF costs too
much. Brown reported in the
1479 DOD report that a cost
comparison of the draft and the
AVF by the DOD'sGeneral Ac
counting Office shows that a re
turn to the draft would not. by
itself, save money. "If you be
lieve payments (salaries) should
be comparable to private sector
payments." Brown wrote, "the
annual savings would be $500
million" which is less than one
half of one percent of the total
defense budget.
In fact, in a report by jour
nalist David Boorstin in 1975,
the author noted that if junior
enlistment pay were reduced, the
DOD could save $1.5 to $3 bill
ion. depending on congressional
guidelines. Boorstin claimed
manpower costs grew from 43
percent of the defense budget in
1964 to 55 percent in 1975. This,
however, resulted from increases
in retirement and civilian pay, as
Brown has indicated. Further
more, a return to the draft would
not affect pay increases of milit
ary careerists.
In terms of manpower, accord
ing to Brown, the most serious
problem lacing the AVF is reten
tion of recruits.
"Only a small fraction of the
recruits complete their initial
six-year contract and many are
gone within the first year." the
report says.
Brown reported that "mem

hers who joined the AVI in the
early years are re-enlisting at a
satisfactory rate (but that) reen
listment of service members with
seven to 10 years of service is
declining." The downward trend
in second term reenlistments is
particularly serious in the Navy.
To combat this. Brown outlined
various economic incentives in
cluding reenlistment bonuses
and better educational oppor
tunities for enlisted personnel.
Recruitment and quality
In regard to the quality of the
current AVF, Brown claimed
that in the past year, the Army.
Navy and Marine Corps have all
accepted recruiting shortfalls in
order to maintain the highest
percentage of high school
graduates within the services
since AVF's inception in 1973.
The DOD report contains a
table citing statistics gleaned
from the Armed Forces Ap
titude Oualitying Test (AFQT)
which was formerly the sole en
listment eligibility criterion.
The AFOT divides individuals
into five "mental groups" rang
ing from Category 1 — those
who score highest on the test —
to Category 5. those posting the
lowest scores.

While persons in Category 5
are prohibited by law from serv
ing in the military, the ad\isabil
it\ of accepting persons with
Category 4 status is subject to
debate. Reports indicate that in
recent years the biggest recruit
ment of Category 4 persons was
in 1972. when manpower was
needed during the Vietnam War.
"There was some question
about whether they (persons
with Category 4 status) were
trainable, whether they could do
army work." said Maryann
Knight, a graduate student in
political science here who taught
in a high school-level program
for troops in an army base in
Germany during the Vietnam
War. "My impression was that
they couldn't," she said.
In fact, according to Knight,
the term "CAT 4" came.to be
synonymous with stupidity
around the army bases. "Nearly
all of them were illiterate, had
not finished high school: they
were semi-trainable," she said.
The DOD report points to the
decline in Category 4 personnel
since 1972 and concludes, "the
active forces are obtaining enlis
tees with the mental abilities to
meet force requirements."
However. Clarissa Eastham, a

Stanford student who is a candi
date tor Navy ensign when she
completes school, said she feels
"the standards are way too low
lor geting into the Army. You
wouldn't believe how excited
they were in having someone
with an education."
Brown claims in his report,
however, that mental and physi
cal standards are currently more
difficult for both enlistments and
reenlistments. More difficult, he
asserted, than they were during
either the draft or the Vietnam
War. The DOD report maintains
that at all times since the draft
ended, it has "consistently" met
strength targets while maintain
ing high standards.
In terms of numerical
strength, the AVF must contend
with the decline in the number of
service-eligible males. By 19K5.
the number of 18 year olds in the
general population will drop to
S5 percent of their number in
1 977. Brown has argued that in
creasing competition for jobs in
the private sector may brighten
recruitment prospects, or at least
buffer any shortfalls. The DOD
estimates that the labor pool will
increase 20 percent by 1990.
Knight said the two groups of
people the services have the
most trouble recruiting and re
taining are the highly specialized
technicians who could easily find
jobs in industry, and the basic
army infantrymen.
"While the infantry does ter
ribly unpleasant things in time of
war. it does incredibly boring
things — like painting rocks — in
time ot peace." she observed.
Knight also mentioned the fact
that infantrymen generally re
ceive little specialized training
and that if a career infantryman
retires after 20 years of active
service, he will enter the job


Fiscal year
market with virtually no skills.
Boorstin's 1975 report noted
that the quality of the armed
forces is ultimately measured by
"combat-readiness." In 1974, he
noted, the Department of the
Army reported that all 13 of its
divisions were combat-ready.
This had not always been the
case during the Vietnam War,
according to Boorstin.
The Reserves
An area of major concern in
the AVI is the state of the milit
ary's reserve forces.
According to Brown, the suc
cess of today's total force is
"heavily dependent on the rapid
mobilization and deployment of
reserves to light in a major,
high-intensity, conventional war
in Europe."
In 1979, Pentagon officials re
ported that the army counts on
reser\es to pro\ ide 45 percent ot
"quick reaction" manpower,
while the Navy, Air Force and
Marines reserves will provide
about 15 to 20 percent. As of
June 1979, the nation had ap
proximately 1.15 million re
serves who could be called to ac
tive duty, a figure 600.000 short
of the minimum number needed
in the event of a war. according
to figures cited in U.S. News and
World Report.
The article attributes this in
sufficient reserve roster or
"manpower crisis'" within the re
serves to two developments:
I irst. under \ oluntary recruiting,
young men are no longer signing
up for the reserves to escape the
draft, and secondly, the armed
forces have shrunk from a Viet
nam war peak of 3.5 million en
listed personnel, to two million
volunteers in active service, thus
lowering the number of \ eterans
in position to join the Individual
Ready Reserve Units.
"Maintaining personnel le\el
in the reserve force-continues to
be the most difficult problem we
are experiencing in ensuring re
serve readiness." the I 9KO DOD
report states.
In addressing this problem,
the department has im
plemented programs involving
reenlistment bonuses, recruiting
assistance and other training
programs.
Racial imbalance
The armed forces have experi
enced a great increase in both the
number of blacks volunteering
for the military and also higher
than average rates for reenlist
ment among black personnel.
The Army has historically had
the highest number of blacks and
the Navy the lowest, according to
the DC)I) report.
The proportion of blacks cur
rently enlisted has risen from I
percent in 196 1 ) to 18 percent in
1977. and increases have also
occurred in the proportion ot
black officers.
The percentage of all active
duty officers who are black more
than doubled between 1964
when it was 1.7 percent and 1977
when it was 4 percent.
Marshall feels this is particu
larly attributable to the fact that
the AVF can be thought of as an
"upward mobility track for poor,
ghetto blacks." indeed, recruit
ment has been best during reces
sion years like 1973-1975, ac
cording to most reports.
Knight observed during her
stay in Germany that a good
proportion ot the blacks were re
legated to "warehouse-type"
jobs because ol their generally
limited education. Hiese men
seldom got the opportunity to
move into more highly
specialized or technical posi
tions. Knight said.
"There is an enormous
amount of discrimination in the

Army against blacks — the ques
tion is where is starts," she said.
A lot of it starts among the offic
ers. For instance, they like to
have college-educated people
for clerks, so those are the ones
they pull out (of the enlisted per
sonnel ranks)." Very lew-blacks
in the Army are college
educated. she observed.
"I guess the Army is really no
more racist than the rest of soci
ety. although I'd say it was more
integrated." Knight said.
Drujj Use
One i)l the most sensitive
areas in discussions of the AVI is
the degree of drug use by milit
ary personnel. In January o!
I ( >75. A Study of Department of
Defense Drug Ahitse Prevention
and Control Programs was pub
lished by an independent grou>
working in cooperation with the
DOD. "
The report concluded from the
collected, self-reported data of
12.000 service members that
marijuana was being used by 3N
percent ol the armed services.
This average was then broken
down and analyzed, revealing
the following statistics:
In all categories ol drug use,
the Air Force consistently
showed the lowest degree of par
ticipation.
— Use of hard drugs, such as
hallucinogens, amphetamines
and barbiturates, was most often
confined to less than 15 percent
of the serv ice. However, 25 pe
cent of the Marine Corps per
sonnel responding to the study,
reported use of amphetamines.
— On-the-job use of drugs
was halved in almost all
categories. Collectively, 16 per
cent ol respondents reported
on-the-job use of marijuana.
The report reached the con
clusion that most drug use in the
services is by persons aged 21
and under. In the services as a
whole these people include 63 to
73 percent of those who have
tried any given drug.
In addition, high school
drop-outs were disproportion
ately represented among armed
forces drug users. Also, the
majority ol current drug users,
about 65 percent, were users be
fore entering the armed serv ices.
Although drug use varies by
location — the bases in the
Pacific reported the greatest
number of drug users — it ap
peared to the authors of the re
port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine
Corps lias the highest desertion
rate with 4.7 desertions per 100
recruits. The Air Force ranks
lowest in this category.
In 1964, Boorstin cited, there
were less than two desertions per
1 00 enlisted Marines. During the
Vietnam conflict this rate
skyrocketed to 6.53 desertions
per 100 enlisted men. All ser
vice's have shown improvement
since the war's end. although the
desertion rates are not as low as
they were in 1964. The only ex
ception to these improvements
has been "an alarming increase"
in the number of those Absent
Without Official Leave
(AWOL) in the Navy, according
to the Defense Secretary's 1979
report.
"The Chief of Naval Opera
tions has recently identified as
one of his principal objectives, a
radical reduction in the inci
dence of unauthorized absence,
of which the desertion rate is the
most dramatic and serious indi
cator." the I9NO Defense report
concludes.

By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy

rently all-volunteer forces are in

timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine
Corps lias the highest desertion
rate with 4.7 desertions per 100
recruits. The Air Force ranks
lowest in this category.
In 1964, Boorstin cited, there
were less than two desertions per
1 00 enlisted Marines. During the
Vietnam conflict this rate
skyrocketed to 6.53 desertions
per 100 enlisted men. All ser
vice's have shown improvement
since the war's end. although the
desertion rates are not as low as
they were in 1964. The only ex
ception to these improvements
has been "an alarming increase"
in the number of those Absent
Without Official Leave
(AWOL) in the Navy, according
to the Defense Secretary's 1979
report.
"The Chief of Naval Opera
tions has recently identified as
one of his principal objectives, a
radical reduction in the inci
dence of unauthorized absence,
of which the desertion rate is the
most dramatic and serious indi
cator." the I9NO Defense report
concludes.

By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy
Carter has indicated that the cur
rently all-volunteer forces are in
sufficient to meet national milit
ary demands.
Allegations of racial imba
lance and discrimination, high
drug use. and a widespread lack
of morale and quality in the
All-Volunteer Force (AVF)
have beset the armed services in
the past few years. Arguments in
favor of a return to the draft have
brought these charges to the
forefront in political debate.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), a critic of the
AVF. has called the forces in
adequate and told a group here
on Feb. 10. that many sen ice
men can barely read at a ninth
grade level. McCloskey said he
favors a draft, not to increase the
size of the armed forces, but be
cause "it's a question of restoring
the quality of the Army."
However, as Stanford Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
has said. "The quality of the Un
ited States Army is a matter of
great debate. The secretary of
the Army. Clifford Alexander, is
against the (proposed) draft be
cause he says the all-volunteer
force is working."
Martin Anderson, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
concurred. People like McClos
key. Anderson added, "believe
every young man has a patriotic
duty to sign up although they
can't explain why."
Nevertheless, Marshall noted
that "many people who don't
have an axe to grind say the AVF
is in bad shape."
Manpower and Cost
In the Department of Defense
(DOD) annual report for the
1980 fiscal year. Secretary of
Defense Harold Brown stated:
"The overriding Defense man
power objective is to increase the
combat-effectiveness of the
Armed Forces. In that effort, the
most important factor, often
taken for granted in discussions
of sophisticated equipment, is at
tracting and retaining capable,
motivated people — the soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines who

comprise our forces and the civi
lians who maintain and support
our forces."
Since Jan. 2. 1973. when the
draft ended and the AVF was
installed, some 2,850.000 per
sons have entered one or another
of the active or reserve forces as
officers or as enlisted personnel,
according to the DOD report.
In 1979, the DOD employed a
"total force" of approximately 2
million active duty personnel. 1
million civilians and a ho u t
cSOO.OOO resets ists. In addition to
the total force's expenses, there
are approximately 1.3 million
military retirees receiving pen
sions out of the budget. The cost
of paying these 5 million people
for c>ast and present service was
$63.7 billion in 1979. or 55 per
cent of the defense budget.
The manpower cost figures are
often cited in the dispute over
whether the AVF costs too
much. Brown reported in the
1479 DOD report that a cost
comparison of the draft and the
AVF by the DOD'sGeneral Ac
counting Office shows that a re
turn to the draft would not. by
itself, save money. "If you be
lieve payments (salaries) should
be comparable to private sector
payments." Brown wrote, "the
annual savings would be $500
million" which is less than one
half of one percent of the total
defense budget.
In fact, in a report by jour
nalist David Boorstin in 1975,
the author noted that if junior
enlistment pay were reduced, the
DOD could save $1.5 to $3 bill
ion. depending on congressional
guidelines. Boorstin claimed
manpower costs grew from 43
percent of the defense budget in
1964 to 55 percent in 1975. This,
however, resulted from increases
in retirement and civilian pay, as
Brown has indicated. Further
more, a return to the draft would
not affect pay increases of milit
ary careerists.
In terms of manpower, accord
ing to Brown, the most serious
problem lacing the AVF is reten
tion of recruits.
"Only a small fraction of the
recruits complete their initial
six-year contract and many are
gone within the first year." the
report says.
Brown reported that "mem

hers who joined the AVI in the
early years are re-enlisting at a
satisfactory rate (but that) reen
listment of service members with
seven to 10 years of service is
declining." The downward trend
in second term reenlistments is
particularly serious in the Navy.
To combat this. Brown outlined
various economic incentives in
cluding reenlistment bonuses
and better educational oppor
tunities for enlisted personnel.
Recruitment and quality
In regard to the quality of the
current AVF, Brown claimed
that in the past year, the Army.
Navy and Marine Corps have all
accepted recruiting shortfalls in
order to maintain the highest
percentage of high school
graduates within the services
since AVF's inception in 1973.
The DOD report contains a
table citing statistics gleaned
from the Armed Forces Ap
titude Oualitying Test (AFQT)
which was formerly the sole en
listment eligibility criterion.
The AFOT divides individuals
into five "mental groups" rang
ing from Category 1 — those
who score highest on the test —
to Category 5. those posting the
lowest scores.

While persons in Category 5
are prohibited by law from serv
ing in the military, the ad\isabil
it\ of accepting persons with
Category 4 status is subject to
debate. Reports indicate that in
recent years the biggest recruit
ment of Category 4 persons was
in 1972. when manpower was
needed during the Vietnam War.
"There was some question
about whether they (persons
with Category 4 status) were
trainable, whether they could do
army work." said Maryann
Knight, a graduate student in
political science here who taught
in a high school-level program
for troops in an army base in
Germany during the Vietnam
War. "My impression was that
they couldn't," she said.
In fact, according to Knight,
the term "CAT 4" came.to be
synonymous with stupidity
around the army bases. "Nearly
all of them were illiterate, had
not finished high school: they
were semi-trainable," she said.
The DOD report points to the
decline in Category 4 personnel
since 1972 and concludes, "the
active forces are obtaining enlis
tees with the mental abilities to
meet force requirements."
However. Clarissa Eastham, a

Stanford student who is a candi
date tor Navy ensign when she
completes school, said she feels
"the standards are way too low
lor geting into the Army. You
wouldn't believe how excited
they were in having someone
with an education."
Brown claims in his report,
however, that mental and physi
cal standards are currently more
difficult for both enlistments and
reenlistments. More difficult, he
asserted, than they were during
either the draft or the Vietnam
War. The DOD report maintains
that at all times since the draft
ended, it has "consistently" met
strength targets while maintain
ing high standards.
In terms of numerical
strength, the AVF must contend
with the decline in the number of
service-eligible males. By 19K5.
the number of 18 year olds in the
general population will drop to
S5 percent of their number in
1 977. Brown has argued that in
creasing competition for jobs in
the private sector may brighten
recruitment prospects, or at least
buffer any shortfalls. The DOD
estimates that the labor pool will
increase 20 percent by 1990.
Knight said the two groups of
people the services have the
most trouble recruiting and re
taining are the highly specialized
technicians who could easily find
jobs in industry, and the basic
army infantrymen.
"While the infantry does ter
ribly unpleasant things in time of
war. it does incredibly boring
things — like painting rocks — in
time ot peace." she observed.
Knight also mentioned the fact
that infantrymen generally re
ceive little specialized training
and that if a career infantryman
retires after 20 years of active
service, he will enter the job


Fiscal year
market with virtually no skills.
Boorstin's 1975 report noted
that the quality of the armed
forces is ultimately measured by
"combat-readiness." In 1974, he
noted, the Department of the
Army reported that all 13 of its
divisions were combat-ready.
This had not always been the
case during the Vietnam War,
according to Boorstin.
The Reserves
An area of major concern in
the AVI is the state of the milit
ary's reserve forces.
According to Brown, the suc
cess of today's total force is
"heavily dependent on the rapid
mobilization and deployment of
reserves to light in a major,
high-intensity, conventional war
in Europe."
In 1979, Pentagon officials re
ported that the army counts on
reser\es to pro\ ide 45 percent ot
"quick reaction" manpower,
while the Navy, Air Force and
Marines reserves will provide
about 15 to 20 percent. As of
June 1979, the nation had ap
proximately 1.15 million re
serves who could be called to ac
tive duty, a figure 600.000 short
of the minimum number needed
in the event of a war. according
to figures cited in U.S. News and
World Report.
The article attributes this in
sufficient reserve roster or
"manpower crisis'" within the re
serves to two developments:
I irst. under \ oluntary recruiting,
young men are no longer signing
up for the reserves to escape the
draft, and secondly, the armed
forces have shrunk from a Viet
nam war peak of 3.5 million en
listed personnel, to two million
volunteers in active service, thus
lowering the number of \ eterans
in position to join the Individual
Ready Reserve Units.
"Maintaining personnel le\el
in the reserve force-continues to
be the most difficult problem we
are experiencing in ensuring re
serve readiness." the I 9KO DOD
report states.
In addressing this problem,
the department has im
plemented programs involving
reenlistment bonuses, recruiting
assistance and other training
programs.
Racial imbalance
The armed forces have experi
enced a great increase in both the
number of blacks volunteering
for the military and also higher
than average rates for reenlist
ment among black personnel.
The Army has historically had
the highest number of blacks and
the Navy the lowest, according to
the DC)I) report.
The proportion of blacks cur
rently enlisted has risen from I
percent in 196 1 ) to 18 percent in
1977. and increases have also
occurred in the proportion ot
black officers.
The percentage of all active
duty officers who are black more
than doubled between 1964
when it was 1.7 percent and 1977
when it was 4 percent.
Marshall feels this is particu
larly attributable to the fact that
the AVF can be thought of as an
"upward mobility track for poor,
ghetto blacks." indeed, recruit
ment has been best during reces
sion years like 1973-1975, ac
cording to most reports.
Knight observed during her
stay in Germany that a good
proportion ot the blacks were re
legated to "warehouse-type"
jobs because ol their generally
limited education. Hiese men
seldom got the opportunity to
move into more highly
specialized or technical posi
tions. Knight said.
"There is an enormous
amount of discrimination in the

Army against blacks — the ques
tion is where is starts," she said.
A lot of it starts among the offic
ers. For instance, they like to
have college-educated people
for clerks, so those are the ones
they pull out (of the enlisted per
sonnel ranks)." Very lew-blacks
in the Army are college
educated. she observed.
"I guess the Army is really no
more racist than the rest of soci
ety. although I'd say it was more
integrated." Knight said.
Drujj Use
One i)l the most sensitive
areas in discussions of the AVI is
the degree of drug use by milit
ary personnel. In January o!
I ( >75. A Study of Department of
Defense Drug Ahitse Prevention
and Control Programs was pub
lished by an independent grou>
working in cooperation with the
DOD. "
The report concluded from the
collected, self-reported data of
12.000 service members that
marijuana was being used by 3N
percent ol the armed services.
This average was then broken
down and analyzed, revealing
the following statistics:
In all categories ol drug use,
the Air Force consistently
showed the lowest degree of par
ticipation.
— Use of hard drugs, such as
hallucinogens, amphetamines
and barbiturates, was most often
confined to less than 15 percent
of the serv ice. However, 25 pe
cent of the Marine Corps per
sonnel responding to the study,
reported use of amphetamines.
— On-the-job use of drugs
was halved in almost all
categories. Collectively, 16 per
cent ol respondents reported
on-the-job use of marijuana.
The report reached the con
clusion that most drug use in the
services is by persons aged 21
and under. In the services as a
whole these people include 63 to
73 percent of those who have
tried any given drug.
In addition, high school
drop-outs were disproportion
ately represented among armed
forces drug users. Also, the
majority ol current drug users,
about 65 percent, were users be
fore entering the armed serv ices.
Although drug use varies by
location — the bases in the
Pacific reported the greatest
number of drug users — it ap
peared to the authors of the re
port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine

rate with 4.7 desertions per 100

port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine
Corps lias the highest desertion
rate with 4.7 desertions per 100
recruits. The Air Force ranks
lowest in this category.
In 1964, Boorstin cited, there
were less than two desertions per
1 00 enlisted Marines. During the
Vietnam conflict this rate
skyrocketed to 6.53 desertions
per 100 enlisted men. All ser
vice's have shown improvement
since the war's end. although the
desertion rates are not as low as
they were in 1964. The only ex
ception to these improvements
has been "an alarming increase"
in the number of those Absent
Without Official Leave
(AWOL) in the Navy, according
to the Defense Secretary's 1979
report.
"The Chief of Naval Opera
tions has recently identified as
one of his principal objectives, a
radical reduction in the inci
dence of unauthorized absence,
of which the desertion rate is the
most dramatic and serious indi
cator." the I9NO Defense report
concludes.

By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy
Carter has indicated that the cur
rently all-volunteer forces are in
sufficient to meet national milit
ary demands.
Allegations of racial imba
lance and discrimination, high
drug use. and a widespread lack
of morale and quality in the
All-Volunteer Force (AVF)
have beset the armed services in
the past few years. Arguments in
favor of a return to the draft have
brought these charges to the
forefront in political debate.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), a critic of the
AVF. has called the forces in
adequate and told a group here
on Feb. 10. that many sen ice
men can barely read at a ninth
grade level. McCloskey said he
favors a draft, not to increase the
size of the armed forces, but be
cause "it's a question of restoring
the quality of the Army."
However, as Stanford Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
has said. "The quality of the Un
ited States Army is a matter of
great debate. The secretary of
the Army. Clifford Alexander, is
against the (proposed) draft be
cause he says the all-volunteer
force is working."
Martin Anderson, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
concurred. People like McClos
key. Anderson added, "believe
every young man has a patriotic
duty to sign up although they
can't explain why."
Nevertheless, Marshall noted
that "many people who don't
have an axe to grind say the AVF
is in bad shape."
Manpower and Cost
In the Department of Defense
(DOD) annual report for the
1980 fiscal year. Secretary of
Defense Harold Brown stated:
"The overriding Defense man
power objective is to increase the
combat-effectiveness of the
Armed Forces. In that effort, the
most important factor, often
taken for granted in discussions
of sophisticated equipment, is at
tracting and retaining capable,
motivated people — the soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines who

comprise our forces and the civi
lians who maintain and support
our forces."
Since Jan. 2. 1973. when the
draft ended and the AVF was
installed, some 2,850.000 per
sons have entered one or another
of the active or reserve forces as
officers or as enlisted personnel,
according to the DOD report.
In 1979, the DOD employed a
"total force" of approximately 2
million active duty personnel. 1
million civilians and a ho u t
cSOO.OOO resets ists. In addition to
the total force's expenses, there
are approximately 1.3 million
military retirees receiving pen
sions out of the budget. The cost
of paying these 5 million people
for c>ast and present service was
$63.7 billion in 1979. or 55 per
cent of the defense budget.
The manpower cost figures are
often cited in the dispute over
whether the AVF costs too
much. Brown reported in the
1479 DOD report that a cost
comparison of the draft and the
AVF by the DOD'sGeneral Ac
counting Office shows that a re
turn to the draft would not. by
itself, save money. "If you be
lieve payments (salaries) should
be comparable to private sector
payments." Brown wrote, "the
annual savings would be $500
million" which is less than one
half of one percent of the total
defense budget.
In fact, in a report by jour
nalist David Boorstin in 1975,
the author noted that if junior
enlistment pay were reduced, the
DOD could save $1.5 to $3 bill
ion. depending on congressional
guidelines. Boorstin claimed
manpower costs grew from 43
percent of the defense budget in
1964 to 55 percent in 1975. This,
however, resulted from increases
in retirement and civilian pay, as
Brown has indicated. Further
more, a return to the draft would
not affect pay increases of milit
ary careerists.
In terms of manpower, accord
ing to Brown, the most serious
problem lacing the AVF is reten
tion of recruits.
"Only a small fraction of the
recruits complete their initial
six-year contract and many are
gone within the first year." the
report says.
Brown reported that "mem

hers who joined the AVI in the
early years are re-enlisting at a
satisfactory rate (but that) reen
listment of service members with
seven to 10 years of service is
declining." The downward trend
in second term reenlistments is
particularly serious in the Navy.
To combat this. Brown outlined
various economic incentives in
cluding reenlistment bonuses
and better educational oppor
tunities for enlisted personnel.
Recruitment and quality
In regard to the quality of the
current AVF, Brown claimed
that in the past year, the Army.
Navy and Marine Corps have all
accepted recruiting shortfalls in
order to maintain the highest
percentage of high school
graduates within the services
since AVF's inception in 1973.
The DOD report contains a
table citing statistics gleaned
from the Armed Forces Ap
titude Oualitying Test (AFQT)
which was formerly the sole en
listment eligibility criterion.
The AFOT divides individuals
into five "mental groups" rang
ing from Category 1 — those
who score highest on the test —
to Category 5. those posting the
lowest scores.

While persons in Category 5
are prohibited by law from serv
ing in the military, the ad\isabil
it\ of accepting persons with
Category 4 status is subject to
debate. Reports indicate that in
recent years the biggest recruit
ment of Category 4 persons was
in 1972. when manpower was
needed during the Vietnam War.
"There was some question
about whether they (persons
with Category 4 status) were
trainable, whether they could do
army work." said Maryann
Knight, a graduate student in
political science here who taught
in a high school-level program
for troops in an army base in
Germany during the Vietnam
War. "My impression was that
they couldn't," she said.
In fact, according to Knight,
the term "CAT 4" came.to be
synonymous with stupidity
around the army bases. "Nearly
all of them were illiterate, had
not finished high school: they
were semi-trainable," she said.
The DOD report points to the
decline in Category 4 personnel
since 1972 and concludes, "the
active forces are obtaining enlis
tees with the mental abilities to
meet force requirements."
However. Clarissa Eastham, a

Stanford student who is a candi
date tor Navy ensign when she
completes school, said she feels
"the standards are way too low
lor geting into the Army. You
wouldn't believe how excited
they were in having someone
with an education."
Brown claims in his report,
however, that mental and physi
cal standards are currently more
difficult for both enlistments and
reenlistments. More difficult, he
asserted, than they were during
either the draft or the Vietnam
War. The DOD report maintains
that at all times since the draft
ended, it has "consistently" met
strength targets while maintain
ing high standards.
In terms of numerical
strength, the AVF must contend
with the decline in the number of
service-eligible males. By 19K5.
the number of 18 year olds in the
general population will drop to
S5 percent of their number in
1 977. Brown has argued that in
creasing competition for jobs in
the private sector may brighten
recruitment prospects, or at least
buffer any shortfalls. The DOD
estimates that the labor pool will
increase 20 percent by 1990.
Knight said the two groups of
people the services have the
most trouble recruiting and re
taining are the highly specialized
technicians who could easily find
jobs in industry, and the basic
army infantrymen.
"While the infantry does ter
ribly unpleasant things in time of
war. it does incredibly boring
things — like painting rocks — in
time ot peace." she observed.
Knight also mentioned the fact
that infantrymen generally re
ceive little specialized training
and that if a career infantryman
retires after 20 years of active
service, he will enter the job


Fiscal year
market with virtually no skills.
Boorstin's 1975 report noted
that the quality of the armed
forces is ultimately measured by
"combat-readiness." In 1974, he
noted, the Department of the
Army reported that all 13 of its
divisions were combat-ready.
This had not always been the
case during the Vietnam War,
according to Boorstin.
The Reserves
An area of major concern in
the AVI is the state of the milit
ary's reserve forces.
According to Brown, the suc
cess of today's total force is
"heavily dependent on the rapid
mobilization and deployment of
reserves to light in a major,
high-intensity, conventional war
in Europe."
In 1979, Pentagon officials re
ported that the army counts on
reser\es to pro\ ide 45 percent ot
"quick reaction" manpower,
while the Navy, Air Force and
Marines reserves will provide
about 15 to 20 percent. As of
June 1979, the nation had ap
proximately 1.15 million re
serves who could be called to ac
tive duty, a figure 600.000 short
of the minimum number needed
in the event of a war. according
to figures cited in U.S. News and
World Report.
The article attributes this in
sufficient reserve roster or
"manpower crisis'" within the re
serves to two developments:
I irst. under \ oluntary recruiting,
young men are no longer signing
up for the reserves to escape the
draft, and secondly, the armed
forces have shrunk from a Viet
nam war peak of 3.5 million en
listed personnel, to two million
volunteers in active service, thus
lowering the number of \ eterans
in position to join the Individual
Ready Reserve Units.
"Maintaining personnel le\el
in the reserve force-continues to
be the most difficult problem we
are experiencing in ensuring re
serve readiness." the I 9KO DOD
report states.
In addressing this problem,
the department has im
plemented programs involving
reenlistment bonuses, recruiting
assistance and other training
programs.
Racial imbalance
The armed forces have experi
enced a great increase in both the
number of blacks volunteering
for the military and also higher
than average rates for reenlist
ment among black personnel.
The Army has historically had
the highest number of blacks and
the Navy the lowest, according to
the DC)I) report.
The proportion of blacks cur
rently enlisted has risen from I
percent in 196 1 ) to 18 percent in
1977. and increases have also
occurred in the proportion ot
black officers.
The percentage of all active
duty officers who are black more
than doubled between 1964
when it was 1.7 percent and 1977
when it was 4 percent.
Marshall feels this is particu
larly attributable to the fact that
the AVF can be thought of as an
"upward mobility track for poor,
ghetto blacks." indeed, recruit
ment has been best during reces
sion years like 1973-1975, ac
cording to most reports.
Knight observed during her
stay in Germany that a good
proportion ot the blacks were re
legated to "warehouse-type"
jobs because ol their generally
limited education. Hiese men
seldom got the opportunity to
move into more highly
specialized or technical posi
tions. Knight said.
"There is an enormous
amount of discrimination in the

Army against blacks — the ques
tion is where is starts," she said.
A lot of it starts among the offic
ers. For instance, they like to
have college-educated people
for clerks, so those are the ones
they pull out (of the enlisted per
sonnel ranks)." Very lew-blacks
in the Army are college
educated. she observed.
"I guess the Army is really no
more racist than the rest of soci
ety. although I'd say it was more
integrated." Knight said.
Drujj Use
One i)l the most sensitive
areas in discussions of the AVI is
the degree of drug use by milit
ary personnel. In January o!
I ( >75. A Study of Department of
Defense Drug Ahitse Prevention
and Control Programs was pub
lished by an independent grou>
working in cooperation with the
DOD. "
The report concluded from the
collected, self-reported data of
12.000 service members that
marijuana was being used by 3N
percent ol the armed services.
This average was then broken
down and analyzed, revealing
the following statistics:
In all categories ol drug use,
the Air Force consistently
showed the lowest degree of par
ticipation.
— Use of hard drugs, such as
hallucinogens, amphetamines
and barbiturates, was most often
confined to less than 15 percent
of the serv ice. However, 25 pe
cent of the Marine Corps per
sonnel responding to the study,
reported use of amphetamines.
— On-the-job use of drugs
was halved in almost all
categories. Collectively, 16 per
cent ol respondents reported
on-the-job use of marijuana.
The report reached the con
clusion that most drug use in the
services is by persons aged 21
and under. In the services as a
whole these people include 63 to
73 percent of those who have
tried any given drug.
In addition, high school
drop-outs were disproportion
ately represented among armed
forces drug users. Also, the
majority ol current drug users,
about 65 percent, were users be
fore entering the armed serv ices.
Although drug use varies by
location — the bases in the
Pacific reported the greatest
number of drug users — it ap
peared to the authors of the re
port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.

services is by persons aged 21
and under. In the services as a
whole these people include 63 to
73 percent of those who have
tried any given drug.
In addition, high school
drop-outs were disproportion
ately represented among armed
forces drug users. Also, the
majority ol current drug users,
about 65 percent, were users be
fore entering the armed serv ices.
Although drug use varies by
location — the bases in the
Pacific reported the greatest
number of drug users — it ap
peared to the authors of the re
port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine
Corps lias the highest desertion
rate with 4.7 desertions per 100
recruits. The Air Force ranks
lowest in this category.
In 1964, Boorstin cited, there
were less than two desertions per
1 00 enlisted Marines. During the
Vietnam conflict this rate
skyrocketed to 6.53 desertions
per 100 enlisted men. All ser
vice's have shown improvement
since the war's end. although the
desertion rates are not as low as
they were in 1964. The only ex
ception to these improvements
has been "an alarming increase"
in the number of those Absent
Without Official Leave
(AWOL) in the Navy, according
to the Defense Secretary's 1979
report.
"The Chief of Naval Opera
tions has recently identified as
one of his principal objectives, a
radical reduction in the inci
dence of unauthorized absence,
of which the desertion rate is the
most dramatic and serious indi
cator." the I9NO Defense report
concludes.

By calling for the reinstate
ment of the Selective Service,
many feel that President Jimmy
Carter has indicated that the cur
rently all-volunteer forces are in
sufficient to meet national milit
ary demands.
Allegations of racial imba
lance and discrimination, high
drug use. and a widespread lack
of morale and quality in the
All-Volunteer Force (AVF)
have beset the armed services in
the past few years. Arguments in
favor of a return to the draft have
brought these charges to the
forefront in political debate.
Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park), a critic of the
AVF. has called the forces in
adequate and told a group here
on Feb. 10. that many sen ice
men can barely read at a ninth
grade level. McCloskey said he
favors a draft, not to increase the
size of the armed forces, but be
cause "it's a question of restoring
the quality of the Army."
However, as Stanford Political
Science Prof. Hubert Marshall
has said. "The quality of the Un
ited States Army is a matter of
great debate. The secretary of
the Army. Clifford Alexander, is
against the (proposed) draft be
cause he says the all-volunteer
force is working."
Martin Anderson, senior fel
low at the Hoover Institution,
concurred. People like McClos
key. Anderson added, "believe
every young man has a patriotic
duty to sign up although they
can't explain why."
Nevertheless, Marshall noted
that "many people who don't
have an axe to grind say the AVF
is in bad shape."
Manpower and Cost
In the Department of Defense
(DOD) annual report for the
1980 fiscal year. Secretary of
Defense Harold Brown stated:
"The overriding Defense man
power objective is to increase the
combat-effectiveness of the
Armed Forces. In that effort, the
most important factor, often
taken for granted in discussions
of sophisticated equipment, is at
tracting and retaining capable,
motivated people — the soldiers,
sailors, airmen, and marines who

comprise our forces and the civi
lians who maintain and support
our forces."
Since Jan. 2. 1973. when the
draft ended and the AVF was
installed, some 2,850.000 per
sons have entered one or another
of the active or reserve forces as
officers or as enlisted personnel,
according to the DOD report.
In 1979, the DOD employed a
"total force" of approximately 2
million active duty personnel. 1
million civilians and a ho u t
cSOO.OOO resets ists. In addition to
the total force's expenses, there
are approximately 1.3 million
military retirees receiving pen
sions out of the budget. The cost
of paying these 5 million people
for c>ast and present service was
$63.7 billion in 1979. or 55 per
cent of the defense budget.
The manpower cost figures are
often cited in the dispute over
whether the AVF costs too
much. Brown reported in the
1479 DOD report that a cost
comparison of the draft and the
AVF by the DOD'sGeneral Ac
counting Office shows that a re
turn to the draft would not. by
itself, save money. "If you be
lieve payments (salaries) should
be comparable to private sector
payments." Brown wrote, "the
annual savings would be $500
million" which is less than one
half of one percent of the total
defense budget.
In fact, in a report by jour
nalist David Boorstin in 1975,
the author noted that if junior
enlistment pay were reduced, the
DOD could save $1.5 to $3 bill
ion. depending on congressional
guidelines. Boorstin claimed
manpower costs grew from 43
percent of the defense budget in
1964 to 55 percent in 1975. This,
however, resulted from increases
in retirement and civilian pay, as
Brown has indicated. Further
more, a return to the draft would
not affect pay increases of milit
ary careerists.
In terms of manpower, accord
ing to Brown, the most serious
problem lacing the AVF is reten
tion of recruits.
"Only a small fraction of the
recruits complete their initial
six-year contract and many are
gone within the first year." the
report says.
Brown reported that "mem

hers who joined the AVI in the
early years are re-enlisting at a
satisfactory rate (but that) reen
listment of service members with
seven to 10 years of service is
declining." The downward trend
in second term reenlistments is
particularly serious in the Navy.
To combat this. Brown outlined
various economic incentives in
cluding reenlistment bonuses
and better educational oppor
tunities for enlisted personnel.
Recruitment and quality
In regard to the quality of the
current AVF, Brown claimed
that in the past year, the Army.
Navy and Marine Corps have all
accepted recruiting shortfalls in
order to maintain the highest
percentage of high school
graduates within the services
since AVF's inception in 1973.
The DOD report contains a
table citing statistics gleaned
from the Armed Forces Ap
titude Oualitying Test (AFQT)
which was formerly the sole en
listment eligibility criterion.
The AFOT divides individuals
into five "mental groups" rang
ing from Category 1 — those
who score highest on the test —
to Category 5. those posting the
lowest scores.

While persons in Category 5
are prohibited by law from serv
ing in the military, the ad\isabil
it\ of accepting persons with
Category 4 status is subject to
debate. Reports indicate that in
recent years the biggest recruit
ment of Category 4 persons was
in 1972. when manpower was
needed during the Vietnam War.
"There was some question
about whether they (persons
with Category 4 status) were
trainable, whether they could do
army work." said Maryann
Knight, a graduate student in
political science here who taught
in a high school-level program
for troops in an army base in
Germany during the Vietnam
War. "My impression was that
they couldn't," she said.
In fact, according to Knight,
the term "CAT 4" came.to be
synonymous with stupidity
around the army bases. "Nearly
all of them were illiterate, had
not finished high school: they
were semi-trainable," she said.
The DOD report points to the
decline in Category 4 personnel
since 1972 and concludes, "the
active forces are obtaining enlis
tees with the mental abilities to
meet force requirements."
However. Clarissa Eastham, a

Stanford student who is a candi
date tor Navy ensign when she
completes school, said she feels
"the standards are way too low
lor geting into the Army. You
wouldn't believe how excited
they were in having someone
with an education."
Brown claims in his report,
however, that mental and physi
cal standards are currently more
difficult for both enlistments and
reenlistments. More difficult, he
asserted, than they were during
either the draft or the Vietnam
War. The DOD report maintains
that at all times since the draft
ended, it has "consistently" met
strength targets while maintain
ing high standards.
In terms of numerical
strength, the AVF must contend
with the decline in the number of
service-eligible males. By 19K5.
the number of 18 year olds in the
general population will drop to
S5 percent of their number in
1 977. Brown has argued that in
creasing competition for jobs in
the private sector may brighten
recruitment prospects, or at least
buffer any shortfalls. The DOD
estimates that the labor pool will
increase 20 percent by 1990.
Knight said the two groups of
people the services have the
most trouble recruiting and re
taining are the highly specialized
technicians who could easily find
jobs in industry, and the basic
army infantrymen.
"While the infantry does ter
ribly unpleasant things in time of
war. it does incredibly boring
things — like painting rocks — in
time ot peace." she observed.
Knight also mentioned the fact
that infantrymen generally re
ceive little specialized training
and that if a career infantryman
retires after 20 years of active
service, he will enter the job


Fiscal year
market with virtually no skills.
Boorstin's 1975 report noted
that the quality of the armed
forces is ultimately measured by
"combat-readiness." In 1974, he
noted, the Department of the
Army reported that all 13 of its
divisions were combat-ready.
This had not always been the
case during the Vietnam War,
according to Boorstin.
The Reserves
An area of major concern in
the AVI is the state of the milit
ary's reserve forces.
According to Brown, the suc
cess of today's total force is
"heavily dependent on the rapid
mobilization and deployment of
reserves to light in a major,
high-intensity, conventional war
in Europe."
In 1979, Pentagon officials re
ported that the army counts on
reser\es to pro\ ide 45 percent ot
"quick reaction" manpower,
while the Navy, Air Force and
Marines reserves will provide
about 15 to 20 percent. As of
June 1979, the nation had ap
proximately 1.15 million re
serves who could be called to ac
tive duty, a figure 600.000 short
of the minimum number needed
in the event of a war. according
to figures cited in U.S. News and
World Report.
The article attributes this in
sufficient reserve roster or
"manpower crisis'" within the re
serves to two developments:
I irst. under \ oluntary recruiting,
young men are no longer signing
up for the reserves to escape the
draft, and secondly, the armed
forces have shrunk from a Viet
nam war peak of 3.5 million en
listed personnel, to two million
volunteers in active service, thus
lowering the number of \ eterans
in position to join the Individual
Ready Reserve Units.
"Maintaining personnel le\el
in the reserve force-continues to
be the most difficult problem we
are experiencing in ensuring re
serve readiness." the I 9KO DOD
report states.
In addressing this problem,
the department has im
plemented programs involving
reenlistment bonuses, recruiting
assistance and other training
programs.
Racial imbalance
The armed forces have experi
enced a great increase in both the
number of blacks volunteering
for the military and also higher
than average rates for reenlist
ment among black personnel.
The Army has historically had
the highest number of blacks and
the Navy the lowest, according to
the DC)I) report.
The proportion of blacks cur
rently enlisted has risen from I
percent in 196 1 ) to 18 percent in
1977. and increases have also
occurred in the proportion ot
black officers.
The percentage of all active
duty officers who are black more
than doubled between 1964
when it was 1.7 percent and 1977
when it was 4 percent.
Marshall feels this is particu
larly attributable to the fact that
the AVF can be thought of as an
"upward mobility track for poor,
ghetto blacks." indeed, recruit
ment has been best during reces
sion years like 1973-1975, ac
cording to most reports.
Knight observed during her
stay in Germany that a good
proportion ot the blacks were re
legated to "warehouse-type"
jobs because ol their generally
limited education. Hiese men
seldom got the opportunity to
move into more highly
specialized or technical posi
tions. Knight said.
"There is an enormous
amount of discrimination in the

Army against blacks — the ques
tion is where is starts," she said.
A lot of it starts among the offic
ers. For instance, they like to
have college-educated people
for clerks, so those are the ones
they pull out (of the enlisted per
sonnel ranks)." Very lew-blacks
in the Army are college
educated. she observed.
"I guess the Army is really no
more racist than the rest of soci
ety. although I'd say it was more
integrated." Knight said.
Drujj Use
One i)l the most sensitive
areas in discussions of the AVI is
the degree of drug use by milit
ary personnel. In January o!
I ( >75. A Study of Department of
Defense Drug Ahitse Prevention
and Control Programs was pub
lished by an independent grou>
working in cooperation with the
DOD. "
The report concluded from the
collected, self-reported data of
12.000 service members that
marijuana was being used by 3N
percent ol the armed services.
This average was then broken
down and analyzed, revealing
the following statistics:
In all categories ol drug use,
the Air Force consistently
showed the lowest degree of par
ticipation.
— Use of hard drugs, such as
hallucinogens, amphetamines
and barbiturates, was most often
confined to less than 15 percent
of the serv ice. However, 25 pe
cent of the Marine Corps per
sonnel responding to the study,
reported use of amphetamines.
— On-the-job use of drugs
was halved in almost all
categories. Collectively, 16 per
cent ol respondents reported
on-the-job use of marijuana.
The report reached the con
clusion that most drug use in the
services is by persons aged 21
and under. In the services as a
whole these people include 63 to
73 percent of those who have
tried any given drug.
In addition, high school
drop-outs were disproportion
ately represented among armed
forces drug users. Also, the
majority ol current drug users,
about 65 percent, were users be
fore entering the armed serv ices.
Although drug use varies by
location — the bases in the
Pacific reported the greatest
number of drug users — it ap
peared to the authors of the re
port that age was the most im
portant factor.
Availability, they concluded,
does play a role and use by loca
tion seems to be getting more un
iform; but on the whole, drug use
is decreasing. The only drug not
reported to have declined in use
is marijuana.

Urinalysis and other methods
are in use by the services to de
tect drug abuse. Non-military
therapies for drug use have
ranged from psychoanalysis to
Synanon games and from indi
vidual counseling to hajfway
houses. The effectiveness of
these programs is difficult to es
timate. according to the report.
Desertion rates
A second sensitive area of
concern for the AVF supporters
is the desertion rate. The Marine
Corps lias the highest desertion
rate with 4.7 desertions per 100
recruits. The Air Force ranks
lowest in this category.
In 1964, Boorstin cited, there
were less than two desertions per
