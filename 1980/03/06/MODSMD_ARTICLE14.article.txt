# Wrong 'Hunter' stalked by irritated hate-mail writers
## 
### Jane West 
What could be worse than
looking into an empty ppst office
box? For Bill Hunter, it was un
deserved hate mail.
As one of the only five "Hun
ters" listed in the student direc
tory, Bill Hunter was the unlucky
recipient of two hostile letters
addressed to Colin Hunter the
man who burned the large draft

card tacsimilie at the January 24
anti-draft rally in White Plaza.
The letters, addressed to Mr.
Colin Hunter, Stanford Univer
sity, were forwarded to Bill
Hunter's P.O. Box.
A picture of Colin Hunter ap
peared in newspapers and
magazines across the country
and apparently offended some
who viewed it.
When Bill Hunter, a junior
majoring in mathematical sci

ences received the letters, he did
not open them, hut tried to have
them placed in the correct P.O.
Box. Each time the letters were
returned to him. Finally, he at
tempted to contact Colin
Hunter, but discovered, along
with the Dean of Student Af
fairs' Office which also received
mail for the missing Hunter, that
his name was not listed in local
phonebooks.
"Everything finally fell to
gether when I opened the let
ters." said Bill Hunter. "1 de
cided to look at them to see if
they contained anything impor
tant. I'm sure Colin would be in
terested in seeing them. They are
pretty comical."
A letter from a Vietnam vete
ran in Erie, Penn., expressed a
desire to have Colin Hunter de
ported. The other writer, from
Boston, Mass., did not want a
draft but felt Hunter should be a
realist and predicted Hunter
would run off to Canada the mi
nute a war began.
Both letters contained consid
erable profanity, and both also
enclosed a clipping of Hunter
with their own additions. The

man from Pennsylvania drew a
Russian flag over the draft card,
and the letter from Boston con
tained other interesting remarks.
Colin Hunter, a 1973 Stanford
graduate, said he didn't know the
picture was distributed nation
wide until his stepmother called
from Austin. Texas, the day fol
lowing the rally, "and started
screaming at my sister-in-law."
The photo had appeared in
newspapers nationwide that day,
including the Austin newspaper.
Colin said he has received
"about five phone calls and a
couple of letters" concerning his
participation in the rally.
Surprising to some, all these
contacts have been positive, ac

cording to Colin. "The only
negative reaction I've gotten is
from my family."
A consulting technical writer
in Palo Alto, Hunter, 29, said the
immediate anti-registration re
sponse at the Stanford rally was
significant in the nationwide
anti-draft movement.
"After the rally, no one could
say that the students were ac
cepting it (Carter's proposal)
without protest."
But, for Bill Hunter, the rally
has brought some unex
pected attention. The letters
hut Bill hopes Colin
will contact him and pick up the
mis-delivered mail.

Lagunita Court resident Bill Hunter has mistakenly received
"hate mail" intended for anti-draft activist Colin Hunter.


Both of the unfriendly letters received by Bill Hunter, yet in
tended for Colin Hunter, included clips of Colin with "annota
tions."
