"The psychological impact (of the draft) is tremendous.
If the administration wants to signal that the Cold War is
hack, they certainly have done it in a dramatic way."
Paul Seaver
Associate Professor of History
"The quality of the United States Army is a matter of
great debate. The Secretary of the Army, Clifford Ale

Hubert Marshall
Professor of Political Science
"Non-violent protest is an active means of protest that
keeps the means in line with the ends. . . . If the end that
you're loking for is non-violent, peaceful, you can't use a
violent means to achieve it."
Liza Catanzarite
Instructor
Stanford Against Conscription

campus (seemed to be) protesting against registration."
Peter Pierce
Stanford Against Soviet Aggression
"Draft beer, not us."
