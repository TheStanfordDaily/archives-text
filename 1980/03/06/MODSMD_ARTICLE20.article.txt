# Hunting the wild club
## Mabuhay to Venetian Room 
### Ron Lillejord 
It seems that every place has
almost everything, if you look
long enough — even the most
branch office of all branch office
metropoli goes to pains to see
that this is true. Quality of per
formance aside, it just goes to
show that it was a mistake to
leave Kansas in the first place.
| Maybe out there >ou can't get
what you want, but you can get
what you need, so to speak.
Everything except nightclubs,
that is. The Bay area's night
clubs. even more than Herb
Caen or Dan White, distinguish
t location from every inha-
I bited community outside New
i York state lines. San Francisco
j has more clubs than L.A.. for in
j stance, which holds somewhere
! near eight times as many in
habitants. and it offers more var-
I iety than L.A.
Thanks to the depressed
; economy and discos and now
j rock discos (whatever the hell
that means). clubs here are thriv
ing. Why? Since the economy is
bad. people are less inclined to
i shell out money to go to a
stadium, use binoculars and have
j 14.000 people scream in their
| faces. Clubs are a lot more invit

ing. Also, people just plain want
to dance.
There are many species of club
to fill your needs. We have, for
example, sleazy dives where you
can simulate living in Newark,
and more than our share of es
tablishments catering to the
Carol Doda crowd. And if you
went to Exeter, no need to
worry. there are exclusive places,
where obloquy and scorn await a
fool without a tie.
And between these extremes
— hold your breath — we have
upwards of a billion zillion "mis
cellaneous" clubs, ranging all the
way from the red-velvet-and-
Frank Gorshen posh of the
Fairmont Hotel to the jump
up-and-down craziness of
Mabuhay Gardens.
Many, many
San Francisco, in short, has
many, many establishments de
signed to provide you with enter
tainment and or dancing and/or
grounds for imbibing at night.
Of course it is very hard to find
one's way around when one
doesn't always know where to
go. It isn't always good to have a
billion zillion clubs if your
magazine doesn't at least include
a guide to the good ones.
On that note, we begin to draw

the noose ....
Did 1 happen to hear someone
out there ask for club advice?
You in the back with calculator
in one hand and a Miller in the
other? Very good. There ore
several such establishments bet
ween here and Santa Rosa that
could do with special mention.
The Great American Music
Hall, the Old Waldorf, X"s An
nex. Keystone Berkeley, keys
tone Palo Alto. Keystone
Korner come to mind instan
taneously. Oh yes. then there's
Bimbo's, and the Palms,
and . . .
Stars
What follows are the rules by
which one should judge a club
(examples included). Ahem.
Rule No. 1 of club choosery
specifically prohibits parties of
the first part from following only
high fame-quotient stars. High
fame-quotient stars usually end
up in stadiums (Bill Graham re
cently bought the Old Waldorf,
so that may change somewhat),
with high boredom-quotient
warm-up acts — you must re
member that nightclubs depend
on medium-small entertainers.
You should know in advance
that rule No. 2 is tough for a
great many people. It requires
that you admit the existence of a
flaw. Yet it is important, and we
should shed our misconceptions
eventually.
So. remember this — despite
the popularity of component
stereo systems with digital re
cording buttons. most of human
ity is unable to tell a good sound
system from a Dixie cup on a
string. It follows that, although
sound systems vary in clubs, to
most people it doesn't really
matter.
Consider two examples. The
Great American Music Hall and
the Old Waldorf have acoustic
drawbacks, despite their shared
habit of featuring high-quality
acts. But did you ever hear any
one complain about it? At the
Old Waldorf — a favorite haunt
for Peter Tosh/Dire Straits/Patti
Smith Warren Zevon types — it
is surprising how badly the music
is mixed ("mixing" is related to
amplification, which has to do
with electricity. OK?). And
Great America's beautiful gold
leaf interior can sometimes send
a trumpet solo into an ear in a
disconcerting moment.
But. both places simply don't
neeil perfect acoustics, because
there are very few perfect ears.
Those so blessed can find what
they need at nearly every jazz
club. (Keystone Korner for
example. That's a jazz place, and

one of the best anywhere. Jazz
places are frequented by people
who demand near-perfect acous
tics — they have it because they
need it. but other places don't.)
Blown ears
St> that's No. 2. to be noted
especially by rock fans — it
doesn't make much difference if
the weak middle range of a sys
tem is matched by a blown-out
middle ear.
Rule No. 3.1t is absolutely es
sential to know what kind of
crowd you like. There's a world
of difference between Mabuhay

'When you choose unci like u club,
go buck.'

Gardens-variety crowds and the
rest of mankind as we know and
love it. for example; you have to
know which ilk you really enjoy
or else it could destroy an even
ing.
The Mabuhay is a perfect
example. There is music, to he
sure, though neo-fascists prefer
to call is "sick punk rock crap."
But. sometimes, it seems as if the
music is less of an attraction than
the seething masses themselves.
The Mabuhay has a distinctive
crowd, to say the least. The
music docs attain near-mythic
status with greater than average
frequency, but it you're looking
for an evening free of flying
ashtrays, this simply isn't your
place.
The Keystone Palo Alto has
more of a straight rock crowd
kids who've seen the Cireg kihn
Band 49 times in the last two
years — but it's a good, not-too
sedate club, and it has the added
advantage of being close by. un
like the Mabuhay, where you
have to drive up to the City in
order to get your facc threatened

In sharp objects.
The Keystone features most of
the hot local acts (such as the
Rubinoos and Greg Kilin) as
well lis occasional big names
(like George Thorogood. Chuck
Berr\ and Roy Buchanon). Tic
kets run in the $5.50 to $7.50
price range.
X's Annex appeals to a more
youthful audience — it's a "rock
disco," you see. Its got a very
plush interior and a nice sound
system — and flashing lights, but
it does manage to avoid the disco
crap that's filled our ears for half

a decade now. Danceable rock
bands like The Beat often play
here.
The Great American Music
Hall is relatively calm, and the
Waldorf is rowdy, but controlled
— crowds at X's Annex and the
Keystone are somewhere in bet
ween. Surprisingly, even cross
over crowds are affected by these
reputations.
That doesn't mean that Herb
Alpert could play the Mabuhay
and bring the wovld to an end. or
that Johnny Rotten wouldn't
notice that things were quieter in
the Venetian Room, but certain
clubs do have certain types ol
crowds.
Differences in food and drink
begat rule No. 4. And 10, the
multitudes were told not to
forget that gasoline is sometimes
required when return is made to
I'alo Alto, and they were told
that they would have to sleep in
an alley. And the multitude
adhered to the commandments
ol the golden calf of tuition, and
called in advance to find out the
drink minimum.
