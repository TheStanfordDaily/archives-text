# Remembering Dan Mendelowitz
## 
### Karen Wada 
.4 memorial program was held
lust week for emeritus art and
education professor Daniel Men
delowitz. Tlte noted watercolorist
and instructor died last month
after an illness. He was 75.

It's hard to write about you,
because we'\e never met. Well,
we have — 1 saw your paintings
in October, and your American
art book sits on a shelf above my
desk. And I heard your friends.
Friday: their memories of you
were clear and hopeful. Thank
you. they said, for giving and
leaving so much for us.
University Press Director
Leon Seltzer praised your
warmth and concern for others:
"We all are his pupils in one way
or another .... He has touched
on our lives, brushed or deep,
altered, replenished . . . and
saved us."
Felix Bloch remembered your
arrival here in 1934, and the
shared celebrations since —

from birthdays to "watching our
children grow, until wc realized
they weren't kids anymore."
Art and science aren't so far
apart, especially with (Dan)
around, the physicist said of his
painter-friend. What helped to
narrow the gap, Bloch explained,
was your "perfect integrity" and
open-mindedness, your "gentle
ness and warm feelings."
Your "dubious" reaction to
Scientific Results delighted
physicist Robert Hofstadter. He
also praised your rapport with
students. "Dan strengthened
them through rough times."
Many came back to visit, and you
always kept in touch.
Nobility. a sense of reality, the
"solidity and firmness" of your
thought. The gentle freshness
which touched what you painted.
Hofstadter also found a
toughness in you, which sur
prised him. "Dan loved living
and made a fight for it like I
have never seen."
You were a prince to col

leagues and students, said Art
Prof. Matt Kahn. He remem
bered your delight in small, rich
things: double flowers and See's
chocolates; the music of Brahms
and Chopin — played for you
Friday — movies and Broadway
tunes.
This love of the fine and fancy
was balanced with a larger, prac
tical vision of the "real world"
and "physical realities."
"(Dan) valued the university
atmosphere, but his work was
nc\ er cerebral or remote," Kahn
said. In "emphatic," "searching"
art. you caught your favorite
California winter sky. strange
faces, sunlight and salt flats. So
engrossed in the "real scene."
Kahn added, that while painting
a landscape once, you didn't
notice a cow standing behind you
until it mooed in your ear.
I ndependent. Representa
tional. Patient. Timid. Refresh
ing. Take your choice, your
friends said Friday; but. as Kahn

promised, alter seeing your
watercolors,"We must hear wit
ness to a pleasure and a love
which (Dan's work) provoked.''
I know your face by heart. I
spent hours poring over photos
of you for an article on your Oc
tober exhibit here. Crazy busi
ness: sifting, sorting for the one
shot which captures You —as if
I'd know.
What nailed my decision was
that jaunty bow tie and un
abashed grin.
"Dan was a dresser," Matt
Kahn said Friday. Not ostenta
tious. Just proud and elegant.
And that grin, I've seen it in
your watercolors and felt it in
your writing, especially when
you talk about children's art or
your love of drawing.
Well, professor.
As Kahn said Friday ."Shalom
to you . . . and ichuim — to the
lite you led. and the life you still
lead in all of us."
