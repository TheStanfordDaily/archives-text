f/.s there life after Stanford for
line arts majors ' This is the first
in a series on students and their
departments faced with the pre\-
sing (/tieslions of the "fuzzy
\tndies": are the attitudes and
goals academic. pre
professional, self-indulgent or
merely what-the-'hell?)

Mary Setrakian. a senior
music ma jor from Marin County.
is one of about 30 musicians
seriously studying voice here.
She is studying with Marie
Gibson, a voice instructor in the
Music Department, and is an ac
tive member and soloist in both
the University Chorale and Choir.
During both her sophomore and
junior years she presented solo
recitals. Setrakian also has been
involved with a wide variety of
musical theater, ranging from
her freshman debut as Model in
the Ram's Head's production of
Fiddler on the Roof to perform
ing the role of Lauretta in tl".-
closing performance of Gian ii
Sclucchi recently presented by
the Stanford Opera Theater.
In addition. Setrakian was the
musical director for the 197N
Ram's Head Gaieties and has
also found time to play piccolo in
the Band.
Why here?
Why did she decide on Stan
ford? "I wanted to find out it
there was something that I was
really good at, other than
music." Setrakian explained.
Coming from a Stanford family,
she said she believed Stanford
could provide an opportunity to
explore other interests. She

started from a very wide base ("I
was a very hyper freshman/')
participating in Band. Chorale,
and playing a lead in 112 iddler.
As a second-quarter
freshman, she began voice in
struction with Marie Gibson, and
in the spring she became a music
major. The biggest influence on
this decision was Marie Gibson.
"Learning to sing technically
takes years and years: you have
to unlearn old habits and create
new habits that are correct." Not
only has Gibson taught Setra
kian to sing technically, but she
lias also been able to teach her to
bring out the emotion in music.
Setrakian also feels fortunate to
have worked with Dr. Ramsey in
Choir and Chorale and with
Andor loth in Gianni Schicchi.
" loth is able to pull the music
out of you." she said.
Stanford never has been
known as a fine-arts school; can
it prepare a musician for a per
forming career? "I don't think
that Stanford is the place to go it
you know as an entering
freshman that you're ready to go
into music for the rest of your
life."
Setrakian found the music de
partment did till her need to
explore other interests before
deciding on music. "Stanford is
for liberal arts education; we are
not a conservatory."
Wide appeal
Music students are expected to
take courses in other areas and.
in fact, many double major. Set
rakian said that the music prog
ram here is designed to provide a
balanced knowledge of music
and performance.
"If you want to perform, there
is plenty of opportunity," Setra
kian said. The Music Depart-

ment provides groups like Choir
and Glee Club, and there are
also dorm shows and student
theater groups such as Ram's
Head or the Company.
However, Setrakian does find
some holes in music education
here. She would like to see re
quirements added: foreign lan
guages for \ oice students or
vocal literature classes. Also,
there is a lack of extended prog
rams such as ja/z theory or musi
cal theater.
New requirements are on the
way. such as juries for perfor
mance majors. Setrakian is a
member of a voice committee
looking into a possible new re
quirement for voice students.
Also, a new music building has
been approved.
The music program here can
prepare you lor a career in musi
cal performance. Setrakian said.
Technique is an important
skill. "I want to be able to sing
anything I want. The only way to
do that is to get a strong
technique." Stanlord has pro
sided excellent instruction for
Setrakian. "I think that 1 could
go out and be a performer, and I
think I can make it."
Exploration
I ler future is still one of explo
ration. "I don't know what kind
of singing I love the best." Stan
ford has opened up not only the
possibility of a classical style, but
also musical comedy. Mary
wants to stay away from New
York for now. She is applying to
graduate schools of music." I still
want personal attention. I don't
want to be in the rat race."
According to Setrakian. the
voice does not mature until the
late 20s: at 21. sbe said her voice
is very young. She is concerned

that singing in professional musi
cal comedy at tins time could
damage her voice. If she does not
become a performer, then she
would like to teach music.
Directing music for the 1978
Gaieties was one of her most val
uable experiences in teaching
others. "If you can take a per
former's energy and point it in
the right direction, you can work
miracles."

Her experience with music at
Stanford has been very personal.
She says that you must decide
what your emphasis in music will
be. Then you can get along with
the teachers; you can do what
you want. Stanford has provided
Setrakian with the opportunity
to find out that music is really
what she wants and has provided
the training she needed to be
come a performer.
