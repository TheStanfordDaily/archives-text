# Chopin, Schubert, improvise
## 
### 
Pianist Michael Cava will perform Schubert,
Chopin and improvisations today at 8 p.m. in the
Tresidder upstairs lounge.
The STARTS concert will feature Schubert's
Sonata in G major and Chopin's Polonaise in
/â– '-sharp minor.
Cava was brought here for the University's
Dance Week 19N0, according to STARTS
programmer Douglas Whitcher.
Cava primarily works with Inga Weiss in her
workshops here, but is such a noted soloist that he
has been asked to give a recital as part of the
STARTS winter quarter music series, Whitcher
said.
"The really special thing about this concert is
that Cava will display an aspect of musicianship
that has been neglected since Beethoven: improvi
sation.

"This ability arises from Cava's extensive ex
perience as a dance accompanist. In this situation,
the pianist must spontaneously compose pieces to
fit the movements being taught."
Three in one
Next Thursday, STARTS will present a chamber
trio at K p.m. in the Tresidder large lounge.
Cellist Irene Sharp with pianist Corrine Barkin
and violinist Clarice Horelick will perform Martin,
Franck, Milhaud, Schumann and Bloch.
Sharp studied at Carnegie-Mellon University
and with several private instructors, including
Margaret Rowell. She is a lecturer at San Francisco
State University and at the San Francisco Conser
vatory of Music.
Barkin studied at Julliard. Oberlin and the Man
hattan School of Music. Her debut at Carnegie
Recital' Hall occurred in 1962.
