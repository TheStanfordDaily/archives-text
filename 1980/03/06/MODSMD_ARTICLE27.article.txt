# Sound of music still sweet

After seeing The Sound oj
Music at the movies and on tele
\ision. we were curious about
how it would look on the stage.
Seeing it live was a real treat and
the Palo Alto Players' produc
tion is entertaining, sincere and
inspiring.
The inspiration comes from
the story itself. It is set in Austria
in 193 N. The story highlights
how Maria, a young novitiate, be
comes the governess for a sea
captain's seven children. In
tertwined throughout is the cap
tain's (Paul Edwards (opposition
to Nazi rule in his homeland.
What is most important for
Maria (Nancy Kendzierski) to
learn God's will for her life and
to follow it. She is so sincere in

that desire that we follow her
story earnestly, always hoping
for the best. And we're not dis
appointed. She does find her
"dream'' as her Reverend
Mother describes it.
The singing excellent
throughout. Edwards,
kendzierski and the Reverend
Mother are all \ ery talented, and
the blending of the voices in the
nun's chorus is superb.
The entire cast performs well
and it would be difficult to select
an "outstanding performer"
trom this well-rehearsed crew.
Energy and enthusiasm are evi
dent. especially in Maria. The
orchestra complemented the
performance and added another
high qualiy dimension to the
show.
The Sound of Music is for the

whole family, with actors and ac
tresses ranging in age from 5 to
50. and audience appeal that ex
tends even beyond that.
There are some new songs,
new characters and new twists of
plot that were not brought out 111
the movie version. For those
who've seen the movie, this pro
duction is different enough to be
very entertaining: and for those
who haven't seen the movie, the
story 1 s dev eloped smoothly and
fully so following along will be no
problem.
Overall. The Sound of Music is
well worth your attendance:
every seat in the house is a good
one.

Alto Community Theater, 1305
