# Standards of deviation
## The 						new Chaparral 
### Seth Zuckerman 
Well, it's that time of year/
quarter when, once again,
strange posters blossom
throughout the University ad
vertising an e\ en stranger publi
cation called the Chaparral. Cal
led a masterpiece of wit by some
and a cesspool of puerile im
maturity by others, of all the
periodic occurrences here, the
Chaparral is certainly one ot
them.
It is something of a bad habit
for someone to grandstand (in
these pages and to parade before
the community-at-large a drivel
ing piece of trash worthy of
neither the Chaparral nor the
Daily. It is too easy to roast an
honest effort out of sheer delight
in the roasting process and out of
infatuation with one's own
words. I almost started to do it
myself. That, one hopes, will not
be the case.
So step right up. folks, to the
Hammer and Coffin humor soci

ety's variety show. Something
for everyone — for the whole
family.
Most of the" articles share a
couple of characteristics. One is
a profound lack of subtlety, in
the finest Hammer and Coffin
tradition.
The other common de
nominator is that there is 110
common denominator to the ar
ticles. or at least most of them,
unless I'm missing some subtle
nuances of the mystical interpre
tation of college humor
magazines. While this is not es
sential. an overall concept would
ha\e strengthened the message
appreciably.
Perhaps the title Standard De
viation is meant to imply that all
the articles deviate from one
another, beyond the obvious im
plication that the Chaparral is
standardly deviant. Who knows?
I leave it to the reader to decide
whether the Chaparral staff was
clever enough to have intended
that.

These drawbacks are out
weighed by a few very positive
developments in the Chaparral.
In its opening statement, the
Chaparral once again raises the
banner of resistance to registra
tion and the draft.
Once upon a time, boys and
girls, the Chaparral was a news
weekly with a definite leftist
radical slant that skewered the
University and federal administ
rations. ROTC. Spiro Agnew.
the war in Indochina and other
monsters of the times.
While the Chaparral has not
returned to that point, it is re
treshing to see it taking a forth
right stand on an issue that too
many campus publications have
sidestepped or weaseled around
in their editorial policies. Hasta
la victoria siempre! I Che Guev
ara's rallying cry.)
The Chaparral sallies forth.

too. against intellectual elitism in
the hallowed halls of this Univer
sity. specifically in the Structured
Liberal Education program.
Even more specifically, it lam
basts the presumptuous tyranny
that Prof. Mark Mancall is said to
exercise over his sometimes
adoring disciples.
Nixon-haters whose passion is
undimmed despite the six years
since he flashed his last V-for
victory from the platform of a
U.S. Air Force helicopter will
undoubtedly be intrigued, too.
by the picture of Richard Nixon
as he really was (without the
false eyes). Suitable for
dartboards. too. for the \ iolently
inclined.
Kaisins
The shorter pieces, examining
the seamier, less acknowledged
sides of Zen and the art of adver
tising and other quickie topics,
are the raisins of the cake.
But still, you say. what is the
magazine really like? And why
should I spend the money it took
me hours of hard labor to cajole
out of my upper-middle-class
parent 1 on 25 pieces of glossy
paper stapled together? The lat
ter is beyond my realm. As to the
former, the Chaparral is a more
sophisticated version of MAD
magazine, but not as esoteric or
as polished as Punch or Woody
Allen's Annie Hall.
These comparisons begin to
lead to questions about the very
purpose and function of campus
satire magazines: questions that
are far beyond the scope of this
forum.
In a larger sense, we cannot
dedicate — we cannot consec
rate — we cannot hallow this
magazine. The poor people, liv
ing and dead, who wrote it have
consecrated it far above our poor
power to add or detract. What
(whom?) they consecrated it to
remains an open question.
