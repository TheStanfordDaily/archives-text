# Home-grown bands: the campus crush
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
While the excitement of a new
generation of popular music has
captured the attention of rock
and roll devotees here, a home
grown band called Rooftop
Magic has begun to divert ear
drums toward the campus rock
scene.
As the band members them
selves are quick to tell you. Roof
top Magic isn't about to headline
the Keystone in the near future,
but the group has become the
most sought-after band for cam
pus parties and has even gained a
small-scale cult following.
Saturday night. Rooftop
Magic will be playing in Santa
Cruz, in only its fifth off-campus
gig. But in the wake of two \er\

successful shows two weeks ago
at Roble Hall and at the Stanford
A\gainst Conscription fundraiser,
the band has few worries about
this weekend's road trip.
"We seem to get a good reac
tion wherever we go." said
junior Jay Gitterman. the
keyboards player and quasi
manager of the group.
One part of the band's appeal
is its repertoire, most of which
consists of covers of new and old
rock'tunes by a diverse range of
artists. But all the songs have one
thing in common: they're good
to dance to. And as far as party
audiences are concerned, that's
what matters.
For the band members, there

are different reasons — not all of
them totally serious.
"I'm personally in it for the
money and the drugs." cracked
guitarist Chris Filon from behind
a wooly beard. "Actually, it is
nice to make some
money . . . but I've discovered
there's no such thing as a groupie
at Stanford." he added, smil
ing. Bassist Cole Case, how
ever. is more to the point about
his musical aspirations. The
energetic sophomore said he
would give just about anything
to be a successful musician,
quoting Mick Jagger's state
ment: "Show me a teen-age kid
who doesn't want to be a rock
and roll star, and I'll show von a

liar."
For all of them, however, en
joyment comes just from playing
songs they like and having other
people enjoy them. too.
"It's not much fun to play
music you love in front of people
who hate it and it's not much fun
to play music you hate in front ot
people who love it."
Such is the profundity of Jim
Ferrell. the band's other
guitarist, who is a fourth year
med student here. He claims he
is addicted to heroin. Take that
as seriously as you want.
Ferrell. who has been playing
guitar off and on for 10 years, has
been the most creative element
of the band. He has written four
of the group's songs, including a
catchy tune called "Should I
Stay. Should I Go." (He has
another one titled "Song of
Grass and Snow." but I'm not
going to touch that one . . .)
Trading off
The interplay between Ferrell
and Pilon is one of the highlights
of the group's show. but the two
guitarists are modest about their
abilities.
"I've learned a lot from him
(Ferrell)," iilon said.
Ferrell said he learned stan
dard guitar technique in seventh
grade, but that Pilon "is learning
to play it the right way." Pilon
began teaching himself in 12th
grade.
As a result of this difference,
the two display unique — but
complementary — styles of play
on stage. Pilon. who relies
primarily on bending the strings
of his guitar during solos, has a
more free-flowing, Jerry
Garcia-like approach. Ferrell.
on the other hand, is more delib
erate and precise, though no less
creative.
"Double leads are really fun,"
Ferrell said. "We really try to lis
ten to each other."
The instrumental contingent
of the band is filled out by
drummer Tom Townshend, a
25-year-old engineer who lives
in the area.
But the greatest share of the
spotlight's glare falls on lead
vocalist Leslie Moulton, whose
full, lustv voice Is reminiscent of

something between Rickie Lee
Jones' and Janis Joplin's.
Phi Psi
Rooftop Magic, which formed
in September, is one of three
"second-generation" campus
bands that grew out of the short
lived but well-loved Phi Psi Band
of last spring.
Formed from then-Phi Psi re
sidents Pilon. Moulton, Gitter
man. Dan Prutel (drums). Nikki
Roy (bass), Lyle Zimmerman
(guitar) and Peter Moulton
(flute/sax), the Phi Psi Band
spent a whirlwind spring quarter
last year, playing almost weekly
at parties and noon concerts.
When the members parted
ways for the summer, Gitterman
began playing with Ferrell. and
the two were later joined by
Pilon and Leslie Moulton. After
advertisements and auditions for
new members. Case and
Townshend signed on in Sep
tember.
Though there was some bit
terness between the old Phi Psi
members and the newly-formed
Rooftop Magic, it died relativ ely
quickly and both Zimmerman
and Roy formed new bands.
The Claude Monet Band,
which made an impressive debut
a lew weeks ago at Tresidder, is
Zimmerman's latest effort.
Perhaps the most creative musi
cian of the old Phi Psi group.
Zimmerman co-founded the
new band with another guitarist,
senior Tom Casciato. Unfortu
nately. Casciato has been unable
to play since last summer be
cause of tendonitis in his arm.

Nevertheless, the large crowd
which gathered to hear the
group's first performance can at
test to the bright future that the
Claude Monet Band faces.
Missy Pea body
According to Zimmerman,
good singing is his band's strong
point — though he excludes him
self from this distinction. ("1
have a voice that would sterilize
frogs from 200 yards.") He de
scribed lead singer Missy Pea
body as having "an untrained
voice that's going to be pheno
menal. She just needs experi
ence: she has an incredible feel
for interpreting the music."
In addition, bass player Jell
Bell — who. like several mem
bers ol the band, can play more
than one instrument well — has a
voice that has earned him the
lead role in the Company's pro
duction oiJesus Clirisi Superstar.
With Pilon temporarily sub
bing lor the ailing Casciato. the
band is tilled out by Purtel on
drums and Peter Moulton on sax.
flute and percussion.
Zimmerman said his attitude
toward the band is one of "good,
clean, party tun — money
doesn't enter into it." I le said the
band has a different musical out
look from that of Rooftop
Magic, although the two have a
close musical relationship. "We
do a lot more stuff nobody's
likely to have heard. There's
more of a Motown-like em
phasis. Where they like the
Grateful Dead, lor example, we
like I..Hie Feat.
Spring quarter should also see

the emergence of the Elephant
Band, bassist Roy's new project.
Like the Claude Monet Band.
The Elephant Band has been
somewhat in limbo since
guitarist Paul Angelchik caught
mononucleosis at the beginning
of winter quarter.
Roy said the band is playing
the rock and jazz favorites of its
members — which include
keyboards player Larry Goode
and drummer Andy Miller.
"We don't want to be stuck in
the 'just noise' rock crew," Roy

s;iid. What we're playing is rock
with chord changes, or jazz with
electric instruments. It's kind ot
a high ambition, but I haven't
seen too many bands do it.and I
tin 11k it can be done nicely,"
In accordance with the "try
not to let academics get in the
way ot music" ethic espoused by
Pilon. the three bands are look
ing forward to a busy spring.
With the talent the groups are
laden with, it seems that the only
thing that may get in the way ot
the music ... is more music.

Phi Psi
Rooftop Magic, which formed

Formed from then-Phi Psi re

Roy (bass), Lyle Zimmerman
(guitar) and Peter Moulton
(flute/sax), the Phi Psi Band
spent a whirlwind spring quarter
last year, playing almost weekly
at parties and noon concerts.
When the members parted
ways for the summer, Gitterman
began playing with Ferrell. and
the two were later joined by
Pilon and Leslie Moulton. After
advertisements and auditions for
new members. Case and
Townshend signed on in Sep
tember.
Though there was some bit
terness between the old Phi Psi
members and the newly-formed
Rooftop Magic, it died relativ ely
quickly and both Zimmerman
and Roy formed new bands.
The Claude Monet Band,
which made an impressive debut
a lew weeks ago at Tresidder, is
Zimmerman's latest effort.
Perhaps the most creative musi
cian of the old Phi Psi group.
Zimmerman co-founded the
new band with another guitarist,
senior Tom Casciato. Unfortu

to play since last summer be
cause of tendonitis in his arm.

Nevertheless, the large crowd

According to Zimmerman,

In addition, bass player Jell

spotlight's glare falls on lead
vocalist Leslie Moulton, whose
full, lustv voice Is reminiscent of

something between Rickie Lee

Phi Psi
Rooftop Magic, which formed
in September, is one of three
"second-generation" campus
bands that grew out of the short
lived but well-loved Phi Psi Band
of last spring.
Formed from then-Phi Psi re
sidents Pilon. Moulton, Gitter
man. Dan Prutel (drums). Nikki
Roy (bass), Lyle Zimmerman
(guitar) and Peter Moulton
(flute/sax), the Phi Psi Band
spent a whirlwind spring quarter
last year, playing almost weekly
at parties and noon concerts.
When the members parted
ways for the summer, Gitterman
began playing with Ferrell. and
the two were later joined by
Pilon and Leslie Moulton. After
advertisements and auditions for
new members. Case and
Townshend signed on in Sep
tember.
Though there was some bit
terness between the old Phi Psi
members and the newly-formed
Rooftop Magic, it died relativ ely
quickly and both Zimmerman
and Roy formed new bands.
The Claude Monet Band,
which made an impressive debut
a lew weeks ago at Tresidder, is
Zimmerman's latest effort.
Perhaps the most creative musi
cian of the old Phi Psi group.
Zimmerman co-founded the
new band with another guitarist,
senior Tom Casciato. Unfortu
nately. Casciato has been unable
to play since last summer be
cause of tendonitis in his arm.

Nevertheless, the large crowd
which gathered to hear the
group's first performance can at
test to the bright future that the
Claude Monet Band faces.
Missy Pea body
According to Zimmerman,
good singing is his band's strong
point — though he excludes him
self from this distinction. ("1
have a voice that would sterilize
frogs from 200 yards.") He de
scribed lead singer Missy Pea
body as having "an untrained
voice that's going to be pheno
menal. She just needs experi
ence: she has an incredible feel
for interpreting the music."
In addition, bass player Jell
Bell — who. like several mem
bers ol the band, can play more
than one instrument well — has a
voice that has earned him the
lead role in the Company's pro
duction oiJesus Clirisi Superstar.
With Pilon temporarily sub
bing lor the ailing Casciato. the
band is tilled out by Purtel on
drums and Peter Moulton on sax.
flute and percussion.
Zimmerman said his attitude
toward the band is one of "good,
clean, party tun — money
doesn't enter into it." I le said the
band has a different musical out
look from that of Rooftop
Magic, although the two have a
close musical relationship. "We
do a lot more stuff nobody's
likely to have heard. There's
more of a Motown-like em
phasis. Where they like the
Grateful Dead, lor example, we
like I..Hie Feat.
Spring quarter should also see

the emergence of the Elephant
Band, bassist Roy's new project.
Like the Claude Monet Band.
The Elephant Band has been
somewhat in limbo since
guitarist Paul Angelchik caught
mononucleosis at the beginning
of winter quarter.
Roy said the band is playing
the rock and jazz favorites of its
members — which include
keyboards player Larry Goode
and drummer Andy Miller.
"We don't want to be stuck in
the 'just noise' rock crew," Roy

s;iid. What we're playing is rock
with chord changes, or jazz with
electric instruments. It's kind ot
a high ambition, but I haven't
seen too many bands do it.and I
tin 11k it can be done nicely,"
In accordance with the "try
not to let academics get in the
way ot music" ethic espoused by
Pilon. the three bands are look
ing forward to a busy spring.
With the talent the groups are
laden with, it seems that the only
thing that may get in the way ot
the music ... is more music.


Mother knows best

Hansen) how she's going to win him the throne by knock

Head's Pippin. The show opens in April. Tickets are
available at Tresidder.
While the excitement of a new
generation of popular music has
captured the attention of rock
and roll devotees here, a home
grown band called Rooftop
Magic has begun to divert ear
drums toward the campus rock
scene.
As the band members them
selves are quick to tell you. Roof
top Magic isn't about to headline
the Keystone in the near future,
but the group has become the
most sought-after band for cam
pus parties and has even gained a
small-scale cult following.
Saturday night. Rooftop
Magic will be playing in Santa
Cruz, in only its fifth off-campus
gig. But in the wake of two \er\

successful shows two weeks ago
at Roble Hall and at the Stanford
A\gainst Conscription fundraiser,
the band has few worries about
this weekend's road trip.
"We seem to get a good reac
tion wherever we go." said
junior Jay Gitterman. the
keyboards player and quasi
manager of the group.
One part of the band's appeal
is its repertoire, most of which
consists of covers of new and old
rock'tunes by a diverse range of
artists. But all the songs have one
thing in common: they're good
to dance to. And as far as party
audiences are concerned, that's
what matters.
For the band members, there

are different reasons — not all of
them totally serious.
"I'm personally in it for the
money and the drugs." cracked
guitarist Chris Filon from behind
a wooly beard. "Actually, it is
nice to make some
money . . . but I've discovered
there's no such thing as a groupie
at Stanford." he added, smil
ing. Bassist Cole Case, how
ever. is more to the point about
his musical aspirations. The
energetic sophomore said he
would give just about anything
to be a successful musician,
quoting Mick Jagger's state
ment: "Show me a teen-age kid
who doesn't want to be a rock
and roll star, and I'll show von a

liar."
For all of them, however, en
joyment comes just from playing
songs they like and having other
people enjoy them. too.
"It's not much fun to play
music you love in front of people
who hate it and it's not much fun
to play music you hate in front ot
people who love it."
Such is the profundity of Jim
Ferrell. the band's other
guitarist, who is a fourth year
med student here. He claims he
is addicted to heroin. Take that
as seriously as you want.
Ferrell. who has been playing
guitar off and on for 10 years, has
been the most creative element
of the band. He has written four
of the group's songs, including a
catchy tune called "Should I
Stay. Should I Go." (He has
another one titled "Song of
Grass and Snow." but I'm not
going to touch that one . . .)
Trading off
The interplay between Ferrell
and Pilon is one of the highlights
of the group's show. but the two
guitarists are modest about their
abilities.
"I've learned a lot from him
(Ferrell)," iilon said.
Ferrell said he learned stan
dard guitar technique in seventh
grade, but that Pilon "is learning
to play it the right way." Pilon
began teaching himself in 12th
grade.
As a result of this difference,
the two display unique — but
complementary — styles of play
on stage. Pilon. who relies
primarily on bending the strings
of his guitar during solos, has a
more free-flowing, Jerry
Garcia-like approach. Ferrell.
on the other hand, is more delib
erate and precise, though no less
creative.
"Double leads are really fun,"
Ferrell said. "We really try to lis
ten to each other."
The instrumental contingent
of the band is filled out by
drummer Tom Townshend, a
25-year-old engineer who lives
in the area.
But the greatest share of the
spotlight's glare falls on lead
vocalist Leslie Moulton, whose
full, lustv voice Is reminiscent of

something between Rickie Lee
Jones' and Janis Joplin's.
