# Home-grown bands: the campus crush
## 
### Brad Brockbank 
While the excitement of a new
generation of popular music has
captured the attention of rock
and roll devotees here, a home
grown band called Rooftop
Magic has begun to divert ear
drums toward the campus rock
scene.
As the band members them
selves are quick to tell you. Roof
top Magic isn't about to headline
the Keystone in the near future,
but the group has become the
most sought-after band for cam
pus parties and has even gained a
small-scale cult following.
Saturday night. Rooftop
Magic will be playing in Santa
Cruz, in only its fifth off-campus
gig. But in the wake of two \er\

successful shows two weeks ago
at Roble Hall and at the Stanford
A\gainst Conscription fundraiser,
the band has few worries about
this weekend's road trip.
"We seem to get a good reac
tion wherever we go." said
junior Jay Gitterman. the
keyboards player and quasi
manager of the group.
One part of the band's appeal
is its repertoire, most of which
consists of covers of new and old
rock'tunes by a diverse range of
artists. But all the songs have one
thing in common: they're good
to dance to. And as far as party
audiences are concerned, that's
what matters.
For the band members, there

are different reasons â€” not all of
them totally serious.
"I'm personally in it for the
money and the drugs." cracked
guitarist Chris Filon from behind
a wooly beard. "Actually, it is
nice to make some
money . . . but I've discovered
there's no such thing as a groupie
at Stanford." he added, smil
ing. Bassist Cole Case, how
ever. is more to the point about
his musical aspirations. The
energetic sophomore said he
would give just about anything
to be a successful musician,
quoting Mick Jagger's state
ment: "Show me a teen-age kid
who doesn't want to be a rock
and roll star, and I'll show von a

liar."
For all of them, however, en
joyment comes just from playing
songs they like and having other
people enjoy them. too.
"It's not much fun to play
music you love in front of people
who hate it and it's not much fun
to play music you hate in front ot
people who love it."
Such is the profundity of Jim
Ferrell. the band's other
guitarist, who is a fourth year
med student here. He claims he
is addicted to heroin. Take that
as seriously as you want.
Ferrell. who has been playing
guitar off and on for 10 years, has
been the most creative element
