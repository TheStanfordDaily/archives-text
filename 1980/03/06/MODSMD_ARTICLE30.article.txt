# Dorms go for fun: 'Let's put on a show'
##

| For some, it's a chance to be in
the limelight. For others, it's a
way to make new friends. And
for a few, it's a great excuse for
not doing any homework.
Auditions. Rehearsals. Cur-
Jtain calls. It's all part .of dormit
ory drama productions.
I "Since there's less expected of
lyou than of professional perfor
<mers, dorm productions are a
; great way to explore and create
and play around with drama,"
said one student.
Most who have been or are
currently involved in dorm pro
ductions agreed that the oppor
tunity is special.
"TTiere are people here who
don't really get into intramural
sports or clubs or committees,
and yet they want some sort of
activity which allows them to
work with other students and
create something," said Mark
Hosbein, a sophomore in Toyon.
"Dorm shows provide just the
right opportunity."
Hosbein is directing Toyon's
spring production of Hot L Bal
timore.
"What I like about dorm
shows is that they aren't part of
that vicious circle which you find
so often around the University:
where you can't do something
unless you've had previous ex
perience," said freshman Julia
Hosford, co-director of Bran
ner's upcoming production of
Sweet Charity.
Unity
Many students and adminis
trators said they felt that dorm
productions were one of the
most unifying experiences of
student dorm life. Yet despite
the enthusiasm which accom
panies these projects, it is often
very difficult to initiate them.
"We had auditions for the

musical Kismet earlier this year,"
said Caroline Williams, a resi
dent of Roble. "But no males
tried out. 1 guess it's difficult to
get excited about a rather un
familiar play — it's easier to be
enthusiastic about something
like Oklahoma, because more
people know of it."
Williams said that Roble will
not have a show this year. "We
considered doing South Pacific,
but that would have meant buy
ing another script, and it would
have taken too much time."
Craig Ueland, a housing as
sociate in Soto, said that there
probably won't be a production
in Soto this year.

Most. . . agreed that the opportunity is
special.

"We didn't find anyone who
wanted to direct a play," he said.
"No one had any experience at
that sort of thing.
"I guess it really takes a un
ique group of people to stick it
out and put in that much effort to
a project they really didn't come
to the University for," he added.
Those who participated in the
dorm events said that the fun of
putting together a production
outweighed the effort it re
quired.
"I think that because you live
with the people and know them
as friends, it isn't such a profes
sional thing," said Elizabeth Ho
ven, director of last weekend's
production of A Funny Thing
Happened On the Way to the
Forum in Burbank.
"Dorm productions are for
fun. Rehearsals provide a good
study break."
No experience
Because experience is not a
prerequisite for participation in

dorm productions, most of the
students are taking their first
dramatic steps.
" I had only directed a summer
camp play before," Hoven said.
"So one thing I had to rely on
was m> ability to get energy into
the group."
"At first you feel a little un
comfortable because you're new
at it," Hosbein said. " But pretty
soon, people start to get familiar
with the play, and everyone
helps each other out with lines
and all."
Hosbein said he felt the lack of
experience was an advantage.
"It's a challenge. You have to
try to get people who haven't

even read a script before to be
believable. And usually those
who are most successful are
those without any preconceived
ideas of what the character
should be," he said.
Old hands
But some students do bring
past experience to the produc
tions. Bonnie Messenger, one of
the leads in last weekend's pro
duction of Brigadoon at
Lagunita, had performed in high
school and is a member of Ram's
Head Review and various choral
groups.
"We had almost all had some
experience before," she said of
the show's cast. "But the nice
thing about dorm productions is
that perfection isn't demanded.
It's not as serious. We had a good
time — as good a time as ever
before."
But experienced or not, a
dorm production is a lot of work
for everybodv.

"You have to put in an aver
age of lour to five hours a week
for a couple of weeks if it's going
to come off well," said Donald
I anzer, an RA in Twain. In Ap
ril, Twain will present Free to Be
You and Me.
Tom Wood, who is directing
that production, said that he had
been working on it "constantly
since Christmas."
Hoven said the Burbank cast
rehearsed four times a week for
two hours for several weeks, and
the last week it was three hours
every night.
Funds
Funding for the dorm produc
tions usually comes from house
dues.
"Each resident fellow receives
'program funds' from the Office
of Residential Education at the
beginning of each year," said
Alice Supton of the Office of Re
sidential Education.
"Usually these funds are used
for the dorm productions and for
other projects. But since plays
are so important and are consi
dered such a good unifying ex
perience, there are occasions
when dorm funds can cover, say,
only the cost of a script. Then,
another chunk comes from stu
dent dues. Often, that is suffi
cient," she said.
Supton said that there are a
few instances where Res Ed is
petitioned for additional money,
which comes from a dean's fund
for support of programs.
Aside from buying the scripts,
additional costs are incurred for
costumes and lighting. A group
on campus called Under
graduate Lighting Project (ULP)
provides lighting for most dorm
productions plus technical ad
vice.
"Six or eight years ago, the Of

fice of Residential Education
gave us a grant to buy equip
ment," said Paul Lekowkze ol
ULP. "We now rent out equip
ment at 20 percent of the com
mercial rate. This allows dorm
groups to operate on a tight
budget."
Lekowkze said that ULP will
rent out to other dramaticgroups
on campus, such as the Company
or ASSU Special Events, but
that dorm productions have
highest priority.
Compromise
"We try to iron out conflicts in
scheduling between different
dorm productions," said
Lekowkze. "We sometimes
don't have enough equipment to
do two shows in the same
weekend."
Joining up
A group is being formed on
campus to help dorms put to
gether productions. The Theater
Guild is trying "to set up an or
ganization that dorms can come
to to ask, "what do we need and
how do we do it?" said Scooter
Mitchell, a senior who was in
volved in the formation of the
group.
"We would like to be a voice
for dorm productions on cam
pus," he said. "Hopefully we
could set up a costume bank and
lobby for rehearsal space for
dorm groups."
But, most students involved in
the productions emphasized that
they were not necessarily out to
learn technical aspects of drama
production, but rather were in
terested in the opportunity to
make friends and have fun.
"1 found that I became in
volved with a warm, unified
group of people," Messenger
said. "If you're down, someone
will give you some of their
energy and pick you up. My
whole group of friends changed.
