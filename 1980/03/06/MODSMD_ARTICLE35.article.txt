New offers made to guerrillas
BOGOTA, Colombia — The government of Colom
bia reportedly made counterproposals yesterday to the
leftist guerrillas who are holding 20 ambassadors and
other diplomats hostage in the Dominican Republic-
Embassy here.
Those proposals, according to three well-informed
sources, included an offer to safe conduct out of the
country for the guerrillas and their captives. The gov
ernment was believed to be offering to fly the guerrillas
and hostages to Algeria, Libya or Syria.
The sources said the government had turned down
suggestions that the guerrillas be flown to Mexico, Costa
Rica or Panama.
"The government is against letting them go anywhere
in the Western Hemisphere and is determined they will
not go to Panama because it's too close," one of the
sources said. "If they went to Panama (Colombia's
northern neighbor) they will be hack here in a week."
None of the sources said that the government had
indicated a willingness to free 311 political prisoners and
pay the guerrillas $50 million in ransom, as they have
demanded.
The government's offer was reportedly made at the
second round of talks between the two sides here yester
day morning. The talks went on for two hours and 18
minutes, with only a four-minute break.
A government communique last night said there
would be further meetings between the two sides, but did
not say where or when.
U.N. commission denied visit
The U.S. Embassy militants in Tehran adamantly re
buffed a new bid yesterday for a meeting between the
United Nations commission on Iran and the Americans
held hostage, despite Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
reported authorization for it. Iranian officials, just as
insistent, said the meeting would take place.
I low the showdown between the young Moslem radi
cals and the Iranian authorities would be resolved re
mained unclear, but one top official indicated Khomeini
would have to intervene more directly.
The militants said they were awaiting word from
Khomeini confirming his approval for such a meeting.
112 oreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, in an apparent
display ol anger and frustration over the militants'
stance, was quoted by the Tehran newspaper /I zadeghan
as saying "communists and Zionists" were trying to foil
the U.N. mission. This was an evident reference to leftist
elements among the militants.
It was the 123 rd day in captivity for the approximately
50 American hostages in the U.S. Embassy, and the 12th
day of the visit to Tehran by the U.N. panel, which is
charged with hearing Iranian grievances about alleged
crimes by the deposed shah and the United States in Iran
and with seeking a peaceful solution to the U.S.-Iran
crisis.
The Carter administration wants the five U.N. com
missioners — international lawyers and diplomats — to
visit all the hostages to determine their condition and
ensure that all are still in the embassy. The militants
contend such a visit would be turned to America's prop
aganda advantage.
Civiletti clamps down on leaks
WASH INGTON — Condemning "the flood of leaks"
from criminal investigations. Attorney General Benja
min Civiletti warned Justice Department employees in
two special meetings yesterday that he will fire anyone
caught disclosing confidential information.
In one of the more extensive and dramatic efforts in
recent years to stem leaks to the press, Civiletti appeared
twice in the Justice Department's Great I lall to deliver a
25-minute speech to about 800 employees.
In addition, he said videotapes and transcripts ot his
remarks were being sent to department offices around
the country.
He said his efforts were sparked by the leak of the
FBl's Abscam investigation of political corruption and
by two other leaks. Eight members of Congress have
been named by sources as being implicated in the
Abscam case, although no charges have been brought.
The two other cases are FBI investigation of insurance
rackets and organized crime, dubbed Brilab and Pendorl
respectively. There, tin), the names of potential defen
dants have been published before any charges have been
lodged.
Civiletti detailed the harm that leaks cause, methods
that reporters use to get them and ways of deflecting
inquiries by reporters. But he emphasized that he t elt it
proper lor reporters to try to get such information.
Rhodesia plans for new government
SALISBURY. Rhodesia — Prime Minister-designate
Robert Mugabe and fellow guerrilla leader Joshua
Nkomo agreed yesterday to form a coalition government
when Rhodesia becomes the independent nation ol
Zimbabwe probably later this month.
A spokesman for Mugabe, who won a landslide vic
tory in elections last week for a black-majority govern-

ment, said the two leaders met yesterday morning and
set up a working group of their two parties to determine
Cabinet positions and other details of the coalition.
Mugabe won 57 of the 80 seats in parliament while
Nkomo has 20.
The spokesman, Justin Nyoka, said Mugabe plans to
set up a national front government that would expand
the coalition of "co-opting" other elements. The pur
pose would be to arrange for a government that will
inspire confidence from all sectors of the community — a
code phrase for whites.
Since gaining his election victory earlier this week,
Mugabe has sought to reassure the 200,000 white minor
ity community.
New budget may lead to big deficit
WASHINGTON — The Congressional Budget Of
fice (CBO) estimated yesterday that President Jimmy
Carter's January budget proposals would produce a de
ficit between $24.6 billion and $30 billion next fiscal
year, not the $15.8 billion Carter projected.
The new figures mean it may be much harder than
previously thought for Congress to balance the budget,
as the White House and many lawmakers are now prop
osing.
The CBO also warned that the deficit for the current
year, fiscal 1980, is now likely to top $47 billion rather
than the $39.8 billion the administration estimated in
January. Only six months ago, it stood at $29.8 billion.
Alice Rivlin, the agency's director, said the higher
estimates for both years stem from newer inflation as
sumptions, soaring interest costs and added proposals
for defense spending and Medicare-Medicaid outlays.
The new estimates jolted congressional leaders, who
have been scurrying to find ways to cut existing spending
programs in the face of rising inflation and recent tur
moil in the financial markets.
Under Carter's estimates. Congress would have had to
cut $20 billion in spending to balance the 198 1 budget,
partly to offset the reduction in tax receipts that would
result from reduced federal outlays. The new figure
could be close to $30 billion.
El Salvador's junta nears collapse
MEXICO CITY — A key civilian in El Salvador's
fragile coalition government resigned Tuesday night,
raising speculation that the second U.S.-backed junta
within six months is on the brink of collapse.
The departure of Christian Democrat Hector Dada,
one of three civilians who formed the junta with two
Army colonels, comes as violence by extremists of the
left and right is approaching the proportions of full-scale
civil war.
The Christian Democrats have scheduled a Sunday
meeting to select a new junta member. But sources
contacted by telephone in San Salvador, the capital,
expect an open split between those who believe the party
should continue its participation in the civilian-military
junta, and those who want to quit.
Civilians in the first junta resigned en mass in January,
accusing the military of failing to permit implementation
of promised economic, social and political reforms. The
U.S. government has described the Christian Democ
rats' as El Salvador's "last hope" for averting civil war.
The party formed a new junta in January on the basis of a
reworked reform "pact" with the military but Dada
reportedly charged that the pact had been broken.
Three Mile Island gas vent debated
WASHINGTON — The Nuclear Regulatory Com
mission sent out strong signals yesterday that it will
permit radioactive gas to be vented from the Three Mile
Island nuclear power plant without waiting for comple
tion of an environmental impact statement.
The commissioners made it clear they are worried
about instruments and machinery that have been inside
the damaged reactor building without maintenance since
the accident March 28.
"You can't sit around here and calculate environmen
tal impact while we have a disaster waiting to happen in
central Pennsylvania," said Commissioner Joseph Hen
drie, pounding his first on the table.
He later said he was only expressing frustration with
the fact that an environmental impact statement on the
possible venting of radioactive gas and purging of con
taminated water would not be finished before the end of
the year.
"There is no clear and present danger." he said, "but
we should have been inside the containment to check the
condition of the primary system, to replace essential
instruments, and we should have done it two months
ago."
Tate signed to fight in Ali comeback
CHICAGO — Representatives of Muhammad Ali
and Top Rank, Inc. signed an agreement yesterday lor
the former heavyweight champion to fight World Boxing
Association champ John Tate in what would be Ali"s
comeback from retirement.
Bob Arum, president ol Top Rank, said the purse
would be a record sum and that the bout probably will be
held in late June.
Arum and Jabir Muhammad, Ali's manager, said the

pact was signed yesterday evening in Jabir Muhammad's
downtown offices. The manager said a formal contract
would be signed later.
He added that he had spoken by telephone with Ali,
who approved the action.
Neither Arum nor Muhammad would confirm reports
that the fighters would split $14 million.
"All I will say is that the compensation to both fighters
is a world record for any boxing match in history ," Arum
said.
Muhammad said locations discussed have included
Taiwan, New Orleans and Houston. The contest likely
will be on one of the last days in June, he added.
Saccharin-cancer risk ruled modest
WASHINGTON — A series of new medical reports
concludes that the saccharin-cancer scare of the 1970s
was overstated and that, except for certain special
groups, such as children, people who use modest
amounts of the artificial sweetener have "little cause for
concern" about cancer.
The studies major finding is that "there is no
saccharin-induced epidemic of bladder cancer in this
country," Dr. Robert Hoover, environmental studies
chief of the National Cancer Institute, says in today's
New England Journal of Medicine.
The dieter who uses a packet or two of saccharin a day
in coffee, or the diabetic who drinks diet drink, he adds,
"can be assured" that their excess risk of cancer, "if
present at all, is quite small and little cause for concern."
The main risk, it appears, is among children and
youths, heavy saccharin users or diet-drinkers, users
who smoke and women who are pregnant.
The NCI found a 60 percent increased risk among
"heavy" saccharin users — two or more eight-ounce diet
drinks or six or more servings a day of a sugar substitute.
Women, for example, who ordinarily have a yearly rate
of five cases of bladder cancer per 100,000 may have
eight cases with heavy saccharin use.
The same study found an unmeasurable degree of
increased risk among saccharin-using men who smoked
two or more cigarette packs daily, or women who
smokeed one or more.
A Food and Drug Administration official yesterday
said the FDA is doing nothing to prepare any anti
saccharin rules, though a congressional moratorium on
any I DA saccharin ban expired last May.
