# Baker drops out of race; Anderson support grows
## 
### 
From DaiK wire services
with staff reports
After twice finishing third and
twice finishing fourth, Sen.
Howard Baker dropped out ol
the chase for the Republican
presidential nomination yester
day . say ing that "it is prettv clear
that the campaign isn't going
am where."'
The Senate minority leader,
once considered by President
Jimmy Carter's political
strategists to be the Republicans'
strongest potential challenger,
bowed out ot competition only
hours after he had finished a
poor fourth in both the Vermont
and Massachusetts Republican
primaries Tuesday.
Now. the big new question in
Republican presidential politics
is where does the latest surprise
candidate. Rep. John Anderson,
go from here?
Anderson, the white-thatched
10-term congressman from
Rockford. III., upset the experts
I uesdav by scoring convincing
second-place finishes in the
Vermont and Massachusetts
primary elections.
On the Democratic side, the
results were about as expected,
with Carter beatinu Sen. Edward

Kennedy in Vermont and Ken
ned) winning in his home state of
Massachusetts. More bruising
battles are ahead, and observers
will watch closely to see il Carter
wins as strongly in his home state
of Georgia as Kennedy did in his.
A force
In Anderson's case, he came
within a whisker ol defeating
Ronald Reagan in Vermont and
George Hush in Massachusetts.
That did not exactly make the
5N-year-old Anderson an instant
front-runner. But it certainly
made him a force to be reckoned
with now as many Republicans
seem to be groping for a poten
tial White House winner and are
testing new political faces.
Meanwhile, a familiar face,
former President Gerald Ford,
talking to reporters in
I.auderhill. Ha., described the
GOP contest as "wide-open''
and once again hinted that he
would like to play.
There were informed reports
that Ford would decide on his
candidacy on or about March IS
the day ol the key Illinois
primary and just days before the
tiling deadlines for primaries in
such states as Maryland. Michi
gan. California and Ohio.

Anderson took his suddenly
successful campaign from Mas
sachusetts to Connecticut, vow
ing to embarrass Bush in the
March 25 primary in the state the
Massachusetts-born Texan con
siders his second home.
Reagan flew trom California
to Charleston, S C.. to resume
campaigning for Saturday's
South Carolina primary contest
against Bush and John Connally.
Reagan is favored in the race,
which Connally has made the
make-or-break test of his expen
sive but now financiallv strapped
effort.
The Stanford Students for
Baker "were saddened" that
their candidate withdrew from
the elections, remarked junior
Jim Gable. He commented that
it was unfortunate that Baker got
such a late start in the campaign
ing and that he probably would
have done better it the first
primaries had not been in New
England, lie added that without
momentum from the New Eng
land primaries, continuing the
campaign would not be worth
the amount ot money they would
have to raise.
Gable echoed Newar's opin
ion that many ol Baker's suppor
ters will probably switch to Bush
because both candidates are
moderate Republicans while
Reagan is conservative and An
derson is liberal, and that 1 ord's
actions will have a major effect
on the Republican nomination.
Support building
Since the Vermont and Mas
sachusetts primaries Anderson
has had an increase in support
across campus, according to sev -
eral of the congressman's sup
porters who met last night to or
ganize a tampus campaign
group. I here will be another
meeting tonight to organize stu
dents.
I hough those present said
they were not organized enough
to comment for the Anderson
group forming, they made sev
eral statements ol their own
opinions. All expressed their ex
citement about Andersons suc
cess in the last two primaries.
