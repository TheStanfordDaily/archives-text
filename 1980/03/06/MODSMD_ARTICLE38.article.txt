## USC, UCLA athletes given illegal credits 
### Kathy Kemby 
Although University of Southern Califor
nia athletes were caught receiv ing credit tor
classes they never did work for. and UCLA
football players were discovered claiming
units trom a college they never attended.
Andy Geiger, Stanford's athletic director,
says that Stanford's athletes have kept a
clean slate.
Last December, the USC Daily Trojan re
vealed that 34 Trojan athletes were going to
receive academic credit Mr classes they never
attended, and the Los Angeles limes re
ported UCLA's falsified transcripts.
These incidents are the latest in a series ot
occurrences that have caused Pacific-1" ath
letic programs to come under close public
scrutiny. It started last fall with the tinng ot
Arizona State University's football coach,
I rank Kush. and subsequent discov ery ot

unacceptable academic records ot several
Sun Devil athletes.
Cardinal athletes have nothing to hide in
the midst of these events, according to
Geiger.
The latest scandal at I SC occurred after a
disgruntled (JSC debater disclosed to the
Daily Trojan that several members ot the
football squad were enrolled in debate clas
ses thev did not attend. It was later learned
that other athletes, as well as a few non
athletes. were also falselv claiming credit for
the same debate classes.
Last February the I SC debate coach.
John Deßross. was forced to resign because
of his involvement. The athletic academic
advisor. Jeff Birren. is on temporary suspen
sion.
Birren will remain on suspension until "his
role in the situation is more clearly defined."
said Rich Bonin. Daily Trojan reporter. It

has still not been,determined whether or not
Birren ad\ ised the athletes to take these clas
ses. Bonin said, although Birren "denies the
accusations."
USC students reacted to the false credit
claiming attempt with anger about "the
favoritism shown." Bonin said, but they did
not want to "jeopardize the athletes." Ik
added that the athletes were allowed to get
credit for the debate classes after the Rose
Bowl by taking a five-day crash debate
course and watching six debates.
When asked to comment on the problem
ot student-athlete eligibility, Cieiger said that
there are strict rules of eligibility in athletics
that don't apply to most other extracurricular
acti\ itics.
(ieiger said that if an athlete here tails to
meet "normal progress" qualifications he is
required to stop out from competition for a
season until regaining eligibility.
