### Beth Harrison 
Following a year-long search, the Uni
\ ersity of Chicago Press has selected Stan
lord English department lecturer Barbara
Gelpi to he the new editor of its prestigi
ous womens quarterly. Signs, Journal o)
Women in Culture anil Society.
The journal will begin publishing here
in July, at the Center for Research on
Women (CROW) where Gelpi has re
cently been involved in research on the
lilesty le ot the Victorian Woman. Accord
ing to Gelpi. the relocation of the
magazine here demonstrates the growing
national recognition CROW is receiving
as a research center on women's issues
and is also indicative of the support the
University is willing to assure tor the
journal.
Gelpi said she is very excited about her

new position, adding that she is
"genuinely committed to women
oriented research." Although she said she
doesn't want to give up teaching to take
up the editorship, she plans to put aside
her research work lor a year, in order to
devote more time to learning the proce
dures of her job.
The effects the journal's move will have
i)n the Univ ersity are to establish CROW
as "one ot the foremost research centers"
in women's studies, and to make the ad
ministration here recognize women s
studies as a vital field, said Myra Strober,
director of CROW.
Strober agreed that working with Signs
will be exciting. CROW will directly be
hefit from the journal's relocation she
explained because it will have its "finger
on the pulse of current work being done"
in women's studies.

Gelpi said she believes Signs is an im
portant influence on the field of women's
studies as a whole. It provides a new
perspective on traditional issues, allowing
lor critiques of psychological theory, and
lor new readings of novels, she said.
There are not many women's studies
journals in existence, Gelpi said. She con
siders them an important part of a process
ol "radical" thinking — radical in the
sense of attacking the heart ol false as
sumptions.
Signs arrival at Stanford assures that a
vital forum lor women's issues will be
kept open, Gelpi said.
Signs was created as an interdiscipli
nary scholarly quarterly, representing the
humanities and social sciences. Its format
currently includes scholarly and opinion
essays, as well as book reviews, a yearly
outline of women-oriented research in

different fields, and "archives." or wo
men's history.
In July, when Gelpi officially assumes
editorship, she said she plans to incorpo
rate the present format ol the journal with
some ideas of her own. While preserving
its scholarly nature, Gelpi said she would
"try to demonstrate connections between
the disciplines."
Associate editors here who will be
working with Gelpi are: Estelle Freed
man, an associate professor ot history;
Carol Jacklin, a senior research associate
in psychology; Nan Kcohane, an associate
professor of political science; Shelley
Rosaldo, an associate professor of an
thropology; Myra Strober, an economist
and director ol CROW; and Margery
Wolf, an anthropologist and CROW af
filiate.
