# The 						time for all good men to...

### 
. . . come to the aid of their
country?
There is a good chance that by
next summer, a substantial
number of Stanford under
graduates will be called upon to
register with the Selective Ser
vice.
Some view this as a chance to
serve their country and to re
build America's depleted pride.
Others view it as the next step on
the road to World War 111.
We have decided to devote
this issue of the Stanford Daily
Magazine to a discussion of the
politics of the draft and how it
affects many of us as potential
draftees. We have done this for
two main reasons. First, we have
watched and questioned the ac
tivists and their issues. Second,
we have an awful lot of good
copy that should not be tossed
into the proverbial oval file.
Editors get annoyed about that
type of waste.
One of the most important fac
tors which we have tried to keep
in mind is that we are living in the
1980s and not the 19605. No
matter how tempting the
analogies may be, we are dealing
with different international is
sues and different circumstances.
Aside from the draft and re
gistration, this month's magazine

also features articles in an ex
tended entertainment section.
This should get your mind off
dead week and other potentially
lethal issues.
There are a number of people
who deserve our undying
gratitude for helping to put to
gether this magazine: Karen
Wada who put together a terrific
entertainment section despite
semi-ridiculous requests for
"white space"; Brad Brockbank,
Monika Guttman, Sam Howe,
Ron L.illejord and Seth Zucker
man who gave us both good copy
and a good deal of the initial im
petus to get this thing off the
ground.

A very patient back-shop, an
overworked photolab and the ef
forts of Dianne Cahoon and
Mary Lee MacKichan also de
serve credit.
Gary Reyna, thanks for the
great cover.
Last but not (perish the
thought) least, thanks to Bill
Burger tor all his help in
copyediting and overall moral
support. Our only question is
this: how could you be so foolish
as to let a couple of freshmen put
out this issue?
