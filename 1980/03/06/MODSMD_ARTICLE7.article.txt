# The 						politics of the draft
## Groups, profs debate registration issue 
### Sam Howe 
Standing at the counter in the
post office, you turn and glance
through the window at the
American flag flying crisply in
the breeze outside. Then you
turn back, asking for a roll of
stamps and your oversize mail.
While the postmaster finds the
mail for you, you look down at
the small card and, taking pen in
hand, you fill out your name and
address, birthdate and social
security number. As you take
your mail and you buy your
stamps, you hand over the card.
You're registered, if President
Jimmy Carter's current plan is
implemented.
To some, registration repre
sents nothing more than a simple
gesture, a small but painless
show of national solidarity.
To others, it represents a great
moral responsibility, a symbol to
the rest of the world of a country
standing strong and ready to pro
tect the cause of freedom and na
tional self-determination around
the globe.
And to still others, it repre
sents a national mistake, the first
step toward forced conscription
of the country's youth as part of a
deeply misguided sense of
America's role in the world.
Here at Stanford, debate
about registration and the draft
has been intense since
Carter called tor a re-
I sumption of compulsory regist-

ration for the draft in his State of
the Union address on Jan. 23.
Carter said the measure was a
response both to the Soviet Un
ion's invasion ( ,of neighboring
Afghanistan and to perceptions
of America's military weakness
abroad in light of the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Also. Carter said he wanted the
country to be prepared to defend
its "vital interests" around the
globe, such as Middle Eastern oil.
Immediately after the speech,
a torch-lit rally of about 100 stu
dents was organized to protest
the plan. And at noon the next
day, anti-draft activist and
former Stanford student body
president David Harris spoke at

a rally condemning registration,
calling it "in effect, conscrip
tion."
The two rallies were organized
by anti-draft groups on campus,
the strongest of which has
emerged as Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC). In the fol
lowing month. SAC sponsored
numerous meetings and discus
sed plans ranging from teach-ins
to non-violence training clinics.
One hundred people attended a
SAC meeting less than two days
after the Carter speech, and
some 160 people showed up at
an organizational gathering a
few days later.
But there has also emerged
another group, in favor of the
call to registration and suppor
tive of the president's foreign
policy actions. Calling itself
Stanford Against Soviet Aggres
sion, the group formed im
mediately after Harris' speech to
protest "overreaction" and the
symbolic burning of a draft card
facsimile at that eveijt. The
group hn!> met on an average of
once every two weeks and has
approximately 30 members, or
ganizers say.
"A tide iif emotionalism is
sweeping the campus," says
Peter Pierce, co-chair of the
anti-aggression group. "Ap
peasement is no way to world
peace. We support Carter's firm
stand As a show of solidarity in
this time of national dilemma."
Members of SAC are reluctant

to make statements for the group
as a whole, due to a decen
tralized organizational nature
and a variety of opinions within
the group about just how to op
pose the draft.
"We are fairly heterogenous,
and we have no one position
about an analysis of the situation
or a moral position," said Micah
Beck, a member of SAC's media
collective.
However, Beck did say that
the group was united in mem
bers' opposition to the draft, and
that "most people (in the group)
are opposed specifically to re
gistration" in its relation to the
draft.
The issue became even more

emotional here just two weeks
ago, when the ASSU Senate de
cided by a single vote to adopt a
resolution opposing the registra
tion plan.
The wording of the resolution
said that "we as senators should
act as leaders of student opinion
in the absence of a clear student
consensus." However, many
here were angry that despite an
ASSU-commissioned poll which
showed a student body equally
divided on the issue and a razor
thin majority in the senate itself,
the results of the vote would be
used nationwide to indicate that
the Stanford student body op
posed Carter's plans.
The ASSU poll showed 47
percent of students here for re
gistration and 47 against. A
forum held Feb. 11, two nights
before the Senate meeting, had
yielded quite different results.
At the New England-style town
hall meeting attended by 500
people, 90 percent said they op
posed registration. Seventy-one
percent said they would not re
gister if required to do so. How
ever, critics of those results cited
a clear anti-registration bias of
the speakers at the forum.
A third poll, conducted by the
Daily the weekend after Carter's
speech, showed S»S percent of
undergraduates opposed to re
gistration and 32 in favor. How
ever, 75 percent in that survey
said they would register if re
quired. Seventy-four percent
said they would in the ASSU
poll.
Meanwhile, the University
administration will not take any
official position on the matter,
and claims that it would have
great difficulty doing so, al
though University President
Richard Lyman said that he sees
response to the registration call
as a "huge mess of overreac
tion."
Lyman has also said that he
does not see many of the anti
draft protests as "constructive,"
that he opposes student defer
ments and that the University
would comply with the law in re
leasing information on stude its
should it loecome necessary
under registration.
University Registrar Sally
Mahoney has spoken in favor of
registering women for the draft
should Carter's request be ap
proved by Congress. But she said
she is not in favor of registration
for anyone at this time.

Another visible administra
tion figure, Admissions Dean
Fred Hargadon, said he is op
posed to the registration of wo
men, although he has not taken a
position on registration itselt.
"This does not mean I don't
think women are equal, but
equal for me means different
things in different situations."
Hargadon said.
How did it all come about?
Debate about the draft is cer
tainly not new to the Stanford
campus. There have been vari
ous hills circulating in Congress
during the past few years calling
either for a return to selective
service registration or to the
draft itself. At Stanford, debate
has been especially strong be
cause Congressman Pete
McCloskey, who represents the
University's district, has au
thored a National Youth Service
Bill, under which all persons in
the country, at the age of IS,
would be required to choose be
tween military and non-military
options in service to the nation.
The anti-draft group SAC was
alive last year, although there
were only about 20 members,
according to organizers.
However, the issue literally
flared overnight when the presi
dent, who had previously stated
his opposition to registration
plans, reversed his position and
called for the authority to re
vitalize the Selective Service sys
tem and thereafter begin regist
ration.
Under the recently outlined
Carter plan, all men and women
born in 1960 and 1961 would be
required to register for the draft
later this year. In future years,
youths would be required to re
gister when they reach their 1 8th
birthday.
The proposal has set to be
voted on in Congress, although
several congressional leaders,
including House Speaker lip
O'Neill, have stated that it is very
likely that the call for women will
not be approved, and that the
plan for men is in trouble as well.
SAC found itself rejuvenated
after the president's speech. I he
160 people at the Jan. 2 4 > organi
zational meeting broke into 15
"collectives." each of which is
responsible lor one phase ol the
group s activity, l or instance,
some who are now members ol
the SAC "media collective"
were largely responsible for the
fact that some IS newspapers,
tour television and three radio
stations covered the anti
registration rally a few days after
Carter's speech, although the
collective had not specifically
been formed by that date.
\t the ralk anti-war activist

Daniel Ellsberg. an ASSU guest
professor last spring, lashed out
at Carter's plans and at the threat
of nuclear war, telling his audi
ence of more than 1000 not to he
"cogs in a doomsday machine."
SAC recently sponsored a
class in non-violent protest
techniques. Instructor Liza
Catanzarite, a senior here, said
she sees "non-violent protest as
an active means of protest that
keeps the means in line with the
ends .... If the end that you're
Irving for is non-violent, peace
ful. you can't use a violent means
to achieve it.'"
SAC will be holding a "SAC
lunch." an anti-draft teach-in,
today at noon in White Plaza. In
addition, the group, along with
Women Against War. the Stan
ford Peace Collective and other
groups, will be sponsoring a
Peace Week, scheduled for the
first week in spring quarter.
Again, SAC members say that
there are many reasons for op
posing the draft, ranging from
"the moral to the political and
pragmatic," according to a
statement by the group.
The statement does mention
that registration is unnecessary
because it is unlikely that the
Soviet move into Afghanistan is
the beginning of a major push to
the Persian Gulf. Further, the
group mentions registration as
an attempt by Carter to change
his political fortunes, and as part
of an attempt by defense-related
industries to shift public opinion
in favor of higher defense ex
penditures.
Students Against Soviet Ag
gression. on the other hand, say
they are "in favor" of the regist
ration plan, according to co
chair Pierce. However, the group
lias taken no position on a return
to the peacetime draft.
" A lot of people basically ag
reed rather strongly with Presi
dent Carter after the invasion of
Afghanistan, and were upset that
the only political activity on
campus (seemed to be) protest
ing against registration." Pierce
said.
The group has written the
White House in support of the
president's actions, and plans to
ask someone from the Carter
administration to come to speak
at Stanford.
Pierce said the group supports
the president on the call lor re
gistration. for increase in defense
expenditures, for an embargo ot
grain shipments to the Soviet
I'nion, and for a boycott ot he
Summer Olympic (iamc v in
Moscow. Pierce also said lie ■ es
registration as a viable iv n
nuclear deterrent to the Sovi> s.
A beefing up ol the mil it ry


The Stanford Libertarian party is one of several groups which have emerged to oppose
'Carter's call for re-activation of Selective Service.

represents a response to two is
sues, according to Pierce. The
first is Soviet aggression and the
second is the need for a U.S. de
fense of its "vital interests." The
United States will not soon he
come self-sufficient in the energy
field, and will continue to rely on
oil from the Persian Gulf.
Further, its Western European
and Japanese allies are greatly
dependent on the oil. Pierce said.
Pierce added that he believes,
to some extent, in a "Wilsonian
foreign policy," whereby
America has a "moral commit
ment" to defend other countries
unable to exercise their right of
self-determination.
The group takes no official
stance on Carter's re-election.
Pierce said he was "indignant"
about the ASSU Senate vote op
posing registration, calling the
decision "irresponsible" with a
campus so divided on the issue.
The Stanford Libertarians are
closely allied with SAC in their
position on registration.
"We will absolutely oppose
the reinstatement of registration
or conscription and (we will) call
lor a mass resistance to such ac
tions. Every person owns his own
life and the choice is simple: it
belongs to you or to the state,"
said Scott Olmsted, coordinator
of the Libertarians.
Another anti-draft group.
Women Against War. was
formed here on the day of the
David Harris rally. It consists of
about 15 to 20 people, according
to Laura Key, an organizer.
"We believe there should be
no draft, no registration, for
women or men. now or at any
time. A demand for equal rights
and responsibilities does not
mean that we have an equal re
sponsibility to serve in an irres
ponsible war," said a statement
prepared by the group the
weekend after Carter's address.
"We will not stand by and let a
handful ol overgrown little hoys,
be they American or Soviet, take
charge and determine the course
of our lives or threaten us with
the destruction of our species. As
women, our fundamental value
is the giving, growth and preser
vation of life, not its destruc
tion." the statement continued.
Division on the draft issue
characterizes the faculty here as
well as students.
"I don't think that President
Carter wants to intervene: it's a
part of signalling toughness to
the Russians, and will stimulate
developments that they'd rather
not see take place." said Ale
xander George, professor of
political science.
But another political scientist,.
Prof. Hubert Marshall, said lie
sees no connection between the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
-and the need to reinstitute regist
ration. "Carter was trying to pro
ject an image. People want the
feeling that there is a strong hand
on the tiller. He's trying to tell us
that John Wayne is back in the
White House." Marshall called
the registration plan "unneces
sary" and "irrelevant."
Assoc. Prof, of History Paul
Seaver said. "The psychological
impact is tremendous. If the ad
ministration wants to signal that
the Cold War is back, they cer
tainly have done it in a dramatic
way."
Peter Schwartz of SRI Inter
national has said that the Persian
Chill region is not essential to the
United States, since only 7 to S
percent ol America's total
energy supply comes from there.
"Roughly ViS percent of the
population wants to ask 2 per
cent to die lor their extravagance
. . . There are some things worth
lighting for. and these include
justice and personal liberty, but
they do not include air
conditioners and hair dryers," he
said before receiving a standing

ovation at the ASSU town-hall
forum on registration and the
draft.
History Prof. Alexander Dal
lin said he opposes registration at
this time, hut that he could "'vis
ualize situations that necessitate
a draft," for instance an emerg
ing new Soviet leadership which
desired to "push outward and to
push forward."
Another historian, Assoc.
Prof. Barton Bernstein, has said
that the United States should
openly condemn the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan, but that "we
need not and should not see it as
a threat to the United States"
necessitating a military response.
•'lt's time to think once more
about resisting," according to
Bernstein, to possibly "save
yourself, other Americans and
those abroad."
Roger Pilon. a national fellow
at the Hoover Institution, said at
the town-hall forum that the best
policy for the United States to
pursue in order to gain credibil
ity with the Soviets and with U.S.
allies is to maintain a strong vol
unteer force through financial
inducement, not to implement
registration.
Again. University President
Richard Lyman takes no official
stand on the registration issue,
although he said he does con
sider himselt "not an enthusiast
lor the draft." But Lyman has
also said that "many more
Americans will find it easy to see
maintaining access to Middle
Eastern oil as a vital American
interest than found it easy to see
why the war in Southeast Asia
made any sense."
has also said. "People
will be making a mistake if they
assume that the country's re
sponse to college protests will be
as sympathetic as it often was to
the Vietnam protests.
All of this seems to say a lot,
but nothing definitive, about
campus reaction to President
Carter's call for registration.
However, from the tangled
webs of all the speeches and sur
\eys a lew strands of conclusion
stand to be drawn.
First, almost all students and
professors seem solid 111 opposi
tion to a return to the dralt at the
present time. McCloskey's Na
tional Youth Service Bill seems
to ha\ e made few friends as well.
At the same time, many feel a
deep indignance at the Afghanis
tan invasion. Difference comes
over how to respond to that
event. While some see registra
tion as a viable deterrent in and
of itself to Soviet aggression, and
a firm show ol national solidar
ity. others see it as an unneces
sary and irrelevant move or.
worse, a move which can only
lead inevitably to conscription
and heightened chances of war.
Some believe such a war could
remain free of nuclear conflict:
others see nuclear holocaust in
such a situation as unavoidable.
Some see that the real prob
lem in America, and in the
world, is a dangerous and still
growing dependence on oil from
an unstable Persian Gulf region
in the Middle East. In David
Harris' words, "our real weak
ness is on the freeway" and not in
our military posture. To these
people, conservation and the
road to energy self-reliance
make up the real issue. To
others. America must be strong
and willing to defend "vital in
terests'" around the globe.
Some see an America with a
moral commitment to the cause
ol national self-determination
around the globe. Others are
neo-isolationists. who wish to
avoid the possibility of a war re
gardless of all other costs.
About the immediate issue of
registration itself, all that can de
finitely be said is that there is a
deep division. Two reliable polls
here show a student body evenly
deadlocked on the issue, and a
national Gallup poll of 18- to
24-year-olds yielded a similar
result IN percent for to 47
percent against registration.
But more than anything, de
spite the claims of campus or
ganizations that there ;ire large
numbers of students on their
side, there seems to he a "wait
and-see" attitude among many
students. To them and to others
in this silent but uncertain major
ity at thousands of college cam
puses across the nation, world
developments must become
clearer before decisions can lie
made.
Perhaps what is to be hoped
was best summed up by COP
member Sibby 112 reeman before
the town-hall meeting here,
freeman called tor "a high
quality debate, accurate infor
mation. hard questions. We want
to see people ask tough ques
tions about what this country is
all about."
