# The
						politics of the draft
## Groups, profs debate registration issue 
### Sam Howe 
Standing at the counter in the
post office, you turn and glance
through the window at the
American flag flying crisply in
the breeze outside. Then you
turn back, asking for a roll of
stamps and your oversize mail.
While the postmaster finds the
mail for you, you look down at
the small card and, taking pen in
hand, you fill out your name and
address, birthdate and social
security number. As you take
your mail and you buy your
stamps, you hand over the card.
You're registered, if President
Jimmy Carter's current plan is
implemented.
To some, registration repre
sents nothing more than a simple
gesture, a small but painless
show of national solidarity.
To others, it represents a great
moral responsibility, a symbol to
the rest of the world of a country
standing strong and ready to pro
tect the cause of freedom and na
tional self-determination around
the globe.
And to still others, it repre
sents a national mistake, the first
step toward forced conscription
of the country's youth as part of a
deeply misguided sense of
America's role in the world.
Here at Stanford, debate
about registration and the draft
has been intense since
Carter called tor a re-
I sumption of compulsory regist-

ration for the draft in his State of
the Union address on Jan. 23.
Carter said the measure was a
response both to the Soviet Un
ion's invasion ( ,of neighboring
Afghanistan and to perceptions
of America's military weakness
abroad in light of the seizure of
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.
Also. Carter said he wanted the
country to be prepared to defend
its "vital interests" around the
globe, such as Middle Eastern oil.
Immediately after the speech,
a torch-lit rally of about 100 stu
dents was organized to protest
the plan. And at noon the next
day, anti-draft activist and
former Stanford student body
president David Harris spoke at

a rally condemning registration,
calling it "in effect, conscrip
tion."
The two rallies were organized
by anti-draft groups on campus,
the strongest of which has
emerged as Stanford Against
Conscription (SAC). In the fol
lowing month. SAC sponsored
numerous meetings and discus
sed plans ranging from teach-ins
to non-violence training clinics.
One hundred people attended a
SAC meeting less than two days
after the Carter speech, and
some 160 people showed up at
an organizational gathering a
few days later.
But there has also emerged
another group, in favor of the
call to registration and suppor
tive of the president's foreign
policy actions. Calling itself
Stanford Against Soviet Aggres
sion, the group formed im
mediately after Harris' speech to
protest "overreaction" and the
symbolic burning of a draft card
facsimile at that eveijt. The
group hn!> met on an average of
once every two weeks and has
approximately 30 members, or
ganizers say.
"A tide iif emotionalism is
sweeping the campus," says
Peter Pierce, co-chair of the
anti-aggression group. "Ap
peasement is no way to world
peace. We support Carter's firm
stand As a show of solidarity in
this time of national dilemma."
Members of SAC are reluctant

to make statements for the group
as a whole, due to a decen
tralized organizational nature
and a variety of opinions within
the group about just how to op
pose the draft.
"We are fairly heterogenous,
and we have no one position
about an analysis of the situation
or a moral position," said Micah
Beck, a member of SAC's media
collective.
However, Beck did say that
the group was united in mem
bers' opposition to the draft, and
that "most people (in the group)
are opposed specifically to re
gistration" in its relation to the
draft.
The issue became even more

emotional here just two weeks
ago, when the ASSU Senate de
cided by a single vote to adopt a
resolution opposing the registra
tion plan.
The wording of the resolution
said that "we as senators should
act as leaders of student opinion
in the absence of a clear student
consensus." However, many
here were angry that despite an
ASSU-commissioned poll which
showed a student body equally
divided on the issue and a razor
thin majority in the senate itself,
the results of the vote would be
used nationwide to indicate that
the Stanford student body op
posed Carter's plans.
The ASSU poll showed 47
percent of students here for re
gistration and 47 against. A
forum held Feb. 11, two nights
before the Senate meeting, had
yielded quite different results.
At the New England-style town
hall meeting attended by 500
people, 90 percent said they op
posed registration. Seventy-one
percent said they would not re
gister if required to do so. How
ever, critics of those results cited
a clear anti-registration bias of
the speakers at the forum.
A third poll, conducted by the
Daily the weekend after Carter's
speech, showed SÂ»S percent of
undergraduates opposed to re
gistration and 32 in favor. How
ever, 75 percent in that survey
said they would register if re
quired. Seventy-four percent
said they would in the ASSU
poll.
Meanwhile, the University
administration will not take any
official position on the matter,
and claims that it would have
great difficulty doing so, al
though University President
Richard Lyman said that he sees
response to the registration call
as a "huge mess of overreac
tion."
Lyman has also said that he
does not see many of the anti
draft protests as "constructive,"
that he opposes student defer
ments and that the University
would comply with the law in re
leasing information on stude its
should it loecome necessary
under registration.
University Registrar Sally
Mahoney has spoken in favor of
registering women for the draft
should Carter's request be ap
proved by Congress. But she said
she is not in favor of registration
for anyone at this time.

Another visible administra
tion figure, Admissions Dean
Fred Hargadon, said he is op
posed to the registration of wo
men, although he has not taken a
position on registration itselt.
"This does not mean I don't
think women are equal, but
equal for me means different
things in different situations."
Hargadon said.
How did it all come about?
Debate about the draft is cer
tainly not new to the Stanford
campus. There have been vari
ous hills circulating in Congress
during the past few years calling
either for a return to selective
service registration or to the
draft itself. At Stanford, debate
has been especially strong be
cause Congressman Pete
McCloskey, who represents the
University's district, has au
thored a National Youth Service
Bill, under which all persons in
the country, at the age of IS,
would be required to choose be
tween military and non-military
options in service to the nation.
The anti-draft group SAC was
alive last year, although there
were only about 20 members,
according to organizers.
However, the issue literally
flared overnight when the presi
dent, who had previously stated
his opposition to registration
plans, reversed his position and
called for the authority to re
vitalize the Selective Service sys
tem and thereafter begin regist
ration.
Under the recently outlined
Carter plan, all men and women
born in 1960 and 1961 would be
required to register for the draft
later this year. In future years,
youths would be required to re
gister when they reach their 1 8th
birthday.
The proposal has set to be
voted on in Congress, although
several congressional leaders,
including House Speaker lip
O'Neill, have stated that it is very
likely that the call for women will
not be approved, and that the
plan for men is in trouble as well.
SAC found itself rejuvenated
after the president's speech. I he
160 people at the Jan. 2 4 > organi
zational meeting broke into 15
"collectives." each of which is
responsible lor one phase ol the
group s activity, l or instance,
some who are now members ol
the SAC "media collective"
were largely responsible for the
fact that some IS newspapers,
tour television and three radio
stations covered the anti
registration rally a few days after
Carter's speech, although the
collective had not specifically
been formed by that date.
\t the ralk anti-war activist

Daniel Ellsberg. an ASSU guest
professor last spring, lashed out
at Carter's plans and at the threat
of nuclear war, telling his audi
ence of more than 1000 not to he
"cogs in a doomsday machine."
SAC recently sponsored a
class in non-violent protest
techniques. Instructor Liza
Catanzarite, a senior here, said
she sees "non-violent protest as
an active means of protest that
keeps the means in line with the
ends .... If the end that you're
Irving for is non-violent, peace
ful. you can't use a violent means
to achieve it.'"
SAC will be holding a "SAC
lunch." an anti-draft teach-in,
today at noon in White Plaza. In
addition, the group, along with
Women Against War. the Stan
ford Peace Collective and other
groups, will be sponsoring a
Peace Week, scheduled for the
first week in spring quarter.
Again, SAC members say that
there are many reasons for op
posing the draft, ranging from
"the moral to the political and
pragmatic," according to a
statement by the group.
The statement does mention
that registration is unnecessary
because it is unlikely that the
Soviet move into Afghanistan is
the beginning of a major push to
the Persian Gulf. Further, the
group mentions registration as
an attempt by Carter to change
his political fortunes, and as part
of an attempt by defense-related
industries to shift public opinion
in favor of higher defense ex
penditures.
Students Against Soviet Ag
gression. on the other hand, say
they are "in favor" of the regist
ration plan, according to co
chair Pierce. However, the group
lias taken no position on a return
to the peacetime draft.
" A lot of people basically ag
reed rather strongly with Presi
dent Carter after the invasion of
Afghanistan, and were upset that
the only political activity on
campus (seemed to be) protest
ing against registration." Pierce
said.
The group has written the
White House in support of the
president's actions, and plans to
ask someone from the Carter
administration to come to speak
at Stanford.
Pierce said the group supports
the president on the call lor re
gistration. for increase in defense
expenditures, for an embargo ot
grain shipments to the Soviet
I'nion, and for a boycott ot he
Summer Olympic (iamc v in
Moscow. Pierce also said lie â  es
registration as a viable iv n
nuclear deterrent to the Sovi> s.
A beefing up ol the mil it ry


The Stanford Libertarian party is one of several groups which have emerged to oppose
'Carter's call for re-activation of Selective Service.
