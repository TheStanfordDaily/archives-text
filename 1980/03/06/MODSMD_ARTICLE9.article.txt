# Foreign military service
## Conscription varies by time and place 
### Ken Kurosu 
I magi ne an option of two years
service in the army or three years
in the navy, air force, or special
forces; then 30 years of active
reserve status with annual or
semi-annual training sessions.
Every year millions of men
and women around the world in
their late teens or early 20s con
sider such options. Some wil
lingly enter armed service,
others hope lor a stroke of luck
so that they may he spared the
hardships of military life. Still
others have no choice.
From the French Revolution
to modern times, wars have been
won. colonies occupied, enemies
subdued and neighbors
threatened through conscripted
mass military forces. The
technological advancements ot
the 18th and 19th centuries
dramatically increased the milit
ary manpower needs of emerg
ing nation-states.
As the destructive capabilities
of weaponry rose, casualties
leaped and conscripts were used
to fill the ranks of the dying. Im
proved communication and the
revolutionary development of
shipping and air transport ena
bled colonial powers to extend
their military presence across
vast areas ol land mass tar from
home, given the existence of the
conscripted mass army.
Imperialist powers, socialist
nations and even colonies linked
the right to citizenship with an
obligation to serve in the milit
ary.
World War II climaxed the
development of mass con
scripted forces, as both the Al
lied and Axis powers employed
draftees in unprecedented num
bers to battle for the establish
ment of a new world order.
Yet since 1945, this new
global order, coupled with the
technological leaps of the nuc
lear age. have altered the re
quirements ot modern armed
forces in many advanced nations,
away from the reserve mass ot
manpower which the draft pro
vides.
As the European powers re
linquished control of colonies,
the need for occupying forces
have virtually disintegrated
overnight.
"Manpower comparisons are
not felt to be particularly valu
able and we no longer attempt
such comparison." the Interna
tional Institute for Strategic
Studies (ISS). a London based
research institute wrote in its
1 979 annual report on the global
military balance.
As nuclear weapons and
long-range missiles replaced
strength in manpower as the key
strategic category, large armies
were turned into cumbersome
economic liabilities and possible
centers for organized discontent
and rebellion.
More than 60 nations continue
to operate some system of com
pulsory military service, be it
through universal conscription
or a selective service system.
Yet. by the time the all
volunteer army was proposed in
the United States by President
Richard Nixon before the 1968
elections, many of the advanced
industrialized nations had al
ready abolished conscription or
moved toward greater emphasis

on the professional volunteer
elements in their armed forces.
By 1960 Great Britain had
ended conscription, climaxing a
process begun with the erosion
of the British empire, and the
new strategic reliance on the
American nuclear umbrella.
Canada followed the British
lead and shifted to a volunteer
force m the late 19505.
Japan, on the strength ol its
"peace constitution" which re
nounced the right to initiate war.
maintains only a "self-defense
force" consisting entirely of vol
unteers.
"I have never thought of a
draft as hav ing a direct impact on
myself." Ken Hodo, a sopho
more from Japan said. "Japan
lias gone in a different direction
since 1945."
"It may be necessary for the
United States to have a draft but
not for Japan." he said. If Japan
were to institute a selective ser
vice system, "I would try to find a
way to get out of serv ing," Hodo
said.
West Germany and France re
tain selective service systems and
meet approximately half of their
military manpower needs
through conscripts. Yet through
the use of numerous exemptions
and reduced serving time, they
have deemphasized the role ot
the conscript in their military es
tablishments.
Currently most NATO allies
ol the United States which have
selective service systems have
service durations of eight months
to two years.
The Warsaw Pact nations, on
the other hand, led by the Soviet
Union, continue to rely heavily
on the conscription system to fill
defense and occupation needs.
Soviet males are generally in
ducted at age 19 and serve for
two years in the army and air
force or two to three years in the
navy or as border guards. Nearly
two-thirds of the Warsaw pact's
troops are conscripts, according
to the 1979 ISS report.
The use of conscription in
Third World nations corres
ponds roughly to the degree of
internal stability and regional
tension in any given nation's en
vironment. Many nations main
tain a draft to till military ranks,
but do not rely on a conscripted
mass army for a high degree ol
military preparedness.
"The country is not in a dif
ficult situation militarily and so
the military does a lot ol work tor
the government and work in the
fields." said Faustin Yao. a
graduate student in communica
tions from the Ivory Coast.
Every 18-year-old male must
register for conscription in the
Ivory Coast, according to Yao.
Exemptions and deferments are
then granted on the basis ot mar
ital status, education and physi
cal fitness, he said.
"I spent a month and a hall in
the military before college and
expect to spend a year alter I
finish school, he said. " I did re
sent it and still do."
In Southeast Asia, the
ASEAN (Association ol South
east Asian Nations)nations, with
the exception of Malaysia, all re
quire some military service ol
their citizens, partially to combat
the internal security threats and
insurgencies which threaten the
very stability of their govern

ments.
Many Latin American nations
also use conscripts, possibly in
accordance with the expanded
governmental role of the military
regimes. Brazil, Bolivia and
Argentina all require one year of
service for conscripts.
In the Middle East, an area
plagued by Arab-Israeli conflict,
the volatile events of the Persian
Gulf region and the nearby con
flicts on the Horn of Africa,
nearly all nations maintain a
compulsory military service sys
tem. to help insure rapid mobili
zation in the case of emergency.
Israel remains unique among
American allies for the institu
tion of a universal conscription
system in which virtually all able
adults are required to serve.
Through a rigorous conscription
sy stem coupled with an extensive
reserve network, Israel's
165,000-strong military is man
ned by nearly 130,000 conscripts
and can mobilize approximately
400,000 within 24 hours.
Nevertheless, some Israelis
view compulsory military service
as an unfair burden.
"I don't see why citizenship
should be connected with ser
vice." said John Rosenblum, an
Israeli student in civil engineer
ing. The decision to serve should
be part of a choice, he said.
"If people don't want to serve
in the army, it means somehow
they aren't identifying with the
political goals," he said. For
example, "there are many
people who feel they want to
serve but not in the occupied ter
ritories." he said. Rosenblum
served for three years in the Is
raeli Defense Forces under Is
rael's compulsory service sys
tem, and was called up for six
months of emergency duty in the
1M73 Arab-Israeli war.
"The popular conception of
the Israeli woman, weapon in
hand, as an equal in combat with
her male comrades is based more
on myth than reality." wrote
Martin Binkin and Shirley Back
in their book Women and the
Military. "Women's participa
tion in the armed forces has re
cently been restricted to the
more traditional roles that are
less battle-oriented."
Israel's compulsory service
system is noted particularly for
its induction of women. While
women do have greater oppor
tunity to obtain exemptions and
dfermcnts than men. the laws
applying to men and women are
similar.
Nevertheless. Western images
ol the role of women in the Is
raeli Defense Forces may be
somewhat distorted.
Nava Rosenblum. an Israeli
woman who served for 20
months in the armed services,
said there is a separate hierarchy
for women in the Israeli military.
"I don't Â»hi nk the image of serv
ing equally is very accurate." she
said.
As the 19N0s usher in a new
era in technological warfare and
a new view of female roles in soc
iety. many more nations will
probably face the debate over
the induction of women into the
armed forces, as the United
States is doing now.
I magi ne an option of two years

military preparedness.
"The country is not in a dif
ficult situation militarily and so
the military does a lot ol work tor
the government and work in the
fields." said Faustin Yao. a
graduate student in communica
tions from the Ivory Coast.
Every 18-year-old male must
register for conscription in the
Ivory Coast, according to Yao.
Exemptions and deferments are
then granted on the basis ot mar
ital status, education and physi
cal fitness, he said.
"I spent a month and a hall in
the military before college and

In Southeast Asia, the
ASEAN (Association ol South
east Asian Nations)nations, with
the exception of Malaysia, all re
quire some military service ol
their citizens, partially to combat
the internal security threats and
insurgencies which threaten the
very stability of their govern

ments.
Many Latin American nations
also use conscripts, possibly in
accordance with the expanded
governmental role of the military
regimes. Brazil, Bolivia and
Argentina all require one year of
service for conscripts.
In the Middle East, an area
plagued by Arab-Israeli conflict,
the volatile events of the Persian
Gulf region and the nearby con
flicts on the Horn of Africa,
nearly all nations maintain a
compulsory military service sys
tem. to help insure rapid mobili
zation in the case of emergency.
Israel remains unique among
American allies for the institu
tion of a universal conscription
system in which virtually all able
adults are required to serve.
Through a rigorous conscription
sy stem coupled with an extensive
reserve network, Israel's
165,000-strong military is man
ned by nearly 130,000 conscripts
and can mobilize approximately
400,000 within 24 hours.
Nevertheless, some Israelis
view compulsory military service
as an unfair burden.
"I don't see why citizenship
should be connected with ser
vice." said John Rosenblum, an
Israeli student in civil engineer
ing. The decision to serve should
be part of a choice, he said.
"If people don't want to serve
in the army, it means somehow
they aren't identifying with the
political goals," he said. For
example, "there are many
people who feel they want to
serve but not in the occupied ter
ritories." he said. Rosenblum
served for three years in the Is
raeli Defense Forces under Is
rael's compulsory service sys
tem, and was called up for six
months of emergency duty in the
1M73 Arab-Israeli war.
"The popular conception of
the Israeli woman, weapon in
hand, as an equal in combat with
her male comrades is based more
on myth than reality." wrote
Martin Binkin and Shirley Back
in their book Women and the
Military. "Women's participa
tion in the armed forces has re
cently been restricted to the
more traditional roles that are
less battle-oriented."
Israel's compulsory service
system is noted particularly for
its induction of women. While
women do have greater oppor
tunity to obtain exemptions and
dfermcnts than men. the laws
applying to men and women are
similar.
Nevertheless. Western images
ol the role of women in the Is
raeli Defense Forces may be
somewhat distorted.
Nava Rosenblum. an Israeli
woman who served for 20
months in the armed services,
said there is a separate hierarchy
for women in the Israeli military.
"I don't Â»hi nk the image of serv
ing equally is very accurate." she
said.
As the 19N0s usher in a new
era in technological warfare and
a new view of female roles in soc
iety. many more nations will
probably face the debate over
the induction of women into the
armed forces, as the United
States is doing now.
I magi ne an option of two years
service in the army or three years
in the navy, air force, or special
forces; then 30 years of active
reserve status with annual or
semi-annual training sessions.
Every year millions of men
and women around the world in
their late teens or early 20s con
sider such options. Some wil
lingly enter armed service,
others hope lor a stroke of luck
so that they may he spared the
hardships of military life. Still
others have no choice.
From the French Revolution
to modern times, wars have been
won. colonies occupied, enemies
subdued and neighbors
threatened through conscripted
mass military forces. The
technological advancements ot
the 18th and 19th centuries
dramatically increased the milit
ary manpower needs of emerg
ing nation-states.
As the destructive capabilities
of weaponry rose, casualties
leaped and conscripts were used
to fill the ranks of the dying. Im
proved communication and the
revolutionary development of
shipping and air transport ena
bled colonial powers to extend
their military presence across
vast areas ol land mass tar from
home, given the existence of the
conscripted mass army.
Imperialist powers, socialist
nations and even colonies linked
the right to citizenship with an
obligation to serve in the milit
ary.
World War II climaxed the
development of mass con
scripted forces, as both the Al
lied and Axis powers employed
draftees in unprecedented num
bers to battle for the establish
ment of a new world order.
Yet since 1945, this new
global order, coupled with the
technological leaps of the nuc
lear age. have altered the re
quirements ot modern armed
forces in many advanced nations,
away from the reserve mass ot
manpower which the draft pro
vides.
As the European powers re
linquished control of colonies,
the need for occupying forces
have virtually disintegrated
overnight.
"Manpower comparisons are
not felt to be particularly valu
able and we no longer attempt
such comparison." the Interna
tional Institute for Strategic
Studies (ISS). a London based
research institute wrote in its
1 979 annual report on the global
military balance.
As nuclear weapons and
long-range missiles replaced
strength in manpower as the key
strategic category, large armies
were turned into cumbersome
economic liabilities and possible
centers for organized discontent
and rebellion.
More than 60 nations continue
to operate some system of com
pulsory military service, be it
through universal conscription
or a selective service system.
Yet. by the time the all
volunteer army was proposed in
the United States by President
Richard Nixon before the 1968
elections, many of the advanced
industrialized nations had al
ready abolished conscription or
moved toward greater emphasis

on the professional volunteer
elements in their armed forces.
By 1960 Great Britain had
ended conscription, climaxing a
process begun with the erosion
of the British empire, and the
new strategic reliance on the
American nuclear umbrella.
Canada followed the British
lead and shifted to a volunteer
force m the late 19505.
Japan, on the strength ol its
"peace constitution" which re
nounced the right to initiate war.
maintains only a "self-defense
force" consisting entirely of vol
unteers.
"I have never thought of a
draft as hav ing a direct impact on
myself." Ken Hodo, a sopho
more from Japan said. "Japan
lias gone in a different direction
since 1945."
"It may be necessary for the
United States to have a draft but
not for Japan." he said. If Japan
were to institute a selective ser
vice system, "I would try to find a
way to get out of serv ing," Hodo
said.
West Germany and France re
tain selective service systems and
meet approximately half of their
military manpower needs
through conscripts. Yet through
the use of numerous exemptions
and reduced serving time, they
have deemphasized the role ot
the conscript in their military es
tablishments.
Currently most NATO allies
ol the United States which have
selective service systems have
service durations of eight months
to two years.
The Warsaw Pact nations, on
the other hand, led by the Soviet
Union, continue to rely heavily
on the conscription system to fill
defense and occupation needs.
Soviet males are generally in
ducted at age 19 and serve for
two years in the army and air
force or two to three years in the
navy or as border guards. Nearly
two-thirds of the Warsaw pact's
troops are conscripts, according
to the 1979 ISS report.
The use of conscription in
Third World nations corres
ponds roughly to the degree of
internal stability and regional
tension in any given nation's en
vironment. Many nations main
tain a draft to till military ranks,
but do not rely on a conscripted
mass army for a high degree ol
military preparedness.

their military presence across
vast areas ol land mass tar from
home, given the existence of the
conscripted mass army.
Imperialist powers, socialist
nations and even colonies linked
the right to citizenship with an
obligation to serve in the milit
ary.
World War II climaxed the
development of mass con
scripted forces, as both the Al
lied and Axis powers employed
draftees in unprecedented num
bers to battle for the establish
ment of a new world order.
Yet since 1945, this new
global order, coupled with the
technological leaps of the nuc
lear age. have altered the re
quirements ot modern armed
forces in many advanced nations,
away from the reserve mass ot
manpower which the draft pro
vides.
As the European powers re
linquished control of colonies,
the need for occupying forces
have virtually disintegrated
overnight.
"Manpower comparisons are
not felt to be particularly valu
able and we no longer attempt
such comparison." the Interna
tional Institute for Strategic
Studies (ISS). a London based
research institute wrote in its
1 979 annual report on the global
military balance.
As nuclear weapons and
long-range missiles replaced
strength in manpower as the key
strategic category, large armies
were turned into cumbersome
economic liabilities and possible
centers for organized discontent
and rebellion.
More than 60 nations continue
to operate some system of com
pulsory military service, be it
through universal conscription
or a selective service system.
Yet. by the time the all
volunteer army was proposed in
the United States by President
Richard Nixon before the 1968
elections, many of the advanced
industrialized nations had al
ready abolished conscription or
moved toward greater emphasis

on the professional volunteer
elements in their armed forces.
By 1960 Great Britain had
ended conscription, climaxing a
process begun with the erosion
of the British empire, and the
new strategic reliance on the
American nuclear umbrella.
Canada followed the British
lead and shifted to a volunteer
force m the late 19505.
Japan, on the strength ol its
"peace constitution" which re
nounced the right to initiate war.
maintains only a "self-defense
force" consisting entirely of vol
unteers.
"I have never thought of a
draft as hav ing a direct impact on
myself." Ken Hodo, a sopho
more from Japan said. "Japan
lias gone in a different direction
since 1945."
"It may be necessary for the
United States to have a draft but
not for Japan." he said. If Japan
were to institute a selective ser
vice system, "I would try to find a
way to get out of serv ing," Hodo
said.
West Germany and France re
tain selective service systems and
meet approximately half of their
military manpower needs
through conscripts. Yet through
the use of numerous exemptions
and reduced serving time, they
have deemphasized the role ot
the conscript in their military es
tablishments.
Currently most NATO allies
ol the United States which have
selective service systems have
service durations of eight months
to two years.
The Warsaw Pact nations, on
the other hand, led by the Soviet
Union, continue to rely heavily
on the conscription system to fill
defense and occupation needs.
Soviet males are generally in
ducted at age 19 and serve for
two years in the army and air
force or two to three years in the
navy or as border guards. Nearly
two-thirds of the Warsaw pact's
troops are conscripts, according
to the 1979 ISS report.
The use of conscription in
Third World nations corres
ponds roughly to the degree of
internal stability and regional
tension in any given nation's en
vironment. Many nations main
tain a draft to till military ranks,
but do not rely on a conscripted
mass army for a high degree ol
military preparedness.
"The country is not in a dif
ficult situation militarily and so
the military does a lot ol work tor
the government and work in the
fields." said Faustin Yao. a
graduate student in communica
tions from the Ivory Coast.
Every 18-year-old male must
register for conscription in the
Ivory Coast, according to Yao.
Exemptions and deferments are
then granted on the basis ot mar
ital status, education and physi
cal fitness, he said.
"I spent a month and a hall in
the military before college and
expect to spend a year alter I
finish school, he said. " I did re
sent it and still do."
In Southeast Asia, the
ASEAN (Association ol South
east Asian Nations)nations, with
the exception of Malaysia, all re
quire some military service ol
their citizens, partially to combat
the internal security threats and
insurgencies which threaten the
very stability of their govern

ments.
Many Latin American nations
also use conscripts, possibly in
accordance with the expanded
governmental role of the military
regimes. Brazil, Bolivia and
Argentina all require one year of
service for conscripts.
In the Middle East, an area
plagued by Arab-Israeli conflict,
the volatile events of the Persian
Gulf region and the nearby con
flicts on the Horn of Africa,
nearly all nations maintain a
compulsory military service sys
tem. to help insure rapid mobili
zation in the case of emergency.
Israel remains unique among
American allies for the institu
tion of a universal conscription
system in which virtually all able
adults are required to serve.
Through a rigorous conscription
sy stem coupled with an extensive
reserve network, Israel's
165,000-strong military is man
ned by nearly 130,000 conscripts
and can mobilize approximately
400,000 within 24 hours.
Nevertheless, some Israelis
view compulsory military service
as an unfair burden.
"I don't see why citizenship
should be connected with ser
vice." said John Rosenblum, an
Israeli student in civil engineer
ing. The decision to serve should
be part of a choice, he said.
"If people don't want to serve
in the army, it means somehow
they aren't identifying with the
political goals," he said. For
example, "there are many
people who feel they want to
serve but not in the occupied ter
ritories." he said. Rosenblum
served for three years in the Is
raeli Defense Forces under Is
rael's compulsory service sys
tem, and was called up for six
months of emergency duty in the
1M73 Arab-Israeli war.
"The popular conception of
the Israeli woman, weapon in
hand, as an equal in combat with
her male comrades is based more
on myth than reality." wrote
Martin Binkin and Shirley Back
in their book Women and the
Military. "Women's participa
tion in the armed forces has re
cently been restricted to the
more traditional roles that are
less battle-oriented."
Israel's compulsory service
system is noted particularly for
its induction of women. While
women do have greater oppor
tunity to obtain exemptions and
dfermcnts than men. the laws
applying to men and women are
similar.
Nevertheless. Western images
ol the role of women in the Is
raeli Defense Forces may be
somewhat distorted.
Nava Rosenblum. an Israeli
woman who served for 20
months in the armed services,
said there is a separate hierarchy
for women in the Israeli military.
"I don't Â»hi nk the image of serv
ing equally is very accurate." she
said.
As the 19N0s usher in a new
era in technological warfare and
a new view of female roles in soc
iety. many more nations will
probably face the debate over
the induction of women into the
armed forces, as the United
States is doing now.
I magi ne an option of two years
service in the army or three years
in the navy, air force, or special
forces; then 30 years of active
reserve status with annual or
semi-annual training sessions.
Every year millions of men
and women around the world in
their late teens or early 20s con
sider such options. Some wil
lingly enter armed service,
others hope lor a stroke of luck
so that they may he spared the
hardships of military life. Still
others have no choice.
From the French Revolution
to modern times, wars have been
won. colonies occupied, enemies
subdued and neighbors
threatened through conscripted
mass military forces. The
technological advancements ot
the 18th and 19th centuries
dramatically increased the milit
ary manpower needs of emerg
ing nation-states.
As the destructive capabilities
of weaponry rose, casualties
leaped and conscripts were used
to fill the ranks of the dying. Im
proved communication and the
revolutionary development of
shipping and air transport ena
bled colonial powers to extend
their military presence across
vast areas ol land mass tar from
home, given the existence of the
conscripted mass army.

nations and even colonies linked
