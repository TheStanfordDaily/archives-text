# Radicals to turn over hostages
## Iranian Revolutionary Council will guard Americans 
### Jonathan Randal The Washington Post 
ITil IRAN, Iran The Iranian radi
cals who have held an estimated 50
Americans hostage lor tour months ab
ruptly agreed yesterday to hand them
over to the ruling Revolutionary Coun
cil after losing a desperate final attempt
to hlock a visit by a United Nations
com mission.
Informed sources here said the
commission may visit the hostages
within the next two to three days, and
added that the Iranian armed forces are
expected to take over informal guard of
the Americans.
The radicals' bitter statement, which
reflected their most significant loss in
an ongoing power struggle with Presi
dent Abolhassan Bani-Sadrantl others
working for a release of the hostages,
was read over Tehran radio yesterdav
afternoon. The students said their re
sponsibility for the hostages was
"finished."
The 13-metnber Revolutionarv
Corncil met yesterday and said it
would accept responsibility for the hos

tages. who continue to be held by the
students who seized the I .S. Embassy
on Nov. 4. A bare majority of the coun
cil is believed to favor ending the L .S.-
Iranian crisis.
Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghothzadeh, who has played a leading
role in the crisis, said a government
commission vv.ill be formed today to de
cide how the hostages will be turned
over to government control.
Emerging from the Revolutionary
Council's meeting. Ghoth/adeh
cautioned reporters against assuming
that yesterday's decision meant that
the actual release ol the captives was
imminent.
"You are jumping too far ahead." he
said, reiterating that Iran still expects
the United States to meet previously
spelled out. and rejected, conditions
for release.
In another development, the Iranian
government yesterday authorized 'his
reporter and a Xewsweek correspon
dent to re-enter Iran and resume work
All American correspondents were or
dered to leave Iran on Jan. 14. It v\;is
not immediately clear when other I .S.
journalists will be readmitted.
Commission blasted
l he radicals' statement sharply at
tacked the live-member fact-finding
team sent here by the United Nations.
I he commission was "ordered by
America and meeting (with the hos
tages) is really what the American gov
ernment wants." the statement said.
"But what could we do when the
people who are responsible lor the
commission have accepted that the
commission is allowed to do ev cry tin tig
it wants?" the radicals asked.
In recognizing that "our responsibil
ity about the hostages is finished." the
students tacitly dropped their hard-line
demand that the detained Americans
would be released onlv in exchange for
the return of the deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi from Ins
exile in Panama.

Underlining what their spokesman
called "intolerable government pres
sures." the student statement said that,
"to prevent any misunderstanding,
the Revolutionary Council should
"'ake the hostages, or the \merican
from us and do with them what
nl- best" since "we cannot carry
thing we do not believe in.
â€¢ indents' spokesmen said last night
they considered the embassy then
"home and "we're not going to
leave." Inlornied sources said the
statement may indicate that the stu
dents are prepared to let the hostages
leave the embassy in the custody ol
Iranian troops, a tnov e that would ease
the efforts lor release. "Our statement
is not related to any order by Kho
meini. the students claimed. It is en
tirelv the decision ol the students.'

Calling the radicals' move a dis
guised capitulation, informed sources
said the action had helped "gain two
weeks."
They explained that the methods lot
treeing the hostages could be worked
out now before the parliamentary elec
tions at the end ol this month, enabling
the newly-formed legislature to tackle
the question as one of its lust orders ol
business when it meets in early April
In W ashington. the ("arter administ
ration noted that "Nothing has hap
pened yet."
U.S. sources said privatelv the latesi
development had caught Washington
by surprise at a moment when the ad
ministration was expecting the I \
commission visiting Tehran to leave
without having made anv progress to
ward the hostages' release.
