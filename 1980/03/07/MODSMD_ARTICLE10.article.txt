# Yugoslavia, Turkey, Romania links expanded
## EEC forges strong ties with neighbors

BRUSSELS. Belgium â€” While they have
differed with Washington over the issue of
retaliation against Moscow for the invasion
of Afghanistan, the nine members of the
European Common Market have moved
quickly to strengthen relations with three
sensitise neighboring countries.
The Economic Community, in clear deci
sions over a few weeks. ga\e new priority to
mov ing closer to Yugoslavia, Romania and
Turkey, all in special positions in relations to
the Soviet Union.
Although the Common Market had al
ready outstanding lines of communication of
a different sort with each country, the new
tear of Soviet expansionism in light of the
Afghanistan crisis and the expected demise
of Yugoslav President Josip Tito triggered
new activity at community headquarters in
Brussels.
As one British observer put it. "A promise
of rapid change emerged last week through
one of those decisions that (Common Mar
ket) ministers take to send a burst ot adrena
lin throughout the entire community sys
tem."
New agreement
In its actions to woo three eastern
neighbors, the Common Market agreed to
accelerate negotiations with Yugoslavia for a
new trade agreement to replace the one that
has been extended since its formal expiration
in 1978.
The Yugoslavs, stung when the market put
an embargo on purchases of beef a few years
ago, wanted a reduction in tariffs and other
restrictions to make it easier to sell their
goods in Western Europe.
Between 1973 and 1978. the period of the
previous trade agreement, tne Yugoslav
trade deficit with the market rose from $886
million to $2.7 billion.
The same period saw the Yugoslav trade
relationship with Moscow and its group of

trading partners, called Comecon, rise from
31 percent of Belgrade's trade to more than
40 percent.
While Yugoslavia has been independent of
Moscow for more than 30 years, the growth
of its trade ties with the eastern Communist
bloc suggested a strong pull away from Bel
grade's official stance of political non
alignment.
High-level decision
Now. after the high-level market decision
of last month, the community has offered to
allow without duty the entry of many indust
rial products viewed as a threat just a few
weeks before.
While the issue of meat imports is still
highly sensitive, the common market tur
nabout was encouraging enough for the Bel
grade representatives to rejoin the talks and
predict a new agreement could be completed
this month.
The community said the new pact would
take into account "Yugoslavia's fundamen
tal position as a Mediterranean country, de
veloping and non-aligned . .
Since Yugoslavia permits more than
600,000 of its citizens to work in Western
Europe, the social ties between the common
market and Belgrade have been strong.
Greece and Turkey
The approaching accession of Greece to
full Common Market membership puts addi
tional pressure on Brussels to reach an ag
reement with Yugoslavia.
Turkey, which is a NATO member, has a
long-range goal of joining the common mar
ket, in whose countries more than 650,000
citizens hold jobs.
While membership for Turkey is consi
dered an impossible goal for the near future,
the market agreed to make a "new ap
proach" to reaching a new basis of associa
tion by April with Ankara.
The community assured Turkey that the
admission of Greece, with whom Turkey has
chilly relations, would not disturb the 16-

year-old agreement between Ankara and
Brussels.
In addition, the community agreed to
examine the possibility of importing more
from Turkey, giving it more financial aid and
permitting free movement of its overseas
workers.
Poor
As a poor Muslim country that borders
both revolutionary Iran and the Soviet Un
ion, Turkey is considered especially sensitive
to the unsettled political atmosphere in that
region.
West Germany has accepted the lead
among its allies for organizing assistance for
Turkey, and in a message circulated a few
weeks ago, the Bonn government said aid to
Turkey this >ear would have to be bigger than
the $960 million granted Ankara in 1979.
While the Western financial aid would
help Turkey stave off potential bankruptcy,
the Common Market program is aimed at
helping the country increase its export sales
and foreign currency income on a long-term
basis.
Romania
Romania is a different case because it is a
member of the Comecon trading bloc and the
Moscow-directed Warsaw Military Pact.
After a delay of many months, the Com
mon Market and Romania recently resumed
their talks aiming for a bilateral agreement
that would permit more imports from
Bucharest and put relations on an agreed
basis.
Other Comecon countries have made ten
tative approaches to Brussels but only
Romania has gone so far in individual
negotiations.
In agreeing to more detailed talks,
Romania accepted the competence of the
market to deal in trade matters for all its nine
members. Comecon and its other members
have refused to acknowledge that status for
the community.
