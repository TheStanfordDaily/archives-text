ISLAMABAD. Pakistan â€”
Government officials rejected a
U.S. offer of military and
economic aid designed to protect
Pakistan's 1200-mile border
with Afghanistan, and about
130,000 Afghan refugees were
reported fleeing toward Pakistan
following tour days of pounding
bv Soviet bombers.

The report about the refugee
movement came from a Paris
based group called International
League for the Rights of Man. It
said it got its information from
one of its observers in Peshawar,
Pakistan, near the border bet
ween Afghanistan and Pakistan.
"Women and children have
been slaughtered, and poison gas
has been used," during the
bombings in Konar Province in
eastern Afghanistan, the group
claimed. Rebel leaders said hun
dreds were killed during the
bombing attacks, hut neither
their claims nor those of the Paris
group could be confirmed inde
pendently.
Pakistan has already taken in
more than 500.000 refugees
from Afghanistan since the first
of three Marxist governments
came to power there 23 months
ago.
In Washington, the State De
partment said the I'm ted States
has expressed its concern to
Soviet authorities over continu
ing reports that Soviet forces
have been using poison gas in

Afghanistan. Department
spokesman Hodding Carter said
the United States has raised the
issue with the U.N. Commission
on Human Rights.
$400 million ofTer
He said the United States had
received "no formal notifica
tion of Pakistan's decision to
turn down the U.S. offer of $400
million in military and economic
aid over a two-year period.
But Agha Sliahi. foreign af
fairs adviser to Pakistani Presi
dent Mohammed Zia ul-Haq,
said at a meeting of municipal
leaders: "Pakistan has specifi
cally disassociated itself from
any U.S. initiative to introduce
the relevant legislation in the
American Congress."
"It is our considered view that
for its security, Pakistan must
depend primarily on its national
unity and strength ... as well as
the time-tested friendship of
China. It will not be prudent on
our part to be dependent for our
security on any single power," he
said.
He refused to say when Pakis

tan had informed the United
States of its decision not to ac
cept the aid, hut said it had re
ceived other aid offers.
In a related development.
ul-Haq was reported to have told
the Soviet Union he would agree
to the stationing ot international
troops "both inside and along
the borders ot Afghanistan to
guarantee against any interfer
ence from the Pakistan side."
Soviet-backed Afghan Presi
dent Babrak Karmal claimed in
an interview published by the
Bombay, India, weekly news
paper Blitz that Afghan insur
gents are using 30 bases and
training camps in Pakistan, ac
cording to the United News W
India.
And he said: "Unless all the
bases and training camps in
which the CIA. Chinese. British.
Egyptians and Israelis are in
volved are wound up and the
flow of military hardware and re
sources ceases, there can be no
peace."
