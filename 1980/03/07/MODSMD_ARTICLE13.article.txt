# Mugabe image, ideology clash
## 
### Jack Foisie The Los Angeles Times 
SALISBURY. Zimbabwe-Rhodesia — Robert
Gabriel Mugabe, whose smashing election victory
has made him Zimbabwe-Rhodesia's first post
independence prime minister, hardly fits the image
of a guerrilla.
He has five college degrees, an urbane manner
and wears conservative business suits. But he
would get a cool reception in the boardroom of a
capitalist corporation.
For Mugabe, 55, is a black nationalist with a long
espousal of Marxism, and he is welcome in either
Moscow or Peking.
Since returning from exile only five weeks ago to
orchestrate a campaign which had already been
spawned in his guerrilla-controlled areas, Mugabe
has soft-pedalled his ideological views. But there
seems little doubt that they still exist, and whites
fear that a socialistic takeover of farmland, mining
and industry is a prospect for the future.
Mugabe received his early training at a Catholic
mission school near Salisbury. But he acquired a
distrust of whites and gained black nationalist cre
dentials by his early 20s. By African standards, his
father was well-off, a village carpenter. The son
was sent to a black university in South Africa and
gained teaching credentials.
But he found teaching unsatisfactory, and

moved to Ghana in West Africa, where he married
Sarah Hyfron, a black political activist.
Mugabe came back to Rhodesia with his wife in
1960 and soon afterward had his first brush with
white authorities. In a scuffle with police during a
rally, Mugabe recalls telling the white in charge of
suppressing the demonstration: "We will not put
up with this nonsense. We are taking over this
country."
His words proved to be prophetic, for last week's
election brought about a black-majority govern
ment and gave Mugabe its leadership.
As Mugabe gained prominence as a "bright Af
rican," the white government began building a case
file on him. In 1964 Mugabe was detained for his
political activity. He was in prison for 10 years.
While his confinement made him bitter, the young
intellectual made good use of his time, gaining
three additional degrees by correspondence.
While in prison, his only son died, and he was
refused permission to attend the funeral.
Before serving his prison term Mugabe had al
ready established a son-to-father political relation
ship with Joshua Nkomo, the senior black
nationalist in Rhodesia. After Mugabe was re
teased, a political partnership was formed. It was
always tenuous, for Nkomo is pragmatic and
Mugabe tends to be an idealist, friends say.
