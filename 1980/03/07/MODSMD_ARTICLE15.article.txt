j Guess what? My column last week was cut
J drastically somewhere between the typewriter
J and the printer. That's what happens when
j you're low man on the totem pole — nobody
: respects you. I was in the middle of a slough of
J statistics which you probably weren't paying at-
I tention to anyway.
J So. on to better things. I have this just in from
j a reader in Seattle, W;ish. (seriously!) Howard

i Dear Andrew,
] While I am unsure of the origin of llie tradition
) of screaming "UAH HI I to the first unsuspect
i ing person encountered at the beginning of every
; month, I can guess at the ritual's roots.
: The rabbit has, since undent times, been as
-1 sociated with the moon - its gestation period is 3 0
\ days, and it is a nocturnal animal. Similarly, the
i day on which we celebrate Easter is dependent on
r the cycles of the Paschul full moon (not to be
J confused with the astronomical full moon or the
} real full moon), which is why children await the
1 coming of the Easter Hare to bring them eggs and
i 1 X'fts-
I So perhaps somewhere along the line someone
: got the idea to bellow "RABBIT" at sunrise of
j the Jirst day of the month to both scare the bun
) nies back into their burrows and impart to the
) newly-born baby bunnies that man was the boss
( j and they'd better not forget it.
112 Ah, the many and wonderous advantages of a
r $20,000 Stanford education. . . .
1 I couldn't have said it better.
j Well, besides the above letter. I've received
( about a dozen otlv miscellaneous questions in

the last two weeks. Here is one; the rest I'll try
to take care of next week. This one was sent to
"ON CALL" but was referred to me.
If you didn't know it, CIT (Center for Infor
mation Technology) is the new name for SCI I'
(Stanford Center for Information Processing),
which used to be called SCC (Stanford Computa
tion Center) and may have had other names as
well over time. Why have there been so many
names for a facility that does not significantly
change its function over the years?
-M.C.S.
"There have been some significant changes,"
said Ed Williams, associate director of SCI P.
opps, sorry, I mean CIT, which has in fact just
changed its name. The history of the nomencla
ture goes something like this, according to Wil
liams:
Before 1973, the Stanford Computation
Center consisted of the main computer system
here, the SL.AC (Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center) machines and the ACME project (an
interactive system for medical research
In 1973 the University's administrative com
puter at Encina and all the Hospital computing
systems were consolidated, and so SCC became
SCIP.
Last quarter SL.AC separated from the or
ganization and SCIP was reorganized under a
new director, Ed Shaw, associate provost lor
information systems. Shaw instituted changes
"which will unfold over the next few years,"
Williams said. One of these changes was the
new title.
Well, I've alredy overrun my space, so I'll
continue in the Dead Week issue Wednesday.
