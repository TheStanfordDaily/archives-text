# Hayden looks back at activism years'
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
(Note: Shortly before speaking to
students at White I'laza Tuesday,
activist Tom Hayden spoke with
Daily reporter Carl Johnston.
Here follows their conversation.)
Daily: Are you still a member of
the radical left?
Hayden: Yes and no. I think that
by working within the electoral
system you are trying to reach a
much broader audience. At least
it's a more moderate approach.
But 1 think that the reason that
this approach can be more suc
cessful is largely due to the
movements, the more militant
demonstrations of the '60s,
which woke people up and
created a few changes, and laid a
base for being able to work
somewhat within the system.
Daily: You've participated in
and have lead a number of politi
cal causes since you helped
found S.D.S. You were one of
the Chicago 7, you helped to oc
cupy buildings at Columbia Uni
versity. One major political
cause is usually enough to last
most people a lifetime. What do
you see as the common factor in
all these movements?
Hayden: 1 think that there's one
linkage that goes throughout,
and that is the concept of democ
racy, meaning that people have
more power and more voice in
making decisions that affect their
lives. When I became active, for
example, as a student, I couldn't
vote. I could be drafted, but I

couldn't vote. We were treated
like children in the universities.
Then came the civil rights
movement, where blacks were
fighting for the right to vote.
Then came the illegal, undemoc
ratic war in Indochina; then
came the centralized presidency
of Nixon. Now we have an
energy crisis in which the federal
government, the oil companies
and the nuclear industries,
they're all centralized institu
tions. Throughout these 20 years
I've noticed that the people who
have to pay the bills or become
the cannon-fodder normally get
shut out of the process.
Daily: Will you be running for
the Senate in '82?
Hayden: It's a possibility, but
only a possibility. I don't . . .
that's not my major interest. My
interest is in developing a
mechanism or a political organi
zation that could elect a great
many people to office. I may or
may not be running in my own
race.
Daily: Are you forming your
own political party?
Hayden: I think that from the
practical standpoint what we're
doing in the Campaign for
Economic Democracy (CED) is
sufficient. That is, we have our
plaform, we have our candidates.
We generally work within the
Democratic Party, because that's
where most of the voters are that
we're trying to reach.
Daily: What exactly is your rela
tionship with Jerry Brown?
Hayden: 1 would say that it is a
coalition on issues. Working to
gether on issues of nuclear
power, solar energy, alternative
investments of pension funds,
rent rights, dealing with toxic
chemicals.
Daily: Have you sensed any
changes in the attitudes of

you n ge r peop 1 e ? Th is gene rat i on
has been accused of being
apathetic.
Hayden: Yes, I think there's a
certain apathy, at least on the
surface. And it comes from stu
dents being under more
economic pressure, fewer jobs
awaiting them in the future, and
therefore more pressure to study
and compete with one another.
I think also that students have
seen, or at least think they've
seen, a lot of hypocrisy, a lot of
death and destruction, and not
much good come out of efforts
by individuals to change society.
So they're a little more hesitant
to commit themselves because ot
what they've seen. But I think
that students can come out of
that apathy very, very rapidly. I
mean, I was part of that so-called
"Silent Generation"! People
don't remember that.
Daily: How do you feel about
your past constantly being
brought up to describe you now?
Constantlv confronted with the
'60s?
Hayden: Probably fade in the
'90s. Kind of fade out. 1 don't
like to dwell on it. But I think
that the '60s were a watershed
decade, a very important decade.
What we learned then will al
ways be with me. I want to go
back to the student question.
Daily: All right.
Hayden: I think that campus
apathy significantly ended when
Pres. (Jimmy) Carter announced
registration and proposed some
kind of draft. See what happend
was the students were kind ot left
alone. The administration de
cided not to provoke students.
That's part of the reason for
apathy. The universities are bet
ter, they're calmer, students
have more avenues to vent their
frustrations. Student govern

ments were given ;i lot of mone>
that they didn't have before.
And generally the powers that be
backed off of students after the
'60s. Hut now you have the long
arm of government reaching in.
closing the books and telling you
that you have to be ready, poten
tially, to die. And that makes you
think. I feel that students have
been very effective in the past
month in forcing Carter to take
one step back on his position.
And I think that students can ef
fectively break the Carter Doc
trine.
Daily: Would you encourage
students to break the law in
order to protest registration'.'
Daniel Ellsberg said that he
would actively encourage people
not to register. Will you?
Hayden: I think that is a matter
for individual conscience. I think
that is also politically a matter for
Students for Economic Democracy
to decide upon. What SI D has de
cided upon is to lay the question
before students and try to educate
the students to see that they are
being used as pawns in a chess
game being played by the oil indus
try. I think, first the educational
process has to come, to let people
make up their own minds.
My own personal opinion is
that if you decide to register, you
are making yourself available as
a pawn. If you are dratted, you
are becoming cannon-fodder lor
the oil industry. But if you still
make that choice. I hope you'll
still struggle for a democratic
military where you will not be
blindly obedient to each and
every order.
I think that all people, whether
they're resisting, or in the milit
ary ought to have some power to
think lor themselves.
