## Support senate reform 
### 
The ASSU Senate will he voting next
Wednesday on a senate reform proposal to
submit to campus voters in next month's
ASSU spring election. We hope the senate
passes the proposal and we hope student
voters approve it.
'ITie proposal will eliminate the fall se
nate election and provide that all senators
will be elected in the spring. The make-up
of the senate itself will not change. There
will continue to he 20 senators and 20 al
ternates.
The system would allow senators to use
the summer and early fall months to be
come accustomed to the senate procedures
and familiar with the issues facing the
ASSU.
The only change the proposal would
enact, would be to give 10 new students
(freshmen, transfers and new graduate
students) the opportunity to have senate
floor speaking privileges. We are not con
vinced by the argument that denying new
students voting privileges reduces the
proposal to a sham.
New students have traditionally not be

come too involved in the senate, and the 10
new student senate associate non-voting
positions would allow their voice to be
heard.
Senate reform has been tried repeatedly
in the past, especially in the years since the
election scandal of 1977. Some plans have
been acceptable, while others clearly have
not. The plan now facing the senate is far
from sol\ ing the many problems facing the
senate and the ASSU election system, but
it is a start, a start that future senate's can
build upon.
The proposal is also simple enough that
campus \oters will readily understand the
significance of. and need for. the changes
proposed. Too often in the past, reform
proposals have lost at the election box be
cause of a mystifying complexity that has
led voters to reject some proposals more
for their completeness than for their draw
backs. This proposal's intent is simple and
straightforward. It is an initial step toward
an eventual substantial reform of the se
nate.
We hope the plan succeeds.
