# So long, Dan
## 
### 
We would like to join the rest of the
community in bidding Dan Williams
farewell. Dan. former director of Tresidder
Memorial Union, is leav ing Stanford soon
to become director of residential education
at the University of Oregon.
Dan was an administrator who showed a
genuine and sincere interest in students
here. Bureaucratic constraints may some
times have prevented him from doing the
job he and others might have wished him
to. but Dan's intent was difficult to call into
question.
Atagoing-away party held a week ago in
his honor. Dan was congratulated on a job
well done and given a sentimental sendoff

by many of his friends at the University. It
was particularly notable that a large
number of students were present at the
occasion. These were students who had
had an opportunity over the years to get to
know Dan. and they were students whom
Dan knew on a first-name basis. Few stu
dents get to know administrators as well as
many of us got to know Dan Williams. That
is because Dan realized students were the
reason for his being here, not just the ad
ministration or the University's benefac
tors.
We wish Dan the best in his new position
at Oregon. We also wish his successor here
the best of luck filling the genuine void
created by his loss.
