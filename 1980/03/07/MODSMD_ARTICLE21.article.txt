# Decriminalize marijuana
## 
### 
The Daily supports efforts to enact the
1980 California Marijuana Initiative, a
measure that would allow private posses
sion. transportation and cultivation of
marijuana for personal use. While we are
not encouraging use of the drug, we believe
the measure serves to protect an individu
al's right to privacy and addresses the
economic reality of marijuana in the state.
An informed adult should have the right
to act as he chooses in his own home, so
long as his actions do not adversely affect
others. The initiative insures this freedom,
yet does not remove penalties for those
who use marijuana in public. Further, the
initiative insures the safety of others by
leaving intact state laws against driving
under the influence of drugs.
State studies have shown that marijuana
laws currently cost taxpayers over $50 mill
ion per year. Passage of the initiative could
reduce this substantially.
At the same time, according to Drug
Enforcement Administration estimates,
California marijuana growers gross $1 bill
i<yi annually — virtually all tax-free. Not
only is this a potential source of tax re
venue for state and local governments, but
the large profits involved encourage and
reward those who break the law.
Recognizing the need for a serious study
on the economics of marijuana, the authors
of the 19S0 California Marijuana Initiative
specified that a state commission be estab
lished to study the potential benefits of a
regulated marijuana market. Findings by
this commission could well determine fu
ture changes in federal laws that prohibit
commercial cultivation and sales.

While the Daily supports efforts to pass
the marijuana initiative, we do have sev
eral concerns.
First, the measure defines adults as those
"IS years or older." Not only will such a
low age "turn off" many voters at the polls,
we feel it is inconsistent with the state's
legal drinking age of 21. Why should we
allow people to smoke marijuana three
years before they can legally consume al
cohol?
Second, it may be argued that the full
effects of marijuana on adults are not yet
known. If passage of the initiative were to
increase marijuana use, the seriousness of
any health hazard would be magnified.
The initiative would also put many
people in a bind: they would be allowed to
use marijuana, but would have no means of
obtaining it, because the sale of the product
is not covered by the initiative. Although
personal cultivation would be permitted,
many users believe the home-grown pro
duct is inferior to imported marijuana and
would thus continue to buy on the black
market, despite the legal risk.
Despite its shortcomings, the 1980
California Marijuana Initiative promises to
increase personal freedom and replace
largely disobeyed and unpopular laws.
Both the American Medical Association
and the American Bar Association have
recommended decriminalization of
marijuana. If supporters can collect, by
May 1, the 600,000 signatures they claim
are needed to validate the initiative, then
California voters will be able to decide for
themselves in the next general election.
