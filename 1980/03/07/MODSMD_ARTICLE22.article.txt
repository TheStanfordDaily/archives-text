# How to rid the ants from your life
## 
### 
You've heard it all before.
How Stanford is the Harvard of
the West; the praise echoing the
halls of our number-one ranked
Graduate School of Business;
the whispered salaries offered to
those lucky B of A folks; and
most of all, how exclusive the
application process accepting
only outstanding candidates (1
know, you can't believe you got
in. it must have been a mistake).
The rhetorical repertoire about
our amazing University erodes
anyone's sense of humility.
We smile smugly and comp
lain about the long lines at de-
Guerre, or the scarcity of
windsurfs at Lag on those
academic spring afternoons. We
whine about how challenging
Human Sexuality has gotten (the
course) and moan over the cru
cial decisions of where to vaca
tion spring break. Come on,
admit it. you think this place is
"awesome." With all this grand-

eur, why can't the University
deal with the blatant issue on
campus? Why is our administra
tion paralyzed when faced with a
true test of leadership? I'm not
talking about the tuition hike,
nor the recent controversy over
minority applicants; rather. I'm
addressing an issue facing every
student here: the ants.
Stop and consider this: have
you ever been in a University
bathroom that didn't have one or
two columns marching up the
shower stall? Ever been minding
your own business skimming the
sports page and a little critter
comes crawling over your big
toe? What about the time you
reached for the Crest and that
sneaky beastie beat you to your

toothbrush! Hey, I'm not talking
Stern, this is going on in the mar
ble elegance of 558 May field.
I find this reprehensible. My
roommate and I are having an
affair with the exterminator just
to get two-for-one service. He
sprays, we smile. This is no
laughing matter. These ants are
getting cocky. The ones at D.U.
are wearing l/od's; here at La
Casa they laze around all day
making up jokes for the Pizzeria
— some are bi-lingual. They
squeak buon giourno and pinch
as I rapidly shave my legs.
At Columbae the ants or
ganized a union and held a pro
test to demand non-violent
treatment. How can you kill an
ant non-violently? Think about
the poor freshmen. They read
Approaching Stanford all sum
mer and get psyched for carpeted
rooms, intimate sherry hours and
romantic meetings outside the
toilets (remember that picture?).

The whole catastrophe shames
me. I've written several letters to
Res Ed but even Norm Robin
son's efforts have been futile. I
think it's time for the ASSU to
take immediate action. A fee as
sessment on the spring quarter
ballot would provide funds for
professional smooshers. Work
study students could apply for
positions. Personally, my tactics
have been in vain. But. for those
noble people who might be more
successful. I'll give you a few in
side tricks:
1. Decker war: wear some
extra-thick deckers and ground
those suckers into the tile when
they're not looking. A 3 a.m.
study break will do the trick; get

the whole dorm involved.
2. Hai Karate: practice your
self-defense skills in the bat
hroom orany other ant hangout.
A few chops usually does the job.
Wear gloves though, it can he
rather messy.
2. Operation toothpaste:
poison a tube ol your favorite
breath-freshening, mouth
whitening, cavity killer and in
conspicuousl) leave oil the cap.
That'll handle the Don Juan
types, they can't resist a good
hygenic rush.
4. Fumigate: if your personal
exterminator isn't ys sexy as
mine, buy the cheapest cologne
you can find at Walgreen's (it'll
be a contest) and spray paint the
grout with it. Neither you or the

insects will he ahle to st;uul it loi
weeks.
5. Hnterpreneunal Ants Inc
collect them and sell them to
farmers in I ouisiana. I'hey do
good har\est work.
It nothing works. I can't help
\a. You could get really drama
tie. open the window and sell
"I'm mad as hell and I'm not
going to take it anymore." Init
the psychiatric ward is always
looking lor new patients. I'ei
sonally. I've trained a couple Id
take notes lor me. I mean, who
can compete with creatures thai
can get into the (iSH so easily?

Res Ed but even Norm Robin
son's efforts have been futile. I
think it's time for the ASSU to
take immediate action. A fee as
sessment on the spring quarter
ballot would provide funds for
professional smooshers. Work
study students could apply for
positions. Personally, my tactics
have been in vain. But. for those
noble people who might be more
successful. I'll give you a few in
side tricks:
1. Decker war: wear some
extra-thick deckers and ground
those suckers into the tile when
they're not looking. A 3 a.m.
study break will do the trick; get

the whole dorm involved.
2. Hai Karate: practice your
self-defense skills in the bat
hroom orany other ant hangout.
A few chops usually does the job.
Wear gloves though, it can he
rather messy.
2. Operation toothpaste:
poison a tube ol your favorite
breath-freshening, mouth
whitening, cavity killer and in
conspicuousl) leave oil the cap.
That'll handle the Don Juan
types, they can't resist a good
hygenic rush.
4. Fumigate: if your personal
exterminator isn't ys sexy as
mine, buy the cheapest cologne
you can find at Walgreen's (it'll
be a contest) and spray paint the
grout with it. Neither you or the

insects will he ahle to st;uul it loi

You've heard it all before.
How Stanford is the Harvard of
the West; the praise echoing the
halls of our number-one ranked
Graduate School of Business;
the whispered salaries offered to
those lucky B of A folks; and
most of all, how exclusive the
application process accepting
only outstanding candidates (1
know, you can't believe you got
in. it must have been a mistake).
The rhetorical repertoire about
our amazing University erodes
anyone's sense of humility.
We smile smugly and comp
lain about the long lines at de-
Guerre, or the scarcity of
windsurfs at Lag on those
academic spring afternoons. We
whine about how challenging
Human Sexuality has gotten (the
course) and moan over the cru
cial decisions of where to vaca
tion spring break. Come on,
admit it. you think this place is
"awesome." With all this grand-

eur, why can't the University
deal with the blatant issue on
campus? Why is our administra
tion paralyzed when faced with a
true test of leadership? I'm not
talking about the tuition hike,
nor the recent controversy over
minority applicants; rather. I'm
addressing an issue facing every
student here: the ants.
Stop and consider this: have
you ever been in a University
bathroom that didn't have one or
two columns marching up the
shower stall? Ever been minding
your own business skimming the
sports page and a little critter
comes crawling over your big
toe? What about the time you
reached for the Crest and that
sneaky beastie beat you to your

toothbrush! Hey, I'm not talking
Stern, this is going on in the mar
ble elegance of 558 May field.
I find this reprehensible. My
roommate and I are having an
affair with the exterminator just
to get two-for-one service. He
sprays, we smile. This is no
laughing matter. These ants are
getting cocky. The ones at D.U.
are wearing l/od's; here at La
Casa they laze around all day
making up jokes for the Pizzeria
— some are bi-lingual. They
squeak buon giourno and pinch
as I rapidly shave my legs.
At Columbae the ants or
ganized a union and held a pro
test to demand non-violent
treatment. How can you kill an
ant non-violently? Think about
the poor freshmen. They read
Approaching Stanford all sum
mer and get psyched for carpeted
rooms, intimate sherry hours and
romantic meetings outside the
toilets (remember that picture?).

The whole catastrophe shames
me. I've written several letters to
Res Ed but even Norm Robin
son's efforts have been futile. I

take immediate action. A fee as
