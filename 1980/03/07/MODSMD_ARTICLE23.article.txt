## Stop Bike Menace 
### 
The Bike Menace deserves
corrective action. Iliis column is
precipitated by a recent occurr
ence in which a student cyclist in
broad day light, and with no traf
fic complication ran into the
back of Dan Throop Smith.
Senior Research Fellow, Hoover
Institution. (It is assumed that
the motive was not Dan's loyalty
to the Republican party.) Dan
was knocked down, his head
bled, and he went to the
emergency ward of the hospital.
He has recovered.
The Bike Menace on campus
is not a new problem but it may
be getting worse. One ol the
Graduate School of Business
administrators was also knocked
down by a cyclist sometime ago
and suffered a worsening back
injury. One of the GSB faculty
riding his bike has been hit sepa
rately by two cyclists, once suf
fering a concussion, the other
time only a black eye.
By unusual vigilance and
peripheral vision I have escaped
injury on foot from student cyc
lists but have been run into twice
in my car. On one occasion the
student wanted me to pay $50

lor the damage to his bike which
I refused to do. It was disappoint
ing to learn that my insurance
company paid him $100 to pre
vent further complications, the
insurance company pointing out
that cyclists enjoy a sympathetic
climate ol opinion, regardless ol
the merits ol an accident.
On campus cyclists ride both
ways on both sides ol the street
and on the sidewalks. They
rarely stop at stop signs in spite
of the police chiefs statement a
lew years ago as quoted in a paper
that cyclists usually stop.
Years ago bikes were lorbid
den on the quad and the prohibi
tion was enforced. It is no doubt
not a conscious policy to allow
students to attack pedestrians
and autos. but it turns out that
way.
Action? Hniorce the law. Or
require all students to pass a
course in bike salety. Or require
bikes to make a noise so their
approach can be anticipated. Or
have pedestrian lanes tree ol the
Bike Menace.
