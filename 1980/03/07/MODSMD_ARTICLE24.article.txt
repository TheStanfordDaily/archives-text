## Why Vietnamese flee homeland 
### 
The following column describ
ing current domestic conditions
in Vietnam and the motivations
for the refugee exodus from that
country was written in January by
a man in Vinh Long (about 75
miles south of Ho Clti Minh City
-formerly Saigon).
The author, who asked that his
name be withheld, sent the essay
to a relative in the Bay area who
forwarded it to a Stanford student.
Why are the Vietnamese re
fugees so eager to give up the
land where they were born, the
people they love, and the prop
erty and money they so labori
ously earned to launch into the
unknown at the risk of their
lives? There are various political
and economic reasons.
The day after their victory, the
Vietnamese Communists issued
a proclamation assuring inhabit
ants that their liberty and prop
erty would be respected, that the
new government would not con
fiscate everything down to their
needles and thread. They also
said South Vietnamese military
off ice rs and high -r an k ing ci vi I ia n
officials should register for a
week long re-education prog
ram. Indeed the Communists
honored their promise regarding
the needles and thread, instead
appropriate gold and savings in
banks and land.
The week-long re-education
turned out to be years of hard
labor in concentration camps.
From time to time a few captives
were freed, but they were dep
rived of their civil rights and had
to register regularly with the
police. The exact number of
those still in confinement is not
known, but what is certain is that
many have died from overwork,
malnutrition and lack of medical
care. That is why those who have
been freed prefer death at sea to
another experience in the con
centration camps, which is possi
ble at any time.
Formerly, Vict Cong guerril
las had the support of their coun
trymen. Young villagers, excited
and enticed by slogans attacking
French colonialism and Ameri
can imperialism, gladly joined
battle in order to win back the
independence of their home
land. But now, the Viet Cong are
having trouble inducing the same
lads to go die in Cambodia. The
soldiers prefer desertion. If they
have the means, they sneak ab
road.
Every able-bodied 17-to 45-
year-old male and 18-to 35-
ycar-old female has to do 45
days of state labor a year. They
have to dig canals or build dams
far from their homes; they are
neither paid nor fed. This state
labor constitutes a serious hand
icap to many people, for they are
forccd to interrupt their regular
jobs.
In the field of education, chil

dren of former Vietnamese of
ficers cannot go beyond the tenth
grade. The university entrance
examination is based not on the
candidate's academic creden
tials, but on his record in the
police register. The candidate
whose father is still in a concent
ration camp fails automatically.
Houses bought by former
high-ranking government offi
cials or army officers are re
quisitioned. Civil servants of
lower rank can keep their homes
for the moment but are warned
that the government may requis
ition them at any time.
Most people are passive and
stolid; they accept their fate with
resignation. They want only to
be left alone, to attend to their
business. They want to rest after
a hard day's work rather than sit
in a stilling hall for three hours
(from 7 to 10 p.m.) listening
without hearing, without under
standing, to some young com
rade expound Marxism, exhort
ing you tosell your harvest below
cost, or emphasizing the impor
tance of joining the army to help
a "sister" country threatened by
foreign imperialism.
No books or newspapers are
available except those published
by the government for prop
aganda. Impartial information
comes from foreign radio broad
casts, which are listened to clan
destinely.
One has to petition and obtain
permission to travel from town
to town. Many people disregard
the regulations, but hostels (all
government-owned) refuse ad
mittance to people without
traveling permits.
On the eve of the Viet Cong
takeover, most Chinese tycoons
and a few Vietnamese moguls
fled abroad; they were wise.
Those who remained were al
lowed and encouraged to attend
to their business peacefully.
When all their trading connec
tions and all their industrial in
terests were revealed, the police
suddenly fell upon them. All
their goods, offices, factories and
land were appropriated — but
not their gold. However, in the
end the shrewd Viet Cong got
that too.
The Chinese were permitted
and even encouraged to buy
their way out of the country. This
was their eager desire, because
without commerce they are like
fish in shallow water; they have
to move into the open sea.
Everywhere in South Vietnam
crowds of Chinese men and
women registered to go abroad.
The average price is eight
ounces of gold. Vietnamese who
aren't of Chinese origin have to
pay two additional ounces for
forged papers. In this way the
Viet Cong have collected huge
amounts of gold, which they
need badly.
All enterprises arc

government-owned. But due to
unskilled management, the out
put is low. People lack necessary
commodities, and unemploy
ment prevails. Those with jobs
are so poorly paid that they can
hardly ever make ends meet. A
doctor earns 70 miasters a
month, the price of two small
chickens.
Letters of recommendation
from local authorities are re
quired to buy all commodities,
from a hammer and nails to a
coffin . . . These are some of the
economic reasons for leaving the
country.
Finally, we must recogni/e
that some people leave Vietnam
because they are burning with
wanderlust or are fascinated by
the glamorous but mistaken vis
ion of wealth acquired quickly
and easily.
Yet, not all men can afford the
eight ounces of gold to register
for the exodus, so many have
tried to sneak out. This is a very
difficult and dangerous thing,
now that the frontier police
know all the fugitives' tricks.
Policemen can be bribed, but the
majority of them betray you:
they take your gold and inform
their colleagues to arrest you in
order to get a share of the booty.
Out of every 10 fugitive boats,
seven are captured; the three

boats in 10 that succeed in reach
ing international waters meet
with disaster. They capsi/e. have
engine trouble, are marooned on
isolated islands, or run out
food and water so the lugiti\'es
die ol thirst or starvation. •
Nine out of 10 fugitive boats
are attacked by Thai pirates,
barbarous fishermen who rob
fugitives, rape the women and
throw their victims into the sea.
Still worse, when the fugitives
reach land, the coastal inhabit
ants of Thailand and Malaysia
mercilessly turn them away. The
navies of these countries tow the
fugitive boats back to sea and let
the people aboard drift to their
deaths.
The road to freedom is not an
easy one: it is a painful and peril
ous trek for Vietnamese tugi
tives. Those who now live in the
United States. France. Canada
and other countries should thank
providence for their good luck.
The communist noose now
tightens, now loosens, depending
on results or the system of man
agement. But it tightens more
than it loosens, and in the end
you are sure to strangle.
