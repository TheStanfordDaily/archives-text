## Founding fathers sought choice 
### 
One of the hallmarks of a
civilized society is the ability of
people with widely differing be
liefs and lifestyles to coexist
peacefully. The generally ac
cepted and eminently logical rule
governing peaceful coexistence
is that people should be free to
choose their lifestyles and
courses of action as long as they
do not violate the rights of
others. In other words, do your
own thing as long as you don't
hurt anyone.
There exists an outstanding
example in our history of what
happens when the government
attempts to legislate "morality":
the notorious experiment of
Prohibition from 1919 to 1933.
Not only did Prohibition fail to
eliminate the "problem" of al
cohol consumption, but it
created and fostered whole new
problems: Honest law-abiding
producers and suppliers were put
out of work. Much higher prices
for alcoholic beverages on the
thriving black market encour
aged organized crime to reap the
large profits involved in supply
ing the desired product. Con
sumers were faced with higher
prices and less quality control.
Police services were used to
harass peaceful citizens and were
pulled away from preventing real
crimes such as murder, rape, and

theft.
The health dangers of alcohol
and cigarettes are well known.
Vet in no way would this justify
an attempt by government to
take away the right of individuals
to regulate their own consump
tion of these "drugs". Any at
tempt by government to do us
the "favor" of making those de
cisions for us (taking away our
freedom) would be met with a
massive public outcry, and
rightly so. Let us apply this stan
ctird of freedom to other drims as
well.
The attempt by government to
legislate "morality" in the area
of marijuana use has failed. The
marijuana laws currently cost
California taxpayers an esti
mated $75 million annually (ac
cording to state studies), with
most of the funds being spent on
cases involving possession or cul
tivation of marijuana for per
sonal use (these funds could have
been used to fight real crime).
According to the statewide
California Poll, conducted by the
Field Research Corporation in
April, 1979, seven million
California adults (42 percent)
have used marijuana, with al
most three million considering
themselves to be current users
today. Arc these people crimi
nals? Whose rights have they vio

lated?
This is not "unrestricted free
dom" or "freedom from respon
sibility"; rather, it is the freedom
to engage (or not engage) in
noncoercive activities. This is the
freedom that our founding
fathers sought to ensure for all
people.
Imagine if one of the founding
fathers had proposed an addi
tional amendment for the Bill of
Rights which read: "The right of
the people to eat, drink, and
smoke what they want shall not
be abridged.'"

The concept of a governmcn
regulating these private matter;
of individuals was surely then ar
absurdity. Today it is a reality
Let us join together and proc
laim and defend the right of indi
viduals to make their own deci
sions without arbitrary gov
ernmental interference. I urge
everyone to support the Califor
nia Marijuana Initiative.
