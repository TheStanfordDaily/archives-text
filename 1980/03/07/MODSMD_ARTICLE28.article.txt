## Legalize marijuana 
### 
Even though I don't smoke it,
1 think marijuana should be
legalized for several reasons.
Just from the economic point of
view, it could be a tremendous
source of money.
If the sale of marijuana were
legal, the profit from the proba
ble multi-million dollar industry
could be taxed. There would be
no need for large-scale imports,
because American technology
could improve the quality of pot,
perhaps making it more appeal
ing than Acapulco Gold, kill the
awful smell while keeping the ef
fects, and making it safe from pes
ticides.
Production could be domi
nated by a few companies, thus
making the price rise and
marijuana less available to
younger kids who can't afford
expensive joints.
Let's face it. Marijuana is al
ready a social drug in the United
States. Today we hear about
prominent lawyers who distri-

Bute joints at their parties to ac
company drinks. If people are
going to smoke it, the govern
ment might as well make a profit
from it.
The government spends mill
ions of dollars every year enforc
ing laws concerning marijuana.
All the money saved plus the
money from taxes could be used
for cancer research. Ironic? No,
just one of the signs of the "prog
ress" of a highly developed na
tion.
The effects of marijuana have
not been proven to be any more
harmful than alcohol, cigarettes
or other drugs prescribed by
your friendly neighborhood doc
tor. Like alcohol, marijuana is a
crutch and a diversion lor many
people.
Marijuana should be
legalized. The decision to control
its use is up to each individual,
not the government.
