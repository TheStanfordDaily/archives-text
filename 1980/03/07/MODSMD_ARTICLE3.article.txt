# Extension cord blamed in Storey blaze
## 
### Chris Mills Staff Writer 
A too-thin electrical extension cord overheated
and started the lire that burned Storey House Mon
day. according to Santa Clara l ire Marshal Cliff
Johnson.
t niv ersit\ housing officials said that the hazard did
not result from archaic wiring, hut rather from an
all-too-common lack of fire safety awareness on the
part of students.
Johnson said extension cords such as the one that
caused Monday's blaze are a common cause of tires.
"The use of candles in dorms also causes a lot ot
fires at Stanford."' Johnson added. Another cause is
beds pushed up against heaters.
Near misses
Assistant Director of the Row Diana Conklin said
no one knows how many near misses there liav e been.
"During the cleaning and damage inspection of
one Row House last winter break, we found a mat
tress that was shoved up against a heater. That mat
tress was so hot no one could touch it." she added.
Apparently everyone in the house had left without
making a final tire safety check of the rooms.
Luck
"It was damned lucky that the house did not go up.
11 was just coincidence that it was one of the first to be
inspected," Conklin continued.
On the whole, however, fire safety on the Row is
carefully monitored. Conklin said she stresses fire
safety throughout the year at meetings of house man
agers. through specific recommendations and inspec
tions and by requiring each house to have at least one
lire drill.
In addition, impromptu fire drills occur whenever
one of the very sensitive smoke detectors gives a
"false alarm," she said.

"I don't consider those to be false alarms.' Stan
lord Police Chief and Director ol Public Safety Mar
vin Herrington replied, "because the smoke detector
did what it was supposed it do. It detected smoke.
Herrington said there is a continuing problem of
tampering with the fire alarm systems in the resi
dences. Students plug up horns or loosen alarm wires
st) thev don't have to listen to the noise during a false
alarm.
•"There is also a lot ol horseplay that goes on with
the lire extinguishers." he added, explaining that
there are 7()()(I lire extinguishers on campus and it is a
full-time job just recharging them and replacing the
stolen ones.
Herrington said extinguishers at Storey House
were recharged a month ago and two weeks before
that, one had lo be replaced because it was stolen.

Another problem is overloaded electrical outlets.
•'II you went through any house and saw how many
appliances students bring here with them, you would
be amazed." Herrington said "112 very one of them is a
potential fire hazard.
"li s a good idea to get into the habit of routinely
unplugging small appliances you are not using." he
advised.
A malfunction in a hair dryer or toaster is more
likely to be discovered it it is unplugged between
usages." he said.
Common sense
Johnson recommended that students use only
those extension cords that are heavy-duty and less
than six feet long.
Conklin admitted that wiring in some of the older
residences may seem somewhat inadequate, "but it
basically boils down to common sense on the part of
the students."

She recalled that last y car a lire at the Delta Kappa
Epsilon house was started h\ a pot of boiling butter
left unattended on a stove.
Tripped
I lerrington noted that a circuit breaker had tripped
at Storey I louse prior to the fire there, but was simpl\
reset without am attempt to locate the malfunction.
"Storey House had some additional electrical ser
\ ice put in several years back So far as we know the
Row houses are adequate tor normal electrical
loads," Director of Housing and Pood Services lid
Scoles said.
"We don't go into students' rooms, though, as a
regular practice." he added, "so we don't know what
is going on in them."
Cost
"Our first concern is life safety,"' Scoles explained.
I Ic explained it would cost about $2 million to install
sprinklers in all the Row houses. Instead, the I Univer
sity opted to spend SXOO.OOO last summer upgrading
fire escapes and smoke detection systems in Hianner,
loyon. Koble and 22 Row houses.
New residences are required to have sprinklers, as
was I lurlburt I louse when it was nio\ ed to its present
location. 55S May field. Delta Upsilon and Beta
rheta Pi are also equipped with sprinkler s\stems.
Harold Raphael, vice-president of (iowin and
Raphael Construction C ompany. Menlo Park. said
his firm completed $20,000 worth of lire safety mod
ilications at Storey House lasi August. Hie work
included new escapes, alarm systems and partitions.
"We are enthused that the work we did contributed
to preventing loss of life," Raphael said.
"We build in as much fire prevention as we can."
Herrington said, reflecting on the Storey fire.
But I can't say it is not going to happen again."
