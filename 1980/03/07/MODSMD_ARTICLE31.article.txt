## Should marijuana be decriminalized? Brad Brockbank Don't be caught plants down 
### 
lIIc removal of all criminal
penalties lor private possession
and use of marijuana has been
endorsed or recommended by
persons and private and public
agencies too numerous to men
tion here.
Notable among this company
are: President Jimmy Carter, the
American Medical Association,
the National Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse, the
American Bar Association, the
American Psychiatric Associa
tion and the Consumers Union.
Eleven states have changed
their laws and no longer treat
possession ol a small quantity ot
marijuana as a criminal act. In
California, one of the results ot
this law has been an estimated
$25 million savings to criminal
justice agencies alone. Yet only a
slight increase (less than 3 per
cent ) was reported in the number
of adults who have tried
marijuana since the new law be
came effective in January ot
1976. Frequency of use has de
lined in that period.
In the courts, marijuana
penalties have been declared un
constitutional on a number of
different grounds. The Supreme
Court of Alaska in 1975 unani
mously decided that adults have
a constitutionally-protected
right to possess or use marijuana
at home.
Dr. Robert DuPont, when he
was Director of the National In
stitute on Drug Abuse said in a
1 976 press briefing," . . .there is
no question that alcohol and to
bacco are causing us far more
health problems than marijuana

does."
112 rom the Shafer Commis
sion's (National Commission on
Marijuana and Drug Abuse)
findings:
— "The most notable state
ment that can be made about the
vast majority of marijuana
users, experimenters and inter
mittent users, is that they are es
sentially indistinguishable from
their non-marijuana using peers
by any fundamental criterion
other than their marijuana use."
— "'No conclusive evidence
exists ot any physical damage,
disturbances of bodily processes
or proven human fatalities at
tributable solely to even very
high doses of marijuana."
- "Neither the marijuana
user nor the drug itself can be
said to constitute a danger to
public safety."
— "Marijuana use per se does
not dictate whether other drugs
will be used, nor does it deter
mine the rate of progression, il
and when it occurs, or which
drug might be used . . . the fact
should be emphasized that the
overwhelming majority ot users
do not progress to other drugs."
In his Consumers Union
award-winning report, Edward
Brecher concluded, "It is now
much too late to debate the is
sue: marijuana versus no
marijuana. Marijuana is here to
stay. No conceivable law en
forcement policy can curb its av -
ailability."
Yet in the face of this tes
timony, it is astonishing to note
that more than $600 million in
law enforcement resources is
spent annually on marijuana ar
rests and prosecution. Think
about that at income tax time.
From all this and other sup
ports e evidence, it is hard to de
fend. on any rational basis, oppos
ition to the proposed California
Marijuana Initiative (CMI). Per
sonally, I am fairly optimistic
that the measure will be passed.
My concern is how the nation,
and California in particular, will
respond to "life after CMI".
Marijuana is currently a SI 0 bill
ion a year industry, by some es
timates. California boasts the
evil weed as its No. 1 cash crop.

with an estimated !i> I billion
being spent annually.
As fear and apprehension
about the drug lessens as it
almost certainly will this great
economic market will be an .it
tractive incentive lor legali/ation
of the drug for the adult popul.i
tion. And that means all those
fertile fields cigarette companies
are getting reads to plant
marijuana on will begin produc
ing mass-consumption weed.
And, like liquor and cigaict
tes. Uncle Sam will take Ins cut
and spend it on more bombs.
It is imperative that we begin
to think about these possible
scenarios, lest we be caught with
our "plants down," so to speak,
paying 6 1 2 percent or more just
to fatten the I S. Treasury's lar
der.
By thinking about these issues
now, we may be able to take con
structs e steps to ensure that am
taxes levied on the sale ol
marijuana be directed to bcneli
cia! uses, such as drug rehabilita
tion centers. Such a ' positive
feedback" system would thereby
tax use to fight abuse, somcthing
which would have been ol great
value to the alcohol and tobacco
industries, had any loresight
been applied.
In addition, revenues liom .1
state or national marijuana in
dustry could be channelled into
further research. Ihe more
people know about the drug, the
better they can make intormcd.
rational decisions about the role
it will play 111 their lives.
Ten years or so from now
marijuana could be the closest
thing to a perfect-competition
market, since some of the best
pot now available can be grown
on a hillside by amateur larmei s.
It's difficult to monopolize a
market with this kind ol Iree
entry and exit.
With foresight, the henelits ot
widespread marijuana use can be
maximized, and the costs can be
minimized. And il the public
wants marijuana legalized, let it
be on our terms and not the gov -
ern merit's.
