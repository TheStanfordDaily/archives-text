## No adult-proof cap 
### 
Presumably, present
marijuana laws exist to protect
individuals from the detrimental
effects of marijuana. I suggest
that the government is protect
ing the public a little more than is
called for in this case.
Excessive use of marijuana is
certainly harmful, hut there are
few substances on earth of which
this could not be said. The de
leterious effects of alcohol are
well documented, yet the gov
ernment allows that adults are
capable of regulating their liquor
intake as they see fit.
Marijuana is neither addictive
nor deadly — alcohol can be
both. It is ludicrous that an adult
can face serious criminal penalty
for using or growing marijuana
(for personal use) in the privacy
of his own residence.
The decriminalization of
marijuana would probably have
little effect on the quantity of
marijuana consumed on campus.
Those who do not presently in
dulge are not likely to turn
hedonistic overnight, while pre
sent marijuana users have prob
ably already established their

preferred intake level which .1
change of law would not ,1 licet
Intelligent people tend to .iei
in their own best interests (he
vision of faculty and students
constantly attending classes
while under the influence is he
lied by the very nature ol the
Stanford community. De
criminalizaiton of marijuana
would merely serve to remove
one source of paranoia trom our
increasingly regulated h\es.
Driving under the influence
and providing marijuana to
minors should remain criminal
offenses. Marijuana use need not
he encouraged, but it is another
thing to forbid it. In an era where
individual choice and responsi
bility are given less and less im
portance. the decriminalization
of marijuana would gi\ e back a
measure ol self-determination.
It's time the government
realized that marijuana doesn't
need an adult-proof cap.
