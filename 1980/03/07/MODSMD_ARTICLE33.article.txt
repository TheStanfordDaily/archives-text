Bollards and fire
It was with mixed feelings of
relief and concern that I read the
accounts of the Storey House
fire: relief because no one was
seriously injured, and concern
because of the bollards that de
layed the fire fighting equip
ment.
If was only by the grace of God
that someone was not badly in
jured, or worse. I lived through a
house fire in 1967 that took the
lives of my two infant children.
Smoke inhalation has been
recognized as the major killer in
all structural fires for many
years. Those two minutes that
the fire trucks lost, as a result of
the bollards, could have resulted
in a major tragedy, most likely
from smoke inhalation.
As Traffic Manager of the
University. I recognize the need
lor vehicular controls into the

inner campus; as a concerned
citizen, I seriously must question
the use of bollards as the most
viable solution.
No one was hurt this time, but
what about next time?

Jokes degrading
Do people actually read the
weekly jokeij, printed in the
center of'-the Daily's classified
ads? These jokes continually de
grade both men and women, re
ducing us to mere sexual objects.
Is this the sole criterion for
humor by the "friendly
neighborhood classified add
staff'?
We are surprised La Pizzeria
rewards a mentality that reflects
such a narrow view of humanity
and perpetuates the sexual dis
crimination that has often been

criticized on the Opinions page
of the Daily.
We* l hope next quarter La Piz
zeria and the classified ad staff
will change their criteria. They
might even discover that creativ
ity, variety and humor can
flourish in the Stanford commun
ity.

Offensive jokes
Can't you come up with any
thing better for your "Jokes for
Pizza"? Lately every single joke
has been offensive and un-witty.
I'm not a humorousless person,
nor do I mind an occasional

"dirty" joke (I'm a LSJUMB
member). But these depend on
shock value, not cleverness, for a
reaction. In every ease the es
sence of the female character's
reason for being seems to be be
tween her legs, and this offends
me as a human being. Please, if
you can't do better, discontinue
this unpleasant column.

Editor's note: The Daily
apologizes to the community for
publishing several less-than
tasteful jokes recently in the
"Jokes for Pizzas" section of our
classified ad page. We have
hereto operated under the policy
of publishing one joke each week,
regardless of the quality or taste-
Julness of the few submitted
jokes. From now on, the Daily

will publish jokes only when they
meet on r standards of taste fulness
and humor. We appreciate the let
ters from those members of the
community who had the sensitiv
ity to object to unquestionably of
fensive jokes.

In Monday's Stanford Daily
my name appeared in conjunc
tion with the lead story concern
ing the elimination of the trench
Theme House. I feel the article
was unfair and misleading for
three reasons.
I irst. it contained inaccurate
information. The article states
that I wrote the 112 ast Asian Study
Mouse proposal. This statement
is false. Last year I was one ol
live individuals who contributed
their ideas to the proposal. The

actual proposal was written hy
Ken Kurosu and Susan Essoyan.
hoth either present or past writ
ers and editors for the Daily.
This year a new group headed hy
VVoll Broley modified last year's
proposal.
Second, the writer of the arti
cle never interviewed me.
Quotes attributed to me were
taken from an interview which I
gave the Daily several days he
fore any decision had been
reached concerning theme
houses. The interview was osten
sibly to have been used as
background information for an
in-depth article on theme
houses. I was never informed
that my statements would appear
in another article.
Finally, misleading statements
contained in the article have
created a great deal of misun
derstanding between mvself and

other mem Iters ot the commun
ity. This misunderstanding could
have been avoided had the au
thor checked his tacts he lore
printing the story.

Editor's note: The Daily
apologizes to Mr. C lielherg lor
slightly misrepresenting Ins integ
ral role in the preparation of the
Last Asian Studies House prop
osal. However, the Daily stands
by its story reporting the elimina
tion of the trench House. The
story was accurate and the )acl
thai Mr. Clielherg's on-the
record statements to a Daily re
porter were used in a scpai ate, hut
related article does nothing to di
minish the accuracy or prophet)
of the Daily '.s article or the repor
ter's* actions.
