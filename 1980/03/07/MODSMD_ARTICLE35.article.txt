# ON CALL
## 
### 
At long last, the perfect Valentine's Day column
has passed my desk, and I can't resist it. If you're
munching on month-old chocolates, I'm sure you'll
find the following Los Angeles Times message ir
resistible, too.
There is a chemical in chocolate, also found in
the human brain, that three New York researchers
believe is directly related to the emotional highs
and lows of being in love. And for the past several
years they have been testing their theory on a spe
cial group of patients known as hysteriod dys
phorics.
Hysteriod dysphoria is a psychiatric diagnosis for
people who frequently become severely depressed
over unrequited love s
"These are patients who tend to become over
involved in romantic relationships," said Dr. David
Schwartz, a psychologist and research associate at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute, which is
conducting the study. "They fall in love too
quickly. And when they're rejected, they crash.
They overeat, oversleep and feel intense inertia
and lethargy. Their lives are roller coasters of ups
and downs. This happens so frequently that it im
pairs their functioning, their ability to enjoy liv
ing."
Schwartz, along with psychiatrists Michael
Liebowitz and Donald Klein, think this suffering is
linked to the production of a chemical called
phenylethvlamine, a natural substance very much
like amphetamines. These same patients, Schwartz
said, often have a history of amphetamine abuse —
and their mood disorder symptoms often resemble
those of persons either taking or withdrawing from
amphetamines.
Phenylethlamine is also found in chocolate — in
extremely high levels.
"Interestingly, these patients will say that they
binge on chocolate when they are depressed — that
they crave sweets," Schwartz said." I don't know of
any other foods that are that high in
phenylethylamine. It's speculative — highly
speculative — that their bingeing might be an un
conscious attempt at self-medication, but I
wouldn't feel totally uncomfortable with it."
Hysteriod dysphorics are usually women —
probably because the majority of people who tradi
tionally seek psychiatric help are women — who
experience short-lived or tumultous relationships.
"Their constant intrusive need for attention and
praise often provokes abandonment by the part
ner," Liebowitz and Klein wrote in a recent paper
on the subject.
The preliminary conclusion of the researchers is

that the trouble stems from an irregularity in the
production of the chemical and that its production
is probably more level in people considered nor
mal.
By combining traditional psychotherapy with
the use of drugs known as monoamine oxidase
inhibitors, or MAO inhibitors, which seem to im
prove the regulation of the production ol
phenylethylamine, the researchers have seen
dramatic changes in their patients.
"(Their) marked emotional reactivity is said to
be modified, allowing for more rational judgments
and planning," Liebowitz and Klein wrote. "Also,
since they cease to become as dysphoric in reaction
to loss or disapproval, there is a decreased dri\ e for
continual romantic involvement or alcohol or drug
abuse."
Returning to "On Call" mode, forever indebted
to the wire services for rescuing a stranded column,
I would caution that chocolate is no wonder druv.
no panacea for all of life's little aches and pains.
Should you be one of those unfortunates allergic to
chocolate, it can be quite detrimental to your state
of well-being and uncomfortable as well. Also,
cocoa contains caffeine, and those sensitive to that
stimulant may experience trouble sleeping at night
after consuming chocolate.
Of a more universal nature, good-tasting choco
late is loaded with sugar and rather empty calorics
— a definite substance to be avoided by weight
watchers.
On to a topic near and dear to our hearts: prep
aration for exams.
I've been taking a lot of No Do/ lately while
cramming for tests. Are over-the-counter, non
prescription drugs like this harmful?

Dear Bright Eyes.
In your case, it you follow the directions, over
the-counter drugs should not be physically danger
ous. Amphetamines, such as No Doz. which con
tains large quantities of caffeine, can. however,
confuse you psychologically. according to C 'ounsel
ing and Psychological Services counselors. Such
drugs can create the delusion that you are smartei
and more knowledgeable than you actually are (a
feeling many students here possess anyway i.
Therefore, if you take \o Do: immediately preced
ing an exam, you could be placing yourself at a real
disadvantage. An exeessiv e amount of caffeine c an
also trigger nervous responses such as shakes and
jitters.

years they have been testing their theory on a spe
cial group of patients known as hysteriod dys
phorics.
Hysteriod dysphoria is a psychiatric diagnosis for
people who frequently become severely depressed
over unrequited love s
"These are patients who tend to become over
involved in romantic relationships," said Dr. David
Schwartz, a psychologist and research associate at
the New York State Psychiatric Institute, which is
conducting the study. "They fall in love too
quickly. And when they're rejected, they crash.
They overeat, oversleep and feel intense inertia
and lethargy. Their lives are roller coasters of ups
and downs. This happens so frequently that it im
pairs their functioning, their ability to enjoy liv
ing."
Schwartz, along with psychiatrists Michael
Liebowitz and Donald Klein, think this suffering is
linked to the production of a chemical called
phenylethvlamine, a natural substance very much
like amphetamines. These same patients, Schwartz
said, often have a history of amphetamine abuse —
and their mood disorder symptoms often resemble
those of persons either taking or withdrawing from
amphetamines.
Phenylethlamine is also found in chocolate — in
extremely high levels.
"Interestingly, these patients will say that they
binge on chocolate when they are depressed — that
they crave sweets," Schwartz said." I don't know of
any other foods that are that high in
phenylethylamine. It's speculative — highly
speculative — that their bingeing might be an un
conscious attempt at self-medication, but I
wouldn't feel totally uncomfortable with it."
Hysteriod dysphorics are usually women —
probably because the majority of people who tradi
tionally seek psychiatric help are women — who
experience short-lived or tumultous relationships.
"Their constant intrusive need for attention and
praise often provokes abandonment by the part
ner," Liebowitz and Klein wrote in a recent paper
on the subject.
The preliminary conclusion of the researchers is

that the trouble stems from an irregularity in the
production of the chemical and that its production
is probably more level in people considered nor
mal.
By combining traditional psychotherapy with
the use of drugs known as monoamine oxidase
inhibitors, or MAO inhibitors, which seem to im
prove the regulation of the production ol
phenylethylamine, the researchers have seen
dramatic changes in their patients.
"(Their) marked emotional reactivity is said to
be modified, allowing for more rational judgments
and planning," Liebowitz and Klein wrote. "Also,
since they cease to become as dysphoric in reaction
to loss or disapproval, there is a decreased dri\ e for
continual romantic involvement or alcohol or drug
abuse."
Returning to "On Call" mode, forever indebted
to the wire services for rescuing a stranded column,
I would caution that chocolate is no wonder druv.
no panacea for all of life's little aches and pains.
Should you be one of those unfortunates allergic to
chocolate, it can be quite detrimental to your state
of well-being and uncomfortable as well. Also,
cocoa contains caffeine, and those sensitive to that
stimulant may experience trouble sleeping at night
after consuming chocolate.
Of a more universal nature, good-tasting choco
late is loaded with sugar and rather empty calorics
— a definite substance to be avoided by weight
watchers.
On to a topic near and dear to our hearts: prep

I've been taking a lot of No Do/ lately while

Dear Bright Eyes.
In your case, it you follow the directions, over
the-counter drugs should not be physically danger
ous. Amphetamines, such as No Doz. which con
tains large quantities of caffeine, can. however,
confuse you psychologically. according to C 'ounsel
ing and Psychological Services counselors. Such
drugs can create the delusion that you are smartei
and more knowledgeable than you actually are (a
feeling many students here possess anyway i.
Therefore, if you take \o Do: immediately preced
ing an exam, you could be placing yourself at a real
disadvantage. An exeessiv e amount of caffeine c an
also trigger nervous responses such as shakes and
jitters.

At long last, the perfect Valentine's Day column
has passed my desk, and I can't resist it. If you're
munching on month-old chocolates, I'm sure you'll
find the following Los Angeles Times message ir
resistible, too.
There is a chemical in chocolate, also found in
