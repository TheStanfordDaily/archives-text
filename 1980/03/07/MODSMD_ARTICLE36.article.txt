## DiBiaso: one last chance 
### 
I he 1979-80 Stanford basketball season drew to a close
last weekend with a bang. The Cards upset USC in over
time. played reasonably well against I (.'LA and Kimberly
Helton, an honorable mention All-American, rewrote the
record books by finishing up his career ahead of Claude
lerry in scoring and Rich Kelley in rebounding. Sounds
pretty good, huh?
I lie catch is. the weekend also ended one of the most
dismal seasons in Stanford basketball history. It was a 7-14
year which featured an eight-game losing streak. The team
was a scrappy one. there's no doubt about that, but it was
also an inexperienced one which turned the ball o\ er far too
many times to compete seriously in the Pac-10. It wasn't
until near the end of the season — the Arizona road trip —
that Stanford started to play fairly good conference basket
ball. By then it was too late.
But maybe that's why the team loosened up — it had
nothing to lose. The Cards started to play as though they
were on the playground instead of in Maples. They looked
confident at the end, like a bunch of guys out to have a good
time. Earlier they had looked a lot more like Custer trying
to explain the Last Stand. As forward Brian Welch said at
the time." Maybe next year we can do something. Tins year
we just want to go out and knock somebody off."
And they did. In tact, they knocked off a few teams they
never should have. Stanford went out and snapped the
losing streak against Washington, beat Cal. beat Oregon
and finished up by upsetting L'SC to tie the Ducks and
Trojans tor seventh in the conference.
In effect, what the Cards did was pull the season out by
the skin ot their teeth — mostly Belton's teeth. They re
scued a team which was headed for the record books as the
worst ever. 11 was a good showing by an improv ed team and
a superb effort by Belton. who led the team through it all.
But the last-minute heroics were tainted, by that awful,
haunting questiv... of what the hell the Cards are going to do
next year when their king-pin is gone.
, Belton's graduation will mark the end of an era — a
period highlighted by a couple of very good players —
Belton and Wolfe Perry (Perry graduated last spring) —
who carried a mediocre team on their backs for four years.
The loss of Perry at guard was plain this year, especially
after Daryle Morgan was injured early on. With Belton
gone, the present Cards would simply sink in the Pac-10
mire. All they can hope for is a great recruiting year.
Throughout the season, fingers were pointed back and
forth as the community looked for the cause of Stanford's
woes. A lot of them, of course, fell on coach Dick Dißiaso.
After five years of losing basketball on the Farm, this was
only to be expected.
But this also goes right to the heart of the problem be
cause Dißiaso is a good basketball coach. Ask any of his
colleagues in the conference. I asked a few.
— Cieorge Raveling, Washington State:
•"I went through the same thing at WSU for three years.
Dißiaso is doing a good job under the circumstances. I think
lie's une ot the best prepared coaches around. This is not an
easy league to be in. but given time he'll do it."
— Larry Brown. UCLA:
"Stanford doesn't exactly top the league in talent, hut
Dick is doing a good job with what he has. These guys are
one of the most disciplined teams in the league."
— Ralph Miller. Oregon State:
"It's too bad. I think Dick does a gt .id job with what he
has on hand. They need a good, big post man and they need
to improve their overall quickness, but he's doing all right."
Those are three of the best minds in college basketball
speaking, and they all seem to agree that what Dißiaso
needs to start winning is better personnel.
Dißiaso came to Stanford from Notre Dame pegged as a
tireless and good recruiter. He hasn't done that well on the
harm. Ot course he faces a lot of obstacles here, mainly the
admissions requirements and the school's less-than
glowing basketball reputation. But maybe the biggest prob
lem is that Stanford is simply not Notie Dame, and it's a lot
easier to recruit for the Irish. Perhaps Dißiaso is not the
recruiting whiz he was supposed to be.
The coach probably saved his neck by stalling against
Oregon State. It was not so much a piece of coaching genius
as a showing that he has the kind of guts and personality that
makes college basketball such a great game. But he has to
start producing the recruits because all his cards are played
now. The end of this season bought him another chance.
Let's hope he uses it.

to improve their overall quickness, but he's doing all right."
Those are three of the best minds in college basketball
speaking, and they all seem to agree that what Dißiaso
needs to start winning is better personnel.
Dißiaso came to Stanford from Notre Dame pegged as a
tireless and good recruiter. He hasn't done that well on the
harm. Ot course he faces a lot of obstacles here, mainly the
admissions requirements and the school's less-than
glowing basketball reputation. But maybe the biggest prob
lem is that Stanford is simply not Notie Dame, and it's a lot
easier to recruit for the Irish. Perhaps Dißiaso is not the
recruiting whiz he was supposed to be.
The coach probably saved his neck by stalling against
Oregon State. It was not so much a piece of coaching genius
as a showing that he has the kind of guts and personality that
makes college basketball such a great game. But he has to
start producing the recruits because all his cards are played
now. The end of this season bought him another chance.
Let's hope he uses it.
I he 1979-80 Stanford basketball season drew to a close
last weekend with a bang. The Cards upset USC in over
time. played reasonably well against I (.'LA and Kimberly
Helton, an honorable mention All-American, rewrote the
record books by finishing up his career ahead of Claude
lerry in scoring and Rich Kelley in rebounding. Sounds
pretty good, huh?
I lie catch is. the weekend also ended one of the most
dismal seasons in Stanford basketball history. It was a 7-14
year which featured an eight-game losing streak. The team
was a scrappy one. there's no doubt about that, but it was
also an inexperienced one which turned the ball o\ er far too
many times to compete seriously in the Pac-10. It wasn't
until near the end of the season — the Arizona road trip —
that Stanford started to play fairly good conference basket
ball. By then it was too late.
But maybe that's why the team loosened up — it had
nothing to lose. The Cards started to play as though they
were on the playground instead of in Maples. They looked
confident at the end, like a bunch of guys out to have a good
time. Earlier they had looked a lot more like Custer trying
to explain the Last Stand. As forward Brian Welch said at
the time." Maybe next year we can do something. Tins year
we just want to go out and knock somebody off."
And they did. In tact, they knocked off a few teams they
never should have. Stanford went out and snapped the
losing streak against Washington, beat Cal. beat Oregon
and finished up by upsetting L'SC to tie the Ducks and
Trojans tor seventh in the conference.
In effect, what the Cards did was pull the season out by
the skin ot their teeth — mostly Belton's teeth. They re
scued a team which was headed for the record books as the
worst ever. 11 was a good showing by an improv ed team and
a superb effort by Belton. who led the team through it all.
But the last-minute heroics were tainted, by that awful,
haunting questiv... of what the hell the Cards are going to do
next year when their king-pin is gone.
, Belton's graduation will mark the end of an era — a
period highlighted by a couple of very good players —
Belton and Wolfe Perry (Perry graduated last spring) —
who carried a mediocre team on their backs for four years.
The loss of Perry at guard was plain this year, especially
after Daryle Morgan was injured early on. With Belton
gone, the present Cards would simply sink in the Pac-10
mire. All they can hope for is a great recruiting year.
Throughout the season, fingers were pointed back and
forth as the community looked for the cause of Stanford's
woes. A lot of them, of course, fell on coach Dick Dißiaso.
After five years of losing basketball on the Farm, this was
only to be expected.
But this also goes right to the heart of the problem be
cause Dißiaso is a good basketball coach. Ask any of his
colleagues in the conference. I asked a few.
— Cieorge Raveling, Washington State:
•"I went through the same thing at WSU for three years.
Dißiaso is doing a good job under the circumstances. I think
lie's une ot the best prepared coaches around. This is not an
easy league to be in. but given time he'll do it."
— Larry Brown. UCLA:
"Stanford doesn't exactly top the league in talent, hut
Dick is doing a good job with what he has. These guys are
one of the most disciplined teams in the league."
— Ralph Miller. Oregon State:
"It's too bad. I think Dick does a gt .id job with what he
has on hand. They need a good, big post man and they need
to improve their overall quickness, but he's doing all right."
