### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
After a two-hour rain delay
and withstanding some unsea
sonably cold weather, the Stan
ford Women's Tennis Team eas
ily disposed of California State-
Fullerton S-l yesterday and in
creased their undefeated record
to 6-0.
The Cards swept all the singles
matches to clinch the victory
early and then won two of the
three doubles matches.
Alicia Moulton, who last year
won the AIAW doubles champ
ionship as a freshman, knocked
off Pia Tamayo in the number
one singles match 6-4, 6-2.
Following her. Donna Rubin
grabbed the number-two singles
victory 6-3. 6-1 over Carol
Christian, and Gayle Chan
crushed Karen Peterson 6-0. 6-2
in the number-three match.
Lisa Gordon handled Irene
Corona 6-2. 6-2 in the fourth
spot and Judv Jordon breezed to
a 6-1. 6-3 victory over Carolyn
Knight in the number-five sing
les match to clinch the team win.
In the number-six singles
match, Susie Barbie squeaked to

a first set victory by defeating
Carol Sawa 5-4 in a tie-breaker
and then stormed to a h-2 second
set win, claiming the match while
the Cards swept in the singles.
As the victory became
academic and the cold began to
deepen, Stanford had more
trouble in the late doubles
matches.
In the first match. Rubin
teamed with Caryn Copeland to
easily defeat Tamayo and Knight
6-2, 6-4, but then the tables
turned.
Fullerton's second team of
Peterson and Christian embar
rassed Gordon and Chan 6-1 in
the first set. Gordon and Chan
were teamed together when
Coach Frank Brennan decided
not to play Chan's regular dou
bles partner Julia Leighton be
cause of an injury.
Brennan remarked, "These
two usually don't play together,
but I had to put them together
because Julia has been having
problems with her back â€” back
spasms."
The pair continued to have
problems in the second set as
Gordon lost her service to make

it 1-3. and the> then fell behind
3()-love in the next game.
Sparked to life. Gordon rifled a
volley between the startled Ful
lerton players, and Chan fol
lowed with a blistering service
return winner to tie the game at
30-all. A surprised Fullerton
pair then botched an overhead
and hit a \olley long to lose ser
vice.
Chan and Gordon continued
their comeback and grabbed the
set 6-4. As darkness fell, how
ever. the final set was decided by
a nine-point tie-breaker at the
suggestion of both coaches, and
Stanford dropped it 5-3 for the
only loss of the match.
The third doubles match bet
ween Stanford's Corinne
Nevinny-Jordan and Sawa-
Quon was also decided by a tie
breaker because of darkness, but
this time the Cards won.
Nevinny and Jordon took the
lirst set (i-4 before being cleaned
in the second 6-1. They stormed
back, however, and won the tie
breaker 5-2 and the match 6-4,
I-6, 5-4 (tb).
Stanford faces two tough
matches this weekend at Arizona
and Arizona State and doesn't
return home until April 14, when
the team hosts Santa Clara.
