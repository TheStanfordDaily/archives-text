# Rennert talks about being No. 2 in U.S.
## 
### 
Editors note: I'eter Rennert has
been tit Stanford for Jon r years now
and lias seen tlieni come and seen
them go. He was there in 197S
w hen Stanford had the best team in
\( 1 A history -a squad headed by
none other than John McEnroe.
Now Rennert is the one on to/> oj
the Stanford tennis team and last
week he was voted No. 2 in the
country. In this Friday Interview
with Sally Jenkins, Rennert gives
some insight into what it's like to be
in the limelight.
Jenkins: Yon were just rated
number two in the country. How
do you feel about that? Have you
ever played the guy who is
number one?
Kennert: Yes, I've heaten him
every time I've played him. It's a
new system of ranking and it has
a lot of fallacies that need to he
worked out. It doesn't account
for who you play, for one thing.
The teams from back East play
very weak teams. A guy can win
his first few individual matches
and then have pretty much of a
wrap on number one for the rest
of the year. I haven't believed in
the system since it was first insti
tuted. Even if it put me at
number one, I still wouldn't.
Jenkins: Do you think you have
improved at the rale John McEn
roe or Matt Mitchell did while
they were here?
Kennert: That's tough to say. be
cause John was already good
when he got here. But college did
help him. Matt. I think 1 have
improved a lot more than he did
because he went from number
four to number one and 1 have
gone from number seven to
number one, and I wasn't highly
recruited. When I came here 1
was not ranked in the world, and
now I'm thirtieth or fortieth,
somewhere in there.
Jenkins: Is there any pressure on
you knowing that you are the next
one to carry on the Stanford ten
nis tradition?
Kennert: No, not from the tradi
tion or anythint> like that. But

now that I'm ranked so highly
everyone wants to heat me
Whenever I play a match I know
that they are gome to play iIil
best lhoy possibly can because
they want to beat me. I'm not
used to being the sole target It's
tough. Like Tuesday (Note Re
ntierl tost to Nial Brush 2-ft, 6- 7
Tuesday). I went out there think
ing that I was going to win be
cause I'm number two or be
cause I'm Peter Rennert and I
was supposed to win. He came
out ready to play and wanting t<»
beat me. So every time I go out I
have to have a better attitude,
because otherwise anyone can
beat me. That was proven 1 ties
day.
Jenkins: What are your thoughts
on turning pro?
Rennert: I'm going to as soon .is
the season ends, as soon as I
graduate. Everyone thought I
should have after last season, all
my peers did, because I was turn
ing down a lot of money.
Jenkins: How do you deal n ull
the traveling and the tennis and
school at the same time?
Rennert: I used to be pretty good
at it. You have to- budget youi
time: you go to class in the morn
ing, play tennis in the afternoons
and study at night. You can't gel
much work done on the road, so I
have to do a lot of cramming. I his
year, though, I think I h;i\c
senioritis or whatever you call it
I'm really struggling. I am ha\ing
a hard time getting motivated.
Jenkins: In Sports Bulletin
Magazine, coach I Dick) Gould
was quoted as saying, "Tennis is a
sport where the athlete is usuall\
spoon-fed. They start expecting
things and thinking something is
owed to them." What do you
think about that? Does it apply to
you at all?
Rennert: He said that? I don'l
think I can agree with that. II he
is saying that athletes arc
spoiled, I don't think that's true.
It's not fair to say that. It sounds
as it he is talking about the big
gies. I don't!hink it is as negative
as it sounds. When everyone puts
them up on pedestals all the
time, you can't expect them to
act totally normal.
Jenkins: What do you think of
McEnroe's behavior on the
court.' Does it have anything to
ilo with what Could is saying?
Kennert: It depends; he has bad
days when he is really offensive
on the court. But you have to
realize that he started out with
the worst reputation in tennis.
That combined with becoming a
superstar gives him a bad name
— he has received a lot of grief
about it. But he has done a lot to
improve it that you don't see it
you just read the press. He still
has his days of course, but in
general he really is better.
A lot of it is just personality on
the court, and I think that's good
for the game, actually. If
everyone played like Borg, the

game would be boring. There are
guys out there that are eight or
nine in the world that play like he
does, baseline players, and you
don't ever hear from them.
When Mac was fifteenth in the
world he was already well
known. I think it's good for the
game, just like Nastase was good
for the game until he became too
offensive.
Jenkins: How did you first get
interested in tennis? Did your pa
rents have anything to do with it?
Kennert: Well, they gave me my
first racket but thev didn't have
anything to do with my entering
competition or anything like
that. I started hitting a ball
around when I was seven hut I
didn't start competing 111 tour
naments until I was 14. which is
late for people at my level. 1
realized that tennis was my best
sport, but in high school I still
played other sports because 1
knew that when I came to college
I would be concentrating on ten

nis. There are a lot of things I
can't do — like skiing, because it
would be dangerous. Before I
started at college. I went skiing
for a month in Colorado.
Jenkins: How about people like
Chris Evert who have been play
ing so long that they get burned
out early? Can you foresee any
thing like that ever happening to
you ?
Kennert: No. because I started
late. When 1 was seven 1 was
just a little kid hitting tennis
balls around; people would sav I
was good for my age. but I stunk.
Also, men's and women's tennis
is a whole different thing. Men
play in all the junior tourna
ments but they don't really peak
until they are 21. With women,
they are peaking at 14. Twenty -
fix e is young, but Chris has put in
10 sears playing tennis, and that

is a long time. I'm starting out at
21. so at 3 1 I guess I'll be burned
out.
Jenkins: Is there anything that
you don't like about playing ten
nis at vour level?
Kennert: Well, college is diffe
rent from the pros. I've been
spoiled playing on the pro tour.
Even though I don't like line
men. I have gotten used to them,
and sou don't have them at the
college level. There are lots of
differences, another is that now
sou play with no-adds.
Also, it's much tougher be
cause I am playing down at this
level. Every time 1 go out 1 am
expected to v\in. I don't mind it.
but it's a lot tougher. Even
though the competition is easier,
it is actually mentally much
tougher.
