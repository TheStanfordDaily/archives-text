# Sun Devils scorch Stanford, 34-2

TI Ml'li — You couldn't call
it a loss. Even labeling it a
humiliation would be an under
statement. Perhaps the most ac
curate description of last night's
baseball game would be to sa>
that Arizona State kicked Stan

ford's ass, 34-2.
There are many conjectures as
to why the Cards suffered such a
ludicrously lopsided defeat,
(lusty winds and cold tempera
tures made the Sun Devils' field
seem like the old days ot
Candlestick Park. This factor
obviously affected Stanford hit

ting and fielding, as only six hits
were collected, while seven er
rors were committed.
The Pacific-10 conference is
the 1 inest league for baseball in
the country and no team will
dominate its opponent game
after game.
And yet. why were the Cards
so thoroughly trounced? After
all. they are the top-ranked team
in the nation and just finished
taking two of three from No. 3
Arizona.
Aside from the weather, the
other dominant factor was
momentum. Arizona State had it
from the start.
Scoring three runs in the first
on a homer with two men on. the

Sun Devils never let up. They
tallied two more in the second,
three 111 the fourth, and climaxed
the slaughter with a marathon
15-run seventh inning that saw
Ic> hatters come to the plate.
Stanford never had a chance.
The fourth inning typified the
Cards' evening. With a great op
portunity to get hack into the
game — or at least make it re
spectable— the Cards settled for
a single, unearned run.
John Elway opened the fourth
with a walk. Mike I oothman fol

third base. An errant throw at
