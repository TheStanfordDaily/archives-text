# Ruggers face Cal
## 
### 
The Card ruggers face their
toughest challenge of the season
as they square off against UC-
Berkeley Saturday. The match
should prove to be one of the
most exciting of the year, since it
involves two of the hottest col
lege rugby teams in California.
Led by outside-center
Timothy O' Brian, Cal has had
one of their best seasons in years.
O'Brian, one of the best players
in the area, provides the offen
sive punch for the Bears, and
their big, experienced scrum has
continually punished opponents.
In fact. Cal has played so well
that they were recently seeded
seventh in the Monterey Na
tional Tournament.
I lowever, now 7-3 for the sea
son (7-0 against university
sides), the Cardinals have domi
nated their share of opponents.
Most recently the Cards wal
loped Santa Clara 57-0 â€” one of
the largest margins of victory in
Stanford Rugby history.

Nevertheless, the Cardinal
squad will have their work cut
out for them. Not only will the
Stanford backline have to con
tain O'Brian et al.. but the Stan
ford scrum will have to control a
much larger Cal pack (Stanford
could be outweighed by as much
as 25 pounds per man).
l.ast year the Cards defeated a
similar Cal team 24- 1 ) and re
turned the Big Scrum Axe to the
Farm. Cal will be seeking re
venge on Saturday, and of
course, the traditional rivalry be
tween the two adds a little extra
to the match. Yet, this year's
game provides even mf>re. Stan
ford serum-half Pete Dailey exp
lains. "Both teams need this win
to gain momentum and confi
dence for the Monterey Tour
nament (March 22 and 23). But
on top of that, we set up two
goals at the start of this season:
I ) to beat UCLA and 2) to beat
Cal. We accomplished one goal;
now we want the other one."
