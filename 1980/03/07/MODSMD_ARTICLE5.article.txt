## 
### Mike Charlson Staff Writer 
The University's operating budget
will increase $17.1 million next year to
5147 million it a proposed budget is
approved by the Hoard ol Trustrees
next week as expected.
The proposal to increase the budget
13.2 percent, from its current $130-
million level, was unveiled at separate
briefings for faculty and student lead
ers yesterday.
Half of the incremental expenditure
will be used for increases in salaries and
benefits for faculty and staff.
The operating budget includes ex
penditures for instruction plus much of
the overhead for other University ser
vices. The budget represents about
one-third of the nearly half-billion
dollar consolidated budget, which also
includes auxiliary services like housing
and food service plus the Medical
Center and research facilities such as
the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SI.AC).
Balanced
Ihe budget is expected to be ba
lanced again next year despite inflation
and growth pressures, according to
Raymond Bacchetti. vice provost for

budget and planning. The University is
expecting a balanced budget this year
after posting small surpluses over the
past few years.
Faculty salaries are expected to in
crease an average I 1 percent under the
proposal with merit being the overrid
ing criterion in individual raise deci
sions.
Increases for non-exempt staff
employees (those elegible for overtime
after 40 hours of work per week) will
include a base increase of 10 percent
plus 2.5 percent "step" increases re
lated to length of service. In addition,
the University will increase the
maximum salary range by 2.5 percent
next year, gi\ ing some of the Universi
ty's "oldest and most dedicated
employees" a reward for their efforts,
according to Bacchetti.
Merit
Exempt staff will receive merit in
creases of up to 14 percent, averaging
10 percent. Staff employees who arc
members of United Stanford
Employees will receive the X percent
increase negotiated as part of their bar
gaining agreement reached last year,
plus 2.5 percent step increases.
In addition, approximately $1 mill

ion will be spent on a new dental plan
for all regular faculty and staff.
All told, the salary and benefits im
provements are expected to total over
$N. 5 million.
Necessary
The increases in salaries are needed.
Bacchetti said, because of inflation and
because "this University runs on the
talent of some very talented people,
and these people need to be re
warded."
Of the remaining incremental
money, most will go to maintain cur
rent programs at their nominal levels.

Included in the proposals is a
$700.000 increased expenditure on
undergraduate financial aids. Over
$7.3 million will he spent on the prog
ram under the budget.
Larger allowances
I he proposal includes increased al
lowances for the higher tuition, room
and hoard charges lor next year. In ad
dition. student hook and personal ex
pense allowances will he increased 10
percent to $BXO. and travel allowances
will also rise.
Moreover, a new method of deter-
mining parental ability to pay will re
sult in parental contribution actuallv
decreasing an average $«S5 per student.
Normally, an increase 111 parental con
tribution approximately equal to the
increase in personal income nation
wide would be expected. That would be
about N percent this year. Bacchetti
said.
But while allowances arc rising, so
are University expectations of the stu
dents. Sell-help expectations will in
crease S350 next year to S2450. usually
evenly divided between work during
the school year and loans.
Moreover, the University will in
crease the expected summer earnings
for entering frosh $150 and for con
tinuing students $ 1 (K).
Similar
I niv ersity self-help expectations arc
comparable with most other institu
tions with which it is normally com
pared. Bacchetti said.
I he University has an obligation to
fulfill its stated policy ol meeting all the

Substantial impact
Proposition 9 would alleet the I in

on the Calilornia State Scholarship
Program could mean a $700,000 loss m
