# Spikers seek redemption
## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
"These matches are going to
be a chance to redeem ourse
lves."
This was coach Fred Sturm's
appraisal of the two road
matches his men's volleyball
team will undertake after being
trounced by Long Beach State
last week. Tonight the Cardinals
will visit Cal Poly-San Luis
Obispo, followed by a match at
UC-Santa Barbara on Saturday.
Stanford has won three of
se\ en matches this year, sporting
a 1-4 record in the CIVA. Last
season the Cards didn't win their
third confrontation until their
tenth match.
The Long Beach State match
last week gave a talse impression
of what the team can do. accord
ing to Sturm. "1 think the gu\s
were humiliated Friday night.
They want to bounce back and
play the way they're capable ol
playing â€” they want to show
themselves that they're capable
of playing a lot better." he noted.
Despite the loss of much of last
year's squad to graduation, Cal
Poly still plays "very aggressive

with a lot of hustle." Sturm
pointed out. Stanford might find
a bigger challenge at UC-Santa
Barbara, however, since Sturm
regards the team as one of the
strongest in the conference.
Nevertheless the mentor feels
that "this weekend we can win
two matches."
One lineup change the Cards
will sport this weekend will be

the return ol Kip Hngenat setter.
The sophomore missed the I ong
Reach State match due to an
ankle injury. Sturm explained
that E:ngen's presence will deli
nitely give the team a boost sav
ing. "The guys look up to Kip not
only lor his offensive play, hut
also tor his leadership." Rngen
commented that the ankle is still
a little tender, but that he can
play on it.
