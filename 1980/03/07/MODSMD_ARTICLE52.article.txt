As we walked into this jewel of
downtown San Mateo, we were
met by the French accent ot
Roger Nicolas, owner and man
ager. The quiet elegance of the
establishment made itsell known
as we were escorted by our hos
tess to a table for two topped by a
single rose.
Looking around the room we
noticed that the small, cloth
covered tables were not sepa
rated by any partitions. The soft
brightness of the room was pro
vided by flickering candle-lamps
on each table.
Our room looked out on a ter
race and a Tudor-style building
across the street. There were two
smaller rooms tucked away
around corners.
Keeping with the refined yet
relaxed French countryside
motif of this eating house, the
waiters wore tuxedos sans jac
kets.
We began our meal with an
apertif, Dubonnet and Sherry.
No American restaurant this;
other cocktails are not served.
Next on the menu was the
choice of four hors d'oeuvres,
one of which was escargots. We
had the Mousse de Foie de
Canard (duck's liver pate —
$3.95 for two) which came with
radish and pickle. The sliced
Mousse was a good opener —
light and not too strong.
The bread served was, ap
propriately, sections of long, thin
French loaves.
From the extensive wine list
we choose the house chablis
from the Thorin winery which is
bottled especially for La
Fotiniere. It was refreshing and
complemented our meal well.
Our waiter next brought us the
soup du jour, which is included
with the price of each entree. Mr.
Nicolas happened to be passing
our table at this time and he
commented that our vegetable
soup was made entirely of fresh
vegetables. The soup had the
consistency of pea soup and the
vegetables were chopped no big

ger than the size of peas.
The salad, also included with
the entree, followed. It was but
ter lettuce well tossed in a lightK
seasoned oil and vinegar dres
sing.
The impeccable service of this
restaurant began to dawn on me
at about this point in our meal.
Members of the stall, and
Nicolas himself, periodically
sauntered through the restaurant
checking each table and making
themselves available to satisfy
any whim.
It seemed that just before I
would become aware that we
were running low on bread or
water, some member ol the stall
would realize this and bring us
more. Never once during our
dinner did we have to interrupt
our conversation for more than a
few seconds to get the attention
of our waiter.
The choice ol 10 entrees in
cludes filet of sole ($9.95). roast
ducking ($11.95). broiled lamb
(sll.9s)and roast pheasant (for
two — $16.50 per person).

We had the Special <lu Join
($10.95). chicken breast in .1
light wine sauce, and Medallion->
de Veau "I'oiinicrc ($13.95)'.
medallionsot seal covered with a
cream sauce ol sherry and mus
hrooms. I he chickcn was succu
lent and lightly seasoned. Ihe
veal was tender and the mus
hrooms blended well with it.
Wc had live desserts to choose
from, including Baked Alaska.
We settled on the chocolate
mousse ($1.95) and. Imm
among the house pastries, the
strawberry tart ($1.95) I lie tart
had just the right combination ol
sweetness and fresh strawberry
tanginess. The mousse was rich
but light. Both went well with the
expertly blended cot'tee.
l or the average impoverished
student, like me. this restaurant
necessarily falls 111 the "special
occasion" category. You have to
play on spending $25 per person
for dinner with all the trimmings
One last word: make sure you
have a reservation.

As we walked into this jewel of
downtown San Mateo, we were
met by the French accent ot
Roger Nicolas, owner and man
ager. The quiet elegance of the
establishment made itsell known
as we were escorted by our hos
tess to a table for two topped by a
single rose.
Looking around the room we
noticed that the small, cloth
covered tables were not sepa
rated by any partitions. The soft
brightness of the room was pro
vided by flickering candle-lamps
on each table.
Our room looked out on a ter
race and a Tudor-style building
across the street. There were two
smaller rooms tucked away
around corners.
Keeping with the refined yet
relaxed French countryside
motif of this eating house, the
waiters wore tuxedos sans jac
kets.
We began our meal with an
apertif, Dubonnet and Sherry.
No American restaurant this;
other cocktails are not served.
Next on the menu was the
choice of four hors d'oeuvres,
one of which was escargots. We
had the Mousse de Foie de
Canard (duck's liver pate —
$3.95 for two) which came with
radish and pickle. The sliced
Mousse was a good opener —
light and not too strong.
The bread served was, ap
propriately, sections of long, thin
French loaves.
From the extensive wine list
we choose the house chablis
from the Thorin winery which is
bottled especially for La
Fotiniere. It was refreshing and
complemented our meal well.
Our waiter next brought us the
soup du jour, which is included
with the price of each entree. Mr.
Nicolas happened to be passing
our table at this time and he
commented that our vegetable
soup was made entirely of fresh
vegetables. The soup had the
consistency of pea soup and the
vegetables were chopped no big

ger than the size of peas.
The salad, also included with
the entree, followed. It was but
ter lettuce well tossed in a lightK
seasoned oil and vinegar dres
sing.
The impeccable service of this
restaurant began to dawn on me
at about this point in our meal.
Members of the stall, and
Nicolas himself, periodically
sauntered through the restaurant
checking each table and making
themselves available to satisfy
any whim.
It seemed that just before I
would become aware that we
were running low on bread or
water, some member ol the stall
would realize this and bring us
more. Never once during our
dinner did we have to interrupt
our conversation for more than a
few seconds to get the attention
of our waiter.

cludes filet of sole ($9.95). roast
ducking ($11.95). broiled lamb
