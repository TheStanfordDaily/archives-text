Paying several hundred
dollars t or an economy round
trip plane ticket may seem to
he the most reasonable way to
go to I ranee, hut a much
more affordable first class
solution beckons from just
beyond the periphery of the
I arm. A small fragment of
France, probably dislodged
from somewhere in the Pari
sian seizieme, has wound up
on the third floor of the Palo
Alto Office Tower at the
corner of University Ave. and
Cowper. What is this trans
planted piece of Parisian ele
gance? C'est La Tour, an re
staurant francuis.
La Tour is r. ! just a re
staurant franca is, it is the re
-1 stanrant francuis in the area.
Through scrupulous attention
to all the details ol the great
French dining tradition, the
owners, waiters and chef, all
of whom were born, bred and
trained in France, have con
spired to produce a gourmet
experience that leaves you
wondering whether you just
stepped in oil ol University
Avenue or the Champs-
Elysees.
During the entire evening I
kept imagining that I saw le
President de la Repubfique
feasting at an adjacent table.
The atmosphere of La Tour
is ideally conducive to such
reveries. Sipping cocktails
from the top-shelf bar. the re
finement of the restaurant's
decor and appointments be
gins to erase memories of a
mundane existence. The
heady concoction ol alcohol.

elegance, soft lights and ex
quisite aromas convince you
that you are certainly an am
bassador or at worst a cabinet
minister.
Rust and gold dominate the
rich hues of the draperies and
wooden fluted columns and
panelling, which set the stylis
tic tone. Simple china, silver
ware and crystal, shimmering
with the light from the chan
deliers above, rest on sparkl
ing white tablecloths.
Alter a comfortable period
of time the tuxedo-clad wai
ter asks if you now desire to
see the menu. This question
highlights the second most
enjoyable aspect of La lour
next to the superb food: the
tempo of the evening is de
cided upon by the client.
It may be wisest, however,
to ask for the menu and wine
list soon after arriving, be
cause the variety of offerings
is so extensive that it may take
a good hour to decide what to
order. The menu, in French
with English subtitles, pre
sents the finest classical
French dishes ever created.
Over a do/en different
soups, salads, and hors
d'oeuvres tempt you. Choos
ing to follow a traditional
dinner format, we started
with hors d'oeuvres. Quenelle
de poiseon, facon La Tour, a
fresh fish mousse with lobster
sauce, and imported smoked
salmon finally prevailed after
much deliberation over a\-
ocat a la Russe, prepared with
sour cream and caviar, and
the escargots de Bourgogne.
It would have been difficult
to convince us that a better
choice could have been made
as we savored these delights

along with the delicate house
white wine. The salmon, pre
sented with a carved lemon,
capers and shallots, pleased
the eye as well as the palate.
The fish mousse was most
remarkable for its sauce,
which enticed me to cast
manners to the wind and cap
ture every last drop with :i
piece ol freshly-baked
baguette.
Although we did not order
soup, it was certainly not for
lack of an excellent selection.
Bisque de homard, prepared
with fresh Maine lobster
flown in several times a week,
headed a fine list that also in
cluded soupe a I'oignon,
crerneSenegcilaise andhorscht
passe.
A dry red wine best suited
our main dishes of tornedos
Peri sourdine and grenadin de
veau, Valle d'Auge, but which
one to pick from among the
approximately 100 different
wines offered at La Tour?
Spanish, German, Califor
nian and French wines of
every year and color at prices
ranging from $10 to $250
garnish the wine list. Our ever
patient and knowledgeable
waiter helped us settle upon a
Bordeaux.
Throughout the dinner our
waiter was most attentive and
interesting. The waiters at La
Tour walk a tight rope,
balancing formality and
meticulous etiquette on one
hand and relaxed hospitality
on the other, a job which they
perform with consummate
skill.
As we polished off the in
credibly tender filet mignon
smothered in perigourdine
sauce and veal loin flamed

with calvados brandy and
cream, we debated about
which entrees to sample dur
ing our next visit: Jllet de sole
Norma tide with white wine
sauce, muscles and shrimp,
cuisses de grenouilles prove
ncale, canard aux kumquats el
poivre vert or carre d'agneau
aux aromates
Panachee, the house salad,
and a fresh heart of artichoke
and shrimp combination fol
lowed the main course to
halaver I'estomac and clear
way for dessert of domestic
Brie and a sherbet, straw
berry and almond creation
called coupe maison. Judging
from the number that passed
by, thcsouffleau Grand Mar
nier must be the chefs most
popular dessert.
Coffee and liqueurs, en
joyed at your table or in the
comfort ol the richly up
holstered arm chairs by the
bar, add the proper final
touch of class to such an un
forgettable dinner. For those
not accustomed to spending
large sums of money for a
meal, a lew extra dinner
brandies are recommended:
the tab for two will range
from $50 to $100 depending
on the selection of wines.
La Tour is open Monday
through Saturday from 5:30

are strongly recommended.
And lastly, proper dress is re

sian seizieme, has wound up
on the third floor of the Palo
Alto Office Tower at the
corner of University Ave. and
Cowper. What is this trans
planted piece of Parisian ele
gance? C'est La Tour, an re
staurant francuis.
La Tour is r. ! just a re
staurant franca is, it is the re
-1 stanrant francuis in the area.
Through scrupulous attention
to all the details ol the great
French dining tradition, the
owners, waiters and chef, all
of whom were born, bred and
trained in France, have con
spired to produce a gourmet
experience that leaves you
wondering whether you just
stepped in oil ol University
Avenue or the Champs-
Elysees.
During the entire evening I
kept imagining that I saw le
President de la Repubfique
feasting at an adjacent table.
The atmosphere of La Tour
is ideally conducive to such
reveries. Sipping cocktails
from the top-shelf bar. the re
finement of the restaurant's
decor and appointments be
gins to erase memories of a
mundane existence. The
heady concoction ol alcohol.

elegance, soft lights and ex
quisite aromas convince you
that you are certainly an am
bassador or at worst a cabinet
minister.
Rust and gold dominate the
rich hues of the draperies and
wooden fluted columns and
panelling, which set the stylis
tic tone. Simple china, silver
ware and crystal, shimmering
with the light from the chan
deliers above, rest on sparkl
ing white tablecloths.
Alter a comfortable period
of time the tuxedo-clad wai
ter asks if you now desire to
see the menu. This question
highlights the second most
enjoyable aspect of La lour
next to the superb food: the
tempo of the evening is de
cided upon by the client.
It may be wisest, however,
to ask for the menu and wine
list soon after arriving, be
cause the variety of offerings
is so extensive that it may take
a good hour to decide what to
order. The menu, in French
with English subtitles, pre
sents the finest classical
French dishes ever created.
Over a do/en different
soups, salads, and hors
d'oeuvres tempt you. Choos
ing to follow a traditional
dinner format, we started
with hors d'oeuvres. Quenelle
de poiseon, facon La Tour, a
fresh fish mousse with lobster
sauce, and imported smoked
salmon finally prevailed after
much deliberation over a\-
ocat a la Russe, prepared with
sour cream and caviar, and
the escargots de Bourgogne.
It would have been difficult
to convince us that a better
choice could have been made
as we savored these delights

along with the delicate house
white wine. The salmon, pre
sented with a carved lemon,
capers and shallots, pleased
the eye as well as the palate.
The fish mousse was most
remarkable for its sauce,
which enticed me to cast
manners to the wind and cap
ture every last drop with :i
piece ol freshly-baked
baguette.
Although we did not order
soup, it was certainly not for
lack of an excellent selection.
Bisque de homard, prepared
with fresh Maine lobster
flown in several times a week,
headed a fine list that also in
cluded soupe a I'oignon,
crerneSenegcilaise andhorscht
passe.
A dry red wine best suited
our main dishes of tornedos
Peri sourdine and grenadin de
veau, Valle d'Auge, but which
one to pick from among the
approximately 100 different
wines offered at La Tour?
Spanish, German, Califor
nian and French wines of
every year and color at prices
ranging from $10 to $250
garnish the wine list. Our ever
patient and knowledgeable
waiter helped us settle upon a
Bordeaux.
Throughout the dinner our
waiter was most attentive and
interesting. The waiters at La
Tour walk a tight rope,
balancing formality and
meticulous etiquette on one
hand and relaxed hospitality
on the other, a job which they
perform with consummate
skill.
As we polished off the in
credibly tender filet mignon
smothered in perigourdine
sauce and veal loin flamed

with calvados brandy and
cream, we debated about
which entrees to sample dur
ing our next visit: Jllet de sole
Norma tide with white wine
sauce, muscles and shrimp,
cuisses de grenouilles prove
ncale, canard aux kumquats el
poivre vert or carre d'agneau
aux aromates
Panachee, the house salad,
and a fresh heart of artichoke
and shrimp combination fol
lowed the main course to
halaver I'estomac and clear
way for dessert of domestic
Brie and a sherbet, straw
berry and almond creation
called coupe maison. Judging
from the number that passed
by, thcsouffleau Grand Mar
nier must be the chefs most
popular dessert.
Coffee and liqueurs, en
joyed at your table or in the
comfort ol the richly up
holstered arm chairs by the
bar, add the proper final
touch of class to such an un
forgettable dinner. For those
not accustomed to spending
large sums of money for a
meal, a lew extra dinner
brandies are recommended:
the tab for two will range
from $50 to $100 depending
on the selection of wines.
La Tour is open Monday
through Saturday from 5:30
to 10 p.m. and while reserva
tions are not required they
are strongly recommended.
And lastly, proper dress is re
quested. After all. you never
know when you will run into
the President of the Republic
at La Tour, restaurant fran
