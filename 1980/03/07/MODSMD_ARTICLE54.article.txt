Pear Williams
150 Middlefield Kd.

A pleasant surprise awaits dis
covery tucked away from the
hustle of the downtown area.
The surprise — Pear Williams, a
delightful country French re
staurant offering the traditional
excellent I rench cuisine without
the traditional stuffiness of an
Americanized-French restaur
ant.
One enters the restaurant and
encounters a warm and cozy
low-ceilinged room, tastefully
decorated with Aubrey
Beardsley prints, hand-made
wooden designs, plants and fresh
flowers on e\ cry table. The room
is dimly-lit with tables spaced
carefully so as not to be too close
together, and along one wall are
unusual booths which give a \ iew
'of the small room but allow the
patrons an intimate, separated
area in which to dine. Relaxed
and intimate, the atmosphere
creates a casual feeling, though
the patrons lend a more formal
appearance — no jeans, but ties
are not required either.
Soaking in the atmosphere
with an apertif of Robert Lamb
Johannesberg Reisling 1978, we
studied the menu. Putt pastry is a
specialty of the chet and a
number of the dishes were
created around this unusual deli
cacy.
Included with the entree are
soup, salad and a delightful bas
ket of fresh sour-dough bread.
Beginning our meal, we de
cided to sample the hots
d'oeuvres. choosing escargots au
beurre de maison (53.50) rather
than celery hearts with blue and
cream cheese (52.25) or saute ot
mushrooms with Madeira
($2.50). The escargot were

served in a creamy garlic and
butter sauce but. slightly out-of
the-ordinary. they were not
served in a shell.
Next came what could be con
sidered the highlight of the meal
(though the entrees were delici
ous) — clear spinach soup.
Chopped leaves of spinach
floated in a clear broth delicately
made with an exquisite combina
tion of herbal seasoning.
Then the plain, green salad ot
iceberg lettuce was served with a
flavorful oil dressing and was
topped with walnut shavings. On
par for a French meal.
At last the entree was pre
sented. much to our delight. We
chose the special (red snapper)
for $7.95 and brochetie de
coquilles Saint-Jacques Mornay
($9.95). Both were served with a
baked tomato topped with
breadcrumbs (very well pre
pared). rice and an unusual veg
etable concoction of brocolli and
rice — the brocolli. true to
French fashion, was not over
cooked.
The snapper was prepared
with green onions and mus
hrooms. and wonderfully sea
soned with "Turtle herbs."
which are used in the prepara
tion of turtle soup. Tender and
virtually boneless, it was a verv
good choice.
The brochetie de coquilles are
very large, tender scallops
skewer-cooked with mushrooms
in a cheese sauce, lemon butter
and finished with a coating of
bread crumbs. This is a rich but
delicate choice for seafood lov
ers.
Other entree choices in
cluded: filet de sole Sormande
($8.95) a specialty of the chef
which includes the previously
mentioned puff pastry encasing
sole tillets nd sauteed apples and
is covered with an "apple

sauce"; tournedo grille maison
($12.75); supreme de volleille St.
Cloud ($9.25); and also offered,
if ordered 24 hours in advance
(lor two) is the supreme de vol
atile clief T.J. ($25). a dish of
deboned chicken breasts mari
nated in port wine and brandy
and served in a puff pastry with
mushroom stuffing and Swiss
cheese.
I'he final course, and a perfect
complement to a great French
meal, is the other unique house
specialty, dessert. True to the
name Pear Williams, the two
outstanding desserts feature
poached pears: The Pear Wil
liam (sl.f»s), served on a bed of
ice cream with a carmel sauce,
and our favorite, h'euilletage ties
poires ($3.25). serv ed in a puffed
pastry casing with French cus
tard creme and whipped cream.
Allow 20 minutes for this deli
cacy — it's worth the wait. Also
offered are the standard cheese
cake and Bud's ice cream.
Complementing our meals we
had a 197S Mirassou white hur
gu ndy.
Pear Williams was created
four years ago to serve as a re
staurant lor businessmen in the
area. Two years ago. ownership
became a cooperative effort be
tween a number of families in the
area. Since then its reputation
has spread and its clientele has
grown. The table cloths were
hand-made by Mary Cox. one ol
the original owners, and all the
wood decorations were made by
woodworkers in the Palo Alto
area.
For a night out that is not out
rageously expensive but offers
charm, intimacy and excellent
French cuisine, try Pear Wil
liams.
