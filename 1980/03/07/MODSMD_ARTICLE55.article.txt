The American version of a
French restaurant can often
be stereotyped in certain
specific ways. Of course, this
begins with the cuisine, but
also includes the decor (usu
ally an attempt at elegance)
and service (haughty, it not
intimidating) — not to men
tion cost (expensi\ e). And yet
despite all of this, we return
because of the special ambi
ence. the special character
that French dining offers.
Now however, the Peninsu
la's opportunities for French
cuisine include not only the
likes of L'Auberge and La
Tour, but also a recent addi
tion, Alouette. This new re
staurant offers a different but
equally legitimate style of
French dining.
Alouette is modeled after
the sort of restaurant found in
the countryside of Brittany
calling itself "La Potiniere."
Although not actually a
"place for gossip," it is easy to
imagine an informal gather
ing of good friends enjoying
fine wine, excellent food and
each other. And so it is with
Alouette.
Upon entering we were
greeted immediately by the
owner, who prefers to use her
first name, Sophie. She seated
us at one of the dozen tables,
each of which is covered with a
brown-checked tablecloth
and a kerosene lamp.
As we listened to the classi
cal music in the background, a
look around was rewarded

with numerous items that de
veloped the provincial setting.
When presented with the
menu, we had a difficult time
selecting from the seven ex
cellent entrees. All are served
with French bread, soup,
salad and vegetables, and cost
between $9.50 and $11.
Among the choices are le
Coq an Vin, Le Lupin a hi
Mouturde and l.e Saute d'Ag
neau Provencale.
Having chosen the Coq an
Vin and one of the specials.
Filet an Poivre, we began our
dinner with a special treat, es
cargot cooked in white wine.
The serving of six escargot
was indicative of things to
come. The carefully spiced
mixture of butter and wine
complemented the flavors
well and the appetizer was
thus declared a success.
The next courses were the
green salad with oil and vin
egar dressing, accompanied
by a never empty basket of
French bread and butter, and
the soup. A creamy blend of
fresh vegetables, this was
another success — delicate
and yet full-flavored.
All of this was but a prelude
to what followed. The dinners
were both well presented and
delicious. My filet an Poivre
was an extremely tender filet
smothered in the nicely sea
soned sauce which gives this
combination it's appeal — it
was definitely spicy yet did
not overwhelm the flavor of
the beef. The vegetables, car
rots and rice, were also nicely
prepared and. happily, not
overcooked.
My companion's Coq an
Vin was also superb. The ten

dcr young chicken is braised,
flambeed in cognac and then
simmered in burgundy wine.
Fhc result is excellent. The
chicken was cooked just to
the point of completeness
without being dried out, and
the flavorful gravy added ex
citement.
It should also be pointed
out that in both cases the serv
ings are extremely generous,
even for the hearty appetite.
Our one less than satisfying
choice of the evening was the
wine. A 1977 Muscadet, it
was very good by itself. I low
ever, this dry white wine from
the Loire Valley didn't begin
to stand up to either dish — a
classic case of blindly match
ing poultry with white wine
(for which I must take credit).
Instead, I would recom
mend a fairly hearty red wine
with both dishes. In fact, an
intriguing possibility, particu
larly with the steak, would be
one of California's many ex
cellent 1976 zinfandels.
We finished our meal with
dessert selections. I had the
mousse (in chocolai which was
extremely chocolaty and not
overly sweet — perfect for my
taste. The crowning glory,
however, was Le Vucherin
Glace ordered by my compan
ion. This light dessert was a
serving of ice cream on a pil
low of meringue and covered
with almond flavored whip
ped cream and chocolate
sauce, a perfect end to the
meal.
As we lingered over coffee.
Sophie offered us a glass of
Sauterne. and filled us in on
the origins of Alouette. She
told us of finally satisfying a

long-term dream to own Iter
own restaurant only .1 couple
ot months ago. Sophie was
born in France. She has
worked at several ol the Hay
area's finer restaurants.
She and her partner. Matt,
have taken an original ap
proach. From the atmos
phere, which is most accu
rately called comfortable, to
the vegetables, which are al
ways fresh, and the service,
which is excellent. Malt and
Sophie offer a line dining ex
perience. Their attention to
detail and personal involve
ment assure this.
F.v en the wine list is unique
in its own way. Although not
yet particularly impressive, it
is adequate, and several ol the
liner wines are offered on a
by-the-glass basis a pleas
ant alternative to house jun
wines. And if the wine selec
tion is not sufficient, or you
have your own special bottle,
the corkage tee is a very
reasonable $2.50.
I hroughout our evening at
Alouette. we were impressed
with many aspects of the re
staurant. The only really out
standing characteristic, how
ever. was the comfortable
atmosphere that prevailed
We decided that Alouette
may just be the perfect place
for that special reunion or
quiet farewell, particularlv
with a group ol three to siv
So. when your friends re
turn from Paris or I ours, or
before you leave, visit Matt
and Sophie, and let them pro
vide you with their personal
example of what dining out
should really be. Hon appeal'
