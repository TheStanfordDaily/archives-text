The Seduction of Mi mi
Friday, kresjje 7:30 & 9:30 p.m.
Giancarlo Giannini plays Mimi,
a victim of bruised male ego who
reacts to his wife's commission of
adultery by vowing to have sex with
her lover's wife. This is one of di
rector Lina Wertmuller's best ef
forts Here she juggles comedy and
pathos with an expert touch, with
little of the stridency that some
times mars her other satires. A very
funny, ultimately moving film.
— Jim Mattson
Chapter Two
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, they marry, they have
problems, they resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one
liners and even a moment here or
there that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-good self.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles but the movie's worth
a free night (if any of us ever had
one). A good one for Mom and
Dad.

Rock'n' Roll High School ★★★★
Old Mill,
weekend midnight special
American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. Rock 'n' Roll High
School is a must-see movie about
the energies of high school revolu
tion. This sleazy little musical brims
with vitality. verve and the heavy
backbeat of the Ramones. A
grade-Z version of Grease but far
more exciting.
— Dana Polan
Cruising *
Aquarius 1 win, Palo Alto
Writer-director William Fried
kin has always dealt in cheap thrills,
but he's never made a movie as
ugly, discordant, sloppily made,
poorly thought-out and morally
bankrupt as this one. Depending
on your mood, Friedkin's depiction
of homosexual life is akin to either
how blacks were treated on slave
ships or Milton's description of
hell. It's an utterly insensitive por
trait of a world Friedkin doesn't
even attempt to understand. And
Friedkin's idea of what constitutes
goodness — that is, a heterosexual
relationship — is so stupidly and
sketchilv presented that even it is
lifeless. Most pornographically vio
lent movies (for example, Midnight
Express) develop a relentless in
evitability that some people re
spond to; but Cruising is so badly
paced and ineffectually acted (by
A! Pacino, among others) that sit
ting in front of a rock for two hours
will probably evoke a more positive
emotional response.

Tonight, New Varsity
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Next) works in a reckless,
giddy fashion; he perfectly cap
tures the timeless, rock 'n' roll, re
bellious spirit of the '60s and makes
it live again. It's a fantasy vision of
America, but even in those terms,
Hair just might be the truest pic
ture of the '60s ever made. With
John Savage, Beverly D'Angelo
and Treat Williams.
— R.L.
I'hantom of the Paradise ★★★
Tonight, New Varsity
Director Brian De Palma's
movie is an entertaining mess that
seems likely to self-destruct at any
time. At first glance, this movie is
an extremely broad parody of The
Phantom of the Opera; with your
next glance it's a parody of the
whole music business; before long,
it turns into a big parody of itself.
De Palma's humor and style
triumph throughout. Starring Paul
Williams.
— R.L.
Young Frankenstein
Thursday, Bishop 7:30 p.m.
Mel Brooks really needs Gene
Wilder (and vice versa) and this
movie makes that obvious. Wilder
' wrote much of the screenplay, and
his performance as Doctor Fran
kenstein begins to remind you of
Buster Keaton. Brooks comes
close to what can be termed "good
direction," and his use of black
and-white photography is particu
larly inspired. Marty Feldman pro
vides the perfect comic foil as Igor,
the hunchbacked servant.
— R.L.
The Maltese Falcon
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
You ve probably never heard of
this movie, but you shouldn't let
that stop you from seeing it. The
unknown Humphrey Bogart's
characterization of detective Sam
Spade takes Dashiell Hammett's
original conception to the limit —
he's tough, cynical and perhaps
more than a little big crazy. Bogart
is joined by some other people
you've never heard of named As
tor, Lorre and Greenstreet.
Directed by the obscure John Hus
ton.
—R.L.
Apocalypse Now ****
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employs Conrad's es
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images of
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor.

sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It's a journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is. I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming cra/iness
of this 'impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.
— R.L.
.4 Clockwork Orange
Thursday, New Varsity
Stanley Kubrick transfarred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual
movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near future;
the issue at stake is whether indi-

viduality is more important than
the society that must deal with the
individual. Malcolm McDowell
stars as a man whose joy comes
mainly from committing acts of vio
lence; he is arrested and forced to
undergo "treatment" to make him
safe for society. Kubrick gives no
easy answers to the questions in
this singularly disturbing film.

Saturn 3
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read
"something is wrong on Saturn 3."
They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion of
Demon Seed, but the result is two
boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis

tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter
tainment here, folks. Unless watch
ing animals being crushed and
people being dismembered is your
type of trip, plan a vacation some
where else.
— Mike Charlson
Going in Style,ft**
Belmont 3, Belmont
A very touching little movie. It's
been criticized for its slow pacing
and lack of ribald comedy, but
that's largely unjustified George
Burns, Art Carney and Lee Stras
berg are a compelling trio to watch,
and in his feature movie debut,
28-year-old writer-director Martin
Brest makes up for his lack of plot
ideas with a compassionate and
gentle touch. Much of the movie's
comedy is contained in the opening
sequences, where the elderly trio
rob a bank; alter that, the movie is
moody, emotionally wrenching.

Well worth seeing, if only to watch
actors who don't need to trample
you to be effective.
— R.L.
Animal House
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9:15 p.m.
A slightly crazed, generally
sophomoric and mindless movie
which serves as one big glorifica
tion of white male fantasies. And
because of this, this story of various
forms of frat life in '62 works;
Animal House's approach fits its
subject matter very well.
As always, John Belushi gives an
inspired performance as one of the
"animals" in the "worst frat on
campus.'" I am ne\ er quite sure just
what drives Belushi. but whatever
it is, it must he good stuff.
John Landis directs as if there's
no speed but fast and no volume

but loud, and while that doesn't
hurt him too much here (although
because of this tendency Animal
House has a decidedly limited emo
tional range), I wonder if Landis
can do anything else but movies
like this. Actually, I wouldn't mind
more movies like this one; a little
frenzy never hurt anyone, did it?

Persona i*★★★
Monday, Cubberley
Ingmar Bergman's extraordinar
ily complex examination of
schizophrenia repays viewing be
cause of (among other things) the
power of its images and its haunting
performances. The work of Liv
Ullmann and Bibi Andersson gives
the movie its deceptive simplicity.
Bernardo Bertolucci's The Con
formist is the first half of Monday's
double bill and will screen at 7 p.m.

American Gigolo ★
Bijou, Palo Alio
Richard Geto lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that lie doesn't have
much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience feel more like
peeping toms than vital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstonc preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better ot him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end

ing, Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush of images,
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Hutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love. — R.L.
1941
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion'for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
I hat may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, frenzied comic action may be
horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
I here isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Ay krovd. Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
| Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe"' Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
| ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— .R.L.
The Rose ★
Old Mill
It would be easy to get worked
up over this movie, but why
bother? Really just another version
|of A Star is Born, except that this
one is clothed with a 1469 setting
land centered on a character vag
| uely based on Janis Joplin. But the
| movie makes only three references
to '69, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin'sform of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less-than-convincing
in the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates. Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.
— R.L.
Breaking Anav ★ ★★
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his talent
on a bicycle. Nominated for a Best
Picture Oscar.
— Mike K.ohn
Kramer vs. Kramer
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's

movie is tor the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Trutlaut
-1 ike character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care lor
his son (and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end ot the film.
After all the care and honesty Bcn
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead ot, taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity Jane Alexander co
stars, and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Harold and Maude * # ★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals are played by Bud Cort
and Ruth Gordon. — JM
Electric Horseman *★*
Palo Alto Square
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal tor a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a SI 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redlord
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course. Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially.
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and. despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
