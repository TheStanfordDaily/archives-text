Pakistan denies aiding Afghanis
ISI \\l \B \D. Pakistan Pakistan's president
said vesterday he would allow inspection ot border
refugee camps to show that Alghan rebels are not
being trained and armed there, and he suggested
posting an international peacekeeping force in .Af
ghanistan as a means ot ending the crisis there.
President Gen. Mohammad /.ia ul-Haq, addres
sing the country's elected representatives, said Af
ghanistan could seal its border with Pakistan to satisfy
itself that no arms or rebels are being sent from
Pakistan. The Soviet I nion moved thousands of
troops into \fghanistan to hack a government coup
in December and as many as 90.000 remain, helping
the Afghan army fight Moslem rebels
/.ia described as "totally baseless" charges that
Pakistan has been providing military training and
arms to tehels and said he would permit inspection ot
the camps in Pakistan by an international body "any
time it wants" to prove that only humanitarian relief
is being provided.
Pakistan rejected an oflet ot $400 million in I S.
aid intended to strengthen its defenses against any
Russian threat. It said it would depend upon its own
"unitv and strength" and the "time-tested friend
ship" ot China.

Br/ezinski said Pakistan's rejection of the aid "suits
us |iisi fine." He said yesterday that he thought Pakis
tan was right in feeling its security interests were not
best served bv a highly visible detense relationship
with the I nited States.
In Washington, the State Department said Soviet
forces appear to be making preparations to remain in
\tghanistan indefinitely. I hey have established a
ommand structure, are digging wells, laying cables
and preparing to construct living quarters, spokes
man Nodding Carter said.
