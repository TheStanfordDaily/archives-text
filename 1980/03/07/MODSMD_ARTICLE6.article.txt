The University is helping Storey
I louse residents find housing and work
out their other problems, said Univer
sity President Richard Lyman on
K/.SI J'sCampus ((inference last night.
The University is "quite conscious of
fire danger," Lyman said. He added

that something must be done to stop
people from "borrowing" fire extin
guishers or using them in pranks.
He also discussed the qualities his
successor will need. Lyman resigned
Jan. 26 to head the prestigious Roc
kefeller Foundation in New York.
Two traits that a university president
needs now. which Lyman feels were
not needed 40 years ago, are "a concern
with management organization and the
ability to cope with government at all
levels; to know what makes things hap
pen and how to stop things from hap
pening."
He also noted that, as in the past, a
university president should be articu
late and show "clarity of judgment."
I yman speculated on Stanford's role
in the 'NOs and the effect of rising tui
tion: "Universities, especially well
established ones, change only very
slowly. They cannot be made to turn on
a dime . . . somebody said not even on a
silver dollar." Therefore, he expects
Stanford to remain a major research
university, and to remain private.
He said that if Jarvis 11. the tax
cutting initiative which he does not
support, passes, the tuition at UC-
Berkeley will be forced to rise. Thus

the gap in the difference between C'al
and Stanford tuitions will narrow.
Carter 'overreacted'
Commenting on international issues.
Lyman stated that the Soviets' move
into Afghanistan "was not the most
serious thrust the Soviets could make.
"It was hard to see what they could
gain." Lyman said he thinks that Presi
dent Jimmy Carter overreacted and
idmonished that "the two superpowers
have to live together."
Lyman said he is "ambivalent"
about the U.S. withdrawal from the
Olympic games. I le noted, "It was one
of the few things we could do that was
non-militaristic," and he feels that the
Soviet government will not be able to
"explain away" our absence to their
people.
He realizes that it is a "serious blow
to the Olympic games." and a terrible
disappointment to the athletes that
have been training for years. He added
that it might be a little comforting for
the athletes to realize that "their ap
pearance is so significant that their dis
appearance is equally significant."
Lyman was one of six university pres
idents to send a cable to Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Bre/hnev concerning the
exile of Soviet dissident scientist An

drei Sakharo\ . He remarked that the
Soviet government lias improved a lit
tle since Josef Stalin's time, since
Sakharov did not disappear altogether.
He commented further that it is "sad
that in today's world scholars are not
free to travel and share their ideas with
one another." Sakharov had been
asked to lecture at Stanford before he
was sent to (iorky
