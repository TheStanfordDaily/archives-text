## Israelis denounce UN vote 
### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
JERUSALEM — Israel'spar
liament yesterday denounced
the United Nations Security
Council resolution against
Jewish settlement in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip and explicitly condemned
the United States' support of the
measure in spite of President
Jimmy Carter's assurances that it
was unintended.
The Knesset (parliament)
voted along party lines on two
resolutions condemning the
U.N. action, one offered by the
ruling rightist Likud government
and the other by the opposition
Labor alignment. The govern
ment motion, which reaffirmed
in strong terms Israel's right to
settle anywhere in the occupied
territories, was adopted by a vote
of 52 to 37. The opposition par
ties voted for their own, almost
identical resolution. -
Despite apparent efforts by
Washington to close the books
on the Security Council affair.
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin termed as "barbaric fan
tasy" the U.N. call for disman
tlement of Jewish ..ousing in
East Jerusalem, which was an
nexed by Israel after the 1967
six-day war.
"Let all the members of the
Security Council record that
Jerusalem is one city, all of it
under Israeli sovereignty, our et
ernal capital. There will be no
partition, directly or indirectly."
Begin told the Knesset.
Referring to Carter's explana
tion that U.S. approval of the re
solution occurred because of a
breakdown of communications.
Begin said. "It goes without say
ing that we accept what the pres
ident of the United States says
word for word and with all due
respect.
Other paragraphs?
"But. I must ask frankly, was
that mistake in reference to one

line and one paragraph in the re
solution which is hostile to Israel
and contradicts the Camp David
agreements? . . . What about the
other paragraphs which mention
Jerusalem, which also contradict
the Camp David agreements?"
Begin asked.
"Had that paragraph, that one
line, not been included, would
there have been justification for
a vote in support of that resolu
tion which is an absolutely re
pugnant one?" Begin asked.
Of the U.N. resolution as a
whole. Begin declared, "under
no conditions shall we accept it,
or any part, sentence or parag
raph of it. It is not binding upon
us. ..
Vituperation
In spite of the vituperation in
the Knesset debate against the
U.N. action. Israeli officials were
quietly turning their attention to
what they regard a potentially
more threatening development
— the increasing number of
European nations that are
openly calling for Palestinian
self-determination.
France, West Germany. Bri
tain, Ireland and Belgium have
recently expressed support of
Palestinian independence, and
Israeli ambassadors in Europe
have been instructed to impress
upon their host governments Is
rael's concern that such state
ments undermine the Camp
David peace agreements.
"This worries us a great deal,
since Palestinian self
determination means nothing
else than a Palestinian state, and
we regard a Palestinian state as a
mortal danger to Israel," a
Foreign Ministry official said
Thursday. He said he believed
the European swing toward
"crossing the line" was con
nected to recent moves by Great
Britain to amend U.N. Security
Council Resolution 242 to in
clude the notion of Palestinian
independence.

Resolution 242 calls for Israeli
withdrawal from "occupied ter
ritories" but does not mention
self-determination for Palesti
nian Arabs of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
Protest
Israel formally protested to
France Wednesday over Presi
dent Valery Giscard d'Estaing's
call during a visit to Kuwait for
Palestinian self-determination.
The protest was handed to the
French ambassador here.
Begin referred to Giscard's
statement in his Knesset speech
yesterday, saying that in the
1930s "that satan" (Adolf Hi
tler) spoke of the right of self
determination for the Germans
in the Sudetenland. This, Begin
said, led to the "notorious"
Munich agreement.
"I think we have a perfect
analogy here. Certain countries
in Europe are trying to court
favor with a strong and extor
tionist aggressor at the expense
of a small nation. Therefore,
they use the term 'self
determination,' while totally
corrupting its meaning," Begin
said.
Soviet attack
The Soviet Union joined the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and other Arab groups on
Wednesday in attacking the Car
ter administration's reversal on a
U.N. resolution condemning Is
raeli settlements in occupied
Arab lands.
In Washington, spokesman
Hodding Carter acknowledged
the State Department had re
ceived numerous protests, espe
cially from Arab nations, follow
ing the U.S. declaration Monday
that it erred in voting for a Sec
urity Council resolution con
demning Israeli settlements.
"We've heard from a number
of countries. There has been a
reaction that could have been
more favorable," spokesman
Carter said without elaboration.

Security Council record that
Jerusalem is one city, all of it
under Israeli sovereignty, our et
ernal capital. There will be no
partition, directly or indirectly."
Begin told the Knesset.
Referring to Carter's explana
tion that U.S. approval of the re
solution occurred because of a
breakdown of communications.
Begin said. "It goes without say
ing that we accept what the pres
ident of the United States says
word for word and with all due
respect.
Other paragraphs?
"But. I must ask frankly, was
that mistake in reference to one

line and one paragraph in the re
solution which is hostile to Israel
and contradicts the Camp David
agreements? . . . What about the
other paragraphs which mention
Jerusalem, which also contradict
the Camp David agreements?"
Begin asked.
"Had that paragraph, that one
line, not been included, would
there have been justification for
a vote in support of that resolu
tion which is an absolutely re
pugnant one?" Begin asked.
Of the U.N. resolution as a
whole. Begin declared, "under
no conditions shall we accept it,
or any part, sentence or parag
raph of it. It is not binding upon
us. ..
Vituperation
In spite of the vituperation in
the Knesset debate against the
U.N. action. Israeli officials were
quietly turning their attention to
what they regard a potentially
more threatening development
— the increasing number of
European nations that are
openly calling for Palestinian
self-determination.
France, West Germany. Bri
tain, Ireland and Belgium have
recently expressed support of
Palestinian independence, and
Israeli ambassadors in Europe
have been instructed to impress
upon their host governments Is
rael's concern that such state
ments undermine the Camp
David peace agreements.
"This worries us a great deal,
since Palestinian self
determination means nothing
else than a Palestinian state, and
we regard a Palestinian state as a
mortal danger to Israel," a
Foreign Ministry official said
Thursday. He said he believed
the European swing toward
"crossing the line" was con
nected to recent moves by Great
Britain to amend U.N. Security
Council Resolution 242 to in
clude the notion of Palestinian
independence.

Resolution 242 calls for Israeli
withdrawal from "occupied ter
ritories" but does not mention
self-determination for Palesti
nian Arabs of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
Protest
Israel formally protested to
France Wednesday over Presi
dent Valery Giscard d'Estaing's
call during a visit to Kuwait for
Palestinian self-determination.
The protest was handed to the
French ambassador here.
Begin referred to Giscard's
statement in his Knesset speech
yesterday, saying that in the
1930s "that satan" (Adolf Hi
tler) spoke of the right of self
determination for the Germans
in the Sudetenland. This, Begin
said, led to the "notorious"
Munich agreement.
"I think we have a perfect
analogy here. Certain countries
in Europe are trying to court
favor with a strong and extor
tionist aggressor at the expense
of a small nation. Therefore,
they use the term 'self
determination,' while totally
corrupting its meaning," Begin
said.
Soviet attack
The Soviet Union joined the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion and other Arab groups on
Wednesday in attacking the Car
ter administration's reversal on a
U.N. resolution condemning Is
raeli settlements in occupied
Arab lands.
In Washington, spokesman
Hodding Carter acknowledged
the State Department had re
ceived numerous protests, espe
cially from Arab nations, follow
ing the U.S. declaration Monday
that it erred in voting for a Sec
urity Council resolution con
demning Israeli settlements.
"We've heard from a number
of countries. There has been a
reaction that could have been
more favorable," spokesman
Carter said without elaboration.
JERUSALEM — Israel'spar
liament yesterday denounced
the United Nations Security
Council resolution against
Jewish settlement in the oc
cupied West Bank and Gaza
Strip and explicitly condemned
the United States' support of the
measure in spite of President
Jimmy Carter's assurances that it
was unintended.
The Knesset (parliament)
voted along party lines on two
resolutions condemning the
U.N. action, one offered by the
ruling rightist Likud government
and the other by the opposition
Labor alignment. The govern
ment motion, which reaffirmed
in strong terms Israel's right to
settle anywhere in the occupied
territories, was adopted by a vote
of 52 to 37. The opposition par
ties voted for their own, almost
identical resolution. -
Despite apparent efforts by
Washington to close the books
on the Security Council affair.
Prime Minister Menachem
Begin termed as "barbaric fan
tasy" the U.N. call for disman
tlement of Jewish ..ousing in
East Jerusalem, which was an
nexed by Israel after the 1967
six-day war.
