If Jesus Christ has real meaning in
your life as a Catholic, the reason
has to be that you are able to hear
his voice deep within you.
What is he saying to you about
your role as His minister to the men,
women and children of tomorrow's
world?
He does need priests, deacons,
brothers, sisters, lay people.
Would you like to talk about all
this? We invite you to write and let
us tell you how we feel about you
and your God-given vocation.
