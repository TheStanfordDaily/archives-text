One clinical psychologist tells the story of a
mother who consulted him for help in reducing
the indiscriminate swearing of her two young
sons. 'First, the therapist said, "it is important
that you use immediate and severe punish
ment each and every time the swearing be
havior occurs Second, you can maximize the
punishments impact by making sure both kids
are around whenever one is punished. The
second kid will learn from the example.
The next morning at breakfast with her two
sons, the mother waited for her chance The
older son opened tne day with the request that
she pass the fucking Cheerios With lighten
ing fury, the mother lunged across the table, hit
her son, and sent both him and two chairs
sprawling to the floor The younger son helped
her replace the furniture and they sat back
down Pleased with her actions, she turned to
her second breakfast partner and said, Well,
what will you have 7 "With ample indication that
he had learned from the preceding slaughter,
he sagely remarked, You can bet your sweet

One clinical psychologist tells the story of a
mother who consulted him for help in reducing
the indiscriminate swearing of her two young
sons. 'First, the therapist said, "it is important
that you use immediate and severe punish
ment each and every time the swearing be
havior occurs Second, you can maximize the
punishments impact by making sure both kids
are around whenever one is punished. The
second kid will learn from the example.
The next morning at breakfast with her two
sons, the mother waited for her chance The
older son opened tne day with the request that
she pass the fucking Cheerios With lighten
ing fury, the mother lunged across the table, hit
her son, and sent both him and two chairs
sprawling to the floor The younger son helped
her replace the furniture and they sat back
down Pleased with her actions, she turned to
her second breakfast partner and said, Well,
what will you have 7 "With ample indication that
he had learned from the preceding slaughter,
he sagely remarked, You can bet your sweet
ass it isn't Cheerios!
