# Carter, Reagan move ahead in Southern primaries
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter and Repub
lican Ronald Reagan marched through
Georgia, Florida and Alabama last
night, burying their White I louse i i\ als
m a three-state set of Southern presi
dential primary elections.
Carter won his home Georgia
Democratic primary by a towering
margin, polling I 1 votes tor every bal
lot cast for Sen. Edward Kennedy.
His Alabama margin was almost as
lopsided, and in Florida he was reaping
two-thirds of the vote while Kennedy
captured only 16 percent.
'National candidate'
Carter telephoned his supporters in
Birmingham, Ala., and said the results
show "it's not feasible to be elected
unless you're a national candidate."
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell put it more pointedly, saying
Kennedy can't win the presidency be
cause a Democratic nominee needs the
South.

Kennedy's deputy campaign man
ager. Patrick Lucey. said the challenger
got about what he expected in Carter
country.
"We have not been wiped out," he
said, forecasting that economic woes
will ultimately turn the tide against
Carter.
Conservative Reagan was the runa
way victor over former United Nations
Ambassador George Bush in all three
states. Florida was the closest thing to a
contest: there it was Reagan 56 per
cent. Bush 31.
The former California governor said
Ins Florida victory exceeded his fondest
hope. "1 didn't dare let myself hope for
it." lie said in a telephoned talk to sup
porters in Tampa.
Herb Harmon, the Reagan cam
paign manager in Florida, said yester
day's outcomes show that it will be dif
ficult for anyone, including former
President Gerald Ford, "to effectively
compete and play catch up."

Bush had said he hoped for a re
spectable second place in Southern
country he had all but conceded to
Reagan. His campaign manager. James
Baker, said, "We were not as pleased
with our results as we might have
been. But he added to that under
statement a vow that Bush will com
pete all the way to the GOP conven
tion.
Baker said the Morida returns in par
ticular had lowered Bush's expecta
tions in the primary just ahead in Il
linois. Baker said he now hopes for "a
respectable third-place showing'"
there. In fact, that would be a major
blow to Bush in a primary lie has called
crucial.
Kennedy didn't even campaign and
the outcomes were no surprise, but the
margins were. Carter's Georgia victory
eclipsed Kennedy's home-state
triumph in Massachusetts one week
ago. The Democratic challenger gained
65 percent of the vote there.

1 he C arter campaign victory party in
Orlando, Ma., was a subdued celebra
tion of the expected —except when the
place was evacuated because of a bomb
threat.
Carter hack in command
The Southern victories put Carter
back in command in the race for
Democratic nominating delegates. He
was gaining 179. to run his national
total to 266. Kennedy led lor 2K in
yesterday's primaries, which would put
his overall delegate strength at 143.
It will take 1666 to select a Democ
ratic presidential nominee.
In Republican competition, Reagan
was gaining 105 delegates yesterday.
Bush only 9. That would give the
former California governor 167 of the
99.X lie needs to win the nomination.
Flie Bush total stood at 45.
Rep. John Anderson, the liberal
from Illinois, skipped the South, saying
he would try for support there after
proving his credentials in more friendly

territory. He was gaining 7 percent ol
the vote in Florida and Georgia, and
wasn't on the ballot in Alabama.
Kennedy all but bypassed the South,
too, conceding the three contests to
Carter in advance, and staging only a
low-key effort to win black and Jewish
votes in Florida.

This is the last Daily of the quar
ter. We'll see you again on
Monday, March 31.

Fate in the Florida campaign, when
it became apparent that the president's
"acknowledged" mistake on the Un
ited Nations resolution concerning Is
rael had stirred a storm among Jewish
v oters, Kennedy cut a radio commer
cial and distributed 250.000 flyers on
that issue.
But Carter had the support ol most
Jewish and black leaders as well as the
Democratic hierarchy in I lorida and

the other two states. I lorida (io\. Bob
Graham, C ieorgia Go\. George Bus
bee, and lormcr Alabama (io\. George
Wallace, all endorsed the president, as,
did do/ens o! local officials.
Hie outcome in the three states luid
never been in doubt, although in Oc
tober. just belore Kennedy's formal
announcement, a group ot Norida vol
unteers waged a campaign on his he hull
that lorced Carter backers to make a
major eltort to assure the president's
\ ictorv in a state com cntion str;i\\ \ ote.
Before Christmas. Kennedy
strategists ruled out anv substiintiiil el
fort todeteat Carter in the South. And
as the senator's troubles mounted in
New England and the Midwest, stall
and spending lor the southern states
were cut to the bone.
While the senator made three usits
to I lorida and one to Alabama for
fund-raising and campaign purposes,
most ol the campaigning was leit to
other Kenned\ lamilv members.

From the Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter and Repub
lican Ronald Reagan marched through
Georgia, Florida and Alabama last
night, burying their White I louse i i\ als
m a three-state set of Southern presi
dential primary elections.
Carter won his home Georgia
Democratic primary by a towering
margin, polling I 1 votes tor every bal
lot cast for Sen. Edward Kennedy.
His Alabama margin was almost as
lopsided, and in Florida he was reaping
two-thirds of the vote while Kennedy
captured only 16 percent.
'National candidate'
Carter telephoned his supporters in
Birmingham, Ala., and said the results
show "it's not feasible to be elected
unless you're a national candidate."
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell put it more pointedly, saying
Kennedy can't win the presidency be
cause a Democratic nominee needs the
South.

Kennedy's deputy campaign man
ager. Patrick Lucey. said the challenger
got about what he expected in Carter
country.
"We have not been wiped out," he
said, forecasting that economic woes
will ultimately turn the tide against
Carter.
Conservative Reagan was the runa
way victor over former United Nations
Ambassador George Bush in all three
states. Florida was the closest thing to a
contest: there it was Reagan 56 per
cent. Bush 31.
The former California governor said
Ins Florida victory exceeded his fondest
hope. "1 didn't dare let myself hope for
it." lie said in a telephoned talk to sup
porters in Tampa.
Herb Harmon, the Reagan cam
paign manager in Florida, said yester
day's outcomes show that it will be dif
ficult for anyone, including former
President Gerald Ford, "to effectively
compete and play catch up."

Bush had said he hoped for a re
spectable second place in Southern
country he had all but conceded to
Reagan. His campaign manager. James
Baker, said, "We were not as pleased
with our results as we might have
been. But he added to that under
statement a vow that Bush will com
pete all the way to the GOP conven
tion.
Baker said the Morida returns in par
ticular had lowered Bush's expecta
tions in the primary just ahead in Il
linois. Baker said he now hopes for "a
respectable third-place showing'"
there. In fact, that would be a major
blow to Bush in a primary lie has called
crucial.
Kennedy didn't even campaign and
the outcomes were no surprise, but the
margins were. Carter's Georgia victory
eclipsed Kennedy's home-state
triumph in Massachusetts one week
ago. The Democratic challenger gained
65 percent of the vote there.

1 he C arter campaign victory party in
Orlando, Ma., was a subdued celebra
tion of the expected —except when the
place was evacuated because of a bomb
threat.
Carter hack in command
The Southern victories put Carter
back in command in the race for
Democratic nominating delegates. He
was gaining 179. to run his national
total to 266. Kennedy led lor 2K in
yesterday's primaries, which would put
his overall delegate strength at 143.
It will take 1666 to select a Democ
ratic presidential nominee.
In Republican competition, Reagan
was gaining 105 delegates yesterday.
Bush only 9. That would give the
former California governor 167 of the
99.X lie needs to win the nomination.
Flie Bush total stood at 45.
Rep. John Anderson, the liberal
from Illinois, skipped the South, saying
he would try for support there after
proving his credentials in more friendly

territory. He was gaining 7 percent ol
the vote in Florida and Georgia, and
wasn't on the ballot in Alabama.
Kennedy all but bypassed the South,
too, conceding the three contests to
Carter in advance, and staging only a
low-key effort to win black and Jewish
votes in Florida.

This is the last Daily of the quar
ter. We'll see you again on
Monday, March 31.

Fate in the Florida campaign, when
it became apparent that the president's
"acknowledged" mistake on the Un
ited Nations resolution concerning Is
rael had stirred a storm among Jewish
v oters, Kennedy cut a radio commer
cial and distributed 250.000 flyers on
that issue.
