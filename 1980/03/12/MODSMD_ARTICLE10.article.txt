# Revolutionary Council split by intense rivalries

Tlic Washington Post
WASHINGTON — Iran's Revolutionary
Council, designated to,take custody of the 50
American hostages in Tehran, is a mystery
shrouded body split by rivalries that may prolong
the captives' ordeal.
Although no complete official list of the council's
membership has vet been published, enough in
formation about the group's makeup has emerged
to suggest that the fate of the hostages will depend
on how the council membership lines up now in a
constantly shifting internal power struggle in Iran.
A simmering power struggle within the council
itself and Ayatollah Ruholiah Khomeini's recent
stipulation that the country's future parliament
must decide the hostages' fate indicate that numer
ous other hurdles still must be overcome in the
ongoing hostage crisis.
Ilus nit is symboli/ed by the personal rivalry ol
Iran's new president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, and
the leader of the powerful Islamic Republican
Party, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti.
Trounce
Bani-Sadr soundly trounced the Islamic Repub
lican Party's candidate in Iran's January presiden
tial election after Khomeini had barred clergymen
from candidacy, and the party's weak second
choice was disqualified because ol foreign parent
age. Beheshti, who had been touted as a possible
presidential candidate before Khomeini's decree,
is known to favor more clerical involvement in
Iranian politics.
After Bani-Sadr's landslide election with 75 per
cent of the vote, Khomeini appointed him as the
head of the Revolutionary Council in place of Be
heshti, as well as commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
But Beheshti and his party appear to be in a
better position than Bani-Sadr to line up suppor
ters in the Majles, or parliament, to be elected by
early April. While Bani-Sadr benefited from
Khomeini's tacit blessing during the presidential
election, he has not built a party organization that
can compete with the network of politically in
volved mullahs that the Islamic Republican Party
commands throughout the country.
Typical of the shifting currents of Iranian poli
tics, Beheshti in early January had indicated a de
sire to resolve the hostage crisis and get on with the
business ol shaping post-revolutionary Iran. After
Bani-Sadr was elected and began to push that view,
however. Beheshti backed away from it in what
analysts here interpret as an effort to bog Bani-Sadr

down in an unproductive pursuit.
"Beheshti has an interest in keeping the pot
boiling," a knowledgeable American source said.
No quick end
Regardless of the outcome ol Iran's parliamen
tary elections, referral of the hostage crisis to this
body probably would not produce any quick solu
tion, especially given the country's anti-American
mood.
"What junior congressman is going to get up and
say, 'Let's negotiate with the American?' " one
analyst asked incredulously.
On the Revolutionary Council, other hard-line
clergymen who could frustrate Bani-Sadr's efforts
include Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjarii.
A staunch Khomeini disciple, he was wounded laj>t
year in an assassination attempt allegedly carried
out by the fanatical lorqan terrorist group.
Ayatollah Abdol Karim Mousavi Arbedili, re
cently named by Khomeini as the revolutionary
prosecutor and reportedly also a council member,
has issued a letter demanding that U.S. diplomat
Victor Tomseth be handed over to his office in
connection with an investigation of l orqan. I
Tomseth, being held along with U.S. charge d'af
faires Bruce Laingen and an aide in the Foreign
Ministry 111 Tehran, apparently signed a diplomatic
cable that quoted an Iranian professor as saying
some of his former students belonged to Forqim
and were"mixed-up kids." This the embassy milit
ants have claimed is proof ol Tomseth's complicity
with the group.
'komitehs'
Another senior clergyman on the council is
Ayatollah Mehdavi Kani. He has played a key role
in the leadership of the elite Revolutionary Guards
and the "komitehs" that have functioned as vig
ilante gangs all over Iran.
Even the laymen on the Revolutionary Council
cannot be relied upon to support Bani-Sadr in a
crunch, analysts here believe.
The most prominent of the laymen is Foreign
Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, who lost out to
Bani-Sadr in the presidential race. Ghotb/adeh has
a record of rivalry with Bani-Sadr going back to
their competition for leadership of the Iranian
exile student movement in Europe years ago.
A leading Iranian moderate said to have re
tained a seat on the council is former Prime Minis
ter Mehdi Bazargan. But he is understood to have
virtually retired from the chaos of Iranian politics
alter the embassy seizure Nov. 4 forced him from
office.

Tomseth, being held along with U.S. charge d'af
faires Bruce Laingen and an aide in the Foreign
Ministry 111 Tehran, apparently signed a diplomatic
cable that quoted an Iranian professor as saying
some of his former students belonged to Forqim
and were"mixed-up kids." This the embassy milit
ants have claimed is proof ol Tomseth's complicity
with the group.
'komitehs'
Another senior clergyman on the council is
Ayatollah Mehdavi Kani. He has played a key role
in the leadership of the elite Revolutionary Guards
and the "komitehs" that have functioned as vig
ilante gangs all over Iran.
Even the laymen on the Revolutionary Council
cannot be relied upon to support Bani-Sadr in a
crunch, analysts here believe.
The most prominent of the laymen is Foreign
Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh, who lost out to
Bani-Sadr in the presidential race. Ghotb/adeh has
a record of rivalry with Bani-Sadr going back to
their competition for leadership of the Iranian
exile student movement in Europe years ago.
A leading Iranian moderate said to have re
tained a seat on the council is former Prime Minis
ter Mehdi Bazargan. But he is understood to have
virtually retired from the chaos of Iranian politics
alter the embassy seizure Nov. 4 forced him from
office.

WASHINGTON — Iran's Revolutionary
Council, designated to,take custody of the 50
American hostages in Tehran, is a mystery
shrouded body split by rivalries that may prolong
the captives' ordeal.
Although no complete official list of the council's
membership has vet been published, enough in
formation about the group's makeup has emerged
to suggest that the fate of the hostages will depend
on how the council membership lines up now in a
constantly shifting internal power struggle in Iran.
A simmering power struggle within the council
itself and Ayatollah Ruholiah Khomeini's recent
stipulation that the country's future parliament
must decide the hostages' fate indicate that numer
ous other hurdles still must be overcome in the
ongoing hostage crisis.
Ilus nit is symboli/ed by the personal rivalry ol
Iran's new president, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, and
the leader of the powerful Islamic Republican
Party, Ayatollah Mohammed Beheshti.
Trounce
Bani-Sadr soundly trounced the Islamic Repub
lican Party's candidate in Iran's January presiden
tial election after Khomeini had barred clergymen
from candidacy, and the party's weak second
choice was disqualified because ol foreign parent
age. Beheshti, who had been touted as a possible
presidential candidate before Khomeini's decree,
is known to favor more clerical involvement in
Iranian politics.
After Bani-Sadr's landslide election with 75 per
cent of the vote, Khomeini appointed him as the
head of the Revolutionary Council in place of Be
heshti, as well as commander-in-chief of the armed
forces.
But Beheshti and his party appear to be in a
better position than Bani-Sadr to line up suppor
ters in the Majles, or parliament, to be elected by
early April. While Bani-Sadr benefited from
Khomeini's tacit blessing during the presidential
election, he has not built a party organization that
can compete with the network of politically in
volved mullahs that the Islamic Republican Party
commands throughout the country.
Typical of the shifting currents of Iranian poli
tics, Beheshti in early January had indicated a de
sire to resolve the hostage crisis and get on with the
business ol shaping post-revolutionary Iran. After
Bani-Sadr was elected and began to push that view,
however. Beheshti backed away from it in what
analysts here interpret as an effort to bog Bani-Sadr

down in an unproductive pursuit.
"Beheshti has an interest in keeping the pot
boiling," a knowledgeable American source said.
No quick end
Regardless of the outcome ol Iran's parliamen
tary elections, referral of the hostage crisis to this
body probably would not produce any quick solu
tion, especially given the country's anti-American
mood.
"What junior congressman is going to get up and
say, 'Let's negotiate with the American?' " one
analyst asked incredulously.
On the Revolutionary Council, other hard-line
clergymen who could frustrate Bani-Sadr's efforts
include Hojatoleslam Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjarii.
A staunch Khomeini disciple, he was wounded laj>t
year in an assassination attempt allegedly carried
out by the fanatical lorqan terrorist group.
Ayatollah Abdol Karim Mousavi Arbedili, re
cently named by Khomeini as the revolutionary
prosecutor and reportedly also a council member,
has issued a letter demanding that U.S. diplomat
Victor Tomseth be handed over to his office in
connection with an investigation of l orqan. I
