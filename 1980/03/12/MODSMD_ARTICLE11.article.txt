# Mexican Sierras hit by drought, famine

EL FILAR DE MORIS,
Mexico — For 72 years, Andres
Estrada has lived in the Sierra
Tarahumara, part of the great
Sierra Madre Occidental moun
tain range that cuts Mexico's
central plateau from its western
coast. But not in all those years
can he recall a time such as this.
"We haven't eaten anything
but roots and grasses for
months," he said as he stood in
line one day last week to receive
a food package from a group of
Mennonites in this little town
about 250 miles southwest of El
Faso, Texas. "I've never seen
anything like it."
For the people of the Sierra,
life has never been easy. Their
mountain-side communities are
so isolated that Estrada, like the

" 125 Guarojio Indians camped
near here last week, walked for
two days to reach even this
lonely outpost, where electricity
and telephones are still things of
the future.
They still live as their parents
and grandparents did, farming
small patches of corn and beans
for the food they will need in the
coming year. In the years when
rains have been good, they have
had a little surplus to trade or
sell.
But last year, the rains did not
come at all, the frosts came early,
and the corn, Estrada indicates
with a hand held near his
sandal-shod foot, did not even
reach ankle height.
The result, in the words of one
official of the National Indian In
stitute, has been a "horrendous
crisis," and while no one is talk
ing of starvation at this point,
deaths from the effects of mal
nutrition, particularly among
children, are believed to be on
the rise.
Relief workers talk of children
too weak to resist disease and of
villages where no one has the
strength to come down from the
mountains to collect food at
central distribution points.
And while government offi
cials insist that they will survive
on what they get from an
emergency relief program and
the wild foods of the Sierra,
those running the modest relief
effort say it is inadequate. The
program's $500.000 budget,
points out Gilberto Almodovar
Lope/, director of the relief ef
fort, will provide only three

months' food during a crisis that
will last at least through August.
Of more than 300 food pac
kages handed out here, fully
one-third went to people who
neither needed them nor —
under the original ground rules
of the distribution — were enti
tled to them. And officials were
at a loss to explain why hundreds
ot other Indians from the sur
rounding mountains failed to
come to the distribution point.
Some suggested the distance was
too great to travel, and others'
said many Indians simply did not
know the food was being distri
buted.
"The simple truth is that never
before have we been faced with a
situation like this," said Jose
Luis Aguilar, head of the social
welfare section of the National
Indian Institute in the city of
Chihuahua, about 150 miles east
of here. "It remains to be seen
whether we can deal with it."
The lack of rain and early
frosts last year, of course, did not
affect just the subsistence far
mers of the Sierra. Since the
magnitude of Mexico's worst
crop failure in at least 30 years
became known last November,
the Mexican government has
been buying huge quantities of
grain in the United States, both
to supply domestic food needs
and to keep food-processing in
dustries operating.
But it is in the Sierra — where
short distances may take days to
travel and where many people
still barter for the goods they
need — that the crop failure has
been felt most severely.
Here, say National Indian In

stitute officials, the only job is
tilling the soil, and if the crops
fail there is no money to buj
other foodstuffs. Transportation
and communication facilities are
so nearly nonexistent that relief
workers must rely on word of
mouth to let the people know
when and where food will be dis
tributed.
It is out of the question, offi
cials say. to take food back into
the hills to the small groups ot'
two or three families that make
up the vast majority of the 3000
settlements in the Sierra
Tarahumara, a 70,000-square
kilometer area whose center is
roughly 300 miles southwest of
El Paso.
It is difficult, even in Mexico,
where roads certainly do not
match those linking various parts
of the United States, to imagine
the incredible isolation of the
Sierras. Relief officials, for
example, picked El Pilar de
Moris to distribute food.
But the road is rocky and cov
ers such vast mountains and ca
nyons that it took truck drivers
loaned to the relief effort by the
government food marketing
company, Conasupo, five hour§
to reach the town of Moris, only
12 miles away. The drivers flatly
refused to go any farther. *1
Indians like Andres Estrada of
Julio Artalejo Corpus, presideot
of the Guarojios' supreme court*
cil, said they had never visitor
the town before, and visitors asK*
ing if it would be possible to visit
a nearby Indian encampment
were told that the nearest one
was at least 15 hours away oji
horseback. I*
