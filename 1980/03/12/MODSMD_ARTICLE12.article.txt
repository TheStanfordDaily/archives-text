Stanford's increases in tuition
;ln<J room and board rates arc
comparable with increases stu
dents at other major private uni
versities will face next fall, fi
gures show.
The University usually is the
first major private institution to
announce its fees for the follow
ing year, doing so each De
cember.
Several other major schools
have now announced their in
creases and the University in

crease is about at the median of
the group.
* The University last December
announced that it would raise
tuition 12.3 percent from $5595
to $6285 next year. Total stu
dent budget, including tuition,
room and board and a standard
books and personal expenses al
lowance, will rise 12 percent
from $8750 to $9800 for next
year.
Elsewhere percentage in
creases for total student budget
range from 11.7 percent to 13.3

percent (see chart).
Of the seven schools com
pared — including Brown. Cor
nell, Dartmouth, Harvard,
Princeton, Yale and Stanford —
Harvard will be the most expen
sive institution next year with
expenses expected to hit
$10,050. Its tuition is the fifth
highest of the group, totaling
$6000.
Stanford will be the fourth
most expensive institution of the
group.
The data Stanford is receiving

now from other schools indicates
that increases here are "pretty
much in the ballpark" of com
parable institutions, said Kent
Peterson, associate vice presi
dent for business and finance.
Tuition here comprises about
half of the operating budget.
Administrators say they plan to
maintain that share from tuition,
so students can expect increases
of approximately the Consumer
Price Index plus 2 percent over
the next few years. University
forecasts state.
