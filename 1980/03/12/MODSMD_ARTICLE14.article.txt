### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
The formerly separate offices of the Dean of
Research and the Dean of Graduate Studies will
merge under the directorship of present Vice Pro
wist and Dean of Operations Research Prof.
Cierald Lieberman. effective Aug. 1.
The consolidation is due to a tighter linkage
between graduate financial aid policy and the sup
port of sponsored research and the end of Bliss
Carnochan's five-year term as dean of graduate
studies, school officials said.
Provost Donald Kennedy cited "strong relation
ships between graduate aid and the support of re
search." and the need for "leanness, efficiency and
experience among the provost's senior staff as
reasons for the expanded single position.
Kennedy consulted with the Committee on Re
search, the Committee on Graduate Studies and
the Advisory Board concerning the union of the
two positions. They have been separate since 1
"Although some problems were raised — nota

bly, the need to ensure that adequate attention is
given to the sectors of graduate training that are
not heavily involved with sponsored research —
there was was general support for combining these
two functions," said Kennedy. Carnochan agreed
that there has always been a mutual concern bet
ween the Dean of Research and the Dean of
Graduate Studies.
According to Lieberman, "It's very hard to sepa
rate the problems that occur in both (graduate
studies and research)."
He said problems mainly relate to federal fund
ing. For example, the erosion of support for the
humanities is due to a general tightening of the
Unviersity budget, as humanities generally do not
receive government funding.
He said that the merger should not detract from
the humanities."! do have a concern to see that the
University has a balanced program," he said.
Lieberman added that he is looking for an as
sociate dean, probably in the humanities.
