# Row director resigns
## 
### Victor Menon Staff Writer 
Mike Bever, director of the
Row, has announced his plans to
leave the University at the end of
this quarter. Diana Conklin, now
assistant director to the Row,
will replace him, and Bill Offut,
now Branner Hall manager, will
temporarily fill Conklin s job.
Bever turned in his resignation
last month to Norm Robinson,
associate dean of Residential
Education. He plans to move to
Louisiana to manage a general
store he recently acquired.
Bever tirst came to the Uni
versity in 1976 as the director of
Escondido Village. Two years la
ter, Bever replaced Karen An
derson as director of the Row.
"I was attracted to the job be
cause I saw the possibility of be
coming involved in the practical
education of all 3K Row houses,"
he recalled. " The Row office is
involved in almost everything
that goes on in the Row — my
job is like being the dean of a
small college."
As director of the Row, Bever
has committed himself to helping
provide residential learning in a
variety of contexts, ranging from
language and culture theme
houses to co-ops, fraternities and
houses for women only.
Bever attributes the strength
of the Row office to organization
and credibility. When there have
been problems, "we've tried to
approach them as learning op
portunities because of our em
phasis on the self-government
and independent management of
each house. We're not in the bus
iness of directing people to man
age their houses," he said.
Bever said his first priority has
been supporting and sustaining
the Row's 3<X house associates
(RAs), particularly since in most
cases they are the only staff
members in their residences.
"I believe in spending a great
deal of time with the RAs in order
to maintain the quality of life on
the Row, as well as to help the
RAs get the most out of their

jobs," he said.
Bever said that being as
sociated with the University has
been a great experience, hut lie
will be leaving it shortly to run a
general store in Louisiana.
"I've always wanted to own
my own business. I also enjoy
country living and think that that
type of lifestyle is one ot the most
important things my wife Rena
and I can provide for our chil
dren."
In discussing the future of re
sidential education here, Bever
believes that the residential sys
tem will continue to work more
closely with faculty in academic
departments.
"The strength of the residen
tial system here is its emphasis on
education, which is not easy
without faculty support," Bever
said. I le also expressed hope that
future residences will help bridge
thegapbetween livingand learn
ing.

"We don't want to turn the re
sidence' into a classroom, but
there should he an emphasis on
learning, both practical learning
as well as less intense forms ot
academic learning," he said.
