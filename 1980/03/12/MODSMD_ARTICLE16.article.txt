WASHINGTON — A House subcommit
tee last week asked the Department of Jus
tice to decide whether Syntex Laboratories,
Inc. of Palo Alto should be prosecuted for
producing two infant food formulas that
caused over 100 babies to become ill.
The Commerce oversight and investiga
tions subcommittee made its request in a re
port which criticized the company and
charged the Food and Drug Administration
with "inept performance" in recalling the
products.
The report, which followed a hearing and
subcommittee investigation, said the synthe
tic. soy-based formulas — Neo-Mull-Soy
and Clio-Free — did not contain enough
chloride, an essential nutrient for infants.
Rep. Mob Eckhardt (D-Texas), subcom
mittee chairman, said at a press conference
that "our investigations found that over 100
infants became ill — some seriously so — as a

result of having been solely dependent on the
formula for their nutrition for a period of
time." Eckhardt said that while there hud
been no deaths attributed to the formulas, no
one knows what the long-term effects of the
illness might be.
The report said an estimated 20,000 in
fants allergic to cow's milk are being fed the
formulas at any given time. At the request of
the FDA, the company recalled 8 million
cans of the formula and has since reformu
lated the product to correct the problem.
The report concluded that Syntex was in
"apparent violation" of the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act because the company labeled
and described its products as containing
more of the essential salts than they actually
did.
The six Republicans on the subcommittee
joined in a dissent from the subcommittee
report.
Rep. Norman Lent ( R-N.Y.), top-ranking
minority member, said in a statement that

the decision to refer the matter to the De
partment ot Justice "represents a quantum
leap beyond the tacts."
Such action, he said, usurps I OA's re
sponsibility and authority and "runs
roughshod over the due process rights ol the
individuals (Syntex) involved."
In Palo Alto. Syntex issued a statement
saying that the dissenting statement "proves
that Syntex has always acted responsibly."
The company said it had never had prob
lems with the formulas before this episode
and that the FDA had evidence that once the
affected infants were given sufficient
chloride they returned (o normal growth and
thrived.
The majority report criticized the FDA for
a lackadaisical approach to recalling the defi
cient product, and for not considering the
infant formula problem a serious one. FDA's
actions, the report said, "approach total dis
regard for the health and safety ol the af
fected infants."
