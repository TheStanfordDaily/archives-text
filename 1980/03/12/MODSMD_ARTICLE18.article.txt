### Mary Walp Staff Writer 
The Undergraduate Emeriti
Council vv;is formed last hill to
pass the emeriti's experience on
to other teachers and advise the
shapers ol I diversity decisions,
according to Dean ol Under
graduate Studies Met ant Katch
adourian.
They "fulfill a unique role as
teachers ol other teachers and as
counselors to those ol us who
help shape institutional policy."
he said.
The council consists of 1 I
emeriti professors who are avail
able to act as teaching consul
tants for faculty and teaching as
sistants. to advise department
chairmen on curriculum de
velopment and other educa
tional matters, and to advise
Katchadourian on various mat
ters ol undergraduate education.
Katchadourian said there is
"much flexibility" as to how the
council is to be used.
After more than a year ol
planning, the council was made
possible through a contribution
from Mr. and Mrs. I rederick
Barstow ol Boston. The original
members were emeriti profes
sors Harold Bacon, mathema
tics; Gordon Craig, history; John
Cioheen. philosophy: John
Mothershead. philosophy; Philip
Rhinelander. philosophy;
(ieorge Spindler. anthropology:
Wayne Yucinich, history; Cior
don Wright, history; and An
thony Raubitschek. classics. In
December. Konrad Krauskopf.
geology, and David Tut tic. elec
trical engineering, were added to
the council.
The original criteria used to
choose council members were
previous recognition of excel
lence in teaching and availability
and willingness to work on the
council. All ol the original mem
bers are recipients ol the Din
kelspiel Award for contributions
to undergraduate education, the
(lores Award lor teaching in
humanities and sciences. Addi
tional appointments may be
made annually. Council mem
bers may recommend other po
tential members.
Faculty members may contact
any counselor directly, through
the dean's office, or through the
Teaching and Learning Center it
they wish help in any sort ot
teaching matter.
All counseling, however, is to
be done completely indepen
dently ol the Dean's Oltice. The
counselors and faculty members
are free to choose the process
they wish to use in order to work
out problems.
The counselor mav observe

the person in the classroom situ
ation live, on videotape, or hy
any other method that the par
ties involved teel comfortable
with.
The council, along with occa
sional guests, also meets twice a
quarter with Katchadourian.
According to Ciordon Wright,
this has been the main function
of the group, acting as "a consul
tative group to the dean. "
The idea for the council grew
out ot what the reaching and
I earning Center felt to be a need
for. as Katchadourian says,
"teachers' teachers" who could
helplaeultv members with teach
ing problems or to provide ad
vice to any professor wishing to
improve his teaching. Thus, the
council, the only one ol its kind
known to Katchadourian. was
founded in order to prov ide this
service as well as to keep the
emeriti involved with under
graduate education.
Since its formation, the coun
cil lias worked mostly in eon junc
tion with Katchadourian on mat
ters concerning general under

graduate education, such as im
proving the questionnaire sent to
all graduating seniors on the
quality of their undergraduate
education.
Katchadourian said he is en
thusiastic about the potential ol
the group, stating that he is
"finding many way's to use the
council." The I ndergraduate
Emeriti Council, he said, "is not
going to be a panacea, but it is a
tiood idea and it is workinu."

geology, and David Tut tic. elec

the council.
The original criteria used to
choose council members were
previous recognition of excel
lence in teaching and availability
and willingness to work on the
council. All ol the original mem
bers are recipients ol the Din
kelspiel Award for contributions
to undergraduate education, the
(lores Award lor teaching in
humanities and sciences. Addi
tional appointments may be
made annually. Council mem
bers may recommend other po
tential members.
Faculty members may contact
any counselor directly, through
the dean's office, or through the
Teaching and Learning Center it
they wish help in any sort ot
teaching matter.
All counseling, however, is to
be done completely indepen
dently ol the Dean's Oltice. The
counselors and faculty members
are free to choose the process
they wish to use in order to work
out problems.
The counselor mav observe

the person in the classroom situ
ation live, on videotape, or hy
any other method that the par
ties involved teel comfortable
with.
The council, along with occa
sional guests, also meets twice a
quarter with Katchadourian.
According to Ciordon Wright,
this has been the main function
of the group, acting as "a consul
tative group to the dean. "
The idea for the council grew
out ot what the reaching and
I earning Center felt to be a need
for. as Katchadourian says,
"teachers' teachers" who could
helplaeultv members with teach
ing problems or to provide ad
vice to any professor wishing to
improve his teaching. Thus, the
council, the only one ol its kind
known to Katchadourian. was
founded in order to prov ide this
service as well as to keep the
emeriti involved with under
graduate education.
Since its formation, the coun
cil lias worked mostly in eon junc
tion with Katchadourian on mat
ters concerning general under

graduate education, such as im
proving the questionnaire sent to
all graduating seniors on the
quality of their undergraduate
education.
Katchadourian said he is en
thusiastic about the potential ol
the group, stating that he is
"finding many way's to use the
council." The I ndergraduate
Emeriti Council, he said, "is not
going to be a panacea, but it is a
tiood idea and it is workinu."
