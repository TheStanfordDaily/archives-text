## Carter puppets sell for pennies in Iran

"The (American) hostages are
being used by an opportunistic
peanut farmer," said James
Cockcroft, associate professor ot
sociology at Rutgers University.
Cockcroft and his wife Eva
spoke and showed slides to about
50 people here last week.
"The Iranians were selling
Jimmy Carter puppets on the
street for a few pennies," said
Eva Cockcroft, a research coor
dinator for the City Arts Work
shop in New York who went to
Iran during the governments of
both the shah and the Ayatollah
Khomeini.
She said the Iranians are hos
tile to the United States but to
President Jimmy Carter in par
ticular.
"A strong urge to have the en
tire world know what happened
under the shah . . . and the Un
ited States' role in making that
possible" rallied the Iranians
around the students' takeover of
the United States Embassy.
"You were lied to when your
president told you the shah was
admitted to the U.S. for

humanitarian reasons," said
James Cockcroft.
"The president who is respon
sible tor claiming of the hostages
says he is concerned tor their
lis cs." he added.
"The U.S. has learned the
wrong lesson from Iran." He said
Americans are under the mis
conception that "the fault was in
not being firm enough."
According to Cockcroft, the
taking of the hostages was con
venient for reinstituting the
draft.
He said the students occupy
ing the embassy are "militant,
anti-imperialist and anti-
American."
Both superpowers, however,
are equally threatening.
Cockcroft said Iran's current
emphasis is "neither Western
nor Eastern."
The takeover itself "unified
the people around anti
imperialism and gave new life to
the left," he said.
The taking of hostages was
"an inspiring act of the Iranian
people to stand up to Uncle
Sam," he said. "They are not
going to free the hostages until

the world knows what happened
under the shah."
Cockcroft reiterated that the
return of the shah is the easiest
solution to the hostage problem.
"It you're serious about com
batting Soviet expansionism, you
don't do it with the Carter doc
trine," he said. "Give those na
tions freedom to make their own
destiny."
Cockcroft urged U.S". support
of the Iranian revolution. "These
people do have a right to set up
their own form of government."
He said the U.S. should not go
to war merely "to protect the
shah."
lhe Iranians has e selected Carter
as a target tor vocally assuming a
strong human rights stand, yet
coming out tor the shah, said
Eva Cockcroft.
James Cockcroft cited a toast
of Carter's to the shah — "To
the person who shares my stan
dards of human rights" — as
promoting Iranian animosity to
ward the U.S.
He said there is "a strong urge
among the Iranian people for un
ity."

Iranian President Bani-Sadr
thus "permitted nationalists and
socialists to actively work in his
campaign."
Cockcroft said. "In voting for
Bani-Sadr. they (the Iranians)
were voting for unity."
After campaigning on the four
points of independence,
economic justice, economic sec
urity and spirituality and equal
ity, Bani-Sadr became Iran's first
president in its 2500-year history
with 76 percent of the vote.
The Iranians, looking for un
ity, voted "against anything
which might have sectarian ten
dencies in it," said Cockcroft.
He added that the five-month
strike of the combined forces of
the sub-proletariat and the
urban industrial proletariat ulti
mately crushed the shah. Iran
had a "revolution of the mas
ses," he said.
Eva Cockcroft spoke on the
culture and the society of Iran. "I
didn't expect to find the freedom
of press and activity," she said.
She expressed surprise at hear
ing the Bee Gees' musicand find
ing Marxist posters for sale.
