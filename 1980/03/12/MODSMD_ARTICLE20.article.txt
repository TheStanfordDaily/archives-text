### Michelle Vaughen Staff Writer 
New student directors for the Charles R.
Blyth fund, an undergraduate investment
program now ending its tirst year of operation,
are scheduled to be named this week, and will
take charge ol the fund's $81,000 on April 1.
An 11-member board of directors will be
chosen from an initial pool of 60 applicants,
following this week's interview of the 15 senii
finalists and 5 returning members from last
year's board.
This year's group of student directors will
begin their term with about $3000 more in net
capital to invest than their predecessors began
with last April.
"As a first-year operation, we've done really
well." said Ahmad Sami, outgoing president ot
the Bly th Fund. \n identical fund which was set
up in 1 at Occidental College in Fos Angeles
lost money its lirst year.
The fund, which was set up by an associate of
the late Charles R. Blyth. a former University
trustee and founder of a stockbrokerage. was
designed "to prov ide an educational opportun
ity that didn't exist in the curriculum," said
Margaret \nn 1 idler, assistant dean of student
affairs and advisor to the fund.
The donor, who wishes to remain anonym
ous. seeks tii otter students practical learning
experience in investing, she said, adding that the
"amount of money they actually make is not
that important."
Active investing by the student directors got
of I to a slow and cautiously conservative start,
according to hoard member Ken Perez. The
first six months of the term were spent getting
organized and ironing our administrative pro
cedures. he said.
In the meantime the money was kept in a

Merrill Lynch money market fund, which is bas
ically "like a high-paying savings account." said
Sami, a sophomore economics major. Money in
such a low -risk fund is automatically invested in
Treasury bills, commercial paper and bonds,
and returns are about 13 percent.
Last Nov ember the group began reallocating
some ol its resources from the money market
and actively investing 111 other areas, said Sami.
According to last month's figures, about 65 per
cent of the fund is in the money market fund. 1 9
percent in bonds. 12 percent in Standard Oil of
Ohio and 4 percent in a small, high-technology
firm called Applied Magnetics.
The investment breakdown follows the
"Pyramid Portfolio Investment Theory," said
Sami, which provides for a broad, conservative
base of stable investments, a middle portion of
stocks yielding good growth and interest re
turns, and a smaller top fraction of speculative
stock.
T he most lucrative investment so far has been
the Standard Oil ol Ohio stock, which has in
creased 25 percent in value in the past three
months, he said. The bonds, however, have
been declining in value as interest rates con
tinue to rise.
The nine-member board of directors meets
weekly to discuss and vote on investment prop
osals. Meetings are open, and visitors are wel
come to participate though they may not vote.
According to Perez, the group's investment
portfolio is still "too conservative." He would
like to see the group invest more ol the money
market resources into an even wider range of
investments. Experimentation n a variety ot
markets, he feels, is "the real learning experi
ence."
Perez, a sophomore international relations
major with limited pre\ ious exposure to invest

ing. said the main advantage of the program is
its service as "a safe way to learn and experi
ment."
"When you're working with $80,000 of
someone else's money, you take risks you might
not have taken with your own and learn a lot
more," he said.
Directors' investment decisions are restricted
to an extent by the provisions of the fund which
prohibit certain high-risk transactions, such as
purchasing commodities. In addition, directors
are required to prepare and submit monthly
tinancial reports to the donor and University
advisors.
Another board member, Howard Gleicher, a
senior electrical engineering major and previ
ous market observer, felt he had not learned as
much as he had anticipated, primarily because
the group "got bogged down with administra
tive matters." However, he added that the
ground had been paved for the new group to
"get into the nitty gritty" of more market trans
actions.
Beyond the thrill of managing large sums of
money, directors have been afforded other op
portunities through the program. At the end of
112 ebruaTy four of the directors met six of their
Occidental counterparts at Lake Tahoe lor a
weekend "business convention."
The two groups participated in day-long
meetings where economic outlooks and specific
market strategies were exchanged. The Occi
dental fund, hav ing done well in its fourth year,
has a current net capital worth of about
SSS.OOO, said Gleicher.
I idler, emphasizing board members' sense of
responsibility, said "the entire time was spent
meeting. Only one student went skiing, and it
was on his own time and expense.
"It wasn't just an excuse for a ski trip," she

added. Funding of ski lite tickets and rentals was
an issue that came up beforehand, said Perez,
but "we unanimously voted against it."
The $525 to cover costs for the weekend trip
came from the Directors' Expense Fund, which
was set up by the donor to allow student direc
tors to "feel free to pursue costly learning ex
periences," said Gleicher.
Fifty percent of investment income is directed
into the Expense Fund, 25 percent is allocated
to the University for scholarships and the re
maining 25 percent is returned to the Blyth
Fund.
To date about $2500 had been spent out of
the Expense Fund to cover the costs of periodi
cal subscriptions, office and administrative ex
penses. business dinners, hosting prominent
guests and special conventions.
The $4000 currently sitting in the fund poses
somewhat of a problem for the directors, ac
cording to Perez.
Not wanting to lose their tax-exempt status as
a nonprofit organization, the directors cannot
allow the expense fund to accumulate ewer time,
he said. Yet they are "having problems getting
rid of (the money ) constructively."
"We could fly to business conventions every
other weekend and spend a couple hundred on
more periodicals that we'd never read, but that
wouldn't be responsible," he said.
A sense of honor and responsibility, more so
than a strong financial background, are impor
tant criteria currently being used to select the
new student directors, said Fidler.
A strong interest, a willingness to make a
three-to-10 hour a week time commitment, and
leadership skills are also being sought, as well as
a balance of men and women, and diversity
among ethnic groups and majors, she added.
