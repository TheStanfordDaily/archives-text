empty six-pack containers as the
instructor pours bottles into
carafes. In a matter ol minutes,
rowsol noses peek into glasses ol
Burgundy, inhaling slowly for a
clue to the characteristics of the
alcohol. II this sounds like a
scene from "Everything You
Always Wanted to Know About
Wine But Were Afraid to Ask,"
you're not far off.
It's a class, without books ant'
with a final that anyone would
love to study for. It's winetasting.
and tonight's selection features
cognac and brandy for the 70
people taking Bruce Cass' series
on European Regions. Cass, a
member of the Board ol Direc
tors for the Society of Winetas
ters. has taught three series here
for the last eight years.
With about 70 percent ol the
sniffing, sipping and smiling par
ticipants comprised ol Stanford
.students, Cass' class also attracts
members of the Palo Alto com
munity and a large alumni popu
lation. especially lor the blind
tastings, when the type ol wine
sampled is unknown to the tas
ters.

!pcople. struggling to describe
what is in a glass of wine while

C'ass. He organized the classes
'(Basic Tasting. European Reg
ions and California Perspectives)
.with the purpose ol "raising
people's confidence. Everyone is
equally sensitive toward wine.
They just don't have a lot of con
centration and memory." lie
commented.
' "Basic Tasting is sort of a pep
talk." explained Cass. "Califor
nia Perspectives and European

Regions are dry recitations ol
facts and an opportunity to taste
some lairly spectacular wines."
Not dry
Cass' class is anything hut dry.
Alter a lengthy discussion about
growing patterns in France,
someone questioned, "Is there
anything else we need to do?"
"Drink," he responded. But
Cass is the first to point out "the
one-ounce pour."
"It's a pretty good social time
lor people, but they don't know
that until they take it. Some
people come because they're in
terested in wine, others come be
cause they like to drink," he said,
quickly emphasizing the rarity ol
the latter reason.
Once seated around the table
with four lull glasses and an as
sortment of French cheeses to re-
Iresh the palate, the students ap
peared very interested in tire sub
ject.
Beats liars
"It tops off an ideal Tuesday.
This Chenin Blanc would go per
fectly with the deviled eggs at the
Cioose," said Nat Williams, a
junior.
"It's better than going to the
'O,' said senior Bob Latham.
"I recommend it. Not only did
I learn about wines, but I had a
wonderful and giddy time,"
commented junior Sue Salt/.
Cass lectures on various as
pects related to wine and
winemaking. One lecture de
scribed the process used to make
distills such as cognac and
brandy: another outlined possi
ble trips to winetasting cellars in
the area and Napa Valley.
Avoid abuse
In addition to a commitment
to the wine business. Cass has
strong feelings on the problems
incited by consumption. "I have
spent three years badgering the

University administration to
tii kc an active stance on the ques
tion ol alcohol ahuse. Classes
and presentations could play a
valuable adjunctive role in
mediating those efleets. I teach a
social skill: how to be responsi
ble and moderate vet have a
good time."
"I've done a lot ol drinking in
my day. but not educated drink

Cass stresses 111 his classes. "I

don't say whether a wine is good
or bad. I teach people to identify
the characteristics and let them

The classes are o fie red
through the ASSI for a charge

with a sampling of 10 wines an
evening. Cass plans to teach all
three series next quarter.
