I'm surprised you could ev en find me in this hook
ol iin issue. Mere're some of the many questions
l'\ e received lately. II you've submitted an inquiry
and it hasn't turned up on these hallowed pages yet.
have patience.
Dear Bug Me,
How can the University get away with placing
unmarked, gray bollards in the middle of hike
paths? Why were the thinner, more conspicuous
white poles replaced? Who can students pressure to
change this situation, i.e., add reflectors or markers,
before someone is badly hurt?

Bicyclists Bothered and Bewildered by Bollards
Well. I'm not going to explain the bollards, as
I've already done so in a past column, and there
have been numerous articles about them as well.
As lor the lack ot reflectors, that should soon be
remedied, authorities say.
The wooden bollards which have not yet been
titted with reflectors will soon undergo that reno
\ation, according to campus planner Max
Ma/enko. who said that the contractor for the job
ran out ol the disks and is awaiting a new supply.
The gray concrete bollards are supposed to have
an exposed aggregate. Ma/enko said, which should
reflect light at night for greater \ isibility. I or this
reason they will not have reflectors attached.
Dear ling Me,
The bells that ring between classes at Terman
drive me up a wall. It seems like they're at least 50
decibels above any OS HA standard imaginable.
Can 't they turn the damn things down, or better vet.
off?!?
Ringing Ears
"To our knowledge, it's the standard University
bell." said Assoc. Dean for Business Affairs Ken
Down. He added that the loudness was "great for
waking up the students and professors and remind
ing them ol their next class."
Down said he would call Health Physics anyway
and ask them to check the decibel level ot Terman's
bells.
Dear Bug Me,
The new History Corner is beautiful and makes
my department, English, look like an inner-cit v high
school. But it is noticeably deficient in two areas:

1) bike racks, those of us without kick stands
have absolutely no place to put our hikes.
2) left-handed desks. In this era of non
discrimination and equal rights, they lia\ e not one
left-handed desk in either the main lecture hall or
Room 205, a large lecture room upstairs. I his is
ridiculous; I get tired of twisting my arms and hack
into yoga positions to he able to take notes.
Anv chance oj recti Iving these situations '.'
M.I.
Robert Nerrie. senior project manager, said he
was aware ol the hike problem. I here were only a
minimal number ol places to lit bike racks near the
new building, he said, adding that campus planner
Max Ma/cnko knew ol the need and was working
on it.
Ma/enko confirmed this, saying that cut-outs in
the landscaping along the mall next to the building
had been set aside for bike racks. They will be put
in "sometime in the near future." Ma/enko said.
"There's a whole list ol areas with need for addi
tional bicycle parking." Ma/enko added. "We're
doing what we can to accommodate the growing
traffic."
Nerrie was surprised at the report that there
were no left-handed desks in the big rooms. He
said that they had recogni/ed the need lor such
desks and had planned to place one on the left aisle
ol every other row. lie said that the planners had
wanted a lel'tie desk in each row but were using the
existing seats lor the new building and didn't have
enough.
I went by to count lor niysell. to see who was
pulling my proverbial leg. It turns out there are
left-handed desks in both the aforementioned
rooms, but not even in e\ cry other row. The lecture
hall. Room 2 downstairs, has live Iclt-haiuled
desks, mostly near the front ol the room. I hat's out
ol a total ol 150 seats. The upstairs room has three
such desks out of a total ol about SO.
My only suggestion is to get there early il you
need one ol those scarce commodities.
Just enough room here lor a good luck wish on
your finals. Here's my address, so when you llasli
upon a question in the coming week or over vaca
tion, you know where to send it. This has been Hug
