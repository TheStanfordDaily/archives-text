## Editorial Support Anderson 
### 
Oi all the presidential candidates who
have crowded the campaign trail this elec
tion year. Illinois Representative John
Anderson seems to he the one most de
serving of support.
Anderson is forthright, articulate, hon
est and unafraid to take clear, often con
troversial, stands on a broad range of is
sues. Hiis in itself is a welcome contrast to
the other candidates of both parties, but
more importantly, Anderson's positions
are more often than not remarkably sensi
ble.
Considered a liberal Republican by most
members of his party, Anderson takes un
questionably liberal stances 011 foreign pol
icy and social welfare questions, while
standing firmly on conservative ground
with fiscal policy issues. During his 10
terms in the House of Representatives, he
has proven himself to be a staunch defen
der of the environment, a leading suppor
ter of the Equal Rights Amendment as well
as the extension of the ratification deadline
for the amendment, and a firm advocate of
gun control.
But it is Anderson's stand on energy —
the most critical issue that this country will
face for some time to come — that is the
clearest indicator of his worth. '
America must conserve energy now. In
creases in the price of gasoline have proven
to be the best means of lowering individual
energy consumption. Gasoline has clearly
been underpriced in this country for de
cades: Anderson proposes a 50-cents
per-gallon tax on gasoline that will force
people to conserve without having their
added dollars go directly to the oil corn
pa nies.
The money from the tax will go into the
endangered Social Security fund. In tan
dem with .this, Anderson proposes a 50
percent cut in Social Security withholding.
Thus the gasoline tax will not ignite an
inflationary spiral because consumers' in
come will increase in order to meet the
increased costs oi essential energy.
As the price of oil and gas reaches its true
value, not only will less be consumed, but
the search for workable alternative energy
sources will be spurred as prices for con
ventional fuels increase.
This plan is not without its drawbacks,
however. Anderson, or any one else prop
osing such a plan, must realize the poten
tially disastrous consequences of the plan

to persons on very small or fixed incomes,
for whom higher gas prices would mean a
substantial increase in the cost of their es
sential energy needs. An effort will have to
be made to lessen the dangerous effects on
many of this country's poor and aged re
sulting from an energy policy that necessar
ily puts some individuals at a disadvantage.
The plan will also substantially raise the
nation's Consumer Price Index and thus
the salaries of millions of workers whose
incomes are tied to the CPI. Here again is a
side effect of the plan that must be antici
pated.
The foreign policy implications of An
derson's tough proposal could be enorm
ous. Our dependence on foreign oil is a
direct result of the waste and lack of energy
awareness at home. In this critical area.
Anderson has proven that he is the only
candidate willing to face the problem with
a proposal that has some bite in it.
Anderson's foreign policy stances have
consistently merited praise. His support of
SALT II and the Panama Canal treaty
show his realization of the changing nature
ot the world political structure in which the
United States can no longer play chess with
other nations.
In all. Anderson is a very attractive can
didate. Indeed, his biggest problem to date
is that many people don't think he is a
viable candidate. They perceive him as the
best candidate who has no chance to win.
It such a reasonable and sane alternative
in this campaign actually doesn't stand a
chance, that's a sad commentary on our
electoral system and the nation's voters
and political heavyweights. But as the
Vermont and Massachusetts primaries
have proven. Anderson's candidacy is not a
pipe dream.
We urge you to vote for Anderson in the
upcoming primaries. If you are a registered
Democrat and agree that Anderson de
serves your support, you have until May 5
to change your registration to Republican.
The age-old adage that we should vote for
the person and not the party should be
come increasingly apparent to many
Democrats.
John Anderson is a candidate, not a
political party's whipping boy, who needs
the support of those who want competent
leadership in Washington. His beliefs cross
party lines. They make sense for America.
