## 'Yes' on Jarvis II is selfish 
### 
On Tuesday, June 3. 19N0.
California \oters will he pre
sented with the unique oppor
tunity to learn from their mis
takes. In the spirit of the motion
picture industry, Howard Jarvis
has come up with a sequel to his
unluckily-numbered tax initia
tive of several years ago.
While the latter was ohv iously
popular at the polls, the detri
mental impact of its consequ
ences has since been felt in many
areas ot society in this state.
Educational, recreational, lib
rary and numerous other state
and county services have en
dured crippling budget cuts as an
indirect result of its passage.
Like its cunning predecessor,
the Jarvis II tax initiative is de
ceptively simple in text and con
sists of three basic parts:
(a) Taxes on or measured by in
come which are imposed under
the Personal Income Tax Law or
any successor thereto shall he at
rates not to exceed 50 percent o)
those rales in effect for the 1978
taxable year.
(b) the Legislature shall provide
lor a system o) adjusting the per
sonal income tax brackets under
the Personal Income Tax Law of
any successor thereto to reflect
annual changes in the California
Consumer Price Index or any
successor thereto.
Ic) Elimination of the property
tux on business inventories.
William Ha mm (Legislative
Analyst), Robert O'Connor
(franchise Tax Board), and
Richard Silberman (Director of
finance) together with Hamm
have projected the revenue loss
at about $4 billion each year
until l l >S2.
Under Jarvis 11. 3.5 million
Californians with a taxable in
come of up to $15.0(10 would re
ceive an average tax reduction of
$130. These individuals repre
sent 50 percent of all citizens til
ing personal income tax returns,
vet they would receive only 15
percent of the savings. The top 3

percent of taxpayers who make
550.000 or more would receive
30 percent of the benefits, or
about SI billion.
Relatively speaking, while
Proposition 13 proved to be a
nuisance to serv ices and schools.
Jarvis II will undoubtedly be a
catastrophe. State surplus pre
vented many of the cutbacks
which had been feared prior to
passage of the former, but now
the rescue effect of surplus is
gone. Of all the citi/ens who will
thus suiter trom passage of this
initiative, young people unfortu
nately stand to lose the most as
primary consumers ot educa
tional and recreational services.
Most tragically, unlike its pre
decessor. Jarvis II threatens to
cripple the crippled. According
to Luigi Luzzatti. M.D., director
ot the Stanford Birth Defects
Center, programs catering to
handicapped children such as
Crippled Children's Service and
Medi-Cal plan to reduce their
budgets by 30 percent it this in
itiative passes. Such services to
the disabled were not signific
antly affected by Proposition 13
a*ide from speech and physical
therapy programs in schools.

which were ultimately bolstered
by local junior college volun
teers.
It should thus be clear that the
citi/ens of California will be
laced with a choice between self
ishness and altruism at the polls
in June. A "yes"* vote on Jarv is 11
will mean a saving of $100-200
to the average taxpayer; it may
unfortunately also mean that a
deal child does without needed
sign language training, or that an
adolescent who might otherwise
have been involved in an ex
tracurricular activity at school
turns to drugs or alcohol for
"kicks."
As intelligent voters, we need
to be wary of initiatives such as
Jarvis 11. which indicate only
their positive aspects in print on
the ballot. The lesson we should
have learned from Proposition
13 is the same as that taught in
the famous story of Daniel
Webster and dealings with the
devil: we sell ourselves short in
the long run when we succumb to
the temptation of immediate
personal gain.

On Tuesday, June 3. 19N0.
California \oters will he pre
sented with the unique oppor
tunity to learn from their mis
takes. In the spirit of the motion
picture industry, Howard Jarvis
has come up with a sequel to his
unluckily-numbered tax initia
tive of several years ago.
While the latter was ohv iously
popular at the polls, the detri
mental impact of its consequ
ences has since been felt in many
areas ot society in this state.
Educational, recreational, lib
rary and numerous other state
and county services have en
dured crippling budget cuts as an
indirect result of its passage.
Like its cunning predecessor,
the Jarvis II tax initiative is de
ceptively simple in text and con
sists of three basic parts:
(a) Taxes on or measured by in
come which are imposed under
the Personal Income Tax Law or
any successor thereto shall he at
rates not to exceed 50 percent o)
those rales in effect for the 1978
taxable year.
(b) the Legislature shall provide
lor a system o) adjusting the per
sonal income tax brackets under
the Personal Income Tax Law of
any successor thereto to reflect
annual changes in the California
Consumer Price Index or any
successor thereto.
Ic) Elimination of the property
tux on business inventories.
William Ha mm (Legislative
Analyst), Robert O'Connor
(franchise Tax Board), and
Richard Silberman (Director of
finance) together with Hamm
have projected the revenue loss
at about $4 billion each year
until l l >S2.
Under Jarvis 11. 3.5 million
Californians with a taxable in
come of up to $15.0(10 would re
ceive an average tax reduction of
$130. These individuals repre
sent 50 percent of all citizens til
ing personal income tax returns,
vet they would receive only 15
percent of the savings. The top 3

percent of taxpayers who make
550.000 or more would receive
30 percent of the benefits, or
about SI billion.
Relatively speaking, while
Proposition 13 proved to be a
nuisance to serv ices and schools.
Jarvis II will undoubtedly be a
catastrophe. State surplus pre
vented many of the cutbacks
which had been feared prior to
passage of the former, but now
the rescue effect of surplus is
gone. Of all the citi/ens who will
thus suiter trom passage of this
initiative, young people unfortu
nately stand to lose the most as
primary consumers ot educa
tional and recreational services.
Most tragically, unlike its pre
decessor. Jarvis II threatens to
cripple the crippled. According
to Luigi Luzzatti. M.D., director
ot the Stanford Birth Defects
Center, programs catering to
handicapped children such as
Crippled Children's Service and
