# Blind dates deal double disaster
## 
### 
My first blind date was with a
girl from foot hi 11 College named
Bianea Butbreath. At first I was
a little hesitant when one of my
ex-best triends, Sammy Yenta,
tried to set me up on a blind date
â€” I wouldn't even have a cane
lor the girl, and 1 didn't know
where in the heck I was going to
find one of those special dogs!
Then Sammy explained to me
that a blind date was with
"someone who has never met

you before." I thought that this
face would greatly improve my
chances for a successful date, so 1
asked Sammy for some more
info, and he told me that Bianca
was Irom Foothill.
That was the clincher right
there (I had heard a whole lot of
stories about these girls from the
/etes). A blind date with a girl
Irom Foothill who didn't even
know me, oooh baby was I
psyched.
I first felt something was
wrong that Friday night, how
ever. when 1 drove up the But
breaths' driveway and noticed
that there was this huge party
going on. All the relatives were
there, singing and wearing
pointed party hats, and Mom and
Dad were drinking, dancing and
celebrating along with the
neighbors. There were streamers
and cake and these signs up
around the house saying, "Con
gratulations, Bianca!" and "Bet
ter Late Than Never!"
I was about to turn my car
around when I saw her come out
the front door, amid deafening
applause, wearing a '50s dress,
bobby socks and saddle shoes.
Her dad yelled, "Be home by
four o'clock." Then she hopped
into my car and said slowly to my
lace. "Hello there, my name is
Bianca."
I can't begin to describe what
hit me. It was as it 300 buffaloes
came charging out of her mouth,
running and crapping all over
me. I couldn't believe it; her
breath was so bad I had to vent
my windows on the way to din
ner.
And the little surprises didn't
end there. We stopped at the
drugstore because she said she
needed some aspirin, and out she
walked with three tins of Skoal
and a pouch of Redman. On top
ol that, she then spilled her cup
ful of chew"hudda" ail inside my
car. Dinner was even worse. I
was trying to face away from her
while eating, my fork poking my

cheeks almost every time, and all
Bianca could do was just "ha ha
ha" everyone away from our ta
ble. No one even came with the
bill, so we just left.
Perhaps the most embarras
sing moment was at the movie,
which was Kramer r.v. Kramer. I
have a warped perception of
Kramer because at every sad
moment Bianca would start pas
sing gas. The little kid would ask.

"Is Mommy ever coming
home?" and sure enough, the
"air of death" would rise from
her seat.
Halt the time I didn't know if
my eyes were watering because
of the movie or because of
Bianca. And it you think / was
upset, you should have seen the
people around us. At first they
would just hold their noses and
turn away, but by the end of the
movie they were just screaming
and vellinu at her to cut it out.

As I pulled into her driveway,
she let another one of those nasty
"bunnies" fly. and I told her that
I was feeling a little sick and that
I was going to stay in the car. She
then threw me one last punch by
saying a long "thank you" in my
face, before closing the door.
The next day I was riding my
bike through White Plaza and
saw Sammy at the bookstore. He
cried. "Hey. how was your date
last night? Do you want to no on

another one?" I just flipped him
off and kept on riding. The next
day I jogged up to the dish, col
lected a whole bunch of cow
chips, and then Irisbeed the
meadow muffins into Sammy's
open dorm window.
He was pretty upset, but you
know, I had a right to be mad.
Now I don't like to rate girls (that
would be sexist and male
chauvinistic), but if you forced
me to. I'd have to say that cute
Bianca was no higher than a "3."
Although she was really good
looking (and I thought this was
strange), by wearing that weird
outfit, chewing, passing gas and
breathing death itself. Bianca
was almost into the negatives.
Now I'm the first one to admit
that Bill "Early-Date" Kem
meries is no American Gigolo
(Editor's Note: Look at his pic
ture.), but still the fact was that
little Sammy Yenta had fixed me
up with a "3," and boy was I
mad.
Sammy called me about a
week later, apologized and asked
me if I wanted to go on another
blind date with some girl in Roth
named Shelly Tuna. At first I
hung up on him, but then
thoughts of revenge made me
call Sammy back up and accept
the date. It was time for a little
"get even-Steven" number.
Knocking on Shelly's door
that Friday night. I was wearing
only a pair of heart pattern boxer
shorts and a propeller beanie. I
had painted a bull's eye around

my navel and two lipstick hearts
around my nipples. I had made
my face up like a smiling P.T.
Barnum clown, blacked out my
teeth, chewed on garlic buds
since 6 p.m., and held a bunch of
dead flowers in my hands. Al
though I really didn't need to say
it, I yelled, "Surprise!" as she
opened thedoorand I found my
self staring at the goddess of
beauty.
What in the heck can you do

when you are wearing boxer
shorts and a clown lace, and have
a had case o! "Biunca Breath.'
And I had gone all out, too. Be
sides already having bought tic
kets tor Malibu Grand Prix Rac
ing, I was driving some Iriend's
dumpy pickup truck and had
brought along only the Donny
and Marie tape that was in the
tape deck.
And I froze my rear off at
Malibu Grand Prix. The whole
time I was trying to tell her that it
was all a joke, but the noise
drowned me out, and stoic
Shelly, never saying a word, just
kept us racing around and
around. We were going so fast
that my propeller hat just took
off. and it was so cold that my
clown face froze into a perma
nent smile. Every time we passed
the Malibu pit crew, they were
just rolling on the ground, laugh
ing.
On the way home I was about
to say something, but Shelly gave
me a look that said, "It you open
your zoo-mouth again, I'll kill
you," so we just sat in silence,
listening to the Osmonds sing
"Just Like a Yo-Yo" (I totally
identified with the song). Occa
sionally I would hear Shelly mut
ter something about how she and
Sammy "used to be good
friends," and how she was going
to "jog to the dish" the first thing
in the morning.
After dropping off Shelly, I

did some heavy thinking about
my two blind dates. I couldn't
help but think how I had looked
and acted like Bianca did on my
first blind date, and had had al
most the same effect. In fact, it
was almost as if Bianca had . . .
tried ... to ... oh.
