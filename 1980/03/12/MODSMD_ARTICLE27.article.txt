## Campus always is under construction 
### 
The rain has stopped, the skies
have cleared and once again the
sound of construction can be
heard in our land.
For about a week and a half
this past January, while the rain
poured down, construction stop
ped all over the Stanford cam
pus. For a little while there was
silence. It was almost eerie. No
matter where you went, you
couldn't hear banging jackham
mers or beeping back-hoes. No
pipes were being laid, no ramps
were being built. When the
weather cleared up. things went
back to normal.
Construction is a pa rt of life at

Stanford. In the tour years I've
lived here, I've come to accept it
as commonplace, yet this short
time-out led me to reflect.
When I first arrived in the au
tumn of 1976, the three new
Row houses (558, American
Studies and Casa Italiana) had
just been completed, Terman
Engineering was under construc
tion. the History Corner was
closed hut remained unaltered,
the parking lot beyond Lagunita
was a field. Tanner Fountain was
a street, the new Green Library
wing was a parking lot and the
overhaul of the computer science
department was just somebody's

bright idea.
The astonishing pace of con
struction is not peculiar to my
era. It has been going on for
quite some time: it's one of the
most dependable Stanford in
stitutions. Most of the campus
we see every day has been built
in the last 25 years.
Imagine what Stanford looked
like not too long ago, without
Meyer Library, CERAS, the
Law School, Florence Moore,
Tresidder, the Biz School, the
Med Center, the Physics Tank,
Mitchell Earth Sciences, Storke
Pub Building, White Plaza, you
name it.
Imagine Stanford without
Wilbur, Stern, the Cowell Clus
ter or Escondido, when campus
ended at Green Library. This
place must have looked like a
cow pasture.
This isn't big news for perma
nent residents of the,community.
But most of us, who spend only
four or five years here, really
have no sense of Stanford's past.
We do not realize the extent to
which it is a community in trans
formation. We see some build
ings go up during our stay, but we
are unaware of what has come
before. We are unaware of the
trend. For me, Terman is a new
building. For this year's
freshmen it is timeless.
I'm not coming down on prog
ress. Don't get me wrong. All
this construction is invigorating
(Who says Americans can't build
anything right? They sure can
build universities). I like to go to
dedications and ground break
ings. I like to eat and study and
sit in rooms that smell of new
plaster and paint.
Yet, there is something un
settling about all this change. We
are brought up on stories of
alumni, not necessarily Stanford
alumni, who leave their beloved
schools to go out into the world

and make their fortunes. Years
later, with their fortunes made,
they return to their under
graduate haunts to ponder the
permanence of personal
changes.
A Stanford alumnus (or
alumna), unless he made his for
tune very fast, wouldn't be able
to find his way around campus.
Now that my Stanford career
is nearing its end. I'm starting to
wonder what the place is going to
look like if I come back. What
great new complexes will have
rendered my old hang-outs un
recognizable? (With the chance
of a major earthquake growing
greater every year, even the
geography may have changed
substantially.)
Perhaps the Escondido high
rises are a modest indication of
things to come. We may live to
sec a 20-story music center, a
philosophy tower (ivory?), a
sky-scraping psychology annex or
an administrative complex to
rival the World Trade Center.
Will future Stanford Folio
Calendars feature sunset shots of
the Stanford skyline? Or will
Stanford expand up into the hills,
replacing the unintellectual
cows, who reside there now, with
terraced dormitories and re
search ccnters?
Grand speculation is the com
pensation for the minor incon
veniences involved in living in a
community under construction:
the mud and the noise, the unex
pected link fences encountered
while hurrying to class, the elu
sive library book moving from
stack to new stack, and the ob
noxious future student (Class of
'99) whom we will encounter in
our middle age, wondering that
his school must have looked like
a cow pasture back when we
were young.

to find his way around campus.
Now that my Stanford career
is nearing its end. I'm starting to
wonder what the place is going to
look like if I come back. What
great new complexes will have
rendered my old hang-outs un
recognizable? (With the chance
of a major earthquake growing
greater every year, even the
geography may have changed
substantially.)
Perhaps the Escondido high
rises are a modest indication of
things to come. We may live to
sec a 20-story music center, a
philosophy tower (ivory?), a
sky-scraping psychology annex or
an administrative complex to
rival the World Trade Center.
Will future Stanford Folio
Calendars feature sunset shots of
the Stanford skyline? Or will
Stanford expand up into the hills,
replacing the unintellectual
cows, who reside there now, with
terraced dormitories and re
search ccnters?
Grand speculation is the com
pensation for the minor incon
veniences involved in living in a
community under construction:
the mud and the noise, the unex
pected link fences encountered
while hurrying to class, the elu
sive library book moving from
stack to new stack, and the ob
noxious future student (Class of
'99) whom we will encounter in
our middle age, wondering that
his school must have looked like
a cow pasture back when we
were young.
(bred Cheever is a co-terminal
student majoring in history.)
The rain has stopped, the skies
have cleared and once again the
sound of construction can be
heard in our land.
For about a week and a half
this past January, while the rain
poured down, construction stop
ped all over the Stanford cam
pus. For a little while there was
silence. It was almost eerie. No
matter where you went, you
couldn't hear banging jackham
mers or beeping back-hoes. No
pipes were being laid, no ramps
were being built. When the
weather cleared up. things went
back to normal.
Construction is a pa rt of life at

Stanford. In the tour years I've
lived here, I've come to accept it
as commonplace, yet this short
time-out led me to reflect.
When I first arrived in the au
tumn of 1976, the three new
Row houses (558, American
Studies and Casa Italiana) had
just been completed, Terman
Engineering was under construc
tion. the History Corner was
closed hut remained unaltered,
the parking lot beyond Lagunita
was a field. Tanner Fountain was
a street, the new Green Library
wing was a parking lot and the
overhaul of the computer science
department was just somebody's

bright idea.
The astonishing pace of con
struction is not peculiar to my
era. It has been going on for
quite some time: it's one of the
most dependable Stanford in
stitutions. Most of the campus
we see every day has been built
in the last 25 years.
Imagine what Stanford looked
like not too long ago, without
Meyer Library, CERAS, the
Law School, Florence Moore,
Tresidder, the Biz School, the
Med Center, the Physics Tank,
Mitchell Earth Sciences, Storke
Pub Building, White Plaza, you
name it.
Imagine Stanford without
Wilbur, Stern, the Cowell Clus
ter or Escondido, when campus
ended at Green Library. This
place must have looked like a
cow pasture.
This isn't big news for perma
nent residents of the,community.
But most of us, who spend only
four or five years here, really
have no sense of Stanford's past.
We do not realize the extent to
which it is a community in trans
formation. We see some build
ings go up during our stay, but we
are unaware of what has come
before. We are unaware of the
trend. For me, Terman is a new
building. For this year's
freshmen it is timeless.
I'm not coming down on prog
ress. Don't get me wrong. All
this construction is invigorating
(Who says Americans can't build
anything right? They sure can
build universities). I like to go to
dedications and ground break
ings. I like to eat and study and
sit in rooms that smell of new
plaster and paint.
Yet, there is something un
settling about all this change. We
are brought up on stories of
alumni, not necessarily Stanford
alumni, who leave their beloved
schools to go out into the world

and make their fortunes. Years
later, with their fortunes made,
they return to their under
graduate haunts to ponder the
permanence of personal
changes.
A Stanford alumnus (or
alumna), unless he made his for
tune very fast, wouldn't be able
to find his way around campus.
