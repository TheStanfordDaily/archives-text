## Scott Raphael Report reckless pilot here 
### 
As a student here and member of the Stan
ford 1 lying Cluh. I have been concerned about the
recent midnight aerial activity over campus. Speci
fically, what I am referring to is the low-level buz
zing of the residence halls by an unidentified
single-engine airplane, which has disturbed a
number of people within the University community
lately, and particularly alarmed those of us who do
fly and are gravely concerned about the danger
associated with such reckless and irresponsible ac
tivity.
Federal aviation regulations specifically prohibit
the flight of an aircraft below an altitude of 1000
feet above cities, towns and other congested areas,
except when necessary for takeoff and landing.
Recent student reports, corroborated by Palo Alto
radar "fixes," have indicated that the individual
involved has intermittently made passes over the
campus as low as 150 feet, clearly endangering the
safety of everyone here.
Such activities, which are legal over open water
or sparsely-populated areas, can be thrilling to
pilots and passengersbut frequently result in major
accidents and fatalities when practiced over subur
ban areas with a great number of tall, less-than
well-marked structures. The National Transporta
tion Safety Board has more than enough cases on
file where such stunts have killed innocent people
on the ground.

While the Air Traffic Control authorities in this
area have received numerous complaints about the
problem here, they need our help to positively
identify the airplane and pilot responsible.
Since the Palo Alto Airport control tower closes
at 11 every evening, such midnight raids on the
campus cannot be verified through our local air
port, and this probably explains why our
barnstormer keeps such late hours.
If anyone should see this happen during daylight
hours, however, it is important to get the number
off the side of the aircraft, to observe any other
pertinent information such as the color, type of
aircraft, and the direction it was headed and to
report it immediately to the Palo Alto Airport
tower at 856-1277.
While it is impossible to get the aircraft's iden
tification at night, the Bay Area's Radar Approach
Control Center can spot a plane as low as 100 feet
above the campus. A prompt call to them at 273-
61 15 can allow them to get a fix on the airplane,
and track it to the airport of departure where the
local police and the FAA can permanently resolve
the problem.
While the task of air safety is primarily the re
sponsibility of those of us in the air. the job of
keeping it safe is shared among us all.
