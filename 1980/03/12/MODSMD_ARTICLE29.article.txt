## Storey mother concerned 
### 
As the mother of one of the Storey residents who
lost so much in the fire, I would like to express my
thanks to all the people who responded so lovingly
to people in need. The mountains of clothes
brought from all over campus, the roses, transpor
tation, books, and dinners from various fraternities
and benefits from others on the womens' behall
certainly showed great heart at Stanford and
helped tremendously to boost their spirits.
There are. however, recent statements regarding
the fire that have caused me to reflect on the vul
nerability of students housed all over the Univer
sity. In view of the most recent explanation of the
cause of fire as an extension cord, and the long
discussion by Diana Conklin regarding abuses of
electrical appliances by students, 1 feel compelled
isk why there have been no written guidelines
students to follow regarding appliances, exten
on cords and the like.
1 question whether one fire drill is enough during
a year's time and even whether Storey House has
ever held a fire drill this year.
I am still waiting to hear a clear explanation of
the "missing" fire extinguisher, because the ad
ministrations statements conflict with those of the
women who searched for one at the onset of the fire.
I further question the priorities of a university

with an operating budget of $ I 30 million that finds
S2 million to provide sprinkler systems lor
Row houses too costly. The $20,000 worth of
safety precautions spent on Storey House last Au
gust was clearly not enough.
I am thankful that this fire occurred at such a
time when so many women were away from the
house. In view ol the damage I have seen. I am
appalled to think what might have happened in a
nighttime fire. I am certain that those in responsi
ble positions within this administration are aware
that the possibility existed that there might not
have been 39 survivors.
My own admittedly biased, emotional viewpoint
as a parent is that many things point to the fact that
my daughter and her peers were vulnerable as a
result of the Uni\ersity's short-sightedness when it
comes to keeping its residences in safe repair and
providing adequate safety precautions.
I only hope that the administration that has seen
lit to spend $90,000 on bollards across campus will
also see its responsibility to relocate and reimburse
these women and proceed to make certain that
there are no more victims ol misplaced priorities.
