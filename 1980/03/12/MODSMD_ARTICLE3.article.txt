Hopes tor a new house tor the 39
Storey House women, left homeless by
a tire early last week, were dashed
Monday when I niversity officials an
nounced that the Buck Estate, prop
osed as a potential location, was a
safety hazard and could no longer he
considered for housing.
The Buck Estate, a large property
owned hy the University in Menlo
Park, was proposed late last week as a
possible new residence for the Storey
refugees. It is an older house that was
donated by the Buck family to the Uni
versity several months ago. University
officials hoped to place 22 ot the
women in the house, four to each room
" The best ot all worlds whould have
all of you together; the Buck Estate
would have done this," said Jim Lyons,
dean of student affairs, to a group ot
Storey residents Monday evening.
Lyons outlined the two-fold problem
of safety and operations in the house.
Operational problems ranged from
finding parking spaces to serving food
in the house.
As far as safety is concerned, the old
house is considered, ironically, a fire
hazard. The house would have to have
its zoning changed from a single-family
dwelling to a multiple-resident home.
When the zoning is changed, modern
fire code standards must be met which
the house cannot meet at this time.
Additions such as a new electrical sys
tem. lights over exit doors, new tire
safety doors and alarms, and a new
staircase would all be necessary.
Housing options for spring quarter
were a major part of Monday night's
meeting. The University has put a
freeze on all campus housing assign
ments until the women are placed for
next quarter. Although first round as
signments for campus residences came
out before the fire. Roger Whitney, as
sociate dean of residential education,
explained that a list of housing for the
women has been compiled and ap
pointments will be made this Friday at
3 p.m.
"We have enough spaces for
everyone to room with someone from
Storey on campus," said Whitney.
"The spces consist of two types: those
for two people or more and those with
individual spaces," he added. Some of
the residences mentioned that have
spaces are Escondido Village,
Crothers. Crothers Memorial and
Manzanita Park.
Many of the Storey women are upset
about these options. Most feel that it is
important to stay together on campus
as much as possible. In addition, they
want to be with other people their own
age, rather than graduate students who
have different activities and interests.
The alternative that they suggest is liv
ing in fraternities on campus.
"A lot of the girls want to live in the
fraternities, and I don't think it'sasking
much," said sophomore Joyce Chang,
another Storey resident. "If the frats
say it's fine and if there's room, then
what's wrong?"
The fraternity issue will be decided
this week by the University when the
Storey women submit viable proposals
from the fraternities involved. The
problems ot room assignments and
bathroom facilities must all be met be
fore a decision will be made.
Another option is to use dormitory
guest rooms on campus in which many
of the women are living now. A hold

has been placed on these rooms
through spring quarter, should some of
the women wish to remain.
However, housing isn't the only
problem currently faced by the Storey
residents. Food, insurance policies and
classwork all need to be considered.
Diana Conklin, assistant director of
the Row, has been in charge of Univer
sity programs to help the women.
The cleaning of salvageable clothing
has been sponsored by the University,
Conklin explained. Items are delivered
three times each week to Stern Hall on
campus. "The only thing that they ha
ven't taken to clean was a small box of
stuffed animals â€” everything else has
been sent," said Conklin.
The Storey residents have been din
ing at Roth House since the fire. Today
they will have their own dining room
set up at Lathrop, which will be availa
ble for the rest of the year. University
officials hope that a common dining
room will keep the residents together
to some extent throughout the year.
Early last week, a letter was sent to

all professors who had Storey House
students in their classes, telling them to
"take it easy, excuse deadlines and give
incompletes to the girls tor this quar
ter," said Conklin.
Most professors seem to have been
receptive, although most of the women
plan to finish on time. "There is no time
to do work, hut I want to try to go
through with finals," said Chang. "If
not, I won't go to Mazatlan as I had
planned for spring break, and I'll study
to take my exams afterwards," she ad
ded
Blame for the cause of the fire has
not been placed either with the stu
dents of the house or with the Univer
sity at this time. Firemen are still in
specting the house to see who was at
fault. There is no student University
reimbursement policy, although $100
gilts have been offered to each woman.
If the University is found to have
been negligent in the fire, then insur
ance companies would get the money
back from the University that they
have paid out to the women.
