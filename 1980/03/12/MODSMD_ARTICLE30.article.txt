# What is there for us to believe in?

She looked out the window of her apart
ment on Haight Street and sighed tiredly.
"After awhile I get so sick of it here."
"How can you be sick ot living in San
Francisco? It's a charming city."
"Oh, I know it's charming. You can't live
here more than a week without a million
people telling you how charming it is. That's
part of the problem.
"But after staying here for very long every
thing you used to think was charming seems
either cutesy or foolish or pretentious. Take
the old guy on Market Street who preaches at
everyone passing him during rush hour,
every day.
"At first he's funny to listen to and see, hut
when you've heard him for a month or two
you get tired of having somebody yell at you
all the time. What the hell does he want
anyway, standing there? He never asks for
money. Does he believe in anything? No. He
just wants to bother people.
"When I moved out West everybody told
me to look for a place in the Haight because
it's right in the center of things.
"So here I am and I loved it last year, but
some nights I look out there and get tired of
the pretense. You always see the same type
of people going to the same pseudo-
European bistros to have the same pseudo
intellectual conversations.
"And after two years of living here. I've
had enough of the dog shit on the sidewalks
and the porno shops and the winos at every
corner."
"All right, but don't blame San I rancisco.
That's the way cities are."
"I realize that. The Village is bad and West

J lolly wood's worse. But when you come here
they tell you it's the Paris ot the United
States. Then you find out it's a big. tough city
with a lot of neon lights. What are you sup
posed to believe, anyway?"

I went home for Christmas break, my
home being Los Angeles. It was about as 1
expected, though I haven't spent much time
there in the past two years.
II you go downtown, or to East Hollywood,
you find quiet, sunny streets crowded with
kids playing baseball. You can look around,
see no freeways and get the feeling that
you're in a neighborhood that looks now as it
did 50 years ago.
Then you walk west into the newer, richer
part of the city. Endless roads stretch to
wards the ocean, three lanes each way.
They lead to endless freeways, which glide
interminably out to the endless suburbs. But
why spend all that money simply to gel out to
the suburbs? All they have there are little
homes and shopping centers and cheap park
ing lots.
That lifestyle — the ugly home with two or
three cars and a plastic pool in the backyard
— seems so alien now, but that doesn't stop
the developers from opening a new subdivi
sion every week.
Each day the skies get browner and the
freeways more crowded, while we are being
told that if we don't start conserving energy
now it will soon mean war. But the lifestyle
lurches on in its own sloth-like way.
Is this what I am supposed to believe in. a

standard of living and a kind of life that
crawls around like a dinosaur ready to de
stroy everything in its path before surrender
ing to extinction?

l ast week I watched television with some
friends and saw the returns from some presi
dential primary. One candidate's victory
party — I don't remember which one — was
crowded with students about our age.

A few ol them held signs proclaiming.
"You've (iot To Believe."
We laughed at that. It seemed a little out ot
place in 1980. a hit anachronistic: it seemed
like the expression ol a kind of commitment
that we thought had ebbed awaj several
years ago, it we had ever known it at all. It
seemed too easy. But at the same time we
envied them.

l ast week I watched television with some
friends and saw the returns from some presi
dential primary. One candidate's victory
party — I don't remember which one — was
crowded with students about our age.

A few ol them held signs proclaiming.
"You've (iot To Believe."
We laughed at that. It seemed a little out ot
place in 1980. a hit anachronistic: it seemed
like the expression ol a kind of commitment
that we thought had ebbed awaj several
years ago, it we had ever known it at all. It
seemed too easy. But at the same time we
envied them.

She looked out the window of her apart
ment on Haight Street and sighed tiredly.
"After awhile I get so sick of it here."
"How can you be sick ot living in San
Francisco? It's a charming city."
"Oh, I know it's charming. You can't live
here more than a week without a million
people telling you how charming it is. That's
part of the problem.
"But after staying here for very long every
thing you used to think was charming seems
either cutesy or foolish or pretentious. Take
the old guy on Market Street who preaches at
everyone passing him during rush hour,
every day.
"At first he's funny to listen to and see, hut
when you've heard him for a month or two
you get tired of having somebody yell at you
all the time. What the hell does he want
anyway, standing there? He never asks for
money. Does he believe in anything? No. He
just wants to bother people.
"When I moved out West everybody told
me to look for a place in the Haight because
it's right in the center of things.
"So here I am and I loved it last year, but
some nights I look out there and get tired of
the pretense. You always see the same type
of people going to the same pseudo-
European bistros to have the same pseudo
intellectual conversations.
"And after two years of living here. I've
had enough of the dog shit on the sidewalks
and the porno shops and the winos at every
corner."
"All right, but don't blame San I rancisco.
That's the way cities are."
"I realize that. The Village is bad and West

J lolly wood's worse. But when you come here
they tell you it's the Paris ot the United
States. Then you find out it's a big. tough city
with a lot of neon lights. What are you sup
posed to believe, anyway?"

I went home for Christmas break, my
home being Los Angeles. It was about as 1
expected, though I haven't spent much time
there in the past two years.
II you go downtown, or to East Hollywood,
you find quiet, sunny streets crowded with
kids playing baseball. You can look around,
see no freeways and get the feeling that
you're in a neighborhood that looks now as it
did 50 years ago.
Then you walk west into the newer, richer
part of the city. Endless roads stretch to
wards the ocean, three lanes each way.
They lead to endless freeways, which glide
interminably out to the endless suburbs. But
why spend all that money simply to gel out to
the suburbs? All they have there are little
homes and shopping centers and cheap park
ing lots.
That lifestyle — the ugly home with two or
three cars and a plastic pool in the backyard
— seems so alien now, but that doesn't stop
the developers from opening a new subdivi
sion every week.
Each day the skies get browner and the
freeways more crowded, while we are being
told that if we don't start conserving energy
now it will soon mean war. But the lifestyle
lurches on in its own sloth-like way.
Is this what I am supposed to believe in. a

standard of living and a kind of life that
crawls around like a dinosaur ready to de
