Chaparral's purpose
Seth Zuckerman, in his review
of the latest Chaparral (Daily,
March 6), ponders the problema
tic question of the "very purpose
and function of campus satire
magazines."
Well Zuckerman, the Chapar
ral exists as an alternative to the
pseudo-intellectual, pseudo
political, look-middle-class-ma
— there's-an-alternative-to-
Keynes, freshman dorm rambl
ings of certain barefooted doc
trinaires.

Pizza jokes
Daily Editor Bill Burger's
note on "Jokes for Pizza" (Daily,
March 7) failed to address a few
salient points that would have
clarified the Pizzeria's relation
ship to the column "Jokes for
Pizza."
The management of La Piz
zeria has never participated in
the selection of the jokes and in
accordance with Daily policy,
does not screen the jokes submit
ted.
We all agree that the jokes
have been in poor taste and ex
pect in the light of recent letters
the quality of jokes will be
greatly improved.

Gov't control needed
Scott Olmstead (Daily, Feb.
26) argued against price con
trols, describing them as "im
moral" acts of violence perpet
rated by government against free
enterprise.
However in the United States,
we do not have free enterprise.
Rather we have, in most cases,
oligopolistic enterprise. Today,
the top 100 corporations own 5K
percent of America's industrial
assets, and the removal of gov
ernment controls would merely
end the last check on the power
of those few corporations.
Thus, while price controls are
impractical and rather irrelev
ant, wc do need government to
limit business excesses, for
example in the form of pollution
or excessive disparity of income
— excesses that are inherent in
our corporate structure.
As for the question of moral
ity, it is not the pseudo-violence
of civilization, in the form of
government, that is immoral, but
rather the deprivation of the

poor that would result from the
absence of government, which is
an evil. Greed, and not state
power, is the wrong.

Support ASSU bid
The ASSU is planning to make
a bid to run the Coffee House,
and I think this should be sup
ported by the Stanford student
body.
If the Coffee House were
student-run, there could and
probably would be increased
operating hours to meet student
need or demand for such. Pizza
Express wouldn't be the only
way to alleviate late night hunger
pangs.
The Coffee Hosuc could also
be run in a more attractive man
ner (cheaper prices, more eon
genial atmosphere, etc.)so that it
would become more ol a social
gathering place for University
students.
These are only a few ol the
changes that could be made if the
Coffee House were student-run.
and they would attract more stu
dents to the Coffee House to eat,
drink and socialize.

Unionize secretaries
Although I applaud Dr. Michael
Eliastam's comments (Daily,
March 3) on salary remuneration
for secretaries, he fails to explain
why and how the supervisor
secretary relationship would be
upset if clericals unionized.
If Eliastam is speaking about
the everyday ties between a cler
ical and her boss, a secretary's
action in supporting unionizing
efforts has nothing todo with the
speed and accuracy of her typing,
doing elasswork for the professor
as promptly as possible, or mak
ing correct airline reservations
lor his out-of-town meetings.
By the same token, it does not
preclude her laughing at his
jokes, accepting a martini after 5
p.m. after a hard week for the
both of them, or telling him
about her daughter's graduation
from high school.
It docs not mean that sec
retaries are anticipating being
worth $30.000 each. After all.
this country is not living through
the worst years ol the Weimar
Republic — yet.

The secretary supporting un
ionization tiicitl> acknowedges
that she has no argument with
her hoss. Her boss should not
leel threatened.
The secretary knows that the
higher-ups. the powers-tluit-are
in the University, the ones who
hold the purse strings, the ones
who would rather refurbish
buildings than reward their cleri
cals for faithful and diligent
work, are the ones who cannot
be asked politely or he expected
to do what is right and proper for
clericals ;it the University.
l ast summer, the University
gave clericals a two percent
cost-of-living increase. In addi
tion. we may have free dental
care for us and our dependents
starting this year.
All well and good. But these
actions did not come without
secretaries discussing their situa
tion. raising their voices above a
whisper and signing blue cards.
We have not gone far enough,
though the University has had
plenty ol time to redress our
grievances.
This struggle goes beyond
salaries. It involves promotions,
pensions and security.
I or most o! us, Stanford is our
career, we want to stay here and
work.
But we who support the un
ionization of the clerical force are
tired of waiting for the University
to respect and realize our value
and worth. There is no mistake,
no "terrible" error in grabbing
that responsibility lor ourselves
and making ourselves heard in
numbers and strength.

Events tape weak
Have you ever tried to get in
formation about events at the
University by dialing 497-0336?
If you have, all you probably
heard was a weak voice with a lot
of noise in the background.
Whenever I dial this number,
all I hear is a recorded message
that sounds terrible. The person
recording the message can
hardly pronounce the words, and
usually we end up hearing a weak
and unclear voice.
I'm not asking for a nice sexy
voice, but the least that can be
done is to record a loud and clear
message that is pleasant to hear.

Reagan is quotable
With the exception of Ab
raham Lincoln. Republicans
have difficulty finding a quotable
president. Who would want to
reproduce the rambling sen
tences of Dwight Eisenhower or
the"I am not a crook"
philosophy of Richard Nixon?
If Ronald Reagan becomes
president this problem will be
solved — for example, "When
you've seen one redwood you've
seen them all," or "How do you
tell the Pole at the cockfight?" or
"Taxes should hurt." The last
was offered shortly before the
revelation that Reagan had not
paid California income tax for
the two previous years.
It is difficult to understand
Reagan's popularity except for
the need for a quotable source.

Review questioned
Upon reading Ron Lillejord's
review of the Clash's Saturday
concert (Daily, March 4),
we were immediately convinced
that he must not have seen the
same show.
l or many reasons, we feel this
reviewer's claims about the show
to be unsubstantiated to the
point of absurdity. The re
viewer's competence is im
mediately placed in question
when he stated that Mickey
Dread's opening act "echoed
badly over the extremely loud
speaker system" when in fact the
"echo" was deliberate use of a
simple delay-reverb unit.
Mis incompetence is con
tinued when he mistakes
"Jimmy Jaz/" for a blues
number (if anything it's Reg
gae), and when lie accuses
lead singer Joe
Strummer ol "playing vocal
games that interest no one but
himself when in fact the entire
packed floor of the theater was
dancing wildly.
In fact the reviewer's appreci
ation of any form of Reggae
whatsoever appears to be non
existent. as seen in his labeling of
"sucked" to every Reggae song
played.
The long list ol songs he con
demned is made ridiculous when
he praises Strummer for great
vocals on "London Calling." a
song in which Strummer practi
cally lost his voice.
If the Clash's attitude Satur
day night was "bothersome" to

the reviewer, it was probably be
cause of the fact that they played
a bitingly. anarchistic political
statement with no pretensions of
the elitism that Lillcjord accuses
them of.
Ol course the Clash has dealt
with the corporations. It is the
only way to reach an audience.
One glance at the Clash's lyrics
will convince any moderately
aware reader of its integrity.
Overall, we feel the review
was a critical and musical sham
and regret that such a great per
formance should be slandered so
unthinkingly.

Note: Whether you cull it echo
or delay-reverb, it's still echo. To
call ' Jimmy Jazz" a Reggae
number is to use an incredibly
broad definition oj Reggae. I was
in the fifili row and I didn't see
people dancing wildly while
Strummer mumbled, "/, z, zed,
zed, ..." at the end of'Jimmv
Jazz."
I appreciate Reggae; the Clash
produced very good Reggae on
their studio albums (particularly
Police and Thieves;, but they
rushed the tempo of their Reggae
numbers in concert and Strum
mer just didn 't produce very good
vocals on the Reggae numbers
live.
112 inally, it's difficult for me to
believe that anyone could call the
Clash "anarchistic" anymore. I)
they're anarchistic, it's a damn
impure variety.
The point of the review was that
the Clash lias made, and con
tinues to make a number of com
promises, and no amount of pos
ing can hide that. A true anarchist
would tell the system to piss off
The Clash is doing anything but
that.

More on Shockley
I was both delighted and dis
appointed to hear about Stan
ford Prof. William
Shockley's donation to a sperm
bank for Nobel scientists (Daily,
March 4). I was disappointed be
cause not only Shockley, but two
other Nobel laureates have sup
ported through their actions an
incredible form of pretentious
pseudoscience.
Any graduate of biology or
psychology knows that there is
no evidence whatsoever to sup

port the claim that big Poindex
ters may produce at will baby
Poindexters.
!t seems as though ideology is.
once again, making great leaps
from a meager or non-existent
base of scientific evidence.
What's worse. Shockley's ideol
ogy is a very regressive one. with
great potential for societal mis
use.
However, it is comforting to
realize that, because of
Shockley's actions, we can now
positively state that the old
nugget of folk wisdom," Mastur
bation makes one crazy" really is
true!

Replace Wordscape
It certainly is wonderful that
our beloved University has the

chance to expose us to artwork
that "appeals to just about
everyone." We are of course re
ferring to our new "Wordscape"
hanging in the Green Library
stairwell.
Similar tapestries hang in
banks, corporate offices and
museums around the world. But
il we wanted universal appeal,
we believe that a better alterna
tive was overlooked.
Surely everyone will agree
that a spanking new Mercedes-
Ben/ is ;i work of art. For the
$24.00(1 paid for the Wordscape.
we could have had a new 450 SI.
hanging to adorn our new library
addition/Similar cars are parked
at banks, corporate offices and
museums around the globe.
The hooks are already on the
wall. Is il too late for a trade-in?
