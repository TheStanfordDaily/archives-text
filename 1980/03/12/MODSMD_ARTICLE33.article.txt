# Apathy afflicts Guest Professorship Board
## 
### Jiri Weiss Staff Writer 
II you have wondered what has happened to vour
SI lee assessment lor the ASSU Guest Professorship
Board from last spring, it is sitting in an ASSU
interest-earning fund. There is not going to be an
ASSU guest professor this year because there is not
even a committee to recommend one.
The Guest Professorship Board rev iews proposals
lor the binding ot visitors to teach courses that must
be accredited by a department, or as most often hap
pens. by one of the special academic programs such as
SWOPSI or SCIRE. The board then makes a recom
mendation to the ASSU Senate, which makes the
linal decision. All of this happens if all goes well.
Lately it has not.
According to Sibby freeman, a Council of Presi
dents member and head of the ASSU Nominating
Committee, there simply was not enough interest
among students to serve on the committee that has in
the past invited such personalities as Angela Davis
and Daniel Ellsberg to teach here.

Only three members out of five were appointed by
the nominating committee last spring and all of these
resigned this tall. According to Freeman, the job was
a little more challenging and time-consuming than
they were willing to handle. The committee needs to
work on its own initiative he added, si nee there are no
guidelines at present.
Not the first time
This is not the first time that there has been no
guest professor, according to Laura Selznick. the di
rector ot the Undergraduate Specials program.
Sel/nick, helps the committee get through the red
tape required lor a non-University course to be
accredited. Since the board's inception in the '60s,
guest professors have been coming here only sporadi
cally. she said, attributing this to student apathy.
"It is too bad that students did not get what they
paid for." said Sel/nick. referring to this year's lapse.
"Extradepartmental programs are uncompensated.
It is difficult to encourage qualified people to teach
with no salary. With SI 0.000 you can dcTquite a lot."
Last spring the board spent about $N. 500 on two

guest professors, Ellsberg and native American
leader, Dennis Banks.
The committee is currently composed of only one
member who took over in the middle of this quarter.
I le is Neal MacFarquhar, a sophomore who hopes to
be able to devote more time to the job this spring.
Zapata proposal
The one-man committee has not been entirely
without proposals, however. Last week Casa Zapata
submitted a proposal to fund a guest Chicano artist,
Malaquias Montoya. who will be teachingsilk screen
ing through SWOPSI. According to Frank Garcia,
the resident fellow at Zapata, the proposal was pas
sed around from Freeman to COP member Tom Gart
to MacFarquhar. In spite of all the confusion, Garcia
thinks that he stands a good chance of acquiring at
least some money from the ASSU.
"I don't see any reason why the ASSU Senate
cannot act affirmatively on the Casa Zapata prop
osal.' said hreeman. "In the future the committee is
going to have to expand its vision," he added. There is
a definite need for some guidelines to be drawn up
and for more publicity, he said.
