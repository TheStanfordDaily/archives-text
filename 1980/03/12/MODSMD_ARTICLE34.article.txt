# Wilbur attack not by Terrace rapist
## 
### Rose Chan Staff Writer 
The composite sketch ot the attacker
in the assault at Wilbur Hall in
February looks much like the College
Terrace rapist, but police are almost
certain that the two incidents are unre
lated, said Detective Raul Niemeyerol
the Stanford Police Department.
"I don't think there's much ot a con
nection at all. I think our guv is too set
in his methods to change radically,"
said Sgt. Mike Meloy of the Palo Alto
Police Department. "There's really no
reason for him to change."
"The attack at Wilbur was so unpre
cedented." said Nienieyer.
The victim remembers her attacker's
face as being much fatter than in the
College Terrace rapist's composite
sketch. Niemeyer said. The man is said
to be five feet eight inches tall, 25 to 30
years old with short, straight brown
hair. Wearing a green canvas raincoat,
he made his attack outside of Rin
conada, Wilbur Hall at 7:30 p.m. on
Feb. 19. The victim suffered scratches
and bruises but was able to run into the
dorm before being harmed further.
Later that night, a man resembling
the sketch of the College Terrace rapist
was detained, then released when the
victim was unable to identify him in the
police line-up. After being stopped
several other times by the police, this
look-alike has now been completely
cleared. Niemeyer said.

The police do have a possible suspect
hut have not been able to locate him,
added Nienieyer. They are now trying
to obtain photos of the man from
another state.
Meloy said that in spite of numerous
leads on the College Terrace rapist, the
police have not come up with a "work
able suspect." The College Terrace
rapist is credited for four attacks in
1979 and seven others between 1971
and 1970. the latest heing in early
November.
The suspect is believed to be a white
male in his late 20s with neatly cut dark
hair, about five feet seven inches tall
and weighing 155 to 170 pounds.
Police also believe that the suspect lives
in the College Terrace area.
Meanwhile, the Palo Alto police
have continued investigations on the
Medical Center theft which took place
on Feb. 6. 1 our small computer circuit
boards worth $17,000 were taken from
the brain scanner. Palo Alto Police Of
ficer Terry Moore said the police are
following a couple of good leads, but
declined to give any further comment.
Another recent problem is a hu/zing
plane that reportedly has been flying
dangerously close to campus after 1 1
p.m. Niemeyer said that no further in
formation has been obtained. 1 le said it
is difficult to identify the plane at night
or to tell its direction, hut encouraged
any persons who spot the plane to call
the police immediately.
