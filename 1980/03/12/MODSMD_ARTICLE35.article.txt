# New priority system clarifies Draw
## 
### Hillary Hall Staff Writer 
This spring when Housing Draw
cards come out and the annual house
to-house parade lor priorities begins,
students will find that the once
complicated Draw procedure has now
been partially clarified by a new prior
ity system.
Last year, the individual row and
theme houses set up their own policies,
usually giving special priorities to eat
ing associates or to students enrolled in
house-related seminars or classes, with
lesser priority allotted to students who
visited the house and helped cook or
clean or who attended a house (unc
tion. Students who entered the Draw
with priority at a particular residence
had a better chance of getting into that
residence than students with lesser
priority or with no priority at all.
This year, as in every year, the Resi
dence Subcommittee of the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS-R) re
viewed Draw procedures and policies.
The group concluded this year that the
priority systems ol individual houses
and dorms were contusing and often
inequitable.
Assistant Dean for Residential Edu
cation. Rouer Whitney, said that

"there was a need to reassess the
philosophy behind a priority system."
I he committee recommended lour
changes in the priority process:
that the number of priority
categories be limited to two:
that only one priority may require
visiting the house and. further, that
more than two visits should be required
for the priority;
— that no eating associate priority
should be allowed;
that the returning resident prior
ity should not be granted to students
seeking housing in their non
guaranteed year.
According to the committee's re
port, the first two alterations are in
tended to clarify the confusing proce
dure ol obtaining priorities through
multiple visits to houses and dorms.
The other changes are meant to make
priorities more objective and to put
them within reach of all students.
Whitney said that in past years, the
priority system discriminated in tavor
of eating associates, to the disadvan
tage of students liv ing in dorms who are
required to purchase food service meal
plans. The committee concluded that
eating-associate priorities are unfair
because "it was unattainable without
considerable expense to those who

must purchase University meal plans,
the report said.
Claudia Baler, housing associate
(R.A.) at Phi Psi House, a
cooperatively-run row house that is af
fected by the new priority policy, said,
"the new policy toward eating as
sociates is itself unfair in that, without
warning, it has pulled the rug out from
under current eating associates and has
forced the co-ops and theme houses to
go hack on their prior commitments to
eating associates."
" Co-ops need eating associates to fill
out their cook crews and to make sure
that necessary house jobs get done, she
added, and the theme houses also need
eating associates to establish and main
tain active interest and participation in
the houses and their themes.
Baler said she objected "only to the
abruptness of the decision and to the
fact that the houses most affected were
not notified about any policy changes
until it was too late to petition for a
suspension of the decision until next
year.
COSS-R is right," she said, "in that
eating associate priority is unfair, but
they should have given us a year's
warning so that we wouldn't have to
relinquish our commitment to the cur
rent eating associates."
In its report, COSS-R affirmed the
principle that "the purpose of the
priorities is to educate prospective and
current residents about the lifestyle
and requirements associated with par
ticular dorms or houses."
Associate Dean Whitney said lie
supports the COSS-R recommenda
tions. agreeing that "priorities need to
be both objective and educational in
nature — that any student entering the
Draw should have access to equal
priority."
The fourth recommended change
concerns the returning resident priority
which, Whitney said, "has kept some
students out of the housing system." It
was felt that non-guaranteed returning
residents were often obtaining housing
before students with guarantees.
As a result, the new policy narrows
the definition of the returning residents
with housing guarantees. The commit
tee report expressed the hope that this
alteration, along with the three others,
will eliminate the impression of unfair
ness among students regarding guaran
tees and priorities.

"the new policy toward eating as
sociates is itself unfair in that, without
warning, it has pulled the rug out from
under current eating associates and has
forced the co-ops and theme houses to
go hack on their prior commitments to
eating associates."
" Co-ops need eating associates to fill
out their cook crews and to make sure
that necessary house jobs get done, she
added, and the theme houses also need
eating associates to establish and main
tain active interest and participation in
the houses and their themes.
Baler said she objected "only to the
abruptness of the decision and to the
fact that the houses most affected were
not notified about any policy changes
until it was too late to petition for a
suspension of the decision until next
year.
COSS-R is right," she said, "in that
eating associate priority is unfair, but
they should have given us a year's
warning so that we wouldn't have to
relinquish our commitment to the cur
rent eating associates."
In its report, COSS-R affirmed the
principle that "the purpose of the
priorities is to educate prospective and
current residents about the lifestyle
and requirements associated with par
ticular dorms or houses."
Associate Dean Whitney said lie
supports the COSS-R recommenda
tions. agreeing that "priorities need to
be both objective and educational in
nature — that any student entering the
Draw should have access to equal
priority."
The fourth recommended change
concerns the returning resident priority
which, Whitney said, "has kept some
students out of the housing system." It
was felt that non-guaranteed returning
residents were often obtaining housing
before students with guarantees.
As a result, the new policy narrows
the definition of the returning residents
with housing guarantees. The commit
tee report expressed the hope that this
alteration, along with the three others,
will eliminate the impression of unfair
ness among students regarding guaran
tees and priorities.
This spring when Housing Draw
cards come out and the annual house
to-house parade lor priorities begins,
students will find that the once
complicated Draw procedure has now
been partially clarified by a new prior
ity system.
Last year, the individual row and
theme houses set up their own policies,
usually giving special priorities to eat
ing associates or to students enrolled in
house-related seminars or classes, with
lesser priority allotted to students who
visited the house and helped cook or
clean or who attended a house (unc
tion. Students who entered the Draw
with priority at a particular residence
had a better chance of getting into that
residence than students with lesser
priority or with no priority at all.
This year, as in every year, the Resi
dence Subcommittee of the Committee
on Services to Students (COSS-R) re
viewed Draw procedures and policies.
The group concluded this year that the
priority systems ol individual houses
and dorms were contusing and often
inequitable.
Assistant Dean for Residential Edu
cation. Rouer Whitney, said that

"there was a need to reassess the
philosophy behind a priority system."
I he committee recommended lour
changes in the priority process:
that the number of priority
categories be limited to two:
that only one priority may require
visiting the house and. further, that
more than two visits should be required
for the priority;
— that no eating associate priority
should be allowed;
that the returning resident prior
ity should not be granted to students
seeking housing in their non
guaranteed year.
According to the committee's re
port, the first two alterations are in
tended to clarify the confusing proce
dure ol obtaining priorities through
multiple visits to houses and dorms.
The other changes are meant to make
priorities more objective and to put
them within reach of all students.
Whitney said that in past years, the
priority system discriminated in tavor
of eating associates, to the disadvan
tage of students liv ing in dorms who are
required to purchase food service meal
plans. The committee concluded that
eating-associate priorities are unfair
because "it was unattainable without
considerable expense to those who

must purchase University meal plans,
the report said.
Claudia Baler, housing associate
(R.A.) at Phi Psi House, a
cooperatively-run row house that is af
fected by the new priority policy, said,
"the new policy toward eating as
sociates is itself unfair in that, without
warning, it has pulled the rug out from
