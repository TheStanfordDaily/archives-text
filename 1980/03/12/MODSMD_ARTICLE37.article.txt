## 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
Sparked by the enthusiasm that fol
lowed Rep. John Anderson's strong
second-place showings in the Mas
sachusetts and Vermont primaries,
more than 90 students here attended
the organizational meeting last Thurs
day of the Stanford Committee tor An
derson.
The gathering at the Mitchell Earth
Sciences Building followed on the heels
ot the March 4 primaries, in which the
l()-term Republican congressman
from Illinois tirst emerged as a major
candidate by coming within a percen
tage point of beating both front-runner
Ronald Reagan in Vermont and
George Bush in Massachusetts.
"I'm excited that 120 people have
signed up for the committee in such a
short time," commented organizer
Robin Millington, a senior in political
science and communication. "Many
people showed interest before the
primaries, so we're not just riding the
waves of (near) victory."
Another organizer. Jim Esserman. a
graduate student in operations re
search. said Anderson's image of being
the non-electable candidate, despite Ins
qualifications, "is getting shattered."
In the course of the evening, sub
committees were formed on fund
raising, information/issues, publicity,
voter registration and faculty support.
A steering committee is being formed
of representatives from each subcom
mittee.
"The first priority is to get people to
register as Republicans by the May 5
deadline, so they can vote in the
California primary on June 3," said
Alan Bromberger, field director for the
Northern California Committee for
Anderson, which opened its headquar
ters in Oakland last week.
"We have to win in California if An
derson is to be nominated," he said,
explaining that the delegation of 168 is
the Republican's largest, constituting
16 percent of the number necessary lor
nomination.
"It he wins here and in Illinois, and
does okay in Wisconsin, he'll be a
major force at the national conven
tion," added Bromberger. " If this hap
pens. at least the issues will come out
and we'll see where the others stand."
Bromberger described the campaign
as "a diverse coalition of concerned
people," drawn to Anderson because
"he is the only candidate who's talking
seriously about the issues."
In addition, Bromberger emphati
cally urged supporters to attend the
semi-annual California Republican
Party Convention this weekend at the
Le Baron Motel in San Jose. "A straw
poll will be taken, and a tremendous
number of the 1200 delegates are un
decided . . . we"have to show we're not
afraid to campaign in Reagan's bac
kyard," he said.
Bromberger said Anderson will
probably appear at Stanford during his
visit to the Bay area, between April
7-9.
Geoff Baskir, Santa Clara County
coordinator for the campaign and a

Stanford Alumnus, called the meeting
to seek student support, unaware that a
sizeable student group was already
torming. He said he hopes the commit
tee will help in the canvassing effort
off-campus.
Stephen Stedman, research assistant
in the political science department,
suggested a group research project for
academic credit to determine the pro
cedures in each state for a third party
candidate to qualify for the ballot, in
case the Republicans do not nominate
Anderson.
Political Science Prof. Robert
Keohane attended the meeting and
commented afterwards, "Anderson's
plan for a 50 cents per gallon gas tax,
rebated through the Social Security sys
tem, is the best new public policy prop
osal I've seen in a long time."
Keohane said he's been aware of
Anderson's "sense of character" for
years, because Anderson was his con
gressman when he lived in Illinois.
Although lie's never voted Republi
can before, Keohane said, "I've been
dissatisfied with Carter and Kennedy,
while Anderson is making a lot more
sense, especially on energy issues." He
doubts, however, that Anderson will be
nominated, "because the Republican
party is not hospitable" to one who
speaks out liberally on issues.
Millington said Anderson "is very
progressive on many pressing social is
sues," while another member, sopho
more Nina Bohlen, said, "He's a fiscal
conservative, who supports a budget
that's tied to annual GNP growth."
These differences "make him hard to
categorize," added Bohlen.
