Libertarian presidential candidate
Ed Clark said Friday the draft is "the
most important civil liberties issue
there is."
Before a noontime White Plaza
crowd ol approximately 300, Clark
harshly criticized President Jimmy Car
ter's call tor the renewal of registration
for l<S-;md 19-year-olds, saying"there
aren't two issues — registration and the

draft — there's just one and that't the
draft. Because there's no possible need
for registration without the draft."
"In my view, the draft is primarily a
civil liberties question. It's a question
of whether people will be allowed to
live their lives peacefully in the way
they want," Clark said, lie explained
the basic libertarian philosophy that
individuals have the right to live their
own lives so long as they don't hurt or
offend others or take something away
from others that they deserve to keep.
"Anybody who abhors denials of in
dividual freedoms should hate the draft
with a passion," Clark said. "It's an
ethical issue on which all ethical people
should take a strong position."
To intermittant applause, Clark chal
lenged the claims of the critics of the
All Volunteer Forces (AVF).
In response to the criticism that the
educational level of the AVI isn't high
enough. Clark said. "Actually, the
educational level in the armed forces is
higher today than when we had con
scription in the Vietnam War. That's a
phony issue."
Clark advocated paying service vol
unteers market wages instead of resort
ing to'Torced labor" to fill the ranks of
the AVF. "It you need more people in
the armed services, and 1 don't think
we do today, the way to get them is to
pay market wages," he said. "We don't
draft policemen or firemen or lawyers
or doctors or students. We shouldn't
draft people for the armed services.
"Another argument is that there are
too many minority people in the armed
services, and this is something bad. It
you look at a group that doesn't think
that's wrong," Clark said, "look at .ill
the black congressmen in Washington.
They are all firmly, universally op
posed to the draft, and they're all in
favor of the voluntary army."
Clark quoted former Health, Educa
tion and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano as calling the AVF "un-
American. that it offends fundamental
American values. I don't know what his
(Califano's) values are, but I always
thought the fundamental American
value was individual freedom.
After a brief overview of the history
of war and the draft. Clark claimed the
result of the peacetime draft instituted
after World War II was to lead us to
Vietnam.

"There was no possible way to tight
the war in Vietnam with a voluntary
torce. People are not going to give up
their lives unless they think something
very vital is at stake — their own
tamilies. their own cities, their own
towns. Those kind ol things that tend to
make people want to enlist in the
armed services where there's a chance
they're going to get killed. It takes a
very strong impetus to do it." Clark
said.
Turning to the domestic issues re
lated to the draft. Clark criticized Car
ter tor reversing his position on the
question. Carter, who opposed the
draft up until his call for registration,
used the return of Selective Service to
improve his ratings in the polls. Clark
said.
"(The draft) has nothing to do with
Iran and Afghanistan." Clark asserted.
" But it's going to help Jininiv Carter 111
the trouble areas that are really impor
tant to him — the democratic primaries
in Illinois and Florida."
Clark also attacked fellow candidate
Ted Kennedy's switch on the issue
from pro-draft to anti-draft.
"Teddy Kennedy was a hard-core
supporter of the draft (when the AYT
was instituted in the early '70s). He
thought it was good for people, it built
their character. And now ins politics
tell him that he needs the support ol
younger people, so he has come out
against the draft.
"I think these two changes of leading
figures of the majority party . . . indi
cate that it a movement is going to be
built against the draft, it can't he built
by establishment parties," Clark said.
The anti-war movement ol the '60s
didn't go far enough. Clark said. "The
draft stopped, the war stopped: but the
same foreign policy — that always pro
duces calls for the draft — continued.
We're still spending half our 'defense'
budget supporting American troops
overseas."
Clark said we shouldn't "sub sidi/e"
the dele use ol Japan, and that the
world wars proved Germans could de
fend themselves.
"We ought to reduce our taxes,"
Clark said. "We can do that if we take
our troops home."
Rather than just a light against the
dratt, Clark advocates a movement
