Libertarian presidential candidate
Ed Clark said Friday the draft is "the
most important civil liberties issue
there is."
Before a noontime White Plaza
crowd ol approximately 300, Clark
harshly criticized President Jimmy Car
ter's call tor the renewal of registration
for l<S-;md 19-year-olds, saying"there
aren't two issues — registration and the

draft — there's just one and that't the
draft. Because there's no possible need
for registration without the draft."
"In my view, the draft is primarily a
civil liberties question. It's a question
of whether people will be allowed to
live their lives peacefully in the way
they want," Clark said, lie explained
the basic libertarian philosophy that
individuals have the right to live their
own lives so long as they don't hurt or
offend others or take something away
from others that they deserve to keep.
"Anybody who abhors denials of in
dividual freedoms should hate the draft
with a passion," Clark said. "It's an
ethical issue on which all ethical people
should take a strong position."
To intermittant applause, Clark chal
lenged the claims of the critics of the
All Volunteer Forces (AVF).
In response to the criticism that the
educational level of the AVI isn't high
enough. Clark said. "Actually, the
educational level in the armed forces is
higher today than when we had con
scription in the Vietnam War. That's a
phony issue."
Clark advocated paying service vol
unteers market wages instead of resort
ing to'Torced labor" to fill the ranks of
the AVF. "It you need more people in
the armed services, and 1 don't think
we do today, the way to get them is to
pay market wages," he said. "We don't
draft policemen or firemen or lawyers
or doctors or students. We shouldn't
draft people for the armed services.
"Another argument is that there are
too many minority people in the armed
services, and this is something bad. It
you look at a group that doesn't think
that's wrong," Clark said, "look at .ill
the black congressmen in Washington.
They are all firmly, universally op
posed to the draft, and they're all in
favor of the voluntary army."
Clark quoted former Health, Educa
tion and Welfare Secretary Joseph
Califano as calling the AVF "un-
American. that it offends fundamental
American values. I don't know what his
(Califano's) values are, but I always
thought the fundamental American
value was individual freedom.
After a brief overview of the history
of war and the draft. Clark claimed the
result of the peacetime draft instituted
after World War II was to lead us to
Vietnam.

"There was no possible way to tight
the war in Vietnam with a voluntary
torce. People are not going to give up
their lives unless they think something
very vital is at stake — their own
tamilies. their own cities, their own
towns. Those kind ol things that tend to
make people want to enlist in the
armed services where there's a chance
they're going to get killed. It takes a
very strong impetus to do it." Clark
said.
Turning to the domestic issues re
lated to the draft. Clark criticized Car
ter tor reversing his position on the
question. Carter, who opposed the
draft up until his call for registration,
used the return of Selective Service to
improve his ratings in the polls. Clark
said.
"(The draft) has nothing to do with
Iran and Afghanistan." Clark asserted.
" But it's going to help Jininiv Carter 111
the trouble areas that are really impor
tant to him — the democratic primaries
in Illinois and Florida."
Clark also attacked fellow candidate
Ted Kennedy's switch on the issue
from pro-draft to anti-draft.
"Teddy Kennedy was a hard-core
supporter of the draft (when the AYT
was instituted in the early '70s). He
thought it was good for people, it built
their character. And now ins politics
tell him that he needs the support ol
younger people, so he has come out
against the draft.
"I think these two changes of leading
figures of the majority party . . . indi
cate that it a movement is going to be
built against the draft, it can't he built
by establishment parties," Clark said.
The anti-war movement ol the '60s
didn't go far enough. Clark said. "The
draft stopped, the war stopped: but the
same foreign policy — that always pro
duces calls for the draft — continued.
We're still spending half our 'defense'
budget supporting American troops
overseas."
Clark said we shouldn't "sub sidi/e"
the dele use ol Japan, and that the
world wars proved Germans could de
fend themselves.
"We ought to reduce our taxes,"
Clark said. "We can do that if we take
our troops home."
Rather than just a light against the
dratt, Clark advocates a movement


Ed Clark
against this "other
manifestation ol government
power: the support ol huge
military establishments overseas
in a criss-cross ol alliances that
involve us in almost every
foreign quarrel."
This movement against gov
ernment power is the "most im
portant aspect of the whole
l9S()s." Clark said.
In concluding Ins speech.
Clark said the draft is something
we should all resist. "We must
stop it before it starts, so we can
get back to the serious business
ol living our own li\es."
In responding to questions
from the crowd after the speech,
Clark defended the free market

system with minimal govern
ment interference, pointing to
the successful economy and high
standard ol living in Hong Kong
as an example of what a free
market can achieve.
lie also supported deregula
tion ol oil prices in order to bring
U.S. prices in line with the rest of
the world, resulting in more con
servation and production dltorts
in this country.
Clark said nuclear energy has
been "force-led" to America he
lore the technology was ready,
and that the industry should
therefore take lull responsibility
lor it and he entirely liable lor
any accidents.
I inally, Clark addressed the
need lor an improvement in the

national education, saving the
public schools "are a system to
make everybody just like us
middle-class people." I le said he
advocated a $1200 tax credit lor
parents ol children enrolled in
private schools in order to allow
more choices in education.
In an interview earlier. Clark
listed inflation as well as the dralt
as the two major issues currently
lacing the country. Clark said
that he strongly supported the
federal taxpayers' union prop
osal lor a constitutional conven
tion to ratify an amendment to
balance the federal budget.
To balance the budget, Clark
proposes "massive cuts in milit
ary spending, 112 ederal subsidies to
bus.ness and agriculture and
some welfare cuts."
Clark said he was against the

minimum wage because "in my
\ iew it is a device to keep unskil
led labor oil the market. It's a
program that works against the
poorest people in society."
Employers are less inclined to
hire young and unskilled people
now than they were when the
wage was lower.
"Today, American un
employment is at X percent.
Anglo youth unemployment is at
16 percent and minority youth
employment is at 35 percent.
Iliat s a direct result of the in
creases in the minimum wage.
It's vicious legislation," Clark
said.
Elimination of the minimum
wage would be part ol a massive
cut in federal regulation prop
osed by Clark, ranging from the
trucking industry to medicine.
