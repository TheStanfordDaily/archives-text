# Student-run Coffee House would lower prices
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
An ASSLJ task force will submita bid proposal to
the Tresidder Union Board today to compete for
management of the Coffee House when the cur
rent contract expires.
If the task force's proposal is accepted, the
Coffee House will be owned and managed by
students beginning in May.
The idea to bid for the Coffee House was first
discussed last quarter and a task force chaired by
ASSU Sen. Dick Butterfield was created under
the auspices of the senate.
Butterfield cited "operational and manage
ment changes" as two major priorities to he ad
dressed under student administration. A signific
ant. and attractive highlight of the proposal
would he immediate price reductions and special
student discounts.
"One ol your major goals as a student-run
Coffee House is to reduce the prices," said But
terfield, "and we are confident that this reduction
will bring a greater portion of the community into
the Coffee House to enjoy the atmosphere."
The task force had to design a professional bid
in accordance with detailed contract specifica
tions covering items such as: hiring practices,
food prices and portion sizes, employee wages
and schedules, interior decoration, an operating
budget and other related requirements.
Butterfield said the group contacted restaur
ants in the community to determine appropriate
prices, menu and atmosphere. Additionally,

student-run coffee houses on other campuses
were contacted about methods of operations.
Optimism
"Although it's a monstrous project, I'm op
timistic and positive that we can get out a com
petitive contract. Tresidder cannot ignore the ex
pertise of Stanford students. And students are
doing the whole damn thing, down to the nuts and
bolts," he said.
Butterfield mentioned the efforts ol five
Graduate School ol Business students who de
signed the internal accounting systems.
The profits the Coffee House raised would be
channeled either directly back into the Coffee
House, translating into lower prices or renova
tion, or be tunneled into the general ASSU funds
to he redistributed to student groups. "No one
will be walking off with profits," Butterfield said.
High prices
In a survey the task force took, K4 percent of
the students said that the current prices were too
high. Three-quarters said they would be more
likely to frequent the Coffee House it it was run
by students. Aside from lowering the prices. But
terfield cited improved efficiency during the
lunch-time rush as a short-term objective.
"We want to initiate a movement toward Tre
sidder Union as a whole to become more of a
community center. There have been complaints
about the nomad set hanging out there The onl\
way to change that is il students feel n is tlnir
place," he said.
Butterfield emphasized continued and in

creased cooperation with Student Arts at Stan
lord (SIARIS) and Special Events to promote
weekly student concerts. He mentioned the pos
sibility ol a monthly concert with admission
charges as another way to increase student pat
ronage.
"People are anxious to have more entertain
ment and better art displays. We don't want to
turn it into a last rock-and-roll joint, though. We
believe that the Coffee House should be a quiet
place to relax and enjoy the environment," he
said.
Another consideration is a liquor license.
Maintaining that the objective was not to estab
lish "a pub," Butterfield predicted that "we will
continue to make beer available, but we won't
push it."
ASSU affiliation
The managerial echelon will be comprised ol a
professional manager (with preference given to
Stanford grads) and to two assistants governed by
a board of directors. The board would be made up
ol students, faculty and staff advisors assuring
community.input in the decision-making process.
"We envision the student-run Coffee House to
be affiliated with the ASSU, but not as a special
project under current guidelines," Butterfield
said.
Addressing the question of management
hanges affecting the current employees, Butter
field said that the staff would be hired at compar
able wages for a 90-day fair trial period. But the
employment campaign will be geared toward stu

dents. "We will try and develop an active solicita
tion ot student workers with the possiblity of
hiring some under the work-study program,'" he
added.
L" Ihe Oppenheim, assistant director ot I rcsid
dci I nion. complimented the students' efforts.
Homework accomplished
' I'm very impressed with the task force.
They're exploring the options \cr\ seriousl\
they've done their homework."
Oppenheim confirmed that there are "real
possibilities for a student-run Coffee I louse, but
that the selection ol a contractor would be based
purely on"what is best lor the I Iniversity. Unit is
a combination of subjective and objective cmci
ia. There are about 20 organizations bidding on
all or part of the food packages, and we will look
at all the proposals," she said.
Under a new policy which allows for splitting the
bid between several food facilities, an organiza
tion may compete for the contract for only some
ol the eating establishments i! it wishes.
Butterfield said he is confident that the student
proposal is competitive and complete. After
working for almost two quarters, sometimes lor
40 hours a week with a staff of 30 volunteers, he
remarked: "We have a good working experience
with all of the requirements that Tresidder put
into the contract specifications covering respon
siveness to the Stanlord community. That's right
up our alley."
