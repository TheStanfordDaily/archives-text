# Communications prof works on UN report
## 
### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
The affirmation ol journalists
right ol access to both official
and unofficial news sources, and
the condemnation ol all censor
ship were two major positions
taken by a recently released Un
ited Nations Educational. Social,
and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) report on interna
tional communications, accord
ing to Communication I'rof. E£ lie
Abel.
Abel was the American rep
resentative on the UN commis
sion which has been working tin
the report for the past two years.
The report says that "free ac
cess to news sources by jour
nalists is an indispensable re
quirement tor accurate, faithful,
and balanced reporting."
The provision calling lor ac
cess to unofficial sources —
suggested by Abel — is impor
tant because it calls for access to
the entire spectrum ot opinion
within any country, including
dissident and opposition forces,
he said.
Another provision of the re
port suggested by Abel was the
prohibition ol the use of jour
nalists by intelligence services.
"I think some people were
surprised that it was an Ameri
can member w ho proposed this."
Abel commented. "They must
understand that the American
press, by and large, has long con
sidered it an indignity to have the
C.I.A. and other intelligence
agencies using the cover ol jour
nalistic activity to carry out es
pionage."
The commission called for
higher journalistic standards. In
some areas, journalism is not an
acknowledged profession. Ac
cording to a provision in the re
port. more education and train
ing is needed to change this.
The commission's report
stated that a reassessment ol
conventional standards of news
selection and reporting and of
accepted news values was
needed to make coverage ol
world events more comprehen

si\c and less ethnocentric.
Abel commented that the first
step towards changing the prob
lem dI cthnoccntricit) in report
ing and editorial selection was to
acknowledge its existence. Abel
observed that mdiv iduals tend to
look at foreign scenes through a
spectrum limited b\ their own
cultural values.
"Inevitably, man) reporters
from developed countries tend
to look down on the scene (in
developing countries) that the)
are describing and tend to sneer
a little bit. whether the) intend to
or not." Abel said.
In the past, it was assumed that
a journalist could get "the story"
without a background on the cul
ture and language ol a foreign
countr) he is covering, according
to Abel.
"Now there is a recognition
that foreign countries are not
eas) to penetrate it vou are in
capable ol conversing with the
people or reading the litera
ture."
Abel said that the editorial
selection process was another
contributing factor to ethnocen
tric news coverage. The press
and broadcasting systems in de
veloped countries need to allot
more time and space to events
and background material about
foreign countries, he stated.
According to Abel, the Soviet
bloc members of the commission
called for enforcement ol higher
standards bv adopting an inter
national code t>l behavior for
journalists. This was not ac
cepted In the commission in the
final report.
"I was a leader ol the opposi
tion against it." Abel said. "I
think that a code that would be
applicable to the Soviet Union
and to the United States equally
is bound to be meaningless. The
words 'truth.' 'balance.' and
'freedom' mean different things
in different societies."
Abel also disagreed with a
movement passed bv the com
mission to circumscribe the ac
tion ol multinational wire ser
vices bv requiring them to com

ply with criteria defined by na
tional legislation.
" I ransnational corporations
are already required to obev the
laws ot the countries m which
they do business." he said.
Some Third World members
ol the commission objected to
the "colonialist domination" ol
news distribution bv developing
countries. Abel said.
"No Third World countries
arc forced to subscribe to foreign
news services. The notion that
thev are under compulsion,
which is what colonialism seems
to mean, is untenable." Abel
said.
Abel suggested that the Third
World countries needed to de
velop their own media and
trained personnel to operate
them, rather than excluding
foreign news sources.
"The only way you can get
more voices, which is what I
think we need, is not to destro)
existing voices, but to create new
ones." Abel said.
Abel said the report will stir
controversy when it is presented
in book form to the governments
of all member countries ol the
UN in the spring. He added that
anv results ot the report would
depend on what action Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow. director general
of UNESCO, would choose to
take.

national code t>l behavior for
journalists. This was not ac
cepted In the commission in the
final report.
"I was a leader ol the opposi
tion against it." Abel said. "I
think that a code that would be
applicable to the Soviet Union
and to the United States equally
is bound to be meaningless. The
words 'truth.' 'balance.' and
'freedom' mean different things
in different societies."
Abel also disagreed with a
movement passed bv the com
mission to circumscribe the ac
tion ol multinational wire ser
vices bv requiring them to com

ply with criteria defined by na
tional legislation.
" I ransnational corporations
are already required to obev the
laws ot the countries m which
they do business." he said.
Some Third World members
ol the commission objected to
the "colonialist domination" ol
news distribution bv developing
countries. Abel said.
"No Third World countries
arc forced to subscribe to foreign
news services. The notion that
thev are under compulsion,
which is what colonialism seems
to mean, is untenable." Abel
said.
Abel suggested that the Third
World countries needed to de
velop their own media and
trained personnel to operate
them, rather than excluding
foreign news sources.
"The only way you can get
more voices, which is what I
think we need, is not to destro)
existing voices, but to create new
ones." Abel said.
Abel said the report will stir
controversy when it is presented
in book form to the governments
of all member countries ol the
UN in the spring. He added that
anv results ot the report would
depend on what action Amadou
Mahtar M'Bow. director general
of UNESCO, would choose to
take.

The affirmation ol journalists
right ol access to both official
and unofficial news sources, and
the condemnation ol all censor
ship were two major positions
taken by a recently released Un
ited Nations Educational. Social,
and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO) report on interna
tional communications, accord
ing to Communication I'rof. E£ lie
Abel.
Abel was the American rep
resentative on the UN commis
sion which has been working tin
the report for the past two years.
The report says that "free ac
cess to news sources by jour
nalists is an indispensable re
quirement tor accurate, faithful,
and balanced reporting."
The provision calling lor ac
cess to unofficial sources —
suggested by Abel — is impor
tant because it calls for access to
the entire spectrum ot opinion
within any country, including
dissident and opposition forces,
he said.
Another provision of the re
port suggested by Abel was the
prohibition ol the use of jour
nalists by intelligence services.
"I think some people were
surprised that it was an Ameri
can member w ho proposed this."
Abel commented. "They must
understand that the American
press, by and large, has long con
sidered it an indignity to have the
C.I.A. and other intelligence
agencies using the cover ol jour
nalistic activity to carry out es
pionage."
The commission called for
higher journalistic standards. In
some areas, journalism is not an
acknowledged profession. Ac
cording to a provision in the re
port. more education and train
ing is needed to change this.
The commission's report
stated that a reassessment ol
conventional standards of news
selection and reporting and of
accepted news values was
needed to make coverage ol
world events more comprehen

si\c and less ethnocentric.
Abel commented that the first
step towards changing the prob
lem dI cthnoccntricit) in report
ing and editorial selection was to
acknowledge its existence. Abel
observed that mdiv iduals tend to
look at foreign scenes through a
spectrum limited b\ their own
cultural values.
"Inevitably, man) reporters
from developed countries tend
to look down on the scene (in
developing countries) that the)
are describing and tend to sneer
a little bit. whether the) intend to
or not." Abel said.
In the past, it was assumed that
a journalist could get "the story"
without a background on the cul
ture and language ol a foreign
countr) he is covering, according
to Abel.
"Now there is a recognition
that foreign countries are not
eas) to penetrate it vou are in
capable ol conversing with the
people or reading the litera
ture."
Abel said that the editorial
selection process was another
contributing factor to ethnocen
tric news coverage. The press
and broadcasting systems in de
veloped countries need to allot
more time and space to events
and background material about
foreign countries, he stated.
According to Abel, the Soviet
bloc members of the commission
called for enforcement ol higher
standards bv adopting an inter
national code t>l behavior for
journalists. This was not ac
cepted In the commission in the
final report.
