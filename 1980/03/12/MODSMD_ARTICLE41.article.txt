# Energy center gets $1.2 million

### Dean Eyre Staff Writer 
Stanford University's Energy Conser
vation Center (ECC) has received a $12
million grant from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to undertake energy-saving pro
jects in student housing.
The projects include replacement of in
candescent lights with fluorescent bulbs,
insulation of dormitory walls and installa
tion of more efficient room and building
heating controls. According to Karl
Johnson, director of the ECC, the conser
vation program should be underway this
summer and fall, "definitely before the
heating season begins."
Due to the length of time between the
proposal and its implementation amid ris
ing fuel costs and general inflation, the
realized economies may change some
what. he said. However, the University
should save a minimum of $167,000 to
$200,000 a year after the changes are
made, according to Johnson.
"The projected costs will be at least 1 0
percent low so that with the delay, the
project may cost $1.5 million," Johnson
said.
A factor more significant than cost pro
jection overruns is the price escalation of
the University's fuel supply.
"The University pays 33 cents per
therm for natural gas, but the price will be

40 cents per therm next year," Johnson
said. "That will affect the payback hy 50
percent."
According to the estimates drawn up by
Johnson and ECC energy specialist John
Eaton, the lighting portion of the project,
$ 194,220 of the grant, involves substitut
ing 331 5 incandescent lights with fluores
cent fixtures. This replacement will occur
in the Escondido Village highrises and in
the kitchens, dining rooms and stairwells
of undergraduate dorms.
The ECC itself has already funded and
completed such a conversion in Toyon
Hall with "good acceptance" from resi
dents, Johnson said.
While the costs of saving energy may
seem to be high at first glance, the ex
pense of higher utility bills is considerably
higher, according to Johnson.
"Forty to 50 percent of the electricity
used in dorms is used in lighting and a
large part of that is 24-hour lighting,"
Johnson said. "It costs $44 per year per
100-watt incandescent fixture compared
to $1 1 per year for fluorescent lights."
In addition to conserving energy and
saving money, the fluorescent lights will
also offer savings in labor and mainte
nance since they need to be changed only
once a year instead of seven times a year
for incandescent bulbs.
Approximately $454,630 of the grant
funds will go towards installing insulation,
largely in wall cavities to reduce heat loss.

The ECC's estimates call tor insulating
N27.355 square feet of walls with cel
lulose. The material not only helps to
keep cold out and heat in, hut it actually
increases the safety of buildings.
"There's added l ire safety because the
burn time (ol the insulated structure is
drastically reduced — the wall isn't acting
like a flue," Johnson explained.
The third part of the conservation prog
ram, with a $495,750 allocation, involves
installing radiator control valves for indi
vidual rooms in Crothers Memorial,
Branner, Stern, Roble and Toyon Halls,
l.agunita Court, Escondido Village and
most of Florence Moore Hall.
Johnson noted that in evaluating stu
dent response to past energy-saving ef
forts in housing, many replies were varia
tions on a theme: "112 ix the heating before
talking to me about insulation (and con
serving)." A major reason for this senti
ment is that presently most radiators can
only be left on or off. Differences in room
conditions such as shade, sun, wind expo
sure and distance from basements or at
tics affect the amount oi heat needed. The
new controls will "respond to individual
room temperatures," Johnson said.
An additional $12,000 will go towards
installing heating controls in several Row
houses and $34,000 is allotted for housing
in which individual room controls are not
a possibility. In such cases, zone controls
will regulate the building temperatures.

like a flue," Johnson explained.
The third part of the conservation prog
ram, with a $495,750 allocation, involves
installing radiator control valves for indi
vidual rooms in Crothers Memorial,
Branner, Stern, Roble and Toyon Halls,
l.agunita Court, Escondido Village and
most of Florence Moore Hall.
Johnson noted that in evaluating stu
dent response to past energy-saving ef
forts in housing, many replies were varia
tions on a theme: "112 ix the heating before
talking to me about insulation (and con
serving)." A major reason for this senti
ment is that presently most radiators can
only be left on or off. Differences in room
conditions such as shade, sun, wind expo
sure and distance from basements or at
tics affect the amount oi heat needed. The
new controls will "respond to individual
room temperatures," Johnson said.
An additional $12,000 will go towards
installing heating controls in several Row
houses and $34,000 is allotted for housing
in which individual room controls are not
a possibility. In such cases, zone controls
will regulate the building temperatures.
Stanford University's Energy Conser
vation Center (ECC) has received a $12
million grant from the Department of
Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to undertake energy-saving pro
jects in student housing.
The projects include replacement of in
candescent lights with fluorescent bulbs,
insulation of dormitory walls and installa
tion of more efficient room and building
heating controls. According to Karl
Johnson, director of the ECC, the conser
vation program should be underway this
summer and fall, "definitely before the
heating season begins."
Due to the length of time between the
proposal and its implementation amid ris
ing fuel costs and general inflation, the
realized economies may change some
what. he said. However, the University
should save a minimum of $167,000 to
$200,000 a year after the changes are
made, according to Johnson.
"The projected costs will be at least 1 0
percent low so that with the delay, the
project may cost $1.5 million," Johnson
said.
A factor more significant than cost pro
jection overruns is the price escalation of
the University's fuel supply.
"The University pays 33 cents per
therm for natural gas, but the price will be

40 cents per therm next year," Johnson
said. "That will affect the payback hy 50
percent."
According to the estimates drawn up by
Johnson and ECC energy specialist John
Eaton, the lighting portion of the project,
$ 194,220 of the grant, involves substitut
ing 331 5 incandescent lights with fluores
cent fixtures. This replacement will occur
in the Escondido Village highrises and in
the kitchens, dining rooms and stairwells
of undergraduate dorms.
The ECC itself has already funded and
completed such a conversion in Toyon
Hall with "good acceptance" from resi
dents, Johnson said.
While the costs of saving energy may
seem to be high at first glance, the ex
pense of higher utility bills is considerably
higher, according to Johnson.
"Forty to 50 percent of the electricity
used in dorms is used in lighting and a
large part of that is 24-hour lighting,"
Johnson said. "It costs $44 per year per
100-watt incandescent fixture compared
to $1 1 per year for fluorescent lights."
In addition to conserving energy and
saving money, the fluorescent lights will
also offer savings in labor and mainte
nance since they need to be changed only
once a year instead of seven times a year
for incandescent bulbs.
Approximately $454,630 of the grant
funds will go towards installing insulation,
largely in wall cavities to reduce heat loss.

The ECC's estimates call tor insulating
N27.355 square feet of walls with cel
lulose. The material not only helps to
keep cold out and heat in, hut it actually
increases the safety of buildings.
"There's added l ire safety because the
burn time (ol the insulated structure is
drastically reduced — the wall isn't acting
like a flue," Johnson explained.
