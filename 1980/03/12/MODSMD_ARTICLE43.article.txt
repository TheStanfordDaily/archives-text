I lie chairman ol Satra Corp.
said in an interview here that he
believes the compaii) is within
si\ months ol complying with
En\ ironmental Protection
Agencv (EPA) and safety regu
lations that must he met before
the car can he imported.
I lle car in question is the
l.ada, a 7b-horsepower subcom
pact car with a body design simi
lar to the Hat but an engine and
suspension system ol Soviet de
sign. I he l .ada is already being
imported by Satra to England
and West (iermany.
With sales still at least a year
oil. the company does not quote
an exact price but said the ear
will sell tor "in excess of $4500"
that puts it in the range ol
other small imported economy
cars.
- Satra expects to import 5000
cars initially, building up to im
ports ol 50.000 to 60.000 within
live years, said chairman Ara
O/tcmel. Imports at that level
would gi\e the Lada approxi
mately .05 percent on the
American car market.
(Georgia transition
The cars will be imported
through Savannah, (ia.. where
Satra plans to build a plant to put
finishing touches on the cars lor
sale in the I S. market. "Even
tually we must have an import
center in the New York-New
'Jersey area as well." said O/-
temel.
' O/temel said Satra has not
completed arrangements with
distributors yet but that a large
number have expressed an in
terest in selling the car. including
"some ol the major U.S. auto
makers."
Hie car is produced in a Sov ict
factory built in conjunction with
Hat, whose body design the car
follows. What distinguishes the
car. according to Satra officials,
is its suspension system — "de

signed to meet the Soviet I n
ion's rugged road conditions"
and its uncomplicated cngineer
111 l!.
Tests galore
"We've done a lot ol work
with EPA. We've done a lot ol
work in our emission control lab
in New Jersey," said O/temel.
"As the tests are performed, the
results are taken to the Soviet
Union and implemented in the
factory."
Satra, a publicly traded com
pany which is about 70 percent
owned by O/temel. was founded
in the early 19505. Initially, the
company was principally in
volved in importing chrome ore
and other ores and metals to the
United States.
"The subject ol chrome was
what took me to the Soviet Un
ion." said O/temel. An Arme
nian whose family lived in Tur
key. O/temel came to the United
States to attend the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and went into business here
while he was in school.
Frontrunner
O/temel began trade with the
Sov ict Union in a time when it
was almost nonexistent. With an
office in Moscow that employs
approximately 26 workers. Satra
is one ol some do/en U.S. com
panies accredited to do business
in the Soviet Union. The com
pany's volume in 1979 was ap
proximately $312 million.
The company has three major
divisions, including its auto divi
sion. Another div ision runs three
plants that produce ferroalloys, a
product used in the production
of stainless steel and items that
are heat and corrosive resistant.
The plants — in Steubenv ille.
Ohio: Charleston. S.C.. and
Vargon, Sweden — consume
large quantities of the chrome
Satra exports from the Soviet
Union and elsewhere.
Satra also has a trading divi
sion. which handles the trade in
metals and ores and imports
other items to the Soviet Union,
including synthetic rubber and
medical supplies.
Political ramifications
The chill in Soviet-American
relations has not seriously hurt
Satra's business, although the

companv sullered some when
dockworkers rclused to unload
ships coming Ironi the So\ jet I n
ion. O/temel said.
But he predicted thai the re
sults ol partial trade embargoes
may injure American interests in
the long run."I sensed (lustra
tion and some surprise, during a
recent visit to Moscow." he said.
"In terms ol trade, I felt some
very serious damage has been
done," he said. "I think it will be
a long time before the Soviets
will consider buying lor the
long-term — or buying products
that need spare and replacement
parts — from the United States,
because trade can be inter
rupted," O/temel said.
Hor instance, computers
purchased from Ameican firms
are now idle because the Soviets
cannot get parts, he said.

I lle car in question is the

pact car with a body design simi

imported by Satra to England
and West (iermany.
With sales still at least a year
oil. the company does not quote
an exact price but said the ear
will sell tor "in excess of $4500"
that puts it in the range ol
other small imported economy
cars.
- Satra expects to import 5000
cars initially, building up to im
ports ol 50.000 to 60.000 within
live years, said chairman Ara
O/tcmel. Imports at that level
would gi\e the Lada approxi
mately .05 percent on the
American car market.
(Georgia transition
The cars will be imported
through Savannah, (ia.. where
Satra plans to build a plant to put
finishing touches on the cars lor
sale in the I S. market. "Even
tually we must have an import
center in the New York-New
'Jersey area as well." said O/-
temel.
' O/temel said Satra has not
completed arrangements with
distributors yet but that a large
number have expressed an in
terest in selling the car. including
"some ol the major U.S. auto
makers."
Hie car is produced in a Sov ict
factory built in conjunction with
Hat, whose body design the car
follows. What distinguishes the
car. according to Satra officials,
is its suspension system — "de

signed to meet the Soviet I n
ion's rugged road conditions"
and its uncomplicated cngineer
111 l!.
Tests galore
"We've done a lot ol work
with EPA. We've done a lot ol
work in our emission control lab
in New Jersey," said O/temel.
"As the tests are performed, the
results are taken to the Soviet
Union and implemented in the
factory."
Satra, a publicly traded com
pany which is about 70 percent
owned by O/temel. was founded
in the early 19505. Initially, the
company was principally in
volved in importing chrome ore
and other ores and metals to the
United States.
"The subject ol chrome was
what took me to the Soviet Un
ion." said O/temel. An Arme
nian whose family lived in Tur
key. O/temel came to the United
States to attend the Mas
sachusetts Institute of Technol
ogy and went into business here
while he was in school.
Frontrunner
O/temel began trade with the
Sov ict Union in a time when it
was almost nonexistent. With an
office in Moscow that employs
approximately 26 workers. Satra
is one ol some do/en U.S. com
panies accredited to do business
in the Soviet Union. The com
pany's volume in 1979 was ap
proximately $312 million.
The company has three major
divisions, including its auto divi
sion. Another div ision runs three
plants that produce ferroalloys, a
product used in the production
of stainless steel and items that
are heat and corrosive resistant.
The plants — in Steubenv ille.
Ohio: Charleston. S.C.. and
Vargon, Sweden — consume
large quantities of the chrome
Satra exports from the Soviet
Union and elsewhere.
Satra also has a trading divi
sion. which handles the trade in
metals and ores and imports
other items to the Soviet Union,
including synthetic rubber and
medical supplies.
Political ramifications
The chill in Soviet-American
relations has not seriously hurt
Satra's business, although the

companv sullered some when
dockworkers rclused to unload
ships coming Ironi the So\ jet I n
ion. O/temel said.
But he predicted thai the re
sults ol partial trade embargoes
may injure American interests in
the long run."I sensed (lustra
tion and some surprise, during a
recent visit to Moscow." he said.
"In terms ol trade, I felt some
very serious damage has been
done," he said. "I think it will be
a long time before the Soviets
will consider buying lor the
long-term — or buying products
that need spare and replacement
parts — from the United States,
because trade can be inter
rupted," O/temel said.
Hor instance, computers
purchased from Ameican firms
are now idle because the Soviets
cannot get parts, he said.
