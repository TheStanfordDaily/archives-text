I astweek. 11illcl sponsored a noon ses
sion to discuss intcriaitli dating and the
main issues which arise from it.
Light students attended the session
which leatured two guest speakers: Bruce
I'lther. a IJ ni\-crsit> graduate and profes
sional psychologist in I'alo Alto, and
Nane\ lamlcr. who works at the Jewish
Community Center in San Jose.
together, the two run a l'i\e-session
weekly workshop 1r intermarried
couples which will he held here in lull.
I lie intermarriage and interdating issue
is o! particular concern to the Jewish
community, lamlcr said, because one
third ol the Jews in the United States in
termarry .
Until now. intermarriage has heen a
taboo topic, he added.
" I he problems were there, but no one
talked about them," he said.

At the woi kshops. couples discuss v an
nus problems th.it arise in these relation
ships. A common concern among most is
that the children will end up with no relig
ion at all.
While this does happen. I'ither noted
that most couples do decide on certain
rituals lor their children, though the ritu
als do not necessarily belong exclusively
to one faith.
"My kids are going to be part Jewish
and part non-Jewish." said I'ither. himselt
a Protestant married to a Jew.
His three-year old daughter attends a
Jewish preschool.
"I don't know how she's going to turn
out." he said. "Obviously she's going to
assimilate both sets ol beliefs. It depends
on what she decides."
One student pointed out that "you
can't be part-Jewish." and Tamler agreed.
"Eventually, around age IS, you have to
decide." she said.
Sometimes parents or other laniily
members reject or even disown the inter
married couple. Usually. Tamler said, this
rejection stems out ol fear. The Jewish

communitv is especially leailul. she said,
"because I lie n" rc such a minority and
I lies'i c .ill.ml then culture won't survive
with too much uitcrmaiTiaee
Tamlci suggested that I lie way lot in
tcrmiirried couples to cope with the icjcc
