# Intl. living: Roughing it abroad
## 
### Sara Tung Staff Writer 
;. For those of you who want to spend some
Itime overseas and are willing to forgo the
■comforts of Stanford-in-Wherever, the Ex
periment in International Living may be
something to look into.
Affiliated with the United Nations
Economic and Social Councii (UNESCO)
and other international organizations, the
Experiment has, since 1932, offered travel
programs in 30 countries on six continents.
Experiment programs differ from others in
their organization and emphasis on home
stay. Participants from throughout the United
States assemble in groups of eight to 13 to
travel and live as members of host families
during most of their stay overseas.
In addition students may travel indepen
dently or with their groups or participate in
•such "special activities" as sports or com
munity construction projects. The programs
also provide cross-cultural orientation and
language instruction prior to departure.
ElL's South American Odyssey took

junior Leslie Moulton through Peru, Argen
tina, Brazil and Chile, where she lived with
her host family. Moulton, like other particip
ants, toured both with her group and on her
own. She cited her homestay as being the
best part of her trip and described Chilean
family life as being "completely different"
from its American counterpart.
Despite hardships caused by differences in
language and customs —the curlew her fam
ily imposed on her was a definite disap
pointment she said — Moulton's exposure to
different customs allowed her to try to "re
spect how and why" these customs came to
be.
Moulton said her only objection to the
Experiment was the group's lack of organiza
tion. She noted, however, that the program
was not intended to be "institutionalized."
but informal, and she lauded her "know
ledgeable" and "informed" group leader.
Moulton emphasized personal benefits
over academic enrichment in describing her
gains from the experience. She said her
South American Odyssey provided an "im

pctus to learn Spanish," one of the major
reasons which prompted her to "experi
ment."
"I want to go back," she said.
According to a brochure on the Experi
ment, summer programs are "very carefully
and intentionally structured as a learning ex
perience" and are not just "cultural bub
bles."
Applicants may spend anywhere from four
to eight weeks of the summer in one or more
countries. Program fees range from $ 1550 to
$2750, and financial aid is available. In addi
tion, transfer credit can be arranged through
the program's School for International
Training, a fully-accredited senior college
and graduate school which offers a college
semester abroad program.
So. whether it's hiking in Switzerland,
working on a construction project in Africa,
sailing along the French Riviera, or simply a
summer of traveling and homestay, the Ex
periment in International Living may have a
lot to offer. Applications, due in Friday, are
available through the Overseas Resource
Center in Bechtel International Center.
