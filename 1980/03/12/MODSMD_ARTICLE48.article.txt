# Old technology used to fight today's energy shortage
## 
### John C. Eagan Associated Press 
SAN FRANCISCO — America is inching to
ward taking a giant step backward, returning to
50-year-old technology to help ease the energy
squeeze of the 1980s.
The technology in question is energy "cogenera
tion," in which electricity is generated by "fuel"
that would otherwise be wasted — industrial steam
that spews into the air or wood chips and trash that
can be burned to create more steam.
The steam can then be channeled into turning
power-generating turbines.
The net effect is almost a doubling in fuel effi
ciency, from a level of 35 percenUto 40 percent in a
normal plant to 75 percent to 80 percent with
cogeneration. By getting double duty from fuel,
half as much is needed.
It's all part of the trend to alternate power
sources such as solar and wind power, and experts
say cogeneration promises a drastic reduction in
U.S. dependence on imported oil and nuclear
power:
—"It is the immediately available energy alter
native to coal and nuclear plants," says Jim Hard
ing of the, environmental group, Friends of the
Earth.
—"It will be energy at bargain prices, compared
to building big new power plants," says Bob Burt of
the California Manufacturers Association.
—"There is a 6000-megawatt potential in
cogeneration in Californa alone — the equivalent
of six 1000-megawatt nuclear plants," says Claire
Dedrick. a member of the state Public Utilities
Commission.
Cogeneration is not some new trend being
touted only by "California-type" conservationists.
The huge Dow Chemical company has taken to
cogeneration in a big way, according to Andy
I loch, manager of Dow's plant in Pittsburg, about
40 miles east of San Francisco.
"In all our Dow sites we have gone to cogenera
tion," he said "It doubles our efficiency and cuts
our costs. You end up using half the fuel."
The Pittsburg plant has been self-sufficient in
electricity and steam used in processing since the
cogeneration system was completed in 1977 for
about $12 million, Hoch said.
In the 19305, U.S. industry got 25 percent of its
electricity from cogeneration. Now cogeneration
pro\ ides only 4 percent of the country's generating
capacity.
Observers say that starting 50 years ago, utilities

turned from cogeneration to the "economy of
scale," favoring the construction of ever bigger
power plants because that was cheaper — until the
prices of oil and natural gas skyrocketed.
"It's an idea whose time has come back,"
the PUC s Dedrick, a major supporter cogenera
tion.
"II taken to its logical conclusion, cogeneration
can make this country self-sufficient in energy — if
included with municipal waste use and renewal luel
such as wood and alcohol.
"It has a number of environmental and
economic advantages," Dedrick adds. "It is rela
tively inexpensive, a conventional technology.
Cogeneration plants can be on-line in three to five
years, as opposed to 10 years for a large nuclear or
coal-fired power plant.
"Properly developed, cogeneration could re
duce our dependence on imported oil by 30 per
cent in three years. And the overall air pollution
would be less with cogeneration."
The PUC is pushing power companies to use
cogeneration. Last December it penalized the
giant Pacific (las & Electric Co. $7 million in a
rate decision because commissioners were dissatis
fied with PG&E's attitude on cogeneration.
The PUC says the utility can recoup the penalty
if it moves aggressively toward cogeneration.
"Cogeneration is a significant energy source and
is going to become more important in the future —
no doubt about it."says Charles Peterson,
spokesman for PG&E, which provides electricity
and natural gas to most of Northern and Central
California.
Joseph Orlando, president of the year-old Inter
national Cogeneration Society in Washington.
D.C., says Congress should offer tax credits to
further encourage cogeneration.
"There are a lot of uncertainties about the future
because of marginal economics," says Orlando.
"There are too few incentives for plants to invest in
cogeneration, but that is starting to turn around as
the price of energy goes up."
Halt of the potential Dedrick sees for California
would come from steam that would be used to
liquify an extremely thick crude oil in California's
Kern County so it could be pumped from the
ground. Between 10 billion and 20 billion barrels
of the thick oil are buried there, equivalent to the
entire nation's consumption for two or three years.
"Like everything else that starts in California,"
says Dedrick. "most of it applies to the rest of the
country."
