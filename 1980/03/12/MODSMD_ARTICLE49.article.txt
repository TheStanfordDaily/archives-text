Racy pictures
Ii you're looking lor some
racy pictures and late-night en
tertainment. this may not be the
book lor you. Unless a BBT
chart showing ovulation about
the 13th day or some typical or
ganisms ol treponema pallidum
make you pant and writhe,
bypass this bestseller. Sweet
dreams.
It you want moral ad\ice.
you'll want to sink youi teeth
into Aristotle's story ol a horse
that threw itscll over a clilt in
horror at the realization that it
had mated with its own mother
by mistake, thus committing in
cest. Iliis conscience-ridden
animal surely provides a more
tangible moral model than do
modern ethical codes which, the
book informs us. consist in

everyone "playing it by ear."
Autoeroticism in college
Some readers may feel them
selves enlightened by statistics
on the sexual beliav lor ol others,
few. however, will rejoice in
kinsey's tinding that the mean
Irequency of total sexual outlet
lor white males between adoles
cence and N5 years is nearly
three orgasms in an average
week. Neither will they be in
spired by the knowledge that au
toerotic activities constitute the
most important source of or
gasms lor college-educated
males.
Although a few conclusions ol
personal interest may be drawn
Irom Katchadourian and

Lunde's information on sexual
behavior, these conclusions can
only he as substantial as the in
formation at hand.
Indecency
The authors claim their pur
pose is to inform future attitudes
on sexuality while quoting Alan
(iregg's introduction to the l l )4<s
kinsey volume: "Certainly no
aspect ot human biology in our
current civilization stands in
more need ol scientific know
ledge and courageous humanity
than that ol sex. ... As long as
se\ is dealt with in the current
context ol ignorance and sophis
tication. denial and indulgence,
supression and stimulation,
punishment and exploitation.

moral guidelines to be gleaned
• rom this discussion, they are in
geniously tucked away behind
the authors' painstaking (and
secrecy and display, it will be as
sociated with a duplicity and in
decency that lead neither to in
tellectual honesty nor human
dignity."
In the dark
These remarks, made two de
cades ago. are equally applicable
now, the authors say. Their
acknowledgement ol the lack ol
information on sex appears, dis
hearteningly. amidst a 36-page
treatise on sexual behavior, a
term which they admit is impos
sible to define. If there are any
aggravating) efforts to remain
neutral. The eager student ol
morality is. thus, left duped, in
the dark, doomed to "play it by
ear."
Approaches to coitus
II your question isn't why or
why not, but how to, a.) don't
buy this book and b.) good luck!
Katchadourian and Lunde bring
us the sobering news that "De
spite the innumerable erotic
postures described in love man
uals. the basic approaches to
coitus are relatively few." They
attempt to prove this in four
basic (very) drawings which,
they admit, obviate the need lor
detailed descriptions. Then,
after stringing readers along for
29N pages ol drooling anticipa
tion. the authors have the audacity
to refer us to sex manuals which,
they console us. "... are replete
with such descriptions." Thanks.
Kicks
In short, il you're looking lor
vital information, for pearls ol
wisdom, or just lor kicks, look
elsewhere.
11. however, you're interested
in sex — reading about it — buy
this book. You'll learn that, dur
ing the lust four to six weeks ol
the lust trimester, minimal dila
tion with a plastic cannula one
si/e smaller than the suction
curette may be sufficient lor
abortion, and that 16-year-old
j Claudine de Culam was con
i v icted ol copulating with a dog in

I nal.
