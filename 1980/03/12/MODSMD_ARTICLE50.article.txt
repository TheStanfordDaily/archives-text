Whatever be the detail with
which you cram your students,
the chance of their meeting in
after-life exactly that detail is al
most in finitesimal; and if they do
meet it, they will probably have
forgotten what yon taught them
about it. - A.N. Whitehead.
So beui ns the second edition of
I inancial Accounting, the green
and gold hardbound volume that
h;is become ;i textbook lor prac
ticalk every student of ac
counting at Stanford, the volume
that until now has eluded the crit
ical attention which it deserves.
It is often said that too many
prols spoil the book. With three
authors contributing to a single
work, one expects perhaps some
disjunction between chapters.
Or even within a chapter. Or a
sentence: "learning can take
place most effectively when the
student starts with a broad pic
ture. then breaks up that broad
picture into smaller pieces until
the desired depth is achieved,
and fiiplly nthesi/es so that the
relationship between the parts
and the whole can be kept in
perspective."
Yet in the overview, the book
ranks with the likes of Plato's
Republic and Aristotle's Politics,
sic componere magnis parva mihi
fas est (Ov id). Then the ov er\iew
ends, and the book separates
into three parts: concepts and
methods, reporting assets and
equities and current issues in fi
nancial reporting.

The important concepts are
identified early in each chapter,
and emphasis is placed on proce
dure so that the student can in
terpret, analyze and evaluate fi
nancial statements without get
ting bogged down in detail. To
aid in this effort not to "bog
down" the reader, there are up
to 25 pages of problems at the
end of each chapter. (Nil sine
magno vita labore debit mor
tali bus (S' Horace.)
Are you still paying attention?
Good, then, let's continue.
The diligent reader will surely
attempt a few til these problems,
and a deep sense of accomplish
ment will be felt when a solution
is obtained. Whether or not the
solution is correct is incidental,
and. owing to the absence of cor
rect solutions, in the end un
knowable. Mais, cane fait rien.
Because, after all, labor ipse vol

ii/itu s (Ma nil lis).
In the latter sections ol tins
pedantic, nay. even academic
work, the illustrious authors il
lustrate the application ol vari
ous accounting methods and
consider their efleets on financial
statements. This edition includes
the most recent I ASB opinions
and the changes necessitated In
them, prosing that ex mulis
moribus bonae leges mute sunt
(Coke). A subtle treatise for the
corporate-capitalist economy. '
The value of this work is truly
marginal. The book will be a cre
dit to any person's library, for
only with time could it ever de
preciate.
I would just like to conclude
by pointing out that of all the
criticisms which could be written
on this book, this has evidently
been one of them.
