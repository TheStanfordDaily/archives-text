From the Inst formate to the
final furan, Streitwieser and
Heathcock present the reader
with a rapid-fire, no-time-to
hreathe procession ol I unctions,
phenols, phosphates and had al
literation. To say that this book
follows a formula is. indeed, a
had pun.
The hook itself is green and
heavy. This serves to enhance
the notion, propounded by
Strcithwieser and Heathcock.
that chemistry is green and
heavy. A view no doubt held by

bothered to read then tome.

with Stanford. Berkeley authors

worth noting, is Chapter 36, on

drives a Hugatti and Heathcock
