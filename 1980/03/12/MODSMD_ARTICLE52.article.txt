The Tragedy of Hamlet,
Prince of Denmark
William Shakespeare
New American Library
271 pp., $1.50
In the ye «ir 1600. Will in m
Shakespeare wrote Hamlet.
And. since then, most well
educated people in the Wesjern
world have read it. Some fiave
done so lor pleasure, others tor
the purpose ol scholarly study.
Hither way. Shakespeare's ven
erable old drama has been read
and read and read.
Needless to say. it is extremely
dilicult to find some modern
commentary on the play which is
not worn and hackneyed. Hut.
happily, difficult does not mean
impossible.
Hamlet, in Shakespeare's
time, yielded satisfaction not
only from its immutable univer
sal messages — which do remain
today — but from its context in
b.li/a be than England — which
does not remain today.
But. it might be possible to re
capture the contextual pleasures

ol Hamlet without loresaking the
more profound aspects ol its
theme. Therefore, let's imagine
what Hamlet would be like il it
were to be produced today,
perhaps by Neil Simon, under
the title ol Castle Suite.
1 lie lirst tiling we would prob
ably expect to be changed is the
traditional interpretations ol the
characters.
n>r example, our contempor
ary version would probably
eliminate Prince I lamlet's prop
ensity to stab people while at the
same time maintaining his intel
lectual nature. Also, we would
probably preserve his inclination
to say lewd things to women.
Therefore, the new prince might
be played by Woody Allen.
Hamlet's macho, heroic image
would suffer some, but we would
all profit from the addition of the
more contemporary personality
traits ol paranoia and neurosis.
A second thing we might at
tempt to do is update the plot a
little bit. After all. people don't
ascend to thrones any more.
And. even if they did. practically

no one would pour poison into
peoples' ears to speed up the
process.
A more modern approach
and one certainly more relevant
to all the high school seniors and
college Ireshmen who have to
read llamlet might involve the
intrigues inevitable to the pro
cess ol applying to medical
school. Instead ol pouring odd
substances into the ears ol one's
Iriends. one might plausiblv pom
odd substances into otliei
peoples' samples in chemistrv
lab.

not worn and hackneyed. Hut.
happily, difficult does not mean
impossible.
Hamlet, in Shakespeare's
time, yielded satisfaction not
only from its immutable univer
sal messages — which do remain
today — but from its context in
b.li/a be than England — which
does not remain today.
But. it might be possible to re
capture the contextual pleasures

ol Hamlet without loresaking the
more profound aspects ol its
theme. Therefore, let's imagine
what Hamlet would be like il it
were to be produced today,
perhaps by Neil Simon, under
the title ol Castle Suite.
1 lie lirst tiling we would prob
ably expect to be changed is the
traditional interpretations ol the
characters.
n>r example, our contempor
ary version would probably
eliminate Prince I lamlet's prop
ensity to stab people while at the
same time maintaining his intel
lectual nature. Also, we would
probably preserve his inclination
to say lewd things to women.
Therefore, the new prince might
be played by Woody Allen.
Hamlet's macho, heroic image
would suffer some, but we would
all profit from the addition of the
more contemporary personality
traits ol paranoia and neurosis.
A second thing we might at
tempt to do is update the plot a
little bit. After all. people don't
ascend to thrones any more.
And. even if they did. practically

no one would pour poison into
peoples' ears to speed up the
process.
A more modern approach
and one certainly more relevant
to all the high school seniors and
college Ireshmen who have to
read llamlet might involve the
intrigues inevitable to the pro
cess ol applying to medical
school. Instead ol pouring odd
substances into the ears ol one's
Iriends. one might plausiblv pom
odd substances into otliei
peoples' samples in chemistrv
lab.
I inallv. we would surelv not
rest as lone as our modern I lam-

Id remained apolitical .1 net
heterosexual.
We wonkl prohahlv expect,
loi instance. the injection ol .1
little homosexual theme into the
plav In .1 sliiiht adjustment in the
discussion ol Kosencrant/ and
C iuildenstei n. I hat would cer
tainlv catapult the archaic Hum
lei out ol the I "ill and into the
2(ith centu I\.
Moreover, there is a elcai op
port 111111 \ Io 1 us to w ea\ e a
lem mist thread into the plot's
lahric. We could, lot example,
picture Bella \h/ut! as (ie 1 -
truile. Hamlet's mother. New
soliloquies on the subject ol
hei 111: a woman in a male
dominatcd world would iiive a
new nnulern zip to Ilamia's tired
domestic scenario.
I he point ol all this is simplv
that we are. in main vvavs. leit
out ol lliimld. Shakespeare
wrote Io 1 the patrons ol the
(ilohc I heatre vs() \eais auo
not us. (irantcil. we can still ap
preciate the skeleton ol the plav.
hut its 11esh has lone since rotted
