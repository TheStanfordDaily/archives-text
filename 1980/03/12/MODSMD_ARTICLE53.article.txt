U.N. panel returns empty-handed
Secretary General Kurt Waldheim said yesterday that he
was confident the U.S. hostages in Tehran would eventually
be released despite the empty-handed return of a United
Nations commission sent to deal with the problem.
Waldheim attributed the failure of the live commission
ers to secure the release of the hostages to the power strug
gle in Iran.
Meanwhile. Iranian president Abolhassen Bani-Sadr
said the American hostages cannot be freed before mid-
May because the yet-to-be-elected parliament must have
time to consider their fate, the French newspaper Le Monde
reported yesterday.
Bani-Sadr also accused Iran's Revolutionary Council of
"weakness and indecision" in dealing with the militants'
retusal to let members of the U.S. investigatory commission
see the hostages, the newspaper said.
The U.N. commission lett Tehran early yesterday, alter
1 7 days in Tehran without getting to see any ol the approx
imately 50 hostages and without 438 pages of copied docu
ments Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini had instructed the
militants to turn over.
The militants, who occupied the embassy Nov. 4. said the
documents would "prove U.S. criminal activities" under
the deposed shah.
In New York, the personal physician of Shah Mohammad
Reza Pahlavi said he is suffering from an inflamed spleen
and requires a "hazardous" operation to remove it. The
shah has lived in Panama since treatment for cancerandgall
bladder problem*, in the United States last year.
The Tehran embassy was taken over shortly after the
shah's arrival in New York last October lor treatment.
Soviets consider Afghan neutrality
Britain has received "private messages" that the Kremlin
looks willing to negotiate the proposal by British Foreign
Secretary Lord Carrington lor a neutral and non-aligned
Alghanistan. Foreign Office sources in London said yester
day.
In Moscow, however, the Soviet Union publicly repeated
its opposition to Western proposals lor the neutralization of
Afghanistan.
Britain and the Soviet Union so lar have held two formal
discussions about the idea, which Lord Carrington put for
ward at a meeting ol the nine-nation Common Market
ministers on Feb. 19.
But it was not until late last week, the sources said, that
Britain receiv ed "private messages" from the Soviets on the
matter.
Meanwhile in the Alghan war zone. Soviet airborne
troops backed by helicopter gunships and tanks destroyed
several villages and secured a key wilderness road but hun
dreds ol square miles of the eastern Afghan countryside
remain lirmly under rehel control. Pakistan military sources
said yesterday.
1 he sources said the Russians were continuing the bloodv
drive started March 1 to drive the guerrillas out ot major
strongholds in Kunar Province, which borders Pakistan.
"We have good reason to believe that several villages
were completely destroyed and hundreds of persons were
killed in the Kunar Valley." said an officer who declined to
he identified.
But he added that the guerrillas, most of them loyal to
exiled Islamic fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. re
mained in control ol every mountain pass leading from
Kunar Province into northern Pakistan.

Registration hits Senate opposition
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's proposal
to register young men tor the military draft ran into hostile
opposition from members of .1 Senate appropriations sub
committee yesterday.
The plan was denounced as being a "red herring," a
"smoke screen," "unnecessary," "wrong" and as the open
ing wedge to revive the draft and end the all-volunteer
army.
Administration officials. 111 turn, defended the registra
tion plan as a necessary move to get a manpower inventory
it a national emergency requires revival of the draft.
Although Congress would have to enact a new law to
reinstitute the draft, the president now has authority to
renew registration. But the largely dormant Selective Ser
v ice System lacks the money to finance a registration prog
ram and is asking for $13.3 million extra lor the present
tiscal year ending Sept.3o and $16.N million more for fiscal
19S1
Carter's request tor authority to register women lor the
dratt appears to be doomed, and yesterday's Senate hearing
showed that Ins money request to register men is in trouble
on both sides of the Capitol.
A House appropriations subcommittee defeated the
money request 011 a 6-6 vote last month. The full committee
is trying to devise a formula to revive it.
Israel takes land near Jerusalem
JERUSALEM —The Israeli government, in defiance ot
mounting international criticism of its settlements in the
occupied West Bank, yesterday expropriated 1000 acres of
Arab land east of Jerusalem to close a circle of Jewish
suburbs around the city.
Finance Minister Yigael Hurvit/ signed the land-seizure
order, government sources said, putting 111 eftect the first
stage ot a Jewish settlement expansion plan that has met stiff
opposition from Palestinian leaders and from Jerusalem
Mayor Teddy kollek.
The expropiation order, issued yesterday altera Cabinet
advisory committee met secretly Monday night, appears to
contradict the spirit — if not the letter — ol a government
policy decision Oct. 14 not to expropiate "one inch" ol
privately owned Arab land for new settlements.
In that decision, the Cabinet said its policy of seizing only
public domain land formerly owned by the Jordanian
Crown Council would apply to the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip, but it did not specifically mention East
Jerusalem, which was annexed by Israel after the 1967 Six-
Day War.
The reasoning of the Labor and the Likud governments
has been that a ring ot densely populated Jewish suburbs
around Jerusalem would make it impossible to redefine the
capital's boundaries in any political compromise with Jordan
or the Palestinians.
Mugabe takes control in Rhodesia
SALISBURY. Rhodesia — Robert Mugabe formally be
came prime minister of Rhodesia yesterday and named a
broadly based 23-person Cabinet that included his chief
political rival, a woman and two whites.
In taking over as head of the first majority black-run
government here. Mugabe included a mix ol old-time
nationalists and firebrands of his own party and lour mem
bers of rival Joshua Nkomo's party.
The moves by the Marxist intellectual and former guer
rilla leader were termed by a spokesman for Lord Soames.
the British interim governor. as"a continuation of the spirit
of national reconciliation" followed bv Mugabe since his

overwhelming parliamentary election victory 1 1 days ago.
Under the agreement worked out in London under
British aegis late last year, seven years of guerrilla warfare
led by Mugabe and Nkomo ended, the elections were held
and independence will come in about three weeks. At that
time, Rhodesia will be named Zimbabwe and Mugabe will
run the new government.
Mugabe appointed rival guerrilla leader Nkomo minister
of home affairs, a job that includes supervision of the police.
But in an apparent effort to divide control of the
peacekeeping and paramilitary forces, Mugabe named him
self defense minister. He also will retain control ol a "na
tional security element" within the prime minister's office,
according to a spokesman.
Hayakawa urges Iranian round-up
SACRAMENTO — California Sen. S.I. Hayakawa says
the United States should declare a "state of belligerency"
with Iran and place all Iranians in this country in relocation
camps "the way we did with the Japanese in World War II."
Hayakawa, who is of Japanese ancestry, made the re
marks in an interview Monday with the Sacra men to Bee in
Washington.
"We interned 110,000 Japanese during World War 11,
and we managed all right," Hayakawa said. "After what's
happened, we have every reason to declare a state of bel
ligerency and round up all non-citizen Iranians and put
them in relocation centers."
The 73-year-old Republican senator, who is a member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an inter
view published yesterday that the State Department's ef
forts to gain the release of American Embassy hostages in
Tehran have failed and it is time "to get some bargaining
chips."
Discussing his relocation camp proposal, Hayakawa said.

"the difference this time from the way we handled the
Japanese is that we would distinguish between American
citi/ens of Iranian descent, who wouldn't be rounded up,
and non-citizen Iranians, who would be.
