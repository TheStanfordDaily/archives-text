# Lyons to review French House
## 
### Andrea James News Editor 
The French cultural attache in San Francisco has written
a letter to the President's Office asking for a reconsidera
tion of the recent decision by housing administrators to
discontinue the French theme house here.
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons is now rev iewing
the decision by Assoc. Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson to abolish the theme and replace it with an
East Asian Studies house.
Lyons is expected to make his decision later this week.
"The attache has taken an active part in the affairs of the
French house during the last several years and has given
money to the house to support different activities," said
French Department Chairman Ralph Hester. "He was very
surprised to learn of the decision to discontinue the theme."
Cultural attache Jean Claude Cuzzi was unavailable for
comment yesterday.
Lyons said he was asked by the 1-tench department to
rev iew last week's decision by Robinson and the Configura
tion Panel to reject an appeal by French house residents for
reinstatement of the theme.
The week belore, Robinson had followed the panel's
unanimous recommendation to terminate the theme be
cause ot the lack ol leadership, student participation and
sense ol community that panelists believed had pervaded

the house this year.
Composed of students, tacuity and administrators, the
Configuration Panel is ;in enlarged version ot the Commit
tee on Student Services. Subcommittee on Residences
(COSS-R).
Lyons said he will base his decision primarily on what
residents have written — both letters ol appeal and the
original house proposals and evaluations — and on what
they have said during the hearings.
Hrench house Resident 112 ellow Kamal /.cm said the house
is "far I rom dead" and that many "friends of the house" are
hacking the appeal to Lyons.
Hester also said he has found considerable backing for
the house, both within and outside the French department.
"I think there are a lot ot people here who are supports e
ol the house, he said. "There's a general feeling of con
sternation among many people here who think that a lan
guage theme house is a good thing."
/.ein said he did not agree with the way the original
evaluation or appeal ol the decision were handled by ad
ministrators.
"Both Robinson and the Configuration Panel were ask
ing the wrong questions in the evaluation," he said. "They
stayed strictly with the problems that came out of the stal
ling situation and did not analy/e closely the cultural and
language aspects or the good programs and benefits that
come out of the theme."
