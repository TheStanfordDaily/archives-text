# Sun Devils fry Stanford
## Cardinal-9 drop three and No. 1 rank 
### Richard Martinez Sports Editor 
TEMPE — "This team has a lot of
heart." Thus was the description of
Stanford's baseball team by catcher
Bill Worden. The Cardinals, entering
last weekend's three-game series with
Arizona State ranked first in the na
tion. were swept by the Sun Devils.
There was a lot more to the weekend
in Tcmpc. however, than three losses
and a sure fall from the No. I national
ranking. After suffering Thursday
night's 34-2 embarrassment. Stanford
came back with some gutsy efforts but
still suffered two ninth-inning losses.
ASU took Friday evening's contest
11-10 and Saturday night's game
13-H.
The sweep places the Sun Devils
atop the Southern Division of the
Pacific-10 (the "Six Pac": Stanford.
California, ASU. Arizona, UCLA and
I JSC) with a 3-0 record. The Cards lind
themselves 2': games back with a 2-4
league record. Stanford's overall slate
now reads 14-5.
'We didn't quit'
Obviously disappointed with his
squad's winless weekend, head coach
Mark Marquess" reaction was not one
ol total despondency. " There was one
good point to the weekend: we didn't
quit. After Thursday night, we could'vc
been totally destroyed 10-1, 10-2. In
stead we came back real hard and
could've won both games.
"It's too early in the season. Wc can't
get too dejected — there's still 24
games left in the race. This league is too
tough and competitive for one team to
run away with it. I'd say the winner of
our conference will have a minimum of
10 losses."
Referring to Stanford's 34-2 loss.
Marquess said, "I could've kept the
game respectable but I would've had to
use five or six pitchers. We only travel
with seven, so we would have been in a
bind the next two games. II it were the
last game of the series it would've been
different."
Catalyst
Stanford played Friday night before
a hostile crowd that made quite sure
the Cardinals did not forget the hap
penings of the evening before.
The massacre seemed to be as much
a catalyst for a Stanford comeback ys it
was for the fans to taunt the team. The
Cards jumped out to an early 9-2 lead
thanks to a Bill Worden two-run homer
in the first inning and grand slam in the
third.
Battering ASU's Ken Jones for
seven runs in two innings, it looked like
Stanford might embarrass the Sun De
vils much the same way it had been
humbled. Cardinal pitcher Larry Kuhn
held ASU to two runs on two hits
through three and the crowd quieted
down with the sudden turn of events.
Playing at home is a tremendous ad
vantage and Arizona State may have
the greatest edge of all conference
teams. Packard Stadium has a very

hard, fast surface; the desert air helps
the ball carry lurtlier. and Sun Devil
fans are, to say the least, quite suppor
tive of their team.
ASU's great hitters take advantage
ol the field conditions and the crowd
takes care ol the opponents.
Both were quick to respond to five
Cardinal errors in the fourth inning —
the team with runs, the fans with
screams and shouts. The score read
Stanford ASIJ Sand everyone knew
a dogfight was in store.
The score remained unchanged until
the eighth inning when both teams
scored a single run. Cardinal second
baseman Paul /.uvclla put Stanford up
In two with a solo homer to left field.
The Sun Devils answered with one
scored on a double-single combination.
Ninth-inning showdown
Stanford went down in order in the
ninth and the Sun Devils came up to the
plate for the final time behind by one.
With Paul Grame pitching, Mike
Sodders singled to center to open the
inning. He was sacrificed to second lor
the first out and Grame struck out Russ

Stephans for the second nut.
Ricky Nelson, who went 3-for-4 with
a homer, was intentionally walked to
put the winning run on base. Lemmie
Miller, who struck out in his only other
time to the plate, hit a 3-2 pitch into
center, scoring both runners and secur
ing the series victory for ASU.
"After being embarrassed the first
game," said Worden, "we came back
and gave everything we had in the sec
ond game. After we lost that one, no
body really wanted to play the third
game. We had already lost the series
and we just wanted to go home and get
ready for USC (this weekend). I hat
loss was tougher than the first game."
Series finale
A disheartened Stanford squad gave
another great effort Saturday night,
however.
The Cards held an early 6-! lead
which the Sun Devils narrowed to 6-5
in the second. Exploding for five runs
in the fourth inning, ASU led 10-6.
Stanford tied the score in the tilth with
a four-run rally sparked by yet another
Worden home run.

Cardinal reliever George Lopez shut
ASU down from the tilth through
eighth innings and Sun Devil fireman
Jones did the same to Stanford from
the sixth to the eighth.
The game was to come down to
another climactic ninth-inning show
down.
Mike Dotterer singled home Dave
Meier with two outs in the inning and it
looked as it the Cards would return
home with a come-from-behind vic
tory.
But I ope/ gave up back-to-back
walks with one out 111 the bottom of the
ninth and Soddcrs followed with the
game-winning, three-run home run.
Stanford may have had bad breaks
with some of the umpires' calls, the
field conditions, the lighting and the
crowd, but the squad did its share to
help Arizona State along. Committing
15 errors during the series, the Cards
were guilty of more than half as many
blunders as they made through their 16
earlier games.
"Our pitching and defense weren't
too good this weekend," said Mar
quess. "The team's got loads of confi
dence, though, and you'll see 'em
bounce back this weekend at USC."

night's 34-2 embarrassment. Stanford
came back with some gutsy efforts but
still suffered two ninth-inning losses.
ASU took Friday evening's contest
11-10 and Saturday night's game
13-H.
The sweep places the Sun Devils
atop the Southern Division of the
Pacific-10 (the "Six Pac": Stanford.
California, ASU. Arizona, UCLA and
I JSC) with a 3-0 record. The Cards lind
themselves 2': games back with a 2-4
league record. Stanford's overall slate
now reads 14-5.
'We didn't quit'
Obviously disappointed with his
squad's winless weekend, head coach
Mark Marquess" reaction was not one
ol total despondency. " There was one
good point to the weekend: we didn't
quit. After Thursday night, we could'vc
been totally destroyed 10-1, 10-2. In
stead we came back real hard and
could've won both games.
"It's too early in the season. Wc can't
get too dejected — there's still 24
games left in the race. This league is too
tough and competitive for one team to
run away with it. I'd say the winner of
our conference will have a minimum of
10 losses."
Referring to Stanford's 34-2 loss.
Marquess said, "I could've kept the
game respectable but I would've had to
use five or six pitchers. We only travel
with seven, so we would have been in a
bind the next two games. II it were the
last game of the series it would've been
different."
Catalyst
Stanford played Friday night before
a hostile crowd that made quite sure
the Cardinals did not forget the hap
penings of the evening before.
The massacre seemed to be as much
a catalyst for a Stanford comeback ys it
was for the fans to taunt the team. The
Cards jumped out to an early 9-2 lead
thanks to a Bill Worden two-run homer
in the first inning and grand slam in the
third.
Battering ASU's Ken Jones for
seven runs in two innings, it looked like
Stanford might embarrass the Sun De
vils much the same way it had been
humbled. Cardinal pitcher Larry Kuhn
held ASU to two runs on two hits
through three and the crowd quieted
down with the sudden turn of events.
Playing at home is a tremendous ad
vantage and Arizona State may have
the greatest edge of all conference
teams. Packard Stadium has a very

hard, fast surface; the desert air helps
the ball carry lurtlier. and Sun Devil
fans are, to say the least, quite suppor
tive of their team.
ASU's great hitters take advantage
ol the field conditions and the crowd
takes care ol the opponents.
Both were quick to respond to five
Cardinal errors in the fourth inning —
the team with runs, the fans with
screams and shouts. The score read
Stanford ASIJ Sand everyone knew
a dogfight was in store.
The score remained unchanged until
the eighth inning when both teams
scored a single run. Cardinal second
baseman Paul /.uvclla put Stanford up
In two with a solo homer to left field.
The Sun Devils answered with one
scored on a double-single combination.
Ninth-inning showdown
Stanford went down in order in the
ninth and the Sun Devils came up to the
plate for the final time behind by one.
With Paul Grame pitching, Mike
Sodders singled to center to open the
inning. He was sacrificed to second lor
the first out and Grame struck out Russ

Stephans for the second nut.
Ricky Nelson, who went 3-for-4 with
a homer, was intentionally walked to
put the winning run on base. Lemmie
Miller, who struck out in his only other
time to the plate, hit a 3-2 pitch into
center, scoring both runners and secur
ing the series victory for ASU.
"After being embarrassed the first
game," said Worden, "we came back
and gave everything we had in the sec
ond game. After we lost that one, no
body really wanted to play the third
game. We had already lost the series
and we just wanted to go home and get
ready for USC (this weekend). I hat
loss was tougher than the first game."
Series finale
A disheartened Stanford squad gave
another great effort Saturday night,
however.
The Cards held an early 6-! lead
which the Sun Devils narrowed to 6-5
in the second. Exploding for five runs
in the fourth inning, ASU led 10-6.
Stanford tied the score in the tilth with
a four-run rally sparked by yet another
Worden home run.

Cardinal reliever George Lopez shut
ASU down from the tilth through
eighth innings and Sun Devil fireman
Jones did the same to Stanford from
the sixth to the eighth.
The game was to come down to
another climactic ninth-inning show
down.
Mike Dotterer singled home Dave
Meier with two outs in the inning and it
looked as it the Cards would return
home with a come-from-behind vic
tory.
But I ope/ gave up back-to-back
walks with one out 111 the bottom of the
ninth and Soddcrs followed with the
game-winning, three-run home run.
Stanford may have had bad breaks
with some of the umpires' calls, the
field conditions, the lighting and the
crowd, but the squad did its share to
help Arizona State along. Committing
15 errors during the series, the Cards
were guilty of more than half as many
blunders as they made through their 16
earlier games.
"Our pitching and defense weren't
too good this weekend," said Mar
quess. "The team's got loads of confi
dence, though, and you'll see 'em
bounce back this weekend at USC."
TEMPE — "This team has a lot of
heart." Thus was the description of
Stanford's baseball team by catcher
Bill Worden. The Cardinals, entering
last weekend's three-game series with
Arizona State ranked first in the na
tion. were swept by the Sun Devils.
There was a lot more to the weekend
in Tcmpc. however, than three losses
and a sure fall from the No. I national
ranking. After suffering Thursday
night's 34-2 embarrassment. Stanford
came back with some gutsy efforts but
still suffered two ninth-inning losses.
