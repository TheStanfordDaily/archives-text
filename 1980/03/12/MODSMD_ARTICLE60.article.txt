### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
The 12th Annual Martin Luther King, Jr. International
Freedom Games, to he held at Stanford Stadium from
March 18 through 23, could he the premier American track
and field event of the year, according to many observers.
Close to 3000 athletes are scheduled to participate in the
games, including students from SI colleges and 79 high
schools. Athletes from approximately 30 countries will also
compete in the events, traveling from China, Iceland, Italy
and Japan among other places.
Numerous track clubs and unattached individuals will
provide world-class competition as well.
Stanford track coach Brooks Johnson, director of the
1980 Games, commented that, "The number of particip
ants exceeds any original reasonable expectations we had."
Referring to the caliber of competition he added, "That
weekend â€” it's going to be the Valley of the Giants down
there."
The Games commence on Tuesday, Mar. 18 with the
running of the marathon, followed on Wednesday and
Thursday by the decathalon. The university and college
events will take place on the 21st, preceded by the high
school section on the 20th.
The weekend will get into full swing with the open and
invitational competition on the 22nd and conclude with a
half-marathon on the 23rd.
The Games will be filled with big names but perhaps the
biggest conglomeration of superstars will occur in the men's
100-meter dash, titled the "Century of the Century" by
Johnson. Ot the several present and former world record
holders who will compete in the race, the most notable are
Houston McTear, current world record holder in the 100
meters, and Steve Williams, world 100-meter hand-time
record holder.
Olympic gold medalists competing in the 100 include

Harvey Glance, winner in the 1976 Games, Steve Ricklick,
medalist on the 4xloo relay at the same Games, and Don
Quarrie, champion of the 200 in Montreal. Former 100-
meter world record holder Eddie Hart. AAU champion
James San ford and past Olympian Millard Hampton will
also take part in the race.
Riddick and Sanford will be running in the 4\ I ()() and
4x220 relays for the Philadelphia Pioneer Track Club and
USC respectively, as well. The two teams finished first and
second in the 4x220 at the Muhammed Ali Games in
January, both breaking the world record in the process.
Top women sprinters are also slated lor the meet. The
400-meter dash will feature world record holder Rosalyn
Bryant, current 400-meter AAU indoor champ, and I vc
ly n Ashford, who set world records in the 60- and 50-meter
dashes. The top ranked quarter-mile runner last year.
Sherry Howard, and Robin Campell ot the Stanford I rack
Club are scheduled for the event as well.
Hurdlers will likewise abound at the Games. I ee Evans, a
former Olympian, will run in his first race of the year: the
400-meter intermediates. Olympian Mike Shine, 11>76l l >76
silver medal winner, collegiate champions James Walker of
Auburn and Bart Williams of Cal Polv-SI.O, and USC
alumnus Rich Grcybahl will :ilso participate in the event.
The field events could boast the most prestigious athletes.
Four of the world's greatest shot putters will be visiting the
Farm: former world record holders Al Fuerbach and Ferry
Albritton, double Olympic Silver Medal winner George
Woods, and professional record setter Brian Oldfield. Na
tionally recognized high school putter Michael Carter will
also appear at the Games.
In the pole vault outdoor record-holder Dave Roberts
will be challenged by Steve Smith, former holder of the
indoor mark. The long jump will sport three of the world's
best: Larry Myricks. \rnie Robinson md R.nuK \Vil!';nn>
My ricks jumped the second longest distance on record at
27-leet-I I last year. Williams and Robinson both garnered
gold medals in the '72 and '76 Olympiads respectively.
One ol the most interesting confrontations might occur in
the high jump where Franklin Jacobs and Dwight Stones
will compete head on. Jacobs is the current world record
holder, breaking Stones' mark en route.
Strangely enough, one reason the Games are being held
at Stanford is because Johnson often lost at poker to Judge
Chauncey Lskridge, ex-director of the Southern Christian
Leadership foundation. Johnson explained that Eskridge,
a director ol the Games, owed him the favor for his losing
ways. "I looked around, saw that Stanford was the kind of
dignified place fitting for the Games, and hopefully they'll
become an annual event here," Johnson remarked.
In the past the Games have been held in Oslo, Norway;
Kingston. Jamaica: and Philadelphia.
As for how the University will benefit from the Games
Johnson pointed out, "We're not just trying to put on an
athletic event per se. We want to say something about
Stanford. We want to say that the attitudes, principles and
beliefs that Dr. King manifested in his life are represented
here.
"Mis life and death represent the best and worst of
Americans."
