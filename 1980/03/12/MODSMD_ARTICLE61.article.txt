## Ali: great hero or bigger ego 
### 
Haft-Baked Ideas
Thinking about Muhammad .\ll returning to boxing is like
thinking about somebody you loved a long time ago: she. or he. is
gone now. but wouldn't it be nice il . . .?
In the case ol Ali. however, fantasy has apparently turned into
reality. President Jimmy Carter's most popular envoy will likely be
fighting John Tate this June for the World Boxing Association
heavyweight title.
One is tempted to thoroughly chastise All lor his decision to
come out ol retirement. I irst ol all. there is his long layofl to
consider. Ali hasn't fought since September 15. 1975. when he
defeated Leon Spinksat New Orleans' Superdome to capture the
heavyweight crown lor an unprecedented third time.
Ah once waited three years between lights. But that was over a
decade ago. when Ins marvelous body still enabled him to punch at
three speeds: quick, quicker and quickest. Now his age is 3N. and
his waistline is ev en greater, (ictting back into lighting shape just
might be too much to ask ol Ali.
Second, many observers fear that Ali is risking not only embar
rassment by stepping into the ring again, but also his health.
In an item in Spoil Illustrated's "Scorecard." Ali is reported by
"friends" as hav ing slurs in Ins speech and a raspiness in his throat
that probably stem Irom the punishment he absorbed during his
career.
What is frightening is that Ali may wind up in the ring ev en il he
isn't physically prepared to light.
WBA public relations director Thomas Copas said recently that
Ali would have to beat a top-ranked heavyweight be lore lighting
Tate — a reasonable proposal. A preliminary bout would accu
rately measure All's litness lor lighting.
However. Saturday's Suit I raneisco Chronicle told of boxing
promoter Bob Arum's plan lor Ah to hold a "complete training
session" in April or early May in front ol WBA officials.
In the training session. Ali would spar 10 or 15 rounds with a
boxer Irom the WBA's top 10. This group includes such fearsome
contenders as Argentina's Domingo D'Elia (No. N) and Ohio's
Mike Koranicki (No. 4).
Alter watching the mock bout, the WBA brass would decide
whether Ali was ol top 1 0caliber. A positive decision allows All to
light Tate without a preliminary.
Now really, with millions ol dollars and the greatest name in
boxing involved, do you think the WBA is going to rule against Ah?
II you do. do me a favor and say "I Ii" to Santa Claus lor me on
your next visit to the North Pole.
With all this, the basic question remains: why does All need to
light again?
Irom the common-sense v lewpoint. it indeed seems absurd that
Ali should try to recapture the glory that was once all his. His ego.
apparently insatiable, wants more.
But when All calls lunisell " Hie Cireatest." lie's not lying. By
winning the heavyweight title three times. All's name became
synonymous with Ins sport. Moreover, he rose above his sport to
become a symbol ol Ins society. With Ins refusal to serve in the
Vietnam war. his flamboyant personality and his fabulous vic
tories. Ali not only transcended boxing but also represented the
world's turbulence during the 60s and '70s. People in all nations
idoli/c him — and still do. Wliv can't he be satisfied with that?
lie can't be satisfied because lie's a great athlete, and the most
dillicult thing lor great athletes to do is to admit that they are
through. I or a man with All's ego. this task would naturally be
almost impossible.
Sure. Ali is attracted by the paycheck ol siv million dollars or
thereabouts that lie would receive Irom lighting Tate. But iie is
also attracted by the throngs tlut chant Ins name in adulation, by
the chance to exceed even liintsell and win the title a fourth time
... by the chance to s;iy. once again. "I am the greatest!"
Ali is a great athlete, and lie is blessed — or cursed, depending on
how you look at it — with the tremendous ego and the fierce desire to
excel essential lor. and inherent in. all great athletes.
So Muhammad Ali is coming back. Well, better lie than (ierald
I ord or Richard Nixon. I'lic noises All will be making Irom Ins
training camp in the coming months should be entertaining, but
they may also be farcical. Still, whether or not he is a Don Quixote, he
ought not be denied Ins dream, l et him burst his own bubble, or vv rite
Ins name in uold.
