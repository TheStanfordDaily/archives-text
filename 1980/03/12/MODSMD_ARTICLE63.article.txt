# Trackmen sprint past Oxy, women edged
## 
### 
The Stanford men's and wo
men's track teams travelled to
Occidental college Saturday and
came away with one big win and
one close loss. The men trounced
Occidental 10N-46 and the
women bowed 144.5-140.5.
Both teams ran well and exhi
bited good progressive form for
this early in the season.
The men's victory was high
lighted bv Kick Muss who broke a

school record in the hammer
with a throw ol 206-0 thereby
qualifying lor the Olympic trials
to be held at the University ol
Oregon in June. What made the
event even more special at Occi
dental, though, was the competi
tion beween Buss and Ins team
mate Dave Thomson.
"The hammer throw was. tor
us, the ultimate competition."
said Stanford head coach Brooks

Johnson. "It was really great to
see Buss and Thomson go
against each other."
Thomson had held the Stan
lord record at the beginning ol
the year but since then it has gone
Kick and forth between them all
ison long. Buss broke the re
i 1 it the first meet this season
liomson took it back on his

Busk stole it again later in the
meet.
Overall the Cards won 16 of
19 events at the meet and totally
dominated competition. Garry
Shumway ran a sub-50.0 400 at
47.9 coming oil an injury and
John Schaer ran another SOO
meters under 1:50 lo win the
event at 1:49:6. The 400 relay
team, which reads like a Stanford
All-star football roster sporting
\ incent White, Ken Margerum,
Darrin Nelson and Ciordy
Banks, shaved its season best
I rom 49.59 to 4 1.2.
"Oxy wasn't that strong," said
Johnson. " They used to be con
sidered one of the best dual meet
teams in the nation. Obviously,
that's not true anymore. They
didn't provide competition
which was kind of disappoint
ing."
The Stanford women just had
one of those weird days. The
Cards won 10 of 15 events but
lost the meet. The problem was
that they only took 14 athletes
and even il they did finish first in
an event. Occidental would till
out the other places to win over
all. The women ran very well
though — the score ol 140.5 av
erages out to about 10 points a
Card.

" The women were the unfor
tunate victims of a scoring situa
tion," Johnson said. "1 hey won
the battle but lost the war."

Sprinter Gordon Banks raises his arms in triumph after breezing to victory in the 400 meters earlier this
season. Banks won the 200. anchored Stanford"s victorious 400-meter relay team, and finished second in
the 100 as Stanford romped over Occidental 108-45 last Saturday in Los Angeles.
The Stanford men's and wo
men's track teams travelled to
Occidental college Saturday and
came away with one big win and
one close loss. The men trounced
Occidental 10N-46 and the
women bowed 144.5-140.5.
Both teams ran well and exhi
bited good progressive form for
this early in the season.
The men's victory was high
lighted bv Kick Muss who broke a

school record in the hammer
with a throw ol 206-0 thereby
qualifying lor the Olympic trials
to be held at the University ol
Oregon in June. What made the
event even more special at Occi
dental, though, was the competi
tion beween Buss and Ins team
mate Dave Thomson.
"The hammer throw was. tor
us, the ultimate competition."
said Stanford head coach Brooks

Johnson. "It was really great to
see Buss and Thomson go
against each other."
Thomson had held the Stan
lord record at the beginning ol
the year but since then it has gone
Kick and forth between them all
ison long. Buss broke the re
i 1 it the first meet this season
liomson took it back on his

Busk stole it again later in the
meet.
Overall the Cards won 16 of
19 events at the meet and totally
dominated competition. Garry
Shumway ran a sub-50.0 400 at
47.9 coming oil an injury and
John Schaer ran another SOO
meters under 1:50 lo win the
event at 1:49:6. The 400 relay
team, which reads like a Stanford
All-star football roster sporting
\ incent White, Ken Margerum,
Darrin Nelson and Ciordy
Banks, shaved its season best
I rom 49.59 to 4 1.2.
"Oxy wasn't that strong," said
Johnson. " They used to be con
sidered one of the best dual meet
teams in the nation. Obviously,
that's not true anymore. They
didn't provide competition
which was kind of disappoint
ing."
The Stanford women just had
one of those weird days. The
Cards won 10 of 15 events but
lost the meet. The problem was
that they only took 14 athletes
and even il they did finish first in
an event. Occidental would till
out the other places to win over
all. The women ran very well
though — the score ol 140.5 av
erages out to about 10 points a
Card.

" The women were the unfor
tunate victims of a scoring situa
tion," Johnson said. "1 hey won
the battle but lost the war."
