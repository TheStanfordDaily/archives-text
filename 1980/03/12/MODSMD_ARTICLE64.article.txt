# Spikers split two on road
## 
### John Julius Staff Writer 
Entering last weekend, the
Stanford men's volleyball team
knew it needed a victory over
one of the better teams in the
California Intercollegiate Vol
leyball Association if it were to
get a berth to the NCAA region
als in May. The Cards have to
wait until I riday.
Stanford started the weekend
with a convincinu 15-9. 15-12,

15-3 victory over Cal Poly-San
Luis Obispo, but then fared as
expected against one of the top
teams in the countrv. Santa Bar
bara. 15-10. 15-10. 15-13.
The spikers knew they were
expected to beat SLO and so
went into that match determined
to win. "We hit well, serv ed well,
blocked well and played all
around good volleyball against
San Luis." explained senior Jack

I o\worth.
However, against Santa Bar
bara. they knew they were the
underdogs, and tailed to
capitalize when they could have
sent Santa Barbara scrambling.
Stanford led the first game 7-1.
but only managed three more
points. The second game was al
most a carbon copy, first leading
b-2 and then capturing only four
more points. "We didn't have
the killer instinct against Santa
Barbara that we had against
SLO." commented loxworth.
"The defense played as well as
we've played all season, but we
couldn't convert on the saves."
Stanford will have a good shot
at another powerhouse this I ri
day when they take on top
ranked UCI.A at Maples Pavil
ion. Although entering Friday's
match as severe underdogs, the
players know that they need
some solid performances if they
are to be invited to the NCAAs.
Stanford hosts L.oyola-
Marymount Saturday at 7:30
p.m.
