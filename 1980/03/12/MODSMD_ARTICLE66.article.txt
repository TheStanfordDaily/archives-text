## 
### Dianne Caboon Staff Writer 
The men's swimming team
finished sixth behind an array of
power-packed rivalries at last
week's Pacific-10 champion
ships in Los Angeles. UCLA
stunned defending champion Cal
for the title.
"Our guy swam great," said as
sistant coach Stu Corliss. "We
probably performed better than
any other team, relative to our
standing," he claimed in refer
ence to Ins team's 10 NCAA
qualifiers. Six of those men just
attained qualifying standards at
the Pac-10 meet.
On top of those achievements,
the Cards garnered five school
records during the three-day
competition — three of those
coming from swimmers who had
not shaved their bodies in prep
aration for this meet, but were
instead aiming for the NCAA
meet at Harvard over spring
break.
Team co-captain Monte
Brown had the most outstanding
swim ol the meet, according to
Corliss. Brown stroked to the
runner-up spot, behind UCLA's
world-record holder and Olym
pic champion Brian Goodell,
with a 15:10.1 in the 1650 yard
freestyle. In breaking the school
record of former Stanford lumi
nary Mike Bruner, Brown
knocked an incredible 35 sec
onds oft his previous best time of
the season and came down nine
seconds from his lifetime record.
He enters NCAA competition
seeded second behind Goodell.
Senior Ken Shilling broke his
own record with a 1:51.5-200
yard individual medley, while,
on the unslulved side. Wade
Flemons ripped two school re

cords in both the 100 and 200
backstrokes (51.2 and 1:49.6 re
spectively ). Freshman titan John
Simons copped another school
record of 3:59.2 in the 400 IM.
"We're looking for him to clean
up in nationals," asserted Cor
liss.
Aside from Demons and Si
mons, the only other unshaved
Card, Ban Weick. clocked "one
of the fastest unshaved times
ever recorded on this plant," in
the words of Corliss, in register
ing a 4:25.4 in the 500 free for
fifth. He nabbed another fifth in
the 1650 with his personal best
time and the third-fastest un
shaved time in the nation of
15:19.
Making national requisites for
the Cards were co-captain Tom
O'Brien in the 200 butterfly
(I:49.3)andthe4oo IM (4:00.6)
in two personal bests. Brown
also in the 500 free (4:27.0) and
the 400 IM (4:01.1 ), senior Bob
Hagberg in the 100 fly (49.5),
Mike Anderson in the 200 free
(1.39.07), Joe Jiminez in the
second-fastest 100 breaststroke
in Stanford history (56.5), and
senior Andy Nichols in the 200
breast (2:06.50).
Diver Bryan McCleve finished
eighth from the one-meter
springboard and tenth from
three meters in matches domi
nated by four Arizona State
leaders.
Heading into the nationals,
the Cards are hoping to regain
the top-10 stature they once
earned habitually but forsook
two years ago. "A top-10 finish
in the NCAA looks very reason
able," Corliss said. "Our times
are better than any other team in
the country."
