## Elway, Dotterer: phase two 
### Sally Jenkins Staff Writer 
Just call them Starsky and
Hutch. That's what they look
like ;ind that's the way they have
a habit of operating on the field.
John Elway and Mike Dot
terel', football season's wonder
kids, have become baseball sea
son's proteges as well. At right
and left field, with batting aver
ages ol ,2<Sft and .290 respec
tively, Elway and Dotterer seem
to be twins in everything but
looks. Moth have attacked Stan
lord athletics with enthusiasm,
exhibiting unorthodoxy border
ing, at time, on outrageousness
that has typified great Stanford
athletes in the past.
lioth Elway and Dotterer
come from exceptionally athletic
families. Elway is the son of one
Jack Elway, head football coach
at San Jose State. Elway Sr. was
formerly head coach at Cal State
Northridge, where he turned the
program around in three years,
takinu the team from 2-9-0- to

5-5-1.
II John Elway has a history in
football, Dottcrcr certainly has
his share of baseball heritage. He
is the son of Dutch Dotterel', a
major league catcher lor the
Cincinnati Reds during the
'50s.
Part ol the two athletes' suc

used to losing. Mike Dottcrcr
competed in both football and
baseball at Edison High School
m Huntington Bench, where he
was AII-CII in both sports two
years in a row, among other
things.
Elway had a slightly more il
lustrious career, liy the time he
graduated he was the most luglil)
recruited athlete in the nation.
At (iranada 1111 Is I ligh School he
was the city passing champion,
All-City in both football and
baseball two years in a row and
City-MVP in baseball two years
m a row. playing pitcher, outfield
er and ail occasional second

base. His junior year he went out
lor and made the varsity basket
ball team as well â€”just to see it
he could do it.
One can easily imagine the el
ders Dotterer and Elway playing
catch in the backyard with their
sons, like something out ol l.iiile
League Heroes. Moth Elway and
Dotterer did play Pop Warner
football and little l.eague
baseball, but both also deny
that their fathers pressured them
in any way when it came to athle
tics.
"He lias always been real good
about it." Elway said ol his
lather, "lie never pressed it on
me. IMaying sports has always
been my decision."
et he also admits that some
in 11 lie nee is bound to exist.
"When I was young I played
running back. As I got older my
lather started telling me that my
best position would be at quar

turned out. Tver since then I
