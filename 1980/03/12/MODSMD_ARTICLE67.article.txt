# From gridiron to diamond
## Elway, Dotterer: phase two 
### Sally Jenkins Staff Writer 
Just call them Starsky and
Hutch. That's what they look
like ;ind that's the way they have
a habit of operating on the field.
John Elway and Mike Dot
terel', football season's wonder
kids, have become baseball sea
son's proteges as well. At right
and left field, with batting aver
ages ol ,2<Sft and .290 respec
tively, Elway and Dotterer seem
to be twins in everything but
looks. Moth have attacked Stan
lord athletics with enthusiasm,
exhibiting unorthodoxy border
ing, at time, on outrageousness
that has typified great Stanford
athletes in the past.
lioth Elway and Dotterer
come from exceptionally athletic
families. Elway is the son of one
Jack Elway, head football coach
at San Jose State. Elway Sr. was
formerly head coach at Cal State
Northridge, where he turned the
program around in three years,
takinu the team from 2-9-0- to

5-5-1.
II John Elway has a history in
football, Dottcrcr certainly has
his share of baseball heritage. He
is the son of Dutch Dotterel', a
major league catcher lor the
Cincinnati Reds during the
'50s.
Part ol the two athletes' suc
cess at Stanford could be attri
buted to the fact that they are not
used to losing. Mike Dottcrcr
competed in both football and
baseball at Edison High School
m Huntington Bench, where he
was AII-CII in both sports two
years in a row, among other
things.
Elway had a slightly more il
lustrious career, liy the time he
graduated he was the most luglil)
recruited athlete in the nation.
At (iranada 1111 Is I ligh School he
was the city passing champion,
All-City in both football and
baseball two years in a row and
City-MVP in baseball two years
m a row. playing pitcher, outfield
er and ail occasional second

base. His junior year he went out
lor and made the varsity basket
ball team as well —just to see it
he could do it.
One can easily imagine the el
ders Dotterer and Elway playing
catch in the backyard with their
sons, like something out ol l.iiile
League Heroes. Moth Elway and
Dotterer did play Pop Warner
football and little l.eague
baseball, but both also deny
that their fathers pressured them
in any way when it came to athle
tics.
"He lias always been real good
about it." Elway said ol his
lather, "lie never pressed it on
me. IMaying sports has always
been my decision."
et he also admits that some
in 11 lie nee is bound to exist.
"When I was young I played
running back. As I got older my
lather started telling me that my
best position would be at quar
terback and that's the way it
turned out. Tver since then I

alway listen to him."
Dotterer also insists that being
an athlete is no special attribute.
"I think everyone gets involved
in athletics one way or another
— I'm just a little more competi
tive. that's all."
The two freshmen seem to
have dealt with the strain ot ath
letics and school at the same time
fairly well. Some problems could
arise, however, when spring
lootball and regular season
baseball conflict this spring.
Strangely enough. Elway will
be relieved when football prac
tice begins. He and Dotterer
plan to skip baseball workouts in
lav or of football practice, par
ticipating in only the baseball
games themselves. "Baseball
takes more time than lootball
does." Elway explained."! have
had a tougher time dealing with
baseball and school than I did
with lootball. so actually it will
be a little easier. Spring football
is a learning time, a little more
relaxed, whereas in baseball, we
just went into league play so
there is more pressure."
Things are not quite so simple
lor Dotterer. Me will continue to
play both sports also, but he lore
sees more ol .r problem. He
combines a somewhat worried
attitude with a blind faith in the

judgement o! his coaches. "I'm
sure coach Wiggin and conch
Marquess will work it out to
where it benefits John and I," he
slid confidently . "1 know I want
to play both sports equally, but
there are also limitations. 111 was
contributing and really helping
the baseball team — which I
think I can do — then the
coaches wouldn't pressure me.
But then again the football team
is going to have a new staff and
problems and I want to help out
there too."
And once again, things are not
so simple to Dotterer. 112 irst ot all.
he claims that Elway is in a more
difficult position, simply because
lie is the designated quarterback
lor next year at this point. Ol
himself lie said."l don't think it's
a problem for me. but I do have
to keep things in perspective. My
lirst priority is to ha\e a good
season in baseball: I ha\e to take
things one step at a time."
Though both athletes take an
"I do what I have to do" ap
roach. it is easy to get the impres
sion that it is harder than it
sounds.
Il the tra\esty in Arizona this
last weekend is any indication
(the Cards went 0-3), it would
seem the only thing that does
phase Elway or Dotterer is suc
cess. In fact, their attitude to

wards the baseball team's No. 1
rating before the Arizona trip
could explain, in part, the disas
ter.
"I feel we have the potential to
be one of the best teams in the
country." Dotterer said last
Thursday. "We have people on
the bench that can come in and
do just as good a job as the star
ters. But we have to keep our
objectives in mind. Baseball is a
game of peaks and valleys: the
team that is most consistent will
be the most successful."
Elway's remarks on Thursday
reflected that the team was
perhaps uncomfortable with and
even in awe of their new status as
No. 1. "Everyone is really sur
prised." he said. "Being a
freshman, it's hard for me to
judge our competition. It's sur
prising. It's a good feeling to
have." — he paused. "But at
times it can put pressure on you.
The team is handling it real well
under the circumstances."
So. once again, it seems that a
Stanford team and Stanford
athletes are perhaps intimidated
with the idea of success. One is
tempted to remember that fate
ful day in Oregon not too long
ago when everyone was talking
Rose Bowl. But perhaps Elway
and Dotterer and their affinity
for winning can change all that.
