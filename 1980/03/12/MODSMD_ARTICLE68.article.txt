# Net women romp in Arizona
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
In a pair of crucial conference
matches last weekend, the Stan
ford women's tennis team
overwhelmed Arizona 9-0
Saturday and crushed perennial
powerhouse Arizona State N-l
Sunday.
Head Coach Frank Brennan
was "extremely happy" with the
wins as they boosted the Cards'
overall season mark to 8-0.
"They are both pretty good wins
for us," he commented, "espe
cially since they came so easily.
We had a really good workout
down there — everyone played
exceptionally well. It was great
to beat them on their home turf
especially since UCLA just
played down there last weekend
and only beat Arizona State
5-4."
In Saturday's match, the Cards
waltzed through Arizona and
didn't drop a set. Alycia Moulton
played the No. 1 singles spot and
easily disposed of Marsha Bladal

6-4, 6-0. Donna Rubin crushed
Casey Esparzal in the No. 2 sing
les match 6-1, 6-0 and Sue Ras
mussen followed in the No. 3
spot with a 7-6, 6-2 win over
Beth Siegler.
Caryn Copeland played
number four and beat Jane Klin
gaman 6-3,6-3, while Gayle
Chan continued her hot streak
and smothered Karen Cooper
man 6-0, 6-2.
Brennan remarked, "Gayle
has continued to play well in the
No. 5 and 6 spots for us. She's a
walk-on —just showed up at the
tryouts and started beating
everybody and has been cooking
ever since."
l.isa Gordon closed out the
singles matches with a 6-3, 6-2
win over Sharon Lavan.
In the doubles, Moulton and
Rasmussen defeated Esparza
and Klingaman 6-2, 6-4; Cope
land and Rubin beat Siegler and
Lanita Cox 6-1, 7-5 and Chan
and Gordon topped Bladal and
Cooperman 6-4, 7-6.
The Cards continued their

winning ways Sunday and de
stroyed Arizona State K-l using
the same lineup.
Moulton handled Cheryl
Kawkins 6-1, 7-6; Rubin edged
Patti Schiff in three sets 6-2, 3-6,
6-3; and Rasmussen dismantled
Sue Clark 6-1, 6-0.
Copeland, who is just starting
to reach lull strength now after a
bout with mononucleosis, over
powered Tracey Stern 6-2, 6-1
and in a pair of three set cliff
hangers, Chan edged Jennifer
Bland 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 and Gordon
lost to Ann Steiger 2-6,6-1,7-5.
Stanford racked up three wins
in the doubles as Moulton and
Rasmussen beat Blan and Leslie
Hewitt 6-3, 6-2; Copeland and
Rubin clobbered Hawkins and
Clark 6-1, 6-4; and Chan and
Gordon defeated Schiff and
Stern 6-4, 6-2.
Brannan was pleased that his
doubles teams "were starting to
gel" as he foresees a real test for
the Cards in their next match —
The Brigham Young Invitational
Mar. 25-29 at Provo, Utah.
