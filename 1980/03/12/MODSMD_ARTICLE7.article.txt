# Students invest in presidential market
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
Traders canvass the lounge shouting "anyone buying
Kennedy's" and " Baker's tor tree;" while others wait anxi
ously for news of the three Southern primaries.
Anderson's chances in New York and Illinois are debated
over a cup of wine and a morsel of cheese.
While the setting isn't a traditional commodity exchange
floor, it does capture some of the flavor of its larger coun
terparts, the New York Stock Exchange or "the pit'' in
Chicago Commodities Exchange Market.
The trading hustle takes place on occasional Tuesdays in
the Graduate School ol Business lounge. Traders are part ol
the presidential aspirants market, where the fortunes of
I9NO presidential candidates are translated into monetary
gains and losses for the participants.
The market, set up by I'rof. Jeremy Bulowof the Business
School and MBA candidate Robert Slotpole, has received
national attention through the news media.
Each bond, which pictures a strutting turkey to indicate
the creators' opinion of the candidates, will be worth $5
only if the candidate named on the face should happen to
win the national election in November, according to Bulow.
Bonds were originally sold in January in I O-coupon sheets
for $5. II an investor held on to all 10 different bonds
matching the candidates Jimmy Carter, Edward Kennedy,
Ronald Reagan, John Connally, George Bush, Howard
Bake, Gerald Ford, Jerry Brown, other Democrat and
other Republican, after the election he would receive back
his investment plus interest, according to Bulow.
The main interest in the market comes from the secon
dary trading that takes place after the initial sale. Some
participants "trade for quick profits" as each candidate's
chances tor election rise and fall, according to trader Don
field.
There are about 150 students and 10 professors active in
the market, Bulow said.
I he market "adds spice to a presidential election year"
and is "an opportunity to make some bucks," said particip
ant Kenneth Eagle. I le and two friends have a few hundred
dollars invested in the market, he said.

The market has receiv ed so much attention because it has
"tremendous potential" as an instantaneous indicator of
candidates' relative strengths and weaknesses in the cam
paign. Eagle said.
"The efficient market theory of economics states that
prices in a market full) reflect all available information," he
said. "People with dollars at stake are motivated to make
accurate assessments of conditions."
The GSB Market is not the first of its kind. A similar
market was established early last quarter 111 the Economics
Dept. " There arc very few differences between the
Economics Dept. Market and the GSB Market," according
to John Shoven. a co-founder ol the Economics Market.
The GSB Market is "slightly more polished" and has
about three times as much money tied up in it, he added.
$3200 are invested in the Business School Market and
about $900 in the Economics Market. Bulow said.
Since price levels on the two markets tend to differ, some
opportunity for arbitrage exists where a trader buys a
bond in one market and sells it for a higher price on another
— between the markets, Bulow said.
Carter bonds are selling for about I 5 percent more in the
Economics Dept.. but "the effort probably is too large to
make a profit" in intcr-markct operations. Bulow added.
I he GSB Market was established with the approval ol
Acting Dean ol the Business School Robert Jaedicke.
"I approved the market with a little bit ol trepidation,"
Dean Jaedicke said. "1 can't say we have checked into its
legality with completeness." he added.
Since its main motivation is educational, he said that he is
"comfortable with it."
I he bond market "doesn tv iolate any serious laws,"
according to Law Prof. William Baxter. "It is not clear that
it doesn't violate any state gaming laws," Baxter added. "I
sec no possible legal action In the state." he said.
"We joke about the markets' illegality." Slotpole said." I
think it is illegal, but don't anticipate an\ problems," he
said.
C ounterleiting was one ol the main con. j ,s when the
market was first set up. Slotpole said. "We have gone to
great lengths to prevent it."he added. "We can trace all of
the original sales and thus know where bonds came from."
Slotpole. who has worked on Wall Sreet and also has
programmed computers tor business, set up the market
program tor the Business, School computer.
Students can get access to the computer using their Busi
ness School access numbers, and then can make offers to
buy and sell their bonds between trading sessions. Slotpole
said. The computer will give them the names and phone or
box numbers of other students who have made similar

fitters, he added.
The two big winners in yesterday's primaries showed
strength in the presidential bonds market prices. Carter
bonds were selling for about $3.00 and Reagan bonds for
$1.10.
Bush was tailing precipitously from around 70 cents t045
cents while Other Republican (now associated with John
Anderson). rested at 25 cents and 1-ord climbed slowly to 52
cents.
Kennedy sold tor about 30 cents. Brown for a penny and
ot course Baker and Connally were being given away.

the "under-the-counter" presidential candidate mar

election.

win big if they choose the winner of next November's
election.
Traders canvass the lounge shouting "anyone buying
Kennedy's" and " Baker's tor tree;" while others wait anxi
ously for news of the three Southern primaries.
Anderson's chances in New York and Illinois are debated
over a cup of wine and a morsel of cheese.
While the setting isn't a traditional commodity exchange
floor, it does capture some of the flavor of its larger coun
terparts, the New York Stock Exchange or "the pit'' in
Chicago Commodities Exchange Market.
The trading hustle takes place on occasional Tuesdays in
the Graduate School ol Business lounge. Traders are part ol
the presidential aspirants market, where the fortunes of
I9NO presidential candidates are translated into monetary
gains and losses for the participants.
The market, set up by I'rof. Jeremy Bulowof the Business
School and MBA candidate Robert Slotpole, has received
national attention through the news media.
Each bond, which pictures a strutting turkey to indicate
the creators' opinion of the candidates, will be worth $5
only if the candidate named on the face should happen to
win the national election in November, according to Bulow.
Bonds were originally sold in January in I O-coupon sheets
for $5. II an investor held on to all 10 different bonds
matching the candidates Jimmy Carter, Edward Kennedy,
Ronald Reagan, John Connally, George Bush, Howard
Bake, Gerald Ford, Jerry Brown, other Democrat and
other Republican, after the election he would receive back
his investment plus interest, according to Bulow.
The main interest in the market comes from the secon
dary trading that takes place after the initial sale. Some
participants "trade for quick profits" as each candidate's
chances tor election rise and fall, according to trader Don
field.
There are about 150 students and 10 professors active in
the market, Bulow said.
I he market "adds spice to a presidential election year"
and is "an opportunity to make some bucks," said particip
ant Kenneth Eagle. I le and two friends have a few hundred
dollars invested in the market, he said.

The market has receiv ed so much attention because it has
"tremendous potential" as an instantaneous indicator of
candidates' relative strengths and weaknesses in the cam
paign. Eagle said.
"The efficient market theory of economics states that
prices in a market full) reflect all available information," he
said. "People with dollars at stake are motivated to make
accurate assessments of conditions."
The GSB Market is not the first of its kind. A similar
market was established early last quarter 111 the Economics
Dept. " There arc very few differences between the
Economics Dept. Market and the GSB Market," according
to John Shoven. a co-founder ol the Economics Market.
The GSB Market is "slightly more polished" and has
about three times as much money tied up in it, he added.
$3200 are invested in the Business School Market and
about $900 in the Economics Market. Bulow said.
Since price levels on the two markets tend to differ, some
opportunity for arbitrage exists where a trader buys a
bond in one market and sells it for a higher price on another
— between the markets, Bulow said.
Carter bonds are selling for about I 5 percent more in the
Economics Dept.. but "the effort probably is too large to
make a profit" in intcr-markct operations. Bulow added.
I he GSB Market was established with the approval ol
Acting Dean ol the Business School Robert Jaedicke.
"I approved the market with a little bit ol trepidation,"
Dean Jaedicke said. "1 can't say we have checked into its
legality with completeness." he added.
Since its main motivation is educational, he said that he is
"comfortable with it."
I he bond market "doesn tv iolate any serious laws,"
according to Law Prof. William Baxter. "It is not clear that
it doesn't violate any state gaming laws," Baxter added. "I
sec no possible legal action In the state." he said.
"We joke about the markets' illegality." Slotpole said." I
think it is illegal, but don't anticipate an\ problems," he
said.
C ounterleiting was one ol the main con. j ,s when the
market was first set up. Slotpole said. "We have gone to
great lengths to prevent it."he added. "We can trace all of
the original sales and thus know where bonds came from."
Slotpole. who has worked on Wall Sreet and also has
programmed computers tor business, set up the market
program tor the Business, School computer.
Students can get access to the computer using their Busi
ness School access numbers, and then can make offers to
buy and sell their bonds between trading sessions. Slotpole
said. The computer will give them the names and phone or
box numbers of other students who have made similar

fitters, he added.
The two big winners in yesterday's primaries showed
strength in the presidential bonds market prices. Carter
bonds were selling for about $3.00 and Reagan bonds for
$1.10.
Bush was tailing precipitously from around 70 cents t045
cents while Other Republican (now associated with John
Anderson). rested at 25 cents and 1-ord climbed slowly to 52
cents.
Kennedy sold tor about 30 cents. Brown for a penny and
ot course Baker and Connally were being given away.
