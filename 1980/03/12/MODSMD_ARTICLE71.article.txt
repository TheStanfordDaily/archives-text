## 
### Rick Ostiller Staff Writer 
All five top-seeded teams
made it to the IM basketball fi
nals Monday night, but only two
ol those teams could claim
championships when the evening
was over.
BAD Company and Madera
walkedolt with the"B" and"C"
crowns, but Sleep and Dreams.
Hockey Red I and SLITS were
all beaten in their championship
showdowns.
In the men's "A" league: the
Theta Delts made it to the finals
by the thinnest ol margins. On
Sunday, they trailed LACE,
44-4 I. with only I 7 seconds re
maining in a semifinal contest.
After the Theta Delts scored to
close the gap to one. LACE twice
could not inbound the ball. The
lirst error did not hurt, as LACE
recovered the ball, but the sec
ond miscue did hurt as Jeff Ran
dall got open underneath to
score the game-winner for the
ITieta Delts in the final two sec
onds. Keith Level had 30 of the
45 points lor the Theta Delts.

In the other semi finals Sleepand
Dreams had no trouble beating
Loss Causation.
The Theta Delts, obviously
still psyched by their semifinal
win. came out flying in the finals,
running off to an 1 1-2 lead in the
lirst ten minutes. Although Sleep
and Dreams cut the lead to
17-1 1 at half; they were unable
to ever really get into their of
fense. When the Theta Delts
opened the second halt with
another blitz to take a 30-14
lead: the game was over. They
coasted to a 42-31 win.
In the men's "B" league, un
seeded Cedro's Running Rebels
streaked by in the
lower half of the draw to earn the
right to challenge BAD Com
pany tor the title.
In the linal, BAD Company
took the early lead behind Terry
Rennaker, whose 12 points were
the difference at the hall: 29-17.
In the second half, Cedro had to
foul and clutch free throws by
Rennaker and Todd Pickett sea
led the 52-44 vlctorv.

The women's" A" playoffs fol
lowed exactly to form until the
finals. 55N May field and theSub
stituents, the third and fourth
seeds, scored opening round \ ic
tories over Rob!e and the Ladies.
In the semifinals, top-seeded
Hockey Red I revenged an ear
lier loss to the Substituents,
30-21, while the second-seeded
Californians slid by 55M
May field, 34-32.
In the linals; Hockey Red I
soon learned the pattern of fa
vored teams winning was not
going to continue. The teams
stayed even lor most of the first
half, but six consecutive points
by Deedee Dolan put the
Californians ahead 22-14 at
halftime. Things got worse for
Hockey Red I in the second half
as the team could not score a
basket the first 13 minutes, while
the Californians went on a 15-1
blitz to put the game away. The
final score was 41 -25.
The women's "B" final pitted
top-seeded SLITS against the
third-ranked Larkin Leapers.
SLITS had no trouble advancing

to the finals, while Larkin pulled
a mild surprise with a semifinal
win over second-seeded Serra I.
The game began as though
SLITS was going to run and hide
as it ran off to a 10-0 lead. Larkin
did not get a point tor almost 10
minutes, hut when the Leapers
did finally score; they scored in
hunches; and at half they trailed
only 17-15. Late in the first half
Larkin had several chances to
tie, each time failing, and this set
a trend tor the second half where
Larkin never trailed by more
than lour points, hut where the
Leapers could ne\ er tie the game
either. With a minute remaining
and SLITS leading 2K-25. Lar
kin's Adrienne Duque hit a shot
and was louled. and tor the
umpteenth time Larkin had the
opportunity to get even. Duque
missed, but the Leapers got the
hall back on a turnover. As the
clock ticked inside 20 seconds,
Lea Ann Garrison nailed a 15-
I'ooter to send the Leapers in the
lead. The SLITS were unable to
iiet a shot and Larkin had taken a
29-2S thriller.
Based on what happened dur
ing the playoffs, the biggest sur
prise about the "C" finals bet
ween top-seeded Madera and El
Tigre was that the game never
got played at all.
Once the game did begin, both
teams were tight, shooting was
off, and Madera left the floor at
halt with a 12-11 lead, thanks to
10 points by Rick Geyer. In the
second halt El Tigre jumped
ahead and held the lead at 25-22
with two minutes left. Madera's
Geyer then hit a basket, got
touted, and converted the
game-tying tree throw. Madera's
press, which bothered El Tigre
all game, forced two turnovers
and Madera scored both times to
lead 29-25. El Tigre countered
with a hoop, but Madera hit two
tree throws in the final seconds
to hold on tor a 31-27 win.
