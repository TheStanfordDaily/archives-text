# Tankwomen to hit AIAW nationals
## 
### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
The women's swim team will
sacrifice Finals Week here to
tackle another type of supreme
test: the AIAW national champ
ionships in Las Vegas, Nevada,
Mar. 19-22. And the Cards are
looking for a good grade, prefer
ably in the form of victory.
Stanford enters the meet in the
enviable position of spoiler.
Emerging from a spectacular,
undefeated dual meet season,
they are ranked second behind

defending national champion,
Florida. Last year's meet ended
in a Flotida, Arizona State, Stan
lord dogfight of a finish, with
only IS points separating the
three.
"We're not picked first, but 1
think we have a decent chance at
winning," said coach Claudia
Thomas. "We have to have a
super meet all four days. But ev
erything's great; we look tre
mendous," she exclaimed.
The University of Texas and
USC are also predicted to pre

sent strong challenges for the ti
tle. Stanford edged Texas in a
hotly contested dual meet earlier
this year but did not meet USC
this season.
"USC is considered to have an
outside shot," Thomas admitted,
"but I'm not sure of their depth.
They have good times, but they
kept to themselves all year. It
should be interesting to see how
they will do." At its conference
championship meet two weeks
ago, USC upended ASU, the
fifth-ranked team and a close

early-season loser to the Cards.
Individually, "our only clear
cut winner is in the 50, 100 and
200 yard backstrokes," Thomas
said. World record holder and
Olympic veteran Linda Jezek
should easily sweep the 100 and
200 events, while she and
freshman Kim Carlisle will battle
for the 50 win.
Moreover, the Card relays will
pack a potent clout, and relays
are scored double in the meet.
"It's the first time we've had five
good relays," Thomas claimed.
