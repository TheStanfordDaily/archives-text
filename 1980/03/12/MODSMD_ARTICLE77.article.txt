Stanford quickly took a 4-0
lead when fullback Jamie Turner
scooted over the tryline early in
the first half. Turner (who scored
15 ol Stanford's I 1 ) points) tacked
on two more on the conversion
kick to put Stanford ahead by six.
Unfortunately. Stanford's ela
tion was shortlived as the game
turned rough and injuries began
to mount. I irsi. inside-center
Jack Bunce went down with a
broken collar bone. Bunce was
hurt on the very play that Turner
scored. Things got worse when
prop John Geisse, one of Stan
lord's most solid performers, in
jured Ins shoulder. However,
since two substitutions are al
lowed. both positions were re Ii I -
led. Nevertheless. disaster struck
once more when break "Wild "
Bill Schelander broke a rib late
in the second halt. Since no sub
stitutions were allowed, the
Farm boys were forced to plav
one man short for the rest ol the
game.
Despite the injuries, Stanford
continued to play well, spoiling
each Cal drive with excellent

counterattacks and managing to
put si\ more points on the board
belore halftime. Turner kicked
two I ield goals.
I lie second hall proved to be
as exciting as the lirst. I he Bears
appeared to rally when I imothy

halt opened
However, the Cards hung
tough even though the Bears
threatened to tie the game up on
several occasions.

All in all. the Stanford team
