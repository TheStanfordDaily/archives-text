# Aguirre tries to absorb loss

### 
I he Los Angeles Times
lEMPE. An/. — Mark Aguirre wasn't in the
locker room to hear his coach. Ray Meyer, make
that difficult hut obligatory speech, that a 26-2
season by De Paul could not possibly have been
spelit in \ain. Aguirre. this I 9-year-old man-child,
was doing Ins mourning in private.
Sitting alone on a ramp leading to a room where
equipment ol some nature is stored. Aguirre held
his head in his hands and sobbed. Ins massi\ e body
heaving, his life — for the moment shattered.
I inally. Aguirre. the best player on the ccrtilicd
best college basketball team in the land, limped on
a badly twisted lelt ankle toward the locker room.
"I wanted that championshipsdbad." lie said in a
whisper, not once but three times. A loser's litany.
He could not explain away Sunday's 77-71 loss
to L C I.A or De Paul's first-round elimination in
the NCAA tournament, one that many expected
the Blue Demons to win.
'"I don't understand." he said, over and over
again. I he pieces wouldn't lit.
But two doors down, in anothei locker room,
where I CI.A s basketball team was celebrating.
Kiki \ andeweghe took out a moment to reflect on
disappointment, an emotion with which lie is not
unlamiliar. He has seen before the same puzzle ol
round holes and square blocks. He knew what had
happened. He'd been there.
"I've been in the same position so many times."
\ andeweghe said. "I \e been there as a Ireshman.
as a sophomore, as a junior. I know what thev're
going through. It hurts to lose any time, but it hurts
especially when you think you can go all the wax."
It was almost exactly a year ago. when Aguirre
was a freshman, when De Paul was the upstart, t hat
the Blue Demons upset LCI A in the West Reg
ional final in Provo, Utah. This yeai I CI A was
the upstart, the underdog.
"I told my wife belore the game that I didn't

want to sec tins one,' I)e Paul coach Ray Meyer
s;iicJ. I guess I've been ;iround players too long. I
know their moods, their attitude. I could sec we
were sloppy
lie w. isn't taking anything away I rom UCLA,
which performed splendidly. Meyer knew, liow
e\er. that Ins team luid heen outhustled as well as
outplayed. Ile knew. too. that the pressure ol being
No. I. ol tearing a loss, was playing alongside the
Bruins against his team.
" I hey approached it just like it was another
game. \ andeweghe said ol l)e Haul. "I he same
thing lias happened to us helore. You get the feel
ing that il you just go out there that youcan't lose."
When l)e Paul got behind, it began to panic.
"We were so wild.' Aguirre said. "I don't know
how we got so out ol control."
\ andeweghe said he could see it 111 the De Paul
players' eyes.
" llicy were a little hurt (when they fell behind),"
lie said. " I'hey were a little bit scared. I knew
exactly what they were feeling."
But lor now. \ andeweghe could celebrate, and
hope that this. Ins last season, will be extended for
two more weeks. Mis has been the first class at
I ( I \ in memory that has lost a Pac-10 champ
ionship I \ cry one expects it to be the second not to
ha\e won an NCAA championship.
lie's a little bit like Ray Meyer, like Aguirre.
lime is running out lor Meyer, who's 66 and
winner ol 6(10 games but no NCAA title. Aguirre,
ol course, is much younger, but lie. too, is still
looking for that lust championship.
Aguirre was sitting next to teammate Bernard
Randolph, a close friend. I le was wearing a button
that read: "3 I-1 ."
Ihirty-one wins would ha\e meant a De Paul
championship. \s Aguirre and Randolph walked
oil together. Randolph Hipped it into a trash can.

I he Los Angeles Times
lEMPE. An/. — Mark Aguirre wasn't in the
locker room to hear his coach. Ray Meyer, make
that difficult hut obligatory speech, that a 26-2
season by De Paul could not possibly have been
spelit in \ain. Aguirre. this I 9-year-old man-child,
was doing Ins mourning in private.
Sitting alone on a ramp leading to a room where
equipment ol some nature is stored. Aguirre held
his head in his hands and sobbed. Ins massi\ e body
heaving, his life — for the moment shattered.
I inally. Aguirre. the best player on the ccrtilicd
best college basketball team in the land, limped on
a badly twisted lelt ankle toward the locker room.
"I wanted that championshipsdbad." lie said in a
whisper, not once but three times. A loser's litany.
He could not explain away Sunday's 77-71 loss
to L C I.A or De Paul's first-round elimination in
the NCAA tournament, one that many expected
the Blue Demons to win.
'"I don't understand." he said, over and over
again. I he pieces wouldn't lit.
But two doors down, in anothei locker room,
where I CI.A s basketball team was celebrating.
Kiki \ andeweghe took out a moment to reflect on
disappointment, an emotion with which lie is not
unlamiliar. He has seen before the same puzzle ol
round holes and square blocks. He knew what had
happened. He'd been there.
"I've been in the same position so many times."
\ andeweghe said. "I \e been there as a Ireshman.
as a sophomore, as a junior. I know what thev're
going through. It hurts to lose any time, but it hurts
especially when you think you can go all the wax."
