Randy Newman is one strange
fellow. But lie's no ordinary
weirdo. No ordinary deviate
draws hundreds of devotees. My
mission as reviewer Friday night
at Memorial Auditorium was to
determine why people like this
guy who wears J.C. Penney
brushed suede shoes onstage and
sings "chyin' " for "trying."
Stanford's Adlai Alexan
der opened the show for New
man. Alexander is an ac
complished vocalist and guitarist
and has one of the biggest, war
mest grins you've ever seen. His
songs are full of phrases that

spark in your mind. A special
woman Irom the hometown is a
renaissance princess — you En
tertain thoughts of a beauty
standing demurely in her garden,
until another line sparks a new
dream.
1 prepared for the task at hand
at intermission. I bought a Coke
and checked out the audience.
Everyone seemed to be in his
20s, I airly well dressed, no
punk rockers, no nerds, no
minorities. very leu overdosed
frat boys or hippies. No clues
about this Newman fellow.
Perhaps my hunch was cor

rect, that the most important fac
tor for his popularity is the
strange way he holds his head
while singing. He tilts his head
back, juts out his jaw and strains
his nose to squeeze out a gut
teral, nasal and semi
impedimented sound. He sounds
like a sedated Elvis Costello. The
whole scene is kind of fascinat
ing.
I don't think people come to
hear his voice. They come to
hear his observations. "Maybe
she's crazy, I don't know. Maybe
that's why 1 love her so," he
sinus. He says the reason Tonv

Orlando went nuts is because
nobody would sing along with
the choruses to "Tie a Yellow
Ribbon. - ' He comments on Bob
Dylan's attire at the Grammys.
He points out that God gets
cheap laughs out of watching us
thank Him for allowing us to sur
vive disasters He has purpose
fully put us through.
Songs don't necessarily have
to mean anything. We follow the
lives of two young Bostonians
who get married and move to
Santa Cruz where he works in a
carwash while she has a baby.
One day she goes to the doctor
and — oh no — she's pregnant.
Well anyway she dies. He moves
to L.A. and gets married again.
Thank you. Applause.
"I write this stuff but I don't
believe it,"he tells us at the start
(then notes that this is the key
difference between himself and
Bob Dylan. This is the only ex
cuse we receive for his inanity).
He enjoys singing about dirty
minded short people, "gypsy
thighs that pound and pound,
African appendages that almost
reach to the ground." "seven
ships without a sail, seven cats
without a tail."
The audience slumps in its
chair with a big grin on its face.
Tiny little toes — jeezuzzz. Then
Newman comes out with some
thing about "rednecks keepin'
niggers down" or mentions a
river that's so polluted, it's
flammable. A little food lor
thought along with our tea and
cakes.
Newman was without a back

up band. He buzzed away on
the piano with ingenuity, but my
mind had to till in instruments
for some songs, such as a bass for
a blues tune.
His love songs are not melodi
cally innovative, but they are ap
propriately slow and mellow.
What is innovative is a love sont:
in which he tells her to take oil
her clothes, nice and slow
that's right. Now turn on the
lights; all of 'em. and come over
here and stand on this chair. Now
wave your arms in the air
that's right. That's what love is
all about. I'd probably sit there
and listen even if Newman spoke
the songs.
He describes one groom's la
ment: he will carry heracrossthe
threshold only for her to laugh at
Ins mighty sword. They alwavs
laugh at his mighty sword. Why
must they laugh at his mighty
sword?
This Newman fellow is one to
be appreciated. So he's ugly. So
he can't sing. I le has insights that
arc worth spending an evening
with.
lie decided to play what he
considered to be a bad song, for
an encore. "I must really despise
you." he told us. Not true. New
man was simply bringing us back
from his intense little dream
world with a song that didn't
mean diddly. I don't know about
you. but I can't afford to spend
my days dreaming about naked
women Hailing about on chairs
and thinking up ways to get back
at those rotten short people.
