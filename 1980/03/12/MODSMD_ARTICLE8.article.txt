## Struggles could lead to civil war Anarchy reigns in El Salvador

SAN SALVADOR — The in
creasingly violent struggle bet
ween die-hard rightists and radi
cal leftists is making anarchy a
way of life in El Salvador.
As this Central American
country's political, social and
economic life continues to disin
tegrate, there are mounting tears
that this anarchy may he only a
foretaste of a full-scale civil war
to come.
El Salvador has become a
country where radical leftist
groups stage protests that look
like homecoming parades in the
American Midwest, replete with
brightly colored pompoms, bug
lers and drummers — except that
the teenagers directing the
crowd have guns in their book
bags and the banners that lead
the march call lor "prolonged
popular war or nothing."
Amid the festivity, everyone
knows that if the police or Army
appears there will be a blood
bath. It has happened so many
times before. The marchers are
frightened. The police and sol
diers are frightened. Somebody
is bound to start shooting — and
the soldiers have better guns, at
least for the moment.
A middle-aged man walks into
a hotel lounge and puts his wrist
bag on the bar with a heavy thud,
the butt ol a .3X caliber revolver
protruding from it. No one pays
much attention. Ciuns have be
come so commonplace in El Sal
vador that a sign at the airport
advises departing passengers

that they are being screened lest
they "accidentally" carry their
firearms on board the plane.
This particular man at the bar
said he needed the pistol at his
wrist, and the Israeli submachine
gun he carried in his car, because
he had made a lot of money in El
Salvador and his\ iews made him
a target of the left.
•"I'm not a capitalist and I'm
not a communist." he said. "I'm
a national socialist. You know, a
Nazi."
He and others like him feel, he
said, that the United States is
making a tremendous mistake by
backing the ineffectual
civilian-military coalition gov
ernment that has been promising
reforms and peace without
achieving either.
"We must kill all the snakes."
he said. Joining with like-minded
forces in Guatemala, who under
stood the real threat posed by
communists, he and his friends
would put an end to communism
in Central America and save the
United States from itself — "if
the U.S. will stay out of our
way."
The country is small and
crowded: 267 miles long and 112
miles wide, with 5 million people
now crammed inside its borders.
There would be no place to hide
in a civil war.
Demographics, moreover, are
at the root of many of El Sal
vador's problems. Half of the
people are under 17. and young
people see very little future for
themselves if the country's
economic and political struc

tures, where power and wealth
are in the hands of a miniscule
minority, continue as they have
for as long as their parents can
remember. According to local
officials, for instance. 70 percent
of the best land in the country is
owned by 300 families.
It is not surprising that the na
tional university is the headquar
ters tor most of the country's rad
ical leftist groups.
Those who try to take a middle
road between the extremists be
come the objects of attack from
both sides. Even acts of charity
are condemned.
A priest who found several
bloated bodies of torture victims
washed up on the beach near his
church was warned by local au
thorities to ignore them. When
finally, after several days, he
went ahead and burned the muti
lated corpses, he was denounced
by the left for failing to finger
print them so that they might be
identified as persons abducted
and killed by the armed forces.
El Salvador's newspapers and
airwaves are tilled with the con
flicting voices of revolution and
reaction as leftist and rightist
groups buy advertisements to
make their views known. One of
the strongest voices for modera
tion has been Catholic Ar
chbishop Oscar Arnulfo Rom
ero. whose sermons are broad
cast by a church-owned radio
station.
The young military officers
who last October ousted the
generals who had ruled the coun
try for decades said they wanted
to fight communism by imple

menting basic reforms, alleviat
ing the legitimate grievances of
the people while mounting a
serious counterinsurgency com
paign against Marxist guerrillas.
But even talk of the as yet un
implemented reforms has in
furiated the right, and the coun
terinsurgency efforts have
tended to look like brutal, often
indiscriminate oppression of the
left.
In the current atmosphere ot
chaos, many people are simply
giving up on El Salvador. Some
ol those may be the people most
needed by the country.
