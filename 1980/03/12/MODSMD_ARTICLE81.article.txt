# Near's mix of music and politics inspiring, thought-provoking
## 
### 
Holly Neat's concert last Wednesday was
warm and exciting, thanks to the enthusiastic
audience and the relatively small si/e of the
sold-out hall.
Attended h> a predominantly lemale audi
ence in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, the concert
featured the rich, soulful piano accompani
ment of Stanford graduate Adrienne Tort, and
the old-time-bluegrass music of Robin I lower,
Laurie Lewis and Nancy Vogl.
Near displayed the full versatility, depth and
range of her strikingly appealing singing voice,
and combined it with her equally striking poli
tics. This riveting mixture was alternately in
spiring and rhetorical, but always thought
provoking.
The concert was part of the first tour in which
Near has used Torf as an accompanist and been
backed up extensively by Flower's band. He
spite occasional flaws, Torfs playing fit in
beautifully with Near's crystal-clear voice, un
derlying it with an accomplished warmth.
The back-up arrangements were welcome
additions, usually tight and well rehearsed.

However, they occasionally needed more
work, or battled Near's voice for prominence.
Sound adjustments made for short but fre
quent delays, but the humorous, affectionate
rapport among the musicians made up for the
production's weaknesses.
l or the first few numbers, Near lacked her
usual sparkle, but soon began to warm up dur
ing her forceful rendition of "Kentucky
Woman/Mountain Song," which expressed in
dignation at strip mining. The back-up
sounded bad in spots, but showed its potential
in the song's searing end.
At this point. Near discussed registration for
the draft, saying that women arc being added to
the traditional "cannon-fodder" (working
class and minority men). "We're not going to
fight a war that we don't make up or profit from
and has nothing to do with our lives," she said.
Near followed with the moving title song to
her latest album. Imagine My Surprise, which
she wrote "when I first discovered that there
were, in fact, women on this planet, and had
been for quite some time." Expressing the joy

of lesbianism, the emotional song benefited
from a nifty back-up arrangement, although I
eoukin t help thinking \ iolins would have been
nicer lor this'loving song.
The spicy back-up for "Working Woman,"
however, was delightfully appropriate. Assert
ing office worker's right to dignity in the face of
belittlement and sexual harassment, the song
was well-received, in light of the current or
ganizing efforts ot University office stall mem
bers.
In Near's torchy rendition of "Somewhere
Over the Rainbow." her sultry wispiness kept
the audience hanging on until the powerful
ending. Whether or not one agrees with her
politics, this song proved that she's got one of
the best damn voices around. A riite touch was
added by Torf s piano and Lewis on string bass.
"Old Time Woman" was a bouncy look at
what young and old people can gain from each
other. In "Something About the Women,"
Near sang of the courage she gains from physi
cally disabled people, reformed alcoholics and
large women who have the guts to be "fat and a

little obnoxious."
Especially touching was the moment when
Near taught the audience to hand-sign,, the
Ivrics of the chorus. The entire concert, in fact,
was presented for the hearing-impaired
through the dancing hands and expressions of
Sandra Faulkner.
Most of the audience sang along to the anti
rape song, "Fight Back," as well as "Gentle,
Angry People." In this song, Near encouraged
the audience regardless of sexual preference,
to sing "we arc a gay and lesbian people," to
remove the stigma from homosexuality.
The concert reached a high point when Near
was joined unexpectedly by another woman's
singer, Rhiannon, for a wildly euphoric version
of Cris Williamson's "Waterfall."
Near finished with "Golden Thread," a ten
der song exploring aspects of monogamous and
open relationships, and "American People,"
an anti-nuke song by Sweet Honey and the
Rock.
For her encore, Near sang a stunning med
ley, without accompaniment, including "Ain't

Nowhere You Can Run." (an anti-nuke song).
"It Could Have Been Me," and part ol
"Nicolia," which the audience kept singing
after she left the stage.
The opening act was a light, entertaining set.
led by Flower on fiddle, acoustic guitar and
mandolin, along with Lewis on fiddle and Vogl
on acoustic and bass guitar.
Beginning with a lively old-time medley,
they progressed to the bluegrass tune, "Knoc
kin' On Your Door," some Louisiana Cajun
music and an old populist party song, "Old
Home Place." Especially pleasant were
"Limerock" and "Incantation," a ja//y soft
rocker exalting mother earth in the spring.
On the whole, although it could have been
tighter and more professional in places, the
show "Holly Near and Friends" captured the
audience with its invigorating combination of
musical diversity, optimistic politics and com
forting genuineness.
