The Eagles: quintessential rock hand of the
19705. When psychedelic, revolutionary rock had
burned itself out. and when the war itself finally
ended, the frenzy of the '60s was replaced by a
melancholy mellowness, a wised-up, embittered,
but humorous defensiveness. The nation turned
away Irom California's golden-haired flower chil
dren, away from the East Coast establishment that
had begun and lost a long war. and looked instead
to the heartland, the proud Rockies and wide
plains ol the Midwest. The Stetson hat replaced the
headband; boots followed in the tracks of sandals;
and the pickup truck edged aside the old VW van.
We turned away from the essentially European
myth of revolution, away from the Asian myth of
enlightenment and universal love, and embraced
the older, safer, purely American myth of the faded
Wild West. We became, once again, a nation ol
cowboys.
