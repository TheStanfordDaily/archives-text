Of course, the mirrors we hold up to ourselves all
have a source. And sometime in 1973. Beverly
Hills. Hollywood. LA. the nation's hired dreamers
gathered in twilight rooms overlooking eucalyptus
groves and spreading city lights to conjure this new
mythology for us. And so months later, in Dayton.
Ohio, the graduate student of Kent State, now a
construction worker, looked up from his game of
pool and listened to the new song telling him what
to be: a wised-up loner, an aging cowboy leaning
on a fence post, squinting with Coors or Coke
brightened eyes into the details of a sunset. And a
thousand miles away, the 28-year-old law\er guid
ing his Porsche over the Golden Gati Hridge to
home and hot tub in Marin, flicked on his radio

and changed to the same tune.
The message: take it easy, take it easy. Let Asia.
Europe and the world rot away around you. Be
hind your purple mountains, in your endless waves
of grain, you are an American. A cosmic de
sperado.
