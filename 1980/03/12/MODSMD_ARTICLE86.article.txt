Below the stage, the dark crowd waves, cries out,
sends fireworks streaking to the ceilmg, clicks Bics,
throws dayglo Irisbees. smokes dope, and tries to
elude the Bill Graham ushers.
"And now." twangsGlenn I rev. "a story I never
get tired of telling."
City girls just seem to find out early
How to open doors with just a smile . . .
The band slides through "Lyin' Eves" into "De
sperado." The crowd — a very young crowd —
cheers uneasily. They want more volume, more
velocity. A huge banner snakes through the aisles:
"Joe Walsh for Pres." They are craving Joe
Walsh's fast guitar, and slowly, slyly, the Eagles
give it to them. The pace picks up. Timothy Schmit,
formerly with Poco, lays down a solid, driving bass
line. I rom "One til 1 liese Nights," the band crashes
into a positively acid-rock number ol Bernstorm.
Now the crowd comes alive. The ushers retreat,
probably under orders, and a mob surges down the
seats, into the wide aisles near the front of the
stage. Joe Walsh stands in the spotlight and
launches into a spiralling solo. This isn't mellow.
This is rock, and the crowd loves it.
