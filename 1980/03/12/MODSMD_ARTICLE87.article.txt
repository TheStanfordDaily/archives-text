So. as we slide into the '80s ourselves, a new
myth begins and the Eagles are trying to get inside
it. Will they succeed — riding with new wave into
the new decade?
No. they will not. In spite of the fury they can
generate onstage, the Eagles will probably not sur
vive for the simple reason that they are too good.
The new wave bands are bringing back the harsh,
astringent amateurism of the early '60s — early
Stones, Beatles. Kinks. The new myth has no shape
yet, but one thing is clear: it has no room for
melancholy cowboys. If the '70s were a kind of
refuge, then the Eagles, like the rest of us, will have
to pay a price. And the '80s w ill probably find them
playing with Elvin Bishop and Jerry Garcia at the
Keystone and Old Waldorf.
