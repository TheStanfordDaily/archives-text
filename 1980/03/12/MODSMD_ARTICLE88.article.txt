# 'Absent Friends' CAT winner
## 
### 
What's in a name, you say?
Well, some dramatists can't
seem to get along with just one.
Richard Wagner called himself
the Aeschylus of Bayreuth. Un
fortunately, he wasn't. Alan
Ayckbourn. through no fault of
his own, is often called the Neil
Simon of Britain. Fortunately,
he isn't.
Ayckbourn, Britain's leading
comic playwright of the moment,
gives us a world resembling Si
mon's on the surface. But
Ayckbourn's world has an un
derside. a real, snarling life, in Ins
characters' minds. A trip into the
mind of a Neil Simon character
reveals, at best, a lonely whimper
or a smug smile.
Ayckbourn's advantages can
be seen in Absent Friends, cur
rently being given a highly pro
fessional production by the
California Actors Theatre. Ab
sent Friends is not his best play;
he sacrifices his usual

pyrotechnics in an attempt at a
more strictly verbal farce, and
the result is just superficial
enough to be irritating. But there
is still more to laugh at. and just
as much to think about, than in
the collected works of his
American counterpart.
The action of Absent Friends
takes place in a single afternoon,
never leaving Diana and Paul's
suburban li\ing room. Diana
knows that Paul has been sleep
ing with Evelyn. So does John,
Evelyn's husband and Paul's best
friend. He doesn't care, so long
as Paul keeps placing orders for
his cat food. Marge, Diana's best
friend, knows too. She wishes
she didn't — she has enough to
worry about, what with Gordon,
her 300-pound husband, at
home bursting his hot water bot
tle.
They have all (with the excep
tion of Gordon, who hasn't been
out of bed for three years)

gathered tor a tea party. Colin, a
former boon companion of John,
Paul and Gordon, is returning
after several years' absence.
When he left, Paul and Diana
were young lovebirds, Gordon
was an aspiring cricketeer and
John was a real go-getter. Since
then, Colin has joined a bank,
fallen in love, become engaged
and seen his fiancee dead from
drowning. Diana decides it
would be nice if all his old friends
gathered to show their support.
But just as Diana is the only
person bothered by the fact that
her husband and Evelyn spent
Sunday in the back seat of his
car, she is also the only person
who wants to be at the tea party.
Everyone is having too much
trouble muddling through the
present to appreciate a voice
from the innocent past; and
everyone is too sorry for them
selves to have any sympathy to.
spare for Colin.

Colin, as it turns out, needs
none. He's had the love of a
beautiful girl, and even if she's
gone, he's had more than he evei
deserved out of life. He's happy.
And there's the rub. Because
Colin assumes that John, Paul
and Gordon must be happier
than he, having had the love of
their beautiful women so much
longer than he had a chance to.
He doesn't recognize the sad
state their lives are in, and, ot
course, he doesn't realize that the
same thing could well have hap
pened to him had his fiancee lived.
He exits unsinkable, after having
served as the catalyst of a
thoroughly disastrous afternoon
for everyone else involved.
Absent Friends doesn't ac
complish much besides pointing
up the contrast between youthful
dreams and rueful realizations;
none of the characters, except
possibly Colin, are more than
two-dimensional, and neither
their plights nor Colin's happi
ness engrosses the viewer. But
Ayckbourn has given the whole
affair such a high comic polish
that we never have time to think
of such things.
The CATs production, under
the able direction of Dakin
Matthews, brings out every gem
in the script. No cast members
stand out. because all work to
gether so well; there are several
scenes with seven people on
stage, all talking at once in diffe
rent directions, and never a line
is lost. Catherine Butterfield,
who plays Evelyn, sticks in the
mind mainly because she gets the
best lines; she leaves her baby, in
its bassinet, in the yard, and later
says, "I'd better go check the kid.
It's raining outside."
The current Ayckbourn craze
in this country is well-founded,
as crazes go, and Absent Friends
at the CAT is a golden opportun
ity to get to know this dark, but
hilarious, playwright.
