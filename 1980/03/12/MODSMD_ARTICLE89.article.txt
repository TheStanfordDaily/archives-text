# Kuumba Art Ensemble play
## 'Bogey' strong and to the point 
### 
The Song of tlte Lusitanian Bogey is the
kind of play that does not want you to misun
derstand its message. It is a polemic on the
e\ils of colonialism in Africa, written hy
Peter Weiss during the initial stages of the
war lor liberation in Portugal's Lusitanian
colonies ol Angola and Mozambique. The
play was written at a time when the West was
still supporting Portugese domination
through the provision of arms and corporate
investments.
The play is a propaganda piece that could
have been written by Brecht. All of the
characters are nameless; their only purpose
is to shock the audience into action. The play
is a series ol skits outlining the history of the
Portugese colonial empire.
The almost all black audience that showed
up to see the Kuumba Art Ensemble's pro
duction at the Little Theatre last week obvi
ously drew parallels to the situation in South
Africa and to racism in the U.S. The audi
ence was not passive but clapped and
cheered whenever a strong statement was
made.
The play was performed on a bare stage,
the only prop being a large silvery mask co

vered with aluminum foil in the center of the
stage, an ogre with an evil look and red light
bulbs for eyes that when lit in total darkness
gave an eerie atmosphere. The mask rep
resented the white man. and through its
mouth spoke the voice ol authority, the Por
tugese master pushing the line of "God.
country and family."
They play 's truly innovative aspect was the
interchange ol the cast between colonialists
and coloni/ed. One minute you would be
looking at a man. who had just arrived from
the mines, in despair because his wife had
been taken away and brutalized: the next
instant you would be looking at a cocktail
party in a posh Portugese house.
Many aspects ol the play were very vio
lent: you see a pregnant woman squirm on
the stage after being kicked in the belly, you
see villagers shot because they dared to pre
sent a petition lor better schooling, and there
is a good deal ol police brutality. I lie first
hall ol the play is so lull ol this that you leel
saturated, but most ol all you shake your
head in disbelief. Can people treat one
another in this way? This is exactly what you
are meant to think.
The second half of the play is more factual

than the first: tacts and figures are thrown at
you about the inequality of the colonial sys
tem. the lack of education for Africans, in
equality of wages tor equal work, the condi
tions in the mines, the passbook system, all of
which holds true in South Africa today.
There is even a humorous episode of a vil
lager coming for the first time to the city of
Nova Lisbon, his mouth hanging wide open.
I lis naivete gets him a beating by the police.
The Kuumba Ensemble's production
lacked professionalism: the acting was un
even. hut the interaction with the audience
made up for it. At no point did you think that
you were in Africa, but illusion was not the
point of the play. The parallels between the
racism ol the Portugese and racism in the
U.S. were made very clcar by the ensemble,
especially with regards to the Portugese ideal
ol assimilation, of "civilizing" the African
into their value system.
I lie toppling of the symbol of white power,
the mask, ended the play.
The Kuumba Arts Ensemble is a student
and community performing arts organization
associated with The Committee on Black
Performing Arts.
