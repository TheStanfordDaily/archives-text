### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
In the Islamic state envisioned by Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, there is "no
freedom to he non-religious." said Religious
Studies Prof. Lawrence Berman at Bechtel
I-Center last Tuesday.
In practice, however, "there is a tendency
to accommodate other religions." especially
Judaism and Christianity, which share the
Old Testament with Islam as a primary
source, he told it luncheon audience of N5.
Nonetheless, the vision of widespread re
ligious freedom lor such faiths as Hinduism
and Bahai is "troubling practically," he said.
Khomeini's ideal Islamic government is a
divine theocracy, in which God rules through
its leaders, Berman said. It is viewed as a
restoration ol the Utopian seventh century

reign of Mohammad, and "there would be no
separation between religion and state: ls
lamic law would be the law of the land." he
said.
Basing his discussion on it book of Kho
meini's lectures published in 1969, Berman
said. "For Khomeini, Islam is not passive,
but activist in nature. The religious leader
should have executive power."
Imperialism, and to a lesser degree
Zionism, are Islam's enemies for Khomeini
because they exploit Islam's lands and per
petuate the "passive" Moslem stereotype, he
said. By subordinating Islam's authority to
his own. the former Shah, "a naive
megalomaniac," was an agent of im
perialism. In this sense, Khomeini is an Ira
nian nationalist revolutionary with "a clear,
practical understanding of the use of prop-

Uganda," said Bcrman.
The ayatollah's support derives from the
strong hold of the "twelver Shi'ism" sect of
Islam, whose ideology he represents. In a
tradition of belief in Allah-sent leaders for
each century, many Iranians consider Kho
meini this century's "redeemer," or
"Imam."
Despite his authority, Khomeini is not
power-mad, said Berman. "He would like to
give as much power as possible to (new-
President Abolhassam) Bani-Sadr and the
newly-forming parliament, but he will surely
have veto power." While Khomeini does not
recognize the need for a legislature, he envi
sions a policy council to apply Islamic law in
cases in which the law isn't clearly connected
with the modern-day situation, Berman said.
