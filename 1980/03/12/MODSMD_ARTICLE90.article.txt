# All That Jazz
## Fosse dances uneasily over his own death 
### 
Boh Fosse's All That Jazz, ;i
thinly veiled examination ol his
own lite and death, is the kind of
sell-indulgent mistake that
seems to be doomed to tail. It's a
measure ot 112 osse's considerable
talents that he avoids that result:
while7(/rc isn't very good, it isn't
a disaster either.
Fosse never attempts to dis
guise the movie's strong au
tobiographical elements. 1 ike
Joe Gideon, the central charac
ter in the film. Fosse is known for
his consumption ot booze,
cigarettes and women. Fosse,
like Gideon, is a choreographer
and film and stage director ot
overwhelming talent who's con
stantly battling to top himself.

fosse had open heart surgery —
and one of the movie's major
sequences depicts Gideon's own
operation.
Just to make sure you haven't
missed the point, the movie Gi
deon is finishing is clearly similar
to Lenny, Fosse's movie ahout
Lenny Bruce. Cliff Gorman stars
m both Gideon s movie and the
stage play which served as the
source ot 112 osse's movie.
Roy Scheider, who plays Gi
deon, serves as both the physical
and emotional embodiment ot
fosse. Scheider's character is
rather broadly sketched, but he
successfully captures a man
who's always on. a man ol talent
who finds his greatest struggles
and greatest enjoyments 111 that
talent.
But lor all that, Fosse's por
trayal of himself is hardly self
glorifying; in fact. Fosse's so in
tensely self-critical that it's hard
to develop a relationship with
Gideon. You almost feel as il
you're intruding on something
intensely personal.
I lie mm ie's most stilted when
it deals with the present; Fosse
does manage to erect some bar
riers around himself. The sur
realistic flashback scenes are
more effective, almost as fore
play before a final consummation,
Scheider discusses Ins life with
Jessica Lange, who plays a
tempting angel of death.
Frustratingly, the movie flue-j
tuates wildly — it's both self
conscious, and dazzling and bril
liant. The often extraordinary
musical sequences typify this. It's
hard to think of something more

self-conscious than a huge dance
number done to your own open
heart surgery, and the show-biz
schmalt/iness with which Fosse
stuffs the sequence borders on
sell-parody.
But Fosse can stull more into a
dance number than anyone; the
visual chut/pah of this sequence
is enough to overwhelm you. but
fosse's llashiness and absolute
command of style are infectious
in themselves.
Fosse's described himsell as "a
show-biz hack with a touch of
artist in me." And fosse's solu
tion for the problems posed by
his near-impossible conception
is to play up the show-biz bigger
than ever. It'san increasingly dif
ficult struggle lor Fosse — he
seems to have lost much of his
sense ol humor in the process.
That's a definite dampener
here; Fosse wants you to enjoy
the show-biz celebration he tries
to create, but he takes himself so
seriously that you feel as if you
shouldn't make any noise.
Many directors would be con
tused by a project like All That

Jazz; others wouldn't have at
tempted it. But Fosse seems to
be aware of the problems he
laces — perhaps he knew they
were insurmountable. But Pos
se's instincts have a genius ol
their own: in the splashy closing

number, fosse celebrates his
death with a crashing and rock
ing song and dance, l or all its
force. Jazz is an uneven ac
complishment. but at least fosse
attempted to take it to the hilt.
