# Neil prime for prime time
## 
### 
Alter California Suite and The Prisoner oj Sec
ond Avenue, you would think Neil Simon would
have had Ins till ol middle-age upper-class situation
comedy.
Apparently not.
Chapter Two, his latest film, has one of those
cutes\. insubstantial plots that leaves you shrug
ging your shoulders in indifference. Marsha Mason
plays an actress dr mv who, after five years of
analysis, is revelling in the joys of "feeling good
about herself again." Through a series of overly
clever and witty telephone conversations, she
meets a recently widowed James Caan.
As we all predict, they euphorically fall in love
and marry. Starting their marriage off on the right
foot, Caan takes Mason to honeymoon in the same
beach resort where he and his recently deceased
wile had. Needless to say, Caan wallows in painful
memories, becoming more and more depressed
until he finally takes off for (of all unlikely places)
Los Angeles to recoup.

He, as we all could have guessed, returns the
following day to find in a tearful Mason his ticket to
eternal happiness. Hmmm .
The dialogue, at times, is tunny, punctuated with
some choice one-liners that unfortunately serve
too often as periods rather than commas, breaking
up the script's momentum. Mason plays her stan
dard goody-goody role, custom written by her ex
husband Simon, no doubt. Caan handles the
character ot George Schneider well considering his
lack of experience doing comedy. But all the run
ning around Bahamian markets and beaches in the
world wouldn't make them work together any bet
ter. One marvels at the shallowness of their rela
tionship, and actually believing that they'll live
happily ever after in the end is difficult even for the
fairy tale fan in all of us.
All in all, you just can't look for much substance
in Chapter Two: but it definitely has all the makings
of a great prime-timer. So save $4 and wait until it
comes to T.V.
