# Chinese art slowly faces the future
## 
### 
Chinese art is recovering from
the 10 had years of the cultural
revolution which ended in 1976,
according to Michael Sullivan, a
well-known authority on Orien
tal art and professor here.
"The Chinese are reaching out
in all directions, for everything
decorative, realistic or useful,"
said Sullivan as he sat behind the
desk of his office, which is full of
hooks on art, many of which he
has written.
"Until the death of Mao in
1976 there was a lot of rather
heavy propaganda art. Some was
inspired by the Russian model,
and there was an experiment in
using the traditional Chinese
technique on modern subjects."
Go>ernment policy
Government policy has
changed several times. "The
Hundred Flowers Movement in
the 1950s was when many artists
and writers were invited to
bloom, and then they suddenly
discovered that they were not
flowers, but poisonous weeds."
The Cultural Revolution turned
against the artists, and many
were sent to the country. Some
were forbidden to paint; others
were forced to paint very con
ventional pictures.
There are two interpretations
of why this happened, according
to Sullivan. One is that Mao
genuinely believed that if he
gave people freedom that they
would all express their love for
the new system in their own way.
The other is a much more sinister
explanation, that it was a way of
rooting out subversion. Sullivan
thinks it was both.
Subversion
It is hard to see what subver
sion there is in a painting. Sulli
van sees the control over the ar
tist as an attempt to overcome "a
traditional weakness in Chinese
society: that the masses felt that
arts and letters were not for
them." Traditional Chinese art
was elitist, and Sullivan thinks
that Mao was right in trying to
break that down.
"The masses are more aware
of art. and there are now many
peasant and worker painters." In
the past a worker or a peasant
would have had "no idea of what
the painting was about, and he
could not read the inscription."
During the cultural revolu
tion. artists and poets and writers

circulated work among them
selves, including poetry and
short stories, as a form of protest.
A painter friend of Sullivan's.
Huang Yung-yu, whose work
hangs in Sullivan's living room,
lost his job and was in disgrace.
For about three years he and his
family lived in what Sullivan de
scribed as a hovel, but he went on
painting and sending his work to
friends for safekeeping.
Zhou Enlai
Zhou Enlai, a cultured and
educated man, helped to protect
many artists during the bad
years. He managed to get leading
painters commissioned by the
state council to decorate public
buildings with landscapes. Much
of contemporary Chinese art is
centered on the cult of Zhou
and the great outpouring of emo
tion that followed his death in
May 1976. which resulted in
massive demonstrations that
were ruthlessly put down at
Tiananmen Square.
Today you still have to go
through the government or an
organization to get your work
exhibited, but the atmosphere
has changed. Last autumn when
20 artists attempted to set up a
protest art exhibition on the
street in Beijing, the police came
and took it down; but when they
put it up again outside the na
tional art gallery and the police
came, the national art gallery
staff took the exhibition inside,
according to Sullivan.
Direction
There is great controversy
today among Chinese artists as
to which direction they should
take. There is controversy about
the nude, for example, which has
not been a part of the Chinese
tradition but has become a part
of the conventional education at
the art school. The nude has
been to some extent justified
through the discovery of post
cards of Rodin nudes, complete
with comments that Zhou
bought when he uas an art stu
dent in Paris in the 19205.
The Chinese, while they are
experimenting with many diffe
rent styles, do not think very
highly of some of the highly
abstract movements of the West.
"People ask why there is not
abstract painting in China, as
though abstract art was a neces
sary step in the development of
painting," said Sullivan.
The Chinese do not like

movements like Minimal Art.
"They call them bourgeois for
malism. The traditional view of
art has been that it is always
something elevating, that art
should cleanse your mind or
make you feel the harmony of
the world and men. You are bet
ter for having looked at a
Chinese picture, even a land
scape."
Subtlety
Some recent paintings like the
one show n here, / Love the Oil
field. which shows a young girl
having just arrived at an oilfield,
are very subtle. "She is much
more modern and sophisticated
looking, and the expression on
her face is not one of unmitigated
enthusiasm,' remarked Sullivan
with a smile.
The other painting shown
heri is from the new wing of
the Beijing International Air
port. "They have obviously been
making a deep study of tradi
tional technique." This kind of
painting has not been seen in
Chinese public art since the '30s,
according to Sullivan.
But Sullivan doubts that paint
ings and murals like this would
be put in a public meeting place.
"This is for foreign eyes, to show
the foreigners how modern and
sophisticated China has become.
"There is a danger here that
some of the hardliners who have
been ousted will hit back saying
that this is not Chinese."
