Hor too long, protessors here have hidden behind
podiums and beneath blackboards. I hey"ll get to strut their
stutt onstage in a May 7 faculty talent show, sponsored by
Student Arts at Stanford (STARTS)
The show is designed both to showcase closet hams and
stars and to bring together professors from dilterent tields.
according to Marilu Magana. a STARTS coordinator.
"It started out as a talent no-talent show, but we' v e found
so much talent around here — it's phenomenal.
"It's also part o! our job (as the Iresidder Union art
board) to bring together all parts ot the community —
faculty. stall and students." added Maureen Foxon. another
coordinator.
Too manv professors either don't teel as it they are a part
ot school life or don't realize that life exists beyond their
departments. Magana said.
Applications still are av ail able. Any kind of act is eligible.
Accompanists and other services can be provided.
Ticket prices and a curtain time have not been set.
Response has been terrific. Magana said. "It's a snowball
effect: we talk with someone and they give us three or four
more names. Everyone knows someone who has a good
voice or some special talent."
Topping the bill, so tar. are actor-English Adjunct Frot.
Larry Friedlander and dance instructor Diane Freccero.
Also. Assoc. Political Science Prof. David Abernathy will
recite a section ot Winnie the Pooh (with all of the voices),
and physics instructor Gerald Fisher will offer a comedy
routine.
STA RTS hopes to use a dozen or so acts in its 1- ': hour
program in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
"We're going for variety — all kinds of acts and people
from all of the departments." Poxon said. "Afterward,
we're having a reception so everyone can meet evervone
else."
