Catch 22 * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud II) p.m.
Mike Nichols' version of Joseph
Heller's book is true to the tone of
the original. It shifts its focus ab
ruptly, unexpectedly, continually
keeping the audience off guard; it
turns on itself and changes its mind
about the significance of key
events. The casting — Alan Arkin
plays Yossarian, Art Garfunkel
does Nately and a host of distin
guished character actors take the
character actor parts — barely ever
leaves a fan of the book with that
feeling that the voices or shapes are
somehow "wrong."
But there is a catch. Though
loyal to his sources, Nichols had to
pare things down, and as such the
movie loses considerable depth. It
occasionally substitutes confusion
for meaning; it seems at times a
little preachy in a way that is en
tirely too decipherable; it becomes
merely a treatise on the horrors of
war, and loses its importance as an
illustration of the horrors of life in
general, or of the horrors of litera
ture. You rarely get the sense, as
you did in the book, that Yossa
rian's greatest battle is with the
people who put him in this night
mare fiction. It is a very good
movie, because it is loyal to a very
good book, but the very good book
had several hundred pages and
several hundred themes. The
movie begs for comparison, and
pales by it. It's better than any
other movie dealing with similar
subjects, but it isn't as good as the
book from which it draws nearly all
of its strength. It's some catch, that
catch 22.
— John Nielsen
All That Jazz * * *
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
th '» seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly. the movie
| fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's otten dazzling
and brilliant.
' Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
i Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
) by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
' though you're intruding on this
\ sometimes strongly personal film,
jl Scheider successfully captures a
[ man who's always on, a man of ta
\ lent who finds his greatest struggles
I and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
J multi-faceted character.
' The often extraordinary musical
i sequences typify All That Jazz It's
) hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
t number to your own open heart
r surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
| ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized
| that he was in trouble from the start
with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anyway.
— Ron Lillejord

Starling Over * *
Saturday. New Varsity
The uninspired formula ele
ments of this '40s-style romantic
comedy wouldn't come off so badly
if they were carried off with the
kind ol winking lightness that Burt
Reynolds' performance continu
ally delivers. Jill Clayburgh is
wasted; Candice Bergen is sup
posed to shriek and be awful — and
she's successful. Director Alan
Pakula (Klute, All the /'resident's
Men) is more at home with drama;
his comic touch is unsure, at best.
No matter what Burt Reynolds is
in. it seems, he ends up being the
only reason to see it.
— R.L.
1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. I'he script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, trenzied comedic action may
he horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
I here isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi,and Dan Aykroyd,Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.
— R.L.
Saturn .? *
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read
"something is wrong on Saturn 3."
They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion of
Demon Seed, but the result is two
boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis
tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter
tainment here, folks. Unless watch
ing animals being crushed and
people being dismembered is your
type of trip, plan a vacation some
where else.

Rock 'n' Roll High School
Old Mill,****
weekend midnight special
American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. l<ock Roll High
School is a must-see movie about

with vitality, verve and the heavy
backbeat of the Ramones. A
grade-Z version of Grease but far
more exciting.
— Dana Polan

Apocalvpse Now ★★★★
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employsConrad'ses
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It'sa journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this"impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.
— R.L.
A Clockwork Orange * * * *
Thursday, New Varsity
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual
movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near future;
the issue at stake is whether indi
viduality is more important than
the society that must deal with the
individual. Malcolm McDowell
stars as a man whose joy comes
mainly from committing acts of vio
lence; he is arrested and forced to
undergo "treatment" to make him
safe for society. Kubrick gives no
easy answers to the questions in
this singularly disturbing film.
— Jim Mattson
Breaking Away
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may he the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his talent
on a bicycle. Nominated for a Best
Picture Oscar.
— Mike Kohn
Chapter Two
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, they marry, they have
problems, they resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one
liners and even a moment here or
there that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-good sell.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles but the movie's worth
:i tree night (if any of us ever had
one). \ good one for Mom and
Dad.
— Shari Folz

Cruising
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
Writer-director William Fried
kin has alwaysdealt in cheap thrills,
but he's never made a movie as
ugly, discordant, sloppily made,
poorly thought-out and morally
bankrupt as this one. Depending
on your mood. I riedkin's depiction

of homosexual lite is akin to either
how blacks were treated on slave
ships or Milton's description of
hell. It's an utterly insensitive por
trait of a world F-riedkin doesn't
even attempt to understand. Anil
I riedkin's idea of what constitutes
goodness — that in. a heterosexual
relationship — is so stupidly and
sketchily presented that even it is
lifeless. Most pornographically vio
lent movies (for example. Midnight
Express) develop a relentless in
evitability that some people re
spond to: hut Cruising is so badly
paced and ineffectually acted (by
Al Pacino, among others) that sit
ting in front of a rock for two hours
will probably evoke a more positive
emotional response.

Electric Horseman ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
I he I act that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling ol this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle, l aded rodeo star Redford

advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate: he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
I ondu doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, l onda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially,
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
— R.L.

American Gigolo ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
us a male whore and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have

much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience ice I more like
peeping toms than \ital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a firc-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin. and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush ot images.
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Mutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.

leaves a fan of the book with that
feeling that the voices or shapes are
somehow "wrong."
But there is a catch. Though
loyal to his sources, Nichols had to
pare things down, and as such the
movie loses considerable depth. It
occasionally substitutes confusion
for meaning; it seems at times a
little preachy in a way that is en
tirely too decipherable; it becomes
merely a treatise on the horrors of
war, and loses its importance as an
illustration of the horrors of life in
general, or of the horrors of litera
ture. You rarely get the sense, as
you did in the book, that Yossa
rian's greatest battle is with the
people who put him in this night
mare fiction. It is a very good
movie, because it is loyal to a very
good book, but the very good book
had several hundred pages and
several hundred themes. The
movie begs for comparison, and
pales by it. It's better than any
other movie dealing with similar
subjects, but it isn't as good as the
book from which it draws nearly all
of its strength. It's some catch, that
catch 22.

All That Jazz * * *
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
th '» seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly. the movie
| fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's otten dazzling
and brilliant.
' Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
i Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
) by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
' though you're intruding on this
\ sometimes strongly personal film,
jl Scheider successfully captures a
[ man who's always on, a man of ta
\ lent who finds his greatest struggles
I and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
J multi-faceted character.
' The often extraordinary musical
i sequences typify All That Jazz It's
) hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
t number to your own open heart
r surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
| ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anyway.

Starling Over * *
Saturday. New Varsity
The uninspired formula ele
ments of this '40s-style romantic
comedy wouldn't come off so badly
if they were carried off with the
kind ol winking lightness that Burt
Reynolds' performance continu
ally delivers. Jill Clayburgh is
wasted; Candice Bergen is sup
posed to shriek and be awful — and
she's successful. Director Alan
Pakula (Klute, All the /'resident's
Men) is more at home with drama;
his comic touch is unsure, at best.
No matter what Burt Reynolds is
in. it seems, he ends up being the
only reason to see it.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. I'he script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, trenzied comedic action may
he horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
I here isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi,and Dan Aykroyd,Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.

Saturn .? *
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read

They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion of
Demon Seed, but the result is two
boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis
tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter

Apocalvpse Now ★★★★
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employsConrad'ses
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It'sa journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this"impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.

A Clockwork Orange * * * *
Thursday, New Varsity
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual
movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near future;
the issue at stake is whether indi
viduality is more important than
the society that must deal with the
individual. Malcolm McDowell
stars as a man whose joy comes
mainly from committing acts of vio
lence; he is arrested and forced to
undergo "treatment" to make him
safe for society. Kubrick gives no
easy answers to the questions in
this singularly disturbing film.
— Jim Mattson
Breaking Away

But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one

Caan should probably stick to his

American Gigolo ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
us a male whore and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have

much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience ice I more like
peeping toms than \ital particip

Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a firc-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin. and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush ot images.
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Mutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.

All That Jazz * * *
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
th '» seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly. the movie
| fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's otten dazzling
and brilliant.
' Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
i Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
) by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
' though you're intruding on this
\ sometimes strongly personal film,
jl Scheider successfully captures a
[ man who's always on, a man of ta
\ lent who finds his greatest struggles
I and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
J multi-faceted character.
' The often extraordinary musical
i sequences typify All That Jazz It's
) hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
t number to your own open heart
r surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
| ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anyway.

Starling Over * *
Saturday. New Varsity
The uninspired formula ele
ments of this '40s-style romantic
comedy wouldn't come off so badly
if they were carried off with the
kind ol winking lightness that Burt
Reynolds' performance continu
ally delivers. Jill Clayburgh is
wasted; Candice Bergen is sup
posed to shriek and be awful — and
she's successful. Director Alan
Pakula (Klute, All the /'resident's
Men) is more at home with drama;
his comic touch is unsure, at best.
No matter what Burt Reynolds is
in. it seems, he ends up being the
only reason to see it.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. I'he script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, trenzied comedic action may
he horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
I here isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi,and Dan Aykroyd,Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis

goes on outside the theater.

Saturn .? *
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read

They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion of
Demon Seed, but the result is two
boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis
tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter

American schlock cinema at its

Apocalvpse Now ★★★★
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employsConrad'ses
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It'sa journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this"impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.

A Clockwork Orange * * * *
Thursday, New Varsity
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual
movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near future;
the issue at stake is whether indi
viduality is more important than
the society that must deal with the
individual. Malcolm McDowell
stars as a man whose joy comes
mainly from committing acts of vio
lence; he is arrested and forced to
undergo "treatment" to make him
safe for society. Kubrick gives no
easy answers to the questions in
this singularly disturbing film.
— Jim Mattson
Breaking Away
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie

But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one

Mason is her old goody-good sell.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles but the movie's worth

American Gigolo ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
us a male whore and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have

much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience ice I more like
peeping toms than \ital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a firc-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin. and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush ot images.
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Mutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.

Catch 22 * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud II) p.m.
Mike Nichols' version of Joseph
Heller's book is true to the tone of
the original. It shifts its focus ab
ruptly, unexpectedly, continually
keeping the audience off guard; it
turns on itself and changes its mind
about the significance of key
events. The casting — Alan Arkin
plays Yossarian, Art Garfunkel
does Nately and a host of distin
guished character actors take the
character actor parts — barely ever
leaves a fan of the book with that
feeling that the voices or shapes are
somehow "wrong."
But there is a catch. Though
loyal to his sources, Nichols had to
pare things down, and as such the
movie loses considerable depth. It
occasionally substitutes confusion
for meaning; it seems at times a
little preachy in a way that is en
tirely too decipherable; it becomes
merely a treatise on the horrors of
war, and loses its importance as an
illustration of the horrors of life in
general, or of the horrors of litera

All That Jazz * * *

Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
th '» seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly. the movie

and brilliant.
' Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
i Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi

) by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
' though you're intruding on this
\ sometimes strongly personal film,
jl Scheider successfully captures a
[ man who's always on, a man of ta

' The often extraordinary musical

Starling Over * *
Saturday. New Varsity
The uninspired formula ele
ments of this '40s-style romantic
comedy wouldn't come off so badly
if they were carried off with the
kind ol winking lightness that Burt
Reynolds' performance continu
ally delivers. Jill Clayburgh is
wasted; Candice Bergen is sup
posed to shriek and be awful — and
she's successful. Director Alan
Pakula (Klute, All the /'resident's
Men) is more at home with drama;
his comic touch is unsure, at best.
No matter what Burt Reynolds is
in. it seems, he ends up being the
only reason to see it.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. I'he script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, trenzied comedic action may
he horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
I here isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi,and Dan Aykroyd,Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis

goes on outside the theater.

Saturn .? *
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read

They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion of

boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis
tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter

American schlock cinema at its

Apocalvpse Now ★★★★
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employsConrad'ses
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It'sa journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this"impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.

A Clockwork Orange * * * *
Thursday, New Varsity
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual
movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near future;
the issue at stake is whether indi
viduality is more important than
the society that must deal with the
individual. Malcolm McDowell
stars as a man whose joy comes
mainly from committing acts of vio
lence; he is arrested and forced to
undergo "treatment" to make him
safe for society. Kubrick gives no
easy answers to the questions in
this singularly disturbing film.

Breaking Away
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie

But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one

Mason is her old goody-good sell.
Caan should probably stick to his

American Gigolo ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
us a male whore and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have

much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience ice I more like
peeping toms than \ital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a firc-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin. and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end

he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush ot images.
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent

Guano

Catch 22 * * *
Sunday, Mem Aud II) p.m.
Mike Nichols' version of Joseph
Heller's book is true to the tone of
the original. It shifts its focus ab
ruptly, unexpectedly, continually
keeping the audience off guard; it
turns on itself and changes its mind
about the significance of key
events. The casting — Alan Arkin
plays Yossarian, Art Garfunkel
does Nately and a host of distin
guished character actors take the
character actor parts — barely ever
leaves a fan of the book with that
feeling that the voices or shapes are
somehow "wrong."
But there is a catch. Though
loyal to his sources, Nichols had to
pare things down, and as such the
movie loses considerable depth. It
occasionally substitutes confusion
for meaning; it seems at times a
little preachy in a way that is en
tirely too decipherable; it becomes
merely a treatise on the horrors of
war, and loses its importance as an
illustration of the horrors of life in
general, or of the horrors of litera
ture. You rarely get the sense, as
you did in the book, that Yossa
rian's greatest battle is with the
people who put him in this night
mare fiction. It is a very good
movie, because it is loyal to a very
good book, but the very good book
had several hundred pages and
several hundred themes. The
movie begs for comparison, and
pales by it. It's better than any
other movie dealing with similar
subjects, but it isn't as good as the
book from which it draws nearly all
of its strength. It's some catch, that
catch 22.

' though you're intruding on this

Starling Over * *
Saturday. New Varsity
The uninspired formula ele
ments of this '40s-style romantic
comedy wouldn't come off so badly
if they were carried off with the
kind ol winking lightness that Burt
Reynolds' performance continu
ally delivers. Jill Clayburgh is
wasted; Candice Bergen is sup
posed to shriek and be awful — and
she's successful. Director Alan
Pakula (Klute, All the /'resident's
Men) is more at home with drama;
his comic touch is unsure, at best.
No matter what Burt Reynolds is
in. it seems, he ends up being the
only reason to see it.

1941 * * *
Park, Menlo Park
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg. 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. I'he script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front; bodies fly all-too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, trenzied comedic action may
he horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
I here isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi,and Dan Aykroyd,Treat Wil
liams. Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater.

Saturn .? *
Hacienda Cinema, Sunnyvale
The ads for this thriller read
"something is wrong on Saturn 3."
They are so right. This film is an
abysmal attempt to combine the
horror of Alien and perversion of
Demon Seed, but the result is two
boring hours of a horny robot try
ing to catch Farrah Fawcett. But of
course she is rescued by her altruis
tic lover Kirk Douglas. No enter
tainment here, folks. Unless watch
ing animals being crushed and
people being dismembered is your
type of trip, plan a vacation some
where else.

Rock 'n' Roll High School
Old Mill,****
weekend midnight special
American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. l<ock Roll High
School is a must-see movie about
the energies of high school revolu
tion. Thissleazy little musical brims
with vitality, verve and the heavy
backbeat of the Ramones. A
grade-Z version of Grease but far
more exciting.
— Dana Polan

Apocalvpse Now ★★★★
Old Mill
An amazing work of mad genius
that succeeds powerfully.
Producer-director Francis Coppola
exhibits a firmly balanced intelli
gence in his reworking of Joseph
Conrad's 1902 novella Heart of
Darkness; he employsConrad'ses
sential narrative but not his point of
view. Aided by the superb
cinematographer Vittorio Storaro,
Coppola creates stunning images ol
Vietnam, combining frightening
energy and intensity with humor,
sensuality and overwhelming evil.
It'sa journey into almost literal hell
that will engross — horribly fasci
nate — some, and turn away
others. Apocalypse Now is, I think,
the best American movie of the
just-ended decade. It has almost
untenable ambitions, but the pro
found questions it confronts you
with justify the seeming craziness
of this"impossible," almost nihilis
tic, vision of mankind. Starring
Marlon Brando, Martin Sheen and
Robert Duvall.

A Clockwork Orange * * * *
Thursday, New Varsity
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual
movie. Clockwork Orange is a
morality play set in the near future;
the issue at stake is whether indi
viduality is more important than
the society that must deal with the
individual. Malcolm McDowell
stars as a man whose joy comes
mainly from committing acts of vio
lence; he is arrested and forced to
undergo "treatment" to make him
safe for society. Kubrick gives no
easy answers to the questions in
this singularly disturbing film.
— Jim Mattson
Breaking Away
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may he the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to escape through his talent
on a bicycle. Nominated for a Best
Picture Oscar.
— Mike Kohn
Chapter Two
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, they marry, they have
problems, they resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But, like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one
liners and even a moment here or
there that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-good sell.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles but the movie's worth
:i tree night (if any of us ever had
one). \ good one for Mom and
Dad.

Cruising
Aquarius Twin, Palo Alto
Writer-director William Fried
kin has alwaysdealt in cheap thrills,
but he's never made a movie as
ugly, discordant, sloppily made,
poorly thought-out and morally
bankrupt as this one. Depending
on your mood. I riedkin's depiction

of homosexual lite is akin to either
how blacks were treated on slave
ships or Milton's description of
hell. It's an utterly insensitive por
trait of a world F-riedkin doesn't
even attempt to understand. Anil
I riedkin's idea of what constitutes
goodness — that in. a heterosexual
relationship — is so stupidly and
sketchily presented that even it is
lifeless. Most pornographically vio
lent movies (for example. Midnight
Express) develop a relentless in
evitability that some people re
spond to: hut Cruising is so badly
paced and ineffectually acted (by
Al Pacino, among others) that sit
ting in front of a rock for two hours
will probably evoke a more positive
emotional response.

Electric Horseman ★★★
Palo Alto Square
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
I he I act that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling ol this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle, l aded rodeo star Redford

advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate: he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $ 12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
I ondu doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, l onda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially,
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

American Gigolo ★
Bijou, Palo Alto
Richard Gere lives the high life
us a male whore and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing
the style of his subject's sterile
naughtiness that he doesn't have

much time to provide any insight.
The sexual kinkiness here doesn't
even begin to shock — it's proba
bly all authentic, but Schrader
makes the audience ice I more like
peeping toms than \ital particip
ants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a firc-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin. and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing. Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then,
in a sudden rush ot images.
Schrader lets Gere off the hook.
With a surprisingly competent
Lauren Mutton as the one woman
Gere seems to love.

It would be easy to get worked Jl

uely based on Jams Joplin. Hut the 111
movie makes only three references \v
to '69, and without those you'd JJ
probably just assume the movie 111
was set in the present. And the \\
music is more aptly described as Ih
frenetic slum tunes with bass and ttl
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of j)
blues and rock. The performances 111
at times manage to obscure some ol \v
the movie's lack of authenticity, Jl
but the much-ballyhooed Bette 111
Midler only exacerbates the proh- \\
lem by being less-than-convincing I
in the concert sequences. When 111
teamed with either Frederic I or- n

off much better, but it's too little 11'

Justin Henry as the movie's heart. \V

passionate, almost Truffaut-like (((
character study of a divorced man's \\

But there's a gnawing (for me at ])
least) flaw in the treatment of the ///

After all the care and honesty Ben- JJ
