I] Mthoutih we usuallv abstain from de

ssert. the temptation in this food paradise
o\ ercame our will power. We chose three

flic mousse. iight-te\tured and airy. fil
led a slendci parfait glass, flic souffle, a

You get a lot for your money
I ntnes ranged from 56.95 to $10.51).
wlnch we found reasonable lor the quality
and personal cm ironment of the Inn. We
had spent only a minimal amount more
here than wc had spent at a sub-marginal
Mane C'alendar'sdinnera few weeksago.
Dollar tor dollar you get a lot tor your
money.

Marilyn said thc> usually get SO to 150
diners on a I riday or Saturday nighl. The
restaurant in open 5:30 to 10 p.m. nightly.
Sunday 4:30 to p.m. and Wednesday,
Ihursday andhriday t'rom I 1:30 a.m. to 2
p.m.
We sat downstairs hut the Inn has addi
tional seating upstairs. The two small eat
ing areas pros ide an intimate atmosphere.
"Our business is word ol mouth." said
Marilyn Schmidt. She said they used to
advertise hut no longer do so.
Personal atmosphere
"It'savery personalized business." she
said. "We ha\e really nice clientele."
She added that they are in a good
neighborhood and have very good help.
\hout six or seven people work with
the Schmidts. Nathan Schmidt has only
one cooking helper.
The Schmidts have no present plans to
expand their business. "II you have a
good thing going, don't blow it." said
Marilyn Schmidt. "Right now I want to
keep everything status quo."
Nathan Schmidt came to the I'nited
States I 0 years ago after training in Israel.
Europe and Ireland.
This is his tirst restaurant, but he has
worked with the food and beverage de
partment of the Hyatt, previously.
We searched to find a flaw in the Inn
and could only find two; the lack of wait
ing area if the need ever arose and one
crooked picture on the wall!
Marilyn Schmidt volunteered that they
refer people to the bar next door. The
perfectionist hostess then proceeded to
straighten the picture on the wall.
Same basic menu a success
When she said. "We found a formula
that worked." we could only agree. Striv -
ing for consistency, the Schmidts have
used the same basic menu for their two
years and two months of operation but
feature variations during the week.
