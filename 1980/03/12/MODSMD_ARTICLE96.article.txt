If Emily Post were alive today, she would un
doubtedly have reservations about the prospect of
eating a six-course dinner without the benefit of a
knife and fork. But you'll find no such unnecessary
items at the Menara Restaurant, which prepares
exclusively Moroccan food. She also wouldn't be
too thrilled about the lack of plates, or even chairs.
Diners recline on soft Moroccan leather pillows
while enjoying vast quantities of food in an unusual
environment.
While the exterior of the restaurant is quite un
assuming. the interior brought back memories of
Casablanca. This may not seem surprising — after
all. Casablanca is in Morocco. But unlike many
foreign restaurants, this one hasn't been
Americanized to the point of losing its foreign at
mosphere.
Most customers dine in a single large room which
has brass trays for tables, and pillows scattered
around the perimeter on the floor. The center of
the room is left open for the belly dancer who
performs twice each evening.
flie menu makes ordering easy by offering you a
choice of three complete dinners. Every person at
the table eats the same meal. Each consists of about
six courses, and the prices range from $12.95 to
514.95 per person. The dinners are all very similar,
offering variations of lamb and poultry main
courses. We selected Le Diner Menara ($13.95).
Each meal begins with the customary washing of
the hands, which is accomplished by having the
waiter pour rose-water from a large brass kettle
over them. The waiter then passes out the napkins,
which are actually good-sized bath towels. He also
brought us a basket of the restaurant's own fresh
Moroccan bread, but he warned us not to eat too
much of it.
"You've got a lot of food coming." he advised.
He was right, but nevertheless it was very difficult
to eat just a minimal amount of the soft warm
bread.
for the next three hours we indulged in a variety
of dishes, beginning with Moroccan salad. Pre
pared with tomatoes, eggplant and spices, it bore
no resemblance to a normal salad. We ate the salad
by scooping it up with our bread.
The appetizer which followed, B'stila, was also
quite unusual. It consisted of a light pastry shell

tilled with a slightly sweet chicken, almond and
cinnamon mixture that tasted as heavenly as it
smelled.
The main courses were a little more conven
tional, beginning with a pair of whole Cornish
games liens that had been cooked in a spicy lemon
sauce with just a hint ol ginger. I hough they had
been cooked until they were very tender, eating
them with your hands was still a messy business.

something that a dainty eater would enjoy. It was
well worth foregoing our manners, however. The
hens were as succulent as they were tender. One
savoring taste left the mouth watering for more.
We got a brief rest from our gluttony while the
belly dancer performed. As soon as she finished,
our waiter brought us a tray of lamb chops cooked
with honey. This entree would capture the heart of
anyone with a sweet tooth.
These were followed by Couscous aux Legumes,
or rice and vegetables, seasoned to perfection and
not over-cooked. A bowl of fresh fruit u.is the
dessert. This arrived after another refreshing wash
with rosewater, and was served with warm, sweet
mint tea. The waiter served the tea by standing
over the table and pouring from high above the
glasses. His aim was remarkable, for the glasses
were tall and thin. 1 le called this the final shower of
the evening, and it literally was.
One of the nicest features which distinguishes
the Menara from most restaurants is the very re
laxed attitude towards dining. There was abso
lutely no pressure to hurry up and make room for
another party. Diners are there all evening.
Dress is casual, but nice. You cannot over-dress;
although bear 111 mind that you will he eating with
your hands.
Because of the very low turnover rate on tables,
reservations are essential. You don't go the Me
nara for just a meal, you go there tor a unique
dining experience, and an outstanding evening.
