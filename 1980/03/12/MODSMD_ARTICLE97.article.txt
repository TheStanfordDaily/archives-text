Arc you tired ol the nil too
common pizza joint, with its pin
hall games and kiddie parties?
Or siek of waiting outside in the
street just for a place to sit down?
Then try a little out of the way
place called l-'ormico's Ris
torante Italiano Pizzeria.
There have long been a few die
hards on campus that have in
sisted that pizza and l-'ormico's
are both words lor the same
thing — good food. After a visit I
think you will agree.
Situated in a l.ucky's market
complex on Saint I rancis Drive
and Embarcadcro (Next to US
101). 112 ormico's is not the kindol
place you will just find — you
have to look for it. Once you find
it. however, you will be pleas
antly surprised.
l-'ormico's has been around for
almost four years, but the owners
have a family tradition over 50
years long in the lood business.
Flic owners have had experience
in restaurants in New York and
have brought their New York at
titudes here to the West Coast.
The most important attitude is
toward simple, home-style cook
ing. Don't expect to step into a
quaint little Italian restaurant.

1 sped to step into an Italian
person's patio.
You have to tell your host
what you want, you have to go
get it y ousel I, and it will be
served on plain dishes. Hut your
first bite will be enough to tell
you that all possible care and at
tention lias gone into the prep
aration ol your meal.
All dishes ;it l-'ormico's are
home made daily. I he veal used
in their entrees is purchased
fresh locally and breaded on the

premises. Dinners range in price
from $3.25 (spaghetti, rigatoni.
or ravioli with tomato and meat
sauce) to $5. I JS (baked veal cut
let parmigiana). and are served
with trench bread and butter,
soup or salad, and coffee, tea or
milk.
All entrees (lasagne, chicken
and veal dishes) include a side
order of rigatoni. All dinners are
available a la carte and hall or
ders of some items are also avail
able.

Another nice touch is the full
selection ol vegetarian entrees
served. All vegetarian entrees
arc $4.50: a la carte $3.75. Vcc
etarian dinners include baked
eantelloni. spinach lasagne,
eggplant parmigiana, and
eggplant Alfredo, lor people
who want something unique try
the eggplant Alfredo, it's their
own creation.
II you're up for pizza, this is
the place to go. Once you get
there, grab a beer or some wine.

relax, and just watch the cooks,
There aren't too many pizza
places around that still throw
then dough when they make a
pizza. Most places have a
machine that presses it out (and
usually presses the life out ol it.
too.) Hut here at l-'ormico's the
art ol throw ing pizza dough is not
lost.
I he dough is made fresh daily
by l-'ormico's and it is a "live"
dough. Instead oi making thin
"cracker.'' a live dough produces

a light and airy crust.
I he sauce is also made at
I ormico's and is a mildly spited,
unobtrusive tomato flavor.
Combine this with the whole
milk Mozzarella. which is the
only cheese they use. and you
have the base tor a very good
pi/za. It is the toppings that are
the most important, however,
and you won't be disappointed.
II you are tired ol pizzas that re
quire a magnifying glass to find
the topping cheer up, you've
found the right place. The selec
tion includes four types of freshly
cut vegetables, and varieties of
meat, plus those ever-present
anchovies. They also have four
different combinations for the
"Combo lovers. Taken all to
gether. the pizza you get here
will satisfy even the most discern
ing ol pizza eaters.
The atmosphere at I ormico's
is relaxed and casual. It isn't a
"classy Italian place" ora "pizza
joint." I ormico's is a nice com
fortable neighborhood restaur
ant. They serve dinner from 4 to
I I p.m. Monday through Thurs
day and from 4 to midnight I ri
day and Saturday. They also
serve a complete lunch
(sandwiches, soups, salads, and
daily specials) from 1 I a.m. - 4
p.in. Monday thru I l iday. I or
mico's is closed on Sundays.
