II you're hungry and enjoy
good Mexican food at reasona
ble prices, then Casa Maria Re
staurant may be your place. As
soon as you enter the restaurant
you are absorbed into the
friendly warm style ol the main
entry ar.ea. There are colorful
Mexican decorations hanging
from the ceiling and the cashier's
desk has been marvelously trans
formed into a small Mexican
market.
We were seated in one of the
larger sections ol the restaurant
which has about IK tables. I lie
entire dining space is cleverly di
vided and decorated to give you
a cozy feeling. The heavy
wooden furniture. Mexican tiles
around the windows and handic
rafts on the walls combine to
provide a very pleasant atmos
phere.
Appetizers
Certainly the food is as impor
tant as the atmosphere and al
though we could not possibly
have tried everything on the
menu during our two visits, there
are some special dishes to he
aware 01. Among the appetizers
the ceviche Puerto Vallurut is
especially good. The combina
tion ol shrimp, cod. tomato and
onion marinated in lemon and '
lime juice is served with fresh
avocado on a bed of lettuce and i
tastes deliciously fresh with just a
touch of jalapeno red pepper.
Beware, the pepper will catch
up with you if you eat the stuff
too quickly, but don't shy away
from a great appetizer. The
nachos are served hot and crisp

with lots of melted cheese and
are some of the best around. It's
a large plate so be sure to split it
among a few of you.
Main dishes
There is a great variety ol main
dishes, some of which are served
a la carte, while others are served
with your choice ol salad or a
delicious tortilla soup made with
lots ol fresh vegetables. I wo dis
hes to be recommended are the
chicken and zucchini N ucatan
and the Taco Nacho. I he chic
ken and zucchini Yucatan is a
tasty blend ol sliced chicken
breast, sauteed mushrooms and
zucchini which is baked and
served piping hot covered with
melted cheese.
The Taco Nacho is lor the
hungry person only, as it is ;i
huge plate ol corn chips covered
with heel salsa, lettuce, tomato,
retried beans, an excellent
guacamole and cheese. It's al
most impossible for one person
to handle on his own.
Other entrees include a selec
tion ol Mexican combination
dishes, lisli ;md other seafood,
several regional Mexican
specialties and some steaks for
those that don't feel up to going

south ol the border lor dinner.
Alter dinner, il you still hiive
iiny room there are some very
good desserts. The kahlun
mousse is a personal favorite and
highly recommended.
It there's a wait
A lull selection of Mexican
and domestic beers is available
and the margaritas are quite
good. A warning: unless they
change the prices, the margaritas
are cheaper by the glass than by
the pitcher.
II the restaurant is lull when
you arrive, or il you feel like
stopping by lor a quick mar
garita. there is a beautiful bar
with old ceiling fans spinning
away above the oversi/ed wicker
chairs. There are lots of com
plimentary corn chips and other
snacks, and there is a happy hour
Imm 3 to 6 p.m. Monday
through I ridiiv. Ihe restaurant is
open from I 1:3(1 a.m. to 10:30
p.m.
A complete dinner with drinks
will cost about SID per person,
but you can certainly eat the
basics and walk away full for be
tween S4 and $7 each.
