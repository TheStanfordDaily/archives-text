# Lyons reverses verdict French house back, but on probation
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Although the Office of Residential
Education decided earlier this month
to eliminate the French house next
year. Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, interceded March 14 to give the
troubled Row house one last chance,
l a Maison Francaise will remain in 610
Mayfield for 1980-81, hut "it is on
probation," Lyons stated in his deci
sion.
Lyons' action overturned Associate
Dean for Residential Education Norm
Robinson's decision to discontinue the
French house program and replace it
with an East Asian Studies house.
Robinson had previously accepted the
recommendedations of the 14-person
Configuration Panel, an expanded ver
sion of the Committee on Services to
Students Subcommittee on Residences
(COSS/R) which unanimously voted to
cancel the house.
COSS/R's conclusions followed two
presentations by French house mem
bers evaluating this year's programs
and outlining a program proposal for
next year. In a letter to French house
residents, the panel said it based its

recommendations on concern over the
quality of leadership within the house,
student involvement and its sense of
community. The panel felt the two pre
sentations had exposed these weaknes
ses.
The house appealed the panel's deci
sion and appeared again before
COSS/R, but after the appeal, COSS/R
made the same recommendations to
Robinson.
Lyons' decision to support the
French house is not based on opposi
tion to the conclusions of COSS/R.
"It's not one of those things which 1
would normally get involved with,"
said Lyons. "1 looked not at the sub
stance of Norm Robinson's findings,
but rather at the process."
Lyons' review of Residential Educa
tion's decision came at the request of
French Department Chairman Ralph
Hester. Hester appealed to Lyons on
the grounds that neither he nor the re
sidents of the house knew La Maison
Francaise was in danger of being dis
continued and that they were treated
unfairly by COSS/R.
Lyons' eight-page response to Hes
ter agreed with the findings of the Con

figuration Panel that the house should
be discontinued based on its past per
formance. However, Lyons felt the
panel "'acted on the correct assumption
that last year's panel had placed La
Maison Francaise on probation, but the
incorrect assumption that the 1979-80
residents and you (Hester) as depart
ment chairman knew that the house
was on probation" (for this year).
Citing "ambiguous and insufficient
communication" between last year's
panel and the residents of the house,
Lyons stated, "both Dean Robinson
and 1 saw the need to give French house
one full probationary year." Therefore
the house may continue for 1980-81,
the memorandum stated.
The decision to renew the French
house's program has encountered
some controversy.
After Robinson initially decided to
eliminate La Maison Francaise, sup
porters of the East Asian Studies house
were told that their program, which
had been on the shelf for two years,
could be housed at 610 Mayfield. Fol
lowing Lyons' move, about a dozen fa
culty members supporting the East
Asian Studies house wrote a letter to

Lyons protesting his action overruling
the reinstatement of the house for next
year.
"We were upset and unhappy," said
Political Science Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, a member of the committee
which formulated the East Asian
Studies house proposal.
Okimoto explained that the proposal
was first presented to COSS/R last year
and approved, but no housing was av
ailable. The group was told that the
theme houses would be warned that
they were in competition with new
programs. According to Okimoto,
Lyons' move to overturn Robinson's
decision on the grounds that the French
house did not have sufficient warning
was "utterly inexplicable."
"The decision has led to the feeling
of a number of students that there is no
way lor proposals for new theme
houses to succeed," Okimoto said.
It may not be possible for a third
proposal to be presented to COSS/R
next year because of the time and
energy involved, he added.
Okimoto also said he thought the
East Asian Studies core committee
should have been consulted by Lyons.

Lyons explained that he did not con
sult the group because his decision did
not involve the merits of the East Asian
Studies proposal. "They were two in
dependent judgments. We are not pit
ting one theme house against another,"
he said.
Lyons said that he and Robinson
would try to keep the East Asian
Studies proposal alive by setting up an
interim arrangement whereby a loca
tion for the group to assemble, hold
periodic events, and possibly eat to
gether next year would be established.
"We can say with assurance that
there will be spaces (for an East Asian
Studies house) by 1982," Lyons said.
By 1982, the new dorm complex to be
built next to Lagunita Court could pro
vide additional housing units, and the
fire-damaged Storey House may be re
built. he added.
Lyons suggested that one of the main
factors in the French house problem
was that house leadership was lacking.
"Information did not go up into the
French department through the resi
dent fellow or down into the house by
the RA."
Lyons' letter states "La Maison

Francaise has been experiencing dif
ficulties for several years â€” a fact that
is not widely known. House residents
and staff were verbally alerted last year
to their precarious status and the con
sequent need to pull things together in
iy79-8() . . . residents have not been
highly involved in house activities and
have displayed very little energy and
initiative; programming was done by
the residence staff, a small group of
students and the French department."
' Ralph Hester thought (the prob
lems in the French house) were a low
grade fever. The information never got
to him that the house was in trouble."
Lyons added last week.
Resident fellow Kamal Zein felt that
COSS R was at fault for not indicating
its intentions to the staff and residents
last year. Both Zein and the present
French house RA, Robin Kenmore,
occupied the staff positions last year.
According to Zein, "there is a mis
understanding about thi*> probation
business. The house officially was not
on probation last year. I don't know
when or how this was said, but it's
wrong."
He said the French house received a
letter from last year's COSS R panel
indicating the house was doing well.
"There is nothing in the letter about
the probation. In fact the last sentence
says 'Keep up the good work.' he
said.
Robinson explained that the letter
from last year's COSS/R panel had
perhaps been taken nut of context in
light of the French house's "dismal"
performance the year before. " It was
written very carefully. It does not say
'you've had a great year, keep it up." It
was written to mean, 'you've worked
hard and there have been improve
ments,' " Robinson said.
Zein also expressed general dissatis
faction with the way theme houses are
evaluated.
"They don't deal with important
questions like language and culture in
the house, instead they focus on how
decisions are made," he said.
