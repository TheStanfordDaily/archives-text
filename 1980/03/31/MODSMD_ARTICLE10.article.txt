KABUL — "The men told me that it was
dangerous to walk on Kabul streets and they
would drive me back to my hotel with a
promise to be freed within five minutes. In
fact. I was under arrest to be kept in solitary
confinement for four weeks."
The quote is from David Wilkie. 21, an
Australian national from Perth who hap
pened to have the bad luck of being on a
sight-seeing trip in the Afghan capital after
anti-Soviet riots erupted on February 21.
The diplomatic community in Kabul
thought that the young globetrotter was kil
led in the street fighting, and the British Em
bassy took charge of his belongings from the
local Faryab hotel.
Wilkie was very much alive and in jail, and
he saw himself become part of an interna
tional controversy over the role of the
American Central Intelligence Agency in
Afghanistan.
During his adventure, Wilkie met a so
called CIA agent, an Egyptian "reactio
nary.'* a Pakistani agent, a journalist and his
friend, an American carpet merchant, who
was to be released from jail with him.
Here is his story as related in an exclusive
interview with AFP:
Kabul. Saturday. Feb. 23, the day after the
anti-Soviet riots in Kabul. The atmosphere
was still charged. Martial law had been de
clared and I took frequent glances over my
shoulder as 1 walked down Kabul's main
street looking for a tea shop that was not on
strike. My fears were well justified. At 9:30
a.m. a car containing five well-dressed civi
lians bristling with firearms pulled up beside
me and with little ado I was under arrest.
The men told me that it was dangerous to
be walking the streets and they would drive
me back to my hotel. But instead I was taken
to a high school building where I was briefly
questioned, searched and promised to be re
leased in five minutes.
The high school was being used as a base

for these civilian militia. Several people were
sleeping on the floor of a classroom and
others were coming in to reload their
machine gun magazines or take a break from
patroling the streets.
With no explanation I was kept in that
room for about seven hours before being
taken to a detention center. Again I was
searched and my passport and documents
taken. There was no suggestion of charges
being made, no more questions were asked. I
was not permitted to telephone the embassy.
I was then separated from the Afghans
who were being processed with me and taken
to a bare detention cell about three meters by
2Va. My 27 days of solitary confinement had
begun. The room seemed fine at first but as
the snow on the flat roof melted the ceiling
leaked badly. There was just enough dry
floor space for my bedding.
My cell was one of seven in a corridor
guarded by Afghan soldiers who seemed to
delight in pointing their machine guns into
our faces. Next door to me was an American,
Robert Lee. and further down another
American. Charles Brockeneur.
I was questioned briefly on the third day of
my detention by a committee of polite well
dressed officials. They seemed happy enough
with my explanation that I was simply a
tourist passing through Afghanistan on my
way to Iran. I was told not to worry and that
things would be settled soon.
I was taken back to my cell and virtually
forgotten until my release. I settled down to
do time. We had no books or other diversions
and boredom was the biggest problem. I pas
sed the time pacing back and forth, exercis
ing, gazing out the window, day dreaming
and sleeping a lot. I was content to wait pa
tiently for someone in authority to realize
that I was harmless and let me go.
Robert Lee was not quite as calm. He was
sick, scared and depressed. At one stage he
was screaming out his window for someone

to come and shoot him. Later he asked to be
given sodium penathol so they would know
he was telling the truth.
Eventually he was shifted to a better room
in another part of the complex. A Pakistani
journalist, Mukhtar Hassan, moved in next
to me. This situation lasted only five days
before we were all shifted to another com
pound.
Charles had arrived before me and was
standing in the doorway of his room as 1
entered. He looked sick. Shaking his head in
bewilderment, he could only manage to say
"Oh. my God." He meant it.
We both felt at this moment we were in for
a long stay. Charles was really worried. 1
tried not to think about it, but busied myself
sweeping out my room.
The sun came out the next day and things
didn't appear so bad. The ground dried out.
The weather was almost warm enough to
wash for the first time in four weeks.
A lot of the prisoners had suffered electric
shock torture, including several Pakistanis. I
was awaiting my turn with more curiosity
than fear. When they attached the electrodes
I would start to worry, not before.
As it turned out, Charles and I were spared
the third degree. After two days in the com
pound word came of our impending release. I
was a little disappointed.
After cutting through a lot of red tape we
found ourselves free men back on the streets
of Kabul. I was stuck in Kabul a few days
trying to get an exit visa.
In the end, I solved the problem by paying
a fine for overstaying my tourist visa. In that
time, the government announced that
Charles Brockeneur and I had signed confes
sions stating that we had been involved in
seditious activities and released as a good will
gesture.
The fact is we were never even asked to
sign anything. The government was just try
ing to save face. They need it.

given sodium penathol so they would know
he was telling the truth.
Eventually he was shifted to a better room
in another part of the complex. A Pakistani
journalist, Mukhtar Hassan, moved in next
to me. This situation lasted only five days
before we were all shifted to another com
pound.
Charles had arrived before me and was
standing in the doorway of his room as 1
entered. He looked sick. Shaking his head in
bewilderment, he could only manage to say
"Oh. my God." He meant it.
We both felt at this moment we were in for
a long stay. Charles was really worried. 1
tried not to think about it, but busied myself
sweeping out my room.
The sun came out the next day and things
didn't appear so bad. The ground dried out.
The weather was almost warm enough to
wash for the first time in four weeks.
A lot of the prisoners had suffered electric
shock torture, including several Pakistanis. I
was awaiting my turn with more curiosity
than fear. When they attached the electrodes
I would start to worry, not before.
As it turned out, Charles and I were spared
the third degree. After two days in the com
pound word came of our impending release. I
was a little disappointed.
After cutting through a lot of red tape we
found ourselves free men back on the streets
of Kabul. I was stuck in Kabul a few days
trying to get an exit visa.
In the end, I solved the problem by paying
a fine for overstaying my tourist visa. In that
time, the government announced that
Charles Brockeneur and I had signed confes
sions stating that we had been involved in
seditious activities and released as a good will
gesture.
The fact is we were never even asked to
sign anything. The government was just try
ing to save face. They need it.

KABUL — "The men told me that it was
dangerous to walk on Kabul streets and they
would drive me back to my hotel with a
promise to be freed within five minutes. In
fact. I was under arrest to be kept in solitary
confinement for four weeks."
The quote is from David Wilkie. 21, an
Australian national from Perth who hap
pened to have the bad luck of being on a
sight-seeing trip in the Afghan capital after
anti-Soviet riots erupted on February 21.
The diplomatic community in Kabul
thought that the young globetrotter was kil
led in the street fighting, and the British Em
bassy took charge of his belongings from the
local Faryab hotel.
Wilkie was very much alive and in jail, and
he saw himself become part of an interna
tional controversy over the role of the
American Central Intelligence Agency in
Afghanistan.
During his adventure, Wilkie met a so
called CIA agent, an Egyptian "reactio
nary.'* a Pakistani agent, a journalist and his
friend, an American carpet merchant, who
was to be released from jail with him.
Here is his story as related in an exclusive
interview with AFP:
Kabul. Saturday. Feb. 23, the day after the
anti-Soviet riots in Kabul. The atmosphere
was still charged. Martial law had been de
clared and I took frequent glances over my
shoulder as 1 walked down Kabul's main
street looking for a tea shop that was not on
strike. My fears were well justified. At 9:30
a.m. a car containing five well-dressed civi
lians bristling with firearms pulled up beside
me and with little ado I was under arrest.
The men told me that it was dangerous to
be walking the streets and they would drive
me back to my hotel. But instead I was taken
to a high school building where I was briefly
questioned, searched and promised to be re
leased in five minutes.
The high school was being used as a base

for these civilian militia. Several people were
sleeping on the floor of a classroom and
others were coming in to reload their
machine gun magazines or take a break from
patroling the streets.
With no explanation I was kept in that
room for about seven hours before being
taken to a detention center. Again I was
searched and my passport and documents
taken. There was no suggestion of charges
being made, no more questions were asked. I
was not permitted to telephone the embassy.
I was then separated from the Afghans
who were being processed with me and taken
to a bare detention cell about three meters by
2Va. My 27 days of solitary confinement had
begun. The room seemed fine at first but as
the snow on the flat roof melted the ceiling
leaked badly. There was just enough dry
floor space for my bedding.
My cell was one of seven in a corridor
guarded by Afghan soldiers who seemed to
delight in pointing their machine guns into
our faces. Next door to me was an American,
Robert Lee. and further down another
American. Charles Brockeneur.
I was questioned briefly on the third day of
my detention by a committee of polite well
dressed officials. They seemed happy enough
with my explanation that I was simply a
tourist passing through Afghanistan on my
way to Iran. I was told not to worry and that
things would be settled soon.
I was taken back to my cell and virtually
forgotten until my release. I settled down to
do time. We had no books or other diversions
and boredom was the biggest problem. I pas
sed the time pacing back and forth, exercis
ing, gazing out the window, day dreaming
and sleeping a lot. I was content to wait pa
tiently for someone in authority to realize
that I was harmless and let me go.
Robert Lee was not quite as calm. He was
sick, scared and depressed. At one stage he
was screaming out his window for someone

to come and shoot him. Later he asked to be
given sodium penathol so they would know
he was telling the truth.
Eventually he was shifted to a better room
