# African nations to confer on South African relations
## 
### Jay Ross The Washington Post 
LUSAKA, Zambia — A new phase in the struggle
for black majority rule in Africa will begin tomor
row when leaders of nine Southern African states
meet here to start future economic dealings with
South Africa the last bastion of white rule in black
Africa.
The nine nations, an expansion of the five front
line states which helped prosecute the war against
Rhodesia, are expected to agree to a declaration
calling for regional cooperation to lessen their de
pendence on South Africa.
The unspoken, underlying theme, however, is
likely to be that the countries will have to accept
economic coexistence with South Africa until they
can improve their cooperation in such fields as
transportation and communications.
The participation of the new nation of Zim
babwe will mark the end of the struggle for Rhode
sian independence and put South Africa at the
forefront of the group's concerns.
There is widespread recognition that, unlike
Rhodesia, black rule in South Africa will have to
come about through internal agitation and resis
tance rather than through an externally supported
guerrilla war against such a powerful foe.
Southern Africa's stake in avoiding such hos
tilities, which could lead to closing of borders and
trade routes, is clear: seven of the nine nations
meeting here have more trade with South Africa
than with all the rest of Africa combined.
South African currency freely circulates in two
of the new member states, Swaziland and Lesotho.
The economy of the other new member, Malwi,

also is tied closely to Pretoria, thus giving the new
line-up facing South Africa a more moderate col
oration.
Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda called the
summit earlier this month after the election of
Robert Mugabe as prime minister of an indepen
dent Zimbabwe assured a settlement of the 15-
year Rhodesia issue that was acceptable to the
original front line states of Mozambique, Zambia,
Botswana, Angola and Tanzania.
After years of concentrating on Rhodesia, it will
be the first time the leaders have held a summit
devoted to economics.
The expansion of the front line, even though so
far only for economic purposes, is a blow to South
African Prime Minister P.W. Botha's hopes to
form a rival "constellation of states" of Southern
African nations.
A well informed Zambian official said recently
"South Africa is the most competent country for us
to deal with economically, but the most objection
able politically."
Zambia, long a host for independence move
ments including anti-South African groups, seems
to be handling the problem in a way that will prob
ably be a pattern for most of the nations rep
resented at the summit. It condemns South Africa
politically while continuing economic relations.
This month Zambia became the first indepen
dent African nation to open a direct air link to
South Africa, even though Pretoria's troops con
tinue to cross into Zambia to battle guerrillas fight
ing for the independence of South African
controlled Namibia.
