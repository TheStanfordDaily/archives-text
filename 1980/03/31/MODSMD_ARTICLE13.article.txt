# Apiaries ensure honey fanciers stay as busy as bees

Are you oper-minded and un
afraid to try new things? Do you
enjoy earning a little extra
money on the side and making
occasional visits to nearby gar
dens, collecting stray or angry
swarms?
Yes answers means you have a
suitable personality for beekeep
ing, according to Jim Talboy,
beekeeping instructor for Ecol
ogy Action in Palo Alto.
Talboy, a graduate of San Jose
State University, took up this
hobby nine years ago. "A
neighbor had some old hives that
weren't being used, so I took
them, read a few books and be
gan," he says.
The long-time Peninsula resi
dent collected his first swarms
through annoucements put out
by the Humane Society and the
Department of Agriculture. To
day, Talboy manages more than
100 hives located in Palo Alto,
Portola Valley, Woodside,
Atherton and the Redwood City
Hills.
Yearly cycles
Talboy said colony life re
volves in yearly cycles. The cycle
begins in winter when the hives
are full of honey and the colony
is small. The queen bee, from
whom all the colony bees are de
scendants, begins to lay eggs to
build up the population. Despite
her grand title, laying eggs is her
only responsibility, Talboy
explained.
During March and April, the
colony experiences and unstable
period when the bees want to
"swarm," or reproduce. At this
time, the queen sometimes
leaves with half the population
and establishes a new colony
elsewhere. The oldest remaining
"worker" bees (the queen's
female offspring) then deter
mine who will become the new
leader. "Bees are totally survival
oriented," Talboy said.
These months of instability are
called the "nectar flow" because
the bees collect nectar only to

use for their brood instead of
converting into honey.
'Honey flow'
By May, the colony has in
creased in size. There are enough
bees to vigorously collect and
covert the nectar during the so
called "honey flow."
The workers are responsible
for honey production in the hive.
"What they can do is just amaz
ing," Talboy said. "They can
communicate through dance

where food is and how much is
there. They navigate and calcu
late time by the sun," he added.
The bees collect the nectar on
their tongues and suck it into
their ' honey stomachs" where it
is broken down by enzymes into
simple sugars. Back at the hive,
they regurgitate the honey, and
place it for storage in large
"drone" cells. To avoid fermen
tation, the 30 to 40 percent water
content of the honey must be

evaporated to an 18-percent
water content.
"This is done," said Talboy,
"by the bees vigorously beating
their wings and causing constant
air movement."
As a final step, the "workers"
seal the honey cells with a wax
secreted from their glands. After
this capping, the beekeeper can
remove the honey.
Life expectancy
In an active season, the life ex

pectancy of a worker bee is only
four to six weeks. "They usually
die of wing exhaustion and fai
lure to make the long, honey
bearing flights," said Talboy.
The drones, or male offspring,
usually live for eight months, and
the queen can live up to four
years.
According to Talboy, bees
were first imported to the United
States from Europe in 1850.
Three types were predominant:
the yellow "Italian," the grey
"Carnolain," from Yugoslavia
and Rumania and the black
"Caucasian," a Russian-bred
bee from the Caucasus Moun
tains. Now in the United States,
"Bees are crossbred, and most
are mongrels," Talboy added.
"But," he continued, "they can
still communicate and get
along."
Hobby popular in Palo Alto
Beekeeping is becoming in
creasingly popular in the Palo
Alto community because of the
mild climate and abundance of
nectar and pollen-producing
trees, according to Talboy.
Under these conditions, one col
ony can produce 200 pounds of
honey a year, but "this can vary
depending on the personality
and genetics of the queen bee,"
he said.
Talboy estimates that at least
200 Palo Alto residents keep six
to 12 hives, and a few keep more
than 300 hives and have made
beekeeping their profession.
In addition to honey, which
sells for $1 a pound, beekeepers
collect pollen and bees wax.
"(The bees') essential role to us
is pollenation," said Talboy.
"Pollen is the highest quality
plant protein there is. One
pound of it, plus water and
roughage, provides a complete
diet for one person for one
month," he added.
Talboy said there is also merit
to the bee sting. "European Api

(bee) Therapy groups have cited
bee stings as being beneficial to
some forms of arthritis," he said.
Allergies
The only danger Talboy sees
in the hobby is that some people
are allergic to bee stings. "But."
he added, "(the bees) would
sooner go about their business
than bother you, because if they
sting you, they die."
There are no specific legal
regulations for beekeeping.
However, a person is not allowed
"to keep a nuisance" so, "if your
bees swarm to a neighbor's
house, they're a nuisance, anti
social and against the law," Tal
boy said.
Establishing a hive, which
consists of building a square
frame and foundation, and pur
chasing the necessary veil,
smoker, hive tool (for collecting
honey) and gloves, costs approx
imately $75, according to Tal
boy.
Talboy commented that his
class at Ecology Action, which
attracted about 40 people, was a
one-time course. But there are
beekeeping organizations in
Santa Clara, San Mateo and San
Francisco. And for those who are
really enthusiastic, UC-Davis
has a beekeeping school.

hobby nine years ago. "A
neighbor had some old hives that
weren't being used, so I took
them, read a few books and be
gan," he says.
The long-time Peninsula resi
dent collected his first swarms
through annoucements put out
by the Humane Society and the
Department of Agriculture. To
day, Talboy manages more than
100 hives located in Palo Alto,
Portola Valley, Woodside,
Atherton and the Redwood City
Hills.
Yearly cycles
Talboy said colony life re
volves in yearly cycles. The cycle
begins in winter when the hives
are full of honey and the colony
is small. The queen bee, from
whom all the colony bees are de
scendants, begins to lay eggs to
build up the population. Despite
her grand title, laying eggs is her
only responsibility, Talboy
explained.
During March and April, the
colony experiences and unstable
period when the bees want to
"swarm," or reproduce. At this
time, the queen sometimes
leaves with half the population
and establishes a new colony
elsewhere. The oldest remaining
"worker" bees (the queen's
female offspring) then deter
mine who will become the new
leader. "Bees are totally survival
oriented," Talboy said.
These months of instability are
called the "nectar flow" because
the bees collect nectar only to

use for their brood instead of
converting into honey.
'Honey flow'
By May, the colony has in
creased in size. There are enough
bees to vigorously collect and
covert the nectar during the so
called "honey flow."
The workers are responsible
for honey production in the hive.
"What they can do is just amaz
ing," Talboy said. "They can
communicate through dance

where food is and how much is
there. They navigate and calcu
late time by the sun," he added.
The bees collect the nectar on
their tongues and suck it into
their ' honey stomachs" where it
is broken down by enzymes into
simple sugars. Back at the hive,
they regurgitate the honey, and
place it for storage in large
"drone" cells. To avoid fermen
tation, the 30 to 40 percent water
content of the honey must be

evaporated to an 18-percent
water content.
"This is done," said Talboy,
"by the bees vigorously beating
their wings and causing constant
air movement."
As a final step, the "workers"
seal the honey cells with a wax
secreted from their glands. After
this capping, the beekeeper can
remove the honey.
Life expectancy
In an active season, the life ex

pectancy of a worker bee is only
four to six weeks. "They usually
die of wing exhaustion and fai
lure to make the long, honey
bearing flights," said Talboy.
The drones, or male offspring,
usually live for eight months, and
the queen can live up to four
years.
According to Talboy, bees
were first imported to the United
States from Europe in 1850.
Three types were predominant:
the yellow "Italian," the grey
"Carnolain," from Yugoslavia
and Rumania and the black
"Caucasian," a Russian-bred
bee from the Caucasus Moun
tains. Now in the United States,
"Bees are crossbred, and most
are mongrels," Talboy added.
"But," he continued, "they can
still communicate and get
along."
Hobby popular in Palo Alto
Beekeeping is becoming in
creasingly popular in the Palo
Alto community because of the
mild climate and abundance of
nectar and pollen-producing
trees, according to Talboy.
Under these conditions, one col
ony can produce 200 pounds of
honey a year, but "this can vary
depending on the personality
and genetics of the queen bee,"
he said.
Talboy estimates that at least
200 Palo Alto residents keep six
to 12 hives, and a few keep more
than 300 hives and have made
beekeeping their profession.
In addition to honey, which
sells for $1 a pound, beekeepers
collect pollen and bees wax.
"(The bees') essential role to us
is pollenation," said Talboy.
"Pollen is the highest quality
plant protein there is. One
pound of it, plus water and
roughage, provides a complete
diet for one person for one
month," he added.
Talboy said there is also merit
to the bee sting. "European Api

(bee) Therapy groups have cited
bee stings as being beneficial to
some forms of arthritis," he said.
Allergies
The only danger Talboy sees
in the hobby is that some people
are allergic to bee stings. "But."
he added, "(the bees) would
sooner go about their business
than bother you, because if they
sting you, they die."
There are no specific legal
regulations for beekeeping.
However, a person is not allowed
"to keep a nuisance" so, "if your
bees swarm to a neighbor's
house, they're a nuisance, anti
social and against the law," Tal
boy said.
Establishing a hive, which
consists of building a square
frame and foundation, and pur
chasing the necessary veil,
smoker, hive tool (for collecting
honey) and gloves, costs approx
imately $75, according to Tal
boy.
Talboy commented that his
class at Ecology Action, which
attracted about 40 people, was a
one-time course. But there are
beekeeping organizations in
Santa Clara, San Mateo and San
Francisco. And for those who are
really enthusiastic, UC-Davis
has a beekeeping school.
