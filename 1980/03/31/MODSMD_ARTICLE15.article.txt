# Stanford shows TV and education can mix
## 
### Diane Greening Staff Writer 
The University has its own
television network, and although
it isn't challenging ABC for the
number one spot in the ratings, it
does have a sizable audience in
the Bay area.
The network is the Stanford
Instructional Television Net
work (SITN), and its audience is
composed of professional en
gineers. managers and staff from
nearby companies and institu
tions.
SITN televises 150 University
and 80 Association for Continu
ing Education (ACE) courses
annually. Since it was founded in
1968, SITN has broadcast 12
hours a day on up to four educa
tional channels from four studio
classrooms on campus.
A transmitter on Black Moun
tain, southwest of the University,
uses narrow beam microwave
channels to send the broadcast
north to San Francisco and
Richmond, south to San Jose,
and east to Livermore.
Special receivers
Only special receivers owned
by the corporations that join the
network can pick up the signal.
These receivers can also transmit

audio back to the University so
that all students of the televised
classes are able to talk directly to
the instructor during class.
Companies in the network
build special classrooms in which
the programs are shown to their
employees. The company can
show classes live or have them
videotaped for distribution to
other locations.
Same tests
Students in the televised clas
ses get the same class handouts
and tests as students on campus,
and their homework is collected
by a daily courier service that

runs between the companies and
campus.
The University televises
courses in engineering, compu
ter science, math, physics, and
statistics for persons working on
graduate degrees or profession
als who want to keep up with
current developments in their
fields.
ACE broadcasts courscs in
business administration, man
agement development, and
supervision. ACE broadcasts its
courses during the time that
Stanford is not on the air. usually
from noon to 1 p.m. and from 4
to 6 p.m.

ACE courses are frequently
taught and accredited by colleges
other than Stanford. For exam
ple. Golden Gate University
sends faculty to teach courses for
an MBA program. Other
business-related subjects may be
taught by instructors from the
College of Notre Dame in Bel
mont.
Some of these refresher
courses are on videotape only.
Topics covered include MBA
preparation, technical report
writing and administrative skills
for secretaries. ACE offers pro
ficiency certificates in its man
agement and supervisory skills

programs.
Companies can also design
their own program in coopera
tion with ACE. For example.
Standard Oil once requested a
program for its geologists to
learn the latest developments in
Global Techtonics. Only 70
people saw the original live pre
sentations, but the program was
videotaped so that within a year,
700 geologists around the world
had seen the program.
A system similar to SITN in
Dallas-Fort Worth area called
TAGER now uses ACE courses
in its own microwave distribu
tion system.
