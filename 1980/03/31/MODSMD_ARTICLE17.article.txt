# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Honestly, Anderson is not a liberal candidate 
### 
A recent editorial section of the San Francisco
Chronicle contained an interview with seven Stanford
"liberal Democrats" who had joined the lemming-like
procession of converts to the John Anderson for Presi
dent campaign. Perhaps the most interesting part of the
interview dealt with their concepts of "liberalism" and
"conservatism." for it seemed to sum up a great deal of
the political confusion and downright insincerity around
these days.
According to the author, the magnificent seven vie
wed domestic liberalism as "compassion" or "not pro
tection of the individual against the State, but rather for
the less privileged." They emphasized a "willingness to
change as societal conditions change" and pointed to the
"imbalance of power" in society and"the need for gov-

ernment to balance out this imbalance."
On the other hand, conservatism was viewed as "an
underlying faith in the market system," a belief in a
"consumptive philosophy," the lack of "a progressive
vision" and a desire to "conserve the status quo." Fi
nally, they felt that conservatives "based social decisions
on economic terms, regardless of the social cost to the
whole society."
It is clear that we need a "truth in political packaging"
law. for given these definitions of liberalism and conser
vatism, either Anderson or the students need to be re
labeled to match their philosophical contents. We're
sure a great deal of this rush to the Anderson camp stems

from a glossed-over analysis of his "liberal" domestic
policy.
If one defines conservatism as "underlying faith in the
market system." then Anderson can carry the conserva
tive banner proudly. While resting the blame for infla
tion on government. Anderson looks to the private sec
tor to offer the solutions.
His proposals for fighting inflation not only include
balancing the federal budget, but also massive tax cuts
for business through deferred dividend taxes on stocks,
increasing the dividend exclusion liable for taxes and by
accelerating depreciation of capital stock (structures and
equipment).
Anderson also proudly points to his co-sponsorship of
the Investment Incentive Act which cut capital gains
taxes from 49 to 28 percent. Such "rich get richer" tax
programs must be causing jubilation in the boardrooms
of America.
How about "basing social decisions on economic
terms?" Anderson opposes both the (Pres. Jimmy) Car
ter and (Sen. Edward) Kennedy-(Rep. Henry) Waxman
national health plan as they "exacerbate the cost prob
lem." Anderson's answer to the health care problem is to
return it to the industry-controlled private sector.
Although he recognizes minority youth unemploy
ment of 35 percent to be "a national disgrace," Ander
son fixes partial blame for this on the minimum wage
law. Instead. Anderson proposes a "youth opportunity
wage" of 85 percent of minimum wage for the first six
months of employment ($2.64 per hour).
Experience has shown that such a plan results in an
abundance of 5V2 month workers, suddenly replaced by
new $2.64 per hour, 5V2 month workers. Also, this leads
to the replacement of adult workers by new legions of
"opportunity wageworkers," reducing labor costs for
business but causing new, more expensive unemploy
ment.
Anderson's energy policy seems based on "economic
terms" as well. He supports the accelerated removal of
price controls on "new" crude oil and "new" onshore
natural gas and the deregulation of pricing and alloca
tion of gasoline.
Rather than equitably allocating a reduced supply of

gasoline at an affordable price through rationing, An
derson has proposed a 50 cents-per-gallon tax on
gasoline. By his own figures, however, a 10 percent
reduction in gasoline consumption would require a 50
percent price increase, not a mere 50 cents per gallon.
Although Anderson proposes an elaborate system of
Social Security tax reductions and business tax credits to
offset the disasterous effects of this gas tax on the poor, it
remains doubtful whether the program would reduce
consumption or merely result in the redistribution of
gasoline and dollars to the rich. Perhaps this is the reason
why Anderson is the only member of Congress to advo
cate the gas-tax plan.
It is this fundamental reliance on the private sector,
the free-market and price as an allocation device which
betray Anderson's liberalism. Perhaps it is no coinci
dence that the Stanford students who view both Ander
son and themselves as liberals were all white, predomin
antly male, seeking professional careers and from
families with $30,000 incomes.
Their attitudes, however, may also reflect the ail-too
human inclination to turn in frustration to slogans and
nostrums rather than sound policy. Perhaps Anderson
provides an outlet for this frustration, but it is not a
liberal outlet. We agree with Anderson's concept of
"offering tough solutions aimed at intractable prob
lems," but he should remember the words of H.L.
Mencken: "For every difficult problem, there is a sim
ple, yet wrong, answer."
The liberal solution to America's problems is not to
cut taxes and government programs while throwing the
fate of the poor to the free-market system. Rather, it lies
in the courage to rebound from previous failures and
attack the problems anew, with the "compassion" of
liberalism the students initially advocated so strongly.
In this election year, we need to be honest with our
selves in our evaluation of our own political philosophy, as
well as the philosophy of the candidates we support.

The liberal solution to America's problems is not to
cut taxes and government programs while throwing the
fate of the poor to the free-market system. Rather, it lies
in the courage to rebound from previous failures and
attack the problems anew, with the "compassion" of
liberalism the students initially advocated so strongly.
In this election year, we need to be honest with our
selves in our evaluation of our own political philosophy, as
well as the philosophy of the candidates we support.

A recent editorial section of the San Francisco
Chronicle contained an interview with seven Stanford
"liberal Democrats" who had joined the lemming-like
procession of converts to the John Anderson for Presi
dent campaign. Perhaps the most interesting part of the
interview dealt with their concepts of "liberalism" and
"conservatism." for it seemed to sum up a great deal of
the political confusion and downright insincerity around
these days.
According to the author, the magnificent seven vie
wed domestic liberalism as "compassion" or "not pro
tection of the individual against the State, but rather for
the less privileged." They emphasized a "willingness to
change as societal conditions change" and pointed to the
"imbalance of power" in society and"the need for gov-

ernment to balance out this imbalance."
On the other hand, conservatism was viewed as "an
underlying faith in the market system," a belief in a
"consumptive philosophy," the lack of "a progressive
vision" and a desire to "conserve the status quo." Fi
nally, they felt that conservatives "based social decisions
on economic terms, regardless of the social cost to the
whole society."
It is clear that we need a "truth in political packaging"
law. for given these definitions of liberalism and conser
vatism, either Anderson or the students need to be re
labeled to match their philosophical contents. We're
sure a great deal of this rush to the Anderson camp stems

from a glossed-over analysis of his "liberal" domestic
policy.
If one defines conservatism as "underlying faith in the
market system." then Anderson can carry the conserva
tive banner proudly. While resting the blame for infla
tion on government. Anderson looks to the private sec
tor to offer the solutions.
His proposals for fighting inflation not only include
balancing the federal budget, but also massive tax cuts
for business through deferred dividend taxes on stocks,
increasing the dividend exclusion liable for taxes and by
accelerating depreciation of capital stock (structures and
equipment).
Anderson also proudly points to his co-sponsorship of
the Investment Incentive Act which cut capital gains
taxes from 49 to 28 percent. Such "rich get richer" tax
programs must be causing jubilation in the boardrooms
of America.
How about "basing social decisions on economic
terms?" Anderson opposes both the (Pres. Jimmy) Car
ter and (Sen. Edward) Kennedy-(Rep. Henry) Waxman
national health plan as they "exacerbate the cost prob
lem." Anderson's answer to the health care problem is to
return it to the industry-controlled private sector.
Although he recognizes minority youth unemploy
ment of 35 percent to be "a national disgrace," Ander
son fixes partial blame for this on the minimum wage
law. Instead. Anderson proposes a "youth opportunity
wage" of 85 percent of minimum wage for the first six
months of employment ($2.64 per hour).
Experience has shown that such a plan results in an
abundance of 5V2 month workers, suddenly replaced by
new $2.64 per hour, 5V2 month workers. Also, this leads
to the replacement of adult workers by new legions of
"opportunity wageworkers," reducing labor costs for
business but causing new, more expensive unemploy
ment.
Anderson's energy policy seems based on "economic
terms" as well. He supports the accelerated removal of
price controls on "new" crude oil and "new" onshore
natural gas and the deregulation of pricing and alloca
tion of gasoline.
Rather than equitably allocating a reduced supply of

gasoline at an affordable price through rationing, An
derson has proposed a 50 cents-per-gallon tax on
gasoline. By his own figures, however, a 10 percent
reduction in gasoline consumption would require a 50
percent price increase, not a mere 50 cents per gallon.
Although Anderson proposes an elaborate system of
Social Security tax reductions and business tax credits to
offset the disasterous effects of this gas tax on the poor, it
remains doubtful whether the program would reduce
consumption or merely result in the redistribution of
gasoline and dollars to the rich. Perhaps this is the reason
why Anderson is the only member of Congress to advo
cate the gas-tax plan.
It is this fundamental reliance on the private sector,
the free-market and price as an allocation device which
betray Anderson's liberalism. Perhaps it is no coinci
dence that the Stanford students who view both Ander
son and themselves as liberals were all white, predomin
antly male, seeking professional careers and from
families with $30,000 incomes.
Their attitudes, however, may also reflect the ail-too
human inclination to turn in frustration to slogans and
nostrums rather than sound policy. Perhaps Anderson
provides an outlet for this frustration, but it is not a
liberal outlet. We agree with Anderson's concept of
"offering tough solutions aimed at intractable prob
lems," but he should remember the words of H.L.
Mencken: "For every difficult problem, there is a sim
ple, yet wrong, answer."
