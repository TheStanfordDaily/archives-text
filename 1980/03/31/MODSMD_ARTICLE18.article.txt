## Treat U.S. Census as joke 
### 
Every American household
has received in the mail a 1980
U.S. Census form. How you re
spond to this form will he quite
revealing of your personality and
attitude towards life.
If you are a Standard Ameri
can Drone, a person who be
lieves in standing by the presi
dent, who believes that some
congressmen are honest or intel
ligent, and who believes that
there must be someone in charge
in Washington who knows what
he or she is doing, then go ahead
and meekly fill out your census
form and return it in the mail as
you have been ordered to do.
If you have a bit more
backbone or intelligence than
the Standard American Drone,
you might consider simply filing
your census form in the nearest
wastebasket.
Or, if you are tired of being
bent, spindled and mutilated by
the federal government and by
other arms of the American
welfare/warfare establishment,
you might consider abusing and
mutilating your census form to
relieve your frustration — then
deposit it in the wastebasket.
A course of action along such
lines is unavoidable if you're the
type who cares deeply about per
sonal liberties, the right of pri
vacy, civil disobedience, etc. For,

this year's census form — espe
cially the long form which will go
to one fifth of the recipients — is
probably unconstitutional, cer
tainly an invasion of privacy, and
unquestionably a damned nui
sance.
The Census Bureau is quite
upfront in stressing the impor
tance of the census to the every
day operation of that overgrown,
impersonal, inefficient, bureauc
ratized dinosaur called the
American government. Resist
ing the census is one way to slow
the monster down a bit.
Furthermore, the census can
be used for more sinister pur
poses than is commonly realized.
E. Scott Royce, writing in In
quiry (March 3, 1980), stresses
that the 1940 census was crucial
in executing the program of
forced interment of Japanese-
Americans in concentration
campus during World War 11.
Royce quotes the final report
on "Japanese Evacuation from
the West Coast, 1942" as stat
ing:
"The most important single
source of information prior to the
evacuation was the 1940 Census
of Population. Fortunately, the
Bureau of the Census had repro
duced a duplicate set of punched
cards for all Japanese in the United
States shortly after the outbreak
of war...."
The report further states that
Census Bureau tabulations
based on these cards, "when
analyzed, became the basis for
the general evacuation and relo
cation plan."
The Census Bureau claims
that the confidentiality of indi
vidual returns is inviolate. In
fact, that confidentiality can be
revoked by a simple act of Con
gress. Proposals to break the seal
of confidentiality have been ad
vanced in the past.
In the future, Congress could,
if it chose to do so, employ cen
sus returns to crack down on il
legal aliens or to aid in reestab
lishing the draft.
Nor is it clear that confiden
tiality has always been main
tained in the past. Census
Bureau officials concede that

there have been complaints al
leging violations of confidential
ity; predictably, no Census
Bureau employee has ever been
prosecuted for these violations.
In short, both the past record
and the possibility of future
abuse provide strong arguments
for resisting the census.
In principle, the feds can fine
you $100 for refusal to respond
to the census. To obtain a convic
tion, however, they would have
to prove that the postal service
did in fact deliver your census
form to you.
Can you imagine trying to
prove beyond a reasonable
doubt that the U.S. Postal Ser
vice always delivers the mail?
If you are neither a Standard
American Drone nor the serious,
dedicated, principled type, you
still have one last alternative.
Be creative!
Discover the art of creative re
sponse to inane or prying ques
tions on standardized forms.
When you reach that question
of how many persons reside in
your household, decide how
many persons you would like to
have in your household. Bring
poor Aunt Emma back to life
and lop a few decades off the old
girl's age.
Let your census form portray
your life as you wish it were. Add
20 grand to your annual income;
double the number of rooms in
your house.
After all, this is your census
form. If you can't be rich and
happy in real life, you can at least
be rich and happy in the memory
of some Census Bureau compu
ter.
And if enough people treat the
census as a joke, just possibly a
few people in Washington might
start taking themselves less seri
ously.
Take your pick then: Standard
American Drone, conscientious
objector to bureaucratic prying,
or creative prankster. By sending
you your census form, the Cen
sus Breau is giving you a grand
opportunity; how you utilize that
opportunity is up to you.
