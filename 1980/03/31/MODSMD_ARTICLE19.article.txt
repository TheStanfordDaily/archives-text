# Friday Forum: Should the coffee house be student-run?
## 
### 
Would a student-run coffee
house contribute a badly-needed
student social center to Tresidder
Union? Would it provide valu
able training in restaurant man
agement? Would it lower prices
and encourage entertainers? Or
would it be a costly and dismal
failure? Is the running of a re
staurant a complicated, time
consuming proposition that is

best left to professionals?
