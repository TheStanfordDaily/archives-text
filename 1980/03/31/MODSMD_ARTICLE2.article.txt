# Reports of leader in search for Lyman successor 'misleading'
## 
### Mike Charlson Staff Writer 
Recently published reports speculat
ing on the identity of a successor to
President Richard Lyman were sharply
criticized yesterday by sources close to
the search.
The Peninsula Times Tribune re
ported last week that Stephen Horn,
now president of California State Uni
>ersity at Long Beach, was the leading
contender for the post which Lyman
will vacate Aug. 1.
Lyman announced his resignation
Jan. 26 after he accepted the presi
dency of the prestigious Rockefeller
Foundation Y-<>rk

Sources close to the search variously
described the Times Tribune reports as
"inappropriate," "unsubstantiated,"
and "incorrect."
"The Horn stuff is madness," said
one source who asked not to be iden
tified. 'No winnowing has been done at
all yet. It is stupid to be speculating
about final candidates at this point," he
added.
Tight-lipped
Meanwhile, chairmen of the student
and faculty committees searching for
the new president remained tight
lipped about the identity of possible
candidates.
"I think that storv (about Horn) is

entirely unauthorized and I think quite
misleading," said Religious Studies
Prof. William Clebsch, chairman of the
faculty search committee.
"All the committees are still in the
process of gathering nominees, not
selecting finalists. And when the selec
tion of more-likely candidates comes
about, the nature of the case requires
that it must be entirely confidential."
he said.
Criteria establishment
ASSU co-president Sibby Freeman,
co-chair of the student search commit
tee, said his committee is "devising a
list of candidates and reviewing those
peoplr: criteria which
we feel are an essential measurement
of any candidate considered for presi
dent."
Freeman said the student commit
tee's criteria would "emphasize certain
things that are student issues . . . and
that other criteria lists might emphasize
other qualifications for president."
Freeman refused additional com
ment, saying a strict gag order had been
placed on the entire selection process.
Embarrassment
In recent years, leaks from several
major search committees seeking re
placements for university and founda
tion heads has led to embarrassment
and some difficulty in filling important
posts. Consequently, adminstration of
ficials and the board of trustees have
consistently refused any comment on
the search here.
The Times Tribune report indicated
that Horn appeared on a list of 13 can
didates submitted to the search com
mittees by the New Founders League
(NFL), an arch-conservative group of
alumni best known for their efforts to
reinstate the Indian as University mas
cot.
Also on the NFL list were William
Miller, president of SRI International
and former provost here; Anne
Armstrong, former U .S. ambassador to
the United Kingdom; and Derek Bok,
president of Harvard.
But sources said that NFL support
