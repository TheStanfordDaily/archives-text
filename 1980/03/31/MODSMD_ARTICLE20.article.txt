Peace rally protested
The Arab Student Association
at the I ni\ersity protests very
strongly the Council of Presi
dents' (COP) co-sponsorship of
Hillel's so-called peace rally ot
Feb. 26. 1980.
We protest the COP s taking
one side ol the issue ol peace in
the Middle East. The COP.
which supposedly represents the
whole student body ol the Uni
versity. should have refrained
from siding with the Israelis ol
this campus and should have
given the Arab students equal
treatment.
The rally, which was made to
glonty the treason ot Sadat and
the sellout ol the rights ol the
Palestinian people, was an uncal
led-for assault on the feelings ot
the Arab people and the Arab
students at this University.
We. the Arab students at Stan
lord. thus demand that the COP
apologize for its assault on us and
correct its blunder by co
sponsoring a speaker ol the Arab
students' choosing.

Insidious racism
I was outraged but hardly sur
prised by Dr. William Shockley's
remarks in a March 3 Daily arti
cle, "Shockley defends exclusive
sperm bank." In that article,
Shockley defended his contribu
tion to a highly selective sperm
bank established by California
businessman Robert Graham.
The ethics of this practice
aside, I take issue with
Shockley's last comments. When
asked whether this sperm bank
would cater exclusively to
whites. Shockley replied, "It
shouldn't be limited to whites.
We could make sperm banks for
good basketball players if we
wanted to, too."

Shockley. who proposes that
blacks are genetically inferior to
whites, implied that black people
are incapable of contributing to a
sperm bank of Graham's caliber.
Instead, they would only be cap
able of contributing to sperm
banks requiring donors to pos
sess talents such as basketball
playing ability.
No doubt Shockley also be
lieves that superior blacks would
best be fit to contribute to a
sperm bank if they possessed ex
ceptional watermelon-eating,
tap-dancing or gospel-singing
ability.
As a black freshman who does
not consider himself inferior, I
am repelled by Shockley's lack of
responsibility. It's people like
him who fuel the flames of ra
cism with their unsubstantiated
claims. This serves only to un
dermine the achievements of
blacks and to give license to acts
of injustice committed against
blacks. We. as conscientious
members of the University
community, must learn to recog
nize and root out these insidious
forms of racism.
Finally, if racism is hereditary,
then I consider myself fortunate
my mother wasn't artificially in
seminated by Shockley.

Muller sperm bank
Robert Graham's sperm bank,
created in the name of Dr. H.J.
Muller, the late Nobel laureate
in genetics, drew me to my file.
From the article "The Domi
nance of Economics Over
Eugenics" which appeared in the
July 1933 issue of the Scientific
Monthly, authored by Muller, I
submit the follwing excerpt:
"The results, then, (of tests)
show us that there is no scientific
basis for the conclusion that the
socially lower classes, or techni •

cally less advanced races, really
have a genetically inferior intel
lectual equipment, since the dif
terences between their averages
are so far as our knowledge goes,
to be accounted for fully by the
known tacts of environment . . .
"But it we assume that inborn
differences do play some role,
the question is. what role? Are
the characteristics which now
lead men to rise, economically,
those which are the most desira
ble. from a social point of view?
It could at least as well be main
tained that the dominant classes
tend to have the genetic equip
ment which would be least desir
able in a well-ordered social sys
tem, since they have been
selected on the basis of predat
ory. rather than truly construc
tive behavior."
Did Muller change his mind? I
have my doubts. Perhaps it was
his sly way of egging on his friend
Graham in order to prove to
posterity that the seed of Nobel
prize winners, under other cir
cumstances, might very well
produce a crop with average in
telligence — like the rest of us.

Student coffee house
Haveyoueverwished the Cof
fee House were open on your
way home from a long night of
studying so you could relax with
a friend over a glass of wine? Or
have you needed an outlet to re
lease some creativity — like
making your own ice cream sun
dae? Or have you wanted a quick
pizza to share with your team
after a victorious (or disastrous)
intramural game?
Longer hours, an ice cream
counter and a pizza oven are just
some of the ways in which we
would like to see the Coffee
House change. If it were student
run, it would be more responsive
to our needs; it would change as

we change. And we'd be there:
on the managing and planning
board, serving behind the
counter, or sipping coffee and
tapping our fingers to the music.
We'd like to see the University
make a bid for the Coffee Flouse
this spring. Otherwise, we'll
probably continue to pass it on
our way home, forgo recalling in
stant replays over a pizza and
limit our creativity to dreaming
about a student-run Coffee
House.

Nuclear danger real
Fifty-nine nations, armed with
eight volumes of technical argu
ments for the desirability of nuc
lear reactors, might seem invin
cible or maybe even right. These
countries can point to our dire
need for electric power today,
even though a century and a half
ago we needed none; or perhaps
these scientists can explain the
necessity of killing a few hundred
radiation-exposed workers, in
order to keep gasoline at one dol
lar a gallon in America.
But a recent study cannot pos
sibly claim that plutonium waste
is safe, or that breeder reactors
do not provide ample weaponry
for the destruction of the earth
— by almost anyone. Today,
many tons of plutonium waste
are created annually, and our
world friends cannot claim that
that is safe or desirable, for one
handful could destroy a city of
millions, and many handfuls are
unaccounted for.
Clearly, when left unques
tioned even the most brilliant of
men are prone to fatal error,
since either their emotions or in
correct facts will distort their
conclusions.
For instance. Dr. Edward Tel
ler, a pre-eminent nuclear physi
cist, has repeatedly stated that no
one has died in a nuclear acci
dent. Yet there were in fact three

casualties, suffered in a 1961
Idaho Falls explosion, that it
seems Teller should he aware of.
The final danger, then, is that
such brilliant scientists will he led
to erroneous hypotheses and
neglect the awful dangers we
face — apparently much of the
world has. Their tendency is to
neglect the long term (plutonium
lasts for thousands of years) and,
due to short-sightedness or mis
information, prefer maximizing
present consumption to guaran
teeing life on earth for the future.
Whether or not America joins
the "progress" of the world de
pends, of course, on how care
fully we examine the issue, and
on whether we reconsider our
priorities.
In Vietnam, we proved we
could withstand world opinion
and he wrong. It is now time for
the United States to counter
world advice and be right.

Resisters like sheep?
The claim of the headline of
Kim Wentz's column (Daily,
Feb. 28), that Americans are
politically like sheep, is hard to
dispute.
From the column, however, it
might be inferred that the sheep
are primarily those who support,
either expressly or tacitly, Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's administra
tion's policies.
It seems to me that, at the first
mention of the word "draft,"
quite a few shepherds came out
of retirement or wherever, ready
Jo lead their flocks back into the
days when protests were in the
news every night.
And 10, there were many who
were easily convinced that re
gistration implies conscription,
that conscription implies nuclear
holocaust and that demonstra

tions are swell.
1 don't question the sincerity
of those who hold rallies and
burn 11 -year-old draft cards, nor
do 1 believe that dissent is not
good. And I do not advocate tak
ing any measure — registration
or whatever — just to support
this country's petroleum habit.
But please, don't try to tell me
that people who believe that now

is 10 years ago, that there is al
ways some other way. and that it
is "militaristic" for a nation to
expect its citizens to be prepared
to take the responsibility that
goes with their rights, have any
less wool over their eyes than
anyone else.
