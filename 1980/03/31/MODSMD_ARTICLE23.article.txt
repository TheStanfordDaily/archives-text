# Citizens complain about census forms
## 
### Bryce Nelson The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — As it does
once every 10 years, the nation
again reached "C Day" Friday
— the day on which a bulky
white and blue envelope stuffed
with census questions plopped
heavily into every mail box in the
land.
This is the federal govern
ment's decennial attempt to
learn what sometimes seems to
amount to everything there is to
know about everyone in
America, from how much their
houses are worth to whether they
share a bathtub with a neighbor.
And every 10 years at census
time, millions of Americans —
even those who acknowledge the
Census Bureau's excellent repu
tation for keeping confidential
all information on individuals —
grumble about the complexity
and personal nature of the forms.
Especially the one-out-of-five
households that must struggle
with the hundreds of questions
on the 20-page "long form."
Not only do census figures de
termine the number of represen
tatives in the House from each

state — the purpose of the census
specified in the Constitution —
but census totals are also used to
draw local governmental bound
aries, to allocate $50 billion an
nually in federal aid and to serve
as the chief statistical source of
information on the nation's
people and housing.
Indeed, the evidence suggests
it would be virtually impossible
for the nation's governmental
units and business concerns to
operate effectively without such
information, a major reason why
1 25 other nations conduct a reg
ular census.
However much they com
plained about the questions,
about 87 percent of U.S. house
holds returned the questionnaire
by mail, as requested, in the
1970 census. The census bureau
expects about 80 percent to do so
this year.
In most urban areas, com
pleted census forms are sup
posed to be returned to the gov
ernment by mail, preferably by
April 1 or as soon thereafter. If
urban residents do not mail back
the forms, census enumerators
will contact them personally.

More than 4000 demonstrators massed in San Francisco March 22 in opposition to President
Jimmy Carter's plan for draft registration. The rally, preceded by a march through the city,
was part of a nationwide network of rallies that day that drew about 30,000 people to
Washington and many others to demonstrations throughout the United States.
