SAN FRANCISCO â€” About
30 Stanford students were in the
ranks of about 4000 to 5000
anti-draft demonstrators here
March 22.
The demonstration began with
a seven-block march, ending at
City Hall, where protesters
heard speakers including Rep.
John Burton (D-San Francisco),
Rev. Cecil Williams and San
Francisco Supervisors Harry
Britt and Nancy Walker.
"If anybody goes, we ought to
make sure the fat cats go," Wil
liams said in his introductory re
marks.
This message, and a message
of emphatic opposition to Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's plan to re
gister for the draft people born in
1960 and 1961 were reiterated
throughout the three-hour-long
rally.
Nationwide effort
Sponsored by a coalition of
about 50 Bay area religious,
labor, minority, political and
student groups, the rally was
counterpart to the one that drew

30,000 to a march on the White
House and to other protests ac
ross the nation.
A representative of the Bay
area intercampus anti-draft net
work said the hundreds of stu
dents at the rally were there to
declare that they would not con
sent to "being cannon fodder" to
a future conflict.
"Every conflict between the
major powers invites nuclear
disaster," added Britt. He said
he had hoped to help pass a
Board of Supervisors resolution
against registration, but the re
solution was rejected by super
visors who said "registration
doesn't affect the cities."
Soviets criticized
Reese Ehrlich, a member of
the Oakland Seven charged with
conspiracy in 1967 in the wake of
a demonstration at the Oakland
Induction Center, spoke out
against American military inter
vention in other countries, but
also criticized Soviet imperialist
actions. "Struggle against im
perialism these days means op
posing Soviet aggression in Af
ghanistan, in addition to oppos
ing draft registration," he said.
