# Card nine back on winning track
## SPORTS 
### Peter Finch Sports Editor 
Classes may have been out this week, hut
school was definitely in for the Stanford
baseball team. Hie prof, was head coach
Mark Marquess, and the lesson was how to
get in the Pac-10 Conference race.
Sunken Diamond was the classroom for
the Cards, where twice-a-day practices
under the warm Palo Alto sun were the rule.
And they seem to have worked, for not only
are the Cardinals back on the winning track,
they're climbing the rungs of the conference
ladder with all speed.
It was a week of nearly all good fortune
for the Cards, beginning with a sweep of a
double-header against St. Mary's a week ago
Saturdav. and culminating with a three game
sweep of ninth ranked UCLA last weekend.
In the third game of the UCLA series yes
terday the Cards walked off with a thrilling
4-3 victory.
Stanford's final, game-winning run came
in the bottom of the eighth inning. Catcher
Hill Worden led off the inning with a solid
double to left field. First baseman Loring
Davies then laid down a sacrifice bunt to
move Worden into scoring position at third.
Freshman Steve Buechele came to the plate
next, pinch hitting for outfielder John Elway,
and also bunted — expertly working a
squeeze play to bring Worden home for the
winning run.
Senior Larry Kuhn, now 6-2, took the
mound for Stanford at the game's outset. He
was hit hard in the first inning. Outfielder
Chris Smith tagged a fly ball to deep center
field as the Bruin's first batter, but the Cards'
Mike Dotterer flagged it down for the out.
The next batter. Reggie West, singled to left,
stole second, and scored when first baseman
Gary Fradella blasted the ball over the right
field fence for a two-run homer.
Stanford came right back in the second
half of the first inning when freshman Mike
Dotterer, batting .317 before the weekend,
ripped a line drive home run over the left
field fence. It was the first home run of his
Stanford career.
The Cards tied the score in the second on
an error by Bruin shortstop Brian Graham.
Elway, who reachcd first on a walk and took
third on outfielder Mike Toothman's single
to center, scored when third baseman Bob
DeCosta grounded to short and Graham was
unable to make a play at first or home.
Bruin pitcher Jeff McDonald, who started
yesterday's contest, was replaced by Herb
Fauland after the second inning.
Both teams were held scoreless until the
fifth inning. Graham led off with an infield
single for UCLA, and was advanced to sec
ond on a sacrifice bunt by outfielder Chris
Smith. He then continued to third when
Stanford's Worden let a pitch get by him for a
passed ball. Another passed ball on the next
batter scored Graham from third to bring the

score to 3-2 in UCLA's favor.,
Stanford answered with another run in the
fifth. With two outs and nobody on base,
Worden unleashed his seventh home run of
the year — a hit of about 390 feet to left
center field.
With men on first and second in the top of
the sixth, Stanford's Kuhn was replaced by
sophomore Brian Mignano. Mignano, pitch
ing extremely effectively, proceeded to retire
the side, and then go on to set the Bruins
down in order in the seventh, eighth and
ninth innings.
UCLA's Fauland was also very effective,
only faltering in the bottom of the eighth,
allowing Stanford to score the winning run.
Stanford's coach Marquess felt the team's
success in the past week was due mostly to
being home at Sunken Diamond, but did
concede that some extra practice during the
vacation helped the team.
"Obviously practice helps," he said, "but
we always seem to play better defensively at
home. And the team didn't have finals to
worry about anymore. 1 think they could just
relax and play better because of that."
In Saturday's game, with Lee Cline on the
mound for the Cards and Andy Center for
the Bruins, UCLA jumped out to a quick 1 -0
lead in the first inning. With one out and the
bases loaded, Cline walked Fradella to score
Smith from third. Cline got himself out of the
sticky situation, though, by forcing Gauntlett
to hit into an inning-ending double play.
Stanford's Meier opened the second in
ning by getting to first on Fradella's error at
first base. Meier then advanced to third as
Worden singled to left field. The next batter,
Davies, grounded to short, but scored Meier
and tied the game 1-1.
The Bruins were unable to score in the
third, but Stanford forged on, gaining two
more runs.
DeCosta opened the third for Stanford,
rifling a double just inside the left field line.
Dotterer stepped to the plate next and was
promptly given a curveball in the leg. It was
the second time in the weekend Dotterer had
been hit by a pitch — in Friday's series
opener he took one in the elbow as well.
Designated hitter Mike Aldrete then laid
down a perfect bunt to advance both De-
Costa and Dotterer one base. Second base
man Paul Zuvella added two more RBI to his
total and made the score 3-1 in Stanford's
favor by chopping a high bouncer over the
third baseman's head into left.
Stanford's Cline was replaced by pitcher
Paul Grame in the fifth. He set the first three
Bruins down in order.
Then, in the bottom of the fifth, it was
Zuvella again who produced the Stanford
scoring power. A two-out single to left off of
Zuvella's bat scored Dotterer from second
and put the score at 4-1.
Possibly the most exciting moment in the
entire game came in the eighth inning, after

all the scoring had finished for the day. With
one out and men on first and second, UC
LA's Gauntlett cracked what seemed to he a
sure hit through the hole between second and
third. Diving to his right. Card shortstop
Meier miraculously came up with the hall,
alertly picked himself up, and lobbed the ball
to the covering Zuvella. Zuvella tagged sec
ond base and threw on to first to complete a
picture book double play that brought the
crowd to its feet.
It was in Friday's game that the Cards offi
cially regained their Pac-10 confidence.
Stanford jumped on UCLA pitcher Matt
Young, who went the full nine innings, for 2
first-inning runs when Worden lashed a line
drive between first and second, scoring
Zuvella and outfielder Phil Wilson from sec
ond and third.
The Bruins couldn't score until the third
inning. Graham started the UCLA rally by
singling solidly to right field. He then stole
second and advanced to third when Smith
blooped a single off his fists into shallow left.
Graham scored easily when West tagged a
single into left field.
Stanford's Kuhn, who started as pitcher in
Friday's game too, neatly got himself out of
further trouble by getting UCLA's Don
Slaught to pop up to right field and striking
out Pat Dodson on three pitches.
Meier hit a two out single into right field
that would lead to another Stanford run in
the bottom half of the third. Worden fol
lowed with a bloop single just inside the right
foul line. As the ball dropped in. Meier
headed for third. When the Bruins made an
unsuccessful play on Worden going for sec
ond, Meier trotted home, making the score
3-1.
In the top of the fourth. Kuhn was replaced
by Bob Boatman. UCLA's Fradella
promptly stroked a Boatman offering into
the right corner for a double. Gauntlett fol
lowed with a towering pop fly to short center
and Boatman got the next two haters, Dave
Montari and Mike Gallego to fly out as well.
UCLA drew within one in the fifth, scoring
Graham from second on West's triple to the
center field fence. Next, Slaught reached first
by beating out an infield grounder, and Dod
son walked to load the bases with just one
out.
But fortunately for the Cards, Boatman
kept his cool, striking out Fradella and forc
ing Gauntlett to ground out.
Stanford came back with two more runs in
the bottom of the fifth. Almost exactly dup
licating West's hit in the top of the inning,
Stanford's Davies lined a two-out shot to the
wall in center for a triple. Worden and Wil
son scored from first and third on the play.
Brian Mignano took the mound for Stan
ford in the seventh inning and retired the
Bruins in order.
In the bottom of the seventh, the Cards

three games against last year's Pac-10 champions, UCLA.
graciously accepted UCLA's gift
of two more runs. Freshman out
fielder Darryl Stephens reached
first on the first baseman's error,
stole second, and took third on
an overthrow. When Meier
reached first thanks to a poor
throw by UCLA's third base
man, Stephens scored ef
fortlessly. Then Meier dupli
cated Stephens' feat by stealing
second and going on to third on
an overthrow. All it took was
perfect bunt off the bat of Mike

Freitas, the Cards' backup
catcher, to bring Meier home
and give Stanford a 7-2 lead.
Stanford scored the game's
last run in the bottom of the
eighth. Elway slashed a single
into right, driving home Mike
Toothman from second base.
Mignano fittingly ended the
game by retiring the Bruins first
three batters in the top of the
ninth.
At least for the present, it ap
pears that the Cardinals'
baseball fortunes have reversed

directions. Up until last week the
team had lost seven straight con
ference games, and their pre
season no. 1 ranking was begin
ning to look more like a clerical
error than a deserved honor.
But taking two of three from
St. Mary's, downing UC-Davis
12-6, and sweeping UCLA.
Stanford's overall record stands
at 2<J-y and its Pac-10 mark rests
at 5-7. Things are looking brigh
ter.
The Cards face Nevada Las
Vegas in non-conference action
Tuesday, and will resume league
play Thursday at Berkeley.
Now that classes have re
sumed on the Stanford campus.
Cardinal fans can only hope that
their team will remember the
valuable lesson it seemed to
learn during the vacation.
