# Women win AIAWs; men take 10th in NCAAs
## Swimmers excel in nationals 
### Dianne Cahoon Staff Writer 
Dreams came true for the
Stanford swimming teams as
they realized season goals during
national championship meets
over the past two weeks.
The women opened the show
with a hang, winning the Cards'
first AIAW swimming title by
edging Texas. 629-623, in the
Las Vegas finals' week ex
travaganza. The men followed
the next week with a tenth-place
finish in the NCAA champion
ships at Harvard to end the
Cards' two-year, top-ten
drought.
"It was tremendous," said
Coach Claudia Thomas of her
depth-laden squad's stunning
victory. "We went thinking we
could win. hut we always realized
that it could be close."
In fact, the Cardinals assumed
a two-point lead over the Lon
ghorns after Wednesday's (the
19th) first day of competition,
only to drop to a second-day tie
with Texas behind I'SC. But the
Cards resurged to a 37-point
command entering the meet's
final day and hung on to clinch
the championship with a third
place in the very last event, the
400-yard free relay.
"We talked a lot about that
last relay," confessed Thomas.
Ultimately, Stanford needed
only a fifth behind the Texans'
winning performance in the clos
ing relay. Kelley Asplund's 49.6
anchor leg tied the knot for the
cautious Cards relay team of
Nancy Thompson. Carol Procter
and Barbara Major. "Everyone
was scared to death to jump
(early on starts)." admitted
Thomas.
Florida actually entered the
meet in the favorite's role, but
quickly succumbed to fourth
spot. "That opened it up for us
and Texas, although USC did

scare us for the first three da\s."
Thomas said. The Cards nipped
the Longhorns in a dual meet at
deGuerre Fools earlier in the
season. Still, astounding Texas
freshman Jill Sterkel grabbed the
individual title by notching four
American records and gaining a
total of 47 points.
Stanford's Janet Buchan
racked up third in the individual
category, and teammate Kim
Carlisle was fourth. Buchan set
an AIAW record in winning the
400 individual medley in
4:!6.06. The versatile freshman
also placed third in the 200 IM,
the 200 backstroke and the 500
freestyle, as well as fourth in the
100 IM. Carlisle won the 50 back
in 26.26, just ahead of fellow

Card Linda Jezek. and was sec
ond in the 100 IVI. third in the
100 hack, fifth in the 200 free
and fifth in the 200 IM. Both
swimmers clocked close to per
sonal best times in all their
events.
Besides her runner-up finish
in the 50. Jezek swept the 100
and 200 backstrokes, touched
sixth in the 200 IM and churned
to a grueling tenth in the 100 IM.
immediately on the heels of the
200 back. The top 16 finishers
scored team points.
The Cards' 200 ireestyle relay
(1:32.65) and 200 medley relay
(1:43.74) set American records
in winning performances, while
the 400 medlev relay was sec
ond. and the SOO free relay came
in fourth.

Barbara Major contributed to
all five relays, as well as scoring
individually with a third in the
100 free and a fifth in the 50 free.
Asplund, another important cog
in the relays, competed strongly
in the sprints, second in the 50
and 100 freestyles, third in the
50 fly and fourth in the 200 free.
Procter was also a major factor in
the relays.
L-ibby Beaudet swam "very
well, but had a hard time in the
trial heats every morning," ac
cording to Thomas. Thus.
Beaudet won three consolation
heats to garner ninth place in the
200 fly, the 400 IM and the 200
IM, plus tenth in the 1 00 fly and
11th in the 100 IM.

Dana Morton, of the Stanford women's swimming team, does what she does best — the
breaststroke. She, along with the rest of her team, took first place in the AIAW swimming
championships. It was onlv the second time in Stanford history that a women's team won a
national title. The women's tennis team was the first in 197b.
three breaststroke events, with a
third in the 200, a fourth in the
100 and an eighth in the 50.
Dana Morton recorded her best
times to take 11th in the 200
breast and tenth in the 100 dis
tance of that stroke.
Co-captains Zena Herrmann
and Maria Pease displayed grit,
as Herrmann climaxed her show
ings with a tenth-place best time
in the 200 backstroke, and Pease
was ninth in the 500 free in 3:51,
a time that would have earned
her third in the championship
heat, and 15th in the 200 fly and
the 1650 free.
Helen Casabona placed 11th
in her only race, the 200 fly, and
Jeanne Barkey missed the final
16 in the 50 fly by a mere .01
seconds.
"They were super. They were
confident and tough and im
proved almost every time,"
Thomas concluded about her
team members.
Across the country, in the
three-day competition culminat
ing Saturday, the men slated
their return to national promi
nence under the tutelage of
first-year coach Skip Kenney.
Sporting a tremendously young
squad, the Cards captured 69
total points for tenth behind
cross-Bay rival Cal's second
NCAA victory in a row.
Freshman Bari Weick
emerged as one of the country's
up-and-coming stars in the dis

tance events. He was the brides
maid in Saturday's 1650 tree he
hind the NCAA-record time of
UCLA's Brian Goodell and
ahead of third-place Bobby
Hackett, Harvard's perennial
marathon man. Weick's time of
15:00.40 marked a full 35-
second drop off his best time at
the first of the season. Weick also
scored an eighth-place finish in
Thursday's free in 4:22.1 7, over
12 seconds down from his early
season mark.
Wade Flemons was the Cards'
other top performer, nabbing

second in the 200 back in
1:48.00, only .24 behind victor
Jamie Fowler of USC. Flemons
won the consolation heat in the
100 back for seventh in that
event (50.44).
John Simons chalked up
fourth in the 400 IM (3:54.16),
eighth in the 200 breaststroke
and 1 Ith in the 200 IM for the
Cards. Co-captain Monte Brown
placed an amazing sixth with his
best time in the 1650 (15:08.32).
Cal won the meet surprisingly,
seemingly taking the losses of
last year's NCAA champs Peter

Rocca and Graham Smith in
stride. The Bears' Far Arvidsson
set two NCAA records on the
way to victory in the 100 and 200
fly events, breaking former Card
Mike Bruner's record in the 200.
Goodell won three events for the
Bruins, and his teammate Bill
Barrett set two American re
cords. The Bruins won five of the
meet's IS events for the most
wins, hut still finished fourth in
the scoring race.
Card coach Skip Kenney was
in transit and unavailable for
comment.
