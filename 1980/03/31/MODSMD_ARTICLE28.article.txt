story. The NorCal Champion
ship won by Stanford is no excep
tion. As a birthday present for
Walker, the women's team
bought a gold chain and gold

and the roller coaster-like gold
prices, the gift now has signifi
cance as a fulfilled premonition
ot the team's first conference ti
tle.

and they've been ahead of us for
a while.
