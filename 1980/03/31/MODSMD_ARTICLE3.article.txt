# University finalizing Storey House plans

Storey House will be back.
In comparison to other options, re
storation of the fire-damaged resi
dence was affordable and offered the
most favorable cost, according to Uni
versity administrators.
"It would cost less to restore it than
build another," said Dean of Student
Affairs Jim Lyons. "We wanted to
keep the residential row alive."
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean of residential education,
renovation should be finished by Sep
tember 1981.
Stanford's insurance company has
estimated basic reconstruction costs at
$400,000. But this minimum figure
does not include architect fees, furnish
ings, relandscaping and satisfying
building and fire codes.
Total cost beyond basic reconstruc
tion could run "up to a million dollars,"
said Ed Scoles, director of housing and
management.
Before construction begins this
summer, an architect will have to be
retained, said Scoles. The office of de
sign and construction will suggest three
or four architects from which the vice
presidents will choose one.
Current plans include redesigning
the second and third floors for a 50
rather than 40 person capacity. Scoles

said architectural plans should add
more space, particularly on the third
floor.
"We're going to have to completely
redo the third floor and part of the
second," Scoles said.
Renovation will probably include a
smoke tower like those at the Delta
Upsilon house and some of the high
rises. The smoke tower, a separate
structure outside of the building, pro
vides an alternative exit in case of fire.
Other additions may include a com
pletely new electrical system, com
pletely new ceilings on all three floors
due to water damage and new bath
rooms with a co-ed possibility, al
though this does not necessarily mean
Storey House will become co-ed.
He added that the removal of the 40
Storey House draw spaces should not
affect the draw.
The 39 former Storey House resi
dents are currently scattered through
out campus in a variety of residences.
Twelve are living in fraterni ties and the
others are in guest rooms and dorms.
Scoles said there has been evidence
of recent break-ins into Storey House
although nothing was taken. "There's
nothing valuable in the building. It is a
closed building which isn't safe to en
ter," he said. Guards are impossible
due to cost, but new locks and boards
should deter break-ins until construc
tion begins, Scoles said.
