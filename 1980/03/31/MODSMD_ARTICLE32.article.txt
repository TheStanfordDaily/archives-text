Women's Tennis Note
In what was probably the most
grueling tournament they will
play all year, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team managed a
fifth place finish in a field of six
teams last week.
Competing in the Brigham
Young University Invitational,
the Cards came up against five of
the top teams in the country. On
the first day of the tournament,
Tuesday March 25, Stanford de
feated UCLA 5-4. From there,
things got progressively tougher.
On Wednesday they suffered a
7-2 defeat at the hands of even
tual tournament winner USC.
Iluirsday saw a 6-3 loss to BYU.
Friday included a 7-2 loss to
Florida, and on Saturday, the

Cards were downed 6-3 by Trin
ity.
"It was the first time anything
like this has ever happened
where the top six teams in the
country meet head to head each
day." said women's tennis coach
Frank Brennan. "It was very
grueling."
When Brennan's team step
ped onto the court Friday to take
on Florida, it was running on lit
tle sleep. The previous night's
match with BYU did not end
until 2 a.m., according to Bren
nan.
Ottmar rejoins grid staff
Dave Ottmar. former Stan
ford punter and backup quarter

back as well as a graduate assis
tant football coach under Bill
Walsh for two years, officially re
joined the Cardinals last Friday.
He will serve as tight end coach
under new head coach Paul Wig
gin.
Most recently, the 27-year old
Ottmar worked as tight end and
wide receiver coach at San Jose
State.
Ottmar still holds the Stanford
punting average record. He av
eraged 41 yards in two seasons
— 1972-1973 — while serving as
backup to quarterback Mike
Boryla.
Men's V-Ball
The Stanford men's volleyball

team, coached by Fred Sturm,
played three key conference
matches over the last week, and
came away with one victory.
On Wednesday, March 26, the
Cardinals hosted UC-Santa Bar
bara and lost in three games.
"We were pretty inconsis
tent," said senior Jack Foxworth.
"That's been our major problem
this year. We have a pretty good
team, but we're just not steady.
Sometimes we play great. Other
times we play bad."
Friday night, the team
traveled to San Diego State, and
again lost in three games. "There
were really no good individual
performances," Foxworth
explained. "We didn't pass very

well and we couldn't run our of
fense. When that happens, it's
hard to win."
Things looked very much bet
ter Saturday night against
Loyola-Marymount, though, as
the Cards romped to a 15-5,
15-7, 15-12 victory.
"We passed well, hit well, and
blocked the hell out of them,"
Foxworth said. "A lot of players
saw action and everybody played
well."
The spikers' next match is Fri
day at the ever-powerful UCLA.
All the Cards' remaining games
are crucial if they wish to play in
the NCAA regionals in early
May.
