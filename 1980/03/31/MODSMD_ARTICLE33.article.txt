Iran claims receipt of U.S. ultimatum
TEHRAN, Iran — The United States sent Iran an ultimatum
yesterday threatening stiff economic and political sanctions unless
the 50 American hostages held at the U.S. Embassy are transferred
immediately to the custody of the government, Iranian officials
said.
They said President Jimmy Carter, in a new message to President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. warned that his patience was running out
aftei almost five months of deadlock over the hostages, who are
being held by Moslem militants.
"They have given me an ultimatum," an aide to Bani-Sadr
quoted the president as saying.
Fhe ruling Revolutionary Council met for more than four hours
last night to discuss the issue, officials said. After the meeting.
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said the council had agreed
to transfer the hostages out of the embassy — but he admitted that
the proposal had not vet been approved by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iran's revolutionary leader.
• We discussed the transfer of the hostages." Ghotbzadeh told
the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post. "I think it will be
done very shortly, within a few days."
Hie reported ultimatum gave the Iranians until tonight Tehran
time to take the hostages out of the hands of the Moslem students
who seized them and the embassy Nov. 4. government sources said.
An air of new optimism became evident in U.S. government
circles last night that a break might come soon in the stalemate over
the American hostages in Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh predicted that the
hostages, held bv militants in the U.S. embassy compound in
Tehran since Nov 4. would "soon" be turned over to the control of
the Iranian government.
In the roller-coaster history of attempts to solve the hostage
crisis, however, officials of the new Iranian government have re
peated! v believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough —only
to have Khomeini abruptly reject the product of their negotiations.
Colombian guerrillas release 2 hostages
BOGOTA. Colombia — Guerrillas holding hostages in the
Dominican Republic Embassy yesterday released two of their 29
captives seized in the embassy takeover more than a month ago.
Among the 27 still held in the embassy is U.S. Ambassador
Diego Asencio.
The two freed are not diplomats. A Foreign Ministry source
identified them as Simon Rodriguez, a magistrate from the Cun
dinamarca region, and Jorge Valencia, publisher of the magazine
Murtdo Diplomatico (Diplomatic World).
Thev were taken by police to a military hospital to be examined.
The men came around the corner at the head of the deadend
street leading to the embassy at about 5:30 p.m. Reporters watch
ing from a roped-off area about 100 yards away said the men were
pushing a red \ olkswagon that had been parked near the embassy.
The vehicle was pushed to one side of the military command post
around the corner from the embassy and was thoroughly searched
bv militarv police, who declined to say why the Volkswagen had
been used.
The two men went inside the command post and then entered
another car parked outside and were driven away.
A priest who visited the embassy Friday with a message from
Pope John Paul 11 told reporters afterwards that "the comandante
(who leads the embassy guerrillas) told me that all those without
diplomatic rank would be released during Holy Week."
That would have included four foreigners and four Colombians,
before yesterday's release, and could include two Colombian pro
tocol officers.
Anderson may quit, calls Brown *a joke'
Mil WAUKEE — Rep. John Anderson (R-lll) thinks that he
might scuttle his presidential bid if he does not get 25 percent of the
Wisconsin vote. He calls Gov. Jerry Brow n. of California "a
joke." And he says "George Bush has had it" in the 1980 cam
paign.
In shirt-sleeves candor, he engages reporters in running debates
aboard his campaign planes — including one that ended in an
argument between the candidate and his wife over Sen. Edward
Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.
During one of these sessions while flying from Oshkosh to Mil
waukee before setting out yesterday on his last three days of
campaigning in a half-dozen cities for the Wisconsin primary to
morrow. Anderson also offered in quick succession:
— An announcement that Cheap Trick, a hometown group from
Rockford. 111., will stage a rock concert to raise money for his
campaign.
— The wish that television producer Norman Lear would throw
a big party for him in the Hollywood Palladium.
— A long, thoughtful analysis of his Republican campaign,
saying that the success or failure of his drive to re-register as
Republicans Californians who are Democrats will help him decide
whether to drop out of the GOP and run as an independent.
— Before speaking yesterday at a black church and attending a

rally at his Milwaukee headquarters, Anderson went to
Washington to appear on NBCs "Meet the Press." where he
refused to rule out an independent hid for the presidency. He said
he was making no plans for a third party race, hut added that many
of his 71.000 campaign contributors are "unhappy with the choice
merely between (former Gov. Ronald) Reagan (of California)and
(President Jimmy) Carter in November."
While denying that he sits up nights "thinking about indepen
dent candidacies and third parties." Anderson acknowledged he
will weigh heavily the response from independents and crossover
Democrats in California in reaching a decision about leaving his
party.
Last week, Anderson said he would make that decision in 30
days — before the California primary.
Hazard seen in other Cascade peaks
VANCOUVER. Wash. — Mount St. Helens' violent awakening
from 123 years of dormancy should alert public officials and pri
vate citizens to the fact that several other serene-looking peaks in
the Cascade Range pose the potential for future volcanic activity,
leading geologists said yesterday.
Without exception, the experts monitoring the new eruptions
decline to predict if or when an> of Mount St. Helens' brethren —
Mount Ranier and Mount Baker in Washington State. Mount
Hood and Crater Lake in Oregon. Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak
in Northern California — could come to life with volcanic activity.
But they said their years of geological detective work convinced
them that more eruptions are likely in the centuries ahead as the
Cascades — still young in geological terms — display more of the
turmoil of adolescence.
"The potential hazard is real and warrants concern," said Donal
R. Mullineux, a Denver-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist,
who for a week has coordinated the scientific monitoring of Mount
St. Helens' behavior.
Mullineux and his colleagues, even before Mount St. Helens'
eruption, had done stacks of reports warning that ever-increasing
use of areas around many of the dormant volcanoes means that
more lives and property than ever would be endangered by vol
canic activity.
"It is fortunate that there has been very little development in the
area surrounding St. Helens." Mullineux said in an interview Sun
day. "It has not been nearly as great as around Rainier, where there
is much recreational activity, or Shasta, where many people are
moving in.
P.A. boy dies in roller coaster accident
SANTA CLARA — One train on a roller coaster plowed into
another, killing a teen-age boy and injuring eight passengers, and
an employee at Marriott's Great America Amusement Park said
electric eyes designed to keep the trains separated apparently had
failed.
Park spokesman Art Larson said yesterday the " Willard's Whiz
zer" ride would remain shut until they discovered what caused the
accident.
He said no explanation could be given until an investigation was
completed into Saturday evening's accident on the thrill ride that
features a seven-story "free fall" in which cars plummeting down a
track are restrained only by centrifugal force.
But an employee said there are two sets of electric eyes which
regulate the gap between the trains and he did not know why those
systems failed to prevent the accident.
"Two systems had to break down for this to occur," he said. "The
odds against that happening must be astronomical."
Eyewitnesses gave contrasting accounts of the accident, which
killed 13-year-old Kyle Foss of Palo Alto.
According to the unidentified employee, one train carrying more
than 20 riders inexplicably slowed down during a high-speed des
cent and was rammed from behind by another train traveling more
than 50 mph. Three passengers were thrown out of one car, while
other riders grabbed onto the sides of their cars.
"The boy that died landed on the rocks, and two other people
landed in a pool of water below the tracks." said the employee.
But another witness said yesterday that Foss was getting on the
ride at a loading platform when the second train hit from behind,
and that he was run over on the tracks.
California Democrats endorse Brown
LOS ANGELES — Sen. Edward Kennedy narrowly missed
gaining an endorsement by the California Democratic Council
yesterday in what had been viewed earlier as a "three-way" toss-up
between Kennedy. President Jimmy Carter and Gov. Jerry
Brown.
The Massachusetts senator garnered 59.76 percent of the vote ot
some 500 CDC delegates on the third ballot yesterday at the
CDCs 28th annual convention here, falling just short of the 60
percent mark required for a formal endorsement.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, CDC founding president, easily
won endorsement for his re-election campaign.
The delegates, representing about 20,000 liberal Democrats in
nearly 200 political clubs statewide, gave Brown 17.38 percent of

the first ballot vote and 10.16 vote on the second.
Carter managed only 15.36 percent on the first ballot, just above
the 15 percent cutoff required to make the second round of voting.
He was dropped from consideration after the second ballot when
his supporters caucused and decided to switch to the "no endorse
ment" column.
Representatives of all three candidates claimed victory in voting.
"He (Kennedy) was expected to get the endorsement," said
former state Sen. Nate Holen, Carter's spokesman. "Every major
speaker at this convention spoke on behalf of Kennedy. The dele
gates did not respond to Kennedy."
Brown's chief of staff Gray Davis said yesterday's vote for his
candidate could boost Brown's sagging campaign. Brown has yet to
win a single delegate for the Democratic national convention.
North Vietnamese President Thang dies
BANGKOK, Thailand — I on Due Thang, who became presi
dent of North Vietnam on the death of revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh in 1 969 and later was the first and only president of a unified
Vietnam, died vesterdav. Radio Hanoi announced. It said Thang
was 91.
Fhe cause of death was not gi\en, but a Hanoi broadcast on
March 26 said Thang had been ill since August and his condition
was "very grave."
rhang became president of North Vietnam during one of the
bloodiest periods of the Vietnamese War and one year before
Washington began its phased withdrawal of American troops. The
U.S.-backed government in southern Vietnam surrendered in
April 1975 and I'hang became president of the unified Socialist
Republic of Vietnam when it was formally established in 1976.
A Western analyst in Bangkok said Thang may also have been
the last president of Vietnam, as the new constitution makes no
reference to the office of president.
Hie presidential post is largely ceremonial, but Thang had solid
credentials as a revolutionary dating back to 1919. He spent 16
years in a French penal colony on Vietnam's Con Son Island and
officially joined the Vietnamese Communist Workers' Party in
1930 while in prison.
Administration predicts new CPI rise
WASHINGTON — The Carter Administration has raised its
1980 consumer price forecast by another notch in a gloomy foot
note to the budget-balancing package of spending cuts the presi
dent will submit to Congress today.
In its third and highest price forecast this year, the administration
is predicting the consumer price index will rise I 2.8 percent during
1980, roughly the same as last year.
Until now, even though consumer prices have been rising at an
annual rate of more than 18 percent since the end of 1979, the
administration had been predicting an abatement of the inflation
rate this year.
The projected 12.8 percent increase between the fourth quarters
of 1979 and 1980 represents an increase over President Jimmy
Carter's January forecast of 10.7 percent for the same period.
As recently as March 14, when Carter announced he would
propose a multibillion-dollar budget cut for I 98 1 in a attempt to
curb inflation, his economic advisers were talking in terms of a
1980 inflation rate of less than 12 percent.
The administration consistently has underestimated the inflation
rate: raising questions as to whether its latest forecast is more
realistic than the others — or a harbinger of worse to come.
Officials attributed the more pessimistic forecast largely to
higher oil prices and soaring interest rates, although they also have
warned recently that serious inflation is spreading more broadly
through the economy, making it harder to control.
But for 198 1 the administration continues to predict an end to
double-digit inflation, with the rate of price increases falling to 9
percent, up only marginally from its January estimate of 8.7 per
cent.
Nuclear demonstrators arrested in Vt.
VERNON, Vt. — Dozens of anti-nuclear demonstrators in a
crowd that had numbered 1 000 were arrested last night for block
ing the main gate of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant.
Police began making arrests around 7 p.m., when plant workers
who were going off duty sought to drive their cars out the gate but
found the way blocked.
About 50 protesters had been arrested by 9 p.m.
The demonstration, timed to coincide with the anniversary of
last year's accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania, followed a rally in nearby Brattleboro, Vt.
The demonstrators marched the five miles to the plant carrying
American flags and banners proclaiming "No Nukes" and "Yan
kee Go Home."
Soon after the more than 1 000 demonstrators had arranged
themselves outside the 540-megawatt plant Sunday afternoon,
plant security chief Bill Penniman told them to leave.
"You are trespassing and you are not welcome on these pre
mises," he said. "Please leave immediately."

— A long, thoughtful analysis of his Republican campaign,

whether to drop out of the GOP and run as an independent.
— Before speaking yesterday at a black church and attending a

rally at his Milwaukee headquarters, Anderson went to
Washington to appear on NBCs "Meet the Press." where he
refused to rule out an independent hid for the presidency. He said
he was making no plans for a third party race, hut added that many

Hazard seen in other Cascade peaks
VANCOUVER. Wash. — Mount St. Helens' violent awakening
from 123 years of dormancy should alert public officials and pri
vate citizens to the fact that several other serene-looking peaks in
the Cascade Range pose the potential for future volcanic activity,
leading geologists said yesterday.
Without exception, the experts monitoring the new eruptions
decline to predict if or when an> of Mount St. Helens' brethren —
Mount Ranier and Mount Baker in Washington State. Mount
Hood and Crater Lake in Oregon. Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak
in Northern California — could come to life with volcanic activity.
But they said their years of geological detective work convinced
them that more eruptions are likely in the centuries ahead as the
Cascades — still young in geological terms — display more of the
turmoil of adolescence.
"The potential hazard is real and warrants concern," said Donal
R. Mullineux, a Denver-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist,
who for a week has coordinated the scientific monitoring of Mount
St. Helens' behavior.
Mullineux and his colleagues, even before Mount St. Helens'
eruption, had done stacks of reports warning that ever-increasing
use of areas around many of the dormant volcanoes means that
more lives and property than ever would be endangered by vol
canic activity.
"It is fortunate that there has been very little development in the
area surrounding St. Helens." Mullineux said in an interview Sun
day. "It has not been nearly as great as around Rainier, where there
is much recreational activity, or Shasta, where many people are
moving in.
P.A. boy dies in roller coaster accident
SANTA CLARA — One train on a roller coaster plowed into
another, killing a teen-age boy and injuring eight passengers, and
an employee at Marriott's Great America Amusement Park said
electric eyes designed to keep the trains separated apparently had
failed.
Park spokesman Art Larson said yesterday the " Willard's Whiz
zer" ride would remain shut until they discovered what caused the
accident.
He said no explanation could be given until an investigation was
completed into Saturday evening's accident on the thrill ride that
features a seven-story "free fall" in which cars plummeting down a
track are restrained only by centrifugal force.
But an employee said there are two sets of electric eyes which
regulate the gap between the trains and he did not know why those
systems failed to prevent the accident.
"Two systems had to break down for this to occur," he said. "The
odds against that happening must be astronomical."
Eyewitnesses gave contrasting accounts of the accident, which
killed 13-year-old Kyle Foss of Palo Alto.
According to the unidentified employee, one train carrying more
than 20 riders inexplicably slowed down during a high-speed des
cent and was rammed from behind by another train traveling more
than 50 mph. Three passengers were thrown out of one car, while
other riders grabbed onto the sides of their cars.
"The boy that died landed on the rocks, and two other people
landed in a pool of water below the tracks." said the employee.
But another witness said yesterday that Foss was getting on the
ride at a loading platform when the second train hit from behind,
and that he was run over on the tracks.
California Democrats endorse Brown
LOS ANGELES — Sen. Edward Kennedy narrowly missed
gaining an endorsement by the California Democratic Council
yesterday in what had been viewed earlier as a "three-way" toss-up
between Kennedy. President Jimmy Carter and Gov. Jerry
Brown.
The Massachusetts senator garnered 59.76 percent of the vote ot
some 500 CDC delegates on the third ballot yesterday at the
CDCs 28th annual convention here, falling just short of the 60
percent mark required for a formal endorsement.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, CDC founding president, easily
won endorsement for his re-election campaign.
The delegates, representing about 20,000 liberal Democrats in
nearly 200 political clubs statewide, gave Brown 17.38 percent of

the first ballot vote and 10.16 vote on the second.
Carter managed only 15.36 percent on the first ballot, just above
the 15 percent cutoff required to make the second round of voting.
He was dropped from consideration after the second ballot when
his supporters caucused and decided to switch to the "no endorse
ment" column.
Representatives of all three candidates claimed victory in voting.
"He (Kennedy) was expected to get the endorsement," said
former state Sen. Nate Holen, Carter's spokesman. "Every major
speaker at this convention spoke on behalf of Kennedy. The dele
gates did not respond to Kennedy."
Brown's chief of staff Gray Davis said yesterday's vote for his
candidate could boost Brown's sagging campaign. Brown has yet to
win a single delegate for the Democratic national convention.
North Vietnamese President Thang dies
BANGKOK, Thailand — I on Due Thang, who became presi
dent of North Vietnam on the death of revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh in 1 969 and later was the first and only president of a unified
Vietnam, died vesterdav. Radio Hanoi announced. It said Thang
was 91.
Fhe cause of death was not gi\en, but a Hanoi broadcast on
March 26 said Thang had been ill since August and his condition
was "very grave."
rhang became president of North Vietnam during one of the
bloodiest periods of the Vietnamese War and one year before
Washington began its phased withdrawal of American troops. The
U.S.-backed government in southern Vietnam surrendered in
April 1975 and I'hang became president of the unified Socialist
Republic of Vietnam when it was formally established in 1976.
A Western analyst in Bangkok said Thang may also have been
the last president of Vietnam, as the new constitution makes no
reference to the office of president.
Hie presidential post is largely ceremonial, but Thang had solid
credentials as a revolutionary dating back to 1919. He spent 16
years in a French penal colony on Vietnam's Con Son Island and
officially joined the Vietnamese Communist Workers' Party in
1930 while in prison.
Administration predicts new CPI rise
WASHINGTON — The Carter Administration has raised its
1980 consumer price forecast by another notch in a gloomy foot
note to the budget-balancing package of spending cuts the presi
dent will submit to Congress today.
In its third and highest price forecast this year, the administration
is predicting the consumer price index will rise I 2.8 percent during
1980, roughly the same as last year.
Until now, even though consumer prices have been rising at an
annual rate of more than 18 percent since the end of 1979, the
administration had been predicting an abatement of the inflation
rate this year.
The projected 12.8 percent increase between the fourth quarters
of 1979 and 1980 represents an increase over President Jimmy
Carter's January forecast of 10.7 percent for the same period.
As recently as March 14, when Carter announced he would
propose a multibillion-dollar budget cut for I 98 1 in a attempt to
curb inflation, his economic advisers were talking in terms of a
1980 inflation rate of less than 12 percent.
The administration consistently has underestimated the inflation
rate: raising questions as to whether its latest forecast is more
realistic than the others — or a harbinger of worse to come.
Officials attributed the more pessimistic forecast largely to
higher oil prices and soaring interest rates, although they also have
warned recently that serious inflation is spreading more broadly
through the economy, making it harder to control.
But for 198 1 the administration continues to predict an end to
double-digit inflation, with the rate of price increases falling to 9
percent, up only marginally from its January estimate of 8.7 per
cent.
Nuclear demonstrators arrested in Vt.
VERNON, Vt. — Dozens of anti-nuclear demonstrators in a
crowd that had numbered 1 000 were arrested last night for block
ing the main gate of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant.
Police began making arrests around 7 p.m., when plant workers
who were going off duty sought to drive their cars out the gate but
found the way blocked.
About 50 protesters had been arrested by 9 p.m.
The demonstration, timed to coincide with the anniversary of
last year's accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania, followed a rally in nearby Brattleboro, Vt.
The demonstrators marched the five miles to the plant carrying
American flags and banners proclaiming "No Nukes" and "Yan
kee Go Home."
Soon after the more than 1 000 demonstrators had arranged
themselves outside the 540-megawatt plant Sunday afternoon,
plant security chief Bill Penniman told them to leave.
"You are trespassing and you are not welcome on these pre
mises," he said. "Please leave immediately."

Iran claims receipt of U.S. ultimatum
TEHRAN, Iran — The United States sent Iran an ultimatum
yesterday threatening stiff economic and political sanctions unless
the 50 American hostages held at the U.S. Embassy are transferred
immediately to the custody of the government, Iranian officials
said.
They said President Jimmy Carter, in a new message to President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. warned that his patience was running out
aftei almost five months of deadlock over the hostages, who are
being held by Moslem militants.
"They have given me an ultimatum," an aide to Bani-Sadr
quoted the president as saying.
Fhe ruling Revolutionary Council met for more than four hours
last night to discuss the issue, officials said. After the meeting.
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said the council had agreed
to transfer the hostages out of the embassy — but he admitted that
the proposal had not vet been approved by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iran's revolutionary leader.
• We discussed the transfer of the hostages." Ghotbzadeh told
the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post. "I think it will be
done very shortly, within a few days."
Hie reported ultimatum gave the Iranians until tonight Tehran
time to take the hostages out of the hands of the Moslem students
who seized them and the embassy Nov. 4. government sources said.
An air of new optimism became evident in U.S. government
circles last night that a break might come soon in the stalemate over
the American hostages in Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh predicted that the
hostages, held bv militants in the U.S. embassy compound in
Tehran since Nov 4. would "soon" be turned over to the control of
the Iranian government.
In the roller-coaster history of attempts to solve the hostage
crisis, however, officials of the new Iranian government have re
peated! v believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough —only
to have Khomeini abruptly reject the product of their negotiations.
Colombian guerrillas release 2 hostages
BOGOTA. Colombia — Guerrillas holding hostages in the
Dominican Republic Embassy yesterday released two of their 29
captives seized in the embassy takeover more than a month ago.
Among the 27 still held in the embassy is U.S. Ambassador
Diego Asencio.
The two freed are not diplomats. A Foreign Ministry source
identified them as Simon Rodriguez, a magistrate from the Cun
dinamarca region, and Jorge Valencia, publisher of the magazine
Murtdo Diplomatico (Diplomatic World).
Thev were taken by police to a military hospital to be examined.
The men came around the corner at the head of the deadend
street leading to the embassy at about 5:30 p.m. Reporters watch
ing from a roped-off area about 100 yards away said the men were
pushing a red \ olkswagon that had been parked near the embassy.
The vehicle was pushed to one side of the military command post
around the corner from the embassy and was thoroughly searched
bv militarv police, who declined to say why the Volkswagen had
been used.
The two men went inside the command post and then entered
another car parked outside and were driven away.
A priest who visited the embassy Friday with a message from
Pope John Paul 11 told reporters afterwards that "the comandante
(who leads the embassy guerrillas) told me that all those without
diplomatic rank would be released during Holy Week."
That would have included four foreigners and four Colombians,
before yesterday's release, and could include two Colombian pro
tocol officers.
Anderson may quit, calls Brown *a joke'
Mil WAUKEE — Rep. John Anderson (R-lll) thinks that he
might scuttle his presidential bid if he does not get 25 percent of the
Wisconsin vote. He calls Gov. Jerry Brow n. of California "a

paign.
In shirt-sleeves candor, he engages reporters in running debates

argument between the candidate and his wife over Sen. Edward
Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.
During one of these sessions while flying from Oshkosh to Mil
waukee before setting out yesterday on his last three days of

California Democrats endorse Brown
LOS ANGELES — Sen. Edward Kennedy narrowly missed
gaining an endorsement by the California Democratic Council
yesterday in what had been viewed earlier as a "three-way" toss-up
between Kennedy. President Jimmy Carter and Gov. Jerry
Brown.
The Massachusetts senator garnered 59.76 percent of the vote ot
some 500 CDC delegates on the third ballot yesterday at the
CDCs 28th annual convention here, falling just short of the 60
percent mark required for a formal endorsement.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, CDC founding president, easily
won endorsement for his re-election campaign.
The delegates, representing about 20,000 liberal Democrats in
nearly 200 political clubs statewide, gave Brown 17.38 percent of

the first ballot vote and 10.16 vote on the second.
Carter managed only 15.36 percent on the first ballot, just above
the 15 percent cutoff required to make the second round of voting.
He was dropped from consideration after the second ballot when
his supporters caucused and decided to switch to the "no endorse
ment" column.
Representatives of all three candidates claimed victory in voting.
"He (Kennedy) was expected to get the endorsement," said
former state Sen. Nate Holen, Carter's spokesman. "Every major
speaker at this convention spoke on behalf of Kennedy. The dele
gates did not respond to Kennedy."
Brown's chief of staff Gray Davis said yesterday's vote for his
candidate could boost Brown's sagging campaign. Brown has yet to
win a single delegate for the Democratic national convention.
North Vietnamese President Thang dies
BANGKOK, Thailand — I on Due Thang, who became presi
dent of North Vietnam on the death of revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh in 1 969 and later was the first and only president of a unified
Vietnam, died vesterdav. Radio Hanoi announced. It said Thang
was 91.
Fhe cause of death was not gi\en, but a Hanoi broadcast on
March 26 said Thang had been ill since August and his condition
was "very grave."
rhang became president of North Vietnam during one of the
bloodiest periods of the Vietnamese War and one year before
Washington began its phased withdrawal of American troops. The
U.S.-backed government in southern Vietnam surrendered in
April 1975 and I'hang became president of the unified Socialist
Republic of Vietnam when it was formally established in 1976.
A Western analyst in Bangkok said Thang may also have been
the last president of Vietnam, as the new constitution makes no
reference to the office of president.
Hie presidential post is largely ceremonial, but Thang had solid
credentials as a revolutionary dating back to 1919. He spent 16
years in a French penal colony on Vietnam's Con Son Island and
officially joined the Vietnamese Communist Workers' Party in
1930 while in prison.
Administration predicts new CPI rise
WASHINGTON — The Carter Administration has raised its
1980 consumer price forecast by another notch in a gloomy foot
note to the budget-balancing package of spending cuts the presi
dent will submit to Congress today.
In its third and highest price forecast this year, the administration
is predicting the consumer price index will rise I 2.8 percent during
1980, roughly the same as last year.
Until now, even though consumer prices have been rising at an
annual rate of more than 18 percent since the end of 1979, the
administration had been predicting an abatement of the inflation
rate this year.
The projected 12.8 percent increase between the fourth quarters
of 1979 and 1980 represents an increase over President Jimmy
Carter's January forecast of 10.7 percent for the same period.
As recently as March 14, when Carter announced he would
propose a multibillion-dollar budget cut for I 98 1 in a attempt to
curb inflation, his economic advisers were talking in terms of a
1980 inflation rate of less than 12 percent.
The administration consistently has underestimated the inflation
rate: raising questions as to whether its latest forecast is more
realistic than the others — or a harbinger of worse to come.
Officials attributed the more pessimistic forecast largely to
higher oil prices and soaring interest rates, although they also have
warned recently that serious inflation is spreading more broadly
through the economy, making it harder to control.
But for 198 1 the administration continues to predict an end to
double-digit inflation, with the rate of price increases falling to 9
percent, up only marginally from its January estimate of 8.7 per
cent.
Nuclear demonstrators arrested in Vt.
VERNON, Vt. — Dozens of anti-nuclear demonstrators in a
crowd that had numbered 1 000 were arrested last night for block
ing the main gate of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant.
Police began making arrests around 7 p.m., when plant workers
who were going off duty sought to drive their cars out the gate but
found the way blocked.
About 50 protesters had been arrested by 9 p.m.
The demonstration, timed to coincide with the anniversary of
last year's accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania, followed a rally in nearby Brattleboro, Vt.
The demonstrators marched the five miles to the plant carrying
American flags and banners proclaiming "No Nukes" and "Yan
kee Go Home."
Soon after the more than 1 000 demonstrators had arranged
themselves outside the 540-megawatt plant Sunday afternoon,
plant security chief Bill Penniman told them to leave.
"You are trespassing and you are not welcome on these pre
mises," he said. "Please leave immediately."

Iran claims receipt of U.S. ultimatum
TEHRAN, Iran — The United States sent Iran an ultimatum
yesterday threatening stiff economic and political sanctions unless
the 50 American hostages held at the U.S. Embassy are transferred
immediately to the custody of the government, Iranian officials
said.
They said President Jimmy Carter, in a new message to President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. warned that his patience was running out
aftei almost five months of deadlock over the hostages, who are
being held by Moslem militants.
"They have given me an ultimatum," an aide to Bani-Sadr
quoted the president as saying.
Fhe ruling Revolutionary Council met for more than four hours
last night to discuss the issue, officials said. After the meeting.
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said the council had agreed
to transfer the hostages out of the embassy — but he admitted that
the proposal had not vet been approved by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iran's revolutionary leader.
• We discussed the transfer of the hostages." Ghotbzadeh told
the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post. "I think it will be
done very shortly, within a few days."
Hie reported ultimatum gave the Iranians until tonight Tehran
time to take the hostages out of the hands of the Moslem students
who seized them and the embassy Nov. 4. government sources said.
An air of new optimism became evident in U.S. government
circles last night that a break might come soon in the stalemate over
the American hostages in Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh predicted that the
hostages, held bv militants in the U.S. embassy compound in
Tehran since Nov 4. would "soon" be turned over to the control of
the Iranian government.
In the roller-coaster history of attempts to solve the hostage
crisis, however, officials of the new Iranian government have re
peated! v believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough —only
to have Khomeini abruptly reject the product of their negotiations.
Colombian guerrillas release 2 hostages
BOGOTA. Colombia — Guerrillas holding hostages in the
Dominican Republic Embassy yesterday released two of their 29
captives seized in the embassy takeover more than a month ago.
Among the 27 still held in the embassy is U.S. Ambassador
Diego Asencio.
The two freed are not diplomats. A Foreign Ministry source
identified them as Simon Rodriguez, a magistrate from the Cun
dinamarca region, and Jorge Valencia, publisher of the magazine
Murtdo Diplomatico (Diplomatic World).
Thev were taken by police to a military hospital to be examined.
The men came around the corner at the head of the deadend
street leading to the embassy at about 5:30 p.m. Reporters watch
ing from a roped-off area about 100 yards away said the men were
pushing a red \ olkswagon that had been parked near the embassy.
The vehicle was pushed to one side of the military command post
around the corner from the embassy and was thoroughly searched
bv militarv police, who declined to say why the Volkswagen had
been used.
The two men went inside the command post and then entered
another car parked outside and were driven away.
A priest who visited the embassy Friday with a message from
Pope John Paul 11 told reporters afterwards that "the comandante
(who leads the embassy guerrillas) told me that all those without
diplomatic rank would be released during Holy Week."
That would have included four foreigners and four Colombians,
before yesterday's release, and could include two Colombian pro
tocol officers.
Anderson may quit, calls Brown *a joke'
Mil WAUKEE — Rep. John Anderson (R-lll) thinks that he
might scuttle his presidential bid if he does not get 25 percent of the
Wisconsin vote. He calls Gov. Jerry Brow n. of California "a
joke." And he says "George Bush has had it" in the 1980 cam
paign.
In shirt-sleeves candor, he engages reporters in running debates
aboard his campaign planes — including one that ended in an
argument between the candidate and his wife over Sen. Edward
Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.
During one of these sessions while flying from Oshkosh to Mil
waukee before setting out yesterday on his last three days of
campaigning in a half-dozen cities for the Wisconsin primary to
morrow. Anderson also offered in quick succession:
— An announcement that Cheap Trick, a hometown group from
Rockford. 111., will stage a rock concert to raise money for his
campaign.
— The wish that television producer Norman Lear would throw
a big party for him in the Hollywood Palladium.
— A long, thoughtful analysis of his Republican campaign,
saying that the success or failure of his drive to re-register as
Republicans Californians who are Democrats will help him decide
whether to drop out of the GOP and run as an independent.
— Before speaking yesterday at a black church and attending a

rally at his Milwaukee headquarters, Anderson went to
Washington to appear on NBCs "Meet the Press." where he
refused to rule out an independent hid for the presidency. He said
he was making no plans for a third party race, hut added that many
of his 71.000 campaign contributors are "unhappy with the choice
merely between (former Gov. Ronald) Reagan (of California)and
(President Jimmy) Carter in November."
While denying that he sits up nights "thinking about indepen
dent candidacies and third parties." Anderson acknowledged he
will weigh heavily the response from independents and crossover
Democrats in California in reaching a decision about leaving his
party.
Last week, Anderson said he would make that decision in 30
days — before the California primary.
Hazard seen in other Cascade peaks
VANCOUVER. Wash. — Mount St. Helens' violent awakening
from 123 years of dormancy should alert public officials and pri
vate citizens to the fact that several other serene-looking peaks in
the Cascade Range pose the potential for future volcanic activity,
leading geologists said yesterday.
Without exception, the experts monitoring the new eruptions
decline to predict if or when an> of Mount St. Helens' brethren —
Mount Ranier and Mount Baker in Washington State. Mount
Hood and Crater Lake in Oregon. Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak
in Northern California — could come to life with volcanic activity.
But they said their years of geological detective work convinced
them that more eruptions are likely in the centuries ahead as the
Cascades — still young in geological terms — display more of the
turmoil of adolescence.
"The potential hazard is real and warrants concern," said Donal
R. Mullineux, a Denver-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist,
who for a week has coordinated the scientific monitoring of Mount
St. Helens' behavior.
Mullineux and his colleagues, even before Mount St. Helens'
eruption, had done stacks of reports warning that ever-increasing
use of areas around many of the dormant volcanoes means that
more lives and property than ever would be endangered by vol
canic activity.
"It is fortunate that there has been very little development in the
area surrounding St. Helens." Mullineux said in an interview Sun
day. "It has not been nearly as great as around Rainier, where there
is much recreational activity, or Shasta, where many people are
moving in.
P.A. boy dies in roller coaster accident
SANTA CLARA — One train on a roller coaster plowed into
another, killing a teen-age boy and injuring eight passengers, and
an employee at Marriott's Great America Amusement Park said
electric eyes designed to keep the trains separated apparently had
failed.
Park spokesman Art Larson said yesterday the " Willard's Whiz
zer" ride would remain shut until they discovered what caused the
accident.
He said no explanation could be given until an investigation was
completed into Saturday evening's accident on the thrill ride that
features a seven-story "free fall" in which cars plummeting down a
track are restrained only by centrifugal force.
But an employee said there are two sets of electric eyes which
regulate the gap between the trains and he did not know why those
systems failed to prevent the accident.
"Two systems had to break down for this to occur," he said. "The
odds against that happening must be astronomical."
Eyewitnesses gave contrasting accounts of the accident, which
killed 13-year-old Kyle Foss of Palo Alto.
According to the unidentified employee, one train carrying more
than 20 riders inexplicably slowed down during a high-speed des
cent and was rammed from behind by another train traveling more
than 50 mph. Three passengers were thrown out of one car, while
other riders grabbed onto the sides of their cars.
"The boy that died landed on the rocks, and two other people
landed in a pool of water below the tracks." said the employee.
But another witness said yesterday that Foss was getting on the
ride at a loading platform when the second train hit from behind,
and that he was run over on the tracks.

But for 198 1 the administration continues to predict an end to
double-digit inflation, with the rate of price increases falling to 9

cent.
Nuclear demonstrators arrested in Vt.
VERNON, Vt. — Dozens of anti-nuclear demonstrators in a
crowd that had numbered 1 000 were arrested last night for block
ing the main gate of the Vermont Yankee nuclear power plant.
Police began making arrests around 7 p.m., when plant workers
who were going off duty sought to drive their cars out the gate but
found the way blocked.
About 50 protesters had been arrested by 9 p.m.
The demonstration, timed to coincide with the anniversary of
last year's accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in
Pennsylvania, followed a rally in nearby Brattleboro, Vt.
The demonstrators marched the five miles to the plant carrying
American flags and banners proclaiming "No Nukes" and "Yan
kee Go Home."
Soon after the more than 1 000 demonstrators had arranged
themselves outside the 540-megawatt plant Sunday afternoon,
plant security chief Bill Penniman told them to leave.
"You are trespassing and you are not welcome on these pre
mises," he said. "Please leave immediately."

Iran claims receipt of U.S. ultimatum
TEHRAN, Iran — The United States sent Iran an ultimatum
yesterday threatening stiff economic and political sanctions unless
the 50 American hostages held at the U.S. Embassy are transferred
immediately to the custody of the government, Iranian officials
said.
They said President Jimmy Carter, in a new message to President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr. warned that his patience was running out
aftei almost five months of deadlock over the hostages, who are
being held by Moslem militants.
"They have given me an ultimatum," an aide to Bani-Sadr
quoted the president as saying.
Fhe ruling Revolutionary Council met for more than four hours
last night to discuss the issue, officials said. After the meeting.
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said the council had agreed
to transfer the hostages out of the embassy — but he admitted that
the proposal had not vet been approved by Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini. Iran's revolutionary leader.
• We discussed the transfer of the hostages." Ghotbzadeh told
the Los Angeles Times and the Washington Post. "I think it will be
done very shortly, within a few days."
Hie reported ultimatum gave the Iranians until tonight Tehran
time to take the hostages out of the hands of the Moslem students
who seized them and the embassy Nov. 4. government sources said.
An air of new optimism became evident in U.S. government
circles last night that a break might come soon in the stalemate over
the American hostages in Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh predicted that the
hostages, held bv militants in the U.S. embassy compound in
Tehran since Nov 4. would "soon" be turned over to the control of
the Iranian government.
In the roller-coaster history of attempts to solve the hostage
crisis, however, officials of the new Iranian government have re
peated! v believed they were on the verge of a breakthrough —only
to have Khomeini abruptly reject the product of their negotiations.
Colombian guerrillas release 2 hostages
BOGOTA. Colombia — Guerrillas holding hostages in the
Dominican Republic Embassy yesterday released two of their 29
captives seized in the embassy takeover more than a month ago.
Among the 27 still held in the embassy is U.S. Ambassador
Diego Asencio.
The two freed are not diplomats. A Foreign Ministry source
identified them as Simon Rodriguez, a magistrate from the Cun
dinamarca region, and Jorge Valencia, publisher of the magazine
Murtdo Diplomatico (Diplomatic World).
Thev were taken by police to a military hospital to be examined.
The men came around the corner at the head of the deadend
street leading to the embassy at about 5:30 p.m. Reporters watch
ing from a roped-off area about 100 yards away said the men were
pushing a red \ olkswagon that had been parked near the embassy.
The vehicle was pushed to one side of the military command post
around the corner from the embassy and was thoroughly searched
bv militarv police, who declined to say why the Volkswagen had
been used.
The two men went inside the command post and then entered
another car parked outside and were driven away.
A priest who visited the embassy Friday with a message from
Pope John Paul 11 told reporters afterwards that "the comandante
(who leads the embassy guerrillas) told me that all those without
diplomatic rank would be released during Holy Week."
That would have included four foreigners and four Colombians,
before yesterday's release, and could include two Colombian pro
tocol officers.
Anderson may quit, calls Brown *a joke'
Mil WAUKEE — Rep. John Anderson (R-lll) thinks that he
might scuttle his presidential bid if he does not get 25 percent of the
Wisconsin vote. He calls Gov. Jerry Brow n. of California "a
joke." And he says "George Bush has had it" in the 1980 cam
paign.
In shirt-sleeves candor, he engages reporters in running debates
aboard his campaign planes — including one that ended in an
argument between the candidate and his wife over Sen. Edward
Kennedy and Chappaquiddick.
During one of these sessions while flying from Oshkosh to Mil
waukee before setting out yesterday on his last three days of
campaigning in a half-dozen cities for the Wisconsin primary to
morrow. Anderson also offered in quick succession:
— An announcement that Cheap Trick, a hometown group from
Rockford. 111., will stage a rock concert to raise money for his
campaign.
— The wish that television producer Norman Lear would throw
a big party for him in the Hollywood Palladium.
— A long, thoughtful analysis of his Republican campaign,
saying that the success or failure of his drive to re-register as
Republicans Californians who are Democrats will help him decide
whether to drop out of the GOP and run as an independent.
— Before speaking yesterday at a black church and attending a

rally at his Milwaukee headquarters, Anderson went to
Washington to appear on NBCs "Meet the Press." where he
refused to rule out an independent hid for the presidency. He said
he was making no plans for a third party race, hut added that many
of his 71.000 campaign contributors are "unhappy with the choice
merely between (former Gov. Ronald) Reagan (of California)and
(President Jimmy) Carter in November."
While denying that he sits up nights "thinking about indepen
dent candidacies and third parties." Anderson acknowledged he
will weigh heavily the response from independents and crossover
Democrats in California in reaching a decision about leaving his
party.
Last week, Anderson said he would make that decision in 30
days — before the California primary.
Hazard seen in other Cascade peaks
VANCOUVER. Wash. — Mount St. Helens' violent awakening
from 123 years of dormancy should alert public officials and pri
vate citizens to the fact that several other serene-looking peaks in
the Cascade Range pose the potential for future volcanic activity,
leading geologists said yesterday.
Without exception, the experts monitoring the new eruptions
decline to predict if or when an> of Mount St. Helens' brethren —
Mount Ranier and Mount Baker in Washington State. Mount
Hood and Crater Lake in Oregon. Mount Shasta and Lassen Peak
in Northern California — could come to life with volcanic activity.
But they said their years of geological detective work convinced
them that more eruptions are likely in the centuries ahead as the
Cascades — still young in geological terms — display more of the
turmoil of adolescence.
"The potential hazard is real and warrants concern," said Donal
R. Mullineux, a Denver-based U.S. Geological Survey geologist,
who for a week has coordinated the scientific monitoring of Mount
St. Helens' behavior.
Mullineux and his colleagues, even before Mount St. Helens'
eruption, had done stacks of reports warning that ever-increasing
use of areas around many of the dormant volcanoes means that
more lives and property than ever would be endangered by vol
canic activity.
"It is fortunate that there has been very little development in the
area surrounding St. Helens." Mullineux said in an interview Sun
day. "It has not been nearly as great as around Rainier, where there
is much recreational activity, or Shasta, where many people are
moving in.
P.A. boy dies in roller coaster accident
SANTA CLARA — One train on a roller coaster plowed into
another, killing a teen-age boy and injuring eight passengers, and
an employee at Marriott's Great America Amusement Park said
electric eyes designed to keep the trains separated apparently had
failed.
Park spokesman Art Larson said yesterday the " Willard's Whiz
zer" ride would remain shut until they discovered what caused the
accident.
He said no explanation could be given until an investigation was
completed into Saturday evening's accident on the thrill ride that
features a seven-story "free fall" in which cars plummeting down a
track are restrained only by centrifugal force.
But an employee said there are two sets of electric eyes which
regulate the gap between the trains and he did not know why those
systems failed to prevent the accident.
"Two systems had to break down for this to occur," he said. "The
odds against that happening must be astronomical."
Eyewitnesses gave contrasting accounts of the accident, which
killed 13-year-old Kyle Foss of Palo Alto.
According to the unidentified employee, one train carrying more
than 20 riders inexplicably slowed down during a high-speed des
cent and was rammed from behind by another train traveling more
than 50 mph. Three passengers were thrown out of one car, while
other riders grabbed onto the sides of their cars.
"The boy that died landed on the rocks, and two other people
landed in a pool of water below the tracks." said the employee.
But another witness said yesterday that Foss was getting on the
ride at a loading platform when the second train hit from behind,
and that he was run over on the tracks.
California Democrats endorse Brown
LOS ANGELES — Sen. Edward Kennedy narrowly missed
gaining an endorsement by the California Democratic Council
yesterday in what had been viewed earlier as a "three-way" toss-up
between Kennedy. President Jimmy Carter and Gov. Jerry
Brown.
The Massachusetts senator garnered 59.76 percent of the vote ot
some 500 CDC delegates on the third ballot yesterday at the
CDCs 28th annual convention here, falling just short of the 60
percent mark required for a formal endorsement.
California Sen. Alan Cranston, CDC founding president, easily
won endorsement for his re-election campaign.
The delegates, representing about 20,000 liberal Democrats in
nearly 200 political clubs statewide, gave Brown 17.38 percent of

the first ballot vote and 10.16 vote on the second.
Carter managed only 15.36 percent on the first ballot, just above
the 15 percent cutoff required to make the second round of voting.
He was dropped from consideration after the second ballot when
his supporters caucused and decided to switch to the "no endorse
ment" column.
Representatives of all three candidates claimed victory in voting.
"He (Kennedy) was expected to get the endorsement," said
former state Sen. Nate Holen, Carter's spokesman. "Every major
speaker at this convention spoke on behalf of Kennedy. The dele
gates did not respond to Kennedy."
Brown's chief of staff Gray Davis said yesterday's vote for his
candidate could boost Brown's sagging campaign. Brown has yet to
win a single delegate for the Democratic national convention.
North Vietnamese President Thang dies
BANGKOK, Thailand — I on Due Thang, who became presi
dent of North Vietnam on the death of revolutionary leader Ho Chi
Minh in 1 969 and later was the first and only president of a unified
Vietnam, died vesterdav. Radio Hanoi announced. It said Thang
was 91.
Fhe cause of death was not gi\en, but a Hanoi broadcast on
March 26 said Thang had been ill since August and his condition
was "very grave."
rhang became president of North Vietnam during one of the
bloodiest periods of the Vietnamese War and one year before
Washington began its phased withdrawal of American troops. The
U.S.-backed government in southern Vietnam surrendered in
April 1975 and I'hang became president of the unified Socialist
Republic of Vietnam when it was formally established in 1976.
A Western analyst in Bangkok said Thang may also have been
the last president of Vietnam, as the new constitution makes no
reference to the office of president.
Hie presidential post is largely ceremonial, but Thang had solid
credentials as a revolutionary dating back to 1919. He spent 16
years in a French penal colony on Vietnam's Con Son Island and
officially joined the Vietnamese Communist Workers' Party in
1930 while in prison.
Administration predicts new CPI rise
WASHINGTON — The Carter Administration has raised its
1980 consumer price forecast by another notch in a gloomy foot
note to the budget-balancing package of spending cuts the presi
dent will submit to Congress today.
In its third and highest price forecast this year, the administration
is predicting the consumer price index will rise I 2.8 percent during
1980, roughly the same as last year.
Until now, even though consumer prices have been rising at an
annual rate of more than 18 percent since the end of 1979, the
administration had been predicting an abatement of the inflation
rate this year.
The projected 12.8 percent increase between the fourth quarters
of 1979 and 1980 represents an increase over President Jimmy
Carter's January forecast of 10.7 percent for the same period.
As recently as March 14, when Carter announced he would
propose a multibillion-dollar budget cut for I 98 1 in a attempt to
curb inflation, his economic advisers were talking in terms of a
1980 inflation rate of less than 12 percent.
The administration consistently has underestimated the inflation
rate: raising questions as to whether its latest forecast is more
realistic than the others — or a harbinger of worse to come.
Officials attributed the more pessimistic forecast largely to
higher oil prices and soaring interest rates, although they also have
warned recently that serious inflation is spreading more broadly
through the economy, making it harder to control.
But for 198 1 the administration continues to predict an end to
double-digit inflation, with the rate of price increases falling to 9
percent, up only marginally from its January estimate of 8.7 per
cent.
