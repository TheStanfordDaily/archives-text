# Student dies at home during break

### 
Tim Davis, a second-year student
with senior status here, died in his sleep
of a brain hemorrhage at his Rancho
Pales Verdes, Calif., home March 21.
He was 19 years old.
Davis, a resident of the French
house, was majoring in philosophy,
French and Italian. "He was a shining,
radiant person," said Kamal Zein. re
sident fellow at the French House. "I'm
totally shocked."
Davis is survived by his parents, a
younger brother, two older sisters and
an older brother.
Zein said no memorial service has
been organized yet for Davis because

residents of the house wanted to wait
until most of the residents had returned
from vacation to decide on a memorial
for Davis.
Davis taught an undergraduate spe
cial course this year in the history of the
opera, enrolling 25 students. Zein cal
led Davis very bright; "he was so good
in French I was happy he was going to
be living in the house," he said.
Zein said Davis had always played
with the Zeins' two-year-old daughter
and that Zein had still not absorbed the
news of Davis' death.
The few French house residents who
had already returned from spring break

expressed astonishment upon learning
of Davis' demise. "I just can't believe
it," said one resident. "Tim was one of
the most lively and energetic people
I've ever known. He had an incredible
zest for life. He could study all day,
dance all night and never appear
tired."
Davis' parents said that Davis had
had no indication of any serious illness
or brain damage and that he had appa
rently died without pain.
Davis lived in Donner house last
year and was planning to spend next
year at the Stanford campus in Flor
ence.
