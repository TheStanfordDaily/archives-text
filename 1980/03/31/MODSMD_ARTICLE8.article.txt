# Spring senate election proposal on ballot
## 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
After lengthy debate, the ASSU Senate voted in
last quarter's final meeting to place a constitutional
amendment on the spring ballot to move senate elec
tions from fall to spring quarter. If approved, the
senate elections would be held 19 days after the April
15 and 16 balloting.
Two-thirds of the students voting must vote yes to
pass the election reform measure.
Holding ASSU elections in the spring would help
alleviate the problem of organizing a senate in the fall
when other elected bodies — the Council of Presi
dents and Senior Class Presidents — as well as Uni
versity committees, are chosen in the spring, accord
ing to a number of senators. A spring election would
lead to more continuity, according to some of the
measure's proponents.
Alternate Senator Yvonne Hiltz urged placement
of the measure on the spring ballot, saying "the con
tinuity of this year's discussion would be lost if we
don't implement the reform this year."
"We're still around this spring and still available to
make the transition smoother," added Sen. Chris
Heftel.
Some senators voiced opposition to the proposal,
saying that if approved it might be unfair to students
now overseas who left the home campus assuming
they could run for office next fall. Sen. Mark Ven
tresca disagreed. The "whole purpose of this reform
is to start something, not finish it."
ASSU co-president Laura Mead, suggested the se
nate change the bylaws to allow overseas students a

ratified percentage on petitions, proportional to the
population on their individual campuses.
The senate must publish a statement outlining both
pro and con arguments before any constitutional
change is placed before the student body. The state
ment will be available before the balloting.
In other business, the senate unanimously ap
proved three resolutions submitted by the Coffee
House Task Force to endorse the Coffee House bid;
empower Senators Chris Greene and Dick Butter
field, COP member Mead and Financial Manager
Bruce Bendix to negotiate the contract and to give
Greene and Bendix the power to sign the binding
contract; and to encourage the University administ
ration to endorse the ASSU Coffee House Task
Force.
Butterfield highlighted the major components of
the proposal, calling the financial estimates "conser
vative." He predicted a 12.5 percent return on net
sales with a minimum profit of $48,000 expected.
Last night, there was speculation among some se
nate members that the ASSU bid was in jeopardy. A
final decision on the bids will be announced Wednes
day.
The Finance Committee submitted its recommen
dations for fee assessments and program fees. The
senate approved by a 14 to 1 vote the placement of
eight fee assessment requests on the spring ballot,
including Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), the Lcland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, Volunteers in Asia, Graduate Stu
dents Association, Academic Organizations Board,

ASSU Legal Counseling Office, Speaker's Bureau
and the Publication Board. Stanford-in-
Government's request to place its fee assessment on
the ballot was denied.
A number of organizations submitted requests to
taling $67,772 to the Program Board of which
$20,000 was allocated for next year's activities. The
Academic Organization Board, which helps finance
some academic groups, grants $3901 of the $10,012
that was requested of it. Both funding grants must be
approved by the senate.
The program fee allocations were disputed by COP
member Sibby Freeman who questioned what he cal
led a disproportionate allocation given to minority
groups, specifically black organizations.
Freeman cited a ratio of $1 1 allocated from every
$100 requested by the minority groups compared to
an appropriation to other organizations of $29.81
from every $100 requested. Greene, chairman of the
Finance Committee, said the "minority situation this
year is much better than last year. These figures are
totally defendable." He presented a comparison of
funds totaling $6785 granted last year to this year's
allocation of $8385 to minority groups.
"We went through the budgets, took out extrane
ous components, advised them where to go for other
funding sources and then funded what was approp
riate," said committee member Renee Richards.
Other senate action included approval of a request
by the Guest Professorship Board for salary compen
sation of Malaquias Monoya, a Chicano artist who
will teach two courses this quarter.

Force.
Butterfield highlighted the major components of
the proposal, calling the financial estimates "conser
vative." He predicted a 12.5 percent return on net
sales with a minimum profit of $48,000 expected.
Last night, there was speculation among some se
nate members that the ASSU bid was in jeopardy. A
final decision on the bids will be announced Wednes
day.
The Finance Committee submitted its recommen
dations for fee assessments and program fees. The
senate approved by a 14 to 1 vote the placement of
eight fee assessment requests on the spring ballot,
including Stanford Committee on Political Education
(SCOPE), the Lcland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, Volunteers in Asia, Graduate Stu
dents Association, Academic Organizations Board,

ASSU Legal Counseling Office, Speaker's Bureau
and the Publication Board. Stanford-in-
Government's request to place its fee assessment on
the ballot was denied.
A number of organizations submitted requests to
taling $67,772 to the Program Board of which
$20,000 was allocated for next year's activities. The
Academic Organization Board, which helps finance
some academic groups, grants $3901 of the $10,012
that was requested of it. Both funding grants must be
approved by the senate.
The program fee allocations were disputed by COP
member Sibby Freeman who questioned what he cal
led a disproportionate allocation given to minority
groups, specifically black organizations.
Freeman cited a ratio of $1 1 allocated from every
$100 requested by the minority groups compared to
an appropriation to other organizations of $29.81
from every $100 requested. Greene, chairman of the
Finance Committee, said the "minority situation this
year is much better than last year. These figures are
totally defendable." He presented a comparison of
funds totaling $6785 granted last year to this year's
allocation of $8385 to minority groups.
"We went through the budgets, took out extrane
ous components, advised them where to go for other
funding sources and then funded what was approp
riate," said committee member Renee Richards.
Other senate action included approval of a request
by the Guest Professorship Board for salary compen
sation of Malaquias Monoya, a Chicano artist who
will teach two courses this quarter.
After lengthy debate, the ASSU Senate voted in
last quarter's final meeting to place a constitutional
amendment on the spring ballot to move senate elec
tions from fall to spring quarter. If approved, the
senate elections would be held 19 days after the April
15 and 16 balloting.
Two-thirds of the students voting must vote yes to
pass the election reform measure.
Holding ASSU elections in the spring would help
alleviate the problem of organizing a senate in the fall
when other elected bodies — the Council of Presi
dents and Senior Class Presidents — as well as Uni
versity committees, are chosen in the spring, accord
ing to a number of senators. A spring election would
lead to more continuity, according to some of the
measure's proponents.
Alternate Senator Yvonne Hiltz urged placement
of the measure on the spring ballot, saying "the con
tinuity of this year's discussion would be lost if we
don't implement the reform this year."
"We're still around this spring and still available to
make the transition smoother," added Sen. Chris
Heftel.
Some senators voiced opposition to the proposal,
saying that if approved it might be unfair to students
now overseas who left the home campus assuming
they could run for office next fall. Sen. Mark Ven
tresca disagreed. The "whole purpose of this reform
is to start something, not finish it."
ASSU co-president Laura Mead, suggested the se
nate change the bylaws to allow overseas students a

ratified percentage on petitions, proportional to the
population on their individual campuses.
The senate must publish a statement outlining both
pro and con arguments before any constitutional
change is placed before the student body. The state
ment will be available before the balloting.
In other business, the senate unanimously ap
proved three resolutions submitted by the Coffee
House Task Force to endorse the Coffee House bid;
empower Senators Chris Greene and Dick Butter
field, COP member Mead and Financial Manager
Bruce Bendix to negotiate the contract and to give
Greene and Bendix the power to sign the binding
contract; and to encourage the University administ
ration to endorse the ASSU Coffee House Task
Force.
