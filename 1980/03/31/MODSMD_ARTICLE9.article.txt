## Yugoslavia: post-Tito pressures to face diverse nation 
### Robert Paul Jordan National Geographic 
WASHINGTON — Some
times it takes a joke to help exp
lain the Yugoslavs to the rest of
the world — and perhaps to
themselves. In one of the coun
try's six diverse republics —
Bosnia and Hercegovina — an
American journalist heard the
one about.
A Serb (short-tempered,
high-spirited) sits on a tack. He
curses and throws it away. A Slo
ven (industrious, thrifty) sits on a
tack. He pockets it for future use.

A Bosnian (hardworking, duti
ful ) sits on a tack. He says,"The
party may have directed that this
tack be placed here. 1 will put it
back."
Six main nationalities
A surprisingly coherent
mosaic of peoples and cultures.
Yugoslavia's 22 million citizens
belong to six major nationalities
and about a dozen other groups.
They speak three official lan

guages, practice three main re
ligious faiths, and use two al
phabets.
Most remarkable of all is the
fact that one man single
handedly welded this conglom
eration into a successful and
tough federation. Now an old
and worrisome question has
come into sharp focus. What
comes after Tito?
For three and a half decades,
President Josip Broz Tito
steered Yugoslavia on its inde
pendent course. A maverick
communist nation, it has man-

aged to look west as well as east.
As a government official in Bel
grade. the capital, told a visitor.
"We stand with both sides — and
apart from both sides."
It has been a difficult balanc
ing act at times. As the post-Tito
era begins. Yugoslavia finds its
geopolitical situation more deli
cate than ever. Some observers
feel that the country is vulnera
ble to internal political manipu

lation. Without Tito as supreme
arbiter, old nationalistic rivalries
might erupt.
Tito long ago provided for his
own succession and for national
defense. A collective leadership
now directs both the state and
the party. Members rotate to the
top for one-year terms.
Under the policy of total na
tional defense, every able
bodied Yugoslav has a mobiliza
tion assignment. The population
is armed, trained and oriented to
wage protracted guerrilla war
fare.

Tito showed his countrymen
how to defend their rugged land
in World War 11, when he led his
Partisans to victory over Nazi
Germany. From scattered
groups hidden in mountain
strongholds, the army swelled to
800,000 soldiers at war's end.
One in every eight was a woman
in uniform.
He spelled out his strategy
bluntly then, and it remained un

changed, "Keep to the partisan
type of warfare, avoid rigid
fronts. Destruction of communi
cations and transport, ambushes,
surprise raids bring greater suc
cess. while we sustain fewer los
ses."
Tito was not his real name.
Perhaps he acquired it from his
direct manner. A story goes that
he would habitually command,
speaking Serbo-Croatian, "You
— Ti — will do this. And you will
do that — to." Ti*. . .to.
True story or not. the name
stuck. It fit. Born Josip Broz in
1892 to a peasant family in
Croatia, seventh of 15 children,
he became a dedicated re
volutionary and Communist long
before he attracted the world's
attention as Marshal Tito of Par
tisan fame.
In 1948 he broke with Stalin
and led Yugoslavia out of the
Soviet orbit. Yugoslavia not only
would control its own destiny, it
would practice its own form of
socialism — decentralized and
worker managed.
In the 19605, Tito further as
serted his country's independent
outlook by helping found the
movement of nonaligned na
tions. He remained an outspo
ken leader of those nations.
His chief legacy, however, is
Yugoslavia itself. He built it, and
preserved it.
A natural conduit
Much of Yugoslavia lies at the
heart of the Balkans. Th is moun
tainous region is a natural con
duit between Asia and Europe.
Down the centuries Illyrians,
Celts, Greeks. Romans, barbaric
tribes from the steppes to the
north, Turks, Europeans and
others have played the con
queror. or the conquered.
Yugoslavia means Land of the
South Slavs. In the sixth and
seventh centuries A.D., under
pressure from various Asian
peoples, Slav tribes moved to the
south and southwest. They set

tied in the Balkan Peninsula.
Slav states began forming in
the ninth century — a kingdom
in Croatia, then another in
Macedonia. The first Serbian
state was created in the 12th cen
tury. Others developed: Mon
tenegro, Slovenia, Bosnia and
Hercegovina.
By the end of the 15th century
all had been conquered except a
tiny city-state, Dubrovnik, on
the Adriatic coast. Slovenes and
Croats chafed under the rule of
Austria-Hungary. The Ottoman
l urks controlled the rest of the
land, although Montenegro
never was fully subdued.
Shaping forces
History and geography have
shaped today's Yugoslavs. Cen
turies of Hapsburg domination
taught the Slovenes and Croats

to be industrious and methodi
cal. Montenegrins, proud moun
tain warriors, cling to their mar
tial heritage. Birth of a son, a
future warrior, signals a great
celebration; a daughter's arrival
creates little fuss.
The central fact of Yugoslavia
is not its disparate peoples and
cultures, however. Old national
animosities still exist, but the
web of union has been strongly
fashioned by Tito. As his day
ends, the nation has drawn closer
together.
It is a nation where old ways
yield slowly to new. Peasant
women still toil in the fields,
roasting pigs still turn on road
side spits, and coppersmiths
hammer out coffeepots in
Sarajevo's busy bazaar.
In the cities, private enter

prise, on a limited basis, provides
good restaurants, car-wash
shops, other small services. On a
much vaster scale, the state woos
international business partners.
An estimated 140 companies
from capitalist countries — in
cluding automobile makers,
chemical firms and banks — are
participating in joint ventures.
The traveler who joins Yugos
lav friends for a taste of
sljivovica, the national drink,
will invariably hear a toast as he
raises the fiery plum brandy to
his lips.
"Ziveli!" the host will say.
"Long live!" He means you — ;
and Yugoslavia.

In the 19605, Tito further as
serted his country's independent
outlook by helping found the
movement of nonaligned na

ken leader of those nations.
His chief legacy, however, is
Yugoslavia itself. He built it, and
preserved it.
A natural conduit
Much of Yugoslavia lies at the
heart of the Balkans. Th is moun
tainous region is a natural con
duit between Asia and Europe.
Down the centuries Illyrians,
Celts, Greeks. Romans, barbaric
tribes from the steppes to the
north, Turks, Europeans and
others have played the con
queror. or the conquered.
Yugoslavia means Land of the
South Slavs. In the sixth and
seventh centuries A.D., under
pressure from various Asian
peoples, Slav tribes moved to the
south and southwest. They set

tied in the Balkan Peninsula.
Slav states began forming in
the ninth century — a kingdom
in Croatia, then another in
Macedonia. The first Serbian
state was created in the 12th cen
tury. Others developed: Mon
tenegro, Slovenia, Bosnia and
Hercegovina.
By the end of the 15th century
all had been conquered except a
tiny city-state, Dubrovnik, on
the Adriatic coast. Slovenes and
Croats chafed under the rule of
Austria-Hungary. The Ottoman
l urks controlled the rest of the
land, although Montenegro
never was fully subdued.
Shaping forces
History and geography have
shaped today's Yugoslavs. Cen
turies of Hapsburg domination
taught the Slovenes and Croats

to be industrious and methodi
cal. Montenegrins, proud moun
tain warriors, cling to their mar
tial heritage. Birth of a son, a
future warrior, signals a great
celebration; a daughter's arrival
creates little fuss.
The central fact of Yugoslavia
is not its disparate peoples and
cultures, however. Old national
animosities still exist, but the
web of union has been strongly
fashioned by Tito. As his day
ends, the nation has drawn closer
together.
It is a nation where old ways
yield slowly to new. Peasant
women still toil in the fields,
roasting pigs still turn on road
side spits, and coppersmiths
hammer out coffeepots in
Sarajevo's busy bazaar.
In the cities, private enter

prise, on a limited basis, provides
good restaurants, car-wash
shops, other small services. On a
much vaster scale, the state woos
international business partners.
An estimated 140 companies
from capitalist countries — in
cluding automobile makers,
chemical firms and banks — are
participating in joint ventures.
The traveler who joins Yugos
lav friends for a taste of
sljivovica, the national drink,
will invariably hear a toast as he
raises the fiery plum brandy to
his lips.
"Ziveli!" the host will say.
"Long live!" He means you — ;
and Yugoslavia.

WASHINGTON — Some
times it takes a joke to help exp
lain the Yugoslavs to the rest of
the world — and perhaps to
themselves. In one of the coun
try's six diverse republics —
Bosnia and Hercegovina — an
American journalist heard the
one about.
A Serb (short-tempered,
high-spirited) sits on a tack. He
curses and throws it away. A Slo
ven (industrious, thrifty) sits on a
tack. He pockets it for future use.

A Bosnian (hardworking, duti
ful ) sits on a tack. He says,"The
party may have directed that this
tack be placed here. 1 will put it
back."
Six main nationalities
A surprisingly coherent
mosaic of peoples and cultures.
Yugoslavia's 22 million citizens
belong to six major nationalities
and about a dozen other groups.
They speak three official lan

guages, practice three main re
ligious faiths, and use two al
phabets.
Most remarkable of all is the
fact that one man single
handedly welded this conglom
eration into a successful and
tough federation. Now an old
and worrisome question has
come into sharp focus. What
comes after Tito?
For three and a half decades,
President Josip Broz Tito
steered Yugoslavia on its inde
pendent course. A maverick
communist nation, it has man-

aged to look west as well as east.
As a government official in Bel
grade. the capital, told a visitor.
"We stand with both sides — and
apart from both sides."
It has been a difficult balanc
ing act at times. As the post-Tito
era begins. Yugoslavia finds its
geopolitical situation more deli
cate than ever. Some observers
feel that the country is vulnera
ble to internal political manipu

lation. Without Tito as supreme
arbiter, old nationalistic rivalries
might erupt.
Tito long ago provided for his
own succession and for national
defense. A collective leadership
now directs both the state and
the party. Members rotate to the
top for one-year terms.
Under the policy of total na
tional defense, every able
bodied Yugoslav has a mobiliza
tion assignment. The population
is armed, trained and oriented to
wage protracted guerrilla war
fare.

Tito showed his countrymen
how to defend their rugged land
in World War 11, when he led his
Partisans to victory over Nazi
Germany. From scattered
groups hidden in mountain
strongholds, the army swelled to
800,000 soldiers at war's end.
One in every eight was a woman
in uniform.
He spelled out his strategy
bluntly then, and it remained un

changed, "Keep to the partisan
type of warfare, avoid rigid
fronts. Destruction of communi
cations and transport, ambushes,
surprise raids bring greater suc
cess. while we sustain fewer los
ses."
Tito was not his real name.
Perhaps he acquired it from his
direct manner. A story goes that
he would habitually command,
speaking Serbo-Croatian, "You
— Ti — will do this. And you will
do that — to." Ti*. . .to.
True story or not. the name
stuck. It fit. Born Josip Broz in
1892 to a peasant family in
Croatia, seventh of 15 children,
he became a dedicated re
volutionary and Communist long
before he attracted the world's
attention as Marshal Tito of Par
tisan fame.
In 1948 he broke with Stalin
and led Yugoslavia out of the
Soviet orbit. Yugoslavia not only
would control its own destiny, it
would practice its own form of
socialism — decentralized and
worker managed.
