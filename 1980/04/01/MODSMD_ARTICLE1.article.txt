Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, the
ousted monarch of Iran, will accept a
position as an honorary senior fellow at
the Hoover Institution following his re
covery from lymphatic cancer, the
Daily has learned.
Three sources separately confirmed
yesterday that arrangements are being
made through the State Department to
permit entry of the shah as early as
August, if his health and the political
climate permit.
The shah is currently in Cairo where
he underwent sensitive surgery to re
move his cancerous spleen. Egypt is the
sixth nation in which the shah has
sought asylum following the revolution
which drove him from Iran in January
1979.
He is reportedly recovering satisfac
torily from the operation which was
performed by Houston cardiovascular
surgeon Michael Deßakey.
While Hoover director W. Glenn
Campbell refused to comment on the
shah's appointment, African Collec
tion Curator Peter Duignan admitted
yesterday that Hoover officials had
been in contact with the shah and that
he was "quite interested" in an ap
pointment.
As an honorary fellow, the shah will

be doing research for his book on Islam
and the industrial revolution. The ex
ruler was unavailable for comment, but
a spokesman said the shah was looking
forward to continuing his work in a
peaceful environment free from dis
tractions.
The shah will join the ranks of such
notables as Ronald Reagan and Ale
xander Solzhenitsyn, also honorary fel
lows at Hoover. Like these men, the
ex-ruler will donate his personal papers
to the institute upon his death. The
shah's papers constitute a detailed,
behind-the-scenes history of Iran cov
ering the quarter century Pahlavi sat on
the throne.
"The shah's papers would be the
biggest boost to the Middle Eastern
collection we have ever had," Duignan
said. "Those papers likely contain
some of the most important material to
be unveiled to political scientists and
historians in the last 25 years."
Duignan said he had seen some of
the papers and termed them "abso
lutely unbelievable. They will certainly
keep us busy for a long time."
When contacted by the Daily,
former Secretary of State, Henry Kis
singer, said the Hoover Institution's
willingness to offer the shah a fellow
ship "shows the moral fortitude under
lying a great American research
center."

Hoover failed to succumb to the
pressures that have forced other in
stitutions, most notably the U.S. gov
ernment under the Carter administra
tion, to ignore this nation's former
friends and allies such as the shah, in an
effort to appease militant factions in
this country, Kissinger said yesterday.
Spokesmen from the ASSU Guest
Professorship Board confirmed last
night after an emergency meeting that
the board is preparing a guest profes
sorship offer to send to the shah next
week.
"We believe this to be an excellent
opportunity to bring a noted world fi
gure to the classrooms of Stanford
University," said one board member
who preferred not to be identified.
"Clearly, few people know more
about international crises and visa
problems than the shah," she said. "I
only wish I could be here next year to
take one of his (the shah's) classes in
Revolutionary Islamic Law and the Fir
ing Squad. Unfortunately, I'm a
senior," she said.
Several other board members
praised the shah's understanding of
current international political turmoil
and the historical roots behind today's
misunderstanding between the United
States and Iran.
Iranian students here had mixed
reactions to the news.
"I think it's a disgrace to the Univer
sity and the United States," said one
Iranian student wearing a brown paper
sack over his head. "The shah is a tor
turer and murderer who should face
Islamic justice in Iran before the rifles
of that nation's people," he said.
Another Iranian expressed satisfac
tion that the shah was finally forgoing
life in secluded fortresses in order to
become a part of society.
"There was no way we could get at
him in Panama," he said, "but on his
first trip to his post office box here, you
can be sure we'll be waiting for him."
Meanwhile in other developments,
the State Dept. refused all comment on
the matter. Hodding Carter, chief State
Department spokesman, said yester
day in a telephone interview that he
feels any discussions of the shah's pos
sible entry to this country "is counter
productive at this time.

"We are at a very sensitive stage in
the hostage crisis," Carter said. "Talk
of the shah entering the United States
at this time simply acts to disrupt sensi
tive negotiations and undermine State
Department attempts to accomplish
our primary goal at this time, freeing
the hostages."
Carter referred to the 50 Americans
who have been held by Moslem radi
cals in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran
si nee Nov. 4.
The takeover of the embassy fol
lowed the shah's arrival in New York
for treatment of the same lymphatic
cancer from which he is still suffering.
When asked if he would rule out the
possibility of the shah being permitted
entry into the United States to accept a
Hoover fellowship. Carter said. "I sim
ply cannot comment further. Those
people who have been sitting in that
embassy for 150 days are our concern. I
will not say anything more."
As a condition of the appointment,
the shah apparently will receive no sal
ary but will be given a home in the
faculty ghetto and free medical treat
ment at the Medical Center.
Cardiovascular Surgery Prof. Dr.
Norman Shumway said yesterday he
had been asked to head the shah's med
ical team and that he would accept if
the shah came here.
Shumway, a pioneer in heart trans
plant surgery, had a world-wide repu
tation as a top cardiovascular surgeon.
He confirmed that he has consulted
with Deßakey by telephone twice in
recent days and said he now has a
"pretty clear image of the shah's condi
tion."
Shumway said it was unclear
whether the shah wouldsurvive his cur
rent health crisis, but he said if the shah
came here, he would treat him.
"I am a doctor, not a politician,"
Shumway said. "I don't care if the man
is a morally upstanding individual or
not. My concern is his health.
"I don't think the shah was a saint,
but that is not my concern. If 1 can help
him, I shall," he added.
Officials here denied rumors that the
shah's appointment was contingent on
the ex-ruier donating part of his large
fortune to the University in order to
finance the construction of Pahiavi
Hall, the new 800-unit student resi
dence complex to be built just west of
Lagunita Court.

Hoover Tower, pictured above, will soon replace Cairo as the sanctuary
of the deposed monarch of Iran, Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, when
he arrives here in late summer to begin research as an honorary Hoover
Institution Fellow on Islam and the Industrial Revolution. Reactions to
the news of the shah's appointment were mixed. Experts predicted the
tower would be a formidable fortress from angry Iranians for the shah.
