# Campus Drive to be extended
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Construction on an extension of
Campus Drive that will allow cars to
travel from the Medical Center past the
site of a new student residence, directly
to Junipero Serra Boulevard, is ex
pected to begin in June, a University
Planning Office spokesman said yes
terday.
Campus Drive will be extended from
its present dead end at Panama Street
near the Medical Center to connect
with Junipero Serra "hopefully by
fall," said John Lerry, facilities en
gineer in the Planning Office.
"It doesn't really affect too many
things since it's way out there in the
boondocks, but it certainly will help
traffic into the Med Center," he said.
The extension will allow motorists to
travel from the Medical Center directly
to Junipero Serra. Drivers now reach
Junipero Serra from El Camino Real
by driving through Stanford Shopping
Center and traveling west on Willow
Road, which is heavily congested with
traffic at peak hours.
Lerry said "amongst the other
bonuses, it (the extension) cuts down
on pollution."
The extension, which completes the
Campus Drive loop around the campus

to give better access to the west side of
the University grounds, requires the in
stallment of traffic signals at the inter
section of Junipero Serra Blvd. and
Campus Drive.
Santa Clara County will share in the
cost of the signals, Williams said.
Total cost of the project is estimated
at $777,000.
"Roads are, unfortunately, built out
of asphalt, and asphalt is made from
oil," said Philip Williams, director of
planning. "Consequently, there's been
a considerable increase in the cost of
road construction."
The money comes from the pro rata
fund, which comes out of the general
plants improvement fund, Williams
said. He said the pro rata fund is gener
ated by the University practice of tax
ing new construction by 7 percent.
Williams said the new dormitory, to
be built between Lagunita Court and
the Campus Drive extension, triggered
the road construction, which should
begin in mid-June.
The dormitory, which will eventually
house 800 students, should be ready
for at least some of its residents by
1982, Williams said.
The extension will be a two-lane
road, serving the dormitory. Later a
median strip will be built, allowing the

road to be widened to four lanes.
Lerry said the extension was ap
proved by the Board of Trustees in
1966, but construction was deferred
until now. He said the deferment was
largely a result of an agreement by
University officials and the Palo Alto
Planning Commission to revamp Wil
low Road and Campus Drive at the
same time.
"Now we're saying we can't wait any
longer for Willow Road, although we'd
like to see Willow Road improved, of
course," Lerry said.
Naphtalie Knox, director of planning
for the city of Palo Alto, could not be
reached for comment yesterday. His
assistant, Kenneth Schrieber, was also
unavailable.
Williams said the Palo Alto Planning
Commission was generally pleased
with the extension project.
"They didn't seem very excited,
though," he said. "We'd been planning
to do it for so many years I think when
we actually did it, it was anti
climactic."
The extension project is one of sev
eral in a general improvements pac
kage to be considered by the Board of
Trustees this month. It is expected that
Santa Teresa Street will also be ex
tended to reach the Campus Drive ex
tension.
