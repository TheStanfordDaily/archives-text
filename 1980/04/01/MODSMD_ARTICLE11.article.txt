Travel excursions
For those with the itch to travel and the money
to afford it, the Stanford Alumni Association
offers 23 different travel/study programs in
three distinct categories to all alumni and
"friends" of the University. See page 5.
Looking for classes?
Don't bother looking for Art 150 or Biology 1,
because those courses have been canceled this

other course changes, see the Time Schedule
Changes on page 7.

Beckett premiere
A Piece of Monologue, Samuel Beckett's latest
work, receives its West Coast premiere Friday
at the Little Theater. For more on Beckett's
"elegy to the brevity of life and the proximity of
death," see page 9.
