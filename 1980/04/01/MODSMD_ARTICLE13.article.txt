# Candidates mount final effort to garner Wisconsin votes
## 
### William Endicott The Los Angeles Times 
MILWAUKEE — All the major
presidential candidates except the pres
ident himself — and he sent a surrogate
— made 11 th-hour efforts to woo Wis
consin voters yesterday, but only Gov.
Jerry Brown of California was flatly
predicting a victory in Tuesday's prim
ary.
The California governor, who has
yet to acquire a single delegate to the
Democratic National Convention, said
he would surprise the experts because
"there is a great desire for an alterna
tive within the Democratic Party" to
President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Brown's optimism notwithstanding,
it seemed more likely that Wisconsin
voters would hand victories to Carter
and Republican front-runner Ronald
Reagan, although this state's wide
open primary makes nothing abso
lutely certain.
And there was no way to gauge the
impact of the latest developments in
volving the 50 American hostages held
in Iran and a White House promise of a
"major development in the Iranian
situation today." Presumably, that
could be a boost to Carter's fortunes.
There is no statewide party registra
tion in Wisconsin — voters can cast
ballots for whomever they choose in
either party — and same-day registra
tion is possible at polling places as long
as potential voters can identify them
selves as Wisconsin residents or have a

witness to vouch for them.
Election officials estimate the turn
out will be about 40 percent of the
voting-age population, or about 1.35
million people.
Kansas stakes
Voters in Kansas also will cast ballots
today in that state's first-ever primary,
which is being held on a trial basis and
has been overshadowed by the contests
in Wisconsin. An act by the Kansas
Legislature will be needed if Kansans
are to have a primary in 1984.
Snow and blizzard conditions are ex
pected to hold the turnout down to only
about a fourth of Kansas' 1.14 million
registered voters. Carter and Reagan
are heavy favorites.
The balloting in Wisconsin is consi
dered crucial to the candidacies of both
Brown, who skipped all primaries since
New Hampshire to concentrate all his
efforts here, and Rep. John Anderson
(R-II1.). who has said he may scuttle his
candidacy if he falls under 25 percent
of the vote.
Carter downfall?
Who the voters choose on the
Democratic side, and by how much,
should be a good indication of whether
support for Carter is starting to crum
ble, as Kennedy's upset victories over
him in New York and Connecticut last
week seemed to indicate.
Anderson had counted heavily on
cross-over voting from Democrats and
independents to help him in Wisconsin,
but he may be hurt by the revitalization
of Kennedy's campaign. Anderson,
Brown and Kennedy are competing for

basically the same bloc of voters.
The president's staff stepped up ef
forts on his behalf in the state during
the past few days, and Vice President
Walter Mondale campaigned for him
here yesterday, touring a sausage fac
tory, making other appearances and
meeting with reporters before return
ing to Washington.
Kennedy spent his time here yester
day, the second day of a two-day blitz
after he had all but written off this
state, granting a series of television in
terviews to get as much last-minute
coverage as he could.
Close Republican race
At a brief stop in Milwaukee as he
was on the way to Louisiana to cam
paign for that state's primary, which is
scheduled Saturday, Reagan told re
porters that he considered Wisconsin
"a very close and a tight race" but said
he was "cautiously optimistic."
George Bush was in a relaxed frame
of mind as he hopscotched across the
state in a twin-engine prop jet named
"The Goose" and his state chairman,
John Mclver, described the primary as
"winnable."
Going into today's primaries. Carter
has 778 delegates on the Democratic
side, Kennedy 405. It takes 1666 to
win the Democratic nomination.
For the Republicans, who need 998
delegates for a nomination, Reagan has
350, Bush 68 and Anderson 45. At
stake in Wisconsin are 75 Democratic
delegates and 34 Republicans, and in
Kansas 37 Democrats and 32 Republi
cans.

Snow and blizzard conditions are ex
pected to hold the turnout down to only
about a fourth of Kansas' 1.14 million
registered voters. Carter and Reagan
are heavy favorites.
The balloting in Wisconsin is consi
dered crucial to the candidacies of both
Brown, who skipped all primaries since
New Hampshire to concentrate all his
efforts here, and Rep. John Anderson
(R-II1.). who has said he may scuttle his
candidacy if he falls under 25 percent
of the vote.
Carter downfall?
Who the voters choose on the
Democratic side, and by how much,
should be a good indication of whether
support for Carter is starting to crum
ble, as Kennedy's upset victories over
him in New York and Connecticut last
week seemed to indicate.
Anderson had counted heavily on
cross-over voting from Democrats and
independents to help him in Wisconsin,
but he may be hurt by the revitalization
of Kennedy's campaign. Anderson,
Brown and Kennedy are competing for

basically the same bloc of voters.
The president's staff stepped up ef
forts on his behalf in the state during
the past few days, and Vice President
Walter Mondale campaigned for him
here yesterday, touring a sausage fac
tory, making other appearances and
meeting with reporters before return
ing to Washington.
Kennedy spent his time here yester
day, the second day of a two-day blitz
after he had all but written off this
state, granting a series of television in
terviews to get as much last-minute
coverage as he could.
Close Republican race
At a brief stop in Milwaukee as he
was on the way to Louisiana to cam
paign for that state's primary, which is
scheduled Saturday, Reagan told re
porters that he considered Wisconsin
"a very close and a tight race" but said
he was "cautiously optimistic."
George Bush was in a relaxed frame
of mind as he hopscotched across the
state in a twin-engine prop jet named
"The Goose" and his state chairman,
John Mclver, described the primary as
"winnable."
Going into today's primaries. Carter
has 778 delegates on the Democratic
side, Kennedy 405. It takes 1666 to
win the Democratic nomination.
For the Republicans, who need 998
delegates for a nomination, Reagan has
350, Bush 68 and Anderson 45. At
stake in Wisconsin are 75 Democratic
delegates and 34 Republicans, and in
Kansas 37 Democrats and 32 Republi
cans.
MILWAUKEE — All the major
presidential candidates except the pres
ident himself — and he sent a surrogate
— made 11 th-hour efforts to woo Wis
consin voters yesterday, but only Gov.
Jerry Brown of California was flatly
predicting a victory in Tuesday's prim
ary.
The California governor, who has
yet to acquire a single delegate to the
Democratic National Convention, said
he would surprise the experts because
"there is a great desire for an alterna
tive within the Democratic Party" to
President Jimmy Carter and Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts.
Brown's optimism notwithstanding,
it seemed more likely that Wisconsin
voters would hand victories to Carter
and Republican front-runner Ronald
Reagan, although this state's wide
open primary makes nothing abso
lutely certain.
And there was no way to gauge the
impact of the latest developments in
volving the 50 American hostages held
in Iran and a White House promise of a
"major development in the Iranian
situation today." Presumably, that
could be a boost to Carter's fortunes.
There is no statewide party registra
tion in Wisconsin — voters can cast
ballots for whomever they choose in
either party — and same-day registra
tion is possible at polling places as long
as potential voters can identify them
selves as Wisconsin residents or have a

witness to vouch for them.
Election officials estimate the turn
out will be about 40 percent of the
voting-age population, or about 1.35
million people.
Kansas stakes
Voters in Kansas also will cast ballots
today in that state's first-ever primary,
which is being held on a trial basis and
has been overshadowed by the contests
in Wisconsin. An act by the Kansas
Legislature will be needed if Kansans
are to have a primary in 1984.
Snow and blizzard conditions are ex
pected to hold the turnout down to only
about a fourth of Kansas' 1.14 million
registered voters. Carter and Reagan
