## 
### Jane West Staff Writer 
The Office of Student Affairs will
announce tomorrow which contractors
have been selected to manage the Cof
fee House, the Transition and Encina
Commons, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said yesterday.
"This is the most delicate stage of the
negotiations," he said.
Firms, individuals and associations
submitted their bids to Lyons, newly
chosen Tresidder Director Ellie Op
pcnheim and a food policy board on
March 12.
The bidders' proposals had to meet a
combination of objective and subjcc

tive criteria, Lyons said, including fi
nancial return to the University, the
ability to understand and respond to
the University's community needs, re
cord of previous business success,
creativity and innovation, activity
growth and evolution of food service,
and the ability to hold a beer and wine
license.
Each group was invited to bid on all
three facilities or on any combination
of them.
Wednesday's decision will name the
organizations whose proposals best
met the University's criteria and will
disclose some of the future plans, said
Oppcnheim.
"We arc hoping to find some way of

making the new operation diverse,"
said Lyons.
One of the groups that has made a
bid solely for the Coffee House is the
ASSU. Student input to the Tresidder
Union food service operation in
creased when students realized that the
TDS Corporation contract to run the
union would expire April 30.
Lyons said he felt it would be good to
have "in-house competition."
Individual students have also bid for
the Coffee House.
Food services are the key to making
Tresidder a real community center,
added Mark Breier, ASSU Senate
chair.


The future of the Coffee House and other campus
eating establishments will be determined tomorrow
when the University announces which bidders will
