# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Wood heat would work 
### 
A few weeks ago, a group of
students proposed that Stanford
analyze the option of installing
an active solar heating system in
the new dorm complex on the
west side of campus. I would like
to endorse their proposal and ask

for your support for one of my
. wn: I propose that both the
Jniversity and the community
sriously consider using wood
loves.
According to the Energy Con
.â– rvation Center on campus, at
least 10 to 12 percent of your
payments for a room on campus
went to cover the cost of electric
ity and gas during the '78-'79
academic year, about $250. This
year's costs are up about 50 per
cent. and the total bill will run in
the neighborhood of $1.7 mill
ion. To top it off. Pacific Gas and
Electric (P.G. & E.) predicts that
electricity and gass costs per unit
of energy wil rise 243 percent
and 313 percent respectively,
through 1985. so the proportion
of your room payments going to
keep you warm will rise sharply
unless something is done.
Wood stoves are an attractive
alternative. It seems senseless
for us to bum fuels at distant or
complex power plants at
thousands of degrees Farenheit
when we only need heat at about
70 degrees. Rather, we should
produce heat simply, naturally
and on site whenever possible.
What are the wood stove
facts? According to a recent
study by Booz, Allen & Hamil
ton. 1.1 million wood stoves
were purchased in the U.S. last
year, and at least 5 percent of
U.S. households now use wood
for part or all of their space heat
ing requirements. By 1985.
wood could be the primary fuel
in 10-15 million homes. But this
potential will not be realized
without extensive efforts by the
private, public and academic sec
tors.
While every application re
quires a different type and model
of stove, two facts are clear: we
have the technology appropriate
for using wood for fuel, and
wood is relatively cheap and ac
cessible for the foreseeable fu
ture, if we manage our forest re
sources well. According to the
Country Catalog, a highly re
garded wood stove publication,
one acre of forested land can
produce one cord of wood (128
cubic feet) forever. The renewa
bility of wood is more than we
can say for coal, oil or natural
gas, whether domestic or
foreign.
Are wood stoves a retreat
from convenience? Not neces
sarily. Wood stoves are now av

ailable for which all you have to
do is keep sufficient wood in the
firebox, and empty the ash every
so often. There are virtually no
moving parts, and it's much less
complicated than the average
10-speed bike.

Pollution is not negligible with
wood stoves, but appears to be
preferable to that generated by
burning oil or coal. According to
the Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA), wood probably
emits more particulates and car
bon dioxide than these fuels, but
much less sulfur dioxides, nitro
gen oxides and hydrocarbons.
What about safety? In light of
the recent fire in Storey House,
this factor is doubly important to
consider. All responsible wood
stove manufacturers have ob
tained UL approval, which
specifies the distance their stove
must be placed from walls and
flammable materials. Many good
stoves also contain "flue rob
bers," which recycle the heat
into the combustion area that
would otherwise escape, thus
keeping the flue cooler and re
ducing the chance of fire from
creosote buildup. The University
should have no trouble finding
both safe and efficient models.
There have been accidents
with wood stoves, but the main
problems have not been with the
stove's construction. Rather, the
Booz. Allen study indicates that
77 percent of the accidents have
been caused by faulty installa
tion or misuse. Therefore, the
University must have them in
stalled properly and must expect
to engage in user education
should it purchase wood stoves.
We should not. however, let un
familiarity stifle consideration of
such a viable fuel and cost-saving
option.
Those of us living off-campus
should be aware that there are
currently more firms manufac
turing wood stoves than you can
shake a stick at. so shopping
around is essential. A lot de
pends on your criteria for ap
pearance. your heating needs,
and your price range. Also, re
member you can enjoy the view
of the fire that many stoves pro
vide while your dinner and body
are being warmed.
Stoves cost between $100 and
$2000, and wood costs $80 to
$180 per cord nowadays, de
pending on the season and type
of wood you buy. A home in this
area would use about three cords
per year to provide a substantial
portion of your heating needs.
Make sure to calculate your sav
ings over time, not just the initial
costs.
With part of the budget in

crease the Energy Conservation
Center recently received. 1
propose that they assemble a
group of students, faculty and
technical experts to investigate
the merits of using wood stoves
in University buildings. Initially,
I suspect that the best applica
tions will be in dining rooms,
lounges and other common areas
where they can be carefully mon
itored. evaluated and serviced.
Bv making large purchases of
stoves and wood, I'll bet that
wood stoves make economic
sense for Stanford today.
