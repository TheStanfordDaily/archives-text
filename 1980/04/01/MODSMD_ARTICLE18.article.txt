## Put Moscow boycott in historical perspective 
### 
The Beginning:
1880s — Baron Pierre de Cubertin, the father of the
modern Olympic Games, was a Parisian. He visualized
that the Greek state, possibly the purest form of gov
ernment yet conceived by man, owed, to a great extent,
its existence to athletics, physical education, the discip
line of the bodv and finally to the spirit of the ancient
Olympic Games.
The true purpose of the Olympic Games, in ancient
days, had been to cement and unite a feeling of friendli
ness and of sportsmanship among the several warring
states of Greece. For more than a thousand years, the
cause of peace and of good will was very definitely
promoted by these games.
Upon these thoughts, the young baron conceived the
idea of rev iving in modern times not only the sports, but
also the purpose behind the sports into a new kind of
Olympiad.
1908 - IV Olympiad - London, England
These were the first where the athletes carried the
flags of their respective countries in the "Opening
Ceremonies." Little Finland had permission from Rus
sia to have its points scored separately, but permission
was withheld for carrying the Finnish banner, so the
Finns paraded without a flag.
The Irish desired to compete as a separate unit, but the
British Olympic Association ruled that the British Isles
would have to compete for the United Kingdom. As a
result, several of the leading Irish athletes declined to
take part.
The "Opening Ceremonies" started a rumpus. The
British were perturbed because the United States did not
"dip the flag" to King Edward. They were the only
nation that failed to do so. United States regulations
decreed that the flag should never be dipped.
1916 - VI Olympiad - Berlin, Germany
Kaiser Wilhelm II was one of the earliest recipients of
the Olympic Commemorative Medal.
The course of world events decreed that the "Peaceful
Games" should not be held, but instead were replaced
by deadly conflict on the battlefield.
This was in complete opposition to the Games in
ancient Greece when all hostilities ceased when the time
for celebrating the Olympic Games arrived.
1920 - VII Olympiad - Antwerp, Belgium
These were the first games at which women members
of the American team competed.
The second innovation was the appearance of the
now-familiar "Olympic Flag" with its five entwined
multi-colored circles on a white background, symbolic of
the five parts of the world united in Olympic meetings.
Another innovation, as the result of the 1912 Jim
Thorpe incident in Stockholm, was that the athletes took
an oath of amateurism: "We swear that we will take part
in the Olympic Games in legal competition and respect
ing the regulations which govern them, and desire of
participating in them in the true spirit of sportsmanship

for honor of our country and for the glory of sport."
1924 -VIII Olympiad - Paris, France
These games were brilliant and highly successful. On
the w hole, there was a good feeling that prevailed among
the national representatives, although there were a few
unfortunate occurrences: One of the futball games
ended in a free-for-all fist fight; when an Italian boxer
was disqualified for a flagrant foul, the Italians threw
missiles at the referee; one of the Italian fencers chal
lenged a/i official to a duel because he didn't like some
decisions.
1928 - IX Olympiad -Amsterdam, Holland
These games aroused more world-wide enthusiasm
than any other, chiefly attributed to the failure of the
Americans to win their usual quota of the running
events.
In the United States, internal dissension against the
Amateur Athletic Union cropped up. The method of
team selection caused considerable bad feelings. Even
after the team sailed, the New York Athletic Club kept a
stream of radiograms requesting reconsideration of the
cases of several of its members, and many other grie
vances were aired by the press. General Douglas
Mac Arthur, committee president, finally sent his fam
ous message that "sniping from the rear" cease.
1936 - XI Olympiad - Berlin, Germany
The 1932 Olympic Games at Los Angeles, California,
had been magnificent, but those at Berlin were stupend
ous. The Nazis, convinced of their destiny as a race apart,
were eager to show the less fortunate peoples what had
been accomplished.
Adolph Hitler's vicious anti-Semitic campaign caused
the Jews of America and many other fair-minded citi
zens to oppose American participation. A decision was
made to boycott the Games. However, Avery Brundage
urged that America accept Germany's invitation. After a
fierce battle by committee members of the Athletic
Council, a motion to send a team was carried by a slim
majority. The reasoning: Politics, and after all that was
what it was, has no place in sports.
1940 -XII Olympiad -Tokyo, Japan
Not celebrated when Japan declared war on China.
The Games were rescheduled for Helsinki, Finland, but
were finally abandoned when Russia invaded Finland.
1944 -XIII Olympiad not awarded - due to World War
II
1956 -XVI Olympiad - Melbourne, Australia
The Games were boycotted by Holland, Spain and
Switzerland because of the Soviet Union's invasion of
Hungary. Fifty six Hungarians chose the Games as a
defection "take-off."
1972 -XX Olympiad - Munich, West Germany
The Games were tragically interrupted by the mas
sacre of 1 1 Israeli athletes by Palestine terrorists.
1976 - XXI Olympiad - Montreal, Canada
The Games were boycotted by a group of African

nations because Now Zealand, a participant, had sport
ing connections with the racist government of South
Africa.
The People's Republic of China refused to participate
unless the Republic of China (Taiwan) changed its
national flag, national anthem, and the name of its
country. Prime Minister Trudeau concurred, as it would
have affected Canadian wheat sales to Mainland China.
1980 - Winter Olympiad - Lake Placid, New York
The International Olympic Committee decreed that
the 27-member contingent from the Republic of China
(Taiwan) be refused admission to the Olympic Village
unless they complied with the dictate of changing their
national Hag, national anthem and the name of their
country that they had adopted after the Japanese were
evicted following World War 11.
The Conclusion: Rolf Paula, the West German rep
resentative to NATO, was quoted recently as saying,
"The course of history might have been different had the
world boycotted Hitler's Olympics."
Kurt Thomas, United States gymnastic star, "didn't
agree with the boycott, but I do now. At the Olympics
you're competing for your country, and the way your
country feels is the way you should feel."
Dave Maggard, former Olympian on the United
States track team in 1968. NCAA representative on the
United States Olympic Committee, and athletic director
of the University of California: "The International
Olympic Committee has hid behind the idea that the
Soviet Union has not violated its contract. If the Olympic
Games die, it will be because of the 1.0.C."
Art Rosenhlum, sports editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Boycotting the Soviet Games is a good idea.
The Olympic System is supposed to insulate itself from
outside political influence. The opposite is true. Athletes
cannot enter a country without a visa or passport, so it is
simple to force sanctions on the unwanted."
Charles McCabe, San Francisco Chronicle columnist:
"The Olympic Games is an idea whose time is gone. Not
only are they 'mixed up' with politics, they are pure
politics."
Glenn Dickey, San Francisco Chronicle sports colum
nist: "In the wake of the hysteria surrounding the United
States hockey team's win in the Winter Olympics, there
is no doubt there will be many who hope the president
will reverse his position on the boycott of the Moscow
Olympics. That's the worst thing that could happen. The
boycott is as important and meaningful as ever. The
Soviet Union has invaded another country and is hosting
a competition which is seen as a symbol of peace. If we go
there, we are in effect endorsing the Soviets' action."

coach, was inducted into the U.S. Water Polo Hall of

that the Greek state, possibly the purest form of gov
ernment yet conceived by man, owed, to a great extent,
its existence to athletics, physical education, the discip
line of the bodv and finally to the spirit of the ancient
Olympic Games.
The true purpose of the Olympic Games, in ancient
days, had been to cement and unite a feeling of friendli
ness and of sportsmanship among the several warring
states of Greece. For more than a thousand years, the
cause of peace and of good will was very definitely
promoted by these games.
Upon these thoughts, the young baron conceived the
idea of rev iving in modern times not only the sports, but
also the purpose behind the sports into a new kind of
Olympiad.
1908 - IV Olympiad - London, England
These were the first where the athletes carried the
flags of their respective countries in the "Opening
Ceremonies." Little Finland had permission from Rus
sia to have its points scored separately, but permission
was withheld for carrying the Finnish banner, so the
Finns paraded without a flag.
The Irish desired to compete as a separate unit, but the
British Olympic Association ruled that the British Isles
would have to compete for the United Kingdom. As a
result, several of the leading Irish athletes declined to
take part.
The "Opening Ceremonies" started a rumpus. The
British were perturbed because the United States did not
"dip the flag" to King Edward. They were the only
nation that failed to do so. United States regulations
decreed that the flag should never be dipped.
1916 - VI Olympiad - Berlin, Germany
Kaiser Wilhelm II was one of the earliest recipients of
the Olympic Commemorative Medal.
The course of world events decreed that the "Peaceful
Games" should not be held, but instead were replaced
by deadly conflict on the battlefield.
This was in complete opposition to the Games in
ancient Greece when all hostilities ceased when the time
for celebrating the Olympic Games arrived.
1920 - VII Olympiad - Antwerp, Belgium
These were the first games at which women members
of the American team competed.
The second innovation was the appearance of the
now-familiar "Olympic Flag" with its five entwined
multi-colored circles on a white background, symbolic of
the five parts of the world united in Olympic meetings.
Another innovation, as the result of the 1912 Jim
Thorpe incident in Stockholm, was that the athletes took
an oath of amateurism: "We swear that we will take part
in the Olympic Games in legal competition and respect
ing the regulations which govern them, and desire of
participating in them in the true spirit of sportsmanship

for honor of our country and for the glory of sport."
1924 -VIII Olympiad - Paris, France
These games were brilliant and highly successful. On
the w hole, there was a good feeling that prevailed among
the national representatives, although there were a few
unfortunate occurrences: One of the futball games
ended in a free-for-all fist fight; when an Italian boxer
was disqualified for a flagrant foul, the Italians threw
missiles at the referee; one of the Italian fencers chal
lenged a/i official to a duel because he didn't like some
decisions.
1928 - IX Olympiad -Amsterdam, Holland
These games aroused more world-wide enthusiasm
than any other, chiefly attributed to the failure of the
Americans to win their usual quota of the running
events.
In the United States, internal dissension against the
Amateur Athletic Union cropped up. The method of
team selection caused considerable bad feelings. Even
after the team sailed, the New York Athletic Club kept a
stream of radiograms requesting reconsideration of the
cases of several of its members, and many other grie
vances were aired by the press. General Douglas
Mac Arthur, committee president, finally sent his fam
ous message that "sniping from the rear" cease.
1936 - XI Olympiad - Berlin, Germany
The 1932 Olympic Games at Los Angeles, California,
had been magnificent, but those at Berlin were stupend
ous. The Nazis, convinced of their destiny as a race apart,
were eager to show the less fortunate peoples what had
been accomplished.
Adolph Hitler's vicious anti-Semitic campaign caused
the Jews of America and many other fair-minded citi
zens to oppose American participation. A decision was
made to boycott the Games. However, Avery Brundage
urged that America accept Germany's invitation. After a
fierce battle by committee members of the Athletic
Council, a motion to send a team was carried by a slim
majority. The reasoning: Politics, and after all that was
what it was, has no place in sports.
1940 -XII Olympiad -Tokyo, Japan
Not celebrated when Japan declared war on China.
The Games were rescheduled for Helsinki, Finland, but
were finally abandoned when Russia invaded Finland.
1944 -XIII Olympiad not awarded - due to World War
II
1956 -XVI Olympiad - Melbourne, Australia
The Games were boycotted by Holland, Spain and
Switzerland because of the Soviet Union's invasion of
Hungary. Fifty six Hungarians chose the Games as a
defection "take-off."
1972 -XX Olympiad - Munich, West Germany
The Games were tragically interrupted by the mas
sacre of 1 1 Israeli athletes by Palestine terrorists.
1976 - XXI Olympiad - Montreal, Canada
The Games were boycotted by a group of African

nations because Now Zealand, a participant, had sport
ing connections with the racist government of South
Africa.
The People's Republic of China refused to participate
unless the Republic of China (Taiwan) changed its
national flag, national anthem, and the name of its
country. Prime Minister Trudeau concurred, as it would
have affected Canadian wheat sales to Mainland China.
1980 - Winter Olympiad - Lake Placid, New York
The International Olympic Committee decreed that
the 27-member contingent from the Republic of China
(Taiwan) be refused admission to the Olympic Village
unless they complied with the dictate of changing their
national Hag, national anthem and the name of their
country that they had adopted after the Japanese were
evicted following World War 11.
The Conclusion: Rolf Paula, the West German rep
resentative to NATO, was quoted recently as saying,
"The course of history might have been different had the
world boycotted Hitler's Olympics."
Kurt Thomas, United States gymnastic star, "didn't
agree with the boycott, but I do now. At the Olympics
you're competing for your country, and the way your
country feels is the way you should feel."
Dave Maggard, former Olympian on the United
States track team in 1968. NCAA representative on the
United States Olympic Committee, and athletic director
of the University of California: "The International
Olympic Committee has hid behind the idea that the
Soviet Union has not violated its contract. If the Olympic
Games die, it will be because of the 1.0.C."
Art Rosenhlum, sports editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Boycotting the Soviet Games is a good idea.
The Olympic System is supposed to insulate itself from
outside political influence. The opposite is true. Athletes
cannot enter a country without a visa or passport, so it is
simple to force sanctions on the unwanted."
Charles McCabe, San Francisco Chronicle columnist:
"The Olympic Games is an idea whose time is gone. Not
only are they 'mixed up' with politics, they are pure
politics."
Glenn Dickey, San Francisco Chronicle sports colum
nist: "In the wake of the hysteria surrounding the United
States hockey team's win in the Winter Olympics, there
is no doubt there will be many who hope the president
will reverse his position on the boycott of the Moscow
Olympics. That's the worst thing that could happen. The
boycott is as important and meaningful as ever. The
Soviet Union has invaded another country and is hosting
a competition which is seen as a symbol of peace. If we go
there, we are in effect endorsing the Soviets' action."

its existence to athletics, physical education, the discip
line of the bodv and finally to the spirit of the ancient
Olympic Games.
The true purpose of the Olympic Games, in ancient
days, had been to cement and unite a feeling of friendli
ness and of sportsmanship among the several warring
states of Greece. For more than a thousand years, the
cause of peace and of good will was very definitely
promoted by these games.
Upon these thoughts, the young baron conceived the
idea of rev iving in modern times not only the sports, but
also the purpose behind the sports into a new kind of
Olympiad.
1908 - IV Olympiad - London, England
These were the first where the athletes carried the
flags of their respective countries in the "Opening
Ceremonies." Little Finland had permission from Rus
sia to have its points scored separately, but permission
was withheld for carrying the Finnish banner, so the
Finns paraded without a flag.
The Irish desired to compete as a separate unit, but the
British Olympic Association ruled that the British Isles
would have to compete for the United Kingdom. As a
result, several of the leading Irish athletes declined to
take part.
The "Opening Ceremonies" started a rumpus. The
British were perturbed because the United States did not
"dip the flag" to King Edward. They were the only
nation that failed to do so. United States regulations
decreed that the flag should never be dipped.
1916 - VI Olympiad - Berlin, Germany
Kaiser Wilhelm II was one of the earliest recipients of
the Olympic Commemorative Medal.
The course of world events decreed that the "Peaceful
Games" should not be held, but instead were replaced
by deadly conflict on the battlefield.
This was in complete opposition to the Games in
ancient Greece when all hostilities ceased when the time
for celebrating the Olympic Games arrived.
1920 - VII Olympiad - Antwerp, Belgium
These were the first games at which women members
of the American team competed.
The second innovation was the appearance of the
now-familiar "Olympic Flag" with its five entwined
multi-colored circles on a white background, symbolic of
the five parts of the world united in Olympic meetings.
Another innovation, as the result of the 1912 Jim
Thorpe incident in Stockholm, was that the athletes took
an oath of amateurism: "We swear that we will take part
in the Olympic Games in legal competition and respect
ing the regulations which govern them, and desire of
participating in them in the true spirit of sportsmanship

for honor of our country and for the glory of sport."
1924 -VIII Olympiad - Paris, France
These games were brilliant and highly successful. On
the w hole, there was a good feeling that prevailed among
the national representatives, although there were a few
unfortunate occurrences: One of the futball games
ended in a free-for-all fist fight; when an Italian boxer
was disqualified for a flagrant foul, the Italians threw
missiles at the referee; one of the Italian fencers chal
lenged a/i official to a duel because he didn't like some
decisions.
1928 - IX Olympiad -Amsterdam, Holland
These games aroused more world-wide enthusiasm
than any other, chiefly attributed to the failure of the
Americans to win their usual quota of the running
events.
In the United States, internal dissension against the
Amateur Athletic Union cropped up. The method of
team selection caused considerable bad feelings. Even
after the team sailed, the New York Athletic Club kept a
stream of radiograms requesting reconsideration of the
cases of several of its members, and many other grie
vances were aired by the press. General Douglas
Mac Arthur, committee president, finally sent his fam
ous message that "sniping from the rear" cease.
1936 - XI Olympiad - Berlin, Germany
The 1932 Olympic Games at Los Angeles, California,
had been magnificent, but those at Berlin were stupend
ous. The Nazis, convinced of their destiny as a race apart,
were eager to show the less fortunate peoples what had
been accomplished.
Adolph Hitler's vicious anti-Semitic campaign caused
the Jews of America and many other fair-minded citi
zens to oppose American participation. A decision was
made to boycott the Games. However, Avery Brundage
urged that America accept Germany's invitation. After a
fierce battle by committee members of the Athletic
Council, a motion to send a team was carried by a slim
majority. The reasoning: Politics, and after all that was
what it was, has no place in sports.
1940 -XII Olympiad -Tokyo, Japan
Not celebrated when Japan declared war on China.
The Games were rescheduled for Helsinki, Finland, but
were finally abandoned when Russia invaded Finland.
1944 -XIII Olympiad not awarded - due to World War
II
1956 -XVI Olympiad - Melbourne, Australia
The Games were boycotted by Holland, Spain and
Switzerland because of the Soviet Union's invasion of
Hungary. Fifty six Hungarians chose the Games as a
defection "take-off."
1972 -XX Olympiad - Munich, West Germany
The Games were tragically interrupted by the mas
sacre of 1 1 Israeli athletes by Palestine terrorists.
1976 - XXI Olympiad - Montreal, Canada
The Games were boycotted by a group of African

nations because Now Zealand, a participant, had sport
ing connections with the racist government of South
Africa.
The People's Republic of China refused to participate
unless the Republic of China (Taiwan) changed its
national flag, national anthem, and the name of its
country. Prime Minister Trudeau concurred, as it would
have affected Canadian wheat sales to Mainland China.
1980 - Winter Olympiad - Lake Placid, New York
The International Olympic Committee decreed that
the 27-member contingent from the Republic of China
(Taiwan) be refused admission to the Olympic Village
unless they complied with the dictate of changing their
national Hag, national anthem and the name of their
country that they had adopted after the Japanese were
evicted following World War 11.
The Conclusion: Rolf Paula, the West German rep
resentative to NATO, was quoted recently as saying,
"The course of history might have been different had the
world boycotted Hitler's Olympics."
Kurt Thomas, United States gymnastic star, "didn't
agree with the boycott, but I do now. At the Olympics
you're competing for your country, and the way your
country feels is the way you should feel."
Dave Maggard, former Olympian on the United
States track team in 1968. NCAA representative on the
United States Olympic Committee, and athletic director
of the University of California: "The International
Olympic Committee has hid behind the idea that the
Soviet Union has not violated its contract. If the Olympic
Games die, it will be because of the 1.0.C."
Art Rosenhlum, sports editor of the San Francisco
Chronicle: "Boycotting the Soviet Games is a good idea.
The Olympic System is supposed to insulate itself from
outside political influence. The opposite is true. Athletes
cannot enter a country without a visa or passport, so it is
simple to force sanctions on the unwanted."
Charles McCabe, San Francisco Chronicle columnist:
"The Olympic Games is an idea whose time is gone. Not
only are they 'mixed up' with politics, they are pure
politics."
Glenn Dickey, San Francisco Chronicle sports colum
nist: "In the wake of the hysteria surrounding the United
States hockey team's win in the Winter Olympics, there
is no doubt there will be many who hope the president
will reverse his position on the boycott of the Moscow
Olympics. That's the worst thing that could happen. The
boycott is as important and meaningful as ever. The
Soviet Union has invaded another country and is hosting
a competition which is seen as a symbol of peace. If we go
there, we are in effect endorsing the Soviets' action."
(James "Jimmy" Smith, former Stanford water polo
coach, was inducted into the U.S. Water Polo Hall of
Fame last year.)
