Review vulgar
The art of reviewing attracts
many people who attempt to try
their luck with a pen. Unfortu
nately what attracts them to this
art in particular is the wrong no
tion that it is enough to see some
faults with someone or some
thing to be a reviewer. Fre
quently, however, the only thing
we learn is the shallowness of the
reviewer's views. Such is exactly
the case with Tom Simpson's re
view of Randy Newman's per
formance (Daily, March 12).
Tom Simpson sets out to de
termine why the "guy who wears
J.C. Penney shoes . . . draws
hundreds of devotees." The task,
1 presume, was too large for
Tom, for he never brings his de
termination to a conclusion. The
observations he does make,
however, are outrageous and in
sulting to the earnest listener
who has grown to appreciate
Randy Newman for his non
programatic, quiet in tone but
strong in content, messages that
look analytically at the society
we call our own.
Would any review ever be
printed in which Woody Allen's
messages were called weird and
unimportant, or at least not im
portant enough to warrant our
spending "days dreaming about
naked women flailing about on
chairs and thinking up ways to
get hack at those rotten short
people" ?Randy Newman is pre
cisely the Woody Allen of song.
His perceptions arc deep, though
in order to understand them one
must be able to work through the
layer of the grotesque. Like

Woody, Newman is a master of
ambiguity, irony and self
conscious satire.
I keep rereading the insults
thrown at Newman, and shiver
from their vulgarity. He is called
"ugly," a singer with no singing
ability. And to top it off, all his
songs"don't meandiddly" to the
reviewer. Does Simpson ever
know what genre of song he is
listening to with Newman?
Without a doubt, he would also
dismiss Charles Aenavour and
Jacques Brel.
Newman has a powerful,
somewhat coarse, but deep voice
which fits perfectly the melodies
and the meaning of his songs.
On this last point our reviewer
demonstrates his inability to be
anything other than superficial:
Newman carries on the practi
cally abandoned tradition of the
meaningful popular song. His
compositions rise above the
"love-me/love-me-not"
stereotype. He does not with
draw from daily reality. Instead,
he reacts to the surrounding
world, ponders it, causes us to
have second thoughts about
people and events around us,
and does it all in a way that de
serves to be recognized as art.
When will the common
American of Simpson's ilk come
to understand that Randy New
man is one of our contributors to
the chanson.

Khouri wrong
In response to Eli Khouri's
column on the IFC Penthouse

party decision (Daily, March 3),
I would like first to question his
claim of being an "objective ob
server." Objectivity is especially
questionable in light of state
ments such as "the nebulous
idealism of some removed spe
cial interest group."
Second, I wish to point out
that one cannot separate the
ends ("significant contribution
to charity") from the means in
obtaining it. The "personal ex
pense" is incurred by women in
the perpetuation of violence
against women, which is neces
sarily a highly emotional issue.
Khouri refutes this opposition
by citing "recent European evi
dence" which cannot be consi
dered conclusive due to the inhe
rent problems of such studies,
demographic differences bet
ween countries, and the failure
to correlate the lifting of pornog
raphic bans to forms of violence
against women other than rape.
Furthermore, the "dissidents"
do not assert that rape is a "de
sire for sexual gratification" but
that it is violence which can be
perpetuated by images in the
media (such as those
documented in the "Women
Against Violence in Pornog
raphy and the Media" slide
show).
Finally, Khouri misun
derstands the potential consequ
ences of national media coverage
(of which Penthouse would have
gladly taken advantage). It
would have been unpleasant to
see Penthouse profit from the
sincere sentiments of these op
posing people.

In addition, I counter Khouri
with the belief that all stands in
support of humanizing women's
image in the media are signific
ant.

No common thread
Let me suggest a simple men
tal experiment that may be help
ful in assessing the candidacy of
John Anderson.
Take some issue on which
you do not know Anderson's
position and try to figure out,
from what you know of his other
positions, what his stand would
be on this one.

I think you will find this exper
iment very difficult, for there
seems to be no thread of princi
ple running through his posi
tions. He is sometimes a liberal
and sometimes a conservative,
sometimes a statist and some
times a limited government per
son. About all you can say with
certainity is that he is not a
Libertarian.
What are Anderson's princi
ples? I fear we do not know. His
individual positions are very
popular, particularly with the
media. I find it distressing that
this should be theironly common
thread.

Let me suggest a simple men
tal experiment that may be help
ful in assessing the candidacy of
John Anderson.
Take some issue on which
you do not know Anderson's
position and try to figure out,
from what you know of his other
positions, what his stand would
be on this one.

I think you will find this exper
iment very difficult, for there
seems to be no thread of princi
ple running through his posi
tions. He is sometimes a liberal
and sometimes a conservative,
sometimes a statist and some
times a limited government per
son. About all you can say with
certainity is that he is not a
Libertarian.
What are Anderson's princi
ples? I fear we do not know. His
individual positions are very
popular, particularly with the
media. I find it distressing that
this should be theironly common
thread.

The art of reviewing attracts
many people who attempt to try
their luck with a pen. Unfortu
nately what attracts them to this
art in particular is the wrong no
tion that it is enough to see some
faults with someone or some
thing to be a reviewer. Fre
quently, however, the only thing
we learn is the shallowness of the
reviewer's views. Such is exactly
the case with Tom Simpson's re
view of Randy Newman's per
formance (Daily, March 12).
Tom Simpson sets out to de
termine why the "guy who wears
J.C. Penney shoes . . . draws
hundreds of devotees." The task,
1 presume, was too large for
Tom, for he never brings his de
termination to a conclusion. The
observations he does make,
however, are outrageous and in
sulting to the earnest listener
who has grown to appreciate
Randy Newman for his non
programatic, quiet in tone but
strong in content, messages that
look analytically at the society
we call our own.
Would any review ever be
printed in which Woody Allen's
messages were called weird and
unimportant, or at least not im
portant enough to warrant our
spending "days dreaming about
naked women flailing about on
chairs and thinking up ways to
get hack at those rotten short
people" ?Randy Newman is pre
cisely the Woody Allen of song.
His perceptions arc deep, though
in order to understand them one
must be able to work through the
layer of the grotesque. Like

Woody, Newman is a master of
ambiguity, irony and self
conscious satire.
I keep rereading the insults
thrown at Newman, and shiver
from their vulgarity. He is called
"ugly," a singer with no singing
ability. And to top it off, all his
songs"don't meandiddly" to the
reviewer. Does Simpson ever
know what genre of song he is
listening to with Newman?
Without a doubt, he would also
dismiss Charles Aenavour and
Jacques Brel.
Newman has a powerful,
somewhat coarse, but deep voice
which fits perfectly the melodies
and the meaning of his songs.
On this last point our reviewer
demonstrates his inability to be
anything other than superficial:
Newman carries on the practi
cally abandoned tradition of the
meaningful popular song. His
compositions rise above the
"love-me/love-me-not"
stereotype. He does not with
draw from daily reality. Instead,
he reacts to the surrounding
world, ponders it, causes us to
have second thoughts about
people and events around us,
and does it all in a way that de
serves to be recognized as art.
When will the common
American of Simpson's ilk come
to understand that Randy New
man is one of our contributors to
the chanson.

Khouri wrong
In response to Eli Khouri's
column on the IFC Penthouse

party decision (Daily, March 3),
I would like first to question his
claim of being an "objective ob
server." Objectivity is especially
questionable in light of state
ments such as "the nebulous
idealism of some removed spe
cial interest group."
Second, I wish to point out
that one cannot separate the
ends ("significant contribution
to charity") from the means in
obtaining it. The "personal ex
pense" is incurred by women in
the perpetuation of violence
against women, which is neces
sarily a highly emotional issue.
Khouri refutes this opposition
by citing "recent European evi
dence" which cannot be consi
dered conclusive due to the inhe
rent problems of such studies,
demographic differences bet
ween countries, and the failure
to correlate the lifting of pornog
raphic bans to forms of violence
against women other than rape.
Furthermore, the "dissidents"
do not assert that rape is a "de
sire for sexual gratification" but
that it is violence which can be
perpetuated by images in the
media (such as those
documented in the "Women
Against Violence in Pornog
raphy and the Media" slide
show).
Finally, Khouri misun
derstands the potential consequ
ences of national media coverage
(of which Penthouse would have
gladly taken advantage). It
would have been unpleasant to
see Penthouse profit from the
sincere sentiments of these op
posing people.

In addition, I counter Khouri
with the belief that all stands in
support of humanizing women's
image in the media are signific
