# FBI, University eavesdrop on Row
## 
### Seth Zuckerman News Editor 
The FBI, in cooperation with the
University, has been electronically
eavesdropping on student conversa
tions for several months, the Daily has
learned.
The bugging devices were installed
under the guise of smoke-detecting
equipment at Columbae, Sigma Chi,
La Maison Francaise and Synergy.
Students whose suspicions were
aroused during idle speculation on the
nature of the 'smoke detectors' opened
the devices during last week's spring
break and found microphones con
cealed in each one.
"It's real convenient for them," said
electrical engineering major Jane
Kent, who confirmed for the Daily that
the houses had been bugged.
"They used the detectors as a pretext
to run electrical conduits from room to
room. And they keep the control
cabinet locked, supposedly to keep re
sidents from turning the alarms off by
themselves."

The smoke detectors were located
mostly in the houses' common areas.
Private rooms were largely unaffected.
FBI Information Officer Emma
Flack of the bureau's San Francisco of
fice refused to comment, but one of the
agents involved said the bureau had
obtained no warrant before installing
the bugs.
"When you're looking for evidence
of political conspiracy," said the agent,
"it is not standard operating procedure
to go through the courts. It is usually
too touchy for most two-bit judges."
She declined to state exactly what kind
of "political conspiracy" the bureau
had expected to find or whether any
charges or further investigations would
stem from the buggings. Residents
speculated the FBI was pursuing leads
in the anti-draft registration move
ment.
It was believed yesterday that the
bugs would be deactivated in response

to the publicity that will now surround
them. It was not immediately known
whether any of the phones at the
houses had been tapped.
President Richard Lyman claimed
his office had not been involved in the
planning of the buggings, but admitted
that reports had reached his desk based
on some of the recorded conversations.
"The reports were useful in some of
the Honor Code cases that have crop
ped up recently,"said Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. "We were able to
get definitive evidence against the stu
dents who had been cheating."
Asked if he thought the bugging it
self represented an Honor Code viola
tion, Lyons replied, "Clearly not.
People have to be willing to take re
sponsibility for what they say. That's a
problem with some people these days."
'Not illegal'
University Counsel John Schwartz
said the buggings do not constitute an
infringement of the residents' constitu
tional rights nor their rights to privacy
under the Residence Agreement.
He said the Constitution is intended
only to protect citizens from gov
ernmental abuses, and that the Univer
sity, as a private organization, was
within the law.
As to the Residence Agreement, he
said the contract only proscribes bodily
intrusion. "This is not the same kind of
invasion of personal space," he said.
Residents of the affected houses dis
agreed.
'Outraged'
"I'm personally outraged," said
Laura Memhard, RA (house associate)
at Columbae House. "The basic trust
that has existed between administra
tion and residents is fast eroding."
Residents of the Sigma Chi fraternity
were of similar opinion. Said ASSU
Senator Vance Mason, "This time, the
University has gone too far. We won't
swallow a Big Brother looking over our
shoulder as easily as we swallowed a
Western Culture requirement or the
reinstitution of the 'D.' "

One resident of Columbae added,
"This just goes to show you, the
paranoid Left was right all along.
There's no doubt in my mind that the
FBI was gathering intelligence about
the anti-nuclear movement and the
swelling tide of anti-registration or
ganizing. It's (President Richard)
Nixon all over again."
'On the sly'
Assistant Dean for Residential Edu
cation Norman Robinson disclaimed
any knowledge of what had been goinj>
on. "This is appalling news to me. The
University must have been working on
the sly with the contractors who instal

led the smoke detectors.
"I cannot continue to work for a uni
versity that practices this kind of sub
terfuge on its students. Corrective ac
tion must be taken immediately," he
added.
But Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News and Publications Service,
said he does not think the publicity will
adversely affect the University.
"People must understand that a multip
licity of factors affect any decision of
this complexity. It's not a matter of
black and white the way some people
choose to see it."

this complexity. It's not a matter of
black and white the way some people
choose to see it."
The FBI, in cooperation with the
University, has been electronically
eavesdropping on student conversa
tions for several months, the Daily has
learned.
The bugging devices were installed
under the guise of smoke-detecting
equipment at Columbae, Sigma Chi,
La Maison Francaise and Synergy.
Students whose suspicions were
aroused during idle speculation on the
nature of the 'smoke detectors' opened
the devices during last week's spring
break and found microphones con
cealed in each one.
"It's real convenient for them," said
electrical engineering major Jane
Kent, who confirmed for the Daily that
the houses had been bugged.
"They used the detectors as a pretext
to run electrical conduits from room to
room. And they keep the control
cabinet locked, supposedly to keep re
sidents from turning the alarms off by
themselves."

The smoke detectors were located
mostly in the houses' common areas.
Private rooms were largely unaffected.
FBI Information Officer Emma
Flack of the bureau's San Francisco of
fice refused to comment, but one of the
agents involved said the bureau had
obtained no warrant before installing
the bugs.
"When you're looking for evidence
of political conspiracy," said the agent,
"it is not standard operating procedure
to go through the courts. It is usually
too touchy for most two-bit judges."
She declined to state exactly what kind
of "political conspiracy" the bureau
had expected to find or whether any
charges or further investigations would
stem from the buggings. Residents
speculated the FBI was pursuing leads
in the anti-draft registration move
ment.
It was believed yesterday that the
bugs would be deactivated in response

to the publicity that will now surround
them. It was not immediately known
whether any of the phones at the
houses had been tapped.
President Richard Lyman claimed
his office had not been involved in the
planning of the buggings, but admitted
that reports had reached his desk based
on some of the recorded conversations.
"The reports were useful in some of
the Honor Code cases that have crop
ped up recently,"said Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons. "We were able to
get definitive evidence against the stu
dents who had been cheating."
Asked if he thought the bugging it
self represented an Honor Code viola
tion, Lyons replied, "Clearly not.
People have to be willing to take re
sponsibility for what they say. That's a
problem with some people these days."
'Not illegal'
University Counsel John Schwartz
said the buggings do not constitute an
infringement of the residents' constitu
tional rights nor their rights to privacy
under the Residence Agreement.
He said the Constitution is intended
only to protect citizens from gov
ernmental abuses, and that the Univer
sity, as a private organization, was
within the law.
As to the Residence Agreement, he
said the contract only proscribes bodily
intrusion. "This is not the same kind of
invasion of personal space," he said.
Residents of the affected houses dis
agreed.
'Outraged'
"I'm personally outraged," said
Laura Memhard, RA (house associate)
at Columbae House. "The basic trust
that has existed between administra
tion and residents is fast eroding."
Residents of the Sigma Chi fraternity
were of similar opinion. Said ASSU
Senator Vance Mason, "This time, the
University has gone too far. We won't
swallow a Big Brother looking over our
shoulder as easily as we swallowed a
Western Culture requirement or the
reinstitution of the 'D.' "

One resident of Columbae added,
"This just goes to show you, the
paranoid Left was right all along.
There's no doubt in my mind that the
FBI was gathering intelligence about
the anti-nuclear movement and the
swelling tide of anti-registration or
ganizing. It's (President Richard)
Nixon all over again."
'On the sly'
Assistant Dean for Residential Edu
cation Norman Robinson disclaimed
any knowledge of what had been goinj>
on. "This is appalling news to me. The
University must have been working on
the sly with the contractors who instal

led the smoke detectors.
"I cannot continue to work for a uni
versity that practices this kind of sub
terfuge on its students. Corrective ac
tion must be taken immediately," he
added.
But Bob Beyers, director of the Uni
versity News and Publications Service,
said he does not think the publicity will
adversely affect the University.
"People must understand that a multip
licity of factors affect any decision of
this complexity. It's not a matter of
