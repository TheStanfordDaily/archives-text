# Alumni Association offers extensive travel

Imagine a trek through Nepal
in the spring, or whale-watching
in the Sea of Cortez, or scanning
the rugged Scandinavian coast
from the decks of a luxurious
350-foot clipper ship. Imagine
that you don't have to he Sir
Edmund Hilary or Jacques
Cousteau or Leif Erickson to
turn these imaginings into real
excursions — that all you have to
he is a Stanford alumnus, friend
or supporter.
Each year, the Stanford
Alumni Association offers an
array of travel/study programs to
interested alumni, family and
friends, parents of current and
past students, and friends of the
University. This year 23 diffe
rent programs are being offered
in three distinct categories:
— expeditions and wilderness
programs, including a Green
River expedition, an East Afri
can natural history safari, a
Hopi-Navajo land expedition
and a Grand Canyon expedition;
— seminars and tours of par
ticular countries, including a
Guatemala Mayan seminar,
seminars in China and Japan,
a European music seminar;
— "colleges" or cruises on
privately chartered luxury ves
sels such as College on the Mis
sissippi (two weeks on the fam
ous Delta Queen), College on the
Nile. College on the Danube and
the new 1 980 Viking College (15
days of sailing along the Scan

dinavian coast).
Each trip is led by two profes
sors and a representative of the
Alumni Association The
Travel/Study Program
employees plan all the trips in
conjunction with the professors,
who each submit a syllabus and
suggest an itinerary for lectures
and excursions. Professors also
suggest and send out two or three
books which supplement these
lectures and excursions to be
read before the trip gets under
way.
The professors are usually
Stanford affiliates but sometimes
come from other institutions.
11l is is particularly true for the
wilderness excursions due to the
absence of qualified natural his
torians here at Stanford. Occa
sionally a graduate student with
a particular expertise is included
in lieu of a professor.
Cultural
On the wilderness trips, the
participants study the natural,
geological and, in some cases,
cultural history of the area being
explored. The seminars tend to
explore the character of a coun
try's society and culture. Semi
nar itineraries usually focus on
visits to important cities and lec
tures on national history, social
mores, culture and folkcrafts.
The colleges, the most expensive
and extravagant of all the prog
rams, include lectures and shore
excursions in addition to the cus

tomary fare of meals, movies,
jazz and cocktails.
The trips usually change each
year, but some have been so
popular and have attracted such
a following that they are now
considered standard. It is neces
sary, for instance, to make reser
vations two years in advance lor
the College on the Danube,
which is led each year by former
Dean of Admissions at Stanford,
Rixford Snyder, and Emeritus
History Prof. Wayne Vueinich, a
specialist in Eastern European
history.
The Grand Canyon expedition
is also an old favorite, as is the
Aegian College, which has been
replaced this year with the Col
lege on the Mediterranean.
Extravagance
Another new trip this year,
and probably the most extravag
ant to date, is the 1980 Viking
College. The Stanford Alumni
Association is the first organiza
tion from the United States to
charter the Sea Cloud — a clip
per ship that E.F. Mutton had
built as a wedding present for his
fiancee, Marjorie Merriweather
Post. Longer than the Stanford
football field, the Sea Cloud is
the largest private sailing vessel
ever built. The cabins and state
rooms are all wood-panelled,
and some are even furnished
with antiques. The vessel was re
furbished in 1979 at a cost of
$6.5 million and now accommo

dates NO passengers at a
minimum cost of $5000 per per
son for 15 days. And that figure
excludes the $K9O it takes to get
to Bergen, Norway, where the
ship departs.
In general, the trips range in
cost from $340 on the Green
River expedition to $5000 on the
Viking College or the African
safari trip. The average si/e of
each program varies anywhere
from 20 on most of the river ex
cursions to 1 HO or more on some
of the chartered ships in the "col
lege" program.
The average age of the par
ticipants is between 50 and 60.
The trips are open to almost
anyone that can afford them and
is somehow affiliated with Stan
ford. For instance, friends of the
University — i.e., those that
have communicated their friend
ship in the form of substantial
donations and endowments
and non-alumni affiliate mem
bers of the Alumni Association
frequently partake of the prog
ram's pleasure in addition to the
alums themselves, their friends
and families.
nourishing
The Travel/Study Program
was begun in I 973 by Snyderand
is now in its seventh year. Ac
cording to current program di
rector Peter Voll, the program
has expanded from only three
trips in 1973 to 23 in 1980 with
1300 people currently participat

ing. Voll attributes this substan
tial increase to the energy and
charisma of his predecessor that
is very much apparent in the con
tinued popularity of the Danube
trip.
" The focus of the program is
on enjoyment and education,"
Voll said. Its role, however, is
one of public relations. "We try
to select charismatic professors
and in some cases graduates or
graduate students," Voll admit
ted, "that will boost the alumnus'
assessment of the University.
Although the Alumni Associ
ation is not directly involved in
fundraising for Stanford, the re
sult of these attempts to raise
alumni opinion very often takes
the form of donations and en
dowments to departments within
the University. Voll concluded
that "the University benefits di
rectly by sending professors as
'good-will ambassadors' on the
Alumni trips."
Successful
The trips are consistently a
great success, not only in the
amount of money they bring into
the University, but in the general
appreciation of the participants
as a whole who are inclined to
re-enroll in the program year
after year. In keeping with the
idea of continuing education,
Voll says that in each trip he
"tries to build an unparalleled
educational experience —an ex
