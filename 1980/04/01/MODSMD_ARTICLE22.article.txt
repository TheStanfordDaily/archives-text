# Emissions control adds to acid rain

LOS ANGELES â€”Trying
to prevent an attempt to
lighten the state's new car
emission standards, the state
Air Resources Board (ARB)
said last Thursday a new
study shows any relaxation in
the standards will increase
Southern California's "acid
ram" problem.
The study was released at
the board's regular meeting
here to discuss legislative at
tempts to pare California's
emission standards to less
strict levels set by the federal
government.
Some groups, including
major U.S. automakers, have
charged that the extra con
trols are unnecessary and
contribute to higher auto
costs by having to include
special emission devices on
vehicles shipped to the state.
The ARB countered ear
lier this year that the au
tomakers were raising the
prices of the devices arbitrar
ily in an effort to persuade
consumers to push for the
standards roll-back.
At the board meeting,
ARB Chairwoman Marv
Nichols charged that special
interest groups use phony re

search to justify their claims
that the state's unique stan
dards are unnecessary.
The study unveiled by the
ARB showed "acid rain"
levels in Southern California
10 to 100 times greater than
unpolluted rain, and equal to
levels often found in highly
industrialized portions of the
East.
"Acid rain" is rainfall that,
while falling through a layer
of smog, brings acid and other
pollutants to the ground. In
dustrialized areas marked by
factories with high smokes
tacks also are known to suffer
from the polluted rain.
The result, some analysts
say, is that the ecological ba
lance of lakes, forests and ag
ricultural areas is upset.
The study, conducted by
James Morgan of the Califor
nia Institute of Technology in
Pasadena, also said emissions
of nitrogen oxides from vehi
cles dominate the make-up of
acid rain in Southern Califor
nia.
ARB analysis claims the
rolling back of the state's
emission standards would re
sult in a near doubling of nit
rogen oxide emissions in the
Los Angeles area by 1990.
