# Supersonic plane could show profit

WASHINGTON — Despite
the commercial failure of today's
supersonic airliners, an ad
vanced high-speed jet could he
economically successful in the
future if it overcame major fuel
and environmental questions,
says a congressional study.
The report released Sunday by
the Office of Technology As
sessment says a second
generation advanced supersonic
transport — AST — which flies
faster and carries more passen
gers than current models could
account for $50 billion in sales
through the year 2010.
An American AST could take
about one-third of the total sales
of long distance aircraft within
the next 30 years, the report
says. But producing such a plane
would require overcoming many
obstacles, not the least of which
is the future price and availabil
ity of fuel, it adds.
"Given that an AST would
have fuel consumption rates at
least 1.5 to 2 times greater than
equivalently sized subsonic
transports, it would be more sen
sitive to fuel price increases than
a subsonic aircraft," the study

says.
The Office of Technology As
sessment. an agency that advises
Congress on technical matters
and suggests policy options, did
the study for the House Science
and Technology Committee. It
was not asked to, and did not
make recommendations about
whether the AST should or
should not be built.
But given the probability of an
expanded future air transport
market and the economic impor
tance of sustaining U.S. aviation
leadership, "it appears that it
would be in our national interest
to keep our options open in the
supersonic field." the agency
said.
Even if Congress keeps the op
tion open, there is no assurance
that airlines will be able or wil
ling to buy such planes or that
manufacturers will make them,
the report said.
A proposed American super
sonic airliner was cancelled in
1971 because of economic and
environmental considerations.
Since then, federal agencies have
spent about $10 million a year on
supersonic research.
