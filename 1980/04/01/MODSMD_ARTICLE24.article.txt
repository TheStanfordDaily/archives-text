# Efficient engine set for Fairfield
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
A 90 percent efficient electricity
producing, heat-generating module ap
propriately named the TOTEM (Total
Energy Module) will be installed for ex
perimental purposes in late August at the
Fairfield Animal Facility near Travis Air
Force Base.
The unit may be available for public use
within two years.
The TOTEM, manufactured by Fiat, is
the engine of a Fiat 127 automobile put
into a 42-inch cubic box with heat ex
changers and a generator. The auto en
gine drives an electric generator, and the
excess heat is captured for water and
space heating. The system operates at an
efficiency rate in excess of 90 percent,
compared to about 40 percent for most
electric generating systems now in use.
Wilson Clark, energy advisor to Gov.
Jerry Brown, said the TOTEM has appli
cations for commercial and industrial
buildings and 16-unit or larger apartment
houses whose owners want their own elec
trical energy supply as well as a system to
heat the buildings and water supply.
Two of the refrigerator-sized units will
be installed for testing purposes at a 24-
hour animal research facility at Fairfield
in August. They will be the first on the
West Coast, and the state plans to exper
iment with their capacity for air condition

ing. The TOTEM will also be tested on
reliability and potential product commer
cialization.
The Fairfield site was selected because
it operates 24 hours a day, seven days a
week and therefore can be used as a
model for apartment buildings, restaur
ants and industrial facilities.
The TOTEM runs on various fuels
from natural gas to biogas. A spokesman
for Fiat said he knows of one instance
where the TOTEM was used on a farm in
Europe and the farmer used the biogas
from decaying manure produced by his
500 cows to run the engine.
"You don't get a greater efficiency rate
because you're producing fuel from gar
bage, but what you're doing is feeding the
TOTEM a renewable resource," said a
spokesman from Brooklyn Union Gas
Co., which brought the TOTEM to the
United States from Europe. "The be
nefits are more environmental and con
servational."
A TOTEM is capable of producing 15
kilowatts of three-phase electrical power
and 131,000 BTUs per hour. Its pollution
emission is nominal.
Depending on the energy need, several
TOTEMs can be connected together to
produce the necessary energy level.
"As the need gets greater, you use two
or three or five, six, seven TOTEMs. You
just line them up next to one another and

they produce," said Anthony Ciminera of
Fiat.
"One really nice thing about the
TOTEM is that if one fails, the others
keep running," he said. "Say you've got
10 of them heating an apartment building.
If one fails, the other nine keep running,
and the average consumer doesn't even
notice a change. I think this is a fine at
tempt at getting rid of the complete
black-out."
Considering the United States' struggl
ing automobile industry, Clark said the
TOTEM is "an exciting concept."
"Rather than having people in the au
tomobile industry lose their jobs, this
gives us the promise of changing au
tomobile production into an efficient way
of producing energy."
He said the United States has "already
been whipped by the Japanese and Euro
pean automobile manufacturers in effi
ciency," and the new method of energy
production could be put into effect by
American car manufacturers.
The TOTEM module is designed to
produce heat and electric power. It is
fueled with methane gas and has an elec
tric asynchronous motor directly coupled
to the engine by a joint.
Clark said the TOTEM should be av
ailable for public use within two years.
"Once people know about this unit, I
think it'll take off like wildfire," he said.
