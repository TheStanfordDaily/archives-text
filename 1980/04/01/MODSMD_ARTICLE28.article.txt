## Magical world of ABT 
### 
The arrival of the American Bal
let Theatre every winter at San
Francisco Opera House is like opera
season all over again. There is the
same rush to get tickets to see per
formers of international reputation;
the disappointment when told a per
formance is sold out; the glitter and
excitement of opening night; the
long line of people who have waited
hours to buy tickets for standing
room; the lavish sets and costumes;
the bravos and criticism accompany
ing every performance.
Indeed, that which has made the
San Francisco Opera so successful is
that which also has made the ABT
so popular: its stable of interna
tional stars.
The American Ballet Theatre has
been criticized — most recently and
vociferously by its own corps de bal
let— for its heavy dependence upon
Soviet dancers, but the dependence
does appear justified. The stars are
whom the public pays to see. The
only sold-out performances this
year were those in which either
Natalia Makarova or Alexander
Godunov danced
Apart from those who attend
merely out of curiosity or social ob
ligation. the majority of the public
goes to witness firsthand a great per
formance, and with few exceptions
— one of whom is Gelsey Kirkland,
who left the company last year —
only the Soviets are able to deliver.
American dancers simply do not
have the technical prowess and style
of their Soviet counterparts. Who in
this country — or for that matter, in
the world — can equal
Baryshnikov's pyrotechnical tours

or Makarova's ethereal grace?
The unfortunate aspect is that
while the Soviet dancers are paid
six-figure sums, dancers in the corps
— previous to last September's
celebrated lockout — were paid an
appalling $8,000 a year, less than
the musicians who played for them.
This year the company presented
the two full-length ballets, Giselle
and Swan Lake, as well as programs
consisting of shorter pieces: In
terplay, Dark Elegies, Other
Dances, Theme and Variations,
Contredances, Etudes, Miss Julie,
Billy the Kid and Jardin Au.x Lilas.
On the whole, I found Giselle and
Swan Lake more satisfying than the
programs of shorter works. Not only
are their sets and costumes more
lavish, and their plots romantic and
more developed, but they can be
vehicles for some of the most thril
ling classical dancing ever witnes
sed.
Giselle
Giselle is a romantic ballet written
by Theophile Gautier and choreog
raphed by Jean Coralli and Jules
Perrot. Two years ago I saw Gelsey
Kirkland. partnered by Mikhail
Baryshnikov, give the definitive
performance as the girl who dies of a
broken heart and becomes a Willi (a
spirit who entraps men). This sea
son, not even the great Makarova,
partnered by no less than Alexander
Godunov, could equal that perfor
mance.
Makarova is grace itself. Nothing,
absolutely nothing she does has
even the slightest suggestion of hesi
tation. awkwardness or effort. It al
ways is thrilling to watch her dance.

Nevertheless. Giselle is a frail, inno
cent girl and Makarova is unable to
convincingly convey the youth,
buoyance and naivete essential to
the part. She also lacks the extraor
dinary elasticity Kirkland com
mands.
Godonov was a disappointment.
He appeared to merely walk
through the ballet, carrying his body
gracefully but ponderously; moving
his limbs lithely but sloppily. Al
though his dancing was smooth and
assured, it lacked boih the technical
feats of Baryshnikov and the stylis
tic definition of Anthony Dowell.
His acting fluctuated between the
nonexistent and the self-conscious.
In fairness to Godunov, however,
he may not have had sufficient time
to rehearse, because he only re
cently arrived from Germany.
When I saw him dance a pas de deux
with Makarova on a PBS special two
weeks ago,he was superb.
Mariana Tcherkassky and Kirk
Peterson's interpretation of Giselle,
although less polished, was refresh
ing by comparison. Tcherkassky is
not only similar in build to
Makarova but has an uncannily
similar style of dancing. One could
almost confuse the two, if Makarova
were not so flawlessly graceful.
Tcherkassky not only is a gifted
dancer, but a wonderful actress as
well, able to convey youth, vul
nerability and vibrancy. In Giselle
she added details to make her
character more convincing, such as
ripping from her neck a priceless
medallion when she learns that she
and the princess who gave it to her
are betrothed to the same man.
Peterson was a good partner,
dancer, and. above all, actor. Al
though his dancing was not extraor
dinary, he was smooth and convinc
ing as the duplicitous Count Al
brecht.
'Swan Lake*
The highlight of this season's en
gagement was the Makarova-
Dowell Swan Lake. Makarova un
questionably gave the definitive
performance as Odette/Odile. As
Odette, the princess-turned-swan,
she was sensual and mysterious; as
Odile, Odette's impersonator, she
was malevolent, seductive, sleek
and bewitching. She had the audi
ence completely enthralled and sh
outing well-deserved "bravas" at
her every movement. At one point
the entire auditorium was filled with
gasps as she made her undulating
arms appear as beating wings. She
was brilliant.
Dowell, who was the youngest
dancer to have the order of the
British Empire conferred upon him,
cuts a magnificent figure. His
movements have bravura and clar
ity. However, it is painfully clear
that approaching the age of 40, he
haspassedhis prime. Rarely does he
execute a difficult step without a
slight hesitation or falter. Neverthe
less, his dancing is so bold, his acting
so accomplished, and his deport
ment so assured that one can forgive
him his flaws.
Makarova and Dowell emoted

when they danced together, sending
waves of electricity through the au
ditorium. It was a breathtaking and
unforgettable performance.
'Miss Julie'
There appear to be two distin
guishable styles of dancing in the
current company. One is the
Makarova school, with disciple
Mariana Tcherkassky. Its dancers
are ethereal with crisp, well-defined
movements. The other is the Mar
tinevanHamelschool with Rebecca
Wright and Kristine Elliot. The three
are solid, competent dancers who
carry themselves proudly, but their
movements are strained and lack
the seemingly effortless grace of the
Makarova school.
In Miss Julie, based on the August
Strindberg play about a woman
educated to hate and fear men, the
Dutch van Hamel uses her imperi
ousness and earthy qualities to her
advantage. She does a wonderful
job of portraying the commanding
mistress in the opening of the piece;
the wanton spirit who encourages
the advances of the butler, Jean
(Kevin McKenzie), and the desper
ate and agonized figure who is dri
ven to suicide after Jean's seduction
of her. It's a meaty role and van
Hamel did an excellent job.
Other narrative ballets
Jardin Aux Lilas, by Anthony
Tudor, is a melancholy, Edward
Goreyesque work about an 18th
century maiden entering into a mar
riage of convenience, who attends a
pre-nuptial reception at which are
present both her fiance's mistress
and the man she really loves. Kevin

McKenzie was as graceful in the role
of the lover as he was as Jean in Miss
Julie.
A refreshingly different ballet is
Billy the Kid, a chronicle of the life
of the notorious outlaw. Aaron
Copland's music, specially orches
tratedforthe ABTby Coplandhim
self, conjures up a haunting feeling
of the Old West, and Eugene Lor
ing's choreography with Jared
French's scenery and costumes
seem all of a piece.
Neoclassical ballets
Etudes by Harold Lander begins
with a few dancers at the bar doing
their warmup exercises and prog
resses to a chandelier-lit stage fully
populated with corps members, in
graceful three-quarter length dres
ses and princely tunics, via nearly
every ballet step imaginable from
fourtees to rond elans.
George Balanchine's Theme and
Variations is a lovely piece, with
dancers dressed royally in red and
gold. The only problem is that this
work, as Etudes, depends heavily
upon the synchronization of the
corps de ballet, which is notorious
for their inability to dance together.
There is an explanation, however, if
not a justification. The company
was on tour; it had only one rehear
sal hall; and union rules dictate that
no rehearsals can be held on two
performance days, only two hours
of rehearsal can be held on one
performance days, and no more
than five hours can be held on non
performance days. Because the
ABT's repertoire is so large, when
the members of the corps were able

to get the studio away from the prin
cipals, they rehearsed their solos,
pas de deux and pas de trois almost
to the exclusion of the corps num
bers.
This is a pity since a well
synchronized corps is essential not
only for a great performance but for
a truly great company.
Modern works
Interestingly enough, of the three
"modern-looking" pieces, two were
written decades before many of the
neoclassical ones. Interplay by
Jerome Robbins was first per
formed in 1945, and Dark Elegies,
by Anthony Tudor, was first danced
in 1937. Interplay is a light, plotless,
work highlighted by Danilo
Radojevic's double tours en I'air
which now, in retrospect, appears
full of cliches.
Dark Elegies is an abstruse and
ponderous narrative of the death of
a child. The music is Mahler's Kin
dertotenlieder, and the scenery
looks like it came from the studio of
Caspar David Friedrich.
Robbins' Other Dances, created
for Natalia Makarova and Mikhail
Baryshnikov in 1976, is a playful
work danced exquisitely by
Makarova and Dowell, who have an
amazing rapport.
Although the ABT's two-week
engagement last month contained
disappointing moments as well as
thrilling ones, as with the opera sea
son, overall, it was a satisfying ex
cursion into a world of beauty, artis
try and magic.

The arrival of the American Bal
let Theatre every winter at San
Francisco Opera House is like opera
season all over again. There is the
same rush to get tickets to see per
formers of international reputation;
the disappointment when told a per
formance is sold out; the glitter and
excitement of opening night; the
long line of people who have waited
hours to buy tickets for standing
room; the lavish sets and costumes;
the bravos and criticism accompany
ing every performance.
Indeed, that which has made the
San Francisco Opera so successful is
that which also has made the ABT
so popular: its stable of interna
tional stars.
The American Ballet Theatre has
been criticized — most recently and
vociferously by its own corps de bal
let— for its heavy dependence upon
Soviet dancers, but the dependence
does appear justified. The stars are
whom the public pays to see. The
only sold-out performances this
year were those in which either
Natalia Makarova or Alexander
Godunov danced
Apart from those who attend
merely out of curiosity or social ob
ligation. the majority of the public
goes to witness firsthand a great per
formance, and with few exceptions
— one of whom is Gelsey Kirkland,
who left the company last year —
only the Soviets are able to deliver.
American dancers simply do not
have the technical prowess and style
of their Soviet counterparts. Who in
this country — or for that matter, in
the world — can equal
Baryshnikov's pyrotechnical tours

or Makarova's ethereal grace?
The unfortunate aspect is that
while the Soviet dancers are paid
six-figure sums, dancers in the corps
— previous to last September's
celebrated lockout — were paid an
appalling $8,000 a year, less than
the musicians who played for them.
This year the company presented
the two full-length ballets, Giselle
and Swan Lake, as well as programs
consisting of shorter pieces: In
terplay, Dark Elegies, Other
Dances, Theme and Variations,
Contredances, Etudes, Miss Julie,
Billy the Kid and Jardin Au.x Lilas.
On the whole, I found Giselle and
Swan Lake more satisfying than the
programs of shorter works. Not only
are their sets and costumes more
lavish, and their plots romantic and
more developed, but they can be
vehicles for some of the most thril
ling classical dancing ever witnes
sed.
Giselle
Giselle is a romantic ballet written
by Theophile Gautier and choreog
raphed by Jean Coralli and Jules
Perrot. Two years ago I saw Gelsey
Kirkland. partnered by Mikhail
Baryshnikov, give the definitive
performance as the girl who dies of a
broken heart and becomes a Willi (a
spirit who entraps men). This sea
son, not even the great Makarova,
partnered by no less than Alexander
Godunov, could equal that perfor
mance.
Makarova is grace itself. Nothing,
absolutely nothing she does has
even the slightest suggestion of hesi
tation. awkwardness or effort. It al
ways is thrilling to watch her dance.

Nevertheless. Giselle is a frail, inno
cent girl and Makarova is unable to
convincingly convey the youth,
buoyance and naivete essential to
the part. She also lacks the extraor
dinary elasticity Kirkland com
mands.
Godonov was a disappointment.
He appeared to merely walk
through the ballet, carrying his body
gracefully but ponderously; moving
his limbs lithely but sloppily. Al
though his dancing was smooth and
assured, it lacked boih the technical
feats of Baryshnikov and the stylis
tic definition of Anthony Dowell.
His acting fluctuated between the
nonexistent and the self-conscious.
In fairness to Godunov, however,
he may not have had sufficient time
to rehearse, because he only re
cently arrived from Germany.
When I saw him dance a pas de deux
with Makarova on a PBS special two
weeks ago,he was superb.
Mariana Tcherkassky and Kirk
Peterson's interpretation of Giselle,
although less polished, was refresh
ing by comparison. Tcherkassky is
not only similar in build to
Makarova but has an uncannily
similar style of dancing. One could
almost confuse the two, if Makarova
were not so flawlessly graceful.
Tcherkassky not only is a gifted
dancer, but a wonderful actress as
well, able to convey youth, vul
nerability and vibrancy. In Giselle
she added details to make her
character more convincing, such as
ripping from her neck a priceless
medallion when she learns that she
and the princess who gave it to her
are betrothed to the same man.
Peterson was a good partner,
dancer, and. above all, actor. Al
though his dancing was not extraor
dinary, he was smooth and convinc
ing as the duplicitous Count Al
brecht.
'Swan Lake*
The highlight of this season's en
gagement was the Makarova-
Dowell Swan Lake. Makarova un
questionably gave the definitive
performance as Odette/Odile. As
Odette, the princess-turned-swan,
she was sensual and mysterious; as
Odile, Odette's impersonator, she
was malevolent, seductive, sleek
and bewitching. She had the audi
ence completely enthralled and sh
outing well-deserved "bravas" at
her every movement. At one point
the entire auditorium was filled with
gasps as she made her undulating
arms appear as beating wings. She
was brilliant.
Dowell, who was the youngest
dancer to have the order of the
British Empire conferred upon him,
cuts a magnificent figure. His
movements have bravura and clar
ity. However, it is painfully clear
that approaching the age of 40, he
haspassedhis prime. Rarely does he
execute a difficult step without a
slight hesitation or falter. Neverthe
less, his dancing is so bold, his acting
so accomplished, and his deport
ment so assured that one can forgive
him his flaws.
Makarova and Dowell emoted

when they danced together, sending
waves of electricity through the au
ditorium. It was a breathtaking and
unforgettable performance.
'Miss Julie'
There appear to be two distin
guishable styles of dancing in the
current company. One is the
Makarova school, with disciple
Mariana Tcherkassky. Its dancers
are ethereal with crisp, well-defined
movements. The other is the Mar
tinevanHamelschool with Rebecca
Wright and Kristine Elliot. The three
are solid, competent dancers who
carry themselves proudly, but their
movements are strained and lack
the seemingly effortless grace of the
Makarova school.
In Miss Julie, based on the August
Strindberg play about a woman
educated to hate and fear men, the
Dutch van Hamel uses her imperi
ousness and earthy qualities to her
advantage. She does a wonderful
job of portraying the commanding
mistress in the opening of the piece;
the wanton spirit who encourages
the advances of the butler, Jean
(Kevin McKenzie), and the desper
ate and agonized figure who is dri
ven to suicide after Jean's seduction
of her. It's a meaty role and van
Hamel did an excellent job.
Other narrative ballets
Jardin Aux Lilas, by Anthony
Tudor, is a melancholy, Edward
Goreyesque work about an 18th
century maiden entering into a mar
riage of convenience, who attends a
pre-nuptial reception at which are
present both her fiance's mistress
and the man she really loves. Kevin

McKenzie was as graceful in the role
of the lover as he was as Jean in Miss
Julie.
A refreshingly different ballet is
Billy the Kid, a chronicle of the life
of the notorious outlaw. Aaron
Copland's music, specially orches
tratedforthe ABTby Coplandhim
self, conjures up a haunting feeling
of the Old West, and Eugene Lor
ing's choreography with Jared
French's scenery and costumes
seem all of a piece.
Neoclassical ballets
Etudes by Harold Lander begins
with a few dancers at the bar doing
their warmup exercises and prog
resses to a chandelier-lit stage fully
populated with corps members, in
graceful three-quarter length dres
ses and princely tunics, via nearly
every ballet step imaginable from
fourtees to rond elans.
George Balanchine's Theme and
Variations is a lovely piece, with
dancers dressed royally in red and
gold. The only problem is that this
work, as Etudes, depends heavily
upon the synchronization of the
corps de ballet, which is notorious
for their inability to dance together.
There is an explanation, however, if
not a justification. The company
was on tour; it had only one rehear
sal hall; and union rules dictate that
no rehearsals can be held on two
performance days, only two hours
of rehearsal can be held on one
performance days, and no more
than five hours can be held on non
performance days. Because the
ABT's repertoire is so large, when
the members of the corps were able

to get the studio away from the prin
cipals, they rehearsed their solos,
pas de deux and pas de trois almost
to the exclusion of the corps num
bers.
This is a pity since a well
synchronized corps is essential not
only for a great performance but for
a truly great company.
Modern works
Interestingly enough, of the three
"modern-looking" pieces, two were
written decades before many of the
neoclassical ones. Interplay by
Jerome Robbins was first per
formed in 1945, and Dark Elegies,
by Anthony Tudor, was first danced
in 1937. Interplay is a light, plotless,
work highlighted by Danilo
Radojevic's double tours en I'air
which now, in retrospect, appears
full of cliches.
Dark Elegies is an abstruse and
ponderous narrative of the death of
a child. The music is Mahler's Kin
dertotenlieder, and the scenery
looks like it came from the studio of
Caspar David Friedrich.
Robbins' Other Dances, created
for Natalia Makarova and Mikhail
Baryshnikov in 1976, is a playful
work danced exquisitely by
Makarova and Dowell, who have an
amazing rapport.
Although the ABT's two-week
engagement last month contained
disappointing moments as well as
thrilling ones, as with the opera sea
son, overall, it was a satisfying ex
cursion into a world of beauty, artis
try and magic.

Partnered by Anthony Dowell, Natalia Makarova drew bravas in Swan Lake
The arrival of the American Bal
let Theatre every winter at San
Francisco Opera House is like opera
season all over again. There is the
same rush to get tickets to see per
formers of international reputation;
the disappointment when told a per
formance is sold out; the glitter and
excitement of opening night; the
long line of people who have waited
hours to buy tickets for standing
room; the lavish sets and costumes;
the bravos and criticism accompany
ing every performance.
Indeed, that which has made the
San Francisco Opera so successful is
that which also has made the ABT
so popular: its stable of interna
tional stars.
The American Ballet Theatre has
been criticized — most recently and
vociferously by its own corps de bal
let— for its heavy dependence upon
Soviet dancers, but the dependence
does appear justified. The stars are
whom the public pays to see. The
only sold-out performances this
year were those in which either
Natalia Makarova or Alexander
Godunov danced
Apart from those who attend
merely out of curiosity or social ob
ligation. the majority of the public
goes to witness firsthand a great per
formance, and with few exceptions
— one of whom is Gelsey Kirkland,
who left the company last year —
only the Soviets are able to deliver.
American dancers simply do not
have the technical prowess and style
of their Soviet counterparts. Who in
this country — or for that matter, in
the world — can equal
Baryshnikov's pyrotechnical tours

or Makarova's ethereal grace?
The unfortunate aspect is that
while the Soviet dancers are paid
six-figure sums, dancers in the corps
— previous to last September's
celebrated lockout — were paid an
appalling $8,000 a year, less than
the musicians who played for them.
This year the company presented
the two full-length ballets, Giselle
and Swan Lake, as well as programs
consisting of shorter pieces: In
terplay, Dark Elegies, Other
Dances, Theme and Variations,
Contredances, Etudes, Miss Julie,
Billy the Kid and Jardin Au.x Lilas.
On the whole, I found Giselle and
Swan Lake more satisfying than the
programs of shorter works. Not only
are their sets and costumes more
lavish, and their plots romantic and
more developed, but they can be
vehicles for some of the most thril
ling classical dancing ever witnes
sed.
Giselle
Giselle is a romantic ballet written
by Theophile Gautier and choreog
raphed by Jean Coralli and Jules
Perrot. Two years ago I saw Gelsey
Kirkland. partnered by Mikhail
Baryshnikov, give the definitive
performance as the girl who dies of a
broken heart and becomes a Willi (a
spirit who entraps men). This sea
son, not even the great Makarova,
partnered by no less than Alexander
Godunov, could equal that perfor
mance.
Makarova is grace itself. Nothing,
absolutely nothing she does has
even the slightest suggestion of hesi
tation. awkwardness or effort. It al
ways is thrilling to watch her dance.

Nevertheless. Giselle is a frail, inno
cent girl and Makarova is unable to
convincingly convey the youth,
buoyance and naivete essential to
the part. She also lacks the extraor
dinary elasticity Kirkland com
mands.
Godonov was a disappointment.
He appeared to merely walk
through the ballet, carrying his body
gracefully but ponderously; moving
his limbs lithely but sloppily. Al
though his dancing was smooth and
assured, it lacked boih the technical
feats of Baryshnikov and the stylis
tic definition of Anthony Dowell.
His acting fluctuated between the
nonexistent and the self-conscious.
In fairness to Godunov, however,
he may not have had sufficient time
to rehearse, because he only re
cently arrived from Germany.
When I saw him dance a pas de deux
with Makarova on a PBS special two
weeks ago,he was superb.
Mariana Tcherkassky and Kirk
Peterson's interpretation of Giselle,
although less polished, was refresh
ing by comparison. Tcherkassky is
not only similar in build to
Makarova but has an uncannily
similar style of dancing. One could
almost confuse the two, if Makarova
were not so flawlessly graceful.
Tcherkassky not only is a gifted
dancer, but a wonderful actress as
well, able to convey youth, vul
nerability and vibrancy. In Giselle
she added details to make her
character more convincing, such as
ripping from her neck a priceless
medallion when she learns that she
and the princess who gave it to her
are betrothed to the same man.
Peterson was a good partner,
dancer, and. above all, actor. Al
though his dancing was not extraor
dinary, he was smooth and convinc
ing as the duplicitous Count Al
brecht.
'Swan Lake*
The highlight of this season's en
gagement was the Makarova-
Dowell Swan Lake. Makarova un
questionably gave the definitive
performance as Odette/Odile. As
Odette, the princess-turned-swan,
she was sensual and mysterious; as
Odile, Odette's impersonator, she
was malevolent, seductive, sleek
and bewitching. She had the audi
ence completely enthralled and sh
outing well-deserved "bravas" at
her every movement. At one point
the entire auditorium was filled with
gasps as she made her undulating
arms appear as beating wings. She
was brilliant.
Dowell, who was the youngest
dancer to have the order of the
British Empire conferred upon him,
cuts a magnificent figure. His
movements have bravura and clar
ity. However, it is painfully clear
that approaching the age of 40, he
haspassedhis prime. Rarely does he
execute a difficult step without a
slight hesitation or falter. Neverthe
less, his dancing is so bold, his acting
so accomplished, and his deport
ment so assured that one can forgive
him his flaws.
Makarova and Dowell emoted

when they danced together, sending
waves of electricity through the au
ditorium. It was a breathtaking and
unforgettable performance.
'Miss Julie'
There appear to be two distin
guishable styles of dancing in the
current company. One is the
Makarova school, with disciple
Mariana Tcherkassky. Its dancers
are ethereal with crisp, well-defined
movements. The other is the Mar
tinevanHamelschool with Rebecca
Wright and Kristine Elliot. The three
are solid, competent dancers who
carry themselves proudly, but their
movements are strained and lack
the seemingly effortless grace of the
Makarova school.
In Miss Julie, based on the August
Strindberg play about a woman
educated to hate and fear men, the
Dutch van Hamel uses her imperi
ousness and earthy qualities to her
advantage. She does a wonderful
job of portraying the commanding
mistress in the opening of the piece;
the wanton spirit who encourages
the advances of the butler, Jean
(Kevin McKenzie), and the desper
ate and agonized figure who is dri
ven to suicide after Jean's seduction
of her. It's a meaty role and van
Hamel did an excellent job.
Other narrative ballets
Jardin Aux Lilas, by Anthony
Tudor, is a melancholy, Edward
Goreyesque work about an 18th
century maiden entering into a mar
riage of convenience, who attends a
pre-nuptial reception at which are
present both her fiance's mistress
and the man she really loves. Kevin

McKenzie was as graceful in the role
of the lover as he was as Jean in Miss
Julie.
A refreshingly different ballet is
Billy the Kid, a chronicle of the life
of the notorious outlaw. Aaron
Copland's music, specially orches
tratedforthe ABTby Coplandhim
self, conjures up a haunting feeling
of the Old West, and Eugene Lor
ing's choreography with Jared
French's scenery and costumes
seem all of a piece.
Neoclassical ballets
Etudes by Harold Lander begins
with a few dancers at the bar doing
their warmup exercises and prog
resses to a chandelier-lit stage fully
populated with corps members, in
graceful three-quarter length dres
ses and princely tunics, via nearly
every ballet step imaginable from
fourtees to rond elans.
George Balanchine's Theme and
Variations is a lovely piece, with
dancers dressed royally in red and
gold. The only problem is that this
work, as Etudes, depends heavily
upon the synchronization of the
corps de ballet, which is notorious
for their inability to dance together.
There is an explanation, however, if
not a justification. The company
was on tour; it had only one rehear
sal hall; and union rules dictate that
no rehearsals can be held on two
performance days, only two hours
of rehearsal can be held on one
performance days, and no more
than five hours can be held on non
performance days. Because the
ABT's repertoire is so large, when
the members of the corps were able

to get the studio away from the prin
cipals, they rehearsed their solos,
pas de deux and pas de trois almost
to the exclusion of the corps num
bers.
This is a pity since a well
synchronized corps is essential not
only for a great performance but for
a truly great company.
Modern works
Interestingly enough, of the three
"modern-looking" pieces, two were
written decades before many of the
neoclassical ones. Interplay by
Jerome Robbins was first per
formed in 1945, and Dark Elegies,
by Anthony Tudor, was first danced
in 1937. Interplay is a light, plotless,
work highlighted by Danilo
Radojevic's double tours en I'air
which now, in retrospect, appears
full of cliches.
Dark Elegies is an abstruse and
ponderous narrative of the death of
a child. The music is Mahler's Kin
dertotenlieder, and the scenery
looks like it came from the studio of
Caspar David Friedrich.
Robbins' Other Dances, created
for Natalia Makarova and Mikhail
Baryshnikov in 1976, is a playful
work danced exquisitely by
Makarova and Dowell, who have an
amazing rapport.
Although the ABT's two-week
engagement last month contained
disappointing moments as well as
thrilling ones, as with the opera sea
son, overall, it was a satisfying ex
cursion into a world of beauty, artis
try and magic.
