# Danko, Manuel at the Waldorf
## Ups and downs with a 'band of friends' 
### 
When Rick Danko and
Richard Manuel, former mem
bers of The Band, brought their
new group into the Old Waldorf
last week, they were greeted by
an audience which was going to
be difficult to please.
First, many members of the
audience, including this re
viewer, originally had gone to an
earlier show, only to find out it
had been canceled just a couple
of hours before, because of
poor ticket sales.
The Old Waldorf always has
had a rather crowded and un
comfortable atmosphere, but
now that Bill Graham has taken
it over, it offers an inconsiderate
staff as well.
This combination can make an
audience less than receptive; for
tunately, Danko and Manuel
have been around long enough
that they've played in front of
almost every kind of audience in
most every kind of location, and
thus even an Old Waldorf crowd
could not keep them from get
ting loose and having a good
time.
The show had been billed as an
evening with Rick Danko,
Richard Manuel and "their band
of friends;" many members of
the audience had taken this to
mean a possible reunion of The
Band, while others came expect
ing guest appearances by some

big names. In recent gigs down in
Lx)s Angeles, such notables as Joe
Cocker. Dr. John, and ex-Band
member Levon Helm had joined
Danko and Manuel on stage, but
star-gazers only could find solace
away from the stage, where Van
Morrison was seated in the audi
ence.
The "band of friends" proved
to be three quite capable, yet
somewhat unfamiliar, musicians
who had all played with Danko

Fortunately, Danko and Manuel have been
around long enough that they've played in
front of almost every kind of audience . . .
even an Old Waldorf crowd could not keep
them from getting loose. . . .

during his recent series of gigs
with Paul Butterfield: Rick
Beilke on lead guitar, Tom
Stevensen on keyboards, and
Ron Mcßorey on drums.
Stevensen was the keyboardist
with Joe Walsh and Barnstorm,
and some of the members of the
audience might have recognized
Mcßorey as the drummer who
accompanied Gary Busey (star
of The Buddy Holly Story ) on his
recent tour, especially since

Busey was the opening act at one
of Danko's previous Waldorf
shows.
Beilke is an L.A. session
player who, judging by his guitar
work last week, has had quite a
bit of experience playing the
blues.
Throughout the evening,
Danko was extremely energetic,
entertaining the audience not
only with the fine bass work

people have come to expect of
him, but also with his happy-go
lucky stage demeanor; it was
quite clear that he was feeling no
pain as he pranced around the
stage, laughing and telling the
audience that "every day is
Christmas." As for Manuel, he
was a bit more subtle, and did not
really show any tremendous
signs of vitality about playing live
again; his piano work was
adequate, but did not stand out.

The greatest response that the
group got was when it did two old
Band numbers, "Stage Fright"
and"The Shape I'm In." Rather
than strictly relive the past, how
ever, the group also did a range
of other material, including some
blues pieces that sounded very
energetic; as one could tell from
listening to the encore, "Mystery
Train," the group was clearly at
its best when it went after the
blues, rather than the country
sound.
The vocal work by both
Danko and Manuel definitely
was the biggest flaw in the the
show; perhaps it was because this
was the group's third perfor
mance in two nights; but, at
many points, Danko and Manuel
were beyond the stage of just
sounding rusty, and the group
seemed to be in dire need of a
vocalist.
By the time the show ended,
although Danko and Manuel had
not done what many people
would have liked them to do,
they had presented the audience
with a new, tight band.
Like the performer in "Stage
Fright," Danko and Manuel are
two performers who, when they
get to the end, decide to start all
over again; it's for this reason
that they've been around so long.
