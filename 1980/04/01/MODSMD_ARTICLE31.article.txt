# 'A Piece of Monologue'
## Beckett premiere Friday 
### 
When the curtain opens, the
audience sees, from right to left
on a dimly-lit stage, the foot of a
pallet bed, a white floorlamp with
dimly-lit globe, and the figure of
Speaker . . . No sound, no
movement. After 10 seconds,
Speaker begins the 55-minute sol
iloquy . . . The image is that of an
old man's nightly confrontation
with his life and death.
- From a program note of the
La Mama Theatre Club
The scenario, typically stark,
typically Beckett, belongs to A
Piece of Monologue, a new play
by the master writer.
The work will receive its West
Coast premiere Friday in the Lit
tle Theater.
Drama Prof. Martin Esslin will
introduce the play and its solo
performer, David Warrilow.
Samuel Beckett wrote the
monologue for Warrilow, a liter
ary editor and actor, shortly after
the men met in Europe.
Warrilow presented his own
staging of the piece in a world
premiere at New York's La
Mama theater club last De
cember.
Critics praised both performer
and playwright for joining in the
creation of an intense, electrify
ing vigil: (a) man faces what
Beckett calls "black void ... the
light ... the dead and the gone,
the dying and going."
Warrilow's Speaker has a bed
but cannot sleep, yet cannot bear
the wakefulness. He talks of
births, deaths, the spaces bet
ween; and in the negative
philosophy which Beckett has
voiced from the days of Godot:
the early play opened with "No
thing to be done." In this work,
the Speaker adds, "Nothing to
be heard, anywhere."
The language is spare and re
petitive, tiny drumbeats now
familiar, music which depends
upon timing and mood — almost
by necessity, because Warrilow
stretches three pages of speech
into 55 minutes.
In A Piece of Monologue,
"character is sacrificed for temp
erature," according to a New
York Times critic. "It is a dead
of-night soliloquy, an elegy to
the brevity of life and the pro
ximity of death."
Indeed, the Speaker'sgrasp on
life is as weak as the only light in
his world: a globe lamp, which
burns ominously or faithfully,

but not long enough.
"The gaunt man in white finds
a soundless echo in the tall, in
animate lamp," a Soho reviewer
wrote. "A mysterious continuum
is set up between the person alive
but moving toward death, and
the thing dead but glowing with
life."
Just as man and lamp become
one, Warrilow and Beckett have
merged talents, in a sense, iden

tities: "It's hard to say where one
leaves off and the other begins,"
the Soho writer continued. "The
men have distilled Beckett's
usual preoccupations to an in
tensive solo."
A Piece of Monologue begins
at 4:30 p.m. The free program is
sponsored by the Department of
Drama. All seats are reserved.
Very few remain.
