Bani-Sadr wants control of hostages
Iran's President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr met with rep
resentatives of the U.S. Embassy militants yesterday in an
apparent bid to persuade or pressure them into handing
their 50 American hostages over to Iranian government
control.
He was expected to announce Iran's next move at a
Tehran rally today celebrating the Iranian revolution.
White House press secretary Jody Powell, noting that a
major announcement is anticipated in Tehran, said Presi
dent Jimmy Carter would "make an appropriate statement
to the American people" afterward.
Carter conferred with national security ad\isers at the
White House about possible retaliatory measures against
Iran if the Tehran government does not move toward resol
ving the five-month-old hostage crisis. He also met with
congressional leaders.
The developments, following two secret messages sent by
Carter to Bani-Sadr in recent days, were the strongest sig
nals in weeks of an impending new turn in the confronta
tion.
The purported letter of apology from Carter to the
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, which a surprised White
House disavowed last weekend as soon as Iran published it.
was actually written by an Argentine lawyer acting as an
intermediary in the hostage crisis, administration officials
said yesterday.
Describing the gesture by the lawyer as "well-meaning,"
officials insisted that neither Carter nor his foreign policy
advisers had any knowledge of what was going on. ostensi
bly in Carter's name, until the text of the measure was read
over Tehran radio last Saturday.
Carter projects record budget surplus
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter sent Con
gress yesterday a totally revamped budget for the next fiscal
year and projected a record 516.5 billion surplus that he
said would help curb inflation.
The president claimed spending reductions of SI 7.2 bill
ion from the first budget he sent to Congress in January,
which had forecast a deficit of 515.8 billion for the 12
months starting Oct. 1.
If Congress goes along with Carter's plan, the nation
would have its first balanced budget since 1969 and the
largest surplus in its history. The previous record-high
surplus was SI2 billion in 1948.
"Hie president proposed spending of 5611.5 billion, just
54.3 billion less than his January budget, but he said that
revised estimates of inflation's impact on spending would
have sent the outlays soaring to $628.7 billion without the
cuts he made.
While most federal agencies suffered from fairly large
cutbacks in planned spending, the Department of Defense
emerged virtually unscathed. In fact. Pentagon outlays will
risefrom $146.2 billion to $150.5 billion in the 198 1 budget
year. Even so. there will be cuts in some defense procure
ment. including the A-7 and C-130 aircraft programs.
The bulk of the anticipated surplus would come from a
$12.6 billion oil import fee that the president imposed to
raise gasoline prices by 10 cents a gallon, effective May 15.
Without that action and another proposal to withhold
income taxes on interest and dividend payments. Carter's
budget would show only a razor-thin surplus of $500 mill
ion.
Shah's cancer spreads to liver
CAIRO — Laboratory tests show that lymphatic cancer
afflicting the shah of Iran has spread to his liver and also was
present in his spleen removed Friday night, according to
one of four doctors who performed the operation.
Dr. Fouad N'ur, head of the tumor section at Cairo's
Military Hospital, said in a telephone interview yesterday
that this was the meaning of a medical bulletin issued by the
hospital declaring that "lymphatic swelling" was discovered
in the shah's spleen and specimens of his liver removed
during the 80-minute surgery.
The American specialist who led the operating team. Dr.
Michael Deßakey of Houston. Tex., stopped short of label

ing the condition of the shah's liver as cancer, calling it
instead "lymphatic infiltration."
Whatever the terminology, the spread of the shah's dis
ease. histiocytic lymphoma, to his spleen and liver was
interpreted as a grave sign.
The ailing former monarch. 60. was treated last fall in
New York for what was called then cancer of the lymph
nodes in his neck, and his gall bladder was removed. The
pathological tests here now confirm that despite
chemotherapy, the malady is progressing through different
parts of his body.
N'ur said, however, that with medication the shah can
recover from his spleenectomy and return to a relatively
normal life for an undetermined time. The key to his longev
ity. he added, lies in arresting the spread of his cancer with
drugs. There is no question of removing his cancer-stricken
liver, he said.
Court cuts party patronage power
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yesterday shar
ply curbed the ability of American political parties to make
use of patronage, ruling that high-level professional
employees can't be fired from government jobs merely
because they lack the sponsorship of the party in power.
By a vote of 6 to 3. the court decided that a newly
appointed Democratic public defender in Rockland
County. N.Y., violated the First Amendment rights of two
assistant public defenders by firing them solely because they
were Republicans.
"Government funds, which are collected from taxpayers
of all parties on a non-political basis, cannot be expended
for the benefit of one political party simply because that
party has control of the government," Justice John Stevens
wrote for the court majority. "The compensation of gov
ernment employees, like the distribution of other public
benefits, must be justified by a governmental purpose."
The three dissenters — Justices Lewis Powell. William
Rehnquist and Potter Stewart — said the ruling would
weaken the effectiveness of the nation's political parties by
hampering their ability to reward the party faithful.
The court's decision (Branti vs. Finkel, 78-1654)
amounts to a broad extension of a 1976 ruling in which the
Supreme Court held that the practice of dismissals moti
vated by patronage may violate the First Amendment rights
of government employees by penalizing them for their pri
vate political beliefs.
Brezhnev receives literary award
MOSCOW — President Leonid Brezhnev, looking fit in
his first public appearance in four weeks, received his coun
try's highest literary award yesterday for his memoirs. In an
acceptance speech in which he seemed to stumble slightly,
the aging leader said "the facts of recent times require us to
keep our powder dry."
Top Soviet leaders attended the glittering, televised
Kremlin ceremony marking the formal awarding of the
Lenin Prize in literature.
Both Brezhnev, 73, and Soviet Premier Alexei Kosygin,
76. who also appeared at the ceremony, had prompted
renewed speculation about their health last week when they
failed to appear at the opening of the Parliament of the
Russian Federation, largest of the 15 provinces making up
the Soviet Union.
In his speech. Brezhnev said his wish was for his books
Little Land, Rebirth and Virgin Lands to be viewed as
memoirs. His main goal, he said, was to describe to new
generations of Soviet citizens "how the giant economic and
intellectual potential of the state was created."
The three books were published in 1978 and Brezhnev
actually was awarded the Lenin Prize on April 22, 1979.
The prestigious award carries a $1 5,200 prize, but this was
not mentioned in the Kremlin ceremony.
In response to welcoming words of praise from awards
committee chairman Georgy Markov, Brezhnev said, "As
you know, I am not a writer but a party functionary. But, as
every Communist, I consider myself mobilized by party
propaganda and see my duty in actively participating in the
work of our press."

Chinese speech criticizes U.S. life
PEKING — A secret speech distributed to youth leaders
here has sharply criticized the United States, debunked the
future of Sino-American relations and revealed the ambiva
lence Chinese leaders feel about their growing ties with
Washington.
A copy of the speech, distributed to Communist Youth
League members throughout Peking and obtained from
Chinese sources, described the United States as a greedy,
relentlessly imperialist country where a mother must pay to
eat at her son's home and where much wealth has been
exploited from Chinese labor.
The speaker, Qinghna University Vice President Zhang
Guangdou, warned a meeting of Youth League members
from Peking's several universities that "the American
people are good . . . but the American government and the
capitalists are imperialist. We don't want to entertain any
illusions. In one sense, what we are doing now is tactical —a
united struggle against hegemonism" — the Chinese code
word for the Soviet Union.
Since a wave of pro-American articles swept the Chinese
official press during the U.S. visit of Vice Chairman Deng
Xisoping last year, the Peking press has tried to redress the
balance by printing occasional articles criticizing American
life.
But none of the articles have called into question the
future of the Sino-American relations as Zhang's remarks
do, nor have they been so vehement in their criticism of
American society.
Jesse Owens dies of lung cancer
TUCSON, Ariz. — Jesse Owens, the black track star
whose four gold medals at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin
shattered Adolf Hitler's dreams of Aryan superiority, died
yesterday of lung cancer. He was 66.
Owens was a 22-year-old track and field star known as
the "Buckeye Bullet" when he galvanized the world at the
Olympic Games where the Nazi dictator hoped to de
monstrate his theory of racial supremacy.
"Perhaps no athlete better symbolized the human strug
gle against tyranny, poverty and racial bigotry" than
Owens, President Jimmy Carter said in a statement issued
in Washington.
"His personal triumphs as a world-class athlete and re
cordholder were the prelude to a career devoted to helping
others," Carter said.
Owens' illness was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, a lung

cancer that doctors said normally is linked with cigarette
smoking. He smoked an average of a pack of cigarettes a
day for 35 years.
The cancer was inoperable, so Owens came to Tucson in
January for treatment that included some experimental
drugs.
After the 1936 Games, Owens became the measure to
which other athletes were compared. As an amateur,
Owens set a total of 1 1 world records. It was four decades
before the last of those marks was erased.
N.Y. mass transit strike likely today
NEW YORK — New York's hundreds of thousands of
"straphangers" wondered what chaos the morning might
bring as negotiations went down to the wire last night in an
effort to head off the city's first transit strike in 14 years.
The people who climb aboard subways and buses 5.5
million times each day were trying to figure out how they
might get to work as the midnight deadline approached for
the strike by 35,000 transit workers.
The Long Island Rail Road, which boards 270,000 riders
each day, also was involved in negotiations to avoid a strike
at the same time.
A citywide transit shutdown was expected to cost the city
$140 million a day in various business losses, in addition
to the loss of the 5.5 million 50-cent fares daily.
For the commuters themselves, it meant trying to buy or
rent some means of getting to work, including bicycles,
roller skates and boats.
As talks continued yesterday evening, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority increased its wage offer from
lOV2 percent to 15 percent in three 5 percent steps over a
34-month period.
The MTA's original lOV2 percent offer, with three 3V2
percent raises over the life of the contract, would have cost
the city a total of $210 million.
Dow Jones climbs to solid 8.10 gain
NEW YORK — A late buying surge yesterday helped the
stock market post a solid gain for the second consecutive
session, continuing its rebound from lows last week.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, after
posting a fractional loss at midafternoon, climbed sharply in
the final 90 minutes to close with an 8.10 point gain at
785.75.
Oil and non-precious metal stocks were generally higher.
Some special situation stocks had big price movements.
