# Plans include windmills, solar heating
## New Storey House to be energy efficient 
### Jill Liscom Staff Writer 
The University announced yesterday
its plans for rebuilding Storey House
with a unique architectural design to
achieve maximum energy efficiency.
The architecture will include two
huge windmills attached to the roof of
the house to generate electricity in con
junction with solar hot water heaters
for additional energy. The new roof
will be made of glass to cover a solar
greenhouse to heat the house.
Director of Planning Philip Williams
said the plan should work well. "We've
got it all figured out — the solar heating
should provide sufficient energy supply
for most of the year, and when there is a
cloudy period we can still rely on the
windmills for electrical heat."
To further reduce energy needs, the
office of Residential Education has
ruled that no electrical appliances such
as refrigerators, televisions or blow
dryers will be allowed in resident's
rooms.
Opposition expected
Anticipating strong protest from fu
ture residents, Dean of Students Jim
Lyons stipulated that blow dryers, curl
ing sets and other small electrical
appliances could be operated in
specified areas of the house at specially
approved times only.
As for the residency of the house, the
Residential Education office has de
cided to change Storey into a co-ed
house. But to add diversity to the hous
ing system, the house will have a two
to-one ratio of women to men resi
dents. "It will be the sandwich effect,
similar to the Wilbur Hall residences,
only in reverse," commented Norm
Robinson, assistant dean of residential
education.
Row Director Diana Conklin said
she is pleased that there will be a last
innovation to the Row before his resig
nation at the end of this school year,
saying "it's about time the male stu
dents here were in a minority situation
— it ought to be a real switch for
them."
Others were dismayed at the an
nouncement of the new plans. Former
Storey residents were pleased to hear
that men would be living in the house,
but disappointed that the solar heaters
and windmills would eliminate the
prized sundeck.
"It's hard to imagine what Storey
will be like without being able to get a
good spring-quarter tan on our own

sundeck," commented one woman.
Sigma Chi residents offered to let
future women Storey residents share
their sunning roof, but also said they
were disappointed that the sundeck
would no longer exist.
"It'll just ruin our rooftop enter
tainment, now that we can't watch the
Storey girls sunbathing," commented
one Sigma Chi member. "We might as
well throw our binoculars away."
East Asian Studies angry
The East Asian Studies department,
however, was even more angry about
the decision to build an energy efficient
house instead of letting East Asian
Studies design the house according to
its proposal.
The department had been told it
would replace the French house next
year, but that decision was later over
turned by Lyons. The East Asian
Studies house supporters had been
hoping to be allowed to rebuild Storey

house with an East Asian design. They
had even contacted Ying Wang Sun, a
well-known landscapes to begin de
signs for a bronze pagoda replica, a
banzai tree garden, and a small stream
with an Oriental bridge to be installed
in the front yard.
Also, Yen Ten Sen, a famous
Chinese sculptor, had offered to do
nate plans for two large lion sculptures
to adorn the sides of the front door
stairway.
The East Asian Studies department
would have to raise funds to pay for the
materials and building of the lions, but
Peter Duus, director of the Center for
East Asian Studies, said it would be "no
problem" to raise the money. "Just
look at the success of the Albers Wall,"
he said.
Fire safety
University officials have answered
many of the complaints about the new
housing plans by saying they are stres

sing fire safety in the new house.
Robinson said that eliminating all elec
trical appliances in rooms will cut down
on the possibility of overloaded exten
sion cords becoming overheated.
The Row Office will also have closed
circuit television monitors installed
above each fire extinquisher in the
house for security. After the fire broke
out, there were numerous reports that
fire extinguishers had been stolen or
vandalized. "We're not taking any
more chances," said Conklin.
To help heat the living room and din
ing room during the winter, the Uni
versity will allow small fires in the fire
place on special occasions. And recog
nizing the strong sentimentality still as
sociated with the burned ruins of the
house, the University has instructed
construction workers to save all old
pieces of the original Storey house to
be burned in the fireplace for anniver
sary ritual celebrations.

above each fire extinquisher in the
house for security. After the fire broke
out, there were numerous reports that
fire extinguishers had been stolen or
vandalized. "We're not taking any
more chances," said Conklin.
To help heat the living room and din
ing room during the winter, the Uni
versity will allow small fires in the fire
place on special occasions. And recog
nizing the strong sentimentality still as
sociated with the burned ruins of the
house, the University has instructed
construction workers to save all old
pieces of the original Storey house to
be burned in the fireplace for anniver
sary ritual celebrations.


Artist's conception of the reconstructed Storey House.
The University announced yesterday
its plans for rebuilding Storey House
with a unique architectural design to
achieve maximum energy efficiency.
The architecture will include two
huge windmills attached to the roof of
the house to generate electricity in con
junction with solar hot water heaters
for additional energy. The new roof
will be made of glass to cover a solar
greenhouse to heat the house.
Director of Planning Philip Williams
said the plan should work well. "We've
got it all figured out — the solar heating
should provide sufficient energy supply
for most of the year, and when there is a
cloudy period we can still rely on the
windmills for electrical heat."
To further reduce energy needs, the
office of Residential Education has
ruled that no electrical appliances such
as refrigerators, televisions or blow
dryers will be allowed in resident's
rooms.
Opposition expected
Anticipating strong protest from fu
ture residents, Dean of Students Jim
Lyons stipulated that blow dryers, curl
ing sets and other small electrical
appliances could be operated in
specified areas of the house at specially
approved times only.
As for the residency of the house, the
Residential Education office has de
cided to change Storey into a co-ed
house. But to add diversity to the hous
ing system, the house will have a two
to-one ratio of women to men resi
dents. "It will be the sandwich effect,
similar to the Wilbur Hall residences,
only in reverse," commented Norm
Robinson, assistant dean of residential
education.
Row Director Diana Conklin said
she is pleased that there will be a last
innovation to the Row before his resig
nation at the end of this school year,
saying "it's about time the male stu
dents here were in a minority situation
— it ought to be a real switch for
them."
Others were dismayed at the an
nouncement of the new plans. Former
Storey residents were pleased to hear
that men would be living in the house,
but disappointed that the solar heaters
and windmills would eliminate the
prized sundeck.
"It's hard to imagine what Storey
will be like without being able to get a
good spring-quarter tan on our own

sundeck," commented one woman.
Sigma Chi residents offered to let
future women Storey residents share
their sunning roof, but also said they
were disappointed that the sundeck
would no longer exist.
"It'll just ruin our rooftop enter
tainment, now that we can't watch the
Storey girls sunbathing," commented
one Sigma Chi member. "We might as
well throw our binoculars away."
East Asian Studies angry
The East Asian Studies department,
however, was even more angry about
the decision to build an energy efficient
house instead of letting East Asian
Studies design the house according to
its proposal.
The department had been told it
would replace the French house next
year, but that decision was later over
turned by Lyons. The East Asian
Studies house supporters had been
hoping to be allowed to rebuild Storey

house with an East Asian design. They
had even contacted Ying Wang Sun, a
well-known landscapes to begin de
signs for a bronze pagoda replica, a
banzai tree garden, and a small stream
with an Oriental bridge to be installed
in the front yard.
Also, Yen Ten Sen, a famous
Chinese sculptor, had offered to do
nate plans for two large lion sculptures
to adorn the sides of the front door
stairway.
The East Asian Studies department
would have to raise funds to pay for the
materials and building of the lions, but
Peter Duus, director of the Center for
East Asian Studies, said it would be "no
problem" to raise the money. "Just
look at the success of the Albers Wall,"
he said.
Fire safety
University officials have answered
many of the complaints about the new
housing plans by saying they are stres

sing fire safety in the new house.
Robinson said that eliminating all elec
trical appliances in rooms will cut down
on the possibility of overloaded exten
sion cords becoming overheated.
The Row Office will also have closed
circuit television monitors installed
above each fire extinquisher in the
house for security. After the fire broke
out, there were numerous reports that
fire extinguishers had been stolen or
