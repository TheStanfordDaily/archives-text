# Philosopher Quine merges abstract and material beliefs
## 
### Jiri Weiss Staff Writer 
Willard Van Orman Ouine is
considered by many to be
America's most influential living
philosopher, but he is not well
known outside academia. His
style is not flashy, and he does
not try to cater to the public, as
was apparent from this year's
Immanual Kant Lectures on Sci
ence and Sensibilia he delivered
here at the beginning of Feb
ruary.
Ouine has attacked the tradi
tional view of meaning — the
meaning of language and
mathematics for example —
through an attack on the classical
distinction between analytic and
synthetic truths. The first kind
are said to be derivable from the
meaning of the terms alone in
dependent of experience ("All
bachelors are unmarried men" is
the trivial example usually gi
ven.) Synthetic truths are said to
rely on experience ("Whales are
the largest mammals" is an
example).
Ouine contends that this dis
tinction does not make any

sense. He views language as a
theory of the world and all the
truths about the world as depen
dent on it.
His position has some startling
implications. Mathematics,
which for the most part is
thought to be true regardless of
experience, looses its absolute
ness, as do sentences about our
immediate experience.
Any statement can be held
true no matter what is observed
provided that adjustments are
made elsewhere in our theory of
the world.
Vienna Circle member
Ouine was a member of the
Vienna Circle, the positivist
school of philosophy that cam
paigned against metaphysics —
against the notion that there
could be a world beyond the
world of science and common
sense, the material world.
Ouine's views have since
changed drastically. At the age
of 72, Ouine has come short of
calling his position "struc
turalism," a term he feels has
been spoiled by Claude Levi-
Strauss. He has come to ap

preciate the arbitrariness of re
ference in our theories about the
world. "You can preserve both
the evidence of a theory and its
predictions and the truth of all
sentences in the theory under a
permutation of the objects to
which the theory refers."
The confusion of isms is only
an attempt to distinguish his
philosophy from that of the
positivists who called themselves
materialists.
Pure positivism rejected
Ouine can no longer accept
purely physical objects because
he considers positivism a doubt
ful proposition in light of recent
developments in physics which
cast some doubt on the separate
identity of objects as we perceive
them. In deference to the
positivists, Ouine's ontology (the
science of being) includes
abstract entities such as numbers
and classes. Ouine accuses the
positivists of doubletalk on this
subject. "They did not consider
numbers real; they were saying
that abstract objects were mere
devices; they were just crossing
their fingers."

Physicalism has another im
portant meaning for Ouine. It is
"taking the physical side of the
mind-matter dualism." Quine
believes, in accord with most
empiricists, that what we call
mental events can be explained
as neural events, as states of
nerves.
Symptoms count
It is true, admits Ouine, that
we may never be able to give a
neurological basis for some
abstract belief, but this is no evi
dence against physicalism. For
Ouine these mental states are
known to us only by their
symptoms, as are many diseases.
"Because the bacterium or
virus has not been isolated does
not mean that a doctor cannot
diagnose the disease by the
symptoms. An important part of
the diagnosis is the patient's own
reports of how he feels. The
same is true for mental states; it
is hard to talk about them with
out talking about verbal re
ports."
How does he as a physicalist
grasp abstract objects? "I as
sume not only physical objects,

including the elementary parti
cles as well as the big ones, but
also classes and classes of classes,
which is in my view like assuming
electrons or quarks. It is a matter
of filling out a theory and getting
a working and integrated one
which can manage to cover all
the observations. To do this one
needs objects which one does not
see to smooth out the theory.
"It is analogous to what hap
pens in arithmetic. If we have
whole numbers, positive num
bers to begin with and zero,
that's fine. You can multiply and
add those as much as you like
and you always get new ones, but
you can't always divide and sub
tract. Well, you throw in nega
tive numbers; now you can al
ways subtract. But then you
throw in fractions; now you can
always divide, but there is still
trouble when it comes to taking
fractional powers, and so you get
irrational numbers. If you think,
just for analogy, of the positive
integers and zero as being real or
observed, so to speak, and the
rest of these as being posited to
smooth the theory, this is the

same as the way one posits elec
trons, neutrons or quarks."
Reality of mathematics
So is mathematics of our own
creation?
"Well physics is too, in that
same sense. There is a notion
that mathematics and logic is
much more of our own creation
than physics. 1 don't agree with
this. I don't know of any such line
between mathematics and the
theoretical end of physics be
cause I am assuming not only the
various elementary particles of
physics but also numbers and
classes as further objects, al
though they are not physical ob
jects — it is in this sense that my
theory is qualified physicalism.
Can we change mathematics
as we change the laws of physics
when a new theory comes along?
"The truths of mathematics are a
part of the whole system of the
world. Then we make some un
expected observation, and we
find that we have to change our
system of the world somewhere
at some point. We have lots of
choices as to what to tamper
with. It is good strategy not to

tamper with logic or mathema
tics because these are used in so
many areas that it is going to dis
rupt things beyond necessity.
"So the strategy is to tamper
with parts that do not have such
wide ramifications; this is what I
call the firmness or necessity of
mathematical knowledge. Even
so some quantum physicists haye
gone so far as to suggest a mod
ification to logic. I do not say that
this is out of the question. What
one is to consider is to have the
simplest possible system overall.
Since Ouine is a physicalist
and also believes in determinism,
does he believe in free will?
Freedom of action is for Ouine
not "a lapse of causal deter
minism," it is simply the causal
chain that leads to a particular
event passing through our voli
tion. If an action "bypasses" the
will, if somebody is pushed, for
example, that is not an action of
free will. But if I choose to do
something, that is free will.
This seems like the common
notion of freedom at first sight,
but this notion is qualified by
Ouine. "The reason why it does
not conflict with determinism is
that the will is a link in the causal
chain in the free cases and not in
others."
Quine thinks that we can have
determinism and free will at the
same time. "The will is deter
mined, but what we do or will is
free action, and we can admire
good voluntary actions and con
demn others in the same way in
which we admire a fine painting
or disapprove of a bad one with
out ever thinking that they ever
came about spontaneously to
existence, without causal con
nections behind them."

the largest mammals" is an

tinction does not make any

sense. He views language as a
theory of the world and all the
truths about the world as depen
dent on it.
His position has some startling
implications. Mathematics,
which for the most part is

experience, looses its absolute
ness, as do sentences about our
immediate experience.
Any statement can be held
true no matter what is observed

Vienna Circle member
Ouine was a member of the
Vienna Circle, the positivist
school of philosophy that cam
paigned against metaphysics —
against the notion that there
could be a world beyond the
world of science and common
sense, the material world.
Ouine's views have since
changed drastically. At the age
of 72, Ouine has come short of
calling his position "struc
turalism," a term he feels has
been spoiled by Claude Levi-
Strauss. He has come to ap

preciate the arbitrariness of re
ference in our theories about the
world. "You can preserve both
the evidence of a theory and its
predictions and the truth of all
sentences in the theory under a
permutation of the objects to
which the theory refers."
The confusion of isms is only
an attempt to distinguish his
philosophy from that of the
positivists who called themselves
materialists.
Pure positivism rejected
Ouine can no longer accept
purely physical objects because
he considers positivism a doubt
ful proposition in light of recent
developments in physics which
cast some doubt on the separate
identity of objects as we perceive
them. In deference to the
positivists, Ouine's ontology (the
science of being) includes
abstract entities such as numbers
and classes. Ouine accuses the
positivists of doubletalk on this
subject. "They did not consider
numbers real; they were saying
that abstract objects were mere
devices; they were just crossing
their fingers."

Physicalism has another im
portant meaning for Ouine. It is
"taking the physical side of the
mind-matter dualism." Quine
believes, in accord with most
empiricists, that what we call
mental events can be explained
as neural events, as states of
nerves.
Symptoms count
It is true, admits Ouine, that
we may never be able to give a
neurological basis for some
abstract belief, but this is no evi
dence against physicalism. For
Ouine these mental states are
known to us only by their
symptoms, as are many diseases.
"Because the bacterium or
virus has not been isolated does
not mean that a doctor cannot
diagnose the disease by the
symptoms. An important part of
the diagnosis is the patient's own
reports of how he feels. The
same is true for mental states; it
is hard to talk about them with
out talking about verbal re
ports."
How does he as a physicalist
grasp abstract objects? "I as
sume not only physical objects,

including the elementary parti
cles as well as the big ones, but
also classes and classes of classes,
which is in my view like assuming
electrons or quarks. It is a matter
of filling out a theory and getting
a working and integrated one
which can manage to cover all
the observations. To do this one
needs objects which one does not
see to smooth out the theory.
"It is analogous to what hap
pens in arithmetic. If we have
whole numbers, positive num
bers to begin with and zero,
that's fine. You can multiply and
add those as much as you like
and you always get new ones, but
you can't always divide and sub
tract. Well, you throw in nega
tive numbers; now you can al
ways subtract. But then you
throw in fractions; now you can
always divide, but there is still
trouble when it comes to taking
fractional powers, and so you get
irrational numbers. If you think,
just for analogy, of the positive
integers and zero as being real or
observed, so to speak, and the
rest of these as being posited to
smooth the theory, this is the

same as the way one posits elec
trons, neutrons or quarks."
Reality of mathematics
So is mathematics of our own
creation?
"Well physics is too, in that
same sense. There is a notion
that mathematics and logic is
much more of our own creation
than physics. 1 don't agree with
this. I don't know of any such line
between mathematics and the
theoretical end of physics be
cause I am assuming not only the
various elementary particles of
physics but also numbers and
classes as further objects, al
though they are not physical ob
jects — it is in this sense that my
theory is qualified physicalism.
Can we change mathematics
as we change the laws of physics
when a new theory comes along?
"The truths of mathematics are a
part of the whole system of the
world. Then we make some un
expected observation, and we
find that we have to change our
system of the world somewhere
at some point. We have lots of
choices as to what to tamper
with. It is good strategy not to

tamper with logic or mathema
tics because these are used in so
many areas that it is going to dis
rupt things beyond necessity.
"So the strategy is to tamper
with parts that do not have such
wide ramifications; this is what I
call the firmness or necessity of
mathematical knowledge. Even
so some quantum physicists haye
gone so far as to suggest a mod
ification to logic. I do not say that
this is out of the question. What
one is to consider is to have the
simplest possible system overall.
Since Ouine is a physicalist
and also believes in determinism,
does he believe in free will?
Freedom of action is for Ouine
not "a lapse of causal deter
minism," it is simply the causal
chain that leads to a particular
event passing through our voli
tion. If an action "bypasses" the
will, if somebody is pushed, for
example, that is not an action of
free will. But if I choose to do
something, that is free will.
This seems like the common
notion of freedom at first sight,
but this notion is qualified by
Ouine. "The reason why it does
not conflict with determinism is
that the will is a link in the causal
chain in the free cases and not in
others."
Quine thinks that we can have
determinism and free will at the
same time. "The will is deter
mined, but what we do or will is
free action, and we can admire
good voluntary actions and con
demn others in the same way in
which we admire a fine painting
or disapprove of a bad one with
out ever thinking that they ever
came about spontaneously to
existence, without causal con
nections behind them."
Willard Van Orman Ouine is
considered by many to be
America's most influential living
philosopher, but he is not well
known outside academia. His
style is not flashy, and he does
not try to cater to the public, as
was apparent from this year's
Immanual Kant Lectures on Sci
ence and Sensibilia he delivered
here at the beginning of Feb
ruary.
Ouine has attacked the tradi
tional view of meaning — the
meaning of language and
mathematics for example —
through an attack on the classical
distinction between analytic and
synthetic truths. The first kind
are said to be derivable from the
meaning of the terms alone in

Ouine's views have since
changed drastically. At the age
of 72, Ouine has come short of
calling his position "struc
turalism," a term he feels has
been spoiled by Claude Levi-
Strauss. He has come to ap

preciate the arbitrariness of re
ference in our theories about the
world. "You can preserve both
the evidence of a theory and its
predictions and the truth of all
sentences in the theory under a
permutation of the objects to
which the theory refers."
The confusion of isms is only
an attempt to distinguish his
philosophy from that of the
positivists who called themselves
materialists.
Pure positivism rejected
Ouine can no longer accept
purely physical objects because
he considers positivism a doubt
ful proposition in light of recent
developments in physics which
cast some doubt on the separate
identity of objects as we perceive
them. In deference to the
positivists, Ouine's ontology (the
science of being) includes
abstract entities such as numbers
and classes. Ouine accuses the
positivists of doubletalk on this
subject. "They did not consider
numbers real; they were saying
that abstract objects were mere
devices; they were just crossing
their fingers."

Physicalism has another im
portant meaning for Ouine. It is
"taking the physical side of the
mind-matter dualism." Quine
believes, in accord with most
empiricists, that what we call
mental events can be explained
as neural events, as states of
nerves.
Symptoms count
It is true, admits Ouine, that
we may never be able to give a
neurological basis for some
abstract belief, but this is no evi
dence against physicalism. For
Ouine these mental states are
known to us only by their
symptoms, as are many diseases.
"Because the bacterium or
virus has not been isolated does
not mean that a doctor cannot
diagnose the disease by the
symptoms. An important part of
the diagnosis is the patient's own
reports of how he feels. The
same is true for mental states; it
is hard to talk about them with
out talking about verbal re
ports."
How does he as a physicalist
grasp abstract objects? "I as
sume not only physical objects,

including the elementary parti
cles as well as the big ones, but
also classes and classes of classes,
which is in my view like assuming
electrons or quarks. It is a matter
of filling out a theory and getting
a working and integrated one
which can manage to cover all
the observations. To do this one
needs objects which one does not
see to smooth out the theory.
"It is analogous to what hap
pens in arithmetic. If we have
whole numbers, positive num
bers to begin with and zero,
that's fine. You can multiply and
add those as much as you like
and you always get new ones, but
you can't always divide and sub
tract. Well, you throw in nega
tive numbers; now you can al
ways subtract. But then you
throw in fractions; now you can
always divide, but there is still
trouble when it comes to taking
fractional powers, and so you get
irrational numbers. If you think,
just for analogy, of the positive
integers and zero as being real or
observed, so to speak, and the
rest of these as being posited to
smooth the theory, this is the

same as the way one posits elec
trons, neutrons or quarks."
Reality of mathematics
So is mathematics of our own
creation?
"Well physics is too, in that
same sense. There is a notion
that mathematics and logic is
much more of our own creation
than physics. 1 don't agree with
this. I don't know of any such line
between mathematics and the
theoretical end of physics be
cause I am assuming not only the
various elementary particles of
physics but also numbers and
classes as further objects, al
though they are not physical ob
jects — it is in this sense that my
theory is qualified physicalism.
Can we change mathematics
as we change the laws of physics
when a new theory comes along?
"The truths of mathematics are a
part of the whole system of the
world. Then we make some un
expected observation, and we
find that we have to change our
system of the world somewhere
at some point. We have lots of
choices as to what to tamper
with. It is good strategy not to

tamper with logic or mathema
tics because these are used in so
many areas that it is going to dis
rupt things beyond necessity.
"So the strategy is to tamper
with parts that do not have such
wide ramifications; this is what I
call the firmness or necessity of
mathematical knowledge. Even
so some quantum physicists haye
gone so far as to suggest a mod
ification to logic. I do not say that
this is out of the question. What
one is to consider is to have the
simplest possible system overall.
Since Ouine is a physicalist
and also believes in determinism,
does he believe in free will?
Freedom of action is for Ouine
not "a lapse of causal deter
minism," it is simply the causal
chain that leads to a particular
event passing through our voli
tion. If an action "bypasses" the
will, if somebody is pushed, for
example, that is not an action of
free will. But if I choose to do
something, that is free will.
This seems like the common
notion of freedom at first sight,
but this notion is qualified by
Ouine. "The reason why it does
not conflict with determinism is
that the will is a link in the causal
chain in the free cases and not in
others."
Quine thinks that we can have
determinism and free will at the
same time. "The will is deter
mined, but what we do or will is
free action, and we can admire
good voluntary actions and con
demn others in the same way in
which we admire a fine painting
or disapprove of a bad one with
out ever thinking that they ever
came about spontaneously to
existence, without causal con
nections behind them."
