# Prop. 9 could chop $700,000 off financial aid fund
##

Passage of Proposition 9 this June could have a multi
million-dollar impact on the University if cutbacks in state
programs are as large as current projections indicate.
In addition, several intangible effects of the so-called
Jarvis II tax-cutting measure could severely affect the Uni
versity, according to administrators.
Proponents of Jarvis 11, however, claim University esti
mates of the impact here are "exaggerated."
The Jarvis 11 proposal would cut state income tax rates by
50 percent. The measure would take effect July 1 if ap
proved by voters in the June primary election.
Cutbacks in state scholarship funding would have the
broadest impact here, officials say. Approximately 18 per
cent of undergraduates here — or about 1000 students —
receive roughly $2 million annually from the state scholar
ship program.
Cutbacks of up to 30 percent in the scholarship program
are expected if Jarvis II is passed, which would cause a
$700,000 shortfall in University financial aid next year
according to Vice Provost for Budget and Planning
Raymond Bacchetti.
Bacchetti said the University has a policy of meeting all
demonstrated financial needs of undergraduates, so no stu
dents would lose scholarship money. But instead of coming
from the state, the money would be drawn from University

general funds. Thus, the $700,000 would have to be found
elsewhere in the operating budget.
Jarvis IPs passage would also mean lower reimburse
ments to Stanford Hospital under the Medi-Cal Program.
Currently the University receives $14 million annually in
Medical reimbursements, according to Robert Freelen, as
sociate vice president for public affairs.
Freelen said his office is expecting a 5 to 10 percent
cutback in the Med-Cal program if Jarvis II is passed. That
cutback translates into a loss of between $700,000 and $1.4
million, he said.
Another indirect financial effect would involve increased
cost of the University's tuition remission program for fa
culty and staff.
Under the program, the children of eligible faculty and
staff, as a benefit of their parents' employment, receive
tuition and fees to attend college equal to an amount up to
50 percent of Stanford tuition.
Currently some 675 students receive tuition remission
grants, according to Jeanette Brolan, benefits records
supervisor here. Brolan said 313 of those students attend
California State institutions. Costs at those schools are cur
rently $750 per student per year, but passage of Jarvis II
could mean an increase in tuition at all state schools.
The magnitude of possible budget cuts in unclear, but
"tuition could go as high as $3000," at UC-Berkeley, ac
cording to Joanne Hurley, coordinator of federal govern

ment relations at Cal. That figure would be the maximum
cost assuming a 30 percent UC budget cut, Hurley said.
If tuition were to rise from $750 to $3000 next year, the
incremental $2250 for 3 13 students would cost the Univer
sity an additional $700,000, a sum which Brolan said
"shoots my budget all to the devil."
But beyond the financial impact, University officials
worry aloud about more intangible effects.
Provost Donald Kennedy recently said anything which
weakens the University of California weakens Stanford.
Larry Horton, University director of government rela
tions, said that having a strong academic environment in the
Bay area helps the University.
The faculty here consults and cooperates with the faculty
at Berkeley, Horton said. UC and Stanford cooperate on
several projects including library support and some re
search. Also, having a strong UC campus across the Bay aids
in faculty recruitment because it helps create a strong
academic environment.
"Anything which might affect the strength of the Univer
sity of California may well hurt us in the long run." Horton
said.
Another less tangible consideration involves the quality
of local public schools.
Bacchetti said the high quality of Palo Alto public schools
has been a substantial benefit to the University in its faculty
and staff recruitment efforts.

"People at Stanford are concerned about education, so it
is very nice for faculty and staff considering an appointment
to the University to know the public schools are the best
available," Bacchetti said.
Bacchetti, a member of the Palo Alto Unified School
District Board, said the impact on local schools would be
substantial with the passage of Jarvis II because the district
derives 60 percent of its revenues from the state. He added
that local school districts have little power to tax, so local
taxes cannot replace lost state revenues.
However, proponents of Jarvis II do not believe the
impact of the state budget will be so severe.
Harvey Englander, statewide campaign manager for
"Yes on Proposition 9," said claims of drastic cutbacks in
state spending are "hysterical, exaggerated and mislead
ing."
He said that while income tax rates will be cut 50 percent,
this money will not be totally lost to the state.
Englander said people would spend their tax savings
creating additional sales tax revenues. In addition, in
creased consumer demand would result in generally in
creased economic activity, meaning more people would be
employed and thus more people would pay taxes.
Englander added that the state will realize substantial
increases in tax receipts from oil drilling in the state as oil
decontrol takes place over the next few years.
