Peace Corps and VISTA Volunteers are people pretty much like you. People with commitment and
skills who have decided there must be more to life than just holding down a job.
The problems that our volunteers deal with both overseas and here at home aren t new. Such as the
cycle of poverty that traps one generation after another because they're too busy holding on to get ahead
The debilitating effects of malnutrition and disease. Education and skills that are lacking, and the means to
get them, too.
Former Volunteers will tell you that long hours and frustration come with the job, but that the satis
faction and rewards are immense. For many it has been the central event of their lives, with experiences
and new perspectives that few of them expected. As one Volunteer to Africa stated: "Don't expect to
change the world. The Peace Corps experience will change your world." The same is true for VISTA,
where you'll discover that social change on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged is not only possible, but
essential, and that you can be a part of the process.
We are now accepting applications for several thousand one- and two-year volunteer positions that
begin in the next 12 months in 65 overseas countries and throughout the U.S. Our representatives will be
pleased to discuss the opportunities with you.
