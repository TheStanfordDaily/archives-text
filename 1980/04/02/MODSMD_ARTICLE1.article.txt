MILWAUKEE — President Jimmy Carter
scored a double victory last night in the Wis
consin and Kansas primaries that halted the
week-old rally in Sen. Edward Kennedy's for
tunes and drove California Gov. Edmund
Brown Jr. out of the race for the Democratic
nomination.
Ronald Reagan survived an unprecedented
large crossover of Democratic voters into Wis
consin's Republican primary yesterday and
further strengthened his claim on the GOP
presidential nomination with a landslide vic
tory in Kansas.
The former California governor's Wisconsin
victory dealt a serious blow to the presidential
hopes of Rep. John Anderson(R-Ill.), the Re
publican apostle of "new politics" who had
tried to build a coalition of independents, disil
lusioned Democrats and liberal Republicans
here.
In early returns, Anderson was locked in a

tight race for second place with former Central
Intelligence Agency director George Bush.
Both trailed Reagan by more than 3 to 1 in
Kansas.
In bouncing back strongly from last week's
twin losses to Kennedy in New York and Con
necticut, Carter further strengthened his claim
to renomination at the Democratic convention.
His campaign chairman, Robert Strauss, said
the day's results "nailed down with some cer
tainty the eventual outcome."
With 69 percent of the precincts in Wiscon
sin reporting, Carter led with 55 percent, for4B
delegates, Kennedy had 30 percent for 26 de
legates, and Brown 13 percent, for his first
delegate of the campaign. With 97 percent re
porting in Kansas, Carter had 56 percent for 23
delegates, Kennedy 31 percent for 14 dele
gates, and Brown 5 percent.
Brown, who had gambled all his available
resources on Wisconsin, told supporters here
that "this will be the last contest in which I will

participate in 1980." Facing a cutoff of federal
matching funds next week. Brown said "it is
obvious the voters have. . . given the verdict on
my 1980 campaign ... It is difficult to look at
reality and accept it as it is," he said, "but it is
also a liberating thing."
Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen
Smith, conceded the two primaries to Carter,
then added, "I think we will have a strong win"
in the April 22 Pennsylvania primary.
Kennedy defeated Carter last Tuesday in
New York and Connecticut, but an Associated
Press-NBC News poll in Wisconsin showed the
trend had turned the president's way among
voters who made their decisions at the last
minute.
Among the 22 percent of the Democratic
voters who said they made up their minds in the
past two days, when Iran was dominating the
news, Carter got 46 percent of the support,
Kennedy 35 percent, and Brown 18 percent.
That reversed the pattern of most earlier

primaries, which saw the late-deciders break to
Kennedy.
It appeared that Carter had gained votes
with his election-day report of possible prog
ress toward freedom for the 50 American hos
tages held in Tehran.
What was impressive about Carter's victory
in Wisconsin was the strength of his support
among all categories of voters. ABC News exit
polls showed him beating Kennedy among
Catholic and Protestant voters, union and
non-union families, carrying rural areas, small
towns, suburbs and cities. He beat Kennedy
badly among moderate and conservative vot
ers, and was sandwiched between Kennedy and
Brown in a 39-33-27 percent split of the liberal
Democrats.
On the Republican side. Anderson gained
the normally independent and Democratic
voters he sought to buoy his showing in the
open Wisconsin primary —but Reagan gained
crossover support, too, from conservative

Democrats.
With 69 percent of the Wisconsin vote
counted, Reagan had 39 percent for 25 dele
gates, Bush 3 percent, for three delegates and
Anderson 29 percent, for three delegates.
In a dramatic reversal of past patterns, three
of every five Wisconsin voters cast ballots in
the GOP primary. Four years ago, 54 percent
of the state's 1.3 million ballots were cast on
the Democratic side.
Anderson was capturing 44 percent of the
Democratic crossover vote compared to 31
percent for Bush and 23 percent for Reagan.
And Anderson was the beneficiary of two
thirds of the liberal vote.
According to network exit polls, Reagan ran
strong in Wisconsin's small cities, rural areas
and suburbs, and among Slavic groups. He beat
Anderson and Bush by almost two to one
among blue-collar workers, and he collected
about 50 percent of the conservative vote to
one-third for Bush. Anderson got 17 percent.
