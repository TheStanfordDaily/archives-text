# High interest stifles home buying
## 
### John A. Jones The Los Angeles Times 
In the good old days — like a year ago,
when mortgage loans were at 11 percent — a
family making $30,000 a year could afford to
buy an $82,000 house. Now that interest
rates have exceeded 1 7 percent, the experts
say the same family can afford a house cost
ing no more than $55,000. In each case, as
suming a 20 percent down payment, the
monthly mortgage payments work out to
$625.
It's a Catch-22 situation. In California, at
least, barely 3 percent of the homes are
priced that low, and the median price of an
existing home is now $93,603. In Los
Angeles, the figure is $115,000.
It's no surprise, therefore, that fewer
families are buying houses these days, or sel
ling them. And those forced by a job switch
or other circumstances to make a move at
this unfortunate moment often face some se
vere hardships.
What is surprising is the number of ingeni
ous ways buyers and sellers are finding to
avoid those prohibitive interest rates and
make some sales possible. If the savings and
loan won't charge less than 17 percent, the
homeowner trying to sell sometimes can.
Unusual financing deals are proliferating
all across the country. But a Los Angeles
Times survey of housing industry officials in
major U.S. cities find that a serious housing
slump is under way, nevertheless. According
to the National Association of Realtors, sales
of homes nationally had dropped 25 percent
from a year ago over the winter. Now the
declines are worsening and prospects for new
home building this spring are grim.
In California real estate agents say that
home sales have fallen between 10 percent
and 30 percent from the year-ago pace. They
expect the picture to worsen before it gets
better. As it is, it takes about three times as
long to sell a house (an average of nearly 90
days) as it did last year.
What's all this doing to housing prices?
Apparently not much — so far. Except in
Chicago, where housing has been soft for
some time, prices are holding fairly well. It
still costs considerably more to buy a house in
California than it did a year ago — 27.4
percent more, according to the California
Association of Realtors. The average sale
price in Houston, however, has edged off
about $2000 in the last year, according to
Nancy Sartain, a Houston realtor. The

sales decline is recent enough that it remains
to he seen how well prices hold this spring
and summer. But many experts are more
concerned that future housing inflation will
he worse even than that of the recent past
because so little home building is likely this
year.
Builders are turning to unorthodox financ
ing methods as potential buyers fade away
from new tract homes.
Bruno Pasquinelli, a major Chicago buil
der, is handling short-term financing himself
to sell houses from his inventory. He sells on
contract, with the understanding that the
buyer can convert to a conventional
mortgage within three to five years.
In New York City, only the larger com
mercial banks are providing mortgages, and
most savings banks are not lending at all.
When money is available, even well-heeled
customers balk at the price.
These days a low mortgage rate is an offer
than can hardly be refused. Georgia-Pacific
Corp., the giant timber company, will move
its headquarters from Portland, Ore., to At
lanta in 1982. The firm expects only about
half of its headquarters work force of 400 to
move to Atlanta, but it is trying hard to en
courage more employees to do so.
Georgia-Pacific recently announced that it
will underwrite home loans for its employees
moving to Atlanta at a bargain rate — only
B</ 2 percent.
For others forced to move, the high con
ventional interest rates, plus one-time loan
fees of as much as 3 percent of the amount of
the loan, are forcing would-be buyers and
sellers to be creative. Deals are being
"stitched, pasted and glued together," re
marked Bruce Nowell, senior vice president
of Western Federal Savings & Loan in De
nver.
The trick is to come up with a down pay
ment large enough to cover the difference
between the old, partly paid-off mortgage
and the current, inflated price of the house.
If a buyer can find the cash or borrow it
through a second trust deed loan, it's simple.
Court decisions in California in the last few
years have prevented most lenders from re
fusing to let a loan be assumed by a new
buyer whose credit is good. In some other
states, however, the takeover deal may be
hidden from a lender who would have the
legal right to stop it.
The seller may continue making the origi
nal loan payments, while the buyer pays the
seller, but title still is transferred to the

buyer. Lenders in those states try to keep
track of such deals by checking transfers of
title insurance, said Kenneth Kcrin, vice
president for research at the National As
sociation of Realtors, based in Chicago.
To escape detection, buyers have simply
added their names to the sellers' insurance
policies instead of getting new insurance.
The most common plan is something cal
led an all-inclusive trust deed (AITD). Here
the seller makes a second trust deed and
wraps it up with the original mortgage debt,
to provide a new loan to the buyer at a
below-market interest rate.
For example, the buyer of an $80,000
home makes a cash down payment of
$15,000 and there is an existing first
mortgage loan of $50,000, leaving a $15,000
gap. The seller agrees to finance the $15,000,
but does it by making a total loan of $65,000
(the original $50,000 mortgage plus the new
$15,000 debt) to the borrower.
The rate on the original $50,000 loan is 9.5
percent, and the payments are $425.60 a
month for principal and interest.
The seller makes the $65,000 loan at 14
percent, which is 3 percentage points below
the current market rate of 17 percent. That is
obviously a good deal for the buyer, who
saves almost $150 a month by getting a lower
rate. But the seller gains, too.
The seller collects $770.17 a month on the
new loan, amortized over 30 years, but still
pays only $425.60 a month to keep up the
original loan, thereby collecting nearly $345
a month on this do-it-yourself banking ven
ture.
In some cases, individuals with cash to in
vest are able to finance a real estate loan
when banks won't do it.
Some real estate brokers have made a spe
cialty of putting creative deals together —
but they advise their clients to consult a
lawyer before undertaking the more ad
vanced versions.
One popular plan is a land contract sale.
The seller keeps title to the house until the
buyer has paid off the balance on the original
loan, plus a down payment. Usually the deal
calls for a very large payment to clear up all
the debt after three to five years — a so
called "balloon" payment. By then, it is
hoped, the deal can be refinanced through
regular channels at a lower rate.
Individual sellers usually charge lower in
terest than banks or savings and loans, but in
many states they are limited by usury laws.

and 30 percent from the year-ago pace. They
expect the picture to worsen before it gets
better. As it is, it takes about three times as
long to sell a house (an average of nearly 90
days) as it did last year.
What's all this doing to housing prices?
Apparently not much — so far. Except in
Chicago, where housing has been soft for
some time, prices are holding fairly well. It
still costs considerably more to buy a house in
California than it did a year ago — 27.4
percent more, according to the California
Association of Realtors. The average sale
price in Houston, however, has edged off
about $2000 in the last year, according to
Nancy Sartain, a Houston realtor. The

sales decline is recent enough that it remains
to he seen how well prices hold this spring
and summer. But many experts are more
concerned that future housing inflation will
he worse even than that of the recent past
because so little home building is likely this
year.
Builders are turning to unorthodox financ
ing methods as potential buyers fade away
from new tract homes.
Bruno Pasquinelli, a major Chicago buil
der, is handling short-term financing himself
to sell houses from his inventory. He sells on
contract, with the understanding that the
buyer can convert to a conventional
mortgage within three to five years.
In New York City, only the larger com
mercial banks are providing mortgages, and
most savings banks are not lending at all.
When money is available, even well-heeled
customers balk at the price.
These days a low mortgage rate is an offer
than can hardly be refused. Georgia-Pacific
Corp., the giant timber company, will move
its headquarters from Portland, Ore., to At
lanta in 1982. The firm expects only about
half of its headquarters work force of 400 to
move to Atlanta, but it is trying hard to en
courage more employees to do so.
Georgia-Pacific recently announced that it
will underwrite home loans for its employees
moving to Atlanta at a bargain rate — only
B</ 2 percent.
For others forced to move, the high con
ventional interest rates, plus one-time loan
fees of as much as 3 percent of the amount of
the loan, are forcing would-be buyers and
sellers to be creative. Deals are being
"stitched, pasted and glued together," re
marked Bruce Nowell, senior vice president
of Western Federal Savings & Loan in De
nver.
The trick is to come up with a down pay
ment large enough to cover the difference
between the old, partly paid-off mortgage
and the current, inflated price of the house.
If a buyer can find the cash or borrow it
through a second trust deed loan, it's simple.
Court decisions in California in the last few
years have prevented most lenders from re
fusing to let a loan be assumed by a new
buyer whose credit is good. In some other
states, however, the takeover deal may be
hidden from a lender who would have the
legal right to stop it.
The seller may continue making the origi
nal loan payments, while the buyer pays the
seller, but title still is transferred to the

buyer. Lenders in those states try to keep
track of such deals by checking transfers of
title insurance, said Kenneth Kcrin, vice
president for research at the National As
sociation of Realtors, based in Chicago.
To escape detection, buyers have simply
added their names to the sellers' insurance
policies instead of getting new insurance.
The most common plan is something cal
led an all-inclusive trust deed (AITD). Here
the seller makes a second trust deed and
wraps it up with the original mortgage debt,
to provide a new loan to the buyer at a
below-market interest rate.
For example, the buyer of an $80,000
home makes a cash down payment of
$15,000 and there is an existing first
mortgage loan of $50,000, leaving a $15,000
gap. The seller agrees to finance the $15,000,
but does it by making a total loan of $65,000
(the original $50,000 mortgage plus the new
$15,000 debt) to the borrower.
The rate on the original $50,000 loan is 9.5
percent, and the payments are $425.60 a
month for principal and interest.
The seller makes the $65,000 loan at 14
percent, which is 3 percentage points below
the current market rate of 17 percent. That is
obviously a good deal for the buyer, who
saves almost $150 a month by getting a lower
rate. But the seller gains, too.
The seller collects $770.17 a month on the
new loan, amortized over 30 years, but still
pays only $425.60 a month to keep up the
original loan, thereby collecting nearly $345
a month on this do-it-yourself banking ven
ture.
In some cases, individuals with cash to in
vest are able to finance a real estate loan
when banks won't do it.
Some real estate brokers have made a spe
cialty of putting creative deals together —
but they advise their clients to consult a
lawyer before undertaking the more ad
vanced versions.
One popular plan is a land contract sale.
The seller keeps title to the house until the
buyer has paid off the balance on the original
loan, plus a down payment. Usually the deal
calls for a very large payment to clear up all
the debt after three to five years — a so
called "balloon" payment. By then, it is
hoped, the deal can be refinanced through
regular channels at a lower rate.
Individual sellers usually charge lower in
terest than banks or savings and loans, but in
many states they are limited by usury laws.
In the good old days — like a year ago,
when mortgage loans were at 11 percent — a
family making $30,000 a year could afford to
buy an $82,000 house. Now that interest
rates have exceeded 1 7 percent, the experts
say the same family can afford a house cost
ing no more than $55,000. In each case, as
suming a 20 percent down payment, the
monthly mortgage payments work out to
$625.
It's a Catch-22 situation. In California, at
least, barely 3 percent of the homes are
priced that low, and the median price of an
existing home is now $93,603. In Los
Angeles, the figure is $115,000.
It's no surprise, therefore, that fewer
families are buying houses these days, or sel
ling them. And those forced by a job switch
or other circumstances to make a move at
this unfortunate moment often face some se
vere hardships.
What is surprising is the number of ingeni
ous ways buyers and sellers are finding to
avoid those prohibitive interest rates and
make some sales possible. If the savings and
loan won't charge less than 17 percent, the
homeowner trying to sell sometimes can.
Unusual financing deals are proliferating
all across the country. But a Los Angeles
Times survey of housing industry officials in
major U.S. cities find that a serious housing
slump is under way, nevertheless. According
to the National Association of Realtors, sales
of homes nationally had dropped 25 percent
from a year ago over the winter. Now the
declines are worsening and prospects for new
home building this spring are grim.

half of its headquarters work force of 400 to
move to Atlanta, but it is trying hard to en
courage more employees to do so.
Georgia-Pacific recently announced that it
will underwrite home loans for its employees
moving to Atlanta at a bargain rate — only
B</ 2 percent.
For others forced to move, the high con
ventional interest rates, plus one-time loan
fees of as much as 3 percent of the amount of
the loan, are forcing would-be buyers and
sellers to be creative. Deals are being
"stitched, pasted and glued together," re
marked Bruce Nowell, senior vice president
of Western Federal Savings & Loan in De
nver.
The trick is to come up with a down pay
ment large enough to cover the difference
between the old, partly paid-off mortgage
and the current, inflated price of the house.
If a buyer can find the cash or borrow it
through a second trust deed loan, it's simple.
Court decisions in California in the last few
years have prevented most lenders from re
fusing to let a loan be assumed by a new
buyer whose credit is good. In some other
states, however, the takeover deal may be
hidden from a lender who would have the
legal right to stop it.
The seller may continue making the origi
nal loan payments, while the buyer pays the
seller, but title still is transferred to the

buyer. Lenders in those states try to keep
track of such deals by checking transfers of
title insurance, said Kenneth Kcrin, vice
president for research at the National As
sociation of Realtors, based in Chicago.
To escape detection, buyers have simply
added their names to the sellers' insurance
policies instead of getting new insurance.
The most common plan is something cal
led an all-inclusive trust deed (AITD). Here
the seller makes a second trust deed and
wraps it up with the original mortgage debt,
to provide a new loan to the buyer at a
below-market interest rate.
For example, the buyer of an $80,000
home makes a cash down payment of
$15,000 and there is an existing first
mortgage loan of $50,000, leaving a $15,000
gap. The seller agrees to finance the $15,000,
but does it by making a total loan of $65,000
(the original $50,000 mortgage plus the new
$15,000 debt) to the borrower.
The rate on the original $50,000 loan is 9.5
percent, and the payments are $425.60 a
month for principal and interest.
The seller makes the $65,000 loan at 14
percent, which is 3 percentage points below
the current market rate of 17 percent. That is
obviously a good deal for the buyer, who
saves almost $150 a month by getting a lower
rate. But the seller gains, too.
The seller collects $770.17 a month on the
new loan, amortized over 30 years, but still
pays only $425.60 a month to keep up the
original loan, thereby collecting nearly $345
a month on this do-it-yourself banking ven
ture.
In some cases, individuals with cash to in
vest are able to finance a real estate loan
when banks won't do it.
Some real estate brokers have made a spe
cialty of putting creative deals together —
but they advise their clients to consult a
lawyer before undertaking the more ad
vanced versions.
One popular plan is a land contract sale.
The seller keeps title to the house until the
buyer has paid off the balance on the original
loan, plus a down payment. Usually the deal
calls for a very large payment to clear up all
the debt after three to five years — a so
called "balloon" payment. By then, it is
hoped, the deal can be refinanced through
regular channels at a lower rate.
Individual sellers usually charge lower in
terest than banks or savings and loans, but in
many states they are limited by usury laws.
