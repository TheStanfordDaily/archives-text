# Immigration laws bar foreign gays
## 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
The scene: A foreigner at
tempts to pass through customs
at an international airport. Sud
denly, an immigration officer
who suspects that the foreigner is
a homosexual, takes him into a
room and asks him about his
sexual preferences.
If the man admits to being gay,
he is told he cannot enter the
country because he has a
"psychopathic personality."
Then he is given the choice of
"freely" returning to his point of
departure or waiting in jail for
four days for a hearing, after
which, he is told, he will be de
ported.
The country? The United
States of America.
"There is no doubt in my mind
that this is going on all the time,"
said attorney Matt Coles to 30
people at a meeting of the Gay
Law Students Association on
March 13 at the Law School.
"Most people are so intimidated
by the experience, they just
leave," he added.
Ifie former professor of con
stitutional law at UC-Hastings
College of the Law is currently
representing two Mexicans who
refused to return to Mexico
when they were detained at San
Francisco Airport last August.
The detention occurred only
several weeks after Carl Hill, of
England, was denied entry into
the United States for wearing a
gay rights button.
According to Coles, the
McCarron Act of 1954, which
excluded people with
"psychopathic personalities"
from entering the country, has
been used by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service (INS)
to exclude homosexuals. In 1967
the U.S. Supreme Court con
firmed the practice, and the fol
lowing year Congress added
"sexual deviants" to the exclu
sion list.
"It may be totally irrational to
assume that gay equals
psychopathic, but that doesn't
mean Congress couldn't think
it," said Coles.
Citing Mexico, Canada and
the Iron Curtain countries. Coles
said the policy of excluding gays
is not limited to the U.S. "Gays
are very welcome to leave the
country, however," he added.
Previously, a doctor from Pub
lic Health had to certify that
someone was gay, and thus
psychopathic. In the Carl Hill
case, however, the Surgeon
General was persuaded to order
that homosexuality could not be
determined medically and was
not psychopathic, thus agreeing
with the American Psychological
Association's position, said
Coles.
"One week later, when Cruz
and Martinez (the Mexicans)
were held, the INS said it could
determine who has a
psychopathic personality with
out doctors," said Coles.

rheir criteria? It included evi
dence of a "feminine nature,"
such as the pancake makeup that
the two Mexicans possessed
("the kind a prominent Califor
nia legislator uses,") or, in
another case, the contents of a
dress designer's luggage.
When Cruz and Martinez
sued, a consent order was issued,
telling the INS not to enforce the
clause in question until Congress
gave direct clarification on its in
tent. But two months later, the
INS devised its own regulations
excluding gays, said Coles. Sub
sequently, both the Justice De
partment and Secretary of State
Cyrus Vance have instructed the
INS to continue to exclude gays.
"If you 'look gay' (whatever
that means), they will ask you if
you are, and they have you in a
double bind: if you say yes, you
are deported, but if you say no,
they won't believe you, because
would a psychopath tell the
truth?" said Coles.
He added that the INS has
used the clause primarily to
harass people from Latin
America, the Orient and
Mexico, "because they don't like
these people, and they're easy to
intimidate."
Change through the courts is
unlikely, according to Coles,
who mentioned several prece
dents which demonstrate the
anti-gay attitudes of the U.S.
Supreme Court under Chief Jus
tice Warren Burger. However,
the California Supreme Court
set a pro-gay precedent last May
31 by ruling that municipalities
cannot discriminate on the basis
of sexual orientation, he said.
Furthermore, to expect Con
gress to change the law is not
realistic, said Coles. "The execu
tive branch, however, has the au
thority to change the interpreta
tion, because the law is so
vague," he said, pointing to the
Justice Department's decision
that possession of less that an
ounce of certain controlled sub
stances is no longer against the
law.
Similarly, the President could
issue an executive order telling
the INS whether or not to
exclude gays, but (President
Jimmy) Carter doesn't want to
make the final decision during an
election year, said Coles.
