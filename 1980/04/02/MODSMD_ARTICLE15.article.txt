WASHINGTON â€” The U.S. economy appears
to be headed into its seventh recession since World
War 11, judging from the performance of a gov
ernment forecasting index released Monday.
The Commerce Department's Composite Index
of Leading Indicators fell 0.2 percent in February
to its lowest level in more than 2 x /i years.
The February decline was the fifth in as many
months. Three consecutive monthly declines are
said to precede a recession.
"It indicates that the economy is beginning to
slip," said Robert Gough, chief forecaster for Data
Resources Inc., the nation's largest private fore
casting company in Lexington, Mass. "Business is
in a holding pattern. They are ready to go down."
Further supporting this theory is the fact that a
second Commerce Department index, this one re
flecting current economic activity, fell 0.3 percent
in February after four months of weak growth. This
so-called Composite Index of Coincident Indi
cators had risen 0.4 percent in January and O.J
percent in December.
The index was released on the same day Presi
dent Jimmy Carter unveiled a revised 1 98 1 budget

that will propose $15 billion less spending than
Carter's original budget proposed in January. It
contains a surplus of revenue over spending, mark
ing the first time in 1 2 years the government would
be operating in the black. Carter has said a ba
lanced budget will be important in helping to slow
inflation.
A recession traditionally is defined as two con
secutive quarters of declining output.
The last U.S. recession occurred in 1973-75,
when output fell sharply in the wake of the Arab oil
embargo. Oil prices doubled last year and are con
tinuing to rise, putting pressure on prices and mak
ing it harder for businesses to increase production.
The Commerce Department's composite fore
casting index had fallen 0.3 percent in January and
December, 1.9 percent in November and 1.4 per
cent in October.
The index in February stood at 134.9. meaning it
was 34.9 percent ahead of its 1967 base.
Still, the index was down about 6.1 percent from
its high of 143.6 in October 1978 and the lowest
reading since a 135 in July 1977, Commerce data
indicated.
