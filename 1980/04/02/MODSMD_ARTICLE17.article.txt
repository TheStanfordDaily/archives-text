# Refining change gives more gas
## 
### Thomas O'Toole The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Ashland
Oil Inc. announced here Monday
that it has developed a process to
refine 25 percent more gasoline
from a barrel of crude oil than is
now possible.
The oil company, calling the
new refining method a "break
through." said it will build a $70
million refinery in Ashland, Ky.,
that will use the "reduced crude
conversion" process.
"We believe we've found a
method that allows us to produce
more gasoline from the heavy,
leftover end of a barrel of crude
oil," Oliver Zandona, Ashland
vice president for manufacturing
and engineering research, said at
a press conference. "We think
this is a real breakthrough in our
industry."
In New York. Ashland
Chairman Orin Atkins told the
New York Society of Security
Analysts that a patented Ash
land process to be used by the
new refinery will extract from a
barrel of oil up to more than 70
percent gasoline rather than the
50 percent usually extracted.
"This promises to be one of
the more revolutionary de
velopments in the petroleum re
fining industry and can be a
major step toward reducing our
nation's dependence on im
ported crude oil," Atkins said.
"It is important to realize 'that
the possible 25 percent reduc
tion in crude oil requirements' is
applicable for both domestic and
imported crude oil."
In Washington, Zandona said
that Ashland will build a 40,000
barrel-a-day addition to its
180,000 barrel-a-day refinery in
Ashland that will be ready to
start up in early 1982. He said
the addition will produce up to
25,000 barrels of gasoline on top
of the 90,000 barrels of gasoline
it now produces on an average

day.
In the refining process, crude
oil is refined into its lighter and
heavier components The lighter
fraction contains gasoline and
heating oil, which are physically
separated after the refining pro
cess. Jet fuel and kerosene are in
the middle fraction, and residual
fuel is left over in the heavy frac
tion.
Zandona said the Ashland
process works by converting
most of the heavy bottom of the
crude oil barrel into gasoline.
Normally, the residual or left
over 25 percent of a barrel of
crude is sold as lower-priced
boiler fuel or made into asphalt.
The heaviest fraction of a bar
rel of oil, Zandona said, is con
taminated with sulfur and trace
metals like nickel and vanadium
that "poison" the refining pro
cess and prevent the conversion
of the heavy oil fraction into
gasoline.
The Ashland "reduced crude
conversion" process changes the
sulfur into hydrogen sulfide gas
which can be removed from the
oil and binds the nickel and van
adium to a catalyst which Zan
dona described as being made of
microspheres of silica and
alumina.
Zandona said that Ashland
has been running a 200 barrel
a-day demonstration refinery
since April 1978, and has pro
duced greater gasoline runs from
as many as a dozen different
crude oils, including the heaviest
from Mexico and Venezuela.
At present, U.S. oil companies
refine an average of 14 million
barrels of crude oil a day of
which half is refined to gasoline.
Theoretically at least, the Ash
land process could produce an
additional 1.75 million barrels of
gasoline a day if all refiners used
it.
