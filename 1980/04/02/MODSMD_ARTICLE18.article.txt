## Did nuclear accident kill infants? 
### 
I ast Friday marked the first
anniversary of the accident at
ITiree Mile Island (TMI). One
year later, the TMI containment
is still filled with radioactive
water and gases. Metropolitan
Edison, the plant owner, has
proposed "clean-up" proce
dures that amount to little more
than release of the trapped
wastes into the environment.
Recently the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission has suggested
that they may permit these re
leases without waiting for com
pletion ot an environmental im
pact statement. Not surprisingly,
these plans have been sharply
criticized by area residents.
The recent anniversary and
impending new releases make
this a good time to review the
known health effects of the TMI
accident. The Kemeny Commis
sion suggested that there were no
immediate health effects at
tributable to the radioactive re
leases last spring. They con
cluded that the accident-related
increase in latent cancers would
be undetectable and that
psychological stress among
workers and those living in the
area was the only significant ef
fect.
A recent paper by Di. Ernest
Sternglass of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine

calls this conclusion into ques
tion. Sternglass focused his at
tention on infant mortality re
cords collected from area hospi
tals and the U.S. monthly vital
statistics. These reports indicate
a significant increase in intant
deaths in areas downwind from
TMI during the three months fol
lowing the accident.
Summer is normally a period
of low infant mortatlity due to a
lower risk of pneumonia and in
fluenza. In the summer of 1474.
however, the infant mortality
rate in Pennsylvania rose from a
level of 10.4 per thousand in
March to a peak of 15.5 in July.
In August, mortality levels re
turned to a more typical level ot
8.5 per thousand.
This represents a rise from 14 1
to 271 deaths per month bet
ween March and Jul\ and cor
responds to an increase ot more
than five standard deviations.
The probability that this is a
purely statistical fluctuation is
less than 1 in 1000.
During the same period.infant
mortality in the United States as
a whole continued to decline.
Areas in the south and east of
TMI. not in the path of the gas
plume, experienced no increases
in infant deaths.
Sternglass estimates that dur
ing the period ot May through

July 1474, 352 "excess" deaths
occurred in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and New York. He also predicts
a similar increase in leukemia
and childhood cancers within the
next 10 to 1 5 years. Should these
predictions be borne out, TMI
will have produced the highest
death toll of any industrial acci
dent in U.S. history. \
Sternglass' conclusions are not
without precedent or theoretical
explanation. Similar effects were
observed following atmospheric
nuclear weapons tests during the
'50s and 'hOs. These effects were
not immediately recognized be
cause the radiation doses were
thought to be too small to cause
damage.
More recent work on the cor
relation between infant mortal
ity and \-ray exposure during
pregnancy has demonstrated the
extreme sensitivity of the de
\ eloping fetus to low-level radia
tion. The fetal thyroid, where
lodine-13 1 concentrates, is criti
cal to development and matura
tion during the final months of
pregnancy. Babies born after
July of 1474 did not have active
thyroid glands at the time of the
accident — hence the sharp drop
in mortality during August.
As if this were not enough,
Sternglass points out that for
each infant damaged enough to

die, many more suffered lesser
damage, possibly leading to
mental retardation or abnormal
growth patterns. The number of
persons affected may reach into
the thousands. This is a sobering
thought when one recalls that the
TMI releases were small, small in
comparison to the materials still
trapped within the reactor con
tainment.
1 would be interested to see
the comment of radiologists and
statisticians at Stanford on the
validity of Sternglass' conclu
sions. Since the paper was pre
sented in Israel and may not be
readily available, interested per
sons should contact RANE at
P.O. Box 8842, Stanford.
Numerous times we have been
reassured by public and private
officials that no one was hurt at
TMI and that nuclear power
plants pose no significant risk to
the public. In the last year we
have begun to learn what the
risks truly are.
Obviously the cost of nuclear
power goes far beyond what we
see on our electric bills each
month. Do we need this energy
so badly that we will pay in
human lives?

a similar increase in leukemia
and childhood cancers within the
next 10 to 1 5 years. Should these
predictions be borne out, TMI
will have produced the highest
death toll of any industrial acci
dent in U.S. history. \
Sternglass' conclusions are not
without precedent or theoretical
explanation. Similar effects were
observed following atmospheric
nuclear weapons tests during the
'50s and 'hOs. These effects were
not immediately recognized be
cause the radiation doses were
thought to be too small to cause
damage.
More recent work on the cor
relation between infant mortal
ity and \-ray exposure during
pregnancy has demonstrated the
extreme sensitivity of the de
\ eloping fetus to low-level radia
tion. The fetal thyroid, where
lodine-13 1 concentrates, is criti
cal to development and matura
tion during the final months of
pregnancy. Babies born after
July of 1474 did not have active
thyroid glands at the time of the
accident — hence the sharp drop
in mortality during August.
As if this were not enough,
Sternglass points out that for
each infant damaged enough to

die, many more suffered lesser
damage, possibly leading to
mental retardation or abnormal
growth patterns. The number of
persons affected may reach into
the thousands. This is a sobering
thought when one recalls that the
TMI releases were small, small in
comparison to the materials still
trapped within the reactor con
tainment.
1 would be interested to see
the comment of radiologists and
statisticians at Stanford on the
validity of Sternglass' conclu
sions. Since the paper was pre
sented in Israel and may not be
readily available, interested per
sons should contact RANE at
P.O. Box 8842, Stanford.
Numerous times we have been
reassured by public and private
officials that no one was hurt at
TMI and that nuclear power
plants pose no significant risk to
the public. In the last year we
have begun to learn what the
risks truly are.
Obviously the cost of nuclear
power goes far beyond what we
see on our electric bills each
month. Do we need this energy
so badly that we will pay in
human lives?

I ast Friday marked the first
anniversary of the accident at
ITiree Mile Island (TMI). One
year later, the TMI containment
is still filled with radioactive
water and gases. Metropolitan
Edison, the plant owner, has
proposed "clean-up" proce
dures that amount to little more
than release of the trapped
wastes into the environment.
Recently the Nuclear Regulat
ory Commission has suggested
that they may permit these re
leases without waiting for com
pletion ot an environmental im
pact statement. Not surprisingly,
these plans have been sharply
criticized by area residents.
The recent anniversary and
impending new releases make
this a good time to review the
known health effects of the TMI
accident. The Kemeny Commis
sion suggested that there were no
immediate health effects at
tributable to the radioactive re
leases last spring. They con
cluded that the accident-related
increase in latent cancers would
be undetectable and that
psychological stress among
workers and those living in the
area was the only significant ef
fect.
A recent paper by Di. Ernest
Sternglass of the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine

calls this conclusion into ques
tion. Sternglass focused his at
tention on infant mortality re
cords collected from area hospi
tals and the U.S. monthly vital
statistics. These reports indicate
a significant increase in intant
deaths in areas downwind from
TMI during the three months fol
lowing the accident.
Summer is normally a period
of low infant mortatlity due to a
lower risk of pneumonia and in
fluenza. In the summer of 1474.
however, the infant mortality
rate in Pennsylvania rose from a
level of 10.4 per thousand in
March to a peak of 15.5 in July.
In August, mortality levels re
turned to a more typical level ot
8.5 per thousand.
This represents a rise from 14 1
to 271 deaths per month bet
ween March and Jul\ and cor
responds to an increase ot more
than five standard deviations.
The probability that this is a
purely statistical fluctuation is
less than 1 in 1000.
During the same period.infant
mortality in the United States as
a whole continued to decline.
Areas in the south and east of
TMI. not in the path of the gas
plume, experienced no increases
in infant deaths.
Sternglass estimates that dur
ing the period ot May through

July 1474, 352 "excess" deaths
occurred in Pennsylvania, Ohio
and New York. He also predicts
a similar increase in leukemia
and childhood cancers within the
next 10 to 1 5 years. Should these
predictions be borne out, TMI
will have produced the highest
death toll of any industrial acci
