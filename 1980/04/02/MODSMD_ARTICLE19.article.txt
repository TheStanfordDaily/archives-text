## Christianity remains 'alive and well' 
### 
The world is an increasily secu
lar place. 'Hie Christian Church,
long a major influence on civili
zation. is on its last leg and will
soon be only a vestigial presence
on the global scene. Scientific
humanism, the modern person's
faith, will step in and become the
foundation of the emerging
world order.
Or at least, that's what we're
all told.
But is this view accurate? As a
member of the church, I would
answer both yes and no. The
church had undoubtedly lost cer
tain types of influence during the
past few centuries, but in other
ways it may be embarking on a
"golden age" of tremendous ex
pansion and impact. To parap
hrase Mark Twain's comment
upon hearing of his own demise.
"Reports of our death are
greatly exaggerated."
Of course, in a numerical
sense, any talk of a post-church
age is pure nonsense. It is esti
mated that there are over one
billion Christians in the world
today, with perhaps 250 million
of these being "active" members
of the Christian community.
North America is a longstanding
stronghold, but perhaps the most
surprising thing is the tremen
dous expansion of the church in
the "underdeveloped" world,
particularly in South America
and Africa. In South America,
the Catholic Church is ex
periencing a renewal, while Pro

testant churches are growing at
incredible rates. With much of
the South American population
heading for the cities, the future
looks bright for the church,
which has always had its greatest
influence in urban areas.
The story in Africa is even
more astounding. David Lamb, a
Los Angeles Times staff writer,
recently observed. "For better or
worse, though, the missionaries
did not fail in theirassigned task:
they planted the seeds of Christ
ianity deep. And today — de
spite great obstacles created by
Marxist governments and rep
ressive presidents — the Christ
ian Church, some observers be
lieve. has become the most pow
erful institution in sub-Sahara
Africa . . . Christianity in Africa
is growing so fast that by the year
2000 the continent may have the
greatest concentration of Christ
ians in the world. Their current
strength: 190 million." Ironi
cally. African churches are now
sending missionaries to Western
Europe.
In addition to the expansion
already occurring, much of the
Western church is gearing up for
an "age of missions" in which
tens of thousands of missionaries
will be sent worldwide with the
gospel. Places like China and
parts of the Moslem world,
which for so long have been
closed, are now being opened up
to the Christian movement. And
even in places like the Soviet

Union where Christians are
ruthlessly oppressed, the church
(along with the Jewish commun
ity) is often the one voice oppos
ing totalitarian regimes.
But mere numerical and geog
raphical expansion is not my
primary reason for believing that
Christianity will play a crucial
role in the civilizations of the fu
ture. In a world where massive
violence becomes more of a pos
sibility each year, and where the
materialistic liberalism of the
past becomes obsolete, the gos
pel of Christ will provide a strik
ingalternative to the value struc
tures that motivate the
technological West, and by os
mosis. the rest of the world.
Jeremy Rifkin, a leading intel
lectual among the radical ac
tivists of the '60s. devoted him
self to studying the Christian
movement in America, particu
larly the evangelical wing of this
movement. He wanted to know
what effect, if any, the church
could have on the society of the
future.
Rifkin, who is not a Christian,
was by his own admission sur
prised at his findings. He con
cluded that the Christian move
ment in America was the key to a
society that could survive peace
fully in a world of threatening
violence and economic scarcity,
largely because of the charac
teristic non-violence and non
materialism that he found within
the movement. He admitted that

he had been misled by
stereotypes propagated in the
media. Many of this findings are
detailed in his book. The Emerg
ing Order.
Is Christianity dead? As an
ideology to be used by unjust and
authoritarian governments to
subjugate people, perhaps it is
almost dead (communism has
taken its place). But as a live
faith that is fundamentally shap
ing the lives of hundreds of mill
ions, it is alive and well. "... Lo,
I am with you. even to the end of
the age."
