### Maureen Santini The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON â€” Fresh U.S. ef
forts to achieve a break in the Iranian
hostage crisis hit a snag last night after
Iran's president told an intermediary
between the two governments that he
was awaiting a new statement of
American intentions, a top White
House official said.
The aide, who asked anonymity,
acknowledged that U.N. Secretary
General Kurt Waldheim had talked by
telephone with Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and then re
ported to Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance that Bani-Sadr wanted another
statement from the United States.
Bani-Sadr reportedly said that pre
vious White House statements had not
met the conditions he set for transfer
ring control of the hostages from the
militants at the U.S. Embassy to the
Iranian government. He also repor
tedly asked for a more specific declara
tion that the United States would not
retaliate against Iran.
"We don't know specifically what
they're looking for," said the White
House official of the Iranian leader
ship. He also said the United States

"would like to be as helpful as we can."
Earlier, President Jimmy Carter had
told reporters he was delaying the im
position of any new sanctions against
Iran. The president, although making
no mention of Bani-Sadr's conditions
that the United States not initiate
propaganda or provocation against
Iran, called the Iranian president's
speech yesterday a "positive develop
ment."
Carter had expressed hope that the
50 American hostages soon would be
transferred from control of their milit
ant captors at the embassy to the Ira
nian government.
Carter's statement had been
heralded as the U.S. government's
"appropriate statement at an approp
riate time" in response to Bani-Sadr's
conditional offer to wrest control of the
hostages.
When a reporter at last night's brief
ing pointed to the White House offi
cial's statement of willingness to be
helpful as an indication of increased
flexibility, he said,"l didn't mean to
be."
He added that "obviously there are
limitations beyond which the president

cannot go."
The president earlier acknowledged
that he had no guarantee that Bani-
Sadr would deliver on his promise to
place the hostages under Iranian gov
ernment control if certain conditions
were met.
At a midday speech before the
AFL-ClO's National Conference of
Building and Construction Trades, the
president declared emphatically topro
longed cheers that no one in the United

States had apologized to Iranians for
any action during the reign of the de
posed shah of Iran.
Carter also said the United States
had not and will not condone or express
any approval of the seizure of the hos
tages by the Iranian militants, and he
warned that American patience was
running thin.
Carter's remarks to the labor union
came on the day of the Wisconsin and
Kansas primary elections.
