# Friday Forum: Will a student-run Coffee House work?
## 
### 
What will be the advantages and disadvan
tages of a student-run Coffee House? Will it
contribute a badly-needed student social center
to the University and provide students with val
uable training in restaurant management? Can
we expect lower prices and better entertainers?
Or is it more likely that without professional
operators the Coffee House will be sloppily run.

a dismal failure that loses both money and cus
tomers? Is the whole idea a big mistake?
Express your concerns, advice and ideas
about the venture. Opinions for this f-riday's
Forum should be delivered to the Daily at the
Storke Publications Building by noon today.
Columns and letters should be typed, double
spaced, on a 57-space line, and all submissions
are subject to editing.
