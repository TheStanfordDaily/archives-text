## Change energy attitudes 
### 
There is no energy shortage in America. There
is, however, a crisis in American thought.
There is no question that energy is currently one
of our foremost difficulties and that a crisis situa
tion exists. Yet the fact remains that energy is
plentiful; only our continued ill-use of it creates the
appearance of a shortage.
In dealing with the present situation, we have
often taken the approach that we all must make
sacrifices and that research grants and patience will
eventually provide us with technological miracles.
A second look at the nature of the current crisis
reveals that both of these attitudes are misconcep
tions, inaccurate conclusions that have paralyzed
America's feeble attempt to eliminate its depen
dence on foreign oil.
We are not being forced to make sacr if ices, but
instead are being given a plethora of ne* oppor
tunities. A carpool can be considered an incon
venience — or an exciting, new avenue for meeting
people and establishing relationships. Walking or
biking to the market can be a nuisance — or a way
to get exercise and fresh air. Installing insulation
may be expensive — until the reduction in heating
bills dwarfs the initial investment.
With a change in our attitudes, we can become
aware of the benefits that are just now beginning to
accrue. Air quality is being improved through a
reduction in auto exhaust and power plant emis
sions. Thermal pollution of our waterways will be
exchanged for electricity produced through cogen
eration, a process that uses waste industrial heat.
Energy costs will eventually decrease as we begin
to exploit free solar power.
Solving the energy crisis does not mean societal
upheaval. Oil companies and solar energy firms
can, should and must coexist. An economy
founded on oil is not going to switch to alternative
energy in 10, 20 or 30 years. But as the changeover
to renewable sources of energy continues, our de
pendence on oil will gradually be reduced.
Current solar technology cannot fulfill the
majority of our energy requirements. What it can
do, today, is replace 10 to 15 percent of the energy
we get from oil. A solar home may never be able to
provide 100 percent of a household's heating re
quirements, but the 70 percent that it can easily
prov ide could slash a hefty wedge from our need to
import oil. The point is to take advantage of what
solar can supply, and to realize that oil is being
conserved, even though it occasionally may be
needed to supplement solar power.
The concept of conservation has been grossly
misperceived. Contrary to popular belief, it does
not imply an ascetic existence.
All too often, the word conjures up dreadful

images of studying by candlelight or walking
around in fur coats. On the contrary, we can fulfill
its purpose by merely turning off lights in unused
rooms, wearing sweaters, walking on short trips
and similar measures. Recycling aluminum cans
and newspapers is almost as easy as discarding
them, and both energy and resources are conserved
in the process. Conservation is far better defined as
the wise use of energy rather than personal sac
rifice. Heat your room, but only when you are in it.
The end result of our changing attitudes should
be an appreciation for the actual issues involved in
energy conservation. America is no more going
back to living in log cabins in the woods than
Thoreau really did. But just as he chose to spiritu
ally plunge into the task of self-reliance and
simplicity, so too must we reconsider our own
priorities.

There is no simple solution to the energy crisis,
no more than there is to poverty or war. TTie solu
tion is as complicated as our set of values and the
socio-economic system in which we live. Instead of
simply consuming and utilizing resources, we are
faced with the need to examine how best to use
those resources, how to minimize waste, and
whether we really do need to use them.
Are we really better off driving on our errands,
or do we sacrifice the leisure and exercise that
•accompany walking?
The important question to ask ourselves is not
whether technology is good, but which technology
is good. Not whether we should drive our cars, but
when and where they are most useful.
America feels its lifestyle threatened by the
energy crisis and chooses to wait tor a technological
miracle. The only miracle that will solve the crisis is
one of changing values and priorities.
The energy is there, and by most standards, even
in abundance. It is merely the consciousness and
the will to employ it judiciously that are lacking.
