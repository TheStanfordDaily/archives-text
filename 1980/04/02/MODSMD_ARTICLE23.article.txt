## Find Kemmeries' column 
### 
Every morning there comes a
time during breakfast that I
dread, when 1 am done with the
Daily. I turn to the last page and
thoroughly read the news sum
mary. Finally, in desperation I
read the weather report that
never applies to Stanford, but
there is no way to avoid it: soon I
will have to put down my wood
pulp shield and acknowledge the
presence of other (shudder)
people.
Now, I was raised in a big city
so I believe that the best policy is
not to get involved, but these
other "people" (as they will be
called for the remainder of this
article) insist on talking! I guess
it's this stuff that really unnerves
me.
The next big question is what
to talk about. We all stare
blankly at each other and 1 feel
like 1 am in Mem Chu as we ob
serve a moment of silence. Un
fortunately I find most of the
common subjects of discussion
too depressing, such as scholas

tics or the quality of food service.
Luckily, the Daily once more
comes to the rescue and we can
talk about what we read to avoid
talking.
However, in order to have a
coherent conversation one must
be able to recognize different
parts of the paper. For example,
confusing the sports section and
the stock market report is likely
to cause you to bet incorrectly
and not have any money to bet. 1
believe a major problem in my
social life first quarter was that I
kept thinking the world news was
the entertainment section.
For morning conversation it is
best to discuss humorous articles
and these can be found every day
in the opinions section. But one
must be careful, because it is only
considered good taste to laugh at
opinions specifically intended to
have humor content. Before I
realized this, I committed the
faux pas of laughing openly at
a COP opinion.
Foremost among the writers of
purposefully humorous opinions
is Bill "Early Date" Kemmeries.
However, many of you have
written in asking how to recog
nize a Kemmeries column once
you have located the opinions
page. For your benefit I have
listed below some common as
pects of the form of his opinions
to aid you.
1) Snappy Opening Parag
raphs: In the opening paragraphs
Bill elucidates some problem he
is going to solve for us. Often this
is illustrated with an exciting
story taken from Bill's life. Once
I read a column of his about
nervousness in front of profes
sors in which he said he urinated
in his pants while talking to one.
Boy, was he embarrassed! Also,
as a matter of course he insults
you do-do brains out there in
readerland, which explains why
he has the answers you don't
have.
2) Enumerated Answers: In
this section Bill gives step-by
step instructions on how to solve
the problem explained above.
This is the humorous part you
struggled through the Snappy
Opening Paragraphs to get to.
Each step is numbered and be
gins with an italicized title that
often has the word "technique"
in it.
3) Technique: Sometimes
there are a lot of Enumerated
Answers.
4) Style: Oh yeah, some of the
italicized titles use the word
"style."
5) Snappy Closing Parag
raphs: Bill realizes his column is

almost full and tries to wrap it up
fast. This is the most popular part
to skip over. Often he gives an
extremely outlandish solution
that makes the answers given in
the Enumerated Answers section
seem reasonable in comparison.
Finally he expresses his confi
dence in his answers and wishes
the readers well.
6) Cute Byline: The opinions
editor for that night becomes so
inspired by Bill's humor that he
or she writes a non-standard
byline. Generally, if the byline is
longer than two lines, you know
something is up.
These are the major format
standards of Kemmeries. I hope
they will help you in the difficult
task of recognizing a Kemmeries
column, and despite the tone of
the earlier portion of this article,
his opinions are well worth read
ing and I thoroughly enjoy read
ing them.
If an opinion satisfied four or
more of the characteristics
above, there is an 80 percent
chance that it is one of Bill's, and
if it satisfies all six there is a 95
percent chance. Taking these
two figures together, we can ex
trapolate and easily infer that 1
have never taken a statistics
class.
1 have one final hint: occa
sionally you will see a picture in
the opinions section of a charac
ter with his finger up his nose and
wearing a Mickey Mouse hat.
Mickey has no nostrils and so it
must be Bill. This is a:strong indi
cation you have found one of his
opinions.
You wouldn't believe how dif
ficult it is to find a strong ending
for an opinion (and this is the
type of problem that drives
editors crazy). I mean, you've
been rambling along . . .
