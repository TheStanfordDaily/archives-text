# Despite fewer collegiates overall
## Studies show women's colleges on the rise 
### Ursula Vils The Los Angeles Times 
During the 19605, women's
colleges fell prey to rising costs,
declining birth rates and compet
ition from public institutions.
Then the notion that coeduca
tion was a better way for women
to advance led to the disappear
ance of many women's colleges.
Some colleges turned coedu
cational; some merged with
men's schools; some simply
closed their doors.
Now, as higher education
faces a dwindling number of stu
dents and an escalating inflation
rate, women's colleges seem to
be bucking the trend: In each of
the last five years, enrollment
rates at women's colleges have
increased, and so at substantially
higher percentages than those of
other independent institutions of
higher education.
A survey of 53 women's col
leges in the fall of 197N showed a
2.5 percent increase in enroll
ment, as against a 1.6 percent
increase in enrollment at inde
pendent institutions and a seven
percent decrease at public col
leges. The freshman class at
these women's colleges was up
3.4 percent.
Devotion
Despite their diminished
numbers, women's colleges re
tain a loyal following among stu
dents, parents, alumnae and
educators. Further, they are
bolstered by data gathered by
two respected researchers, Pro
fessor Alexander Astin of
UCLA and Professor Elizabeth
1 idball of the George
Washington University Medical
Center.
Astim's study. Four Critical
Years, was a 10-year survey of
200,000 students and 300 in
stitutions. Astin found that
single-sex colleges, men's as well
as women's, "facilitate student
involvement in several areas:
academic, interaction with fa
culty. and verbal aggressive
ness."
He also found that women's
colleges foster leadership among
women and that students are
more likely to develop high aspi
rations and to persist to gradua
tion.
Achievers
Tidball, in examining 1500
women named in Who's Who
of American Women, found
that graduates of women's col
leges were twice as likely to be
come achievers as those of

coeducational institutions.
She al so found a significant
positive correlation between the
numbers of women achievers
and numbers of women faculty
members at the colleges at
tended. Since women's colleges
have a higher proportion of
women faculty, students find
more and influential role mod
els.
l'he research statistics corneas
no surprise to those who ad
minister women's colleges and
who are determined to see them
survive as such.
Although Mount St. Mary's
College in Los Angeles admits
men to its nursing and music
programs and for the master's
degree in higher education, it is
essentially a women's college
and will remain so, according to
Sister Magdalen Coughlin, pres
ident.
"We have taken a clear-eyed
decision. There is great value in
being a women's college — to the
student, to education and to soc
iety," she said.
Higher self-esteem
Jacquelyn Mattfeld, president
of Barnard College in New York
City, placed "Higher self
esteem" first in listing the advan
tages of a women's college.
"First, higher self-esteem,"
she said. "Then, a network of
contacts in a host of communities
and professions. We assist one
another, encourage and support
each other; there is a mentoring
factor, a sense of pride in iden
tifying with successful women
who have gone before.
"And our graduates become
free to express their identity."
Sister Catherine McNamee is
president of the College of St.
Catherine. St. Paul. Minn., an in
stitution that has grown from
1300 students to nearly 2300 in
the past decade. She sees a chal
lenge in educating women as
their roles in society widen and
multiply.
"Our challenge," she said, "is
not only preparing women for a
career, but in preparing them to
juggle more careers.
"1 think that a women's col
lege can help a woman prepare
for several roles in life."
More experimentation
Some curriculum experts be
lieve that women are more likely
to venture into "male" subject
areas such as math and science in
a women's college where they do
not compete directly with men.
Indeed, information gathered by

the Women's College Coalition
of Washington indicates the fol
lowing,
— 1977 survey showed en
rollments in biology up 15 per
cent and in chemistry up 47 per
cent since 1971 at 65 women's
colleges. Biology majors in
creased more than 50 percent.
— Women faculty in science
and math are significantly grea
ter at women's colleges: 50 per
cent in biology, 53 percent in
chemistry and 49 percent in
mathematics vs. national aver
ages of 20 percent in biology, 11
percent in chemistry and I 3 per
cent in math.
— The percentage of women
majoring in mathematics,
chemistry and biology at wo
men's colleges is two to three
times the national average for
women.
— The most rapidly growing
majors at women's colleges are
economics, biology, business
administration and nursing.
Further education
According to Tidball's study,
graduates of women's colleges
are more likely to go on for ad
vanced degrees than women who

attend coeducational institu
tions.
"lor 50 years," said Mattfeld,
"Barnard has put more than half
its graduates into Ph.D. prog
rams."
And the disadvantages of a
women's college?
From the students' point of
view, social life. Interestingly,
Alexander Astin found men to
be less satisfied with social life at
a single-sex college than women.
"Possibly," he wrote in Four
Cirtical Years "women at wo
men's colleges are less likely to
complain about a lack of social
life because they have more or
ganized social activities on the
campus. Men, who may be more
mobile than women, often go to
women's colleges for social ac
tivities."
Geographic considerations
The Carnegie Council on Pol
icy Studies in Higher Education
has predicted that college en
rollment will shrink between five
percent and 15 percent during
the next 20 years.
The impact will depend on
geography.
Sister Catherine said she ex

pects Minnesota colleges, includ
ing St. Catherine's, to be "heav
ily hit." She hopes to counteract
the trend by diversifying stu
dents' age groups — "but we are
not building any more dor
mitories."
"In California," said Sister
Magdalen, "we will have a
slightly different degree of the
problem; our drop is estimated
at around 1 I percent. But we're
looking in the same direction;
we'd be crazy to build."
The administrators agreed
that tuition costs would rise, that
fund-raising activities would in
crease and that careful budgeting
would be essential. But on the
whole, they offered a cautious
optimism for the future of wo
men's colleges.
"Women's colleges, just by
the hard-headed analysis of the
years ahead, have a lot going for
them," Sister Magdalen said.
"Their appeal is the same as it
has always been; the quality of
the program, one that serves not
only society but anyone who
comes here."

dents, parents, alumnae and
educators. Further, they are
bolstered by data gathered by
two respected researchers, Pro
fessor Alexander Astin of
UCLA and Professor Elizabeth
1 idball of the George
Washington University Medical
Center.
Astim's study. Four Critical
Years, was a 10-year survey of
200,000 students and 300 in
stitutions. Astin found that
single-sex colleges, men's as well
as women's, "facilitate student
involvement in several areas:
academic, interaction with fa
culty. and verbal aggressive
ness."
He also found that women's
colleges foster leadership among
women and that students are
more likely to develop high aspi
rations and to persist to gradua
tion.
Achievers
Tidball, in examining 1500
women named in Who's Who
of American Women, found
that graduates of women's col
leges were twice as likely to be
come achievers as those of

coeducational institutions.
She al so found a significant
positive correlation between the
numbers of women achievers
and numbers of women faculty
members at the colleges at
tended. Since women's colleges
have a higher proportion of
women faculty, students find
more and influential role mod
els.
l'he research statistics corneas
no surprise to those who ad
minister women's colleges and
who are determined to see them
survive as such.
Although Mount St. Mary's
College in Los Angeles admits
men to its nursing and music
programs and for the master's
degree in higher education, it is
essentially a women's college
and will remain so, according to
Sister Magdalen Coughlin, pres
ident.
"We have taken a clear-eyed
decision. There is great value in
being a women's college — to the
student, to education and to soc
iety," she said.
Higher self-esteem
Jacquelyn Mattfeld, president
of Barnard College in New York
City, placed "Higher self
esteem" first in listing the advan
tages of a women's college.
"First, higher self-esteem,"
she said. "Then, a network of
contacts in a host of communities
and professions. We assist one
another, encourage and support
each other; there is a mentoring
factor, a sense of pride in iden
tifying with successful women
who have gone before.
"And our graduates become
free to express their identity."
Sister Catherine McNamee is
president of the College of St.
Catherine. St. Paul. Minn., an in
stitution that has grown from
1300 students to nearly 2300 in
the past decade. She sees a chal
lenge in educating women as
their roles in society widen and
multiply.
"Our challenge," she said, "is
not only preparing women for a
career, but in preparing them to
juggle more careers.
"1 think that a women's col
lege can help a woman prepare
for several roles in life."
More experimentation
Some curriculum experts be
lieve that women are more likely
to venture into "male" subject
areas such as math and science in
a women's college where they do
not compete directly with men.
Indeed, information gathered by

the Women's College Coalition
of Washington indicates the fol
lowing,
— 1977 survey showed en
rollments in biology up 15 per
cent and in chemistry up 47 per
cent since 1971 at 65 women's
colleges. Biology majors in
creased more than 50 percent.
— Women faculty in science
and math are significantly grea
ter at women's colleges: 50 per
cent in biology, 53 percent in
chemistry and 49 percent in
mathematics vs. national aver
ages of 20 percent in biology, 11
percent in chemistry and I 3 per
cent in math.
— The percentage of women
majoring in mathematics,
chemistry and biology at wo
men's colleges is two to three
times the national average for
women.
— The most rapidly growing
majors at women's colleges are
economics, biology, business
administration and nursing.
Further education
According to Tidball's study,
graduates of women's colleges
are more likely to go on for ad
vanced degrees than women who

attend coeducational institu
tions.
"lor 50 years," said Mattfeld,
"Barnard has put more than half
its graduates into Ph.D. prog
rams."
And the disadvantages of a
women's college?
From the students' point of
view, social life. Interestingly,
Alexander Astin found men to
be less satisfied with social life at
a single-sex college than women.
"Possibly," he wrote in Four
Cirtical Years "women at wo
men's colleges are less likely to
complain about a lack of social
life because they have more or
ganized social activities on the
campus. Men, who may be more
mobile than women, often go to
women's colleges for social ac
tivities."
Geographic considerations
The Carnegie Council on Pol
icy Studies in Higher Education
has predicted that college en
rollment will shrink between five
percent and 15 percent during
the next 20 years.
The impact will depend on
geography.
Sister Catherine said she ex

pects Minnesota colleges, includ
ing St. Catherine's, to be "heav
ily hit." She hopes to counteract
the trend by diversifying stu
dents' age groups — "but we are
not building any more dor
mitories."
"In California," said Sister
Magdalen, "we will have a
slightly different degree of the
problem; our drop is estimated
at around 1 I percent. But we're
looking in the same direction;
we'd be crazy to build."
The administrators agreed
that tuition costs would rise, that
fund-raising activities would in
crease and that careful budgeting
would be essential. But on the
whole, they offered a cautious
optimism for the future of wo
men's colleges.
"Women's colleges, just by
the hard-headed analysis of the
years ahead, have a lot going for
them," Sister Magdalen said.
"Their appeal is the same as it
has always been; the quality of
the program, one that serves not
only society but anyone who
comes here."
During the 19605, women's
colleges fell prey to rising costs,
declining birth rates and compet
ition from public institutions.
Then the notion that coeduca
tion was a better way for women
to advance led to the disappear
ance of many women's colleges.
Some colleges turned coedu
cational; some merged with
men's schools; some simply
closed their doors.
Now, as higher education
faces a dwindling number of stu
dents and an escalating inflation
rate, women's colleges seem to
be bucking the trend: In each of
the last five years, enrollment
rates at women's colleges have
increased, and so at substantially
higher percentages than those of
other independent institutions of
higher education.
A survey of 53 women's col
leges in the fall of 197N showed a
2.5 percent increase in enroll
ment, as against a 1.6 percent
increase in enrollment at inde
pendent institutions and a seven
percent decrease at public col
leges. The freshman class at
these women's colleges was up
3.4 percent.

more and influential role mod
els.
l'he research statistics corneas
no surprise to those who ad
minister women's colleges and
who are determined to see them
survive as such.
Although Mount St. Mary's
College in Los Angeles admits
men to its nursing and music
programs and for the master's
degree in higher education, it is
essentially a women's college
and will remain so, according to
Sister Magdalen Coughlin, pres
ident.
"We have taken a clear-eyed
decision. There is great value in
being a women's college — to the
student, to education and to soc
iety," she said.
Higher self-esteem
Jacquelyn Mattfeld, president
of Barnard College in New York
City, placed "Higher self
esteem" first in listing the advan
tages of a women's college.
"First, higher self-esteem,"
she said. "Then, a network of
contacts in a host of communities
and professions. We assist one
another, encourage and support
each other; there is a mentoring
factor, a sense of pride in iden
tifying with successful women
who have gone before.
"And our graduates become
free to express their identity."
Sister Catherine McNamee is
president of the College of St.
Catherine. St. Paul. Minn., an in
stitution that has grown from
1300 students to nearly 2300 in
the past decade. She sees a chal
lenge in educating women as
their roles in society widen and
multiply.
"Our challenge," she said, "is
not only preparing women for a
career, but in preparing them to
juggle more careers.
"1 think that a women's col
lege can help a woman prepare
for several roles in life."
More experimentation
Some curriculum experts be
lieve that women are more likely
to venture into "male" subject
areas such as math and science in
a women's college where they do
not compete directly with men.
Indeed, information gathered by

the Women's College Coalition
of Washington indicates the fol
lowing,
— 1977 survey showed en
rollments in biology up 15 per
cent and in chemistry up 47 per
cent since 1971 at 65 women's
colleges. Biology majors in
creased more than 50 percent.
— Women faculty in science
and math are significantly grea
ter at women's colleges: 50 per
cent in biology, 53 percent in
chemistry and 49 percent in
mathematics vs. national aver
ages of 20 percent in biology, 11
percent in chemistry and I 3 per
cent in math.
— The percentage of women
majoring in mathematics,
chemistry and biology at wo
men's colleges is two to three
times the national average for
women.
— The most rapidly growing
majors at women's colleges are
economics, biology, business
administration and nursing.
Further education
According to Tidball's study,
graduates of women's colleges
are more likely to go on for ad
vanced degrees than women who

attend coeducational institu
tions.
"lor 50 years," said Mattfeld,
"Barnard has put more than half
its graduates into Ph.D. prog
rams."
And the disadvantages of a
women's college?
From the students' point of
view, social life. Interestingly,
Alexander Astin found men to
be less satisfied with social life at
a single-sex college than women.
"Possibly," he wrote in Four
Cirtical Years "women at wo
men's colleges are less likely to
complain about a lack of social
life because they have more or
ganized social activities on the
campus. Men, who may be more
mobile than women, often go to
women's colleges for social ac
tivities."
Geographic considerations
The Carnegie Council on Pol
icy Studies in Higher Education
has predicted that college en
rollment will shrink between five
percent and 15 percent during
the next 20 years.
The impact will depend on
geography.
Sister Catherine said she ex

pects Minnesota colleges, includ
ing St. Catherine's, to be "heav
ily hit." She hopes to counteract
the trend by diversifying stu
dents' age groups — "but we are
not building any more dor
mitories."
"In California," said Sister
Magdalen, "we will have a
slightly different degree of the
problem; our drop is estimated
at around 1 I percent. But we're
looking in the same direction;
we'd be crazy to build."
The administrators agreed
that tuition costs would rise, that
fund-raising activities would in
crease and that careful budgeting
would be essential. But on the
whole, they offered a cautious
optimism for the future of wo
men's colleges.
"Women's colleges, just by
the hard-headed analysis of the
years ahead, have a lot going for
them," Sister Magdalen said.
"Their appeal is the same as it
has always been; the quality of
the program, one that serves not
only society but anyone who
comes here."
