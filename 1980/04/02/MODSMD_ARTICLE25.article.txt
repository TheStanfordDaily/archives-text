WASHINGTON — The
Supreme Court severely
weakened the political pat
ronage system Monday, rul
ing that the Constitution pro
tects the jobs of even some
policy-making and confiden
tial government workers.
By a 6-3 vote, the court
said government employees
cannot he fired solely because
of their political party unless
"party affiliation is an ap
propriate requirement for ef
fective performance of the
public office involved."
Without that proof, a polit
ical firing violates an indi
vidual's constitutionally
guaranteed freedom of as
sociation. Justice John Ste
vens wrote for the court.
The decision, reached in
the case of two Rockland
County, N.Y., public defen
ders, affects jobs at all levels
of government — federal,
state and local.
Led by Justice Lewis Pow
ell, the dissenters said the rul

ing will "decrease the accoun
tability and denigrate the role
of our national political par
ties ... at a time when an in
creasing number of observers
question whether our na
tional political parties can
continue to operate effec
tively."
Powell's unusually strident
dissent accused the court of
ignoring 200 years of political
history to create "a national
civil service system" adminis
tered by judges.
In other matters Monday,
the court took these actions:
— Refused to order heart
surgery for a 13-year-old boy
from California whose pa
rents do not want the child to
outlive them.
— Refused to block the de
portation of Iranian students
until it acts on a formal appeal
of the Carter administration's
action against the students.
Justice Department lawyers
had told the court that no
further deportations are
likely in the near future.
