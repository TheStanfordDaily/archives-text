# American Jews too disarrayed to defy Hitler
## 
### Marjorie Hyer The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Why were American Jews of the
World War II era not more effective in stopping the
holocaust that killed more than six million Jews in
Europe?
This haunting question and the search for answers to it
preoccupied scholars at a special colloquium at Ameri
can University's Pollin Center for the Study of Judaism
in America.
The lack of strong national Jewish organizations a
generation ago, divisions within the Jewish community
and its consequent inadequacy as a political force all
were cited as factors.
The reason cited most frequently was the fact that the
magnitude of Nazi atrocities was so vast, so unpre
cedented. that it could not be comprehended at the time.
As the war progressed, explained Abe Karp, professor
of Jewish studies at the University of Rochester, Jews as
well as other Americans read the daily newspaper stories
of death camps, mass deportations and the slaughter of
Jews.
"They knew of the terror, they knew of the atrocities,
but they did not know it was a holocaust," Karp said.
"How would one know an event so horrible that a special
term had to be fashioned to describe it?"
Karp, who described himself as "one of nine cousins in
Poland, six of whom were murdered in the holocaust."
cited John Mersey's book. The Wall, which included an
assertion that it was a work of fiction, not fact.
"This disclaimer is totally false," Karp said. "John
Hersey didn't invent, he recorded" events in the Warsaw
ghetto.

"Why did the publisher say it was fiction? Because
even in 1 950 (five years after World War II ended) if this
were presented as fact, people would not believe it."
Jan Karski, professor of government at the
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, and a
Polish citizen during the war. made the same point. He
recounted how he had been armed with the facts of
atrocities against the Jews in his homeland, then smug
gled out of the country to try to gain a hearing in
Washington.
He told of an interview with the late Justice Felix
frankfurter, who, upon hearing Karski's tale of horror,
said "1 don't believe you." According to Karski, the late
Supreme Court Justice went on to add, "I did not say you
are lying, but 1 cannot conceive that what you are telling
me can be true."
Henry Feingold of the City University of New York,
contended that there was "no opportunity" for Jews
during the war years "to threaten President Franklin
Roosevelt with the removal of the Jewish vote" as a
means of pressing for military or other measures that
might have saved more Jewish lives.
The Jewish community of that time was "in reality,
atomized, fragmented — barely able to get itself to
gether." he said. American Jews then were divided on
issues that are all but non-existent today — the main one
being Zionism, he said.
He said it was not indifference, it was not callousness,
it was powerlessness, the perennial problem of Jews
everywhere" that frustrated Jews of that era.
John Pehle, an attorney who headed the War Refugee
Board within the government during World War 11. said
that the United States refrained from bombing Au

schwitz concentration camp, as many proposed, because
"we were afraid that if we bombed Auschwitz, Hitler
would say: "The United States agrees with us . . . they
are killing Jews, too.' "
Later, he continued, after the war's strategists were
persuaded that the death camp should be bombed, "the
secretary of war said it was not feasible" because ot the
camp's distance from Allied bomber bases.
The explanation did not satisfy the noted Jewish
philosopher, Emil Fackenheim, of the University ol To
ronto. "I have to keep asking," he said, "why Auschwitz
was not bombed." It has been argued that even though
Jewish prisoners would have died in a bombing, the
camp would have been destroyed and its horrors brought
to world attention earlier.
In the weekly services in his Canadian congregation he
recalled "I began to include a prayer for the Jews who
were murdered by the Nazis that week." After about a
month, he said, an elder of the congregation asked him
to stop, arguing that "Everybody knows what's going on
— why increase their anguish?" So I decided to stop (the
special prayers). Until this day I don't know if it was the
right thing to do," Fackenheim said.
Jews, he said, have a new commandment as a result of
the holocaust: "You are forbidden to give Hitler a post
humous victory."
Fackenheim focused on the state of Israel as the ful
fillment of that commandment, and pleaded for support
of Israel to prevent a possible recurrence of the
holocaust.
Referring to Israel and the United States, he said.
"There are only two countries in all of human history
whose symbol is 'Give me your poor." "

to stop, arguing that "Everybody knows what's going on
— why increase their anguish?" So I decided to stop (the
special prayers). Until this day I don't know if it was the
right thing to do," Fackenheim said.
Jews, he said, have a new commandment as a result of
the holocaust: "You are forbidden to give Hitler a post
humous victory."
Fackenheim focused on the state of Israel as the ful
fillment of that commandment, and pleaded for support
of Israel to prevent a possible recurrence of the
holocaust.
Referring to Israel and the United States, he said.
"There are only two countries in all of human history
whose symbol is 'Give me your poor." "
WASHINGTON — Why were American Jews of the
World War II era not more effective in stopping the
holocaust that killed more than six million Jews in
Europe?
This haunting question and the search for answers to it
preoccupied scholars at a special colloquium at Ameri
can University's Pollin Center for the Study of Judaism
in America.
The lack of strong national Jewish organizations a
generation ago, divisions within the Jewish community
and its consequent inadequacy as a political force all
were cited as factors.
The reason cited most frequently was the fact that the
magnitude of Nazi atrocities was so vast, so unpre
cedented. that it could not be comprehended at the time.
As the war progressed, explained Abe Karp, professor
of Jewish studies at the University of Rochester, Jews as
well as other Americans read the daily newspaper stories
of death camps, mass deportations and the slaughter of
Jews.
"They knew of the terror, they knew of the atrocities,
but they did not know it was a holocaust," Karp said.
"How would one know an event so horrible that a special
term had to be fashioned to describe it?"
Karp, who described himself as "one of nine cousins in
Poland, six of whom were murdered in the holocaust."
cited John Mersey's book. The Wall, which included an
assertion that it was a work of fiction, not fact.
"This disclaimer is totally false," Karp said. "John
Hersey didn't invent, he recorded" events in the Warsaw
ghetto.

"Why did the publisher say it was fiction? Because
even in 1 950 (five years after World War II ended) if this
were presented as fact, people would not believe it."
Jan Karski, professor of government at the
Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, and a
Polish citizen during the war. made the same point. He
recounted how he had been armed with the facts of
atrocities against the Jews in his homeland, then smug
gled out of the country to try to gain a hearing in
Washington.
He told of an interview with the late Justice Felix
frankfurter, who, upon hearing Karski's tale of horror,
said "1 don't believe you." According to Karski, the late
Supreme Court Justice went on to add, "I did not say you
are lying, but 1 cannot conceive that what you are telling
me can be true."
Henry Feingold of the City University of New York,
contended that there was "no opportunity" for Jews
during the war years "to threaten President Franklin
Roosevelt with the removal of the Jewish vote" as a
means of pressing for military or other measures that
might have saved more Jewish lives.
The Jewish community of that time was "in reality,
atomized, fragmented — barely able to get itself to
gether." he said. American Jews then were divided on
issues that are all but non-existent today — the main one
being Zionism, he said.
He said it was not indifference, it was not callousness,
it was powerlessness, the perennial problem of Jews
everywhere" that frustrated Jews of that era.
John Pehle, an attorney who headed the War Refugee
Board within the government during World War 11. said
that the United States refrained from bombing Au

schwitz concentration camp, as many proposed, because
"we were afraid that if we bombed Auschwitz, Hitler
would say: "The United States agrees with us . . . they
are killing Jews, too.' "
Later, he continued, after the war's strategists were
persuaded that the death camp should be bombed, "the
secretary of war said it was not feasible" because ot the
camp's distance from Allied bomber bases.
The explanation did not satisfy the noted Jewish
philosopher, Emil Fackenheim, of the University ol To
ronto. "I have to keep asking," he said, "why Auschwitz
was not bombed." It has been argued that even though
Jewish prisoners would have died in a bombing, the
camp would have been destroyed and its horrors brought
to world attention earlier.
In the weekly services in his Canadian congregation he
recalled "I began to include a prayer for the Jews who
were murdered by the Nazis that week." After about a
month, he said, an elder of the congregation asked him
to stop, arguing that "Everybody knows what's going on
— why increase their anguish?" So I decided to stop (the
