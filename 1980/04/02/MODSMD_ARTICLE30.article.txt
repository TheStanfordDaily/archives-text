# Plants that grow oil discovered
## 
### Albert Chu Allen Chen Staff Writers 
That petroleum comes from
the baked and pressurized re
mains ol ancient animals and
plants is common knowledge.
And that the only sources of oil
are oil fields, oil shales, tar sands,
and other deeply-buried and in
accessible places is also nothing
new. But for every rule there is
an exception. In this case, the ex
ception is one of nature's most
surprising sources of oil: living
plants and trees.
Not long ago. Dr. Melvin Cal
\ in, winner of a Nobel Prize in
chemistry and presently af
filiated with UC-Berkeley, was
\ isiting Brazil on a research trip.
While there, he was approached
bs a Brazilian botanist who
showed Calvin a vial of diesel
fuel that purportedly came from
a living tree.
Cab in thought it was a joke at
first, but he urged his students to
look for the tree any way. On a
return trip to Brazil last August,
his students brought Calvin and
his wife to the site of the tree in
the Amazon jungle. Inserted in
the tree was a long, hollow tube
used for draining the sap. known
as a bung.
When Calv in removed the cap

of the bung, something akin to
diesel fuel flowed from the tree.
Subsequent analyses of the tree's
sap revealed that it is vers close
in composition to diesel fuel.
Hie tree is a member of the
genus Euphorbia which boasts
over two thousand members.
Cal\ m claims that many, perhaps
all of these species produce oil.
Euphorbia includes plants of all
kinds, from trees to small shrubs.
The various species of Euphor
bia grow under widely varying
conditions of temperature, mois
ture and sunlight.
Calvin learned that the Brazi
lian natives in the Amazon had
been using the diesel fuel availa
ble from the Euphorbia cobaif
era langsdorfii for years as a sof
tening agent and other non
energy usages. Calvin, however,
claims that he successfully drove
a VW Rabbit that had been filled
with unprocessed fuel from this
species.
Could these hydrocarbon
fuel-producing plants provide a
significant portion of the world's
oil needs? Calvin believes that
these renewable petroleum re
sources could become economi
cally feasible and provide
enough fuel to lessen our depen
dence on foreign oil. Cabin has
confidence that with genetic im

provement, these plants will
have even higher yields.
Calvin envisions energy plan
tations in which large acreages of
plants could be grown and har
vested. or in the case of trees,
grown and regularly tapped for
their fuel The period of maturity
tor the plants varies; the shrubs,
which are seasonal, can be grown
in northerly, cool climate* and
have a shorter maturity than the
trees, which are perennials and
can grow in the warmer, sunnier
and drier climates of the south.
Calvin predicts that a "pet
roleum" plantation of 50,000
acres will have an annual yield of
80 tons of oil, 260 tons of sugar
(which can be reprocessed into
alcohol) and 200 tons of wood.
Presently there are various uni
versity research labs, such as
Cal\ in's Laboratory of Chemical
Biodynamics. .is well as those of
private industries interested in
exploring and learning more
about the Euphorbia plants.
Calvin is very enthusiastic
about these oil-producing trees.
Although they may not contri
bute to a significant portion of
our total consumption of pet
roleum. these Euphorbia plants
will probably play an important
role in local, small-scale energy
systems.
