## Special Events faces challenges 
### Greg Lucas Staff Writer 
Every rock and jazz concert at
Stanford is brought to you — live
— hy the ASSU Special Events
headed hy John Harris, director
of Special Events, and Lenny
Lieherman, associate director.
Special Events has been so
successful this year that there
will be five concerts in Frost this
spring instead of last year's two.
But Special Events is not like
other rock promoters; it has par
ticular problems peculiar to
being a part of Stanford.
Anticipating a larger roster of
concerts. Special Events applied
for and received holds for the use
of Frost for virtually every
weekend this spring, including
the first three weekends in May.
A hold is a tentative agree
ment between the University's
office of Public Events, which
handles all scheduling of
facilities at Stanford, and the or
ganization that wishes to use the
facility. The hold reserves the
facility for the group on the re
quested day.
A hold, explained Vickie Holt,
the director of Public Events, is a
means of giving ASSU "as many
options for negotiation pos

sibilities as possible." Hut it is
definitely tentative.
Atter receiving the holds for
the weekends in May, Harris
began negotiating for groups to
fill the dates. Liberman
explained what happened next:
"When they (the University)
realized we were going to be able
to deliver a concert every
weekend, the grounds depart
ment called up Public Events
when they found out and said:
'Wait a minute. All those con
certs. Frost is not going to be
maintained properly We will not
be able to water and make it
safety-proof. Frost will not be in
its proper shape for commence
ment.' "
Then, according to Holt, her
office met with the Grounds De
partment to see if some com
promise could be worked out.
After three days of meetings, the
holds were removed for May 17
and IS. Harris feels this action by
the University is damaging to
Special Events.
Reputation damaged
"It hurts us. We have a busi
ness relationship with the out
side world in the music industry.
Our reputation, our credibility,
our professionalism is called into

question tor something over
which we had no control. Ulti
mately it could, not necessarily
will, but could affect our future
ability to deal with these people,
to get the best acts possible to
this campus," he said.
Holt said the mix-up over the
holds points out the loopholes in
the University's system of handl
ing concerts. Plant Services had
underestimated the amount of
time it would need to groom
Frost for commencement.
The ability to prepare Frost
for commencement had not been
an issue. Hold said, in the last
three or four years because Spe
cial Events has not had the
number of concerts it has
scheduled this year.
"The level of productivity al
ways strains any weak points in
the system," Holt said.
Kole conflicts
Harris agrees that the number
of concerts he promotes puts a
strain on the system, but the na
ture of his job, as described by
the University, is raising re
venues for the ASSU. Obvi
ously, the more concerts he pro
motes, the greater ASSU's re
venues. Harris contends that in
the eyes of a booking agency
there is no discrimination bet
ween a foul-up by the Univeristy
and a foul-up by Special Events.
There is a prevailing view
among booking agencies that
colleges are a risk. Often, the
agencies feel, college facilities
are not adequate, and the techni
cal crews are substandard. Harris
said none of this is true here, but
that Special Events constantly
has to deal with the stigma book
ing agencies attach to colleges.
The withdrawal of the holds on
Frost only fuels that opinion in
the minds of the booking agen
cies.
"And what we were saying to
them all year was :'Look, you
can take a chance with us: we're
different from all the rest,' and
then this happened. So they
don't care that Special Events or
that the ASSU didn't mess up,
Stanford messed up. It's a typical
other school; it's a risk. But
again, it's something the Univer
sity had to do. It's not their fault.
It's their fault that they gave us
the facility." Harris said.
Framework
Appreciating this attitude by
the agencies. Holt said she of
fered to speak with the booking
agents and explain the situation.
"ITiings like the hold on Frost,
Holt said, are all part of having to
work within the framework of a
university. ASSU is not an inde
pendent promoter, and it enjoys
certain benefits from that and
suffers from certain detriments.
Working within the
framework is a major problem,
according to Lieherman. "In this
market to get the major acts you
have to come off as a commercial
promoter to the agents. You
have to convince them that this is
a place to do business," he said.
"In turn, the agencies have got to
convince the managers who have
got all these ties in the industry
and to one another and who have
done business with (rock promo
ter Bill) Graham and the other
companies for years.
"Then somebody else, the
University, comes in and says
you're not commercial promot
ers, you're college promoters,
and they are right. But you can't
come off as a college promoter.

or you'll never get anything."
"We're stuck between a rock
and a hard place," Harris said.
But Special Events has been
given the franchise for all con
temporary concerts on campus in
order to raise revenue for the
ASSU. 'Hiis is a part of the Uni
versity's agreement of five years
ago to decrease the ASSU's sub
sidy and make it a more au
tonomous organization.
It is not easy raising money
from rock concerts, according to
Holt, also the coordinator of the
Lively Arts series at Stanford.
"I would be really disturbed if
the University said to me that I
had to base the Lively Arts prog
ram on a subsidy coming from
rock 'n' roll concerts."
Beneficial aspects
Working as it does within the
confines of the University, Spe
cial Events is not really an inde
pendent promoter. This has
some advantages. Holt said.
Special Events does not have to
work through the stage hands
union since it employs students,
nor does it have to hire techni
cians. The technicians are
supplied at a flat rate by the Pub
lic Services Department, headed
by Bill Cleveland.
Its ticketing is handled
through the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice, and its security comes from
the University police.
"We pay hard costs only, what
it costs to actually produce the
show. We are not paying a rental
fee anytime I do a concert or any
time ASSU does a concert.
That's a major difference," Holt
asserted.
Difficulties persist
Both Harris and Holt agree
there have been some problems
in the system as well as the ad
vantages. But the situation is im
proving.
Harris cited past problems
with the Tresidder Ticket Office,
and Larry Davidson, the ticket
office manager, agreed that in
the past there have been some
"down periods" in the ticket of
fice's service.
"But right now," Davidson
said, "we don't have any prob
lems. We've staffed up now so
that we are able to respond to
phone calls and our lines at the
window, and we are able to put
tickets on sale rapidly."
With only one ticket outlet on
campus. Special Events is forced
to work with the ticket office un
less it sets up its own ticket ser
vice, a prospect Davidson called
unfeasible.
"We're talking about proba
bly $700,000 to $800,000 a year
that we'll be doing worth of busi
ness, and you can't just open up a
table on White Plaza and sell all
the ASSU events. That's impos
sible," he said.
As things stand. Special
Events will continue to have the
franchise on rock and jazz con
certs with final approval on the
appropriateness of the concert
resting with the University. They
will continue to work within the
system already set up.
Lieberman summarized the
University's position on Special
Events promoting concerts:
"From the University
standpoint, the bottom line is
they understand and appreciate
the problems we have, but they
can't do anything about it be
cause we're a peripheral function
of the University."

come off as a college promoter.

or you'll never get anything."
"We're stuck between a rock
and a hard place," Harris said.
But Special Events has been
given the franchise for all con
temporary concerts on campus in
order to raise revenue for the
ASSU. 'Hiis is a part of the Uni
versity's agreement of five years
ago to decrease the ASSU's sub
sidy and make it a more au
tonomous organization.
It is not easy raising money
from rock concerts, according to
Holt, also the coordinator of the
Lively Arts series at Stanford.
"I would be really disturbed if
the University said to me that I
had to base the Lively Arts prog
ram on a subsidy coming from
rock 'n' roll concerts."
Beneficial aspects
Working as it does within the
confines of the University, Spe
cial Events is not really an inde
pendent promoter. This has
some advantages. Holt said.
Special Events does not have to
work through the stage hands
union since it employs students,
nor does it have to hire techni
cians. The technicians are
supplied at a flat rate by the Pub
lic Services Department, headed
by Bill Cleveland.
Its ticketing is handled
through the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice, and its security comes from
the University police.
"We pay hard costs only, what
it costs to actually produce the
show. We are not paying a rental
fee anytime I do a concert or any
time ASSU does a concert.
That's a major difference," Holt
asserted.
Difficulties persist
Both Harris and Holt agree
there have been some problems
in the system as well as the ad
vantages. But the situation is im
proving.
Harris cited past problems
with the Tresidder Ticket Office,
and Larry Davidson, the ticket
office manager, agreed that in
the past there have been some
"down periods" in the ticket of
fice's service.
"But right now," Davidson
said, "we don't have any prob
lems. We've staffed up now so
that we are able to respond to
phone calls and our lines at the
window, and we are able to put
tickets on sale rapidly."
With only one ticket outlet on
campus. Special Events is forced
to work with the ticket office un
less it sets up its own ticket ser
vice, a prospect Davidson called
unfeasible.
"We're talking about proba
bly $700,000 to $800,000 a year
that we'll be doing worth of busi
ness, and you can't just open up a
table on White Plaza and sell all
the ASSU events. That's impos
sible," he said.
As things stand. Special
Events will continue to have the
franchise on rock and jazz con
certs with final approval on the
appropriateness of the concert
resting with the University. They
will continue to work within the
system already set up.
Lieberman summarized the
University's position on Special
Events promoting concerts:
"From the University
standpoint, the bottom line is
they understand and appreciate
the problems we have, but they
can't do anything about it be
cause we're a peripheral function

Dave Mason is shown playing in Memorial Auditorium during
last fall's Big Game concert sponsored by ASSU Special
Events.
Every rock and jazz concert at
Stanford is brought to you — live
— hy the ASSU Special Events
headed hy John Harris, director
of Special Events, and Lenny
Lieherman, associate director.
Special Events has been so
successful this year that there
will be five concerts in Frost this
spring instead of last year's two.
But Special Events is not like
other rock promoters; it has par
ticular problems peculiar to
being a part of Stanford.
Anticipating a larger roster of
concerts. Special Events applied
for and received holds for the use
of Frost for virtually every
weekend this spring, including
the first three weekends in May.
A hold is a tentative agree
ment between the University's
office of Public Events, which
handles all scheduling of
facilities at Stanford, and the or
ganization that wishes to use the
facility. The hold reserves the
facility for the group on the re
quested day.
A hold, explained Vickie Holt,
the director of Public Events, is a
means of giving ASSU "as many
options for negotiation pos

sibilities as possible." Hut it is
definitely tentative.
Atter receiving the holds for
the weekends in May, Harris
began negotiating for groups to
fill the dates. Liberman
explained what happened next:
"When they (the University)
realized we were going to be able
to deliver a concert every
weekend, the grounds depart
ment called up Public Events
when they found out and said:
'Wait a minute. All those con
certs. Frost is not going to be
maintained properly We will not
be able to water and make it
safety-proof. Frost will not be in
its proper shape for commence
ment.' "
Then, according to Holt, her
office met with the Grounds De
partment to see if some com
promise could be worked out.
After three days of meetings, the
holds were removed for May 17
and IS. Harris feels this action by
the University is damaging to
Special Events.
Reputation damaged
"It hurts us. We have a busi
ness relationship with the out
side world in the music industry.
Our reputation, our credibility,
our professionalism is called into

question tor something over
which we had no control. Ulti
mately it could, not necessarily
will, but could affect our future
ability to deal with these people,
to get the best acts possible to
this campus," he said.
Holt said the mix-up over the
holds points out the loopholes in
the University's system of handl
ing concerts. Plant Services had
underestimated the amount of
time it would need to groom
Frost for commencement.
The ability to prepare Frost
for commencement had not been
an issue. Hold said, in the last
three or four years because Spe
cial Events has not had the
number of concerts it has
scheduled this year.
"The level of productivity al
ways strains any weak points in
the system," Holt said.
Kole conflicts
Harris agrees that the number
of concerts he promotes puts a
strain on the system, but the na
ture of his job, as described by
the University, is raising re
venues for the ASSU. Obvi
ously, the more concerts he pro
motes, the greater ASSU's re
venues. Harris contends that in
the eyes of a booking agency
there is no discrimination bet
ween a foul-up by the Univeristy
and a foul-up by Special Events.
There is a prevailing view
among booking agencies that
colleges are a risk. Often, the
agencies feel, college facilities
are not adequate, and the techni
cal crews are substandard. Harris
said none of this is true here, but
that Special Events constantly
has to deal with the stigma book
ing agencies attach to colleges.
The withdrawal of the holds on
Frost only fuels that opinion in
the minds of the booking agen
cies.
"And what we were saying to
them all year was :'Look, you
can take a chance with us: we're
different from all the rest,' and
then this happened. So they
don't care that Special Events or
that the ASSU didn't mess up,
Stanford messed up. It's a typical
other school; it's a risk. But
again, it's something the Univer
sity had to do. It's not their fault.
It's their fault that they gave us
the facility." Harris said.
Framework
Appreciating this attitude by
the agencies. Holt said she of
fered to speak with the booking
agents and explain the situation.
"ITiings like the hold on Frost,
Holt said, are all part of having to
work within the framework of a
university. ASSU is not an inde
pendent promoter, and it enjoys
certain benefits from that and
suffers from certain detriments.
Working within the
framework is a major problem,
according to Lieherman. "In this
market to get the major acts you
have to come off as a commercial
promoter to the agents. You
have to convince them that this is
a place to do business," he said.
"In turn, the agencies have got to
convince the managers who have
got all these ties in the industry
and to one another and who have
done business with (rock promo
ter Bill) Graham and the other
companies for years.
"Then somebody else, the
University, comes in and says
you're not commercial promot
ers, you're college promoters,
and they are right. But you can't
come off as a college promoter.

Our reputation, our credibility,
our professionalism is called into

question tor something over
which we had no control. Ulti
mately it could, not necessarily
will, but could affect our future
ability to deal with these people,
to get the best acts possible to
this campus," he said.
Holt said the mix-up over the
holds points out the loopholes in
the University's system of handl
ing concerts. Plant Services had
underestimated the amount of
time it would need to groom
Frost for commencement.
The ability to prepare Frost
for commencement had not been
an issue. Hold said, in the last
three or four years because Spe
cial Events has not had the
number of concerts it has
scheduled this year.
"The level of productivity al
ways strains any weak points in
the system," Holt said.
Kole conflicts
Harris agrees that the number
of concerts he promotes puts a
strain on the system, but the na
ture of his job, as described by
the University, is raising re
venues for the ASSU. Obvi
ously, the more concerts he pro
motes, the greater ASSU's re
venues. Harris contends that in
the eyes of a booking agency
there is no discrimination bet
ween a foul-up by the Univeristy
and a foul-up by Special Events.
There is a prevailing view
among booking agencies that
colleges are a risk. Often, the
agencies feel, college facilities
are not adequate, and the techni
cal crews are substandard. Harris
said none of this is true here, but
that Special Events constantly
has to deal with the stigma book
ing agencies attach to colleges.
The withdrawal of the holds on
Frost only fuels that opinion in
the minds of the booking agen
cies.
"And what we were saying to
them all year was :'Look, you
can take a chance with us: we're
different from all the rest,' and
then this happened. So they
don't care that Special Events or
that the ASSU didn't mess up,
Stanford messed up. It's a typical
other school; it's a risk. But
again, it's something the Univer
sity had to do. It's not their fault.
It's their fault that they gave us
the facility." Harris said.
Framework
Appreciating this attitude by
the agencies. Holt said she of
fered to speak with the booking
agents and explain the situation.
"ITiings like the hold on Frost,
Holt said, are all part of having to
work within the framework of a
university. ASSU is not an inde
pendent promoter, and it enjoys
certain benefits from that and
suffers from certain detriments.
Working within the
framework is a major problem,
according to Lieherman. "In this
market to get the major acts you
have to come off as a commercial
promoter to the agents. You
have to convince them that this is
a place to do business," he said.
"In turn, the agencies have got to
convince the managers who have
got all these ties in the industry
and to one another and who have
done business with (rock promo
ter Bill) Graham and the other
companies for years.
"Then somebody else, the
University, comes in and says
you're not commercial promot
ers, you're college promoters,
and they are right. But you can't
come off as a college promoter.

or you'll never get anything."
"We're stuck between a rock
and a hard place," Harris said.
But Special Events has been
given the franchise for all con
temporary concerts on campus in
order to raise revenue for the
ASSU. 'Hiis is a part of the Uni
versity's agreement of five years
ago to decrease the ASSU's sub
sidy and make it a more au
tonomous organization.
It is not easy raising money
from rock concerts, according to
Holt, also the coordinator of the
Lively Arts series at Stanford.
"I would be really disturbed if
the University said to me that I
had to base the Lively Arts prog
ram on a subsidy coming from
rock 'n' roll concerts."
Beneficial aspects
Working as it does within the
confines of the University, Spe
cial Events is not really an inde
pendent promoter. This has
some advantages. Holt said.
Special Events does not have to
work through the stage hands
union since it employs students,
nor does it have to hire techni
cians. The technicians are
supplied at a flat rate by the Pub
lic Services Department, headed
by Bill Cleveland.
Its ticketing is handled
through the Tresidder Ticket Of
fice, and its security comes from
the University police.
"We pay hard costs only, what
it costs to actually produce the
show. We are not paying a rental
fee anytime I do a concert or any
time ASSU does a concert.
That's a major difference," Holt
asserted.
Difficulties persist
Both Harris and Holt agree
there have been some problems
in the system as well as the ad
vantages. But the situation is im
proving.
Harris cited past problems
with the Tresidder Ticket Office,
and Larry Davidson, the ticket
office manager, agreed that in
the past there have been some
"down periods" in the ticket of
fice's service.
"But right now," Davidson
said, "we don't have any prob
lems. We've staffed up now so
that we are able to respond to
phone calls and our lines at the
window, and we are able to put
tickets on sale rapidly."
With only one ticket outlet on
campus. Special Events is forced
to work with the ticket office un
less it sets up its own ticket ser
vice, a prospect Davidson called
unfeasible.
"We're talking about proba
bly $700,000 to $800,000 a year
that we'll be doing worth of busi
ness, and you can't just open up a
table on White Plaza and sell all
the ASSU events. That's impos
sible," he said.
As things stand. Special
Events will continue to have the
franchise on rock and jazz con
certs with final approval on the
appropriateness of the concert
resting with the University. They
will continue to work within the
system already set up.
Lieberman summarized the
University's position on Special
Events promoting concerts:
"From the University
standpoint, the bottom line is
they understand and appreciate
the problems we have, but they
can't do anything about it be
cause we're a peripheral function
of the University."

Every rock and jazz concert at
Stanford is brought to you — live
— hy the ASSU Special Events
headed hy John Harris, director
of Special Events, and Lenny
Lieherman, associate director.
Special Events has been so
successful this year that there
will be five concerts in Frost this
spring instead of last year's two.
But Special Events is not like
other rock promoters; it has par
ticular problems peculiar to
being a part of Stanford.
Anticipating a larger roster of
concerts. Special Events applied
for and received holds for the use
of Frost for virtually every
weekend this spring, including
the first three weekends in May.
A hold is a tentative agree
ment between the University's
office of Public Events, which
handles all scheduling of
facilities at Stanford, and the or
ganization that wishes to use the
facility. The hold reserves the
facility for the group on the re
quested day.
A hold, explained Vickie Holt,
the director of Public Events, is a
means of giving ASSU "as many
options for negotiation pos

sibilities as possible." Hut it is
definitely tentative.
Atter receiving the holds for
the weekends in May, Harris
began negotiating for groups to
fill the dates. Liberman
explained what happened next:
"When they (the University)
realized we were going to be able
to deliver a concert every
weekend, the grounds depart
ment called up Public Events
when they found out and said:
'Wait a minute. All those con
certs. Frost is not going to be
maintained properly We will not
be able to water and make it
safety-proof. Frost will not be in
its proper shape for commence
ment.' "
Then, according to Holt, her
office met with the Grounds De
partment to see if some com
promise could be worked out.
After three days of meetings, the
holds were removed for May 17
and IS. Harris feels this action by
the University is damaging to
Special Events.
Reputation damaged
"It hurts us. We have a busi
ness relationship with the out
side world in the music industry.
Our reputation, our credibility,
our professionalism is called into

question tor something over
which we had no control. Ulti
mately it could, not necessarily
will, but could affect our future
