# Attempt to lower ocean work depth
## Divers plunge 2132 feet down 
### Victor Cohn The Washington Post 
DURHAM, N.C. — The
depth at which mankind can
work in the ocean is about to
double.
In a giant step downward, to
ward the seas' oil. minerals and
other treasures, a Duke Univer
sity scientist has learned to in
crease human divers' practical
working level from today's
common 1000-foot maximum to
2132 feet, or four-tenths of a
mile.
As proof, three happy men
expect to submerge from a
thick-walled high-pressure
chamber at Duke Medical
Center here today after spending
27 days making the world's
deepest simulated dive.
Late yesterday the divers were
practically "at the surface" and
due to exit at X:53 a.m. today.
But there was always the possi
bility of some further delay if any
untoward symptoms appeared.
In real-life deep dives, divers
are often lowered in small tanks
so they can gradually get used to
greater pressure. The tanks are
capable of maintaining the pres
sure so they may be brought up
and decompressed in a tank on
shipboard over many days.
In real dives in the future.
Duke's Dr. Peter Bennett pre
dicted, "I think you could get
down to 1500 feet in 12 hours. I
think you could spend two or
three days at around 2000 feet.
Then I think you could get out ol
a decompression chamber after
seven or eight days."
The key to the achievement is
a new mixture of breathable
gases devised by Bennett. It con
sists of oxygen, helium and —
surprisingly — nitrogen.
In the world of ocean explora
tion, studies in pressuri/ed tanks
have steadily lowered working
depth.
Last December, a U.S. Navy
team made a research dive in a
land chamber in Panama. At just
1500 feet they suffered such se
vere Nervous Syndrome and
weight loss that some are still re
covering.
The membranes of these di
vers' brain cells had simply be
come too tightly packed. Adding
just the right amount of nitrogen,
Bennett found, prevents this.

Much work with humans and
animals led to the formula for the
current dive: 1 0 percent of nitro
gen in the oxygen-helium mix
ture deep-divers breathe.
On March 6. the Duke volun
teers — commercial diver
Stephen Porter. 24; medical stu
dent William Bell. 25.and physi
cian's assistant Delmar (Bud)
Shelton. 40 — entered the two
room diving chamber, an eight
foot ball atop a six-foot wide cy
linder.
Not until March 12 was the air
pressure increased enough to
"lower" them to 1 ,M 4 1 feet.
Then, stage by stage, they were
lowered to 2004, then 2132

feet — 650 meters.
They stayed at the record
depth for 24 hours, doing
mechanical and mental tasks and
reporting that they felt "fine."
Then on March 15 the gradual
decompression began to bring
them back to the "surface"
safely.
All this, said a telegram from
Dr. Jeff Davis, president ot the
Underseas Medical Society, "is
comparable to the landing of the
first astronauts on the moon."
"Your efforts," wired Ocean
Engineering of Houston, "will
open the door to \ ast areas of the
ocean which were previously un
available."

decompression began to bring
them back to the "surface"
safely.
