BRASILIA, Brazil (AP)
The Brazilian automobile
industry began selling cars
powered on almost pure al
cohol to the general public
yesterday. The home-grown
fuel will reduce Brazil's heavy
reliance on imported oil and
will be easier on the con
sumer's pocketbook.
Brazilians now pay $2.15
for a gallon of regular
gasoline, while the alcohol
fuel costs about $1. This price
difference more than offsets
the 20 percent higher fuel
consumption of the new al
cohol engines.
The vast sugar cane crop of
this South American nation is
the source of most of the al
cohol.
The government intends to
substitute about 20 percent of
its 1.2-million-barrel daily oil
consumption with alcohol by
1985. And it is officially esti
mated that Brazil, a nation of
123 million people with 8
million autos, could have al
most 2 million alcohol-motor
cars on the road by 1985, in
cluding older models with
converted engines.
For the past year thousands
of government vehicles have

been running on alcohol, and
selective sales were made to
taxi drivers and others.
Car manufacturers say they
have thousands of orders for
the alcohol-powered cars.
A series of government in
centives are designed to en
courage the purchase of al
cohol cars — including reduc
tions in licensing and road
taxes, and an increase from a
16- to a 36- month limit on
financing.
The alcohol cars, produced
by all five major manufactur
ers in Brazil — Volkswagen,
Fiat. Ford, General Motors
and Chrysler, will be sold at
the same prices as gasoline
powered models.
The new cars run on 96
percent alcohol and 4 percent
water. The engines are
adapted from conventional
gas power by increasing the
compression ratio, setting a
leanerair-to-fuel mixture and
replacing certain rubber and
plastic engine parts that
would corrode with alcohol's
solvent action.
Thegasohoi sold in the Un
ited States generally is a mix
ture of 90 percent gasoline
and 10 percent alcohol, much
of it made from corn.
