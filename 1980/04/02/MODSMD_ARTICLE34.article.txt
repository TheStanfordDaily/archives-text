# New Yorkers fight transit strike
## 
### 
NEW YORK (AP) — The largest rapid transit
strike in the nation's history shut down all bus and
subway lines in New York City yesterday, but the
city's 7.5 million people made the "unthinkable"
work.
For the most part, they got to work, in an expedi
tion to Manhattan one Wall Street businessman
described as like the British amphibious evacua
tion of Dunkirk in World War 11.
The work stoppage by 35,000 transit workers
was compounded by a simultaneous stnke by 6200
employees of the Long Island Rail Road, which
serves heavily populated suburbs of 2.7 million
people.
"The unthinkable has happened and now we
have to figure out how to live with the unthinkable
and we will." declared Mayor Edward Koch.
"Life will go on and we will do whatever has to
be done."
So commuters by the tens of thousands walked,
rode bicycles and skated to work. They pooled
their cars and chartered buses, boats and airplanes
to get to Manhattan.
Already the strike has given birth to a new un
iform for the working man — a three piece suit and
running shoes. One after another, pairs of feet shod
in red. yellow, blue and orange strolled where ox
fords and wingtips usually are seen.
Koch said that 25,000 people bicycled to work,
and long lines at bike stores of people seeking
repairs for machines just retrieved from basements
indicated the number will grow. About 30,000
walked into Manhattan. Koch said.
The mayor, a strong advocate of a tough bargain
ing stand against the Transport Workers because
he must negotiate with the city unions this summer
and does not want to be under pressure to match
any large transit settlement, met walkers and bikes
on the Brooklyn Bridge during the morning rush
hour to urge them on.
A New York law makes strikes by public
employees illegal and imposes mandatory fines of
two days pay for each day a worker stays out. Jail
terms can be given to union leaders, and the union
treasury loses the roughly $100,000 a week in dues
checkoffs paid to it by management.
Union leader John Lane, who announced the
strike, has said a strike may destroy his union and
bring great hardship to individual members.

Even in running shoes. New Yorkers are un
likely to dodge the discomforts of traffic jams and
the pain of business losses for very long, and when
the subways and buses start running again
everyone knows that they will cost more — perhaps
as much as 75 cents instead of the 50 cent ride that
was available until early this morning.
While many of the city's larger companies, which
had prepared for the emergency, said most workers
were on the job, others saw their staffs depleted.
Koch said his operations office estimated 25,000
rode bicycles to their jobs in Manhattan, another
30,000 walked and 10.000 to 12,000 arrived by
boat.
The Jewish holiday of Passover and the Easter
school recess eased the impact, but officials warned
"the crunch" would come today.
Like other large companies. American Express
spent about $200,000 to rent bicycles, buses, cars
and to charter a boat to make sure its 4000
employees made it to work.
On the other hand, a small management firm
which employs 26 people, mostly accountants, said
only eight people turned up for work yesterday.
Four of them were management personnel.
No peace talks were scheduled in either strike,
both launched in wage disputes with the state's
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, an um
brella transit agency.
The walkout by the Transit Workers Union was
estimated to be costing the city's economy $140
million a day.
The city transit system collects 5.2 million 50-
cent fares a day, many of them from roundtrip
riders. The Long Island Raid Road collects
270,000 daily fares.
It was the first New York City subway-bus strike
since a 12-day walkout in 1966, and the first time
the LIRR has been struck simultaneously with the
city system.
Midtown traffic moved relatively smoothly, but
was backed up for five miles on approaches to the
Oueensboro Bridge, a main point of entry to Man
hattan from Queens and Long Island. Ice repor
tedly slowed inbound traffic generally before the
sun cleared it off.
At the tip of Manhattan, sea and air were as
warm with fishing smacks, tourist launches, seap
lanes and helicopters bringing an estimated 10,000
to 12,000 commuters to work.

the LIRR has been struck simultaneously with the
city system.
Midtown traffic moved relatively smoothly, but
was backed up for five miles on approaches to the
Oueensboro Bridge, a main point of entry to Man
hattan from Queens and Long Island. Ice repor
tedly slowed inbound traffic generally before the
sun cleared it off.
At the tip of Manhattan, sea and air were as
warm with fishing smacks, tourist launches, seap
lanes and helicopters bringing an estimated 10,000
to 12,000 commuters to work.

NEW YORK (AP) — The largest rapid transit
strike in the nation's history shut down all bus and
subway lines in New York City yesterday, but the
city's 7.5 million people made the "unthinkable"
work.
For the most part, they got to work, in an expedi
tion to Manhattan one Wall Street businessman
described as like the British amphibious evacua
tion of Dunkirk in World War 11.
The work stoppage by 35,000 transit workers
was compounded by a simultaneous stnke by 6200
employees of the Long Island Rail Road, which
serves heavily populated suburbs of 2.7 million
people.
"The unthinkable has happened and now we
have to figure out how to live with the unthinkable
and we will." declared Mayor Edward Koch.
"Life will go on and we will do whatever has to
be done."
So commuters by the tens of thousands walked,
rode bicycles and skated to work. They pooled
their cars and chartered buses, boats and airplanes
to get to Manhattan.
Already the strike has given birth to a new un
iform for the working man — a three piece suit and
running shoes. One after another, pairs of feet shod
in red. yellow, blue and orange strolled where ox
fords and wingtips usually are seen.
Koch said that 25,000 people bicycled to work,
and long lines at bike stores of people seeking
repairs for machines just retrieved from basements
indicated the number will grow. About 30,000
walked into Manhattan. Koch said.
The mayor, a strong advocate of a tough bargain
ing stand against the Transport Workers because
he must negotiate with the city unions this summer
and does not want to be under pressure to match
any large transit settlement, met walkers and bikes
on the Brooklyn Bridge during the morning rush
hour to urge them on.
A New York law makes strikes by public
employees illegal and imposes mandatory fines of
two days pay for each day a worker stays out. Jail
terms can be given to union leaders, and the union
treasury loses the roughly $100,000 a week in dues
checkoffs paid to it by management.
Union leader John Lane, who announced the
strike, has said a strike may destroy his union and
bring great hardship to individual members.

Even in running shoes. New Yorkers are un
likely to dodge the discomforts of traffic jams and
the pain of business losses for very long, and when
the subways and buses start running again
everyone knows that they will cost more — perhaps
as much as 75 cents instead of the 50 cent ride that
was available until early this morning.
While many of the city's larger companies, which
had prepared for the emergency, said most workers
were on the job, others saw their staffs depleted.
Koch said his operations office estimated 25,000
rode bicycles to their jobs in Manhattan, another
30,000 walked and 10.000 to 12,000 arrived by
boat.
The Jewish holiday of Passover and the Easter
school recess eased the impact, but officials warned
"the crunch" would come today.
Like other large companies. American Express
spent about $200,000 to rent bicycles, buses, cars
and to charter a boat to make sure its 4000
employees made it to work.
On the other hand, a small management firm
which employs 26 people, mostly accountants, said
only eight people turned up for work yesterday.
Four of them were management personnel.
No peace talks were scheduled in either strike,
both launched in wage disputes with the state's
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, an um
brella transit agency.
The walkout by the Transit Workers Union was
estimated to be costing the city's economy $140
million a day.
The city transit system collects 5.2 million 50-
cent fares a day, many of them from roundtrip
riders. The Long Island Raid Road collects
270,000 daily fares.
It was the first New York City subway-bus strike
since a 12-day walkout in 1966, and the first time
the LIRR has been struck simultaneously with the
city system.
