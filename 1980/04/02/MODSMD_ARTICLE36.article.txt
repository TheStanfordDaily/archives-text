## Rebels halt Card 9 streak 
### Peter Finch Sports Editor 
In what might rightly be
termed "a game of missed op
portunities," the Stanford
baseball team dropped an 8-4
decision to the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels yes
terday at Sunken Diamond.
Twelve Stanford runners were
left stranded on base during the
game. The Cards seemed to
come up with enough hits to win,
13, but could rarely produce
them when they were most
needed.
But there was more to the
game than just missed oppor
tunities. A disastrous seventh
inning, where three runs scored
on two costly Cardinal errors,
didn't exactly help Stanford's
cause, either.
UNLV's Ed Crow opened the
seventh with a single over second
base. Ray Perry followed with a
beautiful bunt down the third
base line, advancing Crow and

getting himself on first with a
single. Outfielder Dan Murphy
bunted again, this time to Stan
ford pitcher Mike Sullivan. Sulli
van retired Murphy at first, while
the two runners each advanced a
base.
Then the real trouble began.
Rebel Bill Max stepped to the
plate and blooped a wind
pushed single into center. Out
fielder Mike Toothman made
the play on the ball, throwing
home to catcher Mike Freitas.
But the ball got by Freitas, allow
ing both Crow and Perry to
score, and bringing Max around
second and on towards third.
Stanford's Sullivan, backing up
Freitas, retrieved the ball and
threw down to third. His throw
was errant, got by third baseman
Bob DeCosta, and let Max score
easily.
Stanford's chances of catching
up were now slim. Behind 8-3.
the Cards were running out of
time. Coming back with several

runs in the bottom of the inning
would have helped matters con
siderably, but one was all they
could get.
Outfielder John Elwav led off
for the Cards with a single into
left field. Second baseman Paul
Zuvella, batting a healthy .320,
followed with a single to center.
Elway moved to third when
Dave Meier, batting .330, tlied
to deep right, and came home
when catcher Bill Worden rip
ped a double to the left field wall.
First baseman Loring Davies
walked next to load the bases,
and it looked like the Cards just
might get the runs they needed to
get back in the game. With a 2-1
count, Toothman pulled a cur
veball deep into left field, but it
curled foul. Going to a full count,
Toothman grounded into an
inning-ending, hope-shattering
double play. It was the Cards'
fourth double play of the contest.
