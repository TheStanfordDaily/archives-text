## Rebels halt Card 9 streak 
### Peter Finch Sports Editor 
In what might rightly be
termed "a game of missed op
portunities," the Stanford
baseball team dropped an 8-4
decision to the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels yes
terday at Sunken Diamond.
Twelve Stanford runners were
left stranded on base during the
game. The Cards seemed to
come up with enough hits to win,
13, but could rarely produce
them when they were most
needed.
But there was more to the
game than just missed oppor
tunities. A disastrous seventh
inning, where three runs scored
on two costly Cardinal errors,
didn't exactly help Stanford's
cause, either.
UNLV's Ed Crow opened the
seventh with a single over second
base. Ray Perry followed with a
beautiful bunt down the third
base line, advancing Crow and

getting himself on first with a
single. Outfielder Dan Murphy
bunted again, this time to Stan
ford pitcher Mike Sullivan. Sulli
van retired Murphy at first, while
the two runners each advanced a
base.
Then the real trouble began.
Rebel Bill Max stepped to the
plate and blooped a wind
pushed single into center. Out
fielder Mike Toothman made
the play on the ball, throwing
home to catcher Mike Freitas.
But the ball got by Freitas, allow
ing both Crow and Perry to
score, and bringing Max around
second and on towards third.
Stanford's Sullivan, backing up
Freitas, retrieved the ball and
threw down to third. His throw
was errant, got by third baseman
Bob DeCosta, and let Max score
easily.
Stanford's chances of catching
up were now slim. Behind 8-3.
the Cards were running out of
time. Coming back with several

runs in the bottom of the inning
would have helped matters con
siderably, but one was all they
could get.
Outfielder John Elwav led off
for the Cards with a single into
left field. Second baseman Paul
Zuvella, batting a healthy .320,
followed with a single to center.
Elway moved to third when
Dave Meier, batting .330, tlied
to deep right, and came home
when catcher Bill Worden rip
ped a double to the left field wall.
First baseman Loring Davies
walked next to load the bases,
and it looked like the Cards just
might get the runs they needed to
get back in the game. With a 2-1
count, Toothman pulled a cur
veball deep into left field, but it
curled foul. Going to a full count,
Toothman grounded into an
inning-ending, hope-shattering
double play. It was the Cards'
fourth double play of the contest.

hits," Stanford head coach Mark
Marquess said, explaining what
had happened. "Except for the
one inning when we had the two
errors, we played good defense.
And they (UNLV) hit well, too."
That they did, though they to
talled one less hit than Stanford
with twelve. The Rebels were far
more hit-efficient than the
Cards, though, and that's exactly
what made the difference.
In other words, they got their
hits when they needed them.
UNLV got on the scoreboard
first, when in the second inning,
first baseman Randy Ward rip
ped his tenth home run of the
year over the 400 foot mark in
center field.
Stanford's starting pitcher,
George Lopez, had some control
problems early in the game,
skidding several balls past
catcher Freitas. But, remaining
composed, Lopez retired the
Rebels in the second with only
one run in.
At the beginning of the third,
Lopez was replaced by sopho
more Mike Sullivan. While ap
pearing more controlled. Sulli
van did allow three UNLV runs
in the inning. The Rebels' Max
was the man largely responsible
for scoring, blasting a three run
homer over the left field fence
with two outs and men on second
and third.

Down 4-0, the Cards came up
with their first run in the bottom
of the third. When Zuvella
reached first on a throwing error
by Rebel shortstop Max, and
stole second for his seventeenth
time in 21 attempts, he was
brought home by Meier, who
doubled into deep right field.
UNLV added two more runs
in the fourth, connecting solidly
on new Stanford pitcher Lee
Cline's offerings. First, the Re
bels' Doug Smith doubled to left,
and Dave Kinsel singled to left
center. Frank De Santis then
flew to left, scoring Smith from
third.
The Cards left two men on in
the fourth, and two more in the
fifth, but could not score. Finally,
in the sixth, they got a couple
of runs. Toothman doubled into
left, scoring Davies from first.
Frietas followed with a high fly to
center. The wind toyed with the
ball, making it difficult for center
fielder Ward to judge. When he
finally tracked it down, he drop
ped it. In the meantime. Tooth
man headed for third. Ward's
throw was off, and rolled to
wards the Nevada dugout.
Toothman scored standing up.
Stanford's Lopez was credited
with the loss, and is now 1-3.
UNLV's Ken Elsee, now 9-1 .got
the win.

Rebels in the second with only
one run in.
At the beginning of the third,
Lopez was replaced by sopho
more Mike Sullivan. While ap
pearing more controlled. Sulli
van did allow three UNLV runs
in the inning. The Rebels' Max
was the man largely responsible
for scoring, blasting a three run
homer over the left field fence
with two outs and men on second
and third.

Down 4-0, the Cards came up
with their first run in the bottom
of the third. When Zuvella
reached first on a throwing error
by Rebel shortstop Max, and
stole second for his seventeenth
time in 21 attempts, he was
brought home by Meier, who
doubled into deep right field.
UNLV added two more runs
in the fourth, connecting solidly
on new Stanford pitcher Lee
Cline's offerings. First, the Re
bels' Doug Smith doubled to left,
and Dave Kinsel singled to left
center. Frank De Santis then
flew to left, scoring Smith from
third.
The Cards left two men on in
the fourth, and two more in the
fifth, but could not score. Finally,
in the sixth, they got a couple
of runs. Toothman doubled into
left, scoring Davies from first.
Frietas followed with a high fly to
center. The wind toyed with the
ball, making it difficult for center
fielder Ward to judge. When he
finally tracked it down, he drop
ped it. In the meantime. Tooth
man headed for third. Ward's
throw was off, and rolled to
wards the Nevada dugout.
Toothman scored standing up.
Stanford's Lopez was credited
with the loss, and is now 1-3.
UNLV's Ken Elsee, now 9-1 .got
the win.
In what might rightly be
termed "a game of missed op
portunities," the Stanford
baseball team dropped an 8-4
decision to the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas Rebels yes
terday at Sunken Diamond.
Twelve Stanford runners were
left stranded on base during the
game. The Cards seemed to
come up with enough hits to win,
13, but could rarely produce
them when they were most
needed.
But there was more to the
game than just missed oppor
tunities. A disastrous seventh
inning, where three runs scored
on two costly Cardinal errors,
didn't exactly help Stanford's
cause, either.
UNLV's Ed Crow opened the
seventh with a single over second
base. Ray Perry followed with a
beautiful bunt down the third
base line, advancing Crow and

getting himself on first with a
single. Outfielder Dan Murphy
bunted again, this time to Stan
ford pitcher Mike Sullivan. Sulli
van retired Murphy at first, while
the two runners each advanced a
base.
Then the real trouble began.
Rebel Bill Max stepped to the
plate and blooped a wind
pushed single into center. Out
fielder Mike Toothman made
the play on the ball, throwing
home to catcher Mike Freitas.
But the ball got by Freitas, allow
ing both Crow and Perry to
score, and bringing Max around
second and on towards third.
Stanford's Sullivan, backing up
Freitas, retrieved the ball and
threw down to third. His throw
was errant, got by third baseman
Bob DeCosta, and let Max score
easily.
Stanford's chances of catching
up were now slim. Behind 8-3.
the Cards were running out of
time. Coming back with several

runs in the bottom of the inning
would have helped matters con
siderably, but one was all they
could get.
Outfielder John Elwav led off
for the Cards with a single into
left field. Second baseman Paul
Zuvella, batting a healthy .320,
followed with a single to center.
Elway moved to third when
Dave Meier, batting .330, tlied
to deep right, and came home
when catcher Bill Worden rip
ped a double to the left field wall.
First baseman Loring Davies
walked next to load the bases,
and it looked like the Cards just
might get the runs they needed to
get back in the game. With a 2-1
count, Toothman pulled a cur
veball deep into left field, but it
curled foul. Going to a full count,
Toothman grounded into an
inning-ending, hope-shattering
double play. It was the Cards'
fourth double play of the contest.
