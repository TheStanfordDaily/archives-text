## King Games: focus on the Olympics 
### 
In the wake ot all the talk about Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's U.S. boycott plans of
the Moscow Olympics, the Martin Luther
King International Freedom Games went
on in Stanford Stadium over the vacation.
And they were a huge success, a tribute to
the hundreds of world class athletes who
will not be going to Moscow.
Lite King Games, held on the weekend
following finals week, acutely focused the
tragedy of the coming Olympic summer.
The pure fluid beauty of Huston McTear
running his leg of the 440 relay or
Franklin Jacobs clearing the high jump
bar at 7-foot-4 made one wonder what
mankind is coming to when its childlike
balance-of-power struggle could become
so tenuous as to destroy a forum for such
art.
The Games were colorful and exciting
and ran like clockwork behind the an
nouncing of former Olympic and Stanford
star Bob Mathias. But track is a funny
sport. There aren't a lot of cheerleaders
and beer-drinking fans screaming at their
heads. In fact, Mathias repeatedly asked
the fans at the stadium to sit down so
everyone could see. It was all very
civilized.
That probably has to do with the indi
vidual nature of the sport. Each athlete is
competing for himself more than for a
team and that makes the struggle more
outwardly subtle because it is so personal.

To be great at track is an intense commit
ment to one's self. To be an Olympic star
is to devote oneself entirely to the sport.
These athletes were mostly quiet and in
troverted around the track as they went
about their business. It was a quiet of total
immersion.
One guy I saw sat and stretched himself
out for about half an hour or more wear
ing three sweatsuits in the 75 degree
weather. Franklin Jacobs put on his USA
sweats between jumps and paced up and
down looking nervously around, thinking
private thoughts about his sport which is
the most important thing in his life.
"I have butterflies for two hours during
a meet," Jacobs said. "The pressure's not
off until the meet is over."
All these athletes feel that way. They all
walk around the infield looking kind of
calm yet winding up that spring inside
which they have learned to manipulate
after years of practice. Their quirks of
preparation, their stretching and meditat
ing, get them ready for that meet which is
so important at that moment. It's one
more step towards the quintessence of
their careers: the Olympics.
At one point during the King Games,
Mathias got on the microphone and re
minded all the world class athletes present
that they must register for the Olympic
trials in Eugene, Oregon and that forms
for registering were at the scorers table.

Jacobs commented after he won the high
jump that maybe the fact that the trials
are being held at all is significant.
"They're still holding the trials for
sure," he said. "Maybe the Olympic
committee knows something we don't."
Anyway, if the Russians pull out at all,
they'll do it at the last minute because
Carter has given an ultimatum. It would
look bad for them to pull out right away."
They can't believe it's really going to
happen. They have an enthusiasm and op
timism that comes from wanting some
thing so badly for so long that seeing it slip
out of reach is unthinkable. They won't let
themselves believe it.
Jacobs is only one of a great number of
athletes who have found an identity
through world class sports. The high jump
has pulled him out of Floridian obscurity
where he was a little guy dunking basket
balls. It has made him a star and changed
his life.
"Height is measured from a state of
mind," Jacobs said at the Games. "I may
be 5-8 but I feel 6-6 sometimes."
But so much of that spirit will be taken
away with the Olympics this summer. All
the ifs about the boycott seem to be dis
appearing daily. The worst part is that
with the political jousting sure to follow
any kind of boycott there is no guarantee
that there will be an Olympics in '84
either.

be 5-8 but I feel 6-6 sometimes."
But so much of that spirit will be taken
away with the Olympics this summer. All
the ifs about the boycott seem to be dis
appearing daily. The worst part is that
with the political jousting sure to follow
any kind of boycott there is no guarantee
that there will be an Olympics in '84
either.
In the wake ot all the talk about Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's U.S. boycott plans of
the Moscow Olympics, the Martin Luther
King International Freedom Games went
on in Stanford Stadium over the vacation.
And they were a huge success, a tribute to
the hundreds of world class athletes who
will not be going to Moscow.
Lite King Games, held on the weekend
following finals week, acutely focused the
tragedy of the coming Olympic summer.
The pure fluid beauty of Huston McTear
running his leg of the 440 relay or
Franklin Jacobs clearing the high jump
bar at 7-foot-4 made one wonder what
mankind is coming to when its childlike
balance-of-power struggle could become
so tenuous as to destroy a forum for such
art.
The Games were colorful and exciting
and ran like clockwork behind the an
nouncing of former Olympic and Stanford
star Bob Mathias. But track is a funny
sport. There aren't a lot of cheerleaders
and beer-drinking fans screaming at their
heads. In fact, Mathias repeatedly asked
the fans at the stadium to sit down so
everyone could see. It was all very
civilized.
That probably has to do with the indi
vidual nature of the sport. Each athlete is
competing for himself more than for a
team and that makes the struggle more
outwardly subtle because it is so personal.

To be great at track is an intense commit
ment to one's self. To be an Olympic star
is to devote oneself entirely to the sport.
These athletes were mostly quiet and in
troverted around the track as they went
about their business. It was a quiet of total
immersion.
One guy I saw sat and stretched himself
out for about half an hour or more wear
ing three sweatsuits in the 75 degree
weather. Franklin Jacobs put on his USA
sweats between jumps and paced up and
down looking nervously around, thinking
private thoughts about his sport which is
the most important thing in his life.
"I have butterflies for two hours during
a meet," Jacobs said. "The pressure's not
off until the meet is over."
All these athletes feel that way. They all
walk around the infield looking kind of
calm yet winding up that spring inside
which they have learned to manipulate
after years of practice. Their quirks of
preparation, their stretching and meditat
ing, get them ready for that meet which is
so important at that moment. It's one
more step towards the quintessence of
their careers: the Olympics.
At one point during the King Games,
Mathias got on the microphone and re
minded all the world class athletes present
that they must register for the Olympic
trials in Eugene, Oregon and that forms
for registering were at the scorers table.

Jacobs commented after he won the high
jump that maybe the fact that the trials
are being held at all is significant.
"They're still holding the trials for
sure," he said. "Maybe the Olympic
committee knows something we don't."
Anyway, if the Russians pull out at all,
they'll do it at the last minute because
Carter has given an ultimatum. It would
look bad for them to pull out right away."
They can't believe it's really going to
happen. They have an enthusiasm and op
timism that comes from wanting some
thing so badly for so long that seeing it slip
out of reach is unthinkable. They won't let
themselves believe it.
Jacobs is only one of a great number of
athletes who have found an identity
through world class sports. The high jump
has pulled him out of Floridian obscurity
where he was a little guy dunking basket
balls. It has made him a star and changed
his life.
"Height is measured from a state of
mind," Jacobs said at the Games. "I may
be 5-8 but I feel 6-6 sometimes."
But so much of that spirit will be taken
away with the Olympics this summer. All
the ifs about the boycott seem to be dis
appearing daily. The worst part is that
with the political jousting sure to follow
any kind of boycott there is no guarantee
that there will be an Olympics in '84
either.
