# Baseball players vote for strike
## 
### 
DALLAS (AP) — In a move aimed di
rectly at the wallets of baseball's owners, the
Major League Player's Association voted
unanimously yesterday to cancel the remain
ing 92 exhibition games and threatened to go
on strike around May 22 unless a new ag
reement is signed by that time.
The 26 player representatives said they
would open the season on time. remo\ ingthe
threat of a walkout on April 9. In its place,
however, the players plan to cut into substan
tial management income that would have
been generated by the remaining exhibitions.
" We refuse to allow them to generate any
more money before opening day," said Mike
Marshall of the Minnesota Twins, the
American League Player rep. "We'll hurt
them the most by going out May 22, right
before Memorial Day. We are trying to hurt
them in the pocketbook, as deeply as we
can," said Marshall.
Meanwhile. Kenneth Moffett, deputy di
rector of the federal Mediation and Concilia
tion Service in Washington, said both sides
have agreed to meet for talks tomorrow in
New York. No time or location was set for
the meeting.
"We continue to believe that an early re
solution of the differences between the
players and the owners is possible and we will
be making every effort to bring that about."
Moffett said.
The decision on whether the players will
remain in training camp seems to be up to
management. According to their representa
tives. the players are prepared to remain in
camp, work out and even play intrasquad
games to stay in shape.
"If they ask us to stay in camp and to work

under their auspices they must continue to
pay expenses and per diems," said Marshall.
The decision did not affect exhibition
games scheduled for last night but wiped out
42 games which remained before opening
day, April 9. Included in that number was a
lucrative freeway series between the Califor
nia Angels and Los Angeles Dodgers, which
had been expected to provide a large amount
of revenue for both teams.
No further negotiating sessions were
scheduled, but both sides remained on call by
a federal mediator, who entered the talks
Sunday in Palm Springs, Calif.
In New York, the owners' Player Rela
tions Committee released the following
statement:
"We have no comments with respect from
the news reports from Dallas and will have
none until the Player Relations Committee is
officially notified by the players association
of the action taken today.
"As you know, negotiations were recessed
Sunday e\ ening subject to recall by the fed
eral mediator, Mr. Ken Moffett. Therefore
any comments regarding future negotiations
should at this time come from Moffett.
"The position of major league baseball
remains as it has been throughout these
negotiations and that is to seek and achieve a
negotiated settlement that is in the interests
of the players, the clubs and the fans."
Yesterday's decision followed 20 weeks of
what Miller described as fruitless negotia
tions. "Their (management's) strategy has
been to provoke a strike and to portray
themselves as the wounded party," Miller
said. "Owner demands, not player proposals.

have bogged down our meetings. We have
spent 95 percent of our time on two owner
proposals — salary scales and free agent
compensation."
The owners withdrew their salary scale
demand two weeks ago hut have remained
adamant about getting players to agree to a
compensation clause attached to free agency.
•'I had nothing to present to the players
here," Miller said, "not even the outline of a
possible settlement. We have had no re
sponses to our proposals."
The decision came eight years to the day
and in the same city where the players in
itiated the only general player strike to date
in major league history. That 1972 walkout
over pension and health benefits lasted 13
days and caused N6 games to be postponed.
Miller and Ray Grebey, representing
management, have been trying to build a new
basic agreement to replace the one which
expired Dec. 31, 1979. The basic agreement
outlines general working conditions for the
players and includes the revolutionary tree
agent provisions which permit veteran
players to move from one team to another.
Owners have demanded a compensation
clause allowing teams that lose free agent
players to receive replacements from clubs
who sign those players.
Miller and the players association have bit
terly opposed any such compensation, fear
ing it would restrict the marketplace and re
strict the marketplace and result in the type
of limited free agency which professional
football players have.
