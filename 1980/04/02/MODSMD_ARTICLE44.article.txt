# Netwomen finish 5th in BYU tourney
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
A young, high-spirited, and
undefeated Stanford women's
tennis team went into the
Brigham Young Invitational
Tennis Tournament at Provo,
Utah last weekend and clashed
with the other top five tennis
teams in the nation — UCLA,
USC, Brigham Young Univer
sity, Florida and Trinity.
After five grueling matches
and a fifth place finish, Stanford
coach Frank Brennan lamented,
"I'm just glad UCLA showed up
for the tournament."
Stanford edged UCLA 5-4 on
the first day of the tournament as
the Bruins tumbled into last
place among the powerful six
clubs.
Brennan was pleased with the
team's performance just as he
was for all three early matches.

"I'm pleased with our match
against UCLA — we played
pretty well. Actually, UCLA was
a lot better than I expected."
The next day, the Cards had to
face the number one team in the
nation and the eventual winner
in the tournament, USC.
The Trojans compiled a de
ceiving 7-2 victory— a score that
was not a clear indication of the
tenseness of the match. The
Cards jumped out and picked up
singles victories by Alicia Moul
ton and Donna Rubin in the
number one and two singles
spots.
Sue Rasmussen played Nina
Voidat in a tense three-setter in
the number four spot and Julia
Leighton played a tight match
with Sheila Mclnerney in the
fifth spot before both lost in
heartbreaking matches.
Brennan noted that all

matches were close in doubles,
too. Rubin and Caryn Copeland,
who was bothered all weekend
by stomach cramps, jumped out
to a 5-0 lead in the first set of
their match against Mclnerney
and Anna Maria Fernandez be
fore losing seven straight games.
They then came back from a 5-1
deficit in the second set only to
lose 7-6.
The following night Stanford
faced second place finisher BYU
and played what Brennan called
"the best tennis we played in the
whole tournament."
Again fate was not with the
Cards. After picking up a win in
the number one spot behind
Moulton, they dropped the
match 6-3. "Donna really played
a good match for us, but the
stomach cramps were really
starting to affect Caryn," Bren
nan said.

After playing inspired tennis
against BYU until 3 a.m. the
Cards had to face Florida seven
hours later.
"We were flat as a pancake the
next day against Florida," said
Brennan. "They are a very na
tient team — one that take* 15
minutes for every point. Just the
exact team we would not have
liked to meet."
Moulton again picked up an
early win for the Cards, but
Rubin lost and halfway through
her match, Copeland had to de
fault to Ilene Friedland. She had
beaten Friedland 6-0, 6-1 last
summer.
" My stomach just hurt so bad I
thought I was going to die,"
Copeland explained. "I couldn't
breathe. I wanted to play, but I
couldn't get off the ground."
Brennan was obviously dis
pleased with the performance
and said, "We were just too tired
— too flat. 1 think we had a bet
ter team, not by much, but a bet
ter team."
In their final match of the
weekend. Stanford was again
demoralized by a weaker Trinity
team 6-3. "Trinity was one of the
weakest teams," commented

Brennan. "We were clearly bet
ter, but we promptly went down
to defeat. Alicia lost to Mary Lou
Piatek who had rivaled through
out her entire junior career. She
hud just beaten her in the U.S.
Open Junior Championships last
fall." That close loss reflected on
the whole match.
"It was a very grueling week,"
Brennan concluded. "We played
all the better teams first when we
were fresh, at a time when we
weren't quite good enough to
beat them. Then when we were
tired we played the weaker
teams. It's just too bad that the
California Invitational
(scheduled April 10 to 12 at
Berkeley) was canceled. It's a
good tournament and we would
have had a chance to replay some
of our matches. 1 would like to
playBYU down here. We played
them at high elevation at night
indoors, in front of their home
crowd. I'd like to get a crack at
them down here in sunny
California."
Stanford's next match is at
USC April 4 and they don't play
at home until April 14 against
Santa Clara. Brennan would like
toslate a dual with B YU here but
doesn't think they'll make the
trip, so for now, at least, he'll
have to settle for UCLA.

summer.
" My stomach just hurt so bad I
thought I was going to die,"
Copeland explained. "I couldn't
breathe. I wanted to play, but I
couldn't get off the ground."
Brennan was obviously dis
pleased with the performance
and said, "We were just too tired
— too flat. 1 think we had a bet
ter team, not by much, but a bet
ter team."
In their final match of the
weekend. Stanford was again
demoralized by a weaker Trinity
team 6-3. "Trinity was one of the
weakest teams," commented

Brennan. "We were clearly bet
ter, but we promptly went down
to defeat. Alicia lost to Mary Lou
Piatek who had rivaled through
out her entire junior career. She
hud just beaten her in the U.S.
Open Junior Championships last
fall." That close loss reflected on
the whole match.
"It was a very grueling week,"
Brennan concluded. "We played
all the better teams first when we
were fresh, at a time when we
weren't quite good enough to
beat them. Then when we were
tired we played the weaker
teams. It's just too bad that the
California Invitational
(scheduled April 10 to 12 at
Berkeley) was canceled. It's a
good tournament and we would
have had a chance to replay some
of our matches. 1 would like to
playBYU down here. We played
them at high elevation at night
indoors, in front of their home
crowd. I'd like to get a crack at
them down here in sunny
California."
Stanford's next match is at
USC April 4 and they don't play
at home until April 14 against
Santa Clara. Brennan would like
toslate a dual with B YU here but
doesn't think they'll make the
trip, so for now, at least, he'll
have to settle for UCLA.
A young, high-spirited, and
undefeated Stanford women's
tennis team went into the
Brigham Young Invitational
Tennis Tournament at Provo,
Utah last weekend and clashed
with the other top five tennis
teams in the nation — UCLA,
USC, Brigham Young Univer
sity, Florida and Trinity.
After five grueling matches
and a fifth place finish, Stanford
coach Frank Brennan lamented,
"I'm just glad UCLA showed up
for the tournament."
Stanford edged UCLA 5-4 on
the first day of the tournament as
the Bruins tumbled into last
place among the powerful six
clubs.
Brennan was pleased with the
team's performance just as he
was for all three early matches.

"I'm pleased with our match
against UCLA — we played
pretty well. Actually, UCLA was
a lot better than I expected."
The next day, the Cards had to
face the number one team in the
nation and the eventual winner
in the tournament, USC.
The Trojans compiled a de
ceiving 7-2 victory— a score that
was not a clear indication of the
tenseness of the match. The
Cards jumped out and picked up
singles victories by Alicia Moul
ton and Donna Rubin in the
number one and two singles
spots.
Sue Rasmussen played Nina
Voidat in a tense three-setter in
the number four spot and Julia
Leighton played a tight match
with Sheila Mclnerney in the
fifth spot before both lost in
heartbreaking matches.
Brennan noted that all

matches were close in doubles,
too. Rubin and Caryn Copeland,
who was bothered all weekend
by stomach cramps, jumped out
to a 5-0 lead in the first set of
their match against Mclnerney
and Anna Maria Fernandez be
fore losing seven straight games.
They then came back from a 5-1
deficit in the second set only to
lose 7-6.
The following night Stanford
faced second place finisher BYU
and played what Brennan called
"the best tennis we played in the
whole tournament."
Again fate was not with the
Cards. After picking up a win in
the number one spot behind
Moulton, they dropped the
match 6-3. "Donna really played
a good match for us, but the
stomach cramps were really
starting to affect Caryn," Bren
nan said.

After playing inspired tennis
against BYU until 3 a.m. the
Cards had to face Florida seven
hours later.
"We were flat as a pancake the
next day against Florida," said
Brennan. "They are a very na
tient team — one that take* 15
minutes for every point. Just the
exact team we would not have
liked to meet."
Moulton again picked up an
early win for the Cards, but
Rubin lost and halfway through
her match, Copeland had to de
fault to Ilene Friedland. She had
beaten Friedland 6-0, 6-1 last
summer.
" My stomach just hurt so bad I
thought I was going to die,"
Copeland explained. "I couldn't
breathe. I wanted to play, but I
couldn't get off the ground."
