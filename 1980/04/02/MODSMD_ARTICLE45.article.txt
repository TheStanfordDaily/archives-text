# Men's tennis meets no.1 Cal
## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Leaving pre-season play with
a 7-1 record and ranked No. 2 in
the nation, Stanford's men's ten
nis team will begin their tough
Pac-10 schedule today with a
grudge match against No.
1-ranked UC-Berkeley on the
Bear's home court. So far the
cross-Bay rivalry had produced
superb tennis and close competi
tion as Cal edged Stanford in
the National Indoor finals while
the Cards nicked Cal 28-27 in
the Northern California Intercol
legiates
A key to the "Big Match"
should be the play of the bottom
three men for Stanford. In the
loss to Cal, the Cards lost the
four, five and six matches with
out winning a set. "It was an
amazing feat for Cal to win those
matches without losing a set,"
commented coach Dick Gould.
"We can't afford to let the same

thing happen, but I've got a lot of
confidence in all the players
down the line." The top matches
will feature six of the top players
in the country with Peter Re
nnert, Lloyd Bourne and Tim
Mayotte of Stanford going
against Marty Davis, Scott Mc-
Cain and Chris Dunk of Cal.
For Stanford, the match versus
Cal will be the first in a series of
matches with five of the top
seven teams in the nation. Stan
ford's schedule includes home
and away matches versus
UCLA. USC and Cal, as well as
home matches against Trinity
and Pepperdine. The home
matches will include day matches
as well as evening matches at
Maples Pavilion.
All these matches are the pre
lude to the NCAA champion
ships in Athens, Georgia, which
Gould seems optimistic about.
"We've got a tough schedule of
matches, but that's good,"

Gould said. "To be one of the
best schools you've got to play
the best. We've got a team which
is capable of winning it (the
NCAAs). We may not be the
favorites, but if we stay healthy
and steadily improve, we'll be
right in there."
