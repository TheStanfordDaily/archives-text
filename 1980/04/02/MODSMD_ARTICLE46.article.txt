U.K. 13-week steel strike ends
I.ONDON — Britain's national steel strike
ended after 13 weeks yesterday when union lead
ers accepted an independent commission of in
quiry's recommended pay raise of about 16 per
cent, including productivity bonuses — just a lit
tle more than the British Steel Corp.'s last offer
and less than Britain's 19 percent inflation rate.
Although the labor dispute did great damage to
the already ailing nationalized steel industry, its
outcome is a victory for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's conservative government, which had
refused to increase its subsidy to British Steel to
finance a larger pay settlement.
British Steel now faces the difficult task of im
proving productivity, cutting its work force of
130,000 by one-third, shutting down a number of
huge plants and breaking even financially by the
end of next year, as the government has required.
It lost about $2 million a day before the strike and
about double that since.
The strike also cost British Steel about 10 per
cent of its already shrinking market to foreign
competitors and Britain's much smaller and
specialized privately owned steel firms. Labor
and management morale was left even lower than
it had already been because of the industry's de
terioration.
'80 food costs hit level period
Supermarket bills rose less than 2 percent dur
ing the first quarter of 1980 and were unchanged
last month, according to an Associated Press
marketbasket survey.
The AP drew up a random list of 14 commonly
purchased food and non-food items and priced
them at one supermarket in each of 13 cities on
March 1. 1973. Prices have been rechecked on or
about the start of each succeeding month.
The latest AP survey showed that the average
marketbasket bill at the start of April was 1.8

percent higher than it was at the beginning of the
year. The increase during the same period of
1979 was more than twice as bit —4.1 percent.
No attempt was made to weigh the AP survey
results according to population density or in
terms of what percent of a family's actual grocery
outlay each item represents.
The cities checked are: Albuquerque, N.M.,
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit. Los
Angeles. Miami. New York. Philadelphia. Provi
dence, R. 1., Salt Lake City and Seattle.
Man threatens to poison food
SAN DIEGO — Authorities awaited further
word yesterday from an extortionist who wants
50 diamonds from the nation's largest supermar
ket chain in exchange for telling what foods on
store shelves have been laced with deadly
cyanide.
A bottle of tainted teriyaki sauce was found
Sunday at a Safeway store in Pacific Beach, four
miles from the La Jolla store where a jar of
poisoned pickles was found with an extortion
note attached Saturday, authorities said.
The note signed by "The Poison Gang"
threatened to "poison food in every Safeway
store in the area" unless the demand for
diamonds was met. There are 45 Safeway stores
in San Diego County, a company spokesman said.
Safeway management and county health offi
cials were urging customers who shopped bet
ween 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday to return any
non-canned foods.
No cases of poisoning have been reported, but
one doctor complained of nausea after eating
pickles bought at the La Jolla store. San Diego
Regional Poison Center director Betts Wallace
said.
Business will continue as usual in all stores,
spokesmen said.
The FBI said the case is similar to one in Oak

land two weeks ago. Federal agents entered the
San Diego area case this weekend.
Joseph Garcia is free on bail in the San Fran
cisco Bay area after being charged with threaten
ing to put tainted food on Safeway shelves earlier
this month, the FBI said.
Authorities in San Diego said they knew of no
connection between the two cases.
Russian defector returns home
WASHINGTON — A Soviet ballet dancer
who defected to the United States January and
appeared to be enjoying a new life here suddenly
and mysteriously altered his plans and left for
Moscow last night in the company of Soviet offi
cials.
The dancer is Yuri Stepanov, 32, a soloist with
the Moscow Classical Ballet who left the troupe
during a tour in Rome late in January and went to
the United States Embassy there seeking asylum.
Friends of Stepanov believe he was pressured
by the Soviets into leaving, and the director of the
New Jersey ballet where Stepanov was working
said she had been stunned by his sudden disap
pearance last week.
Russian-speaking officials from the State De
partment and the Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Service, however, met with Stepanov in the
presence of two Soviet consular officials at the
State Department yesterday and said, after a
lengthy questioning session, that they couldn't
uncover evidence that he was being forced to
leave against his will. "They got the impression,"
an official said later, "that he did want to go
back."
Guatemalan ambassador shot
SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — A gunman
shot and wounded Guatemalan Ambassador Car
los Lemus Gallardo as he sat in his limousine in
front of the embassy yesterday, an embassy

spokesman reported.
He said the ambassador was not seriously
wounded but he was taken to a hospital.
No group asserted responsibility for the attack.
It was the third assassination attempt against
Lemus Gallardo here in three years, and leftists
were blamed for the two previous attacks in
which the ambassador escaped unharmed.
Prime rate hits record high
NEW YORK — The prime rate continued its
historic upward climb yesterday when Chase
Manhattan Bank boosted its rate half a percen
tage point to a record 19 3 /» percent.
Just a month ago the prime rate — the rate
banks charge their biggest and most creditworthy
corporate borrowers — was 3 percentage points
lower at 16 3 /» percent. •
Chase, the nation's third-langest commercial
bank, raised its prime rate shortly after second
ranked Citibank and No. 4 Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. went to \ 9Vi percent.
A growing number of money analysts are pre
dicting the rate will hit 20 percent soon as banks
are forced to pay more for funds. The federal
funds rate — the rate banks must pay for over
night loans from other Federal Reserve system
banks — was 19 7 /s percent yesterday.
Market quiet as silver stabilizes
NEW YORK — The stock market was mixed
in quiet trading yesterday, leveling off after its
rally of the past two sessions.
The market had risen steadily since it hit a
five-year low last Thursday afternoon in a crisis
atmosphere caused by forced selling of the bil
lionaire Hunt family's silver holdings.
The recovery was aided by a stabilization of the
silver market. The price of silver for April deliv
ery climbed to $14 an ounce today, against
$10.80 last Thursday.

Prime rate hits record high
NEW YORK — The prime rate continued its
historic upward climb yesterday when Chase
Manhattan Bank boosted its rate half a percen
tage point to a record 19 3 /» percent.
Just a month ago the prime rate — the rate
banks charge their biggest and most creditworthy
corporate borrowers — was 3 percentage points
lower at 16 3 /» percent. •
Chase, the nation's third-langest commercial
bank, raised its prime rate shortly after second
ranked Citibank and No. 4 Manufacturers
Hanover Trust Co. went to \ 9Vi percent.
A growing number of money analysts are pre
dicting the rate will hit 20 percent soon as banks
are forced to pay more for funds. The federal

night loans from other Federal Reserve system
banks — was 19 7 /s percent yesterday.
Market quiet as silver stabilizes
NEW YORK — The stock market was mixed
in quiet trading yesterday, leveling off after its
rally of the past two sessions.

U.K. 13-week steel strike ends
I.ONDON — Britain's national steel strike
ended after 13 weeks yesterday when union lead
ers accepted an independent commission of in
quiry's recommended pay raise of about 16 per
cent, including productivity bonuses — just a lit
tle more than the British Steel Corp.'s last offer
and less than Britain's 19 percent inflation rate.
Although the labor dispute did great damage to
the already ailing nationalized steel industry, its
outcome is a victory for Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's conservative government, which had
refused to increase its subsidy to British Steel to
finance a larger pay settlement.
British Steel now faces the difficult task of im
proving productivity, cutting its work force of
130,000 by one-third, shutting down a number of
huge plants and breaking even financially by the
end of next year, as the government has required.
It lost about $2 million a day before the strike and
about double that since.
The strike also cost British Steel about 10 per
cent of its already shrinking market to foreign
competitors and Britain's much smaller and
specialized privately owned steel firms. Labor
and management morale was left even lower than
it had already been because of the industry's de
terioration.
'80 food costs hit level period
Supermarket bills rose less than 2 percent dur
ing the first quarter of 1980 and were unchanged
last month, according to an Associated Press
marketbasket survey.
The AP drew up a random list of 14 commonly
purchased food and non-food items and priced
them at one supermarket in each of 13 cities on
March 1. 1973. Prices have been rechecked on or
about the start of each succeeding month.
The latest AP survey showed that the average
marketbasket bill at the start of April was 1.8

percent higher than it was at the beginning of the
year. The increase during the same period of
1979 was more than twice as bit —4.1 percent.
No attempt was made to weigh the AP survey
results according to population density or in
terms of what percent of a family's actual grocery
outlay each item represents.
The cities checked are: Albuquerque, N.M.,
Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Detroit. Los
Angeles. Miami. New York. Philadelphia. Provi
dence, R. 1., Salt Lake City and Seattle.
Man threatens to poison food
SAN DIEGO — Authorities awaited further
word yesterday from an extortionist who wants
50 diamonds from the nation's largest supermar
ket chain in exchange for telling what foods on
store shelves have been laced with deadly
cyanide.
A bottle of tainted teriyaki sauce was found
Sunday at a Safeway store in Pacific Beach, four
miles from the La Jolla store where a jar of
poisoned pickles was found with an extortion
note attached Saturday, authorities said.
The note signed by "The Poison Gang"
threatened to "poison food in every Safeway
store in the area" unless the demand for
diamonds was met. There are 45 Safeway stores
in San Diego County, a company spokesman said.
Safeway management and county health offi
cials were urging customers who shopped bet
ween 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. Sunday to return any
non-canned foods.
No cases of poisoning have been reported, but
one doctor complained of nausea after eating
pickles bought at the La Jolla store. San Diego
Regional Poison Center director Betts Wallace
said.
Business will continue as usual in all stores,
spokesmen said.
The FBI said the case is similar to one in Oak

land two weeks ago. Federal agents entered the
San Diego area case this weekend.
Joseph Garcia is free on bail in the San Fran
cisco Bay area after being charged with threaten
ing to put tainted food on Safeway shelves earlier
this month, the FBI said.
Authorities in San Diego said they knew of no
connection between the two cases.
Russian defector returns home
WASHINGTON — A Soviet ballet dancer
who defected to the United States January and
appeared to be enjoying a new life here suddenly
and mysteriously altered his plans and left for
Moscow last night in the company of Soviet offi

The dancer is Yuri Stepanov, 32, a soloist with
the Moscow Classical Ballet who left the troupe
during a tour in Rome late in January and went to
the United States Embassy there seeking asylum.
Friends of Stepanov believe he was pressured
by the Soviets into leaving, and the director of the
New Jersey ballet where Stepanov was working
said she had been stunned by his sudden disap
pearance last week.
Russian-speaking officials from the State De
