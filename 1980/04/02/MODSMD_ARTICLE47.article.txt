# Black activist claims 'white racists' control nation
## 
### Robert Reed Staff Writer 
The "white racists" that run and
manipulate this country are the real
engineers, because they are engineer
ing your body and your mind, the noted
black comedian, social commentator
and human rights activist Dick Gregory
told the National Society of Black En
gineers Monday night in Palo Alto.
Mixing a stand-up comedy routine
with teaching, preaching and a blister
ing social attack, Gregory told a crowd
of about 600 black engineering stu
dents from across the country meeting
here that black engineers are going to
have to learn more than just how to
build bridges, construct computers and
develop phone systems if they are
going to help build a new order of soci
ety.
"Y'all are coming through a filthy,
degenerate system, and if you don't
manipulate your responsibility and
start putting stops to things that have
been going wrong for so long, then I'll
tell you tonight to prepare yourself for
death — because you're fixing to die,"
Gregory told the crowd.
He added that the white racist sys

tem is the number one enemy of the
nation because of the total control over
human lives that it perpetuates.
The whole racist system is controlled
by a few whites in some secret and
some not-so-secret organizations, ac
cording to Gregory. "Them cats run
and control and manipulate your every
breath."
The white racist system is not simply
aimed at hurting blacks, he said, but
also aimed at hurting whites.
"One of the frights of the white racist
system is that it makes white folks af
raid of white folks," Gregory said. Hav
ing just arrived from the weekend pro
tests at the Three Mile Island nuclear
power plant, he noted the nuclear acci
dent of a year ago as an example.
"Those white folks never ever
thought their America would do that to
them." But they did. Gregory noted.
Gregory then told the crowd of en
gineers that he wished all of them
"could go and look at Three Mile Is
land. because engineers put it to
gether." He pointed out that it was en
gineers who "put a machine together
that 5000 years from now will still be
radioactive."

Gregory characterized the current
system as a "game" run by a few white
racists who would use engineers to help
them play this game.
"You cheat on history tests, they
cheat on whole continents," he said.
Parts of the "game" Gregory in
cluded in his talk were:
— CIA phone tappings of every call
made in the United States;
— the "faked" moon landings,
which he charged the government with
using to cover up the setting up of
reconaissance and weather modifica
tion satellites;
— the use of germ warfare on U.S.
citizens in U.S. cities;
— forced sterilization of men and
women by clothing manufacturers;
— the Iran crisis;
— the Andrew Young resignation;
— the Panama Canal Treaty;
— the revival of the Ku Klux Klan;
— drug use in the United States;
— and the Jonestown "suicide" or
massacre.
Gregory showed copies of FBI files
and other government files obtained
under the Freedom of Information Act
to document his accusations about the

"game.
Gregory asked the members of the
audience whether they were going to
he a "part of all this mess" or whether
they were going to try to straighten it all
out.
Admonishing successful blacks for
believing the "white racist system" had
given them opportunties at "elite" in
stitutions, Gregory pointed out that
every step successful blacks take is
made possible by the sacrifice of other
blacks.
"You young blacks, sometimes y'all
slip into that craziness that where you
are today you got there out of the
goodness of America's heart. You silly
niggers! For some reason, you will
leave these institutions and you will
never belong to the NAACP or the
Urban League or SCLC or PUSH,"
Gregory pointed out. "But the first
time them white boys jams y'all ass,
then y'all runs back to us.
"Every one of us blacks that made it
made it at the expense of four or five
hundred other niggers (that) had to
die," the activist told the audience.
"Somewhere down the line, niggers
have got to stop looking at y'all like

you're celebrities or something be
cause y'all got some kind of damn de
gree or some type of good job, and start
telling you niggers that everything y'all
got you owe that debt to that black
community," he added.
Gregory pointed out that while many
successful blacks are perfectly com
fortable in the "white racist system,"
they are afraid to go to the black
ghetto. Ghetto children thus never see
successful blacks, and end up having
only pimps and prostitutes to admire,
he said.
Gregory said successful blacks going
to schools like Stanford, Harvard and
Yale were being "pimped" themselves
because "when they put those schools
together, they never had no intention
blacks and Jews and Irish Catholicsand
women and poor white folks would
ever go there.
Gregory's speech was the last major
event of the conference held on campus
and at Rickey's Hyatt House in Palo
Alto. Events included workshops, lec
tures, discussion and a job fair. The
NSBE sponsors high school and college
tutorial programs, individual career
counseling and a placement service.
