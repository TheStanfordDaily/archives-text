# Student-run corporation gets bid to operate Coffee House
## 
### Jane West Staff Writer 
Coffee House Inc., a student-run
corporation organized by ASSU, won
the bid for operation of the Coffee
House, Tresidder director Ellie Op
penheim announced yesterday.
Servomation, a national food service
corporation, was awarded the contract
to operate the Tresidder Transition
and Encina Station.
Officials from both corporations and
from the University were pleased
about the outcome of the contract bid
ding negotiations.
"We have a lot of drive and a lot of
ideas. Now, we have to go in and see
where we can make real changes in the
Coffee House," said Dick Butterfield,
head of the ASSU Coffee House task
force.
Butterfield echoed the sentiments of
other ASSU members involved in the
process who are now searching for a
professional manager and assistants
for the new operation.
A board of directors must then be
created to oversee the Coffee House
and to act as an intermediary between
Oppenheim and the employees of the

Coffee House.
Pleased with the outcome of the
negotiations, Oppenheim said, "The
combination of vendors will serve the
community very well."
Out of the eight proposals reviewed.
Oppenheim, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and the ad-hoc food pol
icy group which reviewed the bids all
agreed that the ASSU and Servoma
tion presented the best proposals.
"We got some excellent proposals,
but we were unable to accommodate all
of them. We were really impressed with
the range of quality, yet ASSU and
Servomation definitely were the best.
They will do an outstanding job," said
Oppenheim.
Preparations for writing the 34-page
ASSU proposal started in the fall.
"A corps of approximately 15
people made a major time commitment
to the project and we also solicited the
expertise of people all over the Univer
sity," Butterfield said.
As described in the ASSU proposal,
the immediate visible changes in the
Coffee House will be a price decrease,
student coordinator positions in adver
tising, entertainment programming
and bookkeeping, more live enter
tainment and a greater responsiveness
to student desires.
"All our short- and long-range goals
are wrapped in making the Coffee
House the gathering spot on campus,"
said Chris Greene, a member of the
task force.
Long-range plans include a call-in
system where customers can call in the
morning to order a sandwich and have
it ready to be picked up by lunchtime.
Coffee House Inc. also proposed to ex
tend hours, expand facilities, create a
fast food line during lunch hours and
add crepes and ice cream to the menu.
ASSU's new competitor, Servoma

tion, also said it will try to strengthen
the attraction of Tresidder. The na
tional food service accumulates $4 50
million in sales each year.
"I was pleasantly surprised when the
food service contract came up for bid,"
said Joe Concillo, senior account
executive for the firm. "The hid
specifications left no question of what
the University wanted. We had to de
termine what we could do and what
changes we could make."
Concillo saw an immediate need to
decrease food prices and to broaden
the menu.
The corporation's policy is called
"appetique": a combination of appe
tite, appeal and boutique.
"We like to merchandise food so it
really stands out," he said. A major
plan the corporation hopes to imple
ment this summer is renovation of the
Transition to include a pizza and
sandwich station and a serving window
that connects to the patio. Waitress
service to the patio may be established.
Both corporations will have wine
and beer licenses. Local talent will be
encouraged to perform, as increased
entertainment is high on both groups'
priority list.
Coffee House Inc. and Servomation
will begin operating their food services
May 1 when the University's present
contract with TDS expires.
Interviews will be conducted with
the present employees of the Tresiddci
food services to determine their plans.
Lyons said. "We have not shown any
favoritism at all in the decision process.
Both corporations are quick on their
feet to respond to the students and to
make Tresidder an improved union."
The food service contract is for two
years and has the option of renewal
each year for three years if the Univer
sity and the parties agree.

said Chris Greene, a member of the
task force.
Long-range plans include a call-in
system where customers can call in the
morning to order a sandwich and have
it ready to be picked up by lunchtime.
Coffee House Inc. also proposed to ex
tend hours, expand facilities, create a
fast food line during lunch hours and
add crepes and ice cream to the menu.
ASSU's new competitor, Servoma

tion, also said it will try to strengthen
the attraction of Tresidder. The na
tional food service accumulates $4 50
million in sales each year.
"I was pleasantly surprised when the
food service contract came up for bid,"
said Joe Concillo, senior account
executive for the firm. "The hid
specifications left no question of what
the University wanted. We had to de
termine what we could do and what
changes we could make."
Concillo saw an immediate need to
decrease food prices and to broaden
the menu.
The corporation's policy is called
"appetique": a combination of appe
tite, appeal and boutique.
"We like to merchandise food so it
really stands out," he said. A major
plan the corporation hopes to imple
ment this summer is renovation of the
Transition to include a pizza and
sandwich station and a serving window
that connects to the patio. Waitress
service to the patio may be established.
Both corporations will have wine
and beer licenses. Local talent will be
encouraged to perform, as increased
entertainment is high on both groups'
priority list.
Coffee House Inc. and Servomation
will begin operating their food services
May 1 when the University's present
contract with TDS expires.
Interviews will be conducted with
the present employees of the Tresiddci
food services to determine their plans.
Lyons said. "We have not shown any
favoritism at all in the decision process.
Both corporations are quick on their
feet to respond to the students and to
make Tresidder an improved union."
The food service contract is for two
years and has the option of renewal
each year for three years if the Univer
sity and the parties agree.
Coffee House Inc., a student-run
corporation organized by ASSU, won
the bid for operation of the Coffee
House, Tresidder director Ellie Op
penheim announced yesterday.
Servomation, a national food service
corporation, was awarded the contract
to operate the Tresidder Transition
and Encina Station.
Officials from both corporations and
from the University were pleased
about the outcome of the contract bid
ding negotiations.
"We have a lot of drive and a lot of
ideas. Now, we have to go in and see
where we can make real changes in the
Coffee House," said Dick Butterfield,
head of the ASSU Coffee House task
force.
Butterfield echoed the sentiments of
other ASSU members involved in the
process who are now searching for a
professional manager and assistants
for the new operation.
A board of directors must then be
created to oversee the Coffee House
and to act as an intermediary between
Oppenheim and the employees of the

Coffee House.
Pleased with the outcome of the
negotiations, Oppenheim said, "The
combination of vendors will serve the
community very well."
Out of the eight proposals reviewed.
Oppenheim, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and the ad-hoc food pol
icy group which reviewed the bids all
agreed that the ASSU and Servoma
tion presented the best proposals.
"We got some excellent proposals,
but we were unable to accommodate all
of them. We were really impressed with
the range of quality, yet ASSU and
Servomation definitely were the best.
They will do an outstanding job," said
Oppenheim.
Preparations for writing the 34-page
ASSU proposal started in the fall.
"A corps of approximately 15
people made a major time commitment
to the project and we also solicited the
expertise of people all over the Univer
sity," Butterfield said.
As described in the ASSU proposal,
the immediate visible changes in the
Coffee House will be a price decrease,
student coordinator positions in adver
tising, entertainment programming
and bookkeeping, more live enter
tainment and a greater responsiveness
to student desires.
"All our short- and long-range goals
are wrapped in making the Coffee
House the gathering spot on campus,"
said Chris Greene, a member of the
task force.
