# No major delay caused by bollards
## Firefighters review actions in Storey blaze 
### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
Bollards encountered by firefighters
en route to the Storey House fire last
month caused a two-minute delay in
firefighters' arrival on the scene, but
their absence would have resulted in
even greater delay, according to Palo
Alto Fire Chief Bill Korff.
The chief spoke to five former Storey
residents yesterday at a meeting to re
view the Fire Department's routine in
ternal critique of its performance. An
official report on the cause of the fire is
not yet completed.
Korff said without the barriers, pri
vate vehicles would have been parked
on the street in front of Storey, com
plicating the fire fighting. Instead, once
firefighters arrived, they had a cleared
street, with no obstructions at the
scene.
Firefighters ran a test shortly after
the fire to determine the time differ
ence between the two possible routes
to reach Storey House, Korff said.
Capt. Pat Cady, firefighter in charge
of the first engine to arrive, jumped a
curb and drove into White Plaza from
behind Meyer Library, instead of driv
ing up Lasuen Mall between the Quad
and Cubberley.
"Pedestrian congestion along La
suen Mall made it better to choose the
alternate route," said Assistant Direc
tor of Public Safety Frank Jurian. The
first alarm came at 2:16 p.m., shortly
after early afternoon classes ended.
Firefighters at the meeting also
explained how the fire spread so
quickly.
With the aid of sketches, Battalion

Chief Charles Challenger, who di
rected the March 4 firefighting opera
tion, showed the residents how con
struction of the 80-year-old structure
could allow the fire to spread across the
entire attic as soon as it burned through
the ceiling of the second-floor room
where it began.
Arrangement of the third-floor
rooms in the building left trapped space
between room walls and the steep roof

at several locations, with no firestops
between these spaces and other parts of
the attic.
One of these trapped spaces was lo
cated directly above the room where
the fire broke out, Challenger said.
After the fire burned through the ceil
ing, it spread unimpeded under the
roof and continued to build, he said.
Investigation also revealed that the
entire third floor was made of a fiber

board that burns easily and tends to
smoke badly as it smolders.
Firefighters were never able to vent
that smoke and heat buildup
adequately enough to attack the fire
from inside the house and below the
flames, which was according to Chal
lenger, the ideal way to fight the fire.
Thus Challenger decided to let the
roof burn away and then attack from
