# Ten men arrested for 'lewd acts'
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Campus police have arrested 10 men
for allegedly performing "lewd and las
civious" homosexual acts in Cummings
Art Building and Cubberley Education
Building restrooms and on University
grounds.
Plainclothes policemen patroling the
areas made the arrests Thursday
through Sunday.
Some of the men are students here,
according to Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of
Stanford Police Services. Others ar
rested included area school teachers, a
nurse and a data processor.
Police initially acted on reports of
"heavy homosexual activity in the
men's restroom in the Cummings build
ing," said Niemeyer.
According to Albert Elsen, acting
chairman of the art department, "there
were a lot of complaints from people
about activity they found disruptive or
disturbing, and I forwarded this to the
police."
Police made seven arrests in Cum

mings, two in Cubberley and one in
Sunken Diamond, said Niemeyer.
He added that the activity has "been
going on a long time" and has "gotten
out of control."
The Cummings restroom is in the
basement and has no stall doors. They
were removed a few years ago in an
attempt to curb homosexual activity,
Elsen said.
According to Niemeyer, offenders
who enter the building on weekends
and at night may prop open the back
door earlier in the day. Activity may
thus go unnoticed when the building is
closed.
Homosexuals seem to receive news
of the gathering place "by word of
mouth." said Niemeyer. He added that
one man said he had received instruc
tions from a restroom wall in San Fran
cisco.
To make an arrest, police "have to
either observe a lewd act or be sol
icited," said Niemeyer. They can also
make arrests "if they can show an indi
vidual has been loitering for an unusual

amount of time."
Niemeyer said police will continue to
watch the restrooms and arrest offen
ders. "Activity is mostly prevalent
around the noon hour."
The spokesman did not know the
reason for the high traffic in the Cum
mings building. He said, however, that
"it is somewhat in the center of cam
pus."
Responding to the arrests, David
Morandi of the Stanford Gay Counsel
ing Group said."We deplore the recent
rash of arrests by police in Stanford
restrooms. Long periods of non
enforcement of laws and the resulting
implied tolerance followed by intense
crackdowns are destructive and unfair
methods.
"Certainly the arrests and resulting
police records and possible public ex
posure cause more harm than any of
the illegal behavior," he said.
Morandi added that the Gay Coun
seling Group is offering counseling and
help in finding legal representation for
those arrested.
