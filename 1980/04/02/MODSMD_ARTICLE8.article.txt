## Parliament can decide Khomeini rejects compromise 
### Doyle McManus The Los Angeles Times 
TEHRAN, Iran — The
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
yesterday rejected any com
promise over the 50 American
hostages held at the U.S. Em
bassy as "diabolic trickery" and
said only Iran's new Parliament
can decide the issue, apparently
dooming a proposal to move the
Americans into government cus
tody.
In a speech prepared for deliv
ery by his son Ahmed, Khomeini
said he blamed President Carter
for allowing the deposed Shah
Mohammed Reza Pahlavi to
leave Panama for Egypt nine
days ago.
President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr was expected to announce
his government's final decision
on the issue in a speech begin
ning about midnight.
But a ranking diplomat said
there appeared to be only "one
chance in a million" that the
transfer of the hostages could go
through after Khomeini's tough
message.
In the address, the Ayatollah
Khomeini said: "Mr. Carter
must realize that by sending the
deposed shah to Egypt and re
penting past mistakes and con
fessing American trickery
against deprived nations, includ
ing Iran, and at the same time
asking me to find a solution to
the problem of the nest of spies
(U.S. Embassy) he is going the
wrong way about things."
Iranian officials said Monday
that Khomeini had given his ap
proval to the basic principle of
moving the hostages out of the
hands of the militant students
vsho seized the embassy almost
five months ago. But sources
close to the negotiations said the
militants insisted on imposing
their own restrictions on the
move.
In the end. itappeared that the
Iranian and American govern
ments failed to reach a decision
on the conditions of the transfer,
despite a last-minute message

from Bani-Sadr to President
Carter outlining Iran's final of
fer.
Khomeini's reiteration that
only Parliament can decide the
hostage's fate appeared to delay
any resolution of the crisis once
again. Most of Parliament's 270
members have not even been
elected yet. and the assembly is
not expected to convene before
mid-June. Diplomats said the
next step may be for the United
States to carry out its threat to
expel Iranian diplomats and im
pose a trade embargo on Iran.
TheCarteradministration had
given the Iranians until Monday
night to arrange the transfer of
the hostages of face stiff political
and economic sanctions. Iranian
officials said. In response, the
ruling Revolutionary Council
agreed to take the 50 Americans
out of the hands of their militant
captors. Khomeini, the country's
supreme religious leader,
ratified the decision Monday
morning, they said.
U.S. officials had hoped that
by mov ing the captives out of the
hands of the militants, they
would increase the chances of
negotiating an early release. The
militants had blocked several
previous attempts by the Iranian
government to reach a com
promise with the United States
on the issue.
One source involved in the
long negotiations said the milit
ants suggested Monday that the
government could take formal
custody of the hostages while
leaving them, and their captors,
inside the occupied embassy.
The United States has previ
ously rejected such an arrange
ment. which would appear to
leave the militant students in real
control of the 50 Americans.
Bani-Sadr faced a ticklish di
lemma in preparing his speech:
The Iranian public has not yet
been told that the transfer of the
hostages is even under consider
ation. After more than five
months of rhetoric castigating
the United States as ' the Great

Satan"' and largely praising the
militants, it will not be easy for
the government to explain why
the hostages should be moved.
And Bani-Sadr cannot admit
publicly that the United Stated
delivered any kind of ultimatum
without appearing to bow to
American pressure, diplomats
said.
But it was only American
pressure, backed up with mes
sages of support with Western al
lies of the United States, which
prodded the Iranians into action.
The United States threatened to
impose a trade embargo against
Iran, expel some or all of Iran's
remaining diplomats in the Un
ited States, and ask its allies to
close their own embassies in
Tehran, diplomats said.
European participation was
important, they said, because
Bani-Sadr is known to believe
that the countries of Western
Europe are Iran's natural allies.
The delay in Iran's response to
the American ultimatum —
more than a day past the dead
line set by the Carter administra
tion — was characteristic of the
revolutionary regime, which is
still struggling to establish its au
thority over independent forces
such as the militant students.
Washington's original dead
line was noon Monday Tehran
time, but Iranian negotiators
managed to gain nine hours by
pleading that they thought the
limit was noon Washington time.
Also characteristic of the Ira
nian bargaining style was their
agreement first on the basic prin
ciple of the transfer, followed by
a flurry of reservations and new
conditions. "I've never seen any
thing like it," one participant in
the negotiations said. "They can
be just like a bunch of rug mer
chants."
All day Monday, Bani-Sadr
and other Revolutionary Coun
cil members met with student
leaders, officers of Khomeini's
Revolutionary Guard and other
officials to try to reach an agree

ment.
"The students were not
happy," one Revolutionary
Council member said, and they
wrangled with Bani-Sadr over
the terms of any transfer.
Bani-Sadr began the day in
favor of a quick and simple re
moval of the hostages from the
embassy, but wavered in the face
of the students' resistance,
another source said.
A measure of the students'
unhappiness was the fact that for
much of the day. they denied that
any negotiations were going on.
Later, they admitted that they
were talking to the president, but
refused to divulge any details.
"Bani-Sadr will make the de
claration tomorrow (Tuesday),"
a student spokesman said. "It
will all be clear then . . . We will
obey what the Imam (Khomeini)
orders."
Swiss Ambassador Erik
Lang, who has been the channel
for past messages between the
White House and the Iranian
president, shuttled several times
between Bani-Sadr's office and
his nearby embassy. It was Lang
who transmitted Bani-Sadr's
late-night offer to Washington,
diplomats said.
Sources involved in the
negotiations refused to describe
the contents of the offer, but said
it appeared unlikely that the Un
ited States would accept it with
out at least some alterations.
