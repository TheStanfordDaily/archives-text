# Inflation seen worsening

The Associated Press
WASHINGTON — Economists in and
out of government believe inflation will
be worse in 1980 than it was last year
despite President Carter's latest efforts,
including a revised budget aimed at
eliminating deficit spending.
And the analysts said in interviews
Monday that they expect a recession con
siderably more severe than the president
and his advisers are forecasting.
"Things really are looking terrible out
there," said a congressional budget
analyst who ask not to be identified. "1
think the administration is grossly unde
restimating the problems and will have to
'eat' this budget the same way it did the
earlier one."
And both Robert Gough, chief forecas
ter for Data Resources Inc. in Lexington,
M<iss., and Lawrence Chimerine. chair
man of Chase Econometrics in Bala Cyn
nyd, Pa., said Carter's latest inflation
forecast of 12.8 percent for this year was
at least a percentage point too low.
" Energy prices and mortgage rates just
aren't going to come down that much,"
said Gough.
Reaction from the stock market was
equally pessimistic.
"I don't think Carter hasany credibility
on Wall Street, so I don't think whatever
he says will have an effect," said Alan C.
Poole, an analyst at the investment house
of Laidlan, Adams & Peck.
Carter formally unveiled on Monday
his new "restrained and austere" budget

proposal for the fiscal year beginning Oct.
1. It came less than two months after he
had issued a fiscal 1981 spending bluep
rint that he termed "prudent and respon
sible."
The revision was prompted in good
part by the speed-up in inflation to an
annual rate of 18 percent in the first two
months of this year. Carter advisers have
said.
Carter's latest budget proposal slashes
$17.2 billion in planned government
spending as part of an effort to "produce
a significant decline in inflation as the
year progresses."
Coupled with planned increases in re
venues from the president's new energy
import taxes and other tax-raising mea
sures, the cuts would leave a budget
surplus of $16.5 billion.
That would be the largest budget
surplus in the nation's history, surpassing
the $12 billion surplus in 1948. And it
would mark the first year since 1969 that
the government did not spend more than
it collected in revenues.
Because deficit spending is considered
inflationary, balancing the budget should
help slow the price spiral. In addition,
Carter has imposed credit controls to
slow consumer spending and stepped up
his voluntary wage and price guidelines
program.
But outside economists point out the
president's goals won't be realized if the
economic assumptions underlying the
new budget are incorrect, as the analysts
believe.
