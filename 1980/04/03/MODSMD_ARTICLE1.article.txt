# Candidates assess strategies, chances
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter, better than
half way home in his bid for renomina
tion, is looking for a Louisiana land
slide on Saturday, but his strategists
foresee a difficult, intensely contested
match with Sen. Edward Kennedy in
pivotal Pennsylvania.
They've got 20 days to campaign for
the 185 delegate votes in Pennsylvania,
and Kennedy already is at it. "We have
to do very well," he said, beginning a
three-day campaign swing there yes
terday with a warning, aimed at big-city
voters, that the budget cuts made by
the Carter administration likely will
lead to increased violence and lawless
ness."
Kendell endorsement
At a hotel news conference, where
he picked up the endorsement of the
Philadelphia district attorney, Ken
nedy said, "The budget cuts of the Car
ter administration are going to mean
that the rate of crime will most likely
increase over the period of this year.
"People who experience crime . . .
happen to be the poor people, happen
to be the working people, happen to be
the elderly people," he said. "This is
again an indication of where the
economic crisis that we are facing is
being borne."
Philadelphia's district attorney, Ed
ward Rendell, in endorsing Kennedy,
noted that the Carter budget cuts
jeopardize $33 million in revenue shar
ing for Philadelphia, and he praised
Kennedy for his years of work on law
enforcement legislation.
'Rough state'
Meanwhile, Carter's pollster Patrick
Caddell, conceded, Pennsylvania is
"going to be a rough state, there's no
question about it."
But Caddell said in Milwaukee that
even defeat in Pennsylvania would be
no more than a pause in Carter's march
toward the Democratic nomination for
a second term.
Carter won big in Tuesday's Wiscon
sin and Kansas primaries, and Robert
Strauss, his campaign chairman, said
renomination is "becoming more cer
tain every day.
"The numbers weigh very strongly in
our favor," Strauss said in Washington.
California Gov. Jerry Brown folded
his Democratic campaign after running
a distant third in Wisconsin, which
meant the end of federal subsidies for
his campaign.
'Not ready for '80'
"To me, the vote in Wisconsin is a
very clear indication my candidacy is,
not ready for 1980," Brown said.
Brown, whose campaign theme has
been "protect the earth, serve the
people, explore the universe," told
supporters, "Tomorrow, I'm going
back to California and get some work
done, but tonight we celebrate."

The 4 1-year-old governor em
phasized the year 1980, suggesting he
may seek the White House again in
1984 or beyond.
The Republican numbers were all
with Ronald Reagan in Kansas and
Wisconsin. But Bush and Anderson
said they would keep trying. Bush is
entered in Louisiana, where conserva
tive Reagan is heavily favored, and in
the April 22 Pennsylvania primary.
Anderson is not.
California primary
Anderson, reeling from his loss in
Wisconsin, will begin campaigning in
California next week in an effort to win
the June 3 primary. But victory is such
a long shot, an aide calls the effort a
"juggernaut or whimsy."
Anderson wants to persuade enough
Democrats to re-register as Republi
cans to enable him to defeat former
Gov. Ronald Reagan in his home state,
and, under winner-take-all rules, sec
ure every one of California's delegates
to the Republican National Conven
tion this summer.
Reagan won 48 delegate votes in
Tuesday's primaries, swelling his na
tional total to 343. It will take 998 to
win the nomination. Bush has 72 dele
gates, Anderson 56.
Carter won 48 delegates in Wiscon
sin, 23 in Kansas. That put his national
count at 852, more than half the 1666
needed for nomination by the Democ
ratic National Convention in August.
Kennedy has 427.
Carter strategists said they figure the
president has 916 delegates and Ken
nedy 453. Their numbers include dele
gates from states which have begun but
not completed the apportionment pro
cess.
They also said Kennedy now will
have to win 64 percent of all the dele
gates yet to be chosen in order to over
take the president.
The Louisiana primary Saturday will
award 51 Democratic delegates and 3 1
Republican. Caddell said he thinks the
president will capture more than 60
percent of the vote there.

The Louisiana primary Saturday will
award 51 Democratic delegates and 3 1
Republican. Caddell said he thinks the
president will capture more than 60
percent of the vote there.
From the Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter, better than
half way home in his bid for renomina
tion, is looking for a Louisiana land
slide on Saturday, but his strategists
foresee a difficult, intensely contested
match with Sen. Edward Kennedy in
pivotal Pennsylvania.
They've got 20 days to campaign for
the 185 delegate votes in Pennsylvania,
and Kennedy already is at it. "We have
to do very well," he said, beginning a
three-day campaign swing there yes
terday with a warning, aimed at big-city
voters, that the budget cuts made by
the Carter administration likely will
lead to increased violence and lawless
ness."
Kendell endorsement
At a hotel news conference, where
he picked up the endorsement of the
Philadelphia district attorney, Ken
nedy said, "The budget cuts of the Car
ter administration are going to mean
that the rate of crime will most likely
increase over the period of this year.
"People who experience crime . . .
happen to be the poor people, happen
to be the working people, happen to be
the elderly people," he said. "This is
again an indication of where the
economic crisis that we are facing is
being borne."
Philadelphia's district attorney, Ed
ward Rendell, in endorsing Kennedy,
noted that the Carter budget cuts
jeopardize $33 million in revenue shar
ing for Philadelphia, and he praised
Kennedy for his years of work on law
enforcement legislation.
'Rough state'
Meanwhile, Carter's pollster Patrick
Caddell, conceded, Pennsylvania is
"going to be a rough state, there's no
question about it."
But Caddell said in Milwaukee that
even defeat in Pennsylvania would be
no more than a pause in Carter's march
toward the Democratic nomination for
a second term.
Carter won big in Tuesday's Wiscon
sin and Kansas primaries, and Robert
Strauss, his campaign chairman, said
renomination is "becoming more cer
tain every day.
"The numbers weigh very strongly in
our favor," Strauss said in Washington.
California Gov. Jerry Brown folded
his Democratic campaign after running
a distant third in Wisconsin, which
meant the end of federal subsidies for
his campaign.
'Not ready for '80'
"To me, the vote in Wisconsin is a
very clear indication my candidacy is,
not ready for 1980," Brown said.
Brown, whose campaign theme has
been "protect the earth, serve the
people, explore the universe," told
supporters, "Tomorrow, I'm going
back to California and get some work
done, but tonight we celebrate."

The 4 1-year-old governor em
phasized the year 1980, suggesting he
may seek the White House again in
1984 or beyond.
The Republican numbers were all
with Ronald Reagan in Kansas and
Wisconsin. But Bush and Anderson
said they would keep trying. Bush is
entered in Louisiana, where conserva
tive Reagan is heavily favored, and in
the April 22 Pennsylvania primary.
Anderson is not.
California primary
Anderson, reeling from his loss in
Wisconsin, will begin campaigning in
California next week in an effort to win
the June 3 primary. But victory is such
a long shot, an aide calls the effort a
"juggernaut or whimsy."
Anderson wants to persuade enough
Democrats to re-register as Republi
cans to enable him to defeat former
Gov. Ronald Reagan in his home state,
and, under winner-take-all rules, sec
ure every one of California's delegates
to the Republican National Conven
tion this summer.
Reagan won 48 delegate votes in
Tuesday's primaries, swelling his na
tional total to 343. It will take 998 to
win the nomination. Bush has 72 dele
gates, Anderson 56.
Carter won 48 delegates in Wiscon
sin, 23 in Kansas. That put his national
count at 852, more than half the 1666
needed for nomination by the Democ
ratic National Convention in August.
Kennedy has 427.
Carter strategists said they figure the
president has 916 delegates and Ken
nedy 453. Their numbers include dele
gates from states which have begun but
not completed the apportionment pro
cess.
They also said Kennedy now will
have to win 64 percent of all the dele
gates yet to be chosen in order to over
take the president.

Republican. Caddell said he thinks the
