# Jamaica ends IMF talks, forfeits loans
## 
### Les Payne Newsday 
Jamaican Prime Minister
Michael Manley shocked his
bankrupt island country last
week by calling for early elec
tions and by ending negotiations
with the International Monetary
Fund, thereby forfeiting SlB5
million in loans.
Both decisions are expected to
have far-reaching effects on the
Caribbean country, which al
ready is suffering from a lack of
foreign exchange, political tur
moil and critical shortages of
consumer necessities. Manley
has cleared the way for national
elections, which had been
scheduled for the end of the year,
to be held by "mid year." /Vewj
day disclosed in January a U.S.
plan to use all of its influence to
drive Manley — whom the Car
ter administration considered
"irretrievable" because of the
Socialist leader's ties with Cuba
— from office by June.
"As early as January, the
Jamaican government and the
IMF had given up on the initial
goal of trying to manage the
country's economic recovery," a
knowledgeable source said in
Washington.
" Their more limited aims were
to prevent further economic de
terioration. Thev were conduct

ing a holding operation while
they looked for other sources of
funds, and the government went
ahead to establish a new gov
ernment."
To speed up preparations for
the earlier elections, Manley said
the existing voter rolls, which the
opposition party has long de
manded be replaced, must be
used. In a move that surprised
some U.S. government officials,
Edward Seaga. the leader of the
opposition Jamaican Labour
Party, apparently has dropped
his demand for a new voter roll.
The change, which appears to
favor Manley . is considered criti
cal to the outcome of the elec
tion.
Clear road
"Manley would not have made
the decision for the earlier elec
tion unless his party saw a clear
road to victory," a U.S. official
said. However, victory for'the
leftist leader is far from certain,
for since he became prime minis
ter in 1972, Jamaica's economy
has been deteriorating steadily.
The latest, and perhaps the
most severe, blow to the island's
bankrupt economy was Jamai
ca's decision to end its months of
negotiations with the IMF. Had
the parties reached agreement,
the IMF would have advanced
Jamaica $185 million over the

next 12 months as the last part of
a three-year, $429-million loan.
Jamaica had its emergency funds
cut off in December when it
failed to adhere to the world
bank's guidelines. In its final de
cision last week, the Jamaican
cabinet accepted the ruling
People's National Party's re
commendation that the govern
ment reject the tough IMF
guidelines that restrict the is
land's balance-of-payments pol
icy.
The decision is expected to
have major political impact on
the future course of the island
country. Seaga. who is strongly
pro-American, has charged that
the decision on the IMF indicates
the Manley government has
been taken over by "Marxist-led
elements." A nongovernment
source knowledgeable about is
land politics said that the party's
left wing has long opposed the
relations with the IMF. an inter
national banking institution that
extends credit to countries, and
that it was surprising that the
cabinet finally agreed with its
position.
Waiver
Former Finance Minister Eric
Bell, who resigned last week, ad
vised Manley that even if the
country had been granted a
waiver for emergency funds, that

would not have lasted long. "We
would have in all probability
failed the IMF test in September
in spite of any reasonable efforts
at management." Manley said.
In 1978, when Jamaica
negotiated the three-year loan,
the IMF, seeking to establish
Jamaica as a model for Third
World development, set tough
fiscal terms, which included fi
nancial and social reforms and a
more than 35 percent devalua
tion of the Jamaican dollar. It is
those terms the Manley govern
ment said could not be met.
"I don't think that any other
country in the world would have
accepted the IMF conditions,"
said a State Department official
on the Caribbean desk in
Washington. Another
Washington financial source said
the plan now is a "complete fai
lure."
