LUSAKA. Zambia — Nine Southern African na
tions agreed this week to work toward closer integ
ration of their economies in a major move to re
duce their dependence on white-ruled South Al
rica.
At the conclusion of a one-day summit meeting
Tuesday, the nine under-developed nations,
stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian Oceans
and more than 1 s,o()omiles northward from South
Africa, approved a seven-point plan "to coordi
nate their economies to accelerate their develop
ment."
Although seeking to distance themselves from
South Africa, the nine nations openly admitted tor
the first time that they are heavily dependent on
Pretoria. They went out of their way to reassure
their white-minority-ruled southern neighbor that
no hostility was intended in the economic field.
"We want to clarify we are not declaring a war
against South Africa." said Mozambique President

Samora Machel, whose economy is closely linked
to Pretoria.
The effect of the long-term plan is to acknow
ledge that black Africa must co-exist economically
with South Africa at least for the time being as the
struggle for majority rule enters the final phase
now that white control has ended in Rhodesia.
Botswana President Sir Seretse Khama, chair
man of the summit, stated the problem clearly re
cently. saying: "We have to deal with them while
condemning them for their evil policies."
Key elements in the seven-point plan include:
— Creating a joint transportation and communi
cation commission;
— Establishing a development fund to invite
international aid;
— Promoting cooperation in agriculture, indus
try and manpower training.
The declaration did not include any financial
provisions but called for a meeting of Cabinet
ministers in September to work out costs, as well as
an international donors conference in November.
