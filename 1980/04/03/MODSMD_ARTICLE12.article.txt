# Egypt plays Iran's old role for U.S.
## 
### Edward Cody The Washington Post 
CAIRO — Egypt and the Un
ited States are moving swiftly to
a new level of military and
strategic cooperation that,
joined to broad diplomatic and
economic commitments, gives
Washington an increasingly im
portant stake in the policies and
survival of President Anwar
Sadat.
The rapid expansion of links,
particularly since the Afghanis
tan crisis, means that in effect
Egypt has replaced Iran as the
most powerful and dependable
U.S. ally in the Middle East,
after Israel.
Despite its distance, Egypt
thus is becoming a key to Ameri
can ability to exert influence in
Africa and Persian Gulf oil na
tions.
Economic aid
In addition, what has become
the largest U.S. economic aid
program in the world, moving
into its sixth year, is reaching into
Egyptian society with a hearty
American handshake. More
than a billion dollars a year is
being allocated to an effort to
show Egyptians that Sadat's

peace policies will make their
lives easier and to foster the free
enterprise that Sadat has resol
ved to revive after two decades
of stultifying Nasser socialism.
Although no one may have
planned it that way, the cumula
tive effect of these commitments
increasingly seems to tie U.S.
Middle East policy to Egypt's
pro-Western orientation, in the
expectation but without the
guarantee that the direction set
by Sadat will continue in the
years to come.
"We're building here for the
long haul, no doubt about it, on
the assumption that we've got a
firm foundation," said a senior
U.S. diplomat closely involved in
the evolution of U.S.-Egyptian
relations. "Of course, you have
to review the assumption from
time to time. And we're doing
that."
Gamble
A junior American diplomat
of Arab origin who opposes
Sadat and U.S. policy here called
the assumption "putting all our
eggs in one bastard."
Other U.S. and European dip
lomats in the Middle East also
question — in more polite ways
— the wisdom of investing so
heavily in Egypt as a strategic
partner after the Iranian experi
ence and as the only channel for
resolving the Arab-Israeli con
flict despite opposition by the
other Arab nations.
"There is general agreement
that Sadat seems permanently
pro-West, but the thing is that if
Sadat were to disappear for one
reason or another (Vice Presi
dent Hosni) Mubarak or who
ever else took over could change
things around completely," re
marked a European diplomat
who watches Egyptian politics
closely.
Turnabout
As an example, he cited the
turnabout by Sadat himself, who
in 1970 took over an Egypt
tightly allied to the Soviet Union
by President Gamal Abdul Nas
ser but who within a few years
reversed alliances and has ended
up as a U.S. champion in the
Arab world.
A military specialist from a
Western country friendly to both
the United States and Egypt also

noted the uncertain future and
said, "It's just like Iran." After a
pause, he smiled and added:
"Except the Iranians were pay
ing for it."
The high-visibility asylum
Sadat gave to the fallen shah un
derlines the comparison with an
irony embarrassing to American
officials involved in U.S.-
Egyptian relations. Since Sadat
has taken up where the shah left
off as a U.S. ally in the Middle
East, his display of concern
seems to reflect a solidarity with
an old friend of the United States
refused U.S. asylum and reduced
to drifting as an international
outc; t.
Egypt more stable?
But beyond the irony, U.S. of
ficials here insist the comparison
with Iran is false because Egypt
under Sadat is more stable than
Iran under the shah and the scale
of U.S. involvement here is much
smaller than it was in Iran before
the Islamic revolution.
The number of American offi
cials and their families living
here, they point out, is only
about 730, with approximately
100 more on temporary duty. In
cluding nonofficial U.S. citizens
here, the total of Americans in
Egypt is about 6000 among a
population of 4 1 million.
Although these numbers are
certain to rise as more experts
accompany the U.S. arms that
are on their way, U.S. diplomats
say the number will never reach
the scale of Iran, where 40,000
Americans lived at the peak of
U.S. involvement.
Strategic concerns
U.S. diplomats and Egyptian
officials agree that Washington's
commitment to Egypt, particu
larly military, has grown in re
cent months primarily because of
Washington's attempt to replace
Iran as a strategic friend in the
Middle East — even faster since
Soviet forces intervened in Af
ghanistan last December.
"You look around the region,
and what else is there?" asked a
ranking U.S. official. "There is
Israel, but that presents all kinds
of other problems. Egypt, after
all, is an Arab country."
U.S. officials say that origi

nally the American willingness
to get deeply involved here
sprang from three main consid
erations:
— Sadat's peace treaty with Is
rael was largely a response to
U.S. urging, and the United
States therefore had an in
creased responsibility to be
"fair" in dividing up its aid to
Israel and Egypt.
Against this background, U.S.
economic aid grew from a "quick
fox" to display the fruits of
friendship with the United States
into an open-ended project
aimed at revamping much of the
country's economic organiza
tion.
— The run-down Egyptian
military — its MIG23 fighters
and many of its MCG2Is are re
ported grounded for lack of re
pairs — was in need of refitting
to meet what is regarded as a
potential threat from the heavy
arsenal built up by neighboring
Libya under the unpredictable
and hostile Col. Moammar Kha
dafi.
— Sadat's definition of Egyp
tian interests made him the most
valuable U.S. friend in the Arab
world. The Egyptian president
also showed himself willing to
use Egyptian forces and arms for
causes supported by the United
States, making military aid to
them possible without the red
flag of direct U.S. help.
U.S. pleased
Although Egyptian officials
reject Arab suggestions that they
are acting as U.S. surrogates, the
aid operations coincide with U.S.
policy, and American officials
here express satisfaction at se
eing U.S. friends receive such
help without direct U.S. in
volvement.
Egyptians emphasize, how
ever, that none of Sadat's com
mitments has been written into
formal treaties such as those that
bound Egypt to accord military
facilities to the Soviet Union dur
ing the years of Soviet influence
and aid here.
"Each situation would have to
be considered on a case-by-case
basis," said an Egyptian gov
ernment official. "As long as our
interests coincide, fine. If not
.. ." he added, trailing off and
flicking his hand into the air.
