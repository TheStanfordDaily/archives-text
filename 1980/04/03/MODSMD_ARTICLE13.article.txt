# Fragmented by geographic separation
## French territories look to independence 
### Jean-Marie Juge Agence France-Presse 
PARIS — Scattered across three oceans.
France's fragmentary overseas departments
and territories (Dom-Tom in the administra
tive term) are the vestiges of a colonial con
quest which today are living on borrowed
time — headed ultimately to go the emanci
pated way of the rest of the former French
empire.
"A real threat is hanging over them, albeit
unequally distributed."' Paul Dijoud, secret
ary of state for the Dom-Tom. said recently.
Fie was commenting on what he described as
the "at times seditious character" of current
unrest in one overseas trouble spot.
The spot in question is the overseas de
partment of Martinique, a Caribbean island
which, on paper at least, is no less geographi
cally a part of the French Republic than the
departments of the Seine Maritime or the
Pyrenees Atlantiques.
Castro influence
"In the Antilles-Caribbean region, Cas
trist activity is more and more pronounced."
said Dijoud. who believes that Castrism is
now taking over where Soviet influence left
off.
The question has been rather differently
formulated by Martinique's black poet
politician, Aime Cesaire. Colonies, he de
clares, are like fruit — "When they're ripe,
they fall."
In Cesaire's view, the two French Antilles

departments of Martinique and Guadeloupe
are already ripe and will be "soon and ines
capably independent."
Independence
Though the symptoms of pro-freedom
ferment have so far been fairly unevenly
manifested throughout the Dom-Tom, inde
pendence itself is everywhere an electoral
issue in these remote fragments of France
dispersed across the Pacific, the Atlantic and
the Indian Oceans.
Vocal energy with, on occasion, industrial
unrest tend to be the most characteristic ex
pression of the local pro-independence fac
tions in overseas France. Nevertheless cer
tain foreign capitals find the factions invalu
able for stirring up feeling against the French
presence.
Escalation
In Guadeloupe, there have even been ap
preciable signs of escalation. A movement
calling itself the "armed liberation group"
has claimed responsibility for an attack
against a local member of parliament.
The group has, moreover, issued an ul
timatum to all ethnic French on the island to
get out before Dec. 3 1 or else face reprisals.
With such signs looming on the horizon,
Dijoud recently has issued emphatic public
warnings that in the event of outside attack,
France will defend its overseas departments
as energetically as it would its home soil.
Territories coveted
Recent history has made it plain that the
French territories are coveted bv some

foreign countries.
Even before Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
currently accused of supporting Antilles in
dependent movements, Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafi had declared open sup
port for all liberation movements or political
parties that favored driving out the white
man from the Indian Ocean region.
These past two years a notable target for
Libyan subversion, helped along by the Or
ganization for African Unity liberation
committee, has been the French Indian
Ocean department of La Reunion. Such out
side efforts to promote independence have
brought strong protests from France.
Madagascar, a member of the OAU ad hoc
committee aimed at helping La Reunion
achieve independence, is pressing the French
to give back a string of strategic French-held
islands in the straits of Mozambique which it
claims.
The Madagascan government submitted
the dispute to the United Nations, and Fr
ance was told by the U.N. special political
commission last Nov. 30 to open negotia
tions with Madagascar on handing back the
islands.
The recently-independent Comores Is
lands Republic is hoping that the support it
has raised inside the U.N. and the OAU will
soon end in acquiring nearby Mayotte Island
— even though the island voted overwhelm
ingly to remain French in a Feb. 1976 re
ferendum.

presence.
Escalation
In Guadeloupe, there have even been ap
preciable signs of escalation. A movement
calling itself the "armed liberation group"
has claimed responsibility for an attack
against a local member of parliament.
The group has, moreover, issued an ul
timatum to all ethnic French on the island to
get out before Dec. 3 1 or else face reprisals.
With such signs looming on the horizon,
Dijoud recently has issued emphatic public
warnings that in the event of outside attack,
France will defend its overseas departments
as energetically as it would its home soil.
Territories coveted
Recent history has made it plain that the
French territories are coveted bv some

foreign countries.
Even before Cuban leader Fidel Castro,
currently accused of supporting Antilles in
dependent movements, Libyan leader
Moammar Khadafi had declared open sup
port for all liberation movements or political
parties that favored driving out the white
man from the Indian Ocean region.
These past two years a notable target for
Libyan subversion, helped along by the Or
ganization for African Unity liberation
committee, has been the French Indian
Ocean department of La Reunion. Such out
side efforts to promote independence have
brought strong protests from France.
Madagascar, a member of the OAU ad hoc
committee aimed at helping La Reunion
achieve independence, is pressing the French
to give back a string of strategic French-held
islands in the straits of Mozambique which it
claims.
The Madagascan government submitted
the dispute to the United Nations, and Fr
ance was told by the U.N. special political
commission last Nov. 30 to open negotia
tions with Madagascar on handing back the
islands.
The recently-independent Comores Is
lands Republic is hoping that the support it
has raised inside the U.N. and the OAU will
soon end in acquiring nearby Mayotte Island
— even though the island voted overwhelm
ingly to remain French in a Feb. 1976 re
ferendum.
