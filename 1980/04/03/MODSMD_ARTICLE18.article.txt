# Test-tube baby lab opens in Virginia
## 
### R.D. Gersh Associated Press Writer 
NORFOLK, Va. — There are
no babies and few test tubes in
the 10-by-12-foot room known
as the test-tube baby laboratory
at Norfolk General Hospital.
The lab does contain an in
cubator, a microscope and a
stack of half a dozen small plastic
petri dishes, in which human
eggs are fertilized by human
sperm.
It also holds the hopes of many
women and men who want to be
mothers and fathers, and the
fears of some who envision the
coming of a Brave New World.
The hospital won state ap
proval to build the lab Jan. 8.
Two months later, a spokesman
for Eastern Virginia Medical
School, whose doctors run the

clinic, acknowledged, "The lab is
in operation."
The lab is the first of its kind in
the United States and has al
ready earned Norfolk a certain
notoriety. On the door of the of
fice of the hospital's public rela
tions director is a bumper sticker
reading: "Norfolkians Do It in a
Dish."
An original seven couples
were accepted for the program,
out of thousands who applied.
There were 2500 couples on the
initial waiting list; the day after
the lab got state approval, 300
more called in.
An unspecified number of
women have gone through the
process of in vitro fertilization, in
which an egg is surgically re
moved from the woman's ovary,
fertilized with her husband's
sperm in the petri dish.and trans
ferred to the woman's uterus.
The hospital has not said, and
will not say, if successful preg
nancies have been achieved.
EVNS spokesman Vernon
Jones said the clinic's doctors,
led by the husband-and-wife
team of Howard and
Georgeanna Jones, want to
"shield the ladies" from distur
bances that could disrupt the
hormone levels crucial for suc
cessful implantations.
The patients are women
whose Fallopian tubes, the con
duits from ovary to uterus, are
missing or irreparably blocked.
Jones described the process as
sort of a "Fallopian tube bypass.
We're providing the passage. It's
sort of like a helicopter picking
up cargo — the egg — in one
place and putting it in another."
He said the clinic should be
able to treat about 50 women a
year. The procedure costs about
$4000. Blue-Cross of Virginia
has said it will not pay the costs.
The women see in vitro fertili
zation as their last chance to bear
children. But others see it as the
first step toward something un
safe and immoral.
Opponents of the procedure
have three main complaints: that
it has not been tested enough;
that fertilized eggs, which some
consider the beginning of life,
will be destroyed if not develop
ing properly; and that defective
embryos will be aborted.
They say they also fear that in
vitro fertilization will lead to
production — out of the womb
— of genetically controlled

babies, as described in Aldous
Huxley's Brave New World.
The Tidewater Chapter of the
anti-abortion Virginia Society
for Human Life failed in its at
tempt to get state Attorney Gen
eral Marshall Coleman to seek
an injunction against the clinic.
Norfolk businessman Charles
Dean, chapter president, said the
group plans further legal action,
partly on the grounds the state
review was not done properly.
But doctors involved with the
clinic claim the fears are un
founded.
They said that the procedure
has been carried out safely in
England — where Louise Brown,
the world's first "test tube
baby," was born in 1978 — and
Australia, that abortions will be
neither more nor less available to
clinic patients than to other pre
gnant women, and that they have
no intention of mass producing
human beings.
Dr. Jack Rary, the EVNS sci
entist who runs the lab, said fer
tilization is attempted on only
one egg at a time.
Rary is responsible for check
ing to see if an eggis contained in
the fluid removed from the wo
man, for setting up the egg for
fertilization, and for determining
if fertilization has taken place.
But he noted that doctors do
not make the final determination
whether the egg is good — able
to be fertilized.
"The sperm know which eggs

are good," he said. "We don't
have to make that decision."
If fertilization does take place
in a petri dish, usually within 1 2
hours, the fertilized egg is incu
bated for another 36 hours and
then transferred to the uterus.
That's about the same time
span an egg fertilized naturally
would take to travel down to the
uterus and implant itself, Rary
said.
Rary said he knew the clinic
wouldn't receive unanimous ap
proval, "but I had no idea there
would be that much opposition.
"I guess I'm looking at it diffe
rently, that we'd truly be helping
people who couldn't have
babies," he said.
Rary said he has invited some
opponents to visit the lab but
none have accepted so far.

ready earned Norfolk a certain
notoriety. On the door of the of
fice of the hospital's public rela
tions director is a bumper sticker
reading: "Norfolkians Do It in a
Dish."
An original seven couples
were accepted for the program,
out of thousands who applied.
There were 2500 couples on the
initial waiting list; the day after
the lab got state approval, 300
more called in.
An unspecified number of
women have gone through the
process of in vitro fertilization, in
which an egg is surgically re
moved from the woman's ovary,
fertilized with her husband's
sperm in the petri dish.and trans
ferred to the woman's uterus.
The hospital has not said, and
will not say, if successful preg
nancies have been achieved.
EVNS spokesman Vernon
Jones said the clinic's doctors,
led by the husband-and-wife
team of Howard and
Georgeanna Jones, want to
"shield the ladies" from distur
bances that could disrupt the
hormone levels crucial for suc
cessful implantations.
The patients are women
whose Fallopian tubes, the con
duits from ovary to uterus, are
missing or irreparably blocked.
Jones described the process as
sort of a "Fallopian tube bypass.
We're providing the passage. It's
sort of like a helicopter picking
up cargo — the egg — in one
place and putting it in another."
He said the clinic should be
able to treat about 50 women a
year. The procedure costs about
$4000. Blue-Cross of Virginia
has said it will not pay the costs.
The women see in vitro fertili
zation as their last chance to bear
children. But others see it as the
first step toward something un
safe and immoral.
Opponents of the procedure
have three main complaints: that
it has not been tested enough;
that fertilized eggs, which some
consider the beginning of life,
will be destroyed if not develop
ing properly; and that defective
embryos will be aborted.
They say they also fear that in
vitro fertilization will lead to
production — out of the womb
— of genetically controlled

babies, as described in Aldous
Huxley's Brave New World.
The Tidewater Chapter of the
anti-abortion Virginia Society
for Human Life failed in its at
tempt to get state Attorney Gen
eral Marshall Coleman to seek
an injunction against the clinic.
Norfolk businessman Charles
Dean, chapter president, said the
group plans further legal action,
partly on the grounds the state
review was not done properly.
But doctors involved with the
clinic claim the fears are un
founded.
They said that the procedure
has been carried out safely in
England — where Louise Brown,
the world's first "test tube
baby," was born in 1978 — and
Australia, that abortions will be
neither more nor less available to
clinic patients than to other pre
gnant women, and that they have
no intention of mass producing
human beings.
Dr. Jack Rary, the EVNS sci
entist who runs the lab, said fer
tilization is attempted on only
one egg at a time.
Rary is responsible for check
ing to see if an eggis contained in
the fluid removed from the wo
man, for setting up the egg for
fertilization, and for determining
if fertilization has taken place.
But he noted that doctors do
not make the final determination
whether the egg is good — able
to be fertilized.
"The sperm know which eggs

are good," he said. "We don't
have to make that decision."
If fertilization does take place
in a petri dish, usually within 1 2
hours, the fertilized egg is incu
bated for another 36 hours and
then transferred to the uterus.
That's about the same time
span an egg fertilized naturally
would take to travel down to the
uterus and implant itself, Rary
said.
Rary said he knew the clinic
wouldn't receive unanimous ap
proval, "but I had no idea there
would be that much opposition.
"I guess I'm looking at it diffe
rently, that we'd truly be helping
people who couldn't have
babies," he said.
Rary said he has invited some
opponents to visit the lab but
none have accepted so far.
NORFOLK, Va. — There are
no babies and few test tubes in
the 10-by-12-foot room known
as the test-tube baby laboratory
at Norfolk General Hospital.
The lab does contain an in
cubator, a microscope and a
stack of half a dozen small plastic
petri dishes, in which human
eggs are fertilized by human
sperm.
It also holds the hopes of many
women and men who want to be
mothers and fathers, and the
fears of some who envision the
coming of a Brave New World.
The hospital won state ap
proval to build the lab Jan. 8.
Two months later, a spokesman
for Eastern Virginia Medical
School, whose doctors run the

clinic, acknowledged, "The lab is
in operation."
