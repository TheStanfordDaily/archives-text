On May 31,1978, the U.S. Supreme Court
ruled that police officers can conduct surprise
searches of innocent people in order to see if
they might have evidence of crimes someone
else committed. The decision wasn't horrifying
to us just because it happened to be in the case
of '/archer v. Stanford Daily — rather, as we
pointed out in our editorial the day after the
decision, "the Supreme Court has chipped away
at the foundations which underlie our most fun
damental freedoms — the freedom to be secure
in our homes and offices from unreasonable
searches, and the freedom of the press. . . . Yes
terday's decision may have serious implications
for a broad range of individuals who have in
formation about a crime, but are not suspected
of committing it."
Since May 1978, law enforcement officials
have viewed the high court's decision as a green
light to search lawyers' offices in California,
Minnesota, Oregon and Texas, and the records
of hospitals in California and Colorado — even
though none of those searched were suspected of
having committed any criminal activity.
A few states have enacted legislation to help
restore our constitutional protections; other
states are still considering such legislation. Bills
were also introduced in Congress; committees
have held hearings on and off since last summer
on this legislation. Since February, a Senate
subcommittee has begun to vote on sections of
one bill.
Of the many bills which are pending in Con
gress, we support S. 115 and its House counter
part. HR 4181 (sponsored by Sen. Charles
Mathias and Rep. Thomas Railsback, respec
tively). These bills will protect the rights of all
citizens, and not just those of lawyers, doctors,
or journalists. They will not permit the searches
of people who aren't suspects unless it appears
that the evidence in their possession will be

destroyed or removed from the court's jurisdic
tion. The bills allow aggrieved persons the right
to bring lawsuits against police officers and gov
ernmental units who violate their rights by sub
jecting them to these raids.
And these bills allow for people who win their
case to recover attorneys' fees and costs.
We do not support the Carter Administra
tion's bill — HR 3486 — and its senate counter
part, S. 855. These bills will only protect jour
nalists and others engaged in First Amendment
research; furthermore, the bills permit searches
when "national security" information is in
volved. The last 20 years have certainly shown
us how the government has abused its classifica
tion powers and then prosecuted those who
have dared to bring vital information before the
public's attention.
Nor can we support HR 1437, introduced by
Rep. Dan Ouayle and co-sponsored by 30 other
Congressmen, including Rep. Paul McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) and Rep. John Anderson of
Illinois. Though this bill seeks to protect the
rights of all citizens and does not allow for " na
tional security" searches, its bark is far greater
than its bite. The bill is unclear about whom
search victims can sue, and the bill doesn't pro
hibit police from using defenses such as that
they searched "in good faith"; the bill also does
not allow for awarding attorneys' fees and costs
to victorious search victims, thus leaving people
who have been wrongfully searched the choice
of either doing nothing or trying to match in
court the virtually limitless resources of state
and federal governments who will be defending
these suits.
We hope you will join us in support of the
Mathias/Railsback bill. We urge you to write
your legislators today urging them to support
our right to privacy and confidentiality with
lawyers, doctors, clergy and the press.

they searched "in good faith"; the bill also does
not allow for awarding attorneys' fees and costs
to victorious search victims, thus leaving people
who have been wrongfully searched the choice
of either doing nothing or trying to match in
court the virtually limitless resources of state
and federal governments who will be defending
these suits.
We hope you will join us in support of the
Mathias/Railsback bill. We urge you to write
your legislators today urging them to support
our right to privacy and confidentiality with
lawyers, doctors, clergy and the press.
