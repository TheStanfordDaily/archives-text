# Students sheltered here

### 
Probably every Stanford stu
dent. at one time or another,
comments on the need to get
away from what can be a stifling
campus environment, to regain
perspective on his life at the Uni
versity. We journey to the City,
the mountains or the beach, and
comment on how good it is to get
back to "reality." We seem to
sense that life as we know it at
Stanford is in some ways very

"unreal." But none of the places
we visit for a break take us back
into the real mainstream of
American society, in its most
basic, ordinary, common form.
Believe it or not, it was last
week at Disneyland that I felt for
the first time in a long time like 1
was back in the mainstream of
American life.
You cannot imagine all the dif
ferent kinds of humanity to be
experienced in a place like Dis
neyland unless you have been to
someplace similar very recently.
It was thoroughly American be
cause there was no single "type"
of person. It was a tremendous
amalgamation of shapes, sizes,
attitudes, expressions,
backgrounds, faces.
It was fascinating. I thought to
myself, Walt Disney did it. He
made a place where everyone
comes: the rich and the poor, the
whites, blacks and chicanos;
families and old people, young
couples; the attractive and the

ugly, the fat and the spindly.
There were cute babies, and
plain old ugly babies, smiling
babies and crying babies, plain
people and very odd people. It
was a people-watching ex
travaganza.
But underlying my fascination
with all these different kinds of
people was an uneasiness. Why
did 1 feel as though I had been set
loose in a world that 1 had not

seen in months, maybe years?
The answer had to be that the
University is simply a very shel
tered, limited environment. Our
lives here consist mainly of in
teraction with sophisticated, suc
cessful, intelligent people, in al
most complete seclusion from
the rest of American life. My
brief journey out of this envi
ronment left me feeling that I
could only "mingle" 'with the
people at Disneyland, fascinated
by the diversity, and sadly aware
that basically I have little in
common with any of them.
Against the background of
Disneyland, the concept of di
versity among the students at
Stanford seemed to be only a
myth. The ways in which we
categorize each other — nerds,
geeks, jocks, frat boys, sorority
women, deadheads, preppies —
these are only slight variations
on the well-defined theme of
"The Stanford Student." We are
a group of people far more nota

ble for our uniformity than for
our diversity.
Stanford is not supposed to be
like that, is it? Isn't college a
"broadeningexperience?" Well,
1 guess if being exposed to all the
other 90th-percentile-and
above students in America is a
broadening experience, then
Stanford qualifies. But one day
in Disneyland was all it took to
jolt me and convince me that the
University excludes a great deal
of mainstream American life.
What are the qualities of a
truly educational experience?
What is the value of a n education
that requires and thrives on iso
lation from a very significant
portion of the world about which
we are supposedly being edu
cated?
Of course Stanford, (for most
of us), is a four-year experience,
and certainly we are told over
and over again about how idyllic
these years of our lives are. But
the attitudes we develop during
these years will stay with us long
after we graduate. The dangers
seem to be twofold.
First, there is the fact that this
life we live "on the Farm" is
highly enjoyable, a nd some of us,
who come from simpler, more
humble backgrounds, may find
that we enjoy it so much that we
decide we can't be content with
anything else. Of course, such a
decision is a matter of choice,
and we may decide that the Stan
ford lifestyle is exactly what we
came here to achieve. But the
choice to live in seclusion needs
to be a decision and not some
thing we merely fall into.
Secondly, we all need to resist
an underlying attitude of
superiority that can easily de
velop. I doubt whether most of
us would have to stretch our im
aginations very far to think we
are in some way better and more
worthwhile human beings simply
because we are educated to solve
problem sets and write 10-page
papers. This subtle pride can
creep in and lead to concrete
categories of people worth
knowing and not worth know
ing. Eventually we will not even
want to be near "the masses;"
after all, what attitude underlies
the choice of country clubs and
beach clubs rather than public
parks and state beaches? Even
tually, we may not even like Dis
neyland.
An education that leads to
such division and categorization
promotes ignorance rather than
understanding and awareness.
