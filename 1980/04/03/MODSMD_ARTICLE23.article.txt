## Jeff Lepape Don't abuse conscientious objection 
### 
In between writing term papers and get
ting ready for finals, many 19-and 20-year
old students are already beginning to think of
ways to avoid a possible draft. It is quite
likely that they will come across organiza
tions in the near future that will encourage
them to become a part of their "church" in
order to become a conscientious objector.
Before everyone goes rushing off to be
come a minister or a pseudoreligious fanatic,
I think it is important to explain what a con
scientious objector really is and how wide
spread abuse of this privilege could have
negative repercussions.
The most recent Supreme Court cases
concerning conscientious objector (CO)
status have been based on Section 6 (j) of the
Universal Military Training and Service Act
of 1948 that exempts from combatant milit
ary service any person "who by reason of
religious training and belief is conscienti
ously opposed to participation in war in any
form." Religion was defined in the act as a
"belief in a relation to a Supreme Being in
volving duties superior to those arising from
any human relation, but not including essen
tially political, sociological, or philosophical

views or a merely personal moral code."
Congress passed an amendment to the Act in
1967 that deleted the "relation to a Supreme
Being" clause.
In Welsh vs. United States (1970), the Sup
reme Court gave a broad interpretation of
the definition of a CO. The justices decided
that Section 6 (j) did not exclude "those who
hold strong beliefs about our domestic and
foreign affairs or even those whose conscien
tious objection to participation in all wars is
founded to a substantial extent upon consid
erations of public policy." It should be noted,
however, that it is still necessary to have a
deeply rooted religious belief.
If there is a draft, the draft boards and the
courts will be determining whether the re
ligious beliefs are truly held by people claim
ing to be CO's. It is unconstitutional, though,
to question the validity of the beliefs.
One negative repercussion that could re
sult if a large number of people decide to lie
about their beliefs and their religious prac
tices is that some people who are truly religi
ous will be sent to war or prison. How could
this happen?
First of all, the truly religious objector may

not he as convincing in an interview before
the draft board as the numerous pseudo CO's
who have been practicing for months in an
ticipation of the questions they will be asked.
Secondly, not all people who work for the
government are dummies; it is possible that
they will recognize attempts to organize mass
support to abuse the CO exemption and will
thereby begin using stricter scrutiny in de
termining how strongly beliefs are held. This
occurrence would again jeopardize the
chances of those who are truly religious.
Maybe you are one of a growing number of
people, however, who believes that it is un
constitutional not to include CO exemption
to those atheists and agnostics who have be
liefs that are also strongly held and deeply
rooted in their conscience. This objection
could rest on the First Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution, which says that : "Con
gress shall make no law respecting the estab
lishment of religion . . If you do feel this
way, it seems to me that it would be more
productive to aggressively push for a reform
of the law rather than to cowardly seek a
loophole.
