## Occupy Seabrook-'change the world' 
### 
At Seabrook, New Hampshire, 3500 miles
from here, there is a nuclear plant that is 40
percent completed. Almost all of the other
70-plus nuclear plants (not to mention
weapons labs, bomb factories, waste sites
and uranium mines) in the United States are
closer to us than the Seabrook station. And
yet, next month, I'm going 3500 miles to join
thousands of other people to try and non
violently occupy the Seabrook nuke.
Why? I'm not into traveling. Actually I'm
ready to settle down for a while. If only there
were the energy and commitment to do the
same here in California — at the Diablo Ca
nyon reactor perhaps, 99 percent complete
and sitting on an earthquake fault, or at Ran
cho Seco, the Three Mile Island clone, or at
Livermore where the bombs are designed.
But the movement is younger here than it is
in New England. At Seabrook it has reached
a new level, and that is why I'm going back.
Going back because this is the second at
tempt to occupy that site. Last Oct. 6, 3000
people (including four of us from Palo Alto
and Stanford) trudged through miles of
swamp to confront hundreds of police and
National Guardsmen. Our goal was to do a
"mass fence take-down" and then non
violently move onto the site and start a com
munity. Some fence came down . . . and then
the police came out and got very violent.
Very few of us got on the site and those
who did were badly beaten and dragged off.
But during those four rainy days in New
Hampshire something special did happen;
we realized that what we were trying to do
was not necessary, but possible. And we
realized we were a community already.
The action that day was the most controv

ersial action in the anti-nuclear movement. It
was denounced by Jane Fonda, Tom
Hayden, Barry Commoner, Sam Lovejoy
and various other "heavies." They said,
"You can't tear down fences, you can't resist
arrest non-violently, you can't refuse to
make deals with the authorities; the masses
won't understand, you'll alienate them."
I myself have never met the masses — if
they even exist. The people of Seabrook (and
Boston only 40 miles away) didn't freak out.
Polls and newspapers agreed that they sup
ported our attempt to directly stop nuclear
power. Property? The authorities? Justice?
What do they mean?
The Coalition for Direct Action at Seab
rook has some interesting positions on these
issues. It rejects "private property" when it
means building profitable and deadly
machines like nuclear plants. "The au
thorities" are part of the problem — not the
solution.
People can, and should, organize their own
lives and have control over them, as Seab
rook Town — which has voted against that
nuke againand again as have the neighboring
towns — doesn't have . . . yet. And justice?
Well it is seldom found in the courts. If you
don't believe me check it out yourself. Justice
lies somewhere within us maybe. Or as a
quality of our lives, our actions. It is not in
law school. It might be in a forest. Now as
good Stanford students, faculty and staff, this
rejection of private property, the state, law
school (and even Jane Fonda!) must seem
like anarchy; it might strike you as insane.
Perhaps. I'm not as righteous and sure of
myself as I was at 19 when I came to .the
University eight years ago. But insane?

Compared to what, the world we have now?
You must be kidding. We all know how close
things are to the edge. Nature dies around us
as it dies within us, poisoned by a society that
equates buying with being, owning with liv
ing. And there is always the bomb.
But I'm not going to Seabrook just be
cause I'm scared, just because I have a clear
and morbid imagination. I'm going because I
can imagine something more than
apocalypse. I can imagine a world where hu
mans live as part of nature — not over it;
where people make their decisions collec
tively — not hierarchically, where men can
cry and women can lead, and where the lie
and the horror of our plastic, hypocritical and
superficial democracy is recognized for what
it is. I can imagine thousands of people non
violently, with love even, risking great vio
lence to try and make a better world. Be
cause I saw all this at Seabrook.
It was far from perfect, of course. (What is
perfect, except dreams or academics?) But it
was good. There were people from all over
the country, from all over the political spec
trum; Harvard libertarian Marxists and
machinists from Dorchester; gypsies from
Arizona and anarchist-feminists from Seat
tle; 60-year-old New Hampshire farmers
and loggers from Maine. We didn't agree
about everything of course, but we listened
to each other. And we were open to change
— lots of it.
Change, that's what is going to have to
happen if the system (wonder?) we call life is
going to continue on the planet we call earth.
That's why I'm going to Seabrook — to try
and change the world. Nothing less will do.

happen if the system (wonder?) we call life is
going to continue on the planet we call earth.
That's why I'm going to Seabrook — to try
and change the world. Nothing less will do.

At Seabrook, New Hampshire, 3500 miles
from here, there is a nuclear plant that is 40
percent completed. Almost all of the other
70-plus nuclear plants (not to mention
weapons labs, bomb factories, waste sites
and uranium mines) in the United States are
closer to us than the Seabrook station. And
yet, next month, I'm going 3500 miles to join
thousands of other people to try and non
violently occupy the Seabrook nuke.
Why? I'm not into traveling. Actually I'm
ready to settle down for a while. If only there
were the energy and commitment to do the
same here in California — at the Diablo Ca
nyon reactor perhaps, 99 percent complete
and sitting on an earthquake fault, or at Ran
cho Seco, the Three Mile Island clone, or at
Livermore where the bombs are designed.
But the movement is younger here than it is
in New England. At Seabrook it has reached
a new level, and that is why I'm going back.
Going back because this is the second at
tempt to occupy that site. Last Oct. 6, 3000
people (including four of us from Palo Alto
and Stanford) trudged through miles of
swamp to confront hundreds of police and
National Guardsmen. Our goal was to do a
"mass fence take-down" and then non
violently move onto the site and start a com
munity. Some fence came down . . . and then
the police came out and got very violent.
Very few of us got on the site and those
who did were badly beaten and dragged off.
But during those four rainy days in New
Hampshire something special did happen;
we realized that what we were trying to do
was not necessary, but possible. And we
realized we were a community already.
The action that day was the most controv

ersial action in the anti-nuclear movement. It
was denounced by Jane Fonda, Tom
Hayden, Barry Commoner, Sam Lovejoy
and various other "heavies." They said,
"You can't tear down fences, you can't resist
arrest non-violently, you can't refuse to
make deals with the authorities; the masses
won't understand, you'll alienate them."
I myself have never met the masses — if
they even exist. The people of Seabrook (and
Boston only 40 miles away) didn't freak out.
Polls and newspapers agreed that they sup
ported our attempt to directly stop nuclear
power. Property? The authorities? Justice?
What do they mean?
The Coalition for Direct Action at Seab
rook has some interesting positions on these
issues. It rejects "private property" when it
means building profitable and deadly
machines like nuclear plants. "The au
thorities" are part of the problem — not the
solution.
People can, and should, organize their own
lives and have control over them, as Seab
rook Town — which has voted against that
nuke againand again as have the neighboring
towns — doesn't have . . . yet. And justice?
Well it is seldom found in the courts. If you
don't believe me check it out yourself. Justice
lies somewhere within us maybe. Or as a
quality of our lives, our actions. It is not in
law school. It might be in a forest. Now as
good Stanford students, faculty and staff, this
rejection of private property, the state, law
school (and even Jane Fonda!) must seem
like anarchy; it might strike you as insane.
Perhaps. I'm not as righteous and sure of
myself as I was at 19 when I came to .the
University eight years ago. But insane?

Compared to what, the world we have now?
You must be kidding. We all know how close
things are to the edge. Nature dies around us
as it dies within us, poisoned by a society that
equates buying with being, owning with liv
ing. And there is always the bomb.
But I'm not going to Seabrook just be
cause I'm scared, just because I have a clear
and morbid imagination. I'm going because I
can imagine something more than
apocalypse. I can imagine a world where hu
mans live as part of nature — not over it;
where people make their decisions collec
tively — not hierarchically, where men can
cry and women can lead, and where the lie
and the horror of our plastic, hypocritical and
superficial democracy is recognized for what
it is. I can imagine thousands of people non
violently, with love even, risking great vio
lence to try and make a better world. Be
cause I saw all this at Seabrook.
It was far from perfect, of course. (What is
perfect, except dreams or academics?) But it
was good. There were people from all over
the country, from all over the political spec
trum; Harvard libertarian Marxists and
machinists from Dorchester; gypsies from
Arizona and anarchist-feminists from Seat
tle; 60-year-old New Hampshire farmers
and loggers from Maine. We didn't agree
about everything of course, but we listened
to each other. And we were open to change
— lots of it.
Change, that's what is going to have to
happen if the system (wonder?) we call life is
going to continue on the planet we call earth.
That's why I'm going to Seabrook — to try
