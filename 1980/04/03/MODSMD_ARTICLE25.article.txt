Price of freedom
News of the White Plaza
anti-draft rally, as reported in
The Stanford Observer (Jan. 29)
and a number of national week
lies, left me somewhat dismayed,
but hardly surprised. It was not
so long ago that I, too, was safe in
the womb of academia, quick to
vociferate upon any apparent in
fringement of my personal free
dom.
Sure, to those of us born in a
free country, the concept of
fighting for one's freedom is
alien. TTie threat is difficult to
discern.
As an American military man,
I receive a heartier welcome in

Trieste, Dubrovnik and Athens
than I do here at home. Why?
Perhaps my presence over there
is a bit of insurance against a
threat to their freedom, a threat
of which we Americans, sadly,
are too slowly becoming aware.
Must it come knocking on our
door?
Soon, it will be too late to pay
for "insurance" ... we may be
paying much more dearly. Vigi
lance is still the price of freedom.

Violence at iault
Eli Khouri, in his admonish
ment of the Inter-Fraternity

Council for its decision to avoid
association with Penthouse, ig
nored the most basic distinction
many of us tried to bring out in
the past two weeks. In this letter
I can only speak for myself.
I am not opposed to pornog
raphy and other forms of erotic
art. What I am against is the vio
lence that abounds in most popu
lar pornography, including
Playboy and â€” a violence di
rected overwhelmingly against
women.
Violence is the key problem.
The images of rape and other in
voluntary dominant/submissive
confrontations that our media
presents help perpetuate a myth.
The myth is that men can freely

have the power to dominate and
abuse women, and that women
enjoy it. (Anyone who has ever
talked to a rape victim, battered
woman, or sexually harrassed
office worker knows the lie this
myth is.)
Rape is an aggressive, violent
crime. The gratification for the
rapist is power and dominance,
not at all sexual. I contend that
the manipulated image of hap
pily submissive women helps to
create a culture where men not
only feel the desire, but also the
right to dominate women, even
violently.
To deny the connections bet
ween the pervasive media and
pornography violence and real.

daily behavior and attitudes, is to
ignore the intricacies of our so
cial fabric. Unfortunately, ignor
ance is often easier and more ac
ceptable than change.
