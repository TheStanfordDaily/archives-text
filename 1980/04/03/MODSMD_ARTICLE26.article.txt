## Avedon: sensitive still cinema verite 
### 
Rumpled. They stand there
looking impishly out at the
museum's large central hall,
laughing at those strange
characters across the cavern
ous space. Yes, the Chicago
Seven are up there on the
wall, larger than life, smiling
to themselves and downright
making fun of their compan
ions, American Mission to
Vietnam, 1971. Photo
grapher Richard Avedon
caught the Seven looking un
guarded, and caught the mis
sion (consisting of such
heavies as Geti. Creighton
Abrams) looking very
straight, very linear. Typical.
The Seven are chuckling and
the ambassadors, generals
and diplomats seem typically
constipated.
That is one of Avedon's
fortes — he captures people
doing what is typical of them,
not what is alien or incongru
ous. The picture he presents is
what he sees, but it is not a
staged or falsified notion of
reality — subjective but
grounded in the actual shape
of things.
From Louisiana mental pa

tients to his dying father, Av
edon has caught a slice of real
ity from 1946 to 1980, the
years this exhibit covers.
His subjects are the heroes
of this chronicle, and he lends
them a credence and an integ
rity that is too often lost when
photographers go on the
rampage. Diane Arbus, for
instance, known for her
front-on pictures of the poor
and the "freaks," makes her
self the hero of her pictures —
the all-seeing eye that peers
cynically at the world and
makes a sarcastic statement
about anything different than
her. Avedon's awareness of
his subject and his subject's
awareness of him lacks the
perverse voyeurism of Arbus'
images. The mental patients
retain their dignity, even in
the austerity, dumpiness and
neglect of the ward.
But his subjects are not just
the pathos-arousing; he has a
fantastic series of a dramatic
production of Alice in Won
derland — the pictures are
lined up in a long, 2V2-foot
wide crevice. Walk in and you
are falling, Alice-like,

through a substitute
looking glass, into a Wonder
land, into another reality and
why come back? Just flow
into a surrealistic universe of
the White Rabbit, of caterpil
lars with hookahs and White
Knights and stay there as long
as you want.
The intimacy of that tunnel
is much different from the
open expanse of central hall
or the rooms filled with Av
edon's pictures of fashion
models. The skylight in the
central hall dims and
brightens with the cloud
cover and time of day; the
light in the fashion cubicles
stays incandescent; the
people looking at the fashion
models fry, unfortunately,
under the klieg lights.
Another minor drawback
to the exhibit is, to an extent,
the hanging in some places.
With nearly 400 prints (the
largest Avedon exhibit to
date), there is bound to be
some sensory overload on the
visitors. The pictures are gen
erally well-spaced, but one
series of portraits of promi
nent social, corporate and

political figures is stacked five
high and eight wide; Sx 10-
inch prints crunched almost
bumper-to-bumper. Though
the bank of photos is impres
sive, the arrangement makes
it substantially more difficult
to view. But that is, for the
most part, an exception.
Avedon's pictures are the
past 35 years in a microcosm.
There you will find Marilyn
Monroe as success was catch
ing up with her, refugees in
post-World War II Rome,
aging writers and "Beat Gen
eration" poets.
So you finish looking at all
that history — each picture

with its short title and date,
and you walk back out to the
central lobby and stare at the
hippie freaks and at the
tight-assed administration
higher-ups. Look at the
Seven laugh. You can see
exactly why the higher-ups
never stood a chance.
