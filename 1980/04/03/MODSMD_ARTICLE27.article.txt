# Beckett premiere in Mem Aud
## 
### 
The West Coast premiere of a
Saniuel Beckett monologue has
been moved to Memorial Au
ditorium.
The 4:30 p.m. Friday perfor
mance of A Piece of Monologue
had been scheduled for the Little
Theater. But, demand for seats
prompted the change, according
to the Drama Department,
which is sponsoring the event.
Actor David Warrilow will
present the one-man show,
which runs about 55 minutes.
Drama Prof. Martin Esslin will
discuss the play after the perfor
mance.
A Piece of Monologue
made its world premiere in New
York last December.
Seats no longer are reserved.
