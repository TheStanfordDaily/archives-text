# Zappa, tonight: still mad
## 
### 
"Suicide Champ." "Pick Me
I'm Clean." "Charlie's Enor
mous Mouth."
The last time Frank Zappa was
out this way, he wrote his own
press releases. Hi, he said, I'm
Frank Zappa and this is my
music. Like it or else.
Hi at was three years ago.
Today, Mr. Zappa has cut his
hair, lost some weight and added
a little class to his act. He has
someone else writing his public
ity, and he even wears clean
shirts onstage.
He still sings the same kind of
stuff, though, witness the new ti
tles above, but he has brought
himself up to date; "1 Don't
Wanna Get Drafted" is his latest
single.
Looking like a new Zappa
while singing like the old isn't so
bad. Especially, for those who
love the guy. And. frankly, you
either do or you don't. If it's the
latter, stop reading. Nothing will

change your mind. You won't
find revelation in listening "jusi
one more time" to one of his re
cords, or in dragging yourself to
one more concert.
On the other hand, if you
know and love the mad Mr. Z,
it's worth your while to visit with
him in Maples tonight at 8.1 saw
him up north last month. Outside
he's cleaned up and cool, but in
side where it counts he still rages
and roars.
His hand this time around in
cludes Ike Willis and Ray White
on rhythm guitar. Tommy Mars
on keyboards, Arthur Barrow on
keyboards and bass, and Sinclair
Lott on drums. Everybody sings.
