# Med School dean, acting V.P.
## Crowley to vacate interim post 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
Dr. Lawrence Crowley, acting vice-president and dean of
the School of Medicine here for the past 15 months, has
asked the University to relieve him of his administrative
responsibilities, effective Aug. 31. He will continue to serve
as professor of surgery.
Crowley has served as interim dean while a University
committee has searched for a permanent vice-president for
medical affairs to head the multimillion-dollar Medical
Center.
The position was left vacant when Dr. Clayton Rich,
previous vice-president and dean, resigned in 1978.
In a letter to President Richard Lyman, Crowley said the
problems faced by the Medical Center "must be properly
and resolutely addressed by someone in a confirmed leader
ship role rather than by an individual in a continuing acting
capacity."
Though he could not be reached for comment, Crowley
stated in the letter that he still wants to be considered for the
permanent vice-president post.
University Provost Donald Kennedy said Crowley is
among the top contenders for that post, adding that "Crow
ley has done a much better job than one normally expects
from an individual in an interim position of this type."
Kennedy also said he expects the search committee will

select a new dean by June.
Admitting the committee has taken longer than similar
committees to find a replacement for Rich, Kennedy said a
number of factors have frustrated the search effort.
"Leading candidates have been slow to let us know how
serious they are about the position," he said. Apparently,
some candidates have been unwilling to commit themselves
because of the un rtainty over who will succeed Lyman,
who has resigned, effective Aug. 1.
In addition, the committee has had to reassess its selec
tion criteria in light of Lyman's resignation, Kennedy said.
As acting dean. Crowley undertook a two-year effort to
close large projected deficits at the Med Center with the
result that the school ended in the black in 1979.
He also:
— settled an outstanding issue over reimbursement with
the state's Medi-Cal program,
— formed a liaison committee of faculty and community
physicians to develop recommendations for solving prob
lems in hospital-community relationships, and
— launched a planning process to correct building de
ficiencies at the Hospital.
Except for a period in which he served as dean of the
University of Wisconsin Medical School in Madison, Crow
ley, 60, has been associated with Stanford since 1964 as
professor of surgery, associate dean and deputy dean.
