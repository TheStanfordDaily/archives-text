Fed to raise price of credit
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve
Board yesterday in effect told millions of charge
account customers to either stop using their credit
cards or face higher monthly payments.
The board vqted to override state consumer
credit laws and let lenders raise the payments on
existing charge accounts if they give customers 30
days notice.
Consumers will have the right to pay off their
present balances under the old terms, but only if
they stop using their credit cards. By using the
card again, the consumer will automatically agree
to pay bigger payments and accept any other
changes sought by the lender.
The board actions yesterday altered credit con
trols it adopted less than three weeks ago as part
of a major anti-inflation package that included
President Jimmy Carter's budget surplus plans
for fiscal 1981.
The latest changes in the Federal Reserve's
consumer credit controls were meant to answer a
wide range of criticisms from both borrowers and
lenders, but they were immediately denounced
by consumer groups and their supporters in Con
gress.
Federal Reserve Governor Nancy Teeters,
who shepherdedthechanges through the board,
said the rules were designed to make the Fed's
credit controls uniform and fair.
The board's decision yesterday covers a wide
variety of changes in credit account terms, includ
ing increases in finance charges, imposition of
additional credit fees, a rise in minimum monthly
payments, a lowering of borrowing limits oil cre
dit cards and revisions in the way monthly bills
are calculated.
The changes also won't affect a lender's right to
increase collection activities, close existing ac
counts or stop opening new ones.
At least 17 states have laws that restrict the
power of lenders to change charge account terms
or else require that consumers be given lengthy
advance notice of any modifications.
Teeters told the board that enforcement of its
controls program is going to vary 50 different
ways if the agency did not override the state laws.
Many retailers, however, are not able to raise
interest rates significantly because they already
are bumping against state usury ceilings which are
not affected by the board's decisions.
Under the Fed's consumer credit crackdown,
lenders are to try to hold the amount of credit
they grant to what it was on March 14. when the
program was announced. If lenders permit credit
to increase, they must put 15 percent of the in
crease into non-interest-bearing accounts in a
Federal Reserve bank.
U.K. might arm female soldiers
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government suggested yesterday that
women soldiers may soon be carrying guns.
Weapons may soon be issued to female recruits
for self-defense or for guarding military bases, as
their counterparts receive arms in the United
States and some other countries. America's
150,000 women ill the 2-million-member un
iform services are barred from combat.
"There can be no question" of women engag
ing in combat in the British forces, said the docu
ment, called "Defense in the 1980s." But it said
the measure does involve arming women in

"exercises, emergency or war.
The document, presented at a news conference
by Defense Secretary Francis Pym, indicated a
shortage of men in the all-volunteer army, navy
and air force could lead to the change, which
would require parliamentary approval.
In an increasing number of countries —includ-
ing Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France and the
Netherlands —"women now are being trained in
of firearms for self-defense, or for certain
limited base defense tasks in an emergency," the
document explained.
Prime rate hits 20 percent
WASHINGTON — The prime lending rate at
many of the nation's major banks hit an incredi
ble 20 percent yesterday, with most bankers ex
pecting the rate to continue to rise.
Business borrowing is still strong despite the
unprecedented cost of loans, while the price
banks themselves are paying for the funds still is
climbing, too, analysts said.
Meanwhile, testifying before a Senate Finance
subcommittee on a bill to increase limits on the
public debt, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker said the Federal Reserve is holding
money growth to the desired levels. The Fed has
set no specific targets for 1981 as yet, he added,
but the "operative objective" for next year is to
continue monetary restraint as part of the overall
government effort to combat inflation.
A month ago the prime was percent. Six
months ago it was 13'/2 percent. It had reached
19 3 /4 percent at a few banks only this Tuesday.
"The demand for bank loans continues to be
strong, putting banks under increasing pressure,
so you can figure the prime will be moving up
ward some more before peaking," an analyst at
Merrill Lynch & Co. said.
Volcker told the Senate subcommittee that the
best thing Congress can do to lower interest rates
is "make some progress on the inflation front.
They you can see interest rates come down."
Cutting spending and balancing the budget is the
best way to do that, he said.
NYC regains railroad service
NEW YORK — Talks aimed at ending New
York's bus and subway strike got under way yes
terday and the strike against the Long Island Rail
Road was called off at least temporarily.
Unions fof the Long Island Rail Road, which
carries 200,000 commuters in Manhattan daily,
announced they will have the trains running in
time for this morning's rush hour.
Teamsters local head John Mahoney said the
seven unions were returning to work in good faith
and expect the Metropolitan Transportation Au
thority to resume serious bargaining with them,
after a promise from a federal mediator to get
negotiations reopened.
Mahoney said the strike would be resumed in
"guerrilla warfare" fashion if necessary next
week.
There was immediate speculation that
Mahoney's decision was determined by the pres
sure of the other six railroad unions and of the
possibility of contempt citations and fines under
the state law forbidding strikes by public
employees.
The bus and subway workers' leader, John
Lawe, ruled out a unilateral return to work. He

said his 33,600 Transport Workers Union mem
bers won't go back without a contract. Union and
MTA officials predicted no settlement before the
weekend at the earliest.
Mayor Edward Koch continued to cheer on
New Yorkers and to talk tough to the strikers.
The mayor does not want the 238,000 municipal
workers, with whose union leaders he must
negotiate this spring and summer, to have a large
transit wage settlement as a tempting model.
Sadat consoles angered shah
CAIRO — "Thank God, you're here safe and
sound."
President Anwar Sadat stepped up to the char
tered DC-8 after its all-night flight from Central
America and, with these words, offered the sol
ace of friendship and hospitality in Egypt to the
dispirited and seriously ill former shah of Iran.
For the homeless shah, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, Sadat's effusive welcome marked the
end of an unhappy 100-day stay in Panama that
was finally terminated by the cancer-stricken
monarch in an atmosphere of disgust at the
wrangling around him and disappointment at the
way the Carter administration was treating a
former ally in need of help.
Nine days later, after a critical operation here
to remove the shah's spleen, the chief spokesman
for the fallen "king of kings" ended a discreet
silence to condemn the conduct of Panamanian
doctors as "inhuman" and criticize the White
House for callous attitudes toward a desperately
ill U.S. friend.
In its "pressure game" to persuade the ailing
shah to stay in Panama, the Carter administration
violated the spirit, if not the letter of understand
ings, reached last December at Lackland Air
Force Base hospital in Texas as the monarch was
about to leave U.S. territory for Panama, Armad
said.
Robert Armad, spokesman for the shah, de
clined to say whether any of the shah's advisers or
friends specifically asked the White House to
readmit the shah to the United States for his
splenectomy, as reported in the United States.
But he strongly suggested that the reason the
monarch himself did not demand admission was
that he had been made to understand in advance
that it would be denied, on grounds the operation
could in the White House view be performed
safely in Panama.
Dozens hurt in Amtrak crash
LAKEVIEW, N.C. — An Amtrak train carry
ing about 300 persons through the foggy North
Carolina countryside rolled past a stop signal and
smashed head-on into a freight train yesterday,
sending dozens of passengers to hospitals for
treatment, officials said.
Rescue officials said 93 persons were taken to
Moore Memorial Hospital at Pinehurst for
treatment of injuries, mostly minor cuts, bruises
and burns. Just eight were admitted to the hospi
tal, none with critical injuries.
The weather was "very foggy," said Larry
Moubry, Moore County administrator. "I under
stand the visibility was 100 yards at the time."
Spokesmen for the railroad companies said the
freight train's crew should have been warned that
another train was approaching, but that electron
ically operated signals failed or the engineer did
not see them.

Killer-rapist sentenced to die
OAKLAND — David Moore, convicted of
132 felonies including rape and murder in a
two-month crime spree called "the worst in
Alameda County history," was sentenced yester
day to die in the gas chamber. His younger
brother Kenneth, convicted of the same crimes,
was sentenced to life without possibility of parole.
It was the first death sentence in Alameda
County since Lance Laverne Brown was con
victed of murder in 1973.
The Moores were convicted of 20 armed rob
beries, eight rapes, sodomy, oral copulation,
burglary, false imprisonment, assault and mur
der. Two of the convictions against the brothers
involved special circumstances, which allow im
position of the death penalty or life without
parole.
Kenneth Moore's attorney contended that his
client didn't shoot anyone but watched with a
shotgun while the women were assaulted. David
Moore's attorney said his client was high on drugs
and alcohol and incapable of premeditating the
crimes.
However, both attorneys admitted their clients
were guilty of all of the crimes they were accused
of.
The defendants showed little emotion at the
penalty verdicts, with David winking at his
mother and Kenneth giving a clenched fist salute
as he left the courtroom.
Pacific Telephone to hike rates
SAN FRANCISCO — Pacific Telephone was
granted annual rate increases of $227 million
yesterday, leaving basic rates unaffected but ad
ding a monthly charge for phones and increasing
message unit rates.
The utility had sought $337 million on an
emergency basis.
Basic rates will remain unchanged for both re
sidential and business customers, but there will
now be a monthly charge per instrument of 60
cents unless the customer owns the telephone.
Toll.rates will jump one cent for direct dial day
rates for the first minute up to 30 miles and for
additional minute rates for steps between 17 and
90 miles. Toll rates for coin telephones will go up
five cents for the first three minutes for distances
of 13 to 20 miles. Surcharges for operator
assisted calls increase by five cents per call.
The cost of new residential installation will
jump from $27 to $32. But if the residence has
existing jacks and uses a phone center to get an
instrument, the present $16 charge will remain
the same.
Stocks gain in light trading
NEW YORK — The stock market posted a
moderate advance yesterday, shrugging off the
news of a prime rate increase to a landmark high
of 20 percent.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials
gained 3.33 to 787.80, bringing its rise from late
last Thursday afternoon to about 48 points.
Advances outnumbered declines by about a
2-1 spread on the New York Stock Exchange,
and the exchange's composite index rose .37 to
58.20.
NYSE volume remained relatively light at
35.21 million shares, against 32.23 million Tues
day.

Dozens hurt in Amtrak crash
LAKEVIEW, N.C. — An Amtrak train carry
ing about 300 persons through the foggy North
Carolina countryside rolled past a stop signal and
smashed head-on into a freight train yesterday,
sending dozens of passengers to hospitals for
treatment, officials said.
Rescue officials said 93 persons were taken to
Moore Memorial Hospital at Pinehurst for
treatment of injuries, mostly minor cuts, bruises
and burns. Just eight were admitted to the hospi
tal, none with critical injuries.
The weather was "very foggy," said Larry
Moubry, Moore County administrator. "I under
stand the visibility was 100 yards at the time."
Spokesmen for the railroad companies said the
freight train's crew should have been warned that
another train was approaching, but that electron
ically operated signals failed or the engineer did
not see them.

Killer-rapist sentenced to die
OAKLAND — David Moore, convicted of
132 felonies including rape and murder in a
two-month crime spree called "the worst in
Alameda County history," was sentenced yester
day to die in the gas chamber. His younger
brother Kenneth, convicted of the same crimes,
was sentenced to life without possibility of parole.
It was the first death sentence in Alameda
County since Lance Laverne Brown was con
victed of murder in 1973.
The Moores were convicted of 20 armed rob
beries, eight rapes, sodomy, oral copulation,
burglary, false imprisonment, assault and mur
der. Two of the convictions against the brothers
involved special circumstances, which allow im
position of the death penalty or life without
parole.
Kenneth Moore's attorney contended that his
client didn't shoot anyone but watched with a
shotgun while the women were assaulted. David
Moore's attorney said his client was high on drugs
and alcohol and incapable of premeditating the
crimes.
However, both attorneys admitted their clients
were guilty of all of the crimes they were accused
of.
The defendants showed little emotion at the
penalty verdicts, with David winking at his
mother and Kenneth giving a clenched fist salute
as he left the courtroom.
Pacific Telephone to hike rates
SAN FRANCISCO — Pacific Telephone was
granted annual rate increases of $227 million
yesterday, leaving basic rates unaffected but ad
ding a monthly charge for phones and increasing
message unit rates.
The utility had sought $337 million on an
emergency basis.
Basic rates will remain unchanged for both re
sidential and business customers, but there will
now be a monthly charge per instrument of 60
cents unless the customer owns the telephone.
Toll.rates will jump one cent for direct dial day
rates for the first minute up to 30 miles and for
additional minute rates for steps between 17 and
90 miles. Toll rates for coin telephones will go up
five cents for the first three minutes for distances
of 13 to 20 miles. Surcharges for operator
assisted calls increase by five cents per call.
The cost of new residential installation will
jump from $27 to $32. But if the residence has
existing jacks and uses a phone center to get an
instrument, the present $16 charge will remain
the same.

NEW YORK — The stock market posted a

Fed to raise price of credit
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve
Board yesterday in effect told millions of charge
account customers to either stop using their credit
cards or face higher monthly payments.
The board vqted to override state consumer
credit laws and let lenders raise the payments on
existing charge accounts if they give customers 30
days notice.
Consumers will have the right to pay off their
present balances under the old terms, but only if
they stop using their credit cards. By using the
card again, the consumer will automatically agree
to pay bigger payments and accept any other
changes sought by the lender.
The board actions yesterday altered credit con
trols it adopted less than three weeks ago as part
of a major anti-inflation package that included
President Jimmy Carter's budget surplus plans
for fiscal 1981.
The latest changes in the Federal Reserve's
consumer credit controls were meant to answer a
wide range of criticisms from both borrowers and
lenders, but they were immediately denounced
by consumer groups and their supporters in Con
gress.
Federal Reserve Governor Nancy Teeters,
who shepherdedthechanges through the board,
said the rules were designed to make the Fed's
credit controls uniform and fair.
The board's decision yesterday covers a wide
variety of changes in credit account terms, includ
ing increases in finance charges, imposition of
additional credit fees, a rise in minimum monthly
payments, a lowering of borrowing limits oil cre
dit cards and revisions in the way monthly bills
are calculated.
The changes also won't affect a lender's right to
increase collection activities, close existing ac
counts or stop opening new ones.
At least 17 states have laws that restrict the
power of lenders to change charge account terms
or else require that consumers be given lengthy
advance notice of any modifications.
Teeters told the board that enforcement of its
controls program is going to vary 50 different
ways if the agency did not override the state laws.
Many retailers, however, are not able to raise
interest rates significantly because they already
are bumping against state usury ceilings which are
not affected by the board's decisions.
Under the Fed's consumer credit crackdown,
lenders are to try to hold the amount of credit
they grant to what it was on March 14. when the
program was announced. If lenders permit credit
to increase, they must put 15 percent of the in
crease into non-interest-bearing accounts in a
Federal Reserve bank.
U.K. might arm female soldiers
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government suggested yesterday that
women soldiers may soon be carrying guns.
Weapons may soon be issued to female recruits
for self-defense or for guarding military bases, as
their counterparts receive arms in the United
States and some other countries. America's
150,000 women ill the 2-million-member un
iform services are barred from combat.
"There can be no question" of women engag
ing in combat in the British forces, said the docu
ment, called "Defense in the 1980s." But it said
the measure does involve arming women in

"exercises, emergency or war.
The document, presented at a news conference
by Defense Secretary Francis Pym, indicated a
shortage of men in the all-volunteer army, navy
and air force could lead to the change, which
would require parliamentary approval.
In an increasing number of countries —includ-
ing Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France and the
Netherlands —"women now are being trained in
of firearms for self-defense, or for certain
limited base defense tasks in an emergency," the
document explained.
Prime rate hits 20 percent
WASHINGTON — The prime lending rate at
many of the nation's major banks hit an incredi
ble 20 percent yesterday, with most bankers ex
pecting the rate to continue to rise.
Business borrowing is still strong despite the
unprecedented cost of loans, while the price
banks themselves are paying for the funds still is
climbing, too, analysts said.
Meanwhile, testifying before a Senate Finance
subcommittee on a bill to increase limits on the
public debt, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker said the Federal Reserve is holding
money growth to the desired levels. The Fed has
set no specific targets for 1981 as yet, he added,
but the "operative objective" for next year is to
continue monetary restraint as part of the overall
government effort to combat inflation.
A month ago the prime was percent. Six
months ago it was 13'/2 percent. It had reached
19 3 /4 percent at a few banks only this Tuesday.
"The demand for bank loans continues to be
strong, putting banks under increasing pressure,
so you can figure the prime will be moving up
ward some more before peaking," an analyst at
Merrill Lynch & Co. said.
Volcker told the Senate subcommittee that the
best thing Congress can do to lower interest rates
is "make some progress on the inflation front.
They you can see interest rates come down."
Cutting spending and balancing the budget is the
best way to do that, he said.
NYC regains railroad service
NEW YORK — Talks aimed at ending New
York's bus and subway strike got under way yes
terday and the strike against the Long Island Rail
Road was called off at least temporarily.
Unions fof the Long Island Rail Road, which
carries 200,000 commuters in Manhattan daily,
announced they will have the trains running in
time for this morning's rush hour.
Teamsters local head John Mahoney said the
seven unions were returning to work in good faith
and expect the Metropolitan Transportation Au
thority to resume serious bargaining with them,
after a promise from a federal mediator to get
negotiations reopened.
Mahoney said the strike would be resumed in
"guerrilla warfare" fashion if necessary next
week.
There was immediate speculation that
Mahoney's decision was determined by the pres
sure of the other six railroad unions and of the
possibility of contempt citations and fines under
the state law forbidding strikes by public
employees.
The bus and subway workers' leader, John
Lawe, ruled out a unilateral return to work. He

said his 33,600 Transport Workers Union mem
bers won't go back without a contract. Union and
MTA officials predicted no settlement before the
weekend at the earliest.
Mayor Edward Koch continued to cheer on
New Yorkers and to talk tough to the strikers.
The mayor does not want the 238,000 municipal
workers, with whose union leaders he must
negotiate this spring and summer, to have a large
transit wage settlement as a tempting model.
Sadat consoles angered shah
CAIRO — "Thank God, you're here safe and
sound."
President Anwar Sadat stepped up to the char
tered DC-8 after its all-night flight from Central
America and, with these words, offered the sol
ace of friendship and hospitality in Egypt to the
dispirited and seriously ill former shah of Iran.
For the homeless shah, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, Sadat's effusive welcome marked the
end of an unhappy 100-day stay in Panama that
was finally terminated by the cancer-stricken
monarch in an atmosphere of disgust at the
wrangling around him and disappointment at the
way the Carter administration was treating a
former ally in need of help.
Nine days later, after a critical operation here
to remove the shah's spleen, the chief spokesman
for the fallen "king of kings" ended a discreet
silence to condemn the conduct of Panamanian
doctors as "inhuman" and criticize the White
House for callous attitudes toward a desperately
ill U.S. friend.
In its "pressure game" to persuade the ailing
shah to stay in Panama, the Carter administration
violated the spirit, if not the letter of understand
ings, reached last December at Lackland Air
Force Base hospital in Texas as the monarch was
about to leave U.S. territory for Panama, Armad
said.
Robert Armad, spokesman for the shah, de
clined to say whether any of the shah's advisers or
friends specifically asked the White House to
readmit the shah to the United States for his
splenectomy, as reported in the United States.
But he strongly suggested that the reason the
monarch himself did not demand admission was
that he had been made to understand in advance
that it would be denied, on grounds the operation
could in the White House view be performed
safely in Panama.

NYC regains railroad service
NEW YORK — Talks aimed at ending New
York's bus and subway strike got under way yes
terday and the strike against the Long Island Rail
Road was called off at least temporarily.
Unions fof the Long Island Rail Road, which
carries 200,000 commuters in Manhattan daily,
announced they will have the trains running in
time for this morning's rush hour.
Teamsters local head John Mahoney said the
seven unions were returning to work in good faith
and expect the Metropolitan Transportation Au
thority to resume serious bargaining with them,
after a promise from a federal mediator to get
negotiations reopened.
Mahoney said the strike would be resumed in
"guerrilla warfare" fashion if necessary next
week.
There was immediate speculation that
Mahoney's decision was determined by the pres
sure of the other six railroad unions and of the
possibility of contempt citations and fines under
the state law forbidding strikes by public
employees.
The bus and subway workers' leader, John
Lawe, ruled out a unilateral return to work. He

said his 33,600 Transport Workers Union mem
bers won't go back without a contract. Union and
MTA officials predicted no settlement before the
weekend at the earliest.
Mayor Edward Koch continued to cheer on
New Yorkers and to talk tough to the strikers.
The mayor does not want the 238,000 municipal
workers, with whose union leaders he must
negotiate this spring and summer, to have a large
transit wage settlement as a tempting model.
Sadat consoles angered shah
CAIRO — "Thank God, you're here safe and
sound."
President Anwar Sadat stepped up to the char
tered DC-8 after its all-night flight from Central
America and, with these words, offered the sol
ace of friendship and hospitality in Egypt to the
dispirited and seriously ill former shah of Iran.
For the homeless shah, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, Sadat's effusive welcome marked the
end of an unhappy 100-day stay in Panama that
was finally terminated by the cancer-stricken
monarch in an atmosphere of disgust at the
wrangling around him and disappointment at the
way the Carter administration was treating a
former ally in need of help.
Nine days later, after a critical operation here
to remove the shah's spleen, the chief spokesman
for the fallen "king of kings" ended a discreet
silence to condemn the conduct of Panamanian
doctors as "inhuman" and criticize the White
House for callous attitudes toward a desperately
ill U.S. friend.
In its "pressure game" to persuade the ailing
shah to stay in Panama, the Carter administration
violated the spirit, if not the letter of understand
ings, reached last December at Lackland Air
Force Base hospital in Texas as the monarch was
about to leave U.S. territory for Panama, Armad
said.
Robert Armad, spokesman for the shah, de
clined to say whether any of the shah's advisers or
friends specifically asked the White House to
readmit the shah to the United States for his
splenectomy, as reported in the United States.
But he strongly suggested that the reason the
monarch himself did not demand admission was
that he had been made to understand in advance
that it would be denied, on grounds the operation
could in the White House view be performed
safely in Panama.
Dozens hurt in Amtrak crash
LAKEVIEW, N.C. — An Amtrak train carry
ing about 300 persons through the foggy North
Carolina countryside rolled past a stop signal and
smashed head-on into a freight train yesterday,
sending dozens of passengers to hospitals for
treatment, officials said.
Rescue officials said 93 persons were taken to
Moore Memorial Hospital at Pinehurst for
treatment of injuries, mostly minor cuts, bruises
and burns. Just eight were admitted to the hospi
tal, none with critical injuries.
The weather was "very foggy," said Larry
Moubry, Moore County administrator. "I under
stand the visibility was 100 yards at the time."
Spokesmen for the railroad companies said the
freight train's crew should have been warned that
another train was approaching, but that electron
ically operated signals failed or the engineer did
not see them.

Killer-rapist sentenced to die
OAKLAND — David Moore, convicted of
132 felonies including rape and murder in a
two-month crime spree called "the worst in
Alameda County history," was sentenced yester
day to die in the gas chamber. His younger
brother Kenneth, convicted of the same crimes,
was sentenced to life without possibility of parole.
It was the first death sentence in Alameda
County since Lance Laverne Brown was con
victed of murder in 1973.
The Moores were convicted of 20 armed rob
beries, eight rapes, sodomy, oral copulation,
burglary, false imprisonment, assault and mur
der. Two of the convictions against the brothers
involved special circumstances, which allow im
position of the death penalty or life without
parole.
Kenneth Moore's attorney contended that his
client didn't shoot anyone but watched with a
shotgun while the women were assaulted. David
Moore's attorney said his client was high on drugs
and alcohol and incapable of premeditating the
crimes.
However, both attorneys admitted their clients
were guilty of all of the crimes they were accused
of.
The defendants showed little emotion at the
penalty verdicts, with David winking at his
mother and Kenneth giving a clenched fist salute
as he left the courtroom.
Pacific Telephone to hike rates
SAN FRANCISCO — Pacific Telephone was
granted annual rate increases of $227 million
yesterday, leaving basic rates unaffected but ad

message unit rates.
The utility had sought $337 million on an
emergency basis.
Basic rates will remain unchanged for both re
sidential and business customers, but there will
now be a monthly charge per instrument of 60
cents unless the customer owns the telephone.
Toll.rates will jump one cent for direct dial day
rates for the first minute up to 30 miles and for
additional minute rates for steps between 17 and
90 miles. Toll rates for coin telephones will go up
five cents for the first three minutes for distances
of 13 to 20 miles. Surcharges for operator
assisted calls increase by five cents per call.
The cost of new residential installation will
jump from $27 to $32. But if the residence has
existing jacks and uses a phone center to get an
instrument, the present $16 charge will remain
the same.

Fed to raise price of credit
WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve
Board yesterday in effect told millions of charge
account customers to either stop using their credit
cards or face higher monthly payments.
The board vqted to override state consumer
credit laws and let lenders raise the payments on
existing charge accounts if they give customers 30
days notice.
Consumers will have the right to pay off their
present balances under the old terms, but only if
they stop using their credit cards. By using the
card again, the consumer will automatically agree
to pay bigger payments and accept any other
changes sought by the lender.
The board actions yesterday altered credit con
trols it adopted less than three weeks ago as part
of a major anti-inflation package that included
President Jimmy Carter's budget surplus plans
for fiscal 1981.
The latest changes in the Federal Reserve's
consumer credit controls were meant to answer a
wide range of criticisms from both borrowers and
lenders, but they were immediately denounced
by consumer groups and their supporters in Con
gress.
Federal Reserve Governor Nancy Teeters,
who shepherdedthechanges through the board,
said the rules were designed to make the Fed's
credit controls uniform and fair.
The board's decision yesterday covers a wide
variety of changes in credit account terms, includ
ing increases in finance charges, imposition of
additional credit fees, a rise in minimum monthly
payments, a lowering of borrowing limits oil cre
dit cards and revisions in the way monthly bills
are calculated.
The changes also won't affect a lender's right to
increase collection activities, close existing ac
counts or stop opening new ones.
At least 17 states have laws that restrict the
power of lenders to change charge account terms
or else require that consumers be given lengthy
advance notice of any modifications.
Teeters told the board that enforcement of its
controls program is going to vary 50 different
ways if the agency did not override the state laws.
Many retailers, however, are not able to raise
interest rates significantly because they already
are bumping against state usury ceilings which are
not affected by the board's decisions.
Under the Fed's consumer credit crackdown,
lenders are to try to hold the amount of credit
they grant to what it was on March 14. when the
program was announced. If lenders permit credit
to increase, they must put 15 percent of the in
crease into non-interest-bearing accounts in a
Federal Reserve bank.
U.K. might arm female soldiers
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government suggested yesterday that
women soldiers may soon be carrying guns.
Weapons may soon be issued to female recruits
for self-defense or for guarding military bases, as
their counterparts receive arms in the United
States and some other countries. America's
150,000 women ill the 2-million-member un
iform services are barred from combat.
"There can be no question" of women engag
ing in combat in the British forces, said the docu
ment, called "Defense in the 1980s." But it said
the measure does involve arming women in

"exercises, emergency or war.
The document, presented at a news conference
by Defense Secretary Francis Pym, indicated a
shortage of men in the all-volunteer army, navy
and air force could lead to the change, which
would require parliamentary approval.
In an increasing number of countries —includ-
ing Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France and the
Netherlands —"women now are being trained in
of firearms for self-defense, or for certain
limited base defense tasks in an emergency," the
document explained.
Prime rate hits 20 percent
WASHINGTON — The prime lending rate at
many of the nation's major banks hit an incredi
ble 20 percent yesterday, with most bankers ex
pecting the rate to continue to rise.
Business borrowing is still strong despite the
unprecedented cost of loans, while the price
banks themselves are paying for the funds still is
climbing, too, analysts said.
Meanwhile, testifying before a Senate Finance
subcommittee on a bill to increase limits on the
public debt, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker said the Federal Reserve is holding
money growth to the desired levels. The Fed has
set no specific targets for 1981 as yet, he added,
but the "operative objective" for next year is to
continue monetary restraint as part of the overall
government effort to combat inflation.
A month ago the prime was percent. Six
months ago it was 13'/2 percent. It had reached
19 3 /4 percent at a few banks only this Tuesday.
"The demand for bank loans continues to be
strong, putting banks under increasing pressure,

card again, the consumer will automatically agree
to pay bigger payments and accept any other
changes sought by the lender.
The board actions yesterday altered credit con
trols it adopted less than three weeks ago as part
of a major anti-inflation package that included
President Jimmy Carter's budget surplus plans
for fiscal 1981.
The latest changes in the Federal Reserve's
consumer credit controls were meant to answer a
wide range of criticisms from both borrowers and
lenders, but they were immediately denounced
by consumer groups and their supporters in Con
gress.
Federal Reserve Governor Nancy Teeters,
who shepherdedthechanges through the board,
said the rules were designed to make the Fed's
credit controls uniform and fair.
The board's decision yesterday covers a wide
variety of changes in credit account terms, includ
ing increases in finance charges, imposition of
additional credit fees, a rise in minimum monthly
payments, a lowering of borrowing limits oil cre
dit cards and revisions in the way monthly bills
are calculated.
The changes also won't affect a lender's right to
increase collection activities, close existing ac
counts or stop opening new ones.
At least 17 states have laws that restrict the
power of lenders to change charge account terms
or else require that consumers be given lengthy
advance notice of any modifications.
Teeters told the board that enforcement of its
controls program is going to vary 50 different
ways if the agency did not override the state laws.
Many retailers, however, are not able to raise
interest rates significantly because they already
are bumping against state usury ceilings which are
not affected by the board's decisions.
Under the Fed's consumer credit crackdown,
lenders are to try to hold the amount of credit
they grant to what it was on March 14. when the
program was announced. If lenders permit credit
to increase, they must put 15 percent of the in
crease into non-interest-bearing accounts in a
Federal Reserve bank.
U.K. might arm female soldiers
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's government suggested yesterday that
women soldiers may soon be carrying guns.
Weapons may soon be issued to female recruits
for self-defense or for guarding military bases, as
their counterparts receive arms in the United
States and some other countries. America's
150,000 women ill the 2-million-member un
iform services are barred from combat.
"There can be no question" of women engag
ing in combat in the British forces, said the docu
ment, called "Defense in the 1980s." But it said
the measure does involve arming women in

"exercises, emergency or war.
The document, presented at a news conference
by Defense Secretary Francis Pym, indicated a
shortage of men in the all-volunteer army, navy
and air force could lead to the change, which
would require parliamentary approval.
In an increasing number of countries —includ-
ing Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France and the
Netherlands —"women now are being trained in
of firearms for self-defense, or for certain
limited base defense tasks in an emergency," the
document explained.
Prime rate hits 20 percent
WASHINGTON — The prime lending rate at
many of the nation's major banks hit an incredi
ble 20 percent yesterday, with most bankers ex
pecting the rate to continue to rise.
Business borrowing is still strong despite the
unprecedented cost of loans, while the price
banks themselves are paying for the funds still is
climbing, too, analysts said.
Meanwhile, testifying before a Senate Finance
subcommittee on a bill to increase limits on the
public debt, Federal Reserve Chairman Paul
Volcker said the Federal Reserve is holding
money growth to the desired levels. The Fed has
set no specific targets for 1981 as yet, he added,
but the "operative objective" for next year is to
continue monetary restraint as part of the overall
government effort to combat inflation.
A month ago the prime was percent. Six
months ago it was 13'/2 percent. It had reached
19 3 /4 percent at a few banks only this Tuesday.
"The demand for bank loans continues to be
strong, putting banks under increasing pressure,
so you can figure the prime will be moving up
ward some more before peaking," an analyst at
Merrill Lynch & Co. said.
Volcker told the Senate subcommittee that the
best thing Congress can do to lower interest rates
is "make some progress on the inflation front.
They you can see interest rates come down."
Cutting spending and balancing the budget is the
best way to do that, he said.
NYC regains railroad service
NEW YORK — Talks aimed at ending New
York's bus and subway strike got under way yes
terday and the strike against the Long Island Rail
Road was called off at least temporarily.
Unions fof the Long Island Rail Road, which
carries 200,000 commuters in Manhattan daily,
announced they will have the trains running in
time for this morning's rush hour.
Teamsters local head John Mahoney said the
seven unions were returning to work in good faith
and expect the Metropolitan Transportation Au
thority to resume serious bargaining with them,
after a promise from a federal mediator to get
negotiations reopened.
Mahoney said the strike would be resumed in
"guerrilla warfare" fashion if necessary next
week.
There was immediate speculation that
Mahoney's decision was determined by the pres
sure of the other six railroad unions and of the
possibility of contempt citations and fines under
the state law forbidding strikes by public
employees.
The bus and subway workers' leader, John
Lawe, ruled out a unilateral return to work. He

said his 33,600 Transport Workers Union mem
bers won't go back without a contract. Union and
MTA officials predicted no settlement before the
weekend at the earliest.
Mayor Edward Koch continued to cheer on
New Yorkers and to talk tough to the strikers.
The mayor does not want the 238,000 municipal
workers, with whose union leaders he must
negotiate this spring and summer, to have a large
transit wage settlement as a tempting model.
Sadat consoles angered shah
CAIRO — "Thank God, you're here safe and
sound."
President Anwar Sadat stepped up to the char
tered DC-8 after its all-night flight from Central
America and, with these words, offered the sol
ace of friendship and hospitality in Egypt to the
dispirited and seriously ill former shah of Iran.
For the homeless shah, Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi, Sadat's effusive welcome marked the
end of an unhappy 100-day stay in Panama that
was finally terminated by the cancer-stricken
monarch in an atmosphere of disgust at the
wrangling around him and disappointment at the
way the Carter administration was treating a
former ally in need of help.
Nine days later, after a critical operation here
to remove the shah's spleen, the chief spokesman
for the fallen "king of kings" ended a discreet
silence to condemn the conduct of Panamanian
doctors as "inhuman" and criticize the White
House for callous attitudes toward a desperately
ill U.S. friend.
In its "pressure game" to persuade the ailing
shah to stay in Panama, the Carter administration
violated the spirit, if not the letter of understand
ings, reached last December at Lackland Air
Force Base hospital in Texas as the monarch was
about to leave U.S. territory for Panama, Armad
said.
Robert Armad, spokesman for the shah, de
clined to say whether any of the shah's advisers or
friends specifically asked the White House to
readmit the shah to the United States for his
splenectomy, as reported in the United States.
But he strongly suggested that the reason the
monarch himself did not demand admission was
that he had been made to understand in advance
that it would be denied, on grounds the operation
could in the White House view be performed
safely in Panama.
Dozens hurt in Amtrak crash
LAKEVIEW, N.C. — An Amtrak train carry
ing about 300 persons through the foggy North
Carolina countryside rolled past a stop signal and
smashed head-on into a freight train yesterday,
sending dozens of passengers to hospitals for
treatment, officials said.
Rescue officials said 93 persons were taken to
Moore Memorial Hospital at Pinehurst for
treatment of injuries, mostly minor cuts, bruises
and burns. Just eight were admitted to the hospi
tal, none with critical injuries.
The weather was "very foggy," said Larry
Moubry, Moore County administrator. "I under
stand the visibility was 100 yards at the time."
Spokesmen for the railroad companies said the
freight train's crew should have been warned that
another train was approaching, but that electron
ically operated signals failed or the engineer did
not see them.

Killer-rapist sentenced to die
OAKLAND — David Moore, convicted of
132 felonies including rape and murder in a
two-month crime spree called "the worst in
Alameda County history," was sentenced yester
day to die in the gas chamber. His younger
brother Kenneth, convicted of the same crimes,
was sentenced to life without possibility of parole.
It was the first death sentence in Alameda
County since Lance Laverne Brown was con
victed of murder in 1973.
The Moores were convicted of 20 armed rob
beries, eight rapes, sodomy, oral copulation,
burglary, false imprisonment, assault and mur
der. Two of the convictions against the brothers
involved special circumstances, which allow im
position of the death penalty or life without
parole.
Kenneth Moore's attorney contended that his
client didn't shoot anyone but watched with a
shotgun while the women were assaulted. David
Moore's attorney said his client was high on drugs
and alcohol and incapable of premeditating the
crimes.
However, both attorneys admitted their clients
were guilty of all of the crimes they were accused
of.
The defendants showed little emotion at the
penalty verdicts, with David winking at his
mother and Kenneth giving a clenched fist salute
as he left the courtroom.
Pacific Telephone to hike rates
SAN FRANCISCO — Pacific Telephone was
granted annual rate increases of $227 million
yesterday, leaving basic rates unaffected but ad
ding a monthly charge for phones and increasing
message unit rates.
The utility had sought $337 million on an
emergency basis.
Basic rates will remain unchanged for both re
sidential and business customers, but there will
now be a monthly charge per instrument of 60
cents unless the customer owns the telephone.
Toll.rates will jump one cent for direct dial day
rates for the first minute up to 30 miles and for
additional minute rates for steps between 17 and
90 miles. Toll rates for coin telephones will go up
five cents for the first three minutes for distances
of 13 to 20 miles. Surcharges for operator
assisted calls increase by five cents per call.
The cost of new residential installation will
jump from $27 to $32. But if the residence has
existing jacks and uses a phone center to get an
instrument, the present $16 charge will remain
the same.
