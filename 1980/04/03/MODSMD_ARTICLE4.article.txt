# U.S. to hold back in Iran negotiations
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
WASHINGTON — White House
officials promised yesterday to be "re
strained" in efforts to free the 50
American hostages in Iran as long as
there appears to be progress in negotia
tions.
"We intend to continue to be re
strained in our words and actions so
long as progress is made to resolve this
crisis and bring our people home," said
White House press secretary Jody
Powell.
Meeting with reporters, Powell was
repeatedly questioned about whether
President Jimmy Carter has set a dead
line for progress in the crisis before
imposing new economic sanctions as he
has threatened.
"If I wanted to come out and set a
deadline, I would do it," Powell re
plied. "I would urge you all not to set a
deadline for us.
"Let's stay cool, for a while at least,"
he said. "Let's see how this thing
moves. Obviously they (the Iranians)
will do what they said they'll do or
they'll not and then we'll have to reach
a conclusion."
Bani-Sadr-undecided
But informed sources reported Ira
nian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
still was undecided on whether to go
ahead with the transfer of the hostages
from control of militants at the U.S.
Embassy to control of the government.
Speaking to newsmen after his re
turn from a brief visit to northern Iran,
the Iranian president last night said,
"We asked for (President) Carter to
say he would not say anything and he
has sent a note saying he accepts that."
At face value, Bani-Sadr appeared
to be backing away from his unam
biguous demand Tuesday that the Un
ited States make a formal public decla
ration eschewing economic and politi
cal sanctions or even criticism in return
for carrying out the transfer.
The new American message simply
noted the Iranian government has said
the new parliament will decide the hos
tages' eventual fate, according to in
formed sources. That, too, was part of
Bani-Sadr's condition for transferring
the hostages to the authority of the
13-man ruling Revolutionary Council.
Message falls short
Rather than proclaiming the right to
keep demanding the hostages release,
the message is reported to recall that
the United States government's goal is
to obtain their freedom as soon as pos
sible. That formulation apparently fell
short of Bani-Sadr's more stringent
earlier demands to stop all propaganda
efforts on the hostages' behalf.
The new message apparently drop
ped any hint of applying tough
economic sanctions against Iran. There
was confusion on this point, however,
since some sources suggested that Eas

ter Sunday constituted a new deadline
for the transfer if such punitive mea
sures were to be avoided.
Bani-Sadr was depicted as pro
foundly uneasy about the transfer,
especially in light of Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini's own pronounced pen
chant for allowing the new parliament
to decide the hostage problem.
Clergy widely supported
In the first round of the elections, a
clergy-dominated party that takes a
hard line toward release of the 50
American hostages captured nearly
three times as many seats as supporters
of the Iranian president.
The Islamic Republican Party won
49 of 101 seats, the president's suppor
ters 18, independents 21 and several
minor parties a total of 13. The other
169 seats will be filled in a second
round of voting expected in about a
month.
Observers doubted the new parlia
ment could get down to serious busi
ness before the end of May or early
June at the earliest.
Council meets tonight
No new decision was expected be
fore tonight, when the Revolutionary
Council was scheduled to meet after a
two-day, mid-week holiday.
Indicative of the fallback reasoning
making the official rounds here were
reports that the government was con
sidering having leading Moslem clerics
visit the embassy to report on the hos
tages' conditions of detention. The last
such visit, by Ayatollah Ezzattollah
Sahabi, in early March confirmed ear
lier rumors of considerable mental st
rain, but no serious physical illnesses
among the hostages.
Three options
Informed speculation is focusing on
three options which in varying degrees
allow the militants to retain some con
trol over the hostages:
— The hostages would be permitted
to leave the embassy and come under
control of Revolutionary Guards, but
the.militants would retain control over
the embassy.
— The militants would stay in the
and the hostages would leave,
,Jbut the militants would be represented
in the group of Revolutionary Guards
chosen to control the hostages in their
new captivity.
— The militants would retain physi
cal control over the hostages, but yield
themselves to the authority of the gov
ernment, being declared representa
tives of the government and responsi
ble to it.
The first of these options is likely to
be acceptable to Washington as legiti
mate progress, but there are serious
questions about the acceptability of the
second option. The third option ap
pears totally unacceptable.
