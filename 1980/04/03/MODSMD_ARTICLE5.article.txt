# Commoner proposes 'social governance' of energy production
## 
### John Mason Staff Writer 
Speaking Tuesday night in a packed Din
kelspiel Auditorium, scientist and author Dr.
Barry Commoner attacked the influence of major
corporations on energy policy in America and
prescribed solar energy as a solution to the coun
try's energy woes.
"We have got to break the grip of corporate
decisions on the life of the country," Commoner
said in a speech entitled "The Politics of Energy."
Commoner, presidential candidate and co
founder of the Citizens Party, described himself
as a radical: he attacks a problem at its roots.
The root of America's problems. Commoner
explained, lies in the corporate free-enterprise
system which is responsive only to profits and not
to the needs of the people. To remedy this situa
tion, Commoner suggested that the major indus
tries and utilities come under "social control" and
that the principle of profit maximization be left to

industries of lesser importance.
Specifically, Commoner directed his argument
at the "inverted" and "backward" popular un
derstanding of the energy crisis. "The reason why
the price of oil has risen lies not in Saudi Arabia,
but in Texas," he declared.
Commoner, a biology professor at Washington
University in St. Louis, Mo., explained that be
cause oil is a non-renewable resource, the cost of
producing each additional barrel rises exponen
tially as more and more oil is removed from un
derground reserves. This, he argued, stems from
the depiction of readily available sources, neces
sitating more difficult — and more costly — dril
ling processes.
Commoner claimed, however, that the price of
American oil did not rise exponentially during
the period between World War II and the early
1970s because of a quota system imposed by
oilmen in the Texas state legislature.
Not only did this quota system prevent expo

nential increases in the price of oil. Commoner
claimed, but it prevented any price increase at all.
And this led to a situation in which the rising costs
of production began to erode profits from domes
tic oil production.
Consequently the National Petroleum Council
published, in 1971, a report forecasting exponen
tial increases in the price of American oil. This
forecast alerted the Arabs and set the upward
spiral of OPEC oil prices into motion. "I am
convinced that this is the reason why the price of
OPEC oil went up," Commoner said about the
report. "The Arab-Israeli War was used as an
excuse."
Turning next to the Carter Administration's
energy proposals, Commoner said that the most
harmful effect of the energy crisis is the burden it
places on the poor. Citing two figures from a 1973
study, he stated that the poorest fifth of all U.S.
families deVoted 25 percent of their budgets to
meeting energy needs while the richest fifth spent

only 6 percent on energy.
Thus, he reasoned, the deregulation of fuel
prices and the imposition of gasoline taxes would
only compound problems for those people who
are currently suffering the most. "The disease,"
he asserted, "is the escalating price of oil which is
eroding our standard of living, and we are told
that the cure is the disease."
Alternatively, Commoner suggested a remedy
of his own. "Solar power is the only renewable
resource we can use now," he said. "The technol
ogy is there . . . only politics stands in the way."
The capacity audience of more than 750
greeted several of Commoner's points with
applause. A significant contingent of Libertarian
party sympathizers, however, expressed strong
opposition to the speech's most ambitious social
reforms. Commoner's suggestion to nationalize
major industries and utilities met with calls of
"totalitarianism."

major industries and utilities met with calls of
"totalitarianism."
