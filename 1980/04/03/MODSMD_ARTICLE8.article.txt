# Study concludes energy of future is coal
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Coal will be the most important
energy source in the United States
by the year 2025. People will cluster
in higher density housing, reversing
the current trend toward suburban
sprawl. The country's dependence
on foreign fuel will have dropped
substantially while solar technology
shines brighter than ever.
These are the conclusions of a re
cently published study completed
by more than 100 students and fa
culty members here.
Other predictions of the study are
that nuclear power will fade as an
energy source, and that microp
rocessors will play a key role in
energy conservation.
"There is no way that oil and gas
are going to be available to meet the
demands we face," said Grant Ire

son, professor of industrial en
gineering and director of the re
search and writing of the report,
"Alternative Energy Futures: An
Assessment of U.S. Options to
2025."
Two-year project
The study, published last Oc
tober, was more than two years in
the making and consumed more
than 20,000 hours of work by all of
the participants.
Funded by a $176,000 grant from
the Department of Energy and by
$25,000 from the University's Insti
tute for Energy Studies, the study
couples human value systems —
those that place a high value on op
tions with low adverse environmen
tal outcomes — with
economically-oriented systems —
those that stress the importance of
economic benefits from energy

sources.
The report then examines three
scenarios for 1990 and 2025.
Smiths v. Greens
In the first, the so-called
"Smiths" of the nation prevail. The
report depicts the Smiths as those
favoring human control over na
ture, unbounded material progress,
and emphasis on centralized organi
zations, according to Ireson.
The second scenario shows the
Smiths representing 75 percent of
the population in 1990, but only 50
percent in 2025, when the so-called
"Greens" begin to take over.
The Greens represent compatible
cooperation between humans and
nature, curbs on material progress
and a strong belief in decentralized
organizations and participatory
decision-making.
In the third scenario, the Greens

make up half the population in 1990
and 90 percent in 45 years.
Ireson said he thinks the second
outcome is the most realistic and
will represent the outlook of the na
tion's people in future years.
Even though the Smiths and
Greens suggest different options for
future energy use, Ireson said he be
lieves both will support coal use in
the future. And he says technology
can overcome most of the worries
people have about coal.
Coal for 400 years
Most important, says Ireson, is
that the country has enough coal to
supply all of our energy needs for
400 years.
The report also stresses the im
portance of energy conservation
and efficiency, to be realized by re
ducing automobile size and by using
electronic devices to regulate light
ing and ventilation systems.
Ireson also says 1977 levels of gas
and oil imports can be reduced by
32 percent by 1990 with a 6 percent
increase in domestic oil and gas
production and a 40 percent in
crease in coal production.

The study, which was carried out
in conjunction with the Argonne
National Laboratory in Illinois, was
to be one of six energy studies com
missioned by the Department of
Energy, but the department with
drew funding for the national pro
ject so the Stanford study was the
only one completed on a national
scale.
The students involved in the pro
ject were drawn from an applicant
pool of seniors and graduate stu
dents between 1977 and 1978.
Though the study was completed in
1978, more than a year was spent
editing it for final publication in Oc
tober 1979.
Copies of the report can be ob
tained from the Institute for Energy
Studies here.
