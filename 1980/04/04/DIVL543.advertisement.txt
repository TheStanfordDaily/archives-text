If the label says "MAXELL", it says it all. All you need
to know about quality, dependability and performance.
And if it's a UD-XLI, UD-XLII or an MX Metaxial label, it
also gives you the correct BIAS and EQ settings.
Maxell cassettes transport the tape from one hub to
the other with consistent smoothness and silence.
Without jamming or breaking. They accurately reproduce
all of the available tonal and dynamic output of all kinds of
music. Every time. And we give you our word on it - a Full
Lifetime Warranty on the back of every Maxell audio
