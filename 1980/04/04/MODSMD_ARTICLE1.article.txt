# Rising hopes for hostage transfer in Iran once again dashed
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Rising hopes that the government of President Abolhas
san Bani-Sadr would take custody this weekend of the
American hostages from the militants holding the U.S.
Embassy here were dashed yesterday. It appeared likely
there may be no change in the captives' status in the near
future.
During a bitter four-hour meeting yesterday evening, the
ruling Revolutionary Council put off a decision to take con
trol of the hostages.
Instead, the council decided by split vote to seek "more
clarification" of an apparently conciliatory message from
President Carter delivered Wednesday night. The council's
delaying action was announced by Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh, who is known to favor a prompt resolution of
the U.S.-Iranian crisis.
High hopes
Earlier yesterday, Bani-Sadr had said the Carter message
met the conditions he had laid down two days before that
the United States renounce "any propaganda, any claims,
any speeches or any provocations" concerning the hostages
until after the new Iranian Parliament is convened and

makes a decision about them, probably in mid-June. Hopes
of a swift change in the status of the hostages soared during
the day.
Bani-Sadr, Ghotbzadeh and several other members of
the council appeared certain before the meeting that the
13-member ruling group would vote unanimously to accept
the Carter pledge, the text of which has not been released.
Spokesmen for the militants told reporters they would
abide by the verdict of the council and give up the hostages
if such a decision was reached. And the afternoon news
paper, Khayan, said in a headline that the transfer would
take place tomorrow.
But the council meeting ended with no substantive deci
sion. An inside source said that even in the decision to ask
Carter for clarification was only a stalling tactic engineered
by right-wing religious members of the council.
Stalling
The source said the council already has all the clarifica
tion of the American position that it needs. The Carter
message pledged to avoid official ultimatums, sanctions and
statements about the hostages until the Majlis (parliament),
still being elected, is in operatioi in about two months, the

source said.
"We've never had such a success," he said, referring to
the Carter pledge, but added that at least two members of
the council refused to accept it. Three other important
council members — Ayatollah Mohamed Beheshti, its sec
retary, Ayatollah Moussavi Aradalibi and Hojjatoslem
Javad Bahonar — did not even attend the meeting and
sources suggested that their absence was deliberately de
signed to torpedo any chance of a unanimous decision in
favor of the takeover.
Unanimity necessary
According to the source, eight of the members present
including Bani-Sadr and Ghotbzadeh voted for the transfer
and two against. Even if the three absent members had
attended and voted with the president, the move would
have failed for lack of unanimity, considered essential on
such a major question.
The source said the religious rightists who voted against
the majority last night apparently looked upon the con
ciliatory Carter message as a kind of ransom payment re
sulting from keeping the hostages in the hands of the milit
ants. "They think that if they got that much they can get

more," he said. "I don't think their appetite will ever be
satisfied."
Meanwhile, the White House, facing the collapse of its
hopes for transfer of the American hostages in Tehran to
Iranian government control, warned obliquely yesterday
that Carter might go ahead with his threat to increase
economic and political sanctions against Iran.
"Let me say that the American position has been clearly
stated. We hope that the authorities in Iran will carefully
consider that position and the full implications of that posi
tion before making a final decision."
Asked what he meant by "the full implications" of the
U.S. position, Powell refused to elaborate, but called atten
tion to Carter's statements Wednesday after Bani-Sadr
anounced that his government would take custody of the
hostages from their militant captors.
At the time, Carter called Bani-Sadr's move "a positive
step" and saidhe would defer imposing additional sanctions
against Iran. But Carter also said he would "monitor the
situation very closely" and added that the sanctions option
could be picked up again if the Iranians did not move ahead.

Meanwhile, the White House, facing the collapse of its
hopes for transfer of the American hostages in Tehran to
Iranian government control, warned obliquely yesterday
that Carter might go ahead with his threat to increase
economic and political sanctions against Iran.
"Let me say that the American position has been clearly
stated. We hope that the authorities in Iran will carefully
consider that position and the full implications of that posi
tion before making a final decision."
Asked what he meant by "the full implications" of the
U.S. position, Powell refused to elaborate, but called atten
tion to Carter's statements Wednesday after Bani-Sadr
anounced that his government would take custody of the
hostages from their militant captors.
At the time, Carter called Bani-Sadr's move "a positive
step" and saidhe would defer imposing additional sanctions
against Iran. But Carter also said he would "monitor the
situation very closely" and added that the sanctions option
could be picked up again if the Iranians did not move ahead.
From the Daily wire services
Rising hopes that the government of President Abolhas
san Bani-Sadr would take custody this weekend of the
American hostages from the militants holding the U.S.
Embassy here were dashed yesterday. It appeared likely
there may be no change in the captives' status in the near
future.
During a bitter four-hour meeting yesterday evening, the
ruling Revolutionary Council put off a decision to take con
trol of the hostages.
Instead, the council decided by split vote to seek "more
clarification" of an apparently conciliatory message from
President Carter delivered Wednesday night. The council's
delaying action was announced by Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh, who is known to favor a prompt resolution of
the U.S.-Iranian crisis.
High hopes
Earlier yesterday, Bani-Sadr had said the Carter message
met the conditions he had laid down two days before that
the United States renounce "any propaganda, any claims,
any speeches or any provocations" concerning the hostages
until after the new Iranian Parliament is convened and

makes a decision about them, probably in mid-June. Hopes
of a swift change in the status of the hostages soared during
the day.
Bani-Sadr, Ghotbzadeh and several other members of
the council appeared certain before the meeting that the
13-member ruling group would vote unanimously to accept
the Carter pledge, the text of which has not been released.
Spokesmen for the militants told reporters they would
abide by the verdict of the council and give up the hostages
if such a decision was reached. And the afternoon news
paper, Khayan, said in a headline that the transfer would
take place tomorrow.
But the council meeting ended with no substantive deci
sion. An inside source said that even in the decision to ask
Carter for clarification was only a stalling tactic engineered
by right-wing religious members of the council.
Stalling
The source said the council already has all the clarifica
tion of the American position that it needs. The Carter
message pledged to avoid official ultimatums, sanctions and
statements about the hostages until the Majlis (parliament),
still being elected, is in operatioi in about two months, the

source said.
"We've never had such a success," he said, referring to
the Carter pledge, but added that at least two members of
the council refused to accept it. Three other important
council members — Ayatollah Mohamed Beheshti, its sec
retary, Ayatollah Moussavi Aradalibi and Hojjatoslem
Javad Bahonar — did not even attend the meeting and
sources suggested that their absence was deliberately de
signed to torpedo any chance of a unanimous decision in
favor of the takeover.
Unanimity necessary
According to the source, eight of the members present
including Bani-Sadr and Ghotbzadeh voted for the transfer
and two against. Even if the three absent members had
attended and voted with the president, the move would
have failed for lack of unanimity, considered essential on
such a major question.
The source said the religious rightists who voted against
the majority last night apparently looked upon the con
ciliatory Carter message as a kind of ransom payment re
sulting from keeping the hostages in the hands of the milit
ants. "They think that if they got that much they can get

more," he said. "I don't think their appetite will ever be
satisfied."
Meanwhile, the White House, facing the collapse of its
hopes for transfer of the American hostages in Tehran to
Iranian government control, warned obliquely yesterday
that Carter might go ahead with his threat to increase
economic and political sanctions against Iran.
"Let me say that the American position has been clearly
stated. We hope that the authorities in Iran will carefully
consider that position and the full implications of that posi
tion before making a final decision."
Asked what he meant by "the full implications" of the
U.S. position, Powell refused to elaborate, but called atten
