# Iran, Iraq wage verbal war
## 
### Doyle McManus The Los Angeles Times 
TEHRAN. Iran — Iran and its western
neighbor. Iraq, are at each other's throats again,
waging a war of words that has escalated to include
reports of Iraqi sabotage, an Iranian death squad
and a near-assassination.
Iran's official Pars news agency reported Wed
nesday that a hard-line Iranian Moslem group, the
Islamic Fedaveen of Sacrificers. had assassinated
Iraq's powerful deputy prime minister. Tarik Aziz.
The agency published a claim by the group that
one of its members entered Iraq, threw a hand
grenade at Aziz while he was making a speech
Tuesday and escaped.
Iraq's version, released the previous day, was
rather different. Baghdad's official Iraqi news
agency said a man threw a grenade but only
wounded Aziz slightly. It said the assassin died in a
hail of bullets and identified him as an Iranian
named Samir Nour Ali.
The Islamic Fedaveen are followers of the
Ayatollah Sadegh Khalkhali. chief judge of Iran's
revolutionary courts, who has bragged of person
ally sentencing more than 200 officials of the de
posed shah's regime to the firing squad.
Last summer. Khalkhali founded his Fedayeen
and announced the formation of a death squad to
kill Mohammed Reza Pahlavi and his relatives.
The guerrilla group's Wednesday communique,
which the news agency said it received via an
anonymous telephone call, said Aziz, a member of
Iraq's ruling Revolutionary Command Council,
was killed because he heads the nation's secret
police.
The incident was certain to deepen the hostility
between Iran and its Arab neighbor. Iran's aggres
sive and almost xenophobic foreign policy has
earned it not only a confrontation with the United
States but also the suspicion of every country in its
immediate area — none less than Iraq.
The two nations have appeared on the point of
war several times.
In December. Iran accused Iraq — briefly — of
invading its border areas. The Iranian national
radio network broadcast a war report apparently

based on a rumor, but it was quickly retracted by
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh.
Tehran's Islamic regime has continued to accuse
Baghdad's secular Arab socialists of hit-and-run
attacks against its border posts and of planting
bombs under oil pipelines in southwest Iran.
In fact, Iraq is believed to be one of the principal
suppliers of weaponry both to Arab separatists in
Iran's oil-producing province of Khuzistan and to
Kurdish militants in the mountains along the fron
tier.
In return, Iran has sponsored a small, pro-
Tehran movement among the Shiite Moslems in
Iraq, but with much less efficiency and fewer re
sults than Baghdad's efforts.
A majority of Iraq's population, perhaps 55 per
cent, belongs to the Shiite sect, the branch of Islam
to which the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the
great majority of Iranians belong. But the Baghdad
government of President Saddam Hussein is not
only anti-clerical, it is also dominated by members
of the Sunni Moslem sect. The wounded Aziz,
though, is a member of Iraq's Christian minority.
The Shiites of Iraq, who are concentrated in the
southern part of the country, have long tried to
organize themselves to gain greater influence, but
with little success. The triumph of Khomeini's re
volution next door appears to have encouraged
them, for increasing numbers of anti-regime de
monstrations have been reported in the south,
mostly on Shiite religious holidays.
In response, Hussein's government has jailed
several Shiite clergymen — enraging many of the
clerics around Khomeini, who have close ties to
their Iraqi cousins. Khomeini himself spent more
than a decade in exile at the Iraqi Shiite shrine of
Majaf until 1 978. The Baghdad government expel
led him then at the shah's request — forcing him to
move to France, unwittingly boosting his leader
ship of the Iranian resistance and giving him
another good reason for disliking Iraq.
Ever since Khomeini took over Iran in February
1979, his regime has mounted vociferous verbal
attacks against Hussein. The Iranians have accused
him of being a tool of the United States, a charge
that should surprise both the State Department
and the aggressively anti-American Iraquis.
