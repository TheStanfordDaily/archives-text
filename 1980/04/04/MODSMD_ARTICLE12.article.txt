# W. Germany to sell nukes to Argentina

BONN, West Germany —
West Germany has decided to
allow the sale of a heavy-water
nuclear reactor to Argentina,
over objections by the United
States that Argentina's nuclear
program lacks sufficient interna
tional safeguards to ensure
against the development of nuc
lear weapons.
Bonn's final decision this week
to grant an export license for the
react r was taken following con
clusion of several months of
negotiations with Buenos Aires
in which the West Germans were
able to gain some safeguard
guarantees. A formal exchange
of notes between the two coun
tries is expected shortly, accord
ing to a German Foreign Minis
try spokesman.
Under the terms of the agree
ment, Argentina assured Bonn
that it will use nuclear energy
only for peaceful purposes. It
promised to place under interna
tional controls not only the new
plant but any future nuclear
facilities it might build by copy
ing the German model. And it
provided fresh assurances that
all current nuclear material in
Argentina corresponds to inter
national controls.
In addition, Argentina "indi
cated" in a separate agreement
with Bonn that it would ratify the
Treaty of Tlatelolco banning
nuclear weapons in Latin
America. This action is expected
pending the completion of cur
rent talks between Argentina
and the Vienna-based Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency.
Argentina had refused until
now to sign the Tlatelolco treaty.
It still refuses to sign the 1968
nuclear nonproliferation treaty
on the spread of nuclear
weapons, saying the interna
tional treaty is discriminatory be
cause it denies developing coun
tries access to nuclear technol
ogy while the nuclear powers
continue the arms race.
While significant, the new as
surances Buenos Aires has given
Bonn fall short of the more en
compassing nuclear controls
urged on Argentina by the Un
ited States — controls designed
to cover any and all nuclear op
erations Argentina might build
itself.
"The new arrangement does
not prevent Argentina from de
veloping an independent nuclear

fuel cycle to make a bomb," said
one American expert.
The German sale was also
criticized by Brigitte Erler, a
member of the German parlia
ment and of the ruling Social
Democratic Party, who said the
deal will contribute to the ability
of Argentina's military regime to
produce a nuclear bomb.
Argentina already has the
most advanced nuclear power
program in Latin America. At
the same time, Argentine offi
cials regularly declare that the
program is dedicated solely to
peaceful uses.
The new deal involves con
struction in Argentina by West
Germany's Kraftwerk Union, a
Siemens subsidiary, of a 740-
megawatt heavy water nuclear
reactor. In conjunction, the
Swiss firm Sulzer Brothers Ltd.
has contracted to build a large
heavy water production plant.
Together, these projects were
bid at a price of $1.6 billion.
Argentina has had a 320-
megawatt heavy water reactor in
operation since 1974 (also built
by a West German firm) and is
building a 600-megawatt reactor
with a Canadian company. These
reactors are especially attractive
to Argentina because they run
on unenriched uranium, of which
Argentina has plenty, in contrast
with enriched uranium, which
would need to be imported.
This plays nicely into Argenti
na's announced aim of nuclear
independence. Argentine offi
cials plan to have six such reac
tors operating by the year 2000.
Actually, the production plant
being built by the Swiss will be a
more significant addition to
Argentina's nuclear program
than the West German reactor.
Much of the political heat was
taken off West Germany by
Switzerland's announced deter
mination earlier to proceed with
its part of the project without a
blanket safeguards agreement
from Argentina.
There was considerable
domestic economic pressure on
the Bonn government, coming
from West Germany'sstagnating
nuclear industry, to approve the
project.
U.S. officials see the
German-Argentine deal as a
setback for their efforts to win a
tougher set of nuclear-supplier
guidelines. Said one American
official, "This deal is a pothole
on the road to full-scope
safeguards.
