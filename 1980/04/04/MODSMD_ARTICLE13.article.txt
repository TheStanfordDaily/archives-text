# Britain considers chemical weapon development

### Leonard Downie The Washington Post 
LONDON â€” Britain and other
NATO allies are considering whether
they should develop chemical-warfare
weapons to deter or retaliate against
their possible use by Warsaw Pact coun
tries in a future European war.
British Defense Secretary Francis
Pym, who this week detailed the defense
plans of Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's Conservative government,
emphasized that he had so far approved
only a study of reversing British policy
and resurrecting chemical warfare re
search and development.
Because the Soviet Union and the
Warsaw Pact nations in Eastern Europe
are continuing to develop and stockpile
such weapons, Pym said it was necessary
for Britain and NATO to consider de
veloping a deterrent capability. "I think
we ought to ask the question," he said.

"No conclusions or decisions have been
reached."
Other sources said Britain also is con
sulting with the United States and other
North Atlantic Treaty Organization al
lies. These same countries have been
trying unsuccessfully to negotiate with
the Soviet Union a verifiable ban on
chemical warfare through expansion
and strengthening of the 1925 Geneva
protocol.
A lengthy white paper Pym presented
on Britain'sdefenseplansstated that the
Soviet Union, unlike NATO, has "a
major capability for offensive chemical
warfare" and its military forces are
"fully equipped to operate in a chemical
environment."
The white paper also revealed that
Britain is developing a modest mobile
strike force to assist in emergency allied
intervention in trouble spots beyond

NATO territory, including the Persian
Gulf and Indian Ocean. Planning for
this began after the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan at the end of last year.
Options being considered include
reorganizing the British home defense
force so that men and equipment could
be quickly mobilized for action any
where in the world, providing more
transport aircraft and naval support
ships, and stockpiling some equipment
in or near the Persian Gulf area.
Because of Britain's heavy military
commitments in West Germany, where
it is assuming the full expense of main
taining NATO's British Army of the
Rhine, and in Northern Ireland, a
British mobile strike force would neces
sarily be small and capable largely of
supporting a similar American strategic
force or cooperating with other Allies.

Foreign Secretary Lord Carrington has
indicated Britain's willingness to help
defend and protect Western interests
and the independence of nonaligned na
tions in the region around Afghanistan.
The white paper, which did not men
tion the previously often-used word
"detente," concentrated on the need for
Britain and NATO to counter a growing
potential Soviet threat to Western
Europe and other parts of the world. It
stated that the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan shows that "our opponents
have both the power to make new ter
ritorial and strategic gains and the nerve
to use that power."
Mrs. Thatcher's government will in
crease British defense spending next
year by 3.5 percent, slightly more than
the NATO nations have agreed to do,
and will concentrate on improving Bri-

tain's air defenses and its independent
submarine-launched nuclear deterrent.
The government has not yet decided
what to do when Britain's present four
Polaris submarines need to be replaced
sometime during the 19905, but the De
fense Ministry is still known to favor
purchasing five U.S.-built Trident sub
marines and missile systems, to be
armed with British-made nuclear
warheads.
Pym said the government also was
considering giving guns to women in the
British military for the first time. Their
role has been growing, partly because
they are now easier to recruit than men.
"The arming of women seems to be the
kind of change we need," Pym said.
"Some women would feel they would be
fulfilling a more important role if they
carried weapons."
