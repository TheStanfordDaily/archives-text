# ABM's and Great Lake subs proposed
## 
### Norman Kempster The Los Angeles Times 
With the SALT II treaty stal
led in the Senate and opposition
growing daily to the mobile MX
missile, many are proposing al
ternative ways to strengthen
America's nuclear deterrent
force. Among the ideas are re
vamping the once-scorned anti
ballistic missile system and build
ing a fleet of Trident submarines
for the Great Lakes.
In the grim arithmetic of the
arms race, Department of De
fense strategists say that an effec
tive ballistic missile defense sys
tem would force an attacker to
use so many of his own missiles
to knock out each U.S. rocket
that the assault would not be
worth the cost.
Without a missile defense sys
tem, U.S. planners rely on a
combination of the strategic
arms limitation treaty and the
MX mobile missile to deter a first
strike. SALT would limit the
number of warheads that the
Soviets could deploy, and each
MX would be designed to ride
out all but a barrage attack of
more than 20 enemy warheads.
But SALT ratification is very
much in question, and the gover
nors of Nevada and Utah, where
the MX would be deployed, have
said they do not want the giant
missile in their states.
When last a subject of wide
public discussion, the ABM sys
tem was being torn down and
abandoned in early 1976. Four
months after it became fully op
erational at a Minuteman missile
field inGrand Forks, N.D., it was
dismantled. It was the victim of
an improbable coalition of op
ponents that included budget
cutters concerned about its grow
ing cost, anti-war activists con
cerned about its ultimate impli
cations and military specialists
concerned that it would not
work.
In the four years since the de
mise of the system then known as
Safeguard, the Army's ballistic
missile defense program has
spent a little more than $200
million annually to sharpen the
technology required to knock in
coming missiles out of the sky.
Maj. Gen. Grayson D. Tate,

Jr., program manager, said
Tuesday at a breakfast with re
porters that the program has
scored several technological
breakthroughs since 1976, in
cluding changes that eliminate
many of the vulnerabilities of the
old Safeguard system.
By the late 1980s, Tate said,
the United States could install a
system that would substantially
raise the cost that the Soviets
would have to pay to attack U.S.
missile sites.
"There is still an awful lot of
enthusiasm in the Army and in
the Department of Defense for
this program," Tate said. "We
believe it is possible to build a
system that will work. For the
sake of the country, we have to
pursue a very active ballistic mis
sile defense program.
As presently envisioned, the
ABM would protect only U.S.
nuclear missiles in hardened
shelters. There is no way, Tate
conceded, to protect U.S. cities
from nuclear attack, because a
single enemy warhead could de
stroy a whole city, and there is no
totally airtight missile defense
system.
To understand the renewed in
terest in an ABM system, it is
necessary to follow Pentagon
planners throughout the
a ghastly war game.
According to this line of reason
ing, one of the superpowers
could gain a strategic advantage
through a surprise attack that

would destroy more of the
enemy's weapons than it would
have to use of its own. Con
versely, there could be no advan
tage to the attacker if he had to
commit more of his weapons to
the assault than he could possibly
destroy.
Tate said that a ballistic missile
defense system would be a
"cost-effective" way of deterring
a surprise attack, because it
would substantially increase the
number of weapons that the
Soviets would have to use to
knock out the same number of
U.S. missiles.
After a bitter legislative fight.
Congress approved funds for the
Safeguard system in 1969. It
took until October 1975, to ptit
the first site into operation.
By that time, the United States
and the Soviet Union had signed
the ABM treaty of 1972, which
limits each country to a single
ballistic missile defense system
employing no more than 100
rocket launchers controlled by
no more than 20 radars spread
over an area no more than 100
miles across.
Safeguard fell within the tre
aty limits. But, as Tate now ad
mits, it was not a very effective
system.
A second idea, but one with
apparently no Pentagon support,
was proposed by Cmdr. John
Pursel in an article in the U.S.
Naval Institute Proceedings.
Pursell, an administrative officer

at the Trident training facility in
Bangor, Washington, suggested
a fleet of missile carrying sub
marines he built for the Great
Lakes.
"One alternative (to the MX )
is to expand the Trident sub
marine missile system," Pursel
wrote. "Envision a submarine
base in Escanaba, Mich., sup
porting six Trident submarines
would also operate in Lake
Superior, from a support base at
Marquette, only a few miles from
the main base at Ecanaba," the
article says.
Pursell believes that the
fresh-water sub fleet with five or
six vessels "would equal the total
MX program at about 25 percent
of the cost. It would bring indus
try and employment to the Mid
west, rather than the middle of
the desert."
The savings would come from
the use of existing technology, a
submarine that "would be very
cheap to build and operate" be
cause expensive detection and
evasion equipment and defen
sive weapons would not be
needed for the subsurface ships
operating in the "friendly"
Great Lakes. Subs designed for
Great Lakes duty could also be
constructed with diesel-electric
engines rather than the more
costly nuclear power plants. Pur
sel also predicts a saving in fuel
costs with the sub system com
pared to the cost of "hundreds of
335-ton trucks chauffeuring the
MX."

"The Great Lakes have a grea
ter area than the combined areas
of Nevada and New Mexico, and
nuclear survivability would be
enhanced by the submarine
being able to sit on the bottom or
in shock-sheltered areas during
periods of potential attack,"
Pursel writes.
Military sources say that
another advantage of deploying
a sub fleet in the Great Lakes is
the thick ice that forms in Lake
Superior and in northern Lake
Michigan every winter. This ice,
these sources say, would help to
further conceal the ships from

probing radar. Missiles appa
rently could not be fired through
the ice cover, however.
"The MX missile system is in
trouble â€” which is only logical,"
Pursel says in his article. "Legal
and environmental objections
have been raised, and logic indi
cates there are better alterna
tives to a plan for several
thousand miles of circular tun
nels, filled with hundreds of
33 5-ton trucks, employing

thousands of people in the mid
dle of a dry desert, just to sup
port 200 yet-to-be developed
MX missiles."
Pentagon planners are known
to believe that a land-based sys
tem would he more accurate
than the existing Trident system
and that because Trident sub
marines are already deployed in
the oceans, there would be no
advantage to building a fleet for
the Great Lakes.
