The concept of a teaching newspaper broke
down last month for Baylor University's Lariat
as three student editors were fired for publish
ing an editorial critical of what they felt was
excessively harsh administration policy.
The incident occurred when the three editors
signed an editorial advocating freedom of
choice for Baylor coeds in posing for Playboy
magazine's "Girls of the Southwest Confer
ence" feature. The president of Baylor, a Bap
tist college, had previously prohibited any coeds
from posing and threatened disciplinary action
against any how did.
Unlike the Daily. Baylor's newspaper is a
part of the university's journalism curriculum, a
teaching lab. For this reason, all material to be
published is subject to the approval of a faculty
advisor.
Ironically, it was a pair of sentences deleted
by this advisor as he followed the paper-to press
that morning that led to the editors' firing
As a newspaper owned and operated by a
private institution. The Lariat has no legal pro

tection fiom such censorship. The Baylor ad
ministration acted within the strict letter of the
law. as any publisher may.
Our concern is not with the strict letter of the
law, however, but rather with the obviously
selective type of journalism education the
Baylor journalism department chooses to offer
its students.
We do not wish to criticize Baylor's religious
affiliations or attitudes; but we do worry that in
this case students' educations have been sligh
ted by the very institution that promises its stu
dents the finest education it can provide.
A newspaper is ideally an open forum for
comment, both praise and criticism. According
to Ralph Strother. the Baylor advisor the presi
dent's actions were "like any publisher estab
lishing certain rules to be followed." Rules of
what can and cannot be published such as these,
however, are in our opinion reminiscent of
one-sided journalism of days long past, hardly
attitudes a journalism school should be teach
ing.
