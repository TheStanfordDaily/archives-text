# Farewell Dupie
## 
### 
Gil Morales' Dupie comic strip has been as
much a part of the Daily as the news summary
on the hack page. In the fall of 1978. Dupie first
appeared in the Daily. Since then, it has drawn
increasing readership and is now among the
most popular features in the Daily.
Unfortunately for the Daily and its readers,
but fortunately for Gil, his Dupie strip has at
tracted the attention of people outside the cam
pus. His work has been impressive enough to
bring in frequent requests for reprint rights for
individual strips and most recently. New Eng
land Press Syndicate has given Gil the oppor
tunity to syndicate Dupie to newspapers in the

East.
Because the press syndicate needs an ample
supply of unpublished Dupie strips to show po
tential subscribers, Gil will be spending the rest
of the quarter drawing strips for syndication.
Today's Dupie is the last one we will be publish
ing this quarter. We'll miss Dupie and friends,
and we know you will too. As soon as the strip is
redy for syndication, you can be sure we'll do
our best to bring Dupie back to the pages of the
Daily.
In the meantime, we wish Gil the best of luck
and thank him for more than two years of dedi
cation cartooning and refreshing humor.
