## Forsythe's analysis scary 
### 
1 have enjoyed the Daily's
opinions page since I was a
freshman; I have often disag
reed. occasionally been amused,
more frequently enlightened,
and always been entertained by
the ideas of the members of the
Stanford community. But David
Forsythe's column about Gov.
Jerry Brown |Daily, Mar. 4 ) was
perhaps the first to frighten me.
The specific topic of that arti
cle. namely Gov. Brown's al
leged irresponsibility and Lt.
Gov. Mike Curb's exercise of
power during Brown's frequent
absences, is not what scared me
â€” Forsythe's analysis of the situ
ation did.
After offering the facts of this
case. Forsythe said, "After all.
we did elect Brown governor, so
shouldn't his ideas be carried
out, wherever he is? No. True
power is .and rightly should be, in
the hands of those willing to take
responsibility for it." (Italics
mine.)
My argument with Forsythe,
and my fear of him, stems from
the clause "and rightly should
be" in the sentence above. I do
not argue that power is not
seized and used by those willing
to take the gamble. History is fil
led with men who not only were
in the right place at the right
time, but also were ready to risk
their careers and their lives on a
chance of gaining true power.
But the fact that they attained
control over certain populations

hardly proves that they had a
right to this control.
Forsythe seems to believe that
a man who gains and holds
power has a right to it. Why?
Who gives him the right? Where
and when is this right bestowed
on him?
Forsythe's article reminds me
of some of my elementary school
social studies classes. My
teachers often proved why
America was run by the best sys
tem in the world. They said,
"Would you rather be ruled by a
monarchy, an aristocracy, or a
democracy? A democracy,
right? Therefore, be happy
where you are . .
It was not until recently that I
realized that the key to this sen
tence was not the choice, but the
subtle use of the word "rule." All
I had was a choice of how to be
ruled, not whether or not I
wanted to be or should be ruled.
That I was going to be ruled was
not a question.
Similarly Forsythe asks not
whether power should or should
not be exercised, but only who
will exercise it. This attitude
shows some shallowness of
thought on the part of the au
thor, but it is not dangerous in
itself. However, when it is
coupled with the idea that some
people have an ethical or moral
right to power, the result may
have gruesome consequences.

Adolf Hitler had some strong
beliefs about right and wrong.
He also thought he had the right
to turn his view of the world into
reality , slaughtering millions be
for failing. Pres. Jimmy Carter
has some beliefs too. Among
them is that he has the right to
send certain Americans to fight a
war if he believes a war '"to be
necessary." Again I ask: Neces
sary according to whom? By
what right?
Forsythe holds that it is a
man's willingness to take respon
sibility for the use of power
which gives him the right to that
power. This idea is a perversion
of human beings and human
rights. The only source of right
ful power over an individual is
the individual himself.
Each man has the right to do as
he pleases, and unless he exceeds
this right by interfering with
another individual's equal right,
no man or group of men,
whether or not they are willing to
bear the responsibility, may jus
tifiably violate that right.
