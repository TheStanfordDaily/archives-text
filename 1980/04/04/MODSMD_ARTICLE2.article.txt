From Daily wire services with staff reports
WASHINGTON â€” The Carter ad
ministration graphically described the
scope of "brutal war" being waged by
the Soviet Union against Afghanistan
for sports federation leaders yesterday
and told them it would violate the na
tional interest if any U.S. teams enter
the Olympic Games in Moscow this
summer.
"The United States will take strong
measures to assure that we are not rep
resented there," Deputy Secretary of
State Warren Christopher told repor
ters following a 2-1-2-hour-long meet
ing at the State Department.
Christopher, Secretary of Defense
Harold Brown and other officials
briefed the sports federation leaders on
the "gravity" of the Soviet actions in
Afghanistan and on President Jimmy

Carter's determination that the United
States not field an Olympic team in
Moscow as a means of publicly con
demning the Soviet aggression.
Non-military action
Brown told reporters as he left the
closed meeting with about 50 sports
figures: "We need non-military action
to show the Soviets that their action in
Afghanistan is condemned and
punished by the rest of the world ... to
show that we mean business."
Joining in the administration presen
tation were Lloyd Cutler, White House
counsel, State Department spokesman
Hodding Carter and Marshall Shul
man, a special assistant to Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance on Soviet affairs.
After the session, one of the sports
officials said Cutler was especially
straightfoward in describing the sever

ity of the situation and the need for
support of the president's decision to
boycott the games.
Disservice
Tom Ehman of Newport, R. 1.,
executive director of the U.S. Yacht
Racing Union, paraphrased Cutler as
telling the sports group: "If you vote
against the president (on the boycott),
you are doing a helluva disservice to
the country."
Also yesterday, three representa
tives of the Athletes Advisory Council
of the U.S. Olympic Committee met at
the White House with Cutler's assis
tant, Joe Onek, and Bob Berenson, a
member of the White House domestic
staff, to present their case for a U.S.
Olympic team in Moscow that would
conduct itself as "an instrument of pro
test."
Under the council proposal, U.S.
athletes would not participate in vic
tory ceremonies or the closing cere
mony, they would arrive just in time for
their events and leave immediately af
terward and would not engage in any
tourist activity while in the Soviet Un
ion.
Only flag-bearer
The council also proposed that only
the U.S. flag-bearer participate in the
opening ceremony when the full
Olympic teams customarily march in
parade.
One of the three, Fred Newhouse,
who won a gold medal in the 1600-
meterrelayin 1976, said, "We feel like
a protest in the Soviet Union would

increase the chances of the message
getting out to the Soviet people that we
do not approve of what is going on in
Afghanistan. And it would be a direct
confrontation with the Soviet Union's
use of the games as a propaganda tool."
"Politics and sports don't have any
thing to do with each other," said Stan
ford swimmer and Olympic qualifier
Linda Jezek in response to the ad
ministration's latest assessment. "All I
want to do is go swim," she said adding
that she opposes U.S. athletes' partici
pation in victory ceremonies to de
monstrate opposition to Soviet foreign
policy.
Alternative 'inferior'
Jezek said an alternative Olympic
Games among free world athletes
would be incomparably inferior to the
Moscow Games since such an event
would lack the athletic superpowers,
Russia and East Germany.
Freshman swimmer Kelly Asplund,
another Olympic hopeful, says she
shares Jezek's negative sentiments on
an alternative Olympics this summer,
but nevertheless would support a
boycott of Moscow in light of the Rus
sian invasion of and military presence
in Afghanistan.
However, Asplund said she objects
to athletes being used as political tools.
She said she takes issue with Carter's
policy of using the Olympics as the
primary political weapon against the
Soviets.
"I wonder what action Carter would
