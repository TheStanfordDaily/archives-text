# The 						worst ones walk backwards
## 
### 
Last week Harvey invited me over to drink
some wine and meet his new friend Susan, an
intern. Susan had been working for several
months in a psychiatric ward.
"You wouldn't believe how crazy crazy
people are," said Susan. "I work with
schizophrenics. They're really nuts. The
worst ones walk backwards."
We all laughed.
"Some of them go for months without talk
ing to anyone."
Harvey laughed. "That sounds like you,
Larry."

I laughed defensively. "What else do they
do? I'm curious."
"Sometimes they laugh for no apparent
reason," said Susan. "That means they're
hearing voices. It's a very bad sign."
"I thought you told me you hear voices?"
said Harvey.
"What?" I gasped. "That was only a man
ner of speaking. I meant I have an ear for
dialogue. That's not the same thing."
Harvey was not convinced. Nor was I. I got
up and poured myself another glass of wine
and returned to the sofa, shaking. (That is, I
was shaking, not the sofa.)
"You do seem to laugh a lot for no
reason," said Harvey.
My pulse quickened. I smiled quaintly. "I
just see more of what's funny in life than you,
Harvey. That's all."
Susan went on, excited. "One of the early
signsis their tendency to hide in squalid little
rooms. They seldom have more than a single
friend."
Harvey stared at me suspiciously.
"I can't afford a better place," I explained.
"And I need solitude to write. I live alone by
choice."
"I know," said Harvey. "But it's not your

choice."
"Besides," I countered, "I have another
friend, Kevin."
"It's funny," said Harvey, humorlessly.
"I've known you six months and I've yet to
meet Kevin."
"Kevin's very shy," I said.
"He must be extremely shy," said Harvey.
"You seem to be the only person who knows
him."
Susan took a pen and notebook from her
purse. She opened the notebook and clicked
the pen. I looked at my watch.

"I'd better get going," I said. "I've got
some work to do."
"Nonsense," said Harvey. "Tomorrow is
Saturday. It's good for you to relax like this."
"Who's relaxing?" I asked.
"You were telling us about Kevin," said
Susan.
"I was?"
Susan clicked her pen repeatedly. It was
the only sound in the room. Minutes passed
digitally on my wrist.
"All right," I shouted. "I'll talk. But stop
clicking your pen. It's driving me crazy."
Susan wrote something in her book. I took
a deep breath.
"Kevin's very shy," I said, "especially
around women. For example, last month at a
party a young woman showed up who had
pitied Kevin enough to go out with him last
summer. Kevin didn't even dare say hello.
He spent the whole evening stealing glances
at her from the greatest distance he could
maintain. I tried to shame him into acting like
a human being, but all he did was whimper. It
was pathetic."
"What about you, Larry?" asked Susan.
"Me? I'm fine. But we were talking about

Kevin."
"Were we really?" asked Susan.
I looked to Harvey for help, but Harvey
said nothing. Susan tapped me on the shoul
der to regain my attention. My body con
vulsed and my legs shot out.
"Are you a bit tense?" asked Susan.
"No," I said. "I just have good reflexes."
"I see," said Susan. "You don't have a
problem like Kevin's do you?"
"Who me?"
"No sexual problems?" asked Susan.
"That's a good one," 1 said. "How could I
have a sexual problem? I've never had. I
mean. Oops."
There was a minute of silence. Susan and
Harvey traded meaningful glances. I think
Harvey came out better in the deal. Susan
then spoke somberly. "You can tell us the
truth, Larry. You don't have a friend named
Kevin, do you? He's really you. You're the
one with the problem."
"No!" 1 screamed. "Kevin's as real as me.
I'll prove it."
I ran to the phone, which was sitting next
to Harvey, and dialed Kevin's number, but
there was no answer.
"He's not home," I said. "I'll call again
later."
A tear fell from Harvey's right eye. "You
just dialed your own number."
"Oh no!" I cried. "I made a mistake. I
wasn't thinking. I was a little nervous. I'll get
it right this time. A simple mistake. Everyone
makes mistakes."
But they were no longer listening. They
had made up their minds. They wouldn't be
lieve Kevin if they met him. They spoke
about me in the third person.
"What can we do for him?" asked Harvey.
"I'm afraid he's beyond hope," said Susan.
"He doesn't need to be hospitalized. Not yet
anyway. He seems harmless enough. Try to
humor him as much as possible."
Harvey nodded.
"But I hardly ever walk backwards," I
shouted. "Only once in a great while, when
I'm nervous."
I jumped up and began pacing, but I
walked into a corner and had to back out.
"Hardly ever!" I screamed.
