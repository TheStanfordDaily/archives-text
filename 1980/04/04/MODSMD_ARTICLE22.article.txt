## Draft keeps military strong but under control 
### 
Much controversy is raging
again regarding the re
establishment of the military
draft. Indeed, the youth of today
are showing signs, once again, of
serious rebellion to it.
As a 20-year veteran of the
military, I can readily empathize
with them in their resistance to
being drafted. Military life at its
best is still much worse than any
campus or other civilian milieu.
1 suspect that they are not so
much rebelling against serving
their country as they are still feel
ing the effects of seeing their ear
lier contemporaries become in
struments of an insane foreign
policy, fighting and dying in wars
that had no definitive meaningin
terms of protecting the nation
from its enemies; enemies that
did not exist. Nevertheless, I
would like to direct this message
to these current draft resisters as
food for thought.
It would well behoove you all
to consider that the greatest
threat to the democratic institu
tions of this country may well
come from within. No nation,
whether industrialized or not,
can prevent an armed takeover
of its government if the entity
taking over is that nation's
armed forces. It need not be
documented here, one only need
read history books to prove the
point.
The accession of political
power by armed forces is not a
revolution, yet in every instance,

the people have had little re
course but to accept their new
leaders. In the case of revolution,
the revolutionaries need the
support of the armed forces to
succeed.
Therefore, it can be argued
that the armed forces of a nation
may be a political instrument of
themselves, or of others in the
act of seizing political power.
This country in its most dire
moments, with the pointed ex
ception of the Civil War, has
never had to cope with the threat
of such an armed take-over. The
reason for this is quite simple.
This nation's armed forces has
been, by and large, a citizen force
made up of a mixture of both
professional soldiers and liber
ally educated officers and en
listed men. To the extent that its
members have come through the
draft from college and high
school backgrounds, embued
with a sense of preservation of a
citizen government, this liberal
element has safeguarded the
military, within its ranks, from
becoming a political power unto
itself.
Since many of these citizen
soldiers have every intention of
returning to their democratic re
public as civilians, it does not
stand in their interests to de
stroy, via an armed takeover,
their democratic institutions. To
remove the armed forces from
the body of the citizen democ
racy seriously jeopardizes the ba

lance of power within the nation.
A professional army, mercenary
in tradition, is much more likely
to fall prey to military de
mogogues turning it into an
enemy of the republic.
For those of you to the left in
the political spectrum, it would
be well to look to the extreme
right and see those smiling faces.
Then ask yourself how many
times in contemporary history
has it been an extreme right wing
act to use the armed forces in the
acquisition of political power!
To be sure, the only alterna
tives to preventing a nation's
armed forces from imposing its
will on its citizens is to either op
pose it on the field of battle,
which leads to civil war, a war an
unarmed citizenry can only lose,
or infiltrate its ranks and influ
ence its members.
In our current instance, the
absence of liberal thought and its
influence can only foster the
hardening of our armed forces
into an organization whose lead
ers may quickly forget whom
they serve.
To inject into the military
body on a continual basis citi
zens who regard our democratic
institutions as cherished above
all, may be the only way to pre
vent the possible, if not proba
ble, shift in the interna! balance
of governmental power.
If you view conscription as a
form of slavery, how will you
view your de facto slavery im
posed by a military government

you have no power over, and one
which is not required to recog
nize your rights as a citizen? How
would you accept a law that de
nies you the right to serve in the
nation's military? A law enacted,
perhaps, to maintain the merce
nary spirit of the armed forces
whose members are recruited
from the criminal element of soc
iety and from foreign armies.
History can testify to these pos
sibilities.
With respect to the sacrifice
you may make by serving two or
three years, I can only point to
the sacrifices made on those oc
casions when the citizens of this
nation gave their lives in our
legitimate wars. Consider if you
will, that today at draft age, you
see no real threat to your free
doms, but perhaps at the age of
35, when you hear the jackboots
in your streets, you will be pow
erless to oppose them. The citi
zens of Germany's democratic
period, between World Wars I
and II can vouch for that.
Distasteful as it may seem, to
preserve the republic from its
enemies outside requires a
strong, professional armed force,
and to preserve it from the po
tential enemies within, requires
the presence of a citizen military.
To abrogate your respon
sibilities and duties as free citi
zens is tantamount to handing
over your cherished freedoms
without a fight to a foreign
enemy. To serve your nation
honorably and faithfully, to con

tinue to influence the political
thought as citizens in pursuit of
freedom and justice which you
serve, and to be an instrument of
preserving your 200-year-old in
stitutions by insuring that the
military remains our servant and
not our master, then and only
then will you deserve and will
you have earned the life you now
enjoy.
