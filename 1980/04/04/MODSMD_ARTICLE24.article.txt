## The
						hostages: faces behind the symbol 
### 
Tlie Associated Press
Forty-eight men and two wo
men. Fifty Americans held hos
tage in Iran. Fifty individuals
who have become a common
symbol.
Governments negotiate their
future; mobs scream their fate.
A pilot. A former newspaper
carrier. A would-be geologist. A
father whose children call him
"Papa Bear." A teacher who
helped milk the cows when she
was a little girl.
Fifty individuals. United in the
bond of captivity. Hostages.
Separate in thoughts and
backgrounds. Human beings.
The 50 Americans who have
been held in the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran since it was seized by
militants on Nov. 4, 1979 come
from every part of the country.
They call more than 20 states
and the District of Columbia
home. They are from the big
cities like Detroit and New York
and from the farm communities
of lowa and Nebraska.
The hostages are white, black
and Hispanic. One is part
American Indian. The oldest is
over 60; the youngest is under
21.
Almost all the hostages work
for the U.S. government. About
20 of them are members of the
military. An equal number are
civilian employees of the State
Department.
They have seen service all over
the globe, in more than a dozen
countries, including Saudi

Arabia, Colombia, Zaire, Viet
nam, Canada, France, Pakistan,
Turkey, Greece and Germany.
David Roeder, 40, is a
lieutenant colonel in the Air
Force, a pilot whose brother re
calls him as a perfectionist, de
manding a 100 percent effort
from every member of his crew.
He grew up in Whitefish Bay,
Wis., just outside Milwaukee,
where his father — an Army
lieutenant colonel in World War
II —was an assistant high school
principal.
Kevin Hermening, 20, is a
sergeant in the Marine Corps.
Like Roeder, he is from a Mil
waukee suburb — Oak Creek.
His parents were divorced when
he was 13. As a boy, he was a
newspaper carrier.
Donald Cooke, 25, is from
Memphis, Tenn. He graduated
from Ohio State University and
joined the foreign service a year
ago. He went to Tehran hoping,
eventually, to get a job as a
geologist.
Richard Morefield, 50, the
consul general in Tehran joined
the State Department more than
20 years ago after a two-year
stint in the Army. "The kids call
him Papa Bear," said his wife
Dorothea. "That's sort of a fam
ily joke, because he loves to
growl."
Kathryn Koob, 41, one of
two women hostages, grew up in
Independence, lowa. "We grew
up on a small farm, and we all
had our chores to do," recalled

Mary Jane Engquist, one of Miss
Koob's sisters. "We had cows
which we had to milk . . . We had
chickens and it was us girls' re
sponsibility to take care of the
chickens . . ."
Charles Jones Jr., 39, also
grew up in the Midwest — but in
the big city. Jones was born in
Memphis, Tenn., but his family
moved to Detroit when he was

two years old, looking for a bet
ter living than poor blacks could
find in the South.
Jones decided to join the
foreign service and was stationed
in Egypt, Germany, Zaire, Israel
and France before his assign
ment to Tehran. "He is a very
good person," said his wife Mat
tie. "He'll do anything he can for
anybody."
