WASHINGTON — The
inspector-general of the De
partment of Energy was offered
a sinecure post in Paris after his
investigations of laxity and mis
management of the department
proved embarrassing even
though they saved millions of
dollars in public funds, informed
sources said Tuesday.
The post of Energy represen
tative for Europe was offered to
Kenneth Mansfield last month
by Secretary of Energy Charles
Duncan, Jr., these sources said.
They said Mansfield, a gadfly
who has assiduously investigated
everything from multimillion
dollar overcharges by oil com
panies to illegal long distance
telephone calls by government
employees, declined the offer.

The Paris post, newly created,
was described as largely ceremo
nial.
Duncan was absent on a trip to
Mexico, but a spokesman for the
secretary confirmed the job of
fer.
The disclosure followed publi
cation of a second annual report
to Congress by the Department
of Energy inspector-general cit
ing costly errors in departmental
operations and the benefits
gained from their correction.
These included reductions of as
much as $81 million in costs al
lowed to oil companies when
transferring oil from foreign
producing affiliates to domestic
refining affiliates, and large sav
ings achieved through more
careful accounting on special
projects and the work of contrac
tors and consultants.
