# Challenges as prime time leader
## CBS nears ABC ratings 
### Lee Margulies The Los Angeles Times 
HOLLYWOOD — Out of the
final turn and thundering down
the stretch, it's ABC leading by a
nose with CBS closing fast in the
high-stake race to determine
television's prime-time ratings
champion.
"It's the tightest race we've
had in 10 years," observed Ar
nold Becker, head of research at
CBS.
As of last week.AßC was av
eraging a 19.6 rating for its
prime-time programs since the
1979-80 TV season began Sept.
17 and CBS was right behind at
19.5. NBC was running third
with a 17.8 average. Three more
weeks remain before the season
officially ends April 20.
"If CBS can pull ahead it
would be quite a coup," noted
Anthony Hoffman, a media
analyst for Bache, Halsy, Stuart,
Shields. Inc. of New York.
That's because ABC has
dominated the prime-time rat
ings for the past three seasons,
beating runner-up CBS last year

by a hefty 2.2 points, and many
experts had predicted last fall
that ABC would widen that lead
this season.
Even Robert Daly, the presi
dent of CBS' entertainment divi
sion, conceded that "1 thought
we were going to have a good
year but 1 never thought we'd
pull even (with ABC). I didn't
think it was possible, mainly be
cause they (ABC) had the World
Series and the Winter Olym
pics." He would have been
happy, he said, to have closed to
within one point of ABC.
Instead CBS has closed to
within one-tenth of a point,
prompting Becker to declare.
"We won the season; it's as sim
ple as that. It doesn't matter
whether we come out ahead or
behind. Considering the expec
tations of the world when the
season began, in any meaningful
sense of the word, we won."
"I would have to agree with
that," said Marvin Mord. ABCs
research chief.
"Nonetheless." Becker added
in an interview, "it would be fun
to win literally."

And CBS is trying to do just
that. While not launching the
all-or-nothing ratings drive that
enabled it to come from behind
and eke out a seasonal win over
NBC in 1970, CBS has made
several program scheduling deci
sions aimed at boosting its rat
ings in the final week.
Ratings are a measurement of
audience size, with each point
representing 763,000 house
holds. They are used in selling
commercial time to advertisers,
who pay according to how many
people they reach. While the
overall network averages don't
determine those prices, they are
considered a yardstick for judg
ing relative strength. The net
work with the biggest prime
time average will earn the most
advertising revenue.
But one-tenth of a point dif
ference. which is probably the
most by which ABC or CBS
could win at this point, is said by
industry executives and analysts
to be virtually meaningless in
economic terms. "It's not going
to make or break anything finan
cially," said analyst Hoffman.
