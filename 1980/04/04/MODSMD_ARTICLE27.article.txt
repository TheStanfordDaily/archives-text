SAN FRANCISCO (AP) â€”
Saying "every effort is a learning
experience," Gov. Jerry Brown
returned to California Wednes
day evening, the day after he was
knocked out of the presidential
race in Wisconsin.
"I'm glad to be home," Brown
told reporters at the airport here.
"They (the voters) didn't feel I
was ready to be president. Both
the Democratic Party and the
country are in trouble. . . We are
headed toward economic panic.

"My role in the months ahead
here in California is to ensure
that the people of this state not
only survive this period, but, if
possible, prosper."
After landing here on a flight
from Milwaukee, Brown got into
a car bound for the state capital
in Sacramento.
Brown, badly beaten in New
Hampshire in February, had
dropped campaigning elsewhere
to concentrate on the Wisconsin
primary, but managed only 13

percent of the vote Tuesday, well
behind President Carter and
Sen. Edward Kennedy. After the
results, he announced his with
drawal as a candidate.
Appearing unshaven and a bit
tired, the governor dodged a
question here about whether he
would support either the presi
dent or Kennedy.
"I just finished one campaign;
I'm not anxious to get into
another, at least tonight," he
said.
