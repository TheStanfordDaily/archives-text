WASHINGTON â€” President
Jimmy Carter signed a com
promise $227.7 billion "windfall
profits" tax bill on oil companies
Wednesday and hailed it as a "vic
tory for every single American
citizen."
At a ceremony in the East
Room, the president noted that
when he proposed the legislation
a year ago, many said it would
never pass "because of the pow
erful influences that have been
focused against it."
New Jersey Gov. Brendan
Byrne, who headed a citizens

committee that lobbied for the
bill, portrayed Carter as not re
ceiving the proper credit:
"There are those, as you
know, if the president were to
walk across the Potomac this
morning, would headline it, 'The
president can't swim." "
Flanked by members of Con
gress who worked on the bill, in
cluding Senate Democratic
Leader Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia and the bill's sponsor,
Sen. Russell Long, (D-La.), Car
ter used two green pens to sign
the lengthy legislation.
The president said he wants
the money to be used to help
poor people pay their fuel bills,
to improve transit systems and to
develop new energy sources.
However, Congress has said it
wants 60 percent of the revenue,
or $137 billion, spent on reduc
ing federal income taxes.
But additional, specific legisla
tion will be needed to earmark
just how the money will be spent.
The bill is a compromise ver
sion of the $294 billion tax Car
ter recommended last April after
deciding to phase out federal
price controls on U.S. crude oil
production and reduce reliance
on imports.
