# Sat. mail may stop
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — The
Postal Service, choosing to hit
customers at the mailbox instead
of the pocketbook, now is con
sidering elimination of Saturday
deliveries as the only practical
way to meet proposed budget
cuts.
Postmaster General William
F. Bolger told the agency's gov
erning board Tuesday there ap
pears to be no way to maintain
six-day mail service, despite
President Carter's recommenda
tion for a much milder budget cut
than what Congress is consider
ing, unless postage rates are in
creased sooner than anticipated.
Bolger said he has ordered
task forces to study the effects of
reducing mail deliveries from six
to five days a week and the im
pact of that on labor relations.
Just a week ago, Bolger told
the House Budget Committee
that cuts aimed at balancing the
federal budget to help tame in
flation would mean either elimi
nation of Saturday mail or faster
rate increases.
President Carter's proposal to
trim just $250 million from the
Post Office budget for fiscal
198 1 — instead of the $836 mill
ion recommended by the House
Budget Committee — was
widely viewed in Congress as an
effort to maintain Saturday de
liveries. The Budget Committee
suggested ending them.
Nevertheless. Bolger told the
Postal Service's governing board
at a Baltimore meeting, in re
marks released in Washington,
that higher rates would be in

flationary in themselves and that
cutting service appears to be the
only feasible way to make up for
the loss of federal money.
"And the only service cut that
could possibly achieve savings at
the level being discussed is
elimination of a sixth day of de
livery," he said. "As undesirable
as this may be, the Postal Service
may have no other choice."
Bolger did not specifically
mention Saturday deliveries, but
that has been the day considered
more likely to be cut if the Post
Office goes to a five-day deliv
ery.
Ending Saturday mail de
liveries probably would affect
Americans more directly than
any other budget cut proposal.
Representatives of rural areas
have opposed it because weekly
newspapers frequently are deli
vered then.
Bolger said last week that
eliminating Saturday mail, but
continuing six-day window ser
vice, would save about $588 mill
ion in the first year and more
than one billion dollars a year by
1987. It also would cost about
15,000 to 20,000 jobs, mainly
among urban letter carriers, he
said.
Regardless of the budget cut,
the Postal Service already plans
to raise rates next year to cover
higher operating costs, and
Bolger said additional increases
to make up for reduced federal
subsidies would defeat the pur
pose of the Carter administra
tion's budget-balancing prog
ram.
