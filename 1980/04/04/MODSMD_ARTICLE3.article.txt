# East Asian house reps to meet with Res. Ed.
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Two student representatives from
the East Asian Studies theme house
proposal committee are scheduled to
discuss today what kind of "interim ar
rangement" the committee will be of
fered by the Office of Residential Edu
cation for next year.
Juniors Craig Trammell and Wolf
Bradley, both East Asian Studies
majors, will meet this morning with As
sociate Dean for Residential Educa
tion, Norm Robinson, to discuss Res.
Ed.'s offer.
The East Asian Studies theme house
committee suffered its second setback
in two years following a decision by
Dean of Student Affairs, James Lyons,
earlier this month.
The East Asian Studies program, ini
tially approved by the Configuration
Panel of the Committee on Student
Services Subcommittee on Residences
(COSS/R), was shelved for this year
because no residences in which to
house it were available. The faculty and
student committee which formulated
the proposal was told that existing
theme houses would be warned that
they faced competition from new
theme house proposals.
Shift
The committee re-proposed the
program this year, and was told in late
March that they would replace the
French House in its 610 Mayfield Row

residence next year. COSS/R had re
commended that La Maison Francaise
be discontinued for 1980-1981.
However, Lyons subsequently over
turned COSS/R's recommendation on
a procedural technicality, and "East
House" was again without a residence.
Lyons ruled that neither the resi
dents of the French House, nor French
Department Chairman, Ralph Hester,
had been given adequate forewarning
that the future of the house rested on a
marked improvement in the program
this year. Lyons agreed with COSS/R's
findings that the program was sub-par,
but decided that La Maison Francaise
shoud be given "one full probationary
year."
Protest
Following Lyon's decision, about a
dozen faculty supporters of the East
Asian Studies house proposal wrote a
letter to him protesting the decision.
Lyons said that his decision in no way
reflected on the merits of the East
Asian Studies program and that he was
not "pitting one theme house against
the other." Lyons said both he and
Robinson wanted to "keep the East
Asian Studies proposal alive" and
would attempt to set up an interim ar
rangement for next year.
Lyons said last week that he hopes
some location could be established
where the group could meet, hold
periodic events and possibly eat to
gether until a residence for the prog
ram could be secured.
Lyons added that the East Asian
studies house could be assured of a re
sidence by 1982, when the new housing
complex by Lagunita Court and the re
building of the fire-damaged Storey
House would open up new housing
space.
