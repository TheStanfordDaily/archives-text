# Carter levies gas tax

WASHINGTON (AP) â€”
President Carter signed a proc
lamation Wednesday imposing
a n import fee of $4.62 per barrel
on imported crude oil, which will
raise the price of gasoline by 10
cents per gallon.
Carter termed the levy a
"gasoline conservation fee." He
said that, although the actual tax
is on imported crude oil, a series
of government regulations will
impose the entire burden on
gasoline users.

The president had announced
plans for the fee in his March 14
address on anti-inflation moves.
The 10-cent hike in gasoline
prices is expected to show up at
the pump beginning May 15.
The plan came under attack
last week in Congress where a
House Commerce subcommittee
voted 17-3 to block the fee by
denying the Energy Department
the money needed to administer
it, but Carter has the authority to
impose the import fee without
congressional approval.
