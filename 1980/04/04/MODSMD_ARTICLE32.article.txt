# BUG ME

Whether or not you've been waiting impatiently
for the past two weeks for another witty, insightful
and informative Bug Me column, here I am again.
FTiese letters have all been waiting for about a
month, and I apologize to the various authors for
the delay.
Dear Bug Me,
If you can answer these questions, you may be
able to resolve the four-year-old argument between
my husband and me.
In California, are there more bicyclists or motor
cyclists? Which of the two are involved in more
accidents annually?
Each year, how many bicyclists are involved in
accidents which resulted from failure to use
adequate bike lights?
- Fear of Cycling
Well, I doubt I can solve the entire argument, but
here are some of the statistics I could find. The
Department of Motor Vehicles records the number
of motorcycles registered in the state as of last year
at 713,820. Of these, in case you're curious, 39,569
are registered in Santa Clara County.
Unfortunately, bicycle registration statistics
aren't recorded as accurately. Such registration is
optional in some counties and is not strictly en
forced in many that do require it. Let's just say
there are a lot of them.
The most recent accident statistics from the
California Highway Patrol are for the calendar
year 1978. In that year, when 655,950 motorcycles
were registered in California, there were 28,571
accidents involving injury to motorcyclists, and
784 motorcyclists were killed in accidents.
In the same year 91 14 bicyclists were injured in
accidents, and 82 were killed.
As for the immediate area, Captain Raoul
Niemeyer of Police Services said he thought there
were very few motorcyles compared to bicycles on
campus, and that there were very few bicycle acci
dents involving motor vehicles.

Niemeyer said that most bike accidents on cam
pus involve two bicyclists, or pedestrians or inani
mate objects. And very few occur at night he said.
I hope that helps a bit!
Dear Bug Me,
What percentage of Stun ford bio majors go to
medical school? What percentage go to grad schools
of biology? finally, what do human biology majors
do after their stay on the Farm?
I II start with the Human Biology Department
because it seems to keep much better track of its
students than does the Biology Department. Au
drey Bernfield, career counselor in human bio,
said that about 22 percent of the human bio majors
go directly on to medical school, and another 8
percent eventually follow that direction after work
ing a year or two.
Altogether, 45 percent of the human bio grads
go directly on to graduate schools in such wide
ranging areas as public health, dental, business,
theology, engineering, education and law schools.
The remaining 55 percent go to work, mainly in
medicine and health-related fields in both the pri
vate and public sector. But again, some end up in
such unusual fields as professional sports and re
porting!
Bernfield points out that of the human bio
majors who applied to medical schools last year, 93
percent were accepted. This is about the same suc
cess rate as the Biology Department: 90 percent of
those majors who applied last year were accepted.
The Biology Department does not yet keep track
of its students as well as human bio, but it will soon
design a questionnaire similar to human bio's,
according to its student affairs office.
The best I can tell you about the bio grads is that
about 30 percent apply to medical schools im
mediately after graduation. If I can find out any
more, I'll tell you next week!
Until then, I'll still be . . .
