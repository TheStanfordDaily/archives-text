# Reagan alters Olympic stand
## 
### Kenneth Reich The Los Angeles Times 
LOS ANGELES — Ronald Reagan, having
"stewed" for seven days on the merits of boycot
ting the Moscow Olympics, decided yesterday that
the boycott ought to go ahead after all, and that Los
Angeles ought to give up the 1984 Games besides.
In a statement issued here. Reagan said that he
believes it would be wrong for President Carter to
use coercive measures to prevent American
athletes from going to Moscow, but he is sure that if
an appeal is made to the athletes' "sense of duty to
their country and to freedom." they will voluntarily
stay awav.
"1 believe also that many of the political prob
lems that plague the Olympics would be eliminated
by permanently moving them back to their historic
home, Greece," said Reagan, the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. "We
could begin the process by forgoing the 1984
Olympics in the United States."
Reagan's statement about giving up the Los
Angeles Games drew an immediate negative reac
tion from Mayor Tom Bradley and Los Angeles
Olympics officials.
Withdrew support last week
The former California governor began a week
long reassessment of his stand on the Olympic
boycott March 26, when he told a news conference
in Wisconsin that he had withdrawn his support of
the president's boycott proposal because of reports
that few countries planned to join the United
States in staying away from the Moscow Games.
Saying that he was torn between the "hypocrisy"
of holding the Olympics in a country like the Soviet
Union and the desire of many American athletes to
fulfill lifelong ambitions by competing, Reagan
told reporters: "It's a tough one .... You'll just
have to let me stew about that one for a while."
Yesterday afternoon, word that Reagan had
finished stewing came from an unexpected source
— a member of Carter's White House staff. The
White House had been critical of Reagan's indeci
sion.
The White House aide said that if Ed Meese, a
senior staff member of Reagan's campaign, were

called at Reagan headquarters, he would have a
Reagan statement on the boycott.
Just how the White House aide knew that the
statement was ready was not ascertained, but when
Meese was reached moments later, he put a secret
ary on the line to read Reagan's statement.
Definitive statement
"We should boycott the Moscow Olympics,"
Reagan's statement said. "I think our allies should,
too. It is hypocritical to permit the Games to be
held in a nation which is actively engaged in aggres
sion."
Reagan's return to support of the boycott was
greeted enthusiastically at the White House,
where, coincidentally, two developments
elsewhere in the world broke the pattern of adverse
news the boycott coordinators have been getting
from Britain, Norway and other countries in recent
days.
First, the Canadian Olympic Association in
formed the government of Prime Minister Pierre
Trudeau that, despite its opposition to a boycott, it
would support one if the government decides that
Canada ought to join. Canadian External Affairs
Minister Mark MacGuigan announced that the
Trudeau government will consult with other West
ern countries to see how widespread the boycott
will be and make up its mind by the end of the
month.
Second, the administration was heartened by an
announcement by the Swiss Equestrian Federation
that it would boycott the Moscow Games.
"Over the long term, the practice of any sport is
placed in doubt if human rights and personal free
dom are not guaranteed," the federation said in a
letter calling on other Swiss athletes to join the
boycott. "It is always said that sports must be kept
separate from politics. In principle, we share that
view, but only while politics does not endanger our
elementary rights as citizens."
Administrative sources said the U.S. govern
ment now is putting its plans for alternative games
on the back burner and will spend the next few
weeks pushing hard for international support of a
boycott, letting any alternative games plans fall
into place later if the boycott is successful.
