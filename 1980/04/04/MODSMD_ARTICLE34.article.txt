# Rare public pronouncement
## Solzhenitsyn warns West of blunders 
### Peter Osnos The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the
exiled Soviet novelist and
political polemicist, has now
assailed the West for confusing
its hostility to communism —
which he regards as too tepid, in
any case — with suspicion of the
Russian nation and people.
In his first major
pronouncement in two years,
Solzhenitsyn also refines the
excoriation of the United States
that has marked his writing since
coming here in 1976, warning of
"fresh blunders which will
inevitably have lethal
repercussions in the future."
Solzhenitsyn's views are
contained in a lengthy article
published Wednesday in Foreign
Affairs, the quarterly journal of
the American foreign policy
establishment. Entitled
"Misconceptions about Russia
are a Threat to America,"the
article is severely critical by
name of, among others, former
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and former U.S.
ambassadors to the Soviet Union
Averell Harriman and George
Kennan, whom Solzhenitsyn
blames for failings of
understanding and will in dealing
with the Kremlin.
Given the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, Solzhenitsyn's
expressions of alarm about
Moscow's intentions are likely to
get a closer look than they might
in less tense times. But he has
offered these arguments before.
The burden of Solzhenitsyn's
message this time is against what
he regards as misconceptions
about the relationship between
Communism and Russia, where

the system was first imposed.
The grievous mistake, he writes,
"is to assume an indissoluble link
between the universal disease of
communism, and the country
where it first seized control —
Russia. This error skews one's
perception of the threat and
cripples all attempts to respond
sensibly to it, thus leaving the
West disarmed."
Solzhenitsyn contends that the
Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics is an artificial entity, a
totalitarian empire of many
conquered nations and peoples
that should not be confused with
Russia, one of those nations.
Although, as Solzhenitsyn notes
disapprovingly, Americans often
say Russians now comprise only
about half the Soviet population,
and the proportion is declining.
The fallacy, he asserts, is to
present modern communism as
the outgrowth of an alleged
"age-old Russian slave
mentality." The notion that
Russia is "anti-human in its
essence," Solzhenitsyn says, is
fostered by Western historians
(He particularly attacks Richard
Pipes of Harvard) and some
recent Soviet emigres.
"This interpretation,"
Solzhenitsyn writes, "currently
enjoys wide support since it is so
advantageous to many people: if
the crimes and vices of
communism are not inherent to
it, but can be attributed entirely
to the traditions of old Russia,
then it follows then that there
exists no fundamental threat to
the Western world; the rosy
vistas of detente are preserved,
together with trade and even
friendship with communist
countries, thereby ensuring

continued comfort and security
for the West.
"Western communists are
freed from incrimination and
suspicion ('they'll do a better
job; theirs will be a really good
communism') and a burden falls
from the conscience of those
liberals and radicals who lent so
much of their fervor and their
assistance to this bloody regime
in the past."
Ironically, some of the
historians of whom Solzhenitsyn
writes so disparagingly,
especially Pipes, and many of the
emigres, are almost as opposed
to the Soviets as is Solzhenitsyn.
But as he has demonstrated in
previous work and developed
further in this one, Solzhenitsyn
regards criticisms of Russia's
past as veritable blasphemy.
His view of the latter days of
czarist rule is positive in the
extreme:
"Before the outbreak of war in
1914, Russia could boast of a
flourishing manufacturing
industry, rapid growth and a
flexible decentralized economy.
"Significant progress had been
made in the field of workers'
legislation and the material
well-being of the peasants was at
a level which has never been
reached under the Soviet regime
"There was complete cultural
freedom, the intelligentsia was
not restricted in its activity,
religious and philosophical views
of every shade were tolerated
and institutions of higher
education enjoyed inviolable
autonomy . . . This picture is not
merely dissimilar to that of the

communist era, but it is in every
respect its direct antithesis."
Solzhenitsyn's contentions are
bound to be controversial,
considering the weight of
historical evidence to the
contrary. But there can be no
doubt any longer that his views
are in the strictest sense
reactionary. He favors the past
and all the authoritarian,
religious, social values of
pre-revolutionary Russia. He
abhors the present in his former
home and — as he did in his
celebrated commencement
address at Harvard in 1978 — in
what he sees as the declining
West.
The solution, Solzhenitsyn
maintains, is for the West to
finally accept the fundamentally
evil nature of communism
wherever it is (including China)
and galvanize itself to destroy it.
The current anti-Russian
thinking, he believes, is merely a
rationalization for inaction.
Although he doesn't say so
directly, Solzhenitsyn plainly
wants the West to separate
Russia from communism, as it
did Germany from Nazism, and
crush that enemy.
Today, he writes in
conclusion, the Western world
faces a greater danger than that
which threatened it in 1939.
Instead of a denigration of
Russia, he says, the West must
seek out means of aligning with
the Russian people: "So much
has been ceded, surrendered and
traded away that today even a
fully united Western world can
no longer prevail except by
allying itself with the captive
peoples of the communist
world."

(He particularly attacks Richard
Pipes of Harvard) and some
recent Soviet emigres.
"This interpretation,"
Solzhenitsyn writes, "currently
enjoys wide support since it is so
advantageous to many people: if
the crimes and vices of
communism are not inherent to
it, but can be attributed entirely
to the traditions of old Russia,
then it follows then that there
exists no fundamental threat to
the Western world; the rosy
vistas of detente are preserved,
together with trade and even
friendship with communist
countries, thereby ensuring

continued comfort and security
for the West.
"Western communists are
freed from incrimination and
suspicion ('they'll do a better
job; theirs will be a really good
communism') and a burden falls
from the conscience of those
liberals and radicals who lent so
much of their fervor and their
assistance to this bloody regime
in the past."
Ironically, some of the
historians of whom Solzhenitsyn
writes so disparagingly,
especially Pipes, and many of the
emigres, are almost as opposed
to the Soviets as is Solzhenitsyn.
But as he has demonstrated in
previous work and developed
further in this one, Solzhenitsyn
regards criticisms of Russia's
past as veritable blasphemy.
His view of the latter days of
czarist rule is positive in the
extreme:
"Before the outbreak of war in
1914, Russia could boast of a
flourishing manufacturing
industry, rapid growth and a
flexible decentralized economy.
"Significant progress had been
made in the field of workers'
legislation and the material
well-being of the peasants was at
a level which has never been
reached under the Soviet regime
"There was complete cultural
freedom, the intelligentsia was
not restricted in its activity,
religious and philosophical views
of every shade were tolerated
and institutions of higher
education enjoyed inviolable
autonomy . . . This picture is not
merely dissimilar to that of the

communist era, but it is in every
respect its direct antithesis."
Solzhenitsyn's contentions are
bound to be controversial,
considering the weight of
historical evidence to the
contrary. But there can be no
doubt any longer that his views
are in the strictest sense
reactionary. He favors the past
and all the authoritarian,
religious, social values of
pre-revolutionary Russia. He
abhors the present in his former
home and — as he did in his
celebrated commencement
address at Harvard in 1978 — in
what he sees as the declining
West.
The solution, Solzhenitsyn
maintains, is for the West to
finally accept the fundamentally
evil nature of communism
wherever it is (including China)
and galvanize itself to destroy it.
The current anti-Russian
thinking, he believes, is merely a
rationalization for inaction.
Although he doesn't say so
directly, Solzhenitsyn plainly
wants the West to separate
Russia from communism, as it
did Germany from Nazism, and
crush that enemy.
Today, he writes in
conclusion, the Western world
faces a greater danger than that
which threatened it in 1939.
Instead of a denigration of
Russia, he says, the West must
seek out means of aligning with
the Russian people: "So much
has been ceded, surrendered and
traded away that today even a
fully united Western world can
no longer prevail except by
allying itself with the captive
peoples of the communist
world."
WASHINGTON
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the
exiled Soviet novelist and
political polemicist, has now
assailed the West for confusing
its hostility to communism —
which he regards as too tepid, in
any case — with suspicion of the
Russian nation and people.
In his first major
pronouncement in two years,
Solzhenitsyn also refines the
excoriation of the United States
that has marked his writing since
coming here in 1976, warning of
"fresh blunders which will
inevitably have lethal
repercussions in the future."
Solzhenitsyn's views are
contained in a lengthy article
published Wednesday in Foreign
Affairs, the quarterly journal of
the American foreign policy
establishment. Entitled
"Misconceptions about Russia
are a Threat to America,"the
article is severely critical by
name of, among others, former
Secretary of State Henry A.
Kissinger and former U.S.
ambassadors to the Soviet Union
Averell Harriman and George
Kennan, whom Solzhenitsyn
blames for failings of
understanding and will in dealing
with the Kremlin.
Given the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, Solzhenitsyn's
expressions of alarm about
Moscow's intentions are likely to
get a closer look than they might
in less tense times. But he has
offered these arguments before.
The burden of Solzhenitsyn's
message this time is against what
he regards as misconceptions
about the relationship between
Communism and Russia, where

the system was first imposed.
The grievous mistake, he writes,
"is to assume an indissoluble link
between the universal disease of
communism, and the country
where it first seized control —
Russia. This error skews one's
perception of the threat and
cripples all attempts to respond
sensibly to it, thus leaving the
West disarmed."
Solzhenitsyn contends that the
Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics is an artificial entity, a
totalitarian empire of many
conquered nations and peoples
that should not be confused with
Russia, one of those nations.
Although, as Solzhenitsyn notes
disapprovingly, Americans often
say Russians now comprise only
about half the Soviet population,
and the proportion is declining.
The fallacy, he asserts, is to
present modern communism as
the outgrowth of an alleged
"age-old Russian slave
mentality." The notion that
Russia is "anti-human in its
essence," Solzhenitsyn says, is
fostered by Western historians
(He particularly attacks Richard
Pipes of Harvard) and some
recent Soviet emigres.
"This interpretation,"
Solzhenitsyn writes, "currently
