# Kahn urges less bureaucratic verbage
## 
### William J. Eaton The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — Despite
the high failure probability,
White House adviser Alfred
Kahn Wednesday implemented
a campaign to address pompos
ity, redundancy, gentility and of
ficialese.
To put that into English, as
Kahn urged a group of 175 gov
ernment writers to do, he ap
pealed for simpler and more di
rect language in federal docu
ments.
Kahn acknowledged that the
task is almost as hopeless as his
official job of restraining infla
tion as chairman of the Council
on Wage and Price Stability.
"But when people complain of
high prices I remind them the
dollars they are spending aren't
worth much anyhow," he said
with enough simplicity to make a
true bureaucrat shudder.
Kahn, a former Cornell Uni
versity professor of economics,
developed a reputation for insist
ing on clear writing when he was

chairman of the Civil Aeronau
tics Board in 1977-78.
So his topic at a one-day gov
ernment seminar on plain En
glish, or "PE" as it was de
scribed, was: "How writing like a
person can convert a bureaucrat
into a person."
Glib as ever, Kahn teed off on
some of his pet peeves in gov
ernment prose.
"If 1 never see the word 'im
plement' again 1 could die
happy," he said. "If you prom
ised me even that it would not be
used again in the next 10 years,
I'd die happy today and that
would get me out of my present
job."
As substitutes for "imple
ment" Kahn suggested "begin,
initiate, offer, exercise, use, pro
vide." As it is, he said, "imple
ment" has been used so often it
has become a piece of jargon
without meaning.
"Finalize, I hope, is going the
way of all flesh," he said, propos
ing "confirmed, completed or
finished" as alternatives.

"They may make you sound
less important but people will
like you better," Kahn told the
government writers.
He also criticized those in gov
ernment who reply to indignant
taxpayers with the phrase: "I
share your concern."
"That sounds like a prissy
YMCA secretary," he said. "It
makes me want to swear loudly
and make obscene gestures. Why
not write: "I am as mad as you
are.'?"
Before and after Kahn spoke
at a lunch for the writing
bureaucrats, seminars were held
on how to make complex regula
tions more readable, as Presi
dent Carter ordered in February,
1977.
Glaring examples of govern
ment gobbledegook were dis
played, such as this excerpt from
a federal handbook on fire pre
vention:
"Prevention is the avoidance
of fire occurrence. To the degree
that prevention efforts are suc
cessful, the problems related to

fire are completely avoided."
The General Accounting Of
fice also provided a gem: "It is
important to understand the var
ious aspects relating to all factors
in order to achieve a general feel
for the classification mode of
thinking as well as to be able to
explain to staff why factors ad
dressed on a position description
have not necessarily been ad
dressed on an assignment com
plexity evaluation."
And there was this from a De
partment of Energy memo: "The
ad hoc transition team is tem
porary in nature."
Kahn, summing up his writer's
creed, said: "I'm not here to
proclaim to you the aesthetic
value of eschewing garbage . . .
but clear English will help you to
do a better job."
There was no time for ques
tions after Kahn's speech be
cause he talked too long. Or as
he put it:"I got carried away by
my own verbosity."

"If 1 never see the word 'im
plement' again 1 could die
happy," he said. "If you prom
ised me even that it would not be
used again in the next 10 years,
I'd die happy today and that
would get me out of my present
job."
As substitutes for "imple
ment" Kahn suggested "begin,
initiate, offer, exercise, use, pro
vide." As it is, he said, "imple
ment" has been used so often it
has become a piece of jargon
without meaning.
"Finalize, I hope, is going the
way of all flesh," he said, propos
ing "confirmed, completed or
finished" as alternatives.

"They may make you sound
less important but people will
like you better," Kahn told the
government writers.
He also criticized those in gov
ernment who reply to indignant
taxpayers with the phrase: "I
share your concern."
"That sounds like a prissy
YMCA secretary," he said. "It
makes me want to swear loudly
and make obscene gestures. Why
not write: "I am as mad as you
are.'?"
Before and after Kahn spoke
at a lunch for the writing
bureaucrats, seminars were held
on how to make complex regula
tions more readable, as Presi
dent Carter ordered in February,
1977.
Glaring examples of govern
ment gobbledegook were dis
played, such as this excerpt from
a federal handbook on fire pre
vention:
"Prevention is the avoidance
of fire occurrence. To the degree
that prevention efforts are suc
cessful, the problems related to

fire are completely avoided."
The General Accounting Of
fice also provided a gem: "It is
important to understand the var
ious aspects relating to all factors
in order to achieve a general feel
for the classification mode of
thinking as well as to be able to
explain to staff why factors ad
dressed on a position description
have not necessarily been ad
dressed on an assignment com
plexity evaluation."
And there was this from a De
partment of Energy memo: "The
ad hoc transition team is tem
porary in nature."
Kahn, summing up his writer's
creed, said: "I'm not here to
proclaim to you the aesthetic
value of eschewing garbage . . .
but clear English will help you to
do a better job."
There was no time for ques
tions after Kahn's speech be
cause he talked too long. Or as
he put it:"I got carried away by
my own verbosity."
