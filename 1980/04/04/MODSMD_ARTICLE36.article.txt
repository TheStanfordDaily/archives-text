## Remedying the baseball strike 
### 
The recent announcement of a Major League baseball strike
distresses me. Among other things, it may mean serious trou
ble for chronic baseball fans this summer. And believe me, a
baseball junkie in need of a couple inning fix is not a pretty
sight.
So, in order to set things straight, something must be done
right away. With that in mind, 1 set out yesterday to come up
with some ideas to put an early end to this impending crisis.
These are my ideas.
1 )Shorten the length of a baseball game.
By shortening the length of major league baseball games to,
say, six innings, the owners would only have to pay each player
two-thirds of his salary.
Now, everyone knows two-thirds of a Major League
baseball player's salary is enough to live on. Besides, the
players should have nothing tocomplain about. They'll have all
kinds of free time to endorse Aqua Velva, invest in real estate
and write back-stabbing, best-selling books about the antics of
their teammates.
Of course, many baseball fans might disapprove at first, but
they would soon come to their senses. They'd soon find that
they can use their new found spare time to, say, work in their
garden, talk with their children, get their haircut or read the
sports page.
The major flaw with ths suggestion, as I see it, is the elimina
tion of the game's traditional seventh inning stretch, one of my
favorite parts of any baseball game. The only logical solution to
this problem. 1 suppose, is to change to a "fourth inning
stretch." But still, who needs to stretch after just four innings?
2) Make the game easier
That's right. It would be very simple to move the fences in to
say, 200 feet, shorten the base paths, and make the catcher tell
the batter what pitch to expect.
By making baseball ridiculously simple, owners could get
low-quality players, at low prices, to fill their rosters, while
slowly phasing out the better, more expensive, players.
The key to this plan rests in the fact that the fans would never
know what hit them. They couldn't possibly tell how big the
field is from the stands, and they certainly wouldn't be able to
hear the catcher speaking with the batter. The players would
look like offensive super-gods, blasting home runs every which
way and rounding the bases in record time. The fans would love
it.
The major problem with this plan, however, is that I just
printed it and now you know. Oh well.
3) Offer to pay the players foreign currency.
This is my most devious plan. The owners could very care
fully omit the word "dollars" from all contracts. Then, when
they get players to sign for the season, they dupe them into
believing they are in for a lot more money than they'll ever
receive by secretly paying them in Lira, for example.
4) Give up — eliminate baseball forever.
Just think, no more Joe Garagiola. No more bothersome
baseball cliches. No more Little League parents bitching at
their kids. It might not be all that bad.
Why not just bag our national passtime, anyway? We could
get a new one easy enough. How about cricket? Most cricket
matches are free, too.
And remember, by getting rid of baseball, we would elimi
nate one of the most annoying advertising campaigns ever
produced. After all, how would "They go together in the good
ol' USA, cricket, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet" sound?
When you think about it, baseball really is an unusual
pastime. What other pastime do you know of that only serves
mustard with its hot dogs? Or how about a pastime that has
such strange looking uniforms? And how could getting hit in
any other pastime possibly hurt as much as being struck with a
pitch?
So, you see, there are solutions to the present baseball
dilemma. It's not the kind of situation that can't be
straightened out with a little common sense. If we could only
convince the players and the owners to use a little, the season
would probably go ever-so-smoothly. But for now, all we can
do is sit and watch. Or sit and not watch as the case may be.

pitch?
So, you see, there are solutions to the present baseball
dilemma. It's not the kind of situation that can't be
straightened out with a little common sense. If we could only
convince the players and the owners to use a little, the season
would probably go ever-so-smoothly. But for now, all we can
do is sit and watch. Or sit and not watch as the case may be.
The recent announcement of a Major League baseball strike
distresses me. Among other things, it may mean serious trou
ble for chronic baseball fans this summer. And believe me, a
baseball junkie in need of a couple inning fix is not a pretty
sight.
So, in order to set things straight, something must be done
right away. With that in mind, 1 set out yesterday to come up
with some ideas to put an early end to this impending crisis.
These are my ideas.
1 )Shorten the length of a baseball game.
By shortening the length of major league baseball games to,
say, six innings, the owners would only have to pay each player
two-thirds of his salary.
Now, everyone knows two-thirds of a Major League
baseball player's salary is enough to live on. Besides, the
players should have nothing tocomplain about. They'll have all
kinds of free time to endorse Aqua Velva, invest in real estate
and write back-stabbing, best-selling books about the antics of
their teammates.
Of course, many baseball fans might disapprove at first, but
they would soon come to their senses. They'd soon find that
they can use their new found spare time to, say, work in their
garden, talk with their children, get their haircut or read the
sports page.
The major flaw with ths suggestion, as I see it, is the elimina
tion of the game's traditional seventh inning stretch, one of my
favorite parts of any baseball game. The only logical solution to
this problem. 1 suppose, is to change to a "fourth inning
stretch." But still, who needs to stretch after just four innings?
2) Make the game easier
That's right. It would be very simple to move the fences in to
say, 200 feet, shorten the base paths, and make the catcher tell
the batter what pitch to expect.
By making baseball ridiculously simple, owners could get
low-quality players, at low prices, to fill their rosters, while
slowly phasing out the better, more expensive, players.
The key to this plan rests in the fact that the fans would never
know what hit them. They couldn't possibly tell how big the
field is from the stands, and they certainly wouldn't be able to
hear the catcher speaking with the batter. The players would
look like offensive super-gods, blasting home runs every which
way and rounding the bases in record time. The fans would love
it.
The major problem with this plan, however, is that I just
printed it and now you know. Oh well.
3) Offer to pay the players foreign currency.
This is my most devious plan. The owners could very care
fully omit the word "dollars" from all contracts. Then, when
they get players to sign for the season, they dupe them into
believing they are in for a lot more money than they'll ever
receive by secretly paying them in Lira, for example.
4) Give up — eliminate baseball forever.
Just think, no more Joe Garagiola. No more bothersome
baseball cliches. No more Little League parents bitching at
their kids. It might not be all that bad.
Why not just bag our national passtime, anyway? We could
get a new one easy enough. How about cricket? Most cricket
matches are free, too.
And remember, by getting rid of baseball, we would elimi
nate one of the most annoying advertising campaigns ever
produced. After all, how would "They go together in the good
ol' USA, cricket, hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet" sound?
When you think about it, baseball really is an unusual
pastime. What other pastime do you know of that only serves
mustard with its hot dogs? Or how about a pastime that has
such strange looking uniforms? And how could getting hit in
any other pastime possibly hurt as much as being struck with a
pitch?
So, you see, there are solutions to the present baseball
dilemma. It's not the kind of situation that can't be
straightened out with a little common sense. If we could only
convince the players and the owners to use a little, the season
would probably go ever-so-smoothly. But for now, all we can
do is sit and watch. Or sit and not watch as the case may be.
