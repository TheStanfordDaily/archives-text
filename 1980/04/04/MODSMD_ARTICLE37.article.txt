The "Big Match" was vintage
Stanford vs. Cal. It started at 1
p.m. and the final outcome
wasn't decided until nearly 1
a.m.
The match pitted the No. 1
ranked team in the nation, Cal,
against the No. 2 team, Stanford.
There was superb tennis, clutch
play, upsets, veterans against
rookies, disputed line calls,
obscenities and boisterous parti
san crowds. And when it was all

over, there was no Axe but there
was a jubilant Cal team and a
disappointed Stanford tennis
team, as the Bears edged out the
Cards 5-4.
It wasn't until 12:55 that Cal's
Marty Davis and Chris Dunk de
feated Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne in the No. 1 doubles
match 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to clinch the
victory for Cal, after a long hard
day of tennis which began 12
hours earlier.
The dual match began with
Stanford quickly in the hole. A

pair of Berkeley freshmen, Phil
Lenhoff and Randy Nixon,
swept to wins at the No. 4 and
No. 6 position, defeating Stan
ford's Dave Siegler and Jeff
Arons. Lenhoff defeated Siegler
6-4,6-1 and Nixon ousted Arons
6-2, 6-3 to stake Cal to a 2-0
lead.
But Stanford's dependable
No. 3 man Tim Mayotte nar
rowed Cal's lead to 2-1 with a
6-1, 4-6, 6-0 triumph over Cal
senior Chris Dunk.
The crowd then focused its at
tention on the No. 5 match bet
ween sophomore Scott Bondur
ant of Stanford and Cal's Mike
Bauer. After splitting the first
two sets, Bondurant broke
Bauer's serve to go up 4-2 in the
third but lost his own serve on a
brilliant top spin lob by Bauer to
narrow the lead to 4-3. But
Bauer then double faulted on a
no ad point to lose his serve, and
"Bon Man" served out the
match to score a thrilling 6-3.
2-6, 6-3 win to knot the team
score at 2-2.
Bondurant had a strategy
going into the match and appa
rently it paid off. "He's a tough
guy to get a rhythm going on be
cause he hits the ball so hard, but
I tried to keep the pressure on
him. The strategy was to keep
the ball to his forehand on both
the volley and the passing shot."
The action then went to dou
bles and Stanford momentarily
captured the lead as Bondurant
and Siegler teamed to defeat
Lenhoff and Bauer 6-4,6-2. Bi> t
Cal fought back in the No. %
doubles as Nixon and Scott \ c _
Cain turned back Mayotte ant j
Arons 7-5, 6-3. Mayottf.. an( j
Arons appeared to have ffc, e first
set in hand but lost two s ,f : \ points
on serve before falling to the
Bear's duo.
The match mov<<.,d inside to
Berkeley's Harmo r, Gym tied at
3-3 with a par 112f t ',san crowd of
4000 on hand. 'jJoyd Bourne of
Stanford mor/, en tarily quieted

the crowd as he snatched the first
set from Cal's Marty Davis
who stormed back to take the
second set 6-1 and broke
Bourne's serve at 4-3 in the third
set after a heavily disputed line
call to post a 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 vic
tory.
In a must-win situation, the
Cards turned to their Peter Re
nnert who faced Cal's All-
America Scott McCain along
with a very vocal crowd. As Re
nnert noted, "The Berkeley
crowd was rude. They weren't
just rooting for McCain, they
were yelling in the middle of my
serve and in the middle of thf.
points." But Rennert managr j/j
to fend off both opponents as, » ne
rallied from a 2-4 deficit in,
first set and held on in the s' * con[ j
set after leading 5-2 to ' icore a
6-4, 7-6 victory.
Rennert's victory \c } cked the
score at 4-4 and s, f . t U p t j, e

Tim Mayotte, the Cards' No. 3 singles player, defeated Cal's
Chris Dunk in three sets. The team wasn't so fortunate overall
though, dropping the match 5-4.

The "Big Match" was vintage
Stanford vs. Cal. It started at 1
p.m. and the final outcome
wasn't decided until nearly 1
a.m.
The match pitted the No. 1
ranked team in the nation, Cal,
against the No. 2 team, Stanford.
There was superb tennis, clutch
play, upsets, veterans against
rookies, disputed line calls,
obscenities and boisterous parti
san crowds. And when it was all

over, there was no Axe but there
was a jubilant Cal team and a
disappointed Stanford tennis
team, as the Bears edged out the
Cards 5-4.
It wasn't until 12:55 that Cal's
Marty Davis and Chris Dunk de
feated Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne in the No. 1 doubles
match 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 to clinch the
victory for Cal, after a long hard
day of tennis which began 12
hours earlier.
The dual match began with
Stanford quickly in the hole. A

pair of Berkeley freshmen, Phil
Lenhoff and Randy Nixon,
swept to wins at the No. 4 and
No. 6 position, defeating Stan
ford's Dave Siegler and Jeff
Arons. Lenhoff defeated Siegler
6-4,6-1 and Nixon ousted Arons
6-2, 6-3 to stake Cal to a 2-0
lead.
But Stanford's dependable
No. 3 man Tim Mayotte nar
rowed Cal's lead to 2-1 with a
6-1, 4-6, 6-0 triumph over Cal
senior Chris Dunk.
The crowd then focused its at
tention on the No. 5 match bet
ween sophomore Scott Bondur
ant of Stanford and Cal's Mike
Bauer. After splitting the first
two sets, Bondurant broke
Bauer's serve to go up 4-2 in the
third but lost his own serve on a
brilliant top spin lob by Bauer to
narrow the lead to 4-3. But
Bauer then double faulted on a
no ad point to lose his serve, and
"Bon Man" served out the
match to score a thrilling 6-3.
2-6, 6-3 win to knot the team
score at 2-2.
Bondurant had a strategy
going into the match and appa
rently it paid off. "He's a tough
guy to get a rhythm going on be
cause he hits the ball so hard, but
I tried to keep the pressure on
him. The strategy was to keep
the ball to his forehand on both
the volley and the passing shot."
The action then went to dou
bles and Stanford momentarily
captured the lead as Bondurant
and Siegler teamed to defeat
Lenhoff and Bauer 6-4,6-2. Bi> t
Cal fought back in the No. %
doubles as Nixon and Scott \ c _
Cain turned back Mayotte ant j
Arons 7-5, 6-3. Mayottf.. an( j
Arons appeared to have ffc, e first
set in hand but lost two s ,f : \ points
on serve before falling to the
Bear's duo.
The match mov<<.,d inside to
Berkeley's Harmo r, Gym tied at
3-3 with a par 112f t ',san crowd of
4000 on hand. 'jJoyd Bourne of
Stanford mor/, en tarily quieted

the crowd as he snatched the first
set from Cal's Marty Davis
who stormed back to take the
second set 6-1 and broke
Bourne's serve at 4-3 in the third
set after a heavily disputed line
call to post a 4-6, 6-1, 6-3 vic
tory.
In a must-win situation, the
Cards turned to their Peter Re
nnert who faced Cal's All-
America Scott McCain along
with a very vocal crowd. As Re
nnert noted, "The Berkeley
crowd was rude. They weren't
just rooting for McCain, they
were yelling in the middle of my
serve and in the middle of thf.
points." But Rennert managr j/j
to fend off both opponents as, » ne
rallied from a 2-4 deficit in,
