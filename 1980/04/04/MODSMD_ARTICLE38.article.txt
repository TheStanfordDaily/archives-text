# Stanford drops one to Cal in 10th
## The 						Stanford Daily 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
In extra-inning, come-from
behind fashion, the Cal Bears
edged Stanford's baseball team
yesterday 6-5, dropping the
Cards' conference record to 5-8
in the tightly packed Pac-10
baseball race.
The visiting Cards, ahead from
the first inning, fell in the bottom
of the tenth when Cal's Rod Jes
sen singled to right scoring a
pinch runner despite a great
throw by rightfielder John El
way. Stanford, however, will get
another chance this afternoon
here at the Sunken Diamond in
the second of a three game
home-home and home series

with Cal. The third game will be
played tomorrow in Berkeley.
Yesterday, though, the
baseball Cards dropped a knee
knocker that, according to assis
tant coach Scott Laurence, "we
should have won. They got a lot
of lucky breaks, just like last year
when they beat us." Luck or no,
the Bears got it when they
needed it, pushing home three in
the bottom of the eighth to even
the game at five and then clinch
ing it in the tenth.
With one away in the bottom
of the tenth, the Bears' desig
nated hitter Wood walked and
was quickly replaced with pinch
runner Guinn. Shortstop Rooker
then slapped a George Lopez

pitch for a single, moving Guinn
to second. Jessen sealed the
Cards' fate with a slash to right.
Freshman Elway, who will soon
be practicing with the footbal
lers, made a go of it, however. He
came up with a great throw that
might have had the runner beat
but when catcher Bill Worden
lunged for Guinn the ball pop
ped out and the Bears' went
home with the win in their back
pocket.
The loss dropped the Cards'
record to 20-11, 5-8 in confer
ence play. Cal's record is now
22-10-1 overall and 7-6 in the
conference.
A Cal victory didn't seem in
the cards the first seven innings.

In the first. Card Dave Meier
drove home Phil Wilson with a
solid poke to left. Stanford's lead
was upped to 2-0 in the top of the
third behind a Paul Zuvella
home run.
And then in the top of the
fourth, Stanford scored it's third
unanswered run when third
baseman Bob DeCosta and cen
terfielder Darryl Stephens
opened the inning with singles.
Freshman outfielder Mike Dot
terer laid down a sacrifice bunt
that Bear starting pitcher
Hensley threw away, scoring
DeCosta and moving Card run
ners to second and third with
none out. The first three hitters
of the Stanford batting order
then grounded out stranding
both runners, a problem that
haunted Stanford for the second
game in a row. The last two
games, with Cal yesterday and
Nevada-Las Vegas Tuesdav,
Stanford left 11 men on base.
After Larry Kuhn (who, de
spite serving up a two-run
gopher ball in the fourth, al
lowed only two other hits while
striking out six Bears) and Bob
Boatman had left for the prover
bial showers, Brian Mignano
opened the eighth on the mound
for the Cards after shutting down
Cal in the seventh. Mignanc- 'gave
up two consecutive doubles to
start the inning.
Down by two, 5-3, Be ar third
baseman Zunino grounded to
second baseman Zuvella whose
throw pulled first basern an Lor
ing Davie's foot off the bag, put
ting runners on first an* J third. A
ground out scored U ie second
run of the inning andi when Mig
nano went 3-0 on th'.» next hitter,
Card head coach Ma rk Marquess
lifted Mignano fcvr Lopez, the
eventual loser. Be fore the inning
had ended, Lopc ;z allowed the
tying run which pushed the game
into the game-'Ending tenth.
Despite twcj, setbacks in the
course of thr e e days, Laurence
believes that 5 itanford is "riding
a high peak o ow. The defense is

the best in the Pac-10." Besides
solid senior performances. Card
success can be partly attributed
to the freshman class which
Laurence calls, "the best in my
five years here. These freshmen
work so hard. We start four or
five a game and they are getting
better every game. Elway, Dot
terer, Buechele, Aldrete work
very hard. Stephens has so much
natural ability. I think that he has
the potential to be better than
Larry Reynolds." (Reynolds was
the Cards all Pac-10 centerfiel
der the past three years.) Laur
ence added, "We're hitting the
best we have all year. And our
new pitching system is working
very well."
That system, started after the
UCLA game, spreads the
pitcher's innings out so as to give
a few each game three or four
innings a shot, instead of letting
the starter go as far as he can.
The reasons, according to Laur
ence are "to get the best out of
them, give them three or four
strong innings as most of the
starters are about the same in ta
lent. This system also serves to
allow the pitchers to come back a
couple days later. For example,
Larry Kuhn will probably pitch
again Saturday."
Today Card hurler Paul
Grame will most likely get the
starting nod in trying to even the
freeway series at one game
apiece. Although hurt at the be
ginning of the season, the hard
throwing Grame is regaining his
strength and is coming off four
strong innings against UCLA re
cently. If the Cards take the next
two, they would move into a tie
with Cal, currently second in tb
Pac-10, putting Stanford wi\ n j n
striking distance of conf' vrence
leader Arizona St? <fe
