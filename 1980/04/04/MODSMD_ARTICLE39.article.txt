# Trackmen take on Bruins
## 
### Templin Dowling Staff Writer 
Today marks the beginning of
a big weekend for both of Stan
ford's track teams. The women's
team travels to Berkeley today to
compete in the Cal Invitational/
Pentathlon, while the men's
team hosts a double dual meet at
Stanford Stadium Saturday.
In the men's meet, the Cards,
3-1, will take on undefeated
UCLA, and the Cal Bears will
battle the tough USC Trojans.
The action begins at 1 p.m.
Hurdler-sprinter Greg Fors
ter, the 1978 NCAA 110-meter
titlist, leads the UCLA squad.
Sprinter Eric Brown (10.20,
20.80), hurdler Andre Phillips
(49.47), pole vaulter Anthony

Curran (17-4V4), high jumper
Lee Balki (7-3V4) and long
jumpers Chip Benson (25-1 Vi,
53-7) and Dokie Williams (25-
OV4) add considerable depth to
the Bruins' team.
"It's a tremendous opportun
ity to meet of the best — if
not the best — dual meet teams
in the country," Stanford coach
Brooks Johnson said, seeing the
bright side of a tough match.
"UCLA has a distinct edge over
us in the sprint and field events.
However, I think we can be
competitive from the 800 meters
on up."
Potential point winners for the
Cards are Darrin Nelson in the
100 and 200 meter dashes, Gor
don Banks in the 200 meter

dash, Rick Buss in the discus,
John Schaer in the 800, and Gary
Bruner in the javelin.
Buss and Dave Thomson have
already qualified for the NCAA
Championships in the hammer
throw with season bests of 210-7
and 201-0 respectively. How
ever, the hammer event (starting
at 12:30 p.m. at Angell Field)
will be a non-scoring exhibition
this weekend.
