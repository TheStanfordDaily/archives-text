## Men's golf team finishes well 
### 
Led by senior Steve Schroeder's sixth-place
/Inish the Stanford men's golf team made a solid
showing in the Western Intercollegiate tournament
at Pasatiempo golf course this weekend.
Schroeder, who fired a three over par 216,
finished 7 shots behind top-rated amateur Bob
Clampett of BYU, who claimed medalist honors.
Head coach David Yates felt the team could
have made a better showing."After the first two
rounds I felt we could finish third. We played
mediocre down the stretch. The last few holes cost
us a super showing."
Stanford was also led by senior Ken Bakst, who
shot 75-73-76 to finish second low for the Cards.
Sophomore Neil Robinson (75-84-76), along
with Junior Doug Clarke (82-77-78) also contri
buted to the team's eighth place showing.
Clampett shot a final-round 4 under par 67 to

pass Ron Commons of USC, the leader after two
rounds. Clampett remarked, "I was very pleased
with my play over the last round, especially the last
12 holes I played 5 under par."
The Western, which is considered the best inter
collegiate tournament in golf next to the NCAAs,
once again showed that Clampett is the finest
amateur today. USC, paced by second-place
finisher Ron Commons, showed that it is one of the
strongest teams in the West. Mike Wiechers, from
Atherton, sank a long and difficult putt on the final
hole to clinch USC'sone-shot victory over UCLA.
"I felt I could have played better," commented
Bakst, "But 224 on this tough course and this field
is satisfying." Robinson agreed, "We did not show
the potential that our team has. I hope we will show
our strength in the next few weeks."
