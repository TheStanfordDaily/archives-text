Once again Stanford will be
•>the site for the Western States
Lacrosse Tournament this
weekend. Sixteen men's teams
from Canada to San Diego will
compete for the Norm Webb
Trophy, awarded to the one
team that remains undefeated
through four games.
A total of 25 games will be
played over the weekend on the
four deGuerre playing fields.

Stanford is slated to open the
tournament against a tough San
Dieguito squad at 9:30 a.m.
Saturday. Matches will be shor
tened to 40 minutes each to ac
commodate all the games that
must be played.
The Cardinals are seeking to
repeat as California state col
legiate champions. Last year,
representing Northern Califor
nia, Stanford defeated UC-Santa
Barbara to take the title. The
team has played five games so far

this season, posting a 3-2 record.
The team has been devastating in
victory, crushing University of
Pacific 13-3, UCLA 11-8, and
Santa Clara 18-1. The opening
season match against Palo Alto
was hotly contested, with the
Cards losing by one, 9-8.
The Cardinals
face a tough challenge if they are
to repeat as collegiate champs:
the squad must win all remaining
league games, including the Big
Game against Berkeley, a team

vastly improved over last year.
Stanford is led by attackmen
Rick Valentine (currently the
team's high scorer) and Dickie
Taylor (assist leader). Kirk
Phelps and Peter Werner lead
the formidable middle lines.
Rich Ward, Chuck Renner and
Mike Luttrup head the stalwart
defense. "Thai" Hongladarum
has been excellent in the goal,
and the return of native Mary
lander Denny Childs should
round out an already solid team.
