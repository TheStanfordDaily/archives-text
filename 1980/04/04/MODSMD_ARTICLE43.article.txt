### Edie Bogart Staff Writer 
Stanford's women's lacrosse
team got their first taste of East
ern intercollegiate competition
last week when they traveled to
the East Coast to pi ay four tough
matches after a 36-team tour
nament at Princeton University
was rained out. The Cards
played Bryn Mawr. Swarthmore,
Pennsylvania, and Princeton.
Stanford had a good trip, win
ning two and losing two. The
team beat Bryn Mawr (12-3)and
Swarthmore (20-2) convincingly
and lost just as convincingly to
Penn and Princeton. 27-1 and
20-2.
"We played a hot and cold

standard of schools," com
mented Christy Wagner, one of
Stanford's better players; "they
were really varied."
Penn is one of the stronger lac
rosse teams in the East, and they
are the first really good team
Stanford has played. Princeton
was not as strong, but the Cards
were very tired, as they had
played four games in four days.
"Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore
were fun to play," according to
Nancy Van Nest, another key
player; "we played together
well."
Both Wagner and Coach Bar
bara Longstreth are pleased with
the team's performance. They
both feel it was a very worth

while trip. The team learned
what aspects of their game to
work on in order to be ready to
compete again in the East, which
is the home of the best lacrosse in
the country. Longstreth
explained, "We have to improve
our speed of execution so we can
change direction (of play) more
quickly. Hie Eastern teams are
much quicker; we don't have to
play fast to succeed in the West."
The team must also learn to be
more tenacious in defense; they
must be in position to intercept
better. "Our basic skills are not
as polished as the Easterners', "
Longstreth said.
Lacrosse is only 40 years old in
California, and it is more of a

club sport than in the East. Some
college undergraduates play, but
Western teams are clubs, largely
composed of community people.
The Eastern teams are also more
experienced.
According to Coach
Longstreth, Stanford's team is a
"very positive group; 1 am very
pleased with their nice rapport."
The first-year players, three of
whom traveled East with the
team, pick up skills very fast.
Stanford's lacrosse history of
four years has been very success
ful. "Our first losses were last
week," said Longstreth; "we
needed perspective, and after we
played the Eastern teams, we
know what we need to work on."
