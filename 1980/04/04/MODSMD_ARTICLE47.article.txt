# Baseball strike: A vote for players
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) — It
was only five years ago that the
courts ruled that any baseball
player could become a free agent
at the expiration date of his con
tract. In effect, now the owners
want to end free agency for all
but the superstar.
So here is one vote for the
players in the latest, and cer
tainly most serious, hassle in
major league history, a hassle
that could leave the 1980 season
in ruins.
The players decided last Tues
day to strike for the remainder of
the exhibition season, then re
turn to open the regular season
next Wednesday. But they'll re
view the situation on May 22,
and a walkout at that time seems
likely.
It's been made clear by both
the Major League Players As
sociation and team owners that
free agent compensation is the
major roadblock standing in the
way of a basic four-year agree
ment to replace the one which
expired last Dec. 31.
Both sides appear adamant in
their stands.
The owners want compensa
tion for a lost "highly sought"
free agent whereby the signing
team, after protecting 15
players, would lose a player to
the team originally losing the
free agent.
The players, meanwhile, say,
in effect' "Why should we relin
quish something we already
have" — no compensation in
such cases.

In 1975, it was ruled that
Andy Messersmith and Dave
McNally were free agents and so
was anybody else upon expira
tion of his contract. The next
year, the players made a couple
of major concessions by agreeing
that a player would have to be a
major leaguer for six years be
fore becoming a free agent and
that he could negotiate with only
as many as 13 teams.
Marvin Miller, the executive
director of the Players Associa
tion, makes a number of rather
significant points when he elabo
rates on this situation.
In most cases, players need
three of four years of seasoning
before they reach the majors.
When you add in another six
years at the big league level,
most players have no say as to
where they'll play for nine or 10
years.
When a player qualifies for
free agency, or decides to take
that route, he's not a kid any
more. Again, bear in mind that
prior to this time, a player basi
cally has to take or leave what
he's offered.
In the case of a superstar, it
wouldn't matter that a team
could protect 15 players and
then lose somebody.
The top-flight player will
command rich offers, compensa
tion or not, but what about guys
like Jay Johnstone, Freddie
Patek, Joe Morgan, Rennie
Stennett or John Curtis? These
were among the players who
signed free agent contracts dur
ing the most recent off-season.
