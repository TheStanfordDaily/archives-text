Trader Vic's
2t) Cosmos PI.
San Francisco
(415) 776-2232
Trader Vic's has been a part of
the San Francisco scene for so
long that we tend to take it for
granted. But pleasure and en
joyment continue to be a part of
this elegant dining experience.
During the 1930'5, Victor
Bergeron established the first
Trader Vic's in Oakland. Today,
less than 50 years later, there are

19 different Trader Vic's located
throughout the United States,
Europe and Canada. The San
Francisco reslaurant, now run by
Bergerson's son, Lynn, is the
crown jewel of the entire opera
tion. With a personality all its
own. this Trader Vic's is as color
ful as the people and the city it
serves.
No other restaurant com
mands the same unique Polyne
sian flair. The walls and roof are
"Thatched", fishing nets and
glass floats are suspended from

the ceiling, and carv ed masks de
corate each of the three main di
ning rooms. The world of a South
Sea isle beckons the moment you
walk in the door.
We were escorted to our table
by David Gibson, our captain for
the evening. The room is ar
ranged to accomodate a
maximum number of people in a
minimum amount of space. For
tunately for the customers, dark
colors, soft amber lighting and an
efficient entourage of waiters
and busboys help to compensate
for an atmosphere that might
otherwise be crowded and noisy.
The menu is awesome. De
scriptions of Chinese country
cooking, Calcutta curries, and

Oysters Florentine tease imagi
nation and palate both. Almost
discouraged by the range of our
selection, we decided to place
our order in the hands of our cap
tain. If this is your first visit to
Trader Vic's, we suggest that you
might want to do the same.
At David's recommendation,
we began with the Cosmos Tid
bits, a delightful array of sea
food. pork and cheese appetiz
ers. The three old favorites, fried
shrimp, barbequed spareribs and
eggroll, were superb; especially
the eggroll, whose flaky pastry
wrapper was really exceptional.
And yet the two new features.
Crab Rangoons and Cheese
Bings, were even better. The

rangoons consisted of a cream
and crab mixture dipped and
fried in a sweet wonton batter
and made a nice variation of the
traditional Chinese snack. The
Cheese Bings, warm and tangy
bundles of three different kinds
of cheeses, were one more treat.
Again relying on the advice of
our captain, we ordered the
Cosmos Salad Marie and Bongo
Bongo Soup. As the names
suggest, both dishes are house
specialties.
The salad is a fantastic combi
nation of mushroom, celery, and
artichoke slices in Trader Vic's
own musturd dressing, a dressing
which enhances without ever
drowning the central ingre
dients. Taste, texture and the
thought of eating all "those heal
thy things" made this vegetable
medley agreeable to both body
and soul.
Bongo Bongo Soup — some
how the name alone seems to say
it all. Actually, the smooth puree
of oyster and spinach merits one
more adjective — good!
Unleavened sesame crackers
were also served with the soup
and salad. Light and unobtru
sive, they were a pleasant
(though easily addicting) com
plement.

Next in line were warm
scented towels, chilled wine glas
ses, a bottle of Wente Brothers
Chenin Blanc and David, ready
to take our order. Unlike many
restaurants where a heavy first
course diminishes the enjoyment
of the main entree, the success of
our earlier selections led us to
anticipate what was still to come.
We ordered the Indonesian
Lamb Roast, the Seafood Clus
ter (not listed on the menu),
Chinese Asparagus, artichokes
stuffed with spinach and hollan
daise sauce (also not on the
menu), and Chinese peapods
with water chestnuts. Within 10
to 15 minutes our meal was be
fore us, being heated and pre
pared on a cart brought directly
to our table. Each dish was di
vided and arranged in almost
photographic perfection.
Blended together in a simple
white wine and herb sauce, sec
tions of cracked crab, scampi,
and prawns competed for atten
tion in the Seafood Cluster.
Needless to say, they all came
out winners.
Fresh from the garden and
ambrosia to the palate, each of
the vegetables was a blue prize
winner. In all cases, taste
matched appearance. The as

paragus was cut in thin slices and
crisply finished in butter so as to
capitalize on its bright color. Ihe
peapods were prepared in a simi
lar manner and not met with
equally successful results.
Nevertheless, the spinach
stuffed artichokes were the
clearest example of the imagina
tive cookery of the Trader Vic
chefs. Intricately sauced and
spiced, the artichokes were an
enjoyable difference.
The end of our meal was as
perfect as the beginning and as
satisfying as the middle. After
one more round of steamed to
wels and one last sip of wine, we
began our last round. Long
stemmed strawberries served on
a bed of ice with sour cream and
brown sugar, rich rum ice cream
drizzled with praline syrup, and
mugs of Kafe-La'te defy descrip
tion. Let us just say that they
were an appropriate finale to one
of the finest meals I have ever
enjoyed.
Before leaving, David es
corted us on a tour of the kitchen
and banquet facilities; also in
cluded was the well-known Cap
tain's Cabin where the rich, fam
ous, and the not-so-famous
come to be seen.
The cuisine, atmosphere, and
clientele. Trader Vic's claims its
own. Though tabs are quick to
soar, I suggest that for the even
ing you let it claim you.

the ceiling, and carv ed masks de
corate each of the three main di
ning rooms. The world of a South
Sea isle beckons the moment you
walk in the door.
We were escorted to our table
by David Gibson, our captain for
the evening. The room is ar
ranged to accomodate a
maximum number of people in a
minimum amount of space. For
tunately for the customers, dark
colors, soft amber lighting and an
efficient entourage of waiters
and busboys help to compensate
for an atmosphere that might
otherwise be crowded and noisy.
The menu is awesome. De
scriptions of Chinese country
cooking, Calcutta curries, and

Oysters Florentine tease imagi
nation and palate both. Almost
discouraged by the range of our
selection, we decided to place
our order in the hands of our cap
tain. If this is your first visit to
Trader Vic's, we suggest that you
might want to do the same.
At David's recommendation,
we began with the Cosmos Tid
bits, a delightful array of sea
food. pork and cheese appetiz
ers. The three old favorites, fried
shrimp, barbequed spareribs and
eggroll, were superb; especially
the eggroll, whose flaky pastry
wrapper was really exceptional.
And yet the two new features.
Crab Rangoons and Cheese
Bings, were even better. The

rangoons consisted of a cream
and crab mixture dipped and
fried in a sweet wonton batter
and made a nice variation of the
traditional Chinese snack. The
Cheese Bings, warm and tangy
bundles of three different kinds
of cheeses, were one more treat.
Again relying on the advice of
our captain, we ordered the
Cosmos Salad Marie and Bongo
Bongo Soup. As the names
suggest, both dishes are house
specialties.
The salad is a fantastic combi
nation of mushroom, celery, and
artichoke slices in Trader Vic's
own musturd dressing, a dressing
which enhances without ever
drowning the central ingre
dients. Taste, texture and the
thought of eating all "those heal
thy things" made this vegetable
medley agreeable to both body
and soul.
Bongo Bongo Soup — some
how the name alone seems to say
it all. Actually, the smooth puree
of oyster and spinach merits one
more adjective — good!
Unleavened sesame crackers
were also served with the soup
and salad. Light and unobtru
sive, they were a pleasant
(though easily addicting) com
plement.

Next in line were warm
scented towels, chilled wine glas
ses, a bottle of Wente Brothers
Chenin Blanc and David, ready
to take our order. Unlike many
restaurants where a heavy first
course diminishes the enjoyment
of the main entree, the success of
our earlier selections led us to
anticipate what was still to come.
We ordered the Indonesian
Lamb Roast, the Seafood Clus
ter (not listed on the menu),
Chinese Asparagus, artichokes
stuffed with spinach and hollan
daise sauce (also not on the
menu), and Chinese peapods
with water chestnuts. Within 10
to 15 minutes our meal was be
fore us, being heated and pre
pared on a cart brought directly
to our table. Each dish was di
vided and arranged in almost
photographic perfection.
Blended together in a simple
white wine and herb sauce, sec
tions of cracked crab, scampi,
and prawns competed for atten
tion in the Seafood Cluster.
Needless to say, they all came
out winners.
Fresh from the garden and
ambrosia to the palate, each of
the vegetables was a blue prize
winner. In all cases, taste
matched appearance. The as

paragus was cut in thin slices and
crisply finished in butter so as to
capitalize on its bright color. Ihe
peapods were prepared in a simi
lar manner and not met with
equally successful results.
Nevertheless, the spinach
stuffed artichokes were the
clearest example of the imagina
tive cookery of the Trader Vic
chefs. Intricately sauced and
spiced, the artichokes were an
enjoyable difference.
The end of our meal was as
perfect as the beginning and as
satisfying as the middle. After
one more round of steamed to
wels and one last sip of wine, we
began our last round. Long
stemmed strawberries served on
a bed of ice with sour cream and
brown sugar, rich rum ice cream
drizzled with praline syrup, and
mugs of Kafe-La'te defy descrip
tion. Let us just say that they
were an appropriate finale to one
of the finest meals I have ever
enjoyed.
Before leaving, David es
corted us on a tour of the kitchen
and banquet facilities; also in
cluded was the well-known Cap
tain's Cabin where the rich, fam
ous, and the not-so-famous
come to be seen.
The cuisine, atmosphere, and
clientele. Trader Vic's claims its
own. Though tabs are quick to
soar, I suggest that for the even
ing you let it claim you.

Trader Vic's has been a part of
the San Francisco scene for so
long that we tend to take it for
granted. But pleasure and en
joyment continue to be a part of
this elegant dining experience.
During the 1930'5, Victor
Bergeron established the first
Trader Vic's in Oakland. Today,
less than 50 years later, there are

19 different Trader Vic's located
throughout the United States,
Europe and Canada. The San
Francisco reslaurant, now run by
Bergerson's son, Lynn, is the
crown jewel of the entire opera
tion. With a personality all its
own. this Trader Vic's is as color
ful as the people and the city it
serves.
No other restaurant com
mands the same unique Polyne
sian flair. The walls and roof are
"Thatched", fishing nets and
glass floats are suspended from
