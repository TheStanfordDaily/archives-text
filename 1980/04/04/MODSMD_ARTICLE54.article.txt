The Deer Hunter ★★★
Sunday, 6:30 & 9:45 p.m.
A very rough draft — it badly
needs editing and occasionally is
confusing or contradictory or both.
But it's also among the best war
movies ever made. Very little of the
"tell 'em I died for Betty" bullshit
that John Wayne types keep croak
ing on the shores of Iwo Jima; the
movie puts you face to face with the
horror of the thing.
The actors rise above the
scriptwriters' occasional overuse of
"realistic" redundancies — they
make sure that we hardly ever
notice. In the picture's central per
formance, Robert De Niro is
starkly individualistic in much the
same way that he has been starkly
individualistic in practically every
thing else he's made — and occa
sionally he restores the movie when
things get out of shape. And The
Deer Hunter is more than a little
misshapen — sometimes unbeliev
ably wrong — but there is a mas
terpiece buried in there some
where, and it more than repays an
attempt at excavation.
— John Nielsen
American Gigolo if
Tivoii Twin, San Carlos
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing the
style of Gere's sterile naughtiness
that he doesn't have much time to
provide any insight. The sexual
kinkiness here doesn't even begin
to shock — it's probably all authen
tic. but Schrader makes the audi
ence feel more like peeping Tom's
than vital participants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing, Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then in
a sudden rush of images. Schader
lets Gere off the hook.
It looks like Gigolo's going to
make Gere a sex symbol; that's a
little surprising, since the sexiness
developed around Gere is of the
decidedly limp variety — you can't
even enjoy being a peeping Tom
with a director like Schrader. With
a surprisingly competent Lauren
Hutton as the one woman Gere
seems to love.

Hide in Plain Sight ★★
Century 24, San Jose
The ads for this often interesting
little movie seem to hint that it's
just another of the Buford Pusser
style vigiante rip-offs, but James
Caan, in his debut as a director,
manages to avoid many of the
Walking Tall traps. The movie does
share the self-righteousness of such
movies, but Caan is a low-key di
rector, and he gets such subtle per
formances from his cast that the
movie develops a warmth that's to
tally alien to most vigilante pic
tures. Technically, the movie is un
even (particularly in its lighting and
editing), but that shouldn't scare
you off; the movie is a nice attempt
that'll be forgotten too soon.

Star Trek "kit
Century 22, San Jose
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from the world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A mechan
ical creation of man comes back to
haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
of the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilisation by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex — is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner,
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest of the movie is
like a greatest hits of Douglas
Trumbull and John Dykstra's pre
vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.

10 ★★★
Century 21, San Jose
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for lack
of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid-life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter,
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
bumbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek, that is. This poster-star just
may have found her "niche" as the
vacuous "10" the title refers to.
— R.L.

Electric Horseman ★ ★★
Park, Menlo Park
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this

Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $12-million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially

Redford's, are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direcion is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable

movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
— R.L.
1941 ★★★
Century 21, San Jose
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front — bodies fly all too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical! frenzied comedic action may
be horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, 1 like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi, and Dan Aykroyd.Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he •tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater
— R.L
All Thai Jazz ★ ★★
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind ol self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himsell is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
dcon, the Fosse character played
by. Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta

lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All I'lkii Jazz- It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Posse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the start
with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anyway.
— R.L.

Kramer vs. Kramer
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart.
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too near for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie ol surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

A fantastic movie, but don't
bother going to see it unless you
plan to think about it and not just
bask in its glow. Artful black

bines with new directing skills and a
freshattitudetoward filmmaking to
prov ide a sensitive portrayal of the

Dakota in 1915 and 1916. Un
wooden but non-professional ac

slow-moving winner of the Cannes
Golden Camera award for the best

human characterizations and poig
nant plot. A thinking person's
movie.

Harold and Maude ★★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Harold is u young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashby (Shampoo,
Comitiy, Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals are played bv Bud Cort
and Ruth Gordon. j IVj
Chapter Two ★★
Menlo Cinema, IVlenlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, they marry, they have
problems, the> resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But. like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one
liners and even a moment here or
there that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-good self.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles hut the movie's worth
a free night (if any of us ever had
one). A good one for Mom and
Dad.
