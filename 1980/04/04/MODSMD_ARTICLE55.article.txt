Committee proposes new budget
WASHINGTON — The Senate Budget Commit
tee approved a balanced 1981 budget yesterday that
calls for steep increases in defense spending, sharp
cuts in domestic programs and a $10.1 billion surplus.
On an 11 -7 vote, the panel set total 1981 spending
at $612.9 billion. $1.4 billion more than President
Jimmy Carter proposed Monday in his revised budget
for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1.
The committee's spending priorities differed shar
ply from the president's and from those outlined last
month in the House Budget Committee's spending
plan.
The Senate Budget Committee approved defense
spending that exceeds Carter's $ 150.5 billion prop
osal by more than $5 billion, slashing a wide variety of
domestic programs to cover the cost.
The panel's domestic cuts include an end to Satur
day mail delivery, the phasing out of a major public
service jobs program, a $1 billion reduction in the
food stamp program and elimination of some Social
Security benefits.
The committee's $10.1 billion surplus consists al
most entirely of the $10 billion expected from Car
ter's oil import fee. which will increase the cost of
gasoline 10 cents a gallon.
The president has said he would not use import fee
revenues to balance his 1981 spending plan. How
ever. estimates by the Congressional Budget Office
suggest Carter's revised budget will need some of that
money to be in balance.
Still, the president, the House and the Senate all
are pursuing the same goal in their spending plans for
the next fiscal year — the nation's first balanced
budget in 12 years.
Gas cloud rises over train crash
SOMERVILLE. Mass. — An estimated 10.000
people fled their suburban homes yesterday after a
locomotive sideswiped a chemical tank car in a rail
yard three miles from downtown Boston, releasing
clouds of acid that sent at least 120 people to the
hospital.
TTie clouds of hydrochloric and phosphoric acid
forced the closing of a section of Interstate 93 and of
area businesses and schools.
The chemical, phosphorus trichloride, was in liquid
form in the tank car, but vaporized into the acids
when it mixed with air and moisture.
The acid clouds also wafted high over Boston, but
officials said there was no immediate threat to the
city. However, several office buildings shut down
their air-circulation systems as a precaution.
By evening. 97 people were treated at Somerville
Hospital, including one possible heart attack victim.
Twenty-three others were taken to Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston and at least 10 were
admitted.
Massachusetts General spokesman Martin Bander
said most of the emergency cases were given oxygen,
showers and a variety of tests. He said the gas can
cause irritation of the eyes and lungs. A large dose
can cause possible liver and kidney damage.
New York strike talks stall
NEW YORK — New Yorkers settled in for a long
walk yesterday after the two sides in the bus and
subway labor dispute met briefly and found them
selves further apart than when the strike began four
days ago.
While the first tentative effort to settle the strike by
35,000 transit employees was fruitless, the Long Is
land Rail Road started running from Manhattan out
to the Long Island suburbs after a separate two-day
strike. But there were threats the walkout might re
sume next week.
Commuters who were stranded in the city bv the

LIRR strike packed Penn Station during the evening
rush hour, forcing officials to intermittently close the
terminal's outer doors to control the crowds. Rush
hour traffic was reported lighter than on Wednesday
when there were brief but extensive tie-ups at bridges
and tunnels connecting Manhattan with Brooklyn,
Queens and New Jersey.
Mediators in the bus and subway strike said both
sides had hardened their positions, and a union leader
said "strike fever" was rife in his ranks.
City officials estimate that 500,000 people have
moved into Manhattan to be closer to their jobs since
the strike began. The number of automobiles coming
into the city doubled to more than 400,000 this week,
while an estimated 200,000 commuters took to riding
bicycles. The number arriving by boat and ferry has
tripled.
Internal tension mounts in Israel
JERUSALEM — Israel detained a leading Pales
tinian activist for questioning yesterday and Israeli
rightists mounted pressure on Prime Minister
Menachem Begin to refuse to make concessions in
summit talks with President Jimmy Carter this
month.
In continuing efforts to quell the wave of unrest in
the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River, Israeli
authorities called Dr. Ahmed Hamzi Natshe to the
military police headquarters in Bethlehem after he
allegedly made an anti-Israeli speech at a Palestinian
rally in the West Bank town of Hebron on Wednes
day.
Natshe, a leading West Bank communist, was
exiled in 1976 for anti-Israeli activities, and was
readmitted in 1978 on condition that he stay out of
politics. Military sources said there were no plans to
exile him again.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, demonstrators from the
rightwing Gush Emunim. or "bloc of the faithful"
movement, gathered at the government press head
quarters to call on Begin to cancel his summit talks
with Carter on Palestinian autonomy. Israel radio
estimated the number of demonstrators at about
2000.
Lance acquitted of conspiracy
ATLANTA — A U.S. District Court judge yester
day said he would order former federal budget direc
tor Bert Lance and three codefendants acquitted of
criminal conspiracy charges.
The decision by Judge Charles Moye came during
the 12th week of Lance's bank fraud trial just as the
government was preparing to rest its case.
Lance and the others still face 32 criminal counts of
falsifying bank records, misapplying bank funds and
filing false financial statements to get loans.
In announcing his decision, Moye said: "I don't
believe evidence would support the finding of a
generalized conspiracy."
The judge told prosecutors that he would listen to
any further evidence of a conspiracy before the gov
ernment rests its case, probably in about two days.
But Moye added that he didn't "foresee" that the
government could come up with any convincing evi
dence.
Late last night, the chief prosecutor said the gov
ernment would not further argue the conspiracy
count.
Lance and three fellow north Georgia businessmen
were accused of engaging in a scheme over 10 years
that resulted in $20 million in loans to the defendants,
their families and friends.
Volcano nearing lava eruption
VANCOUVER. Wash. — Unusual rhythmic tre
mors shook Mount St. Helens and the volcano spat
bigger plumes of gas and ash into the sky yesterday.

convincing scientists that a lava eruption is likely.
"We do know the magma (molten material) is mov
ing" beneath the volcano, geophysicist Bob Christ
iansen of the U.S. Geological Survey told reporters.
"The harmonic tremor (recorded late Wednesday)
makes it seem likely we will go to a magmatic erup
tion.
"We've always said that was a likely possibility. It
seems even more likely now, although not necessarily
today or tomorrow. 11 could be a week or a period of
weeks or more."
He said scientists can't tell exactly where the hot,
molten rock is in the 9677-foot mountain, which
began erupting on March 27 after 123 years of quiet.
University of Washington scientists estimate the lava
could be about three miles below sea level.
Such an eruption would not have to be a "large
high eruption column" throwing molten lava into the
air, he said.
The few people who live in the immediate vicinity
of the mountain were evacuated when it began blow
ing gas and ash into the air and threatening to shake
loose avalanches.
Poison pickle suspect arrested
LOS ANGELES — A 46-year-old Riverside
County man was arrested yesterday by FBI agents
after an investigation of the so-called poison pickle
case in the San Diego area.
Richard Ouincy Williams was scheduled to appear
before a federal magistrate today for arraignment on
a charge of interference with commerce by threats or
violence.
Williams was acquitted of poisoning food in a Sun
City Safeway store last May.
The FBI said Williams allegedly tried to extort
diamonds and money from a La Jolla Safeway
supermarket, where a bottle of dill pickles laced with
cyanide was found with an extortion note attached.
Authorities also connected Williams with the dis
covery of a bottle of teriyaki sauce found spiked with
the poison in a Pacific Beach Safeway store. He also
allegedly attempted to extort "other property" from
a La Jolla jewelry store, the FBI said.
