# Former U.S. ambassador to Moscow
## Soviets regard detente as tool, says Toon 
### Pat Carroll Staff Writer 
Malcolm Toon, former American
ambassador to the Soviet Union, gave
what he termed a "grim assessment" of
Soviet policy in a speech at Kresge Au
ditorium Wednesday night.
Toon said that the United States
must recognize that the Soviets are
"dedicated to a system that is hostile to
everything we stand for."
"The Soviets regard detente, not as a
political mechanism to get along, but as
a device for reshaping the world with
out nuclear war," he said. Toon added
that the Soviets will continue to extend
their power to oppress Third World
countries if given the opportunity.
Increasing contempt for the U.S. is
the trend in Moscow's thinking, Toon
said. Saying that the Soviets perceive
American foreign policy as weak, Toon
advised that when dealing with the
Soviet Union, the U.S. must:
— recognize that the U.S. has no
common interests with the Soviet
Union or China;
— not attempt to carry out a

"chummy" diplomatic policy;
— recognize that the U.S. will al
ways have an antagonistic relationship
with the Soviets;

— not engage in idle threats or at
tempt to bluff the Soviets.

Toon also called for a "bolstering of
the military presence in the Persian
Gulf area with sizable combat units,"
adding that "the Soviets will pay atten
tion, not to what we say, but to what we
do."
Toon called the Soviet attitude to
ward Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
(SALT) negotiations "cynical," and said
that the U.S. should adopt the same
attitude. He said that the U.S. should
not promote arms control "for the sake
of advancing agreements" and called
for treaties which would be "useful to
us and our allies."
"If it (arms control) advances the na
tional interest, let's go for it,"he said.
"We have to recognize that the Soviets
aren't going to give us anything and we
shouldn't give them anything either."
Under fire
Toon was harshly criticized shortly
before he retired last October when he
delayed giving his sanction to the prop
osed SALT II treaty, already under
negotiation by President Carter and
Soviet Premier Leonid Breznev. Al
though he later endorsed the treaty.

Toon insisted that the treaty "must be
verifiable" and that Soviet-American
diplomacy regarding the arms race
"cannot rely on trust."
He denied that his retirement was a
result of any pressure applied by the
Carter Administration. He said that
"personal finances, a committment to
my wife, and a desire to provide brea
thing space for a younger diplomat"
prompted him to offer his resignaton to
Carter.
He criticized the Carter administra
tion's handling of the hostage situation
in Iran, saying that the U.S. should not
have reduced its options.
Crafty
"We should never have said we will
not return the shah. Of course, we
wouldn't have returned him. That is
counter to everything we stand for, hut
we shouldn't have said so.
"We should have said, 'We're not
going to discuss returning the shah until
you return the hostages.You don't
toss options away. That's the problem
with this (Carter) administration. They
