# Former U.S. ambassador to Moscow
## Soviets regard detente as tool, says Toon 
### Pat Carroll Staff Writer 
Malcolm Toon, former American
ambassador to the Soviet Union, gave
what he termed a "grim assessment" of
Soviet policy in a speech at Kresge Au
ditorium Wednesday night.
Toon said that the United States
must recognize that the Soviets are
"dedicated to a system that is hostile to
everything we stand for."
"The Soviets regard detente, not as a
political mechanism to get along, but as
a device for reshaping the world with
out nuclear war," he said. Toon added
that the Soviets will continue to extend
their power to oppress Third World
countries if given the opportunity.
Increasing contempt for the U.S. is
the trend in Moscow's thinking, Toon
said. Saying that the Soviets perceive
American foreign policy as weak, Toon
advised that when dealing with the
Soviet Union, the U.S. must:
— recognize that the U.S. has no
common interests with the Soviet
Union or China;
— not attempt to carry out a

"chummy" diplomatic policy;
— recognize that the U.S. will al
ways have an antagonistic relationship
with the Soviets;

— not engage in idle threats or at
tempt to bluff the Soviets.

Toon also called for a "bolstering of
the military presence in the Persian
Gulf area with sizable combat units,"
adding that "the Soviets will pay atten
tion, not to what we say, but to what we
do."
Toon called the Soviet attitude to
ward Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
(SALT) negotiations "cynical," and said
that the U.S. should adopt the same
attitude. He said that the U.S. should
not promote arms control "for the sake
of advancing agreements" and called
for treaties which would be "useful to
us and our allies."
"If it (arms control) advances the na
tional interest, let's go for it,"he said.
"We have to recognize that the Soviets
aren't going to give us anything and we
shouldn't give them anything either."
Under fire
Toon was harshly criticized shortly
before he retired last October when he
delayed giving his sanction to the prop
osed SALT II treaty, already under
negotiation by President Carter and
Soviet Premier Leonid Breznev. Al
though he later endorsed the treaty.

Toon insisted that the treaty "must be
verifiable" and that Soviet-American
diplomacy regarding the arms race
"cannot rely on trust."
He denied that his retirement was a
result of any pressure applied by the
Carter Administration. He said that
"personal finances, a committment to
my wife, and a desire to provide brea
thing space for a younger diplomat"
prompted him to offer his resignaton to
Carter.
He criticized the Carter administra
tion's handling of the hostage situation
in Iran, saying that the U.S. should not
have reduced its options.

"We should never have said we will
not return the shah. Of course, we
wouldn't have returned him. That is
counter to everything we stand for, hut
we shouldn't have said so.
"We should have said, 'We're not
going to discuss returning the shah until
you return the hostages.You don't
toss options away. That's the problem
with this (Carter) administration. They

didn't learn much about foreign policy
in Georgia, and in all respect, I don't
think they've learned much in
Washington," said Toon.
He said that the U.S. must "think
carefully about its priorities around the
world," particularly the Persian Gulf
area, the NATO complex, the Western
hemisphere and Japan.
Need for clarity
"It's high time to define clearly just
where our vital interests are so there
will be no misunderstanding on the
other side as to how far they can go,"
said Toon.
With regard to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, Toon said that no action
on the part of the U.S. is called for,
since there are no U.S. interests there.
He said that the Soviets, "consistent
with their behavior, would not with
draw from a position of strength." He
said that the Soviet withdrawal from
Iran in 1946 was brought about "only
because we had a nuclear monopoly."

Toon views the Olympic boycott as
"grievous for American athletes," but
urges them to "look, not as athletes,
but as Americans" at the U.S. refusal
to participate in the Moscow games. He
said that the Soviets have invested mas
sive resources in the Olympics and that
a boycott would "deal an economic
blow to the Soviets that would bring
home the message that they are to be
held accountable for their actions."
Toon said that he supports the Car
ter Administration's attempt to
reinstate registration for the draft, and
was "very unhappy to see conscription
go down the drain." He said that in
Israel "conscription is the order of the
day,"and that it "promotes a feeling of
participation lacking in this country."
Toon has served as an American dip
lomat for three decades. He was the
U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union
under the Ford and Carter administra
tions and has served as ambassador to
Israel, Czechoslavakia, and Yugoslavia
in previous administrations.

ways have an antagonistic relationship
with the Soviets;

— not engage in idle threats or at
tempt to bluff the Soviets.

Toon also called for a "bolstering of
the military presence in the Persian
Gulf area with sizable combat units,"
adding that "the Soviets will pay atten
tion, not to what we say, but to what we
do."
Toon called the Soviet attitude to
ward Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty
(SALT) negotiations "cynical," and said
that the U.S. should adopt the same
attitude. He said that the U.S. should
not promote arms control "for the sake
of advancing agreements" and called
for treaties which would be "useful to
us and our allies."
"If it (arms control) advances the na
tional interest, let's go for it,"he said.
"We have to recognize that the Soviets
aren't going to give us anything and we
shouldn't give them anything either."
Under fire
Toon was harshly criticized shortly
before he retired last October when he
delayed giving his sanction to the prop
osed SALT II treaty, already under
negotiation by President Carter and
Soviet Premier Leonid Breznev. Al
though he later endorsed the treaty.

Toon insisted that the treaty "must be
verifiable" and that Soviet-American
diplomacy regarding the arms race
"cannot rely on trust."
He denied that his retirement was a
result of any pressure applied by the
Carter Administration. He said that
"personal finances, a committment to
my wife, and a desire to provide brea
thing space for a younger diplomat"
prompted him to offer his resignaton to
Carter.
He criticized the Carter administra
tion's handling of the hostage situation
in Iran, saying that the U.S. should not
have reduced its options.

"We should never have said we will
not return the shah. Of course, we
wouldn't have returned him. That is
counter to everything we stand for, hut
we shouldn't have said so.

going to discuss returning the shah until
you return the hostages.You don't

didn't learn much about foreign policy
in Georgia, and in all respect, I don't
think they've learned much in
Washington," said Toon.
He said that the U.S. must "think
carefully about its priorities around the
world," particularly the Persian Gulf
area, the NATO complex, the Western
hemisphere and Japan.
Need for clarity
"It's high time to define clearly just
where our vital interests are so there
will be no misunderstanding on the
other side as to how far they can go,"
said Toon.
With regard to the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan, Toon said that no action
on the part of the U.S. is called for,
since there are no U.S. interests there.
He said that the Soviets, "consistent
with their behavior, would not with
draw from a position of strength." He
said that the Soviet withdrawal from
Iran in 1946 was brought about "only
because we had a nuclear monopoly."

Toon views the Olympic boycott as
"grievous for American athletes," but
urges them to "look, not as athletes,
but as Americans" at the U.S. refusal
to participate in the Moscow games. He
said that the Soviets have invested mas
sive resources in the Olympics and that
a boycott would "deal an economic
blow to the Soviets that would bring
home the message that they are to be
held accountable for their actions."
Toon said that he supports the Car
ter Administration's attempt to
reinstate registration for the draft, and
was "very unhappy to see conscription
go down the drain." He said that in
Israel "conscription is the order of the
day,"and that it "promotes a feeling of
participation lacking in this country."
Toon has served as an American dip
lomat for three decades. He was the
U.S. ambassador to the Soviet Union
under the Ford and Carter administra
tions and has served as ambassador to
Israel, Czechoslavakia, and Yugoslavia
in previous administrations.
Malcolm Toon, former American
ambassador to the Soviet Union, gave
what he termed a "grim assessment" of
Soviet policy in a speech at Kresge Au
ditorium Wednesday night.
Toon said that the United States
must recognize that the Soviets are
"dedicated to a system that is hostile to
everything we stand for."
"The Soviets regard detente, not as a
political mechanism to get along, but as
a device for reshaping the world with
out nuclear war," he said. Toon added
that the Soviets will continue to extend
their power to oppress Third World
countries if given the opportunity.
Increasing contempt for the U.S. is
the trend in Moscow's thinking, Toon
said. Saying that the Soviets perceive
American foreign policy as weak, Toon
advised that when dealing with the
Soviet Union, the U.S. must:
— recognize that the U.S. has no
common interests with the Soviet
Union or China;
— not attempt to carry out a

"chummy" diplomatic policy;
— recognize that the U.S. will al
ways have an antagonistic relationship
with the Soviets;

— not engage in idle threats or at
tempt to bluff the Soviets.
