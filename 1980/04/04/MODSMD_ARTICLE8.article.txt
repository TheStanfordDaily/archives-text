# Retirement policy petition rejected

### Nancy Koehn Staff Writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday re
jected a petition signed by more than
230 faculty members to establish an ad
hoc faculty committee charged with
making recommendations on Univer
sity faculty retirement policy.
Circulated last month by the Execu
tive Committee of the local chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP), the petition,
in the form of a Senate motion, rep
resented an alternative to University
Provost Donald Kennedy's previous
request for the establishment of a spe
cial faculty task force charged with
formulating retirement policy recom
mendations.
On Jan. 25 of this year, Kennedy
sent an order to the Senate Committee
on Committees and asked for sugges
tions for faculty members to serve on
the special task force.

The cause of recent controversy
among faculty members here. Univer
sity faculty retirement policies came
under criticism last May when Univer
sity President Richard Lyman an
nounced that faculty reaching the age 65
between then and July 1, 1982 would
have the option of continuing to work
at the University on a half-time basis.
On May 24, Lyman announced that the
University supported state legislative
proposals to institute a mandatory re
tirement age of 70, the limit established
by federal law.
Currently law, California's mandat
ory retirement age of 70 does not apply
to non-faculty members at private uni
versities and colleges.
Miserable
Criticizing their prospective pen
sions as "truly miserable," 46 faculty
members urged the University presi
dent in late May to allow full-time
employment and University pension
contributions past age 65. In June,

Lyman accepted most of the recom
mendations from an administrative
panel on retirement, chaired by former
Provost William F. Miller, with the ex
ception of the half-time retirement op
tion.
The faculty petition for an ad hoc
committee came in response to a
suggestion by the administrative panel
that a study of long-term problems
concerning retirement and tenure be
undertaken.
Roth
Presented by Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Bernard Roth, the motion
proposes that the ad hoc committee's
report be "debated and voted upon by
the Senate and that any recommenda
tions so approved be forwarded to the
appropriate administrative officers."
Roth criticized the results of a task
force study such as that advocated by
Kennedy, saying, "1 find an unsatisfac
tory mechanism in these courtesv re
