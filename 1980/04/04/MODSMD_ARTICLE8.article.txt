# Retirement policy petition rejected
## 
### Nancy Koehn Staff Writer 
The Faculty Senate yesterday re
jected a petition signed by more than
230 faculty members to establish an ad
hoc faculty committee charged with
making recommendations on Univer
sity faculty retirement policy.
Circulated last month by the Execu
tive Committee of the local chapter of
the American Association of Univer
sity Professors (AAUP), the petition,
in the form of a Senate motion, rep
resented an alternative to University
Provost Donald Kennedy's previous
request for the establishment of a spe
cial faculty task force charged with
formulating retirement policy recom
mendations.
On Jan. 25 of this year, Kennedy
sent an order to the Senate Committee
on Committees and asked for sugges
tions for faculty members to serve on
the special task force.

The cause of recent controversy
among faculty members here. Univer
sity faculty retirement policies came
under criticism last May when Univer
sity President Richard Lyman an
nounced that faculty reaching the age 65
between then and July 1, 1982 would
have the option of continuing to work
at the University on a half-time basis.
On May 24, Lyman announced that the
University supported state legislative
proposals to institute a mandatory re
tirement age of 70, the limit established
by federal law.
Currently law, California's mandat
ory retirement age of 70 does not apply
to non-faculty members at private uni
versities and colleges.
Miserable
Criticizing their prospective pen
sions as "truly miserable," 46 faculty
members urged the University presi
dent in late May to allow full-time
employment and University pension
contributions past age 65. In June,

Lyman accepted most of the recom
mendations from an administrative
panel on retirement, chaired by former
Provost William F. Miller, with the ex
ception of the half-time retirement op
tion.
The faculty petition for an ad hoc
committee came in response to a
suggestion by the administrative panel
that a study of long-term problems
concerning retirement and tenure be
undertaken.
Roth
Presented by Mechanical Engineer
ing Prof. Bernard Roth, the motion
proposes that the ad hoc committee's
report be "debated and voted upon by
the Senate and that any recommenda
tions so approved be forwarded to the
appropriate administrative officers."
Roth criticized the results of a task
force study such as that advocated by
Kennedy, saying, "1 find an unsatisfac
tory mechanism in these courtesv re
ports. Debate before the Senate is
much more helpful."
As chief spokesman for the petition's
opposition, Kennedy questioned the
necessity for an ad hoc committee. Ac
cording to Kennedy, whether the Se
nate establishes an ad hoc committee
or a task force "makes no difference
except that it is right on constitutional
grounds to vote the petition down,
leaving the Committee on Committees,
the proper constitutional authority, to
maintain authority."
The Faculty Senate constitution
states that standing and ad hoc commit
tees be created and dissolved on re
commendation by the Committee on
Committees.
Lyman opposed the petition on the
grounds that "a faculty body cannot
make final resource allocation deci
sions and these are the kinds of issues
we are talking about with retirement
policy."
In other business, the approximately
45 Senate members present heard Vice

Provost Gerald Lieberman's report on
Affirmative Action in Academic Staff
Research. According to this report,
. academic staff research has undergone
Vew changes in staff as a result of Uni
versity affirmative action programs.
Lieberman's report noted that from
the fall of 1975 to January 1, 1980,
there has been a 25 percent increase in
the number of non-minority women, a
33 percent increase in ethnic minorities
and a two percent drop in the number
of non-minority men serving in
academic staff research positions.
Calling the percentage of minorities
in academic staff-research positions
"deplorable," Prof, of Anthropology
James Gibbs proposed an annual inves
tigation by Lieberman of academic
staff-research affirmative action re
sults. The Senate unanimously ap
proved this annual study.
The Senate also unanimously ap
proved a recommendation for a five
year renewal of the major in African
and Afro-American Studies.
