## Bhutto's ideas live after his execution 
### Stuart Auerbach The Washington Post 
NEW DELHI — Former
Pakistan Prime Minister Zul
fikar Ali Bhutto, executed one
year ago today, remains as
much a thorn in the side of the
martial law regime of Moham
mad Zia ul-Haq today as he was
while he was still alive.
He has become a true martyr,
defined in death by people who
have forgotten how he manipu
lated the political system and
mismanaged the economy — br
inging about many of the prob
lems that Pakistan now faces.
As a result, according to dip
lomats here and in Pakistan as
well as Pakistanis interviewed
over the past month. Bhutto's
supporters form the most potent
civilian political force in the
country despite Zia's 5V2-
month-old ban on political activ
ity.
Bhutto's widow. Begum Nus
rat Bhutto, and his daughter,
Benazir, have been given court
permission over the objection of
local authorities to pay a night
time anniversary visit to the
gravesite near the family home
of Lakarna.
The military government said
they feared mass demonstrations
w hen the widow and daughter vi
sited the gravesite.
Officials of the Pakistan
People's Party. Bhutto's political
party, have threatened to mass
10.000 persons in Lakarna Fri
day for the anniversary. Accord
ing to reports reaching here, the
isolated central Pakistan village,
about a six-hour drive from the
seaport of Karachi, resembles an
armed camp full of army and
security officials determined to
tamp down any demonstrations.
Most observers — Pakistani as
well as diplomats — do not ex
pect any mass demonstration for
the anniversary.
Nonetheless, the force of
Bhutto still predominates in
Pakistani politics.
Many observers believe his
execution —after a trial, convic
tion and lengthy appeals on
charges of conspiring to kill a
political enemy — changed the
ground rules of Pakistani poli
tics.
Never before had a leader
ousted in a coup as Bhutto was
ever been made to face charges
or been executed. Previously,
changes in government, even
sudden ones, had been gentle
manly affairs, with the ousted
leader allowed to quietly live out
his days in comfort — albeit
without power.
After hanging Bhutto, many
observers believe that Zia must
cling to power to save his own
neck.
"His remaining in office is a
matter of personal survival now.
I do not believe he can step
down," said one experienced ob
server of Pakistani politics.
Another commented that Bhut
to's hanging probably raised the
premium on any life insurance
policy Zia might buy.
Bhutto's death has also com
plicated Pakistan's relations with
the oil-rich Arab nations that Zia
now counts on to bail his country
out of economic disaster and
build up its military force to face
the threat of Soviet troops on its
northwestern border with Af
ghanistan.
Bhutto was a favorite with the
Arab leaders, and Saudi
Arabia's King Khalid was one of
a vast number of world leaders,

including President Carter, to
send pleas to Zia for clemency
for Bhutto.
As a result the Saudi leaders
are reported to have cooled to
Zia and to have held back on
some promised aid.
Since Zia rejected American
military aid. he must depend on
the Saudis and his other Islamic
friends to come across with the
money to modernize his army's
outdated equipment.
That money is needed also to
keep his fellow generals happy.
For although the Pakistan
People's Party has shown itselt to
be the most powerful of the civi
lian political parties. Pakistanis
describe the army as the coun
try's only meaningful political
force.
The army too has a stake in
retaining power, analysts be
lieve. because if the party takes
over, most of the top military
leadership will be out of jobs.
Zia. then, appears to be spend
ing more and more time holding
power and less and less time run
ning the country.
"More than ever," said one
diplomat, "he seems to have no
formula for ruling. It's a day-to
day operation."
According to observers. Zia
has developed no personal fol
lowing in the 32 months since he
overthrew Bhutto. At national
day ceremonies last month, ac
cording to reports reaching here.
Zia received only perfunctory
applause.
The traditional political lead
ers all oppose him since his
technique has been to divorce
and weaken them.
While his emphasis on Isiami
zation of Pakistan is not as un
popular among the masses as
many Westerners think, it still
causes grumbling among the
educated classes. "If we wanted
a mullah." said one Pakistani,
"we could have hired him for
$50 a month. We didn't need to
make him president."
It is questionable, though,
whether the PPP could capitalize
on Bhutto's apparent popularity
— even if the army let it.
For Bhutto — a charismatic
but arrogant leader — always
kept the party as his personal in
strument and continually cut
down anyone he thought might
challenge him.
That iegacy, which may end up
being Bhutto's greatest disser
vice to Pakistan, prevents any ef
fective civilian challenge to the
army's rule.
