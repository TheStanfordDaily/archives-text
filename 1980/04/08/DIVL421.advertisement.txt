... LOGICON offers the opportunity. The kind you've spent all
those years in college to prepare yourself for. The kind a lot of
companies promise but don't deliver. The kind that will challenge
your utmost capabilities and imagination.
The opportunity is created by the exciting state-of-the-art nature
of our wide-ranging computer oriented services, coupled with
our personal, people oriented environment. This ideal comple
ment of high technology and individual recognition breaks the
old limits, and gives the aggressive graduate the chance to really
take part in the future of the world of systems and software.
With a continuing need for ENGINEERS, PROGRAMMERS,
TECHNICIANS and many more disciplines in even more spe- H â– 
cialties, Logicon has an eye for progress. Help us make it happen
... now!
A representative from Logicon will be on campus April 14.
