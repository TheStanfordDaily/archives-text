# Carter retaliates: cuts Iran trade; expels diplomats

From the Daily wire services
TEHRAN, Iran — The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
killed any further chance of transferring the U.S. Embassy
hostages to government control yesterday, and hardline
religious leaders who had urged his negative action ap
peared paradoxically pleased by President Jimmy Carter's
immediate retaliatory sanctions.
Carter broke diplomatic relations with Iran, gave Iranian
diplomats 24 hours to leave the United States and cut off
virtually all remaining trade between the two nations.
In a move designed to spur release of 50 Americans who
have been held hostage in Tehran since last Nov. 4, Carter
warned that "other actions may be necessary."
Carter, in an announcement broadcast live from the
White House press room, said his government has shown
"exceptional patience and restraint" in trying to resolve the
stalemate.
But he said the refusal of the Iranian government to
assume control of the hostages from the militants who have
held them for more than five months "lays full responsibil
ity" for the crisis on Iran's revolutionary leader Khomeini
and Iran's governing Revolutionary Council.
The all-powerful ayatollah's unequivocal rejection of
taking the hostages out of the hands of their militant captors
ended a week-long period of rising and falling hopes during
which President Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr and Foreign
Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh had sought to ease the
Iranian-American crisis.
But after meeting with Bani-Sadr, Ghotbzadeh and t\vo

other members of the ruling Revolutionary Council who
sought a final resolution of the issue, Khomeini had his
office announce that the hostages "will remain in the hands
of the Moslem and militant students" until "the determina
tion of their fate by the respected deputies (members of
Parliament) of the nation."
That means the hostages in the embassy, and probably
the three American diplomats in custody at the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, will see no change in their status until at
least mid-June, when the still-incompleteparliament is fully
elected, organized and ready to begin debating what to do
with them.
Carter's announcement of a complete break in diploma
tic relations and other sanctions, which came only hours
after Khomeini's uncompromising rejection of the transfer
plan, reached Tehran too late for formal government reac
tion.
Bani-Sadr could not be reached for comment.
Ghotbzadeh, who along with the president suffered a sting
ing defeat in Khomeini's veto of their plan to ease the crisis,
said only that "1 have no comment whatsoever, none what
soever."
But two senior religious figures who led the opposition to
the transfer plan and gained strength from the veto in their
running feud with Bani-Sadr and Ghotbzadeh, appeared
pleased by the sanctions.
Speaking in the arcane language of frequently perplexing
Iranian politics, the Ayatollah Mohamed Beheshti, secret
ary of the Revolutionary Council and leader of the predo

minant and hardline Islamic Republican Party, welcomed
Carter's move as helpful to Iran's thrust for independence
from the United States.
The students at the embassy, obviously pleased to have
Khomeini's backing in letting them keep the hostages, also
dismissed the effect of the Carter sanctions.
Looking grim, Carter listed four actions he is taking
against Iran:
— "The United States is breaking diplomatic relations
with Iran. Iranian diplomatic and consular personnel have
been declared persona non grata and must leave the country
by midnight tomorrow."
— Treasury Secretary G. William Miller will prohibit
virtually all exports from the United States to Iran. This will
virtually eliminate trade, even in food and medicine, which
were exempt from earlier sanctions Carter imposed.
— Miller will make an inventory of outstanding claims of
American citizens and corporations against the government
of Iran with the aim of seizing assets of the Iranian govern
ment in the United States to finance settlement of claims by
hostages and their families.
— All visas issued to Iranians for entry into the United
States have been declared invalid, effective immediately,
and no visas will be issued or renewed "except for compel
ling and proven humanitarian reasons or where the national
interest requires."
"The hostages and their families — indeed, all of us in
America — have lived with the reality and the anguish of
their captivity for five months," Carter said.

Several independent analysts here questioned the value
of the Carter sanctions for other reasons. One pointed out
that in the short term at least they strengthen Beheshti and
other opponents of Bani-Sadr and make future efforts at
moderation more difficult than ever for the new president
and his foreign minister, both of whom want to defuse the
U.S.-Iranian crisis.
Another analyst said that although they sound tough, the
Carter sanctions will have more publicity value than real
impact on Iran because diplomatic and economic relations
already are at a virtual standstill and have been since
November.
The only remaining glimmer of hope for an end to the
crisis appeared to rest in the hands of an ad hoc interna
tional commission of five intermediaries who had worked
unsuccessfully to convince the hardliners of the wisdom of
the proposed hostage transfer. Although the group gave
itself another 48 hours to try to take some of the heat out of
the conflict, one of its members said there was virtually no
hope of success.
The ad hoc mediators are Swiss Ambassador Erik Lang.
Archbishop Hilarion Capucci of the Roman Catholic
Church's Melkite rite, the papal nuncio to Tehran, Msgr.
Annibale Bugnini, Paris lawyer Christian Bourguet and an
Argentine. Hector Vilalon, who has been a conduit for
messages between the White House and Tehran.
"Sanctions or no sanctions, we will keep trying to find
points of compromise, areas of good will. We will keep the
door open," said one of the five.

TEHRAN, Iran — The Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
killed any further chance of transferring the U.S. Embassy
hostages to government control yesterday, and hardline
religious leaders who had urged his negative action ap
peared paradoxically pleased by President Jimmy Carter's
immediate retaliatory sanctions.
Carter broke diplomatic relations with Iran, gave Iranian
diplomats 24 hours to leave the United States and cut off
virtually all remaining trade between the two nations.
In a move designed to spur release of 50 Americans who
have been held hostage in Tehran since last Nov. 4, Carter
warned that "other actions may be necessary."
Carter, in an announcement broadcast live from the
White House press room, said his government has shown
"exceptional patience and restraint" in trying to resolve the
stalemate.
But he said the refusal of the Iranian government to
assume control of the hostages from the militants who have
held them for more than five months "lays full responsibil
ity" for the crisis on Iran's revolutionary leader Khomeini
and Iran's governing Revolutionary Council.
The all-powerful ayatollah's unequivocal rejection of
taking the hostages out of the hands of their militant captors
ended a week-long period of rising and falling hopes during
which President Abol-Hassan Bani-Sadr and Foreign
Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh had sought to ease the
Iranian-American crisis.
But after meeting with Bani-Sadr, Ghotbzadeh and t\vo

other members of the ruling Revolutionary Council who
sought a final resolution of the issue, Khomeini had his
office announce that the hostages "will remain in the hands
of the Moslem and militant students" until "the determina
tion of their fate by the respected deputies (members of
Parliament) of the nation."
That means the hostages in the embassy, and probably
the three American diplomats in custody at the Iranian
Foreign Ministry, will see no change in their status until at
least mid-June, when the still-incompleteparliament is fully
elected, organized and ready to begin debating what to do
with them.
Carter's announcement of a complete break in diploma
tic relations and other sanctions, which came only hours
after Khomeini's uncompromising rejection of the transfer
plan, reached Tehran too late for formal government reac
tion.
Bani-Sadr could not be reached for comment.
Ghotbzadeh, who along with the president suffered a sting
ing defeat in Khomeini's veto of their plan to ease the crisis,
said only that "1 have no comment whatsoever, none what
soever."
But two senior religious figures who led the opposition to
the transfer plan and gained strength from the veto in their
running feud with Bani-Sadr and Ghotbzadeh, appeared
pleased by the sanctions.
Speaking in the arcane language of frequently perplexing
Iranian politics, the Ayatollah Mohamed Beheshti, secret
ary of the Revolutionary Council and leader of the predo

minant and hardline Islamic Republican Party, welcomed
Carter's move as helpful to Iran's thrust for independence
from the United States.
The students at the embassy, obviously pleased to have
Khomeini's backing in letting them keep the hostages, also
dismissed the effect of the Carter sanctions.
Looking grim, Carter listed four actions he is taking
against Iran:
— "The United States is breaking diplomatic relations
with Iran. Iranian diplomatic and consular personnel have
been declared persona non grata and must leave the country
by midnight tomorrow."
— Treasury Secretary G. William Miller will prohibit
virtually all exports from the United States to Iran. This will
virtually eliminate trade, even in food and medicine, which
were exempt from earlier sanctions Carter imposed.
— Miller will make an inventory of outstanding claims of
American citizens and corporations against the government
of Iran with the aim of seizing assets of the Iranian govern
ment in the United States to finance settlement of claims by
hostages and their families.
— All visas issued to Iranians for entry into the United
States have been declared invalid, effective immediately,
and no visas will be issued or renewed "except for compel
ling and proven humanitarian reasons or where the national
interest requires."
"The hostages and their families — indeed, all of us in
America — have lived with the reality and the anguish of
their captivity for five months," Carter said.

Several independent analysts here questioned the value
of the Carter sanctions for other reasons. One pointed out
that in the short term at least they strengthen Beheshti and
other opponents of Bani-Sadr and make future efforts at
moderation more difficult than ever for the new president
and his foreign minister, both of whom want to defuse the
U.S.-Iranian crisis.
Another analyst said that although they sound tough, the
Carter sanctions will have more publicity value than real
impact on Iran because diplomatic and economic relations
already are at a virtual standstill and have been since
November.
