# In between capitalism and socialism
## Senegal charts delicate course 
### Leon Dash The Washington Post 
DAKAR , Senegal — This
West Africa nation begins its
third decade of independence
this month still charting what
President Leopold Sedar Sen
ghor calls a "middle way" bet
ween capitalism and socialism.
During the past 20 years, the
former French colony has de
veloped an unusual political sys
tem that includes organized
political opposition, the absence
of tribal strife and a degree of
public criticism of the govern
ment that is a singular rarity in
Africa.
Senegal's record of political
stability and tolerance is fre
quently credited to its wily, intel
lectual 74-year-old president,
whose skillful manipulation of
opposition, religious and tribal
interests have left him in virtu
ally complete control of the
country.
But partly because of weather

and rapidly rising energy costs,
Senegal's economy is experienc
ing serious difficulties. Critics
charge that these are exacer
bated by mismanagement, inef
ficiency and corruption in an
unwieldy system of govern
ment-owned and semipublic en
terprises.
Moreover, the Senghor gov
ernment faced its first public
challenge in a decade when stu
dents in the southern city of
Ziguinchor staged a three-day
riot in January, burning the
mayor's house, two hotels, and
their principal's home and de
stroyed several stores.
Government 'nervous'
The riot erupted when a plan
ned protest of educational condi
tions got out of hand and one
student was killed in the melee.
It left the government "very
nervous because police were un
able to contain the students,"
one Western source said.
Abdoulaye Wade, a leader of

the political opposition, has
criticized Senghor's economic
policy for its heavy reliance on a
single cash crop — peanuts —
and on phosphate exports.
One bright spot in the coun
try's economic picture is its grow
ing tourist trade, but critics argue
that the hotel industry is in the
hands of foreigners and that
Senegal benefits little from the in
flux of thousands of European
visitors.
Peanut economy
"We think that after indepen
dence we should have concen
trated on agricultural develop
ment," Wade said in an inter
view. "Now we have a peanut
and phosphate export mod
el economy with a weak agricul
tural base and deteriorating
terms of trade. We are also tied
up with debts."
Senghor, Wade continued, has
given away "the best beaches" to
French interests and"the
Senegalese cannot have access to
the best sites." He said that "im
ported capital makes us depen
dent" on foreign countries and
that Senghor is "verbally sup
porting agricultural develop
ment" but doing nothing to aid
it.
In the early 19705, when
phosphate prices were high,
Senegal borrowed heavily in in
ternational money markets. To
day, the government is $723
million in debt, an amount that is
roughly 40 percent of the coun
try's gross national product for
1978.
Charges refuted
Replying to Wade's charges,
Senghor said in an interview be
fore he departed for a visit to
Washington this week that tjie
opposition leader "uses anything
he can lay his hands on," and
accuses the government at times
of "nationalizing everything and
at other times of being in the
arms of capitalists."
Despite difficulties, he said,
"the Senegalese economy has
not collapsed." Senegal's prob
lems are endemic to the develop
ing countries of Africa.
"You see, the disadvantage of
the capitalist system is that it

gives too much importance to the
private sector and the disadvan
tage of the communist societies is
that they nationalize everything
lock, stock and barrel."
Middle course
He will, he said, continue "a
middle course between out
and-out capitalism and
socialism."
Senghor, a Catholic in a coun
try where 80 percent of the 6
million people are Moslem, has
been able to rule through an ex
tensive system of patronage also
involving the religious leaders of
Senegal's powerful Moslem
Brotherhood. He has also
adopted the role of a neutral
mediator in inter-lslamic squab
bles.
The source of Senghor's polit
ical strength is his Socialist Par
ty's base in the countryside,
where 75 percent of Senegal's
population lives.
Ideologies defined
Under a recently amended
constitution, each of the four
political parties is assigned a de
finite ideological position that
cannot be changed. If the parties
deviate from it — something
Senghor presumably is left to in
terpret — the parties may be leg
ally disbanded.
Only one of the opposition
parties, Wade's Senegalese
Democratic Party, is represented
in parliament. It has 16 of the
legislature's 100 seats. The radi
cal Marxist-Leninist Party and
the rightist Republican Party are
not represented, but are allowed
to field candidates in the elec
tions.
Critics say that in practice,
Senegal is a one-party slate with
authority concentrated in Sen
ghor's hands. The ruling party
has displayed authoritarian ten
dencies, with Senghor frequently
intervening to protect political
minorities.
This, according to Wade, is the
clue to Senghor's strength. He
has been able to ensure the coun
try's political stability, Wade ad
ded, "by always protecting the
minorities and having them rely
on him for that protection."

Senghor, a Catholic in a coun
try where 80 percent of the 6
million people are Moslem, has
been able to rule through an ex
tensive system of patronage also
involving the religious leaders of
Senegal's powerful Moslem
Brotherhood. He has also
adopted the role of a neutral
mediator in inter-lslamic squab
bles.
The source of Senghor's polit
ical strength is his Socialist Par
ty's base in the countryside,
where 75 percent of Senegal's
population lives.
Ideologies defined
Under a recently amended
constitution, each of the four
political parties is assigned a de
finite ideological position that
cannot be changed. If the parties
deviate from it — something
Senghor presumably is left to in
terpret — the parties may be leg
ally disbanded.
Only one of the opposition
parties, Wade's Senegalese
Democratic Party, is represented
in parliament. It has 16 of the
legislature's 100 seats. The radi
cal Marxist-Leninist Party and
the rightist Republican Party are
not represented, but are allowed
to field candidates in the elec
tions.
Critics say that in practice,
Senegal is a one-party slate with
authority concentrated in Sen
ghor's hands. The ruling party
has displayed authoritarian ten
dencies, with Senghor frequently
intervening to protect political
minorities.
This, according to Wade, is the
clue to Senghor's strength. He
has been able to ensure the coun
try's political stability, Wade ad
ded, "by always protecting the
minorities and having them rely
on him for that protection."
DAKAR , Senegal — This
West Africa nation begins its
third decade of independence
this month still charting what
President Leopold Sedar Sen
ghor calls a "middle way" bet
ween capitalism and socialism.
During the past 20 years, the
former French colony has de
veloped an unusual political sys
tem that includes organized
political opposition, the absence
of tribal strife and a degree of
public criticism of the govern
ment that is a singular rarity in
Africa.
Senegal's record of political
stability and tolerance is fre
quently credited to its wily, intel
lectual 74-year-old president,
whose skillful manipulation of
opposition, religious and tribal
interests have left him in virtu
ally complete control of the
country.
But partly because of weather

and rapidly rising energy costs,
Senegal's economy is experienc
ing serious difficulties. Critics
charge that these are exacer
bated by mismanagement, inef
ficiency and corruption in an
unwieldy system of govern
ment-owned and semipublic en
terprises.
Moreover, the Senghor gov
ernment faced its first public
challenge in a decade when stu
dents in the southern city of
Ziguinchor staged a three-day
riot in January, burning the
mayor's house, two hotels, and
their principal's home and de
stroyed several stores.
Government 'nervous'
The riot erupted when a plan
ned protest of educational condi
tions got out of hand and one
student was killed in the melee.
It left the government "very
nervous because police were un
able to contain the students,"
one Western source said.
Abdoulaye Wade, a leader of

the political opposition, has
criticized Senghor's economic
policy for its heavy reliance on a
single cash crop — peanuts —
and on phosphate exports.
One bright spot in the coun
try's economic picture is its grow
ing tourist trade, but critics argue
that the hotel industry is in the
hands of foreigners and that
Senegal benefits little from the in
flux of thousands of European
visitors.
Peanut economy
"We think that after indepen
dence we should have concen
trated on agricultural develop
ment," Wade said in an inter
view. "Now we have a peanut
and phosphate export mod
el economy with a weak agricul
tural base and deteriorating
terms of trade. We are also tied
up with debts."
Senghor, Wade continued, has
given away "the best beaches" to
French interests and"the
Senegalese cannot have access to
the best sites." He said that "im
ported capital makes us depen
dent" on foreign countries and
that Senghor is "verbally sup
porting agricultural develop
ment" but doing nothing to aid
it.
In the early 19705, when
phosphate prices were high,
Senegal borrowed heavily in in
ternational money markets. To
day, the government is $723
million in debt, an amount that is
roughly 40 percent of the coun
try's gross national product for
1978.
Charges refuted
Replying to Wade's charges,
Senghor said in an interview be
fore he departed for a visit to
Washington this week that tjie
opposition leader "uses anything
he can lay his hands on," and
accuses the government at times
of "nationalizing everything and
at other times of being in the
arms of capitalists."
Despite difficulties, he said,
"the Senegalese economy has
not collapsed." Senegal's prob
lems are endemic to the develop
ing countries of Africa.
"You see, the disadvantage of
the capitalist system is that it

gives too much importance to the
private sector and the disadvan
tage of the communist societies is
that they nationalize everything
lock, stock and barrel."
Middle course
He will, he said, continue "a
middle course between out
and-out capitalism and
socialism."
