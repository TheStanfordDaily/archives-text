# Sudan struggles with refugee flow
## 
### Victoria Brittain The Washington Post 
KHARTOUM, Sudan — Makeshift
camps of grass huts and tents stretch as far as
the eye can see along the main road leading
from here to the Red Sea, accommodating a
rising tide of refugees from neighboring
Ethiopia.
For almost 20 years, Sudan has been be
sieged by refugees from wars and revolutions
of its neighbors in the south and west. But the
exodus from Ethiopia that is still under way
has dramatically increased the number of re
fugees here to nearly 500,000 and
threatened the country's economic, social
and political stability.
The Sudanese have managed to settle
about 42,000 refugees, according to a rep
resentative of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, Said Halim. But, he says, that
is "just a drop in the ocean."
While most refugees from Ethiopia stay in
camps near the border, a substantial number
move west to Sudanese towns and cities, st
raining municipal and housing facilities to
breaking point and contributing to already
roaring inflation.
Those who remain in the camp complain of
hunger. "We are living like dogs," said one
man at Um Guljar camp north of here as he
displayed a basket full of white beans. Days
of soaking and hours of simmering on scarce
firewood has not softened them enough to be
edible.
Sudan, which is one of Africa's poorest
countries, is now preparing an appeal to the
world community for $50 million to help set
tle the refugees.
Most of the new refugees come from
Eritrea, Ethiopia's northern province where

secessionist forces have been involved in a
protracted armed struggle against the gov
ernment troops.
More than 250,00 Eritreans are estimated
to have fled to Sudan. Other Ethiopian
groups fighting the pro-Soviet government in
Addis Ababa, notably the Tigreans and
Oromos tribes of southern Ethiopia, have
made their way across the 1600-mile-long
border into Sudan.
Over the years, the pro-Western govern
ment of President Jaafar Nimeri has made a
valiant effort to settle the refugees. Some
have been given 10 acres of farming land
near new villages with reservoirs, roads,
schools and clinics. Others have been settled
at the edge of Sudan's great state farms on
new irrigated land where cotton and sor
ghum are grown and where there is a crying
need for workers.
But only one of the half dozen settlements
near the eastern border — the complex of
villages of Qala En Nahal, with a population
of 20,000 farming their own land — has so
far become self-sufficient, and that has taken
nearly a decade.
More typical are the camps at Khasm El
Girba and Um Guljar, both along the road
from here to Port Sudan at the Red Sea, that
live off World Food Program donations.
Sudanese refugee officials say that in addi
tion to the staple diet of sorghum, oil, salt and
milk powder arrive irregularly and in insuffi
cient quantities.
At Um Guljar, tuberculosis has increased
so dramatically over the past year that one of
the Eritrean medical assistants, who works at
the poorly equipped tiny clinic, described it
as "a dying community." The long line of

pot-bellied children and emaciated elderly
men assemble each morning at Um Guljar,
the worst of all the camps, but illnesses re
lated to malnutrition haunt all the camps.
The refugee doctor in the little grass and
bamboo hut at Um Guljar is a medical stu
dent with a year to go before he graduates.
Earlier hopes of financial aid to finish his
studies have been buried under the relent
less daily procession of the sick he can some
times help, but rarely cure. His Ethiopian
nurses and medical assistants have left in re--
cent weeks.
Forged passports are on sale throughout
the refugee community, and in desperation
the educated are fleeing to West Germany,
away from the task of helping the Sudanese
administer these camps.
In addition, more than 30,000 United Na
tions travel documents have been issued leg
ally to the refugees. The majority have gone
to the Gulf states to look for work they can
not find in Sudan.
Abdel Rahman el Bashir, Sudan's refugee
commissioner, says he is confident that land,
work and a rural infrastructure can be pro
vided for the refugees of peasant
background, but much more is needed for
the new urban refugees.
"Many of these people are the elite,"
Bashir said. "We cannot let a whole genera
tion be lost. The English-speaking countries
of the world have a moral obligation to help
these people."
But as the U.N." Said Halim says, "no one
has yet come up with a solution to the prob
lem of urban refugees — it is simply too big
and too expensive for any one country to
handle."

the refugee community, and in desperation
the educated are fleeing to West Germany,
away from the task of helping the Sudanese
administer these camps.
In addition, more than 30,000 United Na
tions travel documents have been issued leg
ally to the refugees. The majority have gone
to the Gulf states to look for work they can
not find in Sudan.
Abdel Rahman el Bashir, Sudan's refugee
commissioner, says he is confident that land,
work and a rural infrastructure can be pro
vided for the refugees of peasant
background, but much more is needed for
the new urban refugees.
"Many of these people are the elite,"
Bashir said. "We cannot let a whole genera
tion be lost. The English-speaking countries
of the world have a moral obligation to help
these people."
But as the U.N." Said Halim says, "no one
has yet come up with a solution to the prob

and too expensive for any one country to
handle."
KHARTOUM, Sudan — Makeshift
camps of grass huts and tents stretch as far as
the eye can see along the main road leading
from here to the Red Sea, accommodating a
rising tide of refugees from neighboring
Ethiopia.
For almost 20 years, Sudan has been be
sieged by refugees from wars and revolutions
of its neighbors in the south and west. But the
exodus from Ethiopia that is still under way
has dramatically increased the number of re
fugees here to nearly 500,000 and
threatened the country's economic, social
and political stability.
The Sudanese have managed to settle
about 42,000 refugees, according to a rep
resentative of the U.N. High Commissioner
for Refugees, Said Halim. But, he says, that
is "just a drop in the ocean."
While most refugees from Ethiopia stay in
camps near the border, a substantial number
move west to Sudanese towns and cities, st
raining municipal and housing facilities to
breaking point and contributing to already
roaring inflation.
Those who remain in the camp complain of
hunger. "We are living like dogs," said one
man at Um Guljar camp north of here as he
displayed a basket full of white beans. Days
of soaking and hours of simmering on scarce
firewood has not softened them enough to be
edible.
Sudan, which is one of Africa's poorest
countries, is now preparing an appeal to the
world community for $50 million to help set
tle the refugees.
Most of the new refugees come from
Eritrea, Ethiopia's northern province where

secessionist forces have been involved in a
protracted armed struggle against the gov
ernment troops.
More than 250,00 Eritreans are estimated
to have fled to Sudan. Other Ethiopian
groups fighting the pro-Soviet government in
Addis Ababa, notably the Tigreans and
Oromos tribes of southern Ethiopia, have
made their way across the 1600-mile-long
border into Sudan.
Over the years, the pro-Western govern
ment of President Jaafar Nimeri has made a
valiant effort to settle the refugees. Some
have been given 10 acres of farming land
near new villages with reservoirs, roads,
schools and clinics. Others have been settled
at the edge of Sudan's great state farms on
new irrigated land where cotton and sor
ghum are grown and where there is a crying
need for workers.
But only one of the half dozen settlements
near the eastern border — the complex of
villages of Qala En Nahal, with a population
of 20,000 farming their own land — has so
far become self-sufficient, and that has taken
nearly a decade.
More typical are the camps at Khasm El
Girba and Um Guljar, both along the road
from here to Port Sudan at the Red Sea, that
live off World Food Program donations.
Sudanese refugee officials say that in addi
tion to the staple diet of sorghum, oil, salt and
milk powder arrive irregularly and in insuffi
cient quantities.
At Um Guljar, tuberculosis has increased
so dramatically over the past year that one of
the Eritrean medical assistants, who works at
the poorly equipped tiny clinic, described it
as "a dying community." The long line of

pot-bellied children and emaciated elderly
men assemble each morning at Um Guljar,
the worst of all the camps, but illnesses re
lated to malnutrition haunt all the camps.
The refugee doctor in the little grass and
bamboo hut at Um Guljar is a medical stu
dent with a year to go before he graduates.
Earlier hopes of financial aid to finish his
studies have been buried under the relent
less daily procession of the sick he can some
times help, but rarely cure. His Ethiopian
nurses and medical assistants have left in re--
cent weeks.
