# Swiss franc takes market nosedive
## 
### Hans Neuerbourg The Associated Press 
ZURICH, Switzerland —
An American tourist return
ing to a Zurich hotel after an
absence of 18 months has a
pleasant surprise — his room
is 20 percent cheaper.
The Swiss franc, long
known as the world's hardest
currency, has become frail
over the past few months,
especially against the Ameri
can dollar.
Swiss watch exporters
who feared in 1978 they
would have to fold because
they were squeezed out of
world markets suddenly have
new hopes for the future and
are once again becoming
competitive.
But Herr Schweizer, Swit
zerland's variation of the
American John Doe, is less
happy — prices that had been
virtually stable since 1978 are
rising again. And the gov
ernment says the present 5.1
percent rate of inflation will
get higher over the next year.
President Jimmy Carter's
tight money policy, which has
sent interest rates soaring to
all-time highs, attracting
foreign investors, is a prime
factor.
But there are a variety of
other elements figuring in the
trend, including the Tehran

hostage drama and the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan
which has made some foreign
depositors realize this finan
cial capital is only 250 miles
away from the "Iron Curtain"
border.
The American dollar,
which bought 1.45 Swiss
francs in the fall of 1978 when
it was at an all-time low, now
buys 1.85, or 27 percent
more. American tourists who
then paid $55 for an 80-franc
hotel room now pay $43.
The Swiss National Tourist
Office reports the number of
hotel bookings by foreigners
during February was 15 per
cent higher than a year ago.
"We are very, very satis
fied," said Peter Kuhn,
spokesman for the office,
which has just launched ils
biggest-ever publicity cam
paign in the United States.
"The weak franc helps us,
of course, as it helps the ex
port industry."
The Swiss Federation of
Watch Manufacturers said
exports were 18 percent
higher in February than in the
same period last year.
Other exporters also re
ported increasing business
and thickening order books
in what Swiss Finance Minis
ter Fritz Honegger cautiously
calls a "mini-boom."
