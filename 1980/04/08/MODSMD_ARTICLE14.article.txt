# Daughter a professor at 15
## Stern urges new teaching 
### Theresa Simons Staff Writer 
The present education system
begins too late and thus wastes
much of the potential of a child's
mind, according to Professor
Aaron Stern, who is presenting a
series of talks on his revolutio
nary education methods at Stan
ford this week.
Stern is known for developing
his own "total education sub
mersion method," with which he
educated his daughter Edith to
be a math professor at Michigan
University at the age of 15.
"If the girl had not been ex
posed to my technique, she
would have been another nice
girl, and the world has enough
nice girls," Stern said.
At age 20, Stern's daughter at
tained international renown in
the field of cybernetics. She is
presently designing computers
for IBM.
Iconoclast
Stern considers himself an
iconoclast, one who attacks ven
erated institutions or ideas.
An iconoclast, according to
Stern, makes maintaining the
status quo difficult by enlighten
ing people and helping them to
become independent thinkers.
He observed that Spinoza,
Michelangelo and Darwin were
iconoclasts who destroyed myths
in their time.
As an iconoclast himself, Stern
feels that he is resented by
educators, including the faculty

at Stanford, which he feels is not
happy with his presence here.
"I am hated. My strength is
rife from this very resentment,"
Stern said.
"Mediocrity prevails through
out the world," Stern observed.
He feels that society, as it is to
day, does not allow people to
reach their full potential. He
condemns institutions which he
feels limit human development.
Education
Stern's education method
starts with the premise that intel
lectual growth begins at age zero.
The two components of educa
tion which Stern focuses on are
the acquisition of information
and the ability to build concepts.
He feels that traditional educa
tion begins too late to develop
these mental skills and leads to
disinterest and the eventual de
moralization of the child.
"There is a conspiracy to keep
us dumb," Stern said. This con
spiracy, Stern added, spans all
time and all political systems. It
is not a "legal conspiracy" that
entails agreement but is a result
of everyone's individual actions,
Stern explained.
"Everybody succeeds in his

endeavors, par excellence, to
preserve the status quo," Stern
said.
The role of the iconoclast, ac
cording to Stern, is to make
people aware of this "conspi
racy."
"It's a very unpleasant role,
but nevertheless there must be
someone capable of maintaining
his determination," Stern said.
He feels that his greatest con
tributions as an iconoclast have
been his two children, David and
Edith, and the other children
that have been trained with his
submersion methods.
Two of his better known books
are The Making of a Genius and
The Joy of Learning, which was
nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.
His latest book, The Naked
Truth, also nominated for a
Pulitzer Prize, will be available in
June.
Stern will demonstrate his
education method in a workshop
today at 7:30 p.m. in the
History Corner, will speak about
his research on Thursday at 7:30
p.m. in Kresge Auditorium and
will present a series of sherry
hours on campus throughout the
week.
