# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Review theme policy 
### 
The recent decision by Dean of Student Af
fairs James Lyons to overturn the decision to
terminate the French house points to both the
strengths and weaknesses of the University
decision-making process.
It is indeed a positive reflection of the overall
committment of the administration to make fair
and thoughtful decisions concerning under
graduate residential education. Dean Lyons did
not feel constrained to uphold Assoc. Dean of
Residential Education Norm Robinson's deci
sion to replace La Maison Francaise with an
East Asian Studies theme house when he hon
estly disagreed with that decision. Nor should
he have. An institution like Stanford should
have no reservation in changing a decision or
policy when it proves to be unfair or hasty.
Still, it was the same decision-making process
that produced the now-you-see-it-now-you
don't confusion of recent weeks. 11 was the same
process that left French house residents bewil
dered, East Asian Studies proponents dejected
after an initial and apparently final decision in
their favor. It was the same process that under
mined Robinson's perceived status among stu
dents as the University's Housing Csar. In short,
it was the same decision-making process that
was a dismal failure in this instance.
The University made the error of assuming
students, resident fellows and RA's understood

its policy regarding theme hous£' evaluation.
Few, if any, French house residents evidently
knew that the house was on probation and was
in danger of losing its status. It was Dean
Wormer's dream: Double Secret Probation'.
We hope the University administration will
herewith make it painfully clear to theme
houses exactly what is expected from them and
where they stand in the administration's eyes.
These decisions made regarding houses are, in
fact, decisions made in regard to people.
Students, not merely themes, live in these
houses. The University will have to start show
ing residents the respect they deserve. This situ
ation was as unfair to the French house as it was
to those who drew up the proposal for the East
Asian Studies house and the once-potential re
sidents of that house.
A clear, published policy regarding the theme
house policy is needed immediately. As well,
the University should inform threatened resi
dences personally, preferably at a house meet
ing when residents have the opportunity to ask
questions to clarify their standing, whenever a
particular house is in danger.
The University should learn from its failure
here and see to it that theme houses are given
fair treatment in an atmosphere of open com
munication.
