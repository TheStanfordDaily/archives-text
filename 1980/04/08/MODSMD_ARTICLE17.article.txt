## Gay are society's victims 
### 
Few heterosexuals fully un
derstand the pressures faced by
gay people in our society. Having
been taught since childhood that
their innermost feelings are
wrong and should be suppressed,
gay people must either develop
an immunity to society's pre
judices while on the path of full
acceptance of their true nature,
or suffer constant attacks on
their self-esteem while attempt
ing to deny their sexual iden
tities.
While the great majority of
gay people do not behave in any
way similar to those whose ar
rests were reported on Wednes
day. we can still understand the

causes of such behavior. Most of
the participants in such activities
are yet unhealed victims of an
unbending society's assault, and
are often totally alone and iso
lated from fellow sufferers.
Such people are not able to
join gay society, as they are not
yet ready to come to terms with
their sexuality. A Washington
state representative who (along
with the president of Olympia
Brewery) was recently arrested
under similar circumstances de
clared. after resigning his seat, "I
am not a homosexual."
The transition to full self
acceptance is by no means an
easy one, and is often a turning
point in the life of a gay person.

Though the Gay People's Union
and the Gay Counseling Group
exist, in large part, to make it less
traumatic for those new to the
gay community, the process of
"coming out" necessitates the
overcoming of years of self
doubt, and sometimes self
hatred.
The people who were arrested
deserve sympathy rather than
humiliation. It is they who are
the victims of society.
