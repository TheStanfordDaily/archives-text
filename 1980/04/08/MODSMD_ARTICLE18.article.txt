Flashiest herald
The article "Treat U.S. Cen
sus as a joke" (Daily, Mar. 31)
revealed the ever-present chil
dish indulgence on a college
campus. It is in the same general
wearisome vein as the present
peer-required laughter when
such words as missile, military,
atomic, etc. are mentioned.
The real concern is that so
many never quite overcome the
required college peer routine,
and continue to follow the
flashiest herald to the grave.

'Idiotic' opinions
The article "America's all
volunteer forces in review"
(Daily, April 3) used the opin
ions of Maryann Knight to ex
pound on Army recruitment
problems, the boredom of being

in the infantry, and racial dis
crimination in the military.
Maryann Knight, it seems, is
an expert because she "taught in
the high-school-level program
for troops in an army base in
Germanv during the Vietnam
War."
1 just want to point out that
publishing her opinions to
punctuate statistics and opinions
from professionals studying the
all-volunteer force is incredibly
idiotic. Her contact was with a
tiny portion of the Army at least
seven years ago.
When you allow her to state
"there is an enormous amount of
discrimination in the Army
against blacks" 1 can flatly state
that the journalists who wrote
the article were irresponsible.

Libertarian what?
In Chris Gray's recent article
on Seabrook, (Daily, April 3) he
mentions "libertarian Marxists."
To someone familiar with both
ideologies, this sounds like
"laissez-faire socialists" or "re
volutionary moderates." I, per
sonally, have never met a "liber
tarian Marxist" and don't think
any actually exist.

Help Guatemalans
This week marks the begin
ning of Amnesty International's
"Guatemala Campaign" at Stan
ford. All over campus you will
see posters urging Stanford fa
culty and students to write letters
to protest to the Guatemalan
government for the gross viola
tion of human rights that is tak
ing place there.
Since 1966, 20,000 people
have been kidnapped, tortured
and killed in Guatemala. For the
last six years, an average of eight
bodies have been found daily.
Sometimes as many as 17 mang
led corpses have been found in a
single day.
Students and teachers in par
ticular have been targeted in
right-wing death squads and
many have been tortured and kil
led for speaking out against a
cruel and repressive govern
ment.
Constant death threats, muti
lation of friends and colleagues,
dismissals of students and pro
fessors, and police dispersals of
meetings of over three people
are daily occurrences that result
in the denial of academic rights,
freedom of speech and often
death for those who dare to fight
for justice.
The Stanford chapter of Am
nesty International has adopted
Guatemala's political struggle as
their priority project, and urges
professors and students to write
to officials in the Guatemalan
government, calling for a stop to
these brutal killings and urging
an investigation into these
death-squad activities. Please
take a few minutes to stop and
read these posters for more in
formation, and then write your
letter. Your letters will make a
difference between life and
death for some Guatemalan
people.

Constant death threats, muti
lation of friends and colleagues,
dismissals of students and pro
fessors, and police dispersals of
meetings of over three people
are daily occurrences that result
in the denial of academic rights,
freedom of speech and often
death for those who dare to fight
for justice.
The Stanford chapter of Am
nesty International has adopted
Guatemala's political struggle as
their priority project, and urges
professors and students to write
to officials in the Guatemalan
government, calling for a stop to
these brutal killings and urging
an investigation into these
death-squad activities. Please
take a few minutes to stop and
read these posters for more in
formation, and then write your
letter. Your letters will make a
difference between life and
death for some Guatemalan
people.
