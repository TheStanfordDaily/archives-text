Corporate investment in South Af
rica once again tops the list of stock
proxy vote recommendations submit
ted to the University Board of Trustees
by the Stanford Commission on In
vestment Responsibility (CIR).
The commission, composed of stu
dents. faculty, alumni and staff, consid
ers the social and ethical implications
of the University's investments and
makes recommendations to the board
regarding its stock proxy votes.
By a 7-2 vote Friday, CIR recom-
Owens-Illinois Corp.
liquidate its present interests in Con
solidated Glassworks, a South African
firm in which the American company
has a 20 percent interest.
The board will consider ClR's re
commendation today at its regular
April meeting in San Francisco. The
University currently owns 1100 shares
df Owens-Illinois.
"We believe that U.S. companies
which have subsidiaries or investments
in companies within South Africa
should comply with certain minimal so
cial criteria. Some of these include evi
dence of exceptional corporate prog
ress in affirmative action programs and
non-discriminatory employment prac
tices. We could not find sufficient evi
dence that the company (Consolidated
Glass) meets the minimal social
criteria," the commission stated in its
recommendation report to the board.

"We believe that the shareholder re
solution for withdrawal would be a
major protest against apartheid and
could create significant pressure for
change in South Africa," the report
continued.
The two-person minority opposed
this shareholder proposal only because
it called for reinvestment of the
Owens-Illinois assets outside South
Africa. The American company should
have the option of investing in a so
cially responsible firm, the members
contended.
In other stock proxy votes related to
South Africa, the commission unanim
ously called for the Bank of America
and Wells Fargo Bank to establish a
corporate policy of making no new
loans or renewals of existing loans to
the South African government or its
agencies until racist laws and regula
tions are revoked. The University owns
134,670 shares of Bank America Corp.
and 15,200 shares of Wells Fargo.
CIR also unanimously recom
mended abstaining on Crocker Na
tional Bank shareholder proposals
against both government and private
sector loans in South Africa, saying cer
tain private firms may accelerate
needed reforms. Currently the Univer
sity holds 700 shares of Crocker.
Finally, in a 5-2 vote with two favor
ing abstentions, the group recom
mended against shareholder proposals
for Caterpillar to establish a review
committee on South Africa, saying the

firm had shown it was aware of possible
use of its products by South African
police and military, and had good gen
eral records on employment practices
there. The University owns 32,070
shares.
On other issues, CIR voted against
asking Abbott Laboratories to estab
lish an infant formulas review commit
tee. The commission noted that Abbott
had sponsored social programs to re
duce social injury arising from impro
per marketing of its products. The Uni
versity owns 97,680 shares.
CIR also voted 4-3 against asking
Pacific Gas and Electric Company to
convert Diablo Canyon to non-nuclear
fuel and 9-0 against PG&E's with
drawal from nuclear plant construction
or nuclear energy use. The University
holds 1744 shares of PG&E.
"No issues were more difficult or
troublesome than those concerning
nuclear power." the CIR report stated.
The commission agreed with the
management that conversion of the
Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant to
non-nuclear fuel, "even if technologi
cally possible, would nevertheless be
inordinately expensive and time
consuming. We believe this is an im
practical proposal," the commission
found.
CIR originally was established in
1977 because of concern by students
over Stanford's investments in South
Africa.
