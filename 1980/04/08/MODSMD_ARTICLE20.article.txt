# Vote to pursue long-term interests

### 
Why vote?
It wasn't long ago when the
only people who dared to ask this
question were too steeped in ig
norance or apathy to know any
better. As this year's presidential
election unfolds, people who
know better are taking the dare,
questioning the value of our
most precious democratic in
stitution as it now stands.
If our choice of presidential
candidates is any measure of the
adequacy of our election pro
cess, then we are in trouble. Pres-

ident Jimmy Carter has been
floundering ever since he took
office, yet he has all but sewn up
the Democratic nomination.
Ironically, each new crisis that he
helps to create bolsters his popu
larity in the polls. If this keeps up
he could win by a landslide in
November.
Ronald Reagan is hardly an
acceptable alternative. He is no
less an unknown quantity than
Carter was four years ago, except
in the area of foreign policy.
Here Reagan could gaffe even
worse than Carter has. Reagan
still wants to blockade Cuba as
an answer to Soviet aggression in
Afghanistan. Somebody ought

to remind old Ronnie that
Washington is not Hollywood
and formulating foreign policy is
not like making World War II
training films.
Perhaps most disillusioning is
the feeling that the entire elec
tion process is out of hand — out
of the voter's hands. Party poli
tics notwithstanding, the politi
cal reins in this country have fal
len into the hands of journalists.
Political parties may see that the
names of their candidates get on
the ballot; voters may make the

final decisions once they are in
the voting booth; but the mass
media shapes and defines the en
tire process.
Since objective journalism is
about as rare as a free campaign
lunch, it is easy to see how the
mood of a candidate's media
coverage can make or break his
or her campaign. If the press
likes a candidate, the coverage is
favorable, the popularity polls
look up, campaign contributions
flow freely, so more money is
pumped back into media cover
age.
All a candidate really needs is
a warm smile or a slick style
under the camera's eye; the pres

idential image-makers can do
their job without forcing their
candidate to take a firm stand on
any issues. Sound cynical? That's
how Carter made it to the White
House.
The creation of false or exagg
erated images by the media
points out the increasing burden
of information processing that
today's voters must saddle. As
the issues get more complex, a
person must learn to sift through
more and more information
from various sources, trying to
make some sense of it all. The
dissemination of false or mis
leading information severely
cripples this process, since a vote
cast in ignorance or misun
derstanding can be worse than
no vote at all.
So, if the candidates are lousy
and the election process cor
rupted by the mass media, why
vote? An obvious answer to this
question is that, like anything
precious, we must guard our
right to vote or risk losing it, and
the only way to protect this free
dom is to exercise it often and
judiciously. Though this state
ment may be true, there is a
problem with this reasoning,
however virtuous it may sound.
The fact is that people rarely
base their actions on high
minded ideals, but instead look
out for their own interests.
California's Proposition 13 pas
sed overwhelmingly not because
the people wanted to send a mes
sage to Big Government; it pas
sed because the individual voters
wanted to save money on prop
erty taxes.

It is quite natural and proper

for voters to defend their special
interests. The caveat lies in mak
ing the distinction between
short-term benefits and long
term disasters, and unfortunat
ely, myopia usually prevails over
foresight.
Nonetheless, the best reason
for voting, despite all the pitfalls,
is to pursue one's own long-term
interests. In today's world a single
person can do very little to.

rate and governmental institu-'-

Voting is one of the few and

an individual can take to defend
his or her civil rights. How else
but by voting can a person prove
that he or she did not listen to the
polls, did not sucker for the
media hype, and by doing so help
neutralize the negative influ
ences of the mass media?
But at the ballot box, power
only comes from numbers. Thus,
the decision whether or not to
vote is an example of how one's
self-interest may correspond
with the interests of everyone.
Only 54.4 percent of those
who were eligible to vote actu-.
ally made it to the polls in
November of 1976, the lowest
percentage since 1948. It would
be rather sobering, given the na
ture of today's political and
economic climate, to see these
poor statistics repeated in 1 980.
We must consider our long-term
interests and remember that we
are only one presidential elec
tion away from 1984.

Why vote?
It wasn't long ago when the
only people who dared to ask this
question were too steeped in ig
norance or apathy to know any
better. As this year's presidential
election unfolds, people who
know better are taking the dare,
questioning the value of our
most precious democratic in
stitution as it now stands.
If our choice of presidential
candidates is any measure of the
adequacy of our election pro
cess, then we are in trouble. Pres-

ident Jimmy Carter has been
floundering ever since he took
office, yet he has all but sewn up
the Democratic nomination.
Ironically, each new crisis that he
helps to create bolsters his popu
larity in the polls. If this keeps up
he could win by a landslide in
November.
Ronald Reagan is hardly an
acceptable alternative. He is no
less an unknown quantity than
Carter was four years ago, except
in the area of foreign policy.
Here Reagan could gaffe even
worse than Carter has. Reagan
still wants to blockade Cuba as
an answer to Soviet aggression in
Afghanistan. Somebody ought

to remind old Ronnie that
Washington is not Hollywood
and formulating foreign policy is
not like making World War II
training films.
Perhaps most disillusioning is
the feeling that the entire elec
tion process is out of hand — out
of the voter's hands. Party poli
tics notwithstanding, the politi
cal reins in this country have fal
len into the hands of journalists.
Political parties may see that the
names of their candidates get on
the ballot; voters may make the

final decisions once they are in
the voting booth; but the mass
media shapes and defines the en
tire process.
Since objective journalism is
about as rare as a free campaign
lunch, it is easy to see how the
mood of a candidate's media
coverage can make or break his
or her campaign. If the press
likes a candidate, the coverage is
favorable, the popularity polls
look up, campaign contributions
flow freely, so more money is
pumped back into media cover
age.
All a candidate really needs is
a warm smile or a slick style
under the camera's eye; the pres

idential image-makers can do
their job without forcing their
candidate to take a firm stand on
any issues. Sound cynical? That's
how Carter made it to the White
House.
The creation of false or exagg
erated images by the media
points out the increasing burden
of information processing that
today's voters must saddle. As
the issues get more complex, a
person must learn to sift through
more and more information
from various sources, trying to
make some sense of it all. The
dissemination of false or mis
leading information severely
cripples this process, since a vote
cast in ignorance or misun
derstanding can be worse than
no vote at all.
So, if the candidates are lousy
and the election process cor
rupted by the mass media, why
vote? An obvious answer to this
question is that, like anything
precious, we must guard our
right to vote or risk losing it, and
the only way to protect this free
dom is to exercise it often and
judiciously. Though this state
ment may be true, there is a
problem with this reasoning,
however virtuous it may sound.
The fact is that people rarely
base their actions on high
minded ideals, but instead look
out for their own interests.
California's Proposition 13 pas
sed overwhelmingly not because
the people wanted to send a mes
sage to Big Government; it pas
sed because the individual voters
wanted to save money on prop
erty taxes.

It is quite natural and proper

for voters to defend their special
interests. The caveat lies in mak
ing the distinction between
short-term benefits and long
term disasters, and unfortunat
ely, myopia usually prevails over
foresight.
Nonetheless, the best reason
for voting, despite all the pitfalls,
is to pursue one's own long-term
interests. In today's world a single
person can do very little to.
counter the heavy hand of corpo-'
rate and governmental institu-'-
tions that pervade our daily lives.-
Voting is one of the few and
perhaps the best course of action!
an individual can take to defend
his or her civil rights. How else
but by voting can a person prove
that he or she did not listen to the
polls, did not sucker for the
media hype, and by doing so help
neutralize the negative influ
ences of the mass media?
But at the ballot box, power
only comes from numbers. Thus,
the decision whether or not to
vote is an example of how one's
self-interest may correspond
with the interests of everyone.
Only 54.4 percent of those
who were eligible to vote actu-.
ally made it to the polls in
November of 1976, the lowest
percentage since 1948. It would
be rather sobering, given the na
ture of today's political and
economic climate, to see these
poor statistics repeated in 1 980.
We must consider our long-term
interests and remember that we
are only one presidential elec
tion away from 1984.
