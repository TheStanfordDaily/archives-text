# Bag governmental money monopoly
## 
### 
My Webster's dictionary de
fines inflation as "an increase in
the amount of currency in circu
lation, resulting in a relatively
sharp and sudden fall in its value
and rise in prices." It seems to
me that Webster understood in
flation as well as anybody today:
when more money meets the
same amount of goods, prices
rise.
Merchants, speculators, big
business, aliens, unions, con
sumer greed, rising energy
prices, lack of national will, "in
flation psychology" — all have

been blamed for the frightening
erosion of the purchasing power
of paper money. And it's not by
accident that the politicians do a
lot*of the blaming.
Inflation is not a new
phenomenon. The Roman Em
pire, the French Revolution,
post-World War I Germany, and
many other places and times
have expeienced persistently ris
ing prices. And if we check the
facts, we'll find that long-term
inflations are accompanied by
long-term increases in the supply
of money. Briefer but acute
bouts of violent and runaway in
flation are fueled by rapid and
accelerating increases of that
supply. »
There are economists who
proclaim that the answer is to
strictly limit the power of gov
ernment to expand the money
supply. But if history is any les
son, this will always fail. We
would delude ourselves to expect
that in difficult times the "ex

perts" will not think up a new
excuse (priming the pump, eas
ing the liquidity crunch) for the
government to spend more than
it takes in and print the differ
ence.
The only solution is to remove
the monopoly power of govern
ment to supply money. We
should allow individuals and
firms to satisfy the demand by
the public for tokens or notes to
use in exchanges.
For example, we might be of
fered a five-"Crocker" note,
printed by Crocker Bank, in

payment for a debt. Or we might
pay for groceries with a 20-
"Hayek" note, printed by a
partnership of economists. None
of these notes would be legal ten
der, that is, one would be free to
reject them as payment. That is
the key to ensuring that they
maintain their value. Govern
ment, having the power to force
its notes on us, has every incen
tive not to maintain their value.
Why would anyone print their
own brand of money? Because,
like today's issuers of traveler's
checks, they get to borrow
interest-free. It is in their interest
to get people to accept as many
of their notes as possible. And to
do that they will have to promise
to control the supply so as to
keep the purchasing power of
their notes constant in terms of a
prearranged "market basket" of
goods and raw materials.
Undoubtedly, the financial
pages of the newspapers would
print the latest currency devia

tions from promised values. Too
wide a swing and people will stop
accepting a currency, forcing the
issuer to redeem his notes. In
deed, a thousand hounds would
be after the unfortunate issuer
who failed in the prompt re
sponses required to ensure the
safeguarding of the value of his
currency.
To be sure, there might be dis
advantages. Having to handle
several currencies is probably
the worst, but even this incon
venience will be minimal as cer
tain currencies will tend to be
used in certain kinds of transac
tions: some issuers will aim at the
wholesale food markets, others
at building materials, others at
consumer transactions, etc.
And there are incentives for
the issuer to supply his "custom
ers" with accounting help so that
they will continue to use his cur
rency. The peace of mind (to say
nothing of the boon to com
merce) obtained by inflation
free money will far outweigh
these small liabilities.
It is no accident that the ser
vices that are lowest in quality
are those provided by the gov
ernment: mail delivery, educa

tion, police protection, and sta
ble money, among others. With
out the feedback and the discip
line imposed by the market,
where consumers are free to re
ject a low-quality service in favor
of a better one, the government
monopolists will supply an
ever-deterioriating product.
A Free Money Movement
comparable to the Free Trade
Movement of the 19th century is
what we need. Nobel Laureate
Friedrich Hayek has begun this
movement by publishing The
Denationalisation of Money,
from which I drew many of the
ideas in this column.
To those who find unthinkable
the idea of removing govern
ment from its 2000-year-old
monopoly on the issue of money,
I would like to point out that 400
years ago it was unthinkable that
government should ever give up
its monopoly on religion. Let us
not let a little thinking prevent us
from removing this devil from
our midst.
