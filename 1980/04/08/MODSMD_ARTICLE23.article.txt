# Tragically slain by a former follower
## Allard Lowenstein: a liberal inspiration to Stanford students 
### Steven Crandell Staff Writer 
Sixteen years ago, Allard
Lowenstein, former assistant
dean of men at Stanford, was
speaking to hundreds of stu
dents, urging them to spend their
summer registering black voters
in the racial cauldron of Missis
sippi. By all accounts, he was in
spiring.
This past March 14, one of
those inspired Stanford students,
who dropped out of school to
work for black rights, allegedy
gunned Lowenstein down in his
New York law office. The al
leged gunman was Dennis
Sweeney, once an honors stu
dent in history here.
As a liberal who always
worked within the system, Low
enstein antagonized both the
conservative and the radical
elements of American politics.
He was high on former President
Richard Nixon's enemies list and
was suspected by black radical
civil rights leaders of being in
volved with the CIA in the '60s.
The Berkeley People's World,
a socialist newspaper, in 1977,
called him "a classical liberal
counter-revolutionary."
Yet Eleanor Roosevelt
characterized Lowenstein this

way: "He will always fight
crus'tjdes because injustice fills
him with a sense of rebellion."
People viewed him in various
ways, but his significant actions
are clear.
Chief engineer
Lowenstein engineered the
"Dump, Johnson" movement in
1968 which deterred former
President Lyndon Johnson from
seeking another term. He was a
Congressman for New York dur
ing 1968-70 and had failed to be
re-elected in several attempts
since. He fought for black civil
rights, and succeeded in seating
the Mississippi Freedom Demo
cratic party's delegates in place
of the Mississippi party regulars
at the 1964 Democratic Conven
tion.
He came out against the war in
Vietnam and influenced Sen.
Eugene McCarthy to follow suit.
He was Carter's "human rights"
ambassador to the United Na
tions. He had been a top advisor
to Robert Kennedy and recently,
was vital to Sen. Ted Kennedy's
campaign.
His influence was perhaps
strongest on the intellectual
youth of America, though. It cer
tainly was felt at Stanford.
While Lowenstein was here

(as a lecturer in political science
and an assistant dean of men in
1961-2 and as a guest professor
in human biology in the fall of
'71), he was one of the most
popular teachers on campus —
and one of the most active.
Senior Ann Jennings, knew
him only since he came here to
speak for Stanford Students for
Kennedy last October. Yet she
said, "Losing him was tough. 1
felt like I lost something I needed
in my life — a close friend and a
force. (He) made you care about
intellectual issues." She is not
unique. Many collegians have
felt the pull of Lowenstein's
friendship in concert with the tug
of his social conscience.
In the fall of 1971, Lowenstein
organized a "Dump Nixon"
movement at Stanford. Al
though the movement eventually
flopped, he drew hundreds of
students to hear him speak.
Larry Diamond, a member of
the Council of Presidents that
year remembers Lowenstein's
motivating force on a "quite cyn
ical" student body.
"He was shrewdly attuned to
the mood and sensitivity of the
crowd, (and was) even more ef
fective one on one. "He had a
profound impact on literally

hundreds of politically oriented
young people."
Lowenstein was also involved
with the origins of the Stanford
Students for Kennedy move
ment on campus.
Crowded funeral
His funeral in New York over
flowed with people. He was "a
brother," said Ted Kennedy.
Rep. Pete McCloskey (R-Menlo
Park) described him as a
"thoroughly decent, warm
hearted, gentle person." Coretta
Scott King, Andrew Young and
Jacqueline Onasis were there.
Harry Chapin and Peter, Paul
and Mary sang for the funeral
service.
The feelings expressed about
Lowenstein were those of re
spect. Most counted him as a
friend and adviser, just as De
nnis Sweeney had in 1964.
But, according to witnesses,
on the day of the murder,
Sweeney wasn't sorrowful or
even agitated; he was relieved.
After the shooting, he put the
murder weapon down on a desk,
sat down in the reception room
and lit a cigarette. One witness
said, "It was unbelievable. He
didn't even tremble."
Sweeney had been an ardent
follower of Lowenstein.

Sweeney left Stanford in 1964 to
help Lowenstein in Mississippi.
On Sept. 28, he was arrested
with 19 local blacks in a protest.
During his time there, he was
almost killed by a bomb as he
slept. He was an important
member of the Student Non
violent Coordinating Committee
(SNCC), an organization Low
enstein helped shape to attack
prejudice in the South.
At Stanford, Sweeney was
"very intelligent . . . very much
committed to changing
America," according to History
Prof. Barton Bernstein. The
quintessential '60s student
idealist, Sweeney seemed to be
following directly after Lowens
tein's lead of selfless dedication
to righting injustice.
As the SNCC (with Stokely
Carmichael as leader) became
more radical, a schism developed
between Lowenstein and

Sweeney. No longer mentor and
pupil, they were almost adver
saries. Referring to what he
thought was Lowenstein's
"cop-out" in Mississippi,
Sweeney said, "Does voting
make a man free? Clearly, it
doesn't." The inference was that
all Lowenstein strove for was to
get the blacks the vote and not
other social rights.
After he was expelled from he
SNCC because he wasn't a black,
Sweeney slowly became more
and more estranged from society
in general. He began to fear that
the CIA was using his fillings to
damage his brain. He tore out his
bridgework. Friends charac
terize him as a brooder, and re
port that he began to speak in his
own language.
In the early "70s, he went to a
private mental hospital in the
East. But he stayed only a week.
He spent the last seven years

of his life in New London, Conn,
working in a mattress factory, as
a mail carrier and as a carpenter.
David Harris, former Stanford
student body president and
anti-draft activist, called him
"the leading civil rights figure on
campus" during 1963-4. Sixteen
years later, his landlady in Con
necticut described him as "kind
of weird. He thinks somebody's
after him and things like that."
Sweeney told police after the
murder that Lowenstein was put
ting pressure on his family, caus
ing his father to have a fatal heart
attack. "He's been controlling
my mind," police quoted
Sweeney as saying, "for many
years. And now I've put an end
to it."
For Sweeney, the inspiration
many have felt from Lowenstein
became fear and resentment. He
felt the duty to kill just as he had
felt the duty to go to Mississippi.
