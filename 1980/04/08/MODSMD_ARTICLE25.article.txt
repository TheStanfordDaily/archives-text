# Soviet consumers face food shortages

MOSCOW — Never in the
past decade has the prospect of
widespread new shortages of
fresh meat and dairy products so
darkened the horizon for Soviet
consumers as in this dismal
Soviet spring of 1980, when the
American grain embargo looms
in the minds of millions.
A palpable mood of frustra
tion and disappointment sours
the pungent atmosphere of this
capital's markets as buyers with
rueful, tight-lipped looks con
template empty shelves or as
tronomical prices they are sure
are only a harbinger of worse to
come.
In the well-stocked farmers'
markets, $21 buys a chicken
weighing three pounds. Five dol
lars buys one pound of stew beef.
Three dollars gets a pound of
veal. This in a country where the
working man's average income is
the ruble equivalent of $270 a
month. Purchases are made, but
the expressions of satisfaction
are even thinner than usual as
the shoppers wheel away from
the grizzled peasant sellers,
purchases safely jammed into
their string bags.
In the sparsely supplied state
stores, where prices are much
lower, milk and such indispensa
ble ingredients of the local
cuisine as sour cream, cottage
cheese and yogurt frequently are
not available. Even official fi
gures admit a 4 percent decline
in dairy production for the first

two months of 1980 compared
with 1979, a result of continuing
major problems with fodder
supplies for the dairy herds.
The Soviets have secured
eUewhere all hut a few million
tonsot the 17 million tons of feed
grain embargoed by President
Carter, as retaliation for the De
cember invasion of Afghanistan.
But the delays and overall
shortfall in foreign grain purch
ases will bring further disruption
to dairy production in May and
June, Western diplomatic
On the street, angered con
sumers readily blame their plight
on the Americans. "They are try
ing to starve the herds," said one
woman, echoing the official
media line. But many also lay the
blame for their difficulties on the
policies of their own leadership,
in a mixed bitter-sweet com
plaint that combines anger and
pride. As one man put it, after
describing endless shortages of
meat in his Black Sea home city
of Sukhumi, "We're feeding half
the damn fraternal socialist
world, from Cuba to Kampuchea
(Cambodia) and now Afghanis
tan."
The Soviets, who have never
disclosed that they were heavy
purchasers of U.S. grain, have
had relatively little to say about
the embargo. They have had vir
tually nothing to say about their
energetic and largely successful
efforts to make up the missing 17
million tons of feed, which they
originally sought to fill the gap

left by a terrible harvest last year.
According to well-informed
Western sources here, the Soviet
Union has made up all but 5.5
million tons of the 36 million
tons of grain it planned to import
through June 30. This amount
includes 8 million tons already
purchased from the United
States under the existing grain
trade agreement that expires
next year.
The Soviet purchases have
raised world prices. Specialists
here note the Soviets "are out
offering attractive prices" of as
much as $25 per ton more for
corn from Argentina than
American corn, at $179 per ton,
was fetching just last month in
gulf ports. They have all the hard
currency they need for this from
sale to Western countries of oil
and precious minerals.
Because of delays in arranging
shipping for this foreign grain,
experts here anticipate that the
Soviets will not be able to ride
out the year without reducing
their livestock herds in distress
slaughters. Official Soviet fi
gures show that this has already
started. The weekly Ekonomie
Gazete reported two weeks ago
that beef production rose 13 per
cent in the first two months of
this year as compared to 1979
figures, while pork was up 10
percent and poultry 16 percent.
Part of this increase can be attri
buted to lower than average
slaughter figures for the same
period last year due to an ex
tremely cold winter which dis

rupted both agriculture and
transportation.
One of the many continuing
mysteries in the country is where
all this "extra" meat goes. It has
not yet appeared here in Mos
cow, which stands first in the of
ficial supply line. And in hun
dreds of regional cities, such as
Sochi, Novosibirsk and Ryazan,
Soviets say that fresh meat at
reasonable prices has been a
10-year rarity despite official fi
gures that show continuing ad
vances in total per capita meat
production.
Whenever the influx of extra
meat arrives at market, Soviets
are looking beyond to succeed
ing new months of scarcity.
Chronic shortage is a fundamen
tal reality of Soviet life, and
while many people may grumble,
if there is no meat they will sim
ply eat fat (salted pork fat — $3 a
pound).
Western experts estimate now
that the 1980 grain harvest may
total about 220 million tons, far
below the 235 million tons of the
five-year plan goal, but adequate
to preserve the livestock herds
without disastrous reductions or
massive foreign grain purchases.
One of the consequences of
the Carter embargo has been
that talks to exchange crop sur
vey teams between the two na
tions are suspended and it is un
known when — or if — an
American team will be able to
make the detailed inspections
considered necessary to accurate
harvest prediction.
