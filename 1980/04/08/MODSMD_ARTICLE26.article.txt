# U.S. shoppers hoard goods

An engineer hoards food in
case unemployment strikes
his profession. A telephone
company supervisor does it as
a hedge against inflation. A
librarian because she is
scared.
Food hoarding is some
thing psychiatrists liken to the
bomb-shelter preparations of
the Cold War years, another
way of searching for "psychic
insurance" against uncertain
times.
In the past few months —
and for the third time in 10
years — large numbers of
Americans have started to
hoard food.
The marketers of freeze
dried or dehydrated meats
and vegetables packed in
nitrogen-sealed cans for
long-term storage, a re report
ing sales volumes often dou
ble those of a year ago.
Although "survival foods,"
as they are known, represent

less than one percent of the
food industry as a whole, one
marketing estimate projects
their sales this year at $100
million, up from $30 million
in 1979.
Several of the dozen or so
principal manufacturers of
survival foods said they
noticed an upswing in public
demand around the time of
last spring's gas crisis.
"Then it intensified, since
the first of January, as if
somebody rang a bell," said
Jim Newman, national sales
manager for Sam Andy Foods
of Riverside, Calif., one of the
largest survival food produc
ers.
"Americans tend to oscil
late between fear and com
placency," said Frank Ford,
chairman of Dallas-based Ar
rowhead Mills, which pro
duces a survival line of such
natural foods as whole grains,
beans and nuts.
In 1973 and '74, a
survival-food boom hit the

United States. It was widely
attributed to the 1973 energy
crisis, inflation, Vietnam and
Watergate.
Another boom, in 1976-
77, was attributed to a push
among Mormons, whose re
ligion counsels food storage
for bad times, and to a fear of
recession among non-
Mormons.
This time, buyers are citing
inflation, the spiraling price
of gold or a combination of
such events as the Iranian
hostage crisis, the Afghanis
tan crisis or the price of
gasoline.
Many survival foods —
milk powders, hot chocolate
mix, macaroni, rice, flour,
oatmeal, pancake mix, honey,
sugar, or dried apples, prunes
and raisins — are basically the
same as those sold on super
market shelves. But they are
specially packaged to last up
to seven years; regularly can
ned goods last about one
year.
