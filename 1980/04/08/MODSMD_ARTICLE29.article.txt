# Cards down Bears 10—4
## SPORTS 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
Phil Worden slashed four hits
in five tries yesterday, two of
I them home runs, one a grand
slam, and accumulated seven
I RBIs as the Stanford baseball
team crushed the Cal Bears 10-4
;at Sunken Diamond in the re
i scheduled second game of their
| three-game series. The third
1 game will be played in Berkeley
i this afternoon.
Catcher Worden, batting .295
j for the season, was the Card of
fense yesterday, not that the
other Cardinals should be sligh
ted, though, as they rapped out
13 hits against an assortment of
three Bear pitchers. Worden,
though, belted out a two-out,
three-run homer in the bottom
of the third and then came right
back in the fifth with a grand
slam clearing all fences in left
field and all but breaking the
Bears' backs.
The third and fifth innings, as
it turned out, spelled the demise
for Cal. The Cardinals scored
nine of their 10 runs in those two
innings. The Cards, despite 13
Cal hits, got solid pitching out
ings from Larry Kuhn and re
liever Brian Mignano. Kuhn,
coming back from a strong per
formance against the same Bears
on Thursday, went 4 1 /} innings,
allowing three Cal runs, and left
the game with a one-run lead in
the fifth.
Mignano came in then, got
shortstop Rod Booker to fly to
left, and Worden threw out Greg
Zunino at third base to end the
inning and the Cal threat. The
game, at that time, was still very
much up in the air. Mignano, asit
turned out, did a fine job in pre
serving Stanford's lead, which by
the top of the sixth had grown to
10-3.
The tall right-hander was
superb in holding Cal, until yes
terday second in the Pac-10, to
only one run in the last four in
nings. In fact, he shut out the
Bears in their half of the sixth,
seventh and the eighth before
giving up an inconsequential
tally in the ninth. With one out in
the ninth, Mignano struck out
first sacker Rod Jessen looking,
his fourth in as many innings,
the next batter, designated hitter

Kelly Wood, flied to centerfiel
der Darryl Stephens and that was
that, 10-4, Stanford.
Stanford jumped to an early
4-0 lead after the first inning to
give Kuhn a cushion. In the sec
ond, Stanford firstbaseman Lor
ing Davies walked, a batter later
swiped second and then scored
when John Elway hit a dart to
left center. An inning later, after
starter Kuhn set Cal down 1 -2-3,
Stanford designated hitter Phil
Wilson walked with one out.
Second sacker Paul Zuvella sing
led Wilson to third. Dave Meier
popped to short, setting the stage
for the first round of the Bill
Worden show. He jumped on a
Glenn Prater pitch, sending it to
the (very) cheap seats in leftfield,
his eighth of the year, and Stan
ford was up 4-0.
Then in the fifth, all hell broke
loose for the visitors. Wilson
walked, Zuvella singled and Pra
ter was taken out for lefty re
liever Steve Conroy. Conroy
started a little slow, walking
Meier, and thus round two, or
rather shot two. Worden ham
mered, and I mean hammered, a
screamer over the fence for four
more runs. His second home run
of the day was his ninth of the
year, and in the process he upped
his RBI total to 34. The all-time
one season Stanford home run
record, by the way, is only 13.
After Worden cleared the
bases, Davies walked again and
outfielder Mike Toothman sing
led to left. Elway quickly moved
the runners to second and third
with a well-placed sacrifice bunt.
Conroy was then lifted for the
third and last Cal hurler of the
day, right-handed Dave
Granger. Third baseman Bob
DeCosta greeted him with a
bouncer over third baseman
Greg Zunino's head which
scored both Davies and Tooth
man. Score: Stanford 10, Cal
whatever. Six runs for the Cards
in the fifth. Granger did shut
down Stanford in the last three
innings, however.
Yesterday's game was origi
nally scheduled for Friday but
wet fields forced the date
change. Today's game in Ber
keley was supposed to be played

out on Saturday but again
weather didn't permit. Stan
ford's win pushed their confer
ence record to 6-8 in the Pac-10.
Cal's record within the Pac-1()
was dropped to 7-7, 22-11-1
overall, the Cards' record is now
21-11. Incidentally, since the
Cal-Stanford series started back

in 1892, the Bears have won 149
and the Cardinals 109.
The Cards' schedule plans to
be quite hectic the next six days.
Tomorrow Santa Clara ventures
into the "friendly confines" of
the Sunken Diamond. Then on
Friday, USC comes to town for a
three-game set ending Sunday
afternoon. The games on Wed
nesday and Friday start at 2:30;
the weekend's contests beuin at
1 p.m.

The Midwest retained its

the Huskers, Cyclones and
fourth-place Oklahoma. The
Pac-10 posted a challenge to that
trend by taking three of the top
seven team spots — UCLA
finished sixth and Arizona State
was seventh.
"It was very tough competi

score in finals and 9.45 was last
