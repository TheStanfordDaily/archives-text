# Gymnasts fare well at nationals
## 
### Dean Eyre Staff Writer 
Stanford placed a trio of gym
nasts in two national champion
ships last weekend — the
NCAAs at Lincoln, Nebraska
and the AIAWs in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.
In the men's competition,
junior Craig Goldman finished
48th in his specialty, the still
rings, with a 9.05 optional score.
Senior Tad Bostick recorded a
50.10 compulsory all-around
sum and 52.35 points in optional
competition to earn 27th place.
Nebraska's Jim Hartung top
ped the all-around competition
Friday night with a NCAA re
cord of 58.025 points in the six
events. Hartung's effort broke
the previous mark of 57.70 set by
former Indiana State star Kurt
Thomas last year, and paced the
Cornhuskers to their second
straight national team title.
With a 563.30 point total,
Nebraska put together an impres
sive showing before an en
thusiastic home crowd. lowa
State was runner-up with
557.65, followed by Oregon at
553.45.
Hartung and his teammates
dominated the NCAAs, but
lowa State's Ron Galimore
glowed in his own share of the
limelight — he matched Bo De
rek's "10" rating with a perfect
vaulting score on Saturday.

"They (Bostick and Goldman)
both did very well — when you
go to the big competition like
this, there are so many good
gymnasts and the scoring gets
tough — strict but fair. It was a
good experience and I'm espe
cially glad that Tad went since
he's a senior. Craig has one more
year left and he'll probably do
really well next year.
According to Hamada, Lin
coln thought the NCAAs were
gym dandy, with 22,000 spec
tators watching in three days,
cheering like a football crowd
and giving the Husker athletes
standing ovations. With radio,
TV and print coverage, "the en
tire city was talking about gym
nastics," Hamada said. "There's
a good chance of having another
NCAA championship meet
there next year."
At the AIAWs, sophomore
Karen Hall earned 22nd in all
around in a field of 98 gymnasts
with a score of 34.80. After three
of the five sessions of competi
tion, she was in fifth place and
was eighth after four sessions,
according to coach Jackie
Walker.
UCLA's Sharon Shapiro cap
tured the all-around title with
38.00 points and an unpre
cedented first place finish in all
four events in both preliminary
and final competition. The only
flaw in an otherwise consistently

and attitude," Walker said. "She
went for the whole thing and
didn't hold back. She's ready to
go for next season."
Just two days after the end of a
three-month-long season, Hall
was working out at Encina Gym.
more inspired than ever about
both the team's and her own po
tential for next year.
"It was very exciting to see
how well UCLA did. — since we
beat them during the regular sea
son," Walker added. "We would
have been in the top 10 with the
talent we have, without our in
juries. It's encouraging for next
year."
While the overall level of
competitiveness has dramatically
increased in both men's and wo
men's gymnastics, the situation
was clearly evident in the high
scores and narrow margins bet
ween finishers at the AIAWs.
At the NorCal Conference
Championships, Hall garnered

top honors in all-around with
35.K5 points. California's Jill
Hansen finished third with 34.40
points, hut at nationals a similar
difference in performance was
5 1 places — Hansen qualified as
an at-large entrant and earned
73rd in all around.
While "what would have hap
pened if" stories don't change
the outcome at all. Walker noted
how a .5 of a pyint would have
made a dramatic difference. Hall
finished 26th (8.50) on uneven
parallel bars with a fall on her
dismount — without the deduc
tion for the fall, she would have
placed seventh. On beam she
was 28th with an 8.60 and
another fall she would have had
9.10 and second place.
Regardless of the "what ifs,"
just placing in the nationals is
quite an achievement and with
her renewed inspiration, who
knows what next season will
bring?

At the AIAWs, sophomore
Karen Hall earned 22nd in all

both the team's and her own po
tential for next year.
"It was very exciting to see
how well UCLA did. — since we
beat them during the regular sea
son," Walker added. "We would
have been in the top 10 with the
talent we have, without our in
juries. It's encouraging for next

While the overall level of
competitiveness has dramatically
increased in both men's and wo
men's gymnastics, the situation
was clearly evident in the high
scores and narrow margins bet
ween finishers at the AIAWs.
At the NorCal Conference
Championships, Hall garnered

top honors in all-around with
35.K5 points. California's Jill
Hansen finished third with 34.40
points, hut at nationals a similar
difference in performance was
5 1 places — Hansen qualified as
an at-large entrant and earned
73rd in all around.
While "what would have hap
pened if" stories don't change
the outcome at all. Walker noted
how a .5 of a pyint would have
made a dramatic difference. Hall
finished 26th (8.50) on uneven
parallel bars with a fall on her
dismount — without the deduc
tion for the fall, she would have
placed seventh. On beam she
was 28th with an 8.60 and
another fall she would have had
9.10 and second place.
Regardless of the "what ifs,"
just placing in the nationals is
quite an achievement and with
her renewed inspiration, who

Junior ring specialist Craig Goldman, shown here competing
at a Maples meet with UC-Davis, placed 48th in the NCAA
Championships held at Lincoln, Nebraska, last Thursday
through Saturday.
Stanford placed a trio of gym
nasts in two national champion
ships last weekend — the
NCAAs at Lincoln, Nebraska
and the AIAWs in Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.
In the men's competition,
junior Craig Goldman finished
48th in his specialty, the still
rings, with a 9.05 optional score.
Senior Tad Bostick recorded a
50.10 compulsory all-around
sum and 52.35 points in optional
competition to earn 27th place.
Nebraska's Jim Hartung top
ped the all-around competition
Friday night with a NCAA re
cord of 58.025 points in the six
events. Hartung's effort broke
the previous mark of 57.70 set by
former Indiana State star Kurt
Thomas last year, and paced the
Cornhuskers to their second
straight national team title.
With a 563.30 point total,
Nebraska put together an impres
sive showing before an en
thusiastic home crowd. lowa
State was runner-up with
557.65, followed by Oregon at
553.45.
Hartung and his teammates
dominated the NCAAs, but
lowa State's Ron Galimore
glowed in his own share of the
limelight — he matched Bo De
rek's "10" rating with a perfect
vaulting score on Saturday.

"They (Bostick and Goldman)
both did very well — when you
go to the big competition like
this, there are so many good
gymnasts and the scoring gets
tough — strict but fair. It was a
good experience and I'm espe
cially glad that Tad went since
he's a senior. Craig has one more
year left and he'll probably do
really well next year.
According to Hamada, Lin
coln thought the NCAAs were
gym dandy, with 22,000 spec
tators watching in three days,
cheering like a football crowd
and giving the Husker athletes
standing ovations. With radio,
TV and print coverage, "the en
tire city was talking about gym
nastics," Hamada said. "There's
a good chance of having another
