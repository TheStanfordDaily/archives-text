LOS ANGELES — Two
weeks ago, the Stanford wo
men's tennis team put a real
scare to the No. 1 ranked Uni
\ ersity of Southern California
Trojans and outdualed UCLA
for a fifth-place finish in the
Biigham Young Invitational at
Provo, Utah
Hie Trojans remembered this
scare Friday and soundly
trounced the Cardinals 8-1. The
Bruins remembered their loss
Saturday, as they nearly beat the
Cards with an improved line-up.
but eventually lost 5-4.
Southern Cal bombed the
Cards and suffered their only
kiss in a marathon three-setter
between no. 2 single players
Donna Rubin of Stanford and
Anna Maria Fernandez of USC.
Rubin edged Fernandez 1-6,
2-6. 6-4 in a gritty, patient
backcourt struggle that lasted
well over two hours.
As the third set began, Ann
White of USC finished destroy
inu Lisa Gordon. 6-1. 6-0 on an

adjacent court — a court that
had already seen USC's Trey
Lewis clobber Alycia Moulton
6-2. 61 in number one singles.
Both matches, run successively
on the same court, were finished
as Rubin and Fernandez settled
into the third set.
In this third set, Rubin began
to return to her old self and
played with confidence while she
racked up a 5-3 lead and held on
for a 6-4 victory and the Cardi
nals' only win of the day.
In the number three singles.
Caryn Copeland also got mixed
up in a patient baseline struggle.
Copeland started her match
against Nina Voydat by serv ing
and volleying well. She jumped
out to a quick lead, but her game
began to falter and she was
forced into the baseline game.
Sue Rasmussen also played a
tough match before going down
to defeat in the number four sing
les spot. After falling behind 3-2
in the first set to Anna Lucia
Fernandez (Anna Maria's twin
sister), Rasmussen stormed back
to win four straight games and

win the first set 6-3.
Rasmussen's play tailed off
considerably in the second set,
however, as she again fell way
behind. This time she could not
come back, and her frustration
began to show as she let the sec
ond set slip away 6-2.
Things got progressively
worse for Rasmussen. She could
have pleaded nolo contendere in
the third as Fernandez totally
dominated play and snatched up
an easy 6-0 win.
After the win was clinched in
singles. USC continued to show
its dominance and swept the
doubles with three convincing
wins.
Lewis and White quickly put
away Moulton and Rasmussen
6-2.6-0. Anna Maria Fernandez
and Mclnerney edged Copeland
and Rubin 6-4, 6-4, and Susie
Brown and Anna Lucia Fernan
dez defeated Chan and Gordon
6-2, 6-2.
Saturday's match was a lot
closer. In fact, it went down to
the final doubles match of the
day, where Copeland and Rubin

won over Karin Huebner and
Lucy Gordon 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 as
rainclouds moved in, darkness
began to fall and the tempera
ture dropped.
Copeiand and Rubin
squeaked out the first set 7-5
after a very slow start. Copeiand
and Rubin again fell behind early
in the second set, but managed to
struggle back to within striking
distance before being set back
6-4.
Rainclouds began to form be
fore the third set, and darkness
would have been a definite factor
soon had Copeiand and Rubin
not finished off the set early.
After losing the first game, they
jumped to a 5-1 lead by playing
enthusiastically and totally dis
mantled Huebner and Gordon.
Huebner and Gordon managed
to scrap together two more
games before Copeiand and
Rubin clinched the 5-4 Stanford
victory with a 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 win.
Brennan was extremely
pleased with the win and espe
cially the third set showing by
Copeiand and Rubin. "They
played that third set great,"
Brennan explained. "The key in
the third set is to jump out to a
lead. Then even if they have a
comeback in th<bag, most of
the time they can't come back
enough."
Stanford also picked up an im
portant doubles win from Moul
ton and Rasmussen. After tying
UCLA 3-3 in the singles
matches, the Cards needed two
doubles wins to nail down the
victory.
Moulton and Rasmussen
dropped the first set 6-2 but
fought back to win the see-saw
second set 7-5.
Liz Stalder and Cindy
Campbell of UCLA won the
other doubles match over Chan
and Gordon, 6-0, 6-3.
Chan and Gordon, along with
Rasmussen in her other three-set
match, also lost their singles
matches. Rasmussen lost 6-1,
2-6, 6-1 to Becky Bell, Gordon
was beaten 6-1, 6-3 by Angela
Walker, and Chan fell 6-0,6-2 to
Stalder.
The first three singles plays for
Stanford, however, won. Moul
ton edged Kathy O'Brian 7-5,
6-3; Rubin coasted to a 6-3, 6-2
victory over Lucy Gordon; and
Caryn Copeiand won a pivotal
match with Huebner 6-3, 6-3.
"Caryn was really a key for us
this weekend," said Brennan,
"but our whole team pulled to
gether. Before today (Saturday
at UCLA) we had lost five in a
row, but we came back strong'
