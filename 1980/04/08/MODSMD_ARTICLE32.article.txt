# Netmen victorious twice
## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Coming back strongly after
last week's narrow loss to UC-
Berkelev. Stanford's men's ten
nis team scored two lopsided
Pac-10 victories over Arizona
State and Arizona. On Friday
against the Sun Devils, the Cards
swept the singles 6-0 and were
unable to play the doubles be
cause of darkness. Saturday.
Stanford rolled past the Wildcats
7-2.
Particularly impressive during
the matches was the play of Stan
ford's top two players, seniors
Peter Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne. Both men breezed
through their matches without
losing a set and appeared to be in
top form.
Coach Dick Gould, comment
ing on the team's play, noted.
"Overall 1 was very pleased with
the team's play, and 1 was par
ticularly pleased with Llovd and
Peter. Lloyd played perhaps his
two finest matches of the season,
and Peter played especially
tough. I was also very pleased
with the team's attitude coming
>ut of the loss to Cal. They seem
to be the type of team that can
earn from losses. The team's
character is going to carry this
team a long ways."

Against ASU, Rennert de
stroyed Tim Anderson 6-2.6-1,
and Bourne defeated Pal Bers
tein 6-2.7-5. Berstein. who nor
mally plays No. 1 for the Sun De
vils. has a win over USC No. 1
man Robert Vant' Hof. Against
the Wild Cats. Rennert and
Bourne were equally impressive
as the former cruised to a 6-2.6-4
victory, while the later chalked
up a 6-2. 6-1 trouncing.
Also impressive over the
weekend was the play of
freshman standout Dave Siegler,
who scored his first two Pac-10
singles victories. Playing No. 3
against ASU because of a hand
injury to Tim Mayotte. Siegler
beat Andy Krantz 6-0,3-6.6-0
using a strong serve and consis
tent ground strokes to compli
ment his serve-volley game.
Against Arizona. Siegler de
feated Andy Luters in another
three setter, 6-2.2-6,6-3.
In other action. Scott Bondur
ant scored two more victories to
extend his Pac-10 singles mark
to 3-0. Jeff Arons split his
matches, winning a pair of tie
breakers Friday, and losing a
tough three-setter to Bill Moss of
Arizona, and Tim Mayotte, play
ing only against the Wildcats,
notched a 7-5,6-4 victory over
Ted Staren to extend his Pac-10

singles mark to 2-0. Freshman
Jim Gurfien also contributed to
the victories as he scored a
6-3,6-3 singles win against ASU
and paired with Greg Hing in
doubles on Saturday to score a
lopsided victory.
The Cards will see tougher ac
tion this weekend as they travel
to Southern California to face
USC and UCLA. Only once in
the last decade has Stanford
swept both matches in the smog
city, and that was in 1978 when
the Cards had Mr. John McEn
roe leading the charge.
USC is currently ranked No. 7
in the country and UCLA is tied
with Stanford for No. 2.
