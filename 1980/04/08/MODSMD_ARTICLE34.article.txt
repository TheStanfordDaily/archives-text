Letters of intent
By tomorrow afternoon, Stan
ford basketball coach Dick Di-
Biaso and his staff will know
whether or not their long, hard
hours of recruiting have paid off.
For tomorrow is the first day that
high school basketball players
may announce their letters of in
tent to colleges.
According to the grapevine of
high school and college coaches
who take a serious interest in
hundreds of players, Stanford
will fare very well in the recruit
ing game this year.
By all reports, Dißiaso has all
but signed Hans Wichary, the
6-9 San Diego native who gained
all-city honors this season, and
was considered one of the West
Coast's top prospects after his
junior year.
Dißiaso is also reported to
have commitments from Keith
Jones, Arizona's Class AAA
player of the year, and 6-5 Roger
Lemons, a second-team all-star
in the Los Angeles-Orange
County area.
Stanford remains in the run
ning for other high school stand
outs as well. The best known is
6-7 Barry Spencer, the Detroit
area blue-chipper who might be
able to turn the Stanford prog
ram around on his own.
Two players from Scarsdale,
N.Y., 6-7 John Rivelli and 6-3
Butch Graves, and 6-6 Alex
Stivrins of Lincoln, Neb., are po
tential Cardinals, all of whom
have been rated in the country's
top 300 players.
Rowers victorious
In a 2000-meter race at Red
wood Shores, added to the spring
schedule following the cancella
tion of the San Diego Crew Clas

sic, the Stanford varsity crew
team showed good early-season
strength Saturday, defeating
Loyola-Marymount by one
third
The strong headwind that had
slowed the earlier second varsity
and freshman duels died to a
whisper as the Stanford team
jumped off to almost a full length
lead with a blazing start at well
over 40 strokes per minute.
Although challenged several
times, Stanford held on with
three power tens to finish ahead
in the very respectable early
season time of 6 min. 15.2 sec.
Although no record, that time
augurs well for future races, as it
was faster than the Cards could
achieve on the course at any
point last year. In fact, if the crew
can improve by just one foot per
stroke, Coach Phil Waters (Stan
ford '55) predicts their time
would be under 6 minutes.
Next week all Stanford crews
— men's, women's, heavyweight
and lightweights — will race in
the annual Findlay Cup Regatta
at Redwood Shores (not Red
wood Harbor, where practices
are conducted).
Races will start at 8 a.m. and
end at 11:30 a.m. The men's var
sity race will start at 11 a.m.
Easy Cricket Win

hours of recruiting have paid off.
For tomorrow is the first day that
high school basketball players
may announce their letters of in
tent to colleges.
According to the grapevine of
high school and college coaches
who take a serious interest in
hundreds of players, Stanford
will fare very well in the recruit
ing game this year.
By all reports, Dißiaso has all
but signed Hans Wichary, the
6-9 San Diego native who gained
all-city honors this season, and
was considered one of the West
Coast's top prospects after his
junior year.
Dißiaso is also reported to
have commitments from Keith
Jones, Arizona's Class AAA
player of the year, and 6-5 Roger
Lemons, a second-team all-star
in the Los Angeles-Orange
County area.
Stanford remains in the run
ning for other high school stand
outs as well. The best known is
6-7 Barry Spencer, the Detroit
area blue-chipper who might be
able to turn the Stanford prog
ram around on his own.
Two players from Scarsdale,
N.Y., 6-7 John Rivelli and 6-3
Butch Graves, and 6-6 Alex
Stivrins of Lincoln, Neb., are po
tential Cardinals, all of whom
have been rated in the country's
top 300 players.
Rowers victorious
In a 2000-meter race at Red
wood Shores, added to the spring
schedule following the cancella
tion of the San Diego Crew Clas

sic, the Stanford varsity crew
team showed good early-season
strength Saturday, defeating
Loyola-Marymount by one
third
The strong headwind that had
slowed the earlier second varsity
and freshman duels died to a
whisper as the Stanford team
jumped off to almost a full length
lead with a blazing start at well
over 40 strokes per minute.
Although challenged several
times, Stanford held on with
three power tens to finish ahead
in the very respectable early
season time of 6 min. 15.2 sec.
Although no record, that time
augurs well for future races, as it
was faster than the Cards could
achieve on the course at any
point last year. In fact, if the crew
can improve by just one foot per
stroke, Coach Phil Waters (Stan
ford '55) predicts their time
would be under 6 minutes.
Next week all Stanford crews
— men's, women's, heavyweight
and lightweights — will race in
the annual Findlay Cup Regatta
at Redwood Shores (not Red
wood Harbor, where practices
are conducted).
Races will start at 8 a.m. and
end at 11:30 a.m. The men's var
sity race will start at 11 a.m.
