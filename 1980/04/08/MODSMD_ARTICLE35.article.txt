In men's volleyball UCLA and
Long Beach State are considered
two of the top teams in the coun
try.
Stanford discovered how ac
curate these rankings are as it
dropped two matches in South
ern California over the weekend.
Friday night UCLA swept three
games in a row from the Cardi
nals, winning 15-2, 15-4 and
15-12, while on Saturday Long
Beach State took the first two
games 15-8 and 15-6, losing the
third one 15-8. The 49ers domi
nated the next game 15-0 to win
the match.
The Cardinals' record fell to
6-10 overall and 4-10 in confer
ence play.
Analyzing the loss to UCLA,
coach Fred Sturm remarked,
"UCLA and Long Beach played
really well. Our block formation
against UCLA was really good.
UCLA served aggressively and
effectively, they shut out our of
fense, which is what we depend
on most."

As for Saturday night's match.
Sturm observed, "We played
good offense against Long Beach
State."
Pointing out specific prob
lems, the coaches remarked,
"Our transition from offense to
defense needs to be brought up a
bit," adding that a couple of rota
tions are going to be changed
around.
"When you're playing the best
teams, your weaknesses are dis
covered easily. That's what's
good about playing them,"
Sturm said.
For individual performances
the coach recognized sophomore
setter Kip Engen, senior power
hitter Rod Fletcher, and
freshman hitter Andrew Dodds.
"Kip set a good system Saturday
and made some good defensive
saves. Fletcher did an all-around
good job, and Dodds did a good
job for us," he said.
Fletcher, the team captain, be
lieves that the squad has diffi
culty playing up to potential

against the stronger schools.
"We didn't play particularly well
this weekend. We do well against
the teams we're supposed to, but
against the teams we're expected
to lose to, we do. A lot of it is
mental," he said.
One reason for this difficulty is
that the strong teams don't pro
vide much of a chance to come
back once a team is behind, ac
cording to Fletcher. "For one
thing, the good teams are good.
They make it hard for us to gen
erate any momentum. Our team
is very athletic, but they (UCLA
and Long Beach State) are more
fundamentally sound because
their players have more
volleyball-oriented back
grounds," he said.
Commenting on the progress
of the team to date, Fletcher
pointed out, "It's all relative.
We've improved a heck of a lot,
but as we get better they get bet
ter. Through it all we've stayed
together very well. It's easy to
stay together when you're win
ning. but some teams fall apart
when they lose.
