# Booters down Santa Clara
## 
### Jennifer Seymour Staff Writer 
The Stanford women's soccer team's last two
games had little in common besides the fact that
they were both played on a green field.
After overwhelming a slow and sloppy Santa
Clara 6-1 on Thursday, Stanford fell to Davis
3-0 on Sunday in this season's most rigorous
match yet.
On Thursday, Stanford outshot Santa Clara
34-8, and held play to Santa Clara's side about
70 percent of the time. On Sunday, Davis out
shot Stanford 26 to 20, and play rested mostly in
Stanford territory, though it was about split in
the second half.
Goals in Thursday's rout were scored by
Cindy Shorney, Kathy Carey, Kim Gaumer,
Lisa Steinkamp, Catherine Morris, and Sue
Handel. On Sunday, scoring remained Davis's
treat.
Card goals against SC were mostly taken in
the penalty box off wing crosses. Although the
offense threw away several easy fast-break scor
ing opportunities, Lisa Steinkamp and Kathy
Carey put in exceptional goals on long shots
from outside the penalty box.
But against Davis, Stanford was unable to
penetrate the Aggies' immutable fullback line.
Even in the second half when Stanford outshot
Davis 13-6 the numerous quick-pass combina
tions generated from Card midfielders stopped
short of the goalie.
â€¢ Santa Clara's goal was won on an indirect
penalty kick, called against Stanford for hands
in the penalty area. In general, Thursday's play
consisted ot long drop-passes into Card territ
ory by Santa Clara and goal-shooting by Stan
ford.
In contrast to this relatively lethargic game,
Sunday's battle with Davis displayed rapid-fire

passing and shooting for all 90 minutes of play.
Davis exploded into Cardinal territory im
mediately, taking five shots after only five mi
nutes of play. They continued to dominate dur
ing the first half, outshooting the Cards 16-7.
Davis knocked in their three goals here, all vol
ley shots from high center kicks.
Why the change from Thursday's domination
to Sunday's struggle? Stanford was in part hin
dered by the injury of their goalie early in the
first half. But her substitute, Martha Watson,
played a very effective game. In general, Stan
ford fell behind by being one step too late on
beating Davis to leading passes.
The second half brought a real upstep in Stan
ford speed and finess. The game became a
rapid-fire string of quick two-touch passes,
tackles, and many near-goals for Stanford. But
the Cards finally capitulated to Davis.
This puts Stanford at 5-1 in their league, hav
ing defeated Chico, Berkeley, Santa Cruz,
Humboldt, and Santa Clara. Stanford, Berkeley
and Davis are currently tied for first, a race
perhaps to be resolved in this weekend's
Westmont Tournament at Santa Barbara.
Stanford's second team also played Sunday, a
game ending with a more favorable 1-1 tie. This
draw was especially gratifying to Stanford after
having swallowed a 4-0 loss to Davis two weeks
ago.
In this game, Cindy Pillsbury, leading the
team as center/forward, put in Stanford's goal
with 12 minutes left to play. Davis tied it up four
minutes later.
Although not a victory, the game was Stan
ford's best yet: "We all played really well. We
were working together and dominating the
whole time," said Pillsbury. "It was by far our
best game."
