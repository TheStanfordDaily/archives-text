# Cal stuns USC in double-dual
## Bruins crunch men's track team 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
After 37 years of trying, the
Golden Bears of California upset
USC 84-70 in double-dual ac
tion at Stanford Stadium Satur
day.
In the other half of the meet,
UCLA, No. 2 in the Pac-10,
trounced Stanford 120-33.
Cal proved to the track and
field community just how far
they have come with their prog
ram as Paul Bates triple jumped
for 52 feet, 5V4 inches and put
the Bears ahead for the last time
in the meet. Hal Schulz won the
5000-meters at 14:3 1.8, and Cal
won the mile relay at 3:10.5 to
seal up the victory.
There were a couple of sur
prises for Cal in the meet which
certainly helped them surprise
the Trojans. The biggest was that
the Bears didn't expect any
points in the 400-meters until
freshman walk-on Garry Kelly
crossed the line second to Rod
Bethany in a photo-finish.
Stanford was not so fortunate
in their meet. The Cards were
somewhat embarrassed by
UCLA, though the Bruins are
one of the best dual meet teams
in the country. UCLA is number
two in the Pac-10 behind peren
nial great Oregon, but it is a very
close second. Stanford head
coach Brooks Johnson said yes
terday, "Looking at the results

from Oregon's meet this
weekend, UCLA looks like the
better team to me."
Concerning Saturday's meet
itself, Johnson said, "This gives
us an indication of how far we
have to go. UCLA is a very well
balanced team, one of the best in
the nation. Saturday showed us
the kinds of things we have to
work on."
Overall, the Cards didn't have
a very good day, even looking
beyond the loss to their own
standards. In the scoring events,
Stanford took only one first
place, and that was a tie for first.
It came in the 800-meters when
Cardinal John Schaer and Bruin
Jeff West broke the tape to
gether at 1:49.3
In probably the most exciting
race of the meet, Steve Whit
comb of UCLA edged Tom Lob
singer of Stanford by a tenth of a
second in the 1500, 3:46.0 to
3:46.1, after exchanging leads
four times in the final lap.
Rick Buss was the only Cardi
nal who really performed up to
potential. In a hammerthrow
exhibition. Buss tossed to his
lifetime best at 215-10.
"It was kind of a bad day for
the rest of the team," Johnson
said. "We had four good meets
in a row before this, and then we
slipped. I don't really know
why." Then he added, "The Cal
victory was very heartening for

us. They've had periods when
they were low and they showed
they can pull out of it. They've
been building; so can we."
Stanford's best will have a
chance to keep on improving
next weekend at the Bruce Jen
ner Classic in San Jose. Stanford
will send Darrin Nelson (100
meters), John Schaer (800),
Tom Lobsinger (1500), Bill Gail
and Bill Haldeman (Steeplech
ase), Rick Buss (Hammer, Dis
cus) and Dave Thomson (Dis
cus).
