Carter, Sadat meet in summit
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter,
beset by a new rebuff from Iran, will be striving
for new success in the Middle East in his summit
talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat over
some form of self-rule for more than 1 million
Palestinian Arabs.
Sadat's arrival late yesterday at Andrews Air
Force Base in suburban Maryland touches off two
busy weeks in which Carter will try to accommo
date Israel's security concerns with Palestinian
aspirations for a homeland.
The Egyptian leader will be followed to
Washington next week by Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, with the May 26 target date tor
completing an autonomy plan only five weeks
away.
Already, there is an air of crisis here and in
other world capitals. Ten rounds of Egvptian-
Israeli negotiations have left all major issues un
resolved. There is political pressure on all three
principals — Carter. Sadat and Begin — to pro
duce.
With the stalemate at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran now in its fifth month. Carter's campaign
for reelection could use a foreign policy I it t. The
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty signed last year was
a crowning achievement, and the president hopes
to maintain the momentum by promoting an ag
reement on the Palestinians.
Sadat, who broke ranks with the anti-Israeli
front in the Arab world when he signed the earlier
pact, is eager to prove his fidelity by winning a
foothold for the Palestinians.
Reagan gets expected boost
While Oklahoma Republicans were giving an
expected boost to Ronald Reagan s high-flying
presidential campaign. Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), fought yesterday for voter support in
the crucial Pennsylvania primary two weeks
away. "I don't get into a battle to lose it."he
declared.
Those were brave words for a candidate w hose
Pennsylvania campaign coordinator all but says
the state's April 22 primary battle with President
Jimmv Carter could be Kennedy 's last stand it the
Massachusetts senator doesn't do well there.
"It'sdo or diein my book.'" said Mike Ford, the
Kennedy strategist. "To me it's the most impor
tant thing in the world. To the campaign, it's close
to that."
On the Republican side, a spokesman for
George Bush expressed a similar view ot the
Pennsylvania contest.
Because of its importance to their catch-up
efforts, both Kennedy and Bush planned to cam
paign intensively in Pennsylvania. Kennedy's
schedule had him in Pennsylvania yesterday, to
day. Saturday and Sunday. Bush planned to ap
pear there today and stay for the rest of the week.
Rep. John Anderson of Illinois, the other Re

publican challenger, failed to get on Pennsyl
vania's primary ballot but he has mustered a
write-in campaign.
In Oklahoma. Reagan demolished his oppo
nents in a non-binding preferential poll taken at
last night's Oklahoma Republican precinct cau
cuses. thereby assuring himself of virtually all of
the state's 34 delegates to the GOP national con
vention.
Reagan was taking about 90 percent of the
votes cast with about 10 percent of the precincts
reporting.
With 1 1 of the 77 counties reporting, Reagan
had 315 votes, with Anderson a distant second
with 12. Bush was third with 10 votes. Bush and
Anderson each receiv ed less than four percent of
the votes cast.
7 left dead in Israeli dorm raid
JERUSALEM — Israeli army commandoes
stormed a children's dormitory in a kibbutz near
the Lebanese border yesterday to free hostages
seized by Palestinian terrorists nine hours earlier.
All five terrorists and two Israelis, including a
2-year-old child, died during the long siege and
the desperation attack.
Elev en Israeli soldiers and four children were
wounded at Kibbutz Misgav Am during the pas
sover holiday drama. It was the worst Palestinian
guerrilla attack in Israel in a year.
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman issued a vei
led warning of Israeli retaliation against
Lebanese-based guerrilla strongholds, telling re
porters, "You'll all hear about it afterwards, not
before." He said the army would "weigh steps to
be taken."
In the past, major Palestinian terrorist raids on
civilian targets in Israel have been followed by
retaliatory air strikes and naval bombardments of
Palestine Liberation Organization positions in
Lebanon. Die PLO in Beirut said Israeli aircraft
flew over the Lebanese capital later today and
that PLO anti-aircraft batteries opened fire.
The Iraqi-supported Arab Liberation Front
(ALF). a radical PLO splinter group, claimed
responsibility for the attack on the upper Galilee
kibbutz, which is just south of the Israeli border
town of Metulla. In a statement issued in Bagdad,
the ALF said it sought the release of 50 Palesti
nian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.
Radiation found in TMI wells
HARRISBURG. Pa. — Traces of radiation,
possibly from the leakage of severely contami
nated water, have been found in test wells drilled
around the base of Three Mile Island's damaged
nuclear reactor containment building, officials at
the power plant said yesterday.
Plant operators said they would not rule out the
possibility that some of the severely contami
nated water in the building has begun to leak out
for the first time since the March 28, 1979, acci

dent at the plant's Unit 2 reactor.
But a statement issued by the plant said the
radioactivity was more likely from a large outside
storage tank that holds mildly contaminated cool
ing water for TMl's undamaged and idle Unit 1
facility.
"Last week, water samples from three of eight
wells had tritium levels about two to five times
greater than normal background," said the
statement.
"Although the activity for these two elements
is above background levels, the concentration is
about 10 percent of the Environmental Protec
tion Agency's drinking water guidelines," it said.
Tlie statement said no unusual radiation has
been found in the Susquehanna River
downstream from the plant.
Cubans can seek refuge in U.S.
WASHINGTON — The United States will
offer refuge to thousands of Cubans who have
swarmed into the Peruvian embassy in Havana if
they can first get to Peru, a State Department
spokesman said yesterday.
However, "we have no information that these
people want to go any where but to Peru," the
spokesman said of the 7000 to 10,000 persons
who took advantage of a change of policy by the
Castro government to seek asylum at the em
bassy. Reversing its previous stand against per
mitting Cubans to seek asylum in foreign embas
sies, the Castro regime removed its guards from
the Peruvian embassy Friday after one of them
was killed when six persons in a bus crashed
through the fence at the Peruvian ambassador's
residence.
As the word spread, the compound in Havana's
elegant Miramar district quickly became a
packed refugee camp.
In Lima. Peruvian Foreign Minister Arturo
Garcia appealed for help from the international
community, saying he had called on the Interna
tional Committee of the Red Cross for food and
shejter for the unexpected "guests" in the em
bassy.
Soviets launch satellite weapon
WASHINGTON — In a move signalling re
sumption of a space arms race, the Soviet Union
rocketed a target satellite into orbit last week that
its anti-satellite "hunter-killer" weapon is ex
pected to try to destroy within a few days, De
partment of Defense officials said yesterday.
Resumed flights of the anti-satellite weapon,
which only the Soviets now possess, would end a
two-year test moratorium during which Soviet-
American negotiations toward banning such
arms have been held. The United States is at least
three years behind in its work toward such a
weapon.
The new Soviet tests are a further setback to
the SALT II treaty, whose ratification process in

Congress was suspended when Soviet forces in
vaded Afghanistan.
The Soviets are believed to have suspended
testing at least partly to facilitate passage of the
strategic arms limitation treaty, according to U.S.
officials. Policing the treaty would be done with
reconnaissance satellites that would be ripe
targets for the Soviet anti-satellite weapon.
Flaunting that capability in tests while SALT
was being considered would have had an adverse
effect in Congress on the fate of the treaty, offi
cials said. Thus, resumed flights now can be taken
as a sign that the Soviets have written off the
treaty, they said.
Legislator 'finds' census errors
SACRAMENTO — One Northern California
census map had half a city missing, and bilingual
census forms are printed in the wrong kind of
Spanish, a Hispanic legislator said yesterday.
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los
Angeles) said he has sent a telegram to President
Jimmy Carter and federal census officials claim
ing "major administrative errors" in the census.
The result, he said, could be a loss of millions of
dollars to California from under-counting of its
population.
Alatorre said maps sent to local district offices
were as much as four weeks late, and the error
rate on those maps was as high as 50 percent.
One map omitted half of a Northern California
city, while another, also in Northern California,
showed no housing units in a suburban commun
ity with "row upon row of houses," he said.
He said he would identify the communities
later in the day, but his office said later he had
decided not to reveal the names for fear of
jeopardizing the jobs of employees who had told
him of the incidents.
Alatorre said Spanish-language versions of the
census were printed in formal Castilian rather
than everyday Spanish, and that many Spanish
speaking people would find them hard to under
stand.
Judy Kerri, Sacramento County manager for
the census, said nationwide computer problems
had caused delays in maps and some paychecks,
but she knew of no major errors in the maps.

While Oklahoma Republicans were giving an
expected boost to Ronald Reagan s high-flying
presidential campaign. Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), fought yesterday for voter support in
the crucial Pennsylvania primary two weeks

declared.
Those were brave words for a candidate w hose
Pennsylvania campaign coordinator all but says
the state's April 22 primary battle with President
Jimmv Carter could be Kennedy 's last stand it the
Massachusetts senator doesn't do well there.
"It'sdo or diein my book.'" said Mike Ford, the
Kennedy strategist. "To me it's the most impor
tant thing in the world. To the campaign, it's close
to that."
On the Republican side, a spokesman for
George Bush expressed a similar view ot the
Pennsylvania contest.
Because of its importance to their catch-up
efforts, both Kennedy and Bush planned to cam
paign intensively in Pennsylvania. Kennedy's
schedule had him in Pennsylvania yesterday, to
day. Saturday and Sunday. Bush planned to ap
pear there today and stay for the rest of the week.
Rep. John Anderson of Illinois, the other Re

publican challenger, failed to get on Pennsyl

write-in campaign.
In Oklahoma. Reagan demolished his oppo

last night's Oklahoma Republican precinct cau

With 1 1 of the 77 counties reporting, Reagan
had 315 votes, with Anderson a distant second
with 12. Bush was third with 10 votes. Bush and

7 left dead in Israeli dorm raid
JERUSALEM — Israeli army commandoes
stormed a children's dormitory in a kibbutz near
the Lebanese border yesterday to free hostages
seized by Palestinian terrorists nine hours earlier.
All five terrorists and two Israelis, including a
2-year-old child, died during the long siege and
the desperation attack.
Elev en Israeli soldiers and four children were
wounded at Kibbutz Misgav Am during the pas
sover holiday drama. It was the worst Palestinian
guerrilla attack in Israel in a year.
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman issued a vei
led warning of Israeli retaliation against
Lebanese-based guerrilla strongholds, telling re
porters, "You'll all hear about it afterwards, not
before." He said the army would "weigh steps to
be taken."
In the past, major Palestinian terrorist raids on
civilian targets in Israel have been followed by
retaliatory air strikes and naval bombardments of
Palestine Liberation Organization positions in
Lebanon. Die PLO in Beirut said Israeli aircraft
flew over the Lebanese capital later today and
that PLO anti-aircraft batteries opened fire.
The Iraqi-supported Arab Liberation Front
(ALF). a radical PLO splinter group, claimed
responsibility for the attack on the upper Galilee
kibbutz, which is just south of the Israeli border
town of Metulla. In a statement issued in Bagdad,
the ALF said it sought the release of 50 Palesti
nian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.
Radiation found in TMI wells
HARRISBURG. Pa. — Traces of radiation,
possibly from the leakage of severely contami
nated water, have been found in test wells drilled
around the base of Three Mile Island's damaged
nuclear reactor containment building, officials at
the power plant said yesterday.
Plant operators said they would not rule out the
possibility that some of the severely contami
nated water in the building has begun to leak out
for the first time since the March 28, 1979, acci

dent at the plant's Unit 2 reactor.
But a statement issued by the plant said the
radioactivity was more likely from a large outside
storage tank that holds mildly contaminated cool
ing water for TMl's undamaged and idle Unit 1
facility.
"Last week, water samples from three of eight
wells had tritium levels about two to five times
greater than normal background," said the
statement.
"Although the activity for these two elements
is above background levels, the concentration is
about 10 percent of the Environmental Protec
tion Agency's drinking water guidelines," it said.
Tlie statement said no unusual radiation has
been found in the Susquehanna River
downstream from the plant.
Cubans can seek refuge in U.S.
WASHINGTON — The United States will
offer refuge to thousands of Cubans who have
swarmed into the Peruvian embassy in Havana if
they can first get to Peru, a State Department
spokesman said yesterday.
However, "we have no information that these
people want to go any where but to Peru," the
spokesman said of the 7000 to 10,000 persons
who took advantage of a change of policy by the
Castro government to seek asylum at the em
bassy. Reversing its previous stand against per
mitting Cubans to seek asylum in foreign embas
sies, the Castro regime removed its guards from
the Peruvian embassy Friday after one of them
was killed when six persons in a bus crashed
through the fence at the Peruvian ambassador's
residence.
As the word spread, the compound in Havana's
elegant Miramar district quickly became a
packed refugee camp.
In Lima. Peruvian Foreign Minister Arturo
Garcia appealed for help from the international
community, saying he had called on the Interna
tional Committee of the Red Cross for food and
shejter for the unexpected "guests" in the em
bassy.
Soviets launch satellite weapon
WASHINGTON — In a move signalling re
sumption of a space arms race, the Soviet Union
rocketed a target satellite into orbit last week that
its anti-satellite "hunter-killer" weapon is ex
pected to try to destroy within a few days, De
partment of Defense officials said yesterday.
Resumed flights of the anti-satellite weapon,
which only the Soviets now possess, would end a
two-year test moratorium during which Soviet-
American negotiations toward banning such
arms have been held. The United States is at least
three years behind in its work toward such a
weapon.
The new Soviet tests are a further setback to
the SALT II treaty, whose ratification process in

Congress was suspended when Soviet forces in
vaded Afghanistan.
The Soviets are believed to have suspended
testing at least partly to facilitate passage of the
strategic arms limitation treaty, according to U.S.
officials. Policing the treaty would be done with
reconnaissance satellites that would be ripe
targets for the Soviet anti-satellite weapon.
Flaunting that capability in tests while SALT
was being considered would have had an adverse
effect in Congress on the fate of the treaty, offi
cials said. Thus, resumed flights now can be taken
as a sign that the Soviets have written off the
treaty, they said.
Legislator 'finds' census errors
SACRAMENTO — One Northern California
census map had half a city missing, and bilingual
census forms are printed in the wrong kind of
Spanish, a Hispanic legislator said yesterday.
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los
Angeles) said he has sent a telegram to President
Jimmy Carter and federal census officials claim
ing "major administrative errors" in the census.
The result, he said, could be a loss of millions of
dollars to California from under-counting of its
population.
Alatorre said maps sent to local district offices
were as much as four weeks late, and the error
rate on those maps was as high as 50 percent.
One map omitted half of a Northern California
city, while another, also in Northern California,
showed no housing units in a suburban commun
ity with "row upon row of houses," he said.
He said he would identify the communities
later in the day, but his office said later he had
decided not to reveal the names for fear of
jeopardizing the jobs of employees who had told
him of the incidents.
Alatorre said Spanish-language versions of the
census were printed in formal Castilian rather
than everyday Spanish, and that many Spanish
speaking people would find them hard to under
stand.
Judy Kerri, Sacramento County manager for
the census, said nationwide computer problems
had caused delays in maps and some paychecks,
but she knew of no major errors in the maps.

WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter,
beset by a new rebuff from Iran, will be striving
for new success in the Middle East in his summit
talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat over
some form of self-rule for more than 1 million
Palestinian Arabs.

7 left dead in Israeli dorm raid
JERUSALEM — Israeli army commandoes
stormed a children's dormitory in a kibbutz near
the Lebanese border yesterday to free hostages
seized by Palestinian terrorists nine hours earlier.
All five terrorists and two Israelis, including a
2-year-old child, died during the long siege and
the desperation attack.
Elev en Israeli soldiers and four children were
wounded at Kibbutz Misgav Am during the pas
sover holiday drama. It was the worst Palestinian
guerrilla attack in Israel in a year.
Defense Minister Ezer Weizman issued a vei
led warning of Israeli retaliation against
Lebanese-based guerrilla strongholds, telling re
porters, "You'll all hear about it afterwards, not
before." He said the army would "weigh steps to
be taken."
In the past, major Palestinian terrorist raids on
civilian targets in Israel have been followed by
retaliatory air strikes and naval bombardments of
Palestine Liberation Organization positions in
Lebanon. Die PLO in Beirut said Israeli aircraft
flew over the Lebanese capital later today and
that PLO anti-aircraft batteries opened fire.
The Iraqi-supported Arab Liberation Front
(ALF). a radical PLO splinter group, claimed
responsibility for the attack on the upper Galilee
kibbutz, which is just south of the Israeli border
town of Metulla. In a statement issued in Bagdad,
the ALF said it sought the release of 50 Palesti
nian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.
Radiation found in TMI wells
HARRISBURG. Pa. — Traces of radiation,
possibly from the leakage of severely contami
nated water, have been found in test wells drilled
around the base of Three Mile Island's damaged
nuclear reactor containment building, officials at
the power plant said yesterday.
Plant operators said they would not rule out the
possibility that some of the severely contami
nated water in the building has begun to leak out
for the first time since the March 28, 1979, acci

dent at the plant's Unit 2 reactor.
But a statement issued by the plant said the
radioactivity was more likely from a large outside
storage tank that holds mildly contaminated cool
ing water for TMl's undamaged and idle Unit 1
facility.
"Last week, water samples from three of eight
wells had tritium levels about two to five times
greater than normal background," said the
statement.
"Although the activity for these two elements
is above background levels, the concentration is
about 10 percent of the Environmental Protec
tion Agency's drinking water guidelines," it said.
Tlie statement said no unusual radiation has
been found in the Susquehanna River
downstream from the plant.
Cubans can seek refuge in U.S.
WASHINGTON — The United States will
offer refuge to thousands of Cubans who have
swarmed into the Peruvian embassy in Havana if
they can first get to Peru, a State Department
spokesman said yesterday.
However, "we have no information that these
people want to go any where but to Peru," the
spokesman said of the 7000 to 10,000 persons
who took advantage of a change of policy by the
Castro government to seek asylum at the em
bassy. Reversing its previous stand against per
mitting Cubans to seek asylum in foreign embas
sies, the Castro regime removed its guards from
the Peruvian embassy Friday after one of them
was killed when six persons in a bus crashed
through the fence at the Peruvian ambassador's
residence.
As the word spread, the compound in Havana's
elegant Miramar district quickly became a
packed refugee camp.
In Lima. Peruvian Foreign Minister Arturo
Garcia appealed for help from the international
community, saying he had called on the Interna
tional Committee of the Red Cross for food and
shejter for the unexpected "guests" in the em
bassy.
Soviets launch satellite weapon
WASHINGTON — In a move signalling re
sumption of a space arms race, the Soviet Union
rocketed a target satellite into orbit last week that
its anti-satellite "hunter-killer" weapon is ex
pected to try to destroy within a few days, De
partment of Defense officials said yesterday.
Resumed flights of the anti-satellite weapon,
which only the Soviets now possess, would end a
two-year test moratorium during which Soviet-
American negotiations toward banning such
arms have been held. The United States is at least
three years behind in its work toward such a
weapon.
The new Soviet tests are a further setback to
the SALT II treaty, whose ratification process in

Congress was suspended when Soviet forces in
vaded Afghanistan.
The Soviets are believed to have suspended
testing at least partly to facilitate passage of the
strategic arms limitation treaty, according to U.S.
officials. Policing the treaty would be done with
reconnaissance satellites that would be ripe
targets for the Soviet anti-satellite weapon.
Flaunting that capability in tests while SALT
was being considered would have had an adverse
effect in Congress on the fate of the treaty, offi
cials said. Thus, resumed flights now can be taken
as a sign that the Soviets have written off the
treaty, they said.
Legislator 'finds' census errors
SACRAMENTO — One Northern California
census map had half a city missing, and bilingual
census forms are printed in the wrong kind of
Spanish, a Hispanic legislator said yesterday.
Assemblyman Richard Alatorre (D-Los
Angeles) said he has sent a telegram to President
Jimmy Carter and federal census officials claim
ing "major administrative errors" in the census.
The result, he said, could be a loss of millions of
dollars to California from under-counting of its
population.
Alatorre said maps sent to local district offices
were as much as four weeks late, and the error
rate on those maps was as high as 50 percent.
One map omitted half of a Northern California
city, while another, also in Northern California,
showed no housing units in a suburban commun
ity with "row upon row of houses," he said.
He said he would identify the communities
later in the day, but his office said later he had
decided not to reveal the names for fear of
jeopardizing the jobs of employees who had told
him of the incidents.
Alatorre said Spanish-language versions of the
census were printed in formal Castilian rather
than everyday Spanish, and that many Spanish
speaking people would find them hard to under
stand.
Judy Kerri, Sacramento County manager for
the census, said nationwide computer problems
had caused delays in maps and some paychecks,
but she knew of no major errors in the maps.

Carter, Sadat meet in summit
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter,
beset by a new rebuff from Iran, will be striving
for new success in the Middle East in his summit
talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat over
some form of self-rule for more than 1 million
Palestinian Arabs.
Sadat's arrival late yesterday at Andrews Air
Force Base in suburban Maryland touches off two
busy weeks in which Carter will try to accommo
date Israel's security concerns with Palestinian
aspirations for a homeland.
The Egyptian leader will be followed to
Washington next week by Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, with the May 26 target date tor
completing an autonomy plan only five weeks
away.
Already, there is an air of crisis here and in
other world capitals. Ten rounds of Egvptian-
Israeli negotiations have left all major issues un
resolved. There is political pressure on all three
principals — Carter. Sadat and Begin — to pro
duce.
With the stalemate at the U.S. Embassy in
Tehran now in its fifth month. Carter's campaign
for reelection could use a foreign policy I it t. The
Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty signed last year was
a crowning achievement, and the president hopes
to maintain the momentum by promoting an ag
reement on the Palestinians.
Sadat, who broke ranks with the anti-Israeli
front in the Arab world when he signed the earlier
pact, is eager to prove his fidelity by winning a
foothold for the Palestinians.
Reagan gets expected boost
While Oklahoma Republicans were giving an
expected boost to Ronald Reagan s high-flying
presidential campaign. Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass.), fought yesterday for voter support in
the crucial Pennsylvania primary two weeks
away. "I don't get into a battle to lose it."he
declared.
Those were brave words for a candidate w hose
Pennsylvania campaign coordinator all but says
the state's April 22 primary battle with President
Jimmv Carter could be Kennedy 's last stand it the
Massachusetts senator doesn't do well there.
"It'sdo or diein my book.'" said Mike Ford, the
Kennedy strategist. "To me it's the most impor
tant thing in the world. To the campaign, it's close
to that."
On the Republican side, a spokesman for
George Bush expressed a similar view ot the
Pennsylvania contest.
Because of its importance to their catch-up
efforts, both Kennedy and Bush planned to cam
paign intensively in Pennsylvania. Kennedy's
schedule had him in Pennsylvania yesterday, to
day. Saturday and Sunday. Bush planned to ap
