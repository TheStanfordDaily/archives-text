# Buckley defends conservative philosophy

### Nancy Koehn Staff Writer 
Noted conservative William F.
Buckley urged students to "renounce
the current progressive income tax as a
philosophical imperative" at a well
attended speech here last evening.
Speaking to an overflow crowd of
more than 600 in Cubberley Au
ditorium, the syndicated columnist said
that creating a society "in which A
meets with B to decide how much C will
give X is an infringement of the princi
ple on which democracy rests."
According to Buckley, the funda
mental principle of democracy is equal
ity. Quoting John Stuart Mill, Buckley
said the purpose of democracy is "to
treat all people alike even though they
are different."
By taxing those with higher incomes
at higher marginal tax rates, the current
tax system's differential treatment of
American citizens is inequitable and
thus undemocratic, according to
Buckley. In place of the progressive
U.S. income tax, he proposed al5 per
cent uniform tax.

In a 50-minute speech entitled,
"Some of the Problems of Freedom,"
Buckley asserted that current redis
tributive efforts of the United States
government "deprive citizens indis
criminately."
Lacing his address with witticisms,
the editor of National Review em
phasized the importance of the
philosophical rationale behind his con
servative position. "The primacy of the
philosophical arguments must be
acknowledged. These arguments are
extra-rational. They are not concerned
with productivity but with the rule of
law and the nature of man."
Buckley, also the host of the televi
sion talk show Firing Line, rejected the
redistributive functions of the progres
sive income tax as necessary to equalize
economic opportunities in the United
States. Fielding questions after the
speech, Buckley said "The obstacles to
upward mobility are a series of restric
tions by the government, a series of tax
liabilities and corporate taxes, a deple
tion of the dollar's value, and interest
rates of 18 or 20 percent."
He added that these obstacles are
"creatures of the public sector, which
has a different sense of priority than
that of the individual who is seeking
material prosperity. Our interest in na
tional well-being ought not to make us
afflict the comfortable."
Addressing the question of the re
surgence of conservatism. Buckley voi
ced an admittedly cautious response.
He noted that "conservatism is the
politics of reality. It seeks to inquire
after probable, if by no means predict
able, human behavior and reactions."
The Yale graduate criticized John
Kenneth Galbraith, former president
of the American Economics Associa
tion, for his support of wage and price
controls. Buckley called Galbraith "the
best critic of the free market place this
side of Pol Pot."
Buckley also criticized Sen. George
McGovern's liberal 1976 campaign for
president. According to Buckley,

McGovern's plan to award Americans
with average income below $12,000 a
subsidy of $1000 taken from people
with average incomes above $12,000
was the "most obvious example of a
'seizure' by a presidential candidate" in
recent times.
"Families earning $13,000 had
trouble fancying themselves philan
thropists," said Buckley of
McGovern's proposal. The author of
three books added, "McGovern was
the natural candidate of the incom
pletely educated." Buckley then added
wryly that he was not surprised that
McGovern garnered 90 percent of the

student vote at Yale, Buckley's alma
mater.
After the speech, Buckley told the
responsive audience that he supported
Ronald Reagan for president. Buckley
said, "I've been supporting Reagan
since I was a young man and he was a
middle-aged man." He added,
"Reagan has an intuitive sense of
priorities. I support him for the reasons
which make him dismayingly boring â€”
he has been saying the same things for
16 years. In 1964, Reagan noted the
ambitions of the Communist super
powers, the increasing unmanageabil-
ity of the central government and the
suffocating growth of the public sec
tor."
Buckley also decried a student
suggestion to cut defense spending as a
viable means of inflation control.
Buckley said, "I think turning the U.S.
government over to the Soviet Union is
an interesting proposal. If we had no
thing to defend, it would be a valid
proposal."
