# 'The Sentinel' abandons post

### 
A large wood sculpture mysteriously
disappeared from the second floor Tre
sidder lobby sometime Friday, and no
one seems to know quite what hap
pened to it.
The disappearance of the sculpture,
which weighs more than 70 pounds and
sat on a large marble stand, was disco
vered by the night supervisor when he
returned from locking a door down the
hall from the lobby late Friday night.
Not only was the supervisor gone
from the room for just a few minutes,
but a friend of his was sitting at the
information desk around the corner
from the lobby the entire time the
supervisor was on his rounds.
The sculpture was one of several
works by Bay area artist James Stoval
on loan to Tresidder for spring quarter.
Called "The Sentinel," the work was
carved from the wood of an elm tree
that used to grow on campus. The
sculpture is valued at $4500, acording
to Jean Martin, program director at
Tresidder.
The supervisor said that the
sculpture was located in a corner where
it was not visible from the information
desk where he usually sits. The super
visor said he did not notice the piece
missing when he went on his 10 p.m.
rounds to lock up the building. How
ever, he said that when he returned, the
empty stand caught his eye.
His friend had heard nothing.
Martin said a reward is offered for
the sculpture's return.
