# ASSU ballot to carry election reform option
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Election reform is the major issue
facing voters in the upcoming spring
quarter election to be held on April 15
and 16.
With senate elections presently held
in the fall, the senate does not actually
get organized until November, and
sometimes even until winter quarter,
according to Senate Chair Mark
Breier.
"The gist of this thing (election re
form) is to provide continuity and elect
a year-round senate," Breier said.
"TTie hesitancy to have the spring elec
tions is how do you handle the new
students who come in. We have devised
a system that would increase the ability
of new students to participate."
The new system involves the intro
duction of 10 senate associates selected
in the fall in addition to the 20 senators
elected in the spring. The associates
would have full speaking rights and
participatory rights, Breier said. He
said they would not be permitted 1o

vote because they are selected rather
than elected representatives.
Breier said the constitutional
amendment was drawn up by a task
force that included past and present
senators and council of presidents
members. "I think it's worthy of all our
support." he added.
If the election reform measure is ap
proved by voters, there will be an elec
tion in the sixth week of this quarter to
vote in 10 undergraduate senators and
10 graduate senators.
Also on the ballot in next week's
regular election arc COP, senior class
president candidates and 14 fee as
sessments.
Running for COP are the slate of
Dick Butterfield, Mark Vantresca,
Nancy Takahashi and Dayna Goldfine
and a group consisting of John Lamb,
Shellye McKinney, Barb Mullin and
Dave Jaffe.

class post. Mary Louise St. Geme, Milt
McColl, MarvTannerand Mark Lerdal
