## Begin government hangs on to coalition 
### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
JERUSALEM — The increas
ing unpopularity of Prime Minis
ter Menachem Begins govern
ment paradoxically has given it a
new lease on life, poll results this
week have shown.
The Israeli media are referring
to Begin's Likud coalition as "a
government without the strength
to fall," for in the Israeli version
of the European parliamentary
system, a weak government
holds together with a despera
tion that keeps it functioning in
the face of heavy odds.
For months the corridors of
the Israeli Knesset (parliament)
have been alive with predictions
that Begin's government was
going to fall. The main reason:
economics. Another: the gov
ernment's plans for settlements
in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank of the Jordan River.
Inflation of 110 percent a year
and a settlement policy opposed
by a large segment of Israelis
have eroded the popularity of
the Likud, although Begin him
self. perhaps because of criticism

from abroad, is slightly more
popular now than he was not
long ago.
Labor in majority
A new poll showed this week
that if elections were held now,
the Likud would get only 18.6
percent of the vote, compared to
54.4 percent for the opposition
Labor Party.
Since a party gets representa
tion in the Knesset in proportion
to its share of the vote, this would
mean that Labor would win 65
seats in the 120-seat house — an
absolute majority. Never in 30
years has a party won an absolute
majority. All have ruled in coali
tion with smaller parties.
"What this means," a political
science professor explained, "is
that Labor could run the gov
ernment without taking in the
National Religious Party, which
has been in every coalition up till
now."
Religious party pivotal
The National Religious Party,
with 12 seats in the Knesset,
could cause the Begin govern
ment to collapse if it voted
against the coalition on a vote of

no-confidence. It is the only bloc
in the coalition whose defection
could bring about the govern
ment's fall.
"The polls have been counter
productive," the professor
explained. "By showing the gov
ernment's weakness, they tend
to keep it together. They mean
that the National Religious Party
will now do anything it can to
prevent early elections."
If the government falls in a
no-confidence vote, elections
must be held within 100 days.
The government's normal four
year term runs until spring of
1981. Earlier this month the Re
ligious Party had been discussing
with Labor officials what kind of
a deal Labor could offer it if it
brought down the Likud.
Sweetheart deal
But if Labor could win an ab
solute majority without the Re
ligious Party, it has no reason to
offer it the kind of sweetheart
deal it got from the Likud. Labor
would no doubt want the Religi
ous Party voting with it, to make
for a broader-based majority,
but does not have to offer the

smaller party the choice posts in
the Cabinet.
To get the Religious Party into
the Likud, Begin gave it the In
terior and Education ministries,
in addition to the Religious Af
fairs portfolio that the party, by
tradition, always holds. Interior
includes police and is rich in pat
ronage jobs; Education controls
disbursement of funds to
schools, a key way of building
party loyalty and strength.
Only a few weeks ago, the Re
ligious Party's titular head. Dr.
Yosef Burg, was meeting quietly
with Labor Party chief Shimon
Peres, discussing "early elec
tions." Now Zeulun Hammer,
minister of education, is urging
ministers to patch up differences
in the Likud Cabinet and pull to
gether to make it work.
The National Religious Party
has no desire to be shut out of
power after its heady experience
with Interior and Education.
And the same poll which shows

Labor winning a 65-seat major
ity shows the NRP dropping
from 12 seats to 9.
Begin now has a working
majority of 68 or 69 seats, al
though this includes six members
of the Democratic Movement
(remnants of the Democratic
Movement for Change) who re
tain by prior agreement the right
to vote against the government
on certain matters of conscience,
including settlement issues.
Even if all six quit in anger over
settlements. Begin would still
hold a slim majority. Only the
NRP can destroy his hold on
power.
There are only four ways an
Israeli government can fall: to
lose a no-confidence vote, by the
prime minister's resignation, by
the death of a prime minister —
or by finishing out its four-year
term. The Likud coalition's un
popularity seems, at this stage, to
be increasing the chance of its
completing the full term.
