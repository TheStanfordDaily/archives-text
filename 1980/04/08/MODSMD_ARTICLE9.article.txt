# Soviets, allies court Ghandi

### Stuart Auerbach The Washington Post 
NEW DELHI — The prime minister of Viet
nam, the foreign minister of Cuba and the deputy
foreign minister of the Soviet Union arrived here
yesterday for talks with the Indian government.
Government officials called it a coincidence. But
Eastern-bloc, Western and Asian diplomats specu
lated that the appearance here of all three officials
signaled a Moscow-backed attempt to gain wider
support for the Soviets' three-month-old invasion
of Afghanistan.
"There is definitely something in the air," said
an East European ambassador here. A spokesman
for the Indian government denied that the com
munist officials had come here to put pressure on
Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to swing further be
hind the Soviet action in Afghanistan.
"She is not subject to any influence," the
spokesman said, repeating her statement that she is
neither pro-United States nor pro-Russian but
rather pro-Indian.
Private talks
The only visitor to meet with Mrs. Gandhi was
Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Van Dong, who
spent 75 minutes in private talks with the Indian
leader. He is scheduled to spend six days in India.
Cuban Foreign Minister Isidoro Malemierca ar
rived here by commercial airliner from Kabul fol
lowing a visit to Moscow. He carried a letter from
Cuban President Fidel Castro to Mrs. Gandhi.
According to well-placed Indian sources, the
Gandhi government would have preferred that
Malemierca stay away but could not refuse his
request for talks here.

According to reports circulating here, the In
dians disagree with Cuba's plan — presented by
Malemierca last month in Kabul and Pakistan — to
settle the Afghan situation through private talks
between Afghanistan, Pakistan and the Soviet
Union rather than by using the nonaligned move
ment.
The Cuban initiative, believed by Western dip
lomats here to be Moscow-inspired in an effort to
gain support from the nonaligned and Moslem na
tions, met with a rebuff from Pakistan President
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, who said Pakistan would
have no contact with Afghanistan while Soviet
troops occupied that country.
The shortest visit here was paid by Soviet De
puty Foreign Minister N.P. Firyubin, who arrived
Monday night and was scheduled to leave at 2:30
this morning. He was to see foreign ministry offi
cials, but both Mrs. Gandhi and Foreign Minister
P.V. Narasimha Rao were tied up last night.
Nepal rebuff's Soviets
The Soviet diplomat came here from Katmandu,
where attempts to gain support for Moscow's inva
sion of Afghanistan were rebuffed by Nepal offi
cials.
While Firyubin walked away when reporters
asked if Afghanistan had been discussed, Nepalese
Foreign Minister K B. Shahi said he had repeated
Nepal's demand for an immediate withdrawal of
Soviet troops from Afghanistan.
"We told him the immediate withdrawal of
Soviet troops is the first step toward stabilizing the
region," a Nepal diplomat here reported.
As in New Delhi, Firyubin's visit to Nepal was
billed as a private one — a stopover on his way
home to Moscow from Rangoon, Burma.
