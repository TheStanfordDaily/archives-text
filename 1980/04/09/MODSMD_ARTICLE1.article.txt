# Anderson to stay in race, offers 'choice'
## 
### Rob Lempert News editor 
Rep. John Anderson (R-III.), speak
ing yesterday in Memorial Auditorium,
vowed he would continue his fight for
the Republican Presidential nomina
tion, and said a November election be
tween Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan would only serve to aggrevate
the growing sense of frustation in the
American electorate.
There is an "unprecedented level of
discontent with the prospect of the
choices facing the voters of this coun
try," Anderson said.
Speaking before a crowd of over
2000 which spilled out into the
street in front of Mem Aud, the ten
term Illinois congressman said his
campaign is dedicated to giving the
people a choice for president. Ander
son explained how his positions on the
issues of energy, the economy, and
foreign policy differ from those of
Reagan and Carter.
Carter's policy of raising interest
rates to control inflation is choking
small business to death while sparing
the large corporations, Anderson
claimed. The large companies are able
to obtain capital elsewhere, but small
businesses cannot survive the loss of
easy credit.
Me called Reagan's plan to cut taxes
by 30 percent, raise defense spending,
and still attempt to balance the budget
"the most fiscally irresponsible prog
ram 1 can think of."
Reagan not inevitable
Anderson said he refuses to accept
the notion that Reagan's nomination
by the Republican party is inevitable.

Reminding his audience that only 500
of the 2000 delegates to the convention
have been picked, Anderson declared
that he had come to California to fight
Reagan in his home court.
"I intend to heat him," Anderson
said.
In comparing his energy plan with
Reagan's, Anderson noted that the
former California governor proposes
to deregulate the oil industry and pro
duce our way out of the shortage. An
derson said Reagan predicts that in five
years the U.S. can be producing
enough oil to meet all its needs at the
present level of consumption.
However, Anderson said that au
thorities ranging from the National
Academy of Sciences to the oil com
panies themselves disagree with
Reagan's claims.
50-cent tax proposal
Instead, Anderson said he proposes
a 50-cent tax on gasoline, designed to
cut consumption. Revenues from the

tax will be used to slash social security
payroll taxes, increase social security
benefits, and reimburse businesses un
fairly penalized by such a tax. He said
his plan could drive down the use of oil
in this country by 1.2 million barrels
per day (about 10 percent).
Anderson said that in the long run,
he favors the development of "benign,
renewable sources of energy." He also
advocates a moratorium on the licens
ing of nuclear reactors until the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission proves it
is capable of assuring the safety of
those plants it okays.
Tax-based rewards
Anderson said the government
should move in the direction of balanc
ing the budget and said that as presi
dent, he would impose wage and price
guidelines, supported by tax-based re
wards and punishments, to help control
inflation. Whenever one of the largest
2000 corporations raised wages or
prices above the guidelines, it would

be penalized by being put into a higher
tax bracket.
Such a plan, Anderson said, would
have more effect than Carter's volun
tary guidelines while avoiding the in
flexibility and expense of the mandat
ory controls proposed by Senator Ted
Kennedy.
Declaring that Carter's newlv im
posed sanctions on Iran would have lit
tle effect, Anderson suggested that the
U.S. share oil with its major allies in
return for their assistance in boycotting
Iranian trade.
The congressman also said he fa
vored the passage of SALT 11. arguing
that while we should not naively trust
any country, the arms limitation treaty
is verifiable and that it was an even
balance of Soviet and American in
terests.

sored by Stanford Committee on Polit
ical Education and Stanford Students

Rep. John Anderson spoke here yesterday afternoon in Memorial Au
ditorium, kicking off his California campaign.
Rep. John Anderson (R-III.), speak
ing yesterday in Memorial Auditorium,
vowed he would continue his fight for
the Republican Presidential nomina
tion, and said a November election be
tween Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan would only serve to aggrevate
the growing sense of frustation in the
American electorate.
There is an "unprecedented level of
discontent with the prospect of the
choices facing the voters of this coun
try," Anderson said.
Speaking before a crowd of over
2000 which spilled out into the
street in front of Mem Aud, the ten
term Illinois congressman said his
campaign is dedicated to giving the
people a choice for president. Ander
son explained how his positions on the
issues of energy, the economy, and
foreign policy differ from those of
Reagan and Carter.
Carter's policy of raising interest
rates to control inflation is choking
small business to death while sparing
the large corporations, Anderson
claimed. The large companies are able
to obtain capital elsewhere, but small
businesses cannot survive the loss of
easy credit.
Me called Reagan's plan to cut taxes
by 30 percent, raise defense spending,
and still attempt to balance the budget
"the most fiscally irresponsible prog
ram 1 can think of."
Reagan not inevitable
Anderson said he refuses to accept
the notion that Reagan's nomination
by the Republican party is inevitable.

Reminding his audience that only 500
of the 2000 delegates to the convention
have been picked, Anderson declared
that he had come to California to fight
Reagan in his home court.
"I intend to heat him," Anderson
said.
In comparing his energy plan with
Reagan's, Anderson noted that the
former California governor proposes
to deregulate the oil industry and pro
duce our way out of the shortage. An
derson said Reagan predicts that in five
years the U.S. can be producing
enough oil to meet all its needs at the
present level of consumption.
However, Anderson said that au
thorities ranging from the National
Academy of Sciences to the oil com
panies themselves disagree with
Reagan's claims.
50-cent tax proposal
Instead, Anderson said he proposes
a 50-cent tax on gasoline, designed to
cut consumption. Revenues from the

tax will be used to slash social security
payroll taxes, increase social security
benefits, and reimburse businesses un
fairly penalized by such a tax. He said
his plan could drive down the use of oil
in this country by 1.2 million barrels
per day (about 10 percent).
Anderson said that in the long run,
he favors the development of "benign,
renewable sources of energy." He also
advocates a moratorium on the licens
ing of nuclear reactors until the Nuc
lear Regulatory Commission proves it
is capable of assuring the safety of
those plants it okays.
Tax-based rewards
Anderson said the government
should move in the direction of balanc
ing the budget and said that as presi
dent, he would impose wage and price
guidelines, supported by tax-based re
wards and punishments, to help control
inflation. Whenever one of the largest
2000 corporations raised wages or
prices above the guidelines, it would

be penalized by being put into a higher
tax bracket.
Such a plan, Anderson said, would
have more effect than Carter's volun
tary guidelines while avoiding the in
flexibility and expense of the mandat
ory controls proposed by Senator Ted
Kennedy.
Declaring that Carter's newlv im
posed sanctions on Iran would have lit

U.S. share oil with its major allies in
return for their assistance in boycotting
Iranian trade.

that while we should not naively trust
any country, the arms limitation treaty
is verifiable and that it was an even
balance of Soviet and American in
terests.
