## Carter asks allies to support U.S. sanctions against Iran Europeans may face oil cutoffs 
### Leonard Downie Jr. The Washington Post 
LONDON — The European
allies were given a list yesterday
of economic and diplomatic ac
tions the Carter administration
wants them to consider taking to
support U.S. sanctions against
Iran.
The list of options for Euro
pean action, presented to Euro
pean foreign ministers yesterday
by American ambassadors in
their capitals, reportedly in
cludes steps to limit or cut off
trade and financial transactions
with Iran that the allies have pre
viously resisted taking.
While arguing that such moves
cannot be made legally without a
United Nations sanctions order
or special legislation in each
country. European officials are
most concerned about the poten
tial disruption to their economies

and retaliatory cutoffs of oil
supplies by Iran. Iranian Oil
Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar
reiterated in Tehran yesterday
the threat to cut off nil from "any
country which participates in
economic sanctions."
Although European leaders
were notified over the weekend
that Carter would act, according
to government spokesmen, their
governments were not ready yes
terday to do more than say they
would carefully consider the
U.S. request. After helping con
vince Carter to delay imposing
economic sanctions earlier this
year, European officials did not
appear eager to confront the
problem.
Sources in Britain and West
Germany suggested that the nine
European Common Market
countries would now confer on
what course to take, as they did
before sending Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr letters a
week ago warning him the Un
ited States would take harsh ac
tion if something were not done
to break the impasse over the
American hostages held in
Tehran. Those letters purposely
avoided, according to sources
here, any threat of European
economic sanctions against Iran.
U.S. economic sanctions
against Iran are by themselves
largely without impact on either
country because most U.S. trade
with Iran, including imports of
Iranian oil. has already been
stopped. But many Western
European nations still carry on
significant trade and financial
dealings with Iran and import a
considerable amount of its oil.
Deputy Secretary of State
Warren Christopher said in an
ABC television interview in
Washington yesterday that the
United States would like its allies
to "join us in taking some of the
steps, at least, the president took
on behalf of the United States
yesterday. We'll be looking to
our allies for cooperation in help
ing to make these steps effec
tive."

West German sources have
said officials in Bonn are more
sympathetic toward supporting
economic sanctions against Iran
because of the hostages than im
posing sanctions against the
Soviet Union in response to the
invasion of Afghanistan. The
president of the West German
Federation of Trade and Indus
try, Otto Wolf Von Amerongen,
said last week that he thought
West Germany "would respond
positively" in the "special case"
of the hostages because "lives
were directly involved and the
United States must be helped."
Although West Germany's
total trade with Iran has dwin
dled since the Islamic revolution
there, it still imported about 10
percent of its oil from Iran last
year.
But well-informed British
sources said yesterday there
were still major legal and
economic problems to overcome
before Britain or other Euro
pean allies could join in
economic sanctions against Iran,
although they understood that
Carter was forced to act and
needs allied support.
Britain still imports seven per
cent of its oil from Iran, despite
its own North Sea oil resources.
It also still carries on about $40
billion worth of other trade with
Iran, much of it automobiles
whose parts are made here by
Chrysler IJK for assembly in
Iran.
But most important is the ex
tensive banking done here by
Iran, part of Britain's vital inter
national banking business.
British bankers strongly oppose
and could possibly stop in the
courts or Parliament any action,
according to one source, that
could "harm confidence in Lon
don as a banking center by an
tagonizing a big petrodollar cus
tomer like Irai\"
Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, who promised strong
support for President Carter dur

ing the Iranian crisis, has said she
did not believe she could push
through Parliament legislation
imposing trade and banking
sanctions.
Britain and several other
European countries did stop the
export of military equipment and
spare parts to Iran after a United
Nations order imposing broader
sanctions was vetoed in the U.N.
Security Council by the Soviet
Union in January. But they told
the Carter administration that
imposing other trade and bank
ing sanctions was legally difficult
without a U.N. order and liable
to be counterproductive because
it would only further alienate the
Iranians from the West.
Officials here were not ready
yesterday to react to reports of
U.S. officials telling reporters in
Washington that the European
allies would have to realize that
the restraint had failed to pro
duce results and it was now
necessary for them to support
Carter if they did not want still
more drastic steps to be taken.
Sources here said they still re
garded the possibility of a U.S.
naval blockade of Iran as only a
remote possibility that American
officials were extremely reluc
tant to consider, although the
prospect is known to worry many
European diplomats who fear it
could quickly escalate into a
dangerous East-West confronta
tion.
Sources here also said that
joining the United States in
breaking oft diplomatic relations
with Iran would be "?• very se
vere step" that had been rejected
after it was previously offered
among a list of options for Euro
pean action by the nine Common
Market nations' ambassadors in
Tehran.
"It may have to be looked at
again." said one source. "It
could have an impact 011 the situ
ation. but it may be more neees'
sary for friends of America to
keep open lines of communica
tion with the Iranians."
