Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said yesterday
his country was "prepared to enter into any kind ot
battle to defend its honor and sovereignty," and
Iran said Iraq was massing 220,000 troops along
the 800-mile border between the two countries.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Iran's revolutio
nary leader, said Hussein was "digging his own
grave."
Iran ordered a full military alert at its Persian
Gulf naval and air bases as a result of new sanctions
imposed by the United States in the hostage crisis
and the flareup of hostilities with Iraq, Tehran
Radio reported.
The Iranian army commander, identified only as
Gen. Fallahi, was quoted by Tehran Radio as say

ing his forces were awaiting orders from Khomeini
and Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr "to
move out of their bases and face the aggression."
Khomeini implored "noble Islamic nations" to
kill Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Hussein,
and urged the Iraqi people and army to cut off
Hussein's "criminal hands" and overthrow him. He
called both Sadat and Hussein "treacherous para
sites."
In Baghdad, the official Iraqi news agency, INA,
quoted Hussein as saying: "I le who tries to stretch
a finger against Iraq will lose that linger."
Iranian officials announced that they had or
dered shut the Tehran office of the Iraqi news
agency and instructed the staff to leave the country.
