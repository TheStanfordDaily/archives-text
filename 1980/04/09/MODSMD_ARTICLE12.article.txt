# Carter, Sadat aim to revive negotiations
## 
### Barry Schweid Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter, shifting
gears from the Iranian stalemate, held talks yesterday
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat aimed at pumping
new life into slow-moving negotiations over sell-rule tor
more than one million Palestinian Arabs.
As they met in the Oval Office, diplomatic sources
were skeptical that an agreement on an autonomy plan
could be wrapped up during the Sadat visit and Israeli
Prime Minister Menachem Begin's trip here next week.
All key issues, including how much authority the
Palestinians are to have, remain unsolved with the May
26 target date for an agreement only five weeks away.
Carter's hope is that he can work out guidelines for
Egyptian and Israeli negotiating teams in his separate

talks with Sadat and Begin. Those teams, headed by
Egyptian Prime Minister Mustapha Khalil and Israeli
Interior Minister Joseph Burg, may meet here toward
the end of the month.
Passing up formal arrival ceremonies. Carter posed
quietly with Sadat for photographs in the White House
rose garden before leading him to a quiet porch framed
by flowering magnolia trees outside the Oval Office.
A second round of talks, scheduled for late afternoon,
was to be followed by a dinner.
Guarantees for Israel's security were the likely focus
of the sessions. At the same time, Sadat was expected to
push for creation of a Palestinian legislative council and
a rollback of Israeli forces on the West Bank of the
Jordan River and in Gaza.
As a gesture to Israel, which is concerned that such
moves could lead to establishment of a Palestinian state

that threatens its existence, Egyptian sources indicated
Sadat would suggest demilitarization of the territories
for five years and a neutral peace-keeping unit or mixed
Egyptian-Israeli patrol.
Whatever is hammered out by Carter and Sadat in
their two-day talks will be submitted to Begin when he
calls.
Then it would be up to the negotiating teams headed
by Klialil and Burg to try to translate the principles into
an autonomy settlement by the deadline.
If key issues remain unresolved, U.S. and Egyptian
officials said Carter might hold a three-way summit,
meeting with Sadat and Begin along the lines of the
Camp David sessions of September 197 N. Those talks
produced the framework for a peacy treaty between
Egypt and Israel and the current negotiations over Pales-,
tinian autonomy.
