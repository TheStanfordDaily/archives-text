# Title IX has a questionable influence
## More women admitted to grad school 
### Suzi Alexander Staff Writer 
A brightening horizon awaits
women who plan to continue on
to Stanford graduate schools, ac
cording to a recent review con
ducted to verify enforcement of
Title IX. The San Francisco reg
ional office of HEW's Office for
Civil Rights concluded that
"Stanford has made generally
satisfactory progress on admis
sion of women to graduate prog
rams."
Sally Mahoney, assistant pro
vost and registrar, responsible as
Title IX coordinator, said the
University is doing "quite well"
in working toward a goal of "no
discrimination on the basis of
sex." On AprilB, 1977, after the
legislation became effective, a
memo was distributed, reviewing
the progress in admitting women
and establishing specific prog
rams.
In reviewing the current con
ditions, applicant pools, admis
sion percentages, acceptance
percentages and the number of
people who actually enter in the
fall were all considered. The sub
sequent "reporting mechanism"
that was established requires all
graduate departments to have
some kind of program.
Suggested elements included
plans to identify the existing
problems, expand the number of
women students, set targets for
numerical and proportional ex
pansions and consider the rela
tion of the ratio of men and
women in the job market to the

ratio of men and women in
graduate schools.
All departments with fewer
than 30 percent women are re
quired to submit reports. Ac
cording to Mahoney, the most
significant increases have been
made in the areas of law, busi
ness and engineering. She specu
lates that this is a result of the
traditional underrepresentation
of women in these areas.
Further, she has noted a large
shift within fields. Overall,
Mahoney concludes that ad
vancements in the admissions of
women have probably been a re
sult of general goals rather than
specific policies.
James Angell, assistant chair
man of admissions to the electri
cal engineering graduate school,
one of the programs said to have
shown substantial results, claims
that their admissions policies
were "not dramatically affected
by Title IX."
According to Angell, the
reason for special admissions
programs is to provide an equal
opportunity to those who may
have had unequal backgrounds.
It is his contention that the
graduate level is not the approp
riate one at which to begin pro
viding that opportunity. Having
had bad experiences with "af
firmative action" programs,
Angell now demands the same
standards from all applicants.
Still Angell claims there has
been "a substantial increase
nationwide in qualified women
applicants." He attributed this

increase to two factors. First, he
feels women have become con
vinced that it is a socially accept
able thing for women to go into
engineering. Second, a substan
tial number of women have gone
into engineering, shown them
selves, and now serve as role
models for younger women.
In 1974, in a class of 5 10, only
25 were women; today, in a class
of 550, 45 are women. Propor
tionally, the increase is substan
tial. But numerically, women are
underrepresented. Angell is
pleased with the advances, but
worries that there is a long way to
go.
The study noted three excep
tions to the overall success:
chemistry, economics and docto
rate programs in education. The
chemistry program admitted
2 1.9 percent of the women who
applied, and 35.3 percent of the
men in 1978. The chairman of
admissions declined to discuss
Title IX.
Ronald McKennan, chairman
of admissions for the Graduate
School of Economics, says that
the percentage of women admit
ted almost equals the percentage
of women applying, despite 1978
admission figures which show 15
percent acceptances for women
and 22.3 percent for men. Audie
Carlson, graduate secretary, exp
lains that the figures may be dis
torted by foreign applicants, who
are almost all male. McKennan
claims "in recent years, we've
admitted many more than 10
years ago."

Like Angell, McKennan as
serts that applicants arc ranked
without regard for sex. In his
view, Title IX has done more to
affect women than to affect ad
missions policies. More women
are applying because there is a
growing confidence in being ad
mitted. The increased assurance
has further affected women's wil
lingness to compete in the busi
ness world. "Women are more
willing now to replicate what had
been thought to be men's cal
lings," he said.
Carlson concurs that they arc
receiving applications from
women of "higher quality," and
feels that women are improving
their skills in math. But the
number of women is not increas
ing enough, according to
Carlson. A few years ago, there
was an effort among the women
of the economics school to in
crease female admissions, but
that withered. In regard to Title
IX, Carlson feels that is has pro
moted a "sharpening of aware
ness ... I wasn't aware" she ad
mits.
Finally Carlson suggests that
the nialproportion of women
may be attributed to a high re
cruitment rate of qualified wo
men. Because there are com
paratively few highly qualified
women with an interest in
economics, and because many
graduate schools would like to be
able to boast a high number of
women enrolled, these women
are in great demand.

has further affected women's wil
lingness to compete in the busi
ness world. "Women are more
willing now to replicate what had
been thought to be men's cal
lings," he said.
Carlson concurs that they arc
receiving applications from
women of "higher quality," and
feels that women are improving
their skills in math. But the
number of women is not increas
ing enough, according to
Carlson. A few years ago, there
was an effort among the women
of the economics school to in
crease female admissions, but
that withered. In regard to Title
IX, Carlson feels that is has pro
moted a "sharpening of aware
ness ... I wasn't aware" she ad
mits.
Finally Carlson suggests that
the nialproportion of women
may be attributed to a high re
cruitment rate of qualified wo
men. Because there are com
paratively few highly qualified
women with an interest in
economics, and because many
graduate schools would like to be
able to boast a high number of
women enrolled, these women
are in great demand.
A brightening horizon awaits
women who plan to continue on
to Stanford graduate schools, ac
cording to a recent review con
ducted to verify enforcement of
Title IX. The San Francisco reg
ional office of HEW's Office for
Civil Rights concluded that
"Stanford has made generally
satisfactory progress on admis
sion of women to graduate prog
rams."
Sally Mahoney, assistant pro
vost and registrar, responsible as
Title IX coordinator, said the
University is doing "quite well"
in working toward a goal of "no
discrimination on the basis of
sex." On AprilB, 1977, after the
legislation became effective, a
memo was distributed, reviewing
the progress in admitting women
and establishing specific prog
rams.
In reviewing the current con
ditions, applicant pools, admis
sion percentages, acceptance
percentages and the number of
people who actually enter in the
fall were all considered. The sub
sequent "reporting mechanism"
that was established requires all
graduate departments to have
some kind of program.
Suggested elements included
plans to identify the existing
problems, expand the number of
women students, set targets for
numerical and proportional ex
pansions and consider the rela
tion of the ratio of men and
women in the job market to the

ratio of men and women in
graduate schools.
All departments with fewer
than 30 percent women are re
quired to submit reports. Ac
cording to Mahoney, the most
significant increases have been
made in the areas of law, busi
ness and engineering. She specu
lates that this is a result of the
traditional underrepresentation
of women in these areas.
Further, she has noted a large
shift within fields. Overall,
Mahoney concludes that ad
vancements in the admissions of
women have probably been a re
sult of general goals rather than
specific policies.
James Angell, assistant chair
man of admissions to the electri
cal engineering graduate school,
one of the programs said to have
shown substantial results, claims
that their admissions policies
were "not dramatically affected
by Title IX."
According to Angell, the
reason for special admissions
programs is to provide an equal
opportunity to those who may
have had unequal backgrounds.
It is his contention that the
graduate level is not the approp
riate one at which to begin pro
viding that opportunity. Having
had bad experiences with "af
firmative action" programs,
Angell now demands the same
standards from all applicants.
Still Angell claims there has
been "a substantial increase
nationwide in qualified women
applicants." He attributed this

increase to two factors. First, he
feels women have become con
vinced that it is a socially accept
able thing for women to go into
engineering. Second, a substan
tial number of women have gone
into engineering, shown them
selves, and now serve as role
models for younger women.
In 1974, in a class of 5 10, only
25 were women; today, in a class
of 550, 45 are women. Propor
tionally, the increase is substan
tial. But numerically, women are
underrepresented. Angell is
pleased with the advances, but
worries that there is a long way to
go.
The study noted three excep
tions to the overall success:
chemistry, economics and docto
rate programs in education. The
chemistry program admitted
2 1.9 percent of the women who
applied, and 35.3 percent of the
men in 1978. The chairman of
admissions declined to discuss
Title IX.
Ronald McKennan, chairman
of admissions for the Graduate
School of Economics, says that
the percentage of women admit
ted almost equals the percentage
of women applying, despite 1978
admission figures which show 15
percent acceptances for women
and 22.3 percent for men. Audie
Carlson, graduate secretary, exp
lains that the figures may be dis
torted by foreign applicants, who
are almost all male. McKennan
claims "in recent years, we've
admitted many more than 10
years ago."

Like Angell, McKennan as
serts that applicants arc ranked
without regard for sex. In his
view, Title IX has done more to
affect women than to affect ad
missions policies. More women
are applying because there is a
growing confidence in being ad
mitted. The increased assurance
has further affected women's wil
lingness to compete in the busi
ness world. "Women are more
willing now to replicate what had
been thought to be men's cal
