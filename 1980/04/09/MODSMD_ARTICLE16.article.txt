# Bicycle industry still sees car favored mode of travel
## 
### Ted Knutsen The Washington Post 
CHICAGO — Oak Park sub
urbanite Jay Townley wouldn't
commute by bicycle to work
every day to save energy even if
the president asked him to.
Even if that president's name
were Schwinn.
Which it is at Townley's com
pany.
The reluctance of those —
such as Schwinn's marketing vice
president — who have the
greatest personal financial stake
in the growth of the bike industry
to mount their own products in
the battle for energy conserva
tion bodes ill for the Department
of Transportation's expected
announcement May 1 to peddle
the bicycle as the next big gas
saver.
Save oil
Estimates are that the nation
could save 87.000 barrels of oil a
day if one million commuters
took to the streets on bikes. And
Phil Burkke of the Bicycle Man
ufacturers Association says
"long range, the bicycle has to be
perceived as a viable transporta
tion alternative."
But this opinion isn't shared

universally within the industry,
much less within the government
and the public.
"I do not think the bicycle will
ever be used for transportation,"
said Thomas Albers, vice presi
dent of finances for Huffy Man
ufacturing, which claims to be
the largest domestic producer,
with 35 percent of the bicycle
market.
After a five-year recovery
from the 47 percent decline in
sales that followed the bike
boom in 1975, the industry faces
its share of potholes.
And not just the kind that lit
erally can throw you for a loop.
Credit crunch
The credit crunch already has
begun to hurt. Most bikes in this
country are sold through mass
market retailers, and Albers sees
sales softening at K Mart, Pen
ney's, and Montgomery Ward's,
which sell Huffy-made bikes
under their own brand names.
Murray, Ohio, which supplies
Sears, reportedly is experiencing
a slight dip in sales after a strong
first quarter this year.
The privately owned Schwinn
company may not be hit as hard
by the credit squeeze, though.

Schwinn always has sold through
its own small franchised outlets
where the straight-cash sale is
more common.
The big question for the indus
try today is whether the public
will look at the bicycle as a plea
sure purchase that can be defer
red or as a necessity to get from
place to place without paying
through the nose at the gas
pump.
And compounding that is the
suggestion that as people spend
more of their leisure time at
home, they might see the bicycle
as a cheap way of spending their
time without taking a vacation.
Sales increase
Last year's gasoline shortages
and price increases led to a 20
percent increase in domestic
bicycle sales and the industry's
first billion-dollar year. Spring
sell-outs of the year's production
were common among the six
major companies in the market.
Although industry observers
foresee some growth, they don't
believe the momentum of 1979
will continue this year. It is gen
erally agreed that the sales rise
was caused more by the shortage
of gasoline than by the price in

creases.
Some people were buying
bicycles and storing them for
emergencies just like gas cans,
according to Townley.
Still, he saw a strength in last
year's market because of the in
creased activity in repair shops.
People were bringing their vehi
cles to be reoiled and to have
flats fixed. Which to Townley
meant that bikes bought during
the boom were being, well, recy
cled.
The number of early teens will
be declining in this decade but
they remain the bread and butter
of the industry. It was the 1 2- to
15-year-olds who were purchas
ing multispeed, lightweight bikes
during the boom and they still
are buying. The two-bike teen is
common. The big growth in this
age group is in Motocross, the
bicycle version of motorcycle
racing. Townley says Schwinn
just "can't make enough" of

those bikes, which retail for
nearly $500.
For whatever reasons —
energy and low-cost labor being
the most likely — Oklahoma
seems to be the center of the
manufacturers' efforts in any
bike boom.
Last June, Schwinn an
nounced it was buying land in an
industrial park outside Tulsa
City. Tliree days after the United
Auto Workers won a certifica
tion vote at Schwinn's factories
in Chicago, a press off icer for the
company would say only that
there is no construction "cur
rently" on the site.
Million hikes
Over in Ponca City. Okla.,
Huffy will be opening a plant this
summer capable of producing
one million bicycles a year, a
move that causes some recessio
nary shivers in at least one
analyst.
"The timing of the opening of

the plant could be better," said
Hal Vogel, who watches the lei
sure industries for Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith. He
tempered this pessimism by not
ing that Huffy plans to open the
plant gradually and will need the
capacity five or 10 years from
now when construction costs
likelv will be significantly higher.
Huffy was listed on the New
York Stock Exchange last year
for the first time. From Vogel's
standpoint, it hasn't done much.
Merrill Lynch is rating the
company as neutral now and a
buy for the long term.
Whatever President Carter
might say and do on May 1. his
first officially declared bike day.
the feeling is that local and state
governments will have a much
greater role in determining how
much the bicycle will be used as a
transportation alternative and
how this could affect the fortunes
of the industry.

percent increase in domestic
bicycle sales and the industry's
first billion-dollar year. Spring
sell-outs of the year's production
were common among the six
major companies in the market.
Although industry observers
foresee some growth, they don't
believe the momentum of 1979
will continue this year. It is gen
erally agreed that the sales rise
was caused more by the shortage
of gasoline than by the price in

creases.
Some people were buying
bicycles and storing them for
emergencies just like gas cans,
according to Townley.
Still, he saw a strength in last
year's market because of the in
creased activity in repair shops.
People were bringing their vehi
cles to be reoiled and to have
flats fixed. Which to Townley
meant that bikes bought during
the boom were being, well, recy
cled.
The number of early teens will
be declining in this decade but
they remain the bread and butter
of the industry. It was the 1 2- to
15-year-olds who were purchas
ing multispeed, lightweight bikes
during the boom and they still
are buying. The two-bike teen is
common. The big growth in this
age group is in Motocross, the
bicycle version of motorcycle
racing. Townley says Schwinn
just "can't make enough" of

those bikes, which retail for
nearly $500.
For whatever reasons —
energy and low-cost labor being
the most likely — Oklahoma
seems to be the center of the
manufacturers' efforts in any
bike boom.
Last June, Schwinn an
nounced it was buying land in an
industrial park outside Tulsa
City. Tliree days after the United
Auto Workers won a certifica
tion vote at Schwinn's factories
in Chicago, a press off icer for the
company would say only that
there is no construction "cur
rently" on the site.
Million hikes
Over in Ponca City. Okla.,
Huffy will be opening a plant this
summer capable of producing
one million bicycles a year, a
move that causes some recessio
nary shivers in at least one
analyst.
"The timing of the opening of

the plant could be better," said
Hal Vogel, who watches the lei
sure industries for Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner and Smith. He
tempered this pessimism by not
ing that Huffy plans to open the
plant gradually and will need the
capacity five or 10 years from
now when construction costs
likelv will be significantly higher.
Huffy was listed on the New
York Stock Exchange last year
for the first time. From Vogel's
standpoint, it hasn't done much.
Merrill Lynch is rating the
company as neutral now and a
buy for the long term.
Whatever President Carter
might say and do on May 1. his
first officially declared bike day.
the feeling is that local and state
governments will have a much
greater role in determining how
much the bicycle will be used as a
transportation alternative and
how this could affect the fortunes
of the industry.
CHICAGO — Oak Park sub
urbanite Jay Townley wouldn't
commute by bicycle to work
every day to save energy even if
the president asked him to.
Even if that president's name
were Schwinn.
Which it is at Townley's com
pany.
The reluctance of those —
such as Schwinn's marketing vice
president — who have the
greatest personal financial stake
in the growth of the bike industry
to mount their own products in
the battle for energy conserva
tion bodes ill for the Department
of Transportation's expected
announcement May 1 to peddle
the bicycle as the next big gas
saver.
Save oil
Estimates are that the nation
could save 87.000 barrels of oil a
day if one million commuters
took to the streets on bikes. And
Phil Burkke of the Bicycle Man
ufacturers Association says
"long range, the bicycle has to be
perceived as a viable transporta
tion alternative."
But this opinion isn't shared

universally within the industry,
much less within the government
and the public.
"I do not think the bicycle will
ever be used for transportation,"
said Thomas Albers, vice presi
dent of finances for Huffy Man
ufacturing, which claims to be
the largest domestic producer,
with 35 percent of the bicycle
market.
After a five-year recovery
from the 47 percent decline in
sales that followed the bike
boom in 1975, the industry faces
its share of potholes.
And not just the kind that lit
erally can throw you for a loop.
Credit crunch
The credit crunch already has
begun to hurt. Most bikes in this
country are sold through mass
market retailers, and Albers sees
sales softening at K Mart, Pen
ney's, and Montgomery Ward's,
which sell Huffy-made bikes
under their own brand names.
Murray, Ohio, which supplies
Sears, reportedly is experiencing
a slight dip in sales after a strong
first quarter this year.
The privately owned Schwinn
company may not be hit as hard
by the credit squeeze, though.

Schwinn always has sold through
its own small franchised outlets
where the straight-cash sale is
more common.
The big question for the indus
try today is whether the public
will look at the bicycle as a plea
sure purchase that can be defer
red or as a necessity to get from
place to place without paying
through the nose at the gas
pump.
And compounding that is the
suggestion that as people spend
more of their leisure time at
home, they might see the bicycle
as a cheap way of spending their
time without taking a vacation.
