## Support Butterfield et al. 
### 
I his year, the student body is fortunate
in having four very qualified and highly
experienced veterans of the University
running for the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Dick Butterfield. Dayna
(midline. Nancy Takahashi and Marc
Ventresca have proven themselves in the
past lew years to he conscientious,
responsible student leaders in a wide
variety ol capacities, from the ASSU
Coltee Mouse Task Force that Butterfield
headed to SWOPS I teaching and SLE
tutoring.
At least as important as their spectrum
of experience, however, are the ideas they
have to make the much-maligned student
government here run more smoothly and
be more in tunc with our needs.
Items on the slate's agenda include
women's tenure, graduate student
orientation (an area that the University has
overlooked until now, concentrating
instead only on orienting the new
undergraduates) and a household items
exchange project so that students will he
able to acquire second-hand furnishings
for their trailer or apartment at low cost.
Although this plethora of ideas could
diffuse their energies so much that few of
their plans would be realized, they intend
to counteract that by delegating a lot of the
responsibility for that to task forces like the
one Butterfield headed on the Coffee
House. They also place much emphasis on
student involvement 111 the ASSU so that
the load of many projects could be
accomplished under their direction.
Their concept of the COP's function

includes, to a large extent, a vision of the
COP and the ASSU as clearinghouses for
the vast quantities of information that are
available to make students' stay at the
University easier and more valuable. They
are in a position to help disseminate this
resource to the student body at large and
this project could well be an important one.
While their slate does not include a
graduate student, as has often been the
case, they have demonstrated a concern for
graduate issues with their proposal for an
orientation. If the amount of
communication they hope to facilitate does
indeed occur, the absence of graduate
representation on the slate should not be a
handicap.
The other slate — comprised of David
Jaffee. John I.amb, Shelly McKinney and
Barb Mullin — does not measure up. They
lack experience in University and ASSU
affairs and assert that they could simply
learn on the job. But the COP is
sufficiently complex that their efficiency
would be seriously impaired for the first
several months ol the COP's year-long
tenure. This is untenable. Their programs
and plans are. for the most part, nebulous,
and their good intentions might be better
used on the ASSU Senate or University
committees.
We urge students to support the
Butterfield. (loldtine, Takahashi and
Ventresca COP slate and to help give
credibility to the ASSU elections by voting
in large numbers. A Council of Presidents
is only as effective as the student support
it has behind its ideas and actions.
