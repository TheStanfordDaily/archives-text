# Random arrest is unfair
## 
### 
Over a week ago, campus police arrested
10 men. including two students, for al
legedly performing "lewd and lascivious"
homosexual acts in the Cummings Art
Building and Cubberley Education Build
ing restrooms.
There is a good deal of evidence that
University officials had been aware of the
activity in the restrooms for some time.
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer of Stanford Police
Services has been quoted as saying that the
acts have "been going on a long time" and
have "gotten out of control."
The non-enforcement of the pertinent
laws by the University created an atmos
phere of at least implied tolerance. Those
who were randomly selected to he arrested
had every reason to believe that this "to
lerance policy" would continue. They were
given no prior warning that this policy was
no longer operative.
We think that those who were arrested in
Cummings and Cubberley were the victims
of capricious University action and ought
to be released. The 10 men arrested had no
way of knowing that things "had gotten out
of control" — how could they, since the
University has never bothered to define
that extremely imprecise standard?

The public has a right to legislate what
goes on in public rest rooms — and there
are laws already on the books that do just
that. Sexual acts — both heterosexual and
homosexual — are covered by such legisla
tion. Such acts in restrooms are not victim
less, since others wanting merely to use the
facilities can he considered victims if sexual
activity is going on when they enter.
But random crackdowns such as these
are neither lair nor good law enforcement.
If the University plans to enforce the law. it
should try to compensate for its past toler
ance policy by issuing warnings before ar
rests are made.
In addition, the gay community has a
stake in seeing that those who engage in
such acts in public restrooms come to grips
with their sexual feelings. Arrests in re
strooms do little to enhance the image of
gays.
And beyond that, all of us should
acknowledge that society's attitude toward
alternative lifestyles burdens many with
such self-doubt and self-hatred that they
feel they have to hide in the bathroom.
Random and capricious arrests are
hardly the way to deal with such deeply
rooted problems.
