## Support county's solar bills 
### 
Hvery day it becomes more
apparent that our dependence
on conventional energy sources
is greatly impairing our
economy, environment and
world peace. President Jimmy
Carter's stress on conservation is
positive, yet his promotion ol
ca pi till-in tensive, non
renewable and environmentally
damaging energy sources like
nuclear energy and synthetic
fuels is suicidal. II we are ever to
begin to solve the energy crisis,
we must both conserve energy
and start using renewable
sources like the sun.
Mere in Santa Clara County
we have a chance to implement
an effective solar energy and
conservation program through a
number of ordinances currently
being considered by the Santa
Clara County Hoard ol Super
visors These ordinances, if pas
sed, will directly affect only the
unincorporated parts ol the
county (including Stanford).
However, the ordinances would
also undoubtedly serve as an inf
luential model for other local
governments to follow.
The lust ordinance, which re
quired pre-1975 homes to have
energy audits and bringing
homes up to state conservation

standards at the time ol resale,
has already been passed. During
the next few months, the board
will be voting on the remaining
measures, which include:
— an ordinance defining solar
access rights to protect installed
solar collectors on new and exist
ing homes.
an ordinance banning the
use of natural gas to heat resi
dential swimming pools, begin
ning in 1985.
a provision requiring all
new homes to install solar sys
tems as primary sources ol water
heating and all existing homes to
be retrofitted with solar hot
water heaters upon resale.
In all of the ordinances, vari
ous exemptions are provided for
such reasons as lack of cost
ellectiveness or health and safety
problems.
County supervisors Rod Diri
don, Susanne Wilson and Dan
McCorquodule who voted for
the energy audit ordinance
should be commended for their
efforts. Supervisors Geraldine
Steinberg (representing our
area) and Don Cortese voted
against it because they think that
economic incentives could con
vince people to conserve on their
own This attitude ignores the

fact that 45 percent of the
housing units in Santa Clara
County are rentals whose land
lords don't pay utility hills and
are. therefore, not likely to he
influenced by market pressures.
In any case, economic incen
tives to save energy and promote
solar power would take longer
and would he less thorough than
by mandate. The energy crisis is
ol such urgency that we cannot
afford any more delays in con
servation.
Letters should be written soon
to Steinhurg and Cortese urging
them to vote yes on the remain
ing ordinances. (Send these to
the Government Center, 70 W.
Iledding St., Last Wing, San
Jose 95 I 10.) Positive support at
the board ol supervisors hearings
during the next lew months is
also needed. The solar hot water
ordinance will be voted on May
S.
These ordinances can signific
antly reduce use of natural gas
and electricity in homes
throughout our county. We must
not let this exciting opportunity
to decrease our dependence on
non-renewable energy slip by.
