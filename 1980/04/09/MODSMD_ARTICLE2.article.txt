# Iranian diplomats leave bitterly
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services and staff reports
While FBI agents and uniformed
police officers stood by outside the em
bassy's richly carved wooden door,
Iranian diplomats yesterday went
about the tasks of destroying sensitive
files and closing out Tehran's remain
ing official business in Washington.
With some farewells dipped in bit
terness, staffs of the Iranian embassy in
.and of Iranian consulates
around the country bowed to President
Jimmy Carter's order ousting them
from this country, effective at midnight
last night.
Diplomats assigned to the embassy
and members of their families left the
country last night, along with envoys
and their families from consulates in
New York, Chicago, Houston and San
Francisco and the Los Angeles liaison
office.
Carter broke diplomatic relations
with Iran Monday. He also cancelled
all U.S. visas held by Iranians who were
outside of the United States at the time
and said visas would be revalidated
only for "compelling and proven
humanitarian reasons or where the na
tional interest requires."
On campus, school authorities and
students awaited word on the future
status of the Iranians studying here on
temporary student visas.
"We've heard absolutely nothing
from Immigration and Naturalization
Services," said Lee Ziegler, director of
Bechtel International Center.
"What the implications are for our
students remains to be seen. We don't
know what the status is for those stu
dents whose visas will expire before the
end of their studies here."
Some Iranian students said they
were worried that with the closure of
the consulate offices in San Francisco,
they won't be able to receive money
from their families still living in Iran.

"In that sense, we are now hostages
ourselves," said one student.
Others wondered what will happen
to some of their classmates who were in
their homeland visiting family when
Carter handed down his decision. It is
possible they will not be allowed to re
turn to the United States and finish
their studies.
Iranians holding visas to enter the
United States were turned away from
planes at London airports yesterday.
A TWA attendant in London said he
refused to permit an Iranian woman
with an Iranian passport to board a
flight for a return to her home in the
United States after a week's vacation.
"She was speechless," the attendant
said. "She could not believe that she
couldn't go home."
An estimated 150,000 Iranians hold
visas for the United States. Officials
agreed that students holding valid visas
who have left the United States on vac
ation could have a hard time getting
back in.
"If they were visiting a sick aunt, that
would fit the humanitarian exception,"
one said. "If they went skiing they
could be in trouble."
In other moves yesterday, the State
Department issued a warning to U.S.
allies that their Iranian oil supplies
could be placed in danger if they do not
support the new sanctions.
Iranian officials have strongly indi
cated they will cut off oil shipments to
any country that joins in the U.S. sanc
tions.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and
the government of President Abolhas
san Bani-Sadr yesterday welcomed
Washington's declaration of economic
and political sanctions against Iran,
using them as an opportunity to appeal
for public sacrifice and toil to end the
domestic economic chaos that has
plagued Iran since the February 1979

revolution.
Iranian authorities also took advan
tage of the heightened crisis with the
United States and a brewing armed
conflict with neighboring Iraq to im
pose new political and economic re
strictions that might otherwise arouse
opposition here.
In a radio message to the nation on
Carter's decision to break oft diploma
tic relation* and eH-rtatf
Khomeini said: "If Carter has done one
thing during his life which it can be said
is to the benefit and interest of the op
pressed, it is this very cutting of rela
tions between a nation risen for libera
tion from the grip of international
plunderers and a world predator plun
derer. We consider this cutting of rela
tions as a good omen because it is a
reason for the U.S. government to give
up hope about Iran."
Coinciding with the imposition of
U.S. sanctions, Iranian authorities an
nounced sharp restrictions on their citi
zen's travel abroad, imminent execu
tions for alleged saboteurs in the
autonomy-seeking province of
Khuzestan, a ban on demonstrations at
the predominantly leftist Tehran Uni
versity and a crackdown on un
employment protests, work slowdowns
and strikes.
In an evening television address,
Bani-Sadr called for massive demonst
rations all over the country Friday
against the United States and appealed
for "backbreaking work" by Iranians
to rebuild the country's economy.
He told Iranians that there was no
reason to worry about the U.S. sanc
tions because Iran had all the food and
medicine it needed. "The American ac
tion can have little effect," Bani-Sadr
said. He called it "a good opportunity
to gain economic independence" and
said it came at a time when "the coun
try needed uniformity and unity."
