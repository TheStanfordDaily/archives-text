From everything I have seen
of marijuana use. there is no

Niemeycr was quoted in the San
Francisco Chronicle as stating,
"We don't want this campus to
become a hangout for homosex
uals." This statement by an offi
cial spokesman for the Univer
sity is appalling — at the same
time ignorant and prejudiced.
Ignorant because it is blind to
the 10 percent of the University
community that is gay — stu

dents, stall and faculty who con
sider this campus home and who
are not simply going to go away
because Niemeyer doesn't like
them.
Prejudiced, too, because it
implies that gays are less valu
able members ol the community,
less welcome guests, or less law
abiding citizens lor no other
reason than their sexual orienta
tion.
Statements like this are still all
too common, but they have no
place as University policy and
merit a rapid retraction.
