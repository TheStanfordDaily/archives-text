# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Perry Beider Dead Week just 'business as usual' 
### 
According to ihc oilicial Dead Week pol
icy statement. "Dead Week is a period ol
reduced social and extracurricular activity
preceding final examinations, lis purpose is
to permit students to concentrate on
academic work and to prepare for final
examinations." Things may he substantially
dillerent lor the typical undergraduate
(though I doubt it). but personally I find thai
most ol the quarter is ;i "period of reduced
social and extracurricular activity," and what
additional reductions arc possible are woe
lulls inadequate to allow lor finals prepara
tion concurrently with the business as usual
ol the last week ol classes.
And business as usual il is. despite several
paragraphs ol recommendations to the fa
culty in the policy statement that seem togive
a contrary impression. Careful reading shows
that they are designed to exclude only those
things instructors wouldn' I he doing anyway,
for example, homework and quizzes should
he given during Dead Week only in classes
that normally have homework and quizzes.
I I he committee thai authored the statement
is reportedly at work on a major novel,
I .<u)/)ln>lc-22.)

Similarly, the statement "Major papers or
projects about which the student has had
reasonable notice may he called due in Dead
Week" seems hardly worth making. Who,
short ol the Marquis tie Sade, would spring a
full-blown term paper at the last minute? Of
course this does not prevent "minor" papers
Irom being assigned on short notice, as hap
pened last quarter in an Economic De
velopment in a Cilohal I nvironment class.
( I lie topics were given out two weeks before
the due date, which was Monday of Dead
Week.)
In another winter class ol mine, the in
structors evaded the admonition against "ex
traordinary assignments (or) additional
course meetings in order to 'catch up' in
course presentations" by passing out an extra
"optional" ungraded problem set on Mon
day til Dead Week, which they "strongly re
commended" we do for practice on the latest
material in preparation for the final.
Possibly t lie best example of the irony (Did
someone say "hypocrisy"?) ol Dead Week
concerns the finals themselves. In the same
I ime Schedule where the policy statement
says "instructors are strongly discouraged

from making use of I lie Dead Week period
lor final examinations," I lie exam sehedule
says thai finals scheduled lor the last period
may he moved to the Thursday ol Dead
Week.
In fact. the spring exam sehedule looks
downright criminal. "Dead Week" runs from
Sunday to Wednesday; then, after a whole
one-day study period, finals are held oil Fri
day and Saturday and then Monday through
Wednesday! Somebody's gotta he kidding.
I realize that a 10-weck quarter is already
too short to cut hack on the academic work
load during "Dead Week." Hut there is
another solution: lengthen the quarter by ad
ding one or two reading days (in addition to a
lull weekend) between the end ol classes and
the start of exams.
I el s face it, folks: the only thing dead
about Dead Week is how the students feel
trying to handle regular problem sets and
papers while trying to prepare for exams. It's
time this farce was replaced with some hon
est reading days.
