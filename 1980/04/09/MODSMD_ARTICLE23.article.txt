# No reporter completely unbiased
## 
### 
When I was informed that I
had heen selected to write a col
umn for the Daily, the opinions
editors gave me a printed sheet
on which were inscribed various
pieces of advice for aspiring col
umnists. Among these was the
suggestion that part of my re
sponsibility was to acknowledge
both sides of any argument I
wrote about.
Although this advice sounds
harmless enough, it's not very
realistic. For example, I think
President Jimmy Carter's regist
ration proposal is evil and stupid.
I am therefore not the best
source for the arguments in favor
of registration. Admittedly, it
might be an effective technique
lor me to write as though I have
an open mind on the issue, but to
use such a technique does not
make me any more responsible.
It is not my intention to comp
lain about the difficulty of fol
lowing the Daily's advice, or to
critici/e whoever wrote that
sheet. Rather. I merely wish to
point out that the Daily is ex
pressing an idea here that is vir
tually universal in popular
American journalism, that the
goal of the journalist (and par
ticularly of the reporter) is to be
"objective."
This might seem like an ad
mirable idea, but in many ways it
does more harm than good. Only
a person who hasn't thought
much about it will maintain that
it is possible for any reporter to
be completely "objective," that
is, completely detached and un
biased. As Walter I .ippmann ob
served, "the facts we see depend

on where we ;ire placed and the
habits of our eyes."
This is of course not ti> say thai
there aren't more and less biased

accounts of events. But a lot of
people I talk with seem to have a
pretty simplistic idea of how to
judge objectivity; their assump
tion seems to be that any publica
tion not obviously of the right or
the left is objective. Newsweek
magazine and The New York
limes are thus often cited as
"objective" publications.
What these people don't
realize is that "moderatism" is as
much an ideology, as much a way
ol looking at the world, as Mar
xism is. And Newsweek anil I'lie
New York limes reflect "mod
erate" values, just as I'ruvdu re
llcets leftist values. One may
agree with the values expressed
by one publication and disagree
with those of another, but it is
naive to assume that the publica
tions one agrees with are
"value-free."
Consider Newsweek, for
example, which claims to cover
the news "objectively." How is it
objective to devote substantial
space to the repression of Soviet
dissidents (which I oI course find
reprehensible) while often ignor
ing the widespread torture and
murder that goes on under re
gimes which the U.S. govern
ment considers more "friendly"?
(I low much have you read about
repression in Pakistan lately?)
How was it objectively deter
mined that the Soviet Union's
(again reprehensible) invasion of
its neighbor Afghanistan was a
greater in justice than China's in
vasion of its neighbor Vietnam?
Why is starvation in Cambodia
newsworthy while starvation in
East Timor is not? Is it objective
to refer to the Chinese people, as
Newsweek did last year, as

"mindless blue ants"?
Don't misunderstand me â€” I
don't think the reporters or
editors of Newsweek conspire to
mislead us in their news cover-

age. I ike anyone else, they sim
ply see, select and report the
news according to their pre
judices. They do mislead us,
however, in their claim to be ob
jective. To the extent we buy this

claim, we arc aetingas tensors on
our own awareness. To rely sol
ely on Time, Newsweek, the net
work news or any single souree is
to deny ourselves a balanced
view.
We all make a lot of decisions
every day on the basis ol the in
formation we receive through
the news media. One ol the ad
vantages of this country is that
we have a I'ree press, but I'm not
sure that many people take ad
vantage of this. All of us should
check out the publications avail
able of the left and the right
rather than simply consuming
the "party line" put out by the
major media.
