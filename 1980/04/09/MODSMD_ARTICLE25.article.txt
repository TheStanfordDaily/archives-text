# Medical School celebrates its 20th year on campus

The year 1980 marks the 20th anniversary of the
move of the University's School of Medicine from
San Francisco to its present facilities.
-Formerly owned by both the University and the
city of Palo Alto, the Stanford Hospital was com
bined with the School of Medicine to form the
University Medical Center.
The opening of the Med Center occurred at a
time of great growth and ferment in biomedical
research, according to Dr. Lawrence Crowley, act
ing vice president for medical affairs and dean of
the School of Medicine.
Those at the Med Center, then and now, remain
firm in their belief that a combination hospital
and-research center draws the most capable faculty
and practitioners to train the most well qualified
doctors.
"It is in this spirit (of combining scientist and
teacher) that teaching, research and patient care
have evolv ed here. Research, both basic and clini-
Cal, has flourished. The school has made impressive
contributions," said Crowley.
But the Med Center remains unique in its com
mitment to serving the needs of local doctors and
their patients, as well as those of the resident fa
culty.
When Palo Alto finally sold its share of the hos
pital to the University in 1968, the agreement
stipulated that local doctors would have use of 370
of the hospital's beds for 40 years.
Controversy flared recently when the hospital
announced a "closed staff' policy barring local
doctors from use of certain hospital-based
facilities. The 40 to 50 doctors already possessing
such privileges were still allowed use of the
facilities which include: anesthesia, neurology,
pathology, cardiology and other highly specialized
laboratories.
Deliberations between the University and local
doctors have yet to resolve this issue. However, a
tentative report has been released that suggests
certain local doctors be given limited use of the
special facilities, though how these doctors will be
picked was left unclear.
Among the most notable achievements of the
Medical Center are:
— A clearer understanding of DNA, the primary
genetic material of living things.
"Twenty years ago we regarded DNA ... as
simply being a construction manual responsible for
cell structure and the enzymes that made the cell

work. We now know that DNA is a molecule with
considerable flexibility and plasticity. Its dynamic
behavior involves many functions," said Nobel
Laureate Arthur Kornberg.
— The discovery of the techniques of transplant
ing genes from one species to another which ushered
in a new era of genetic engineering.
Though such "bacterial factories" are controv
ersial, the replacement of defective genes could aid
treatment of crippling genetic diseases, said Dr.
Paul Berg.
— The success of heart transplants is now as
good as those of kidney transplants, according to
Dr. Norman Shumway, heart transplant pioneer.
Since the program began in 1968, transplants
have been performed in 186 patients; 74 are still
liv ing. Seventy percent of the patients are alive one
year after the surgery; 50 percent survive five
years.
— The development of the medical linear ac
celerator that raised the cure rates for cancers such
as Hodgkin's disease, related lymphomas and
cancer of the prostate and bladder, said Dr. Henry
Kaplan, professor of radiology.
The treatment, called TLI, has improved the
survival rate of Hodgkin's disease victims trom 30
percent to 86 percent.
— The development of a technique to isolate the
missing clotting factor of hemophiliacs leading to a
treatment now used worldwide.
— The discovery that the brain has its own opiate
receptors.
It is not yet know what role these receptors play
in brain function and behavioral disturbances.
The Med Center also has big plans for moderni
zation of the Hospital and Clinics over the next six
years.
Administrators would like to implement a $97
million program to renovate and remodel depart
ments bringing them up to present city codes and to
create more space.
If approved by the Hospital Board of Directors
and the University Board of Trustees, the work will
begin in 1983.
Hospital Executive Director Peter Levin stres
sed, "The plan goes beyond the mere correction of
deficiencies. It is designed to make the Hospital
more functional in terms of its mission as a teaching
institution, a base for research, a regional center
for special care, and a comprehensive community
hospital."
The Med Center currently admits 23,000 pa
tients annually, cared for by a faculty, including
volunteer clinical faculty, of around 1800, assisted
by over 500 medical students.
