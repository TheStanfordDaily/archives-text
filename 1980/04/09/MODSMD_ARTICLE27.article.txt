# Viking fails after 4 years on Mars
## 
### George Alexander The Los Angeles Times 
PASADLNA, Calif. — After
more than 3 1 /: years of yeoman
service on a far distant shore, the
Viking Lander 2 spacecraft has
ceased functioning on the planet
Mars, according to officials at the
Jet Propulsion Laboratory near
here. Its end apparently was
caused by battery failure.
The unmanned, three-legged
spacecraft made a controlled
landing on the rocky, reddish
Martian plain known as Utopia
on Sept. 3, 1976, just about six
weeks after its identical twin,
Viking Lander I, had made the
first such American feat, coming
down on a different sector of
Mars.
In the intervening time since

its landing, the cameras, scien
tific instruments and associated
equipment aboard the No. 2
Lander have served science well.
More than 1800 images of the
Martian surface were taken, in
cluding the first pictures of
winter frost on another planet.
In addition, Viking Lander 2's
little steam shovel-like scoop
dug up samples of the Martian
soil that automated biology and
chemistry laboratories aboard
the spacecraft analyzed for signs
of life on the Red Planet (none
was found), and its meteorologi
cal sensors recorded the winds,
pressures and water vapor
changes of two full Martian win
ters. For a machine. Viking
Lander 2 had lived a full life.
J PL spokesmen said that the

spacecraft stopped working
sometime between Jan. 31 and
March 15, the times of its last
two transmissions to Earth. The
January report, consisting of a
picture and a weather bulletin,
was intelligible but the mid-
March one was not.
With the demise of Viking
Lander No. 2, only Viking
Lander No. 1 and Viking Orbiter
No. 1 are still functioning.
Lander No. 1 is expected to con

tinuc operating through a direct
radio link to Earth through
1990, hut Orbiter No. 1, after
completing a new series of man
euvers and high-altitude recon
naissance passes this spring, is
expected to run out of its
supplies of control gas this sum
mer. When it does, it will become
inoperative along with Viking
Orbiter No. 2; that spacecraft
stopped functioning in July,
1978, when its gas stores were
exhausted.
