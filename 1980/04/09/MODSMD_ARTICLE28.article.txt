# Search committee seeks student input
## 
### Jill Liscom Staff Writer 
Gathering student input on
selection of a new University
president may prove more dif
ficult than the student search
committee had planned.
At a previously-advertised
student forum held Monday
night to get student opinion on
important criteria in choosing a
president, only three people
showed up — two reporters and
an alumnus.
However, Council of Presi
dents member Sibbv Freeman,
also a student search committee
member, said he was not dis
couraged by the turnout. "It's
not the students' responsibility
to come to us — it's our respon
sibility to go out and seek their
input," he said.
Freeman added that the com
mittee has already sent out let
ters to house associates (RAs)
requesting to meet with students
at sherry hours or house meet
ings.
The student committee, along
with faculty and alumni search
committees, are now in the first
tier of a two-tier process. Their
current task is to gather names of
nominees and to establish
criteria by which to evaluate the
candidates. In the second step of
the process, a selection commit
tee of Board of Trustees mem
bers will evaluate the nomina
tions to make final recommenda
tions.
At the meeting Monday night,
the committee members discus

sed how much impact the student
committee can have in the over
all selection process.
Freeman said he thinks the
student input can be influential
because the trustees' selection
committee is operating on a con
sensus basis. "If we say we're
strongly against someone,
they're not going to go ahead,"
he commented.
COP member Laura Mead
added that "to the extent that we
think our input will he taken into
account, it's going to be taken
into account." If the student
committee members take them
selves seriously, "we're going to
he taken seriously," she said.
Although the committee is ac
tively seeking names of
nominees from students, the
members acknowledged that
they will probably have more in
fluence in presenting criteria by
which to evaluate the candidates.
One of the main criteria
suggested at the meeting was the
ability to represent the Univer
sity well as an institution of
higher education and to maintain
the prestige of the University as a
research institution.
However, those present
agreed that this public relations
function must be balanced with
an awareness of student con
cerns and a commitment to "be
ing a watchdog" for high quality
undergraduate teaching and ad
vising. Several students said they
feel teaching and advising have
traditionally received little atten
tion compared to research.
