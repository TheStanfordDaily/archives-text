# Competition returns to retail gas market
## 
### John M. Berry Jane Seaberry The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON —Competi-
tion is creeping back into the re
tain gasoline market as oil be
comes easier to get around the
world.
Service stations across the na
tion are staying open longer
hours and on weekends. While
gasoline prices continue to
climb, profit margins for refiners
and retailers are shrinking.
In the first three months of this
year, gasoline use nationally
dropped more than eight percent
below the levels a year earlier.
As of the end of March, gasoline
stocks were at near-record
levels, up more than 15 percent
from 1979, according to the
American Petroleum Institute.
More gas available
The big inventories have
prompted some refiners to begin
to make more gasoline available
to their dealers. And the drop in
use is pushing service station
operators to stay open longer in
an attempt to sell more gasoline
now that they have it to sell. In
the process, some dealers have
begun to trim their markups to
boost sales.
Not only gasoline is in ample
supply. Home heating oil and
diesel fuel consumption is down
about 15 percent from last year
as a result of much higher prices
and a warmer-than-normal
winter. Stocks of those products
at the end of March were 174
million barrels, the API said, up
more than 50 percent from 1979.
Inventories of residual fuel oil,
the heaviest of the refined fuels
used by utilities and industry, are
up by one-fourth while use is
down nearly 16 percent. As a re
sult, residual fuel prices are
crumbling.

Venezuela, which exports
large quantities of the heavy fuel
to the U.S. East Coast, hascut its
price by as much as five dollars a
barrel for high-sulfur residual
fuel in the last two weeks. U.S.
refiners, such as Exxon,
have cut their prices, too. and
there are reports some cargoes
have been sold on the spot mar
ket for as little as $11 a barrel.
Venezuelan officials, in fact,
were in Washington last week
trying to convince top Depart
ment of Energy officials they
should buy 20 million barrels of
residual fuel, which would have
to be stored in above-ground
tanks, for the nation's strategic
petroleum reserve.
Purchases of crude oil for the
reserve have been postponed at
least until June 1981, by the Car
ter administration in order not to
encourage further increases in
world oil prices. Saudi Arabia
also warned the administration
not to add to the reserve if it
wished the Saudis to continue to
produce 9.5 million barrels (if oil
a day, one million more than
their normal ceiling.
Crude oil stocks
Meanwhile, crude oil stocks in
the United States and in several
other industrial nations are at re
cord levels. U.S. crude stocks hit
362.5 million barrels at the end
of March, according to the API.
up about 50 million
from last year. The In
ternational Energy Agency in
Paris estimates crude oil stocks
of major industrial nations stand
at nearly 2.9 billion barrels, a re
cord for the end of a winter and
up 11 percent from 1979.
DOE officials said the unusu
ally high crude, oil and product
inventories in the United States
are dragging down the operating
rates for refineries.
