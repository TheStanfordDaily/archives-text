# Music building plans spare Storey house site for now
## 
### 
According to Cliff Morse of
the University Planning Of
fice, the recent Storey fire has
not affected plans for the new
Braun Music Center to be
built in the lot adjoining
Storey and Lathrop houses.
Construction of the building
should begin in July, 198 I.he
said.
The plans include pos
sibilities for expansion into
the Storey house site. But
since the University has de
cided to rebuild Storey,
Morse explained, the Plan
ning Office has advised the
architects. Peter Winklestein
and his colleague Steven
Perls, not to gear their designs
for an immediate use of the
site.
Presently the building is
designed to occupy 35,000
square feet, and its eventual
expansion to 80,000 square
feet may not be for another
30 to 50 years. Morse said.
Housing classrooms, teach
ing studios, offices, rehearsal
facilities, and Music Library,
the new building will provide
only about half the space the
department needs, so some
facilities will still remain at
the Knoll.

Dinkelspiel Auditorium
will be incorporated into the
design and the architects will
also have to consider the
building's pivotal location be
tween the academic and resi
dential parts of the campus.
(The site extends from south
of White Plaza to L.asuen
Mall.)
"We also have to consider
it in terms of urban design,"
Winklestein said, "How it fits
into the campus master plan
as well as how it can best meet
the needs of the Music De
partment."
Marcia Tanner, a spokes
woman for the Music De
partment, explained that
there are three ways of "mas
sing" the building in order to
continue to allow pedestrian
traffic through the site. The
building would either be
compact with space around
the outside or have interior
courtyards that allow a pas
sageway for traffic.
Other aspects of the design
are more complicated. Be
cause of the noise from
nearby White Plaza the build
ing will have to be well insu
lated to prevent sound from

disturbing the musicians in
side, said John Planting, an
administrative assistant of the
Music Department.
"A music building presents
a lot of interesting issues."
Winklestein said. "Acoustics
for instance: we need to ad
dress the question of sound
isolation between the spaces
as well as the proper acousti
cal characteristics within a
space. We're also concerned
with creating dual purpose
spaces that could be used for
performance as well as re
hearsals and classes."
The $6.3 million center is
partially funded by a dona
tion from the Carl F Braun
Trust of Alhambra. The ba
lance of the cast will be raised
during construction of the
building.
Schematic designs for the
building will be completed by
the first week of May, Morse
said, while preliminary plans
should be ready for presenta
tion at the June meeting of
the Board of Trustees. 1 983 is
a conservative estimate for
completion of the building.
