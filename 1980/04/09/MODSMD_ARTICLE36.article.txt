# Zappa – not crazy after all these years
## 
### 
Never having been to a
Zappa concert before, 1 was
shocked by his performance
— not because of the crudity,
rudeness, or craziness, but
because of the lack of it. After
all of the horror stories I had
heard about Frank Zappa, he
didn't live up to any of them
when he played here at
Maples Pavilion on Thursday.
Paul Simon may still be crazy
after all these years, but
Frank Zappa sure isn't. In
stead. his concert was surpris
ingly tasteful and his on-stage
antics were relatively low key.
In general, however, the
performance was lacking in
ilare and enthusiasm. Al
though Zappa seemed to get
more into the concert as lie
went on. he was missing the
emotional impact most per
formers have when they ap
pear live on stage.
But whatever he lacked in
showmanship, he made up tor
in talent. Coupled with his
aloofness as a performer was
his undeniably great guitar
playing, which made the
whole thing worthwhile.
Short supply
Although the audience
seemed delighted when
Zappa played guitar, perhaps
the demand seemed so great
because the music was in such
short supply. Zappa would
casually stroll up to the front
of the stage to play or take the
microphone to sing for a
while, but only inbetween

long intervals where lie would
he at the hack <>t the stage
with his back turned to the
audience tuning his guitar.
Zappa also passed the time
sauntering around the stage
smoking cigarettes, or doing
little Charlie Chaplin-like
movements with his arms and
giving a little kick here and
there in accompaniment to
the music.
Zappa also wandered lip to
the front ol the stage occa
sionally to accept the variety
of gifts that people would

hand up to him.
First there was a dressy
white tuxedo jacket with
black trim, which Zappa
ceremonially donned and
wore for the next song. Then
throughout the concert, the
gifts kept coming: another
jacket, a cigarette, a flower,
and last but not least, a large
sheet painted with a senti
mental message in old Zappa
style. "The D.T.'s think
you're an asshole, too."
which Zappa proudly held up
for the audience to see.
Continuous music
And through it all. the
music just kept coming, song
after song, with no break.
From the time the band came
out promptly at N p.m. (prob
ably the first musical perfor
mance ever to start on
schedule) until Zappa first
left the stage at 9:45. the
music never ceased.
It is almost unfair to refer
to his band as back-up voc
alists or musicians, because in
terms of time they performed
much more than Zappa him
self. Ray White was excep
tional. both on guitar and
vocals. Without the band.
Zappa would have been lost.
Most of Zappa's songs were
from his new material, in an

upbeat, jazzed-up style.
There were a tew special ef
fects using a large movie sc
reen behind the stage which
complemented Zappa's songs
well, such as a huge mouth
with a tongue hanging out to
help visualize "Charlie's Big
Mouth."
Two encores
By the end of the perfor
mance, Zappa was more tired
up and performing at his best,
his lingers plucking out notes

on the guitar at an amazing
speed. At the end of his two
hour performance. Zappa
reappeared for his first en
core. highlighted by a great
rendition of "Dancing Fool."
After his first encore, the con
tinued applause and stomping
of the crowd, bouncing the
gym floor up and down, drew
him out again for a final song,
"Chunga's Revenge." which
was truly a fine example of his
guitar playing ability.

Paul Simon may still be crazy
after all these years, but
Frank Zappa sure isn't. In
stead. his concert was surpris
ingly tasteful and his on-stage
antics were relatively low key.
In general, however, the
performance was lacking in
ilare and enthusiasm. Al
though Zappa seemed to get
more into the concert as lie
went on. he was missing the
emotional impact most per
formers have when they ap
pear live on stage.
But whatever he lacked in
showmanship, he made up tor
in talent. Coupled with his
aloofness as a performer was
his undeniably great guitar
playing, which made the
whole thing worthwhile.
Short supply
Although the audience
seemed delighted when
Zappa played guitar, perhaps
the demand seemed so great
because the music was in such
short supply. Zappa would
casually stroll up to the front
of the stage to play or take the
microphone to sing for a
while, but only inbetween

long intervals where lie would
he at the hack <>t the stage
with his back turned to the
audience tuning his guitar.
Zappa also passed the time
sauntering around the stage
smoking cigarettes, or doing
little Charlie Chaplin-like
movements with his arms and
giving a little kick here and
there in accompaniment to
the music.
Zappa also wandered lip to
the front ol the stage occa
sionally to accept the variety
of gifts that people would

hand up to him.
First there was a dressy
white tuxedo jacket with
black trim, which Zappa
ceremonially donned and
wore for the next song. Then
throughout the concert, the
gifts kept coming: another
jacket, a cigarette, a flower,
and last but not least, a large
sheet painted with a senti
mental message in old Zappa
style. "The D.T.'s think
you're an asshole, too."
which Zappa proudly held up
for the audience to see.
Continuous music
And through it all. the
music just kept coming, song
after song, with no break.
From the time the band came
out promptly at N p.m. (prob
ably the first musical perfor
mance ever to start on
schedule) until Zappa first
left the stage at 9:45. the
music never ceased.
It is almost unfair to refer
to his band as back-up voc
alists or musicians, because in
terms of time they performed
much more than Zappa him
self. Ray White was excep
tional. both on guitar and
vocals. Without the band.
Zappa would have been lost.
Most of Zappa's songs were
from his new material, in an

upbeat, jazzed-up style.
There were a tew special ef
fects using a large movie sc
reen behind the stage which
complemented Zappa's songs
well, such as a huge mouth
with a tongue hanging out to
help visualize "Charlie's Big
Mouth."
Two encores
By the end of the perfor
mance, Zappa was more tired
up and performing at his best,
his lingers plucking out notes

on the guitar at an amazing
speed. At the end of his two
hour performance. Zappa
reappeared for his first en
core. highlighted by a great
rendition of "Dancing Fool."
After his first encore, the con
tinued applause and stomping
of the crowd, bouncing the
gym floor up and down, drew
him out again for a final song,
"Chunga's Revenge." which
was truly a fine example of his
guitar playing ability.
