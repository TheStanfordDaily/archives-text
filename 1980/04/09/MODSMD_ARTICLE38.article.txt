# Artist responds to realism in photos and life
## 
### 
The ver> small figure of a
woman looks up at
Michelangelo's Da\id. She is
impressed, he nonchalant.
Harry Killas likes this interac
tion: the comparison or. better
perhaps, the juxtaposition of dif
ferent forms, cultures, ideas —
most apparent!} spontaneous, all
provoking laughter or surprise,
or at least, a thoughtful second
look.
Killas' photograph Friend
With David is one of 32 prints
which are on exhibit at the
Bechtel International Center.
Manv of the photographs in
clude such comparisons, which
Killas found while studying in
Europe 2 1 : years ago.
He mav seem to be the prove
rbial Westerner with camera, try
ing to make humorous or ironic
statements bv placing the foreign
with the American, the round
with the square. But his work is
free of such heavy-handedness.
His photographs are fresh and
intelligent , many capture coinci
dental moments — the woman
and the statue caught in the same
pose —or typical photographer's
subjects, worked out with wit
and a sophisticated sense of
humor.
The spontaneity is enhanced

by a doubled sense of depth. "All
art. writing, painting, photo
graphy should stand bv itself."
Killas explained in an interview
last week. •"You don't have to
know who did it to know it's
good. Henry IV is a good play,
even if you don't know it's bv
Shakespeare.
"But. also, for those who
know something about the artist.

about me. the work should mean
something special ... A part of
myself does go into my photo
graphy."
Yet. Killas said, he is not
"wholly convinced that you can
put as much of yourself into
photography as vou could into a
poem or a play."
He holds "the written word in
more esteem, in general, because

you can got a lot more of yourself
into writing than you can with a
camera . . . unless you're a mas
ter like Ansel Adams "
In one sense, though, "litera
ture and photograph) are much
the same. For those who con
sider photographs to he an art.
you can use the camera" to catch
strong, clear aesthetic values.
"I like fairly straightforward
documentary - type pictures,"
Killas said. '"1 hate to use labels
. . . hut I think I respond hest to
'realism.' "
With this emphasis. Killas ad
mitted. photography sometimes
seems too technical. It suffers
from inherent limits of craft,
which hother Killas because "I
respond to things visually and
aurally. I tend to look at things
photographically and also
cinematically." By the last, he
said, he meant that he interprets
an artistic subject by combining
sight, sound and sense of motion.
"I've been interested in
filmmaking for a lortg time,
longer than photography. But,
photography was more accessi
ble. It took less time and money
and I considered still photo
graphy to he a surrogate for
filmmaking.
"But then. 1 decided that was

like cutting oft my nose to spite
my face."
So. Killas said he may enter a
film school after he receives his
master's degree from Stanford in
modern thought and literature.
He also is considering law
school and trips "working hack
ward through Asia." and to the
Mideast. "China is the place to
he. now," Killas explained.
"Americans suddenly are in
terested in what goes on there
. . . and I've always wanted to see
the Mideast.
He also hopes to develop
American awareness of a culture
closer to home: this quarter, he is
teaching a class on Canadian fic
tuin "For a country which shares
half of the North American land
mass, Americans know very little
about Canada."
Through literature and photo
graphy. Killas said he would like
to bring together different cul
tural ideas and images: "I want
to show people who have never
been there what it's like . . . and
for those who have. I offer them
another person's interpreta
tion."
(Killas' exhibit is at the Bechtel
International Center until April
30.)
