# 'Being There' isn't quite there
## 
### 
I la! Ashby's Being There fol
lows the lite ol Chance (Peter
Sellers), a man 111 his forties
meticulously dressed in a three
piece suit with short silvery hair
and an empty expression on his
face. Chance is a man with no
past, an orphan that was weaned
on television which has been his
only contact with the outside
world. He was raised and
employed as a gardener by a
wealthy owner of a Washington
town house, protected from the
squalor outside by walls past
which he was forbidden to ven
ture.
Chance is a spectator in the
world. Inside him there is an in
tellectual as well as emotional
void that is filled by television.
Chance is an illiterate moron
capable of talking about only one
thing: gardening. At times lie
goes through life as if in a trance,
like an automaton. His eyes be
come glued to the tube and he
becomes completely oblivious to
what is happening around him as
his body begins to mimic the ac
tion in a television commercial.
There is something pitiful and
disturbing about Chance as Sel
lers portrays him: he is not a per
son and it is this quality that is
likely to leave you frustrated at
the end (if the film. It is the same
kind of feeling that you are likely
to have when watching theatre of
the absurd. Being There is a film
that makes do with one idea: that
we live in a world where appear
ances count the most and that we
are preoccupied with ourselves.
Once you get the point, you wait
for something else to happen.
Chance has the quality that lie
acts as a mirror for everyone's
self-indulgences and imagina
tions. All of his pauses are taken
by those around him as signs of
his "intense" personality, his
trite phrases as deep metaphors,
and his misconceptions, as when
he asks bewildered questions in
an elevator, as humor.
More and more people are
taken in by this quality and
Chance becomes, through a
series of accidents, the most
likely candidate for the presi
dency of the United States.
Chance becomes a trusted
friend of a dying "kingmaker"
and magnate Benjamin Rand

(Melvin Douglas), and a lover of
sorts to his wife. Eve (Shirley
M aciaine).
There are some outstanding
performances in Being There.
Douglas gi\cs us a glimpse into
the tough and yet brittle person
ality of a man who likes to think
he is in control of the political
world and who, like his turn of
the century counterparts, the
Robber Barons, makes the
politicians come to him. Rand
needs someone to trust and is
completely taken in by Chance
and makes him his adviser. Rand
admires Chance's "balance" and
straightforwardness. This is how
Chance meets the president
(Jack Warden) who quotes
Chance's metaphors about the
seasons 011 national television
and who has trouble satisfying
his wife at night.
Shirley Maclainc is her best in
years as Eve Rand who discovers
herself through "Chauncey" and
exclaims "You set me free!"
When Chance refuses to suc
cumb to her advances, vacantly
staring off into space he is simply
being true to Ins friend Rand or
"Ben" as Chance calls him. Un
able to control her passion. Eve
tries again. She strokes his head
and kisses him feverishly with 110
result. How does he want it? "I
just like to watch. Eve," is the
reply as Chance continues to
stare at the TV at which a
glimpse of understanding ap
pears on Eve's face and she goes
into an orgy of autoeroticism on
a huge bearskin at the foot of the
bed. She leaves with tears of
happiness in her eyes as Chance
continues to stare blankly at the
box untouched by what has hap
pened. How can anyone have a
blank expression on his face with
such a woman at his feet?
The film is definitely not a
lighthearted comedy though the
audience did manage a few re
strained laughs when 1 saw the
film. It is trying to convey a mes
sage about the emptiness of a
generation brought up on televi
sion and political corruption.
It lias the same failings as Jerzy
Kosinski's book which it follows
closely in that it takes an idea
and beats you over the head with
it.
