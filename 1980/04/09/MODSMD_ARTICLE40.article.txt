# Film of 'The War at Home' hits home
## 
### 
Campuses were home to more
longhairs and fewer preprofes
sionals. Weathermen predicted
violent revolution, not
meteorological phenomena.
Students were working for Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, not Rep.
John Anderson. Afghanistan
was as obscure as the (iult ol
Tonkin is now.
That was many years ago
long before the people who may
do the same thing now started
watching the evening news or
reading a newspaper. l or them.
;i film like the War at Home is
the equivalent ol Hoots. Their
(our) Kunta Kintes are the
people who had the courage to
stand up to an immoral warat the
\er> beginning ol the movement,
to brave the cries of treason and
Communism that were thrown in
their faces.
l ike Roots, The Warat Home
goes beyond the written history
to an oral tradition it captures in
interviews with many ot the prin
cipal figures. And it fictionalizes
nothing — all ol the action
scenes are authentic and drawn
from the liles ot Madison, Wis
consin TV stations and other
video archives. The filmmakers
and researchers performed a
gargantuan task in sifting
through the thousands ol feet ol
footage they found, and have
compiled a remarkably cohesive
chronicle, considering the disor
der they had to start with.
As Co-director Barry Alexan
der Brown said recently in a
Daily interview, "We set out to
tell the inside story of the anti

war movement at the University
of Wisconsin."
Hven without the interviews
and retrospection and amazing
clips of the university adminis
trators sounding totally unrepen
tant, this would he a poweiiul
film. The shots ol students sitting
in at the main building there re
ally brought home the strife here
in America; the police went into
the building, clubs swinging,
clearing everything in front of
them like a battery of jackham
mers and jackasses/ And that
was just the beginning, in 1967.
Later films show them teargas
sing people and driving around
in jeeps with nets of barbed
wired attached to the bumpers,
eight feet high and six wide, to
prevent the jeeps from getting
bogged down in crowds. As
Norman Mailer asked a Chicago
cop in his book, Miami and the
Si('f>e of "On the days
when you take it out. how do you
get the old ilesh oil?" When the
National Guard streams onto the
Madison campus 111 a convoy of
armed jeeps, there can be no
doubt: this is war. When the
police intervene and brwtali/e a
block party some students were
holding, it is clear that the
mainstream lifestyle is feeling
threatened by the new surge of
enthusiasm. I low can the Sy stem
live on and keep its people 111
plastic climate-controlled offices
il all those hippies can dance in
the streets on a workday?
I he cinematography 111 this
move is especially striking, hit
ting home in a way that descrip

tions trom survivors can nevei
be. It can stir anger 111 \nu: there
is no more ellective wa\ ti

it to unite against .1 common
enemy, and that is what main
did in Madison.
Another uniting factor was tin
music, some ol which is on tin.

l ike Roots, The Warat Home
goes beyond the written history
to an oral tradition it captures in
interviews with many ot the prin
cipal figures. And it fictionalizes
nothing — all ol the action
scenes are authentic and drawn
from the liles ot Madison, Wis
consin TV stations and other
video archives. The filmmakers
and researchers performed a
gargantuan task in sifting
through the thousands ol feet ol
footage they found, and have
compiled a remarkably cohesive
chronicle, considering the disor

As Co-director Barry Alexan

Daily interview, "We set out to
tell the inside story of the anti

war movement at the University
of Wisconsin."
Hven without the interviews
and retrospection and amazing
clips of the university adminis
trators sounding totally unrepen

film. The shots ol students sitting
in at the main building there re

in America; the police went into
the building, clubs swinging,
clearing everything in front of
them like a battery of jackham

was just the beginning, in 1967.
Later films show them teargas
sing people and driving around
in jeeps with nets of barbed

eight feet high and six wide, to

Campuses were home to more
longhairs and fewer preprofes
sionals. Weathermen predicted
violent revolution, not
meteorological phenomena.
Students were working for Sen.
Eugene McCarthy, not Rep.
John Anderson. Afghanistan
was as obscure as the (iult ol
Tonkin is now.
That was many years ago
long before the people who may
do the same thing now started
watching the evening news or
reading a newspaper. l or them.
