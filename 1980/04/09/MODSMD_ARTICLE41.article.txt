Tornadoes ravage Midwest, South
Dozens of tornadoes born in a "family of storms" splin

The National Weather Service said that since noon Mon

in Wisconsin, four in Missouri, three in Oklahoma, three in
Texas, two in Illinois, two in Mississippi, one in Kansas and
one in Tennessee.
The National Severe Storms Forecast Center in Kansas
City warned that more were likely. The National Weather
Service said the tornadoes and thunderstorms that lingered
in the region were "part of a family of storms."
In the St. Louis suburb of Florissant. 96 homes were
damaged and five were flattened in a tornado late Monday.
At least 42 persons were injured in Arkansas alone,
including 20 hurt early yesterday when a twister hit West
Memphis, just across the Mississippi Ri\er from its sister
city in Tennessee.
At least SI million in damage was reported at the West
Memphis Municipal airport where a dozen private airplanes
were destroyed and at least 10 other planes were damaged.
In central Texas, one man was killed, another was in
jured. 15 houses were destroyed and 12 were damaged as
tornadoes struck Round Rock, Lund and Elgin.
Damage estimates ranged up to SI million in the eastern
Oklahoma city of Poteau, hit by high winds and baseball
size hail.
The tornadoes were spawned in a atmospheric battle
between temperatures of 101 in Texas and the low 30s in
North Dakota, where as much as 6 inches of snow fell
Monday.
Mount St. Helens volcano stabilizes
VANCOUVER. Wash. — New earthquakes shook
Mount St. Helens yesterday, but scientists said the volcano
has stabilized and the current danger is from flooding or
mudflows caused by melting snow rather than an eruption
of molten lava.

Property owners and workers were being allowed to re
turn to the area yesterday, but tourists still were being kept
at a distance.
"It's in a stable mode of eruption. It is still a minor
eruption." said Donald Mullineaux.a U.S. Geological Sur
vey volcanologist.
At 11:30 a.m., what scientists referred to as a double
event quake registered 4.5 on the Richter scale. University
of Washington seismologists described a double-event
quake as two quakes that overlap.
"These are intermittent eruptions. It rests for five or 10
minutes and then erupts again with ash and steam," said
Norm Anderson of the U.S. Forest Service. "Some of the
edge (of the crater) has sloughed in, but it hasn't collapsed
to our knowledge. There's not been a major collapse of the
crater."
The 9677-foot volcano last erupted 123 years ago.
Two earthquakes measuring about 4.0 on the Richter
scale shook the mountain within a two-hour period earlier
yesterday. But a spokesman for University of Washington
scientists said there apparently was no significance to the
closeness of the quakes.
A Forest Service statement issued yesterday said instru
ments on the mountain "have shown no significant changes
in uplift or tilting of the ground. All of these observations
imply that there is no indication that a major eruption of
molten rock will occur in the near future."
'Sold* five-year-old girl found safe
SAN BERNARDINO — Mar> Agnes Cahail. 5. who
was allegedly sold by her cousin for pinball money to a
com icted sex offender, returned to San Bernardino County
yesterday afternoon after her early mornintz rescue in Red
Bluff.
John William Dickey. 41. of Riverside, was charged with
kidnapping in a San Bernardino County Municipal Court
warrant. Also in custody was the girl's cousin, who was
being held by juvenile authorities for investigation of kid
napping and was not identified because of his age.
Dickey had previously been sent to Patton State Hospital

in San Bernardino after he pleaded guilty to committing
lewd acts involving children. He was granted three years'
probation in March 1979. Dickey's bail was set at
$750,000.
"There is no apparent injury or trauma," officer Ray
McGregor said after the 5-year-old was examined earlier at
a Red Bluff hospital. The girl was found with the man who
police allege paid her 16-vear-old cousin $230 for her
Saturday.
The child will not stay with her family at present, au
thorities said. She and her 3-year-old brother Darrell will
be in the temporary care of Child Protection Services, a
county agency.
The San Bernardino County Sheriffs department issued
a statement late yesterday afternoon saying that there were
indications that the children's "home environment. . . was
not beneficial to them . . . particularly in view of the fact
that Mary was taken from the home in the early morning
hours without the knowledge of the parties charged with
(her) care."
Hie statement said that the investigation is continuing
and that no decision has been made about filing criminal
charges against the parents.
Cubans' flight incited by hard times
WASHINGTON — "We are sailing in a sea of difficul
ties. We have been in this sea for some time, but the shore is
far away."
In that way, Cuban President Fidel Castro candidly
acknowledged last December that his revolution had fallen
on hard times.
Popular disaffection for the regime has been dramatized
by the appearance of thousands of Cubans on the grounds
of the Peruvian embassy in recent days, seeking political
asylum.
The inundation of the embassy was touched off a week
ago when a Cuban policeman was killed in a cross-fire while
six Cubans seeking asylum were trying to crash their bus
onto the embassy grounds. The refugees came in droves a
few days later when the government withdrew its security

guards from the embassy and announced that those seeking
asylum would be allowed to leave.
Cuba currently receives $N million a day in aid from the
Soviet Union. But Soviet aid has not offset a number of
problems affecting the Cuban economy.
Much of the country's tobacco crop has been wiped out
by disease. In addition, "plant rot" is threatening Cuba's
vital sugar harvest. The U.S. economic embargo also is
frequently blamed for Cuban economic troubles.
Gov't puts pressure on U.S.O.C.
WASHINGTON — The Carter administration has indi
cated it may seek to revoke the tax-exempt status of the
U.S. Olympic Committee unless the committee votes to
boycott the Moscow Olympics this summer, the USOCs
executive director said yesterday.
The latest indication of screw-tightening came as the
administration held its final briefing for USOC members,
who are scheduled to vote, possibly this weekend, on
whether to send a team to the Moscow Games.
In response to a reporter's inquiry, USOC Executive
Director F. Don Miller quoted congressional sources as
saying the administration raised the possibility of lifting the
USOCs tax exemption in a meeting last week with congres
sional leaders.
Revoking the committee's tax exemption would require
congressional action. Both houses have gone on record in
favor of boycotting the Moscow Games, but stiff opposition
can be expected to using tax law for broader political pur
poses, one congressional source said yesterday.
