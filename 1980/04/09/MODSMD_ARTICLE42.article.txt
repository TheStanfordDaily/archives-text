# East Asian Studies Committee is seeking 'interim arrangement' to keep theme alive
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
The future of the proposed East
Asian Studies Theme House is still
unknown.
Despite two attempts b\ the East
Asian Studies Theme House prop
osal committee and Assoc. Dean for
Residential Education Norm
Robinson to arrive at an "interim
arrangement" until 19N2 (when the
program has been guaranteed hous
ing), proposals by both sides have
failed to produce a method for keep
ing the idea alive until then.
"East House" proponents were
told in early March that they would
occupy 610 Mayfield next year, fol
lowing a decision by the Office of
Residential Education to oust La
Maison Francaise from the Row.
However, on March 14. Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons over
turned that decision and allowed the
French House to return for one
more probationary year, thus rob
bing the East Asian Studies Prog
ram of a residence.
Sympathetic to the disappointed
East Asian Studies Committee.
Lyons said that he and Robinson

would seek to set up an "interim
arrangement" tor the program until
1982. when it could be assured due
to the building of a new housing
complex and the rebuilding of
Storey House.
Robinson met with two students
for the East Asian Studies House
"core committee." last Friday and
presented them with a plan for next
year. The associate dean offered
juniors Craig Trammell and Wolf
Brolley the use of a cluster of trail
ers in Manzanita Park, which could
house 32 students, and the use of an
eating club. Also, one trailer would
be reserved for a library and lan
guage laboratory for the program.
As an alternative, Robinson also
offered the use of a few rooms in the
Mirrielees Apartments or the Roble
Hall basement to the two represen
tatives.
Trammell and Brolley brought
back to the "core committee" news
of Robinson's proposals, but the
group decided Sunday night that the
proposals were not adequate.
"We went back to the core group.
It wasn't a unanimous decision, but
we came to the conclusion that the

Manzanita option was not in the
best interest of the program," said
Trammell.
According to Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, a strong faculty supporter
of an East Asian Studies House,
"The trailers don't offer any sense
of community whatsoever for the
group. It would be difficult to act
out the kind of forum that the East
Asian Studies Core Committee
wanted to see in the program. There
was a feeling that the East Asian
Studies House would have a couple
of strikes against it to start with."
The four-person committee.
Trammell. Brolley, Jeff Wong and
Steve Chelberg. returned to Robin
son on Monday with proposals of
their own. According to Wong,
"Norm regarded some of them as
totally unsatisfactory and others as
possible."
The group made basically two
counterproposals to Robinson,
Wong said. The first was a request
for another house. "We feel we are
entitled to a house because the East
Asian Studies House is being
punished for the French House
being put on probation," Wong

said. However. Robinson said "no
way," Wong added.
The second request was for a por
tion of a larger dorm, for instance a
c#fridor where at least the core
committee could live. Wong men
tioned that native American stu
dents currently have a similar ar
rangement at Roble Hall.
Although Robinson said he
would consider the corridor option,
Wong said, "the prevailing attitude
seems to be that it's too late in the
draw."
Trammell said he didn't think
Robinson was really in favor of that
option because it would break a
sense of community in the dorm it
self and also rob the dorm of
freshman housing.
Robinson said yesterday that he
would be making the decision and
that it would be announced in the
next couple of days, "certainly be
fore the draw starts."
The associate dean also said," I'm
disappointed that they didn't accept
the proposal (to house the program
in Manzanita). I do think it would
have worked."

rangement at Roble Hall.
Although Robinson said he
would consider the corridor option,
Wong said, "the prevailing attitude
seems to be that it's too late in the
draw."
Trammell said he didn't think
Robinson was really in favor of that
option because it would break a
sense of community in the dorm it
self and also rob the dorm of
freshman housing.
Robinson said yesterday that he
would be making the decision and
that it would be announced in the
next couple of days, "certainly be
fore the draw starts."
The associate dean also said," I'm
disappointed that they didn't accept
the proposal (to house the program
in Manzanita). I do think it would
have worked."
The future of the proposed East
Asian Studies Theme House is still
unknown.
Despite two attempts b\ the East
Asian Studies Theme House prop
osal committee and Assoc. Dean for
Residential Education Norm
Robinson to arrive at an "interim
arrangement" until 19N2 (when the
program has been guaranteed hous
ing), proposals by both sides have
failed to produce a method for keep
ing the idea alive until then.
"East House" proponents were
told in early March that they would
occupy 610 Mayfield next year, fol
lowing a decision by the Office of
Residential Education to oust La
Maison Francaise from the Row.
However, on March 14. Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons over
turned that decision and allowed the
French House to return for one
more probationary year, thus rob
bing the East Asian Studies Prog
ram of a residence.
Sympathetic to the disappointed
East Asian Studies Committee.
Lyons said that he and Robinson

would seek to set up an "interim
arrangement" tor the program until
1982. when it could be assured due
to the building of a new housing
complex and the rebuilding of
Storey House.
Robinson met with two students
for the East Asian Studies House
"core committee." last Friday and
presented them with a plan for next
year. The associate dean offered
juniors Craig Trammell and Wolf
Brolley the use of a cluster of trail
ers in Manzanita Park, which could
house 32 students, and the use of an
eating club. Also, one trailer would
be reserved for a library and lan
guage laboratory for the program.
As an alternative, Robinson also
offered the use of a few rooms in the
Mirrielees Apartments or the Roble
Hall basement to the two represen
tatives.
Trammell and Brolley brought
back to the "core committee" news
of Robinson's proposals, but the
group decided Sunday night that the
proposals were not adequate.
"We went back to the core group.
It wasn't a unanimous decision, but
we came to the conclusion that the

Manzanita option was not in the
best interest of the program," said
Trammell.
According to Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, a strong faculty supporter
of an East Asian Studies House,
"The trailers don't offer any sense
of community whatsoever for the
group. It would be difficult to act
out the kind of forum that the East
Asian Studies Core Committee
wanted to see in the program. There
was a feeling that the East Asian
Studies House would have a couple
of strikes against it to start with."
The four-person committee.
Trammell. Brolley, Jeff Wong and
Steve Chelberg. returned to Robin
son on Monday with proposals of
their own. According to Wong,
"Norm regarded some of them as
totally unsatisfactory and others as
possible."
The group made basically two
counterproposals to Robinson,
Wong said. The first was a request
for another house. "We feel we are
entitled to a house because the East
Asian Studies House is being
punished for the French House
being put on probation," Wong

said. However. Robinson said "no
way," Wong added.
The second request was for a por
tion of a larger dorm, for instance a
c#fridor where at least the core
committee could live. Wong men
tioned that native American stu
dents currently have a similar ar
rangement at Roble Hall.
Although Robinson said he
would consider the corridor option,
Wong said, "the prevailing attitude
seems to be that it's too late in the
draw."
Trammell said he didn't think
Robinson was really in favor of that
option because it would break a
sense of community in the dorm it
self and also rob the dorm of
freshman housing.
Robinson said yesterday that he
would be making the decision and
that it would be announced in the
next couple of days, "certainly be
fore the draw starts."
The associate dean also said," I'm
disappointed that they didn't accept

in Manzanita). I do think it would
have worked."
