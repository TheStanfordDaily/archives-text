# Board approves stock proxy votes
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
The University Board of Trustees
yesterday accepted 12 of the 14 re
commendations regarding stock proxy
votes submitted to it Monday evening
by the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CI R).
As a result, Stanford University sup
ports shareholder proposals calling on
the Bank of America and Wells Fargo
to establish a corporate policy of mak
ing no new loans or renewals to the
South African government or its agen
cies until racist laws and regulations are
revoked.
In other business, the board re
viewed preliminary plans for a $97
million modernization plan for the
Stanford Hospitals and Clinics. Al
though the trustees are not expected to
act on the plan until the fall, a special
Ad Hoc Committee on the Medical
Center met for two hours yesterday to
review a lengthy report warning that
the Hospital and Clinics possess "seri
ous physical deficiencies."
The board also approved University
investments in several venture capital

funds, the Peter C'outts Hill housing
project, the SLAC Single Pass Collider
project and a $6.7 million budget for
general plant improvements.
The CIR — an advisory group of
faculty, students, staff and alumni —
unanimously supported the recom
mendation that the board vote its pro
xies for 134,670 shares of Bank of
America stock and 15,200 shares of
Wells Fargo in favor of the shareholder
resolution.
The board accepted the recommen
dation yesterday through its Subcom
mittee on Investment Responsibility.
Exceptions to CIR recommenda
tions included a board vote to abstain
on a proposal calling for Owens-Illinois
Corp. to liquidate its assets in South
Africa; CIR had voted to support the
proposal. The trustees also voted
against a shareholder proposal that
Dupont Corp. evaluate its Savannah
River nuclear weapons plant; CIR had
called for support of the evaluation.
According to English Prof. Lan Watt,
co-chairman of the CIR, the only two
exceptions arose regarding recom
mendations over which the CIR itself

had "serious differences of opinion.
"My impression was that had we
been able to make a stronger case for
Owens-Illinois (the CIR recommenda
tion was given by a vote of 7-2) we
would have found ourselves in agree
ment with the board. As it is, "abstain
ing means not agreeing with the
shareholders," in the Owens-Illinois
question, Watt explained.
The Dupont recommendation came
as a result of a 5-4 decision by CIR.
"Many of us had great doubts regard
ing the scientific evidence involved in
that decision," Watt added.
Last year, the trustees voted con
trary to majority recommendations of
CIR on only six of 37 votes, and H4
percent approval rating.
The board also passed the motions of
the investment committee which called
for University investment in five ven
ture capital funds. These funds prov ide
an investment plan for the University
which may result in as much as a ten
fold return on initial investments,
Vice-President of Public Affairs,
Robert Rosensweig explained. They

represent "high risk, high return" in
vestments in individuals desiring to
start companies.
The approval of the Peter Coutts Hill
project will allow the University to go
ahead with plans to build 140 units of
faculty/staff housing. "The Vice Presi
dent for Business and Finance expects
to return to the Board of Trustees in
June for schematic design, final budget,
and interim financing approval." a re
port to the board states. "Construction
and delivery of first units is anticipated
for the fall of 1981," it stated.
General plant improvements ap
proved by the trustees are separated
into amortized and non-amortized pro
jects. Amortized projects include
"parallelling and looping of the chilled
water systems, condensate line re

placement, fuel conversion, and utility
to the new student housing project."
Non-amortized projects include roads,
storm severs, parking, paths, lighting
and area enhancement.
The cost of amortized projects is es
timated at $5,163,000, while non
amortized projects will cost
$1,607,000.
The board also approved plans for the
site of the proposed Single Pass Col
lidet Project which will utilize electrons
and positrons accelerated in the Stan
ford Liner Accelerator.
"The Single Pass collider is designed
. . . to make basic contributions to the
understanding of the relation between
the forces in our universe as well as to
continue the study of the structure of
the matter," a report to the trustees
stated.

and interim financing approval." a re
port to the board states. "Construction
and delivery of first units is anticipated
for the fall of 1981," it stated.
General plant improvements ap
proved by the trustees are separated
into amortized and non-amortized pro
jects. Amortized projects include
"parallelling and looping of the chilled
water systems, condensate line re

placement, fuel conversion, and utility
to the new student housing project."
Non-amortized projects include roads,
storm severs, parking, paths, lighting
and area enhancement.
The cost of amortized projects is es
timated at $5,163,000, while non
amortized projects will cost
$1,607,000.
The board also approved plans for the
site of the proposed Single Pass Col
lidet Project which will utilize electrons
and positrons accelerated in the Stan
ford Liner Accelerator.
"The Single Pass collider is designed
. . . to make basic contributions to the
understanding of the relation between
the forces in our universe as well as to
continue the study of the structure of
the matter," a report to the trustees
stated.
The University Board of Trustees
yesterday accepted 12 of the 14 re
commendations regarding stock proxy
votes submitted to it Monday evening
by the Commission on Investment Re
sponsibility (CI R).
As a result, Stanford University sup
ports shareholder proposals calling on
the Bank of America and Wells Fargo
to establish a corporate policy of mak
ing no new loans or renewals to the
South African government or its agen
cies until racist laws and regulations are
revoked.
In other business, the board re
viewed preliminary plans for a $97
million modernization plan for the
Stanford Hospitals and Clinics. Al
though the trustees are not expected to
act on the plan until the fall, a special
Ad Hoc Committee on the Medical
Center met for two hours yesterday to
review a lengthy report warning that
the Hospital and Clinics possess "seri
ous physical deficiencies."
The board also approved University
investments in several venture capital

funds, the Peter C'outts Hill housing
project, the SLAC Single Pass Collider
project and a $6.7 million budget for
general plant improvements.
The CIR — an advisory group of
faculty, students, staff and alumni —
unanimously supported the recom
mendation that the board vote its pro
xies for 134,670 shares of Bank of
America stock and 15,200 shares of
Wells Fargo in favor of the shareholder
resolution.
The board accepted the recommen
dation yesterday through its Subcom
mittee on Investment Responsibility.
Exceptions to CIR recommenda
tions included a board vote to abstain
on a proposal calling for Owens-Illinois
Corp. to liquidate its assets in South
Africa; CIR had voted to support the
proposal. The trustees also voted
against a shareholder proposal that
Dupont Corp. evaluate its Savannah
River nuclear weapons plant; CIR had
called for support of the evaluation.
According to English Prof. Lan Watt,
co-chairman of the CIR, the only two
exceptions arose regarding recom
mendations over which the CIR itself

had "serious differences of opinion.
"My impression was that had we
been able to make a stronger case for
Owens-Illinois (the CIR recommenda
tion was given by a vote of 7-2) we
would have found ourselves in agree
ment with the board. As it is, "abstain
ing means not agreeing with the
shareholders," in the Owens-Illinois
question, Watt explained.
The Dupont recommendation came
as a result of a 5-4 decision by CIR.
"Many of us had great doubts regard
ing the scientific evidence involved in
that decision," Watt added.
Last year, the trustees voted con
trary to majority recommendations of
CIR on only six of 37 votes, and H4
percent approval rating.
The board also passed the motions of
the investment committee which called
for University investment in five ven
ture capital funds. These funds prov ide
an investment plan for the University
which may result in as much as a ten
fold return on initial investments,

Robert Rosensweig explained. They

The approval of the Peter Coutts Hill
project will allow the University to go
ahead with plans to build 140 units of
