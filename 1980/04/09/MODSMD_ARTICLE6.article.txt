# Phi Psi gains recognition; rush kicks off
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
After two months of negotiations. Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity was officially recognized here yesterday.
According to Phi Psi President Bill Shirley, the Phi
Psi national organization, unlike the sororities seek
ing University recognition, was willing to "waive
points in its national constitution which the Univer
sity didn't care for."
Meanwhile, fourteen fraternities and seven
sororities, in completely separate efforts, begin their
annual spring rush this week.
Frat activities kicked off Monday night with the
first open houses and continue until the last hid party
May 3. According to IPC President John Kinney,
"The bids will actually be issued after midnight April
29."
Sororities will start their third annual rush with a
special orientation session for prospective rushees on
Friday and issue bids April 23.
Sororities concentrate their activities on the
weekends while frat open houses are during the
week.
According to Kinney, although frats serve liquor,
"they are encouraged to keep down the parties" dur
ing the open houses Monday through Thursday.
Sorority rush counselor Lori Landa said national
sororities prohibit the use of alcohol in the women's
rush.
Frat open houses are this week from 7:30 to 10:30
p.m., next week from 3:30 to 8:30 p.m., and the last
week from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m.

According to Kinney, the early evening rush is
completely new this year. "We thought it would let
people see things in a different light." He added that
it "takes some of the pressure off the cycle of parties
four nights a week."
Both sororities and fraternities have rush books
explaining procedures and including times of parties,
phone numbers, photos and statements from each
group. Books are distributed through the residences.
According to rush counselor Sharon Ullman, addi
tional sorority rush books will be distributed in White
Plaza around noon during rush.
Because the University has denied recognition to
all sororities, they may not use campus facilities this
year. Thus, for the first time, sororities must rush off
campus but supply transportation for rushees. Stu
dents will meet at Wilbur parking lot to be picked up
and returned.
Sorority open houses will be held at Menlo School.
According to Landa, the invitation-only meetings
will take place at Castilleja School in Palo Alto.
Ullman said, "We're not going to get the girls who
just stopped by before. It takes a little more commit
ment."
She added that meetings off campus make sorority
rush seem "even less a part of the University."
Frat rushes, planned geographically, are more ac
cessible than sorority activities.
According to rush counselor Kathy Davies, each
sorority spends about $400 in organized rush. This
includes, for example, refreshments, decorations and
skit equipment.

Sororities emphasize that "no other rush may take
place during formal rush.'' The rush books also state
that "rushees cannot take away any favor from any
party."
Sororities also require registration for rush. Iliis
helpsin planning off campus transportation. Accord
ing to Davies, registration will take place through
Sunday. The one dollar fee covers transportation
cost.
According to IFC rush chairman Jim Isaacs, "there
is no IFC attempt to regulate spending."
Kinney said the rush budget "is up to each indi
vidual house." He said most fraternities have a flat
social fee each quarter, set by the social chairman.
"Anyone that pledged last year is assessed an extra
fee (during spring quarter) in most frats," he said.
According to Nancy Hoffman, president of the
Inter-Sorority Council, approximately 325 women
are currently involved in sororities.
Last spring about 200 women were in formal rush.
About 225 are expected to rush this year, said
Hoffman.
According to Kinney, about 500 men will attend
their open house last night.
Stanford's seven sororities are Alpha Omicron Pi,
Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi. Delta Gamma, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
The frats are Alpha Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Theta
Delta Chi, Theta Xi and Zeta Psi.

Sorority open houses will be held at Menlo School.
According to Landa, the invitation-only meetings
will take place at Castilleja School in Palo Alto.
Ullman said, "We're not going to get the girls who
just stopped by before. It takes a little more commit
ment."
She added that meetings off campus make sorority
rush seem "even less a part of the University."
Frat rushes, planned geographically, are more ac
cessible than sorority activities.
According to rush counselor Kathy Davies, each
sorority spends about $400 in organized rush. This
includes, for example, refreshments, decorations and
skit equipment.

Sororities emphasize that "no other rush may take
place during formal rush.'' The rush books also state
that "rushees cannot take away any favor from any
party."
Sororities also require registration for rush. Iliis
helpsin planning off campus transportation. Accord
ing to Davies, registration will take place through
Sunday. The one dollar fee covers transportation
cost.
According to IFC rush chairman Jim Isaacs, "there
is no IFC attempt to regulate spending."
Kinney said the rush budget "is up to each indi
vidual house." He said most fraternities have a flat
social fee each quarter, set by the social chairman.
"Anyone that pledged last year is assessed an extra
fee (during spring quarter) in most frats," he said.
According to Nancy Hoffman, president of the
Inter-Sorority Council, approximately 325 women
are currently involved in sororities.
Last spring about 200 women were in formal rush.
About 225 are expected to rush this year, said
Hoffman.
According to Kinney, about 500 men will attend
their open house last night.
Stanford's seven sororities are Alpha Omicron Pi,
Alpha Chi Omega, Alpha Phi. Delta Gamma, Kappa
Alpha Theta, Kappa Kappa Gamma and Pi Beta Phi.
The frats are Alpha Delta Phi, Beta Theta Pi, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Delta Tau Delta, Delta Upsilon,
Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, Phi Delta Theta, Phi
Kappa Psi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Sigma Chi, Theta
Delta Chi, Theta Xi and Zeta Psi.
After two months of negotiations. Phi Kappa Psi
fraternity was officially recognized here yesterday.
According to Phi Psi President Bill Shirley, the Phi
Psi national organization, unlike the sororities seek
ing University recognition, was willing to "waive
points in its national constitution which the Univer
sity didn't care for."
Meanwhile, fourteen fraternities and seven
sororities, in completely separate efforts, begin their
annual spring rush this week.
Frat activities kicked off Monday night with the
first open houses and continue until the last hid party
May 3. According to IPC President John Kinney,
"The bids will actually be issued after midnight April
29."
Sororities will start their third annual rush with a
special orientation session for prospective rushees on
Friday and issue bids April 23.
Sororities concentrate their activities on the
weekends while frat open houses are during the
week.
According to Kinney, although frats serve liquor,
"they are encouraged to keep down the parties" dur
ing the open houses Monday through Thursday.
Sorority rush counselor Lori Landa said national
sororities prohibit the use of alcohol in the women's
rush.
Frat open houses are this week from 7:30 to 10:30
p.m., next week from 3:30 to 8:30 p.m., and the last
week from 7:30 to 10:30 p.m.

According to Kinney, the early evening rush is
completely new this year. "We thought it would let
people see things in a different light." He added that
it "takes some of the pressure off the cycle of parties
four nights a week."
Both sororities and fraternities have rush books
explaining procedures and including times of parties,
phone numbers, photos and statements from each
group. Books are distributed through the residences.
According to rush counselor Sharon Ullman, addi
tional sorority rush books will be distributed in White
Plaza around noon during rush.
Because the University has denied recognition to
all sororities, they may not use campus facilities this
year. Thus, for the first time, sororities must rush off
campus but supply transportation for rushees. Stu
dents will meet at Wilbur parking lot to be picked up
and returned.
Sorority open houses will be held at Menlo School.
According to Landa, the invitation-only meetings
will take place at Castilleja School in Palo Alto.
