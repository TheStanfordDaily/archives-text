# U.S. severs relations with Iran
## Japan fears economic trouble 
### William Chapman The Washington Post 
TOKYO — The U.S. decision
to sever relations with Iran
evoked a sympathetic response
from Japanese officials yester
day. but it also revived fears of
economic troubles and possible
danger to Japan's oil supplies.
Foreign Minister Saburo
Okita saici Japan "understands"
the circumstances of President
Jimmy Carter's latest steps to
pressure Iran for the release of
American hostages, whose im
prisonment he called "an out

right violation of international
law."
It is "regrettable that it came
to this situation" after months of
"self-restraint" by the United
States and the assistance of a Un
ited Nations commission that
tried to negotiate the hostages'
release, he said.
The major concern in Tokyo,
however, was that the revival of
American economic pressures
on Iran might entangle Japan
again in the issue of sanctions
against a country that provides
this country with 10 percent of its
oil. "I think there will be some

hard times," said one govern
ment official.
It could also revive pressure to
discontinue work on a huge pet
rochemical plant being built in
Iran with Japanese industrial and
government assistance.
There was no public hint yes
terday what the United States
would ask Japan to do to support
Carter's request for help from
friendly countries. Ambassador
Mike Mansfield yesterday after
noon explained Carter's message
in a .conference with Vice
Foreign Minister Masuo
Takashima. Officials said later
Mansfield sought Japan's gen
eral cooperation but gave no de
tails.
According to Foreign Ministry
sources, Takashima promised
"general support."
Japan fears that if it joined in
specific pressure on Iran, that
country would act quickly to cut
off its oil supplies. In an agree
ment worked out last fall. Japan
this year will buy about 530,000
barrels a day from Iran. 10 per
cent of its total imports.
The other major issue is Ja
pan's support of a huge pet
rochemical plant being built at
Bandar Khomeini, in southern
Iran. Nearly complete but stalled
for months by revolution and
politics, it is a project that Iran
has made a test of Japan's sup
port.
Iran recently insisted that con
struction resume immediately
and even laid down the rule that
at least 300 workers be sent to
the site. It has accused the
Japanese companies of foot
dragging because of American
pressures and warned that East
ern European aid would be
sought to finish the plant if the
Japanese assistance did not come

through.
Seventy Japanese workers are
at Bandar Khomeini now, and 20
more are on the way. Another
210 are to go in May to comply
with the Iranian ultimatum. To
finish construction the Japanese
government and private com
panies have pledged about $2.7
billion.
When it was pushing for inter
national sanctions earlier this
year, the United States sought to
have the Japanese companies
put off restarting construction on
the plant. An official of Mitsui
and Co., the principal Japanese
partner, said yesterday he ex
pects the United States to revert
to that tough position under Car
ter's new moves.
Mitsui's president. Toshikuni
Yahiro, claimed that the Ameri
can side had, at the Japanese
government's request, excluded
the plant from the earlier sanc
tions. U.S. officials said the orig
inal understanding was that only
maintenance — not construction
— would be done. The question
was left in abeyance after the Un
ited States decided not to impose
sanctions then.
Prime Minister Masayoshi
Ohira told reporters that Japan
had attempted through contacts
with "third countries" to obtain
the hostages' release. He did not
elaborate, but Japanese officials
said he was referring to direct
contacts in Iran and in other Is
lamic countries.
Carter's new statement pro
duced an ironic side-effect — the
dollar went up sharply against
the Japanese yen on the Tokyo
foreign exchange. The explana
tion of currency traders was that
the yen's future looked dark be
cause Japan's oil supplies are
again threatened.

Seventy Japanese workers are
at Bandar Khomeini now, and 20
more are on the way. Another
210 are to go in May to comply
with the Iranian ultimatum. To
finish construction the Japanese
government and private com
panies have pledged about $2.7
billion.
When it was pushing for inter
national sanctions earlier this
year, the United States sought to
have the Japanese companies
put off restarting construction on
the plant. An official of Mitsui
and Co., the principal Japanese
partner, said yesterday he ex
pects the United States to revert
to that tough position under Car
ter's new moves.
Mitsui's president. Toshikuni
Yahiro, claimed that the Ameri
can side had, at the Japanese
government's request, excluded
the plant from the earlier sanc
tions. U.S. officials said the orig
inal understanding was that only
maintenance — not construction
— would be done. The question
was left in abeyance after the Un
ited States decided not to impose
sanctions then.
Prime Minister Masayoshi
Ohira told reporters that Japan
had attempted through contacts
with "third countries" to obtain
the hostages' release. He did not
elaborate, but Japanese officials
said he was referring to direct
contacts in Iran and in other Is
lamic countries.
Carter's new statement pro
duced an ironic side-effect — the
dollar went up sharply against
the Japanese yen on the Tokyo
foreign exchange. The explana
tion of currency traders was that
the yen's future looked dark be
cause Japan's oil supplies are
again threatened.
TOKYO — The U.S. decision
to sever relations with Iran
evoked a sympathetic response
from Japanese officials yester
day. but it also revived fears of
economic troubles and possible
danger to Japan's oil supplies.
Foreign Minister Saburo
Okita saici Japan "understands"
the circumstances of President
Jimmy Carter's latest steps to
pressure Iran for the release of
American hostages, whose im
prisonment he called "an out

right violation of international
law."
It is "regrettable that it came
to this situation" after months of
"self-restraint" by the United
States and the assistance of a Un
ited Nations commission that
tried to negotiate the hostages'
release, he said.
The major concern in Tokyo,
however, was that the revival of
American economic pressures
on Iran might entangle Japan
again in the issue of sanctions
against a country that provides
this country with 10 percent of its
oil. "I think there will be some

hard times," said one govern
ment official.
It could also revive pressure to
discontinue work on a huge pet
rochemical plant being built in
Iran with Japanese industrial and
government assistance.
There was no public hint yes
terday what the United States
would ask Japan to do to support
Carter's request for help from
friendly countries. Ambassador
Mike Mansfield yesterday after
noon explained Carter's message
in a .conference with Vice
Foreign Minister Masuo
Takashima. Officials said later
Mansfield sought Japan's gen
eral cooperation but gave no de
tails.
According to Foreign Ministry
sources, Takashima promised
"general support."
Japan fears that if it joined in
specific pressure on Iran, that
country would act quickly to cut
off its oil supplies. In an agree
ment worked out last fall. Japan
this year will buy about 530,000
barrels a day from Iran. 10 per
cent of its total imports.
The other major issue is Ja
pan's support of a huge pet
rochemical plant being built at
Bandar Khomeini, in southern
Iran. Nearly complete but stalled
for months by revolution and
politics, it is a project that Iran
has made a test of Japan's sup
port.
Iran recently insisted that con
struction resume immediately
and even laid down the rule that
at least 300 workers be sent to
the site. It has accused the
Japanese companies of foot
dragging because of American
pressures and warned that East
ern European aid would be
sought to finish the plant if the
Japanese assistance did not come

through.
Seventy Japanese workers are
at Bandar Khomeini now, and 20
more are on the way. Another
210 are to go in May to comply
with the Iranian ultimatum. To
finish construction the Japanese
government and private com
panies have pledged about $2.7
