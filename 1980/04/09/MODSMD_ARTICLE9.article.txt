LIMA. Peru — The Peruvian
government turned to its
Latin-American allies in the
Andean Pact for help in finding
asylum tor the estimated 1 ().()()()
Cubans jamming its embassy in
Havana in a desperate attempt to
escape communist rule.
The United States said it
would take some of them if the
Peruvian government would let
the refugees come to Lima. But
so far the Peruvians were admit
ting none of them because they
had no definite assurances from
other countries that they would
take them.
"Peru cannot take charge of
1 (),()()() refugees, no country can
do that individually." Foreign
Minister Arturo Garcia said.
Garcia and the foreign minis
ters of the other four Andean
Pact nations — Bolivia, Colom
bia, Ecuador and Venezuela —
scheduled an emergency meet
ing in the Peruvian capital today
to review the situation and dis
cuss what might be done.
In Miami's Little Havana,
thousands of Cuban-Americans
marched in support of their
compatriots. Leaders called tor a
revolution to overthrow Presi
dent Fidel Castro and led chants
of "War! War!"
"How can we admit 150,000
Hungarian freedom fighters and
150,000 Vietnamese and Cam
bodians and not admit the
10,000 Cubans?" asked Miami
Mayor Maurice Ferre, a native of
Puerto Rico. "Either we admit

them or we take down the Statue
of Liberty."
Sen. Richard Stone (D-Fla.)
told several thousand Cuban
exiles in Tampa: "The 10.000
will live. The 10,000 will be able
to leave."
The State Department said it
would consider applications for
admission to the United States
from those Cubans who could
reach the Peruvian capital.
Havana radio described the
throng that descended on the
Peruvian Embassy last weekend
as "vagrants and bums" and said
they were welcome to leave the
country.
"If the government of Peru
wishes to receive in their country
all the anti-socials and bums, we
will be glad to authorize them to
leave our country and also those
who are ideologically in disag
reement with the revolution and
socialism." said the broadcast.
Peru's foreign minister said
the five members of the embassy
staff were not able to cope with
the crowd jamming the suburban
estate and asked the Interna
tional Red Cross to provide
food.
The crowd poured into the
20-acre embassy compound
after the Cuban police guard was
withdrawn because a policeman
was killed when six Cubans seek
ing asylum crashed a bus into the
compound gate. Eighteen other
Cubans had been inside the em
bassy since Jan. 1 trying to leave
the country, and 16 Cubans have
been at the Venezuelan Embassy
for months.
