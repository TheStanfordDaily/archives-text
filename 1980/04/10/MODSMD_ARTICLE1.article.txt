### Andrea James News Editor 
A 76-year-old Palo Alto woman died last night when a
fire broke out in her hospital room in Hoover Pavilion,
the old annex of the University Hospital.
Edna Hansen of 180 Hamilton Ave., died in the 10
p.m. blaze which fire officials said was caused by the
woman smoking in bed.
There was no structural damage to the third-floor
room, said Bob Cleveland, Palo Alto fire inspector.
Most of the damage was confined to the bed and mat
tress, though walls were blackened by the dense smoke.
Eight units from the Palo Alto Fire Department re
sponded to the blaze which was discovered by a nurse
who noticed smoke in the third floor hallway.

Bruce Halperin, a resident on duty, supervised the
evacuation of 20 patients from nearby rooms. He said it
took about four minutes tor the staff to move the pa
tients to clear safety on the second floor.
None of those patients suffered complications due to
the evacuation, hospital spokesmen said last night.
It was not clear whether the cause of Hansen's death
was the fire itself or health complications resulting from
the trauma.
The hospital's smoking policy, as stated in an informa
tion booklet for patients, is: "Patients who are confined
to bed and who wish to smoke must have the permission
of a responsible physician and a responsible adult must
be in attendance."
