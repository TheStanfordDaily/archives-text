### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
America's current policy towards Vietnam
is "a political assault to discredit the govern
ment and to exacerbate efforts to rebuild."
said Lucy Forest, one of five American
women to visit Vietnam and Kampuchea in
January.
Forest, of the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, spoke to 50
people on "Vietnam Kampuchea: Rebuild
ing Under Siege." at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center on Tuesday. Her five-member
delegation had been invited by the Vietnam
Women's Union to tour the two countries.
Forest urged the United States to try to
normalize relations with Vietnam, which
were ended in 1978 in response to Viet
namese troops in Kampuchea, she said.
"The U.S. has never owned up to its re
sponsibility to help Southeast Asia rebuild. It
has blocked aid from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund and has insti
tuted a trade embargo," she said. These ac
tions worsen instability and increase the out
pouring of refugees, she said.
A consortium of 32 voluntary organiza
tions is successfully getting aid into Kam
puchea by rail, truck convoys and oxcarts,
according to Forest. "People are no longer
starving, but they are suffering from malnut
rition and mental illness." She cited Oxfam
as a group which is providing means for re
construction. including setting up a textile
plant and irrigation pumps.
"Kampuchea is a nation of widows and
children." she said, recalling one village

which included 300 children and one mother.
"1 would like to see the U.N. withdraw its
recognition of (former Premier) Pol Pot."
who is still leading Khmer Rouge forces
against the current Vietnam-backed gov -
ernment. Forest added.
Forest said a man who had once shared a
prison cell with Pot told her Pot sent masses
from the famished cities to the country to
work on farms, where one million died, and
two million were killed for rebelliousness.
According to Vietnamese Foreign Minis
ter Nguyen Co Thac. whom the delegation
interviewed. Pot had attacked Vietnam's
borders and had refused to negotiate, before
Vietnam sent troops to oust him. said Forest.
She said Vietnam would not withdraw until
China withdraws its threat to Vietnam and
Kampuchea.
War possible
She warned that "the U.S. government
would like to install a government in Kam
puchea which is acceptable to both the U.S.
and China. They may be willing to go to war
to achieve this."
The first five-year plan to rebuild Vietnam
did not achieve its objective, she said. Two
years of disastrous floods hindered the ag
ricultural improvement necessary for indus
trialization to begin. Also, the U.S. with
drawal left a big hole in the economy, whose
GNP was S2-3 billion, of which SI billion
had been poured in by America yearly.
Vietnam is moving away from forced col
lectivization. and is moving toward an incen
tive system, she said. "There is 'capitalist"

production, but they do it through joint
\ enture plans with other socialist nations and
Japan." she said.
Trade cut off
In socializing its economy. Vietnam cut off
speculative foreign trade, which was a main
livelihood oft he ethnic Chinese. Lacking full
citizenship and exempted from the military
as well, they began fleeing the country.
"This was a problem for the Vietnamese as
well, diminishing the number of doctors, and
hurting factories and the fishing industrv,"
she said. Furthermore, the Chinese invasion
was costly, doubling military expenditures,
she said.
In Ho Chi Minh Citv. the delegation at
tended a meeting of the Women's Union, of
which 50 percent of Vietnam's women are
members. "1 met doctors, lawyers and scien
tists who were stumbling without leadership
and needed technical help." said P-'orest.
She said she also visited rehabilitation cen
ters for prostitutes and drug addicts, and a
re-education camp for young offenders, cal
ling them "a milestone in efforts to deal with
followers of an old regime." She mentioned
that the Amnesty International report on
Vietnam for 1 c >77-78 "showed no evidence
of any torture."
The delegation met also with Madame
Binh. minister of education and the only
woman on the council of ministers. Accord
ing to Binh. 70 percent of women are being
educated, and 60 to 70 percent of medical
students are female. "Peasants have much
more access to education than they had be
fore." said Fdrest.
