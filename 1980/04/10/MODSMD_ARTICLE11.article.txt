MOSCOW â€” 'ITie Soviet dis
sident movement is going
through difficult times these
days, with arrests and other ac
tion by authorities leaving it
without a spokesman popular in
the West for the first time.
Increased pressure on opposi
tion groups since November has
still not threatened the existence
of the movement, but observers
now predict less open action by
protesters against the Soviet way
of life.
The internal exile in January
of academician Andrei
Sakharov, an important source
of information and a moral
leader and adviser to many dissi
dents, was the final act to remove
major opposition figures from

the scene.
There was also the departure
into exile abroad of such well
known names as Alexander Sol
zhenitsyn. Vladimir Maximov,
Vladimir Bukovski and Arina
Ginzburg, founder of the Aid
Fund tor Political Prisoners.
And Ginzburg's colleague
Malva Landa was sentenced to
five years' house arrest in March.
Landa's punishment and the ar
rest last December of writer Vik
tor Nekipelov enabled au
thorities to virtually paralyze the
Moscow group monitoring the
application of the Helsinki ag
reements, of which both were
members. In Armenia and the
Ukraine the state security ser
vice (KGB) crushed similar
groups six months ago.

Since then other groups of dis
sidents have suffered from
searches and arrests, with the
Committee for the Defense of
the Faithful one of the hardest
hit. losing four of its leading ac
tivists: priests Dmijtri Dudko
and Gleh Yakunin, Lev Regel
son and Viktor Kapitanchuk.
However. Moscow dissidents
continue to affirm that while
even less publicized figures have
now been caught up in the police
net, many others would still pur
sue their activities, although with
increased prudence and discre
tion.
Since the crackdown on
ideological deviation, several
dissidents have begun to ques
tion the policy of open action and
signed protest letters.
Most dissidents sav leading fi

gures acting openly and speaking
for the different tendencies in
the opposition are necessary.
They think that clandestinity
means self-censorship, the risk
of losing one's audience and
even the temptation to take part
in violent protest.
On the eve of the Olympic
Games in Moscow, Soviet dissi
dents are not optimistic, fearing
a new crackdown once the
athletes have departed this
summer. An Aid Fund for Politi
cal Prisoners spokesman said:
"The Soviet Union had nothing
to lose against international pub
lic opinion after the intervention
in Afghanistan, the Olympic
Games will take place anyway,
justifying the Kremlin's policy,
and the authorities will not relax
their pressure."
