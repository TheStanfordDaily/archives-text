# Asians shed uncertain role in Africa
## 
### David Lamb The Los Angeles Times 
NAIROBI. Kenya — For
more than a century, the Asians
in Africa have lived in a b\y.ilight
zone of uncertainty. Half
citizen. half-refugee, they have
not quite belonged anywhere.
They came as traders and
sailors, then became indentured
servants, and finally, entrep
reneurs and professionals. The
European colonists treated them
with contempt, the Africans with
suspicion and disdain.
The Asians — here the term is
used in connection with all
brown-skinned people, usually
Indians and Pakistanis — were a
conspicuous, vulnerable minor
ity. economically powerful, so
cially isolated, politically reti
cent. Black Africans came to
refer to them as "the Asian
problem."
Uganda, after it became inde
pendent, solved its problem by
expelling the entire community
of 70,01)0 Asians, even though a
third of them were Ugandan citi
zens. Malawi canceled Asians'
licenses to grow tobacco.
Tanzania nationalized their
businesses and sisal plantations.
Kenya took away their shops by
the thousands and forbade them
to do business in rural areas.
South Africa officially made
them second-class citizens.
As recently as 1972, Daniel
Arap Moi. now Kenya's presi

dent, stood in Parliament to de
nounce the Asians who were
seeking refuge here after their
expulsion from Uganda.
"Kenya," he said, "is not a
dumping ground for people from
other countries to come and loi
ter about."
The then Kenyan assistant
minister for home affairs, Martin
Shikuku, put it more bluntly:
"The Asians should go."
No future?
What seemed clear in those
days was that the Asian had no
future in Africa. He was an alien
in a land he had helped to build
and he lived with his bags
packed, his money banked ab
road, his destiny squarely in the
hands of the new black au
thorities.
But the Asians' fears were not
realized, and the worst of the
storm clouds have passed.
Asians are still discriminated
against, far more than whites or
any other minority in black Af
rica. but now they have good
prospects for what appears to be
a secure future.
"I'm convinced there never
could be a repeat of Uganda, al
though I wouldn't have told you
that a few years ago," Abdul
Hamid said in a recent interview.
Hamid, 40, is a Sunni Muslim
and one of the 200,000 members
of Kenya's Asian community,
the largest and most influential
in black Africa.
Ties to Africa
"Our family has been here
more than 100 years," he said.
Kids of my son's generation can't
identify with India at all any
more. The only ties we have are
to Kenya."
When I moved to Nairobi
from Mombasa eight years ago, I
came with nothing." he said.
"For two years, I lived on
bananas and a pint of milk a day.
But I wasn't afraid to work, and I
wanted to make money for my
children."

Underscoring the cautious op
timism that Hamid and many
others express are numerous in
dicators of the changes that have
taken place. For example:
— According to banking
sources, Asians are bringing
back the money kept illegally in
foreign accounts and investing it
heavily here.
— Last November, an Asian was
elected to the Kenyan Parlia
ment, for only the second time
since independence in 1963.
— In 1976, the Hindu prime
minister of Mauritius, Sir
Seewoosagur Rangoolam, be
came the first non-black to be
elected chairman of the Organi
zation of African Unity.
— The new government of
Uganda has invited the Asian
citizens who were expelled eight
years ago to come home. In
ceremonies recently in Lugazi,
80 miles from Kampala, the
once-banished Mehta Group
was welcomed back to reclaim its
huge sugar cane fields and pro
cessing plant.
Perhaps most significant, the
presence of Asians has simply
and quietly ceased to be an issue
in Africa. Two likely reasons: the
indigenous African feels less
threatened today than he did a
decade ago, and national
economies have suffered — in
Uganda it collapsed — when
Asian participation was elimi
nated.
In the colonial era, the Asian
in East Africa was the man in the
middle, as are the 700,000
Asians in South Africa today. He
was caught between white and
black, with neither the privileges
of the former nor the burdens of
the latter.
He lived in special Asian resi
dential zones and was not al
lowed to send his children to
European or African schools. In
the mid-19505, the colonial ad
ministration in Kenya spent an
average of $180 a year for the

education of each white child,
$65 for each Asian and $5 per
black African. In the Ugandan
public service, according to gov
ernment records, the Asian
earned six times more than the
African and about a third less
than the European.
"People forget what this place
was like 25 or 30 years ago,"
John Karmali. 62. chairman of
the Nairobi Rotary Club and a
graduate of the University of
London, said.
"When 1 came back from
London in I 946 with an English
wife, it was one of the first mixed
marriages Kenya had ever seen.
There were only a few places
where 1 could huv land, and no
hotel in Nairobi or upcountry
would serve you a meal or a
drink."
Karmali was one of the first
agitators for Asian rights. In
1950, he and his wife Joan
founded the first multiracial
school in Kenya, and in 1958 he
became the first Asian member
of the all-white Rotary Club. He
had been blackballed twice, and
his acceptance prompted two
members to resign in protest.
But his election as chairman this
year produced not a ripple of
protest.
"1 wouldn't deny that substan
tial discrimination still exists
against the Asian." he said.
"There are a number of reasons.
One, the element of jealousy —
the Asian community as a whole
is rich. Two, the Asians tend to
keep within themselves, some
thing 1 fault the Asians for. And
three, the Asians and Africans
are strangers to each other's way
of life.
"The African is in the position
of strength now, and he is using
that position to pay back some
old scores. That's human
enough. 1 can appreciate the fact
that he was downtrodden, and if
he's trodding down a bit himself
now. that's hardly unusual."

Uganda it collapsed — when
Asian participation was elimi
nated.
In the colonial era, the Asian
in East Africa was the man in the
middle, as are the 700,000
Asians in South Africa today. He
was caught between white and
black, with neither the privileges
of the former nor the burdens of
the latter.
He lived in special Asian resi
dential zones and was not al
lowed to send his children to
European or African schools. In
the mid-19505, the colonial ad
ministration in Kenya spent an
average of $180 a year for the

education of each white child,
$65 for each Asian and $5 per
black African. In the Ugandan
public service, according to gov
ernment records, the Asian
earned six times more than the
African and about a third less
than the European.
"People forget what this place
was like 25 or 30 years ago,"
John Karmali. 62. chairman of
the Nairobi Rotary Club and a
graduate of the University of
London, said.
"When 1 came back from
London in I 946 with an English
wife, it was one of the first mixed
marriages Kenya had ever seen.
There were only a few places
where 1 could huv land, and no
hotel in Nairobi or upcountry
would serve you a meal or a
drink."
Karmali was one of the first
agitators for Asian rights. In
1950, he and his wife Joan
founded the first multiracial
school in Kenya, and in 1958 he
became the first Asian member
of the all-white Rotary Club. He
had been blackballed twice, and
his acceptance prompted two
members to resign in protest.
But his election as chairman this
year produced not a ripple of
protest.
"1 wouldn't deny that substan
tial discrimination still exists
against the Asian." he said.
"There are a number of reasons.
One, the element of jealousy —
the Asian community as a whole
is rich. Two, the Asians tend to
keep within themselves, some
thing 1 fault the Asians for. And
three, the Asians and Africans
are strangers to each other's way
of life.
"The African is in the position
of strength now, and he is using
that position to pay back some
old scores. That's human
enough. 1 can appreciate the fact
that he was downtrodden, and if
he's trodding down a bit himself
now. that's hardly unusual."
NAIROBI. Kenya — For
more than a century, the Asians
in Africa have lived in a b\y.ilight
zone of uncertainty. Half
citizen. half-refugee, they have
not quite belonged anywhere.
They came as traders and
sailors, then became indentured
servants, and finally, entrep
reneurs and professionals. The
European colonists treated them
with contempt, the Africans with
suspicion and disdain.
The Asians — here the term is
used in connection with all
brown-skinned people, usually
Indians and Pakistanis — were a
conspicuous, vulnerable minor
ity. economically powerful, so
cially isolated, politically reti
cent. Black Africans came to
refer to them as "the Asian
problem."
Uganda, after it became inde
pendent, solved its problem by
expelling the entire community
of 70,01)0 Asians, even though a
third of them were Ugandan citi
zens. Malawi canceled Asians'
licenses to grow tobacco.
Tanzania nationalized their
businesses and sisal plantations.
Kenya took away their shops by
the thousands and forbade them
to do business in rural areas.
South Africa officially made
them second-class citizens.
As recently as 1972, Daniel
Arap Moi. now Kenya's presi

dent, stood in Parliament to de
nounce the Asians who were
seeking refuge here after their
expulsion from Uganda.
"Kenya," he said, "is not a
dumping ground for people from
other countries to come and loi
ter about."
The then Kenyan assistant
minister for home affairs, Martin
Shikuku, put it more bluntly:
"The Asians should go."
No future?
What seemed clear in those
days was that the Asian had no
future in Africa. He was an alien
in a land he had helped to build
and he lived with his bags
packed, his money banked ab
road, his destiny squarely in the
hands of the new black au
thorities.
But the Asians' fears were not
realized, and the worst of the
storm clouds have passed.
Asians are still discriminated
against, far more than whites or
any other minority in black Af
rica. but now they have good
prospects for what appears to be
a secure future.
"I'm convinced there never
could be a repeat of Uganda, al
though I wouldn't have told you
that a few years ago," Abdul
Hamid said in a recent interview.
Hamid, 40, is a Sunni Muslim
and one of the 200,000 members
of Kenya's Asian community,
the largest and most influential
in black Africa.
Ties to Africa
"Our family has been here
more than 100 years," he said.
Kids of my son's generation can't
identify with India at all any
more. The only ties we have are
to Kenya."
When I moved to Nairobi
from Mombasa eight years ago, I
came with nothing." he said.
"For two years, I lived on
bananas and a pint of milk a day.
But I wasn't afraid to work, and I
wanted to make money for my
children."

Underscoring the cautious op
timism that Hamid and many
others express are numerous in
dicators of the changes that have
taken place. For example:
— According to banking
sources, Asians are bringing
back the money kept illegally in
foreign accounts and investing it
heavily here.
— Last November, an Asian was
elected to the Kenyan Parlia
ment, for only the second time
since independence in 1963.
— In 1976, the Hindu prime
minister of Mauritius, Sir
Seewoosagur Rangoolam, be
came the first non-black to be
elected chairman of the Organi
zation of African Unity.
— The new government of
Uganda has invited the Asian
citizens who were expelled eight
years ago to come home. In
ceremonies recently in Lugazi,
80 miles from Kampala, the
once-banished Mehta Group
was welcomed back to reclaim its
huge sugar cane fields and pro
cessing plant.
Perhaps most significant, the
presence of Asians has simply
and quietly ceased to be an issue
in Africa. Two likely reasons: the
indigenous African feels less
threatened today than he did a
decade ago, and national
economies have suffered — in
Uganda it collapsed — when
Asian participation was elimi
nated.
