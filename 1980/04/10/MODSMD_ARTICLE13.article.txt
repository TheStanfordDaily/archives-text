# Palestinians bitter over Camp David
## Attack reflects alienation 
### Edward Cody The Washington Post 
BEIRUT — The terror raid on an Israeli com
mune Monday provided a bloody and timely re
minder of the Palestinian guerrilla organizations
shunted aside by American, Israeli and Egyptian
leaders in the Camp David autonomy talks.
The attack was carried out to coincide with Pres
ident Anwar Sadat's trip to Washington forconsul
tations with President Carter on ways to rev ive the
faltering negotiations, and dramatically underlined
the contention of most Palestinians here that the
talks are an attempt to impose an Egyptian sellout
on them.
The Palestinian group that claimed responsibil
ity for the operation, the Arab Liberation Front, is
an Iraqi-sponsored extremist commando organiza
tion far to the left of the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization led by Yasser Arafat. Although its tac
tics are condemned, the group's message reflects a
feeling shared widely among Palestinian leaders
here that the Camp David negotiations represent
an attempt to short-circuit their claim to the loyal
ties of a majority of the three million Palestinians in
and outside the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
Arafat flexible
Arafat generally is considered the most flexible
of the top Palestinian leaders. But he has consis
tently maintained that the PLO must be recognized
in some form as the legitimate Palestinian leader
ship before it can participate in any negotiations on
the West Bank or other Palestinian issues.
The autonomy negotiations, however, have pro
ceeded so far on the assumption that Israeli, Egyp
tian and U.S. negotiators can arrange a West Bank
and Gaza autonomy deal so attractive that Palesti
nians there will not be able to resist cooperating
with it — or that Arafat will have to tacitly encour
age them to do so even if the PLO is excluded.
With this in mind, the talksset upat Camp David
have concentrated exclusively on the West Bank
and Gaza. About 1.2 million Palestinians live there
under Israeli military occupation. But another ap
proximately two million live scattered about the
Arab world, many in refugee camps runs by PLO
groups.

Although Arafat has never said so explicitly and
publicly, he is generally considered willing to ac
cept the West Bank and Gaza as the territory of a
Palestinian state, perhaps accepting as well restric
tions on such normal perogatives of a state as ar
mament and alliances with foreign powers.
But in the meantime, Sadat's willingness to bar
gain with Israel on the basis of the Camp David
accords is regarded here as treachery, because it
disregards — or at best postpones — consideration
of the guerrilla group's two most fundamental de
mands: a state to end the Palestinian diaspora and
recognition of PLO leadership.
Diplomacy working
Arafat increasingly has been relying on diplo
macy in recent months to attract recognition in
Europe of his leadership. In two recent successes.
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing of France cal
led for PLO participation in negotiations leading to
Palestinian self-determination, and Austria
granted a PLO representative quasi-diplomatic
status.
At the same time, however, Arafat and his aides
regard the United States as the only nation capable
of exercising real influence over Israel. They thus
see Washington's diplomacy as the key to their
future. As a result. Carter's recent turnaround on a
vote against Israel in the U.N. Security Council
marked a setback for those within the PLO who
were advocating patience with the United States to
see whether Arafat's moderation could produce
the same results there as it seems to be in Europe.
Lack of control
Analysts here were hesitant to point to Mon
day's raid as a sign of hardening, however, because
it is difficult to tell how much control Arafat and his
aides exercise over such hardline groups as the
Arab Liberation Front.
PLO spokesmen here refused all comment on
the Israeli kibbutz operation, indicating Arafat did
not want to be associated with it. The guerrilla chief
has in the past, however, kept his distance from
unattractive commando activities that in fact were
run by the PLO leadership. This was the case with
Black September, the terror team responsible for
the Munich Olympic Games tragedy.
