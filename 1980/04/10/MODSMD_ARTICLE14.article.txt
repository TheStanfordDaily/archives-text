# Students now able to verify SAT scores
## 
### David Frank Staff Writer 
From Daily wire services and staff reports
Students will be able to verify
their scores on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test for the first time
effective this fall.
This is just one of the signific
ant changes in the SAT program
that were announced this week
by George I lanford, president of
the College Entrance Examina
tions Board (CEEB).
By sending a small fee to the
College Board, students taking
the SAT will be able to get back
their actual scoring sheets, as
well as a scoring key that will
enable them to check their
scores.
Hanford emphasized that
these changes are not an admis
sion by the College Board that
their tests have been faulty.
Rather, in a recent Los Angeles
Times interview, he said that
"legitimate and reasonable con
cerns expressed by consumers
about the tests" were the reasons
for the alterations.
GRE first
This action by the College
Board comes almost three
months after a similar change
was made by the Graduate Re
cord Examinations (GRE)
Board.
In an unprecedented move,
the GRE Board decided March
15 to allow students who took
the GRE on Jan. 12 to receive a
copy of their test, as well as a
copy of the correct answers.
The College Board also an
nounced this week that other

changes would be made in the
SAT program. Actual SAT ques
tions will be made available to
the public a year after the tests
are given. In the past, students
were only able to see sample
SAT questions and answers, and
not the actual tests.
Steps lo halt bias
Apparently in response to
criticism from minorities, steps
will also be taken to alleviate the
cultural bias that supposedly
exists in the test questions.
Hanford also announced that
third-party committees will be
set up to respond to grievances
about the tests.
The predominant complaint
that has been expressed by critics
of the SAT program is that these
tests do not predict whether a
student will be successful at col
lege. Therefore, it is unfair for
colleges ft) use this test in their
admissions process, they claim.
Upon learning of these
changes, Shirley Feldman, assis
tant professor of psychology
here, said "the changes are good
in theory, although they proba
bly won't work in practice. The
tests will now become more ex
pensive, and they will probably
be given less often."
Feldman has researched the
amount of racial bias in the SAT.
With regard to the announce
ment that in the future the tests
will exhibit more cultural equal
ity, she said, "They have always
tried to keep the tests unbiased. I

Researchers at Children's
Hospital at Stanford have de
signed a "talking wheelchair"
that can give speech to persons
silenced by motor disabilities.
The invention — calleda"ver
satile portable speech pros
thesis" (VPSP) — consists of a
small computer connected to an
electronic speech synthesizer
and powered by a 24-volt bat
tery.
Users construct messages on a
small video screen attached to
the wheelchair using a switch,
joystick or keyboard. After ac
tivating a "talk" command, the
computer, with the help of the
speech synthesizer, converts the
message into audible, under
standable communication.
Six persons with speech dis
abilities have used the VPSPs
with considerable success, ac
cording to Dr. Carol Simpson, a
psycholinguist who designed the
language-generating computer
program for the special wheel
chair.
These six are among the one
and-a-half million Americans
who cannot speak understanda
bly because of strokes, cerebral
palsy, Parkinson's disease, spinal
cord injuries and a multitude of
other motor disabilities.
According to Simpson, a few
of the six tested on the VPSPs
constructed messages as fast as
30 words a minute.
One woman, unable to speak
because of a muscle disorder,
used the wheelchair to "read"
stories to her five-year-old son.

change much in that respect."
i N.Y. test law
The ability of students to re
ceive actual SAT question and
answer sheets is not an unpre
cedented action.
Since the beginning of the
year, the New York State Ad
missions Testing Law of 1979
has enabled students to receive
SAT questions and answers.
The law requires that ques
tions and answers for any stan
dardized tests used in college and
graduate sclnx>l admissions pro
cedures be made available to

New York students.
The CIRE Board made several
reductions in its New York test
ing schedule after the enactment
of this law.
This action was explained at
the time by Alfred Sussman.

"After a test is made public, it

"Therefore, the number of edi

The College Board also an
nounced this week that other

changes would be made in the
SAT program. Actual SAT ques
tions will be made available to
the public a year after the tests
are given. In the past, students
were only able to see sample
SAT questions and answers, and
not the actual tests.
Steps lo halt bias
Apparently in response to
criticism from minorities, steps
will also be taken to alleviate the
cultural bias that supposedly
exists in the test questions.
Hanford also announced that
third-party committees will be
set up to respond to grievances
about the tests.
The predominant complaint
that has been expressed by critics
of the SAT program is that these
tests do not predict whether a
student will be successful at col
lege. Therefore, it is unfair for
colleges ft) use this test in their
admissions process, they claim.
Upon learning of these
changes, Shirley Feldman, assis
tant professor of psychology
here, said "the changes are good
in theory, although they proba
bly won't work in practice. The
tests will now become more ex
pensive, and they will probably
be given less often."
Feldman has researched the
amount of racial bias in the SAT.
With regard to the announce

will exhibit more cultural equal

tried to keep the tests unbiased. I

Researchers at Children's
Hospital at Stanford have de
signed a "talking wheelchair"
that can give speech to persons
silenced by motor disabilities.
The invention — calleda"ver
satile portable speech pros
thesis" (VPSP) — consists of a
small computer connected to an
electronic speech synthesizer
and powered by a 24-volt bat
tery.
Users construct messages on a
small video screen attached to
the wheelchair using a switch,
joystick or keyboard. After ac
tivating a "talk" command, the
computer, with the help of the
speech synthesizer, converts the
message into audible, under
standable communication.
Six persons with speech dis
abilities have used the VPSPs
with considerable success, ac
cording to Dr. Carol Simpson, a
psycholinguist who designed the
language-generating computer
program for the special wheel
chair.
These six are among the one
and-a-half million Americans
who cannot speak understanda
bly because of strokes, cerebral
palsy, Parkinson's disease, spinal
cord injuries and a multitude of
other motor disabilities.
According to Simpson, a few
of the six tested on the VPSPs
constructed messages as fast as
30 words a minute.
One woman, unable to speak
because of a muscle disorder,
used the wheelchair to "read"
stories to her five-year-old son.

i N.Y. test law
The ability of students to re
ceive actual SAT question and
answer sheets is not an unpre
cedented action.
Since the beginning of the
year, the New York State Ad
missions Testing Law of 1979
has enabled students to receive
SAT questions and answers.
The law requires that ques
tions and answers for any stan
dardized tests used in college and
graduate sclnx>l admissions pro
cedures be made available to

New York students.
The CIRE Board made several
reductions in its New York test
ing schedule after the enactment
of this law.
This action was explained at
the time by Alfred Sussman.

"After a test is made public, it
cannot be used again." he said.
"Therefore, the number of edi

From Daily wire services and staff reports
Students will be able to verify
their scores on the Scholastic
Aptitude Test for the first time
effective this fall.
This is just one of the signific
ant changes in the SAT program
that were announced this week
by George I lanford, president of
the College Entrance Examina
tions Board (CEEB).
By sending a small fee to the
College Board, students taking
the SAT will be able to get back
their actual scoring sheets, as
well as a scoring key that will
enable them to check their
scores.
Hanford emphasized that
these changes are not an admis
sion by the College Board that
their tests have been faulty.
Rather, in a recent Los Angeles
Times interview, he said that
"legitimate and reasonable con
cerns expressed by consumers
about the tests" were the reasons
for the alterations.

This action by the College
Board comes almost three
months after a similar change
was made by the Graduate Re

Board.

the GRE Board decided March
15 to allow students who took
the GRE on Jan. 12 to receive a
