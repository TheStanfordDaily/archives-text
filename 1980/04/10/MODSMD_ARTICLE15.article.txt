The same woman is now consid
ering a return to work, Simpson
said.
"On the whole our patients
found the wheelchair extremely
useful because it gave them real
freedom to speak," Simpson ad
ded. People afflicted with speech
disorders often depend on writ
ten messages and other time
consuming communication
methods and aids.
"The wheelchair enables them
to live more productive lives,"
she added.

Simpson and her colleagues at
Psycholinguistic Research As
sociates in Menlo Park de
veloped the VPSP with Maurice
Leßlanc, chief of rehabilitation
engineering at the Children's
Hospital, and Charles Lingcl, an
electrical engineer. Funding for
the project came from a grant of
the NASA-Ames Research
Center in Mountain View.
The phrases, words and letters
selected to build messages are
organized into different
categories within the computer

program such as sections of use
ful phrases, questions and com
monly used words.
How a user builds a message
depends on the severity of his or
her disability.
The research team developed
three versions of the wheelchair.
The first version is for those
most disabled. A person uses a
single switch to display a mes
sage on the video screen.
Simpson said this switch can be
activated "by anything from a

blink of an eye to a muscle
twitch." The same blink or mus
cle twitch can then activate the
"talk" command.
A user operates the second
version by moving a joystick
either by hand, foot or even by
mouth. The third and fastest ot
the models allows a user to type
messages on a keyboard.
Prospects for marketing the
VPSP seem good, the designers
agree. After seeing demonstra
tions at communications and
computer fairs in New York. I os
Angeles and San Francisco, sev
eral firms have already expres
sed an interest in manufacturing
it. Simpson said.
In addition, the booming elec
tronics industry has drastically
reduced the cost of the sophisti
cated device. In the two years
Simpson and her associates have
spent developing the talking
wheelchair, the price for parts
has dropped from $11.00(1 to
$3000.
But before marketing of the
VPSP begins, researchers want
to iron out one wrinkle: the
wheelchair's electronic speech
synthesizer speaks only in male
voice tones. According to
Simpson, researchers currently
have insufficient acoustic data on
the production of the female
voice.
The VPSP will be shown April
19 at the Bay Area Computer
Fair at La Esperan/a South
Center for the Handicapped in
San Mateo.
