# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editors perspective Daily fee assessment 
### 
Listed below you will find the Daily s
endorsements for 13 of the 14 fee assess
ment requests listed on next week's ASSU
spring election ballot. Conspicuously mis
sing is an endorsement of our own three
quarter assessment. A little information
concerning the decision-making process of
the Daily will make it clear why our nine
person editorial board decided not to take
an endorsement stand on the Daily's own
assessment.
I he editorial board, in its endorsements,
has tried to assess each requesting group's
financial needs, managerial quality, degree
of student participation, campus-wide be
nefit and alternative funding possibilities.
It has tried to objectively determine the
importance of each group's request, in light
of such factors. For our readers to give
credence to the board's judgments, we be
lieve it is fitting to omit any mention of the
Daily's assessment request. We can't pre
tend to give a fair critique of our own as
sessment request without tainting our
other endorsements.
However, all of this is not to say that the
Daily does not support its own fee assess
ment. On the contrary, we feel a three
quarter assessment, which accounted for
approximately $30,000 of revenues, is a
fair fee for students here to pay for a daily

newspaper distributed free throughout
campus at more than 140 locations. It a
student chooses not to claim the assess
ment refund, the $3 yearly fee amounts to
less than two cents per issue for those stu
dents who read the Daily regularly.
In addition, the student fees, when com
bined with a yearly faculty/staff subscrip
tion of $ 14,000, account for approximately
10 percent of the Daily's yearly revenues.
This money has. for the last three years,
allowed the Daily to strengthen financially
while providing the community with more
serv ices. The newspaper is averaging more
than 11 pages daily, the highest ever, allow
ing us to give you more news from a wider
variety of sources with our addition ot the
Los Angeles Times/Washington Post wire
service.
In short, we are continually doing our
best to improve the quality of the Daily. If
you read the Daily and appreciate the job
we are doing, I hope you will vote Yes next
week on the Daily fee assessment. Your
continued support will enable us to con
tinue to grow and improve as well as pro
vide us with added financial security to
avoid financial hardships that might ad
versely affect our operations.
