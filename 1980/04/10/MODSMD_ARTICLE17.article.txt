## Assessment endorsements 
### 
On Tuesday and Wednesday of next
week, 14 fee assessment requests will come
before ASSU voters for approval. For the
wide spectrum of groups requesting fee as
sessments, from umbrella organizations
such as the Academic Organizations Board
and the Publications Board that serve smal
ler student-service organizations, to
specialized ones such as KZSU. the
Theatre Guild and the Band, the fee as
sessments are often the major — or only —
source of funding for their programs. Many
would be forced to severely curtail their
activities, or even shut down without these
funds.
Because of this fact, it is essential that
students take the time and make the effort
to study the proposed assessments and
vote, not only because of the importance of
the student services and the large amount
of money to be assessed ($24 if all assess
ments pass), but because 20 percent of re
gistered students must vote to certify an
election and approve an assessment. Two
years ago, eight of the 11 assessment re
quests failed to receive 20 percent of the
eligible vote, placing the funding of the
organizations in jeopardy and necessitat
ing a special election which cost the ASSU
about $600.
We make the following recommenda
tions for seven of the fee assessment re
quests appearing on next week's ballot.
Endorsements for six other requests will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.
AOB — Yes
The Academic Organizations Board
provides funding for a wide variety of
academic, departmental and pre
professional programs that benefit many
students and have no other source of fund
ing. We recommend the approval of this
one-quarter, $1 fee assessment.
Stanford Band — Yes
The Band is asking for a three-quarter,
$ 1 fee assessment to finance a fall trip to an
away football game and a winter journey to
an away basketball game. This request is a
$1 increase over last year's, a hike attri
buted to increased transportation costs.
We support this assessment because the
Band is a positive emmissary of the Uni
versity during these trips and because al
ternative funding appears to be unlikely.
Still, a serious question remains as to
whether funding of a promotional trip like
this is best provided by students, most of
whom are not fortunate enough to witness
the Band's antics in far-off places. But until
the University, or some other source of
funding, is willing to assume the responsi
bility of supporting the Band in its support
of the football team and the University, it
will rest with the students to do the job. We
therefore recommend a Yes vote on the
Band's fee assessment.
Chaparral — No endorsement
We are refraining from recommending a
Yes or No vote on this request for a variety
of reasons. Like the Daily, the Chaparral is
a publication facing the financial pressures
associated with a heavy dependence on ad
vertising revenues. As an organization with
a committment to improving the quality of
its magazine, the Chaparral could put to
good use their requested one-quarter, $1
fee assessment. Still, the Chaparral seems

not to have reached a consensus among its
staff as to exactly how the money would he
put to use and whether or not the added
revenues would allow the magazine to
lower its 75 cent price tag. With these con
flicting benefits and risks involved, we hesi
tate to recommend how students should
vote on this assessment.
Club Sports — Yes
We support the club sports' three
quarter. $1 assessment. The program funds
travel, equipment purchases and stipends
for volunteer coaches for more than 30
club sports here, involving hundreds of
students. Everything from badminton to
rugby to ultimate Frisbee is funded
through this assessment, and even with
University administrative and funding
help, several of the sports would lose fund
ing without this assessment.
Glee Club — Yes
The Glee Club's situation is analogous to
the Band's. Both groups plan to use the fee
assessment revenues to pay for a trip. The
one-quarter, $1 assessment will fund a
West Coast trip for the group, on which
they will sing at other universities and at
alumni functions. Here too, as is the case
with the Band, a limited number of stu
dents representing the University are ask
ing the student body for funding. Rightly,
we believe the University should pay for its
own public relations, especially with
alumni. But until a commitment along
these lines is made, we believe this assess
ment should be passed to allow the Glee
Club to take its bi-yearly performing tour.
GSA — Yes
The GSA is an umbrella organization
serving graduate students in various de
partments. The graduate population here
is predominantly made up of students liv
ing off-campus. These same students are
also intent on their departmental academic
programs. Thus, the social bonds most un
dergraduates make are made less fre
quently among graduate students. The
GSA helps to alleviate this problem by br
inging grad students together in social situ
ations, as well as supporting inter
departmental interaction. Undergraduates
here should realize the majority of fee as
sessment dollars go to services aimed
primarily at their needs. The graduate
population has similar needs, and the GSA
meets those needs. Their good manage
ment has enabled the group to ask for as
sessments only every two years, and we
strongly urge students to support this
one-quarter, $1 assessment.
KZSU — Yes
The student radio station here has for
years relied almost entirely on fee assess
ment for funding. This year will be no ex
ception. Estimates arc that about 90 per
cent of the station's revenues will come
from the requested four-quarter, $1 as
sessment.
KZSU cannot accept advertising, and it
needs money to provide interesting prog
ramming with a mix of news and sports
coverage. Despite the fact that the station
is asking for a hefty four-quarter assess
ment, we feel justified, even obligated, to
recommend you vote Yes on this assess
ment. Without it, the station will have to
shut down.
On Tuesday and Wednesday of next
week, 14 fee assessment requests will come
before ASSU voters for approval. For the
wide spectrum of groups requesting fee as

such as the Academic Organizations Board

therefore recommend a Yes vote on the
Band's fee assessment.
Chaparral — No endorsement
We are refraining from recommending a
Yes or No vote on this request for a variety
of reasons. Like the Daily, the Chaparral is
a publication facing the financial pressures
associated with a heavy dependence on ad
vertising revenues. As an organization with
a committment to improving the quality of
its magazine, the Chaparral could put to
good use their requested one-quarter, $1
fee assessment. Still, the Chaparral seems

not to have reached a consensus among its
staff as to exactly how the money would he
put to use and whether or not the added
revenues would allow the magazine to
lower its 75 cent price tag. With these con
flicting benefits and risks involved, we hesi
tate to recommend how students should
vote on this assessment.
Club Sports — Yes
We support the club sports' three
quarter. $1 assessment. The program funds
travel, equipment purchases and stipends
for volunteer coaches for more than 30
club sports here, involving hundreds of
students. Everything from badminton to
rugby to ultimate Frisbee is funded
through this assessment, and even with
University administrative and funding
help, several of the sports would lose fund
ing without this assessment.
Glee Club — Yes
The Glee Club's situation is analogous to
the Band's. Both groups plan to use the fee
assessment revenues to pay for a trip. The
one-quarter, $1 assessment will fund a
West Coast trip for the group, on which
they will sing at other universities and at
alumni functions. Here too, as is the case
with the Band, a limited number of stu
dents representing the University are ask
ing the student body for funding. Rightly,
we believe the University should pay for its
own public relations, especially with
alumni. But until a commitment along
these lines is made, we believe this assess
ment should be passed to allow the Glee
Club to take its bi-yearly performing tour.
GSA — Yes
The GSA is an umbrella organization
serving graduate students in various de
partments. The graduate population here
is predominantly made up of students liv
ing off-campus. These same students are
also intent on their departmental academic
programs. Thus, the social bonds most un
dergraduates make are made less fre
quently among graduate students. The
GSA helps to alleviate this problem by br
inging grad students together in social situ
ations, as well as supporting inter
departmental interaction. Undergraduates
here should realize the majority of fee as
sessment dollars go to services aimed
primarily at their needs. The graduate
population has similar needs, and the GSA
meets those needs. Their good manage
ment has enabled the group to ask for as
sessments only every two years, and we
strongly urge students to support this
one-quarter, $1 assessment.
KZSU — Yes
The student radio station here has for
years relied almost entirely on fee assess
ment for funding. This year will be no ex
ception. Estimates arc that about 90 per
cent of the station's revenues will come
from the requested four-quarter, $1 as
sessment.
KZSU cannot accept advertising, and it
needs money to provide interesting prog
ramming with a mix of news and sports
coverage. Despite the fact that the station
is asking for a hefty four-quarter assess
ment, we feel justified, even obligated, to
recommend you vote Yes on this assess
ment. Without it, the station will have to
shut down.
On Tuesday and Wednesday of next
week, 14 fee assessment requests will come
before ASSU voters for approval. For the
wide spectrum of groups requesting fee as
sessments, from umbrella organizations
such as the Academic Organizations Board
and the Publications Board that serve smal
ler student-service organizations, to
specialized ones such as KZSU. the
Theatre Guild and the Band, the fee as
sessments are often the major — or only —
source of funding for their programs. Many
would be forced to severely curtail their
activities, or even shut down without these
funds.
Because of this fact, it is essential that
students take the time and make the effort
to study the proposed assessments and
vote, not only because of the importance of
the student services and the large amount
of money to be assessed ($24 if all assess
ments pass), but because 20 percent of re
gistered students must vote to certify an
election and approve an assessment. Two
years ago, eight of the 11 assessment re
quests failed to receive 20 percent of the
eligible vote, placing the funding of the
organizations in jeopardy and necessitat
ing a special election which cost the ASSU
about $600.
We make the following recommenda
tions for seven of the fee assessment re
quests appearing on next week's ballot.
Endorsements for six other requests will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.
AOB — Yes
The Academic Organizations Board
provides funding for a wide variety of
academic, departmental and pre
professional programs that benefit many
students and have no other source of fund
ing. We recommend the approval of this
one-quarter, $1 fee assessment.
Stanford Band — Yes
The Band is asking for a three-quarter,
$ 1 fee assessment to finance a fall trip to an
away football game and a winter journey to
an away basketball game. This request is a
$1 increase over last year's, a hike attri
buted to increased transportation costs.
We support this assessment because the
Band is a positive emmissary of the Uni
versity during these trips and because al
ternative funding appears to be unlikely.
Still, a serious question remains as to
whether funding of a promotional trip like
this is best provided by students, most of
whom are not fortunate enough to witness
the Band's antics in far-off places. But until
the University, or some other source of
funding, is willing to assume the responsi
bility of supporting the Band in its support
of the football team and the University, it
will rest with the students to do the job. We
therefore recommend a Yes vote on the
Band's fee assessment.
