## Buckley's arguments are 'empty' 
### 
William Buckley, like a watercolor painter,
blends colorful facts into brilliant rhetoric.
His problem is that he uses too much water:
sometime after he speaks, the colors run and
he is left with a bare canvas — his empty
argument.
Among Buckley's watered-down argu
ments, he emphasizes the "philosophical im
perative" that America must implement a
uniform tax rate. Quoting John Stuart Mill
out of context, Buckley bases his argument
on the notion that democracies should "treat
all people alike even though they are diffe
rent."
Hence. Buckley is arguing that "American
democracy" should treat all citizens equally,
by confiscating the same portion of their in
comes. There are two inherent faults in this
argument that negate its merit: first, and
most obviously, America is by no definition a
democracy, nor can it be. considering its size.
A democracy implies equality, but a rep
resentative republic, by definition, mandates
a hierarchy. If every citizen had equal voting
power, our Congress' present rate of ineffi
ciency would seem like lightning speed.

Second, and more importantly, Buckley
errs in assuming that his definition of equal
its is the correct one. Equality can he defined
as equivalance of taxes as an absolute sum,
rather than as a percentage rate; or it can
imply equal opportunity or even identical
income for all bureaucrats. None is an abso
lute definition, and therefore Buckley's "im
perative" is based on a faulty definition. It
could be just as well argued, indeed, that it is
a philosophical imperative to avoid arresting
habitual criminals — to do so would be to
differentiate among people, and as Buckley
says, that is not the role of a democracy.
Clearly people are different. To prevent
our government from recognizing the fact
would be an unnecessary means of further
confusing our poor, befuddled bureaucracy.
Buckley also maintains that he is a conser
vative. Most people probably think that he is.
1 lowever. this is but one more blank canvas:
Buckley is no conservative.
By his own definition, a conservative is a
"political realist." More directly, a conserva
tive is one who believes that change would
only worsen our problems. Such a person
distrusts other people, thinking that power

vested in individuals, instead of in different
forces such as the free market, will inevitably
turn into corruption, or at least a welfare
state. Such a man would be opposed to big
government in all of its manifestations.
Would this conservative trust our present
nuclear arsenal in the hands of a few men in
Washington? Never! If he were powerful,
would he try to prevent those same men from
spending $146 billion on weapons this year,
when our nuclear arsenal is now capable of
covering the Soviet Union with the equiva
lent of four feet of TNT? Immediately.
A conservative would want to protect the
earth, both from Soviet weapons and from
our own. He would, after a brief perusal;
strongly advocate SALT-I I, along with a free
market economy for America. "Axe
bureaucracy," he would say, "whether it be
military or civilian." Buckley is not such a
man. A rightist he may be — along with
Ronald Reagan — but conservatives they are
not. We should have more respect for those
political words.
