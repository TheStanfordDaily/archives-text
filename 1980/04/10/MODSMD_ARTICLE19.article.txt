# Courtesy and politeness have died
## 
### 
I would be much more com
fortable if I were writing about
the horrors of nuclear power or
saving Alaska or even what I did
over my spring vacation. But I
can't. For despite the hypocrisy 1
will reveal, despite the soapbox
you will think I am standing on. I
am compelled to write about
something seemingly trivial but
actually crucial.
Courtesy has died.
Somewhere amid midterms,
too many nights of four hours of
sleep and mile-long lines at the
CPPC, simple politeness has left
us. Not that it isn't resurrectable,
but it isn't even near rising. With
only a handful of people who are
exceptions, we are in such a
hurry to get through the line at
the Co-op or so concerned about
money that we leave a five per
cent tip, that we mistake rude
ness for accepted behavior.
Please and thank you have taken
permanent vacations from our
vocabularies.
My intention is not to lecture,
only to remind. Forgive me for

sounding like the former. But
when 1 watch a perfectly-able
person try to get away with park
ing in a handicapped zone, or I
watch someone get angry over
something as trivial as coffee not
being ready. I feel sure we have
forgotten something important.
I don't doubt that Mom taught
you at least please, thank you and
a bit of patience. But Mom
would be ashamed of us now.
If sounds silly to say "be nice!"
And there is more to being kind
than saying "Have a nice day" to
everyone you meet, but it
doesn't hurt. It can make such a
difference. It matters enorm
ously whether your physics pro
fessor tells you you flunked his
final, but in the same breath tells
you he is sorry and it must have
been a fluke and he would be
glad to go over it at your con
venience, or if he instead throws
you your final, says he's in a
hurry and gives you that "how
did you get into Stanford?" look.
There is the teller at Wells
Fargo who smiles patiently, de

spite the 30 people behind you,
while you figure out why you're
overdrawn. Or there's the
checker who lets you pay the 40
cents you owe tomorrow. And
then there is the time you're try
ing to get on Highway 101 and
someone, despite the rush-hour
traffic, lets you get into the flow
of cars. It can make or break
your day.

The responsibility doesn't just
lie with professors or bank tel
lers. You can take the time to
thank the food service staff or
refrain from cutting in front of
people for a parking place or
wait patiently in line at the Cof
fee House.
The solution to the problem of
rudeness is simple. Decide to be
kind: decide not to hurry all the
time and to thank people for
their services. Decide to be one
minute late to class instead of
running someone over on your
bicycle. Rarely do we remember
by the end of the day if we got the

seat we wanted or we let a car go
in front of us.
Why be kind? 1 see three basic
reasons. It is easier to deal with,
it doesn't hurt others' feelings,
and it is more apt to make people
kind in return. Eventually, our
rudeness would multiply to the
point where we'd kill each other
for a spot in line, to here we'd
treat each other as the Soviets

treat those from Afghanistan.
Kindness does beget kindness
and rudeness does beget rude
ness.
And don't tell me that your
rudeness is justified, that it is
only a reflection of the world we
live in and that it isn't your fault.
It is your fault. One of the
reasons the world is in such bad
shape is because we are all busy
being rude to each other. It is a
circle that needs to be broken.

running someone over on your
bicycle. Rarely do we remember
by the end of the day if we got the

seat we wanted or we let a car go
in front of us.
Why be kind? 1 see three basic
reasons. It is easier to deal with,
it doesn't hurt others' feelings,
and it is more apt to make people
kind in return. Eventually, our
rudeness would multiply to the
point where we'd kill each other
for a spot in line, to here we'd
treat each other as the Soviets

treat those from Afghanistan.
Kindness does beget kindness
and rudeness does beget rude
ness.
And don't tell me that your
rudeness is justified, that it is
only a reflection of the world we
live in and that it isn't your fault.
It is your fault. One of the
reasons the world is in such bad
shape is because we are all busy
being rude to each other. It is a
circle that needs to be broken.

I would be much more com
fortable if I were writing about
the horrors of nuclear power or
saving Alaska or even what I did
over my spring vacation. But I
can't. For despite the hypocrisy 1
will reveal, despite the soapbox
you will think I am standing on. I
am compelled to write about
something seemingly trivial but
actually crucial.
Courtesy has died.
Somewhere amid midterms,
too many nights of four hours of
sleep and mile-long lines at the
CPPC, simple politeness has left
us. Not that it isn't resurrectable,
but it isn't even near rising. With
only a handful of people who are
exceptions, we are in such a
hurry to get through the line at
the Co-op or so concerned about
money that we leave a five per
cent tip, that we mistake rude
ness for accepted behavior.
Please and thank you have taken
permanent vacations from our
vocabularies.
My intention is not to lecture,
only to remind. Forgive me for

sounding like the former. But
when 1 watch a perfectly-able
person try to get away with park
ing in a handicapped zone, or I
watch someone get angry over
something as trivial as coffee not
being ready. I feel sure we have
forgotten something important.
I don't doubt that Mom taught
you at least please, thank you and
a bit of patience. But Mom
would be ashamed of us now.
If sounds silly to say "be nice!"
And there is more to being kind
than saying "Have a nice day" to
everyone you meet, but it
doesn't hurt. It can make such a
difference. It matters enorm
ously whether your physics pro
fessor tells you you flunked his
final, but in the same breath tells
you he is sorry and it must have
been a fluke and he would be
glad to go over it at your con
venience, or if he instead throws
you your final, says he's in a
hurry and gives you that "how
did you get into Stanford?" look.
There is the teller at Wells
Fargo who smiles patiently, de

spite the 30 people behind you,
while you figure out why you're
overdrawn. Or there's the
checker who lets you pay the 40
cents you owe tomorrow. And
then there is the time you're try
ing to get on Highway 101 and
someone, despite the rush-hour
traffic, lets you get into the flow
of cars. It can make or break
your day.

The responsibility doesn't just
lie with professors or bank tel
lers. You can take the time to
thank the food service staff or
refrain from cutting in front of
people for a parking place or
wait patiently in line at the Cof
fee House.
The solution to the problem of
rudeness is simple. Decide to be
kind: decide not to hurry all the
time and to thank people for
their services. Decide to be one
minute late to class instead of
running someone over on your
bicycle. Rarely do we remember
by the end of the day if we got the

seat we wanted or we let a car go
in front of us.
