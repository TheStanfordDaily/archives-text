# ASSU Senate lengthens committee terms
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Students sitting on University com
mittees will serve two-year instead of
one-year terms as a result of an ASSU
by-laws change mandated by the
ASSU Senate last night.
In a related measure, the senate
voted to select the five student rep
resentatives to the Trustees Committee
by application only. This is a departure
from the former practice of automati
cally appointing two Council of Presi
dents (COP) members and selecting
the other three through an application
process.
"Some of the University commit
tees, by virtue of their nature, operate
from March to March," said Sen. Chris
Heftel. "This gives the Committee on
Committees the power to decide when
the student terms start."
Under the amended by-law, the
Nominations Committee will find and
nominate students for committee posi
tions. The Committee on Committees
will monitor student participation and

recommend the senate pull unproduc
tive students from their posts.
"If. for whatever reason, you don't
have a student serving the full two
years, the Nominations Committee will
select a member to finish out that
term," Heftel said.
He said while a two-year term re
duces the number of students par
ticipating on committees, the reduction
is outweighed by the enhanced quality
and meaning of participation.
All committees with one student
member will have two-year terms.
Those with two members will have
two-year terms, with each member be
ginning on alternate years to maintain
continuity. Committees with three, five
or seven student members will have all
but one alternating two-year term. The
odd member will serve for only one
year.
Applications for various University
committees will be available Friday at
the ASSU office in Tresidder Union.
The number of student positions on
the Faculty Senate committee positions

has been reduced in proportion to the
committee's reduction in faculty and
staff representation.
Regarding next week's ASSU elec
tion. Mike Di Martino, K/SU station
manager, pleaded for a four-quarter
fee assessment to appear on the ballot.
KZSU missed the application dead
lines because its business manager
went overseas, Di Martino said. In the
transition between quarters, the fee as
sessment matter went unnoticed.
"If we don't get it, we go under," Di
Martino said. "I think we merit at least
letting the students have a vote."
The senate voted by a two-thirds
margin to allow the measure to go to
the student body.
The senate also agreed to place a
referendum question on next week's
ballot asking students whether they
would vote on a ballot of mascot
choices in a future election, binding
themselves to the symbol that receives
at least (SO percent of the vote. Should
that referendum generate a positive re

sponse, the mascot election will he held
in the spring of 19K 1.
The Coffee House Board of Direc
tors was approved after Sen. Dick But
terfield identified its members. Serving
on the hoard will be Roger Hardy,
alumni association; Prof. David
Danelski, faculty; Maxine Anderson,
food service staff; Laura Mead, Tom
Gart and Dick Butterfield, student rep
resentatives; and Scott Penner, tem
porary member at large.
Once the board of directors gets un
derway and a staff has been hired, an
employee, to be elected by co-workers,
will serve as a full member of the board
of directors, the senate decided.
As a promotion for the newly man
aged Coffee House, Bruce Bendix,
ASSU Financial Manager, announced
a free Harry Chapin concert will be
held May 2 in Frost Amphitheater.
Tickets will be available with student
identification at the Tresidder Ticket
