No food in library
Students are increasingly br
inging food into the Meyer Lib
rary and eating at the study car
rels. Remains of fruit,
sandwiches, candy wrappers,
pop cans and even pizza have
been found on all floors of the
library.
The increase of garbage has,
unfortunately but naturally, led
to a similar increase of vermine.
Neither students nor staff mem
bers have been particularly de
lighted by the now-common
sight of mice, cockroaches and
flies. Worse is the effect that
these rodents and insects have on
books, magazines and newspap
ers. Naturally attracted to paper
and glue, they have always been
a problem to libraries. Enticed
by the tasty leftovers of study
breaks, these pests are on the
rise.
It has'always been the policy of
this library not to allow food or
beverages in the building. The
first floor lobby and the fourth
floor terraces are the exceptions

to this rule, having been set aside
as areas where students may take
snack or lunch breaks.
The Meyer staff is aware of
the need for a comfortable eating
area close to the Green and
Meyer libraries. We intend to
work towards establishing such
an area, but we also intend to
enforce our "no food in the lib
rary" policy and ask for the
cooperation of students in our ef
fort to clean up Meyer Library.
We don't like having to take a
harder line on this issue, but it
sure beats catching mice and
squashing bugs!
On behalf of the entire staff
Elizabeth Salzer
Head Librarian
Meyer Library
