# The
						Knack gets Stanford
## 
### 
The Knack, a chart-topping
New Wave hand, makes its first
Stanford appearance at 8 p.m.
Friday in Maples Pavilion.
The Knack was an instant suc
cess with its debut disc. Get the
Knack, which became Capitol
Records' fastest selling album

since Meet the Beatles But
the critics disliked the band as
much as the public loved it. The
Knack was particularly attacked
for its lack of originality. Dave
Marsh called the band members
"the most nefarious sort of
hacks . . . they have a seemingly
inexhaustible storehouse of

cliches . . ."
The point has probably been
belabored enough by now â€” and
in fairness to the group it did
manage to put together "My
Sharona." one of the year's best
rockers. The concert is being
presented by ASSU Special
Events and KOME.
