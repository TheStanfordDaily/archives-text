Steve Silver's Beach Blanket Babylon
Cloes to the Stars! is without a doubt the best
musical show in San Francisco. For that mat
ter, it may be the best show anywhere. Com
mented one spectator after the 80-minute
extravaganza, "It's so good, it makes ACT
look sick."
The contrast is so great, in fact, it's hard to
believe one would even think about the heav
ily mannered productions put on by "one of
America's top conservatories." Stars is such
a warm breeze, we feel swept away in its
afterglow and temporarily forget "other"
things.
It would be very difficult to improve on
this show which has superlative performers
who act, sing, dance, impersonate and do
anything else asked of them with such
rhvthm and enthusiasm that we forget about
the long, hard rehearsals that must have gone
into this production.
Equally good are the musical arrange
ments, the band which plays them, the
dialogue, the technical designing, and, in par
ticular, the elaborate head-pieces which
draw a chorus of "oohs" and "aahs" from the
audience.
The whole thing is put together by one
man, Steve Silver, who came into his own ! i\ e

years ago with the successful prequel, Beach
Blanket Babylon Goes Bananas!, which also
played at the Club Fugazi.
Actually, the two productions are related
in style more than in story, which is of secon
dary concern in both shows. The emphasis
here is on raw entertainment and Hollywood
glamor with a twist of vaudeville in it. Stars is
a "younger" show in that it does many
takeoffs on more recent entertainment than
does Bananas .which mostly had focused on
'30s, '40s, and '50s' acts.
This also is a brand new Stars, almost to
tally changed and updated from when it first
opened several years ago under the same
name. The show spoofs such recent fad-stars
as Barry Manilow, John Travolta and Steve
Martin, but also deals with well-known musi
cals such as A C horus Line, Cabaret and West
Side Story. A medley from Gypsy, "As Time
Goes By" and "Sah Francisco" are also
thrown in for good-time nostalgia.
Barely perceptible amid all these musical
numbers, assorted glitter and splashy cos
tumes is a \ cry thin thread of a story line. So
thin, in fact, that it may just go to show of
how little importance one really is.
The story is about a typically innocent and
naive San Franciscan, Snow White, who is
looking for a prince. On a tip from somebody

like the Good Witch of the North, she ven
tures to L.A., where she is slowly corrupted
by somebody like the Wicked Witch of the
West. Forgetting about the prince, she turns
into a Broadway star "and triumphantly re
turns to her home town a new liberated wo
man.
On paper, this plot has a lot of potential.
But Silver's use of fairy-tale characters shows
from the start that he isn't going to take
anything seriously. Nor does he expect the
audience to take anything seriously. We are
all having a good time being happily enter
tained and wanting nothing more.
The cast is nothing short of superb with
Elizabeth Padilla as Snow White. Shelley
Werk as the Hollywood vamp, and V'al
Diamond, best remembered for the way she
belts out all of her solos. The real star, how
e'ver, is choreographer Michael Shawn, who
keeps the pace invariably gay and energetic.
Michael Ashton's musical arrangements are
equally stunning.
Silver's Beach Blanket Babylon's are fast
growing into a kind of San Francisco tradi
tion. Like the old mystique that once sur
rounded the City, Stars offers a dream-like
world which is shining and full of wonder
ment.
