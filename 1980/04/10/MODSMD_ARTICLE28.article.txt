### 
"When it comes to pump
ing out ja//-tunk he-hop
rock, sliced over solid slaps of
R & B. and ocean hlues. The
Crusaders are simply the hest.
no competition. There's no
one to touch them."
That's how critic Max Bell
feels about the group coming
to Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m.
Saturday.
Along with the Houston
horn trio of Neshert "Stix"
Hooper on drums. Joe Sam
ple on keyboards and Wilton
Felder on tenor saxophone.
The Crusaders are featuring

guest vocalist Randy Craw
ford. who debuted with the
group on their latest album.
Street Life.
The group is one of the old
est around, having survived
25 years and several person
nel changes (both Wayne
Henderson and Larry Carlton
had their beginnings with Hie
Crusaders). During this time
the band members have col
lectively been involved in the
making of more than 200 gold
albums, more than any other
group in the world. They
started receiving their
heaviest publicity after they

toured Eugland with the Rol
ling Stones in 1975. becoming
the only instrumental group
ever to do so.
Since then the airplay has
been strong and the Crusad
ers are quickly becoming a
household name. They have
toured extensively through
out the world and their music
is quite accessible. Or as the
group's spokesman, Stix
Hooper, has said,
". . . there's something in our
music that appeals to
everyone."
