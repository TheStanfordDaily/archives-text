# 'The Black Marble' rolls downhill
## 
### 
Joseph Wambuugh tried, but he couldn't
do it. The Black Marble, his latest book
into-movie. is an attempt to combine the
Hollywood slick which characterize earlier
Wambaugh tilnis with the grating psychology
and stark technology of his last picture. The
Onion Field.
Wambaugh made this match because he
wanted to correct two wrongs: the commer
cialized early ventures were not under his
control. They were terrible. He took over
production in The Onion Field and created,
with director Harold Becker, a beautiful,
bleak movie about life on the line for Los
Angeles police officers.
But audiences shied away, either from the
movie's unrelenting despair and brutality, or
from the haunting guilt trips and paranoia
which surrounded a cop who watched his
partner murdered by two thugs.
Wambaugh's attempt fails because he has
overlaid rather than integrated these two
strains: the popular with the psycho-realistic.
The Black Marble tells us about two vete
ran cops, who meet and tight and fall in love.
Paula Prentiss is the sad-eyed sergeant, who
balks at joining patrol with griz.zled. brash
Robert Foxworth, a Russian with a big
mouth and bigger heart (hidden until the
proper moment, of course).
Prentiss and Foxworth exchange insults
and glares, but work togetherwith clockwork
efficiency. Eventually, as in any good love
story, they also exchange kisses and admit
that they were wrong about each other.
In between theii relationship, Prentiss and

Foxworth pursue cases, some of which be
long in Keystone Kops shows. A major story
involves a sadistic dog trainer who kidnaps a
champion canine; the problems with this par
ticular plot are obvious.
The grudging love story and the off-the
wall assignments apparently are Wam
baugh's concessions to public taste. He also
includes more one-liners and less kick-in
the-guts language than in earlier movies.
He even tries for the first time to make
women act and talk (rather than just emote
and pant), a commendable idea, which un
fortunately fails, too.
In The Choir Boys, women were play
things. Simple. In The Onion Field, they were
limp, puppy dog-loyal wives and sleazy lov
ers. In The Black Marble, they are given new.
better cliches to wear, but the inherent shal
lowness defeats them. Now, they are kind,
tough, liberated, and so painfully obvious.
Prentiss makes a strong go at it. In a film
comeback which should establish her again
(she's taken time off to star on Broadway and
do television work), Prentiss speaks worn
out lines with a mysterious glee. She/A- beaut
iful. but not in the lipstick-cheap way. Her
eyes glow in the dark and even in her lowest
hioments you're hoping that she'll pull things
out.
Foxworth also offers a strong perfor
mance. His old-time cop drinks too much,
talks too much and thinks too little. Fox
worth overdoes the Russianness," but he
gets over the hump — the revelation of the

secret heart of gold — surprisingly easily.
The supporting cast is hard and fast; James
Woods, star of The Onion Field, is devastat
ing.
Unfortunately, the acting does not save
the already-mentioned cliche-ridden,
shoved-together plot and its paper charac
ters.
It also cannot survive the edgings of guilt
and despair which Wambaugh has tried to
include in The Bluck Marble to remind us of
the hardships of patrol officers.
As a former cop, Wambaugh knows about
life on the line. He shows us more than Drag
net raids and CHIPs squad room
camaraderie, Rut, while he lei that special
vision work in The Onion Field, he blunts it
here, and it's painful to see the potential go to
waste.
Every now and then, a scene of startling
impact hits: a cop grieving over a slain com
rade, not sentimental or corny, but matter
of-fact, sort of "He just didn't get out of the
way in time. What are we gonna do?"
But, overall, the movie is cowardly in this
respect.
The Black Marble, in popular jargon,
means the rotten man's hand — to get the
black marble is bad luck — for Joseph Wam
baugh, it means a dissatisfying, frustrating
combination of commercialism with the
truer, stronger view of police life which he
possesses and which he should not be afraid
to show.
