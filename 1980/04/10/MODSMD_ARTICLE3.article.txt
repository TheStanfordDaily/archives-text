### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
The University's next president
should be careful about replacing cur
rent administrators. President Richard
Lyman told a group at Roble Lounge
Tuesday.
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Con
ference. Lyman 'said, "There is a very
strong team in place at Stanford and I
would think that any new incumbent
would want to look pretty carefully be
fore making a lot of startling changes."
Lyman, who announced his resigna
tion earlier this year, will be leaving the
University Aug. 1 to head the prestigi
ous New York-based Rockefeller
Foundation.
While stressing he does not want to
play a wole in the selection of his succes
sor, Lyntan said more than 100 candi
dates are being considered. No screen
ing has taken place yet, he said.

"The selection committees have to
do the job (of selecting a new presi
dent) and they're going to do it without
my help beyond my responding to any
questions that they may want to ask me
at some point,'' Lyman said.
. Reacting to possible implications of
President Jimmy Carter's announce
ment Monday to invalidate all visas is
sued to Iranians for entry into the Un
ited States. Lyman said, "Our attitude
will continue to be, with respect to all
students, a keen interest in their wel
fare, and I'm not particularly anxious
to send people back to their country
when it's not clear that they want to go
or what their fate there may be."
The new visa policy is part of a pac
kage of responses by Carter to the Ira
nian government's failure to take con
trol of the American hostages in
Tehran.
Questioned about the case of former

Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, Lyman said
the University's Faculty Advisory
Board must devise a new opinion about
what penalty should have been given
Franklin in January 1972.
Franklin, a self-proclaimed Maoist,
was dismissed after the board voted 5-2
that Franklin had "repeatedly and
seriously infringed the tights of others
in the University" by inciting campus
followers to unlawful action. The inci
dents followed several speeches
Franklin delivered on campus in 1971
during the peak of anti-war activity.
An appellate court in February ruled
the board, an elected group of faculty
members, must reconsider its decision.
Lyman emphasized the board's re
consideration will not be a retrial of the
facts in the case, but will only evaluate
whether the penalty was fair.
Commenting on the long-run future
of the University, Lyman said he ex

pects a slowdown in the pace of new
building construction.
While he conceded there is what he
called an alarmingly large need for re
novation at the Medical Center, Lyman
added that rebuilding of the Quad is
nearing completion and plans for com
pletion of the Music Department and
new student residence will follow soon.
Lyman also said he was uncertain
whether the forces that have eradicated
private education in other countries
eventually will be felt in the United
States, and ultimately at Stanford.
"I think it's my No. 1 concern about
places like this (Stanford)," Lyman
said.
