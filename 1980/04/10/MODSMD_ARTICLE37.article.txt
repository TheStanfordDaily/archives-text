Sadat leaves without progress
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
wound up talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
yesterday with words of support for the Palestinians
hut no apparent decision on their future in Israeli
held territory.
that. Carter said, will depend on his consultations
here next week with Israeli Prime Minister
Mcnachem Begin.
Carter stressed, however, that there must he "a
recognition of the realization of Palestinian rights, a
recognition that the Palestinians must have a voice n>
the determination of their own future."
Sadat said. "We have discussed and explored all
possible alternatives to give momentum to the peace
process." Then, recalling how Carter moved into the
breach 13 months ago to fly to the Middle East on a
mission that resulted in the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty, Sadat added:
"At this moment, there are Kits of difficulties and
new div isions in our area. But with the help of the
people of the United States and with the help of
President Carter. I'm sure we can reach agreement
and overcome the difficulties."
He cited the new turmoil stirred in the Middle East
and Southwest Asia by the crisis in Iran and Af
ghanistan as making even more urgent the need to
defuse Arab-Israeli tensions through an agreement
on Palestinian autonomy.
At a White House dinner for Sadat Tuesday night,
the two leaders made clear that they no longer have
much hope of concluding the autonomv agreement
by its May 2(i target date.
Diplomatic sources said thev doubted, however,
that the back-to-back visits by Sadat and Begin would
produce an accord. These sources, asking not to be
identified, said negotiations would be intensified and
that Sadat was likely to return for further meetings
next month.
Hijacker arrested in Cuba
An American Airlines jetliner with seven crew
members on board was hijacked by a lone gunman
yesterday morning from Ontario International Air
port about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. He ordered
the plane to fly to Hav ana. where he was immediately
taken into custody by Cuban authorities, federal offi
cials said.
"The man is being questioned bv officials in
Havana and the plane is being refueled." said an
American Airlines spokesman. Tom Gallagher, in
Los Angeles. "The crew has filed a flight plan for
Miami, and we expect them to leave shortly. Every
thing appears to be all right."
Identity of the hijacker was not immediately de
termined.
The names of the crew members were being with
held until they arrived in Miami. Gallagher said.
Flight 348. a Boeing 727. was being readied for
boarding by 74 passengers bound for Chicago shortly
before 8 a.m. yesterday when a black man of stocky
build and medium height, armed with a 45-caliber
automatic pistol, forced his way up the stairs and into
the aircraft, an FBI spokesman said.
The spokesman. Fred Reagan, said it is his under
standing the gunman — dressed in a Navy blue swea
ter over a dark print shirt, denim trousers, sneakers,
and wearing a stocking cap — had scaled a masonry
wall or a fence that surrounds the terminal to gain
access to the plane.
But officials at the airport refused to confirm how
the hijacker might have reached the aircraft.
Israeli forces move into Lebanon
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Israeli tanks and armored
personnel carriers rolled into southern Lebanon yes
terday and took up positions near U.N.-controlled
\ illages in a new cross-border effort to prevent infilt
ration by Palestinian commandos.
The Israeli deployment on Lebanese territory
dramatized Jerusalem's lack of faith in the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and reinforced
overt Israeli presence in a swath of southern Lebanon
controlled by the Israeli-sponsored militia of Maj.
Saad Haddad. a renegade Lebanese officer.
It came two days after a Palestinian commando
raid on a northern Israeli kibbutz in which one Israeli
soldier and two Israeli civilians, including an infant,
were killed. All five of the attacking guerrillas, from
the Iraq-backed Arab Liberation Front, were also
killed in a gunfinht with Israeli soldiers.

Israel charged that the commandos crossed to their
target from southern Lebanon and implied collusion
or negligence by U .N. troops. The armored task force
that penetrated the border yesterday thus was seen as
a signal of determination that Israeli forces them
selves will control Lebanon's side of the border if. as
Jerusalem declared, the U.N. forces are unable or
unwilling to do the job.
The Israeli troop movement also seemed to be in
part a response to statements by U.N. officials here
and in New York that the U.N. force could hardly be
blamed for the commando team's infiltration since
the guerrillas also had to cross first Haddad's Israeli
controlled enclave and then the heavily guarded Is
raeli border itself before reaching the kibbutz just
south of Metulla.
Prime Minister Menacheni Begin of Israel has
hinted at Israeli retaliation lor the raid, and Palesti
nian officials in Beirut have been bracing for an at
tack on their refugee camps or guerrilla positions.
The armored moves into southern Lebanon, how
ever. were interpreted by U.N. officials as a show of
mistrust of U.N. capabilities and not the expected
retaliation.
Begin to limit talks with Carter
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Menacheni
Begin yesterday receiv ed a mandate from his Cabinet
to limit his upcoming talks with President Jimmy
Carter to proposals specifically included in the Camp
David peace agreement, thereby apparently sides
tepping such volatile issues as settlements in the oc
cupied territories and voting rights of East Jerusalem
Arabs.
Begin is scheduled to leave Israel Sunday for talks
with Carter aimed at injecting momentum in the
moribund negotiations on proposed autonomy for
the 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank
and Ga/a Strip.
Following a six-hour, closed-door strategy discus
sion on the Washington meetings, the Cabinet in
structed Begin. Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Interior Minister Yosef Burg to discuss with Carter
the proposed autonomy plan "in accordance with the
Camp David agreement."
Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor later stressed that
"some matters are specifically excluded from the ag
reement." and. therefore, will be excluded from Be
gin's talks with the U.S. president.
Vatican paper printed in Polish
ROME — In a fresh challenge to Polish Com
munist authorities, the Roman Catholic Church will
begin mailing today a new Polish-language edition of
L'Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican news
paper.
Church officials foresee the possibility of the news
paper becoming the most popular in Poland and the
onlv journal of general circulation not subject to cen
sorship.
But there is no guarantee that the copies will not be
eonfiscatedon arrival in Poland, for negotiations fora
formal import license have been stalled for weeks. In
effect. Pope John Paul II appears to have decided to
wait no longer and to proceed with publication.
The front page of the 24-page tabloid edition bears
his photograph and the facsimile of a handwritten
letter from him celebrating the new publication.
The first edition covers January and February. The
delay is evidence in itself not only of technical start
up problems here but of the sensitive talks that have
gone on behind the scenes in Warsaw.
In a press run yesterday, a total of 6(),()()() copies
were to be run off. About two-thirds will be mailed to
the separate Roman Catholic dioceses in Polandfor
distribution by church officials. The remainder will be
mailed to subscribers individually.
"If we can work out an appropriate financial ar
rangement. 1 think the circulation could reach I mill
ion in time." the Rev. Adam Boniecki. editor of the
Polish-language edition, said.
Builders protest tight money
Thousands of homcbuilders wheeled their
bulldozers and backhoes through city streets across
the nation yesterday to demonstrate their anger over
tight money policies and a depressed housing market.
"We've got nothing else to do with the equipment.
We might as well put it on parade." said John Mahan.
president of the Fargo-Moorehead. N.D., Home
Builders Association.

"We are small people on the brink of no work."
said the head of the Maine association. Bud Waycott,
during a demonstration in Augusta.
Spiraling housing prices and record costs for bor
rowing money have sharply cut the demand for hous
ing and threatened their livelihood, builders said as
they staged a score of protests Wednesday.
They demonstrated in Connecticut, Utah, Wyom
ing. North Dakota, Maine, Missouri and Mas
sachusetts. OOP presidential contender George
Bush scheduled an appearance at a rally in Scranton,
Pa., and the North Carolina Home Builders Associa
tion declared yesterday "Saving Housing Day."
Cubans smother Peru embassy
LIMA, Peru — Cuban troops fired shots yesterday
at a man who tried to crash his car into the Peruvian
Embassy grounds in Havana, where an estimated
10,000 Cubans have jammed the embassy compound
in search of asylum, Peruvian Foreign Ministry
sources said.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Peru. Ven
ezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia and the deputy foreign
minister of Colombia held a closed meeting in Lima
yesterday to discuss a coordinated program for help
ing the refugees.
Peru sent three diplomats and two policemen to
Havana to reinforce the five-member embassy staff
that has had to cope with the flood of humanity in the
20-acre compound in a Havana suburb.
The sources said embassy personnel had begun
registering the Cubans, who want Peru's help in leav
ing the communist-ruled Caribbean island. They said
embassy personnel are asking the Cubans for their
names, personal backgrounds and why they want to
leave the country.
Edith Bunker sacrificed for ERA
WASHINGTON — In an unusual blend of Hol
lywood hype and political panache, producer Nor
man Lear will donate $500,000 to the Equal Rights
Amendment cause — in the name of television's most
oppressed and soon-to-be-deceased housewife,
Edith Bunker.
Lear, who invented the long-suffering wife of Ar
chie Bunker on All in the Family a decade ago. agreed
to let her die during the upcoming television season if
a"memorial fund" were set up to promote the ERA.
"We hope that just as people send donations to
charities in memory of their loved ones, they will
continue to send in donations to build this into a $2
million or a S3 million fund," Lear said in an inter
view Tuesday.
Edith Bunker won't be there in person, of course,
since the gift will memorialize her "death" —a fatal
ity brought on by actress Jean Stapleton's desire to
pursue other roles.
Ironically, Edith Bunker probably would not have
supported the ERA, despite her growing rebellion
against her husband's unthinking commands.
Voters reject nuclear reopening
ARCATA —By a margin o( almost 2-to-1, voters
in this Northern California community have opposed
the reopening of a nuclear power plant on the shores
of Humboldt Bay. .•

council, calls for permanent closure of the nuclear
plant ownedby Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and "com
plete independence from nuclear power." It tails for
local government to support and enact necessary laws
to foster renewable energy sources.
The plant was shut down for repairs in 1976 and
has not reopened because of controversy about po
tential earthquake hazards.

NEW YORK — Hopes of lower interest rates and
of more oil oft Canada helped fuel a strong rise in
stock prices yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial issues rose
10.92 to 785.92 as advancing stocks led decliners by a

Edith Bunker sacrificed for ERA
WASHINGTON — In an unusual blend of Hol
lywood hype and political panache, producer Nor
man Lear will donate $500,000 to the Equal Rights
Amendment cause — in the name of television's most
oppressed and soon-to-be-deceased housewife,
Edith Bunker.
Lear, who invented the long-suffering wife of Ar
chie Bunker on All in the Family a decade ago. agreed
to let her die during the upcoming television season if
a"memorial fund" were set up to promote the ERA.
"We hope that just as people send donations to
charities in memory of their loved ones, they will
continue to send in donations to build this into a $2
million or a S3 million fund," Lear said in an inter
view Tuesday.
Edith Bunker won't be there in person, of course,
since the gift will memorialize her "death" —a fatal
ity brought on by actress Jean Stapleton's desire to
pursue other roles.
Ironically, Edith Bunker probably would not have
supported the ERA, despite her growing rebellion
against her husband's unthinking commands.

Sadat leaves without progress
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter
wound up talks with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
yesterday with words of support for the Palestinians
hut no apparent decision on their future in Israeli
held territory.
that. Carter said, will depend on his consultations
here next week with Israeli Prime Minister
Mcnachem Begin.
Carter stressed, however, that there must he "a
recognition of the realization of Palestinian rights, a
recognition that the Palestinians must have a voice n>
the determination of their own future."
Sadat said. "We have discussed and explored all
possible alternatives to give momentum to the peace
process." Then, recalling how Carter moved into the
breach 13 months ago to fly to the Middle East on a
mission that resulted in the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty, Sadat added:
"At this moment, there are Kits of difficulties and
new div isions in our area. But with the help of the
people of the United States and with the help of
President Carter. I'm sure we can reach agreement
and overcome the difficulties."
He cited the new turmoil stirred in the Middle East
and Southwest Asia by the crisis in Iran and Af
ghanistan as making even more urgent the need to
defuse Arab-Israeli tensions through an agreement
on Palestinian autonomy.
At a White House dinner for Sadat Tuesday night,
the two leaders made clear that they no longer have
much hope of concluding the autonomv agreement
by its May 2(i target date.
Diplomatic sources said thev doubted, however,
that the back-to-back visits by Sadat and Begin would
produce an accord. These sources, asking not to be
identified, said negotiations would be intensified and
that Sadat was likely to return for further meetings
next month.
Hijacker arrested in Cuba
An American Airlines jetliner with seven crew
members on board was hijacked by a lone gunman
yesterday morning from Ontario International Air
port about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. He ordered
the plane to fly to Hav ana. where he was immediately
taken into custody by Cuban authorities, federal offi
cials said.
"The man is being questioned bv officials in
Havana and the plane is being refueled." said an
American Airlines spokesman. Tom Gallagher, in
Los Angeles. "The crew has filed a flight plan for
Miami, and we expect them to leave shortly. Every
thing appears to be all right."
Identity of the hijacker was not immediately de
termined.
The names of the crew members were being with
held until they arrived in Miami. Gallagher said.
Flight 348. a Boeing 727. was being readied for
boarding by 74 passengers bound for Chicago shortly
before 8 a.m. yesterday when a black man of stocky
build and medium height, armed with a 45-caliber
automatic pistol, forced his way up the stairs and into
the aircraft, an FBI spokesman said.
The spokesman. Fred Reagan, said it is his under
standing the gunman — dressed in a Navy blue swea
ter over a dark print shirt, denim trousers, sneakers,
and wearing a stocking cap — had scaled a masonry
wall or a fence that surrounds the terminal to gain
access to the plane.
But officials at the airport refused to confirm how
the hijacker might have reached the aircraft.
Israeli forces move into Lebanon
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Israeli tanks and armored
personnel carriers rolled into southern Lebanon yes
terday and took up positions near U.N.-controlled
\ illages in a new cross-border effort to prevent infilt
ration by Palestinian commandos.
The Israeli deployment on Lebanese territory
dramatized Jerusalem's lack of faith in the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and reinforced
overt Israeli presence in a swath of southern Lebanon
controlled by the Israeli-sponsored militia of Maj.
Saad Haddad. a renegade Lebanese officer.
It came two days after a Palestinian commando
raid on a northern Israeli kibbutz in which one Israeli
soldier and two Israeli civilians, including an infant,
were killed. All five of the attacking guerrillas, from
the Iraq-backed Arab Liberation Front, were also
killed in a gunfinht with Israeli soldiers.

Israel charged that the commandos crossed to their
target from southern Lebanon and implied collusion
or negligence by U .N. troops. The armored task force
that penetrated the border yesterday thus was seen as
a signal of determination that Israeli forces them
selves will control Lebanon's side of the border if. as
Jerusalem declared, the U.N. forces are unable or
unwilling to do the job.
The Israeli troop movement also seemed to be in
part a response to statements by U.N. officials here
and in New York that the U.N. force could hardly be
blamed for the commando team's infiltration since
the guerrillas also had to cross first Haddad's Israeli
controlled enclave and then the heavily guarded Is
raeli border itself before reaching the kibbutz just
south of Metulla.
Prime Minister Menacheni Begin of Israel has
hinted at Israeli retaliation lor the raid, and Palesti
nian officials in Beirut have been bracing for an at
tack on their refugee camps or guerrilla positions.
The armored moves into southern Lebanon, how
ever. were interpreted by U.N. officials as a show of
mistrust of U.N. capabilities and not the expected
retaliation.
Begin to limit talks with Carter
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Menacheni
Begin yesterday receiv ed a mandate from his Cabinet
to limit his upcoming talks with President Jimmy
Carter to proposals specifically included in the Camp
David peace agreement, thereby apparently sides
tepping such volatile issues as settlements in the oc
cupied territories and voting rights of East Jerusalem
Arabs.
Begin is scheduled to leave Israel Sunday for talks
with Carter aimed at injecting momentum in the
moribund negotiations on proposed autonomy for
the 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank
and Ga/a Strip.
Following a six-hour, closed-door strategy discus
sion on the Washington meetings, the Cabinet in
structed Begin. Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Interior Minister Yosef Burg to discuss with Carter
the proposed autonomy plan "in accordance with the
Camp David agreement."
Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor later stressed that
"some matters are specifically excluded from the ag
reement." and. therefore, will be excluded from Be
gin's talks with the U.S. president.
Vatican paper printed in Polish
ROME — In a fresh challenge to Polish Com
munist authorities, the Roman Catholic Church will
begin mailing today a new Polish-language edition of
L'Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican news
paper.
Church officials foresee the possibility of the news
paper becoming the most popular in Poland and the
onlv journal of general circulation not subject to cen
sorship.
But there is no guarantee that the copies will not be
eonfiscatedon arrival in Poland, for negotiations fora
formal import license have been stalled for weeks. In
effect. Pope John Paul II appears to have decided to
wait no longer and to proceed with publication.
The front page of the 24-page tabloid edition bears
his photograph and the facsimile of a handwritten
letter from him celebrating the new publication.
The first edition covers January and February. The
delay is evidence in itself not only of technical start
up problems here but of the sensitive talks that have
gone on behind the scenes in Warsaw.
In a press run yesterday, a total of 6(),()()() copies
were to be run off. About two-thirds will be mailed to
the separate Roman Catholic dioceses in Polandfor
distribution by church officials. The remainder will be
mailed to subscribers individually.
"If we can work out an appropriate financial ar

"We are small people on the brink of no work."
said the head of the Maine association. Bud Waycott,
during a demonstration in Augusta.
Spiraling housing prices and record costs for bor

Builders protest tight money
Thousands of homcbuilders wheeled their

the nation yesterday to demonstrate their anger over
tight money policies and a depressed housing market.
"We've got nothing else to do with the equipment.
We might as well put it on parade." said John Mahan.
president of the Fargo-Moorehead. N.D., Home
Builders Association.

"We are small people on the brink of no work."
said the head of the Maine association. Bud Waycott,
during a demonstration in Augusta.
Spiraling housing prices and record costs for bor
rowing money have sharply cut the demand for hous
ing and threatened their livelihood, builders said as
they staged a score of protests Wednesday.
They demonstrated in Connecticut, Utah, Wyom

Pa., and the North Carolina Home Builders Associa

Cubans smother Peru embassy
LIMA, Peru — Cuban troops fired shots yesterday
at a man who tried to crash his car into the Peruvian
Embassy grounds in Havana, where an estimated
10,000 Cubans have jammed the embassy compound
in search of asylum, Peruvian Foreign Ministry
sources said.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Peru. Ven
ezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia and the deputy foreign
minister of Colombia held a closed meeting in Lima
yesterday to discuss a coordinated program for help
ing the refugees.
Peru sent three diplomats and two policemen to
Havana to reinforce the five-member embassy staff
that has had to cope with the flood of humanity in the
20-acre compound in a Havana suburb.
The sources said embassy personnel had begun
registering the Cubans, who want Peru's help in leav
ing the communist-ruled Caribbean island. They said
embassy personnel are asking the Cubans for their
names, personal backgrounds and why they want to
leave the country.
Edith Bunker sacrificed for ERA
WASHINGTON — In an unusual blend of Hol
lywood hype and political panache, producer Nor
man Lear will donate $500,000 to the Equal Rights
Amendment cause — in the name of television's most
oppressed and soon-to-be-deceased housewife,
Edith Bunker.
Lear, who invented the long-suffering wife of Ar
chie Bunker on All in the Family a decade ago. agreed
to let her die during the upcoming television season if
a"memorial fund" were set up to promote the ERA.
"We hope that just as people send donations to
charities in memory of their loved ones, they will
continue to send in donations to build this into a $2
million or a S3 million fund," Lear said in an inter
view Tuesday.
Edith Bunker won't be there in person, of course,
since the gift will memorialize her "death" —a fatal
ity brought on by actress Jean Stapleton's desire to
pursue other roles.
Ironically, Edith Bunker probably would not have
supported the ERA, despite her growing rebellion
against her husband's unthinking commands.

Sadat leaves without progress
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter

yesterday with words of support for the Palestinians

here next week with Israeli Prime Minister
Mcnachem Begin.
Carter stressed, however, that there must he "a
recognition of the realization of Palestinian rights, a
recognition that the Palestinians must have a voice n>
the determination of their own future."
Sadat said. "We have discussed and explored all
possible alternatives to give momentum to the peace
process." Then, recalling how Carter moved into the
breach 13 months ago to fly to the Middle East on a
mission that resulted in the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty, Sadat added:
"At this moment, there are Kits of difficulties and
new div isions in our area. But with the help of the
people of the United States and with the help of
President Carter. I'm sure we can reach agreement
and overcome the difficulties."
He cited the new turmoil stirred in the Middle East
and Southwest Asia by the crisis in Iran and Af
ghanistan as making even more urgent the need to
defuse Arab-Israeli tensions through an agreement
on Palestinian autonomy.
At a White House dinner for Sadat Tuesday night,
the two leaders made clear that they no longer have

by its May 2(i target date.

Hijacker arrested in Cuba
An American Airlines jetliner with seven crew
members on board was hijacked by a lone gunman
yesterday morning from Ontario International Air
port about 35 miles east of Los Angeles. He ordered
the plane to fly to Hav ana. where he was immediately
taken into custody by Cuban authorities, federal offi
cials said.
"The man is being questioned bv officials in
Havana and the plane is being refueled." said an
American Airlines spokesman. Tom Gallagher, in
Los Angeles. "The crew has filed a flight plan for
Miami, and we expect them to leave shortly. Every
thing appears to be all right."
Identity of the hijacker was not immediately de
termined.
The names of the crew members were being with
held until they arrived in Miami. Gallagher said.
Flight 348. a Boeing 727. was being readied for
boarding by 74 passengers bound for Chicago shortly
before 8 a.m. yesterday when a black man of stocky
build and medium height, armed with a 45-caliber
automatic pistol, forced his way up the stairs and into
the aircraft, an FBI spokesman said.
The spokesman. Fred Reagan, said it is his under
standing the gunman — dressed in a Navy blue swea
ter over a dark print shirt, denim trousers, sneakers,
and wearing a stocking cap — had scaled a masonry
wall or a fence that surrounds the terminal to gain
access to the plane.
But officials at the airport refused to confirm how
the hijacker might have reached the aircraft.
Israeli forces move into Lebanon
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Israeli tanks and armored
personnel carriers rolled into southern Lebanon yes
terday and took up positions near U.N.-controlled
\ illages in a new cross-border effort to prevent infilt
ration by Palestinian commandos.
The Israeli deployment on Lebanese territory
dramatized Jerusalem's lack of faith in the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and reinforced
overt Israeli presence in a swath of southern Lebanon
controlled by the Israeli-sponsored militia of Maj.
Saad Haddad. a renegade Lebanese officer.
It came two days after a Palestinian commando
raid on a northern Israeli kibbutz in which one Israeli
soldier and two Israeli civilians, including an infant,
were killed. All five of the attacking guerrillas, from
the Iraq-backed Arab Liberation Front, were also
killed in a gunfinht with Israeli soldiers.

Israel charged that the commandos crossed to their
target from southern Lebanon and implied collusion
or negligence by U .N. troops. The armored task force
that penetrated the border yesterday thus was seen as
a signal of determination that Israeli forces them
selves will control Lebanon's side of the border if. as
Jerusalem declared, the U.N. forces are unable or
unwilling to do the job.
The Israeli troop movement also seemed to be in
part a response to statements by U.N. officials here
and in New York that the U.N. force could hardly be
blamed for the commando team's infiltration since
the guerrillas also had to cross first Haddad's Israeli
controlled enclave and then the heavily guarded Is
raeli border itself before reaching the kibbutz just
south of Metulla.
Prime Minister Menacheni Begin of Israel has
hinted at Israeli retaliation lor the raid, and Palesti
nian officials in Beirut have been bracing for an at
tack on their refugee camps or guerrilla positions.
The armored moves into southern Lebanon, how
ever. were interpreted by U.N. officials as a show of
mistrust of U.N. capabilities and not the expected
retaliation.

taken into custody by Cuban authorities, federal offi
cials said.
"The man is being questioned bv officials in
Havana and the plane is being refueled." said an
American Airlines spokesman. Tom Gallagher, in
Los Angeles. "The crew has filed a flight plan for
Miami, and we expect them to leave shortly. Every
thing appears to be all right."
Identity of the hijacker was not immediately de
termined.
The names of the crew members were being with
held until they arrived in Miami. Gallagher said.
Flight 348. a Boeing 727. was being readied for
boarding by 74 passengers bound for Chicago shortly
before 8 a.m. yesterday when a black man of stocky
build and medium height, armed with a 45-caliber
automatic pistol, forced his way up the stairs and into
the aircraft, an FBI spokesman said.
The spokesman. Fred Reagan, said it is his under
standing the gunman — dressed in a Navy blue swea
ter over a dark print shirt, denim trousers, sneakers,
and wearing a stocking cap — had scaled a masonry
wall or a fence that surrounds the terminal to gain
access to the plane.
But officials at the airport refused to confirm how
the hijacker might have reached the aircraft.
Israeli forces move into Lebanon
BEIRUT. Lebanon — Israeli tanks and armored
personnel carriers rolled into southern Lebanon yes
terday and took up positions near U.N.-controlled
\ illages in a new cross-border effort to prevent infilt
ration by Palestinian commandos.
The Israeli deployment on Lebanese territory
dramatized Jerusalem's lack of faith in the United
Nations Interim Force in Lebanon and reinforced
overt Israeli presence in a swath of southern Lebanon
controlled by the Israeli-sponsored militia of Maj.
Saad Haddad. a renegade Lebanese officer.
It came two days after a Palestinian commando
raid on a northern Israeli kibbutz in which one Israeli
soldier and two Israeli civilians, including an infant,
were killed. All five of the attacking guerrillas, from
the Iraq-backed Arab Liberation Front, were also
killed in a gunfinht with Israeli soldiers.

Israel charged that the commandos crossed to their
target from southern Lebanon and implied collusion
or negligence by U .N. troops. The armored task force
that penetrated the border yesterday thus was seen as
a signal of determination that Israeli forces them
selves will control Lebanon's side of the border if. as
Jerusalem declared, the U.N. forces are unable or
unwilling to do the job.
The Israeli troop movement also seemed to be in
part a response to statements by U.N. officials here
and in New York that the U.N. force could hardly be
blamed for the commando team's infiltration since
the guerrillas also had to cross first Haddad's Israeli
controlled enclave and then the heavily guarded Is
raeli border itself before reaching the kibbutz just
south of Metulla.
Prime Minister Menacheni Begin of Israel has
hinted at Israeli retaliation lor the raid, and Palesti
nian officials in Beirut have been bracing for an at
tack on their refugee camps or guerrilla positions.
The armored moves into southern Lebanon, how
ever. were interpreted by U.N. officials as a show of
mistrust of U.N. capabilities and not the expected
retaliation.
Begin to limit talks with Carter
JERUSALEM — Prime Minister Menacheni
Begin yesterday receiv ed a mandate from his Cabinet
to limit his upcoming talks with President Jimmy
Carter to proposals specifically included in the Camp
David peace agreement, thereby apparently sides
tepping such volatile issues as settlements in the oc
cupied territories and voting rights of East Jerusalem
Arabs.
Begin is scheduled to leave Israel Sunday for talks
with Carter aimed at injecting momentum in the
moribund negotiations on proposed autonomy for
the 1.2 million Palestinian Arabs in the West Bank
and Ga/a Strip.
Following a six-hour, closed-door strategy discus
sion on the Washington meetings, the Cabinet in
structed Begin. Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir and
Interior Minister Yosef Burg to discuss with Carter
the proposed autonomy plan "in accordance with the
Camp David agreement."
Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor later stressed that
"some matters are specifically excluded from the ag
reement." and. therefore, will be excluded from Be
gin's talks with the U.S. president.
Vatican paper printed in Polish
ROME — In a fresh challenge to Polish Com
munist authorities, the Roman Catholic Church will
begin mailing today a new Polish-language edition of
L'Osservatore Romano, the official Vatican news
paper.
Church officials foresee the possibility of the news
paper becoming the most popular in Poland and the
onlv journal of general circulation not subject to cen
sorship.
But there is no guarantee that the copies will not be
eonfiscatedon arrival in Poland, for negotiations fora
formal import license have been stalled for weeks. In
effect. Pope John Paul II appears to have decided to
wait no longer and to proceed with publication.
The front page of the 24-page tabloid edition bears
his photograph and the facsimile of a handwritten
letter from him celebrating the new publication.
The first edition covers January and February. The
delay is evidence in itself not only of technical start
up problems here but of the sensitive talks that have
gone on behind the scenes in Warsaw.
In a press run yesterday, a total of 6(),()()() copies
were to be run off. About two-thirds will be mailed to
the separate Roman Catholic dioceses in Polandfor
distribution by church officials. The remainder will be
mailed to subscribers individually.
"If we can work out an appropriate financial ar
rangement. 1 think the circulation could reach I mill
ion in time." the Rev. Adam Boniecki. editor of the
Polish-language edition, said.
Builders protest tight money
Thousands of homcbuilders wheeled their
bulldozers and backhoes through city streets across
the nation yesterday to demonstrate their anger over
tight money policies and a depressed housing market.
"We've got nothing else to do with the equipment.
We might as well put it on parade." said John Mahan.
president of the Fargo-Moorehead. N.D., Home
Builders Association.

"We are small people on the brink of no work."
said the head of the Maine association. Bud Waycott,
during a demonstration in Augusta.
Spiraling housing prices and record costs for bor
rowing money have sharply cut the demand for hous
ing and threatened their livelihood, builders said as
they staged a score of protests Wednesday.
They demonstrated in Connecticut, Utah, Wyom
ing. North Dakota, Maine, Missouri and Mas
sachusetts. OOP presidential contender George
Bush scheduled an appearance at a rally in Scranton,
Pa., and the North Carolina Home Builders Associa
tion declared yesterday "Saving Housing Day."
Cubans smother Peru embassy
LIMA, Peru — Cuban troops fired shots yesterday
at a man who tried to crash his car into the Peruvian
Embassy grounds in Havana, where an estimated
10,000 Cubans have jammed the embassy compound
in search of asylum, Peruvian Foreign Ministry
sources said.
Meanwhile, the foreign ministers of Peru. Ven
ezuela, Ecuador and Bolivia and the deputy foreign
minister of Colombia held a closed meeting in Lima
yesterday to discuss a coordinated program for help
ing the refugees.
Peru sent three diplomats and two policemen to
Havana to reinforce the five-member embassy staff
that has had to cope with the flood of humanity in the
20-acre compound in a Havana suburb.
The sources said embassy personnel had begun
registering the Cubans, who want Peru's help in leav
ing the communist-ruled Caribbean island. They said
embassy personnel are asking the Cubans for their
names, personal backgrounds and why they want to
leave the country.
Edith Bunker sacrificed for ERA
WASHINGTON — In an unusual blend of Hol
lywood hype and political panache, producer Nor
man Lear will donate $500,000 to the Equal Rights
Amendment cause — in the name of television's most
oppressed and soon-to-be-deceased housewife,
Edith Bunker.
Lear, who invented the long-suffering wife of Ar
chie Bunker on All in the Family a decade ago. agreed
to let her die during the upcoming television season if
a"memorial fund" were set up to promote the ERA.
"We hope that just as people send donations to
charities in memory of their loved ones, they will
continue to send in donations to build this into a $2
million or a S3 million fund," Lear said in an inter
view Tuesday.
Edith Bunker won't be there in person, of course,
since the gift will memorialize her "death" —a fatal
ity brought on by actress Jean Stapleton's desire to
pursue other roles.
Ironically, Edith Bunker probably would not have
supported the ERA, despite her growing rebellion
against her husband's unthinking commands.

council, calls for permanent closure of the nuclear
