# Baccalaureate speaker chosen
## 
### 
A man lauded by New York
magazine as "the foremost ecumenical
leader in the world today" has been
chosen as this year's featured bac
calaureate speaker.
Rabbi Marc Tanenbaum, national
interreligious affairs director of the
American Jewish Committee, will be
the first rabbi to serve as baccalaureate
speaker here.
A selection committee composed of
senior class presidents Sandra Shanker,
Dave Hood, Gray Boyce and Alan Al
pert; Newman Center Director Father
Eugene Boyle; Dean Robert
Hamerton-Kelly and Rabbi Mark Car
tun of Hillel was responsible for select
ing a baccalaureate speaker. This com
mittee gave the decision Catholic,
Jewish and Protestant input, according
to Cartun.
Shanker said each committee
member initially nominated one per
son to further investigate. She said the
committee chose Tanenbaum "be
cause of his background and the things
he's done."
Shanker cited the rabbi's involve
ment with international affairs. She
said he "met with (President) Jimmy
Carter right after Camp David and
spent time in Cambodia."
He also has worked with the Interna
tional Rescue Committee's fact
finding delegation concerning the Vie
tnamese boat people and the Cambo
dian refugees. And Tanenbaum served
as the American Jewish representative
to the Vatican.
Cartun called Tanenbaum an in
teresting speaker, and one whose to

pics are of general interest.
"Tanenbaum has spent 20 years pro
fessionally as a rabbi who can talk to
Christians and Jews." Newsweek has
described him as" the American Jewish
community's foremost apostle to the
gentiles . . . who has been able to sol
icit support from all factions of the
Jewish community."
Cartun called the baccalaureate
"ecumenical in scope and content." He
said the services will be held outside the
church to allow more people to attend
and to attempt to make them suffi
ciently interreligious. The ceremony
and speakers will face away from the
University to symbolize "people going
out into the world," he added.
Tanenbaum is author and co-editor
of several collections and essays, in
cluding "Speaking of God Today,"
"The Jewish Colloquium," "Religious
Values in an Age of Violence," "Greek
Orthodox and Jewish Dialogue," and
"American Relgious Values and the
Future of America."
A 1978 Christian Century poll
placed Tanenbaum as the fourth most
respected and influential religious
leader in America. The top three were
Dr. Billy Graham, Dr. Martin Marty of
the University of Chicago Divinity
School and baccalaureate speaker here
in 1978, and Carter.
Baccalaureate services will be held
the day before commencement in front
of Memorial Church.
Dr. Lewis Thomas, author of The
Lives of a Cell and The Medusa and the
Snail, will be the featured speaker at
the June 15 commencement.
