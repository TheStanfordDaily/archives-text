# U.S. seeks anti-Iran support
## 
### 
From the Dail\ wire services
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance cal
led the ambassadors of two dozen
countries to the State Department yes
terday as the United States pressed its
allies to support new sanctions against
Iran.
Department officials said the initial
reaction of U.S. allies to the new sanc
tions. announced Monday by President
Jimmy Carter, was supportive.
But they could not yet cite specific
cases where other governments have
joined in any of the sanctions, intended
to pressure Iran to release 50 Ameri
cans held hostage in the U.S. Embassy
in Tehran.
U.S. officials said they felt it was still
too early to expect action from allies,
but said responses were expected late
this week.
The young radicals holding 50
Americans in Tehran threatened yes
terday to burn the U.S. Embassy and
kill their hostages if the United States
tries"even the smallest" military move
against Iran.
Following that announcement, two
American hostages were shown on Ira
nian television in a midnight broadcast
early today saying that the U.S. Em
bassy and some of its personnel were
involved in "espionage."
The two hostages, whose names
were not clearly identifiable in the
broadcast, described communications
monitoring activities from a secret
building disguised as a warehouse in
the embassy compound and aerial
photography by a specially equipped
U.S. plane. The latter evidently occur
red during the reign of the deposed
shah.
It was not immediately shown when
the pretaped television footage was
filmed, but the timing of the broadcast
following the severance of diplomatic

and remaining trade relations with Iran
hy the United States, raised the pros
pect that the militant Moslem captors
and their supporters now would press
for long-demanded hostage trials. Ef
forts to obtain a tape of the broadcast
from Iranian television officials to posi
tively identify the Americans were un
successful.
Visits denied
The broadcast and the previous
statement — the harshest threat
against the hostages by the captors
since a U.S. naval task force steamed
into the Persian Gulf area late last year
— seemed to undermine a pledge by
Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh
to allow more visits to the hostages by
outsiders, including their families.
The militant students later ruled out
visits by members of their captives'
families and said they would only admit
persons they had invited themselves.
The Carter administration is hinting
at a possible naval blockade of Iran if
the hostages are not freed. But in
Washington and other world capitals
yesterday, American diplomats sought
the help of U.S. allies in a broader
program to punish Iran economically, a
program they say could make tougher
moves unnecessary.
Vance summoned ambassadors from
20 nations to the State Department to
present the U.S. case, and foreign
ministers of West European nations
were gathering in Portugal for consul
tations on the crisis.
West European and other nations
were considering taking action with the
United States, but any decision might
be weeks away.
'Parallel steps'
The United States has asked its allies
to take "parallel steps" to match the
Carter administration's four-point
sanctions program, which included
severing diplomatic relations with Iran
and an embargo on all trade except
food and medicine.
But there is no "check list" of coun
tries willing to cooperate with the Un
ited States, said State Department
spokesman David Passage. He said
U.S. officials prefer that each ally de
cide on the basis of its own cir
cumstances what actions to take.
Following yesterday's 45-minute
meeting between Vance and the group
of Allied diplomats, Canadian Ambas
sador Peter Towe said his government
already is doing about all it can. Its
embassy in Tehran has been closed
since the February escape of six

Americans who took refuge there.
"We're no longer importing Iranian oil
and our trade is insignificant," he said.
Canada self-sufficient
Canada is nearly self-sufficient in oil.
For other allies. Iran is a more vital
trade partner. Japan imports about 10
percent of its oil from Iran, and in
Western Europe the percentage ranges
from 4 percent to about 9 percent, ac
cording to State Department officials.
The United States is also hoping the
World Court will issue a ruling against
Iran that could — in theory — put the
50 American hostages in line for some
cash.
Damages for seizure
The court is debating a U.S. claim
that the Iranian government must pay
damages for the Iranian militants' sei
zure of the American Embassy in
Tehran and for the holding of hostages
there since Nov. 4.
The international panel of 15 judges
is expected to rule on the U.S. claim in
a few weeks.
In Washington on Monday, Carter
said he would ask Congress to let
Americans settle claims against Iran by
drawing on $8 billion in Iranian assets
frozen in the United States. The prop
osed legislation would let the families
of the American hostages sue for per
sonal damages.
World court
A source close to the American side
here said a World Court decision might
recognize U.S. access to the frozen Ira
nian assets.
Meanwhile, border tensions bet
ween Iran and neighboring Iraq esca
lated.
Iranian news broadcasts reported
that an Iranian jet fighter and three
military helicopters fought an air battle
with Iraqi helicopters yesterday above
the Iranian border town of Baveissi. No
planes were shot down, but 15 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards were wounded
on artillery barrages and rocket at
tacks. the broadcasts said.
Earlier several minor ground skir
mishes were reported, including an al
leged Iraqi attack near Qasr-e-Shirin in
Iran's southwestern Kermanshah Pro
vince. reported by Tehran radio.
Iraq generally ignored the reports of
clashes, and accused the Iranians of try
ing to subvert the Baghdad govern
ment. In a statement, Ghotbzadeh
warned that Iran would help overthrow
the Baathist regime of Iraq, which he
said was headed by "America's agent
(Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein."
