### Teresa Butzerin Staff Writer 
Making its decennial sweep of the
campus, the U.S. Census Bureau will
distribute census forms to all students
living on campus next week.
Off-campus students will not be in
cluded in the bureau's campus enum
eration.
Students living in dormitories,
fraternities, trailers and row houses will
receive the forms in their living units,
according to Roger Whitney of the
bureau. The forms, to be distributed
Monday and Tuesday, will be collected
later in the week. Whitney said.
Students failing to return the forms
will be canvassed personally by bureau
officials who will collect the census
data, he added.
The form, the Individual Census Re
port (ICR), is an abbreviated version of
the standard so-called "long" and
"short" forms sent to citizens nation
wide.
The form solicits essential biog
raphical data including an on-campus
resident's age. national origin and mar

ital status.
One-sixth of on-campus students
will he selected at random to complete
a longer 33-question version of the
ICR that asks for the student's
employment and educational
background and more detailed per
sonal data.
ICR forms are distributed to occup
ants of universities, hospitals and pris
ons, while longer forms are sent to the
rest of the nation's citizens, Whitney
said.
About 30 University students here
will distribute and collect the forms.
Students' responses to the ICR are
confidential. The compiled data will be
used to determine the distribution of
$55 billion in tax revenues as well as to
reapportion congressional representa
tive districts.
The census forms mailed to the na
tion's non-institutional residents re
quest information on housing condi
tions and families' energy usage. Re
sults from this year's census will offi
cially be available Jan. 1, 1981.
