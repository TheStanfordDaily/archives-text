# Students injured at fraternities
## 
### 
Three students have been injured at
two fraternities that held rush activities
this week.
Susan Bird, a sophomore here, suf
fered back injuries early yesterday
morning when she fell 17 feet out of a
second-story window at the Delta Tau
Delta house. The Delts had held a rush
party earlier that night.
Monday night, freshman Dan
Fawkes and sophomore Mike McCar
thy suffered sprained ankles when they
jumped from an 8-foot-high loft in the
Kappa Alpha (KA) fraternity and
landed on piled cushions in the lounge
below. The KA rush party had been
held a short time before.
Norm Robinson, associate dean of
residential education, said the inci
dents are "very, very troubling."
He added he plans to prevent similar
incidents from occurring again.
"If this is the standard used at rush
activities, it certainly is not an accepta

ble standard," Robinson added.
According to Bill Offet, acting assis
tant Row directors,reports indicate the
partygoers were at least partly drunk at
the time of the injuries.
"As they (the victims) got drunker,
they were doing more and more ac
robatic thing," he said.
Offet said he plans to discuss the in
cidents with housing authorities at an
upcoming meeting.
Police reports state that officers re
sponded to a 3:20 a.m. call yesterday at
the Delts and found Bird on her back at
the southwest corner of the building.
She appeared intoxicated and com
plained of back and neck pain, officers
said.
Delt member Roger May said he was
awakened by Bird calling out for help.
"She was almost in shock when I found
her," he said.
May said he called the police. Bird
was taken to the Stanford University

Hospital emergency room. She was
later transferred to the Hospital's
annex at Hoover Pavilion, where she
remained yesterday. The Hospital
would not release information on her
condition.
May explained that Bird had been
seen leaning out of the window earlier
that evening. "She obviously lost her
balance and fell out," he said.
Both of the students injured at the
KA party were taken to Cowell Stu
dent Health Center, said KA president
Steve Mitchell.
"We don't feel there was excessive
drunkenness at rush," Mitchell said.
" We were sorry to see the two sprained
ankles, but we've done this activity
(jumping from the loft) on our own. It's
a weeknight activity."
He emphasized that the two students
were not dared to jump from the loft
and that the KAs are not trying to en
courage heavy drinking.
