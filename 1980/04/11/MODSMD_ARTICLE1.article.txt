# South Africa divestiture issue cooling
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
The undercurrents of civil dis
obedience and protest ran strong on
the Stanford campus three years ago
this spring.
On May 10, 1977. 294 students
were arrested at Old Union alter a
16-hoursit-in to protest the Univer
sity's investment policies in South
Africa.
The mass arrest was the largest
such incident in Stanford history. It
received worldwide attention and
Stanford was propelled to the foref
ront of American campuses protest
ing corporate investment policies in
South Africa.
The chanting crowds are gone
now — the issue faded in the
memories of most students here to
day.
But as recently as April 4. opposi
tion to investment in South Africa
brought together more than 200
persons on the Princeton University
campus, according to Ted Lempert,
Princeton Press Club member and
correspondent for a local news
paper there.

A group of 73 protesters , includ
ing one member of the Princeton
board of trustees, staged an over

night vigil in the Firestone Library
there this March to draw attention
to the issue, he said.
Disciplinary action was taken
against members of the group, L.im
pert said.
The issue is losing visible support
in the East, he said. A rally at
Princeton held last April 4 drew
more than 700 protesters, he added.
What has happened to the South
African investment issue that was so
volatile on the Stanford campus just
three years ago? Where has the pro
test gone?
Riots
The Soweto riots of June 1976
riveted student attention on the
apartheid problem in South Africa
and were a "powerful motivating
force in what happened at Stanford
nine months later," said Larry Lit
v ak. a former member of the Stan
lord Committee for at Responsible
Investment Policy (SCRIP). With
out the continued stimulus of activ
ity in South Africa, the issue faded
here, he said.
"Student attention span to out
side issues is limited unless there is
some stimulus to keep them in
terested," said Robert Rosenzweig.
vice-president for public affairs and
liason between SCRIP and the Uni

versity three years ago.
"Interest also started earlier and
peaked earlier here than at Eastern
schools," he said.
The issue went through a "cycle
of birth, maturation and decay as
with most political issues." said Lit
vak.
Litvak, who was active in carrying
the demands of students to the
board of trustees, added that
"without a very visible level of re
bellion within the country (South
Africa) it was more diffienft for stu
dents in the United States to main
tain their attention to the issue given
other issues important to 'hem such
as the draft.
"The issue itself began to seem
distant from a lot of people's lives,"
said Chris Coleman, the SCRIP
member who organized the May
1977 rally.
Alternatives
"A lot of people started moving
into other areas like the women's
movement and nuclear power be
cause these are more directly re
lated to their lives," he said.
T he transient nature of students
helped to dilute the strength of the
movement, SCRIP member Kim
McCall said. "One of the huge prob

lems at Stanford is that the group of
people educated in the issue have
moved on," he said.
"The whole issue has not so much
faded away but is now being talked
about in a different arena," Litvak
added.
"The arrests at Stanford were the
first tremor in a wave of student
anti-apartheid activity that swept
the nation," he said.
A culmination
Litvak, now an economic consul
tant who deals with the social and
economic impact of investment
policies, said, "There are things
happening now that are the fruition
of the events of three years ago.
"Some of the demands of the
movement have been achieved in
the last couple of years," Litvak ad
ded.
"SCRIP won," said John Bower,
a former SCRIP member who is
now one of the three students serv
ing on the Committee on Invest
ment Responsibility (CIR).
Response
"The Committee on Investment
Responsibility was formed in ans
wer to the student protests," he
said.
The creation of a CIR with stu
