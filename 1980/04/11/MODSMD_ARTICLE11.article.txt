## 
### Lawrence Knutson The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat urged Is
rael yesterday to move swiftly to
achieve a comprehensive peace
settlement in the Middle East,
adding that he and President
Jimmy Carter have agreed on
"certain specific steps" for
achieving that end.
Sadat also strongly denounced
Israeli settlements in occupied
Arab territory as an obstacle to
peace and said Israel has been
dragging its feet in carrying out
the peace process.
In remarks prepared for deliv
ery before the National Press
Club here. Sadat also freely
acknowledged that Egypt is
sending arms to anti-Soviet re
bels in Afghanistan.
"It is no secret that we are
helping our brothers in Af
ghanistan." he said. "We will
continue to aid them until they
free their land."
Sadat said he believes the
Soviet Union's move into Af
ghanistan endangers the oil re
sources of the Persian Gulf and
he said Egypt intends to remain
"the stabilizing force and the ba
lancer" in the area.
Sadat also referred to the con
tinued holding of American hos
tages in Iran, saying that their
captors cannot claim to be good
Moslems.
"All nations of fanaticism and
hatred are alien to Islam," Sadat
said.
The Egyptian president did
not spell out in his prepared text
exactly what steps he and Carter

agreed on during their two days
of talks at the White House.
Sadat said there is an urgent
need for Israel to put into effect a
series of confidence-building
measures to speed up the peace
process.
He said a final statement
should be based on the right to
self-determination and called
that "the dictate of justice and
legitimacy." But he said the Is
raeli settlements are an invita
tion "to further violence and un
rest."

He said Egypt is proposing a
formula whereby Arab
sovereignty and Islamic and
Christian rights would be ob
served in East Jerusalem while
the city remains united in all
functions and services.
"It would also be open to all
worshippers of God and the un
restricted freedom of movement
would be guaranteed." Sadat
said.
At the end of their talks Wed
nesday. both Sadat and Carter

made clear they believe the next
move in the peace process is up
to Prime Minister Menachem
Begin of Israel, who arrives next
week for his own set of meetings
with the American president.
Diplomatic sources said Wed
nesday the talks with Carter
went well.
There were indications ways
may be found to disengage Is
rael's security concerns from
other issues in the negotiations,
said the sources, who asked not

to be identified.
After the Carter-Begin meet
ings. according to the sources,
negotiations on Palestinian self
rule will be shifted from the
Mideast to Washington. The
plan is for teams headed by
Egyptian Prime Minister Mus
tapha Khalil and Israeli Interior
Minister Joseph Burg to meet
here toward the end of April.
This probably will he followed
in May by the return of Sadat and
Begin for further summit talks
with Carter, the sources said.
Meanwhile, Sol Linowitz, Car
ter's special Mideast mediator,
told reporters: "II there is a real
commitment, we could in two
weeks put together an agree
ment — less than that, 10 days."
Linowitz said that with Begin*s
approval, the negotiations would
move at "an accelerated pace."
Meeting the May 26 target date
for an autonomy plan could he
"a real possibility," he said.
Carter stressed on Wednesday
that an autonomy plan for Pales
tinians living on Israeli-held
lands must include "a recogni
tion of the realization of Palesti
nian rights, a recognition that the
Palestinians must have a voice in
the determination of their own
future."
So far, Egypt and Israel have
been unable to define the "full
autonomy" promised in their
Camp David accord of Sep
tember 1978 to the 1.2 million
Palestinian Arabs living on the
West Bank of the Jordan River
and in Gaza. Those territories
have been held by Israel since
the 1967 Six-Dav War.

Sadat also referred to the con
tinued holding of American hos
tages in Iran, saying that their
captors cannot claim to be good
Moslems.
"All nations of fanaticism and
hatred are alien to Islam," Sadat
said.
The Egyptian president did
not spell out in his prepared text
exactly what steps he and Carter

agreed on during their two days
of talks at the White House.
Sadat said there is an urgent
need for Israel to put into effect a
series of confidence-building
measures to speed up the peace
process.
He said a final statement
should be based on the right to
self-determination and called
that "the dictate of justice and
legitimacy." But he said the Is
raeli settlements are an invita
tion "to further violence and un
rest."

He said Egypt is proposing a
formula whereby Arab
sovereignty and Islamic and
Christian rights would be ob
served in East Jerusalem while
the city remains united in all
functions and services.
"It would also be open to all
worshippers of God and the un
restricted freedom of movement
would be guaranteed." Sadat
said.
At the end of their talks Wed
nesday. both Sadat and Carter

made clear they believe the next
move in the peace process is up
to Prime Minister Menachem
Begin of Israel, who arrives next
week for his own set of meetings
with the American president.
Diplomatic sources said Wed
nesday the talks with Carter
went well.
There were indications ways
may be found to disengage Is
rael's security concerns from
other issues in the negotiations,
said the sources, who asked not

to be identified.
After the Carter-Begin meet
ings. according to the sources,
negotiations on Palestinian self
rule will be shifted from the
Mideast to Washington. The
plan is for teams headed by
Egyptian Prime Minister Mus
tapha Khalil and Israeli Interior
Minister Joseph Burg to meet
here toward the end of April.
This probably will he followed
in May by the return of Sadat and
Begin for further summit talks
with Carter, the sources said.
Meanwhile, Sol Linowitz, Car
ter's special Mideast mediator,
told reporters: "II there is a real
commitment, we could in two
weeks put together an agree
ment — less than that, 10 days."
Linowitz said that with Begin*s
approval, the negotiations would
move at "an accelerated pace."
Meeting the May 26 target date
for an autonomy plan could he
"a real possibility," he said.
Carter stressed on Wednesday
that an autonomy plan for Pales
tinians living on Israeli-held
lands must include "a recogni
tion of the realization of Palesti
nian rights, a recognition that the
Palestinians must have a voice in
the determination of their own
future."
So far, Egypt and Israel have
been unable to define the "full
autonomy" promised in their
Camp David accord of Sep
tember 1978 to the 1.2 million
Palestinian Arabs living on the
West Bank of the Jordan River
and in Gaza. Those territories
have been held by Israel since
the 1967 Six-Dav War.

WASHINGTON — Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat urged Is

achieve a comprehensive peace
settlement in the Middle East,
adding that he and President
Jimmy Carter have agreed on
"certain specific steps" for
achieving that end.
Sadat also strongly denounced
Israeli settlements in occupied
Arab territory as an obstacle to
peace and said Israel has been
dragging its feet in carrying out
the peace process.
In remarks prepared for deliv
ery before the National Press
Club here. Sadat also freely
acknowledged that Egypt is
sending arms to anti-Soviet re
bels in Afghanistan.
"It is no secret that we are
helping our brothers in Af
ghanistan." he said. "We will
continue to aid them until they
free their land."

Soviet Union's move into Af
ghanistan endangers the oil re
sources of the Persian Gulf and

"the stabilizing force and the ba
lancer" in the area.

tinued holding of American hos
tages in Iran, saying that their
captors cannot claim to be good
