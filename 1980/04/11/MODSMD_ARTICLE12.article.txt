# President demands Olympic boycott
## Carter threatens to take legal action 
### Michael Putzel The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter said yes
terday he is prepared to take legal action if necessary to
prevent American athletes from participating in the
Moscow Olympics this summer.
In a speech prepared for the American Society of
Newspaper Editors conv ention in Washington, the pres
ident made it clear he does not consider the United
States bound by a decision of the U.S. Olympic Commit
tee, which meets this weekend to consider Carter's call
for a boycott of the Summer Games.
Carter has demanded that Americans boycott the
Moscow Games to protest the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan.
The president also defended his policy in the Iranian
crisis and said Iran's leaders lack "the cohesion and
resolve" to end the long stalemate over the holding of
American hostages.
Carter previously had told American athletes invited

to the White House that the United States would not
send a team to the Summer Games this year, but there
have been suggestions that some athletes might seek a
change in Olympic rules to permit them to participate as
individuals without taking part in Olympic ceremonies.
But Carter made clear in his speech to the editors that
no such alternative is acceptable.
,- ll legal actions are necessary to enforce the decision
not to send a team to Moscow. I will take them," the
president said.
White House press secretary Jody Powell said any
administration action depends to some degree on what
the International Olympic Committee, its U.S. compo
nent and the athletes themselves do. But he said the
president contemplates an exercise of his executive au
thority, rather than going into court to seek to restrain
American Olympians.
The government could revoke the athletes' passports
or stamp them invalid for travel to the Soviet Union, but
Powell indicated the administration is reluctant to use

that power.
He noted that the United States traditionally has per
mitted people to leave the country if they wish and a
determined athlete probably could find a way to Moscow
regardless of passport restrictions.
However, Powell said, "We will take whatever legal
action is necessary to enforce the president's decision,
but we're clearly not going to turn the United States into
a police state.
Asked what authority the president might exercise,
Powell said. "There is clear authority to make sure no
body goes representing the United States," but he added
that Carter has no intention of making the United States
like the Soviet Union "where they shoot people trying to
leave the country."
In his address, the president compared the Moscow
Olympics to the 1936 Games in Berlin, which he said
"were used to inflate the prestige of the ambitious dic
tator Adolf Hitler." The Soviets, he said, would like to
exploit the Games, too, and win a propaganda victory.
