"Oh what a beautiful morning . . . Cherry
blossoms, short pants and sandles, green green
grass — the Season of Love has arrived. Unfor
tunately, I wasn't home when they tried to de
liver it. 1 was probably at the Daily office work
ing on these questions:
Bug Me -
What's the story on Stanford's fountains? For
half the year I'anner Fountain was off; now it's
on, but the Claw is still dry. And what about the
fountain in front of the Old Union, and the pool
in front of Terman? Why are these works of art
allowed to remain dry?
Wondering about water works
This was written last month, and since then
most of the fountains have sprung forth into life.
The basic policy for these fountains, as set for
and explained to me by the grounds department
of Service Operations, is this: the fountains
normally operate daily from eight in the morn
ing until five in the afternoon. This is an au
tomatic system that works seven days a week
when the weather is nice. During inclement
weather, which is basically all of winter quarter,
the fountains are turned off.
If it is nice out and your favorite fountain is
dry, it may be because of a broken line. Another
source of trouble for these water works are
soaps and other chemicals added by people
swimming in, or just generally vandalizing, the
fountains. When this happens, the fountains
have to be drained and cleaned out.
Dear Bug Me,
The field between Florence Moore and the
Row Houses was torn up in the fall to replace
some pipe. Now that construction has been over
for some time, why hasn 't the field been leveled
and reseeded? It used to be a good playing field.
Frustrated soccer player
Well, the field in question, called Levin Field
after the kind donor who made that playing area
possible, has now been fixed.
The delay was caused solely by the weather.
(This seems to be the week of weather ques
tions!) According to Robert McKnight, en
gineer with Building Maintenance, there was a
contract to grade and reseed the field after

major repairs last fall. But the replacement of
the utilities line across the field was followed by
heavy rain, and so the releveling was put off
until recently.
As it stands, the grass will not be back to
normal for many months, but now it's up to
mother nature to do the work.
Here's the latest on the medical school statis
tics, if you're paying attention and you re
member last week's column. I hope you pre
meds didn't all rush out this week and change
your major to biology or human biology, be
cause those numbers I gave were misleading.
It turns out that the 90 percent success rate in
the above-named departments doesn't reflect
those students who start the application process
but drop out somewhere along the way. If we
take those students into account, it turns out
that about 75 percent of the students who apply
to medical schools are ultimately accepted.
Now, the important thing to notice is that the
this number is not significantly higher than the
percentage of ALL Stanford students who
apply to medical schools. In other words, En
glish or history students who apply to medical
school have just about as high an acceptance
rate as biology and human biology.
There's a moral to this story, but I'm not sure
what it is.
Confidential to Joe M.:
The method you've tried should be sufficient.
For best results, use the biggest and darkest seeds.
Place them between two thick layers of very wet
paper towels, and let nature do the rest.
As for your second question: Just modify your
favorite recipe as follows. Finely chop your spe
cial ingredients and saute them in butter. Strain
the butter and use it as normal; add the sauteed
ingredients in place of a comparable amount of
flour, and bake!
If there's anything at all that's bugging you,
perplexing you or pleasing you. drop me a line.
