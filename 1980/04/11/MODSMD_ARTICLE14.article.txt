NEW YORK — Despite what
you might expect from Uhe chil
dren of a network news anchor
man, Walter Cronkite says his
kids never were as excited by
current events as they might
have been, had the day's big
stories been discussed in school.
"I was, of course, curious
about that," Cronkite says,"and
I came to the conclusion that the
teacher, A, was not equipped to
deal with current events, or B,
did not have the time, and some
times both."
For years, the "CBS Evening
News," anchorman says, he
"snipped around the edges" of
the subject, looking for ways to
stimulate young people's interest
in the news.
"Slowly, the idea evolved that

maybe it could be done with in
class television," he says.
"I began to look into that, but
it was just too expensive to do it
live, and I felt it couldn't be done
on tape or film. It had to be im
mediate," Cronkite says, "to be
relevant."
Then the Public Broadcasting
Service (PBS) began using a
satellite to transmit its programs,
a system much less expensive
than the traditional ground-line
method, and Cronkite's concept
suddenly was feasible.
Cronkite now is chief advisor
for a daily current events prog
ram being crafted for in-school
broadcast by PBS to secondary
school students. The working
title of the series is "In Our
Times."
The program, which Cronkite
says still is about a year from im

plementation — the fall of "81 is
the target — will involve the dis
tribution of edited stories from
the previous night's news to clas
srooms across the country.
Experts on subjects in each
report — called master teachers
— will explain the events and re
late them to traditional school
subjects — history, economics,
geography. The discussion will
be in an interview format, with
questions posed by a second ex
pert, called an inquisitor.
The project is being developed
by a team that includes Sig
Michelson, a former CBS News
president, who now is a professor
of communications at San Diego
State University. Funding still
has not been obtained for the
series, which will be available for
both school-hour and evening
broadcast.
