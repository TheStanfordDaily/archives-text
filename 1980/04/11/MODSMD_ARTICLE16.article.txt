# Med Center relaxes access policy
## 
### Cici Oremland Staff Writer 
Community doctors will main
tain some restricted access to
certain University "hospital
based" facilities earlier denied
them, said a tentative report re
leased last month by a liaison
committee composed of Univer
sity Medical Center doctors and
community physicians.
After a year of deliberation,
the committee constructed a
plan stipulating that when com
munity doctors who currently
hold privileges retire or leave the
community, their vacant posi
tions will be filled by other com
munity doctors holding clinical
faculty appointments at the med
ical school.
Original concern had arisen
among local doctors when the
hospital announced a "closed
staff policy in Aug. 1978. This
policy barred all community doc
tors but those already with
privileges from use of certain
specialized facilities, and pro
vided for no community doctor
replacements when privileged
doctors left their practices here.
These hospital-based services
include anesthesia, neurology,
pathology, radiology service
with its diagnostic, nuclear
medicine and radiotherapy divi
sions, as well as all other
specialized laboratories, includ
ing cardiology.
Contention
But areas of contention re
main. The report stated that the
University members of the
committee strongly preferred
that new appointees to the
hospital-based services should
become part-time paid faculty
members.

Community members do not
necessarily agree that use of the
facilities should he tied to a doc
tor's having a clinical faculty ap
pointment.
At present doctors with
privileges have been able to
choose whether or not to per
form clinical faculty duties.
Dr. Harry Mittelman. a com
mittee member and press rela
tions spokesman for the group.
Community Physicians for Pa
tient Care, said. "Most do have
clinical faculty appointments.
However, some of them do not."
Progressive ring
"The report sounds progres
sive. but it's based only on clini
cal faculty appointments," said
Mittelman.
In speaking about his own pa
tients, Mittelman said, "My pa
tients have a right to a private
anesthesiologist, not just a Uni
versity resident."
Mittelman and ot her commun
ity doctors also fear the arbitrary
judgement involved in a de
partmental appointment, usually
done by the individual depart
ment chiefs.
The University, as well,
echoed such concerns. Dr. Wal
ter Arons. a clinical faculty doc
tor and member of the liaison
group, said. "We want it to be a
democratic process ... to set up
a method to review appoint
ments and channels to appeal
decisions so that there is no ar
bitrary handling."
Small response
According to Arons, both he
and Dr. Lawrence Crowly, act
ing vice-president and dean of
the School of Medicine, have had
little response to the committee's
report.

"We've received only two let
ters and have heard nothing sub
stantially critical (about the re
port)." said Arons. Crowley was
unavailable for comment.
Yet some community physi
cians that Mittelman called well
qualified have been waiting as
long as one and a half years for
use of the special privilege
facilities.
"They (the doctors) have
privileges for University pur
poses. Almost all have been
Stanford trained and they teach
residents, but they do not have
privileges for their own pa
tients," he said.
Improvement
Dr. Charles Feldman. one
such community physician wait
ing for the special privileges, said
of the report, "It's progress."
But he added that without
greater use of specialized
facilities for community doctors'
patients, "the day will come
when some community patient
(preferring his own doctor)
won't get admitted, and then
we'll see what happens."
Currentlv some 40 to 45

community doctors hold
privileges in the special depart
ments. The Community Physi
cians for Patient Care would like
to see this number expanded,
said Mittelman.
Both sides agree that the Med
ical Center is in a unique situa
tion. The complex serves both as
a university educational center
and as a community hospital.
After moving its medical
school from San Francisco in
1960, the University and Palo
Alto operated the Hospital
jointly until 1968, when Palo
Alto sold its share of the facility
for SI million and a contract
stipulating that 370 beds would
be reserved for 40 years for pa
tients under private physicians'
care.
The liaison committee will
continue to meet to work out de
tails of physician selection for
privileges, including whether re
placements will be made on a
head count or a full-time equiva
lency basis and possible expan
sion of the number of community
doctors with privileges.
