# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorials Assessment endorsements 
### 
We make these recommendations on the
following fee assessment proposals appear
ing on next Tuesday's and Wednesday's
ASSU spring ballot. We urge all students
to vote as a minimum of 20 percent of the
student body must vote to certify the elec
tion and approve an assessment. All fee
assessments are refundable.
LCO — Yes
The LCO provided a valuable service U
students having legal problems, ranging
from traffic violations to landlord-tenant
disputes. This legal advice can save stu
dents from unnecessary hassle and expense
for a very modest cost. Since the three
quarter assessment is the only possible
source of funding for this program, we en
courage students to approve the request.
Program Fee — Yes
The Program Fee receives funding re
quests for much more money than it can
spare. Many student groups, having no
other source of funding, turn to the Prog
ram Fee. which allots money according to
ASSU Senate Finance Committee recom
mendations and senate approval. Among
the groups dependent on the Program Fee
are many of the minority student groups. In
view of the essential services provided for
by the Program Fee. we hope students will
support this two-quarter. $1 fee assess
ment.
Publications Board — Yes
Like the AOB. the Pub Board funds
small, diverse campus groups. The only
means to ensure a variety of alternatives
for sources of information and opinions is
to vote yes on this one-quarter. Si assess
ment. More than a dozen publications on
campus, which are ethnically and politi
cally oriented, receive significant support
from the Pub Board. Without this support,
most of these publications would perish,
leaving the campus to have only the oppor
tunity to read those views published in the
more established, mainstream student and
administration press. Alternative publica
tions have a valuable place in the commun
ity. and the Pub Board deserves your sup
port.
Speakers Bureau — Yes
The Speakers Bureau brings to this cam
pus a broad assortment of big-name speak
ers with a diversity of opinion and appeal.
Such speakers are becoming more and
more expensive. Speakers such as Elliot
Richardson, Tom Hay den and Edward
Teller were brought here this year, and no
admission charge is allowed for these
events. The bureau also helps other groups
arrange to bring speakers to campus and
participates in cooperative ventures with
SCOPE, the Women's Center and other
organizations. We urge you to support its
request for a two-quarter. SI assessment.
SCOPE — Yes
The Stanford Committee on Political
Education, attempts to foster political edu

cation on campus by bringing speakers
here to speak on various subjects of in
terest to students. Its request for a two
quarter, $1 assessment is worthy of your
support. Speakers like William Buckley
and John Anderson have recently ap
peared here, courtesy of SCOPE. The
group has also in recent years ended criti
cism that it brings in only those speakers in
tune politically with its leadership. In this
election year, we believe SCOPE is deserv
ing of its assessment request.
Theatre Guild — Yes
The Theatre Guild is a new, ambitious
organization that hopes to help various
theater groups here, as well as dorms, pu,t
on shows. The group is an umbrella organi
zation made up of members of Ram's
Head. The Company, and Savoyards,
among others. The group envisions the
guild to set up a clearinghouse of sets, cos
tumes and tools for groups interested in
producing theatrical events of any type.
The one-quarter. S1 assessment is a set-up
fund to get the organization off the ground.
After that, it should be self-sufficient. The
services it will provide will eliminate waste
and duplication among productions, as
well as facilitate efficient planning and
preparation of shows.
The group has completed an in-depth
financial study of its needs, and its man
agement shows the promise of a bright fu
ture. New organizations have a heavy bur
den of proof in making their case for an
assessment. The Theatre Guild has more
than met that burden and we strongly urge
you to support this request.
Volunteers in Asia — No
Volunteers in Asia send 35 to 40 stu
dents each year to Asian countries where
they live with families for six or 12 nfonths
and teach English or work in other
capacities during their stays. No corporate
or government funding is accepted because
of the organization's desire for autonomy
and freedom from outside control. Most
funding comes from former volunteers'
contributions and family foundations, as
well as self-generated income from publi
cations, typesetting, transportation and
administrative services for universities and
other non-profit corporations.
While we support the program, we feel
the limited number of students who benefit
from the experience, as well as the vast
opportunity for other sources of funding
that are as yet unexplored are enough to
make it an unlikely candidate for the broad
financial backing of a one-quarter. Si fee
assessment.
The program administrators say that
their hoped-for acquisition of an opening
for volunteers in China will increase their
financial needs. While this may be true,
they also admit that the same opening will
increase their alternative funding pos
sibilities.
In addition, the group's proven needs
are only half of the approximately $10,000
that a one-quarter assessment would bring
in. Therefore, we cannot support this as
sessment, which would benefit so few
members of the community, while strong
potential lies outside the University for
funding support. A worthy group is not
deserving of an assessment based on its fine
qualities alone. A stronger benefit to the
community is needed before we can sup
port a VIA assessment request.
We make these recommendations on the
following fee assessment proposals appear

to vote as a minimum of 20 percent of the
student body must vote to certify the elec

administrative services for universities and
other non-profit corporations.
While we support the program, we feel
the limited number of students who benefit
from the experience, as well as the vast
opportunity for other sources of funding
that are as yet unexplored are enough to
make it an unlikely candidate for the broad
financial backing of a one-quarter. Si fee
assessment.
The program administrators say that
their hoped-for acquisition of an opening
for volunteers in China will increase their
financial needs. While this may be true,
they also admit that the same opening will
increase their alternative funding pos
sibilities.
In addition, the group's proven needs
are only half of the approximately $10,000
that a one-quarter assessment would bring
in. Therefore, we cannot support this as
sessment, which would benefit so few
members of the community, while strong
potential lies outside the University for
funding support. A worthy group is not
deserving of an assessment based on its fine
qualities alone. A stronger benefit to the
community is needed before we can sup
port a VIA assessment request.
We make these recommendations on the
following fee assessment proposals appear
ing on next Tuesday's and Wednesday's
ASSU spring ballot. We urge all students
to vote as a minimum of 20 percent of the
student body must vote to certify the elec
tion and approve an assessment. All fee
assessments are refundable.
LCO — Yes
The LCO provided a valuable service U
students having legal problems, ranging
from traffic violations to landlord-tenant
disputes. This legal advice can save stu
dents from unnecessary hassle and expense
for a very modest cost. Since the three
quarter assessment is the only possible
source of funding for this program, we en
courage students to approve the request.
Program Fee — Yes
The Program Fee receives funding re
quests for much more money than it can
spare. Many student groups, having no
other source of funding, turn to the Prog
ram Fee. which allots money according to
ASSU Senate Finance Committee recom
mendations and senate approval. Among
the groups dependent on the Program Fee
are many of the minority student groups. In
view of the essential services provided for
by the Program Fee. we hope students will
support this two-quarter. $1 fee assess
ment.
Publications Board — Yes
Like the AOB. the Pub Board funds
small, diverse campus groups. The only
means to ensure a variety of alternatives
for sources of information and opinions is
to vote yes on this one-quarter. Si assess
ment. More than a dozen publications on
campus, which are ethnically and politi
cally oriented, receive significant support
from the Pub Board. Without this support,
most of these publications would perish,
leaving the campus to have only the oppor
tunity to read those views published in the
more established, mainstream student and
administration press. Alternative publica
tions have a valuable place in the commun
ity. and the Pub Board deserves your sup
port.
Speakers Bureau — Yes
The Speakers Bureau brings to this cam
pus a broad assortment of big-name speak
ers with a diversity of opinion and appeal.
Such speakers are becoming more and
more expensive. Speakers such as Elliot
Richardson, Tom Hay den and Edward
Teller were brought here this year, and no
admission charge is allowed for these
events. The bureau also helps other groups
arrange to bring speakers to campus and
participates in cooperative ventures with
SCOPE, the Women's Center and other
organizations. We urge you to support its
request for a two-quarter. SI assessment.
SCOPE — Yes
The Stanford Committee on Political
Education, attempts to foster political edu

cation on campus by bringing speakers
here to speak on various subjects of in
terest to students. Its request for a two
quarter, $1 assessment is worthy of your
support. Speakers like William Buckley
and John Anderson have recently ap
peared here, courtesy of SCOPE. The
group has also in recent years ended criti
cism that it brings in only those speakers in
tune politically with its leadership. In this
election year, we believe SCOPE is deserv
ing of its assessment request.
Theatre Guild — Yes
The Theatre Guild is a new, ambitious
organization that hopes to help various
theater groups here, as well as dorms, pu,t
on shows. The group is an umbrella organi
zation made up of members of Ram's
Head. The Company, and Savoyards,
among others. The group envisions the
guild to set up a clearinghouse of sets, cos
tumes and tools for groups interested in
producing theatrical events of any type.
The one-quarter. S1 assessment is a set-up
fund to get the organization off the ground.
After that, it should be self-sufficient. The
services it will provide will eliminate waste
and duplication among productions, as
well as facilitate efficient planning and
preparation of shows.
The group has completed an in-depth
financial study of its needs, and its man
agement shows the promise of a bright fu
ture. New organizations have a heavy bur
den of proof in making their case for an
assessment. The Theatre Guild has more
than met that burden and we strongly urge
you to support this request.
Volunteers in Asia — No
Volunteers in Asia send 35 to 40 stu
dents each year to Asian countries where
they live with families for six or 12 nfonths
and teach English or work in other
capacities during their stays. No corporate
or government funding is accepted because
of the organization's desire for autonomy
and freedom from outside control. Most
funding comes from former volunteers'
contributions and family foundations, as
well as self-generated income from publi
cations, typesetting, transportation and
administrative services for universities and
other non-profit corporations.
While we support the program, we feel
