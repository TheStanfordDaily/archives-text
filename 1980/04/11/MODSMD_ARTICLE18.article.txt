# Support senate reform
## 
### 
Students will he voting next week on an
ASSU Constitutional amendment de
signed to reform the senate election struc
ture. We support this measure and urge
students to do so as well.
The amendment will eliminate the fall
election and provide that all senators be
elected this spring for next academic year.
In following years, the spring senate elec
tions will be held at the same time as the
Council of President's election and tee as
sessment balloting. The make-up of the
senate itself will not be changed by the
amendment. There will continue to be 20
senators and 20 alternates.
The system would allow senators to use
the summer and early fall months to be
come accustomed to the senate procedures
and familiar with the issues facing the
ASSU.
The only change the amendment would
enact would be to give 10 new students
(freshman, transfers and new graduate
students) the opportunity to have senate
floor speaking privileges. We are not con
vinced by the argument that denying new
students voting privileges reduces the re
form to a sham.
New students have traditionally not be
come too involved in the senate, and the 10

new student senate associate non-voting
positions would allow their voice to be
heard.
Senate reform has been tried repeatedly
in the past, especially in the years since the
election scandal of 1977. Some plans have
been acceptable, while others clearly have
not. The plan now facing the voters will not
solve the many problems facing the senate
and the ASSU election system, but it is a
start, a start that future senates can build
upon.
The amendment is also simple enough
that campus voters will readily understand
the significance of, and need for, the
changes proposed. Too often in the past,
reform proposals have lost at the election
box because of a mystifying complexity
that has led voters to reject some proposals
more for their completeness than for their
drawbacks. This amendment's intent is
simple and straighforward. It is an initial
step toward an eventual substantial reform
of the senate.
We hope voters will support this promis
ing reform measure. Sixty-seven percent of
the voters must vote "Yes" on this consitu
tional amendment for it to take effect.
Help give your senate a chance toget off on
the right foot next year and years hence.
Support senate reform.
