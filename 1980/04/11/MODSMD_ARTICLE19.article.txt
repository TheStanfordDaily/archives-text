# The 						to be or not to be (an RA) dilemma
## 
### 
The first time 1 thought about
being an RA (house associate)
was one night my freshman year
when 1 walked into my RA's
room and saw seven girls in
"nighties" and T-shirts sitting on
his bed, oohing and ahhing all
over him. I said to myself, "Hey,
that might not be too bad of a
job." But wait, how does one
know for sure? I think a big ques
tion facing a lot of us right now is
whether or not we really should
be RA's.
At first I was going to ask some
of my friends who are current
RA's, but 1 haven't seen them
around all year. Then 1 asked
two guy RA's in my dorm and
got conflicting opinions — one
dude on a co-ed floor said that he
was getting backrubs every
night, while the other one on an
all-male floor said that he was
getting a little mad about all the
broken beer bottles and vomit in
the hallway, and that he hoped
he would get a better pledge class
next year.
So what's the truth, huh? Is an
RA's job perfume or dog do-do?
Is it bliss or torture? A+ or D-? Is
the person the Residential Edu
cation Office describes as a
"counselor/leader," working 14
hours a week and getting paid
about $1550 a year, getting a
good deal? Should you yourself
be an RA?
Well lucky for you potential
RA's I've done a lot of research
on this, and can really help you
answer this question. Let's now
look at the disadvantages and
advantages of being an RA.
Disadvantages:
1. The Selection Process: TTie
selection process itself is bad
news. First of all they cut 50 per
cent on the first interview. Last
year 1 slipped up just a little bit
when 1 was interviewed by one of
the head directors (I didn't
realize it at the time). The lady
asked me why I wanted to be an
RA, and I told her, "Hey, I only
want to do it for some money and
for some guaranteed housing.
You know thay're making me
live off campus next year."
Well the lady just went crazy!
She acted like I had just dropped
my pants, and started screaming,
"I can't believe it! I can't believe
it! End of interview, oohh, end of
interview!" Big deal, you know,
at least I told the truth. So I want

some housing and money, who
doesn't? She didn't understand
and cut me right there.
And even if you pass these first
interviews, you have to play
Avon lady for the second part,
going "dorm to dorm" for a
couple of weeks. The bozos al
ways throw the same dumb ques
tions out at you every time. You
would get the same feeling if you
taught a seminar at Foothill Col
lege for twenty years.
2. The Pay Rate: Whoever told
you that RA's only work 14
hours a week was lying. No way
San Jose, I see some RA's work
at least 28 hours a week organiz
ing dorm meetings and getting
vacuum cleaners for everyone.
And. if an RA makes $3.33 an
hour working 14 hours a week,
he makes only $1.67 an hour
working 28 hours a week. $ 1.67
an hour! *

In the days fo the Industrial
Revolution this was called "child
labor." It still is today. Geez, my
five-year-old cousin Ralphie
makes more than that selling his
baseball cards at the swap
meets.
3. Social Life: Very little. First
of all you are going to lose con
tact with some of your friends. I
hadn't seen one of my RA
friends for a long time, and
thought he had transferred
schools or something. Then the
other day I saw him in the Don
ner Food Service cafeteria, sur
rounded by all these freshmen
who were throwing tater-tots at
him and pulling his hair. It was so
sad. You've also got to realize
that your dating'life might not be
so hot — a Theta formal at the
San Francisco Hilton is just a lot
nicer than the Spring Ball in
Cedro Lounge.
Advantages:
1. Guaranteed Housing and

Money: The guaranteed single
room and money are definitely
big advantages. I still can't
see why that head director lady
got so upset. Do you believe
someone living off campus
would wake up in the middle of
the night, drive over to a dorm to
let in some clueless kid who had
locked himself out of his room,
say. "You just go to sleep now,
everything is fine," and then
drive back home, all for no pay?
You are the original "Potato
Man - ' if you believe that. Of
course the housing and pay are
important!
And even though the pay is
not all that good, think for a
moment about what you're get
ting paid for. Sure you have some
dorm meetings and stuff, but you
are also getting paid to go on
beach trips and to eat at restaur
ants in the city. Now think about

that, and even compare it to
other jobs on campus.
What if someone told you that
you had a choice of either scrap
ing food service "hudda" off
plates in the Stern dishroom. or
getting paid to go skiing at Lake
Tahoe. You would have to he a
real retardo to choose the
"hudda" over the snow. Re
member. think about what you
are getting paid for.
2. Power Trip: For the first
time since you were a crosswalk
guard in elementary school you
have some real power over
people. First of all RA's know all
the strengths, weaknesses and
facts of everyone who lives in the
dorm. And they let you know
this the moment you first walk
into your dorm. I remember
when I first walked into my
freshman dorm, and the RA
said, "Hi Bill how is Tuscon I
hear your Dad's birthday was
two days ago is your sister feeling

better you don't know me but
I'm your RA."
It's total power, and it blows
you away. I've seen some
freshman RA's order their kids
to "Run into that wall over
there!" and all they do is just
look up at him and ask, "How
fast?" And you know 1 can't be
lieve that people had trouble on
this year's RA application. It was
some dumb question about what
an R A should do if there is disag
reement between people who be
lieve the dorm is a place to hang
out and those who believe it
should be an educational experi
ence. What you should do is sim
ply tell both groups to shut up
and go to their rooms. Cut that
psychological/counseling bull,
just use your power!
3. Dating: Some people say
you don't date as much when
you're an RA. That's garbage!
You should be getting some
romantic action in every night,
and this. too. goes along with that
power trip idea. First of all
you've got to realize that no one
ever questions an RA. You've
also got keys! You can just open
the door on anyone and have
sonic fun. Tell him or her that it's
a "dorm function," or something.
I heard this one creative RA
five years ago told some girl
named Sherry that they should
spend at least one hour together
every night. He called it his
"Sherry Hour," and was having
just the best time. After they
broke up. RAs from all around
would drop in for "Sherry
hours" at his dorm. It became
quite popular, and is now a tradi
tion ij.t Stanford.
Well, those are the advantages
and disadvantages, and we must
now come to a final conclusion.
You've got to look at things in
this life in a "black/white,"
"yes/no" perspective. As I see it,
you have a choice between living
off campus in the "boonies"
where no will ever see you, or
living in a nice single on campus;
a choice between checking books
at Meyer for bad money, or get
ting paid to go to the beach; and
a choice between just "dating
around" like you have been all
your life, or really getting some
good playtime in.

"hudda" over the snow. Re
member. think about what you
are getting paid for.
2. Power Trip: For the first
time since you were a crosswalk
guard in elementary school you
have some real power over
people. First of all RA's know all
the strengths, weaknesses and
facts of everyone who lives in the
dorm. And they let you know
this the moment you first walk
into your dorm. I remember
when I first walked into my
freshman dorm, and the RA
said, "Hi Bill how is Tuscon I
hear your Dad's birthday was
two days ago is your sister feeling

better you don't know me but
I'm your RA."
It's total power, and it blows
you away. I've seen some
freshman RA's order their kids
to "Run into that wall over
there!" and all they do is just
look up at him and ask, "How
fast?" And you know 1 can't be
lieve that people had trouble on
this year's RA application. It was
some dumb question about what
an R A should do if there is disag
reement between people who be
lieve the dorm is a place to hang
out and those who believe it
should be an educational experi
ence. What you should do is sim
ply tell both groups to shut up
and go to their rooms. Cut that
psychological/counseling bull,
just use your power!
3. Dating: Some people say
you don't date as much when
you're an RA. That's garbage!
You should be getting some
romantic action in every night,
and this. too. goes along with that
power trip idea. First of all
you've got to realize that no one
ever questions an RA. You've
also got keys! You can just open
the door on anyone and have
sonic fun. Tell him or her that it's
a "dorm function," or something.
I heard this one creative RA
five years ago told some girl
named Sherry that they should
spend at least one hour together
every night. He called it his
"Sherry Hour," and was having
just the best time. After they
broke up. RAs from all around
would drop in for "Sherry
hours" at his dorm. It became
quite popular, and is now a tradi
tion ij.t Stanford.
Well, those are the advantages
and disadvantages, and we must
now come to a final conclusion.
You've got to look at things in
this life in a "black/white,"
"yes/no" perspective. As I see it,
you have a choice between living
off campus in the "boonies"
where no will ever see you, or
living in a nice single on campus;
a choice between checking books
at Meyer for bad money, or get
ting paid to go to the beach; and
a choice between just "dating
around" like you have been all
your life, or really getting some

'Early-Date?
Kemmeries
Daily columnist
The first time 1 thought about
being an RA (house associate)
was one night my freshman year
when 1 walked into my RA's
room and saw seven girls in
"nighties" and T-shirts sitting on
his bed, oohing and ahhing all
over him. I said to myself, "Hey,
that might not be too bad of a
job." But wait, how does one
know for sure? I think a big ques
tion facing a lot of us right now is
whether or not we really should
be RA's.
At first I was going to ask some
of my friends who are current
RA's, but 1 haven't seen them
around all year. Then 1 asked
two guy RA's in my dorm and
got conflicting opinions — one
dude on a co-ed floor said that he
was getting backrubs every
night, while the other one on an
all-male floor said that he was
getting a little mad about all the
broken beer bottles and vomit in
the hallway, and that he hoped
he would get a better pledge class
next year.
So what's the truth, huh? Is an
RA's job perfume or dog do-do?
Is it bliss or torture? A+ or D-? Is
the person the Residential Edu
cation Office describes as a
"counselor/leader," working 14
hours a week and getting paid
about $1550 a year, getting a
good deal? Should you yourself
be an RA?
Well lucky for you potential
RA's I've done a lot of research
on this, and can really help you
answer this question. Let's now
look at the disadvantages and
advantages of being an RA.
Disadvantages:
1. The Selection Process: TTie
selection process itself is bad
news. First of all they cut 50 per
cent on the first interview. Last
year 1 slipped up just a little bit
when 1 was interviewed by one of
the head directors (I didn't
realize it at the time). The lady
asked me why I wanted to be an
RA, and I told her, "Hey, I only
want to do it for some money and
for some guaranteed housing.
You know thay're making me
live off campus next year."
Well the lady just went crazy!
She acted like I had just dropped
my pants, and started screaming,
"I can't believe it! I can't believe
it! End of interview, oohh, end of
interview!" Big deal, you know,
at least I told the truth. So I want

some housing and money, who
doesn't? She didn't understand
and cut me right there.
And even if you pass these first
interviews, you have to play
Avon lady for the second part,
going "dorm to dorm" for a
couple of weeks. The bozos al
ways throw the same dumb ques
tions out at you every time. You
would get the same feeling if you
taught a seminar at Foothill Col
lege for twenty years.
2. The Pay Rate: Whoever told
you that RA's only work 14
hours a week was lying. No way
San Jose, I see some RA's work
at least 28 hours a week organiz
ing dorm meetings and getting
vacuum cleaners for everyone.
And. if an RA makes $3.33 an
hour working 14 hours a week,
he makes only $1.67 an hour
working 28 hours a week. $ 1.67
an hour! *

In the days fo the Industrial
Revolution this was called "child
labor." It still is today. Geez, my
five-year-old cousin Ralphie
makes more than that selling his
baseball cards at the swap
meets.
3. Social Life: Very little. First
of all you are going to lose con
tact with some of your friends. I
hadn't seen one of my RA
friends for a long time, and
thought he had transferred
schools or something. Then the
other day I saw him in the Don
ner Food Service cafeteria, sur
rounded by all these freshmen
who were throwing tater-tots at
him and pulling his hair. It was so
sad. You've also got to realize
that your dating'life might not be
so hot — a Theta formal at the
San Francisco Hilton is just a lot
nicer than the Spring Ball in
Cedro Lounge.
Advantages:
1. Guaranteed Housing and

Money: The guaranteed single
room and money are definitely
big advantages. I still can't
see why that head director lady
got so upset. Do you believe
someone living off campus
would wake up in the middle of
the night, drive over to a dorm to
let in some clueless kid who had
locked himself out of his room,
say. "You just go to sleep now,
everything is fine," and then
drive back home, all for no pay?
You are the original "Potato
Man - ' if you believe that. Of
course the housing and pay are
important!
And even though the pay is
not all that good, think for a
moment about what you're get
ting paid for. Sure you have some
dorm meetings and stuff, but you
are also getting paid to go on
beach trips and to eat at restaur
ants in the city. Now think about

that, and even compare it to
other jobs on campus.
What if someone told you that
you had a choice of either scrap
ing food service "hudda" off
plates in the Stern dishroom. or
getting paid to go skiing at Lake
Tahoe. You would have to he a
real retardo to choose the
"hudda" over the snow. Re
member. think about what you
are getting paid for.
2. Power Trip: For the first

at least I told the truth. So I want

some housing and money, who
doesn't? She didn't understand
and cut me right there.
And even if you pass these first
interviews, you have to play
Avon lady for the second part,
going "dorm to dorm" for a
couple of weeks. The bozos al
ways throw the same dumb ques
tions out at you every time. You
would get the same feeling if you
taught a seminar at Foothill Col
lege for twenty years.
2. The Pay Rate: Whoever told
you that RA's only work 14
hours a week was lying. No way
San Jose, I see some RA's work
at least 28 hours a week organiz
ing dorm meetings and getting
vacuum cleaners for everyone.
And. if an RA makes $3.33 an
hour working 14 hours a week,
he makes only $1.67 an hour
working 28 hours a week. $ 1.67
an hour! *

In the days fo the Industrial
Revolution this was called "child
labor." It still is today. Geez, my
five-year-old cousin Ralphie
makes more than that selling his
baseball cards at the swap
meets.
3. Social Life: Very little. First
of all you are going to lose con
tact with some of your friends. I
hadn't seen one of my RA
friends for a long time, and
thought he had transferred
schools or something. Then the
other day I saw him in the Don
ner Food Service cafeteria, sur
rounded by all these freshmen
who were throwing tater-tots at
him and pulling his hair. It was so
sad. You've also got to realize
that your dating'life might not be
so hot — a Theta formal at the
San Francisco Hilton is just a lot
nicer than the Spring Ball in
Cedro Lounge.
Advantages:
1. Guaranteed Housing and

Money: The guaranteed single
room and money are definitely
big advantages. I still can't
see why that head director lady
got so upset. Do you believe
someone living off campus
would wake up in the middle of
the night, drive over to a dorm to
let in some clueless kid who had
locked himself out of his room,
say. "You just go to sleep now,
everything is fine," and then
drive back home, all for no pay?
You are the original "Potato
Man - ' if you believe that. Of
course the housing and pay are
important!
And even though the pay is
not all that good, think for a
moment about what you're get
ting paid for. Sure you have some
dorm meetings and stuff, but you
are also getting paid to go on
beach trips and to eat at restaur
ants in the city. Now think about

that, and even compare it to
other jobs on campus.
What if someone told you that
you had a choice of either scrap
ing food service "hudda" off
plates in the Stern dishroom. or
getting paid to go skiing at Lake
Tahoe. You would have to he a
real retardo to choose the
"hudda" over the snow. Re
member. think about what you
are getting paid for.
2. Power Trip: For the first
time since you were a crosswalk
guard in elementary school you
have some real power over
people. First of all RA's know all
the strengths, weaknesses and
facts of everyone who lives in the
dorm. And they let you know
this the moment you first walk
into your dorm. I remember
when I first walked into my
freshman dorm, and the RA
said, "Hi Bill how is Tuscon I
hear your Dad's birthday was
two days ago is your sister feeling

better you don't know me but
I'm your RA."
It's total power, and it blows
you away. I've seen some
freshman RA's order their kids
to "Run into that wall over
there!" and all they do is just
look up at him and ask, "How
fast?" And you know 1 can't be
lieve that people had trouble on
this year's RA application. It was
some dumb question about what
an R A should do if there is disag
reement between people who be
lieve the dorm is a place to hang
out and those who believe it
should be an educational experi
ence. What you should do is sim
ply tell both groups to shut up
and go to their rooms. Cut that
psychological/counseling bull,
just use your power!
3. Dating: Some people say
you don't date as much when
you're an RA. That's garbage!
You should be getting some
romantic action in every night,
and this. too. goes along with that
power trip idea. First of all
you've got to realize that no one
ever questions an RA. You've
also got keys! You can just open
the door on anyone and have
sonic fun. Tell him or her that it's
a "dorm function," or something.
I heard this one creative RA
five years ago told some girl
named Sherry that they should
spend at least one hour together
every night. He called it his
"Sherry Hour," and was having
just the best time. After they
broke up. RAs from all around
would drop in for "Sherry
hours" at his dorm. It became
quite popular, and is now a tradi
tion ij.t Stanford.
Well, those are the advantages
and disadvantages, and we must
now come to a final conclusion.
You've got to look at things in
this life in a "black/white,"
"yes/no" perspective. As I see it,
you have a choice between living
off campus in the "boonies"
where no will ever see you, or
living in a nice single on campus;
a choice between checking books
at Meyer for bad money, or get
ting paid to go to the beach; and
a choice between just "dating
around" like you have been all
your life, or really getting some
good playtime in.

'Early-Date?

Daily columnist
The first time 1 thought about
being an RA (house associate)
was one night my freshman year
when 1 walked into my RA's
room and saw seven girls in
"nighties" and T-shirts sitting on
his bed, oohing and ahhing all
over him. I said to myself, "Hey,
that might not be too bad of a
job." But wait, how does one
know for sure? I think a big ques
tion facing a lot of us right now is
whether or not we really should
be RA's.
At first I was going to ask some
of my friends who are current
RA's, but 1 haven't seen them
around all year. Then 1 asked
two guy RA's in my dorm and
got conflicting opinions — one
dude on a co-ed floor said that he
was getting backrubs every
night, while the other one on an
all-male floor said that he was
getting a little mad about all the
broken beer bottles and vomit in
the hallway, and that he hoped
he would get a better pledge class
next year.
So what's the truth, huh? Is an
RA's job perfume or dog do-do?
Is it bliss or torture? A+ or D-? Is
the person the Residential Edu
cation Office describes as a
"counselor/leader," working 14
hours a week and getting paid
about $1550 a year, getting a
good deal? Should you yourself
be an RA?
Well lucky for you potential
RA's I've done a lot of research
on this, and can really help you
answer this question. Let's now
look at the disadvantages and
advantages of being an RA.
Disadvantages:
1. The Selection Process: TTie
selection process itself is bad
news. First of all they cut 50 per
cent on the first interview. Last
year 1 slipped up just a little bit
when 1 was interviewed by one of
the head directors (I didn't
realize it at the time). The lady
asked me why I wanted to be an
RA, and I told her, "Hey, I only
want to do it for some money and
for some guaranteed housing.
You know thay're making me
live off campus next year."
Well the lady just went crazy!
She acted like I had just dropped
my pants, and started screaming,
"I can't believe it! I can't believe
it! End of interview, oohh, end of
interview!" Big deal, you know,
at least I told the truth. So I want

some housing and money, who
doesn't? She didn't understand
and cut me right there.
And even if you pass these first
interviews, you have to play
Avon lady for the second part,
