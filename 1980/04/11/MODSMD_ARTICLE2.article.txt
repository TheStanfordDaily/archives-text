The two slates running for ASSU
Council of Presidents met last night in a
KZSU-sponsored debate in Branner
Lounge.
Speaking for the slate composed of
John Lamb. Barb Mullin, Shelley
McKinney and Dave Jaffe, Lamb said
"Our slate sees student government as
being too distant and removed from the
students. One of our priorities would
be to get students involved: a liaison
position between the students and the
COP would be created, we would per
sonally get out to talk to people, and we
would publish an article in the Daily
informing students about issues of im
portance."
But Marc Ventresca. of the Dick
Butterfield-Dayna Goldfine-Nancy
Takahashi-Marc Ventresca slate, said
his group proposes a clearinghouse and
communication center to serve as a
network to coordinate resources and
direct students.
Butterfield added, "We are going to
make sure that students have a voice.
We have the resources and can start
projects. We can get things done."
Lamb pledged to establish a busing
service to provide students with buses
and transportation to football games
and beach trips, making it "safer for
people to party."
Takahashi presented a series of im
portant issues she said concern her
slate. These were residential educa
tion, the effectiveness of the ASSU,
graduate affairs, students services,
academic affairs and Tresidder Union.
Her slate advanced several specific
plans, including the establishment of an
off-campus student center for students
to gather, the opening of a household
items exchange program, a student
lobby center in Sacramento and the
furtherance of the ASSU consumer af
fairs bureau.

The Jaffe slate stressed a need for a
"united student voice" in getting stu
dent ideas and input into the system,
while Butterfield and his co-candidates
emphasized their diversity and ability
to represent different opinions com
mitment and enthusiasm as one of their
qualifications for the office.
Both slates agreed on the important
need for increasing student involve
ment and awareness of ASSU prog
rams and resources.
McKinney suggested that the COP
should be instrumental in choosing the
new president, keeping open lines of
communication with the students and
expanding recruitment efforts for
minority graduate students.
Similarly, the Ventresca slate advo
cated that more attention be directed
into minority issues, especially those
pertaining to the Third World. They
also said that by directing more atten
tion to graduate affairs, they could re
duce the isolation of graduate students
from the rest of the community and
integrate the families of graduate stu
dents into the community.
Both slates announced that they
supported the development of a wo
men's study program.
When questioned about striking a
balance between the workloads in the
humanities and engineering/science re
lated classes, Butterfield responded
thai his concern is that pre-med. en
gineering and science studnets be "di
versified and humane."
"The sciences have linear progres
sion in terms of class requirements
whereas there is more leeway in the
humanities," Butterfield said.
McKinney suggested that a proposal
be presented to the Faculty Senate to
tighten academic requirements.
Goldfine said that the Western Cul
ture requirement is a step towards
achieving this balance.
