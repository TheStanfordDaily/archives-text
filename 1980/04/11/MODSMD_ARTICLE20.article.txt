## Life sans Dupie 
### 
After a lifetime spent study
ing mankind. I have come to
the conclusion that it is evolv
ing into two distinct species —
those who work best in the
morning, and those who are
more at home in the evening. In
this respect I believe Nature is
anticipating that future time
when one will only be expected
to work half the day, and is en
suring in its own devious way
that there will also be an alert
work force available for both the
early and late shifts.
I myself am scarcely alive be
fore midday. Understand that
here I speak metaphorically,
since my body reluctantly con
tinues to satisfy those minimum
requirements for life: I eat, re
spire, excrete and reproduce
(Well, I would if I got the
chance). Where I differ from
common man is that I have a
complete absence of higher
brain functions, and am quite
bereft of those emotions like
love, compassion and social
conscience that are supposed to
make a person endearing.
On the whole, being bom an
evening person is a bad break
for prospective students, for
nearly all classes seem to be
scheduled about 9 or 10
in the morning. Such is
our lot that we are forced to

suffer through hours of unin
teresting early lectures, occa
sionally being goaded into life
by alert, cheerful, unbearable
morning people who are rarely
discouraged by monosyllabic
replies or, for that matter, no
reply at all.
At times like these I give
thanks for Dupie, without
whom Quantum Mechanics
230 would have been impossi
ble. I linger indulgently over
every box of the cartoon strip,
and suddenly the whole world
assumes a new, happier
perspective. Remember the in
timidating sunglasses,
surfboard, the nerd open
season and the Madigan scale
of inebriation? (I always felt
that a six-pack was over rep
resented on the latter.)
Yet Dupie will not be ap
pearing anymore this quarter. I
don't blame Gil Morales for
selling out to a better offer, but
can't he still spare a strip for the
Daily now and then . . . once a
week? . . . once a month?
Perhaps we could see the old
cartoons again?
Life without Dupie is un
thinkable ... if he really must
go,I advise everyone to avoid
me before noon.
