## Senior Class presidential slates Coleman/Halper/Kemmeries/Reilly Time to frolic on the farm 
### 
Life on the "Farm" can get
pretty tough. Sometimes you
get assigned too many chores,
other times you miss not hav
ing someone to cuddle up
with in the hayloft. Hey, listen
Jethro and Lulubell, it's time
to do a little "frolicking on the
Farm."
But lets whoa for a minute
and take a serious look at
some things. With six slates
running, there's going to be a
lot of manure flying around.
What should you look for in
choosing a slate?
1. The Slate's Proposals:
Ask yourself if the slate has
concrete proposals, or is it
merely naming oft activities
and events.
First of all, we believe Class
Communication is crucial —
it determines the success and
involvement of all activities.
Involvement is a key word
and next year's activities will
involve more than a select
group.
Next year we will continue
the newsletter, representative
system and also bring in two
new ideas — a system of
Senior Class Campus Activity
Boards and a Senior Class
Dialing Service.
The activity boards would
be put up in strategic loca
tions so that seniors will know
what events are scheduled
when. The dialing service
would be a number which you
could call at any time to in
form you about everything
the senior class is doing.
Another important part of
our campaign is our Life Out

side the Farm programs. Next
year we will present to you
student forums dealing with
everything from survival
cooking to filing income tax
forms.
The other proposal is our
Senior Aids Community Pro
jects. These projects would
allow interested students to
volunteer in programs at local
hospitals. Pig-herder Kem
meries is currently co
director of the Stanford Chil
drens' Hospital Talent Show.
Yeeehaaaah! Also very
important to us are next
year's Senior Frolics (a lot of
"roll in the hay" action and
getting "plowed"). Besides
the traditional "frolicking" of
Casino Night and the Hallo
ween Party, we will he throw
ing everything from huge
Senior Splashes at deGuerre
to the Senior Sweepstakes at
Malibu Grand Prix. Two big
activities to look at are our
Senior Week (including
Mayhem Day and San Gre
gorio Beach Beerhust Day)
and our Senior Weekend
Outing (a huge ski trip or a
weekend in the Sierras).
How? Easy — get early reser
vations and then highly pub
licize the weekend.
2. The Slate's Homework:
You should also ask yourself
if the slate has done its
"farmwork" ahead of time. so.
that its proposals are in fact
feasible. The Dialing Service
costs $130. We have already
asked people to lead student
forums. It would be an
"empty promise" to guaran

tee graduation speakers this
spring. Farmer's daughter
Coleman has researched this,
and found that the process is
very complex because it in
volves the administration. We
will, of course, ask your pre
ference for both graduation
location and speaker.
3. The Slate's Members:
You should really look
closely at the slate's diversity,
and we believe that our slate
is the only one diverse enough
to reach the entire senior
class. Also look at the mem
bers' experience, and see
whether it is mostly in the in
tellectual or political field, or
if it's in activities that can
truly help them as class presi
dents.
We have this experience —
Plowman Halper is director
of a band-booking agency
that works with Stanford
dorms, fraternities and in fact
this year's senior class, and
Granny Rielly was her class
president before coming to
the Farm. Finally, ask your
self if the slate's members
have the time to work hard for
you. We have that time, and
will honestly and receptively
work hard to give you a fan
tastic senior year.
So Jethro, look up son!
Lulubell. put a smile on that
there face. Itw time to"Frolic
on the Farm!"

science major; /na Coleman is
a communication major;
Jamie Halper is an economics
major, and Mary Ellen Rielly
is an English major.)
