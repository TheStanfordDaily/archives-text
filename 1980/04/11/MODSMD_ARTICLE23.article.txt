# Caras/Feroze/Kersh/Urdan
## See unique, festive year 
### 
Many campaign gimmicks
are a game, and we all know
it. Cute slogans, pictures and
acronyms are all superfluous
to the b sic issues behind a
campaign. The elections for
senior class presidents have
traditionally been inundated
with such tactics. Our cam
paign has been, is, and will
continue to be, a play on this
More importantly, the job
of senior class presidents de
mands a group that is crea
tive, dedicated and represen
tative of the diverse per
sonalities of our senior class,
in addition to one that works
well together.
The slate of Bob Feroze,
Jennifer Urdan, Rhea Caras
and Robert Kersh embodies
these essential qualities. We
represent varied backgrounds

and a wide-range of interests.
Above all, each of us holds a
genuine desire to make our
senior year "unique and fes
tive."
Because "unique and fes
tive" means something diffe
rent to each of us, we believe
it's necessary to present a
broad spectrum of cultural,
educational and simply out
rageous activities.
