## Get 81-derful taste of senior events 
### 
Rushing through the massive noontime
crowd in White Pla/a, intending to finally
get to a spring quarter class on time, I
noticed groups of what appeared to be
Stanford students wearing outrageous yet
creative outfits. Shocked by the sights be
fore my eyes, I decided that my perfect
attendance record should stand for one
more day. In order to determine exactly
what sort of people I was dealing with, I
begand to casually and inconspicuously
meander about the plaza.
I had only reached the Post Office when
suddenly I was tripped. While I sat con
tused and frightened, a person from be
hind me yelled, "Hey, do you mind get
ting off the fishing line!" I'm not exactly
sure what he meant, but I decided to com
ply with his request.
Continuing towards the Bookstore, I
was nearly run over by a Lilliputian trac
tor. Fearing that my life was at stake, I
looked around for a friend, a teacher, a
Dolly, or anyone who would comfort me.
Then 1 saw a tall and rugged football
player so I yelled for help. Before he
came to my rescue, however, I realized he
was only a one dimensional cardboard
statue.
"This can't be happening to me!" I kept

telling myself. I panicked! Remembering
from my LAC (Living with Alien Cul
tures) class to scream in the face of
danger, I turned to my last resort
. . ."SCREAM!! . . .SCREAM!!"
"Yes, we have plenty of it! Come on
over and have some." To my right stood a
group of four people offering me some
thing from within a bucket. I wasn't sure if
they were talking directly to me, so I
waited in silence. One of the four spoke
again. "Hey, you don't have to shout if
you want ice cream, just come on over."
I was attracted by the openness and
friendliness of the group, so I walked to
wards them. They each wore a hat with
their names printed on the band: Eddie
Poplawski, Karen Bloom, Kirk Lawson
and Janet Frohnmayer. Beside their stand
stood a sign reading "81 -DERFUL offers
you a taste of what's to come: 1981 senior
class presidents."
112 inally, I found the explanation for the
bizarre events which I had seen earlier;
students were campaigning for senior
class presidents. Intrigued by the en
thusiasm and creativity of 81-DERFUL's
slate. I decided to stay and listen to what
then had to say.
I was amazed with the abundance of

social fanfare that 81-DERFUL has
planned. In addition to continuing the
senior traditions that I don't want to miss
such as Happy Hours at Zot's, they've got
some terrific new ideas (such as a senior
spring break in Mazatlan and a fundrais
ing Dance-a-thon in the Quad for char
ity).
What impressed me even more was
81-DERFUL's concern to keep all
seniors involved with and aware of events
going on, to make our last year the
greatest yet. With their Senior Hot-Line,
it'll be easy to find out exactly what's
going on wi th the senior class, as well as to
contribute suggestions or comments.
They also propose a Stanford's Greats lec
ture series, so I can hear all those profes
sors talk informally about subjects I've
missed out on.
It wouldn't be fair to continue; to find
out all of the other great ideas that Eddie,
Karen, Kirk and Janet have planned,
you II have to stop by White Plaza for
yourselves. But there's no doubt in my
mind that next year will be 81-DERFUL!

telling myself. I panicked! Remembering
from my LAC (Living with Alien Cul
tures) class to scream in the face of
danger, I turned to my last resort
. . ."SCREAM!! . . .SCREAM!!"
"Yes, we have plenty of it! Come on
over and have some." To my right stood a
group of four people offering me some
thing from within a bucket. I wasn't sure if
they were talking directly to me, so I
waited in silence. One of the four spoke
again. "Hey, you don't have to shout if
you want ice cream, just come on over."
I was attracted by the openness and
friendliness of the group, so I walked to
wards them. They each wore a hat with
their names printed on the band: Eddie
Poplawski, Karen Bloom, Kirk Lawson
and Janet Frohnmayer. Beside their stand
stood a sign reading "81 -DERFUL offers
you a taste of what's to come: 1981 senior
class presidents."
112 inally, I found the explanation for the
bizarre events which I had seen earlier;
students were campaigning for senior
class presidents. Intrigued by the en
thusiasm and creativity of 81-DERFUL's
slate. I decided to stay and listen to what
then had to say.
I was amazed with the abundance of

social fanfare that 81-DERFUL has
planned. In addition to continuing the
senior traditions that I don't want to miss
such as Happy Hours at Zot's, they've got
some terrific new ideas (such as a senior
spring break in Mazatlan and a fundrais
ing Dance-a-thon in the Quad for char
ity).
What impressed me even more was
81-DERFUL's concern to keep all
seniors involved with and aware of events
going on, to make our last year the
greatest yet. With their Senior Hot-Line,
it'll be easy to find out exactly what's
going on wi th the senior class, as well as to
contribute suggestions or comments.
They also propose a Stanford's Greats lec
ture series, so I can hear all those profes
sors talk informally about subjects I've
missed out on.
It wouldn't be fair to continue; to find
out all of the other great ideas that Eddie,
Karen, Kirk and Janet have planned,
you II have to stop by White Plaza for
yourselves. But there's no doubt in my
mind that next year will be 81-DERFUL!
