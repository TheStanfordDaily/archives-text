## BARB: not just handing you a line 
### 
BARB: a slate comprised
of four distinct individuals,
working together to offer the
class of 'HI both the experi
ence and enthusiasm neces
sary to assure quality and
quantity from September to
June next year.
As current chair of the
ASSU Senate, Mark has had
tremendous personal expo
sure to the University ad
ministration facilitating a val
uable accessibility that can
only benefit the class. As a
Daily reporter and columnist,
Aleen has created a viable
network with both University
personnel and students in
leadership positions all over
campus. Renee's dynamic ta
lent ranges from theatrical
and vocal performance to her
participation in the senate as
a member of the Finance
Committee, a position offer
ing interaction with almost
every campus organization.
Jeff has experience packing a
social calendar through rush
chairmanship and his former
musical affiliations and cu
rent role in 'Superstar' span
the spectrum of entertain
ment, a crucial perspective
for any group attempting to
organize appealing events.
Practice makes perfect, and
our combined practice in
cludes working at the Alumni
Association, CPPC,
Academic Information
Center, Residential Educa
tion (RA), the Greek system
and on University commit
tees. We know what to expect
and are anxious for the chal
lenge. We know the Univer
sity: it's politics, people and
problems. Add this experi
ence to a genuine attitude

promoting receptivity toward
innovative ideas and you have
our basic spirit: We can tackle
anything.
Our decision to run for the
office of senior class presi
dents was based on the con
cept of teamwork. We func
tion as a team and we're ready
to work! We want to encour
age your never-been-done
before ideas worthy of the
creative implementation we
are committed to. We want to
emphasize that we define
election, as representation;
yours! If you're getting nerv
ous about the transition from
the "Farm" to the "Cities,"
don't panic. "Outreach 81"
will settle your nerves.
For your weekly enter
tainment, we've designed a

lecture series that will make
the road to success so much
smoother. Topics from "How
to Finance your C'ondo," to
"Tips from a Psychic" will be
spiced with career hints from
the CPPC in a dazzling Senior
Newsletter. Then, catch the
Rookie Alum Hour, your
chance to chat with a recent
grad who can share the reality
beyond Palm Drive.
For those who are comp
laining that Stanford is too
sheltered, we've developed
Timesharing, a community
service program placing
seniors in volunteer posi
tions: you pledge an hour,
we'll tie up the red tape.
Experience doesn't mean
repetition, however, when
we're talking old hats tradi

tion: How 'bout a Black Tie
Nite at the "O," A Boat
Cruise to Alcatraz, or an af
ternoon of decadence at the
Greek Gorgy? There'll he
plenty of riotous rendevous
with an array of appetizing
and thrillseeking ways to
spend your weeks with the
Class of '81. Our thumbs
were made for tapping, our
past promises action — out
rageous action to assure
you'll rally with frenzied hys
teria all year long.
BARB. We're not just
handing you a line.
