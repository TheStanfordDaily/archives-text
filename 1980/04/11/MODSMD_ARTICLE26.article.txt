## Act as party initiators 
### 
The issues we would face as
senior class presidents
would he related to social ac
tivities and not political ones.
With this in mind, we see our
role in office as one of party
initiator and organizer.
Our slate would continue
the traditional parties such as
the Halloween party, Mid
night Quad parties, and
Casino night but would add a
flair of our own to the job.
Hi is would take the form of A
Day at the Races, A Cruise on
the Bay, and discounts for
seniors on other activities. Of
course, all these ideas are not
without cost.
Working within the limited

budget the senior class has at
its disposal would be a prim
ary consideration. With the
addition of fundraising, in
many different forms, the
budget could be stretched
much farther to include many
more activities than in the
past.
Another goal of the slate is
to get as many seniors as pos
sible involved in the activities.
The culmination of a Stanford
career should be one of ex
citement, celebration, and
should include some sense of
unity throughout the class.
Only through the involve
ment of many seniors can this

be accomplished.
We are candidates for the
position because we feel we
could help many people have
a totally excellent time their
senior year. Through mass in
volvement, innovative par
ties, and an expanded budget,
we could accomplish that
goal. Incidentally, we feel it is
important to curb inflation
and free the hostages.
