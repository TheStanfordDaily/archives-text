Support GSA
A fee assessment for the Stan
ford Graduate Students Associa
tion (GSA) will appear on the
ballot in the upcoming student
election. If you believe in the
very essence of the Stanford ex
perience, show your support for
the GSA by voting yes on this
request for funding.
The GSA attempts (against
great odds) to simply "promote
the welfare of the Stanford
graduate students." Only 19
percent of single graduate stu
dents live on campus versus 80
percent of undergraduates, so
graduate students do not have
the social and interactive be
nefits of the residential system.
Also the graduate schools arc ex
tremely department oriented.
Thus the GSA assumes the
very difficult role of serving as an
umbrella organization to en
courage and support interaction
between graduate students,
attempting as well to involve un
dergraduates.
The GSA sponsors both social
and academic activities, funding
projects which are organized by
the association itself as well as
those of special interest groups
who could not obtain funding
otherwise. In addition, the GSA
functions to represent and pro
tect the interests, whether social,
academic, housing or financial of
graduate students. Its member
ship includes all graduate stu
dents and undergraduates over
25.
A fee assessment is the only
source of funding available to the
GSA, other than by charging
admission to sponsored events
(obviously not a popular or very
realistic approach). The Univer
sity itself does not contribute any
money to the GSA.

The GSA truly functions to
benefit the Stanford community
as a whole, both undergraduates
and graduates, whether these ef
fects are direct to indirect. Show
your support by voting yes!

Pass Senate bill
The ASSU Senate recently
placed on the spring ballot a mat
ter of perennial ASSU concern:
that of ASSU Senate election re
form.
Stanford students will be vot
ing thumbs-up or thumbs-down
on a proposal that has arisen out
of several months of committee
works and at least two meetings
of Senate debate. The final
proposal is simple: 1) ASSU Se
nate elections are to be held in
the spring (fall election is to be
eliminated); and 2) 10 non
voting "Senate Associate" spots
are to be reserved for new stu
dents in the fall. (New students
will be able to apply to the ASSU
Nominations Committee.)
In addition, the proposal has
an implementation clause that
would bring about a Senate elec
tion this spring, three weeksafter
the April 15 and 16 election.
ASSU Senates suffer yearly
from: 1) lack of continuity from
Senate to Senate; and 2) a six
month term-of-office (winter/
which prevents effective
coordination with other ASSU
officers, organizations and pro
jects.
Spring elections would addi
tionally save students the cost
(over $1500) of fall elections,
allow orientation of the new Se
nate in the spring by the old Se
nate, and eliminate the current

structure in which a Senate's first
duty is to ratify its own election.
(With spring elections, the Se
nate currently in office would ad
judicate over the election of its
successor.)
The election reform proposal
reserves for new students 10 Se
nate Associate spots, four of
which must be filled by frosh or
transfers, and four by new
graduate students. Senate As
sociates do not have voting rights
at Senate meetings since the in
dividuals were selected by com
mittee, not elected by the stu
dent body at large, but they
otherwise have full Senate pow
ers of voting in committees,
speaking on the floor, sponsor
ing legislation, etc. New student
participation under the prop
osed systeffi should thus be mar
kedly improved.
The one hesitation with spring
elections has to do with graduate
students. Will graduates in struc
tured two- to three-year prog
rams be willing to run for Senate
in the spring of one year and then
be willing to serve the following
year?
The answer cannot be fully as
certained at present. This year's
Senate has been fortunate in
housing a five-person Medical
School slate and several excel
lent other graduate Senators, but
the track record, again, is not a
good one.
On behalf of this year's Se
nate, 1 thus urge you to vote for
Senate election reform.

Activity intimidates
I am in complete agreement
with the central thrust of Steve
Kaye and David Mondavi's re
cent column (Daily, Apr. 8) con
cerning the arrest of homosexu

als in Stanford restrooms. Indi
viduals that feel the need to con
gregate in public bathrooms to
achieve sexual satisfaction are to
be pitied. Prosecution of these
individuals is pointless and of po
tentially negative societal im
pact.
The fact of the matter remains
however, that it is intimidating to
say the least for a heterosexual
student to enter a bathroom in
which homosexual activity is oc
curring. As a straight student 1
am in complete sympathy with
those individuals that registered
complaints with the University.
It is not, in my opinion, sufficient
to imply that homosexual activ
ity should be tolerated in Stan
ford's public restrooms because
the individuals engaged in said
activities are "victims of soci
ety."
It is extremely unfortunate
that the University chose the
course it did in dealing with this
problem. It would have been
equally unfortunate however,
had the problem not been dealt
with at all.

Draft objectors
In his column (Daily, April 4),
Jeff Lepape discussed the con
scientious objector question as
though there is some intelligent
and fair way for local draft
boards to select conscientious
objectors (COs). Unfortunately,
there is not. There is simply no
way that board members can tell
what is inside of someone's head.
I personally have seen many
well-documented cases where
young men were denied CO
status. During the Vietnam War,
the applicant rolled the dice and
had about one chance in three or

four of being classified as a CO.
Some draft boards bragged that
they had never granted a CO ap
plication! With the pressures on
the boards to produce draftees
and the typical American Legion
mentality of board members, it is
easy to see why such conditions
exist.
There have been some rumbl
ings at Selective Service head
quarters suggesting that CO reg
ulations be tightened because of
a fear that there will be too many
applicants during the "next"
draft.
Those of us who have watched
Selective Service over the years
do not expect fairness from the
system. That is one reason why
we urge Lepape and others to
write or phone President Jimmy
Carter or their elected represen
tatives, asking them to oppose
draft registration at this time.

National Council to Repeal the

Union gives a voice
In the Daily of March 3, Dr
Michael Eliastam cites a ver,
common, and very unfounded,
fear of worker unionization. He
says unionization "would sig
nificantly change the relation
ship between supervisors and
secretaries."
If he means that a union will
give clerical workers a say in
their working conditions, a
means to express concerns to
their supervisor without retribu
tion, procedures that will protect
hem from unfair decisions, and
more equal footing with the boss,
he's right. It he means that it will
"tighten up" conditions on the
|ob, he's quite wrong.
' was working at the University

before the union was here and
I've worked here for six years
since the union negotiated its
first contract. I like it better with
a union!
My boss. Dr. Peter Wood, is
the greatest; no one could work
for a nicer guy. The union hasn't
changed our relationship.
So, all you workers, there is
nothing to fear but fear itself! All
the union seeks to do is guaran
tee you a voice in the decisions
that affect you on the job. Until
you have that voice — collec
tively in a union — you will never
see consistent annual increases
that keep up with the cost of liv
ing, improved benefits or a fair
grievance procedure.
As community organizer Saul
Alinsky said, "People don't get
opportunity or freedom or equal
ity or dignity as an act of charity
— you need organization to
make the other side deliver."

Bike safety thanks
We would like to take a few
lines to thank the many groups
and individuals who generously
donated time, supplies and sup
port toward the success of the
senate Bike Safety Week i
quarter.
Notable among these con
tributors were the Stanford
Bookstore — which wholehear
tedly backed our endeavor with
merchandise, patience, and the
loan of talents and equipment —
and the Campus Bike Shop.
Members of Circle K provided
vital hours of staffing and public
ity help, as did the IPC and ISC.
The California Automobile As
sociation and the campus police
gave us pamphlets and leaflets

(including the infamous Sprocket
Man comic book), and Tresidder
Union Recreation Center — in
the person of Greg Larson —
gave advice, as well as help with
registration. Weekly bike regist
ration continues every Tuesday
at the Recreation Center from 2
to 4 p.m.
We would also like to acknow
ledge the information given by
Hal Wilson, long-time member
of the Bike Safety Administra
tion Panel; this group has been
working for many years to lessen
the problems and hazards as
sociated with biking on campus.
These hazards remain unre
solved, however, and they will
intensify during the spring as
more people begin to bike again.
Be aware of the other bikers and
pedestrians. Equip your bike
with the proper lights and reflec
tors. Observe simple courtesies
and rules of the road.
Thanks again to everyone who
helped out with the program. We
appreciate your involvement.

Tree mislabeled
A recent nrticio in t ;
("Plants that g: >i! d
vcred," Apr. 2) was misleading
First, the tree that produces a
resin similar to diesel fuel is
Copaifera langsdorfii, not
Euphorbia cobaifera langsdorfii.
Second, Melvin Calvin concedes
that Copaifera langsdorfii "will
probably never represent a sig
nificant source of diesel fuel for
the U.S." (Scienct, Oct.
1976).
