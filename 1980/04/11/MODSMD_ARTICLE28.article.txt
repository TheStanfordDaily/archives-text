# The 						housing draw grabs students
## 
### Hillary Hall Staff Writer 
In the next few weeks, students seeking
on-campus housing for the 1980-8 1
academic year will ritualistically perform the
motions of the Undergraduate Spring Hous
ing Draw. Each will try to insert some per
sonal significance into the procedural
perplexities of priorities, guarantees, draw
cards and, of course, numbers.
The 1980-81 Draw Book lists important
dates, general and specific information re
garding houses, dorms and priorities, and
explains the basic mechanics ot participating
in the draw. In this publication, the Office of
Residential Education encourages all stu
dents who want to live on campus beginning
next autumn to join the draw. Students seek
ing housing during the winter or spring quar
ters but not during autumn should not enter
the draw but instead should join the waiting
list, preferably before June 6.
I o enter the draw, students should pick up
their draw materials April 9 to 18, either
from the Single Student Housing Office or
from their current residence. They should
then obtain priorities from houses with spe
cial requirements needed tor assignment to
that residence, complete their draw cards
and return them April 15 and 18. At this time
they will draw their numbers.
Round-one results will be posted in early
May, after which a student may either accept
Ins or her assignment or try to improve it in
round two. All students must enter round
two in order to be eligible lor on-campus
housing next tall. Round-two draw cards
must be submitted no later than three work
ing days after round-one results are posted.
Results from the second round of assign
ments will be available in early June. If a
student decides not to accept his round-two
assignment, a $10 administrative fee will be

charged.
There are basically two steps involved in
assigning students to on-campus residences,
l irst, students are considered for assignment
on the basis of their guarantee status and
their draw numbers (0001 being the best and
5000 the worst). Those students eligible for
assignment are placed in the "assignable
group." A student with a low draw number
who is guaranteed for the 1980-8 I academic
year will be placed in the "assignable group"
before a guaranteed student with a high
number, and both will precede a non
guaranteed student with a low number.
Individual priorities and choices are not
taken into account until the second step of
the assignment process, when a student is
assigned to his highest choice allowed by his
priority and draw number.
The Draw Book also explains the ways
that guaranteed standing and priorities affect
a student's chance of being placed in an on
campus residence. A guaranteed student
who participates in both rounds of the draw
and who is willing to accept any space in the
housing system is assured of housing. An
unguaranteed student is unlikely to be as
signed in round one and is likely to be equally
successful in round two.
Priorities have no effect on a student's,
placement in the "assignable group." They
affect only the specific assignment of those
within the "assignable group." There are
three kinds of priorities: those extended by
houses with a special theme or common
characteristic, ethnic priorities and returning
resident priority.
Students interested in theme or special in
terest houses are encouraged to seek
priorities in those residences in order to im
prove the chance of being assigned there.
Ethnic priorities are extended by residences
whose cross-cultural programs particularly

emphasize an ethnic element in the house
(this category includes Casa Zapata, Okada
and Ujamaa). Returning resident priority is
also available to non-freshmen who will he
guaranteed in 1980-81.
Hie returning resident priority as well as
the eating-associate priority was re
evaluated earlier in the year by the Commit
tee on Services to Students/Residences
(COSS/R). As a result, non-guaranteed stu
dents will no longer receive returning resi
dence priority, and no eating associate prior
ity will exist.
Asst. Dean of Residential Education
Roger Whitney also pointed out that special
priorities will be available only during spring
quarter and only until June 6 — a change
from last year, when priorities could be
handed out at any time throughout the
academic year. This change is related to the
abolition of the eating-associate priority,
Whitney commented, "in that they both are
an attempt to make the same priorities avail
able to all students."
In the past, eating associates were given
the highest priority below that of returning
residents, and as a result students required to
purchase University meal plans were dis
criminated against. Consequently, COSS/R
and the Office of Residential Education de
cided to eradicate the eating-associate prior
ity in the interest of objectivity.
Another important change in the housing
system next year will be the transformation
of Arroyo House, now a freshman dorm, in
the Wilbur Complex into a four-class dorm
and of Otero, a four-class dorm also in Wil
bur, into a freshman dorm. This change,
Whitney said, "is meant to create a link bet
ween two freshmen dorms — Otero and Rin
conada — as an experiment in joint pro
gramming."
