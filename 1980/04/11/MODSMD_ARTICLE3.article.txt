## 
### Jane West Staff writer 
The new president of the United
Stanford Employees, Daniel Ib
risimovic, was elected Tuesday by al
most a two to one margin. Ibrisimovic
defeated Daniel Manley-Arrieta 322
to 172, with several votes going to
write-ins.
Ibrisimovic, the principal linear ac
celerator operator at SLAC, said he
was pleased by the voter turnout. "The
bargaining unit contains about 14(H)
members. Last year it was an important
election because the contract was com
ing up. There were 300 ballots. This
year with the contract settled there

were over 500. Credit should be given
to the people of USE who showed in
terest in the election." said Ibrisimovic.
Manley-Arrieta. an electrician ap
prentice, could not be reached for
comment.
The previous union general manager
David Novogrodsky and union presi
dent Mike Harris both resigned Jan. 15
when members objected to what they
considered Novogrodsky's railroading
of last summer's contract. They
charged he misrepresented the terms of
the contract to ensure ratification.
Novogrodsky was replaced by Mike
Baratz, an administrator of the local
715, who is still acting as an interim
replacement until July 1 ."At that time,
I will either stay on as the executive
officer if USE becomes affiliated with
the local 715 or someone from the out
side will probably be found," said
Baratz.
Ibrisimovic realizes the union has
had problems in the past but feels they
are quickly disappearing.
"People voted for me because they
know me. I have been active in the
union since the very beginning," said
Ibrisimovic, who has been working in
linear accelerator operations at the
University for 20 years.
