# ON CALL

### 
Surprise, surprise. On Call was not swept out
to sea on a wayward surfboard o\er spring
break. It's alive and. well, maybe not quite as
healthy as the advice it contains. My apologies
for last week's complete omission, but my re
spite was intoxicating, and I had a nunor dead
line problem — like missing it by a week
Changing calendars can be confusing.
Any way, spring is in the air. along with a few
other little visitors we can discover together
\\ hat is hay fever, ami what can he done about
it? I've been sneezing for a solid month.
- All Blow n (hit
Dear Sniffles.
Hay lever is usually an allergic response to
pollens, which invade the air waves during the
budding process of spring, according to Dr.
John Dorman at C'owell. Sometimes the condi
tion can be aggravated by exposure to animal
tur as well.
The best treatment is. logically, to avoid the
cause of the symptoms. Since that is often im
possible. the next solution lies in over-the
counter antihistamines. Should that not work,
you should obtain an prescription after consul
tation with a doctor at Cowell. There is no best
drug for everyone. Dorman said, so the whole
process involves trial and error, particularly
concerning the main side effect of these com
batants — drowsiness.
If no drugs allay your sneezing bouts, you
might have to see an allergist at the Palo Alto
Medical Clinic, possibly for skin testing and the
like. Such an event would, however, be ex
tremely rare, according to Dorman.
for those of you w ho suffered under the mer
ciless beating of the sun over break, read on.
What is the best cure for sunburn? I burn i cry
easily and am afraid of increasing my chances of
contracting skiti cancer.
- Lobster Red
Dear Comrade at Arms.
"Time." replied Dr. Dorman to your ques
tion. If the burn is very severe, you could use
cortisone cream or injections. Ice is often help
ful in alleviating the pain associated with sun
burn. too.
To protect yourself from future sun irritation,
the best sunscreen is one which includes PABA
as an ingredient. PABA will block out the ul
traviolet rays of the sun.
It you were exposed to continuous sun over
the extent of your lifetime, you would face an
increased risk of skin cancer. Dorman said.
Farmers, for example, are prime candidates for
skin cancer. The likelihood of obtaining skin
cancer from sun exposure during your brief stint
at this Farm is indeed small.

/•> it healthy to swim in Lake Lagunita?
- Water Rat
Dear Willard,
Increasingly, over the summer, it will become
less healthy to take a dip in the lake, according
to Dr. Dorman. You should be particularly
careful if. for example, you fall off your
windsurfing board, cut yourself in the process,
and. in your shock, gulp down mouthfuls of lake
water. The lake is not a health hazard, but you
should take more care than you otherwise
would it ,i cut becomes infected after swimming
in the lake.
Here's a question for you who prefer to test
your natatorial skills in a man-made, artificially
maintained, concrete pool, rather than in na
ture's watering holes.
What car problems are related to pool swim
ming?
-Lapper
Dear Chlorine-lover.
Frequent swimmers often come down with a
condition known as •'Swimmer's ear." Swim
mers ear is an external ear infection, to which
some people seem to be particularly prone. To
avoid it. swimmers should dry their ears well. A
drop of alcohol in the ear after swimming will
protect those usually afflicted by mild cases.
Should the case be worse, antibioics and cor
tisone may be used to remedy the condition.
Scuba divers may face more severe ear prob
lems as they experience difficulty upon equaliz
ing pressure in the middle ear upon ascent or
descent Patients with sev ere difficulties should
be checked by a doctor.
On the subject of ears:
How dangerous is Rock n Roll ear? Does ring
ing indicate permanent hearing loss or damage. ?
- Stone
Dear Sly.
On a one-shot basis, according to Dr. Dor
man. the phenomena you describe is not harm
ful. While sitting directly in front of the
amplifiers at a loud rock concert may not be
aesthetically pleasing and may even be painful,
the result of one ringing jolt is not permanently
injurious. Dorman said. I'd like to hear it you
know otherwise. Recurrent exposure to loud
music is potentially damaging on a permanent
basis. I'll try to provide you with some specifics
on this topic next week.
