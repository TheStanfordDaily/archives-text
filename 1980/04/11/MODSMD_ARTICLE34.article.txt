# EST takes over entire Calif. town
## 
### Tom Murphy The Associated Press 
PARLIER — Like most social
experiments, it started with a
question: Could the new age of
philosophy of Werner Erhard's
est significantly alter the future
of an entire town?
Almost two years later, most
residents of this San Joaquin Val
ley Community would agree that
est changed their city, although
not all would agree the change
\\ as for the better. Some say est is
"dangerous" or "something
from the devil."
Mention of est here brings on
memories of a controversy that
turned neighbor against
neighbor in what has been de
scribed as "a miniature civil
war."
But for Erhard, the "Parlier
experiment" was a success.
Erhard says the est corporation,
which grossed $20.5 million in
1979, used its Parlier experience
in expanding its training to rural
areas throughout the world.
Learning
"We learned a lot more from
the people of Parlier than they
learned from us," says Erhard.
Parlier. the "Buckle of the
Raisin Belt." is a struggling ag
ricultural community. The
names of its 3000 citizens fill less
than three pages in the county
phone directory.
Some 90 percent of Parlier's
residents are Mexican-
Americans, and most attend
Mass each Sunday at Our Lady
of Sorrows, the town's Roman
Catholic Church.
Free training
In May, 1978, est officials of
fered to train the entire city of
Parlier free. On the recommen
dation of two city officials who
had taken the training, the city
council accepted, but never for
mally endorsed the program.
The council hoped est, which
purports to teach participants to
live fuller lives by taking charge
of their surroundings, could
bring new hope to Parlier.
About 170 residents signed up
for the training. After the first of
four. 15-hour sessions, only 130
remained. About 100 completed
all four sessions and, of those,
only about 50 were from Parlier.
Many of the dropouts com
plained of "obscene" language
used in the training. They said

the language was inappropriate
in a traditional, religious com
munity like Parlier.
Erhard now agrees. He says
that, while foul language is
commonly used in est training, it
was mistakenly stressed in Par
lier because the trainer thought
the citizens had problems deal
ing with it.
After the dropouts reported
the language to their neighbors,
the city became divided between
those for est and those against it.
The clash continued until the city
council stated the question of
est's success in Parlier "can only
be answered with time it
self."
Uncertainty
A short while later. Mayor
Andrew Benites, one of the orig
inal proponents of est in Parlier,
resigned from office. He said his
resignation had nothing to do
with est.
He was replaced by Raul Mar
tinez, another est grad who now
thinks he might have made a mis
take by initially supporting the
program.
"It seems to work really well
on middle class people, mostly
Anglos," he says."I haven't seen
it work too well on Mexican-
Americans.
"The bottom line is I think est
is dangerous. The trainer is not
equipped to handle what is hap
pening in the session. The train
ing can get out of hand," he says.

Ginger Cantano — whose
brother. Councilman Anthony
Alvarez, also took the training —
helped to organize those against
est. She has been quoted as say
ing est is "something from the
devil."
"I view it as another cult idea.
1 feel that any person who's re
ally involved in est is not their
own person," she says. "They
quote Erhard as their own Rev.
Moon."
Former city manager Dan
Ayala, the other city official who
recommended the program in
Parlier, regrets the controversy.
"If they (Parlier residents)
were to apply the energy applied
to the controversy to other
things, 1 think they could have
accomplished some major
things," he says.
Ayala recently resigned, but
says his decision had nothing to
do with est.
Other side
Not all think est was "bad" for
Parlier. Police Chief Joe Anaya
and Ruth Banuelos, both est
grads, think the community
overreacted. Anaya doesn't
think est had any lasting effect in
the community, but neither does
he think Parlier ever really
needed the training.
The Rev. Daniel Lopez, pas
tor of Our Lady of Sorrows, was
drawn into the controversy when
spiritual issues were raised. He
says the citizens reacted strongly

because they didn't know that est
was "trying to shock them into
something.
"At the time, I was a little con
cerned about the tensions it (est)
caused in the community," he
says."It polarized people. I was
a little contused about it myself,
l ong run
"But in the long run, maybe it
was good for the community. It
caused people to think about
programs like this," he says.
Hie Rev. Gerry O'Rourke, a
Mill Valley priest who helps or
ganize group trainings for est,
suggests Parlier residents be
lieved "their faith may be rob
bed."
Erhard says the training prob
ably served some good in Parlier,
if only to "stir the people up."
Attorney Paul Morantz, a
noted critic of so-called cults,
disagrees. He defines the Parlier
experiment as "an attempt to use
the tools of coercive persuasion
on an entire community.
"The whole thing I saw there
scared me," says Morantz. "It
really was one of the scarier
things I've ever seen."
In a footnote on the experi
ment. est officials point out that
Parlier citizens are still eligible
for a scholarship that brings the
training's cost down from $350
to just $50. They estimate that
60 residents have taken advan
tage of the offer since the con
troversy began.

Parlier. the "Buckle of the
Raisin Belt." is a struggling ag
ricultural community. The
names of its 3000 citizens fill less
than three pages in the county
phone directory.
Some 90 percent of Parlier's
residents are Mexican-
Americans, and most attend
Mass each Sunday at Our Lady
of Sorrows, the town's Roman
Catholic Church.
Free training
In May, 1978, est officials of
fered to train the entire city of
Parlier free. On the recommen
dation of two city officials who
had taken the training, the city
council accepted, but never for
mally endorsed the program.
The council hoped est, which
purports to teach participants to
live fuller lives by taking charge
of their surroundings, could
bring new hope to Parlier.
About 170 residents signed up
for the training. After the first of
four. 15-hour sessions, only 130
remained. About 100 completed
all four sessions and, of those,
only about 50 were from Parlier.
Many of the dropouts com
plained of "obscene" language
used in the training. They said

the language was inappropriate
in a traditional, religious com
munity like Parlier.
Erhard now agrees. He says
that, while foul language is
commonly used in est training, it
was mistakenly stressed in Par
lier because the trainer thought
the citizens had problems deal
ing with it.
After the dropouts reported
the language to their neighbors,
the city became divided between
those for est and those against it.
The clash continued until the city
council stated the question of
est's success in Parlier "can only
be answered with time it
self."
Uncertainty
A short while later. Mayor
Andrew Benites, one of the orig
inal proponents of est in Parlier,
resigned from office. He said his
resignation had nothing to do
with est.
He was replaced by Raul Mar
tinez, another est grad who now
thinks he might have made a mis
take by initially supporting the
program.
"It seems to work really well
on middle class people, mostly
Anglos," he says."I haven't seen
it work too well on Mexican-
Americans.
"The bottom line is I think est
is dangerous. The trainer is not
equipped to handle what is hap
pening in the session. The train
ing can get out of hand," he says.

Ginger Cantano — whose
brother. Councilman Anthony
Alvarez, also took the training —
helped to organize those against
est. She has been quoted as say
ing est is "something from the
devil."
"I view it as another cult idea.
1 feel that any person who's re
ally involved in est is not their
own person," she says. "They
quote Erhard as their own Rev.
Moon."
Former city manager Dan
Ayala, the other city official who
recommended the program in
Parlier, regrets the controversy.
"If they (Parlier residents)
were to apply the energy applied
to the controversy to other
things, 1 think they could have
accomplished some major
things," he says.
Ayala recently resigned, but
says his decision had nothing to
do with est.
Other side
Not all think est was "bad" for
Parlier. Police Chief Joe Anaya
and Ruth Banuelos, both est
grads, think the community
overreacted. Anaya doesn't
think est had any lasting effect in
the community, but neither does
he think Parlier ever really
needed the training.
The Rev. Daniel Lopez, pas
tor of Our Lady of Sorrows, was
drawn into the controversy when
spiritual issues were raised. He
says the citizens reacted strongly

because they didn't know that est
was "trying to shock them into
something.
"At the time, I was a little con
cerned about the tensions it (est)
caused in the community," he
says."It polarized people. I was
a little contused about it myself,
l ong run
"But in the long run, maybe it
was good for the community. It
caused people to think about
programs like this," he says.
Hie Rev. Gerry O'Rourke, a
Mill Valley priest who helps or
ganize group trainings for est,
suggests Parlier residents be
lieved "their faith may be rob
bed."
Erhard says the training prob
ably served some good in Parlier,
if only to "stir the people up."
Attorney Paul Morantz, a
noted critic of so-called cults,
disagrees. He defines the Parlier
experiment as "an attempt to use
the tools of coercive persuasion
on an entire community.
"The whole thing I saw there
scared me," says Morantz. "It
really was one of the scarier
things I've ever seen."
In a footnote on the experi
ment. est officials point out that
Parlier citizens are still eligible
for a scholarship that brings the
training's cost down from $350
to just $50. They estimate that
60 residents have taken advan
tage of the offer since the con
troversy began.
PARLIER — Like most social
experiments, it started with a
question: Could the new age of
philosophy of Werner Erhard's
est significantly alter the future
of an entire town?
Almost two years later, most
residents of this San Joaquin Val
ley Community would agree that
est changed their city, although
not all would agree the change
\\ as for the better. Some say est is
"dangerous" or "something
from the devil."
Mention of est here brings on
memories of a controversy that
turned neighbor against
neighbor in what has been de
scribed as "a miniature civil
war."
But for Erhard, the "Parlier
experiment" was a success.
Erhard says the est corporation,
which grossed $20.5 million in
1979, used its Parlier experience
in expanding its training to rural
areas throughout the world.
