# Banks and brokerage firms financed Hunt silver hoard

WASHINGTON — Banks and brokerage
houses loaned the Hunt brothers of Texas millions
of dollars to finance their silver speculation at a
time when the Carter administration and federal
banking authorities were trying to stop speculative
loans in order to fight inflation.
Some hanksand brokers refused to participate in
the Hunts' silver speculation spree, but others
helped the billionaire brothers borrow more
money, The Washington Post has learned.
Using their vast horde of silver as collateral to
get loans, the Hunts bought so much of the metal
they pushed the price past $50 an ounce and jacked
up the price of silver products ranging from photo
graphic film to fancy flatware.
Among those who loaned money to the Hunts
were the Bache Group and ACL I international, a
commodity firm headed by A.C. Israel, chairman
of the board of People's Drug Stores.
Bache. in turn, took the silver put upas collateral
by the Hunts and used the metal to borrow more
money from First National Bank of Chicago,
sources familiar with the transaction say.
Denial
First National Bank of Chicago issued a state
ment Wednesday night saying it "categorically de
nies" making any loans that violated the Federal
Reserve's policy.
Bache reportedly went to First National of
Chicago after other lenders refused to consider a
large loan backed by silver, suspecting the Hunts
might be involved.
Bache would not normally have to tell the bank a
customer's identity, but the size of the loan and the
silver backing were a good clue about who was
involved, say sources familiar with the transaction.
Contrary to Volcker
Since last October. Federal Reserves Board
Chairman Paul Volcker has been urging lenders
not to make loans for speculative purposes. The
Fed has tried to dry up money for speculative lend
ing by restricting the availability of funds.
President Jimmy Carter himself took a swing at
speculators last month, urging banks not to finance
such investments.
The role of the banks in the collapse of the silver
market is under congressional investigation.
Despite their riches, reported to total billions of
dollars, the Hunts are known to have borrowed
heavily to finance the biggest speculative spree in
commodity market history.

Getting money was easy for the Hunts when the
price of silver was going up last fall. They either
used profits they made as the price rose, or bor
rowed money using their increasingly valuable
silver holdings to back the loan.
But when the price began coming down, the
Hunts found money hard to get. Not only were
lenders unwilling to lend them more than a fraction
of the value of their silver, but the banks also were
risking the wrath of Volcker.
The night before the silver market hit bottom, on
March 27. the Hunts met secretly in New York
with representatives of their major silver creditors
— Bache, ACLI and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
and Smith, it was learned.
Unpaid debt
At the meeting. Herbert Hunt warned that he
and his brother. Nelson Bunker, would not be able
to pay their silver speculating debts immediately.
The Hunts at that point reportedly owed at least
$100 million to Bache, $123 million ACLI and
undisclosed amounts to Merrill Lynch.
Bache's involvement with the Hunts was made
public the next day when the Securities and Ex
change Commission took steps to protect Bache
shareholders in case the company went under.
ACLI — the commodity firm controlled by A.C.
Israel — acknowledge for the first time its widely
rumored role in the involvement with the Hunts.
Policy
"As a matter of policy, we do not comment on
customers' accounts," the company said in a state
ment issued in response to an inquiry. "But in fact,
we have no problems with the Hunts." Unlike the
banks, ACLI does not come under the control of
the Federal Reserve.
ACLI is called "ack-lee" in the trade. The ini
tials stand for Adrian C. and Leon Israel, who are
brothers. A third brother, Sam, heads the futures
operation.
A.C. Israel is known as "Ace" in commodity
circles. His ACLI operations are based in White
Plains, N.Y., and do business from Wall Street to
West Africa through many subsidiaries. There is
ACLI Sugar Co., ACLI Metal & Ore Co., ACLI
Produce, A.C. & Leon Israel Coffee Co., and A.C.
Israel Rubber Co.
A.C. Israel Cocoa Co. was a prototype of a
major cocoa trader for a 1971 Harvard Business
School study. As chairman of the board of People's
Drug Stores, A.C. Israel owns 35.4 percent of the
chain's stock, giving him solid control of one of the
Washington areas largest retailers.
