# USC here this weekend
## Cardinal 9 drop two more games 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
The baseball team went 0-for-2 Tuesday
and Wednesday, and with USC coming to
town for a three-game set, starting this after
noon, the Cards have their work cut out for
them.
Tuesday in Berkeley and Wednesday at
home against Santa Clara, the Cards were
beaten by good pitching and at times by their
own sloppy fielding. Tuesday Cal kicked
Stanford 12-4. The next day non-conference
rival Santa Clara shut out the Cards 2-0.
Cal took the rubber game of the three
game series on Tuesday behind a strong out
ing from pitcher Glenn Newton. Newton, in
winning his sixth of the year without'a loss,
pitched eight innings, giving up onl\ four
Card hits while striking out four. To com
pound matters, the Bears, in the second in
ning, turned four Paul Grame walks, two
Cardinal errors and only two of their own hits
into six runs to break the game open.
Wednesday, Santa Clara's Kevin
McKenna continued a personal streak
against Stanford, going back to JV's last year,
by blanking the Cards through the first seven
innings. In the next two innings. Jeff Walsh,
despite a shaky ninth, mopped up the shutout
for the Broncos. Santa Clara third baseman
Sean Everton broke a pitchers duel between
McKenna and Stanford's Tim Sherrell in the
seventh with a home run. But the game was
sealed in the eighth when with runners on
first and third. Bronco John Barrett broke
for second and Stanford reliever George
Lopez threw the ball into center field, scoring

the lead runner.
This afternoon, the Cardinals will try to
snap a three game losing streak at home and
to avenge a three-game USC sweep earlier
in the season. The game today will start at
2:30 p.m. The single games on Saturday and
Sunday start at 1 p.m.
Stanford will need a strong showing this
weekend if they are to have a shot at the
Pac-10 conference leader Arizona State
(10-6). Their loss to Cal dropped the confer
ence record to 6-9. The Bears improved their
conference record to 9-7 yesterday as they
beat Arizona State in Tempo.
That third game of the Cal series, accord
ing to Mark Marquess, was "just a break
down. It was the worst game we've played in
quite a while. 1 guess we had eight walks and
with a couple of errors, we were out of the
game completely."
Stanford was down 7-2 after the second
inning.
In the series, Cal won the first game in
extra innings and Stanford defeated the
Bears handily in the second.
"The first game was the key. It was the
game we could have and should have won."
Marquess said.
The Cardinals lost another close one
against Santa Clara on Wednesday. The
game was a pitcher's duel through the first six
innings. McKenna pitched a good game for
Santa Clara but so did Sherrell for the Cards.
Said Marquess. "Tim hadn't pitched in a
while so we only figured to get three or four
innings out of him. but he was doing an out
standing job and he said he felt good, so we

left him in. It was definitely his best effort of
the year."
In the first five innings. Sherrell was out
standing. He kept the hall in the infield for
the most part, allowing only three hits. In the
sixth, he began to tire, giving up a single and a
one-out walk. A ground out later, first base
man Don Mazzilli lofted a deep two-out tly
to right but Mike Toothman gathered it in a
few feet from the fence.
The next inning Sherrell wasn't so lucky as
Everton pumped one over the left field fence
for first blood and a Bronco lead. An inning
later on the first and third play. Lopez had
the Bronco runner "hung up. but he panicked
and threu the ball away," according to Mar
quess. The error let in the second run —
which was not even needed as it turned out.
The Cardinals rapped out nine hits but
couldn't seem to push one in; they stranded
10 on base.
Stanford has left a lot of men on base re
cently, which upsets Marquess. But he said
that "realistically, we're hitting better than
we have in a while but we just couldn't seem
to get the big hit. As 1 said, we are putting the
ball in play, no one is striking out with run
ners on base. So 1 can't be totally discour
aged. I think the baseball season runs in cy
cles and we're just in that phase right now.
We'll be all right as long as we keep hitting
the ball, though."
