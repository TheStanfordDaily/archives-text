### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
Nobody is calling them a pe
rennial powerhouse, but a
greatly underrated California
Bears women's tennis team
hosted the Stanford Cardinals
Tuesday and was trounced 8-1.
Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan was not surprised at the lop
sided score but was taken back
by the convincing match scores.
"They actually have a very
strong team," said Brennan.
"They barely snuck into the rat
ings in 20th place, but they've
beaten No. 11 ranked Pepper
dine twice. No. 16 ASU
(Arizona State University) and
several other ranked teams.
There is something wrong
somewhere in the poll — they
probablv shuld be ranked about
10th."
In a series of one-sided singles
matches, Alycia Moulton
thrashed Beth Fernbacher 6-1,
6-2 in the No. 1 spot; Donna
Rubin breezed to a 6-0, 6-2 win
over Barrie Bullmore in the No.
2 spot, and Caryn Copeland did
away with Peggy Kincaid 6-2.
6-3 playing third.
Sue Rasmussen continued on
her battle with three-set matches
in the No. 4 match before dispos
ing of Lisa Bee 6-2, 3-6. 6-0.
Julia Leighton moved up a
couple of notches, from seventh
to fifth, on the Stanford ladder
and overcame Sue Folck 6-1,
6-4. Lisa Gordon trounced Sue
Guyin 6-1, 6-2 in the final
match.
In the doubles, Moulton

teamed with Rasmussen to beat
Fernbacher and Bullmore 6-2,
6-3 in the first match and Gayle
Chan teamed with Leighton to
blast Guyan and Folck 6-1, 6-0
in the third.
California picked up their lone
win in the number two doubles
match as Kincaid and Bee sur
prised Rubin and Copeland 6-4.
6-2.
"It was a good match for us."
remarked Brennan. "because
Cal is one of those in-between
teams. They're not a bad team
like San Jose and they're not a
good team like UCLA — they're
right in-between. I thought we'd
win but I didn't think the
matches would be so one-sided.
We really got it together against
UCLA (last weekend)."
Stanford's next match is
against Santa Clara Monday at
the varsity courts.
