Cards hit Jenner Classic
The cream of the Stanford
cindermen's crop will travel to
San Jose tomorrow to compete
in the Bruce Jenner Classic. The
meet is being called a "mini-
Olympics" which is due to the
abundance of world class com
petition that will be there. (Be
sides, at this point track circles
are looking for any substitute.)
Cardinal representatives will
be. Darrin Nelson (100 meters),
John Schaer (800), Tom Lob
singer (1500), Bill Gail and Bill

Haldeman (Steeplechase), Rick
Buss (Hammer, Discus) and
Dave Thomson (Discus).
Netters travel south
The Stanford men's tennis
team hit the road this weekend
for an important couple of
Pac-10 matches in Southern
California. The Cards play USC
today and run up against UCLA
tomorrow.
The Trojans beat UCLA last
week, but the victory was some
what marred by the fact that
UCLA was missing three players

due to injury. Those three are
expected to return for the Stan
ford match.
Correction
In a column written by Mike
Oneal for the April 2 issue of the
Daily, it was said that Bob
Mathias was the announcer at
the Martin Luther King Games.
In fact, it was not he that an
nounced them but Frank Zar
nowski and Garry Hill. The
editors wish to apologize lor this
mistake.
