# Stanford Prof. Richard Atkinson named chancellor at UCSD
## 
### Mac Funk Staff Writer 
After a reportedly controversial search process, the Re
gents of the University of California have appointed Stan
ford Psychology Professor Richard Atkinson Chancellor of
the San Diego campus of the university, effective July 1.
The specific issue which aroused concern among UC-SD
students was what many Iclt was a lack of student input in
the search process.
Atkinson is currently on leave from Stanford as director
of the National Science Foundation, which allocates over
$900 million a year as the science research funding arm of
the federal government. Atkinson assumed that post in
1977 after serving as deputy director for two years. He is the
first social scientist to have served as director of the NSF.
Atkinson chaired the Department of Psychology from
1969-1974 and then was associate dean of the School of
Humanities and Sciences. He originally joined the faculty
here in 1956 after earning his Ph.D. in 1955 from Indiana
University.
Innovative
According to Professor Gordon Bower, current chairman
of the Psychology Department, Atkinson's chief research

achievements while at Stanford were in the area of
mathematical descriptions of memory and learning.
Through his research, Atkinson, with his colleague Prof
Patrick Suppes of the Philosophy Department, developed
innovative programs for elementary school curricula in
reading and mathematics which were subsequently ex
ported throughout the country.
Atkinson also co-authored an introductory psychology
text with his wife, Rita, and Emeritus Stanford Psychology
Professor Ernest Hilgard, which his wife has since revised
twice. The text is considered one of the foremost introduc
tory texts in psychology according to Bower.
"We are very sorry to lose him (Atkinson) as we hoped he
was coming hack to Stanford," said Bower. "But we wish
him well and expect that he will do very well."
Replacement
Atkinson will fill the post at UC-SD left vacant when
former Chancellor William McElroy resigned last summer
after a faculty vote of no confidence in his administration.
A search committee chaired by University of California
President David Saxon, and consisting of faculty from
UC-SD and regents of the university, eventually compiled a
list of 200 nominations for the post.

According to Linda Saho, commissioner of external af
fairs for the Associated Students of UC-SD, many students
in San Diego hoped that the search committee could nomi
nate three or four finalists for the post, who would then visit
the campus and meet with student leaders. Alternatively,
the student leaders hoped they could have at least the
chance to meet the committee's final choice before his
appointment was made official.
No visit
According to SeHo, the appointment of Atkinson for the
post was made official before he ever visited the campus.
Sabo emphasized that the opinions concerning Atkinson
himself are unequivocally positive. "Even the most radical
students aren't criticizing Atkinson himself." said Sabo. She
added that the focus of most people's concern was the lack
of student input in the process of selecting Atkinson.
The search committee included one undergraduate and
one graduate student representative. However, according
to Cheryl Dunnett, the undergraduate committee member,
these student representatives were not actually allowed to
vote on the final committee ballot. In general, said Dunnett.
"I could understand why the students wanted to know more
about the process from start to finish."

However, Dunnett also saw difficulties in meeting the
student demands, as did Sabo. "A candidate might not want
to come down to campus to meet students simply because
they might not want it to be known that theyÂ»are considering
changing jobs," said Sabo. There was always the possibility
that if it became known that a candidate was considering
post, they would drop out of the process.
Another concern among undergraduates was that the
hiring of a former director of the NSF reflects a growing
emphasis on research at UC-SD. McElroy, the retiring
Chancellor, was also director of the NSF before he came to
UC-SD eight years ago.
UC-SD is fifth in the nation in research funding, receiving
$120 million a year in grants. The sentiment among under
graduates, said Sabo, is that they do not want research to
become the first priority while undergraduate education
falls in importance. However, according to Sabo, Atkinson
has a good reputation as an administrator which will hope
fully alleviate this concern.
Overall, Sabo said, "A lot of people are pretty excited
about him. The school could really use a brand new per
son."
