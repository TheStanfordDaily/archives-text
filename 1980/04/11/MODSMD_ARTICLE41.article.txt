### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
Stanford's men's volleyball
team resumes play at home this
weekend after playing the last
four matches on the road. The
Cardinals will host Cal Poly-
SLO at Roble Gym beginning at
7:30 tomorrow night.
The Cards come off a tough
road trip in Southern California
where they dropped a pair of
matches to powerhouses UCLA
and Long Beach State last
weekend. Their record stands at
6-10 overall and 4-X in the
CIVA.

Earlier this season at San Luis
Obispo Stanford defeated Cal
Poly in three games straight, but
head coach Fred Sturm foresees
a more competitive match this
time.
"Cal Polv 's been playing really
well recently, but the guys know
that if we play well and they play
well that we'll win because we're
a better team. We'll be ready for
Cal Poly." commented Sturm.
Team captain Rod Fletcher
also expects a more difficult
match tomorrow. "1 know for a
fact that they had an off-match
(down at Cal Poly). We're going

to have to play well to win," he
said, noting that, "Cal Poly plays
a scrappy kind ol ball, there will
be a lot of long exchanges."
The coach and team members
concur that the practices have
been proceeding well. "The
coaches are doing a good job of
keeping us at it. Usually about
this time people's interests start
to wane." stated Fletcher.
Starting for the Cardinals will
be sophomore Kip Engen at set
ter. seniors Fletcher, Frank An
derson and John McColl at the
power hitter spots, and seniors
Jack Kim Lum at
the middle blocker positions.
Sturm noted that senior Tom
Grimes, sophomore Cory
Brown, and freshman Andrew
Dodds will probably get some
playing time. Concerning the
team's depth. Sturm remarked,
"I don't hesitate to use the
bench. I know it's pretty strong."
After the string of away
matches playing at home is a
welcome change, according to
the team. "We always play well
at home," the coach pointed out,
while Fletcher explained that
Roble is conducive to competi
tive matches. "We play great in
Roble. It's pretty small, so when
a crowd is there they can really
get things going," he said.
