# The 						Friday Interview
## Johnson talks development 
### 
(Editor's Note) Brooks Johnson
came to the Farm last year to re
place Payton Jordon as head
track coach and to try to pick up
the waning program. Since arriv
ing, he has merged the men 'sand
women's programs, staged the
Martin Luther King International
Freedom (lames in Stanford
StUdium and brought a keen
sense class to all of track at Stan
ford. He is a pensive man with a
highly philosophical approach to
sport and life. In this Friday In
terview with Sally Jenkins,
Johnson reflects some of these at
titudes as he talks about last
week's loss to UCLA and the de
veloping posture of this year's
team.
Jenkins: Did you expect the meet
against UCLA last Saturday to he
so one sided?
Johnson: No, I did not. It wasn't
so much the total score, the score
could've been the same because
they are one of the best dual
meet teams in the country. But 1
thought we suffered a competi
tive letdown. This is not to say
folded, but we did not perform
up to their previous level. The
score I'm not concerned with,
whether it's 1 or 100 points, it

doesn't make a difference.
Jenkins: What would you say
were the major causes of that let
down?
Johnson: I don't know exactly. It
could have been any number of
things. Before the meet we told
them (the Stanford team) that we
were not concerned with the
final score, and that might have
taken the edge off of their com
petitive instincts. It could have
been caused by the fact that they
had just had two weeks off. I'm
not sure of anything except the
fact that it happened. Maybe it
was something that we needed to
snap us back on the right track.
Jenkins: You have called UCLA
a well-balanced team. How does
Stanford compare to them in that
respect?
Johnson: In the field events we
didn't score more than three or
four points, which meant that we
had to give up thirty or forty
points to UCLA. There is no way
a team can do that and hope to
stay close point-wise. In the
track events we were more com
petitive. But we always try to
fight down to the wire. Saturday
that was not the case. We lost
some races we should have or

could have won. Some people
just didn't have it, they were hav
ing a bad day maybe. But we
have to compete to the best of
our ability.
One of the beacons in the
middle of the tempest was Rick
(Buss, a hammerthrower)
throwing over his personal re
cord by five feet. I know that the
disadvantages that others suf
fered he suffered too. But he
overcame them and the others
can too. From practices this
week I look forward to seeing us
return to our superior competi
tive form.
Jenkins: In another interview
you said, "Saturday showed us
the kind of things we have to work
on." What are a few of these
things in particular?
Johnson: One is not being
overly awed by an imposing and
superior opponent, which
UCI.A certainly was. It would
have taken a disaster on their
part for us to have won, and we
knew that. But I was not pre
pared for disaster to strike us
either. We need to force the
other team to make mistakes;
bring them down to size like Cal


Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso has been criticized in the past for
weak recruiting efforts, hut this year he may have slapped a lot
of cynics in the face by posting a promising effort.


Brooks Johnson
did with USC. You have to be
ever present and force them into
making mistakes they wouldn't
normally make.
Jenkins: How far below their
normal potential would you say
Stanford slipped against UCLA ?
Johnson: Not very much. It was
not the individual scores that re
ally fell, but the sum total.
Everyone was just a little less in
tense than they had been in the
four previous competitions. In
expecting UCLA to be so awe
some (and they were), 1 think it
took the edge off of the kids. In
the previous meets we felt like
we were in it from start to finish,
in this one it didn't.
Jenkins: Wljat was your main ob
jective at the start of the season ?
Johnson: To establish the fact
that we don't back off from any

one no matter what — all oppo
nents. With all of our other op
ponents that has been the case.
Maybe it's too much to ask that
that should be the case all year. It
could be that my goals are overly
agressive and ambitious. But
good teams have that attitude,
and we are going to be a good
team. That might be a little pre
mature but the fact that it's going
to eventuate is not debateable.
On Saturday we had to take a
vicarious kind of pride in what
Cal did tii USC, but it is a good
indication, a barometer of what
can and ought to be done. 1
wouldn't expect the kids to pull
any punches when they are
studying for their trigonometry
exam or whatever, and the same
goes for their performance on
the track field. The two are the
same thing to me; they are in
tertwined. If they refuse to pull
the rip cord in one then the same
goes for the other. The attempts
they make in track and field are
what makes them better students
and people. It prepares them to
make decisions they will have to
make in the future.

Jenkins: What do you forsee in
the Bruce Jenner Classic at San
Jose this weekend?
Johnson: I forsee a return to our
pre\ ious form. Hopefully we can
get back in the saddle — riding
tall and proud like we were be
fore. 1 think the scores will indi
cate this. I think that we learned
and benefited from last week.
Jenkins: Track is such an indi
vidual sport. How much em
phasis do you place on team ef
fort?
Johnson: The fact is, track is a
team sport because what any one
competitor does directly affects
another. It's a gross misun
derstanding to say that it is not a
team sport. Everyone has a
specific skill and a specific job to
perform just like on any other
team. The first race, the four-by
one (relay), influences the next
competitor in the standings, and
certainly psychologically. In ten
nis, swimming, basketball, you
have people that have different
skills and jobs. If you have a bas
ketball team that has five people
that want to shoot the ball all the
time, vou don't have a ver\ sood

team.
Jvnkins: How long do you lliink
it will he before yon have the kind
of team you want?
Johnson: I think that given the
kind of talent we were able to
attract in both numbers and qual
ity this year, we will be competi
tive in three seasons. Competi
tive doesn't mean we will be able
to win against UCLA. But in
stead of entering it with the at
titude that we might win it they
suffer a major disaster we will be
able to put a scare into them.
That's all we can hope for. to
gi\e the team a sense of pride
and emphasize that you have to
go out and do your very best. We
will be sucessful in the first four
meets because we did the best we
could do; we were three and one.
When you do that it's a real
learning and growing experi
ence. Going out and getting your
ears pinned back is not. 1 don't
think losing builds character, not
the character 1 am interested in.
Losing is when you come in sec
ond and you could have come in
first.

Martin Luther King International
Freedom (lames in Stanford
StUdium and brought a keen
sense class to all of track at Stan
ford. He is a pensive man with a
highly philosophical approach to
sport and life. In this Friday In
terview with Sally Jenkins,
Johnson reflects some of these at
titudes as he talks about last
week's loss to UCLA and the de
veloping posture of this year's
team.
Jenkins: Did you expect the meet
against UCLA last Saturday to he
so one sided?
Johnson: No, I did not. It wasn't
so much the total score, the score
could've been the same because
they are one of the best dual
meet teams in the country. But 1
thought we suffered a competi
tive letdown. This is not to say
folded, but we did not perform
up to their previous level. The
score I'm not concerned with,
whether it's 1 or 100 points, it

doesn't make a difference.
Jenkins: What would you say
were the major causes of that let
down?
Johnson: I don't know exactly. It
could have been any number of
things. Before the meet we told
them (the Stanford team) that we
were not concerned with the
final score, and that might have
taken the edge off of their com
petitive instincts. It could have
been caused by the fact that they
had just had two weeks off. I'm
not sure of anything except the
fact that it happened. Maybe it
was something that we needed to
snap us back on the right track.
Jenkins: You have called UCLA
a well-balanced team. How does
Stanford compare to them in that
respect?
Johnson: In the field events we
didn't score more than three or
four points, which meant that we
had to give up thirty or forty
points to UCLA. There is no way
a team can do that and hope to
stay close point-wise. In the
track events we were more com
petitive. But we always try to
fight down to the wire. Saturday
that was not the case. We lost
some races we should have or

could have won. Some people
just didn't have it, they were hav
ing a bad day maybe. But we
have to compete to the best of
our ability.
One of the beacons in the
middle of the tempest was Rick
(Buss, a hammerthrower)
throwing over his personal re
cord by five feet. I know that the
disadvantages that others suf
fered he suffered too. But he
overcame them and the others
can too. From practices this
week I look forward to seeing us
return to our superior competi
tive form.
Jenkins: In another interview
you said, "Saturday showed us
the kind of things we have to work
on." What are a few of these
things in particular?
Johnson: One is not being
overly awed by an imposing and
superior opponent, which
UCI.A certainly was. It would
have taken a disaster on their
part for us to have won, and we
knew that. But I was not pre
pared for disaster to strike us
either. We need to force the
other team to make mistakes;
bring them down to size like Cal


Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso has been criticized in the past for
weak recruiting efforts, hut this year he may have slapped a lot
of cynics in the face by posting a promising effort.


Brooks Johnson
did with USC. You have to be
ever present and force them into
making mistakes they wouldn't
normally make.
Jenkins: How far below their
normal potential would you say
Stanford slipped against UCLA ?
Johnson: Not very much. It was
not the individual scores that re
ally fell, but the sum total.
Everyone was just a little less in
tense than they had been in the
four previous competitions. In
expecting UCLA to be so awe
some (and they were), 1 think it
took the edge off of the kids. In
the previous meets we felt like
we were in it from start to finish,
in this one it didn't.
Jenkins: Wljat was your main ob
jective at the start of the season ?
Johnson: To establish the fact
that we don't back off from any

one no matter what — all oppo
nents. With all of our other op
ponents that has been the case.
Maybe it's too much to ask that
that should be the case all year. It
could be that my goals are overly
agressive and ambitious. But
good teams have that attitude,
and we are going to be a good
team. That might be a little pre
mature but the fact that it's going
to eventuate is not debateable.
On Saturday we had to take a
vicarious kind of pride in what
Cal did tii USC, but it is a good
indication, a barometer of what
can and ought to be done. 1
wouldn't expect the kids to pull
any punches when they are
studying for their trigonometry
exam or whatever, and the same
goes for their performance on
the track field. The two are the
same thing to me; they are in
tertwined. If they refuse to pull
the rip cord in one then the same
goes for the other. The attempts
they make in track and field are
what makes them better students
and people. It prepares them to
make decisions they will have to
make in the future.

Jenkins: What do you forsee in
the Bruce Jenner Classic at San
Jose this weekend?
Johnson: I forsee a return to our
pre\ ious form. Hopefully we can
get back in the saddle — riding
tall and proud like we were be
fore. 1 think the scores will indi
cate this. I think that we learned
and benefited from last week.
Jenkins: Track is such an indi
vidual sport. How much em
phasis do you place on team ef
fort?
Johnson: The fact is, track is a
team sport because what any one
competitor does directly affects
another. It's a gross misun
derstanding to say that it is not a
team sport. Everyone has a
specific skill and a specific job to
perform just like on any other
team. The first race, the four-by
one (relay), influences the next
competitor in the standings, and
certainly psychologically. In ten
nis, swimming, basketball, you
have people that have different
skills and jobs. If you have a bas
ketball team that has five people
that want to shoot the ball all the
time, vou don't have a ver\ sood

team.
Jvnkins: How long do you lliink
it will he before yon have the kind
of team you want?
Johnson: I think that given the
kind of talent we were able to
attract in both numbers and qual
ity this year, we will be competi
tive in three seasons. Competi
tive doesn't mean we will be able
to win against UCLA. But in
stead of entering it with the at
titude that we might win it they
suffer a major disaster we will be
able to put a scare into them.
That's all we can hope for. to
gi\e the team a sense of pride
and emphasize that you have to
go out and do your very best. We
will be sucessful in the first four
meets because we did the best we
could do; we were three and one.
When you do that it's a real
learning and growing experi
ence. Going out and getting your
ears pinned back is not. 1 don't
think losing builds character, not
the character 1 am interested in.
Losing is when you come in sec
ond and you could have come in
first.

Johnson reflects some of these at
titudes as he talks about last
week's loss to UCLA and the de
veloping posture of this year's
team.
Jenkins: Did you expect the meet
against UCLA last Saturday to he
so one sided?
Johnson: No, I did not. It wasn't
so much the total score, the score
could've been the same because
they are one of the best dual
meet teams in the country. But 1
thought we suffered a competi
tive letdown. This is not to say
folded, but we did not perform
up to their previous level. The
score I'm not concerned with,
whether it's 1 or 100 points, it

doesn't make a difference.
Jenkins: What would you say
were the major causes of that let
down?
Johnson: I don't know exactly. It
could have been any number of
things. Before the meet we told
them (the Stanford team) that we
were not concerned with the
final score, and that might have
taken the edge off of their com
petitive instincts. It could have
been caused by the fact that they
had just had two weeks off. I'm
not sure of anything except the
fact that it happened. Maybe it
was something that we needed to
snap us back on the right track.
Jenkins: You have called UCLA
a well-balanced team. How does
Stanford compare to them in that
respect?
Johnson: In the field events we
didn't score more than three or
four points, which meant that we
had to give up thirty or forty
points to UCLA. There is no way
a team can do that and hope to
stay close point-wise. In the
track events we were more com
petitive. But we always try to
fight down to the wire. Saturday
that was not the case. We lost
some races we should have or

could have won. Some people
just didn't have it, they were hav
ing a bad day maybe. But we
have to compete to the best of
our ability.
One of the beacons in the
middle of the tempest was Rick
(Buss, a hammerthrower)
throwing over his personal re
cord by five feet. I know that the
disadvantages that others suf
fered he suffered too. But he
overcame them and the others
can too. From practices this
week I look forward to seeing us
return to our superior competi
tive form.
Jenkins: In another interview
you said, "Saturday showed us
the kind of things we have to work
on." What are a few of these
things in particular?
Johnson: One is not being
overly awed by an imposing and
superior opponent, which
UCI.A certainly was. It would
have taken a disaster on their
part for us to have won, and we
knew that. But I was not pre
pared for disaster to strike us
either. We need to force the
other team to make mistakes;
bring them down to size like Cal


Stanford coach Dick Dißiaso has been criticized in the past for
weak recruiting efforts, hut this year he may have slapped a lot
of cynics in the face by posting a promising effort.


Brooks Johnson
did with USC. You have to be
ever present and force them into
making mistakes they wouldn't
normally make.
Jenkins: How far below their
normal potential would you say
Stanford slipped against UCLA ?
Johnson: Not very much. It was
not the individual scores that re
ally fell, but the sum total.
Everyone was just a little less in
tense than they had been in the
four previous competitions. In
expecting UCLA to be so awe
some (and they were), 1 think it
took the edge off of the kids. In
the previous meets we felt like
we were in it from start to finish,
in this one it didn't.
Jenkins: Wljat was your main ob
jective at the start of the season ?
Johnson: To establish the fact
that we don't back off from any

one no matter what — all oppo
nents. With all of our other op
ponents that has been the case.
Maybe it's too much to ask that
that should be the case all year. It
could be that my goals are overly
agressive and ambitious. But
good teams have that attitude,
and we are going to be a good
team. That might be a little pre
mature but the fact that it's going
to eventuate is not debateable.
On Saturday we had to take a
vicarious kind of pride in what
Cal did tii USC, but it is a good
indication, a barometer of what
can and ought to be done. 1
wouldn't expect the kids to pull
any punches when they are
studying for their trigonometry
exam or whatever, and the same
goes for their performance on
the track field. The two are the
same thing to me; they are in
tertwined. If they refuse to pull
the rip cord in one then the same
goes for the other. The attempts
they make in track and field are
what makes them better students
and people. It prepares them to
make decisions they will have to
make in the future.

Jenkins: What do you forsee in
the Bruce Jenner Classic at San
Jose this weekend?
Johnson: I forsee a return to our
pre\ ious form. Hopefully we can
get back in the saddle — riding
tall and proud like we were be
fore. 1 think the scores will indi
cate this. I think that we learned
and benefited from last week.
Jenkins: Track is such an indi
vidual sport. How much em
phasis do you place on team ef
fort?
Johnson: The fact is, track is a
team sport because what any one
competitor does directly affects
another. It's a gross misun
derstanding to say that it is not a
team sport. Everyone has a
specific skill and a specific job to
perform just like on any other
team. The first race, the four-by
one (relay), influences the next
competitor in the standings, and
certainly psychologically. In ten
nis, swimming, basketball, you
have people that have different
skills and jobs. If you have a bas
ketball team that has five people
that want to shoot the ball all the
time, vou don't have a ver\ sood

team.
Jvnkins: How long do you lliink
it will he before yon have the kind
of team you want?
Johnson: I think that given the
kind of talent we were able to
attract in both numbers and qual
ity this year, we will be competi
tive in three seasons. Competi
tive doesn't mean we will be able
to win against UCLA. But in
stead of entering it with the at
titude that we might win it they
suffer a major disaster we will be
able to put a scare into them.
That's all we can hope for. to
gi\e the team a sense of pride
and emphasize that you have to
go out and do your very best. We
will be sucessful in the first four
meets because we did the best we
could do; we were three and one.
When you do that it's a real
learning and growing experi
ence. Going out and getting your
ears pinned back is not. 1 don't
think losing builds character, not
the character 1 am interested in.
Losing is when you come in sec
ond and you could have come in
first.
