# The
						Friday Interview
## Johnson talks development 
### 
(Editor's Note) Brooks Johnson
came to the Farm last year to re
place Payton Jordon as head
track coach and to try to pick up
the waning program. Since arriv
ing, he has merged the men 'sand
women's programs, staged the
Martin Luther King International
Freedom (lames in Stanford
StUdium and brought a keen
sense class to all of track at Stan
ford. He is a pensive man with a
highly philosophical approach to
sport and life. In this Friday In
terview with Sally Jenkins,
Johnson reflects some of these at
titudes as he talks about last
week's loss to UCLA and the de
veloping posture of this year's
team.
Jenkins: Did you expect the meet
against UCLA last Saturday to he
so one sided?
Johnson: No, I did not. It wasn't
so much the total score, the score
could've been the same because
they are one of the best dual
meet teams in the country. But 1
thought we suffered a competi
tive letdown. This is not to say
folded, but we did not perform
up to their previous level. The
score I'm not concerned with,
whether it's 1 or 100 points, it

doesn't make a difference.
Jenkins: What would you say
were the major causes of that let
down?
Johnson: I don't know exactly. It
could have been any number of
things. Before the meet we told
them (the Stanford team) that we
were not concerned with the
final score, and that might have
taken the edge off of their com
petitive instincts. It could have
been caused by the fact that they
had just had two weeks off. I'm
not sure of anything except the
fact that it happened. Maybe it
was something that we needed to
snap us back on the right track.
Jenkins: You have called UCLA
a well-balanced team. How does
Stanford compare to them in that
respect?
Johnson: In the field events we
didn't score more than three or
four points, which meant that we
had to give up thirty or forty
points to UCLA. There is no way
a team can do that and hope to
stay close point-wise. In the
track events we were more com
petitive. But we always try to
fight down to the wire. Saturday
that was not the case. We lost
some races we should have or

could have won. Some people
just didn't have it, they were hav
ing a bad day maybe. But we
have to compete to the best of
our ability.
One of the beacons in the
middle of the tempest was Rick
(Buss, a hammerthrower)
throwing over his personal re
cord by five feet. I know that the
disadvantages that others suf
fered he suffered too. But he
overcame them and the others
can too. From practices this
week I look forward to seeing us
return to our superior competi
tive form.
Jenkins: In another interview
you said, "Saturday showed us
the kind of things we have to work
on." What are a few of these
things in particular?
Johnson: One is not being
overly awed by an imposing and
superior opponent, which
UCI.A certainly was. It would
have taken a disaster on their
part for us to have won, and we
knew that. But I was not pre
pared for disaster to strike us
either. We need to force the
other team to make mistakes;
bring them down to size like Cal


Stanford coach Dick Di√üiaso has been criticized in the past for
weak recruiting efforts, hut this year he may have slapped a lot
of cynics in the face by posting a promising effort.
