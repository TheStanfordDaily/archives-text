# Hot cage recruits sealed
## 
### Peter Finch Sports Editor 
As it stands now, the Stanford
basketball coaching staff has at
tracted three of the top West
Coast recruits and can pat them
selves on the back for a job well
done.
But. with .some more hard
work and a little luck, there may
he enough cause to go out and
really celebrate.
Presently, Stanford head
coach Dick Dißiaso is recruiting
three more potential Cardinals,
all of which are regarded as
among the nation's top high
school players.
By Wednesday, the first day
for signing national letters of in
tent, Stanford had officially re
ceived word that 6-9 forward
Hans Wichary of San Diego, 6-2
guard Keith Jones of Pheonix,
Arizona, and 6-5 swingman
Roger Lemons of Anaheim will
come to the Farm next year.
Wichary, from University
High School, was the San Diego
County Player of the Year this
season. He averaged 26.3 points
and 12.8 rebounds per game for

University. He also shot 51 per
cent from the field and SI per
cent from the free throw line,
which no doubt contributed to
his selection to the Los Angeles
Times All-CIF First Team in the
San Diego Area.
Jones averaged 18.5 points
and six assists per game to lead his
Pheonix Union High School
team to the state semi-final
playoffs. For his efforts he was
voted the Arizona State Player
of the Year. Jones also led Union
High to league titles in 1977-78,
1978-79 and 1979-80. Av
eragewise, Jones' best year was
as a junior, when he hit 21.0
points per game. As a sopho
more he ,scored 18.9. Jones was
also voted an Academic All-
America by the National
Coaches Association this season.
Lemons was an All-Orange
County First Team choice at
Katella High this year. He aver
aged 14.1 points. 7.2 rebounds
and 4.2 assists as the Most Valu
able Player in the Empire
League. Connecting on 50 per
cent of Ins field goal attempts
and 8 I percent of his foul shots.

Lemons was selected the MVP of
two tournaments and made the
All-Tournament Team at Hun
tington Beach this season.
As a three year starter Lemons
scored 853 career points and led
Katella to the Empire League
championship in 1978-79 and
1979-80. Both seasons the
team went all the way to the OF
A AAA quarter-finals. He is also
one of the best high school long
jumpers in Orange County with
a personal best of 24-2.
On the road, Dißfiaso was un
available for corfiment on the
new recruits. Assistant coach
Ken Maxcv was reached in his
office, but declined to talk about
the new players until "all the re
cruiting is finished."
"The three players we've
signed are all legitimate, major
college prospects," stated Stan
ford sports information director
Bob Rose.
"Wichary is an exceptionally
mobile big forward who is an ex
cellent shooter," Rose con
tinued. "He was considered the
best player in the San Diego
area."
Jones, Rose said, is very quick
— possibly the quickest Dißiaso
has ever recruited. And Lemon
is known to be one of the more
versitile players around, accord
ing to Rose.
"He could play guard or for
ward" for us. And he's an out
standing jumper for his size."

The three main players Di-
Biaso is still recruiting are 6-7
forward John Rivelli and 6-3
guard Butch Graves, both from
the same high school in
Scarsdale. N.Y.. and 6-6 forward
Barry Spencer, from Detroit,
Mich., who Rose labels as "all
everything." Spencer is the best
known of all the possible re
cruits.
Each of these three players is
among the country's finest, and if
Stanford could land at least two

out of the three, Rose said, he
would be "unbelievably happy."
So. naturally, would Stanford
basketball fans. A good, strong
recruiting year is just what the
Cards need.
Right now Dißiaso and his
staff are looking at a good re
cruiting year. If they can turn
their other three "maybes" into
"yes's" they will have com
pleted one of their best recruit
ing years in a long, long time.
