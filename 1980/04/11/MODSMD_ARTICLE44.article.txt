## 
### 
Bicycle racing, one of
Europe's favorite sports, is com
ing to the Stanford campus to
morrow morning as the Stanford
cycling team hosts the fourth in
tercollegiate race of this season.
The course will circle Wilbur and
Stern Halls in a .7-mi 1 e loop
which the racers will cover up to
40 times. This sort of race on a
short, repeated course is called a
criterium and presents an excit
ing variety of twists and turns for
the riders to deal with. The
criterium will also involve sev
eral "primes" (pronounced
preems), or races within the race,
for place points on a particular
lap.
The Stanford team expects to
compete strongly in the event,
having a fine record already for
this season. In their first r<lce. on
the rolling course of Foothill Col
lege. Stanford took fourth place
overall with Bob Cook collecting
points for his sixth place finish in
the expert race and Liz New
berry contributing with her vic
tory in the women's division.
Two weeks ago the team

traveled to San Luis Obispo for a
multi-collegiate race hosted by
Cuesta College. Stuart Ross
nabbed a win for Stanford in the
novice race, his first race in seven
years, and Chris F.nglehardt
finished ninth in the field sprint.
Liz Newberry sprinted to a third
place in the women's event,
while Stanford expert team
mates Bruce Pauly and George
,Hermann initiated an early
breakaway that decimated their
field. In their final sprint they
took fourth and second respec
tively. putting Stanford in second
place overall behind UCSB.
Racers will be coming from as
far away as Sacramento and
CI arem on t College to compete
in the three categories: novice,
women and expert. One team to
watch will be last year's winners
from UCSB. There will also be
