# Mitchell leads Masters

### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) â€”Jeff
Mitchell, a longshot rookie in a
field of stars, birdied his last two
holes for a 6-under par 66 that
broke a foreign stranglehold on
the first round of the 44th Mas
ters golf tournament yesterday.
Mitchell. 25.the last man to
finish his round in the gathering
gloom of a Southern spring day,
tied PGA David Graham and
British Open titleholder Seve
Ballesteros for the lead.
The winds gusting through the
chutes formed by towering pines
that line the fairways dashed the
hopes of most of the American

stars.
Typical of their frustrations
were the efforts of Jack Nicklaus
and lom Watson.
Nicklaus, at age 40 attempting
to regain the peak of supremacy
he enjoyed so long, had two of
his shots to the green knocked
down by wind that changed in
velocity and direction while the
hall was in the air. He shot a 74
that left him eight strokes hack.
Watson, the outstanding
player in the game for three sea
sons and the favorite to score his
second Masters triumph, fought
his way to a 73.

But their problems were no
thing compared with those en
countered by Tom Weiskopf. He
had an excursion into the realm
of the record-setting golfing hor
rors. It was the stuff of night
mares.
He made a score of 13 on the
hole, by two shots the highest
ever recorded in the history of
the tournament.
"It was extremely embarras
sing,'' said Weiskopf, a four-time
runnerup in this event. His fam
ous temper was under control
after he signed for his 85. But it
was controlled at a price.
