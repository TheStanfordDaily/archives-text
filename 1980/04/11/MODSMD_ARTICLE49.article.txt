The hot Andalusian sun beats
down on Sevilla. Across the
Sierpes, the city's main street, a
battle of nerves is going on. In
modern Spain, entering a new
age after the death of Franco, the
forces of the past are meeting for
one last showdown.
General Luis Alfara Fernan
dez, guardian of the old Spain,
Franco's trusted general, sits in
the cafe. Across the way sits a
heavily muscled young man, a
revolutionary, an assassin of one
of the general's close friends.
And, though the general does
not know it, this young man is his
son. The issue to be settled bet
ween these two representatives
of revolution and order is the
death of the poet, Federico Gar
cia Lorca, killed almost 40 years
before in a massacre of Republi
can sympathizers during the first
days of the Spanish Civil War.
There is no question that Wil
liam Herrick's story has a lot of
potential. His novel Shadows
and Wolves has the basic ele
ments of an engaging suspense

novel. Yet when everything is
put together, the book is some
thing of a disappointment.
A number of elements com
bine against Herrick in his at
tempt to tell an exciting and be-

lievable story. His characters,
though fit representatives of
Their political outlooks, lack
sympathetic quality. Theiraction
is often more allegorical than it is
believable. The terse
Hemingwayesque writing Der
rick uses to present them en
courages the reader to remain
disinterested. However, when
compared to other novels of this
sort, Herrick's work is seriously
underrated. Though he fails to
make the story engaging, his
knowledge of the Andalusian
setting, Spanish politics and the
Spanish character makes the
novel worth reading.
The exemplar of the book's
faults is the younger Alfara, the
revolutionary, who as a teenager
leaves his father's home declar
ing that he is going to light for his
people. After entering the un
derground the intrepid younger
Alfara murders one of his
father's friends and is forced to
flee. He goes to England to wait
for things to cool down. In the
meantime, so as not to be recog

nized upon his return to Spain,
he goes on a crash body-building
program. Though he swiftly de
velops the biggest biceps in the
underground, he can still be rec
ognized because he possesses the
prominent Alfara nose. To re
medy this he puts his hands in his
pants and falls on his face. Break
ing his nose for the cause.
Hard to take
Sometimes the story of this
young revolutionary is a little
hard to take. The achievements
and sacrifices he makes in the
name of revolution are hard to
believe, since the only motive he
ever expresses is his abstract love
for Spain. The younger Alfara's
actions might lead one to believe
that he was crazy, but the string
of revolutionary cliches that
make up his past lack the origi
nality one normally associates
with madness.
As the son represents the re
volution, so the father represents
the church. Franco and facism.
His loyalty is as complete as his
son's commitment to revolution.
His case is a bit easier to under
stand. At least he is rich and re
spected.
Valuable
If one tolerates the faults,
there is something very valuable
to be had out of Shadows and
Wolves. Herrick sacrifices be
lievability in order to present
clearly the world of Spanish poli
tics and the forces that have
dominated it since the beginning
of the Civil War in 1936. By giv
ing flesh to the ideals of revolu
tion and order in Franco's Spain,
he makes them real for those of
us who are not Spaniards and do
not share the heritage that gives
them power.
Herrick speaks with the au
thority of experience about the
life of Spain, in the underground
and the Establishment. His An
dalusia with its tradition and vio
lent nature is compelling and be
lievable.
William Herrick's Shadows
and Wolves is not a great novel;
there is some question as to
whether it is even a good novel.
But there is no doubt that it is an
interesting novel and one that
may have lasting value for those
who read it.
