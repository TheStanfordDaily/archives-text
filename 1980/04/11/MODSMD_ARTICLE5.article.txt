## Hillel Board blasts 'Palestinian Week' 
### Pat Carroll Staff Writer 
The Stanford Hillel Board of Direc
tors last night called the upcoming
Palestinian Awareness Week "biased
Palestinian propaganda" and charged
Rabbi Mark Cartun and two Hillel
members with "acting arrogantly and
immorally" by signing a letter an
nouncing the event.
Members said that they were not op
posed to negotiations with the Palesti
nian people but opposed Palestinian
Awareness Week and the Hillel sanc
tion because it was not discussed at the
board meetings nor publicized in the
student community.
More than 50 people attended the
meeting which voted overwhelmingly
to disavow the actions of the three
Hillel members.
Michael Wenocur read from a pre

pared statement which said that a cover
letter for Palestinian Awareness Week
was sent to Jewish community leaders
and signed by Cartun and Debbie De
nenberg, campus representative for
the American Zionist Youth Founda
tion (AZYF), Barry Bakin of the Israel
Action Committee and John
Rosenblum, an Israeli student.
Wenocur said that the letter falsely
portrayed the event as "humanitarian,
constructive and unbiased attempt to
understand the situation of the Palesti
nian Arabs."
"A closer examination of the prog
ram for the week shows it to be grossly
biased against Israel. The week is timed
to coincide with the U.N. debate on
amending Security Council Resolution
242, and is timed to end on Israeli In
dependence Day,"he said.
In the letter the three Hillel mem

bers called upon Jewish community
leaders to "involve ourselves with the
concerns of the Palestinian Arab
people . . . join with us in this week of
events . . . and join us in this venture to
learn, explore and offer criticism."
Wenocur said that there was no op
portunity for anyone to voice objec
tions to H illel involvement and charged
that one of the cosigners stated that the
Hillel involvement was intentionally
kept quiet in order to avoid any objec
tions from the Jewish community.
The letter was sent only to Jewish
leaders off-campus, not to Jewish stu
dents here.
"Those people who have used the
prestige of Hillei's name to support ac
tions which are harmful to Israel and
the Jewish people, and which they
knew would be vehemently opposed by
the vast majority of the Jewish com

munity, have acted arrogantly and im
morally," said YVenocur.
The hoard resolved that a letter from
the Hillel board be sent to all who re
ceived the letter on Palestinian Aware
ness Week and that the letter should
express the "complete lack of support
or consent of the Hillel board for this
action."
Member retracts
Denenberg issued a public retraction
of her support for the event and re
quested that her name be stricken from
the original announcement.
"I take full responsibility for signing
that letter. However, I wish it known
that I was opposed to the event from its
initial movement and signed reluc
tantly though voluntarily."
She said that she "rubber-stamped"
the letter to avoid impeding the efforts
of other Hillei members.
Cartun also issued a public statement
saying that "the Hillel Foundation has
not given administrative, logistic, fi
nancial nor other support, nor co
sponsorship to the Palestinian Aware
ness Week."
He said he discussed the program
"informally" with students active in
Hillel and felt that "it was better to
have this input into the program than
none at all."
"To clarify Hillel's present involve
ment with this program, the Israel Ac
tion Committee, the Israel Students
Organization and I are training
'monitors' to be present, both to ask
pointed questions and to record the lies
that we anticipate some of the speakers
will attempt," said Cartun.

the Jewish people, and which they
knew would be vehemently opposed by
the vast majority of the Jewish com

munity, have acted arrogantly and im
morally," said YVenocur.
The hoard resolved that a letter from
the Hillel board be sent to all who re
ceived the letter on Palestinian Aware
ness Week and that the letter should
express the "complete lack of support
or consent of the Hillel board for this
action."
Member retracts
Denenberg issued a public retraction
of her support for the event and re
quested that her name be stricken from
the original announcement.
"I take full responsibility for signing
that letter. However, I wish it known
that I was opposed to the event from its
initial movement and signed reluc
tantly though voluntarily."
She said that she "rubber-stamped"
the letter to avoid impeding the efforts
of other Hillei members.
Cartun also issued a public statement
saying that "the Hillel Foundation has
not given administrative, logistic, fi
nancial nor other support, nor co
sponsorship to the Palestinian Aware
ness Week."
He said he discussed the program
"informally" with students active in
Hillel and felt that "it was better to
have this input into the program than
none at all."
"To clarify Hillel's present involve
ment with this program, the Israel Ac
tion Committee, the Israel Students
Organization and I are training
'monitors' to be present, both to ask
pointed questions and to record the lies
that we anticipate some of the speakers
will attempt," said Cartun.
