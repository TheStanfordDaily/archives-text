The titles of Cynthia Macdonald's published books of poetry
give fair warning of their contents: first Amputations, Transplants,
and now (W)holes. Macdonald writes a poetry of the grotesque, of
freak circuses. She shocks with elaborate and highly self
conscious verbal virtuosity. She is the poetic daughter of Samuel
Beckett out of Sylvia Plath, and (W)holes is perhaps the most
carefully wrought collection to come out of this strain in American
poetry since Plath's Ariel.
Hie first sectiorf of (W)holes presents a gallery of freaks, pres
ided over by the ringmaster, Frances Bacon. Bacon figures here, I
believe, in his legendary role as the founder of modern science —
the founder, that is, of a system of knowledge that seeks to divide
the sensible world into parts and then put it back together again.
Everything in (W)hules is broken into pieces and often put back
together in strange ways. Even the poet herself is a grotesque
amalgam of parts: her mouth that speaks, her ear, her all-seeing
poet's eye do not make a whole human being. Instead they lie
separately on velvet cushions in the circus, "The Black Tent of
Marvels." Ralph Waldo Emerson, in his famous essay "The
Poet," said that the poet "stands among partial men for the
complete man." Macdonald sees herself rather as being more
courageous than others in facing her own incompleteness:
The eye is the most courageous organ because, in a sense,
It must always face itself. It lies in its moist socket.
The pot of seeing, and never says that what it sees in dream
Is less than what it sees. Image and imagination,
Those eyes indivisible.
In the deep of my eye, I see
To the edge of self (all those translucent pronouns)
And beyond into the dark quarter of the circle.
("Frances Bacon is the Ringmaster")
If she is "representative," us Emerson said the poet is, she is
representative of isolation. She stands, among freaks, for the
knowing and intelligent freak, capable of
forcing a little
Mutilation somewhere to set things right
To wreak penance
To set the freak flags flying.
("Celebrating the Freak")
Macdonald celebrates the freaks whose lives mock our passion
for order, coherence and precision. One of her best tales in this
section is the story of "The Kilgore Rangerette Whose Life Was
Ruined." Outwardly as normal as normal can be, the poor
Rangerette was plagued by freak accidents:
There we were that beautiful line, synchronized as
A row of pistons in an Eldorado. . .
I kicked with the wrong leg and the heel of
My white patent boot got caught in Marybelle's heel on the right
And we both fell and knocked into
The girls on either side of us who sprawled into
Others and half the line went down
Like a keyboard in a demo derby whacked by an axe.
Her parents and friends try to cover up for her, but she has too
many "problems of appearances" to ignore. The pressure is too
much for her, surrounded as she is with breakables, working in
"the fine crystal section at Neiman's." She finds a brilliant solu
tion to her problem: she becomes the only bag lady in Dallas,
Texas. Picking up other people's breakage and spare parts, "it's
not a bad life. No one expects grace or precision." It's easier to be
a freak, to "wear on the outside what other people wear on the
inside," than to risk exposure and humiliation.
Macdonald's poems work with outrageous associations, word
play and puns. She warns us that our usual methods of telling a
story, of creating order, of remembering our lives, "must be used
with caution." The stories of our lives tail us:

Eat one. Eat ten. They will not
Nourish. Hold up cold hands to them
On a night when the furnace fails.
They will not warm. Put them around
Your neck. They will hang, hut not
Embrace. Unrealistic expectations.
("Beads in a Red Box")
•Macdonald pulls familiar orders to pieces and reworks them
into ingenious new verbal patterns. She enjoys outrageous puns
("The Lady Pitcher," for example, rings every imaginable varia
tion on "picture") because they force such arbitrary and irrational
connections on us. If you think languageis a rational medium,
Macdonald says, just watch what 1 do with it. Language to Mac
donald is a finite set of symbols that do not enjoy a simple
one-to-one correspondence with reality. She refuses to tell a
simple story, to meet our unrealistic expectations with an illusion
of order. She insists on her right to surprise us with orders of her
own making. They are no more and no less arbitrary and irrational
than the orders we live with from day to day.
The last section of (W)holes is a long poem, "Burying the

Babies." It is a "mosaic hunchback," studded all over with broken
quotations from an amazing variety of sources. Macdonald quotes
from Lewis Thomas's The Lives of a Cell: "The word is out that
the sky is not limitless; it is finite." Within her finite enclosure,
Macdonald works, "arresting probabilities," finding that the
maps, guides and sextants no longer give directions. She holds on
to one recurring necessity, to "check the babies." If, at the end,
she doesn't give up altogether, it is for their sake.
We reach for each other
Even though we are losing our skin. Scurvy and
Dehydration, I guess. The holding on is
Painful, as the air is painful, and I do not think
I can let go. It is time
To look at the boxes. To check the babies.
The probability, however, is that the babies are buried and the
boxes their coffin. Not even the simplest order in human life, the
cycle of generations, is certain. No order is finally certain to
Cynthia Macdonald but the verbal order she creates with so much
ingenious despair.
