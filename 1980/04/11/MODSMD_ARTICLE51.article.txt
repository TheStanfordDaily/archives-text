Walter F. Starbuck. The man de
stined to become perhaps the
most famous of the Watergate
conspirators without ever even
stepping a foot off the printed
pages of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s
new novel. Jailbird.
Since rocketing himself out of
the underground with such out
rageous masterpieces as Break
fast of Champions and Cat's
Cradle. Kurt Vonnegut has con
tinued to titillate all of his
hardcore fans while adding mill
ions of new readers to the Von
negut snowball. Jailbird will
most certain!) keep that ball rol
ling.
ft is the stor\ of Walter F.
Starbuck. Harvard grad. Rhodes
scholar, communist and convict.
Blacklisted in the '50s by a \ oung
Senator Nixon and his cronies on
the Un-American Activities
Committee. Walter plods
through 15 \ears of melancholy
existence. Suddenly, he finds
himself hired out of pit\ by a new
President Nixon, to act as the

President's Special Advisor on
Youth Affairs. When Watergate
breaks. Walter goes down with
the big boys. But. with much less
to lose, having lost most of it long
ago, Walter then bobs back up
whilst his co-conspirators are
still wallowing in disgrace.
How he rises from a lowly
ex-con to become Vice-
President of RAMJAC Corpora
tion. the largest conglomeration
in the U.S.. is a delightfully
ridiculous tale with a uniquely
Vonnegut twist.
/True to his style, Vonnegut
uses plot only as a springboard
for his proverbial regressions,
digressions and rationality trans
gressions. In Jailbird, as in all his
other novels. Vonnegut uses his
wry sense of humor like a sur
geon's scalpel, cutting straight to
the absurd core of the American
way of life. Of his contem
poraries. onl\ Tom Robbins dis
play s a similar ability to zip off on
such skewed targets yet still hit
the target with such deadly accu
racy.
Vonnegut's primary target in
Jailbird is the sadistic selfishness
that capitalism breeds. One issue
to which he returns many times
throughout the novel is the plight
of the early labor unionists, in
particular the gross miscarriage
of justice which was the Sacco
and Vanzetti executions of the
late '20s. One cannot help but
suspect that Walter Starbuck is
Vonnegut himself, eternal advo
cate of the innocently naive
common man. As the President's
Special Advisor on Youth Af
fairs. Walter comments that the
w hole of his work could be sum
marized in one telegram:
Young people still refuse to see
the obvious impossibility of
world disarmament and
economic equality. Could be fault
of Sew Testament iQuod Vide).
Walter F. Starbuck
President's Special Advisor
on Youth Affairs
Some readers ma\ lament

that, in Jailbird, Vonnegut has
given up some of his radical
structure styles in favor of more
conventional methods. His chap
ters are larger than the one
paragraph. (sometimes one sen
tence) length characteristic of
Cat's Cradle, and are devoid of
the Vonnegut hard-drawn pic
tures of Breakfast of Champions
fame. Nor are there many of the
trademark Vonnegut science fic
tion themes. He does, however,
retain his disrespect for
chronological order, with his
amblings through time often
bridging entire generations in a
single bound.
Vonnegut also retains his own
bizarre brand of characters. He
has reincarnated his old favorite
kilgor Trout and created such
zany new figures as Mary Kath
leen O'Looney, the multimil
lionaire widow who carries her
life in shopping bags. sJeeps in
the subways and lives in constant
fear that someone will cut off her
hands to possess her fingerprints
— the ke\ to her vast wealth.
Walter himself is the epitome
of a Vonnegut character. He is a
morally conscious person who
finds himself being constantly,
often brutally, buffeted about by
the winds of fate. But he is
tenacious, and it is this resiliency
which one feels certain will in
sure Walter's ultimate survival.
With Jailbird. Vonnegut
seems much more focused and a
bit less frivolous than he has
been with his past novels. B\ no
means does this indicate he has
lost his sense for the ridiculous. It
just proves that even without the
crazy gimmicks Vonnegut still
stands out as one of the prime
black humorists in America to
day.

that, in Jailbird, Vonnegut has
given up some of his radical
structure styles in favor of more
conventional methods. His chap
ters are larger than the one
paragraph. (sometimes one sen
tence) length characteristic of
Cat's Cradle, and are devoid of
the Vonnegut hard-drawn pic
tures of Breakfast of Champions
fame. Nor are there many of the
trademark Vonnegut science fic
tion themes. He does, however,
retain his disrespect for
chronological order, with his
amblings through time often
bridging entire generations in a
single bound.
Vonnegut also retains his own
bizarre brand of characters. He
has reincarnated his old favorite
kilgor Trout and created such
zany new figures as Mary Kath
leen O'Looney, the multimil
lionaire widow who carries her
life in shopping bags. sJeeps in
the subways and lives in constant
fear that someone will cut off her
hands to possess her fingerprints
— the ke\ to her vast wealth.
Walter himself is the epitome
of a Vonnegut character. He is a
morally conscious person who
finds himself being constantly,
often brutally, buffeted about by
the winds of fate. But he is
tenacious, and it is this resiliency
which one feels certain will in
sure Walter's ultimate survival.
With Jailbird. Vonnegut
seems much more focused and a
bit less frivolous than he has
been with his past novels. B\ no
means does this indicate he has
lost his sense for the ridiculous. It
just proves that even without the
crazy gimmicks Vonnegut still
stands out as one of the prime
black humorists in America to
day.

Haldeman. Erlichman, Nixon
and Starbuck. Starbuck? Yes.
Walter F. Starbuck. The man de
stined to become perhaps the
most famous of the Watergate
conspirators without ever even
stepping a foot off the printed
pages of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s
new novel. Jailbird.
Since rocketing himself out of
the underground with such out
rageous masterpieces as Break
fast of Champions and Cat's
Cradle. Kurt Vonnegut has con
tinued to titillate all of his
hardcore fans while adding mill
ions of new readers to the Von
negut snowball. Jailbird will
most certain!) keep that ball rol
ling.
ft is the stor\ of Walter F.
Starbuck. Harvard grad. Rhodes
scholar, communist and convict.
Blacklisted in the '50s by a \ oung
Senator Nixon and his cronies on
the Un-American Activities
Committee. Walter plods
through 15 \ears of melancholy
existence. Suddenly, he finds
himself hired out of pit\ by a new
President Nixon, to act as the

President's Special Advisor on
Youth Affairs. When Watergate
breaks. Walter goes down with
the big boys. But. with much less
to lose, having lost most of it long
ago, Walter then bobs back up
whilst his co-conspirators are
still wallowing in disgrace.
How he rises from a lowly
ex-con to become Vice-
President of RAMJAC Corpora
tion. the largest conglomeration
in the U.S.. is a delightfully
ridiculous tale with a uniquely
Vonnegut twist.
/True to his style, Vonnegut
uses plot only as a springboard
for his proverbial regressions,
digressions and rationality trans
gressions. In Jailbird, as in all his
other novels. Vonnegut uses his
wry sense of humor like a sur
geon's scalpel, cutting straight to
the absurd core of the American
way of life. Of his contem
poraries. onl\ Tom Robbins dis
play s a similar ability to zip off on
such skewed targets yet still hit
the target with such deadly accu
racy.
Vonnegut's primary target in
Jailbird is the sadistic selfishness
that capitalism breeds. One issue
to which he returns many times
throughout the novel is the plight
of the early labor unionists, in
particular the gross miscarriage
of justice which was the Sacco
and Vanzetti executions of the
late '20s. One cannot help but
suspect that Walter Starbuck is
Vonnegut himself, eternal advo
cate of the innocently naive
common man. As the President's
Special Advisor on Youth Af
fairs. Walter comments that the
w hole of his work could be sum
marized in one telegram:
Young people still refuse to see
the obvious impossibility of
world disarmament and
economic equality. Could be fault
of Sew Testament iQuod Vide).
