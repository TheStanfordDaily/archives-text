Travels in Gay America

As the subtitle of Edmund
White's new book indicates,
States of Desire is about
"Travels in gay America." Be
fore writing. White travelled
the length and breadth of
America. As a result — and to
his credit — White reports on
gay life not only in such fam
ous gay meccas as San Fran
cisco, Fire Island and New
York, but places as straight
and typically American as
Kansas City and Boston. Not
surprisingly, he has unco
vered a world of astonishing
diversity. States of Desire
should go a long way to dispel
the stereotypes of gays as
bitchy drag queens with limp
wrists or "Castro Street
clones," an epithet alluding to
the übiquity of mustached
men with short hair and but
toned Levis to be seen saun
tering around the main street
of San Francisco's gay ghetto.
Indeed, White's descrip
tions of the wealth of diffe
rent lifestyles to be found in
different cities is perhaps its
most valuable feature. Most
Stanford students, I would
venture to say, know their
hometown and the Bay area,
and that's about it. Although
he calls New York home,
White avoids regional snob
bery and, as any thoughtful
traveller, he approaches each
new place with an open mind
and a spirit for adventure.
Thus, while writing about Los
Angeles. White doesn't harp
on L.A.'s alleged lack of cul
tural attractions, as many
Easterners are wont to do,
but rather points out how
much more relaxed and
easygoing life is here than in
the East. As White says,
"When I phoned a friend in
L.A. from New York one
morning, he said, "You sound
wired. Have you already had
six cups of coffee and a
hundred cigarettes?' I said I
had and asked if he was in a
similar state. 'No. Out here

there's no reason to gear up.
We're all laid-back.' "
White's book, however, is
not intended as another travel
book, like Gunther's Inside
America, but to show how
gays live in modern-day
America. And in this, he is
most successful. 1 would im
agine that any member of the
Stanford gay community
could profit from White's de
piction of the many different
worlds available to gay
Americans. Stereotypes not
withstanding, not all gays
spend their lives cruising by
day and discoing by night! In
Washington, D.C., for in
stance, White interviews lob
byists actively working for a
gay civil rights bill; despite
their sexual preference, they
live just as any other bureauc
rat in the comfortable sub
urbs outlying the capital. And
in Boston, we meet the radi
cals, gays who stick up for the
rights even of pedophiles —
that almost universally de
rided group — and who buy
tickets to hear Anita Bryant
speak, so as to heckle her all
the better. Of course, we see
Fire Island, the chief gay re
sort of New Yorkers, which,
in White's memorable
phrase, "offers an unrivaled
spectacle of gay affluence and
gay male beauty."
All America, however, is
not Fire Island or, for that
matter, Washington or Bos
ton, two cities where gays can
for the most part live in peace,
tolerated if not openly ac
cepted by their fellow citi
zens. As White suggests, time
and again, oppression still
scars gay life, despite the
great progress of the last de
cade. Thus in Houston, two
men or two women still can
not easily rent a one
bedroom apartment, and if
someone takes an apartment
and then moves a lover in,
both of them can be (and usu
ally are) evicted. Worse is
Kansas City, where during
the last Republican Conven
tion. cops threatened to arrest
homosexuals if any pro-gay
leaflets were handed out and.

on the previous Memorial
Day, had actually set up a
roadblock at an exit from a
gay event, questioned
everyone and eventually ar
rested 31 people. Interest
ingly, Kansas City is also the
international headquarters of
the Church of the Nazarene, a
fundamentalist sect, some of
whose members criticize
Anita Bryant for being too
liberal!
One of the joys of States of
Desire is its prose. While the
book is within the realm of

social science inasmuch as it is
an anthropology of a sub
culture. White avoids jargon
and writes as a novelist: his
hook flows and occasionally
even sings. Witness his evoca
tion of a warm day in San
Francisco: "It was a bright
summer day; if you touched a
brass rail you were aware how
hot the sun had become, how
much molten energy was
stored up in the metal, though
the cool salt breeze disguised
the heat and convinced you
that you were at sea, sailing.
The whole city seemed ex
cited, astir, leaning into the
wind, and, if you closed your
eyes, vou could almost hear

the flapping of sails."
White's writing also bet
rays a campy sense of humor.
An L.A. host telLs how he's just
spent a "typical L.A. day —
driving 150 miles to assemble
the twelve ingredients for
supper." While on the subject
of L.A.'s fascination with
cars, he discusses their special
symbolism for gays.
"Whereas the Mercedes
suggests what Oriental rugs,
antiques, a Hampton summer
share and an East Side ad
dress mean to New Yorkers, a
Porsche might be twinned
with spotlights trained on in
dustrial carpet, a signed Mao
poster, a ski house in Kil
lington and a Soho loft — the
Porsche, that is, announces in
conventional, even formulaic
terms, 'I am butch, an indi
vidualist, and I like excite
ment (and I'm rich, of
course).' The butchness is
inferred from the difficulty'of
handling this powerful car;
you must drive it, it won't
drive you." The leather set,
on the other hand, eschew
such elegant vehicles and pre
fer pickup trucks, vans, and
jeeps, which "spell M-A-
C-H-O, a condition that only
gay men and a few suburban
straights in Akron still aspire
to."
States of Desire is not with
out flaws. White himself ad
mits this in the epilogue. "1
criticize my book for concen
trating on gay men in big
cities and for ignoring les
bians as well as small-town or
rural life .... The book has
many other faults too. It
scants older men and married
men, it says nothing of gay
Asians or gay Jews, it largely
overlooks gay working-class
men." However this may be,
States of Desire is an intrinsi
cally important book. As
Madame de Stael said. Tout
comprendre rend tres indul
gent — To understand every
thing makes one tolerant.
White aids our understand
ing; we can only hope he does
the same for tolerance.
