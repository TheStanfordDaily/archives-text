American Gigolo if
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Richard Gere lives the high life
as a male whore — and writer
director Paul Schrader's going to
make sure you know it. Schrader's
voyeurism borders on obsession;
he's so wrapped up in capturing the
style of Gere's sterile naughtiness
that he doesn't have much time to
provide any insight. The sexual
kinkiness here doesn't even begin
to shock — it's probably all authen
tic, but Schrader makes the audi
ence feel more like peeping Tom's
than vital participants.
Schrader's fascination with Gere
is comparable to a fire-and
brimstone preacher's lusty, titillat
ing sermon on sin, and this finally
completely gets the better of him.
In a ludicrous and amateurish end
ing, Gere is convicted of a murder
he probably didn't commit; then in
a sudden rush of images, Schader
lets Gere off the hook.
It looks like Gigolo's going to
make Gere a sex symbol; that's a
little surprising, since the sexiness
developed around Gere is of the
decidedly limp variety — you can't
even enjoy being a peeping Tom
with a director like Schrader. With
a surprisingly competent Lauren
Hutton as the one woman Gere
seems to love.

Gone with the Wind ★★★★
New Varsity, Friday-Thursday
Best movie ever made.

Manhattan ★★ ★★
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9 p.m.
S'wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his '70s
trilogy with a movie that will rank
as one of the few masterpieces of
the last decade. Manhattan is a bit
terly funny examination of a city
and a lifestyle. It bites close enough
to the bone to be both hilarious and
oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy. Mariel Heming
way and Meryl Streep. Writen by
Woody Allen and Marshall
Brickman. Photography by Gor
don Willis. Music by George Ger
shwin.

Star Trek ★★
Century 22, San Jose
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
from tne world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A mechan
ical creation of man comes back to
haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
of the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilization by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex — is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner,
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen

they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest of the movie is
like a greatest hits of Douglas
Trumbull and John Dykstra's pre
vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.

Hide in Plain Sigh I ★★
Century 24, San Jose
The ads for this often interesting
little movie seem to hint that it's
just another of the Buford Pusser
style vigiante rip-offs, but James
Caan, in his debut as a director,
manages to avoid many of the
Walking Tall traps. The movie does
share the self-righteousness of such
movies, but Caan is a low-key di
rector, and he gets such subtle per
formances from his cast that the
movie develops a warmth that's to
tally alien to most vigilante pic
tures. Technically, the movie is un
even (particularly in its lighting and
editing), but that shouldn't scare
you off; the movie is a nice attempt
that'll be forgotten too soon.

10
Century 21, San Jose
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for lack
of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid-life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter,
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
bumbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek, that is. This poster-star just
may have found her "niche" as the
vacuous "10" the title refers to.
— R.L.

Norma Rae ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Martin Kitt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in a tex
tile mill where she works. Sally
Field gives an assured and very
likeable performance as Norma
Rae; her days as "the 112 lying Nun"
seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on charac
terization than on action. Ron
Liebman co-stars as a New York
union agitator.
—J.M.

Breaking A wav itirif
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to make his escape through
his talent on a bicycle.

Strangers on a Train iriririr
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This I 1 thriller ranks as one of
the best of Hitchcock's "Ameri
can movies. Ihe master's plotting
is a bit more complicated than
usual — an implicit homosexual is
even thrown in. Bruno (Robert
Walker, in a delicious perfor
mance) kills an unhappily married
stranger s wife, and he expects him
to return the favor by killing
Bruno s lather. Farley Granger
plays Guy, the stranger. Raymond
C handler helped on the screenplay.
Leo G. Carroll and Patricia Hitch
cock co-star. Ihe Lady Vanishes
makes up the second half of the
Hitchcock double bill.

Electric Horseman if it it
Park, Menlo Park
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of 'he
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $ 12-million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direcion is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★★
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate, almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, hut instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too near for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.L.
All That Jazz ★★★
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake

that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, hut it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man w ho's always on, a man of ta
lent w ho finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All That Jazz It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized
— R.L.
1941 ***
Century 21, San Jose
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front — bodies fly all too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very

harsh reaction ot most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, frenzied comedic action may
be horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Aykroyd.Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar

show as he tearfully watches Dis

Chapter Two **
\lenlo Cinema. Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-age divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-age
widower boy (James Caan); they
fall in love, thev marry, they have
problems, they resolve them, they
live happily ever after. (Yawn.)
But. like the previews indicate,
there are plenty of fairly good one
liners and even a moment here or
there that could be called touching.
Mason is her old goody-good self.
Caan should probably stick to his
macho roles but the movie's worth
a free night (if any of us ever had
one). A good one for Mom and
Dad.

Howard Hawks' frenetic style

it'll leave you feeling pleasurably
