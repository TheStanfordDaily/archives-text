Israeli military remains inside Lebanon
METULLA. Israel — Israeli troops who thrust into southern
Lebanon patrolled the mountainous border region yesterdav for
possible Palestinian guerrillas planning raids into Israel, a U.N.
spokesman said. Lebanon requested a U.N. Security Council ses
sion to discuss the "explosive situation" caused by the Israeli
presence.
Israeli military sources in Metulla, Israel's northernmost town,
defended the two-day-old Israeli incursion as strictly a defense
move aimed at keeping Palestinian guerrillas from crossing the
Lebanese-Israeli border to attack Jewish settlements as they did
Monday, killing three Israelis including a young bo>. The five
raiders were also killed,
In Metulla, Israeli military sources who asked not to be identified
by name said Israeli forces in Lebanon had not encountered guer
rilla squads or U.N. forces and there had been no firing.
Spokesmen forthe U.N. forces in Lebanon confirmed the report.
Meanwhile, sources at U.N. headquarters said the United States
was urging Israel to withdraw.
The United States charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv, William Brown,
met with Defense Minister Ezer Wei/man seeking "clarifications"
of Israeli intentions in Lebanon. No details of the meeting were
released.
Iraqi gov't expels thousands of Iranians
BAGHDAD — Iraq has deported 5700 Iranians over the past
few days and plans to expel as many as 20,000 in all within "one or
two weeks," a member of the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council said yesterday.
Council member Nairn Haddad said in an interview at the ruling
Barth Party's headquarters here that "we have deported Iranians
of Persian descent . . . who do not have Iraqi nationality."
But observers suggested that in some cases. Iraqi citizens whose
grandparents were Iranian nationals may have been deported as
well.
I he expulsions follow reports of a series of border skirmishes
between Iran and Iraq and a rising level of denunciation and
conflicting charges. Iran, for example, claimed yesterday that Iraq
already had expelled more than 25,000 Iranians.
This current clash between the two countries, whose thousands
of years of common history are marked with more bad blood than
good neighborliness, began April 1 with what Iraq claims was an
Iranian assassination attempt on Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz. Four
days later, there was a grenade attack during a funeral procession
tor the first attempt's victims.
Eyewitnesses report seeing as many as 500 Iranians, mostly
simple people, confined in a single bus depot in Baghdad that is
being used as one of many gathering points before they were
trucked to a central collecting area and transported to the Iranian
border.
Administration foresees food price hikes
W ASHINGTON — The Carter administration warned yester
day that the recent respite in food inflation may be coming to an
end. and predicted food prices will rise at a 10 percent annual rate
this quarter, double their January-March pace.
The forecast, issued by the Council on Wage and Price Stability,
also predicted cautiously that the rise in overall consumer prices
"may be less" in this April-June quarter than the 18 percent annual
rate of the January-March period, but declined to say how much.
Analysts said the end to the tentative price holiday in supermar
kets is expected to stem from a variety of factors, from increases in
energy costs to higher labor costs for processors and distributors.

Farm prices still are low.
Economists also noted that the month-long voluntary price
••freeze" that Esther Peterson, the president's consumer affairs
adviser, persuaded supermarket chains to impose last month, is
ending.
Specialists said many of the large grocery chains are expected to
boost prices more this month than they otherwise would have to
compensate for the freeze.
Administration economic strategists have been counting on con
tinued moderation in food prices to be a bulwark of the anti
inflation effort, and analysts said yesterday's predictions would not
necessarily upset those expectations.
Investigators study Hayward train crash
HAYWARD — Investigators questioned seven surviving train
crewmen and picked through the blackened rubble of a fiery wreck
yesterday that took two lives as three locomotives and a caboose
hurtled from an overpass into the street.
Western Pacific Railroad information officer Jack Burke said
attention, among other possibilities, focused on brakes that appear
to have been applied just before the accident Wednesday night in
south Hayward, 25 miles east of San Francisco.
The 125-ton. 3000-horsepower diesel locomotives and the car
toppled 25 feet to the street, releasing streams of flaming fuel oil on
the industrial area and spreading debris over a wide area. The
street, pocked with craters and chunks of asphalt, was closed for
repairs.
It took 25 Hayward firemen nearly two hours to control the fires,
which burned for some four hours. No traffic was in the street when
the units fell.
Witnesses said the locomotives ignited with loud explosions,
sending flames 40 feet into the air and enveloping the caboose. A
1 5,000-volt power line was snapped, blacking out the area.
Two crewmen were burned beyond recognition and crushed as
one of the locomotives landed on top of their caboose. The railroad
identified them as brakeman Mark Shipman, 30, and conductor
Eugene Obenshain. 45. both of Lodi.
Another two crewmen were hospitalized with burns and back
injuries, and a third treated and released.
Burke said it was theorized that the forward locomotive operator
may have applied the emergency brakes because "something was
on the tracks" ahead.

Israeli military remains inside Lebanon
METULLA. Israel — Israeli troops who thrust into southern
Lebanon patrolled the mountainous border region yesterdav for
possible Palestinian guerrillas planning raids into Israel, a U.N.
spokesman said. Lebanon requested a U.N. Security Council ses
sion to discuss the "explosive situation" caused by the Israeli
presence.
Israeli military sources in Metulla, Israel's northernmost town,
defended the two-day-old Israeli incursion as strictly a defense
move aimed at keeping Palestinian guerrillas from crossing the
Lebanese-Israeli border to attack Jewish settlements as they did
Monday, killing three Israelis including a young bo>. The five
raiders were also killed,
In Metulla, Israeli military sources who asked not to be identified
by name said Israeli forces in Lebanon had not encountered guer
rilla squads or U.N. forces and there had been no firing.
Spokesmen forthe U.N. forces in Lebanon confirmed the report.
Meanwhile, sources at U.N. headquarters said the United States
was urging Israel to withdraw.
The United States charge d'affaires in Tel Aviv, William Brown,
met with Defense Minister Ezer Wei/man seeking "clarifications"
of Israeli intentions in Lebanon. No details of the meeting were

Iraqi gov't expels thousands of Iranians
BAGHDAD — Iraq has deported 5700 Iranians over the past
few days and plans to expel as many as 20,000 in all within "one or
two weeks," a member of the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council said yesterday.
Council member Nairn Haddad said in an interview at the ruling
Barth Party's headquarters here that "we have deported Iranians
of Persian descent . . . who do not have Iraqi nationality."
But observers suggested that in some cases. Iraqi citizens whose
grandparents were Iranian nationals may have been deported as
well.
I he expulsions follow reports of a series of border skirmishes
between Iran and Iraq and a rising level of denunciation and
conflicting charges. Iran, for example, claimed yesterday that Iraq
already had expelled more than 25,000 Iranians.
This current clash between the two countries, whose thousands
of years of common history are marked with more bad blood than
good neighborliness, began April 1 with what Iraq claims was an
Iranian assassination attempt on Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz. Four
days later, there was a grenade attack during a funeral procession
tor the first attempt's victims.
Eyewitnesses report seeing as many as 500 Iranians, mostly
simple people, confined in a single bus depot in Baghdad that is
being used as one of many gathering points before they were
trucked to a central collecting area and transported to the Iranian
border.
Administration foresees food price hikes
W ASHINGTON — The Carter administration warned yester
day that the recent respite in food inflation may be coming to an
end. and predicted food prices will rise at a 10 percent annual rate
this quarter, double their January-March pace.
The forecast, issued by the Council on Wage and Price Stability,
also predicted cautiously that the rise in overall consumer prices
"may be less" in this April-June quarter than the 18 percent annual
rate of the January-March period, but declined to say how much.
Analysts said the end to the tentative price holiday in supermar
kets is expected to stem from a variety of factors, from increases in
energy costs to higher labor costs for processors and distributors.

Farm prices still are low.
Economists also noted that the month-long voluntary price
••freeze" that Esther Peterson, the president's consumer affairs
adviser, persuaded supermarket chains to impose last month, is
ending.
Specialists said many of the large grocery chains are expected to
boost prices more this month than they otherwise would have to
compensate for the freeze.
Administration economic strategists have been counting on con
tinued moderation in food prices to be a bulwark of the anti
inflation effort, and analysts said yesterday's predictions would not
necessarily upset those expectations.
Investigators study Hayward train crash
HAYWARD — Investigators questioned seven surviving train
crewmen and picked through the blackened rubble of a fiery wreck
yesterday that took two lives as three locomotives and a caboose
hurtled from an overpass into the street.
Western Pacific Railroad information officer Jack Burke said
attention, among other possibilities, focused on brakes that appear
to have been applied just before the accident Wednesday night in
south Hayward, 25 miles east of San Francisco.
The 125-ton. 3000-horsepower diesel locomotives and the car
toppled 25 feet to the street, releasing streams of flaming fuel oil on
the industrial area and spreading debris over a wide area. The
street, pocked with craters and chunks of asphalt, was closed for
repairs.
It took 25 Hayward firemen nearly two hours to control the fires,
which burned for some four hours. No traffic was in the street when
the units fell.
Witnesses said the locomotives ignited with loud explosions,
sending flames 40 feet into the air and enveloping the caboose. A
1 5,000-volt power line was snapped, blacking out the area.
Two crewmen were burned beyond recognition and crushed as
one of the locomotives landed on top of their caboose. The railroad
identified them as brakeman Mark Shipman, 30, and conductor
Eugene Obenshain. 45. both of Lodi.
Another two crewmen were hospitalized with burns and back
injuries, and a third treated and released.
Burke said it was theorized that the forward locomotive operator
may have applied the emergency brakes because "something was
on the tracks" ahead.

Council member Nairn Haddad said in an interview at the ruling
Barth Party's headquarters here that "we have deported Iranians
of Persian descent . . . who do not have Iraqi nationality."
But observers suggested that in some cases. Iraqi citizens whose
grandparents were Iranian nationals may have been deported as
well.
I he expulsions follow reports of a series of border skirmishes
between Iran and Iraq and a rising level of denunciation and
conflicting charges. Iran, for example, claimed yesterday that Iraq
already had expelled more than 25,000 Iranians.
This current clash between the two countries, whose thousands
of years of common history are marked with more bad blood than
good neighborliness, began April 1 with what Iraq claims was an
Iranian assassination attempt on Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz. Four
days later, there was a grenade attack during a funeral procession
tor the first attempt's victims.
Eyewitnesses report seeing as many as 500 Iranians, mostly
simple people, confined in a single bus depot in Baghdad that is
being used as one of many gathering points before they were
trucked to a central collecting area and transported to the Iranian
border.
Administration foresees food price hikes
W ASHINGTON — The Carter administration warned yester
day that the recent respite in food inflation may be coming to an
end. and predicted food prices will rise at a 10 percent annual rate
this quarter, double their January-March pace.
The forecast, issued by the Council on Wage and Price Stability,
also predicted cautiously that the rise in overall consumer prices
"may be less" in this April-June quarter than the 18 percent annual
rate of the January-March period, but declined to say how much.
Analysts said the end to the tentative price holiday in supermar
kets is expected to stem from a variety of factors, from increases in
energy costs to higher labor costs for processors and distributors.

Farm prices still are low.
Economists also noted that the month-long voluntary price
••freeze" that Esther Peterson, the president's consumer affairs
adviser, persuaded supermarket chains to impose last month, is
ending.
Specialists said many of the large grocery chains are expected to
boost prices more this month than they otherwise would have to
compensate for the freeze.
Administration economic strategists have been counting on con
tinued moderation in food prices to be a bulwark of the anti
inflation effort, and analysts said yesterday's predictions would not
necessarily upset those expectations.
Investigators study Hayward train crash
HAYWARD — Investigators questioned seven surviving train
crewmen and picked through the blackened rubble of a fiery wreck
yesterday that took two lives as three locomotives and a caboose
hurtled from an overpass into the street.
Western Pacific Railroad information officer Jack Burke said
attention, among other possibilities, focused on brakes that appear
to have been applied just before the accident Wednesday night in
south Hayward, 25 miles east of San Francisco.
The 125-ton. 3000-horsepower diesel locomotives and the car
toppled 25 feet to the street, releasing streams of flaming fuel oil on
the industrial area and spreading debris over a wide area. The
street, pocked with craters and chunks of asphalt, was closed for
repairs.
It took 25 Hayward firemen nearly two hours to control the fires,
which burned for some four hours. No traffic was in the street when
the units fell.
Witnesses said the locomotives ignited with loud explosions,
sending flames 40 feet into the air and enveloping the caboose. A
1 5,000-volt power line was snapped, blacking out the area.
Two crewmen were burned beyond recognition and crushed as
one of the locomotives landed on top of their caboose. The railroad
identified them as brakeman Mark Shipman, 30, and conductor
Eugene Obenshain. 45. both of Lodi.
Another two crewmen were hospitalized with burns and back
injuries, and a third treated and released.
Burke said it was theorized that the forward locomotive operator
may have applied the emergency brakes because "something was
on the tracks" ahead.
