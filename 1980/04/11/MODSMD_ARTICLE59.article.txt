## 
### Pat Carroll Staff Writer 
A nation of four million, they have
no land of their own. Many Americans
regard them as nomadic terrorists. sa\ -
agely bent on the destruction of Israel.
Others see them as "refugees seeking a
homeland." They are the Palestinians.
Which perception is true? Neither?
Both? In an effort to more clearly de
fine the disparity between the two. stu
dents in a SWOPSI class called "Who
Are the Palestinians" have tried to ans
wer that question. Starting Monday
they are presenting a six-day sym
posium, "Palestinian Awareness

Week." in an effort to dispel the myths
surrounding the Palestinian people and
to ""examine those aspects of Palesti
nian culture and history that get lost in
the emotional and polemical argu
ments surrounding the issue." accord
ing to a press release.
The issue ispeace in the Middle East.
What are the facts behind the "Palesti
nian problem" and the increasing divi
sion among both American and Israeli
Jews concerning the Palestinians?
What has contributed to the growing
image of Palestinians as "the Jews of
the Arab world?"
John Rosenblum, coordinator of

Palestinian Awareness Week, is an Is
raeli Jew. He explained that the Pales
tinian question is "a moral problem."
"In 1936 and '37 the rest of the
world stood by and talked about a
Jewish problem and in the end six mill
ion Jews were dead." Rosenblum said.
"The arguments that people put
forth to deny the formation of a Pales
tinian state are the same arguments
that were used to deny the formation of
the Jewish state 32 years ago." he said.
The coordinators of "Palestinian
Awareness Week" believe that
"change is made by causing people to
see their opponents in any conflict as

reasonable human beings with whom it
is possible to come to a resolution of
the conflict."
Rosenblum stressed that although
the Palestinian Liberation Organiza
tion (PLO) is the sole representative of
the Palestinian people, all Palestinians
are not "terrorists."
"The PLO is an outgrowth of the
Palestinian nation, not the other way
around." he said. He said that there has
always been a lack of political leader
ship among the Palestinians which was
encouraged by former colonizers of
Palestine (Turks, British, Jordanians
and Israelis)

Highlights of the week include Prof.
Joel Migdal of the Center of Interna
tional Affairs at Harvard University.
The topic will he "Palestinian Society:
Continuity and Change in the Twen
tieth Century. Meyer Forum Room;

Elias Tumas, Economics Prof, at
