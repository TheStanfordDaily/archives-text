LIMA, Peru — Five South
American countries agreed yes
terday to take in some of the
thousands of Cubans who
flocked into the Peruvian em
bassy in Havana seeking help to
leave the country.
"It can't be done in five mi
nutes, but we are trying to do it as
quickly and efficiently as possi
ble." Ecuador's Foreign Minis

ter Alfredo Pareja said after an
emergency meeting of the An
dean Council.
Peruvian Foreign Minister Ar
turo Garcia y Garcia said Peru
was ready to receive 11)00 per
sons. He said he could not com
ment on how many other council
members or other countries
would take.
"Each country will make its
own announcement." he said.
In a joint statement the coun

cil said Cuba was responsible for
what had happened, but that it
was the obligation of the rest of
the world to help the refugees.
Pareja is president of the
council — political arm of the
Andean Group common market
of Bolivia. Colombia, Ecuador,
Peru and Venezuela.
Garcia confirmed that offers
had been received from nations
outside the Andean region, al
though he would not identifv

them.
In Washington, President
Jimmy Carter has expressed
sympathy for the Cubans' desire
to flee Fidel Castro's communist
regime, but made no commit
ment to accept refugees. State
Department officials did say they
would consider applications
from refugees who managed to
reach Lima.
The Peruvian Foreign Minis
ter said the embassy in Havana
had registered the names and
backgrounds of the 6300 re
fugees as of Wednesday.
Pareja said "international
agencies" had offered to prov ide
airplanes and personnel for the
evacuation.
Speaking to reporters at Lima
airport before returning to
Quito. Pareja said Peru would
not necessarily be the first coun
try to receive refugees, although
Garcia had been appointed
coordinator of the operation.
An estimated 10.000 Cuban
refugees jammed the Peruvian

compound in Havana after the
government withdrew its sec
urity force from around the dip
lomatic headquarters.
The Cuban action was taken in
retaliation for what the Cuban
Foreign Ministry said was Peru
vian encouragement of exiles
who had forced their way past
Cuban police to enter the em
bassy. A Cuban guard was killed
April 1 when six persons in a bus
crashed through the compound
gate seeking asylum inside.
The Cuban government has
called the throng at the embassy
"vagrants and bums" and said
they could emigrate. But it has
restored the guard at the em
bassy.
A spokesman for the U.S. in
terest section at the Swiss Em
bassy in Havana said Cuban au
thorities were supplying food
and sanitary facilities at the
Peruvian compound and had al
lowed the Red Cross to set up a
field clinic.
