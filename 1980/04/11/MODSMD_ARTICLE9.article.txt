# U.S. analyzes Iran's military

### Michael Getler The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Though
Iran's Ayatollah Khomeini has
put his Army on "alert" and ail
led for the overthrow of Iraq's
government. Iran's once
powerful military forces would
probably lose an all-out struggle
with their heavily armed Islamic
neighbors to the west.
That is the cautious assess
ment of U.S. specialists monitor
ing the escalating war of words
between Tehran and Baghdad
and reports of skirmishes along
the 800-mile long Iran-Iraq bor
der.
Iran's military machine — in
the shah's day the most powerful
in the Persian Gulf region — has
deteriorated badly in the year
long turmoil that began with his
ouster.
Purges of officers and deser
tion in the ranks have brought
the Army down to what U.S.
specialists believe is now less
than half its former size.
Many of the sophisticated jet
fighter planes and big warships
bought from the United States in
the mid-1970s can't fly or sail for
lack of maintenance, spare parts
and skilled technicians. Even
when planes do get into the air.
sources say, the complicated
missile bombing systems that
make them effective can't always
be operated.
The deterioration of Iran's
military strength has basically al
lowed Iraq, equipped with a
Soviet-supplied tank corps that
is the largest in the Arab world,
to emerge as the dominant com
bat force in the region in terms of

land armies.
Nevertheless, the U.S. as
sessment of how things would
end in an all-out war — which
specialists he-e do not vet be
lieve is likely — is cautious for
several reasons.
For one thing, U.S. intelli
gence information on the region
is sharply reduced from the days
under the shah when there were
1000 U.S. military advisers in
Iran and thousands of techni
cians and other Americans in the
area.
Second both countries under
their present rulers are ex
tremely secretive, with decisions
from the personalities of Kho
meini or Iraq's President Sad
dam Hussein rather than from
Western-style military logic.
Because the Iranian Army had
been most inv olv ed of all the ser
v ices with internal security under
the shah, it has been riddled most
heavily by purges and defections.
From its pre-revolutionary size
of some 285,000 troops. U.S.
analvsts estimate it is now down
to about 120,000 to 130,000
men.
There are virtually no Army
generals or Navy admirals that
survived the revolution within
the military, sources say. so
trained leadership, discipline
and the ability to control units
has decreased.
Upheaval was most severe in
the early months of the 1979 re
volution. but U.S. specialists say
the Iranian Army actually has
improved faster from that low
point than analysts here had ex
pected.
Much of the Armv communi

cations system is still intact, and
the Army has shown itself able to
move into outlying provinces.
The Army can still move some
of its tank force, built around al
most 900 British Chieftain tanks,
but many of the tanks are be
lieved to be either out of opera
tion or unable to operate their
guns or fire control systems ef
fective! v.
