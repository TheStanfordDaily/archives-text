/NO CREDIT GRADING
POLICY OF THE

MATHEMATICS
The Department of Mathematics has a deadline for

sity. In those undergraduate Mathematics courses
where +/NC grading is offered, the deadline is before
the end of the third week of the quarter — specifically,
no later than 4p.m., Friday, April 18 and the request
for + /NC grading must be made formally, in writing,
on a petition form provided by the Department of
Mathematics.
For more detailed information, consult with your
Mathematics instructor and read the memorandum
on +/NC grading that is posted on bulletin boards in
the Department of Mathematics (Building 380).
