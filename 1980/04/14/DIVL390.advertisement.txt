Friday Forum:
The presidential primary -
is there a better way?
Has the current presidential primary worked well as a reli
able and fair means of choosing candidates? Or do the current
front-runners for party nominations reflect the failure of our
primary system to pick able, honest and intelligent leaders?
Is it fair that some states, such as New Hampshire, can hold
early primaries that bring more attention and possibly more
political power to their citizens? And should winner-take-all
rules and caucus sy stems in some states be scrapped — perhaps
in favor of a national primary?
Express your opinion in this Friday's Forum. Columns and
letters should be sent to the Stanford Daily, Storke Publica
tions Building, by noon Wednesday. All contributions should
be typed, double-spaced, on a 57-space line and are subject to
editing.
