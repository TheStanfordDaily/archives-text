for threshold projects
' in tomorrow's technology
,' Those who prefer a creative type of work rather than
routine assignments, should investigate these openings.
All are in areas of technology at — or beycnd — the cur
rently accepted limits of the state-of-the-art. All offer the
, 7 right individual opportunities for significant achievement,
intellectual growth and professional recognition.
United Technologies Corporation ranks among the top
l> ' six in this country in private funding for research and
i: development activities. This very substantial financial
■ backing — $545 million in 1979 — has resulted in a re
search environment with the sophisticated equipment
and complementary services so essential for creative
work in advanced areas of high technology.
