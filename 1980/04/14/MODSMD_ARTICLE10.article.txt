# Olympics boycott a reelection pawn?
## USSR accuses Carter of blackmail 
### Dan Fisher The Los Angeles Times 
MOSCOW â€” The Soviet
Union yesterday depicted the
U.S. Olympic Committee's deci
sion to boycott the 1980 Moscow
Games as being the result of
"unprecedented pressure and
blackmail" by an American pres
ident intent on parlaying anti-
Soviet feelings into another four
years in the White House.
The USOC vote was reported
here last night, both by the offi
cial Tass news agency and by
television on the country's main
evening news program.
Tass, in a dispatch from its San
Francisco correspondent, Vyas
cheslav Chernyshev, reported
that the boycott vote, which pas
sed by a 2-1 margin, was ap
proved desite the fact "the over
whelming majority of sportsmen
and broad sections of the public
in the country resolutely op
posed the use of sports in Presi
dent (Jimmy) Carter's political
game in his election campaign."
The Tass correspondent ac
cused the White House of acting
"in the spirit of the worst kind of
McCarthyism" by threatening

legal and financial penalties if
the committee failed to go along
with the boycott. The dispatch
also quoted extensively from
angry statements made by
American athletes and officials
opposed to the decision.
Television coverage was con
fined to a two-sentence com
mentary referring to "unpre
cedented pressure and
blackmail" by the White House.
The Soviet reaction did not
deviate from the line that the
Kremlin has used during the last
several weeks leading up to the
U.S. boycott vote. It is believed
that the Soviet leadership has as
sumed for at least that long that
the American team would not be
coming to Moscow and has fo
cused its propaganda efforts on
trying to sway the rest of the
world to show up for the Summer
Games.
Moscow has ottered financial
aid to Third World nations that
want to send teams to the Olym
pics, and is particularly con
cerned that the major sporting
nations of Western Europe and
Japan show up.
As the Soviets see it.the action

will boomerang against
Washington if the United States
is the only major nation to
boycott the Games. It would
allow Moscow to use the Olym
pics as a stage on which to depict
the United States as foiled reac
tionary power, increasingly out
of touch with the mood and aspi
rations of the rest of the world.
The Soviets have alst? been
working quieth behind the
scenes to persuade the Interna
tional Olympic Committee to
change its rules so that individual
athletes from boycotting nations
might be able to attend the
Games without the sponsorship

of their national Olympic Com
mittee. The lOC' is expected to
consider such a change at a meet
ing in Geneva later this month.
If individual American
athletes were to show up next
summer, it would be seen here as
a further propaganda bonanza
for Moscow.
While the Moscow Olympic
Organizing Committee had no
comment on the USOC vote here
yesterday, the committee vice
president, Vladimir Popov, said
in Budapest, Hungary that the
decision was "regrettable,"
mostly for the Americans them
selves.

The official Soviet press has
been telling the domestic audi
ence here ever since January that
the great majority of athletes and
citizens from capitalist, as well as
socialist nations, think the
Games should go on.
It only indirectly acknow
ledges the link between the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and President Carter's call for an
Olympic boycott. Afghanistan,
according to the official line, is
only a pretext: What Carter is
really trying to do is rally the
American people behind his
reelection by manufacturing a
Soviet threat that doesn't exist.
