TURIN. Italy (AP) â€” Pope
John Paul 11. speaking y esterday
to a throng of 500.000 people in
this terrorism-plagued city, ap
pealed to the government and

the church to end violence at its
roots by eliminating injustice
and privilege.
The pope, who called Turin
"one of the nerve centers of ter
rorism," responded to the 13
deaths and hundreds of terrorist
kneecappings and bombings of
the past two years. He Hew to
this center of Italy's automaking
industry for a 13-hour visit and
to warn that indiscriminate kil
ling has become "a system."
"Men abundantly kill other
men," he lamented. "They kill in
homes, in offices, in the univer
sity. Men armed with modern
weapons kill undefended and in
nocent men."
In his most extensive speech to
date on violence, the 59-year
old pontiff wondered if material
progress would eventually lead
to "gigantic and programmed
death of man."
The religious high point of the
trip came at noon when a cathed
ral custodian opened a red linen
cloth inside a silver casket con
taining the Holy Shroud, a cloth
some say wrapped Christ's body
after it was removed from the
cross.
The white-robed pontiff knelt
to kiss the shroud in the darkness
of St. John the Baptist Cathed
ral.
