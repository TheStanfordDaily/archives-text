# Foreign policy dictates Iraq's border restraint
## 
### Jonathan Randal The Washington Post 
BAGHDAD, Iraq — Domestic and foreign
policy considerations — rather than purely military
reasons — are believed to be dictating Iraq's rela
tive restraint in the current border tension with
Iran.
In refraining from smashing archrival Iran's
much weakened armed forces, Iraq's reasoning is
so well understood in Iran that Tehran enjoys a
virtually free hand in acting out a classic foreign
diversion at its western border to distract its public
from growing domestic problems.
Barring an unforeseen accident, the border ten
sion is not expected to escalate into serious fight
ing. much less a full-scale war, largely because of
Iraqi restraint.
On paper, Iraq's 200,000-man armed forces are
well trained, disciplined and equipped. They far
outmatch their Iranian rival, whose once proud
reputation as the Mideast's second most popular
war machine after Israel is now yet another victim
of the Islamic revolution.
But even if the Iranian calls for the Iraqi armed
forces to overthrow their rulers may be wishful
thinking, the Baghdad authorities cannot be en
tirely sure of their Shi'a Moslem soldiers' sym
pathies for Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's siren
calls.
The Iraqi officer corps is believed to he largely
drawn from the ruling Sunni Moslem minority in
Iraq. No breakdown of Shi'a strength among the
enlisted men has ever been published, but the Shi'a
make up an estimated 55 percent of the Iraqi popu
lation of just under 15 million.
Only Saturday pro-Khomeini elements were be
lieved responsible for a still unannounced bomb
attack on the information ministry in which seven
people were injured.
Earlier in the month at least three persons died
in a grenade attack on Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz and a second attack against a funeral
procession mourning the victims of the first assault.
Yet diplomats here also credit Iraqi officials with
understanding that Iranian president Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr is seeking to use the border tension to
shore up his much-battered authority following his
inability to persuade Khomeini to transfer the U.S.
Embassy hostages to government control.
Despite public statements to the contrary, the
Iraqi leadership is believed quite content with the
present weakened state of Iran and understands

the risks of Soviet penetration and left-wing influ
ence if that country were to fly apart, according to
diplomats.
Iraq's preferred policy is maintaining just
enough aid to keep stirring up national minorities
among the Baluchis, Turkomans, Kurds and Arabs
of oil-rich Khuzestan to avoid a crusade for na
tional unity.
Moreover, any outright invasion of Iran — or
even increasing the basically limited support for
pin-prick actions by Iran's national minorities —
risks compromising Iraq's carefully burnished
image as the champion of Arab-world and non
aligned unity.
President Saddam Hussein has embarked on a
policy of prestige — spending tens of millions of
dollars on luxury hotels, a conference center and
even an opera house — in preparation for the I 982
non-aligned summit conference, which he is host
ing.
That policy entails dropping the old Iraqi eye
for-an-eye retribution image in dealing with
neighbors, although Iraq apparently has no com
punctions about expelling 20.000 Iranian residents
here.
Despite the Baghdad propaganda machine's
constant harping on the "malevolent" Persians'
provoking the Arab nation. Iraq's fellow Arab re
gimes — and the Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion so glorified here — have been reluctant to
criticize Khomeini's revolution.
Baghdad does not really expect Iran to accede to
demands to evacuate three strategic Arab islands
near the Straits of Hormuz occupied in 1971, or to
return the Shatt-al-Arab estuary to purely Iraqi
control as was the case before 1975.
Despite his hatred for the Iraqi regime for expel
ling him in 1978, Khomeini seems aware that
large-scale subversion here could bring about re
tribution far in excess of the Kurd expulsions.
As the self-styled leader of the Shi'a Moslems
and a man who lived here in exile for 14 years,
Khomeini is well aware how Iraqi authorities could
react if they chose to be nastier.
As one veteran diplomat put it: "Basically, Iraq
has already won the war. TTie shah's Iran was a
strong state militarily capable of hurting Iran
badly.
"But today — and probably for the next 10 to 15
years — Iran is not a threat to Iraq, which could use
the peace and quiet to capitalize its potential for
economic and political growth.
