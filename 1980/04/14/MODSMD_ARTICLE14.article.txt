"I the library and a sunny spring
day created the program for the
dedication of Stanford's new
$14.7 million Cecil 11. Green lib
rary Friday afternoon.
Jaroslav Pelikan, Sterling
Prof, of History at Yale Univer
sity. was the featured speaker.
His address "Jarrow on the
Pacific: The Research Library,
an Outpost of Cultural Con
tinuity" compared Green Lib
rary to the monastery of the 13th
century Venerable Bede which
helped bridge the cultural and in
tellectual gap created during the
Dark Ages.
Hailing research as "the
greatest indoor sport in the
world," Hildegarde Tolamn
Teilhart, chairman of the As
sociates of the Stanford Univer
sity Libraries, presented the new
research library with a complete
13th century manuscript of
Ovid's "Metamorpheses" on

behalf of her group. The Stan
ford Ovid makes the University
the second U.S. university to
own one of the 50 rare manus
cripts,
The Green Library, with a
1,191,149 hook capacity, in
cludes the old west wing hereto
fore known as Main Library,
constructed in 1919, and the new
east wing. Construction of the
new wing began in February
1977 and the new structure was
opened this January. According
to the dedication program, the
west wing will be renovated and
will continue to house many lib
rary facilities.
Cecil H. Green and his wife
Ida were present at the dedica
tion ceremony. Although not a
Stanford graduate. Green
explained his reason for becom
ing the major benefactor of the
new library as an ever-increasing
interest in satisfying the "broad
needs of Mankind."
A library "illuminates future
frontiers of thought" and gives
"life beyond life" to people of

each generation by providing the
culmination of knowledge of the
past and allowing the future to
use knowledge gained today, he
said.
Green is a cofounder of Texas
Instruments, Inc. and he and his
wife have supported Stanford
fellowships and professorships in
geophysics and have contributed
to other institutions.
Peter Bing, president of the
University Board of Trustees,
concluded the dedication by not
ing the importance of a research
library to society as a whole. For
although only educated
specialists can make full use of a
library like Green, Bing said, the
bulk of society looks to these
specialists for the transmission of
the knowledge found in libraries.
Others taking part in the dedi
cation were President Richard
Lyman, David Weber, director
of the University Libraries and
Michael Jameson, professor of
classics and chairman of the
Academic Council Committee
on Libraries.
