### Kathleen McClung Staff Writer 
Media depictions of women
"misrepresent" women's roles in
society, television producer Vir
ginia Carter told a noon audi
ence Wednesday in Terman Au
ditorium.
"As women, we're not being
presented in the media. When
we are, our lives are presented in
a distorted fqrm of reality," Car
ter said in the first lecture of a
series entitled " Hie Media View
Women: Women View the
Media."
Carter vice president of crea
tive affairs for Tandem Produc
tions. was the first speaker of the

spring lecture series sponsored
by the Center for Research on
Women (CROW).
-She pointed out that the ratio
of male to female actors in televi
sion commercials is 63 percent to
37 percent and 72 percent of all
acting roles in prime-time prog
rams are male roles.
"Our lives are misrepresented
in the media. One third of the
female characters on television
are between the ages of 25 and
34. Only 19 percent of female
characters are married and work
ing, while 42 percent of real
women are married and work
ing."
Carter noted also some typical

TV Guide descriptions of women
characters: "wanton woman,"
"restless housewife," "kooky
co-ed," "voluptuous secretary"
and "beautiful, widowed mid
wife."
Carter said it is frustrating that
"very few of the movers and
shakers in the media are women.
There are 2830 male members of
the Writer's Guild in Hollywood
and only 150 women. In the Di
rector's Guild there are 3340
men and 20 women, and in the
Producer's Guild there are 3060
men and only eight women.
"The pressures in the televi
sion industry are absolutely
enormous. We work on a fast.

frenetic shooting schedule. Pro
ducers are constantly near the
point of emotional collapse. I'd
guess that Hollywood supports
NO percent of the country's
psychiatrists."
"Consequently, the people in
the industry are survivors. They
tend to be older, male, Cauca
sian. They have a skewed view of
life and they tend to be
chauvinist about their turf."
According to Carter, this fact
explains why it has been difficult
for women to begin and continue
careers within the industry, and
why many of the stereotypes
about women are perpetuated in
television.

"In Hollywood, we need to he
pushed to see the longrange im
pact of our work. Otherwise the
focus will stay on getting through
next week's script."
To bring about change from
outside the television industry,
Carter suggested actions ranging
from lobbying to letter-writing
to suing.
"If you're on the inside, speak
up. You have to stick fiercely to a
point of view. This is lonely, of
course. I sometimes go home cry
ing. but that's okay because it
keeps stomach ulcers from flar
ing up."
