# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial How about a mascot 
### 
A resolution, aimed at formulating a
consensus-building framework in which to
resolve the University athletic team mascot
dilemma, will appear on tomorrow and
Wednesday's ASSU spring ballot. If sup
ported by 50 percent of those voting in the
election, the measure will allow for the
ASSU to hold a binding referendum on the
mascot issue.
In such a referendum. 60 percent of the
students voting would have to agree on one
mascot choice for that mascot to be sent to
the University administration for final ap
proval. As for all ASSU elections, 20 per
cent of the student body would have to vote
on the measure in order to certify the elec
tion. Each mascot proposal would require
petitions signed by 10 percent of registered
students before it could be placed on the
ballot.
We support this resolution and hope
voters will approve it this week.
In this case, more than in many, clear
administration acceptance of the voters
choice is necessary for a final solution to
the situation. We could not expect the Uni
versity to lend its name in any official
capacity to a mascot it finds unacceptable.
We are also confident the administration
will find that it would carry a heavy burden
of proof in overruling a student consensus
choice.
And the 60 percent figure, while seem
ingly random, seems to us a reasonable, but
not unreachable point. A lesser percentage
would enable one choice to narrowly
squeeze by and a larger figure would make
it unreasonably difficult for one choice to
ever prevail.
The current dissatisfaction with Cardi
nals as the Stanford symbol has led to the
rise and fall over the years of Robber Bar-

Rons, Trees, Griffons, Sequoias and other
mascot ideas.
We support this resolution, not out of
disdain for Cardinals, but because it pre
scribes a procedure by which the students
can choose what, if any, mascot choice they
prefer to the status quo. Whatever choice is
one day arrived at, we can live and work
with it and so too should the rest of the
University community. In supporting this
resolution, students should realize that if
their own favorite mascot looses on elec
tion day. a stubborn refusal to adopt the
chosen mascot will negate the entire pro
cedure. With mascots, as with democrati
cally chosen people or policies, those in the
minority will have to live with the majori
ty's wish.
A final decision on this controversy will
also allow incoming students to arrive here
and find an agreed upon mascot choice,
thereby eliminating the confusion and in
decision that they would face. Many
freshmen here have said that had there
only been a clear-cut University mascot,
they would have adopted it.
Finally, an end to this issue will also help
put to rest the ridiculous antics and time
wasting efforts of those ill-informed stu
dents, alumni and other fans who continue
to support the only mascot that is totally
unacceptable to us: the Indian. The sooner
the anachronistic supporters of this sham
end their persistent rabble rousing, the
sooner the fans of Stanford athletics will be
able to concentrate their energy on the
teams.
We hope you will support the mascot
referendum resolution and help bring an
end to the current hodgepodge of alterna
tives.
