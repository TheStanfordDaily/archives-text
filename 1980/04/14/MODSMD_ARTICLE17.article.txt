Chaparral needs you
During the Great Depression,
only three businesses boomed in
this country: movies, miniature
golf and the Chaparral. The
economic indicators are in — the
U.S. economy is soon to col
lapse. And when the economy is
depressed, chances are you'll be
depressed. That's where we
come in — the Chaparral. Our
job is to make you happy.
But we can't do it alone. We
need your help . . . now, while
you can still give it.
The Chaparral is currently ex
panding to meet your need for

humor during the economic
catastrophe and ensuing social
upheaval that threaten to wrack
American society in the upcom
ing months. Here's what we plan
to do to ease the transition:
1) Roll back our prices by 25
cents an issue. That might not
seem like much now, but in a few
years .. . you're going to need
that spare change.
2) Bigger issues. We will not
compromise our quality. Our
current issues are typically 48
pages. With passage of our $ 1 fee
assessment, we will serve you
with 64 pages of sturdy 60-
pound coated offset, a full Btyj by

11 inches each, saddle stitched to
a four color, photographically
separated cover.
3) We're going to bring back
the movies. By almost doubling
its projectionist fees to an exor
bitant $32.50 an hour, the Uni
versity made it impossible for us
to continue our regular Saturday
night films this year. But with the
passage of our fee assessment,
we will resume the film series,
despite its inherent economic
risks.
We will not allow this fee as
sessment to soften us. Our staff
will continue to be unpaid and un
fed. (No Togo sandwiches are
served at our staff meetings!)
The Chaparral fee assessment:
"We're not asking for a hand out
— just a helping hand."

Support VIA fee
We hope that students will
weigh the value of Volunteers in
Asia (VIA) as a resource for
everyone at the University when
they vote on fee assessments this
week.
VIA is a unique resource at
Stanford; in fact, no other uni
versity in the country has a prog
ram quite like VIA. Its student
orientation, its low budget and
lack of a university subsidy, and
its growing reputation in Asia
(and, for its appropriate
technology work, throughout the
world) make it unique. In keep
ing with its strictly private, non
profit nature, VIA does not ac
cept U.S. government or corpo
rate funds.
Here at home, VIA benefits
the University community by br
inging to campus occasional
speakers (such as Don Luce on
Cambodia) and films (like Max
Havelaar, showing in May), giv
ing many of us a better under
standing of Asia. This year, its
SWOPSI course on appropriate
technology attracted 80 stu
dents.
Just recently, VIA was ex
tended an invitation to send vol
unteers to the People's Republic
of China. This means that Stan
ford has become one of only two
universities in the United States
whose students have an oppor
tunity to live and work in-China.
In order to get the China prog
ram off the ground, VIA is ask
ing for a one-quarter, $1 fee as
sessment. We hope our fellow
students will give VIA the sup
port it needs to take full advan
tage of the opportunity the
Chinese invitation affords, and
will allow VIA to continue pro
viding Stanford with a unique
and valuable resource.
