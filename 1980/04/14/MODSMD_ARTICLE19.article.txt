## Conscientious objector status flexible 
### 
In Jeff Lepape's article (Daily, April 3)
"Don't abuse conscientious objection." he
would have us believe that he knows what a
conscientious objector really is, but he actu
ally has grossly misinterpreted a crucial U.S.
Supreme Court definition of the conscienti
ous objector (CO). In the case of Welsh vs.
United States inJune of 1970, the high court
deleted the word "religious" as the sole
criterion in its definition of the CO. The
court said:
I fan individual deeply and sincerely holds
beliefs which are purely ethical or moral in
source and content hut which nevertheless
impose upon him a duty of conscience from
participating in war at any time, those beliefs
certainly occupy in the life of that individual a
place parallel to that filled by . . . God.
To present the argument more simply, a
CO must only feel a duty of conscience not to
enter the armed forces. Welsh qualified for
CO status even without holding religious be
liefs. This is contrary to Lepape's statement
that "it is still necessary to have a deeply
rooted religious belief' in order to qualify for
CO staus.
A sincere and meaningful belief that oc
cupies a place in an individual's life compar
able with that of a ieligious belief is what is
required. This can include moral and

philosophical objection. Instead of positing a
personal God whose existence can neither be
proved or disproved, the ethical concept ot
God is founded in human experience. It is
anthropocentric, not theocentric. Religion,
for all the various definitions that have been
given to it, is in the end a devotion of man to
the highest ideal he can conceive.
The question a person who considers him
self a CO must ask is whether he is opposed
to all war. This is very different from being a
pacifist. There is nothing in law or govern
ment regulations that requires a CO to em
brace nonviolence on a personal level — a
CO can retain the right to self detense and
defense of loved ones. However, such a
claimant must be prepared to carefully exp
lain this distinction to a draft board and be
convinced of this distinctin.
A CO must object to war in any form. One
cannot choose the wars he will tight in and
still be a CO. A person cannot say he is
opposed to "aggressive" wars like Vietnam
yet support a "just" war. 1 he Supreme C ourt
clearly distinguishes, however, betwen a per
son who is sure he could participate in certain
wars and the person who honestly does not
know where his conscience would lead him.
The court referred to them:
. . . persons who oppose participating in all

war but cannot say with complete certainty
that their present convictions and existing state
of mind are unalterable. Unwillingness to
deny the possibility of a change of mind, in
some hypothetical future circumstances, may
be no more than humble good sense, casting
no doubt on the claimant's present sincerity of
belief.
United States vs. Owens (1969)
If at the present time you can say you are
opposed to war in any form, you are a CO
even though you may recognize that some
future situation may change your mind.
Many of us say we would fight in a "just"
war. The question to be answered then is
whether human beings could ever wage a
"just" war.
So the legal definition of the conscientious
objector is not as inflexible as Lepape would
have us believe. It is true that deceitful people
will successfully gain CO status without hold
ing a sincere opposition to all war, but this
should not deter others who are sincere in
their beliefs from articulating their opposi
tion to war before a draft board, and this
opposition may be based on religious, ethical
or philosophical grounds.

anthropocentric, not theocentric. Religion,
for all the various definitions that have been
given to it, is in the end a devotion of man to
the highest ideal he can conceive.
The question a person who considers him
self a CO must ask is whether he is opposed
to all war. This is very different from being a
pacifist. There is nothing in law or govern
ment regulations that requires a CO to em
brace nonviolence on a personal level — a
CO can retain the right to self detense and
defense of loved ones. However, such a
claimant must be prepared to carefully exp
lain this distinction to a draft board and be
convinced of this distinctin.
A CO must object to war in any form. One
cannot choose the wars he will tight in and
still be a CO. A person cannot say he is
opposed to "aggressive" wars like Vietnam
yet support a "just" war. 1 he Supreme C ourt
clearly distinguishes, however, betwen a per
son who is sure he could participate in certain
wars and the person who honestly does not
know where his conscience would lead him.
The court referred to them:
. . . persons who oppose participating in all

war but cannot say with complete certainty
that their present convictions and existing state
of mind are unalterable. Unwillingness to
deny the possibility of a change of mind, in
some hypothetical future circumstances, may
be no more than humble good sense, casting
no doubt on the claimant's present sincerity of
belief.
United States vs. Owens (1969)
If at the present time you can say you are
opposed to war in any form, you are a CO
even though you may recognize that some
future situation may change your mind.
Many of us say we would fight in a "just"
war. The question to be answered then is
whether human beings could ever wage a
"just" war.
So the legal definition of the conscientious
objector is not as inflexible as Lepape would
have us believe. It is true that deceitful people
will successfully gain CO status without hold
ing a sincere opposition to all war, but this
should not deter others who are sincere in
their beliefs from articulating their opposi
tion to war before a draft board, and this
opposition may be based on religious, ethical
or philosophical grounds.
