# Elections commissioner raps small ASSU ballots

ASSU Elections Commissioner
Doug Mitchell said Friday he is "dis
satisfied" with the ballots to he used in
this week's election.
The computer form ballots are too
small to hold all the necessary informa
tion, requiring a separate voter infor
mation sheet. The 3-by-l 1 inch ballots
will contain only numbered spaces to
he filled in much the same way a stan
dardized test form is completed.
Mitchell said 5000 voting pamphlets
will hp available, along with a ballot
and information sheet when voters pre
sent their student identification cards.
All ballots are alike, however, which
may present confusion, with spaces for
senior class president slates, for which
only juniors may vote.
"We have designated numbers three
through eight as the spots' for senior
class president," 'Mitchell said. "Since
you get the same ballot whether you're
a freshman or a junior, some people are
likely to make errors. We have to
monitor that very carefully."
Pollwatchers have been instructed to
check items three through eight when
students return their ballots in order to
help lessen the number that are mis

marked.
One of the senior class president
slates has already dropped out of the
race, leaving one space too many de
signated for the senior class presidents
selection on the ballot.
Alan Nichols, Carol Hegna, Don
nalisa Parks and Karen Reynolds have
decided not to run. Nichols contracted
mononucleosis and may not be able to
complete this quarter.
Unless he successfully completes
spring quarter, he won't have enough
units to guarantee him senior standing
in the fall, vaccording to Mitchell.
Mitchell said the three women on the
slate did not want to run without
Nichols.
Ballots will be counted by computer
Wednesday night. Mitchell said none
would be counted until the polls close
Wednesday night because "it might
sway voters who haven't vet cast their
ballots."
The elections commission plans to
telephone overseas campuses tomor
row evening, which is Wednesday
morning at most European campuses,
for overseas results.
"By Wednesday morning (here) we
will have all overseas results," Mitchell
said. "We gave them all the informa

tion before they left and phoned them
last week to make sure everything was
set to go."
With the recent addition of a KZSU
request, 15 fee assessments will be de
termined in this week's election.
Those groups asking for one-quarter
fee assessments of SI each are the
Chaparral. Theatre Guild, Glee Club,
Stanford Committee on Political Edu
cation (SCOPE), Volunteers in Asia,
Graduate Students Association,
Academic Organizations Board and
Publications Board.
The Program Fee and Speakers
Bureau are up for two-quarter fee as
sessments. The Speakers Bureau as
sessment would be winter-spring,
Mitchell said.
"They figured since there are 15 fee
assessments fall quarter, a lot of people
would go pick up their money, but with
only seven in the winter, students won't
be as likely to collect," he said.
Three-quarter fee assessments are
requested by Club Sports, the Daily,
the Band and Legal Counseling.
KZSU, which was added to the bal
lot last week by a special allowance of
the ASSU Senate, is requesting a
four-quarter fee assessment for fall,
winter, spring and summer quarters of
the 1980-81 academic year. The radio
station failed to meet the deadlines es
tablished by the elections commission
for petitioning to get on the ballot.
In other ASSU activity, the senate
Friday released its first newsletter, a
four-page tabloid titled, ASSU News &
Senate Report. The title is a play on the
more famous magazine, U.S. News &
World Report.
Distributed around campus, the
newsletter is intended to inform stu
dents about what the ASSU has done,
what projects are in progress, and what
the ASSU is planning. It gives a de
scription of how the student govern
ment operates and makes suggestions
for possible student involvement in
ASSU activity. Finally, one page of the
paper is devoted to explaining the
election-reform constitutional
amendment that will appear on this
week's ballot.
