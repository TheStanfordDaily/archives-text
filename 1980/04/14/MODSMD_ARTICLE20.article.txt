# Course of events includes failures

One of the many disadvan
tages of living in an optimistic
society is that people are forever
mistaking exceptional perfor
mance for the norm. Companies
measure profits and productivity

against standards set in the most
uncommonly prosperous times.
Schools expand faculties and
classrooms to accommodate a
temporary influx of students, in
defiance of demographic indica
tions of imminent decrease in en
rollments. Consumers go ever
deeper into debt to avoid a des
cent from their self-deluding
standard of living.
Nor is capitalism or its evil
demons to blame for this kind of
thinking. Our socialist exorcists
invoke the same typically
American magic when they
fondly imagine that every Ceteris
will remain completely paribus
once they have changed those
variables that will conduce to the
formation of a new and more
perfect union.
Fact is, this is a cultural trait
that pervades all areas of our
lives. Sportscasters make fools of
themselves by counting as a cer
tainty on the future development
of young talents.
Baseball fans indulge them
selvesin the most rococo calcula
tions of how, and ifsoandsobats
.270, what'shisname wins 20
games, and all the little whosits
"play to their potential," their
team might eke out a champion
ship. (Of course, it only works if
realistic prognoses are made of
the opposition.) Injuries to the
home team are always unfore
seen, an exogenous stroke of un
just fate.
In enlightened places like
Stanford, this cultural trait takes
a different form. Professors plan
their courses on the assumption
that nothing will go wrong, .no
one will ask any questions, and
there will be just enough time to
squeeze in 30 50-minute lec
tures in a ten-week quarter.
For students, too, maximum

performance at all times is very
nearly a given. "Let's see. I read
25 pages of Plato's Republic last
hour. If I do that for the nextt
seven hours . It is no acci
dent that our society, land of

lunches on the run, has witnessed
such growth in the Human Po
tential Movement, since that
movement operates on the as
sumption that happiness is a
measure of the quantum of indi
vidual potentialities in full work
ing order at any given moment.
The occasion for these reflec

tions was the decision a few
weeks ago to discontinue the
French house. I can't criticize
that decision, since I don't know
all the facts of the case. What
bothered me was some of the
reasoning that went into it.
The point was apparently
made that theme houses often
fail to sustain the enthusiasm of
their first year or two. By that
criterion, there is hardly a cul
tural organization anywhere that
would last. By taking as the norm
the exceptional enthusiasm'and
sense of purpose that normally
attend the initiation of such a
venture, the Configuration Panel
has made it virtually impossible
to establish tradition, which I
take to be one of the main goals
of a theme house.
But in fact, tradition seems far
from the panel's intent. Their
policy of scrutinizing every
house every year seems de
signed, rather, to "maximize the
potential" of the housing system
as a whole. Pursued thoroughly,
it would lead to a constant shuffl
ing of houses in and out accord

ing to their most recent perfor
mance, behavior strangely redo
lent of the investment policies of
corporate conglomerates.
I personally would prefer a
policy that placed a higher pre
mium on the establishment of a
tradition, because I believe in the
humanizing capacity of cultural
traditions. But my point is that
such a policy would presuppose a
more pessimistic view of man
than presently exists, a view
that accepts patiently the irregu
lar rhythms of life, that takes its
norm from an average of our
successes and failures, that sees
failure not as an aberration but
as part of the regular course of
events.
The decision made by the
Configuration Panel was merely
an unusually enthusiastic appli
cation of an attitude that we as a
people have opted for in count
less conscious and unconscious
ways in every area of our lives.
