## Benua's data discredited 
### 
Dan Benua's column (Daily, Apr. 2) would be a
serious indictment of the accident at Three Mile
Island (TMI) if the infant mortality data quoted
were correct and could be correlated to radiation
exposures resulting from the accident. It is difficult
to comment on these charges without having seen
the source, attributed to Dr. Ernest Sternglass, but
several points can be made even so.
One does not like to argue ad hominem, but
Sternglass is an exception. His past work in the area
of deaths and illnesses attributed (by him) to nuc
lear power has been universally discredited by all
but the most fanatic anti-nuclear believers. Ac
cording to B.L. Cohen Nuclear Science and Society,
"his work has been publicly criticized to an unpre
cedented extent by numerous radiation scientists,
State Public Health Boards, Committees of the
National Academy of Sciences and of the United
Nations, etc."
An EPA official testified: "In several cases
where data were not available for a particular site
during a particular calendar quarter, data were
transposed from another quarter by Dr. Sternglass
. . . Dr. Sternglass only used data which supported
his theory and ignored data which did not." But
obviously, fys past lack of credibility is not a re
sponse to his present claims.
If the figures quoted by Benua are correct, and
he attributes the increase in infant mortality to
lodine-131 ingestion during the final months of
pregnancy, then it would be expected that there
would be an increase in thyroid deficiencies
(hypothyroidism) among babies born in the area in
the nine-month period after TMI. Such an increase
was in fact observed, but only in three counties to

the east of TMI, where, according to Benua, there
were no increases in infant deaths. In any case, the
total number of excess hypothyroidism cases in
these three counties was very small (about eight),
and there were no cases at all in the county in which
TMI is located. The Pennsylvania Department of
Public Health does not attribute these cases to
TMI. Such increases have in fact been occasionally
observed elsewhere, where nuclear power is not an
issue. Infant hypothyroidism is generally non-fatal
and curable if detected, and many countries and
states, including Pennsylvania, now have routine
infant screening programs for this purpose.
Benua is flatly wrong when he says that
Sternglass' conclusions are not without theoretical
explanation. Much is known, both theoretically
and epidemiologically, about the effects of low
levels of radiation. Even when uncertainties are
taken into account, there is nothing in this body of
knowledge that would support or lend credence to
Sternglass' claims.
Apparently no effort was made by Benua (or
Sternglass) to determine whether there were other
possible explanations of the apparent increase in
infant mortality. It is obvious that one would have
to examine the full range of data carefully before
judging whether Sternglass' observations repre
sent something more than statistical variations.
However, to my mind there is little question that
the Kemeny Commission's conclusions (that no
health effects other than mental strain can be attri
buted to TMI) are vastly more credible.
