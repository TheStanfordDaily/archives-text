Projectiles shattered windowsat Columbae House one night last week. Residents who
were in the Columbae room at the time said the projectiles were thrown from the
Delta Upsilon house next door. DU Rush Chairman Andy Roberts said he thinks a
friend of someone in the DU house threw the missiles, but Roberts added he is not sure
whether the man is rushing. The DU's were holding a rush function at the time, but
Roberts said. "I would rather not see this blamed on rush." He added." We do our best
to control the guys who come "through."
