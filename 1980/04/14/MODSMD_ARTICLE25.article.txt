## Spring grid practice starts out on right foot 
### 
The 1 spring football season is in full swing now
and after the first week, everyone involved seems to
be pleased with what's happening. There is a new
attitude surrounding the team, a new feeling to go
along with their new head coach. Paul Wiggin.
As one player said last Wednesday, "Spring prac
tice is fun this year. It's never been fun before, bdt
now the feeling is really positive — even when we
screw-up they don't get on us too bad."
The Cards are going through their second coaching
transition period in as many years and, in fact," some
of the players have never known a steady program at
Stanford. But this doesn't seem to be bothering any
body. Perhaps after last year's season, which was
marked by a jumble of emotions concerning coach
Rod Dowhower'smethods, the playersare clingingto
the confidence and control with which Wiggin took
over the reigns. After a year of dubious leadership,
they seem to enjoy the fresh start.
Coach Wiggin likes it too. After 23 years of playing
and coaching in the pros, Wiggin is back in college
football at his alma mater. When he was hired in
February he was extremely enthusiastic. When asked
last week if he still felt as strongly about his return he
said,
"Yeah, I'm still really enthusiastic and I like it a lot.
Most of the doubts I had at that time I feel comforta
ble with now. The recruiting is over and I'm pleased
with that. I feel like I'm able to relate positively with
the team. I've put together a staff I'm pleased with.
We've gone past a lot of hurdles already.
"I'm impressed with the attitude of the players.

That's the most encouraging thing so far."
One of the most encouraging things for anybody
about this year's spring practice is the return of Dar
rin Nelson, the Cards ace in the hole in the backfield.
He returns as strong as ever after missing last year
because of a ripped hamstring tendon. "Darrin looks
great," Wiggin said and he really did on Wednesday.
During an offense-defense drill towards the end of
practice. Nelson flared left out of his halfback spot
and caught a short screen pass from quarterback John
Elway. He started running light when one of the
defensive secondary started bearing down on him.
Nelson simply jumped to a stop, spun instantly and
disappeared for 10 yards. Everyone gasped, chuckled
and knew that Darrin Nelson was back on the Farm.
"It feels great to be back out." Nelson said last
Thursday. "It's a lot of fun."
A large part of a coaching transition is getting used
to a new staff. Coach Wiggin has built a strong one
highlighted by offensive coordinator Denny Green,
who coached here and at San Francisco with Bill
Walsh, and defensive coordinator Jack Harbaugh,
who coached under Bo Schemblecher at defensive
powerhouse Michigan.
"This is the best staff I've ever been around,"
Wiggin said. "They're all fun people who still know
that football is just a game. They're also ready to pay
the price in time and energy that it takes to win."
It would seem that a team which tried with its
coaching staff to mix the offense of the Pac-10 with
the defense of the Big-10 might run into some con
flicts. Pac-10 football and Big-10 football could

hardly be more disparate. But Wiggin says no.
We'll have leadership out of both elements (Big-10
and Pac-10) — kind of the best of both worlds.
They're (Green and 1 larbaugh ) very compatible in a
coaching meeting, Wiggin said.
Concerning the relationship of coaching staff to
players. Nelson said,
"1 rom what I've seen, everyone gets along fine."
And concerning the coaches themselves he added,
"This year is a lot more fun and if you can make
spring practice fun at all, you must be doing some
thing right. Wiggin gives his assistants- more of a
chance to coach than Dowhower did which is good."
Wiggin has some very straightforward goals for the
spring workouts which seem to be unfolding already.
"We have three goals," the coach said. "We'd like
to be able to walk away with a fun attitude, realizing
that it's just a game. There are a lot of things which
are very important about football, we want to win,
but nothing means anything unless it's fun. Secondly ,
we'd like to minimize the transitional shock. And
third, we're going to find out who our No. 1 players
are and form the first team. That doesn't mean no one
else can't break into the lineup later'on, but we want
to make it competitive. I want these things ingrained
by fall so we don't have to worry about them then."
'Fhe players seem to like Wiggin already, and he
likes them. Everybody out there seems to really like
being a part of the Stanford football team. They're
excited. "We're going to the Rose Bowl," a player
said after last Wednesday's workout. That's called
minimizing transitional shock.

John Elway has never started a game at Stanford but is
probably one of the best known names on the squad. I he
rifle-armed freshman standout will feel all the pressure
next year, though, as he will be coach Paul Wiggin's No.
1 quarterback.
