# Card nine takes two from 'SC foes
## 
### Chris Haft Staff Writer 
Members of the Stanford
baseball team have another way
of doubling their pleasure and
their fun besides chewing a cer
tain brand of gum — defeating
USC.
The Cardinals were able to
gain immense satisfaction twice
this past weekend at Sunken
Diamond, outlasting the Trojans
6-5 on Friday and 5-4 in 1 1 in
nings yesterday. In Saturday's
game, .USC managed a 7-5
triumph.
Stanford, now 23-14 overall
and 8-10 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference Southern Division, not
only pulled past USC (16-17.
7-10) in the league standings,
but also deposited the Trojans in
last place.
Following California's
miraculous three-game sweep at
Arizona State, Stanford stands
just three games behind the
first-pi ace Bears.
But it was the joy of beating
USC, not the thrill of the pen
nant race, that the Cards were
absorbed in.
"1 love to beat them (the Tro
jans) more than anybody else,
because I don't like the way they
play," team captain Paul Zuvella
said. "Individually, they're great
guys, but when they get together
The Trojan tactics Zuvella re
ferred to include excessive and
constant verbal abuse from the
players in the dugout and, at
least yesterday, malicious

baserunning. Trying to disrupt a
double play in the third inning.
USC outfielder Stu Pederson il
legally slid far out of the baseline
to knock down Card shortstop
Dave Meier, who later was
forced to leave the game with a
knee bruise.
The sheer novelty of winning a
series with USC also pleased the
Cards. For each of the past three
seasons, Stanford has lost five
out of its six meetings with the
Trojans. And last month at Los
Angeles. USC dealt the Cards
three more defeats.
Even though they're in the cel
lar. it's good to beat these guys,"
said infielder Bob DeCosta,
whose squeeze bunt in the 1 Ith
inning drove home Darryl
Stephens with yesterday's win
ning run. They try to intimidate
us with their mouths and it has
been successful."
Success, however, ultimately
belonged to Stanford yesterday.
With the score tied 4-4, USC re
lief pitcher Bob Gunnarson
opened the 1 Ith inning by walk
ing Stephens and John Elway.
Third baseman Steve
Buechele followed with a perfect
sacrifice bunt — hthird of the
game — moving the runners to
second and third. After Zuvella
was intentionally walked. De-
Costa came to the plate.
DeCosta's modest batting fi
gures — a .258 average in Pac-1 0
play and .189 overall —
suggested that a squeeze bunt
might be considered a probabil
ity rather than a possibility. As it

turned out. it was a certainty.
"He (Stanford coach Mark
Marquess) told me he would give
me one pitch and then I would
squeeze," DeCosta said. "I was
pretty well-prepared for it."
DeCosta took a ball from
Gunnarson. then dropped a bunt
which traveled up the third-base
line as Stephens charged home.
But the ball trickled into foul ter
ritory after rolling about 60 feet.
USC coach Rod Dedeaux re
placed Gunnarson with Mike
Couchee. DeCosta swung and
missed at a Couchee blazer, then
squared around once more and
bunted a Couchee slider in front
of the plate. The ball was fielded,
but Stephens beat the throw
home.
'it doesn't take much to get
psyched up for a squeeze," De-
Costa said. "You're thinking of
just one thing up there: get the
bat on the ball."
Getting the bat on the ball was
something the Trojans had little
trouble doing in the eighth in
ning, when they scored three
times to take a 4-5 lead. After
Marty Wilkerson walked, second
Bob Batesole smashed one di
rectly back at Card pitcher Larry
Kuhn. The ball carooned off
Kuhn's right leg into foul territ
ory, and as Batesole pulled in at
first base, Wilkerson went all the
way to third.
Kuhn, who had pi tched magni
ficently up to that point, was re
placed by Brian Mignano. Dave
Leeper greeted Mignano rudely
with a single to right field, scor

ing Wilkerson.
Designated hitter Paul Horn
rig bunted the ball back to Mig
nano, who tried to force Batesole
at third but couldn't because no
body was covering there. Horn
rig was called safe at first, and
centerfielder Stan Edmonds fol
lowed with a single through the
left side to put the Trojans on
top.
The Cards pushed the tying
run across in the bottom of the
inning. DeCosta singled and Bill
Worden walked to start the rally.
Loring Davies attempted to sac
rifice, and instead reached base
safely as pitcher Lee Jones
fielded Davies' bunt and threw
to third too late to get DeCosta.
Mike Toothman struck out,
but pinch-batter Mike Aldrcte
smacked a single into right field,
sending DeCosta home with the
fourth run.
The series' strangest occur
ence took place in the seventh
inning. Elway led off with an in
field hit, but as he crossed first
base he bumped into Jones, who
was covering the base, and the
two exchanged harsh words.
After a Buechele sacrifice,
Zuvella hit a grounder to the
right side. Again Jones covered
first base, and again there was a
slight collision as Zuvella el
bowed Jones after crossing the
base and being retired for the
second out.
Jones, who had apparently
had enough physical contact,
ranted and raved.
The raving soon acquired a
new source — the Cards — when
the umpires ruled that Zuvella
was guilty of interference on
Jones, therefore also retiring the
baserunner closest to home,
which was Elway.
Friday's game also temporar
ily reached a 4-4 score. Then
Zuvella and Meier opened the
seventh with singles. Worden
and Davies flied out, but Tooth
man sliced a single to right, scor
ing Zuvella, and Elway bounced
one that barely eluded second

Meier across.
Mignano, the winner in yes
terday's contest, was also Fri
day's victor, overpowering the
Trojans both days with his
fastball and his slider.
On Saturday, USC erased a
5-4 Card advantage by scoring
three runs in the seventh on just
one hit.
After Edmonds walked,
pitcher George Lopez fielded
Dan Davidsmeier's sacrifice at
tempt and threw to first baseman
Davies, who couldn't handle the

toss. The error sent hdmonds to
third and Davidsmeier to sec

Dave Smith walked, then
Pederson grounded out, scoring
the tying run. With the infield in,
Jim Cecchini swungat a low, out
side 0-2 pitch and poked a soft
liner just beyond Zuvella's reach
for the winning runs.
