### Templin Dowling Staff Writer 
Five Stanford track athletes —
Darrin Nelson. Rick Buss, John
Schaer. Tom Lobsinger, Boh Berry
and Mike Melendez — com
peted in the much-publicized
Bruce Jenner Track and Field
Classic at San Jose City College
Saturday.
And, while none of them
exactly stole the show, the group
as a whole performed well
enough to please their coach.
Brooks Johnson.
"They did a good job overall."
Johnson said. "There were only
a few there (from Stanford)
though

Buss, according to Johnson,
continued to improve in the
hammer throw, and was labeled
by his coach as the Cardinals
"bright spot" in the meet.
Nelson performed well in his
specialty, the 100 meter dash.
Johnson said, but was running in
a tough field. The meet's 100
meter winner was Texas A&M's
Curtis Dickey, who posted a
meet record 10.21 time.
Stanford's Schaer was another
bright spot for the Cards, win
ning his section of the 800 meter
competition. Lobsinger was
forced to pull out of the mile run
with an arch problem, and Berry
and Melender were both beaten

soundly in the 5000 meter event,
though neither were expected to
finish especially high.
The highlight of the entire
meet was a spectacular mile run
by Suleiman Nyamhui of
Texas-El Paso and Tanzania.
Running well ahead of the rest of
the pack the last two laps,
Nyambui won the mile in 3:55.5,
the fastest time in the world this
year and the fastest mile ever in
Santa Clara county.
"It was a good meet," Stan
ford's Johnson concluded. "It
was not really what we need,
though. (A few select athletes
can get in) but the other ones, the
ones which need the experience,
can't go."
