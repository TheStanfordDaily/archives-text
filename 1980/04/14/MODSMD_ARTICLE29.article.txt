One athlete called it the
"blackest day in U.S. Olympic
history," while another said she
was proud. But most of Ameri
ca's athletes were resigned yes
terday to the L'.S. Olympic
Committee's decision to boycott
the Moscow Summer Games.
Three-time Boston Marathon
champion Bill Rodgers, who cal
led it the "blackest day in U.S.
Olympic history," said members
of the USOC "should lose their
jobs, because they are supposed
to be impervious to such influ
ences as politics. The committee
sold their athletes down the ri\er
to a president that only wants to
get reelected."
But three-time Olympic mid
dle distance runner Madeline
Manning Mims. belie\es that
many athletes "have centered
their lives on the Olympics and
do not recognize this is an issue
that is bigger than the Olym
pics."
"1 do not agree with every
thing President (Jimmy) Carter
has done. But 1 was proud of him
for saying he would take legal

action to keep our athletes from
going to Moscow," said Minis.
Peter Ueberroth, president of
the Los Angeles Olympic
Organizing Committee, said he
doesn't think the boycott deci
sion will have any repercussion
on the Los Angeles Games.
"The geopolitical situation
changes almost e\ cry month now
and so 1 think that there will be
an entirely different set of cir
cumstances in said
Ueberroth. "The Soviets have
said, although they were not
even asked, that they would at
tend the Games even if
there isa U.S. boycott this year."
Bob Newland, manager of the
U.S. Olympic track and field
team, used the words "charade"
and "farce" to describe the
boycott vote.
"I don't think that the guns
that were brought in to coerce
the voting had anything to do
with the athletes' feelings." said
Newland. He was referring to
Carter administration threats to
end the USOC's charter if the
vote went against the boycott.
