# Iranian militants invite delegation to visit American captives
## 
### William Branigin The Washington Post 
TEHRAN. Iran —The militants occupying
the U.S. Embassy yesterday invited a delega
tion including Red Cross representatives to
visit all the American captives as Iran faced a
collective Western protest about lack of prog
ress in the hostage issue.
It was not immediately clear, however,
whether the Moslem student captors would
fully agree to Red Cross conditions for the visit,
which was tentatively scheduled tor this after
noon. The Red Cross representative here said
an "agreement in principle" had been reached,
but that the visit hinged on the militants' con
firmation this morning.
The envoys ol eight European Common
Market countries and Japan, meanwhile, were
being recalled tor consultation to their respec
tive capitals to protest Iranian leaders' failure
to heed a collective appeal for the hostages'

release, diplomatic sources said.
The eight European ambassadors and
charges d'affaires were scheduled to depart
this morning, with the Japanese envoy to leave
tomorrow.
In continuing efforts to rally support for
Iran's position in the hostage crisis and its con
flict with neighboring Iraq, Foreign Minister
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh conferred yesterday with
the chiefs of the mission of the Islamic coun
tries and said he may invite African and East
European envoys to hear him out also.
Follows Faster visit
The militants' decision to invite a delegation
to see the hostages follows an edict last week by
Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini, authorizing more visits to the
captives after three American clergymen sym
pathetic to the militants held Easter service
inside the occupied embassy.

Khomeini's statement April 7 said there was
"no obstacle" to further visits to ascertain the
hostages' condition, but he stipulated that the
visits take place "with the supervision of the
responsible officials ' Observers said that
vague phrase of independent assessment was
insisted upon by the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
In addition to Red Cross officials, the milit
ants yesterday invited Iran's health minister,
Dr. Musa Zargar, the lea fer of Tehran's Friday
prayers, Hojatoleslam Mohammed Ali
Khamenehi, and representatives of the Red
Lion and Sun Society '. n's equivalent of the
Red Cross.
A Red Lion and Sun Society doctor was
admitted to the embassy last month and per
formed cursory examinations of a number of
the hostages. Television film made under the
supervision of the militants showed 11 of the
hostages being examined by the doctor, who

was erroneously identified as a Red Cross
representative. The film was made available to
American television and caused concern when
several of the hostages appeared to be suffering
depression or mental stress.
Will see all
The militants said yesterday that they would
allow the Red Cross team to "see all the hos
tages." If this promise were made good, it
would mark the first time since the Nov. 4
embassy takeover that all the captives were
seen by an independent foreign observer.
So far, independent observers have only
managed to see as many as 46 of the hostages,
leaving unanswered questions about the fate of
four more that the U.S. State Department says
are being held. Rumors have circulated that
several of the hostages denounced by their cap
tors as "spies" may have been transferred
elsewhere, and that one of them may have at

tempted suicide or been otherwise harmed.
Arousing special concern has been the fate
of embassy political officer Michael Metrino,
who has not been seen by an outside observer
or heard from in any letter to his family.
Western diplomats here were taking a wait
and-see attitude toward the militants' invita
tion. Some expressed skepticism that, even if
the Red Cross representatives went into the
embassy with a firm agreement on conditions,
they would be able to go with the visit accord
ing to their rules.
The tough statements on the hostage crisis
by some European diplomats appear to con
trast with their countries' evident reluctance to
join U.S. political and economic sanctions
against Iran. Some observers here interpreted
the statements as "jawboning" to elicit some
Iranian response before the European coun
tries come underpressure to join the sanctions.

fully agree to Red Cross conditions for the visit,
which was tentatively scheduled tor this after
noon. The Red Cross representative here said
an "agreement in principle" had been reached,
but that the visit hinged on the militants' con
firmation this morning.
The envoys ol eight European Common
Market countries and Japan, meanwhile, were
being recalled tor consultation to their respec
tive capitals to protest Iranian leaders' failure
to heed a collective appeal for the hostages'

release, diplomatic sources said.
The eight European ambassadors and
charges d'affaires were scheduled to depart
this morning, with the Japanese envoy to leave
tomorrow.
In continuing efforts to rally support for
Iran's position in the hostage crisis and its con
flict with neighboring Iraq, Foreign Minister
Sadegh Ghotbzadeh conferred yesterday with
the chiefs of the mission of the Islamic coun
tries and said he may invite African and East
European envoys to hear him out also.
Follows Faster visit
The militants' decision to invite a delegation
to see the hostages follows an edict last week by
Iran's revolutionary leader, Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini, authorizing more visits to the
captives after three American clergymen sym
pathetic to the militants held Easter service
inside the occupied embassy.

Khomeini's statement April 7 said there was
"no obstacle" to further visits to ascertain the
hostages' condition, but he stipulated that the
visits take place "with the supervision of the
responsible officials ' Observers said that
vague phrase of independent assessment was
insisted upon by the International Committee
of the Red Cross.
In addition to Red Cross officials, the milit
ants yesterday invited Iran's health minister,
Dr. Musa Zargar, the lea fer of Tehran's Friday
prayers, Hojatoleslam Mohammed Ali
Khamenehi, and representatives of the Red
Lion and Sun Society '. n's equivalent of the
Red Cross.
A Red Lion and Sun Society doctor was
admitted to the embassy last month and per
formed cursory examinations of a number of
the hostages. Television film made under the
supervision of the militants showed 11 of the
hostages being examined by the doctor, who

was erroneously identified as a Red Cross
representative. The film was made available to
American television and caused concern when
several of the hostages appeared to be suffering
depression or mental stress.
Will see all
The militants said yesterday that they would
allow the Red Cross team to "see all the hos
tages." If this promise were made good, it
would mark the first time since the Nov. 4
embassy takeover that all the captives were
seen by an independent foreign observer.
So far, independent observers have only
managed to see as many as 46 of the hostages,
leaving unanswered questions about the fate of
four more that the U.S. State Department says
are being held. Rumors have circulated that
several of the hostages denounced by their cap
tors as "spies" may have been transferred
elsewhere, and that one of them may have at

tempted suicide or been otherwise harmed.
Arousing special concern has been the fate
of embassy political officer Michael Metrino,
who has not been seen by an outside observer
or heard from in any letter to his family.
Western diplomats here were taking a wait
and-see attitude toward the militants' invita
tion. Some expressed skepticism that, even if
the Red Cross representatives went into the
embassy with a firm agreement on conditions,
they would be able to go with the visit accord
ing to their rules.
The tough statements on the hostage crisis
by some European diplomats appear to con
trast with their countries' evident reluctance to
join U.S. political and economic sanctions
against Iran. Some observers here interpreted
the statements as "jawboning" to elicit some
Iranian response before the European coun
tries come underpressure to join the sanctions.
