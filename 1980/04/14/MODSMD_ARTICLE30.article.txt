### Steve Mitchell Staff writer 
L.OS ANGELES — For only the second time in 14
years, Stanford's men's tennis team swept a pair of
dramatic 5-4 victories over the USC Trojans and the
UCLA Bruins down in Southern California, to vault the
Cardinals to the top of the tough Pac-10 race.
Against the sixth ranked Trojans, Stanford came out
swinging as Peter Rennert, Da\e Siegler and I im
Mayotte all notched straight sets victories to spur the
Cards to a 3-0 lead. Rennert. play ing against All Ameri
can Robert Vant'Hof. never lost his own ser\e en route
to a 7-6 (5-2). 6-4 win. Serving extremely well through
out the match, Rennert took advantage of a Vant' Hot
double fault at 2-4 in the first set tie breaker, and went
on to break Vant'Hof s ser\e at 3-3 in the second set to
nab the win.
Mayotte and Siegler then rallied to convincing vic
tories as Mayotte overpowered Sean Brawley 6-3. 6-3.
and Siegler. playing perhaps his finest singles match as a
Cardinal, destroyed Roger Knapp 6-2. 6-4.
But just as the Cards looked as though they would
decimate the Trojans altogether. Billy Nealon of SC
rallied to a come-from-behind 3-6, 7-6, 6-4 victory over
Bourne and Doug Adler defeated Jeff Arons 7-6. 3-6.
6-3 to narrow Stanford's lead to 3-2. But Bondurant
momentarily hushed the noisy SC crowd by disposing of
Jack Kruger 7-6. 7-5 to give the Cards a 4-2 lead going
into the doubles.
But doubles victories have not come easily for the
Cards this year, and when Stanford's second two teams.
Mayotte-Arons and Bondurant-Siegler. dropped their
matches, Jhe pressure turned to the Cards' veterans —

Bourne and Rennert.
After splitting the first two sets, the Card duo found
themselves down 4-5 with Bourne sen ing a no-ad point,
which meant match-point for the Trojans. But Bourne
rifled a strong first serve that Vant'Hof netted, and the
Cards came back to break Adler's ser\e to take a 6-5
lead with Rennert serving.
Forced to a 3-3 no-ad point after once again holding a
3-1 lead. Rennert calmly stepped up and blistered a
service ace past the stunned Vant'Hof to secure the team
victory and send the Cardinal team swarming onto the
court in jubilation. ("I only serve aces when I need
them." jokes Rennert after the match.)
With this thrilling win under their belt, the Cards
moved to the slow courts of the Bruins under hot sunny
skies.
Rennert opened up with an overpowering 6-2.6-4 win
over Robbie Venter and Mayotte was quick to follow as
he once again proved devastating by overtaking Mike
Harrington 6-3. 6-3.
The sophomore Arons then scored a big win for the
Cards as he trounced Dan Saltz 6-4. 6-3, using a consis
tent back court game on the slow courts to out-steady
Saltz.
But the Bruins began rolling as Blaine Willenborg's
steady baseline top spin strokes proved too much for
Bourne. Willenborg winning 6-4. 6-2.
Inspired by the now boisterous crowd. UCLA's Bruce
Brecia and Marcel Freeman rallied to two three-set wins
over Stanford's Bondurant and Siegler. Bondurant ral
lied from a 0-4 deficit in the second set after losing the
first set. only to have service problems in the third set
which he dropped 6-0. Siegler also staged a comeback in

the second set, but was defeated soundly in the third set,
to round out the single; matches at 3-3 going into the
doubles.
Rennert and Bourne started things off on the right
foot for the Cards as they cruized to an easy 6-3,6-2 win
over Freeman and Harrington. Mayotte and Arons then
looked as though they might cinch the team victory as
Mayotte was serving for the first set at 5-4, but his serve
was broken and the Bruins' duo Dick Metz and Willen
borg went on for a 7-6 (5-3), 6-1 victory to tie the team
totals at four.
The Cards' young team of Bondurant and Siegler had
already won the first set 6-4, and Bondurant was serving
for the match at 5-4, when the crowd focused in on the
match. Spurred by the crowd, Saltz and Venter broke
Bondurant's serve 4-0 following a fence climbing save by
Venter on the first point. Saltz and Siegler then both held
serve to force the tie breaker.
Down 2-4 in the tie breaker, Bondurant served out
two long points to knot it at 4-4, but after a long ex
change with all four players at the net, Saltz volleyed the
ball away to send the partisan crowd into a frenzy and the
match into the deciding third set.
The young Cardinal team fought back hard in the third
set. however, as they broke Saltz' serve at 4-5 on a no-ad
point, as Siegler roped a strong backhand return of serve
past the poaching Venter for the second hair-raising
Stanford win of the weekend.
The pair of wins puts the Cards in commanding lead of
the tough Pac-10 race with a 4-1 record. UC-Berkeley,
which has beaten Stanford twice and was formerly
ranked No. 1, lost both their matches over the weekend,
falling 5-4 to UCLA and 6-3 to USC.
