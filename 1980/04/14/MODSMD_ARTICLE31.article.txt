A boisterous home crowd in
Roble Gym helped spark Stan
ford's men's volleyball team to a
3-2 victory over Cal Poly-SLO
Saturday night, according to
coach Fred Sturm and his
players.
Cal Poly outdistanced Stan
ford in the first game 20-18, and
won the fourth game 15-9. The
Cardinals took games two and
three with scores of 15-8 and
15-7, and won the final game to
break the tie 15-10. The Cards'
record now stands at 7-10 over
all and 5-10 in conference.
In the first game, the Cards
were admittedly slow to click as a
team, and Cal Poly blocked a
number of Cardinal spike at
tempts over the net and ran up an
early 8-1 lead. Stanford nar
rowed the margin to 8-9 in Cal
Polv's favor with spikes by hit
ters Rod Fletcher and John
McColl highlighting the rally.
A Jack Foxworth block tied
the game at 10 and began a see
saw battle during which no score
went unanswered. Both sides
suffered defensive errors that al
lowed the other team to score.

but overall the points came from
precise offensive play. With Cal
Poly on top 15-14, Fletcher
pounded the ball at a Cal Poly
player who couldn't handle it,
tying the score at 15.
McColl especially made his
presence felt as the game con
tinued. After a McColl spike
down the right side, Cal Poly hit
the ball out of bounds to tie the
game at 17.
McColl's efforts weren't
enough, however, as a Stanford
block drifted out of bounds and a
Cal Poly tap over the net scored
to give them the win.
Stanford worked up an early
8-2 lead, highlighted by a diving
save in the back end of the court
by Fletcher. With the Cards
ahead 12-4 Foxworth dropped
to make a save in the front court,
sailing the ball over the net. At
this point Cal Poly started to
rally back and closed the score to
13-8, but they were too far be
hind to catch the Cardinals.
After Kip Engen set up a Fox
worth spike, Cal Poly couldn't
get McColl's serve over the net
to give Stanford a 14-8 lead. A
Cal-Poly spike bounced out of
bounds for the Cardinal win.
In the third game, Stanford
continued to play cohesive de

fense", but the offense picked up
as well. Again the Cards built a
big lead, ahead at one point.
The game ended with Kim Lum
blocking two spikes over the net
to give Stanford the win.
Ilie Cards definitely had the
momentum going into the fourth
game. The team.jumped out to
an early 3-1 edge, but a staunch
Cal Poly club didn't give up. For
most of the game the score fluc
tuated from Cal Poly being
ahead by one to Stanford tying
the score.
The deciding game began
evenly, but Stanford eventually
widened the score to 7-2.
Stanford remained in control
for nearly the remainder of the
game, although a few offensive
errors brought Cal Poly within
three. Fletcher, Foxworth, and
Lum were solid on defense, with
Fletcher also providing offensive
power. The game ended with
McColl and Lum blocking a
spike over the net.
Sturm noted that the team as a
whole played very well, but that
the middle offense was excep
tional. "The thing that really
stood out was the middle of
fense. Kip works the middle bet
ter than any other setter in the
conference," he observed.
