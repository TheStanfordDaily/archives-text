# Ballesteros gets the Green Coat

### 
AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) —
Severiano Ballesteros, his game
threatening to collapse on the
hack nine, pulled himself to
gether in time and scored a
front-running, four-stroke vic
tory yesterday in the 44th Mas
ters Tournament.
The triumph, secured on a 72
final round and a 275 total, 13
under par on the famed Augusta
National Golf Club, made Bal
lesteros the youngest Masters
champ of all time, only the sec
ond foreigner ever to don the
green and confirmed the current
British Open champion as a full-
Hedged challenger to Tom Wat
son for world golf supremacy.
It was a Spanish conquest that
almost became a collapse.
The dynamic Ballesteros
started the day with a whopping,
7-shot lead.
By the turn, he had built it to
10. He was quick-striding down
the lush fairways, happily doffing
his white cap to the applause that
spread through the towering
pines.
The only thing in question
seemed to be whether he could
break some of Jack Nicklaus'
scoring records.
Five holes later he was no
longer smiling.
Any chance for the records
had long since disappeared. His
lead had shrunk to two slender
strokes. His game suddenly had
gone sour. The victory was in
doubt.
But he pulled it back.
He nailed it down on the
nature-guarded, par-5 15th. He

reached the green in two big
strokes and 2-putted for the bir
die that gave him the breathing
room he needed.

pressure on the sagging Balles-.
teros with four consecutive bir
dies in the run down the stretch,
tied for second with Australian
Open champion Jack Newton at
279.
Gilbert, an American jour
neyman tourist, once got to
within two shots of the lead and
finished with a 5-under-par 67.
Newton, playing with Balles
teros in the last twosome, shot a
closing 68.
Hubert Green, who started
the day 10 shots back, closed
with a 67 and was at 280.
David Graham, an Australian
now living in United States and
the current PGA champion, had
a 70 and was at 281.
The big group at 283 included
Ed Fiori, Jerry Pate, Tom Kite,
Larry Nelson, Ben Crenshaw
and Gary Player. Pate had a 67 in
the near-ideal playing condi
tions. Kite, Nelson and Cren
shaw all shot 695. Fiori had 73.
Player, the South African who
is the only previous foreign win
ner of golfs prestigious spring

rite, closed with a 70.
Approximately two hours in
front of Ballesteros, and with ab
solutely no bearing on the out
come of the tournament, a
mini-Masters was played bet
ween Arnold Palmer and
Nicklaus.
The two celebrated golfers re
ceived a standing ovation when

they approached the 1 Sth green.
And Nicklaus briefly put his arm
around the waist of his old friend
and golfing foe as they marched,
stride for stride, up to the green.
Palmer, now 50, won their
personal battle. He shot a 69 for
2SS. Nicklaus, 40, still frustrated
in his comeback try, took a 73-
291.
