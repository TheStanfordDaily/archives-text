Ruhollah Khomeini to lead an "Iraqi revolution," Tehran

that the dispute with Iraq may take a grave new turn if a

successor to the 79-year-old Khomeini, had met with the
Iranian revolutionary leader and urged he lead a revolution
to topple the Iraqi government.

the Pars news agency, quoted him as saying: "All Iraqis,
both Shiites and Sunnis. are waiting for an opportunity to
rise against the regime."

SALTON CITY — Salton Sea waters that flooded up to
four feet deep over six city blocks in this sleepy resort
community receded somewhat yesterday, but an Imperial
County official said state and federal disaster agencies ap
pear reluctant to aid families whose homes are located in
what they consider flood-prone areas.

Calm restored after racial protests
WRIGHTSVILLE, Ga. — Most state troopers left the
downtown area of this racially divided town yesterday as
quiet returned after civil rights and white power de
monstrators dispersed. But local blacks vowed to continue
their struggle against a powerful county sheriff.
"The march is not over. The march is just begun," said
John Martin, local president of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference. "On Tuesday, we're going to
march to the sheriffs office and suggest he come out and
talk."
Nearly 200 protest marchers, most of them black,
marched to the downtown courthouse Saturday in protest
of alleged economic discrimination and other grievances
that many Johnson County blacks blame on Sheriff Roland
Attaway.
State troopers armed with riot sticks and pistols stood
poised on the scene, forming a barrier between the mar
chers and a crowd of white power advocates who held a

counterdemonstration.
The march was called following a melee between blacks
and whites in this town of 2 100 persons last Tuesday which
left at least nine persons hurt. Blacks charged that Atta
way's deputtes led the attack, but Attaway called the ac
cusations "damned lies."
Sabotage suspected in power loss
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Authorities said yesterday
they have not determined the cause of an 18-hour blackout
in Puerto Rico, but Gov. Carlos Romero Barcelo called the
kidnapping of an engineer and power failure a "strange
coincidence" that suggested "a criminal hand."
Authority executive director Alberto Bruno Vega said
the blackout followed a "sudden jolt" on a major transmis
sion line that caused two large generators at the Palo Seco
power plant on the outskirts of San Juan to trip off.
Efforts to contain the failure were unsuccessful, he said,
and in seconds the Caribbean island's entire power grid had
failed.
The power authority engineer, Manuel Vazquez San
tiago, was kidnapped outside the Palo Seco plant by three
hooded men about three hours before the blackout.
"It was a strange coincidence that makes us think of
sabotage," Romero said late Saturday.
But Mario Dones, president of the Electrical Workers
Union, said a union investigation had found the blackout
was caused by equipment failures in two different power
plants.
