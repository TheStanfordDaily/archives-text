# Local autonomy a major factor in official Phi Kappa Psi recognition
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Phi Kappa Psi was able to become an officially recognized
fraternity here because its national council gave the campus
chapter local autonomy . Row Director Diana Conklin said
last week.
1 he. inflexibility of sorority nationals is the prime deter
rent to sororities here being granted University recognition,
she added.
The Phi Psi national was willing to waive points in its
national constitution which the University didn't like, said
Phi Psi President Bill Shirley, a junior here.
Specific concessions include the local chapter's right to
determine election dates for chapter officers and the right to
control local decisions and member selection.
Alumni can not protest initiation of indi\ idual members,
for example, said Conklin.
She added that Stanford probably places a stronger em
phasis on local autonomy than do other colleges and univer
sities nationwide.

According to Norm Robinson, associate dean of residen
tial education. Phi Psi's efforts show that national organiza
tions are willing to be flexible on issues of local autonomy.
According to Janice Kimball, a founder and former pres
ident of Alpha Phi sorority, the sororitv nationals have not
granted the local autonomy the University requires because
' the nationals are concerned that we're just throwing away
their rules. They want to maintain a sense of membership."
She added that even if one sorority was granted the
requisite local autonomy bv its national, the sororities seek
recognition as a group. "If one sorority were to get recogni
tion and the others weren't, it would create antagonism."
Though Phi Psi will hold rush activities at Lathrop House
this spring. Shirley said the frat is not actively going to seek a
University house now.
Phi Psi House will continue to be a coed row house, filled
in the usual Spring Draw.
Phi Psi lost its national status here in 1977. The national
council withdrew its support when Phi Psi voted to remain a
coed house. The frat was the first established at the Univer
sity, in 1891.
