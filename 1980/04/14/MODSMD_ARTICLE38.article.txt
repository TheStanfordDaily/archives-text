# Africa Week celebration begins
## 
### David Frank Staff writer 
Africa Week 1980 opens today with
a noon rally in White Plaza. Sponsored
by the Stanford African Students As
sociation (SASA), the April 14-20
celebration will include lectures, sym
posiums. exhibitions and a dinner
dance.
A Thursday night symposium will
focus on this year's Africa Week
theme: "Alternative development
strategies in the 1980s for Africa."
Among the five speakers will be
Stanford's Donald Harris, professor of
economics; and St. Claire Drake, pro
fessor emeritus of anthropology.
Also speaking will be UC-Berkeley's
Aguibou Yansane, an associate profes
sor of Afro-American studies; San
Francisco State's Abdul Rhaman
Babu, professor of international rela
tions; and Cornell's K. Opoku
Agyeman, associate professor of politi
cal science at the Africana Research
Center.
SASA president Cuir Riak said Af
rica Week's purpose is to make the
Stanford community aware of critical
African issues. These include the con
tinuing struggle for independence in
South Africa and the issue of apar
theid, the recent independence of
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia, and the
economic and political problems of un
derdevelopment.
Redefinition
Underdevelopment will be the
major topic of the symposium, which
begins at 7 p.m. in CERAS. Topics will
include the redefinition and restructur
ing of relations between African and
other countries, developed and de
veloping, with respect to scarce re
sources and trade.

The professors also will discuss redis
tribution and equity issues within Afri
can nations as related to political par
ticipation.
Riak said the last 20 years have seen
"faltering efforts" to improve the so
cial and human misery of the majority
of Africans. As the 1980s begin, he
noted a need to reevaluate develop
ment strategies because the consequ
ences "will affect not only the African
peoples but also the relationship of the
continent with the rest of the world."
Africa Week also is designed to
promote unity among African students
through the discussion of solutions to
African problems. Riak said. He added
that African students should reaffirm
the purpose of their education in
America: to return and help their coun
tries to overcome obstacles to de
velopment.
Turning point
Other activities include a Tuesday
noon luncheon at the Bechtel Interna
tional Center which will center on
"Southern Africa at a turning point: a
discussion of the recent independence
of Zimbabwe-Rhodesia and the chal
lenge to Apartheid."

the role of the Caribbean in the African
liberation struggle. The noon lecture
