# Advocates 'total education submersion'
## Stern criticizes perpetuation of status quo 
### Jimmy Glanzer Staff Writer 
Current education methods are
aimed at keeping people mediocre,
radical educational theorist Aaron
Stern said here Thursday.
Stern discussed the "total education
submersion method" he developed to
educate his children.
In 1952, Stern claimed that he would
make his daughter "into the perfect
human being." By age 15. she became
a math professor at Michigan State
University. At age 20, she gained world
recognition for her work in cybernetics,
the comparative study of computers
and the human nervous system. Stern
said.
"I had to make a decision," Stern
told more than 1 50 listeners in Kresge
Auditorium. "Should I have a nice lit
tle girl or a bright youngster?" Stern
said he chose to mold a genius with the
techniques he developed.
Stern said his daughter's success
proves that the present education sys
tem wastes human potential. Children

are nourished by television for six years
before entering school, he said.
Formal education programs begin
too late and are part of a broader con
spiracy to maintain the status quo,
Stern said. The status quo is based on
"brutality, mediocrity and greed," he
said. He called iconoclasm,the struggle
against the status quo or tradition, "a
mark of distinction."
A victim of Nazi persecution in
Germany, he asked, "What is anti-
Semitism? Tradition. What is anti
black feeling? Tradition." Because of
this, Stern said he opposes institutions
that maintain the status quo. He re
peatedly referred to the "total educa
tion submersion method" as part of his
iconoclasm.
Stern explained that his method of
education begins with the assumption
that children learn from the first day of
birth and don't stop learning until
death.
Acquisition of learning and concept
building are the two basic components
of the learning process. Stern said.

He said he began his daughter Edith's
education right after her birth by talk
ing constantly to her. "Simply because
a child cannot talk does not mean he
cannot hear." he said.
Stern also exposed Edith to classical
music and Gregorian chants to give her
an aesthetic sense. By choice and by
poverty, television viewing was not
permitted in the Stern home, he said.
Stern condemned television for the
poor social models he said television
provides.
Frequent unemployment allowed
Stern to spend a great amount of time
with his daughter. He also removed her
from the public schools over the objec
tion of a Florida school superintendent.
Stern said his son David could not
achieve the success of his older sister
because David was "subjected" to the
public schools.
"Every component of society is
working to keep us down," Stern said,
and he listed his complaints about the
status quo.
He cited nuclear power and the acci

dent at the Three Mile Island power
plant. He said he was shocked that ig
norance permitted 20 percent of man
kind to live in the shadow of this
danger.
The acceptance of popular evangeli
cal figures such as Billy Graham, Oral
Roberts and Ann Landers was also
cited as part of'tocjay's accepted ignor
ance. "It takes iconoclasm to withstand
the pressure," Stern said.
Stern is the author of The Making of
a Genius and The Joy of Learning,
which received a nomination for the
Pulitzer Prize. The Naked Truth, his
latest effort, was also nominated for a
Pulitzer Prize. Stern received a Con
gressional commendation for his
pioneering efforts in education in
1973.
