# China asks VIA for students to teach English at major school
## 
### David Frank Staff Writer 
Several Stanford students will visit the People's Republic
of China as English teachers later this year after an invita
tion from the Chinese government to a local volunteer
organization.
The government has asked Volunteers in Asia (VIA) to
send two English teachers to Zhejiang University, one of
the nation's leading science-and-technology institutions.
Two other arrangements involving two to four more vol
unteers also are being explored by VIA.
VIA and the Yale in China programs are the only two
American volunteer organizations which have received
such invitations from China.
Each year VIA sends 35 to 40 Stanford volunteers to
East and Southeast Asia to work as English teachers and
village technology workers. The organization is based both
here and in Santa Cruz.
Invitation
According to Dwight Clark, VlA's Stanford program
director, the lead for an invitation to Zhejiang University
came from Asst. Prof. Dennis Chinn of the Food Research
Institute here.
Chinn visited the university last year, Clark said, and
recognized the "extraordinary interest" in English
teachers.
Upon his return he contacted Clark, who made prelimi
nary arrangements with a Zhejiang official last summer.
More correspondence and meetings with officials of the
Chinese consulate in San Francisco led to last week's invita
tion.

Under the arrangement, experienced volunteers will
teach English at the university for one year. Letters will be
sent to former Stanford VIA volunteers next month as the
selection process begins, Clark said.
He added that two to four more volunteers jobs may be
arranged. Shanghai University of Science and Technology
and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have indicated
interest in English teachers.
"China is gearing up in many fields, especially ones in
science and technology," Clark said. "We're confident that
the Chinese will want even more volunteers in the near
future since knowledge of English is a prerequisite for ad
vancing in so many technical fields. This could give VIA a
chance to open up many new volunteer positions."
Opportunities
At the request of several institutions, VIA sends its un
dergraduate and graduate volunteers on English teaching
assignments of six months to two years in six Asian coun
tries; Indonesia, Taiwan, the Philippines, Korea, Japan and
Sri Lanka. Some students work in health centers and col
leges; others work as technical advisers in villages and other
small communities.
According to Clark, the volunteer not only works within a
local institution, but he lives with an Asian family and
becomes part of an Asian neighborhood.
Before departure, new volunteers take language classes,
cross-cultural preparation and a course in teaching English
as a second language followed by classroom practice.
VIA generates two-thirds of its funds from the sale of
Asian travel and service publications, Clark said; the rest of
its income comes from donations.
