## United Nations headquarters bombarded U.N. troops on full alert 
### Larry Thorson The Associated Press 
TEL. AVIV. Israel — U.N.
peacekeeping troops went on full
alert in southern Lebanon yes
terday after a bloody clash with
Christian militiamen in a dis
puted village and a "savage"
bombardment of U N. head
quarters. U.N. officials reported.
Israel declared it had with
drawn the last of its soldiers from
southern Lebanon. A spokes
man for the military command
said, "The forces have com
pleted their tasks and have left
the area of south Lebanon."
The troops, estimated by U.N.
spokesmen to total about 350,
first entered Wednesday in re
taliation for a Palestinian guer
rilla attack on an Israeli border
settlement in which three Israelis

and five raiders were killed. But
Israeli television said the number
of troops was considerably
lower.
Top officers from the U.N.
force, from the Lebanese Christ
ian militias and from Israel,
which backs the militiamen, met
at the northern Israeli town of
Nazareth in an attempt to defuse
the explosive situation. No de
tails were given after the meet
ing. but Israeli television re
ported the commanders agreed
to confer again later in the week.
In New York, members of the
U.N. Security Council met at
Lebanon's request. Most of the
hour-long session was behind
closed doors, but it was opened
to the public to hear Secretary-
General Kurt VV'aldheim.
Waldheim claimed the

Lebanese militiamen had fired
tirst on the U.N. troops. His re
port said the U.N. force had been
subjected to "extreme difficul
ties and dangers" and had "exer
cised maximum restraint."
"However, soldiers cannot be
expected indefinitely to put up
with harrassment.abuse and vio
lence in carrying out the duties
entrusted to them by the Security
Council of the United Nations."
the report said.
The Israelis and Lebanese
Christians contend the U.N.
truce troops, supposedly a buffer
between Palestinian guerrillas
and the Israeli border, have
failed to stop guerrilla infiltra

tion.
Saturday's U.N.-militia clash
occurred at Tiri, a Un
controlled village five miles
north of the Israeli border where
Christian militia leader Maj.
Saad Haddad has been trying to
station some of his irregulars.
The U.N. forces and the
militiamen accused each other of
firing first, and there were vary
ing reports on casualties. It was
reported in Israel that a U.N.
soldier from Fiji, and two
Lebanese civilians were killed.
In Lebanon, reports said only the
Fijian and one militiaman were
killed, and eight other persons
were wounded.
