# Soviets ask for more troops in Afghanistan
## 
### Hubert J. Erb The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Deputy
Secretary of State Warren Chris
topher said yesterday that Soviet
generals in Afghanistan are ask
ing for still more troops because
of difficulties encountered there,
even though the Soviets already
have more than 100,000 men
stationed in the Southwest Asian
nation.
•'The Soviet Union is having a
great deal of difficulty in Af
ghanistan," Christopher said in a
nationally broadcast interview.
"Their generals are asking for
more troops. They are having a
great deal of difficulty with the
Afghan army. They're pouringin
additional troops. It's now well
over 100,000, probably over
1 1 0,000 (men)," he said.

Christopher's figures ex
ceeded previous U.S. estimates
of Soviet troop strength in Af
ghanistan since the Soviets
stormed into the country in late
December.
The State Department had
previously put the number of
Soviet troops at between 80.000
and 85,000 with another 20,000
to 30,000 massed on the borders
of Afghanistan.
Christopher made his remarks
on ABC-TV's Issues and
Answers.
Hostages ultimately freed
In another interview. Sen.
Frank Church (D-Idaho),
chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, said he
believes that ultimately, the hos
tages will be freed and that
negotiation is the only way to get

this done.
"Our purpose from the begin
ning was to get them home safely
and we've known from the be
ginning that there was no way
that we ourselves could rescue
them through any kind of milit
ary operation," he said.
"That has forced the president
to negotiate for their release. It's
been very frustrating. But it is
the only policy I know that has a
chance for success."
Church said he would give
Carter' the benefit of the doubt"
on whether he has been a tough
negotiator.
It was his own "gut feeling,"
Church said, "that in the end we
may be fortunate enough to get
these hostages out safely and re
turned to this country as well."
The senator appeared on
CBS-TV's Face the Nation.
