Have you ever wanted to apply your studies to social problems
right here in the Bay Area?
Have you ever wanted to work with a community group?
Have you ever wanted to research a current social issue?
Are you interested in: the health and employment problems of
the aged? Solar energy? Environmental issues? Our justice
and legal systems? Mental health? Housing? Women's
rights?
ARLO is the Action Research Liaison Office. We make it possible
for you to do research for community groups on current social
issues. Doing an ARLO project is very much like doing an indepen
dent research project. You work with a faculty sponsor and you get
academic credit, but with an ARLO project you also work with and for
an outside community group. ARLO serves as a link to the outside.
Interested? Many of our spring projects are listed in the Fieldwork
Clearinghouse Catalog, and we have additional projects listed in the
ARLO Office. Come in and take a look! We'd love to putyou to work!
