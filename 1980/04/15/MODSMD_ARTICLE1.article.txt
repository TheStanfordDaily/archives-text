# Hostages visited by Red Cross
## 
### William Branigin The Washington Post 
TEHRAN, Iran — Two Swiss Red
Cross officials yesterday visited the oc
cupied U.S. Embassy after reaching a
compromise on visitation terms with its
militant student captors and insisted
later that they had seen all the Ameri
can hostages.
"I will just tell you that I saw all of
the hostages, that it took eight hours
and that I'm rather tired," said Harald
Schrnid de Grueneck, the permanent
representative in Tehran of the
Geneva-based International Commit
tee of the Red Cross.
However, he refused to disclose
exactly how many hostages were vis
ited, apparently as part of an agree
ment with the captors designed to pave
the way for further possible visits.
De Grueneck and Dr. Bernard
Liebeskind, who flew from Geneva for
the visit, went to the embassy after they
had agreed to waive a normal Red
Cross condition that detainees be in
terviewed privately with no other ob
servers present.
"There were people around," de
Grueneck said. "We could not have
interviews without witnesses. But we
were allowed to see all of the hos
tages."
He added that the team took mes
sages from the captives, and that these
would be delivered to their families by
the end of the week. The Red Cross
officials were vague about how they
knew they had seen all the hostages,
and about where the interviews took
place. Pressed on the question, de
Grueneck said. "I've seen all of them,
according to the students." He added,
"I have a firm belief that I have seen all
of the hostages."
If the Red Cross officials were cor
rect, the visit would mark the first time
that independent foreign observers
have visited all the hostages since the
embassy was seized Nov. 4.
De Grueneck said that he had visited
one of several hostages who had not
been seen or heard from before and
reported that he was healthy. The Red
Cross officials said that at least one or
two of the Moslem students had been
present during all the interviews.
Liebeskind said the physical and
mental conditions of the hostages were
"not bad," and that he found only
"minor problems" among them. He
said they had regular access to medical
attention.
The Red Cross officials declined to
give further details of the hostages'
conditions and would not discuss re
ports that some of the captives were
suffering from depression.
De Grueneck said he felt that the
hostages talked freely despite the pre
sence of their captors. But he added,
"It was not a visit which was done
under strict ICRC conditions. We
nevertheless accepted to do it, because
we do believe that what we could do
was very useful for the families — and
we only think of the families — in the
States. As far as condition of detention
are concerned, a report will be done,
and I will have some further talks with
the students in order to improve what
has to be improved."
He added, "I do hope to be able to be
allowed to make regular visits. Of
course, I have no commitment from
their (the students') side as far as regu
lar visits are concerned. But they did
seem receptive."

De Grueneck said he had not con
sulted the U.S. government before the
visit on the conditions for seeing the
hostages.
"1 took this decision alone," he said,
referring to the waiver of standard Red
Cross terms for visits to detainees.
The Red Cross officials entered the
embassy shortly after 1 p.m. yesterday
and emerged shortly after 10 p.m.
After seeing the hostages, the officials
were interviewed by Iranian news
media before coming out of the em
bassy compound. Also visiting the em
bassy yesterday on the invitation of the
militants were Iran Health Minister Dr.
Musa Zargar; Terhran's Friday
prayers leader, Hojatoleslam Koham
med Ali Khamenehi, and a doctor from
the Red Lion and Sun Society, Iran's
equivalent of the Red Cross.
Late last night one of the American
hostages, believed to be political of
ficer John Limbert, Jr., 36, was shown
on Iranian television being visited by
Khamenehi.
Limbert, who speaks fluent Persian,
was shown having a conversation with
the Iranian clergyman in which the
prisoner said he thought the deposed
shah of Iran was "a criminal" and had

"no objection" to his return for trial to
Iran.
Asked about the conditions of his
detention, the hostage said they were
"good. What can we do? We have to
accept it."
Meanwhile, four ambassadors of
European Economic Community
countries left for their respective capi
tals yesterday, following a collective
decision to recall EEC envoys to pro
test lack of progress in resolving the
hostage issue. The envoys of four other
Common Market countries rep
resented here, plus Japan, are to depart
this week.
Diplomatic sources here said they
hoped the visit to the embassy would
clear up a mystery about the fate of
several hostages denounced by their
captors as "spies" and believed held in
solitary confinement. Among them are
said to be William Daugherty, Malcolm
Kalp, Thomas Ahem and Michael J.
Metrinko.
An embassy political officer and
former political consul in the north
western Iranian city of Tabris, Met
rinko is the only captive who has not
been reported seen by neutral outsid
ers or heard from by his family since the
embassy seizure.
Before the embassy visit yesterday a
senior Red Cross official said, 'Under
the circumstances, some of the condi
tions may have to be flexible, but we
have set conditions."
Informed sources said the Red Cross
insisted on seeing all the hostages and
that the militants softened some of
their own terms, notably that their be
no accounting of the hostages, and that
their names not be reported. The com
promise left open the possibility of the
Red Cross team's interviewing the hos
tages even though other Iranian vis
itors or representatives of the captors
themselves might be present, the
sources said.
Normally, the Red Cross insists that
in all visits to detainees the subject be
seen in his or her usual place of deten
tion, be interviewed with no other ob
server present and be allowed to fill out
a Red Cross questionnaire in complete
privacy.
Informed sources said the Red Cross
justified the softening of its terms by
saying that the embassy hostages con
stituted a special category, and that the
normal Red Cross regulations govern
ing visits to prisoners of war and other
detainees thus did not apply.
"It was important to see all of them,
and to get regular visits started and
build confidence with the students,"
one source said.
"Everything is discussion here; ev
erything is bargaining," another said.
"Seeing all the hostages was something
he (the Tehran Red Cross representa
tive) insisted on, but not at any price."
It was unclear here whether the U.S.
government had been consulted by the
Red Cross on the terms of the visit and
had approved them in the interest of
having all the hostages seen by a neut
ral outsider for the first time.

med Ali Khamenehi, and a doctor from
the Red Lion and Sun Society, Iran's
equivalent of the Red Cross.
Late last night one of the American
hostages, believed to be political of
ficer John Limbert, Jr., 36, was shown
on Iranian television being visited by
Khamenehi.
Limbert, who speaks fluent Persian,
was shown having a conversation with
the Iranian clergyman in which the
prisoner said he thought the deposed
shah of Iran was "a criminal" and had

"no objection" to his return for trial to
Iran.
Asked about the conditions of his
detention, the hostage said they were
"good. What can we do? We have to
accept it."
Meanwhile, four ambassadors of
European Economic Community
countries left for their respective capi
tals yesterday, following a collective
decision to recall EEC envoys to pro
test lack of progress in resolving the
hostage issue. The envoys of four other
Common Market countries rep
resented here, plus Japan, are to depart
this week.
Diplomatic sources here said they
hoped the visit to the embassy would
clear up a mystery about the fate of
several hostages denounced by their
captors as "spies" and believed held in
solitary confinement. Among them are
said to be William Daugherty, Malcolm
Kalp, Thomas Ahem and Michael J.
Metrinko.
An embassy political officer and
former political consul in the north
western Iranian city of Tabris, Met
rinko is the only captive who has not
been reported seen by neutral outsid
ers or heard from by his family since the
embassy seizure.
Before the embassy visit yesterday a
senior Red Cross official said, 'Under
the circumstances, some of the condi
tions may have to be flexible, but we
have set conditions."
Informed sources said the Red Cross
insisted on seeing all the hostages and
that the militants softened some of
their own terms, notably that their be
no accounting of the hostages, and that
their names not be reported. The com
promise left open the possibility of the
Red Cross team's interviewing the hos
tages even though other Iranian vis
itors or representatives of the captors
themselves might be present, the
sources said.
Normally, the Red Cross insists that
in all visits to detainees the subject be
seen in his or her usual place of deten
tion, be interviewed with no other ob
server present and be allowed to fill out
a Red Cross questionnaire in complete
privacy.
Informed sources said the Red Cross
justified the softening of its terms by
saying that the embassy hostages con
stituted a special category, and that the
normal Red Cross regulations govern
ing visits to prisoners of war and other
detainees thus did not apply.
"It was important to see all of them,
and to get regular visits started and
build confidence with the students,"
one source said.
"Everything is discussion here; ev
erything is bargaining," another said.
"Seeing all the hostages was something
he (the Tehran Red Cross representa
tive) insisted on, but not at any price."
It was unclear here whether the U.S.
government had been consulted by the
Red Cross on the terms of the visit and
had approved them in the interest of
having all the hostages seen by a neut
ral outsider for the first time.
TEHRAN, Iran — Two Swiss Red
Cross officials yesterday visited the oc
cupied U.S. Embassy after reaching a
compromise on visitation terms with its
militant student captors and insisted
later that they had seen all the Ameri
can hostages.
"I will just tell you that I saw all of
the hostages, that it took eight hours
and that I'm rather tired," said Harald
Schrnid de Grueneck, the permanent
representative in Tehran of the
Geneva-based International Commit
tee of the Red Cross.
However, he refused to disclose
exactly how many hostages were vis
ited, apparently as part of an agree
ment with the captors designed to pave
the way for further possible visits.
De Grueneck and Dr. Bernard
Liebeskind, who flew from Geneva for
the visit, went to the embassy after they
had agreed to waive a normal Red
Cross condition that detainees be in
terviewed privately with no other ob
servers present.
"There were people around," de
Grueneck said. "We could not have
interviews without witnesses. But we
were allowed to see all of the hos
tages."
He added that the team took mes
sages from the captives, and that these
would be delivered to their families by
the end of the week. The Red Cross
officials were vague about how they
knew they had seen all the hostages,
and about where the interviews took
place. Pressed on the question, de
Grueneck said. "I've seen all of them,
according to the students." He added,
"I have a firm belief that I have seen all
of the hostages."
If the Red Cross officials were cor
rect, the visit would mark the first time
that independent foreign observers
have visited all the hostages since the
embassy was seized Nov. 4.
De Grueneck said that he had visited
one of several hostages who had not
been seen or heard from before and
reported that he was healthy. The Red
Cross officials said that at least one or
two of the Moslem students had been
present during all the interviews.
Liebeskind said the physical and
mental conditions of the hostages were
"not bad," and that he found only
"minor problems" among them. He
said they had regular access to medical
attention.
The Red Cross officials declined to
give further details of the hostages'
conditions and would not discuss re
ports that some of the captives were
suffering from depression.
De Grueneck said he felt that the
hostages talked freely despite the pre
sence of their captors. But he added,
"It was not a visit which was done
under strict ICRC conditions. We
nevertheless accepted to do it, because
we do believe that what we could do
was very useful for the families — and
we only think of the families — in the
States. As far as condition of detention
are concerned, a report will be done,
and I will have some further talks with
the students in order to improve what
has to be improved."
He added, "I do hope to be able to be
allowed to make regular visits. Of
course, I have no commitment from
their (the students') side as far as regu
lar visits are concerned. But they did
seem receptive."

De Grueneck said he had not con
sulted the U.S. government before the
visit on the conditions for seeing the
hostages.
"1 took this decision alone," he said,
referring to the waiver of standard Red
Cross terms for visits to detainees.
The Red Cross officials entered the
embassy shortly after 1 p.m. yesterday
and emerged shortly after 10 p.m.
After seeing the hostages, the officials
were interviewed by Iranian news
media before coming out of the em
bassy compound. Also visiting the em
bassy yesterday on the invitation of the
militants were Iran Health Minister Dr.
