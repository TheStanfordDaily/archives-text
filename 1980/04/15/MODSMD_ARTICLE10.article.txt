# U.S., Oman forge military alliance
## 
### Doyle McManus The Los Angeles Times 
MUSCAT. Oman — The Un
ited States and Oman have com
pleted the first phase of negotia
tions toward a new military al
liance that will allow U.S. forces
to use bases near the Persian
Gulf in exchange for a commit
ment to defend Oman, diplomats
said last week.
But while the talks are "going
well," officials said, the Omanis
are bargaining hard — perhaps
harder than the United States
anticipated. Sources familiar
with the negotiations described
as premature a statement by De
fense Undersecretary Robert
Komer that American techni
cians will soon be based in Oman
and elsewhere.
The two countries have
reached basic agreement on a
new military relationship under
which the U.S. Air Force will
gain access to three Omani air
bases, one of them within 240
miles of the Strait of Hormuz,
the entrance to the gulf through
which most of the West's oil pas
ses. The U.S. Navy will also be
granted facilities atOman's two
ports.
In return, the United States
will pay for improvements to the
air and naval bases, supply the
Omani armed forces with new
weaponry and pledge to defend
the remote Arab principality in
the event of Soviet attack, offi
cials said.
Key element
The negotiations with Oman,
located on the southern side of
the Strait of Hormuz, opposite
Iran, are a key element iq Presi
dent Carter's plans for a Rapid
Deployment Force to defend the
gulf oil fields. The Omani bases
are much closer to the gulf than
possible U.S. facilities in Kenya
and Somalia, which are also
being negotiated, or the existing
U.S. naval base on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
Oman, led by the youthful,
British-educated Sultan Kaboos
ibn Saidc, has emerged from a
generation of isolation con
vinced that Moscow has a master
plan for eventual control of the
gulf region. The United States is
at least suspicious of the Kremlin
motives. Faced with the threat,
the Kansas-sized Sultanate of
Oman has become the sentinel of
the Hormuz Strait, the spigot
through which flows 90 percent
of Japan's oil, 65 percent of

Western Europe's and 30 per
cent of the United States'.
Two years ago Kaboos wrote
President Carter asking the Un
ited States to take a firmer posi
tion in deterring Soviet moves in
the Persian Gulf and the Horn of
Africa. The White House wrote
back politely, thanking Kaboos
for sharing his views. As it turned
out, the sultan's fears were
prophetic, and Washington
began scrambling early this year
to find military facilities from
which it could deploy a strike
force if necessary to protect U.S.
oil interests in the gulf.
It turned to Kenya, Somalia
and Oman seeking long-term
rights to use their air and naval
facilities in an emergency. Kenya
agreed outright and Somalia is
prepared to do likewise, if
Washington offers sufficient
military and development aid.
Washington also has secured
what Omani officials call a gent
lemen's agreement giving the
United States increased access to
military facilities in Oman, pend
ing a more formal arrangement.
Military aid
What Oman wants from
Washington is military assistance
— anti-aircraft and
anti-tank weapons — and assur
ances of U.S. action in the event
of a Soviet threat to the strait.
Western sources said
Washington has agreed in prin
ciple to initially sell Oman about
$15 million in arms and to make
the improvements necessary to
upgrade Oman's airfields and
ports to handle a rapidly de
ployed force.
But a spokesman for Sultan
Kaboos kaid. "There is no inten
tion of having Americans in
Oman."
Too close
The Omanis are sensitive to
charges by other Arab countries
that they are collaborating too
closely with the United States,
and they fear that a large and
obtrusive American presence
could arouse domestic resent
ment. Oman is the only country
on the Arabian Peninsula that
has not broken diplomatic rela
tions with Egypt over President
Anwar Sadat's peace treaty with
Israel.
The proposed U.S. commit
ment to Oman's security would
apply only in the case of a mas
sive Soviet — or possibly Iranian
— attack across the gulf, dip
lomats said. In the event of

smaller-scale hostilities, such as
a new war with South Yemen —
Oman's Marxist neighbor, which
supported a five-year rebellion
against the sultan — Kaboos
would ask only for American
weapons and supplies, the dip
lomats said.
"The Americans are definitely
going to provide his majesty with
all the weapons he needs," a
palace spokesman said.
The conditions under which
U.S. forces could use the bases

being discussed are not clear.
The locations are Sib air base
near the capital, Masirah Island
air base off the eastern coast and
Thumrait air base in southern
Oman, as well as the naval
facilities at the ports of Matrah
and Salalah. Some diplomats
said Masirah, an uninhabited is
land, would appear ideal for a
low-profile U.S. facility — but it
is difficult to use during the mon
soon season from June to Sep
tember.

MUSCAT. Oman — The Un
ited States and Oman have com
pleted the first phase of negotia
tions toward a new military al
liance that will allow U.S. forces
to use bases near the Persian
Gulf in exchange for a commit
ment to defend Oman, diplomats
said last week.
But while the talks are "going
well," officials said, the Omanis
are bargaining hard — perhaps
harder than the United States
anticipated. Sources familiar
with the negotiations described
as premature a statement by De
fense Undersecretary Robert
Komer that American techni
cians will soon be based in Oman
and elsewhere.
The two countries have
reached basic agreement on a
new military relationship under
which the U.S. Air Force will
gain access to three Omani air
bases, one of them within 240
miles of the Strait of Hormuz,
the entrance to the gulf through
which most of the West's oil pas
ses. The U.S. Navy will also be
granted facilities atOman's two
ports.
In return, the United States
will pay for improvements to the
air and naval bases, supply the
Omani armed forces with new
weaponry and pledge to defend
the remote Arab principality in
the event of Soviet attack, offi
cials said.
Key element
The negotiations with Oman,
located on the southern side of
the Strait of Hormuz, opposite
Iran, are a key element iq Presi
dent Carter's plans for a Rapid
Deployment Force to defend the
gulf oil fields. The Omani bases
are much closer to the gulf than
possible U.S. facilities in Kenya
and Somalia, which are also
being negotiated, or the existing
U.S. naval base on the Indian
Ocean island of Diego Garcia.
Oman, led by the youthful,
British-educated Sultan Kaboos
ibn Saidc, has emerged from a
generation of isolation con
vinced that Moscow has a master
plan for eventual control of the
gulf region. The United States is
at least suspicious of the Kremlin
motives. Faced with the threat,
the Kansas-sized Sultanate of
Oman has become the sentinel of
the Hormuz Strait, the spigot
through which flows 90 percent
of Japan's oil, 65 percent of

Western Europe's and 30 per
cent of the United States'.
Two years ago Kaboos wrote
President Carter asking the Un
ited States to take a firmer posi
tion in deterring Soviet moves in
the Persian Gulf and the Horn of
Africa. The White House wrote
back politely, thanking Kaboos
for sharing his views. As it turned
out, the sultan's fears were
prophetic, and Washington
began scrambling early this year
to find military facilities from
which it could deploy a strike
force if necessary to protect U.S.
oil interests in the gulf.
It turned to Kenya, Somalia
and Oman seeking long-term
rights to use their air and naval
facilities in an emergency. Kenya
agreed outright and Somalia is
prepared to do likewise, if
Washington offers sufficient
military and development aid.
Washington also has secured
what Omani officials call a gent
lemen's agreement giving the
United States increased access to
military facilities in Oman, pend
ing a more formal arrangement.
Military aid
What Oman wants from
Washington is military assistance
— anti-aircraft and
anti-tank weapons — and assur
ances of U.S. action in the event
of a Soviet threat to the strait.
Western sources said
Washington has agreed in prin
ciple to initially sell Oman about
$15 million in arms and to make
the improvements necessary to
upgrade Oman's airfields and
ports to handle a rapidly de
ployed force.
But a spokesman for Sultan
Kaboos kaid. "There is no inten
tion of having Americans in
Oman."
Too close
The Omanis are sensitive to
charges by other Arab countries
that they are collaborating too
closely with the United States,
and they fear that a large and
obtrusive American presence
could arouse domestic resent
ment. Oman is the only country
on the Arabian Peninsula that
has not broken diplomatic rela
tions with Egypt over President
Anwar Sadat's peace treaty with
Israel.
The proposed U.S. commit
ment to Oman's security would
apply only in the case of a mas
sive Soviet — or possibly Iranian
— attack across the gulf, dip
lomats said. In the event of

smaller-scale hostilities, such as
a new war with South Yemen —
Oman's Marxist neighbor, which
supported a five-year rebellion
against the sultan — Kaboos
would ask only for American
weapons and supplies, the dip
lomats said.
"The Americans are definitely
going to provide his majesty with
all the weapons he needs," a
palace spokesman said.
The conditions under which
U.S. forces could use the bases

being discussed are not clear.
The locations are Sib air base
near the capital, Masirah Island
air base off the eastern coast and
Thumrait air base in southern
Oman, as well as the naval
facilities at the ports of Matrah
and Salalah. Some diplomats
said Masirah, an uninhabited is
land, would appear ideal for a
low-profile U.S. facility — but it
is difficult to use during the mon
soon season from June to Sep
