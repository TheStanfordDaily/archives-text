# Nicaragua gains Soviet bloc aid
## 
### Terri Shaw The Washington Post 
MANAGUA, Nicaragua
— A high-level Nicaraguan
delegation has returned from
a lengthy tour of Eastern
Europe with a substantial aid
package and agreements to
strengthen ties with the
Soviet Bloc.
The tour by Moises Hassan
of the ruling five-member
junta and three key leaders of
the controlling Sandinista Na
tional Liberation Front, illus
trates the government's deci
sion to diversify its interna
tional relations after decades
of close U.S. ties fostered by
dictator Anastasio Somoza,
who was ousted last July. It
should result in a substantial
increase in the Soviet pre
sence in volatile Central
America.
On the month-long tour,
the Nicaraguan delegation
signed joint communiques
with the Soviet Union and
East Germany that followed
the Soviet line on almost all
international issues, including
Afghanistan.
The communique with
Moscow condemned "the
campaign by imperialist and
reactionary forces to increase
international tension around
the events in Afghanistan."
The campaign, it said, aims to
"stifle the inalienable right of
the people of. . . Afghanistan
... to follow the road of prog
ressive change."
Non-aligned?
While the Soviets and the
Nicaraguans agreed on a
whole litany of issues, most of
the positions — such as on
Middle East issues — coin
cide with those of the non
aligned movement.
Nicaragua's new government
identifies closely with these
Third World approaches.
Interior Minister Tomas
Borge made a speech in Mos
cow stressing Nicaragua's "ir
revocable decision to be
free." He told Soviet leaders
at a luncheon that Nicara
guans intend to "continue
being the masters of our own
destiny."
While that delegation was
in Eastern Europe, another
headed by junta member Ser
gio Ramirez and Sandinista
leader Bayardo Arce was
touring Western Europe. At
the same time, Daniel
Ortega, a member of the
junta and the nine-man na
tional directorate, visited
several Latin American coun
tries and the Vatican.
U.S. loan slow
The Nicaraguan leaders'
travels came at the same time
that a $75 million U.S. loan to
Nicaragua was stalled in Con
gress. Seeking new sources of
aid was an important goal of

the trips.
Ramirez and Arce an
nounced that they had re
ceived pledges of about $55
million in loans, grants and
emergency aid from the
European Community as well
as Belgium, the Netherlands,
West Germany, Sweden, Au
stria and the special fund of
the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
based in Vienna.
The total amount of aid ob
tained on the trip to Eastern
Europe has not been an
nounced. Press reports from
Prague said Czechoslovakia
had provided a $20 million
loan and a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said new East
German aid would total $30
million.
The delegation to the
Soviet Bloc was nominally
headed by Hassan, a hard
line leftist. The three mem
bers of the Sandinista na
tional directorate who went
on the trip are considered to
be among the most powerful
men in Nicaragua: Borge,
who as interior minister con
trols the police. Army com
mander Humberto Oj-tega
and the popular former guer
rilla commander Henry
who has taken over the im
portant Economic Planning
Ministry.
In Moscow, the Sandinista
front signed a "cooperation
program" with the Soviet
Communist Party.
Red carpet
The communist govern
ments rolled out the red car
pet for the Nicaraguans. Ac
cording to reports by a cor
respondent for the Sandinista
newspaper Barricada who
went along, the Nicaraguans
were cheered by thousands of
flag-waving Soviet citizens in
Leningrad.
In each country, the
Nicaraguans signed agree
ments on trade, economic and
technical aid and cultural ex
change. The Soviet Union has
promised to aid the Nicara
guan fishing industry and
Czechoslovakia is committed
to help build a textile factory.
Nicaraguan leaders,
angered by delays and debate
in Washington over U.S. aid,
stress that aid from Eastern
and Western Europe is "abso
lutely without conditions." A
Soviet ambassador is to arrive
here next week, and the
Soviet airline Aeroflot wil
begin flights to Managua next
month.
The only other Soviet em
bassy on the Central Ameri
can isthmus is in Costa Rica.
The Soviets also have an em
bassy in Mexico and are a
major presence in Cuba, a
close ally of Nicaragua's new
government.

The communist govern
ments rolled out the red car
pet for the Nicaraguans. Ac
cording to reports by a cor
respondent for the Sandinista
newspaper Barricada who
went along, the Nicaraguans
were cheered by thousands of
flag-waving Soviet citizens in
Leningrad.
In each country, the
Nicaraguans signed agree
ments on trade, economic and
technical aid and cultural ex
change. The Soviet Union has
promised to aid the Nicara
guan fishing industry and
Czechoslovakia is committed
to help build a textile factory.
Nicaraguan leaders,
angered by delays and debate
in Washington over U.S. aid,
stress that aid from Eastern
and Western Europe is "abso
lutely without conditions." A
Soviet ambassador is to arrive
here next week, and the
Soviet airline Aeroflot wil
begin flights to Managua next
month.
The only other Soviet em
bassy on the Central Ameri
can isthmus is in Costa Rica.
The Soviets also have an em
bassy in Mexico and are a
major presence in Cuba, a
close ally of Nicaragua's new
government.
MANAGUA, Nicaragua
— A high-level Nicaraguan
delegation has returned from
a lengthy tour of Eastern
Europe with a substantial aid
package and agreements to
strengthen ties with the
Soviet Bloc.
The tour by Moises Hassan
of the ruling five-member
junta and three key leaders of
the controlling Sandinista Na
tional Liberation Front, illus
trates the government's deci
sion to diversify its interna
tional relations after decades
of close U.S. ties fostered by
dictator Anastasio Somoza,
who was ousted last July. It
should result in a substantial
increase in the Soviet pre
sence in volatile Central
America.
On the month-long tour,
the Nicaraguan delegation
signed joint communiques
with the Soviet Union and
East Germany that followed
the Soviet line on almost all
international issues, including
Afghanistan.
The communique with
Moscow condemned "the
campaign by imperialist and
reactionary forces to increase
international tension around
the events in Afghanistan."
The campaign, it said, aims to
"stifle the inalienable right of
the people of. . . Afghanistan
... to follow the road of prog
ressive change."
Non-aligned?
While the Soviets and the
Nicaraguans agreed on a
whole litany of issues, most of
the positions — such as on
Middle East issues — coin
cide with those of the non
aligned movement.
Nicaragua's new government
identifies closely with these
Third World approaches.
Interior Minister Tomas
Borge made a speech in Mos
cow stressing Nicaragua's "ir
revocable decision to be
free." He told Soviet leaders
at a luncheon that Nicara
guans intend to "continue
being the masters of our own
destiny."
While that delegation was
in Eastern Europe, another
headed by junta member Ser
gio Ramirez and Sandinista
leader Bayardo Arce was
touring Western Europe. At
the same time, Daniel
Ortega, a member of the
junta and the nine-man na
tional directorate, visited
several Latin American coun
tries and the Vatican.
U.S. loan slow
The Nicaraguan leaders'
travels came at the same time
that a $75 million U.S. loan to
Nicaragua was stalled in Con
gress. Seeking new sources of
aid was an important goal of

the trips.
Ramirez and Arce an
nounced that they had re
ceived pledges of about $55
million in loans, grants and
emergency aid from the
European Community as well
as Belgium, the Netherlands,
West Germany, Sweden, Au
stria and the special fund of
the Organization of Pet
roleum Exporting Countries
based in Vienna.
The total amount of aid ob
tained on the trip to Eastern
Europe has not been an
nounced. Press reports from
Prague said Czechoslovakia
had provided a $20 million
loan and a Foreign Ministry
spokesman said new East
German aid would total $30
million.
The delegation to the
Soviet Bloc was nominally
headed by Hassan, a hard
line leftist. The three mem
bers of the Sandinista na
tional directorate who went
on the trip are considered to
be among the most powerful
men in Nicaragua: Borge,
who as interior minister con
trols the police. Army com
mander Humberto Oj-tega
and the popular former guer
rilla commander Henry
who has taken over the im
portant Economic Planning
Ministry.
In Moscow, the Sandinista
front signed a "cooperation
program" with the Soviet
Communist Party.
