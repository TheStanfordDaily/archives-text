ESTES PARK. Colo. (AP) —
The American public has a pow
erful grass-roots commitment to
ecological issues despite the bur
dens of an economy seemingly
gone haywire, top environmen
talists say.
But environmentalists admit
their movement has failed to ef
fectively tap that commitment 10
years after enactment of the Na
tional Environmental Protection
Act.
Most foresee a shfift from the
anti-pollution questions of the
past two decades to "empty
belly" issues, the foremost of
which is energy.
And they say that to win broad
support, they will have to change
their image as tweed-jacketed
birdwatchers and backpackers
ready to shut down the plant at
the edge of town.

About 280 persons turned out
for the Environmental Decade
Conference here.
The three-day gathering,
which ended Sunday, was held in
a mountain valley high in the
Front Range of the Colorado
Rockies about 80 miles north
west of Denver.
The only specific action taken
by the gathering was a letter to
President Jimmy Carter asking
him to help prevent the proposed
Energy Mobilization Board from
being given the power to waive
local environmental standards in
clearing the way for energy pro
jects.
Conferees also listed hazard
ous waste disposal, "acid rain"
from burning fossil fuels, and ag
ricultural conservation as key is
sues for the decade.
