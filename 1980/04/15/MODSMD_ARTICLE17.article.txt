# SLE is misrepresented
## 
### 
At any prestigious institution
of higher education, some
amount of anti-intellectual
backlash has to be expected. But
when this trend persists to the
extent that a recognized campus
publication criticizes and mis
represents, with blatant inac
curacies, a bona fide effort to
ward academic enrichment, I
must protest. 1 refer, of course,
to the scandalous representation
in last month's Chaparral of the
Stanford program in Structured
Liberal Education (SLE).
First, the Chaparral represents
the program's director as being
under the illusion that he is some
sort of god. 11l is is not true; as a
student of SLE 1 have heard The
Professor mention several times
the possibility of some supreme
being greater than himself. Why.
He even refrains from referring
to those in his discussion section
as "disciples," and now says
modestly, "followers."
Furthermore, I feel that the
depiction of The Professor as
one who will not tolerate any var
iety of student input is in error.
On the contrary. The Professor
listens to virtually every aspect of
student opinion, mercifully in
forms those in disagreement with
Him of their status as ig
noramuses, and rewards those
fortunate enough to be on the
same intellectual plane as The
Professor. A real Humanist.
Another victim of unfair criti
cism is the instructor in SLE af
fectionately referred to by stu
dents as "Big Jon," which is, as
far as 1 know, the origin of his
nickname: B.J.
The Chaparral seems to imply
that Big Jon's academic status
detracts from his skills as an in
structor. On the contrary, many
of the freshmen prefer an occa
sional lecture from a fellow stu

dent, as a change of pace from
the real teachers.
The magazine also was unfair
in depicting B.J. as the antithesis
of an authority figure. While we
all have our shortcomings, Big
Jon is in fact a well-respected
disciplinarian. 1 understand that
he is largely responsible for the
fact that no SLE paper has been

tumed in late in seven years with
the program.
What bothers me most about
the Chaparral piece is that it
gives an overall impression of a
facet of the University commun
ity with which very few of us have
actual experience, and this could
be a lasting impression.
Already the campus-wide
misconceptions about SLE
abound. For instance, because the
program is dorm-based, it is
thought that the students tend
to stick together in some sort of
self-imposed exclusive academic
elitism.
This idea is simply untrue.
Why, some of my best friends are
non-SLE people. We even let
them sit at our table at dinner
sometimes.
The residential nature of the
program is the impetus for
further gossip as well. 1 would
like to dispel once and for all
rumors of an attempt by SLE
freshmen to create a Sigma
Lambda Epsilon fraternity for

former SLE students to continue
their residential exclusivity. I
know for a fact that all plans for
that project were scrapped
weeks ago.
Leaving these misconceptions
behind, a true understanding of
SLE comes from the name of the
program itself.
Structured means philosophi-

cally structuralist, not academi
cally ordered.
Liberal means politically lib
eral. not broadly educational.
Education is whatever the
SLE staft decides should be in
the student's mind when he
leaves the program.
Perhaps there should be an al
ternative called the program in
Structured Conservative Educa
tion, with The Wealth of Nations
and Marx as required texts.
There is one final false impres
sion of SLE that 1 feel 1 must
correct. SLE students are widely
thought of as verbose in both
writing and speech, and are said
to search the thesaurus for the
most highbrow way of expressing
themselves. I can only say that
those inerudite troglodytes who
hold this perfidious ideation
should consider a hasty gestalt
switch to a more fitting
paradigm.
