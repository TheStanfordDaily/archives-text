## Don Caughey Buckley offers elitism, cynicism 
### 
-1 hope those students who packed Cub
berly Auditorium to hear TV's star reactio
nary ideologue on April 7 were not bam
boozled by William F. Buckley's wit so that
they could not see through his claim to voice
"the politics of reality." The politics of
elitism and cynicism is what he offers, and the
targets of his wit are the inadequate and sub
verted programs through which the meager
efforts of government to redress the regres
sive effects of the private sector have been
waged.
To those who believe that the poor cause
poverty or who have renounced all social
responsibility for others, Buckley might be
both witty and appealing. But to anyone
whose sense of realism includes the impera
tive of social justice, it ain't funny anymore.
Buckley's total support for the arms race
belies his claim to care about a free market
economy. He is for the defense of privilege
and nothing more.
The obstacle to upward mobility in the
American social pyramid is that it is narrow
at the top. Inflation, the decrease in stan
dard of living for the middle class (apart

from the impact of energy costs) and the
arrogant disregard for patriotism shown by
big oil have a lot more to do with decreases in
productivity than do income taxes or gov
ernmental restrictions. But it is the military
industrial complex that prevents the success
of attempts to return to a free market or to
give social needs adequate attention.
1 am not ready to say that there is no way
the federal government can be used to com
pensate for the limits of a free market
economy to address long-range social needs.
I believe it is realistic to expect people to
pursue economic interests and try to keep
what they have; but I think the dreams of
most people are modest and include the abil
ity to live in good communities, drink good
water, have good schools and know that
there will be health care and community ser
vice provided to those who need them at an
affordable price. If you think the government
cannot provide those things, do you think the
private sector will do better? i see no evi
dence that it has, will or even atttempts to do
so.
For those who think centralism is the prob

lem and who favor local solutions to federal
programs, I would suggest that it is terribly
naive to want a centralized, high-technology
military establishment together with free
rein for industrial and corporate centraliza
tion and to ask human needs to be met on a
local scale. True conservatives would not
want big government in some areas, big cor
porations in most areas and localism foisted
off on those who are outside the club. And
until I hear conservatism presented in a con
sistent fashion, I will not be able to take it as a
serious political philosophy.
Buckley, Howard Jarvis and all those who
pander to elitism, privilege and fear, claim
that they believe in democracy. To those who
can see where their policies lead, such claims
are not only unrealistic and dishonest, they
are blasphemous because they destroy the
possibility that freedom and justice might
exist together. Conservatives should be
ashamed to have this twaddle proclaimed in
their name.
