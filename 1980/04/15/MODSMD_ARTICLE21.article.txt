## East Asian House group criticizes Lyons 
### 
We, the students of the East Asian
Studies Theme House Core Committee,
feel that Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons' unilateral decision to reinstate the
French house, thus denying our proposal
for facilities, is unfair for five reasons.
First, the Office of Student Affairs is an
inadequate forum for an appeal. A deci
sion concerning theme house facilities has
an impact both on curriculum and on pro
jects and programs that affect the com
munity at large. Thus, such a decision af
fects not only students living in theme
houses but faculty and other students as
well. A decision concerning theme house
facilities should be made in a committee,
such as the Committee on Services to Stu
dents Subcommittee on Residences
(COSS/R) comprised of representatives
from several different segments of the
University community, not by a single in
dividual from the administration.
Second, the decision itself violated
basic tenets of due process. No one from
the East Asian Studies House was con
tacted or had a chance to present his posi

tion before Lyons' decision was made.
Lyons explained (Daily, Mar. 31) his
reason for not contacting us as follows:
"They are two independent judgments.
We are not pitting one theme house
against another." Yet Associate Dean for
Residential Education Norm Robinson
has stated that in essence the two propos
als were linked. In the Mar. 3 issue of the
Daily Robinson states, "This is definitely
a zero-sum game: in order to get a new
house into the system something else
must go." Since these two proposals were
in fact linked, a fact seemingly recognized
by everyone but Lyons, we should have at
least been informed that an appeal was in
process and had an opportunity to present
our views.
Third, the decision sets a dangerous
precedent. Two years ago, when no sys
tem existed for evaluating extant and
proposed theme houses, our proposal was
approved. However our proposal was not
implemented because of a lack of facilities
caused by the absence of an evaluation
system.

Last spring an evaluation system was
set up. Each theme house was given warn
ing and was informed about the details of
the process and the criteria by which each
house would be judged. Under this sys
tem COSS/R again approved our prop
osal and recommended that the French
house be discontinued. This recommen
dation was accepted by Robinson, but
Lyons unilaterally abrogated the rules
and procedures adopted by COSS/R.
Fourth, the decision was unfair with re
spect to its timing. The decision was made
Thursday of Dead Week, a time when
students are studying for final examina
tions and professors are preparing end of
quarter reports. We were not informed of
the decision until Friday via the
grapevine. Our only opportunity to meet
with Lyons was during Finals Week. Such
a procedure is highly irregularand unfair.
Finally, the decision will have a chilling
effect on future efforts to organize such a
house. It might be argued that if the idea is
a good one then students will continue to
be enthusiastic for it in future years.
However, students are likely to become

discouraged if the University administra
tion demonstrates a consistently negative
attitude no matter how good the proposal
is.
Our proposal has strong support. Last
year over 75 students signed petitions
stating their desire to live in an East Asian
Studies Theme House. This year over 25
people signed up for staff positions alone.
Furthermore, our proposal has the sup
port of over 40 faculty members from a
broad range of academic disciplines. This
is the most faculty support a theme house
has ever received. In addition our prop
osal has received $3000 from the Japan
Fund and additional pledges of financial
support from the Center for East Asian
Studies.
It is a shame that Lyons' unfair, unilat
eral decision has the effect of again deny
ing facilities to a proposal with so much
potential.

sion concerning theme house facilities has
an impact both on curriculum and on pro
jects and programs that affect the com
munity at large. Thus, such a decision af
fects not only students living in theme
houses but faculty and other students as
well. A decision concerning theme house
facilities should be made in a committee,
such as the Committee on Services to Stu
dents Subcommittee on Residences
(COSS/R) comprised of representatives
from several different segments of the
University community, not by a single in
dividual from the administration.
Second, the decision itself violated
basic tenets of due process. No one from
the East Asian Studies House was con
tacted or had a chance to present his posi

tion before Lyons' decision was made.
Lyons explained (Daily, Mar. 31) his
reason for not contacting us as follows:
"They are two independent judgments.
We are not pitting one theme house
against another." Yet Associate Dean for
Residential Education Norm Robinson
has stated that in essence the two propos
als were linked. In the Mar. 3 issue of the
Daily Robinson states, "This is definitely
a zero-sum game: in order to get a new
house into the system something else
must go." Since these two proposals were
in fact linked, a fact seemingly recognized
by everyone but Lyons, we should have at
least been informed that an appeal was in
process and had an opportunity to present
our views.
Third, the decision sets a dangerous
precedent. Two years ago, when no sys
tem existed for evaluating extant and
proposed theme houses, our proposal was
approved. However our proposal was not
implemented because of a lack of facilities
caused by the absence of an evaluation
system.

Last spring an evaluation system was
set up. Each theme house was given warn
ing and was informed about the details of
the process and the criteria by which each
house would be judged. Under this sys
tem COSS/R again approved our prop
osal and recommended that the French
house be discontinued. This recommen
dation was accepted by Robinson, but
Lyons unilaterally abrogated the rules
and procedures adopted by COSS/R.
Fourth, the decision was unfair with re
spect to its timing. The decision was made
Thursday of Dead Week, a time when
students are studying for final examina
tions and professors are preparing end of
quarter reports. We were not informed of
the decision until Friday via the
grapevine. Our only opportunity to meet
with Lyons was during Finals Week. Such
a procedure is highly irregularand unfair.
Finally, the decision will have a chilling
effect on future efforts to organize such a
house. It might be argued that if the idea is
a good one then students will continue to
be enthusiastic for it in future years.
However, students are likely to become

discouraged if the University administra
tion demonstrates a consistently negative
attitude no matter how good the proposal
is.
Our proposal has strong support. Last
year over 75 students signed petitions
stating their desire to live in an East Asian
Studies Theme House. This year over 25
people signed up for staff positions alone.
Furthermore, our proposal has the sup
port of over 40 faculty members from a
broad range of academic disciplines. This
is the most faculty support a theme house
has ever received. In addition our prop
osal has received $3000 from the Japan
Fund and additional pledges of financial
support from the Center for East Asian
Studies.
It is a shame that Lyons' unfair, unilat
eral decision has the effect of again deny
ing facilities to a proposal with so much
potential.
