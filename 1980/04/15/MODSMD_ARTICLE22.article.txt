Frat incident
I am writing in response to the
Daily's article of April 10 in
order to present the facts of
last Monday night's incident at
the KA's.
First of all, the article was writ
ten without consulting either of
the "victims" involved. From
reading the article, one would as
sume that Mike McCarthy and I
were the only ones jumping off
the loft; however, approximately
10 people jumped before me,
and there was a line stretching
down the stairs of people waiting
to jump. Furthermore, cushions
were piled three feet high on the
floor, making it only a five-foot
jump, not eight-foot.
Bill Offutt, acting assistant
Row director, stated, "As they
(the victims) got drunker, they
were doing more and more ac
robatic things." Unfortunately,
Offutt was relying on hearsay and
neglected to get the facts. That
statement implies that Mike
McCarthy and I were drinking
and jumping and getting more
acrobatic with each jump. The

fact is that I jumped only once,
and my foot happened to come
down in a bare spot between the
cushions. The accident was un
lucky, and neither the KAs nor
anyone else was to blame.
It would be appreciated by
many if in the future, the Daily
would get their information
firsthand and not second or
third.

Rabbi supported
In the Daily article of Apr. 11
reporting the meeting of the
Hillel Board of Directors, it was
erroneously reported that the
board condemned Rabbi Mark
Cartun and two Hillel members
as "acting arrogantly and im
morally."
The resolution pased by the
board was limited to making it
clear that the Hillel board does
not support or consent to ac
tivities in support of those spon
soring "Palestinian Awareness

Week." We wish to affirm our
individual support for Cartun's
leadership of Hillel.

Rhetorical review
Seth Zuckerman's article on
"The War at Home" had a sin
cere and important message to
convey, but the rhetoric and
overall presentation of the arti
cle disturbed me greatly. It
seems one of the lessons we have
not remembered from the good
old days of consciousness raising
and the Jefferson Airplane is
oneness, not in terms of hot tubs
and spiritual nirvana, but in
terms of each small human being
having the fundamental bond of
species and history with all of
humanity.
Zuckerman's voicing was bel
ligerent, bordering on militant.

implying the old hip/square,
turned on/uptight dualism that
surfaced in the urgencies of the
'60s. That kind of "Us vs. Them"
dualism makes for great B west
erns and, unfortunately, for ef
fective campaign speeches; but
our situation is not urgent, is not
Us Against Them. We are Them,
we are the system, the human
race, the slow unfolding history
of mankind that did not begin
with Vietnam but before Homer.
If we really have something to
say, to accomplish, we have to
communicate it, take Them with
Us, find ways to include the cops,
the communists, the East, the
West in whatever plans we have
for the future, because They will
be there too. I am not preaching

cooperation for its own sake,
which is usually false and hollow,
hut rather the effort to inspire,
motivate and consider all ele
ments of society. This effort is
true adaptation, true progress,
and it works.
Getting through to people,
however, is even harder than
fighting them, especially when
we are all so bound hy various
forms of parochial bitterness, but
it is the only way anything will
get done (and it's a lot more fun
than war). So as far as I'm con
cerned, there is no war at home,
or anywhere else.
