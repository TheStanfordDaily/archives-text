## Taking on The Knack Death or glory, rock or roll? 
### 
When The Knack broke into
the music scene and the AM Top
10 with the release of their
debut album last summer, they
resurrected the old "death or
glory" controversy between the
oft-dichotomized " values of
popular appeal in rock and roll.
Get The Knack turned the
music industry on its ear in 1979
by rising quickly to the top of the
charts on the power of a
million-dollar ad campaign and a
girl named Sharona. For rock
fans, the success of "My
Sharona" signaled the impend
ing downfall of the pillars of
disco and represented the foun
dation of a new "era" of music.
But the shit started to fly soon
after the Los Angeles group
reached the platinum pinnacles;
when the self-proclaimed "dis
criminating tastes" of rock and
roll culture launched a vicious at
tack on The Knack, charging
promotional hype and citing
published critics' claims of un
originality and even mimicry and
sexism." Knuke The Knack" had
become the watchwords for a
growing mass of real rock con
noisseurs and cool radio stations.
The FM crowd, irked by AM
overplay and the AM editing of
"My Sharona"'s most redeem
ing quality, the guitar solo,
turned away from The Knack
almost overnight and cham
pioned instead the rawer, more
rebellious sound of The Clash
and Joe Jackson.
The Knack, meanwhile, re
mained the heroes of AM radio
and the largest category of the
AM audience: teen-agers.
Next
With the release of their sec
ond album earlier this year. The
Knack succeeded in further
polarizing the two camps. The
album's title. But the Little Girls
Understand, acknowledged the
music's appeal to the youngest
segment of rock music's listen
ers. At the same time, certain
disturbing similarities between

the album's first single, "Baby
Talks Dirty," and the successful
"My Sharona" provided ample
fodder for critics' cannons.
In the midst of this battle came
The Knack to Maples Pavilion
Friday night, the very event itself
bringing into question ASSU
Special Events' motives for at
tracting a group which is more
likely to appeal to the average
Palo Alto High School student
than to the average Stanford stu
dent.
As expected, the crowd Friday
night was predominantly com
posed of younger students, many
of whom — for lack of a driver's
license — came in busloads or
with parents.
The beginning of the evening's
entertainment did little to win
my favor. The opening band,
The Rubber City Rebels, were
little short of terrible. As a friend
aptly described these boys from
Akron, Ohio (home of Fires
tone), these guys were strictly
"Saturday morning Sex Pistols."
Indeed, these losers would be
great in The Archies Meet
Johnny Rotten.
The lead singer retained an
almost permanent sneer while
singing about being "Born
Dead" and other pseudo-punk/
rebel topics. Occasionally, the
singer made ridiculous gestures
with his pelvis and his middle
finger. I guess it takes a real
tough guy to sing a song called
"Child-Eaters," which on the
surface is slightly amusing, but is
devoid of substance and disturb
ingly vile underneath its uncon
vincing punk facade.
Even if The Rubber City Re
bels were just trying to mock
punk's vulgarity, they showed lit
tle appreciation for its in
strumentation and little under
standing of its meaning. Taken
seriously, the group stood out
more as comics than as rebels.
When these dreck-peddlers
received a supporting ovation
from the masses in Maples, I
began to understand how it

might be possible to deceive that
crowd with a million-dollar ad
campaign.
Million-dollar ad campaign
notwithstanding, however, The
Knack bathed in the love and de
votion poured upon them by
their fans Friday. And, perhaps
surprisingly, it was well de
served. The Knack delivered a
mostly powerful, polished set of
music which answered some cri
tics charges and yet raised some
puzzling questions.
Yes, The Knack sometimes
are unoriginal; a song or a
rhythm or a chord progression
occasionally will seem strangely
reminiscent of The Beatles,
Buddy Holly, The Rolling
Stones or even The Clash. But
their crimes are not great, and
even more highly respected
bands such as .The Who have
been known to "exhibit certain
influences."
Besides, for everything The
Knack did which could be called
unoriginal, there were an equal
number of creative flourishes to
the show which vindicated at
least lead singer Doug Fieger
and lead guitarist Berton Av
erre.
As a song-writing team, the
two may have stagnated slightly
with their newer material, but
the songs performed Friday from
the group's first album were in
spired and highlighted the show.
"She's So Selfish," "Frus
trated." "Heartbeat" and "My
Sharona" stand out as particu
larly satisfying because of Aver
re's excellent guitar work.
Last
And The Knack know how to
rock and roll, too. Having your
roots among such greats as
Buddy Holly, The Rolling
Stones and Ray Davies (of The
Kinks) has to count for some
credibility. The Knack played
two encores Friday, both old
rock and roll classics: "(Having 1
a) Rave Up" and "Not Fade
Away." Both were played with
the requisite abandon that we're

come to expect of good rock en
cores.
The question of sexist lyrics
may be debated for some time,
but I think criticizing The Knack
just because their lyrics are sexist
is like criticizing punk just be
cause the lyrics sometimes are
violent. It may be an accurate
description, but it doesn't change
the fact that a significant and im
portant segment of the popula
tion can and does have a strong
identification with the messages
contained in each musical vari
ety, whether sexual frustration
or rebellion is the issue. And that
quality — the ability to put to
music the thoughts and emotions
of a lot of people — has been an
essential attribute of some of the
greatest figures in rock, from
The Who of" My Generation" to
Bob Dylan to Bruce Springsteen.

There is a more puzzling side
to The Knack, however. If these
guys want to come off as re
spected rock and rollers, why the
expensive promotion? Why the
subtle stage resemblance to The
Beatles? Why release a single
that sounds so similar to your
original Big Hit? Why rely (in
unoriginal yet proven concepts
when the creativity exists to
explore new musical directions?
Why the seemingly deliberate
catering to popular appeal when
the talent exists to make such
concessions unnecessary?
By rejecting the critical
acclaim which is within their po
tential to earn without sacrificing
popular appeal. The Knack
threatens to stray from the road
to rock's hall of fame, Groups
such as The Cars, The Clash and
Joe Jackson have successfully

bridged the gap between the FM
and the AM airwaves and will
probably be reverently remem
bered for it.
Whether The Knack will avoid
fizzling like Boston and whether
they will reconcile the dichotomy
that plagues them will be the
biggest challenge the group will

face.
Whatever it is that the little
girls understand is still a little
questionable to a lot of people in
this country, and, rightly or not,
the group's continued success
could very well rest upon how
well those questions are resol
ved.
