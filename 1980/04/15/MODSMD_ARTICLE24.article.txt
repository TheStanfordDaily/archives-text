# Seeger, Odetta together
## 
### 
As Odetta took the stage in a sold-out Memorial Auditorium, clad
in a rose-colored robe, striped turban, a stick of incense smoldering
on her guitar, she told the audience, "An evening with Pete Seeger
and Odetta is a gift from the heavens." By the end of the evening, the
enraptured audience of bearded Anti-McCarthyites from the '50s,
two-child families, coeds in Guatemalan huipils concurred.
Odetta's set included a haunting rendition of Buffy St. Marie's
romantic "Until It's Time for You to Go," a charming hum of
Winnie the Pooh, "words by A. A. Milne, music by 0.0. Detter," and
an a capella prison chant, "Another Man Done Gone." Her intense
stylization ranged from high pitched keening to full-throated power.
And the lady has an off-beat sense of humor. She introduced a song,
"Sound of the Sea," by saying, "The Atlantic Ocean is not romantic.
The Pacific has some romance. But the Mediterranean is the Mama
of Romance."
As Seeger said when he entered. "She mesmerized me, too." But
the master accompanied by his 12-string banjo, soon added his own
unique notes, beginnig with a rousing version of "John Henry," then
encouraging the audience to fill the hall with sounds of "Amazing

Grace" and "That Old Time Religion." In "Where Have All the
Flowers Gone," he changed the poignant chorus to "When will uc
ever learn" underscoring that Seeger represents as a performer and
as a man courage, moral conviction, love of humanity.
He sang "The International" in French, then Odetta joined him.
They sang "Shenandoah," their voices meshing like the sounds of the
river itself, the birds, the grass, the wind, the audience hanging on
breathlessly, listening.
They shared a piquant version of "There's a Hole in the Bucket,
Maria." broke loose on "Wimoweh" and ended with "We Shall Not
Be Moved."
But we were moved, all of us. by the sight of these two giants ol folk
music, standing, hand in hand. It was an evening of participation and
affirmation. As Odetta said. "The folk song tradition goes on in spite
of everything that has happened . . . no. because of everything that
has happened."
