### 
A Song for a Nisei Fisherman by Philip
Kan Gotanda is a play about fishing and the
life of Ichan Matsumoto, a Japanese Ameri
can born in Hawaii.
Ichan (David Pating) narrates his story
from boyhood to his old age as he sits on the
bank of a California river. Fishing is his only
passion next to hard work. He leads a simple
life and has no time for philosophy.
Ichan is a self-made man who came from a
poor family. His fatherTochan (LorenFong)
inculcated in his son a desire for a better life,
but the motivation that pushed Ichan
through Arkansas medical school came from
within.
Ichan wanted a better life for his children
than the hard life of his mother (Stacv
Azama). who had her hands full with Ichan's
melancholy father, whose schemes for get
ting rich became more and more elaborate
with each additional cup of sake.
David Pating does a brilliant job with a
play that is full of what is most difficult in
theater: the passing ot time and the aging of
characters. The play is done with the
minimum of costumes and an almost bare
stage so he cannot get anv help there: he has
to rely on his own resources entirely to make
the audience see the whole of Ichan's life
unfold before them. A good deal of the play
relies on the audience's imagination, with
Pating miming.
VVhenyousee Pating cast his invisible fish
ing rod and see him struggle with the fish, or

w hen he recalls the life and death of his favo
rite dog. you have a feeling that you are
actually there when it happened.
Ichan is in his old age fearful of death,
although he never was scared of life. He
barged through it never questioning his val
ues. never wondering what it was all about.
He kept up the old traditions, kept his wife
at an emotional distance in her role as
mother and was very angry with his son when
he brought home a Chinese girl. He is unable
to comprehend his son. who is searching for
himself and who wants to become a writer;
that is beyond his life's experience.
When Ichan is forced to give up his prac
tice during the war and is confined to a
government-run camp, he feels no bitter
ness. He works hard and does not expect
anything from life. Even the life at the camp
had its good side, and that is what he remem
bers.
It is not clear at the end of the play just
where Ichan went wrong, whether the
American dream turned sour for him. leav
ing him all alone on the bank of a river; but
then it is difficult to find fault with a man who
had devoted himself entirely to his children.
It is a pity that Gotanda. who is the artist
in-residence for the theater project and
Okada House, did not concentrate on a few
incidents in Ichan's life rather than trying to
fit in his whole life. It seems as if we are
barely touching the surface of some of the
issues that the play brings up. such as the

treatment of Japanese Americans during
World War II or the traditional Japanese vs.
the American view of family life and family
mortality. There is a good deal of detailed
information on fishing and eating sushi, al
though fascinating, which could be shor
tened.
The play essentially is Ichan'sshow. There
are quite a few difficult transitions into
flashbacks which could have been helped
with a minor costume change or two.
The play is accompanied by music and
song which complement Ichan's narration,
but these do not seem to add much to the
play, although they are sung beautifully by
Angela Goldman.
But for all those who managed to squeeze
into the Nitery to see the world premiere ol
this young and talented playwright's work, it
was a very rewarding experience.
The play was directed by David Hwang
who brought out the best in Pating and the
rest of the cast. Hwang, a former Stanford
student, is a playwright himself. Hwang's
play FOB will open in May at Joseph Papp's
Public Theatre in New York City.
A Song for a Nisei Fisherman was pro
duced by the Asian American Theatre Pro
ject at Stanford, which was started in 1978 by
Hwang and Nancy Takahashi. The project
has sought to provide Stanford with exposure
to Asian American culture and has evidently
succeeded.
