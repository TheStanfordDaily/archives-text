# CAT comedy
## Fun, but overdone 'Rehearsal' 
### 
Jean Anouilh writes with wit
and grace and, at times, he writes
too much. True to form, The Re
hearsal (now at CAT) is witty
and graceful in parts, overblown
and overlaid in others.
Anouilh apparently tried to
create a comedy of manners with
several twists. He began with the
standard play-within-a-play, the
interior drama reflecting
humorously and ironically upon
the exterior one. He dressed up
this device by placing his modern
characters in 18th-century garb
and locale: we learn that Count
Tigre's haughty circle is rehears
ing a Marivaux costume piece for
performance at the count's de
cadently old-fashioned chateau.
Of course, the intrigues of
Marivaux are played out among
its actors. The count (Dakin
Matthews) both "in real life"
and in the society play falls for
the "wrong" woman, a servant (a
strong performance by Anne
Swift), to the chagrin of his wife
(Kandis Chappell), mistress
(Katherine Butterfield) and
booze-ridden buddy (Karl Hes
sler).
Too much, too little
Comedies of manners usually
require clean, clear lines of plot
and dialogue which entangle the
characters and one another; they
are laced with free, fast dialogue
and a teacup-pinky disdain of

life.
But in The Rehearsal, for
every deliciously witty exchange,
every beautifully drawn scene,
Anouilh has included overwrit
ten passages, tendrils of plot and
character which run off into no
thing, uncomfortably maudlin or
profound ideas which he over
laid on a skinny frame.
The California Actors Theatre
production fights hard to over
come these problems. The strug

gle shows through the veneer.
Julian Lopez-Morillas' direc
tion occasionally allows scenes to
drag; too often we wonder when
this all is going to end. Double
entendre flies about brightly as
Matthews' friends try to pull him
back into the fold, while banish
ing the naive but heartstrong
Swift. Too many flubbled lines,
though. And the play's one-shot
joke (play-within-a-play) — al
beit a good one — soon is over

worn.
Matthews little-boy pout
coupled with a smugly all
knowing tongue (he has the best
lines by far) is countered beauti
fully by Chappell's jaded coun
tess and Butter field's mistress
Hortensia (Stress the first sylla
ble, please).
The Rehearsal runs through
April 27 at the California Actors
Theatre, Old Town Theater in
Los Gatos.)
