# The 						Ramones
## Those all-American punks 
### 
The Ramones
Saturday, April 12
Warfield Theatre, San Francisco
My date got a bloody nose at
the Ramones concert. Bill
Graham had taken out the first
five rows of seats at the Warfield
and advertised "dance-style sea
ting," but when a third of the
crowd jammed itself into l/20th
of the theater, there was no room
for dancing. It was between sets
and the crowd was fairly innocu
ous, considering the close quar
ters, except for a couple of
over-Rippled 15-year-old goons
who had taken to heart the
Ramones' paeans to mental re
tardation. falling into people and
bellowing their enthusiasm for
the show to begin with thick
blasts of 80-proof breath. Then
the goons started pushing and
everyone pushed back and the
Ramones came on and everyone
started jumping and this one
prepubescent punkette pogoed
the top of her skull into my date's
nose. I wiped it up with my shirt.
It was wonderful.
There's something special
about the crowd at a Ramones
concert because the Ramones
appeal to a broad spectrum of
the rock 'n' roll world: from New
Wave intellectuals who see
the Ramones as renegade mini
mal artists struggling against a
stilted popular music establish
ment, sort of melodic Noble
Savages, to the kids with
tubes of TeStors in their pockets
who take the Ramones at their
glue-huffing word. Maybe
piquant social commentary.
Maybe an anthem. But primarily
the Ramones make great music,
music you can dance to, music

you can stifle a bloody nose to.
It's pared down, basic rock 'n'
roll — Chuck Berry taken to his
logical sonic extreme. And it's
funny. It's the best teenage zit
music since "ABC" ("Easy as
one, two three," remember?):
how can you lose with a set that
includes "Gimme Shock Treat
ment," "Teenage Lobotomy,"
and"I Wanna Be Sedated"?
The Ramones are punks, but
not the trash-chic kind of English
punk with the safety pin through
his crotch: these boys are good
old all-American punks with
leather jackets, jeans out at the
knees, stringy bowl haircuts and
Fred Flintstone overbites.
They're scrawny and unwell
looking, living only on pizza if we
are to believe their "smash hit"
movie Rock 'n' Roll High
School, and looking like kids you
could find in any suburban shop
ping mall.
Lead singer Joey Ramone,
who has a great adolescent whine
reminiscent of Roger Daltrey's
in "My Generation," slouched
into his mike, a unique one foot
forward, one back slouch that
truly is his own, and pretty much
stayed that way, occasionally
pointing at the audience but
mostly hiding behind his shaggy
hair and rose-tinted glasses.
Johnny Ramone and Dee Dee
Ramone. guitarist and bassist re
spectively, executed a few half
hearted leaps — more out of a
sense of duty than anything else.
Only drummer Mikey Ramone
displayed any emotion, occa
sionally smiling to betray the fact
that he enjoyed whacking on his
drum kit. If they look like shop-

ping mall kids, they act the same
way. The only theatrics came
near the end of the set when a
pinhead brought out a giant
"Gabba, Gabba. Hey" poster for
Joey to brandish at the audience.
Other than that, the Ramones
played it straight: you could take
half the ticket price, buy a
Ramones album, turn it up loud,
stare and the cover and get much
the same effect. Yet that's not
to say that the Ramones didn't
give their audience their money's
worth. Twenty-plus songs in a lit
tle over 60 minutes followed by
three enores of two songs apiece
is a lot healthier of a portion than
you can usually find at a New
Wave concert — just ask anyone
who saw Elvis Costello last year
at Berkeley. And despite their
stage mannerisms, the Ramones
play with an intensity that few
bands can match: the audience
could not have taken much more
than it got. The Ramones may
not be a great concert band in the
tradition of, say. The Who, but
neither do they "stink up the
place."
The opening act was a local
band called No Sisters, a brother
act of four Buddy Costello
look-alikes who churned out
passable early '60s new frontier
rock. Despite their lack of origi
nality, they put on a good show,
including one bit where the lead
singer flung Dippity-do at the
audience.
But it was the Ramones who
brought us together. It was a
Woodstock of the '80s. It was
wonderful.

knees, stringy bowl haircuts and
Fred Flintstone overbites.
They're scrawny and unwell
looking, living only on pizza if we
are to believe their "smash hit"
movie Rock 'n' Roll High
School, and looking like kids you
could find in any suburban shop
ping mall.
Lead singer Joey Ramone,
who has a great adolescent whine
reminiscent of Roger Daltrey's
in "My Generation," slouched
into his mike, a unique one foot
forward, one back slouch that
truly is his own, and pretty much
stayed that way, occasionally
pointing at the audience but
mostly hiding behind his shaggy
hair and rose-tinted glasses.
Johnny Ramone and Dee Dee
Ramone. guitarist and bassist re
spectively, executed a few half
hearted leaps — more out of a
sense of duty than anything else.
Only drummer Mikey Ramone
displayed any emotion, occa
sionally smiling to betray the fact
that he enjoyed whacking on his
drum kit. If they look like shop-

ping mall kids, they act the same
way. The only theatrics came
near the end of the set when a
pinhead brought out a giant
"Gabba, Gabba. Hey" poster for
Joey to brandish at the audience.
Other than that, the Ramones
played it straight: you could take
half the ticket price, buy a
Ramones album, turn it up loud,
stare and the cover and get much
the same effect. Yet that's not
to say that the Ramones didn't
give their audience their money's
worth. Twenty-plus songs in a lit
tle over 60 minutes followed by
three enores of two songs apiece
is a lot healthier of a portion than
you can usually find at a New
Wave concert — just ask anyone
who saw Elvis Costello last year
at Berkeley. And despite their
stage mannerisms, the Ramones
play with an intensity that few
bands can match: the audience
could not have taken much more
than it got. The Ramones may
not be a great concert band in the
tradition of, say. The Who, but
neither do they "stink up the
place."
The opening act was a local
band called No Sisters, a brother
act of four Buddy Costello
look-alikes who churned out
passable early '60s new frontier
rock. Despite their lack of origi
nality, they put on a good show,
including one bit where the lead
singer flung Dippity-do at the
audience.
But it was the Ramones who
brought us together. It was a
Woodstock of the '80s. It was
wonderful.

Saturday, April 12
Warfield Theatre, San Francisco
My date got a bloody nose at
the Ramones concert. Bill
Graham had taken out the first
five rows of seats at the Warfield
and advertised "dance-style sea
ting," but when a third of the
crowd jammed itself into l/20th
of the theater, there was no room
for dancing. It was between sets
and the crowd was fairly innocu
ous, considering the close quar
ters, except for a couple of
over-Rippled 15-year-old goons
who had taken to heart the
Ramones' paeans to mental re
tardation. falling into people and
bellowing their enthusiasm for
the show to begin with thick
blasts of 80-proof breath. Then
the goons started pushing and
everyone pushed back and the
Ramones came on and everyone
started jumping and this one
prepubescent punkette pogoed
the top of her skull into my date's
nose. I wiped it up with my shirt.
It was wonderful.
There's something special
about the crowd at a Ramones
concert because the Ramones
appeal to a broad spectrum of
the rock 'n' roll world: from New
Wave intellectuals who see
the Ramones as renegade mini
mal artists struggling against a
stilted popular music establish
ment, sort of melodic Noble
Savages, to the kids with
tubes of TeStors in their pockets
who take the Ramones at their
glue-huffing word. Maybe
piquant social commentary.
Maybe an anthem. But primarily
the Ramones make great music,
music you can dance to, music

you can stifle a bloody nose to.
It's pared down, basic rock 'n'
roll — Chuck Berry taken to his
logical sonic extreme. And it's
funny. It's the best teenage zit
music since "ABC" ("Easy as
one, two three," remember?):
how can you lose with a set that
includes "Gimme Shock Treat
ment," "Teenage Lobotomy,"
and"I Wanna Be Sedated"?
The Ramones are punks, but
not the trash-chic kind of English
punk with the safety pin through
his crotch: these boys are good
old all-American punks with
leather jackets, jeans out at the
knees, stringy bowl haircuts and
Fred Flintstone overbites.
