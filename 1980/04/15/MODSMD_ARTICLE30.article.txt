U.S. oks entry of 3500 Cubans
WASHINGTON — The United States will
admit up to 3500 of the Cubans who have taken
refuge at the Peruvian Embassy in Havana and
are seeking political asylum in other countries.
President Jimmy Carter announced yesterday.
In a statement issued by press secretary Jody
Powell, the president also called on other nations
"to make their own contributions without delay"
to the effort to relocate the fleeing Cubans.
"The humanitarian crisis requires an im
mediate international response," he said.
The U.S. commitment to take up to 3500 re
fugees amounts to about one-third of the esti
mated 10,000 Cubans who took refuge at the
Peruvian Embassy last week after the Cuban
government removed security guards from the
compound. The Cuban government has told all of
those who made their way to the embassy that
they could leave Cuba as soon as Peru found a
place for them to go.
Costa Rica has agreed to serve as a temporary
staging area for tty* Cubans after they leave
Havana, and to accept 300 of them as permanent
residents. Peru has agreed to accept 1000 of the
Cubans, and Spain has said it will take 500.
Iran deadline puzzles Europe
LONDON — Western European govern
ments, which are under pressure from
Washington to join the U.S. sanctions against
expressed puzzlement yesterday about Pres
ident Jimmy Carter's "deadline" for them to act.
Official sources in most European capitals said
they had received no specific date.
Only British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, Carter's most enthusiastic supporter of
tough action on Iran, offered quick formal words
of support. But even she said no date had been
received.
In a television interview with European cor
respondents, broadcast Sunday. Carter said he
had given friendly governments a "specific date"
by which Washington expected her allies to join
in economic sanctions. The United States im

posed sanctions and severed diplomatic relations
with Iran last week after failure of negotiations to
free the American hostages who have been held
in Tehran since militants took over the U.S. Em
bassy there Nov. 4.
West European leaders planned to consult with
their recalled envoys from Tehran in anticipation
of next Monday's meeting in Luxembourg of
European Economic Community foreign minis
ters. Iran will be discussed then.
Thatcher told the House of Commons yester
day that the Western allies were conferring ur
gently and should make a decision on joint action
at the meeting yesterday.
"Our job is to show our support to the Ameri
can people and to President Carter." she said.
Clashes persist in S. Lebanon
TEL AVIV. Israel — Israel says its troops have
withdrawn from southeast Lebanon, but U.N.
forces there were put on full alert because of
clashes with the Lebanese Christian militiamen
Israel supports.
An Israeli military spokesman said the troops
which crossed into Lebanon last Wednesday
"have completed their tasks and have left the
area of south Lebanon."
The troops crossed the border two days after
Palestinian attack on a kibbutz in the northern
panhandle in which three Israelis and the five
terrorists were killed. A U.N. spokesman said the
Israeli troops blocked some of the Palestinian
infiltration routes into Israel and searched for
terrorists. But there was no report that they found
any or destroyed any Palestinian installations.
Israeli sources said the troops were blocking
Palestinian attacks that might disrupt President
Jimmy Carter's meetings in Washington with
President Anwar Sadat of Egypt and Prime
Minister Menachem Begin of Israel.
Meanwhile, hostilities continued between the
U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in southern
Lebanon and the Lebanese Christian militiamen
there led by Maj. Saad Haddad.
The U.N. command accused the militiamen of
firing on a U.N. convoy Friday, attacking its
troops in the village of Tiri, five miles north of the
Israeli border, on Saturday.
Germans favor Games boycott
West Germany gave President Jimmy Carter's
drive for an international boycott of the Moscow
Summer Olympics its strongest endorsement to
date yesterday, announcing that the government
did not favor sending a team to the Games.
Klaus Boelling, chief spokesman for the West
German government, said it would recommend
that the country's National Olympic Committee
vote to boycott the Games as long as Soviet
troops remain in Afghanistan.
The number of countries definitely committed
to not sending teams to Moscow rose to 19. In a
speech in Pennsylvania, Vice President Walter
Mondale said the Carter administration believes
that it has 50 boycott commitments.
Meanwhile, the International Olympic Com
mittee was reportedly ready, at the lOC execu
tive board meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland,
next week, to consider banishing all national flags
and anthems from the Moscow Games.
NBC-TV will not broadcast the Suijimer
Olympics from Moscow, network souths said
yesterday. But the official announcement will be
delayed until company lawyers are certain NBC
can recover some 557 million on an insurance
policy.

Campaign finance law upheld
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court yes
terday upheld the federal law providing for public
financing of the presidential election campaigns
of major-party candidates, dismissing complaints
hy the Republican Party that the law unfairly
favors incumbents and labor-backed candidates
and infringes on freedom of speech.
The unanimous ruling virtually guaranteed
that the current system, under which both the
Democratic and Republican nominees will be
given $29.4 million in federal funds to run their
campaigns, will remain in effect through the 1980
election.
The law provides federal money tor the
nominees of other political parties only if they
received at least 5 percent of the vote cast in the
previous presidential election or receive it in the
November balloting. If they receive it in the com
ing November election they will be reimbursed.
No minor-party candidate qualified in 1976,
the first year the current system was in operation.
The law makes no provision for public funding of
independent candidates.
In a landmark decision called Buckley vs.
Valeo, the justices rejected claims by indepen
dent candidate Eugene McCarthy, former Con
servative Sen. James Buckley and others that the
new system unfairly favored the major parties
and their candidates. The court then also upheld
the new $1000 limit on the amount that individu
als can contribute to presidential candidates.
Southern spring deluge kills 9
Bloated rivers poured over their banks across
the South yesterday, routing thousands of people
and snakes, while up to a half-foot ot snow
smothered spring flowers trom Arkansas through
the Midwest.
At least nine people had been killed in storms
which brought a weekend deluge to Dixie, record
April cold to parts of the Southwest, and the
heaviest snowfalls ever so late in the year in Mis
souri.
The snowstorm halted traffic on some in
terstate highways in the Midwest, closed schools
and knocked out power in scattered areas.
Floods claimed new territory in Mississippi,
Louisiana and Alabama, where rivers on a relent
less rise breached levees and spilled over sandbag
dikes.
Mississippi Gov. William Winter toured
flooded areas by helicopter yesterday and said he
was "cautiously optimistic" that there would not
be a repeat of the 1979 flood. "It looks like we're
going to avert the kind of disaster we had last
year," he said.
Many residents were unconvinced. "That's
what they told us last time." said an employee of a
Jackson nightclub.
Appeals over for Gov. Mandel
BALTIMORE — Former Maryland Gov.
Martin Mandel said yesterday he was relieved
that the U.S. Supreme Court ended his appeal of
his corruption conviction, although he now will
likely go to prison within 30 days.
"What they can do to me now cannot be as bad
as what they have done to me." Mandel said. "1
guess you get to the point when you're glad some
thing's been resolved."
The Supreme Court refused without comment
yesterday to hear further appeals of the 1977
federal convictions of Mandel and five political
associates. Mandel, 59. faces a four-year prison
term, although his attorney. Arnold Weiner, said

he would try to have it, reduced.
"I've never done anything to hurt the people of
the state of Maryland and I'll continue to feel that
way the rest of my life," Mandel said in his An
napolis office minutes after hearing of the high
court decision.
"Somehow, someday, the whole thing will
come out. There's a story to be told," he said.
Mandel succeeded former Vice President Spiro
Agnew as governor and served from 1969 until
his conviction. He was found guilty of accepting
favors to influence his action on the now-defunct
Marlboro racetrack, which was secretly owned by
his five co-defendants. It was alleged the scheme
brought Mandel some $350,000 worth of gifts,
vacations and interests in business deals.

The freeway's northbound lanes near this
western Stanislaus County town were closed for

danger," said Army Sgt. Ted Elisee of the Pres
idio in San Francisco. He said they were 2000-
pound Mark 84 general aircraft bombs en route

Army Depot in Indiana.
The CHP gave this description of the 4 a.m.

rig hauling bombs. One person in the truck which
was carrying paper was seriously hurt when he

engulfed by fire and died after running a short
distance.
