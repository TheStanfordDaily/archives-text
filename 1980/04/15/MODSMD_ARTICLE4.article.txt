A colorfully costumed African-inspired dance troupe
kicked off Africa Week in a White Plaza noon rally
yesterday which featured three student speakers and
attracted a crowd of more than 200.
The week's festivities, based on the theme "Alterna
tive Development Strategies for the 1980s in Africa,"
are designed to promote black unity.
Awetu Simesso, an African student here, opened the
rally with a plea for African independence from foreign
domination.
Africa "no longer lays faith with the superpowers,"
Simesso said. "U.S. out of Africa, U.S.S.R. out of Af
rica," Simesso called.
Africa must cast oft the bonds of whites, he said. "The
African shall be free," he added. "Africa must unite . . .
to conquer centuries of exploitation."
African student Nguyuru Limpumba said, "white
people had believed their state would be forever in con
trol in South Africa." But recent political change, such as
the new government in Zimbabwe, "has given morale to
the people of South Africa," he added.
Afro-American student Frederick Buhl, a member of
the Black Student Union here, said all blacks share a

common heritage and must struggle for freedom from
oppression.
According to Buhl, "Afro-Americans here in the U.S.
have a special problem." American schools have not
taught black children about their culture, he said.
Black children should be studying black leaders, not
George Washington or Thomas Jefferson, he said.
Buhl called attention to several problems he believes
obstruct the "black struggle for self-determination."
Buhl said,"the Afro-American is told that his struggle
here is over." So "why are we told things are getting
better when they are in fact getting worse?" he asked.
Buhl criticized what he called the U.S. inflation
fighting method of "taking from those who have no
thing." This especially affects minorities — "the number
of Afro-Americans earning $24,000 a year is declining,"
for example, he said.
But Siesso expressed some optimism. He said, "the
African today is understanding oppression. The Afri
can. like all the freedom-loving men of this world, speaks
a new language.'
Future Africa Week events include speaker Bill
Sutherland today, a symposium on "Alternative De
velopment Strategies for the 1980s in Africa" and Africa
Night on Saturday.
