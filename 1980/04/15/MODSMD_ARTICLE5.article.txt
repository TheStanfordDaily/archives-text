# Lyman sees seeds of trouble in inter-race relations

"Fully developed and open relationships bet
ween minority and majority students appear to be
fairly rare, and that, if true, contains the seeds of
trouble and of significant missed opportunities
for both groups," President Richard Lyman told
a meeting of college administrators yesterday.
Speaking before the annual conference of the
National Association of Student Personnel Ad
ministrators, Lyman said that even in this permis
sive era, students have trouble developing that
intimacy that makes profound sympathy and un
derstanding between people of different races
and sexes possible.
But Lyman stressed the importance of the uni
versity in building such relationships, which he
called key in this "extraordinary social experi
ment that is the United States."
Lyman said he sees the minority student facing

a series of conflicting desires, that of wanting to
partake of the university's opportunities as any
majority student would, while at the same time
maintaining his or her cultural identity. The diffi
culty, he explained, is that different groups have
trouble appreciating each other's points of view
and understanding each other's assumptions
about the world and their place in it.
He cautioned v that he was not advocating
return to the melting pot myth. "I'm not suggest
ing that the problem lies in the resistance of
minorities to absorbtion in the culture of institu
tions that are at least in part alien to them, al
though such resistance does exist and does exact
its price," he added.
On the other hand, Lyman noted, many major
ity students, faculty, staff, and administrators
show and obliviousness to minority interests,
tastes, and values, or even a tendency to write off
minority beliefs as inferior merely because they
are different.

Lyman likened the racial problem to that of
relations between the sexes. Men and women
often have difficulty in understanding each
other's points of view, he said, and even the rela
tively progressive atmoshphere of the coed dorm
"falls very short of solving all the problems in
volved here."
The goal of building a "working multi-racial
democracy" in this country is the most pressing
objective, save avoiding thermonuclear war, fac
ing American universities today. Lyman said.
While the colleges and universities are only a part
of the society that must strive for this goal, he
added, the nation is not likely to attain it without
the "active and successful involvement of higher
education."
Stressing the importance of what students
teach each other, Lyman said, "if we ask ourse
lves what the minority students and the majority
students are learning from each other 1 doubt,if
our answers can be entirely reassuring.

He called on the administrators and the rest of
the university community to strive to prorsote
deeper communication between students of dif
fernent races and sexes.
"Every dean, or faculty member, or fellow
student, who can move a conversation past the
barriers of stereotyping and defensiveness, has
contributed a mite to the effort we must make,"
he said. "Every program that manages to di
minish the risk of re-segregation of our society,
without threatening the legitimate desires for cul
tural identity and individual, personal autonomy,
on the part of minority students, contributes to
â€¢the efforts."
A university, Lyman said, ought to be a some
what uncomfortable place, because thinking for
oneself is often uncomfortable, but every institu
tion should strive to become in a world full of
stress and conflict a place of mutual understand
ing.
