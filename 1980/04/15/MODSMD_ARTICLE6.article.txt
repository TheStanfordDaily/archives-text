# Israeli prime minister heads for Washington
## Begin wants to accelerate negotiations

From the Daily wire services
JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin said yester
day he would like to accelerate the fal
tering negotiations on autonomy for
1.2 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip in an effort to
meet the May 26 target date for agree
ment on the election of a self
governing council in the Israeli
occupied territories.
Heading for Washington and a series
of talks with President Carter, Begin
told reporters at an airport news con
ference that while he is for a speed-up
in the negotiations, the locale of the
meetings remains an unresolved mat
ter.
Responding to reports that Carter
and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat
have agreed in principle to moving the
Egyptian and Israeli negotiating teams
to Washington for marathon sessions
until May 26, Begin said he had been
empowered by Israel's cabinet to
"clarify with President Carter the ques
tion of where those talks should take
place." Severtil cabinet members, in
cluding Interior Minister Yosef Burg,
head of the Israeli autonomy negotiat
ing committee, have expressed reserva
tions about holding marathon sessions
in Washington instead of alternating
them between Egypt and Israel.
Among other reasons Burg has cited is
the problem of keeping ministers away
from their posts for several weeks at a

time. Accompanying the prime minis
ter are Burg and Foreign Minister Yit
zhak Shamir.
Beneath Sadat's sharp rhetoric,-
though, were indications a deal could
be struck —* possibly by the May 26
target date or at least by summer —
providing some administrative powers
to the 1.2 million Palestinians living
under Israeli control.
The compromise would be based
partly on deferring some tough issues,
such as control over water facilities on
the West Bank of the Jordan River,
until the Palestinians themselves are
willing to join the Egyptian-Israeli
negotiations.
Sadat revived the idea of implement
ing automony first in the Gaza district,
once controlled by Egypt and much less
a security concern for Israel than the
West Bank of the Jordan River.
At the same time, the Egyptians are
pushing for a special committee to sift
security aspects out of other issues and
deal with them separately. The idea is
to reassure Israel that as it reaches
terms on those other issues its security
concerns also are being addressed.
Begin is also known to be concerned
that intensive, marathon autonomy
talks would likely subject Israel to in
creased U.S. pressure to make new
concessions, as happened at the Camp
David talks near their conclusion in
1978. Asked whether he was con
cerned about reports that the U.S. posi

tion on autonomy has drawn closer to
that of Egypt than to Israel's, Begin
replied, "There is always room for con
cern. (But) we have received a report
from the president of the United States
that no conclusions have yet been
reached, and that he is awaiting our
arrival."
Cabinet Secretary Aryeh Naor gave
impetus to those reports when he said
some ministers have heard about prop
osals to which Carter and Sadat had
agreed in their Washington talks last
week. But Naor said that "the Camp
David agreement must be im
plemented in the letter and the spirit
alike. We take the letter of the Camp
David agreement very seriously."
There has been growing concern
among some officials here that Carter
and the Egyptian president may have
coordinated their positions on several
key autonomy issues, and that Begin
will be confronted by a fait accompli.
Without any perceptible basis, there
were even published reports of a "sec
ret working paper" drafted by Sadat
and Carter containing joint demands to
which Israel will be asked to agree.
If nothing else, the pre-summit
speculative binge by Israeli journalists
and politicians alike created a mood
here that Israel's embattled prime
minister was going off on a mission as
formidable as that of David against
Goliath.
But backed by a supportive cabinet

resolution. Begin has made it clear he
has no intention of discussing topics not
explicitly included in the Camp David
accords, including a possible settle
ment freeze and voting eligibility for
the 100,000 Palestinian Arabs in
Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem.
About Sadat's proposal that an au
tonomy scheme be implemented first in
the Gaza Strip to serve as a model for
the more recalcitrant West Bank,
Begin insisted that this would not be
made a negotiable issue until an overall
agreement has been reached on the
substantive definition of autonomy —
which is far from being decided.
Begin also went to Washington
mindful of domestic political pressure
from the right wing of his ruling Likud
coalition that would appear to preclude
any sweeping concessions to Carter on
the major issues touching on Israel's
presence in the West Bank and Gaza.
His critics — most notably those in
the National Religious Party — have
shelved until his return their incipient
attempt to take the party out of the
coalition, which would automatically
bring down the government and
prompt elections. Some of his oppo
nents have suggested they may with
hold their assault on Begin's incum
bency until after the May 26 target
date, but a misstep by the prime minis
ter in Washington would most likely
lead to immediate calls for resignation.
