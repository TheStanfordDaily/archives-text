# Cambodians face famine

PHNOM PENH. Cambodia
— Cambodians, struggling daily
to survive after 15 months of war
and famine, now face a critical
shortage of rice seeds that
threatens to prolong their
hunger.
International aid officials say
it is a "toss-up" whether enough
rice seeds can reach Cambodia in
the next two months to avert
another disastrous harvest and a
huge deficit.
"Even allowing for all the
hazards, we are bringing enough
food so people won't die in the
streets and fields." said one in
ternational aid official.
"But it will be a very difficult
year — many people will be sick
and some will die."
Each ton of seed that is not
available now will result in the
loss of roughly 10 tons of rice at
harvest time, an amount that can
feed about 20,000 people for a
day.
Seed needed
Only if farmers can sow
90.000 tons of seeds before the
heavy rains begin in late June
and only if Cambodia receives
300.000 tons of food from inter
national agencies during the next
seven months, will there be
enough food to ward oft famine
until harvest.
Agriculture vice minister
Kong Som Ol says there are "a
thousand problems" and most of
the foreign agencies agree it is
almost impossible for all these
targets to be met.
Major port congestion, poor
road and rail networks, lack of
security and technically qualified
personnel "at practically every
level compound the problem of
managing efficiently the food
supplies," said Garson Vogel,
executive-director of the World
Food Program in Rome. WFP is
a U.N. agency coordinating the
Cambodian relief effort.
Food aid drops
Vogel said there has been a
drop in the amount of food from
donor countries. "We foresee
that within the next couple of
weeks, the supply line continuity
will be broken if additional re
sources were not made availa
ble," he said.
The delivery of seeds is behind
schedule. No seeds have arrived

by sea. A daily airlift to Phnom
Penh will bring only 2500 tons in
April. And it is doubtful that the
usual 40,000 tons of residual
seed from earlier harvests are
available in Cambodia. Some
provinces stored seed reserves;
others did not. Some farmers
have been forced to use part or
all of their seed reserves.
The seed and food situation
was further worsened by floods,
droughts and rat infestations
during the dry season harvest
earlier this year. Only an esti
mated 20,000 to 30,000 tons of
rice were harvested, and 14 out
of 18 provinces got virtually no
thing from their fields.
No buffer
What was to have been a buf
fer for one or two months instead
forced the United Nations to re
vise its food deficit estimate from
an initial 220,000 tons to bet
ween 270,000 and 300.000 tons
for 1980.
To cover the deficit would

mean bringing in 42.800 tons
each month, an impossible task
under present conditions.
The two major agencies in
Cambodia — the International
Red Cross and the U.N. Chil
dren's Fund — have been consis
tently optimistic and consistently
wrong in both their estimates of
Cambodia's needs and the ability
of the relief effort to meet them.
Two other key variables in
whether Cambodians eat or
starve are internal distribution
and the capabilities of the far
mers.
The distribution system, al
ready riddled with problems, will
be hampered by the rainy season
when many roads become im
passable. Farmers need fertiliz
ers, pesticides and tools — all in
short supply.
"1 don't think you will see
skeletons unless the distribution
system breaks down," said a
food expert. "All the same you
will have a lot of scavenging."
