# Afgan rebels lack focus, leader
## 
### Tyler Marshall The Los Angeles Times 
APARI, Afghanistan — The inflated
bravado that permeates the headquarters of
Afghan rebel organizations in the Pakistani
frontier town of Peshawar was markedly ab
sent in this dusty rebel-controlled village in
Kunar Province.
Instead, the atmosphere was matter-of
fact and fatalistic. That night or possibly the
next, the men of the village said they would
take rifles out to confront Afghan army
units operating in the area. If they were
lucky, they said, they might even run across
some Russians.
For these Moujahedeen — Moslem fight
ing men — the struggle to oust the Soviet
controlled government from their province
has engulfed their lives and those of their
friends and relatives in nearby villages. They
talked and thought of little else.
Similar scenes in virtually every one of the
country's provinces have combined to gener
ate the convulsive anti-government revolt
that the Soviets, whose div isions invaded Af
ghanistan in December, now confront.
While only a month of spring fighting has
passed in eastern Afghanistan, and some
snow-covered mountain regions are only
now thawing, the Russians are learning how
difficult it will be to put down an insurgency
movement that has the broad support of the
local population.

In Kunar Province, the insurgency springs
completely from the local population. Unlike
guerrilla wars in many other Third World
countries, there is no single leader heading
the anti-government campaign, no rebel
army as such, no top-to-bottom chain of
command.
Village units are banding together, elect
ing their commanders to fight almost exclu
sively in their own areas. The soldiers of the
revolt arc the sons of the area where the
fighting takes place. The uprising in Af
ghanistan is thus one of the purest grass
roots popular revolts any where. Hate for the
Russians and the Marxist government in
Kabul they support has seeped to the very
marrow of life.
Although deeply imbedded in Afghan life,
the insurgency remains today as it was born:
splintered and uncoordinated.
Little outside support
It is this fractious, homespun nature of the
revolt, with no focal point and little form,
that has prevented any immediate material
support from potential outside suppliers.
But even with their armory of museum
pieces and captured Soviet-made small arms
and equipment, the rebels have shown them
selves tough and unyielding.
The rugged terrain and poor communica
tions that have historically made control of
rural areas so difficult for governments in

Kabul are proving equally hard for the
Soviets to overcome.
Escapees fight on
The Russians have demonstrated their
ability to bomb villages out of existence and
inflict heavy casualties among civilians, but
those who escape take to the hills to fight on.
The Soviets also must fight alongside a
less-than-enthusiastic local partner, the be
leaguered remains of the Afghan army.
Struggling with a demoralized army that has
lost its will to fight is an unenviable, morale
sapping task Americans themselves faced in
Vietnam.
Although incapable of meeting the Soviets
head-on, with only modest support, rebels
have shown an ability to make life hell for the
Russians in other ways. Any significant infu
sion of military aid would give a quantum
jump to rebel effectiveness.
Most rebel groups, stressing their Islamic
fundamentalist ideology, have now estab
lished fund-raising links in the oil-rich Mid
dle East gulf states. To help promote their
image, some have produced Super-8 color
films with Arabic narratives describing their
jihad, or holy war.
But donations so far appear to be from
individuals only, not governments. Some
times money comes in a lump sum from the
very rich, other times in small amounts sol
icited in mosques.
