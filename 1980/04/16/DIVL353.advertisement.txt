JOHN COLLIIMS, seminarian
"My name is John Collins. I'm a
seminarian. I had the idea of being a
priest for a long time before I did
anything about it. I was too scared of
my feelings.
"But I finally took the plunge and
it's the best thing I ever did. It wasn't
a shot in the dark. Friends helped.
Talking to seminarians helped. And
prayer was the biggest help"
Perhaps you, like John, have
thought about the priesthood or
religious life but never really looked
into it.
How about looking into it now?
