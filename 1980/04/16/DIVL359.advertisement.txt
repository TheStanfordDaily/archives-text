right here in the Bay Area?

ARLO is the Action Research Liaison Office. We make it possible
for you to do research for community groups on current social
issues. Doing an ARLO project is very much like doing an indepen
dent research project. You work with a faculty sponsor and you get
academic credit, but with an ARLO project you also work with and for
an outside community group. ARLO serves as a link to the outside.
Interested? Many of our spring projects are listed in the Fieldwork
Clearinghouse Catalog, and we have additional projects listed in the
ARLO Office. Come in and take a look! We'd love to put you to work!
