for threshold projects
in tomorrow's technology
Those who prefer a creative type of work rather than
routine assignments, should investigate these openings.
All are in areas of technology at — or beycnd — the cur
rently accepted limits of the state-of-the-art. All offer the
right individual opportunities for significant achievement,
intellectual growth and professional recognition.
United Technologies Corporation ranks among the top
six in this country in private funding for research and
development activities. This very substantial financial
backing — $545 million in 1979 — has resulted in a re
search environment with the sophisticated equipment
and complementary services so essential for creative
work in advanced areas of high technology.
OPPORTUNITIES in FLORIDA
CONTROLS
■ Microprocessor Engineer (BS/MS EE) to design and
develop digital circuit systems with emphasis on
microprocessor structures.
■ Laser-Optics Engineer (BS/MS EE. PhD with thesis
work considered) to conceive, propose, design and
analyze a wide variety of control systems for laser
optics/diagnostic applications.
■ Electro-Optics Engineer to design, and develop ad
vanced electronic, electro-optical and electro
mechanical control systems. Primary emphasis will
be on hardware design of advanced optical and
electro-optical control systems. BSEE/MSEE or BS/
MS in Physics or Electro-optics acceptable.
; ELECTRO-OPTICS
■ Instrumentation Engineer (BS/MS EE or Physics) to
conceive, design and develop advanced electro
y optical instrumentation; develop software and assist
in hardware development of computer and data
acquisition/analysis systems; support laser-optics/
controls development activities.
■ Circuits Designer (BS/MS EE) to design, develop and
'■h analyze electronic circuits for laser and electro
optical systems, general instrumentation and data
,k, acquisition applications using both digital and analog
■ Components Engineer (BS/MS EE) to plan, estimate,
propose, negotiate, direct technical execution and
provide program management for delivery mirror
programs; plan and provide technical direction for
corporate-sponsored technology programs in cooled
mirror area; and supervise subordinate engineers.
COMPOSITE MATERIALS
■ Research Engineer to plan and direct the develop
ment of advanced composite materials and optical
components utilizing composite materials. MS Degree
or better in ME, Materials Engineering or Materials
Science preferred. This individual will also be ex
pected to define candidate composite systems, direct
experimental laboratory efforts in material and fabri
cation techniques and procedures and also conduct
IR&D and contract programs.
J OPPORTUNITIES in CONNECTICUT
ELECTRONICS RESEARCH
■ Electronic Engineer (MSEE) to develop advanced rf
signal processing wave, acoustic wave and GaAs
microwave integrated circuit technology. Requires
€ "hands-on" experience in active microwave compo
nent design, circuit modeling techniques, and elec
trical characterization procedures in VHF to lower
microwave range. Particularly valuable for further
professional growth, would be additional experience
in microwave acoustics, hybrid circuit development,
and GaAs/silicon integrated fabrication techniques.
QUANTUM PHYSICS
■ Circuit Designer (MS/BS EE) with experience in
J electronic circuit design, microprocessors, elec
zfv tronic sensors, fiber/integrated optics, lasers, seml
conductor light sources and detectors, digital
electronics, data processing and optics. Activity will
involve design, testing and development of electro
optic sensors and data transmission systems.
