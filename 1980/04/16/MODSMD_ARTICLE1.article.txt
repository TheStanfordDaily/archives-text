# Voting begins with low turnout
## 
### 
Only K pcrcent of the student body voted in today's
election, a fact which election commissioner Doug Mitchell
said he found "kind of disturbing."
Twenty percent of the student body must vote to make
the fee assessment decisions valid.
Mitchell and other members of the election commission
went door-to-door last night rallying students to vote. They
also planned to burn the midnight oil last night painting
posters and banners urging students to vote in today's elec
tion.
"Hopefully we'll be able to pull people from all around
campus," Mitchell said.
The vote count was only a rough estimate based on the
number of signatures on the sign-up sheets at the voting
tables. No ballots were tabulated last night.
"From this we know turnout was only about eight per
cent." Mitchell said. "That's only an approximation, but it

was definitely less than a 10 percent turnout."
This was not including the signatures of persons voting at
the late-night table in front of Meyer library. That voting
spot remained open last night from 7 tt> 11 p.m.
In this election, students are deciding 15 fee assessment
issues, the council of presidents slate .""or next year and
senior class officers.
Other issues on the ballot are the senate election reform
amendment and a mascot resolution.
Those organizations requesting one, two, three or four
quarter fee assessments include the Academic Organiza
tions Board, the Stanford Band, the Cliapurrul, Club
Sports, Glee Club. Graduate Student Association. K.ZSU,
Legal Counseling Office and Program Fee.
Others are the Publications Board, Speakers Bureau.
Stanford Committee on Political Education, Theatre Guild.
Volunteers in Asia and The Stanford Daily.

turnout of 8 percent, less than the 20 percent needed
for certification. Voting concludes today.
