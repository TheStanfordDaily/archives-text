# Armenians leave Soviet Union in record numbers
## 
### Dan Fisher The Los Angeles Times 
MOSCOW — Arshalous Matevosian followed
his older brother from Iran to Soviet Armenia in
1970. because "Armenia is my nation."
Sometime this month, Matev osian will follow his
brother again — this time to Glendale, Calif.,
where 64-year-old Tevan Matevosian has lived for
most of the last four years since he emigrated.
Matevosian, his wife and three daughters will
thus become part of a second Soviet emigration
movement — smaller and not nearly so well known
as the one involving Soviet Jews but one that is
growing nevertheless, and is having a significant
impact in California.
Armenian emigration to the United States set a
record last year when nearly 3600 people left —
triple the 1 978 figure. So far this year the rate is up
again about 50 percent and. considering the even
larger numbers of Armenians notifying the U.S
Embassy here that they have recently received
Soviet permission to migrate, off icials are predict
ing that as many as 6000 will leave in 1980.
Well over 90 percent of the Armenian emigrants
are settling in California — virtually all of them in
the L.os Angeles area. "It's gotten to be a standard
joke around here that when it comes to filling in the
zip code space for their intended destination, we
don't even have to ask," one embassy consular

officer commented.
Like the Matevosians, most of the Armenians
now leav ing the Soviet Union are not natives. They
came here, mostly from the Middle East, after
World War 11. An estimated 250,000 Armenians
returned to their ancient homeland during those
immediate postwar years.
Now thousands of those immigrants or their
offspring are packing up again. According to sur
veys by the American Embassy here. 90 percent of
the Armenians in the current emigration wave are
from the families of those postwar immigrants.
Even the thousands now leaving are only the tip
of the iceberg, it is believed. There are no official
figures on the numbers of Armenians applying to
emigrate, but estimates range from 50,000 to
150.000.
However, embassy officers who have inter
viewed hundreds say the Armenian emigration
wave is "not a political phenomenon." There are
few, if any, real anti-Soviet dissidents among them.
Many grumble about the general hardships of*
Soviet life, but so do many Soviets.
"These are people who have seen a different
kind of life, who can't cope with this one, and who
want out," one source commented, noting the large
numbers of non-natives among the emigres. "Their
motives for leaving seem more economic than any
thing else." another official added.
