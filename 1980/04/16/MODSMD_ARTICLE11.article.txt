# Sutherland commends Zimbabwe
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
In a luncheon speech yester
day to about 100 people. Bill
Sutherland, the American
Friends Service Committee
Southern Africa representative,
commended the people of
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia on over
coming oppression and electing
an independent government.
"The people, according to the
statistics, were functionally illit
erate and yet they had an aware
ness observers had not experi
enced in other parts of the
world," said the speaker, who
acted as an observer in the
negotiations for the indepen
dence of both Zimbabwe-
Rhodesia and Namibia (South
West Africa).
The country will formally
change its name Friday from
Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, a name
culled from the impressive ruins
that are all that remain of an an
cient black civilization.
The country will have a new
flag, of multicolored stripes with
a white triangle and a five
pointed red star, on which is
superimposed a gold Zimbabwe
bird.
And most importantly, the na
tion will be independent after
more than a century as a British
colony.

But Sutherland said Zim
babwe is not yet at a turning
point. Rather, the country is in a
period of "breathing space."
There is a lot of work to be
done before Zimbabwe reaches
that critical turning point. The
nations and individuals who have
been responsible for causing so
many of the problems can help
Zimbabwe get back on her feet
and struggle for the final libera
tion. Sutherland said.
"The Western powers that
have been instrumental in keep
ing whites in power — Britain,
France, Germany and even the
United States — see perhaps
they ought to have a different
kind of policy that would be in
strumental in the long run.
"Alhough there was the experi
ence of intimidation and attemp
ted bribery, that the people
could not be bought, that they
could not be intimidated and
they knew who their leaders
were, was evident." Sutherland
said.
In addition to the •statesman
like position" of the Rhodesians,
Sutherland said "there was a
good deal of cooperation and a
great deal of sacrifice by the Af
rican countries surrounding
(Zimbabwe-Rhodesia)."
He said despite the fact the
British had been given "credit"

for the newly-elected indepen
dence, which was voted in March
3, the Queen's government
"played three roles at once —
rigging the campaign, creating a
fallback position and designing
the impeccable mechanics of the
election."
Changes
The most specific change
proposed by the new govern
ment will put blacks in charge of
running the country's cities and
towns. By October, black ghet
tos will be merged with the white
towns they surround and there
will be, for the first time, all-race
municipal elections.
Since blacks outnumber
whites in almost every munici
pality, blacks will dominate the
cities by the end of the year, ac
cording to Dr. Eddison Zvobgo,
minister of local government and
housing in the Mugabe cabinet.
Under Mugabe rule, there ap
parently will be a substantial
change in the way the news is
reported. A new government
news agency is to be established,
replacing what Mugabe has cal
led "the colonial one."
Losing clout
Hut according to a Los
Angeles limes report, Mugabe is
already losing clout.
On the day of his election.
Mugabe said, "our main concern
should be to join hands in build
ing our country so that we can
build a new Zimbabwe with a
new national faith, a new na
tional love."
And one of his early orders of
business at independence time
was to go before the leading
white farmers of his country,
many of whom had once killed
black freedom fighters. Yet
Sutherland said many of the one
million black Rhodesians dis
placed by whites will not go back
home.
"Rhodesian settlers are
cheap.'' Sutherland said. "They
try to grab it all and will not go
back home. I"hey will relocate.
The new government will have to
move on land and wages."
Sutherland said the world's
economic order is rigged against
Zimbabwe and there is strong
economic, pressure against the
country by the outside world.

Already Mugabe has ap
pointed two white Rhodesians to
Cabinet posts. Already he has
appealed for funds, not from the
Soviet Union but from the Un
ited States, Britain and Scan
dinavian countries. He even took
the extraordinary step of asking
Britain to delay granting inde
pendence for a few weeks be
cause he felt that his party was
not yet ready to run the govern
ment.
Mugabe applauded
Sutherland applauded
Mugabe's behavior, saying, "He
gave everyone a role, even the
whites who had oppressed the
blacks, on the condition they are
willing to be treated as individu
als among equals."
Mugabe is a pragmatist. There
is no doubt he will carry the scars
of white rule, such as his nine
years in detention, for a long
time.
But he is also a man of great
patience and intellect. He knows
that he needs both white techni
cians and capital to save his land
from chaos. He knows what
white flight in the past did to
countries like Zaire and
Mozambique.
Mugabe's allegiances are
much closer to Peking than to
Moscow. That might prove in
valuable for the West in the criti
cal months ahead as Mugabe at
tempts to hold on to the 215,000
white Zimbabweans crucial for
keeping the nation's economy
healthy, while convincing 6.5
million black Zimbabweans that
their hard work is just beginning.
"In spite of the fact the incum
bent party seemed to have unli
mited resources — helicopters,
cars, food and clothing — the
people, who ate the food and
wore the clothing, voted for the
party they should have," Suther
land said.
"For me the experience of
being in Zimbabwe at the time of
the elections was very impor
tant." he said. "It was the best
example of people power and a
beautiful example of the inter
dependence of the people, the
government and the country's al
lies, not to mention the restraint
by the powers of the world so
that mistakes were not commit

Rhodesia and Namibia (South
West Africa).
The country will formally
change its name Friday from
Rhodesia to Zimbabwe, a name
culled from the impressive ruins
that are all that remain of an an
cient black civilization.
The country will have a new
flag, of multicolored stripes with
a white triangle and a five
pointed red star, on which is
superimposed a gold Zimbabwe
bird.
And most importantly, the na
tion will be independent after
more than a century as a British
colony.

But Sutherland said Zim
babwe is not yet at a turning
point. Rather, the country is in a
period of "breathing space."
There is a lot of work to be
done before Zimbabwe reaches
that critical turning point. The
nations and individuals who have
been responsible for causing so
many of the problems can help
Zimbabwe get back on her feet
and struggle for the final libera
tion. Sutherland said.
"The Western powers that
have been instrumental in keep
ing whites in power — Britain,
France, Germany and even the
United States — see perhaps
they ought to have a different
kind of policy that would be in
strumental in the long run.
"Alhough there was the experi
ence of intimidation and attemp
ted bribery, that the people
could not be bought, that they
could not be intimidated and
they knew who their leaders
were, was evident." Sutherland
said.
In addition to the •statesman
like position" of the Rhodesians,
Sutherland said "there was a
good deal of cooperation and a
great deal of sacrifice by the Af
rican countries surrounding
(Zimbabwe-Rhodesia)."
He said despite the fact the
British had been given "credit"

for the newly-elected indepen
dence, which was voted in March
3, the Queen's government
"played three roles at once —
rigging the campaign, creating a
fallback position and designing
the impeccable mechanics of the
election."
Changes
The most specific change
proposed by the new govern
ment will put blacks in charge of
running the country's cities and
towns. By October, black ghet
tos will be merged with the white
towns they surround and there
will be, for the first time, all-race
municipal elections.
Since blacks outnumber
whites in almost every munici
pality, blacks will dominate the
cities by the end of the year, ac
cording to Dr. Eddison Zvobgo,
minister of local government and
housing in the Mugabe cabinet.
Under Mugabe rule, there ap
parently will be a substantial
change in the way the news is
reported. A new government
news agency is to be established,
replacing what Mugabe has cal
led "the colonial one."
Losing clout
Hut according to a Los
Angeles limes report, Mugabe is
already losing clout.
On the day of his election.
Mugabe said, "our main concern
should be to join hands in build
ing our country so that we can
build a new Zimbabwe with a
new national faith, a new na
tional love."
And one of his early orders of
business at independence time
was to go before the leading
white farmers of his country,
many of whom had once killed
black freedom fighters. Yet
Sutherland said many of the one
million black Rhodesians dis
placed by whites will not go back
home.
"Rhodesian settlers are
cheap.'' Sutherland said. "They
try to grab it all and will not go
back home. I"hey will relocate.
The new government will have to
move on land and wages."
Sutherland said the world's
economic order is rigged against
Zimbabwe and there is strong
economic, pressure against the
country by the outside world.

Already Mugabe has ap
pointed two white Rhodesians to
Cabinet posts. Already he has
appealed for funds, not from the
Soviet Union but from the Un
ited States, Britain and Scan
dinavian countries. He even took
the extraordinary step of asking
Britain to delay granting inde
pendence for a few weeks be
cause he felt that his party was
not yet ready to run the govern
ment.
Mugabe applauded
Sutherland applauded
Mugabe's behavior, saying, "He
gave everyone a role, even the
whites who had oppressed the
blacks, on the condition they are
willing to be treated as individu
als among equals."
Mugabe is a pragmatist. There
is no doubt he will carry the scars
of white rule, such as his nine
years in detention, for a long
time.
But he is also a man of great
patience and intellect. He knows
that he needs both white techni
cians and capital to save his land
from chaos. He knows what
white flight in the past did to
countries like Zaire and
Mozambique.
Mugabe's allegiances are
much closer to Peking than to
Moscow. That might prove in
valuable for the West in the criti
cal months ahead as Mugabe at
tempts to hold on to the 215,000
white Zimbabweans crucial for
keeping the nation's economy
healthy, while convincing 6.5
million black Zimbabweans that
their hard work is just beginning.
"In spite of the fact the incum
bent party seemed to have unli
mited resources — helicopters,
cars, food and clothing — the
people, who ate the food and
wore the clothing, voted for the
party they should have," Suther
land said.
"For me the experience of
being in Zimbabwe at the time of
the elections was very impor
tant." he said. "It was the best
example of people power and a
beautiful example of the inter
dependence of the people, the
government and the country's al
lies, not to mention the restraint
by the powers of the world so
that mistakes were not commit
ted."
In a luncheon speech yester
day to about 100 people. Bill
Sutherland, the American
Friends Service Committee
Southern Africa representative,
commended the people of
Zimbabwe-Rhodesia on over
coming oppression and electing
an independent government.
"The people, according to the
statistics, were functionally illit
erate and yet they had an aware
ness observers had not experi
enced in other parts of the
world," said the speaker, who
acted as an observer in the
negotiations for the indepen
