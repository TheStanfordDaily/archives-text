# Chinese relaxing on Taiwan Straits

XIAMEN. China — All is
quiet these days on the Fujian
front, where the Chinese
Communists and their
Nationalist Chinese adver
saries not long ago exchanged
around-the-clock artillery
bombardments. But stark
reminders of their unfinished
50-year-old civil war still re
main.
Major Nationalist Chinese
island strongholds, Quemoy
and Matsu, familiar names
from the past and the central
points of contention in the
1960 American presidential
debates, sit just off the coast
of Fujian (Fukien) Province
— and never far from the
thoughts of the Fujianese.
Bristling with underground
Bunkers, antiaircraft installa
tions and an extimated
60,000 crack Nationalist
troops, Quemoy lies only two
miles from this sun-drenched
little city. It is Taiwan's front
line, an improbable bastion of
anti-communism flanked on
three sides by the enemy.
The shooting stopped here
on New Year's Day 1979,
when the Communists halted
their decades-old shelling of
Quemoy and called on
Taiwan "to return to the em

brace of the motherland."
The Nationalist regime of
President Chiang Ching-kuo
spurned the offer of
government-to-government
negotiations but has stilled its
guns, too.
Even before the last fusil
lade, the civil war had
amounted to little more than
a propaganda contest, for the
two sides had substituted
leaflet-filled shells for live
ammunition.
Because of the unofficial
cease-fire now in force, the
gun emplacements along
Xiamen's sandy beaches have
been sealed and Chinese col
lege students sunbathe atop
the now-unused pillboxes.
The only cannons visible
here, relics from the Ming
Dynasty, decorate the front
lawn of Xieman University.
Western intelligence
sources report that half of the
300,000 Communist troops
once positioned here have
been shifted from the Fujian
front to the Soviet and Viet
namese frontiers. In an odd
historical twist, the Com
munist powers in Moscow
and Hanoi are now perceived
as far more threatening than
the capitalists across the
Taiwan Strait.
