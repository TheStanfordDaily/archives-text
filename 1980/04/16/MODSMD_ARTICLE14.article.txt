# NASA looks to the future
## 
### Rose Chan Staff Writer 
Though NASA is in the midst
of a string of fruitful projects, ac
cording to Dr. Arden Albee of
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, new projects must be
planned to maintain this string in
the future.
Speaking in Skilling Au
ditorium last week, Albee said,
"the missions we have been look
ing at were those planned 10 or
15 years ago. Although every
thing seems very fruitful now, we
are not looking after our herit
age. We are not preparing what
will be needed 10 years from
now. We have two years of no
new starts."
In his talk, titled "What will
NASA bring you next?", Albee
first presented photographs
gathered by Voyagers 1 and 11,
spacecraft that passed by Mais in
1977 and Jupiter last summer.
The spacecraft will pass Saturn
this summer and Uranus some
time in 1 986.
Albee also discussed some of
the plans and the problems
NASA has for the future.
He presented artists' and sci
entists' conceptions of possible
planetary exploration devices.
One idea proposed that big balls
be placed on Mars to be blown
around freely by the wind, pick
ing up samples on its path with a
lance-like extension.
"Some of these NASA artists
have really vivid imaginations,"
Albee commented.
Another proposal suggested
using surveillance airplanes
which have been used on earth.
"They can fly on Mars without
any change," Albee said. "It's a
feasible idea and it's something
that we have looked at. You have
to look at many techniques to see
how you can increase your know
ledge in a relatively inexpensive
way."
An antenna perfected in the
Vietnam War to detect footsteps
is another device which could be
transplanted to other planets as a
way of understanding seismic
networks, or even to detect life,
Albee said.
Finally, he presented the idea
of a "solar sail." in which the
pressure of particles from the sun
would propel a sail of Mylar plas
tic or some such material,
through space.
According to Albee. the main
obstacles to NASA's missions
are the high cost of increasingly
complex plans and the insuffi
ciency of financial support. Mis
sions under construction are

strictly limited by budget.
For example, the Inter Solar
Polar Mission which NASA was
actively preparing to start on this
year has been delayed for at least
three years. This mission would
send two spacecrafts, one
American and one European,
out to J-upiter and over the poles
of the sun on its way back.
Albee also said that although
it could be done "technically,"
NASA cannot afford to go to
Pluto and Uranus until after the
year 2000.
Other missions he spoke of
were the Solar Probe and the
Venus Orbiter Imaging Radar
(VOIR). The Solar Probe would
go out to Jupiter and come in as
close as possible to the sun. The
VOIR mission would back up
studies done by Pioneer Venus,
trying to peer through the ocean
of clouds surrounding the planet
to see what is underneath.
The Cometary Exploration
mission, which has not been in
cluded in this year's budget,
would probe Haley's comet and
continue around and rendezvous
with Temple 2, another comet, in

1988. Instead of this plan, two
other comet-intercept options
are being reviewed — a more
costly U.S. plan which would
produce good results and a much
cheaper European option bring
ing inferior data.
NASA developers of the
comet-intercept missions have
been told to strive for images
that will be "good enough to be
on the cover of Time magazine,"
Albee quipped.
"Viking (the Mars probes)still
lives," said Albee. He reported
that the Viking lander is being
used in an educational movie and
one of the orbiters is being re
vived. The other orbiter has been
programmed with a sequence of
directions that will occupy it until
1990. Albee said the Viking
spacecraft will take pictures of
the Martian landscape and at the
same time look at particles from
the sun.
Thus "the U.S. will have a
metereologist station in Mars,"
said Albee. "It would be great if
we could get it to salute the next
time we get a mission to Mars."

Albee also discussed some of
the plans and the problems
NASA has for the future.
He presented artists' and sci
entists' conceptions of possible
planetary exploration devices.
One idea proposed that big balls
be placed on Mars to be blown
around freely by the wind, pick
ing up samples on its path with a
lance-like extension.
"Some of these NASA artists
have really vivid imaginations,"
Albee commented.
Another proposal suggested
using surveillance airplanes
which have been used on earth.
"They can fly on Mars without
any change," Albee said. "It's a
feasible idea and it's something
that we have looked at. You have
to look at many techniques to see
how you can increase your know
ledge in a relatively inexpensive
way."
An antenna perfected in the
Vietnam War to detect footsteps
is another device which could be
transplanted to other planets as a
way of understanding seismic
networks, or even to detect life,
Albee said.
Finally, he presented the idea
of a "solar sail." in which the
pressure of particles from the sun
would propel a sail of Mylar plas
tic or some such material,
through space.
According to Albee. the main
obstacles to NASA's missions
are the high cost of increasingly
complex plans and the insuffi
ciency of financial support. Mis
sions under construction are

strictly limited by budget.
For example, the Inter Solar
Polar Mission which NASA was
actively preparing to start on this
year has been delayed for at least
three years. This mission would
send two spacecrafts, one
American and one European,
out to J-upiter and over the poles
of the sun on its way back.
Albee also said that although
it could be done "technically,"
NASA cannot afford to go to
Pluto and Uranus until after the
year 2000.
Other missions he spoke of
were the Solar Probe and the
Venus Orbiter Imaging Radar
(VOIR). The Solar Probe would
go out to Jupiter and come in as
close as possible to the sun. The
VOIR mission would back up
studies done by Pioneer Venus,
trying to peer through the ocean
of clouds surrounding the planet
to see what is underneath.
The Cometary Exploration
mission, which has not been in
cluded in this year's budget,
would probe Haley's comet and
continue around and rendezvous
with Temple 2, another comet, in

1988. Instead of this plan, two
other comet-intercept options
are being reviewed — a more
costly U.S. plan which would
produce good results and a much
cheaper European option bring
ing inferior data.
NASA developers of the
comet-intercept missions have
been told to strive for images
that will be "good enough to be
on the cover of Time magazine,"
Albee quipped.
"Viking (the Mars probes)still
lives," said Albee. He reported
that the Viking lander is being
used in an educational movie and
one of the orbiters is being re
vived. The other orbiter has been
programmed with a sequence of
directions that will occupy it until
1990. Albee said the Viking
spacecraft will take pictures of
the Martian landscape and at the
same time look at particles from
the sun.
Thus "the U.S. will have a
metereologist station in Mars,"
said Albee. "It would be great if
we could get it to salute the next
time we get a mission to Mars."
Though NASA is in the midst
of a string of fruitful projects, ac
cording to Dr. Arden Albee of
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, new projects must be
planned to maintain this string in
the future.
Speaking in Skilling Au
ditorium last week, Albee said,
"the missions we have been look
ing at were those planned 10 or
15 years ago. Although every
thing seems very fruitful now, we
are not looking after our herit
age. We are not preparing what
will be needed 10 years from
now. We have two years of no
new starts."
In his talk, titled "What will
NASA bring you next?", Albee
first presented photographs
gathered by Voyagers 1 and 11,
spacecraft that passed by Mais in
1977 and Jupiter last summer.
The spacecraft will pass Saturn
this summer and Uranus some
time in 1 986.
