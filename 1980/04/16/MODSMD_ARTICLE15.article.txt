# Students give high marks to profs
## 
### Steven Crandell Staff Writer 
Stanford students are "fairly
satisfied" with Stanford teach
ing, according to Prof. Robert
Calfee, director of CERAS.
In a report to a convocation of
Ivy League deans earlier this
year, Calfee used student evalua
tions (also used by the ASSU
Course Guide) to support his ar
gument.
He cited class size as an impor
tant variable — students rated
smaller classes higher. And he
found students "more satisfied"
with courses at an upper-division
level.
John Backus. Project Man
ager for the Course Guide,
comments that though there is
definitely rating inflation on the
student evaluations, students in
general are pleased with teach
ing.
The evaluations ask students
to rate instructors on a scale of
zero to seven, seven being the
best rating and zero the poorest.
The abstract average should then
be 3.5. But Backus says,"the av
erage rating is in the five-plus
range." The results of the
Course Guide tend to agree with
other sources of student feeling
toward the facultv at Stanford.

The Senior Survey, taken hy
the Office of the Dean of Under
graduate Studies to ascertain
how seniors evaluate their un
dergraduate experience, has
been very favorable to Stan
ford's teachers over the last few
years.
In 1979, 45 percent of the
Senior Class returned the sur
veys and, to quote the report,
"99 percent of the respondents
rated the faculty on average, as
scholars and researchers, good
through excellent. . . the seniors
evaluated the faculty signific
antly lower as teachers (80 per
cent good through excellent), as
major advisors (57 percent), and
as general advisors (33 per
cent)."
The reactions of students,
both with classes fresh in their
mind and in retrospect, are very
positive toward Stanford teach
ing and scholarship.
But there is one more impor
tant student perspective to be
considered — that of the trans
fer. The transfer doesn't have to
rely on an abstract, absolute
evaluation system: he or she can
compare.
Lydia Copivsky, a sophomore
transfer from Northwestern,
finds the biggest difference in the

Stanford faculty's reputation. As
a "big research" university,
"Stanford has more famous
names on its faculty; but it is
their reputation rather than their
teaching ability that separates
them from Northwestern
teachers, she said.
She did note, however, that
the SCIRE and SWOPSI prog
rams encouraging self
developed or non-academic
education were a particular ad
vantage at Stanford.
Coming from UCLA, a much
larger university (about 25,000
undergraduates), Keith Robin
son is impressed by the consis
tency of good teaching and the
abundance of small classes at
Stanford. "In upper-division
classes, there were still 150 or so
people at UCLA." he said.
Robinson, a senior, enjoys the
more personal interaction he has
with his professors at Stanford.
He said he found much more of
"an awareness" and a seeking
after "originality of thought"
from both students and profes
sors here.
On a seven-point scale, he
rates Stanford teaching two
points above the teaching at his
former school.
Leslie Shatum also considers

good teaching to be strongly cor
related with close interaction be
tween professor and student. Yet
for her, this "active learning pro
cess" came when she was a
freshman at Columbia, not at
Stanford.
A common question in one of
her sections at Columbia (almost
always led by professors, not by
TAsjwas: "What do you think of
this and why?" The goal was for
the individual to discover what
he or she thought.
There was no right or wrong,
said Shatum. "There was a lot of
give and take and challenge."
She characterized the Stan
ford education as "passive, more
like a job."
Robinson and Shatum hit
upon what is most important to
the Stanford student in their
classroom experience. It is the
professor and the kind ot per
sonal interaction that goes on be
tween the students and him or
herself that either makes or
breaks a class.
John Backus, the Course
Guide Manager, says the best
part of the course as tilled out by
students is almost always the
professor. Regardless of rating
inflation, students prefer small
classes, he said.
