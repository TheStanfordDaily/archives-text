# Nevada challenges century old California Tahoe border
## 
### Janet Staihar The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — A
century-old squabble over
where the boundary line
should be drawn between
California and Nevada
reached the U.S. Supreme
Court Monday as lawyers for
the disputing states argued
claims for the prime strip of
land.
James Thompson, special
deputy attorney general for
Nevada, complained that sur
veyors unlawfully moved the
real boundary line in 1872
and gave neighboring
California too much land.
"Every time they'd ever
survey it, they'd go out and
move the boundary,"
Thompson said of the historic
efforts of California and the
federal government in deter
mining the dividing line from
Lake Tahoe to the Oregon

border.
But Jan Stevens, assistant
attorney general of Califor
nia, argued that Nevada has
acquiesced to the current
boundary for 108 years and
it's too late to change it now.
At stake are about 350
square miles of California
land claimed by Nevada —
including much of South Lake
Tahoe, Calif. One of Califor
nia's counter-arguments
could lead to some North
Tahoe casinos ending up in
California, where gambling is
illegal.
California's attorney said
the state would rather leave
the border where it is. "Our
principal prayer is for the pre
sent line" rather than either
altering it or getting a new
survey, said Stevens.
The line has been used for
laws, contracts and many
other official purposes since it

was drawn in 1872.
Hut Nevada claims the laws
of both states recognize an
earlier 1863 survey north of
the lake. It alleges in docu
ments submitted to the high
court that the old markers
were illegally moved, cheat
ing Nevada of some valuable
border land.
But California's attorney
said the reason for the later
survey done in 1872 was be
cause of doubts about the ac
curacy of the original mar
kers.
If Nevada's argument is ac
cepted by the court, the tug of
war will still go on.
California is prepared to
demand a sophisticated
modern-day resurvey — and
that state is confident a resur
vey would move three North
Tahoe casinos in Nevada into
California.
