## Palestinian Week defended 
### 
Palestinian Awareness Week has come under
strong attack by the organized Jewish community,
most recently at a meeting of the Hillel Board of
Directors as reported in the Daily on April 1 Ith.
At that meeting, both the week of events and the
organizers of the week came under attack.
As four of the coordinators of Palestinian
Awareness Week, we feel it is important to restate
the original intention in planning the week and to
present an analysis of the criticism that has fol
lowed.
In a press release to the community we stated the
following goal. "The purpose of the week (Palesti
nian Awareness Week) is to present non
stereotypical perspectives on the social, cultural,
economic and political activities of the Palestinians
. It is our firm belief that change is made by
causing people to see their opponents in any con
flict as reasonable human beings with whom it is
possible to come to a resolution of the conflict."
We planned a week of events that would fulfill this
goal.
There arc two types of criticism that we received
tor planning this week. The first involves a letter
sent out under Hillel letterhead inviting Jewish
community leaders to participate with us in the
week's planning. We have acknowledged that it
was not our intention to give the impression that
Hillel was a co-sponsor of Palestinian Awareness
Week, as the program is solely sponsored by
SWOPS I 143, and have expressed regret to those
who misunderstood the letter and its intent. It is
also important to restate the fact that Rabbi Mark
Cartun and Debbie Denenberg, two of the signers
of the letter, were in no way involved in the actual
organization of the week's events.
However, in addition to this procedural objec
tion that we have acknowledged and expressed
regret for. we have been attacked on the actual
content of the week and its intentions. Personal
attacks have also been made against us. We feel
that these latter charges are entirely illegitimate
and obscure the real issues we are trying to raise.
We totally reject the anti-democratic challenge
that we have no right to present a program on the
Palestinian people in an open forum.
Two of the more serious allegations follow:
/) A closer examination of the week shows it to be
grossly biased against Israel. The week is timed to
coincide with the United S'ations debate on amend
ing Resolution 242 . . .
21 focusing attention on the concerns oj the
Palestinian Arabs, while ignoring those of the Is

raelis, at a time Israel is under tremendous pressure
to give in to PLO demands, can only harm the peace
process. Helping to erode U.S. public support of
Israel is helping to increase the likelihood of Israel's
destruction.
(Both are from a statement circulated at the
Hillel meeting.)
The former charge shows a deep lack of under
standing of Palestinian Awareness Week. The
focus of the week is the Palestinians. This is not a
denial of Israel or Israelis â€” Israel is not the topic
of this week's events. We have devoted a day to
Israeli perceptions of the possibility of peace with
the Palestinian people. Since we do not view the
conflict in the Middle East as a zero-sum game
situation, supporting the rights of the Palestinian
people to self-determination does not negate the
equal rights of the Israeli Jews to self determina
tion.
Palestinian Awareness Week was scheduled in
mid-January, and the attempt to find a conspiracy
behind the planning of the week alongside the U.N.
debate is nonsensical. One could find fault with our
timing whenever the week was planned. Our origi
nal choice of dates did not take into account the
proximity of Passover, the Holocaust Remembr
ance Day, or the Day of Remembrance for the
Fallen Israeli Soldiers and was entirely coinciden
tal. While many may criticize the timing of the
week this close to these observances, in retrospect,
the timing can also be viewed as highly approp
riate. What better time is there to work for peace
and understanding that may lead to a resolution of
the conflict than during the week when we re
member the victims of the continuing conflict?
The second criticism is openly contested both in
Israel and the United States. As we've stated, we
do no feel that this is a win-lose situation. Addi
tionally, it is an unsubstantiated claim that focusing
on the concerns of Palestinian Arabs necessarily
helps to erode U.S. public support of Israel.
Clearly, the attack upon Palestinian Awareness
Week has gone far beyond the question of inap
propriate use of Hillel letterhead. We feel that
these latter criticisms are preconceived and incor
rect. We invite those who have leveled these criti
cisms to attend the events before leaping to conclu
sions.
