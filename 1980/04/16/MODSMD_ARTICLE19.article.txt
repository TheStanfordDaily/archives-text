# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Libertarians callous and ignorant 
### 
Maybe it's just my imagination, but it
seems like every time I turn around on this
campus 1 find Libertarians. And maybe it's
my imagination again, but I get the distinct
impression that these people are serious
about what they advocate. I guess I just find
it hard to believe that anyone could go about
blithely espousing a doctrine so totally call
ous and willfully ignorant.
Libertarianism seeks to afford "liberty"
(or freedom) to everyone by abolishing most,
if not all, of the functions of contemporary
government. I wonder, though, whether the
abolition of government wouldn't make only
some of us free. And I ask myself. "At what
price, liberty?"
Let me take some specific statements and
proposals from the Libertarian Party Posi
tion Paper No. 1 ahd see if the price of "lib
erty" isn't a bit exorbitant.
1) No taxes Libertarians oppose confiscat
ory taxes, which means, since they define all
taxes as confiscatory, that they would have
no taxes at all. It follows that without a
source of revenue, there would be no gov
ernment. A wide range of necessary social
functions, from the provision of police pro
tection and courts to the sponsorship of
academic research, would then have to be
supported privately.
Perhaps the philanthropy of wealthy
people could be counted on for the support
of research, and the members of com
munities could pool their resources to hire
private policemen, judges and so on. Hut the
idea that such a situation would lead to jus
tice or objectivity is. as Nobel Laureate Ken
neth Arrow put it in a related context,
"beyond the scope of belief."
2) Free market The Libertarian Party "ad
vocates the establishment of a purely free
market, that is. a market unhampered by
government intrusions." In other words.
Libertarians consider a market to be "purely

free" just so long as the government is not
involved.
By this definition, the American industries
dominated by huge trusts at the turn of the
century were "purely free" since the gov
ernment was then following a policy of
laissez-faire. Of course, consumers were not
free to choose among competing sellers. And
potential firms were not free to enter these
markets. Prices were abnormally high and
supplies abnormally limited. Nevertheless,
Libertarians would have preferred these car
tels and monopolies to the more competitive
markets that the anti-trust laws fostered in
their place.
3) No compulsory education Libertarians
oppose the laws that compel Americans to
obtain a certain minimum level of education.
They would also put an end to free public
schools in the name of ending "government
brainwashing and enslavement of American
children." I find this rather odd because our
forefathers, with whom the Libertarians
claim to have such a kindred spirit, sought to
make education widely available for the very
purpose of ensuring the liberty of the indi
vidual. They reasoned — and I would say,
correctly — that nothing was so great a threat
to personal freedom as ignorance.
Consider the effect of the Libertarian
scheme tin children from lower income
families. Both the legal impetus and the
economic ability of these children to attend
school would disappear. And this would
make them less free, less able to overcome
the economic disadvantages they inherited.
4) Isolationism Libertarians are political
"isolationists." They "advocate the with
drawal of American troops from other coun
tries of the world, believing that American
military forces have no business outside of
American borders."
An American foreign policy of noninter
vention would certainly afford greater liberty

to draft-age Americans, but it seems incon
ceivable that our non-communist allies
would enjoy a similar increase in freedom.
Without the protection of the American
military, they would become acutely vulner
able to the sort of aggression that recently
manifested itself in the Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan.

Clearly, there is sufficient reason to be
lieve that the price of "liberty".may be far
too high. But then why do Libertarians advo
cate their extreme position? The answer lies
in the broad statement of their goals: "We
look forward to a society . . . unencumbered
. . . by all forms of violence, including vio
lence in its ultimate form, political power."
Only a privileged and unsympathetic
group could rank political power as the ulti
mate form of violence. It seems that in the
stilted Libertarian view poverty, racism,
hunger and ignorance pale before the at
rocities of government regulation. And it is
this bizarre ordering of priorities which has
spawned such a heartless ideology.
