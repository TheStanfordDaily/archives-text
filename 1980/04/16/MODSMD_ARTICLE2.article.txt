## Begin calls for non-stop talks

The Washington Post
WASHINGTON — Israeli Prime
Minister Menachem Begin yesterday
proposed to President Jimmy Carter
that Egypt and Israel immediately
begin six weeks of non-stop negotia
tion\in the Middle East in an effort to
reach Agreement on the future status of
Israeli-occupied Arab lands.
The talks would be held by the Israeli
and Egyptian negotiating teams that in
10 months have been unable to resolve
any of the key issues involved in for
mulating an autonomy plan for 1.2
million Palestinians now living under
Israeli control.
In proposing intensified talks, the
sources said. Begin was picking up on
an idea that surfaced last week during
Carter's separate meeting with Egyp
tian President Anwar Sadat.
Sadat and Carter are known to have
favored the idea of having the three
principal negotiators — U.S. special
ambassador Sol Linowitz, Egyptian
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil and Is
raeli Interior Minister Yosef Burg —

meet here later this month for an ex
tended new round of talks.
According to the sources, Carter ex
pressed interest in the idea, but told
Begin they would first have to consult
Sadat and find out whether Egypt is
willing to keep the negotiations going
in the Middle East. Sources said last
night that Sadat's response is expected
today.
40 days left
The sources said Begin pointed out
that only 40 days remain between
today and May 26. As a result. Begin
reportedly said, he was willing to have a
new negotiating round begin im
mediately for 20 days in Tel Aviv and
then move to Alexandria for another
20 days.
The principal reason for moving
them here, as Sadat wanted, would
have been to allow Carter and Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance to play an
active mediating role as they did during
the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks in
Washington during late 1 978 and early
1979.
However, the Israelis are under

stood to have balked at making
Washington the new site for the talks
— in part because they tear that
negotiations in the shadow of the
White House would put them under
too much U.S. pressure, and in part
because Begin's Cabinet does not want
Burg or Foreign Minister Yitzhak
Shamir to be far from Israel for an ex
tended time.
That factor is especially important to
the Israelis who have followed a policy
of having Begin and his Cabinet keep a
tight control over Israel's negotiating
position. When the peace talks were
held here in 1978 and 1979, they had to
be interrupted at several critical points
while the Israeli negotiators went home
to confer with the Cabinet and receive
new instructions.
The sources did not disclose whether
the talks produced any significant
compromise ideas for bridging the gap
between Egypt's demand that the
Palestinians be given a self
government system almost completely
autonomous from Israel, and Israeli in
sistence on severlv limiting the au
tonomy of the occupied territories to
prevent their becoming an indepen
dent Palestinian state.
Jewish settlements
Further complicating the situation
has been Israel's insistence on estab
lishing Jewish settlements in the oc
cupied territories, despite repeated
U.S. protests. However, the mandate
given Begin by the Israeli Cabinet for
the White House talks precluded dis
cussion of any topics not specifically
covered by the 1978 Camp David ac
cords.
Since the Camp David agreement,
which is the basis of the autonomy
talks, does not mention the settle
ments. the Israelis have contended that
they cannot be discubsed in the
