Photo shocking
The picture- that appeared on
the front of the April l()th Daily
is entirely inappropriate. Placing
such a photograph indicates the
epitome of irresponsibility and
insensitivity. We find this photo
shocking and highly disrespect
ful. not only to the family of the
deceased woman, hut to your
readers as well.
There is absolutely no excuse
for using such poor judgement.

It was with a sense of sardonic
remorse that I viewed the Daily s
coverage Thursday of the frater
nity incidents. I congratulate the
publication on their creation of a
great media event.
Certainly it is newsworthy that
the dean of residential educa
tion is hot under the collar about
the incidents, and I am not with
out sympathy for the three stu
dents who were in jured — espe

cially the woman whose injuries
were more serious.
What concerns me is the curi
ous double standard applied to
the treatment of fraternities at
this school by both the Residen
tial Education office and the
Daily itself.
1 have yet to see the Daily
print an article telling of sprained
ankles incurred by students at
dorm parties or in the course of
athletic endeavors, but when it
happens at a fraternity party, it
suddenly becomes Big News.
The tone of the article implies
that the two men injured at the
KA house were the "victims" of
some great injustice, yet why
were there no comments from
the "victims" themselves? Were
they even asked if they wanted
their names in the paper? Or has
the Daily abandoned its policy of
anonymity for "victims"?
The two men were not even
asked to verify whether or not
they had been drinking; it was
simply accepted that an acting
assistant Row director was an
impeccable source for "inside"

information about what goes on
at rush parties.
To lump'these two injuries to
gether with the admittedly seri
ous injury of Susan Bird is at best
misleading and inflammatory
journalism. At worst. . . well, I'd
rather not think about it.

ASSU short-sheets
1 just don't understand why 1
am paying the ASSU $45 a year
to short-sheet my bed. Last
summer, 1 received a letter from
Terry Lewis, the manager of the
ASSU Linen Service, asking me
whether 1 would like to take ad
vantage of the linen service. Lit
tle did I know that the Linen Ser
vice would take advantage of me.
The letter stated, and I quote,
"We hope to save you the hassles
of finding sheets to fit dormitory
beds . . Now, being an ignor
ant freshman. I assumed that the
letter meant that the Linen Ser
vice would save me the hassle of
finding sheets to fit my dormit
ory bed, so I paid the $45. Appa
rently, I assumed wrong.
Lo and behold, the sheets I get
from the Linen Service are no
longer than the ones I had at
home. Last Sunday, 1 turned in
my old set of stained sheets and
towels and, as usual, was given a
new set of stained sheets and to
wels. I returned to my room and,
while making my bed, noticed
that one of the sheets seemed
especially short. I measured it
and discovered that it was 6'10"
by 6'o". My mattress is 6'B" by
j'2".
Believe it or not, that isn't a
particularly good fit. At this
point, I felt something had to be
done. I ripped the sheet off my
bed, stuffed it under one arm,
marched determinedly to the
Linen Service headquarters,
confronted the girl who had

given me the sheet, dropped it at
her feet and declared, "This
sheet is a little short."
She handed me another sheet
and said matter-of-factly, "I
know. The beds here are pretty
long, and it's hard to find sheets
that are long enough to fit
them."
"I understand that," I said in
my most patronizing tone,
"that's why I'm paying you $45 a
year — to find long sheets for
me." Apparently she wasn't in
timidated by my complaint, be
cause she shrugged and started
sorting out dirty towels. I re
turned to my room.
I guess next year I'll save $45
and short-sheet my bed myself.

Draft/public service
Columns in the Daily have re
cently taken up the subject of
conscientious objectors. The at
titude seems to be that draft
boards are inevitably bad, but
inevitable just the same. The lat
ter is not the case.
Draft boards could be elimi
nated; all draftees who object to
fighting for whatever reason,
could be allowed to choose an
alternative form of service. This
alternative might involve work in
the forestry commission, hospi
tals or WPA type projects —
anything of a productive nature.
The key to this system is that the
alternative be freely available as
an option to all, not a privilege
granted only to those deemed
worthy by a board or commis
sion.
In order to encourage enroll
ment in the military, it may be
necessary to demand longer ser
vice from those opting for the
alternative. Whether public ser
vice lasts one year longer or five
years longer than military service
is irrelevant. An alternative would
exist, and war protesters would

be allowed a way to serve both
their country and their consci
ence.
This is a politically expedient
solution to a gnarly problem,
since this would place the deci
sion back in the hands of the in
dividual, preserving some free
dom of choice. Surely this is pre
ferable to jailing or exiling a gen
eration of conscience-bound in
dividual*. Rober( Ho|brook

Arrests unjustified
After a week of careful con
sideration, I remain puzzled by
the recent arrests of gays on
campus.
The gay people at the Univer
sity are an important and re
spected part of the community.
Gay students, faculty, staff and
alumni contribute immeasurably
to the excellence in research and
teaching for which Stanford is so
highly acclaimed.
For those of us who are gay, or
who simply believe harassment
of gays to be an action unbecom
ing an institution dedicated to
the search for truth, the recent
arrests seem somehow less dis
crete and more offensive than
the acts that precipitated them.
Police power is a public trust,
not to be unwielded unnecessar
ily, especially in a university
community, where individual
freedom and tolerance are so
crucial. In a case like this one, the
security and safety of the com
munity can be better protected
by consulting affected con
stituencies (e.g. the GPU) and
issuing public warnings (e.g.
police statements to the Daily or
posted notices in locations men
tioned in complaints) well in ad
vance of "vice raids."
When I think of the many inci
dents of rowdyism and public
drunkenness that regularly occur
on campus without police inter
vention, of the heterosexual kis

sing, petting and soliciting that is
so übiquitous. I am hard pressed
to avoid the conclusion that last
week's arrests were discriminat
ory, oppressive and unjustified.

It was with a sense of sardonic

coverage Thursday of the frater

publication on their creation of a
great media event.
Certainly it is newsworthy that
the dean of residential educa

the incidents, and I am not with
out sympathy for the three stu
dents who were in jured — espe

cially the woman whose injuries
were more serious.
What concerns me is the curi
ous double standard applied to
the treatment of fraternities at
this school by both the Residen
tial Education office and the
Daily itself.
1 have yet to see the Daily
print an article telling of sprained
ankles incurred by students at
dorm parties or in the course of
athletic endeavors, but when it
happens at a fraternity party, it
suddenly becomes Big News.
The tone of the article implies
that the two men injured at the
KA house were the "victims" of
some great injustice, yet why
were there no comments from
the "victims" themselves? Were
they even asked if they wanted
their names in the paper? Or has
the Daily abandoned its policy of
anonymity for "victims"?
The two men were not even
asked to verify whether or not
they had been drinking; it was
simply accepted that an acting
assistant Row director was an
impeccable source for "inside"

information about what goes on
at rush parties.
To lump'these two injuries to

misleading and inflammatory

ASSU short-sheets
1 just don't understand why 1
am paying the ASSU $45 a year
to short-sheet my bed. Last
summer, 1 received a letter from
Terry Lewis, the manager of the
ASSU Linen Service, asking me
whether 1 would like to take ad
vantage of the linen service. Lit
tle did I know that the Linen Ser
vice would take advantage of me.
The letter stated, and I quote,
"We hope to save you the hassles
of finding sheets to fit dormitory
beds . . Now, being an ignor
ant freshman. I assumed that the
letter meant that the Linen Ser
vice would save me the hassle of
finding sheets to fit my dormit
ory bed, so I paid the $45. Appa
rently, I assumed wrong.
Lo and behold, the sheets I get
from the Linen Service are no
longer than the ones I had at
home. Last Sunday, 1 turned in
my old set of stained sheets and
towels and, as usual, was given a
new set of stained sheets and to
wels. I returned to my room and,
while making my bed, noticed
that one of the sheets seemed
especially short. I measured it
and discovered that it was 6'10"
by 6'o". My mattress is 6'B" by
j'2".
Believe it or not, that isn't a
particularly good fit. At this
point, I felt something had to be
done. I ripped the sheet off my
bed, stuffed it under one arm,
marched determinedly to the
Linen Service headquarters,
confronted the girl who had

given me the sheet, dropped it at
her feet and declared, "This
sheet is a little short."
She handed me another sheet
and said matter-of-factly, "I
know. The beds here are pretty
long, and it's hard to find sheets
that are long enough to fit
them."
"I understand that," I said in
my most patronizing tone,
"that's why I'm paying you $45 a
year — to find long sheets for
me." Apparently she wasn't in
timidated by my complaint, be
cause she shrugged and started
sorting out dirty towels. I re
turned to my room.
I guess next year I'll save $45
and short-sheet my bed myself.

Draft/public service
Columns in the Daily have re
cently taken up the subject of
conscientious objectors. The at
titude seems to be that draft
boards are inevitably bad, but
inevitable just the same. The lat
ter is not the case.
Draft boards could be elimi
nated; all draftees who object to
fighting for whatever reason,
could be allowed to choose an
alternative form of service. This
alternative might involve work in
the forestry commission, hospi
tals or WPA type projects —
anything of a productive nature.
The key to this system is that the
alternative be freely available as
an option to all, not a privilege
granted only to those deemed
worthy by a board or commis
sion.
In order to encourage enroll
ment in the military, it may be
necessary to demand longer ser
vice from those opting for the
alternative. Whether public ser
vice lasts one year longer or five
years longer than military service
is irrelevant. An alternative would
exist, and war protesters would

be allowed a way to serve both
their country and their consci
ence.
This is a politically expedient
solution to a gnarly problem,
since this would place the deci
sion back in the hands of the in
dividual, preserving some free
dom of choice. Surely this is pre
ferable to jailing or exiling a gen
eration of conscience-bound in

Arrests unjustified
After a week of careful con
sideration, I remain puzzled by
the recent arrests of gays on
campus.
The gay people at the Univer
sity are an important and re
spected part of the community.
Gay students, faculty, staff and
alumni contribute immeasurably
to the excellence in research and
teaching for which Stanford is so
highly acclaimed.
For those of us who are gay, or
who simply believe harassment
of gays to be an action unbecom
ing an institution dedicated to
the search for truth, the recent
arrests seem somehow less dis
crete and more offensive than
the acts that precipitated them.
Police power is a public trust,
not to be unwielded unnecessar
ily, especially in a university
community, where individual
freedom and tolerance are so
crucial. In a case like this one, the
security and safety of the com
munity can be better protected
by consulting affected con
stituencies (e.g. the GPU) and
issuing public warnings (e.g.
police statements to the Daily or
posted notices in locations men
tioned in complaints) well in ad
vance of "vice raids."
When I think of the many inci
dents of rowdyism and public
drunkenness that regularly occur
on campus without police inter
vention, of the heterosexual kis

sing, petting and soliciting that is
so übiquitous. I am hard pressed
to avoid the conclusion that last

Photo shocking
The picture- that appeared on
the front of the April l()th Daily
is entirely inappropriate. Placing
such a photograph indicates the
epitome of irresponsibility and
insensitivity. We find this photo
shocking and highly disrespect
ful. not only to the family of the
deceased woman, hut to your
readers as well.
There is absolutely no excuse
for using such poor judgement.

KA coverage
It was with a sense of sardonic
remorse that I viewed the Daily s
coverage Thursday of the frater
nity incidents. I congratulate the
publication on their creation of a
great media event.
Certainly it is newsworthy that
the dean of residential educa
tion is hot under the collar about
the incidents, and I am not with
out sympathy for the three stu
dents who were in jured — espe

cially the woman whose injuries
were more serious.
What concerns me is the curi
ous double standard applied to
the treatment of fraternities at
this school by both the Residen
tial Education office and the
Daily itself.
1 have yet to see the Daily
print an article telling of sprained
ankles incurred by students at
dorm parties or in the course of
athletic endeavors, but when it
happens at a fraternity party, it
suddenly becomes Big News.
The tone of the article implies
that the two men injured at the
KA house were the "victims" of
some great injustice, yet why
were there no comments from
the "victims" themselves? Were
they even asked if they wanted
their names in the paper? Or has
the Daily abandoned its policy of
anonymity for "victims"?
The two men were not even
asked to verify whether or not
they had been drinking; it was
simply accepted that an acting
assistant Row director was an
impeccable source for "inside"

information about what goes on
at rush parties.
To lump'these two injuries to
gether with the admittedly seri
ous injury of Susan Bird is at best
misleading and inflammatory
journalism. At worst. . . well, I'd
rather not think about it.

ASSU short-sheets
1 just don't understand why 1
am paying the ASSU $45 a year
to short-sheet my bed. Last
summer, 1 received a letter from
Terry Lewis, the manager of the
ASSU Linen Service, asking me
whether 1 would like to take ad
vantage of the linen service. Lit
tle did I know that the Linen Ser
vice would take advantage of me.
The letter stated, and I quote,
"We hope to save you the hassles
of finding sheets to fit dormitory
beds . . Now, being an ignor
ant freshman. I assumed that the
letter meant that the Linen Ser
vice would save me the hassle of
finding sheets to fit my dormit
ory bed, so I paid the $45. Appa
rently, I assumed wrong.
Lo and behold, the sheets I get
from the Linen Service are no
longer than the ones I had at
home. Last Sunday, 1 turned in
my old set of stained sheets and
towels and, as usual, was given a
new set of stained sheets and to
wels. I returned to my room and,
while making my bed, noticed
that one of the sheets seemed
especially short. I measured it
and discovered that it was 6'10"
by 6'o". My mattress is 6'B" by
j'2".
Believe it or not, that isn't a
particularly good fit. At this
point, I felt something had to be
done. I ripped the sheet off my
bed, stuffed it under one arm,
marched determinedly to the
Linen Service headquarters,
confronted the girl who had

given me the sheet, dropped it at
her feet and declared, "This
sheet is a little short."
She handed me another sheet
and said matter-of-factly, "I
know. The beds here are pretty
long, and it's hard to find sheets
that are long enough to fit
them."
"I understand that," I said in
my most patronizing tone,
"that's why I'm paying you $45 a
year — to find long sheets for
me." Apparently she wasn't in
timidated by my complaint, be
cause she shrugged and started
sorting out dirty towels. I re
turned to my room.
I guess next year I'll save $45
and short-sheet my bed myself.

Draft/public service
Columns in the Daily have re
cently taken up the subject of
conscientious objectors. The at
titude seems to be that draft
boards are inevitably bad, but
inevitable just the same. The lat
ter is not the case.
Draft boards could be elimi
nated; all draftees who object to
fighting for whatever reason,
could be allowed to choose an
alternative form of service. This
alternative might involve work in
the forestry commission, hospi
tals or WPA type projects —
anything of a productive nature.
The key to this system is that the
alternative be freely available as
an option to all, not a privilege
granted only to those deemed
worthy by a board or commis
sion.
In order to encourage enroll
ment in the military, it may be
necessary to demand longer ser
vice from those opting for the
alternative. Whether public ser
vice lasts one year longer or five
years longer than military service
is irrelevant. An alternative would
exist, and war protesters would

be allowed a way to serve both
their country and their consci
ence.
This is a politically expedient
solution to a gnarly problem,
since this would place the deci
sion back in the hands of the in
dividual, preserving some free
dom of choice. Surely this is pre
ferable to jailing or exiling a gen
eration of conscience-bound in
dividual*. Rober( Ho|brook

Arrests unjustified
After a week of careful con
sideration, I remain puzzled by
the recent arrests of gays on
campus.
The gay people at the Univer
sity are an important and re
spected part of the community.
Gay students, faculty, staff and
alumni contribute immeasurably
to the excellence in research and
teaching for which Stanford is so
highly acclaimed.
For those of us who are gay, or
who simply believe harassment
of gays to be an action unbecom
ing an institution dedicated to
the search for truth, the recent
arrests seem somehow less dis
crete and more offensive than
the acts that precipitated them.
Police power is a public trust,
not to be unwielded unnecessar
ily, especially in a university
community, where individual
freedom and tolerance are so
crucial. In a case like this one, the
security and safety of the com
munity can be better protected
by consulting affected con
stituencies (e.g. the GPU) and
issuing public warnings (e.g.
police statements to the Daily or
posted notices in locations men
tioned in complaints) well in ad
vance of "vice raids."
When I think of the many inci
dents of rowdyism and public
drunkenness that regularly occur
on campus without police inter
vention, of the heterosexual kis

sing, petting and soliciting that is
so übiquitous. I am hard pressed
to avoid the conclusion that last
week's arrests were discriminat
ory, oppressive and unjustified.
