# Cards win sloppy game
## 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
You just never know what to expect from the
Stanford baseball team. On second thought, expect
the unexpected — the Cardinals are certainly not
given to easy predictions. For example, the Cards
opened the season like greased lightning only to
(temporarily) run out of electricity when confer
ence play began, losing some games they should
have won. Then just last weekend they took a
series from USC, a team which had swept them
earlier in the season. And finally, yesterday the
Cardinal nine outlasted Cal State-Hayward 10-8.
Beating Hay ward 10-K or even beating them at
all, considering their 12-23 overall season record,
certainly wouldn't astonish many fans, but the
manner in which they did would.
Consider this: Stanford had to rally twice in the
late stages to stave off a surprisingly potent Hay
ward attack. The Cardinals managed only two hits
in the first five innings, yet in the next two innings
alone, they pushed home eight runs on seven hits.
Quite a turnaround.
Card heads were reeling indeed when Hayward
jumped to a 3-0 lead after two innings. Cardinal
starter Tim Sherrell, back from a surprisingly
strong outing last week against Santa Clara,
started, you guessed it, surprisingly slow yesterday.
In the first, Sherrell walked the opening batter.
Kelly King followed with a bunt single moving
runners to first and second. A double play hitter,
cleanup hitter Mike Benedetti singled home the
leadoff hitter who had advanced to third.
The second inning started much the same way
but ended twice as bad. Sherrell walked the first
two and then a pop out later, he threw away a pick
off attempt, scoring one. The other was brought
home by a King single.
The Cardinals got two back in the third, thanks

to two consecutive walks, a costly error by third
baseman Sean Mays, a fielder's choice which re
sulted in a run, and a hit — Paul Zuvella's run
scoring double.
Two scoreless innings passed before Hayward
opened up for three off lefty Bob Boatman in the
top of the sixth.
Again Hayward's runs weren't exactly hard
earned. A wild pitch and an equally wild throw by
third baseman Vince Sakowski with runners on
second and third scored both which didn't hurt the
Pioneer cause.
Designated-hitter John Elway walked to start
the sixth. Mike Toothman flied to center, but true
to the game's errant form, after a long run to get to
the ball, the center fielder dropped it. First base
man Eric Hardgrave, starting what turned out to be
an exceptional day at the plate, cracked a double
that just caught the left field chalk, scoring Flway.
Sakowski followed with a grounder which scored
Toothman.
Bob DeCosta, the hero of Sunday's game,
grounded to short, or rather through short and
Stanford had runners on first and second. Mike
Dotterer singled loading the bases. Then Mike Al
drete promptly singled in two of the runners to tie
the score for the first time. A walk later, slugger
El way strode to the plate with the bases jammed
and ... he too walked. Except that walk was an
RBI and Stanford edged ahead 7-6.
In the next, the Pioneers rudely greeted new
Card pitcher Lee Cline with three solid hits and two
equally concrete runs to regain their claim to the
lead. But ....
Eric Hardgrave homered to tie the game in the
bottom of the inning. Two outs later, Dotterer
tripled against the right field fence and scored what
turned out to be the winning run when a shoddy
relay Hew over the third baseman's head.

It's catcher vs. catcher as Stanford's Bill Worden slides home
against USC last weekend. The Cards took the Pac-1() series
2-1, beat Hayward yesterday, and continue their Pac-1()
schedule tomorrow against Arizona in Tucson.
