### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Round three of the "Big
Matches" between the top two
ranked teams in the nation —
Stanford and Cal — will get un
derway today starting at 1 p.m.
on the varsity courts with even
ing matches featuring the top
two singles matches and the
number one doubles matches
heginningat 6:30 p.m. at Maples
Pavillion. In the lirst two rounds
of matches between the two
powerhouses, Cal has edged the
Cards 5-4, with both matches
decided in the final doubles
match.
The Cards, however, are com
ing off their biggest weekend of
the season, as they defeated both
USC and UCLA in Southern
California — a feat which Stan
ford has accomplished only one
other time. On the same trip,
UC-Berkeley dropped both of
their matches to drop them out
of the top spot in the Pac-10 and
enable Stanford to share the top
spot with the Trojans with 5-1
records.
The matches should feature
excellent individual matches

along with a close team score*
The Cardinal lineup features
Peter Rennert, the top ranked
amateur in collegiate tennis,
along with lim Mayotte, former
No. 1 ranked junior in the
nation and winner of twelve
straight matches, and senior
All-American Lloyd Bourne.
The Bears are headed by a lineup
which includes Scott McCain,
the No. 3 ranking col
legiate player, and Ail-
Americans Marty Davis and
Chris Dunk.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
feels that a win against the Bears
coupled with wins over Trinity
and Pepperdine in matches com
ing up this weekend would give
Stanford the No. 1 rank
ing.
"We've got to win if we want to
stay on top (of the Pac-10)," he
said. "We had a great weekend
in L.A., and if we can get through
the next three matches, we
should be the No. 1 ranked team
in the nation."
Stanford will host Trinity
Saturday in similar day and even
ing matches and will host Pep
perdine Tuesday. April 22.
