President Jimmy Carter's
proposed international boycott
of the Moscow Olympics began
to take shape yesterday as Bri
tain and Australia joined the list
of nations putting renewed pres
sure on their athletes to stay
home this summer.
Countries favorable to the
boycott plan were known to have
been waiting tosee what the U.S.
Olympic Commitee did before
making their decisions.
And Carter began to pick up
the international support he
sought in the wake of the
USOC's 2-1 vote Saturday in
favor of the boycott.
The USOC decided Saturday
it would not participate in the

Moscow Games unless Carter
later decided it was in the na
tional interest that a team attend.
However, the White House
quickly made it clear that Carter
had no intention of changing his
mind.
Yesterday. British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher said
in the House of Commons that il
British athletes went to Moscow
it would he "a national dis
grace."
Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser sent telegrams
telling the 64 delegates to the
Australian Olympic Federation
that a boycott of the Games was
in the best interest of the coun
try's national security.
While the Carter campaign
picked up support, the Soviet

Union's campaign to downgrade
the boycott continued. Vitaly
Smirnov, first vice president of
the Moscow Olympic Organizing
Committee, insisted that the
Games would be held "whether
Americans come or not." He ad
ded. "Our conscience is clear."
Smirnov called the USOC de
cision "gross and unprecedented
political interference" in the
Games that could have "serious
repercussions" for the Olympic
movement.
The fresh statements from
Mrs. Thatcher and Fraser put the
governments of Britain, Au
stralia. West Germany, and
Japan firmly in the Carter camp.
The final decisions on sending
teams will be made by the coun
tries' National Olympic Commit-

tees.
West Germany is considered a
key nation among European al
lies which have not yet decided
the Olympic issue. After the
government's call for a boycott
on Monday, Willi Daume. West
German member of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee, said
the government's view "cer
tainly has weight" with its NOC'.
Japanese Prime Minister
Masayoshi Ohira is to \isit Car
ter at the end of the month and it
is known that he wants to present
Carter with a pro-boycott deci
sion at that time. Katsuji
Shibata, president of the
Japanese Olympic Committee,
said. "It is apparent the USOC's
decision will have a serious effect
on us.
