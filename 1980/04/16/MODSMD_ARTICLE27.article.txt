# Women netters beat Santa Clara
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
The Stanford women's tennis
team survived a brief seare from
unheralded Santa Clara Monday
after digging themselves into a
deep hole and barely escaped
with a 5-4 victory.
The match was the final
warm-up for the Cards before
they face No. 1 ranked USC Fri
day in an afternoon (outside)
and night (indoor) combination
match.
Stanford, playing only two
regulars in the singles matches
fell to a quick 2-4 deficit Mon
day. Needing to win all three
doubles maches. Coach Frank
Brennan called in the cavalry
and salvaged the win.
Brennan had planned to play
his number three doubles team
of Gayle Chan and Julia
Leighton in the number one spot
and fill most of the remaining
spots with reserves to give them
some experience.
After falling desperately be
hind. however. Brennan moved
Caryn Copeland, who was
scheduled to play number two
doubles with Judy Jordan, up to
the number one spot with her
regular partner Donna Rubin.
Copeland and Rubin normally
play number two doubles.
Brennan placed his high
powered No. 1 doubles tandem
of Alycia Moulton and Sue Ras
mussen in the number two spot
and mo\ed Chan and Leighton
down to their accustomed
number three position.
Once the Stanford regulars
were back in the line-up. how
ever. their order became
academic as the\ overwhelmed

Santa Clara in all three doubles
matches to secure their twelfth
victory of the season.
Copeland and Rubin
smothered Tammy Teichgraever
and Lucy Eggertson 6-0. 6-2;
Moulton and Rasmussen toyed
with Michele Ford and Carrie
Osborne before dumping them
6-3.6-2; and Chan and Leighton
did away with Mary Maloney
and Joan Portman 6-0, 6-1.
These same Santa Clara
players were mostly the same
bunch who only minutes earlier
had put Stanford in their predi
cament and were threatening to
upset one of the nation's top
ranked teams.
Osborne and Portman had
started the ball rolling with early
victories over Susie Barbe and
Andrea Markl in the fourth and
fifth singles matches by 6-4. 6-2
and 6-3. 6-1 margins, respec
tively.
Kathv Reillv and Michele
Ford added wins after splitting
sets with Judy Jordan and Cor
rine Nevinnv in the number
three and six matches.
Reillv edged Jordan 6-2. 5-7.
6-4 in the third singles match and
Ford escaped with a 6-4 third set
win over Nev inny in the number
six match.
Stanford regulars Moulton
and Copeland had landed vic
tories in the number one and two
matches with identical 6-3. 6-2
victories over Teichgraeber and
Eggertson.
In Friday's match. Stanford
will use its top line-up as it looks
for its first victory over top
ranked L'SC of the year. Action
will begin at 1:30 at the varsity
courts and 6:30 at Maples Pav ill
ion.
