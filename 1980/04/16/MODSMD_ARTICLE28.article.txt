Yates' main concern is the

team's concentration.
"Golfs not a physically gruel
ing sport, but you've got to go
out and concentrate for 5 hours.
Right now physical condition
isn't hurting us. it's concentra
tion."
The Stanford team must win

Yates has had a good deal of
practice planning tournaments
for Army, as the coach there.
"I think it's going to be an ex

citing tournament," said Yates.
"Everyone thinks that just be
cause they're amateur they
should shoot high scores, hut
we're not trying to punish the
kids here."

should make the tournament
more enjoyable for both players
and spectators.
"I'd like to see some of the
student body out there. "That
wouldn't hurt us at all." Yates
added.
