# Administration to consider strong moves against Iran in May
##

From the Daily wire serviees
WASHINGTON — The United
States has set a target date of mid-May
for a major reassesssment of the long
running Iran crisis, with the clear impli
cation that much stronger steps may he
ordered then in the absence of progress
toward release of the American hos
tages.
According to administration offi
cials, leaders of several allied nations
were informed by President Jimmy
Carter in telephone conversations late
last week of the target date for the U.S.
reassessment. Word of the timetable
also has been passed to the authorities
in Tehran, the sources said.
In other Middle East developments,
the Russian army has increased the
strength and readiness of some of its
motorized rifle divisions north of Iran,
U.S. intelligence sources said yester
day.
The intelligence sources, who asked
to remain anonymous, said the
strengthened Soviet army units in the
Transcaucasus region of Russia north
of the Iranian border also have stepped
up maneuvers and exercises.
But these sources exhibited no seri
ous concern that the Russians might be
preparing a strike into Iran similar to
their invasion of neighboring Afghanis
tan late last year.
State Department spokesman Hod
ding Carter, in a reference to the self
imposed deadline, said yesterday the

United States intends at "a time certain"
to reassess the Iranian situation "to lay
the basis for decisions on what is neces
sary in the way of further actions." The
spokesman did not publicly identify
this "time certain," but it is mid-May,
according to official sources.
Confusing history
Tjiis target date for a U.S. reassess
ment has a complex and confusing his
tory in administration policy-making
and the confidential dialogue with U.S.
allies. Originally selected three weeks
ago under different circumstances for a
reason that no longer holds forth, the
mid-May date now has taken on a life
of its own as a potential turning point in
the hostage saga.
According to accounts from official
sources, here is what happened: On
March 22, Carterand his senior foreign
policy advisers conducted a day-long
review at Camp David concentrating
on the discouraging state of the Iranian
negotiations. Efforts to free the hos
tages through the U.N. commission
and channels to Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr had reached a
dead end. Carter decided a new tack
was necessary.
Bani-Sadr was to be given a deadline
of March 31 for the promised transfer
of the hostages from control by their
militant captors to control by the Ira
nian government. If this were not done,
the United States would take new
economic and political steps against

Iran on March 31. and the threat of
military action would he revived.
U.S. allies in Europe and Japan,
along with a few others, were informed
of these developments hy a confiden
tial message dispatched March 25 over
the signature of the president. This
message called on the allies to join in
exerting pressure on Iran in order to
stave off the necessity for the United
States to take more forceful and
dangerous actions later.
The allies also were informed, the
sources said, that the United States
might call on them to break diplomatic
relations with Iran hy "the middle of
May" if other non-military measures

JU*. . .
failed to produce results by then.
mid-May was chosen because it would
give the other economic and political
steps time to work, and because it
would give Iran time to sort out its
political authority.
In late March, the second round of
elections for the new Iranian parlia
ment was expected to convene and pos
sibly address the future of the hostages
by early May.
Logical date
In this context, the mid-May timeta
ble was a logical target date for
stronger steps. But, after it was estab
lished. several develoments occurred:
— Due to widespread charges of

fraud in the initial voting, the second
round of parliamentary elections was
postponed until early May. Because of
this. Iran's parliament is not expected
to meet until June. This timing is im
portant, because all the often
conflicting power centers in Iran are
agreed that the parliament will debate
and decide the hostages' future.
— Bani-Sadr. under prodding from
Washington and its allies, tried openly
to bring about transfer of the hostages
and was stymied. This latest rise and
collapse of hopes led to bitter disap
pointment in the United States and re
newed political pressure on Carter to
take stronger action on behalf of the

hostages.
Carter announced a new series of
measures on April 7, including the
break in Washington's diplomatic rela
tions with Iran. Originally, this step had
been expected later in the spring. And
now the administration has redoubled
its appeal to U.S. allies to take strong
new measures of their own.
The president surprised and upset
the allies last weekend by revealing
publicly that there is a "specific date"
for allied action in the hostage crisis.
,And yesterday the mid-May date sur
faced in new form — as a date for U.S.
assessment of the need for forceful
steps.
