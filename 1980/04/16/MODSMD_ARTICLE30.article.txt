Beane signs in
Bill Beane, one of the nation's
top two-sport high school
athletes, has signed a national
letter of intent to play baseball
and football on the Farm.
Beane was a two-time All-CIF
First team outfielder-pitcher and
a top quarterback prospect at
Mt. Carmel High School in San
Diego. He will begin at Stanford
this fall.
"We're excited about Bill's
decision because we considered
him to be one of the top high
school baseball players in the
country," Stanford baseball
coach Mark Marquess said. "He
holds virtually every hitting and
pitching record at Mt. Carmel.
He's just a tremendous athlete
who's considered by major
league scouts to be one of the top
prospects in the nation. He
should make an immediate im
pact on our program as a
freshman."
Beane, 6-3, 190 pounds, en
tered the 1980 baseball season
with a .506 career batting aver
age and 14-6 win-loss record. He
holds the Mt. Carmel record for
RBI in one season with 37 in
1978 and. as a pitcher, started
this year with a 1.91 ERA, in
cluding 1 77 strikeouts in 136 in
nings.
Beane's value as a football
player at Stanford is somewhat

more tentative, as he hasn't
played since his sophomore year.
But Card head football coach
Paul Wiggin says he is consi
dered one of the state's top pas
sers.
"Bill is an outstanding athlete
with a good arm." Wiggin said.
"He has great raw talent and po
tential as a quarterback. He has
decided to bring football back
into his life, and we're delighted
he's chosen Stanford. Bill will
compete with Kevin McCracken
and Billv Garret for the backup
quarterback spot behind John
Elway"
Women's Crew
The women's crew team con
tinued its early season show of
strength at Redwood Shores this
weekend with convincing wins
over USC and Santa Clara. In
the varsity eight, Stanford came
off the line last with a sloppy
start, but settled crisply into a
strong 35 stroke per minute rac
ing beat, passing USC within 300
meters and gaining steadily on
Santa Clara. A power-ten just
before the 500 meter mark,
coupled with an even more pow
erful surge 15 strokes later, ef
fectively put Santa Clara out of
the race. The eight then cruised
to a 1 3 A length victory in 3:18.5
over Santa Clara's 3:26.2.
Beaten by the same crew two

weeks ago, this represents a cru
cial win for the varsity boat. USC
finished in 3:32.3. The novice
eight, after a slow start, gained
ground (or water) throughout
the race but came up short by a
length in 3:37.7 to Santa Clara,
who finished in 3:33.3; St.
Mary's trailed with 4:03.4. The
novice four powered to a 4:03.5
victory over Santa Clara's
4:07.8. Next week the team
travels north to face Humboldt
as a final tune-up before the Bay
Area Rowing Festival April
26-27 in Oakland.
Narrow cricket defeat
Monday the Stanford Cricket
Club lost by nine runs in a closely
contested game against the Che
shire Cats, a touring team from
England. The visitors scored 173
for 7 wickets in 40 overs, with D.
Jones hitting 76. Stanford re
plied with a score of 1 64 all out in
37 overs.
Stanford received useful bat
ting performances from Roger
Pettman (28), John Pierce (27)
and Aruna Amirthanayagam
(26).
Elwood of the Cheshire Cats
took 6 wickets for 52 runs.
Stanford returns to regular
league competition next Sunday
with an away game against the
Fresno Cricket Club.

meters and gaining steadily on
Santa Clara. A power-ten just
before the 500 meter mark,
coupled with an even more pow
erful surge 15 strokes later, ef
fectively put Santa Clara out of
the race. The eight then cruised
to a 1 3 A length victory in 3:18.5
over Santa Clara's 3:26.2.
Beaten by the same crew two

weeks ago, this represents a cru
cial win for the varsity boat. USC
finished in 3:32.3. The novice
eight, after a slow start, gained
ground (or water) throughout
the race but came up short by a
length in 3:37.7 to Santa Clara,
who finished in 3:33.3; St.
Mary's trailed with 4:03.4. The
novice four powered to a 4:03.5
victory over Santa Clara's
4:07.8. Next week the team
travels north to face Humboldt
as a final tune-up before the Bay
Area Rowing Festival April
26-27 in Oakland.

Beane signs in
Bill Beane, one of the nation's
top two-sport high school
athletes, has signed a national
letter of intent to play baseball
and football on the Farm.
Beane was a two-time All-CIF
First team outfielder-pitcher and
a top quarterback prospect at
Mt. Carmel High School in San
Diego. He will begin at Stanford
this fall.
"We're excited about Bill's
decision because we considered
him to be one of the top high
school baseball players in the
country," Stanford baseball
coach Mark Marquess said. "He
holds virtually every hitting and
pitching record at Mt. Carmel.
He's just a tremendous athlete
who's considered by major
league scouts to be one of the top
prospects in the nation. He
should make an immediate im
pact on our program as a
freshman."
Beane, 6-3, 190 pounds, en
tered the 1980 baseball season
with a .506 career batting aver
age and 14-6 win-loss record. He
holds the Mt. Carmel record for
RBI in one season with 37 in
1978 and. as a pitcher, started
this year with a 1.91 ERA, in
cluding 1 77 strikeouts in 136 in
nings.
Beane's value as a football
player at Stanford is somewhat

more tentative, as he hasn't
played since his sophomore year.
But Card head football coach
Paul Wiggin says he is consi
dered one of the state's top pas
sers.
"Bill is an outstanding athlete
with a good arm." Wiggin said.
"He has great raw talent and po
tential as a quarterback. He has
decided to bring football back
into his life, and we're delighted
he's chosen Stanford. Bill will
compete with Kevin McCracken
and Billv Garret for the backup
quarterback spot behind John
Elway"
Women's Crew
The women's crew team con
tinued its early season show of
strength at Redwood Shores this
weekend with convincing wins
over USC and Santa Clara. In
the varsity eight, Stanford came
off the line last with a sloppy
start, but settled crisply into a
strong 35 stroke per minute rac
ing beat, passing USC within 300
meters and gaining steadily on
Santa Clara. A power-ten just
before the 500 meter mark,
coupled with an even more pow
erful surge 15 strokes later, ef
fectively put Santa Clara out of
the race. The eight then cruised
to a 1 3 A length victory in 3:18.5
over Santa Clara's 3:26.2.
