NEW YORK (AP) _
Negotiators for major league
baseball's club owners and
players union made unspecified
progress in seven hours of con
tract talks yesterday and a fed
eral mediator suggested
"fireworks" at Wednesday's ses
sion.
"Tomorrow, compensation is
on the 10 a.m. agenda. We may
have some fireworks or at least
some pre-crisis excitement,"
said Kenneth Moffett of the
Federal Mediation and Concilia
tion Service. "The last time they
(the players and owners) met,
there were fireworks, but no one
raised their voices and there was
no blood on the floor.
"This is really a one-issue
negotiation," Moffett said of

compensation. ". . . the rest is
housekeeping."
Currently, a team receives an
amateur draft choice at best it it
loses a player to free agency. The
owners want the new contract to
require a team which signs a free
agent to give up a name player in
some cases to the free agent's
former club, a system similar to
the National Football League —
one which the NFL players'
union says restricts freedom ol
movement.
Both Ray Grebcy, chief
negotiator for the 26 club own
ers, and Marvin Miller, his coun
terpart for the players, said prog
ress was made on smaller con
tract items as the two sides work
to avoid a May 23 strike.
