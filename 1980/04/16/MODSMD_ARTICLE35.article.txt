# Booters first in tourney
## 
### Jennifer Seymour Staff Writer 
"I've never seen us so psyched
up for a game, ever," said Stan
ford women's soccer team
member Nancy Geisse. "By
overtime, even people who'd
never spoken together were
cheering and jumping arm-in
arm." It was this energy which
allowed Stanford to defeat Ber
keley in the Westmont Tourna
ment finals, ultimately giving the
Cards the title at this weekend's
Santa Barbara-based competi
tion.
Playing a two-day single
elimination tourney against nine
tough teams, Stanford overtook
Humboldt 4-0 and UCLA 2-0 in
Friday's matches.
The Cards clinched the tour
nament title after a close 3-2 win
over the Bears on Saturday. This
triumph was arrived at after 10
minutes of overtime play.
This is not surprising consider
ing the stakes in this final dual —
according to Geisse, Stanford
women'ssoccer team is now con
sidered "the best in California,
for sure. We really tried hard to
win — everybody tried. We re
ally came together in that last
game."

The victories the Stanford
women scored this weekend are
especially noteworthy in light of
the circumstances. Not only did
they have weather in the '70s to
contend with, but the fields were
all hard, narrow and full of
drainage trenches. Injuries ac
counted for the absence of Cathy
Morris and Sarah Little, also
hindered team performance,
making play a little slower.
Stanford made an exceptional
showing, nonetheless, placing
four members in the all
tourney team: Cindy Shorney,
Joan Sanders. Sue Handel and
Pauline McNamara.
The Cards began the tourna
ment by shutting out Humboldt
with fine performances from
Shorney and Geisse, who each
put in two goals. The game was
the slowest of the three, how
ever, showing none of the
exuberance displayed in later
play.
So what turned up the voltage
for the team? Said Geisse, "A lot
of it was Tony's (coach Tony
Igwe) half time talk at the UCLA
game that got us going. He just
said we were staring instead of
trying and if we wanted to we
could go out there and do it, be

cause he know we were better
than they. So we did it."
The words must have had af
fect, because the team went on to
break a half-time 0-0 draw and
defeat UCLA 2-0. Goals were
scored by Shorney, on a penalty
shot, and Kathy Carey.
Becky Schwartz made a special
showing in this game: given the
difficult job of marking the
player who was later named
tournament MVP, Schwartz
kept her from taking a single
shot.
The climax of the tournament
was, without doubt, Saturday af
ternoon's clash with the Bears.
First-half play was even, though
striker Shorney did give the
Cards the upper hand with an
early goal.
Berkeley picked up speed in
the game's second half, putting
two past Stanford to take the
lead. With only five minutes left
to play, Carey volleyed in a goal
on a sailing cross from Sue
Handle to tie up the match.
Early in overtime play Shor
ney dropped one in. taking a long
lob pass and beating the rushing
goalie for the game- and
tournament-winning score.
