Economy slumps; recession seen
WASHINGTON — The government reported
another major sign yesterday that the long-predicted
recession finally is under way: industrial output
plunged 0.8 percent in March as production slumped
all across the economy.
That development came as the Ford Motor Co.,
trying to staunch mounting Kisses, announced it will
close its assembly plant in Wahwah, N.J., and lav off a
total of 15.000 more employees nationwide, bringing
layoffs in the auto industry to about 250,000.
In another basic industry, meanwhile, the United
Steelworkers union ratified a new contract that offi
cials say could boost the industry's labor costs by at
least a third over the next three years.
It was not immediately clear whether the pact viol
ated the Carter administration's 7.5 to 9.5 percent
per-year anti-inflation wage guideline, and White
House officials declined to comment on the settle
ment pending complex calculations.
Major steel companies currently are pressing for
new import restrictions in large part on grounds that
their labor costs are so high that they cannot compete
against foreign producers.
In other economic news yesterday,-the Commerce
Department issued revised figures showing the pro
fits of American corporations declined more sharply
than expected late last year after adjustment for infla
tion, with only the oil industry show ingimprovement.
The developments added substantially to earlier
indications that the recession is gathering momen
tum. The housing industry has been in a slump for
weeks, retail sales are falling v isihl> and joblessness is
on the rise.
Treasury Secretary G. William Miller told repor
ters that "the signs are that we have a slowdown, and
this time it appears to be more confirmed across the
board." Miller continued to predict, however that the
recession would be mild.
The report on industrial production showed the
■slump in the nation's factory output became far more
pervasive in March than it was in previous months.
However, while previous declines were concen
trated primarily in the auto industry. last month's
sharp drop was felt in virtually every sector of the
economy. with production of consumer goods down a
hefty O.N percent.
The nation's industrial output now stands at a level
1.2 percent below that of a year ago. The 0.2 percent
decline reported yesterday for February originally
was estimated as a 0.2 percent rise.
West pledges aid to Turkey
WASHINGTON — With West Germany and the
I nited States leading the way. the major Western
nations yesterday pledged a total of $1.16 billion in
emergency aid to rescue Turkey from threatened
economic and political collapse.
l urkey has been plagued by 20 percent un
employment. SO percent inflation, lack of hard cur
rency to pay for oil imports and a wave of political
violence that prompted Prime Minister Suleyman
Demirel two months ago to appeal for aid. "If we fail
to obtain Western support we may become another
Afghanistan," he said at the time.
I lie scope of Western aid package now being put
together reflects a major effort to strengthen the
strategic country on NATO's southern flank in the
wake of regional turmoil generated by Iran develop
ments and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Yesterdays joint action demonstrated a firm allied
support for Demirel's stabilization program and
brought the aid figure close to the level required to set
I urkey on a recovery course.
1 urkey has already received $220 million from the
International Monetary Fund.
U.S. officials here said that the governmental aid
package was expected to encourage private bank
loans to Turkey. They also indicated that the United
States and other Western allies would try to re
schedule Turkish debts in a move that would bring
the total worth of Western aid to well over $2 billion.
Demirel said in February that Turkey needed
about $2 billion in emergency aid this year to revive

Turkey's "dying economy" and prevent social and
economic unrest "from which only Communists
would benefit."
The United States and West Germany made the
largest pledges, $295 million each. Italy pledged
$115 million; France, Japan and the European
Community $100 million each; other contributors
include Britain. Switzerland, Canada and the Nether
lands.
But it is still unclear whehter Demirel would be
able to turn the economy around. In an effort to
revive it. Demirel advanced a series of reform prop
osals aimed at strengthening a market economy, at
tracting foreign investments, denationalizing mines,
encouraging exports and cutting the benefits enjoyed
by state-owned firms with monopolies on both im
ports and sales.
Court extends arrest warrant use
WASHINGTON — In a sweeping and surprising
extension of Fourth Amendment protections, the
Supreme Court ruled 6-3 yesterday that police gen
erally may not enter an individual's house to arrest
him without first obtaining a warrant.
Citing the nation's"overriding respect for the sanc
tity of the home." the high court struck down a New
York law that had permitted police to enter a resi
dence without a warrant, using force where neces
sary. to make routine felony arrests.
The decision means that, from now on. police must
follow the same procedures in arresting a person at
home that they employ in searching a home. In both
cases, police ordinarily must first ask a court or magis
trate for a warrant, which they may obtain only by
showing that they have probable cause to believe the
law is being broken.
The only exception to the warrant requirement is
for special, emergency circumstances —such as when
police have indications that a suspect is suddenly
about to flee or destroy evidence, or w hen they must
act quickly to prevent someone from being harmed.
The three dissenters — Justices Byron White and
William Rehnquist and Chief Justice Warren Burger
— predicted that the new ruling will make life harder
for law-enforcement officials.
"The policeman on his beat must now make subtle
discriminations that perplex even judges in their
chambers," White wrote.
The six-member majority said it viewed these
claims "with skepticism" — and that, in any event,
these practical and policy considerations must give
way to the "constitutional command" of the Fourth
Amendment.
Over the past few years, the Burger Court has been
accused of narrowing the scope of the Fourth
Amendment through a series of decisions authorizing
police to make searches or arrests in a variety of
circumstances. Yesterday's ruling was a major step in
the opposite direction.
In a second criminal-law ruling yesterday, the high
court decided S-1 that a judge may sometimes impose
a stiffer sentence on a convicted person because he
refuses to cooperate with prosecutors.
But. in a narrow and carefully-worded decision,
the court made it clear that a criminal defendant
cannot be penalized for refusing to cooperate with
the government if he is shown to be acting out of a
desire to avoid incriminating himself.
The ruling makes no dramatic changes in the crim
inal law.
Carter seeks $17,000 tax refund
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter,
whose net worth slipped under $ I million in 1979. is
seeking an income tax refund from the federal gov
ernment of nearly $17,000, the White House dis
closed yesterday.
The president and his wife dropped out of the ranks
of the nation's millionaires in 1979. according to
documents made public on the day Americans were
required to send in their income tax statements to the
Internal Revenue Service.
The documents showed assets of $1,054,178.95

and liabilities of $160,874.60. Thus, the Carters' net
worth was $893,304.35.
Their total tax hill was $64, t >44.8 1, on an adjusted
income of $193,823.77.
The tax figures were spread over 1 0 separate forms
and included such figures as a $15.53 deduction for
postage and the president's $200,000 annual salary
from the U.S. Treasury.
Brown's name remains on ballot
SACRAMENTO — A Sacramento judge refused
yesterday to remove Gov. Jerry Brown's name from
California's June 3 presidential primary ballot.
Brown had asked the court in a writ filed earlier
yesterday to take his name off the Democratic prim
ary ballot on grounds that it would confuse voters to
see his name listed after he had withdrawn from the
race.
Superior Court Judge Fred Marler said he believed
he had authority to delete Brown's name if the gover
nor's petition had been received in a '•timely" man
ner.
But, Marler noted, several counties have already
begun printing ballots. The judge said deleting
Brown's name now would be a costly "disruption of
the elective process (which) far outweighs any confu
sion that might be caused" b\ Brown's name remain
ing on the ballot.
The ruling means that the Democratic ballot will
have the names of President Jimmy Carter. Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Lyndon Laßouche,
Brown and Unpledged Delegation for presidential
convention delegates.
Brown withdrew from the presidential campaign
April 1, after finishing third in Wiscomsin's primary.
Thermostats must stay at 78
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter, act
ing only hours before the program was to expire,
signed a proclamation yesterday extending for nine
months the mandatory temperature controls for 2.8
million offices, shops and other non-residential build
ings.
Carter's action means Americanscan look forward
to another hot summer with required thermostat set
tings of 78 degrees. The program imposes 65 degree
limits on heating in the winter.
In addition to extending the program, authorized
by Congress last year to meet energy emergencies.
Carter will ask Congress for legislation to make the
thermostat settings a permanent fixture of American
life just like the 55 mph speed limit, administration
officials said.
Earlier yesterday Deputy Energy Secretary John
Sawhill told a congressional committee and reporters
at a press conference that Carter planned to sign the
proclamation because he had determined the prog
ram, which was due to expire at midnight yesterday,
had "worked and worked well."
The program had been the subject of an intense
debate among administration attorneys. Some ar
gued that the law only allowed imposition of the
temperature controls if the president made a finding
of a "severe energy supply interruption," such as he
did in imposing the controls last July 16 in the midest
of long gasoline lines in many parts of the country.
Sawhill put the savings since Carter imposed the
controls at 30 million barrels of oil. The United States
saved $1 billion in energy compared to a cost of
administering the program of $8 million, he said.
Critics have charged that despite Carter's assur
ances that the controls would be strictly enforced,
there have been no fines imposed for non-compliance
and the Energy Department provided only 10 federal
inspectors to conduct building audits.
Stocks decline in listless session
NEW YORK — Thirst ockmarket declinedslighfly
yesterday in a listless session on Wall Street.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped
1.54 to 783.36.
Declines outnumbered advances by a 5-4 margin

had "worked and worked well."
The program had been the subject of an intense
debate among administration attorneys. Some ar
gued that the law only allowed imposition of the
temperature controls if the president made a finding
of a "severe energy supply interruption," such as he
did in imposing the controls last July 16 in the midest
of long gasoline lines in many parts of the country.
Sawhill put the savings since Carter imposed the
controls at 30 million barrels of oil. The United States
saved $1 billion in energy compared to a cost of
administering the program of $8 million, he said.
Critics have charged that despite Carter's assur
ances that the controls would be strictly enforced,
there have been no fines imposed for non-compliance
and the Energy Department provided only 10 federal
inspectors to conduct building audits.

Economy slumps; recession seen
WASHINGTON — The government reported
another major sign yesterday that the long-predicted
recession finally is under way: industrial output
plunged 0.8 percent in March as production slumped
all across the economy.
That development came as the Ford Motor Co.,
trying to staunch mounting Kisses, announced it will
close its assembly plant in Wahwah, N.J., and lav off a
total of 15.000 more employees nationwide, bringing
layoffs in the auto industry to about 250,000.
In another basic industry, meanwhile, the United
Steelworkers union ratified a new contract that offi
cials say could boost the industry's labor costs by at
least a third over the next three years.
It was not immediately clear whether the pact viol
ated the Carter administration's 7.5 to 9.5 percent
per-year anti-inflation wage guideline, and White
House officials declined to comment on the settle
ment pending complex calculations.
Major steel companies currently are pressing for
new import restrictions in large part on grounds that
their labor costs are so high that they cannot compete
against foreign producers.
In other economic news yesterday,-the Commerce
Department issued revised figures showing the pro
fits of American corporations declined more sharply
than expected late last year after adjustment for infla
tion, with only the oil industry show ingimprovement.
The developments added substantially to earlier
indications that the recession is gathering momen
tum. The housing industry has been in a slump for
weeks, retail sales are falling v isihl> and joblessness is
on the rise.
Treasury Secretary G. William Miller told repor
ters that "the signs are that we have a slowdown, and
this time it appears to be more confirmed across the
board." Miller continued to predict, however that the
recession would be mild.
The report on industrial production showed the
■slump in the nation's factory output became far more
pervasive in March than it was in previous months.
However, while previous declines were concen
trated primarily in the auto industry. last month's
sharp drop was felt in virtually every sector of the
economy. with production of consumer goods down a
hefty O.N percent.
The nation's industrial output now stands at a level
1.2 percent below that of a year ago. The 0.2 percent
decline reported yesterday for February originally
was estimated as a 0.2 percent rise.
West pledges aid to Turkey
WASHINGTON — With West Germany and the
I nited States leading the way. the major Western
nations yesterday pledged a total of $1.16 billion in
emergency aid to rescue Turkey from threatened
economic and political collapse.
l urkey has been plagued by 20 percent un
employment. SO percent inflation, lack of hard cur
rency to pay for oil imports and a wave of political
violence that prompted Prime Minister Suleyman
Demirel two months ago to appeal for aid. "If we fail
to obtain Western support we may become another
Afghanistan," he said at the time.
I lie scope of Western aid package now being put
together reflects a major effort to strengthen the
strategic country on NATO's southern flank in the
wake of regional turmoil generated by Iran develop
ments and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Yesterdays joint action demonstrated a firm allied
support for Demirel's stabilization program and
brought the aid figure close to the level required to set
I urkey on a recovery course.
1 urkey has already received $220 million from the
International Monetary Fund.
U.S. officials here said that the governmental aid
package was expected to encourage private bank
loans to Turkey. They also indicated that the United
States and other Western allies would try to re
schedule Turkish debts in a move that would bring
the total worth of Western aid to well over $2 billion.
Demirel said in February that Turkey needed
about $2 billion in emergency aid this year to revive

Turkey's "dying economy" and prevent social and
economic unrest "from which only Communists
would benefit."
The United States and West Germany made the
largest pledges, $295 million each. Italy pledged
$115 million; France, Japan and the European
Community $100 million each; other contributors
include Britain. Switzerland, Canada and the Nether
lands.
But it is still unclear whehter Demirel would be
able to turn the economy around. In an effort to
revive it. Demirel advanced a series of reform prop
osals aimed at strengthening a market economy, at
tracting foreign investments, denationalizing mines,
encouraging exports and cutting the benefits enjoyed
by state-owned firms with monopolies on both im
ports and sales.
Court extends arrest warrant use
WASHINGTON — In a sweeping and surprising
extension of Fourth Amendment protections, the
Supreme Court ruled 6-3 yesterday that police gen
erally may not enter an individual's house to arrest
him without first obtaining a warrant.
Citing the nation's"overriding respect for the sanc
tity of the home." the high court struck down a New
York law that had permitted police to enter a resi
dence without a warrant, using force where neces
sary. to make routine felony arrests.
The decision means that, from now on. police must
follow the same procedures in arresting a person at
home that they employ in searching a home. In both
cases, police ordinarily must first ask a court or magis
trate for a warrant, which they may obtain only by
showing that they have probable cause to believe the
law is being broken.
The only exception to the warrant requirement is
for special, emergency circumstances —such as when
police have indications that a suspect is suddenly
about to flee or destroy evidence, or w hen they must
act quickly to prevent someone from being harmed.
The three dissenters — Justices Byron White and
William Rehnquist and Chief Justice Warren Burger
— predicted that the new ruling will make life harder
for law-enforcement officials.
"The policeman on his beat must now make subtle
discriminations that perplex even judges in their
chambers," White wrote.
The six-member majority said it viewed these
claims "with skepticism" — and that, in any event,
these practical and policy considerations must give
way to the "constitutional command" of the Fourth
Amendment.
Over the past few years, the Burger Court has been
accused of narrowing the scope of the Fourth
Amendment through a series of decisions authorizing
police to make searches or arrests in a variety of
circumstances. Yesterday's ruling was a major step in
the opposite direction.
In a second criminal-law ruling yesterday, the high
court decided S-1 that a judge may sometimes impose
a stiffer sentence on a convicted person because he
refuses to cooperate with prosecutors.
But. in a narrow and carefully-worded decision,
the court made it clear that a criminal defendant
cannot be penalized for refusing to cooperate with
the government if he is shown to be acting out of a
desire to avoid incriminating himself.
The ruling makes no dramatic changes in the crim
inal law.
Carter seeks $17,000 tax refund
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter,
whose net worth slipped under $ I million in 1979. is
seeking an income tax refund from the federal gov
ernment of nearly $17,000, the White House dis
closed yesterday.
The president and his wife dropped out of the ranks
of the nation's millionaires in 1979. according to
documents made public on the day Americans were
required to send in their income tax statements to the
Internal Revenue Service.
The documents showed assets of $1,054,178.95

and liabilities of $160,874.60. Thus, the Carters' net
worth was $893,304.35.
Their total tax hill was $64, t >44.8 1, on an adjusted
income of $193,823.77.
The tax figures were spread over 1 0 separate forms
and included such figures as a $15.53 deduction for
postage and the president's $200,000 annual salary
from the U.S. Treasury.
Brown's name remains on ballot
SACRAMENTO — A Sacramento judge refused
yesterday to remove Gov. Jerry Brown's name from
California's June 3 presidential primary ballot.
Brown had asked the court in a writ filed earlier
yesterday to take his name off the Democratic prim
ary ballot on grounds that it would confuse voters to
see his name listed after he had withdrawn from the
race.
Superior Court Judge Fred Marler said he believed
he had authority to delete Brown's name if the gover
nor's petition had been received in a '•timely" man
ner.
But, Marler noted, several counties have already
begun printing ballots. The judge said deleting
Brown's name now would be a costly "disruption of
the elective process (which) far outweighs any confu
sion that might be caused" b\ Brown's name remain
ing on the ballot.
The ruling means that the Democratic ballot will
have the names of President Jimmy Carter. Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Lyndon Laßouche,
Brown and Unpledged Delegation for presidential
convention delegates.
Brown withdrew from the presidential campaign
April 1, after finishing third in Wiscomsin's primary.
Thermostats must stay at 78
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter, act
ing only hours before the program was to expire,
signed a proclamation yesterday extending for nine
months the mandatory temperature controls for 2.8
million offices, shops and other non-residential build
ings.
Carter's action means Americanscan look forward
to another hot summer with required thermostat set
tings of 78 degrees. The program imposes 65 degree
limits on heating in the winter.
In addition to extending the program, authorized
by Congress last year to meet energy emergencies.
Carter will ask Congress for legislation to make the
thermostat settings a permanent fixture of American
life just like the 55 mph speed limit, administration
officials said.
Earlier yesterday Deputy Energy Secretary John
Sawhill told a congressional committee and reporters
at a press conference that Carter planned to sign the
proclamation because he had determined the prog
ram, which was due to expire at midnight yesterday,
had "worked and worked well."
The program had been the subject of an intense

Thermostats must stay at 78
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter, act
ing only hours before the program was to expire,
signed a proclamation yesterday extending for nine
months the mandatory temperature controls for 2.8
million offices, shops and other non-residential build
ings.
Carter's action means Americanscan look forward
to another hot summer with required thermostat set
tings of 78 degrees. The program imposes 65 degree
limits on heating in the winter.
In addition to extending the program, authorized
by Congress last year to meet energy emergencies.
Carter will ask Congress for legislation to make the
thermostat settings a permanent fixture of American
life just like the 55 mph speed limit, administration
officials said.
Earlier yesterday Deputy Energy Secretary John
Sawhill told a congressional committee and reporters
at a press conference that Carter planned to sign the
proclamation because he had determined the prog
ram, which was due to expire at midnight yesterday,
had "worked and worked well."
The program had been the subject of an intense
debate among administration attorneys. Some ar
gued that the law only allowed imposition of the
temperature controls if the president made a finding
of a "severe energy supply interruption," such as he
did in imposing the controls last July 16 in the midest
of long gasoline lines in many parts of the country.
Sawhill put the savings since Carter imposed the
controls at 30 million barrels of oil. The United States
saved $1 billion in energy compared to a cost of
administering the program of $8 million, he said.
Critics have charged that despite Carter's assur
ances that the controls would be strictly enforced,
there have been no fines imposed for non-compliance
and the Energy Department provided only 10 federal
inspectors to conduct building audits.

Economy slumps; recession seen
WASHINGTON — The government reported
another major sign yesterday that the long-predicted
recession finally is under way: industrial output
plunged 0.8 percent in March as production slumped
all across the economy.
That development came as the Ford Motor Co.,
trying to staunch mounting Kisses, announced it will
close its assembly plant in Wahwah, N.J., and lav off a
total of 15.000 more employees nationwide, bringing
layoffs in the auto industry to about 250,000.
In another basic industry, meanwhile, the United
Steelworkers union ratified a new contract that offi
cials say could boost the industry's labor costs by at
least a third over the next three years.
It was not immediately clear whether the pact viol
ated the Carter administration's 7.5 to 9.5 percent
per-year anti-inflation wage guideline, and White
House officials declined to comment on the settle
ment pending complex calculations.
Major steel companies currently are pressing for
new import restrictions in large part on grounds that
their labor costs are so high that they cannot compete
against foreign producers.
In other economic news yesterday,-the Commerce
Department issued revised figures showing the pro
fits of American corporations declined more sharply
than expected late last year after adjustment for infla
tion, with only the oil industry show ingimprovement.
The developments added substantially to earlier
indications that the recession is gathering momen
tum. The housing industry has been in a slump for
weeks, retail sales are falling v isihl> and joblessness is
on the rise.
Treasury Secretary G. William Miller told repor
ters that "the signs are that we have a slowdown, and
this time it appears to be more confirmed across the
board." Miller continued to predict, however that the
recession would be mild.
The report on industrial production showed the
■slump in the nation's factory output became far more
pervasive in March than it was in previous months.
However, while previous declines were concen
trated primarily in the auto industry. last month's
sharp drop was felt in virtually every sector of the
economy. with production of consumer goods down a
hefty O.N percent.
The nation's industrial output now stands at a level
1.2 percent below that of a year ago. The 0.2 percent
decline reported yesterday for February originally
was estimated as a 0.2 percent rise.
West pledges aid to Turkey
WASHINGTON — With West Germany and the
I nited States leading the way. the major Western
nations yesterday pledged a total of $1.16 billion in
emergency aid to rescue Turkey from threatened
economic and political collapse.
l urkey has been plagued by 20 percent un
employment. SO percent inflation, lack of hard cur
rency to pay for oil imports and a wave of political
violence that prompted Prime Minister Suleyman
Demirel two months ago to appeal for aid. "If we fail
to obtain Western support we may become another
Afghanistan," he said at the time.
I lie scope of Western aid package now being put
together reflects a major effort to strengthen the
strategic country on NATO's southern flank in the
wake of regional turmoil generated by Iran develop
ments and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Yesterdays joint action demonstrated a firm allied
support for Demirel's stabilization program and
brought the aid figure close to the level required to set
I urkey on a recovery course.
1 urkey has already received $220 million from the
International Monetary Fund.
U.S. officials here said that the governmental aid
package was expected to encourage private bank
loans to Turkey. They also indicated that the United
States and other Western allies would try to re
schedule Turkish debts in a move that would bring
the total worth of Western aid to well over $2 billion.
Demirel said in February that Turkey needed
about $2 billion in emergency aid this year to revive

Turkey's "dying economy" and prevent social and
economic unrest "from which only Communists
would benefit."
The United States and West Germany made the
largest pledges, $295 million each. Italy pledged
$115 million; France, Japan and the European
Community $100 million each; other contributors
include Britain. Switzerland, Canada and the Nether
lands.
But it is still unclear whehter Demirel would be
able to turn the economy around. In an effort to
revive it. Demirel advanced a series of reform prop
osals aimed at strengthening a market economy, at
tracting foreign investments, denationalizing mines,
encouraging exports and cutting the benefits enjoyed
by state-owned firms with monopolies on both im
ports and sales.
Court extends arrest warrant use
WASHINGTON — In a sweeping and surprising
extension of Fourth Amendment protections, the
Supreme Court ruled 6-3 yesterday that police gen
erally may not enter an individual's house to arrest
him without first obtaining a warrant.
Citing the nation's"overriding respect for the sanc
tity of the home." the high court struck down a New
York law that had permitted police to enter a resi
dence without a warrant, using force where neces
sary. to make routine felony arrests.
The decision means that, from now on. police must
follow the same procedures in arresting a person at
home that they employ in searching a home. In both
cases, police ordinarily must first ask a court or magis
trate for a warrant, which they may obtain only by
showing that they have probable cause to believe the
law is being broken.
The only exception to the warrant requirement is
for special, emergency circumstances —such as when
police have indications that a suspect is suddenly
about to flee or destroy evidence, or w hen they must
act quickly to prevent someone from being harmed.
The three dissenters — Justices Byron White and
William Rehnquist and Chief Justice Warren Burger
— predicted that the new ruling will make life harder
for law-enforcement officials.
"The policeman on his beat must now make subtle
discriminations that perplex even judges in their
chambers," White wrote.
The six-member majority said it viewed these
claims "with skepticism" — and that, in any event,
these practical and policy considerations must give
way to the "constitutional command" of the Fourth
Amendment.
Over the past few years, the Burger Court has been
accused of narrowing the scope of the Fourth
Amendment through a series of decisions authorizing
police to make searches or arrests in a variety of
circumstances. Yesterday's ruling was a major step in
the opposite direction.
In a second criminal-law ruling yesterday, the high
court decided S-1 that a judge may sometimes impose
a stiffer sentence on a convicted person because he
refuses to cooperate with prosecutors.
But. in a narrow and carefully-worded decision,
the court made it clear that a criminal defendant
cannot be penalized for refusing to cooperate with
the government if he is shown to be acting out of a
desire to avoid incriminating himself.
The ruling makes no dramatic changes in the crim
inal law.
Carter seeks $17,000 tax refund
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter,
whose net worth slipped under $ I million in 1979. is
seeking an income tax refund from the federal gov
ernment of nearly $17,000, the White House dis
closed yesterday.
The president and his wife dropped out of the ranks
of the nation's millionaires in 1979. according to
documents made public on the day Americans were
required to send in their income tax statements to the
Internal Revenue Service.
The documents showed assets of $1,054,178.95

and liabilities of $160,874.60. Thus, the Carters' net
worth was $893,304.35.
Their total tax hill was $64, t >44.8 1, on an adjusted
income of $193,823.77.
The tax figures were spread over 1 0 separate forms
and included such figures as a $15.53 deduction for
postage and the president's $200,000 annual salary
from the U.S. Treasury.
Brown's name remains on ballot
SACRAMENTO — A Sacramento judge refused
yesterday to remove Gov. Jerry Brown's name from
California's June 3 presidential primary ballot.
Brown had asked the court in a writ filed earlier
yesterday to take his name off the Democratic prim
ary ballot on grounds that it would confuse voters to
see his name listed after he had withdrawn from the
race.
Superior Court Judge Fred Marler said he believed
he had authority to delete Brown's name if the gover
nor's petition had been received in a '•timely" man
ner.
But, Marler noted, several counties have already
begun printing ballots. The judge said deleting
Brown's name now would be a costly "disruption of
the elective process (which) far outweighs any confu
sion that might be caused" b\ Brown's name remain
ing on the ballot.
The ruling means that the Democratic ballot will
have the names of President Jimmy Carter. Sen. Ed

Brown's name remains on ballot
SACRAMENTO — A Sacramento judge refused
yesterday to remove Gov. Jerry Brown's name from
California's June 3 presidential primary ballot.
Brown had asked the court in a writ filed earlier
yesterday to take his name off the Democratic prim
ary ballot on grounds that it would confuse voters to
see his name listed after he had withdrawn from the
race.
Superior Court Judge Fred Marler said he believed
he had authority to delete Brown's name if the gover
nor's petition had been received in a '•timely" man
ner.
But, Marler noted, several counties have already
begun printing ballots. The judge said deleting
Brown's name now would be a costly "disruption of
the elective process (which) far outweighs any confu
sion that might be caused" b\ Brown's name remain
ing on the ballot.
The ruling means that the Democratic ballot will
have the names of President Jimmy Carter. Sen. Ed
ward Kennedy of Massachusetts, Lyndon Laßouche,
Brown and Unpledged Delegation for presidential
convention delegates.
Brown withdrew from the presidential campaign
April 1, after finishing third in Wiscomsin's primary.
Thermostats must stay at 78
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter, act
ing only hours before the program was to expire,
signed a proclamation yesterday extending for nine
months the mandatory temperature controls for 2.8
million offices, shops and other non-residential build
ings.
Carter's action means Americanscan look forward
to another hot summer with required thermostat set
tings of 78 degrees. The program imposes 65 degree
limits on heating in the winter.
In addition to extending the program, authorized
by Congress last year to meet energy emergencies.
Carter will ask Congress for legislation to make the
thermostat settings a permanent fixture of American
life just like the 55 mph speed limit, administration
officials said.
Earlier yesterday Deputy Energy Secretary John
Sawhill told a congressional committee and reporters
at a press conference that Carter planned to sign the
proclamation because he had determined the prog
ram, which was due to expire at midnight yesterday,
had "worked and worked well."
The program had been the subject of an intense
debate among administration attorneys. Some ar
gued that the law only allowed imposition of the
temperature controls if the president made a finding
of a "severe energy supply interruption," such as he
did in imposing the controls last July 16 in the midest
of long gasoline lines in many parts of the country.
Sawhill put the savings since Carter imposed the
controls at 30 million barrels of oil. The United States
saved $1 billion in energy compared to a cost of
administering the program of $8 million, he said.
Critics have charged that despite Carter's assur
ances that the controls would be strictly enforced,
there have been no fines imposed for non-compliance
and the Energy Department provided only 10 federal
inspectors to conduct building audits.
