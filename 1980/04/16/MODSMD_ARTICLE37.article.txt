From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Joel Shurkin, a professional jour
nalism fellow here, was a lead writer of
a Philadelphia Inquirer series on the
Three Mile Island accident which won
a Pulitzer Prize for local reporting
Monday.
Shurkin was one of 80 Philadelphia
Inquirer staff writers who at some point
worked on the award-winning series
last year. He is now on a one-year leave
from the newspaper to study at the
University.
"Ouite frankly, yes, 1 did expect it,"
Shurkin said last night.After the nuc
lear power plant accident last year,
Shurkin was dispatched to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission in
Middletown, Penn. He and another
writer stationed in Washington, D.C.
regularly called in the latest informa
tion to the Philadelphia Inquirer office
where a third writer composed the
main story.
The three writers usually received a
triple byline on most their stories,
Shurkin said.
The Pulitzer was the sixth straight
one for the Inquirer staff. Other
Pulitzer winners with University ties
included Donald Rodney Justice, a
former graduate student and teaching
assistant here, and Douglas Hofstad
ter, son of University Prof. Robert
Hofstater.a Nobel Laureate in physics.
Justice, who studied here in the
19405, is now a professor at the Uni
versity of lowa. His anthology entitled
Selected Poems won the Pulitzer Prize
for poetry.
Hofstater's Godel, Escher, Bach: An
Eternal Golden Braid won the prize for
general non-fiction. His work has been
described as a "work of mathematical
philosophy."
The Pulitzer Prize for fiction went to
Norman Mailer for The Executioner's
Song, the story of Utah convice Gary
Gilmore and his execution by a firing
squad.
The author had won in 1969 in the
non-fiction category for Armies of the
Night.
Mailer and his publisher called the
Gilmore book a work of fiction, but
many critics considered it non-fiction
since it tells the story of real people
involved in real events.
Talley's Folly, Lanford Wilson's
romantic comedy about a Jewish ac
countant from St. Louis, won the prize
for drama.
In journalism, the Gannett News
Service won the gold medal for
meritorious public service for an
18-day series of articles on the Pauline
Fathers, an order of Catholic priests,
and their mismanagement of gifts and
contributions intended to finance a
shrine.
Individuals cited in that award were
John Hanchette, of Gannett's
Washington bureau; William Schmick,
state editor of Gannett; and Carlton
Sherwood, of Gannett's national staff.
All three are themselves Roman
Catholics.
Don Wright of the Miami News won
his second Pulitzer for editorial car
tooning. His 1979 portfolio had among
its targets Ayatollah Khomeini, the
death penalty and Three Mile Island.
He won previously in 1966.
Three Mile Island also played a role
in Ellen Goodman's prize for commen

tary. Her Boston Globe column regard
ing social values and appearing in 200
newspapers dealt during the year with
the nuclear accident, as well as with
such subjects as medical ethics, Iran
and birth control.
The name of the winner of the spot
news photography award was kept sec
ret. The picture, submitted in the con
test by United Press International,
showed a government firing squad
executing nine Kurdish rebels and two
former police officers following the fall
of the shah of Iran. The Associated
Press had distributed the same picture
when it was taken.
"Because of the present unrest in
Iran, the name of the photographer
cannot be revealed at this time," UPI
explained.
The Pulitzer prizes were founded by
the late Joseph Pulitzer, publisher of
the old New York World. They have
been awarded since 1917 by Columbia
University on recommendation of an
advisory board.
Except for the gold medal in the
category of meritorious public service
by a newspaper, each award carries a
prize of $1000.
In the field of history, the 1980 win
ner was Leon Litwack, professorof his
tory at UC-Berkeley, for Been in the
Storm So Long, a study of the end of
slavery from a slave's point of view.
The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, the
first full history of the pre-presidential
career of the nation's 26th chief execu
tive, won the Pulitzer Prize in biog
raphy for Edmund Morris, a Kenya
born, British-educated American citi
zen.
