# Assembly delays minority enrollment legislation
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services with staff reports
A bill that would provide $2 million to the Univer
sity in compensation for minority enrollment projects
was stalled in the State Assembly Monday.
However, officials here said they were confident
the bill would pass within two weeks.
An Assembly decision to cut out $175,000 from
the $7.8 million claims bills caused the stall. The
money was to have gone to seven former state college
professors fired for refusing to sign loyalty oaths dur
ing the McCarthy era of the 19505.
The proposed $25,000 payments for the seven
former teachers has caused the otherwise routine
claims bill to be defeated in a series of votes on the

Assembly floor.
But Bob Freelen, acting vice president for public
affairs, said the rest of the bill is likely to pass, proba
bly within the next 10 days.
The bulk of the bill is $5 million for University of
Southern California and $2 million for the Univer
sity,
After a complicated string of parliamentary man
euvers Monday, the Assembly voted 49-20 to amend
the bill, SB 1252 by Sen. Albert Rodda, CD-
Sacramento) to remove the $175,000.
That amount was compensation for six teachers, or
their heirs, fired for refusing to take the Levering
Oath, and a seventh fired for refusing to answer ques

tions about the Communist Party. The Levering
Oath, which later was declared unconstitutional, re
quired state employees to swear they had never be
longed to Communist organizations.
The $175,000 was in the bill when it was intro
duced last Spetember. but the Senate removed it
before passing the bill. The Assembly Ways and
Means Committee restored the $175,000, but the
entire Assembly rejected the bill twice, 40-27 on
March 24 and 40-33 last Monday.
No final vote was taken Monday on the amended
bill, because Assemblyman Richard Robinson, (D-
Santa Ana) asked for a second vote on the amend
ments on another day.
