# Existentialist Sartre dead at 74
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services with staff reports
Jean-Paul Sartre, whose existential view of
man as the maker of his destiny placed him among the giants
of modern philosophy, died yesterday after a month-long
illness.
The 74-year-old French writer-philosopher died at
Broussais Hospital in Paris, surrounded by a few friends,
said one of those present, Liliane Siegel, author of a book
on his life.
Sartre was admitted to Broussais March 19 for treatment
of pulmonary edema, an accumulation of fluid in the lungs
that hampered his breathing. He died shortly after 9 p.m.,
11 a.m. P.S.T.
The iconoclastic Sartre was awarded the Nobel Prize for
Literature in 1964, but refused to accept the prestigious
prize to mark his contempt for what he called bourgeois
honors.
Nearly blind in the last decade of his life, Sartre had
virtually given up the writing that had made him legendary
as an impassioned, though often ineffectual, defender of
justice as he saw it.
Reaction to Sartre's death
Philosophy Prof. Dagfinn Follesdal, whose area of in
terest is phenomenology, the same school to which Sartre
belonged, and who has been working on a critical volume on
Sartre's work, commented that the blow of Sartre's death is
softened by the fact that Sartre has been unable to work
during his last years.
"Blindness had been more of a handicap for him since he
was unable to even dictate," said Follesdal. "He had to see
what he was producing. His last years were very frustrating
to himself."
Follesdal said that Sartre and Willard Van Orman Quine

have been the most written-about philosophers. Sartre did
live to see a decline in his influence, Follesdal said, but that
is not something that Sartre should be blamed for. "In
French philosophy there are fashions and Sartre had simply
gone out of fashion."
Sartre's writings expounded the theory of man as a re
sponsible but lonely being, burdened with the terrifying
freedom of choice — the only freedom worth fighting for,
he often said.
Sartre first gave his definition of existentialism in L'Etre
et le Neant (Being and Nothingness), published in 1943
during the German occupation of France. The Roman
Catholic Church denounced it as a rejection of God, and the
French Communist Party condemned it as a "bourgeois
ethic" intended to distract workers from the class struggle.
Sartre himself complained he was widely misunderstood.
His doctrine held that only man's commitment to a cause,
his conscious participation, makes him different from ani
mals or inanimate objects. He argued that man by himself is
nothing, a creature without soul or meaning, and the only
freedom worth fighting for is the freedom of choice.
Opposed wars
He vehemently opposed the French war in Algeria in the
1950s and the American war in Vietnam. He gave his
prestige to such causes as Lord Bertrand Russell's "War
Crimes Tribunal" during the Vietnam war and the
Baader-Meinhof urban guerrilla movement in West Ger
many in the 1960s and 19705.
Sartre was born in Paris on June 21,1905. His father was
a naval officer and his mother, born Anne-Marie
Schweitzer, was a niece of the philosopher, musician and
jungle doctor Albert Schweitzer, who won the Nobel Peace
Prize in 1952.
