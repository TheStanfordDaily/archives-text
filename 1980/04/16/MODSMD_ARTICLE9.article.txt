# Hmong refugees to start settlement in Guyana
##

WASHINGTON
Thousands of Hmong refugees,
members of a remarkable Lao
tian hill tribe sent wandering in
two decades of guerrilla warfare
on behalf of the CIA. may begin
traveling halfway around the
world next month in an effort to
establish a homeland in Guyana.
Tribal leaders and the South
American nation's government
tentatively have agreed that the
refugees. who have subsisted for
years in isolated camps in Thai
land. will establish a self
sufficient community in a remote
jungle region about 20 miles
from the site of Jonestown. The
massive resettlement will be
sponsored and financed by a
consortium of fundamentalist
Christian organizations in the
United States and Netherlands.
It is an extraordinary proposal
that poses extraordinary prob
lems. however, and not everyone
is convinced it will work. Offi
cials of the U.S. State Depart
ment. which is not formally in
volved but is monitoring the

proposal, privately expressed
skepticism that Guyana would
agree to accept such a large
number of a new ethnic minority.
Relief agency officials expres
sed concern that the Hmong not
be abandoned in a strange new
land without adequate, longterm
support. And several Hmong
leaders already resettled in the
United States said the tribesmen
they left behind, many of whom
fought for the CIA in its "secret
war" in Laos against the North
Vietnamese in the 19605, would
rather join them in the land of
their former allies.
"We cannot return to Laos."
said jHang Sao, 40. who was re
settled in Seattle in 1978 with his
wife and four children. Now
working as a counselor for other
resettled refugees, he uas one of
three representatives elected by
the Hmong at the Thai camp of
Ban Vinai to scout the proposed
site. The other two still live at the
camp.
"Many young people wish to
come to the United States, but
they are rejected by the Immig
ration (Immigration and

Naturalization Service)," he
said.
"About Guyana. I cannot say
good or bad. but if the Hmong
can live together and have good
support, good tools to build their
lives there, then 1 think maybe it
is OK."
Considering the choices, he
said. Guyana may be their best
hope. About 35.000 Hmong still
at Ban Vinai are expected to de
cide this week whether to accept
the proposal. The three tribal
leaders who visited the site last
month reportedly have recom
mended approval if the Guyana
government will agree to admit
at least 10,000 Hmong. A
spokesman for the government,
which last week agreed to accept
an initial group of 1500 with
more admissions contingent on
the success of the first group, said
the Cabinet would consider the
larger number.
The Hmong — the name
means "free men" — were
known as fiercely independent
people in the hills of Laos. The
lowland Lao who dominated the
country sometimes ridiculed

them as bumpkins who had no
written language and wore pecul
iar clothing, hut the Hmong also
were noted as good soldiers.
In the early 19605, when the
United States wanted to stall
North Vietnamese troops in
Laos but was prohibited by in
ternational agreement from
sending its own troops, the Cent
ral Intelligence Agency enlisted
the Hmong as surrogate soldiers
in its "secret war." By the time
the United States withdrew from
the region in 1975. an estimated
10.000 of Laos' 350.000 Hmong
had been killed in action.
'Hie end of the Vietnam War
did not bring peace for the Lao
tian survivors. In the last five
years, the Pathet Lao. the new
Communist government backed
by Hanoi, has destroyed their
mountain villages in Phou Bia
province with artillery barrages.
Some refugees have reported
that poison gas — they call it
"the yellow rain"-— has also
been used against them,
So thousands of Hmong, some
still carrying American-issued
weapons, began to make their
way through the mountains and
across the Mekong River into
Thailand. Relief officials have
estimated that one-third died
from hunger or warfare on the
way. and at the river Thai milit
ary sometimes forced them back
to Laos at gunpoint. Thailand
remains ambivalent about shel
tering the refugees from Laos
and Cambodia who come across
its borders. But United Nations'
refugee camps in Thailand now
house 69,000 Laotian hill
people, most of them Hmong.
Another 5000 arrive each
month.
The Hmong have been — and
remain — among the forgotten
refugees of Indochina despite
their suffering and despite the
U.S. role in causing their plight.
Television film of drowning Viet
namese "boat people" and. la
ter. of starving Cambodians has
prompted international outrage
and help. But the Hmong have
stayed for years in isolated
camps without adequate water,
food or medicine.
About 22,300 Hmong have
been resettled in the United
States, more than half of them
arriving last year. There are
fledgling Hmong communities in
Santa Ana, Calif.,'and Missoula,

Mont. Some have encountered
great difficulty adjusting, how
ever, because their new life is in
such stark contrast to their own
primitive culture.
Now there are not enough
existing resettlement slots in
western countries for the rest of
the Hmong refugees. There is
growing resistance in the United
States and elsewhere to con
tinued admission of large num
bers of Indochinese. They can
not return to Laos. And they
cannot remain indefinitely in
Thailand.
Representatives of World Re
lief and World Medical Missions
were in Thailand about a year
ago when someone suggested es
tablishing a refugee community
in an undeveloped country. The
two agencies and several other
fundamentalist Christian groups,
including the Billy Graham
Evangelistic Association and
two Dutch organizations,
formed the Christian Refugee
Team International and set out
to find 200 square miles of suita
ble land available for settlement.
Guyana, a country the size of
Kansas that has a socialist gov
ernment. has for years en
courged outsiders backed by suf
ficient funds to settle in the in
terior. It is a sort of homestcad
ing policy that exchanged virtu
ally free land for capital de
velopment. The Peoples Temple
commune at Jonestown, where
more than 900 followers of the
Rev. Jim Jones died in
November 197K, was one of sev
eral religious and other organiza
tions that took advantage of the
program.
In November, after months of
discussion, a formal proposal
was submitted to the govern
ment of Guyana for the Hmong
settlement. The Cabinet ap
proved the proposal in De
cember. Last month, consortium
leaders went to Guyana for the
final negotiations. With them
were an official of the U.N. High
Commission for Refugees, a
Thai government official and the
three Hmong tribal leaders.
The consortium has plans to
raise as much as $15 million to
support the still-unnamed set
tlement until it is self-sufficient
and grows its own food and cof
fee for export.
