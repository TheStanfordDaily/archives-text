# Butterfield et al. sweeps COP race
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
In a surprising turnaround from
Tuesday's low voter turnout, all I 5 fee
assessments passed easily in this week's
ASSU election.
Elected to Council of Presidents with
73 percent were Dick Butterfield.
Dayna Goldfine, Nancy Takahashi and
Marc Ventresca.
In the Senior Class Presidents race,
two slates will run off in the May b
election. The Frolic on the Farm slate
of Ina Coleman. Jamie Halper. Bill
Kemmeries and Mary Ellen Rielly cap
tured 30 percent of the vote, enabling
them to battle the BARB slate — Mark
Breier. Aleen Zimberoff, Renee
Richards and Jeff Hell for the leader
ship post. The BARB slate secured 27
percent of the vote.
Students overwhelmingly approved
a constitutional amendment that will
allow them to elect new ASSU
Senators May 6.
Mascot
Students also decided without ques
tion to select a mascot in June of 198 1.
The approved referendum binds stu
dents to adopt a mascot that procures
at least 60 percent of the vote next
spring.
"The only threat to fee assessments
was "no" votes." said Elections Com
missioner Doug Mitchell.
He said approximately 2SOO stu
dents voted in the two-day election,
with the majority voting yesterday.
Only 8 to 10 percent of the student
body voted Tuesday.
ASSU by-laws require at least 20

percent of the student body to vote for
each tee assessment so there was some
fear that none of the assessments would
pass.
"The easiest way to heat a fee as
sessment is not to vote, because they

don't get 20 percent that way," Mitch
ell said. "That's one of the quirks of the
system."
Kxtended voting
Early yesterday, Mitchell decided to
extend voting hours at two polling

places. Maples Pavilion, where varsity
tennis matches were held last night,
and Meyer Library. He said he was af
raid fee assessments wouldn't pass be
cause of low voter turnout.
But later he said the extension was
insignificant to the election.
"It was important in that it gave us
confidence," Mitchell said. "There's
no use in taking a chance if you don't
have to and we wanted to be sure to get
the 20 percent. It gave us 250 more
votes and we like to have as many as
possible."
No late trend
He said there was no significant
trend to the late votes.
Ihe election, which Mitchell said
"ran smooth as silk," cost a total of
$1755. In order to save money, the
run-off election for senior class presi
dents will be held concurrently with
spring ASSU Senate elections.
Mitchell said he expects that election
to be somewhat less expensive than this
one because the ballot will be smaller,
and there are no fee assessments re
quiring a certain percentage of voter
turn-out.
He also said the overseas phone bill
will not be as high. In this election.
Mitchell had to duplicate several phone
calls to notify overseas campuses that
the mascot referendum and the KZSU
fee assessment had been approved
after deadline.
The ASSU Senate voted last week to
include the mascot referendum tin the
ballot and KZSU failed to meet the
deadline for fee assessment. The senate

Takahashi and Marc Ventresca in the office of Council of Presidents.
made a special allowance that permit
ted the radio station to be placed on the
ballot.
Surprises
The biggest surprises in overseas vot
ing came out of the Florence campus.
Students there voted the slate of John
Lamb, Shelley McKinney. David Jaffe
and Barb Mullin into COP office and
selected the M&M slate of Mary Tan
ner, Mary Louise St. Geme, Milt
McColl and Mark Lerdal as senior class
presidents.
McColl is a student at the Florence
campus now.
ITie adopted election reform, a con
stitutional amendment, was designed
by an ASSU task force to provide more
continuity within the senate. Members
of the task force explained that with fall
elections, senate activity doesn't get
started until November and cannot be
considered productive until winter
quarter. Spring elections will allow the
new senators to meet several times be
fore summer, establish means of cor
respondence and establish individual
duties, making the senate a functioning
body from the onset of fall quarter.

Because spring senatorial elections
preclude freshman and transfer stu
dents from running, the task lorce
created 10 senate associate positions.
Indi\ iduals are selected lor these posi
tions by applica ion process tall quar
ter. They have all the rights and re
sponsibilities ol lull senators, except
the right to \ ote.
Senate associates
Task lorce members said creating
the senate associat positions would
also strengthen the senate because
some senate assocates would run lor
lull senate positions in the spring, alter
ha\ ingser\ ed a year's term an gaining
understanding ol how the body I unc
tions.
Mitch II said petitions t> run lor
ASSI enate this spring will be a\ all a -
ble 1 riday at the ASSI oil ce.
Students presently overseas who
want to run lor tlu senate next lall must
not y th elections commissioner at
their campus, who in turn, must notify
the elections commissioner here. In
addition, they must coniact triends on
the home campus to bt in candidate
petitions lor them, secure the 25 signa
tures necessary to run and resubmit
them helore the deadline to be deter
mined by the elections commissioners.

McColl and Mark Lerdal as senior class
presidents.
McColl is a student at the Florence
campus now.
ITie adopted election reform, a con
stitutional amendment, was designed
by an ASSU task force to provide more
continuity within the senate. Members
of the task force explained that with fall
elections, senate activity doesn't get
started until November and cannot be
considered productive until winter
quarter. Spring elections will allow the
new senators to meet several times be
fore summer, establish means of cor
respondence and establish individual
duties, making the senate a functioning
body from the onset of fall quarter.

Because spring senatorial elections
preclude freshman and transfer stu
dents from running, the task lorce
created 10 senate associate positions.
Indi\ iduals are selected lor these posi
tions by applica ion process tall quar
ter. They have all the rights and re
sponsibilities ol lull senators, except
the right to \ ote.
Senate associates
Task lorce members said creating
the senate associat positions would
also strengthen the senate because
some senate assocates would run lor
lull senate positions in the spring, alter
ha\ ingser\ ed a year's term an gaining
understanding ol how the body I unc
tions.
Mitch II said petitions t> run lor
ASSI enate this spring will be a\ all a -
ble 1 riday at the ASSI oil ce.
Students presently overseas who
want to run lor tlu senate next lall must
not y th elections commissioner at
their campus, who in turn, must notify
the elections commissioner here. In
addition, they must coniact triends on
the home campus to bt in candidate
petitions lor them, secure the 25 signa
tures necessary to run and resubmit
them helore the deadline to be deter
mined by the elections commissioners.
In a surprising turnaround from
Tuesday's low voter turnout, all I 5 fee
assessments passed easily in this week's
ASSU election.
Elected to Council of Presidents with
73 percent were Dick Butterfield.
Dayna Goldfine, Nancy Takahashi and
Marc Ventresca.
In the Senior Class Presidents race,
two slates will run off in the May b
election. The Frolic on the Farm slate
of Ina Coleman. Jamie Halper. Bill
Kemmeries and Mary Ellen Rielly cap
tured 30 percent of the vote, enabling
them to battle the BARB slate — Mark
Breier. Aleen Zimberoff, Renee
Richards and Jeff Hell for the leader
ship post. The BARB slate secured 27
percent of the vote.
Students overwhelmingly approved
a constitutional amendment that will
allow them to elect new ASSU
Senators May 6.
Mascot
Students also decided without ques
tion to select a mascot in June of 198 1.
The approved referendum binds stu
dents to adopt a mascot that procures
at least 60 percent of the vote next
spring.
"The only threat to fee assessments
was "no" votes." said Elections Com
missioner Doug Mitchell.
He said approximately 2SOO stu
dents voted in the two-day election,
with the majority voting yesterday.
Only 8 to 10 percent of the student
body voted Tuesday.
ASSU by-laws require at least 20

percent of the student body to vote for
each tee assessment so there was some
fear that none of the assessments would
pass.
"The easiest way to heat a fee as
sessment is not to vote, because they

don't get 20 percent that way," Mitch
ell said. "That's one of the quirks of the
system."
Kxtended voting
Early yesterday, Mitchell decided to
extend voting hours at two polling

places. Maples Pavilion, where varsity
tennis matches were held last night,
and Meyer Library. He said he was af
raid fee assessments wouldn't pass be
cause of low voter turnout.
But later he said the extension was
insignificant to the election.
"It was important in that it gave us
confidence," Mitchell said. "There's
no use in taking a chance if you don't
have to and we wanted to be sure to get
the 20 percent. It gave us 250 more
votes and we like to have as many as
possible."
No late trend
He said there was no significant
trend to the late votes.
Ihe election, which Mitchell said
"ran smooth as silk," cost a total of
$1755. In order to save money, the
run-off election for senior class presi
dents will be held concurrently with
spring ASSU Senate elections.
Mitchell said he expects that election
to be somewhat less expensive than this
one because the ballot will be smaller,
and there are no fee assessments re
quiring a certain percentage of voter
turn-out.
He also said the overseas phone bill
will not be as high. In this election.
Mitchell had to duplicate several phone
calls to notify overseas campuses that
the mascot referendum and the KZSU
fee assessment had been approved
after deadline.
The ASSU Senate voted last week to
include the mascot referendum tin the
ballot and KZSU failed to meet the
deadline for fee assessment. The senate

Surprises
The biggest surprises in overseas vot
ing came out of the Florence campus.
Students there voted the slate of John
Lamb, Shelley McKinney. David Jaffe
and Barb Mullin into COP office and
selected the M&M slate of Mary Tan
ner, Mary Louise St. Geme, Milt
McColl and Mark Lerdal as senior class
presidents.
