## 
### Carol Rose Staff Writer 
The major stumbling blocks to
modernization in China, namely
the downfall of education and
confusion among Chinese youth,
are a result of the Cultural Revolu
tion there, according to Dr. Lee
Fah Yih. who addressed an audi
ence of 60 here Tuesday.
Yih. an engineering professor

at Shanghai University, traced
the causes of the Cultural Re
volution to 1957.
"In that year, the success of
Communism made the leader
want credit reserved for him
self," he said. "He could not
trust those close to him."
He said the non-communist
intellectuals criticized the gov

ernment. resulting in over half a
million scholars being labeled
"rightists."
"As a result of this anti
rightist charter of 1957. these
people (rightists) were deprived
until last year to contribute to
political or social advancement
(in China)," he said.
But. it was the downfall of the
educational system that created

the greatest obstacle to moderni
zation, according to Yih.
"From 1957 to 1968 their sys
tem produced no educated
young people," he said. "Almost
all teachers were vague of the
knowledge and technical skills
required in the professions."
He said 90 percent of all pro
fessors and 60 percent of all
teachers were either un
employed or in labor camps be
cause they misinterpreted
Chairman Mao Tse Tung's
teachings. Students were not re
quired to take examinations
under Mao's philosophy, so they
had no incentive to study, Yih
said.
Another result of the Cultural
Revolution is the confusion
among youth, which also hinders
progress in modernization.
"A great many (youths) can
not distinguish between right
and wrong, justice and tyranny,"
Yih said. "Many young people in
China are bewildered. They are
told two different things and
both seem to be true because
they are told in two different
ways. For example, before 1972,
they were told that everything in
America is terrible. Today they
are told that everything in
America is simply beautiful.
What should they believe?"
Yih outlined four major com
ponents to the Chinese moderni

zation plan. He named agricul
tural expansion, national de
fense increases, industrialization
and increases in science and
technology as instrumental to
change.
But, the key, he said, "still lies
at the education of the young
people, to give the incentives to
work and pursue the future."
Yin predicted the Chinese
modernization plan would suc
ceed as a result of changes in the
country now.
"After 10 years of bitter ex
periences and a miserable life,
the majority of people in China
wish for a stable government and
a stable life, which is a prerequis
ite for modernization," Yih said.
"China is now revitalizing its
education system, and will soon
form a squad of two million men
and women educated in science
and technology."
He mentioned the abundant
natural resources in China which
may help lead to foreign support
through trade.
"Although the Cultural Revolu
tion was a catastrophe, it also left
a legacy because it has given us a
chance to distinguish our true
friends from our enemies," he
said. "We will never again lean
on the USSR. Your (United
States) investment will be
guaranteed. We cannot afford to
change our present moderniza
tion policy."
