WASHINGTON â€” President Jimmy Carter's
baclc-to-back summit talks with Egyptian Presi
dent Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin resulted in an agreement yester
day to hold non-stop negotiations in the Middle
East on the future of 1.2 million Palestinians.
The intensive negotiations are aimed at translat
ing Begin's 1979 promise of autonomy for Arabs
living under Israel's control into a council elected
by inhabitants of the West Bank of the Jordan
River and the Gaza district.
At a news conference. Begin said he could not
predict an agreement b\ May 26. the date set as a
goal by Egvpt and Israel. But he said the marathon
negotiations could be extended, noting that the two
countries took six months instead of the three
planned to wrap up their peace treaty last year.
Meanwhile, the prime minister said. "Why be
pessimistic in advance?"
So far, 10 rounds (if Egyptian-Israeli negotia
tions over more than 10 months have not cracked
any of the hard issues. They include the functions
of the council and the size of the Israeli security

force to remain for at least five years in the for
merly Arab-held territories.
There was no indication in Begin's remarks or in
a statement made by Carter in the White House
driveway that anything more than a procedural
agreement had been reached.
"We are delighted at the progress that has been
made." Carter said at the wind-up of his talks with
Begin.
"We have a long way to go before final agree
ment."
Begin indicated he had not budged from his view
that the council should have authority over munic
ipal affairs only.
He also said Israel would withdraw its military
and civil authorities but maintain security in the
Israeli-held territories.
"Hundreds of thousands of people would be kil
led if we are not responsible for security on the
West Bank and in Gaza." Begin said.
Sadat has demanded legislative and executive
powers for the Palestinian council and a limited
Israeli presence. E:gyptian officials have floated the
idea of mixed Egyptian-Israeli patrols or a multina
tional force to keep the peace.
