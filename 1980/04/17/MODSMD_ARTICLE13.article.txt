### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
A political solution to the
Palestinian problem is a pre
requisite to 112 ulfillment of Ameri
can strategic goals in the Middle
East, said Joel Migdal. associate
professor at the Harvard Center
for International Affairs, Mon
day night.
While such a solution would
only be partially satisfactory to
Palestinians, "it's better than no
thing. which is what they have
now, and it's the only possible
solution," said the author of
Palestinian Society and Politics,
in an address delivered to 100
persons in Meyer Form Room.
As the keynote speaker for
Palestinian Awareness Week.
Migdal. an American Jew. said
that"in order for the U.S. to
achieve its goal of an anti-Soviet
alliance in the Mideast, it must
ensure stable democracies in the
area.
"Israel is seen as an important
bulwark which must become an

accepted, functioning entity." he
said. It is in the interest of the
U.S. "to encourage those on
both sides who are willing to ac
cept less than a full loaf to
negotiate a partial resolution."
he said.
On the Palestinian side, the
major problem is that old and
new cleavages within its society
and the Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) have re
sulted in political immobilism,
rendering clear-cut initiatives
highly risky, he said.
Reinforcing that immobilism
are conflicting American signals
which create uncertainty. Calling
for a consistent policy, he said
the U.S. should decide whether
or not to stick to the Camp David
framework. If so. he recom
mended that the U.S. bypass the
PLO and try to nurture the exist
ing West Bank leadership, as
well as moderates within Fateh
(the major group in the PLO)
towards negotiations.
"The U.S. can try to change
environmental conditions, mak
ing immobilism less attractive
and increasing the anticipation
of higher benefits to a resolu
tion," he said.
Cleavages within Palestinian
society predate the formation of
Israel, but were intensified by it.
he said. After 194K, they were
divided into three groups: 10
percent remained in coastal
areas, becoming Israeli citizens;
one-third stayed on their lands in
the West Bank annexed by Jor
dan and over one-half became
refugees, mostly in the West
Bank.
After Israel took the West
Bank, Gaza and the Golan
Heights in 1967. it attempted to
minimize resistance by bettering
conditions.
"Unexpectedly, the more that
economic conditions improved,
the more that Palestinian
nationalism grew," said Migdal.
"While all Palestinians are un
ited in their opposition to Israeli
rule, their perspectives differ
based on the new cleavages," he
said.
The traditional (non-refugee)
West Bankers say they feel both
a national and personal shame,
wanting "to end both occupation
and economic relations," accord
ing to Migdal. Least powerful,
West Bank refugees combine na
tional shame with enhanced
economic position due to high
wages in Israel; they are afraid of
closing economic bridges. Israeli
Arabs feel "they are living in a
state which is alien to them." and

those outside historic Palestine
are also divided, he said.
He said nearly all Palestinians
agree that the PLO is their rep
resentative body, hut because it
operates in Lebanon, "it lacks
the institutional ties to.most ofits
people, resulting in fac
tionalism."
Furthermore, as the control
lingforce in Lebanon,"Syria dic
tates the boundaries of PLO pol
icy," he said.
Migdal said that no full solu
tion is possible, suggesting that
most of the 20 percent outside
Palestine would be left out in a
potential settlement, but that
they might not want to return
anyway. He envisioned a sepa
rate state which would eventu
ally reach stability after years of
turmoil, adding that the danger
of Soviet penetration is not
great.
Describing Migdals's ap
proach as "useful but in
adequate," Tuesday's speaker.
Rev. Don Wagner, said "Pales
tinians. by hirth and by history,
are victimized and denied their
human rights." He spoke to 25
persons in the Meyer Forum
Room.
As a member of the national
executive committee of the
Palestine Human Rights Cam
paign. he called President Car
ter's human rights doctrine
"selective, biased and expe
dient." because it glosses over
violations of allies like Israel
while concentrating on "a hand
ful of Soviet dissidents." '
Since 1968, the U.S. has re
mained outside a growing inter
national consensus, including the
United Nations, critical of Israeli
policies. The UN has demanded
the right of expelled Palestinians
to return, compensation for
property destroyed or confis
cated, and the halting of torture,
detentions without trials, har
rassment of intellectuals and set
tlements in occupied territories,
he said.
"The U.S. has granted $16
billion of military and economic
aid to Israel since 1973. That's
$7500 for every family of five, as
compared to under $2 we give to
families in Africa," he said. This
aid cuts into vital domestic prog
rams, he said.
"We are being denied the right
to hear from those who are vic
timized." he said, mentioning
two West Bank mayors who
were invited to speak in the Bay
area, hut were prevented by Is
rael from leaving.
