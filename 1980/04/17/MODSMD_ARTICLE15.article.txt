# Group brings culture to the Farm

### Laine Ericson Staff Writer 
Their logo is a "piggy" listen
ing contentedly to a
gramophone, their membership
is booming, and their many ac
complishments include a faculty
talent show that will have Politi
cal Science Prof. David Aber
nathy reading Winnie the Pooli.
The name of this ambitious
group is STARTS, an acronym
for Student Arts at Stanford.
However, explained Program
Adviser Lisa Verhovek,
"STARTS is not just an art
board. Wc are here to bring cul
turally, educationally and so
cially stimulating events to the
community."
Program Director Jean Martin
also emphasized another impor
tant objective of the group by
adding, "STARTS is providing
the student here with a chance to
be a part of a small group, where
people are working together in
an open, non-competitive way."
Although the title, logo and
many of its 55 members have
been acquired within the past
year, the student group has
existed in one form or another
for several years. In the early
19605, when Tresidder Union
was built, there was a strong
built-in program with a director
and an array of projects, such as
a Jazz Year. Martin said.
Hard times
However, the Union fell upon
hard times, and when Martin
came to the University in 1969.
such events were a thing of the
past. With then-student adviser

Roger Thacker, who had a
strong interest in music, Martin,
the fine arts buff, began plan
ning, and in 1974, the three
member Tresidder Program
Board was born.
Over the years, participation
on that board increased and last
summer the group acquired the
name STARTS and decided
upon the "piggy" logo with the
help of artist Barbara Mendel
son.
Chairperson Harmon Wang
attributed the recent increase in
membership of the Tresidder
Board to the fact that "until now
the Union has mostly em
phasized services," and cited his
belief that "we are on the verge
of students working on activities
for themselves."
Sensitivity
STARTS attempts to provide
these activities by "trying to be
really sensitive," according to
Verhovek. She said she feels that
the local community is not lack
ing in very many areas, and that
real thought is necessary to de
velop valuable additions.
The series of Late Night Quic
kies, which STARTS co
sponsors with the Senior Class, is
a product of this philosophy. It
emphasizes the STARTS aim of
a program "geared to action,"
she said. Recent events of the
Tuesday night programs have in
cluded beer tasting, massage
workshop, and a stargazing out
ing.
Verhovek also emphasized the
often serious intent of STARTS
programs, citing the upcoming

series of Thursday night lectures
by health experts, which will in
clude discussions of stress and
social support.
"There's pressure around
here. We're trying to fill a real
need," Martin said.
Christmas Faire
ST ARTS finances its under
takings primarily through the
Christmas Faire. Verhovek'sand
Martin's full-time salaries are
funded by the University.
Martin explained the evolu
tion of the Christmas Faire.. The
group "hit upon the idea of a
great holiday event."and im
ported 70 craftsmen from the
Town and Country Shopping
Center on El Camino. ,
In contrast, the 1979 Faire
featured 89 crafts exhibits
selected from 700 applicants.
STARTS garnered a net profit of
$12,000 from the event. Martin
has already received 40 applica
tions for the 1980 Faire.
In order to provide what Wang
referred to as an "overlap"
period of new and graduating
members, STARTS begins re
cruitment for new members at
the end of winter quarter. Wang
explained that applicants are in
terviewed in a "get acquainted"
rather than "screening" process,
and that new members join the
group spring quarter for an
"orientation" period.
Non-competitive
In keeping with the "non
competitive" atmosphere de
scribed earlier by Martin, Wang
noted that he would like to oper
ate in one "big communal

group." However, increased
membership has necessitated a
more structured format this year,
and the group is now organized
into six specialized committees,
each headed by a chairperson.
However, mentioned Ver
hovek, the entire group did
gather early in the year to
"brainstorm" and to set some
goals. Student input is strong,
claimed Martin, owing to the
suggestions of members and
those of their friends. The con
tribution of ideas from both fa
culty members and people out
side of the local community is
also frequent, providing for a di
versified calendar of STARTS
events.
Verhovek and Martin also said
they are looking forward to
working closely with the new
ASSU management of the Cof
fee House and with Servoma
tion, the new manager of Encina
Station. Declared Martin, "We
will be able to triple our prog
ram. Everything is burgeoning.
We're on the edge. Everything is
starting to break."

Verhovek and Martin also said
they are looking forward to
working closely with the new
ASSU management of the Cof

We're on the edge. Everything is

The Eric Vaughn Trio was one group STAR TS brought to campus this year. Ihe trio
performed at Tresidder Union during a lunch hour in February.
Their logo is a "piggy" listen
ing contentedly to a
gramophone, their membership
is booming, and their many ac
complishments include a faculty
talent show that will have Politi
cal Science Prof. David Aber
nathy reading Winnie the Pooli.
The name of this ambitious
group is STARTS, an acronym
for Student Arts at Stanford.
However, explained Program
Adviser Lisa Verhovek,
"STARTS is not just an art
board. Wc are here to bring cul
turally, educationally and so
cially stimulating events to the
community."
Program Director Jean Martin
also emphasized another impor
tant objective of the group by
adding, "STARTS is providing
the student here with a chance to
be a part of a small group, where
people are working together in
an open, non-competitive way."
Although the title, logo and
many of its 55 members have
been acquired within the past
year, the student group has
existed in one form or another
for several years. In the early
19605, when Tresidder Union
was built, there was a strong
built-in program with a director
and an array of projects, such as
a Jazz Year. Martin said.
Hard times
However, the Union fell upon
hard times, and when Martin
came to the University in 1969.
such events were a thing of the
past. With then-student adviser

Roger Thacker, who had a
strong interest in music, Martin,
the fine arts buff, began plan
ning, and in 1974, the three
member Tresidder Program
Board was born.
Over the years, participation
on that board increased and last
summer the group acquired the
name STARTS and decided
upon the "piggy" logo with the
help of artist Barbara Mendel
son.
Chairperson Harmon Wang
attributed the recent increase in
membership of the Tresidder
Board to the fact that "until now
the Union has mostly em
phasized services," and cited his
belief that "we are on the verge
of students working on activities
for themselves."
Sensitivity
STARTS attempts to provide
these activities by "trying to be
really sensitive," according to
Verhovek. She said she feels that
the local community is not lack
ing in very many areas, and that
real thought is necessary to de
velop valuable additions.
The series of Late Night Quic
kies, which STARTS co
sponsors with the Senior Class, is
a product of this philosophy. It
emphasizes the STARTS aim of
a program "geared to action,"
she said. Recent events of the
Tuesday night programs have in
cluded beer tasting, massage
workshop, and a stargazing out
ing.
Verhovek also emphasized the
often serious intent of STARTS
programs, citing the upcoming

series of Thursday night lectures
by health experts, which will in
clude discussions of stress and
social support.
"There's pressure around
here. We're trying to fill a real
need," Martin said.
Christmas Faire
ST ARTS finances its under
takings primarily through the
Christmas Faire. Verhovek'sand
Martin's full-time salaries are
funded by the University.
Martin explained the evolu
tion of the Christmas Faire.. The
group "hit upon the idea of a
great holiday event."and im
ported 70 craftsmen from the
Town and Country Shopping
Center on El Camino. ,
In contrast, the 1979 Faire
featured 89 crafts exhibits
selected from 700 applicants.
STARTS garnered a net profit of
$12,000 from the event. Martin
has already received 40 applica
tions for the 1980 Faire.
In order to provide what Wang
referred to as an "overlap"
period of new and graduating
members, STARTS begins re
cruitment for new members at
the end of winter quarter. Wang
explained that applicants are in
terviewed in a "get acquainted"
rather than "screening" process,
and that new members join the
group spring quarter for an
"orientation" period.
Non-competitive
In keeping with the "non
competitive" atmosphere de
scribed earlier by Martin, Wang
noted that he would like to oper
ate in one "big communal

group." However, increased
membership has necessitated a
more structured format this year,
and the group is now organized
into six specialized committees,
each headed by a chairperson.
However, mentioned Ver
hovek, the entire group did
gather early in the year to
"brainstorm" and to set some
goals. Student input is strong,
claimed Martin, owing to the
suggestions of members and
those of their friends. The con
tribution of ideas from both fa
culty members and people out
side of the local community is
also frequent, providing for a di
versified calendar of STARTS
events.
