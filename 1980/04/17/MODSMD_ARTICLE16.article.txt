WASHINGTON— 111 eState
of California is asking Congress
to reject the Carter administra
tion's proposed schedule for sel
ling oil and gas leases off the
West Coast, saying it per
petuates a "colonial" attitude by
the federal government toward
the state.
In testimony submitted by the
California Governor's Office on
Planning and Research to the
House Select Committee on the
Outer Continental Shelf, the
state complained that the In
terior Department has tailed to
consider California comments
on earlier proposals for a lease
schedule.
"Interior seems intent on per

petuating a relationship best de
scribed as colonial." the state
ment said. "By ignoring the con
cerns of state and local govern
ment and citizen's groups in
California, the department has
set the stage for prolonged con
flict."
The Interior Department re
cently released its final five-year
proposed schedule for selling the
rights to drill for oil and gas in
U.S. coastal waters. That was the
schedule thai' came before the
House panel Tuesday and was
the subject of the California
criticism, presented by Rep.
Leon Panetta (D-Calif).
"The plan now under review
by Congress fails to weigh the
impacts of oil and gjs develop

ment on fishery and recreational
industries and the unique ;md
fragile coastal environment,"the
state testimony said.
"If the department proceeds
to implement the proposed
schedule, it will make a mockery
of the pro\ ision of the Lands Act
which directs the department to
■properly balance the potential
for environmental damage, the
potential for the discovery of oil
and gas and the potential for ad
verse impact to the coastal
/one.' "
The governor's office said
state and local officials submit
ted a series of criticisms and re
commendations while the lease
schedule was being drafted.
"The final schedule, as sub
mitted to Congress, shows no
evidence of having been mod
ified in any way fo meet these
concerns."
The statement said four major
changes at a minimum would be
required to make the schedule
acceptable:
— The Santa Monica Bay and
Santa Barbara Channel Ecologi
cal Preserve must be removed
from the proposed sale.
• — The three Central Califor
nia Basins — Santa Cruz,
Bodega Bay and Point Arena —
must be removed.
— The boundaries of two lease
areas — Nos. 73 and 80 — must
be precisely defined.
— Sale of the tract designated
No. 53 must be delayed until en
vironmental studies are com
pleted.
