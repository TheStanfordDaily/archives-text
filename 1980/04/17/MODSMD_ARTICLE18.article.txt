# 11-year-old strikes big in stocks
## 
### DAN TEDRICK The Associated Press 
CHULA VISTA, Calif. — When
Stanley Martinez speaks, you lis
ten. At least, that's the view of
Kurt Sax of E.F. Huttop, Stan
lev's stockbroker for the last
three years.
No matter that Stanley is only
11.
"It was all his idea to .sell his
Xerox stock last September at
the top, just before the market
bioke," recalls Sax. "It hasn't
been higher since."
How much did Stanley make?
"I'll tell you this much — it
was more than a couple of
hundred dollars."
Actually. Stanley isn't in it just
tor the money. He gives the
other kids good tips about how to
stretch their nickels and dimes
although he charges his father 1 2
percent interest on their $1000
son-to-father loan.
The kids at Mueller Elemen

tary School, where Stanley is
student body president, are get
ting a pitch now to sign up for
financial advice at $2 per hour,
but they're leery.
Says his father: "He goes to
the kids' houses and talks to
them about things their parents
don't even understand. But Stan
ley has a problem not appearing
to be something he isn't, like a
con man."
Stanley would like his friends
to understand diversification,
not like jumping from stamps to
frogs to girls every few weeks but
how to make it big by starting
with an allowance or lawn
mowing money.
It all began when he was six on
Christmas 1975 and a man gave
Stanley a book about money. In
a few months, all his savings were
in Ralston Purina, and his stock
today pays quarterly dividends.
In 1978. he visited an art gallery
on a Sunday; put down some

pocket change on a Norman
Rockwell print which the artist
had signed and "on Wednesday 1
heard in the papers where
Rockwell had just died." Stanley
recalls.
"The value of the work went
up 33 cents that day and bv the
next Sunday another 33 cents so
I made 66 cents in a week. Right
now, it's worth in the area of
$2600 to $3000," he said.
"Right now, I'm investing in
rare coins. You can purchase a
coin for its bullion value and for
the numismatic value which will
keep going up even if the bullion
value falls."
The tousle-haired youngster
with two savings accounts earns
$20 a week for working the cash
register and selling items in one
of the two San Diego gift shops
his parents operate. He has
worked six-or-seven-hour stints
there on weekends since the age
of eight, but he finds time to read

the business pages of several
newspapers.
He is an altai hoy who serves
Mass every Sunday at Immacu
late Conception Roman
Catholic Church. His grades are
only slightly under an A average.
He plays golf with his dad, a fac
tory toolmaker. a'nd is now get
ting into shape for another sum
mer as pitcher or outfielder for
the Cougar's Little League team.
Timing, says Stanley Mar
tine/. is the best weapon in play
ing — whether baseball or the
stock market.
•"1 try to find the major trends
which would help determine
when is the best time to buy and
sell," he confided in a quick in
terview between the breakfast
table and a dash to school.
"The greatest factor is timing.
If you can't have good timing,
you can't make good money in it.
A recent researcher said — and
he's about right — that 9N per
cent of those who invest in the
stock market don't make money.
One percent breaks even and I
percent makes money. So timing
is important."
Inflation is Stanley's biggest
dislike, but he thinks it has its
point.
•"My forecast for inflation this
year is 22': percent by De
cember and 25 percent in
California," he said.
"I totally disagree with wage
and price guidelines. It seems
that at this point we need a reces
sion. and this is what the Ameri
can public doesn't understand.

had signed and "on Wednesday 1
heard in the papers where
Rockwell had just died." Stanley
recalls.
"The value of the work went
up 33 cents that day and bv the
next Sunday another 33 cents so
I made 66 cents in a week. Right
now, it's worth in the area of
$2600 to $3000," he said.
"Right now, I'm investing in
rare coins. You can purchase a
coin for its bullion value and for
the numismatic value which will
keep going up even if the bullion
value falls."

Timing, says Stanley Mar
tine/. is the best weapon in play
ing — whether baseball or the
stock market.
•"1 try to find the major trends
which would help determine
when is the best time to buy and
sell," he confided in a quick in
terview between the breakfast
table and a dash to school.
"The greatest factor is timing.
If you can't have good timing,
you can't make good money in it.
A recent researcher said — and
he's about right — that 9N per
cent of those who invest in the
stock market don't make money.
One percent breaks even and I
percent makes money. So timing
is important."
Inflation is Stanley's biggest
dislike, but he thinks it has its
point.
•"My forecast for inflation this
year is 22': percent by De
cember and 25 percent in
California," he said.
"I totally disagree with wage
and price guidelines. It seems
that at this point we need a reces
sion. and this is what the Ameri
can public doesn't understand.
CHULA VISTA, Calif. — When
Stanley Martinez speaks, you lis
ten. At least, that's the view of
Kurt Sax of E.F. Huttop, Stan
lev's stockbroker for the last
three years.
No matter that Stanley is only
11.
"It was all his idea to .sell his
Xerox stock last September at
the top, just before the market
bioke," recalls Sax. "It hasn't
been higher since."
How much did Stanley make?
"I'll tell you this much — it
was more than a couple of
hundred dollars."
Actually. Stanley isn't in it just
tor the money. He gives the
other kids good tips about how to
stretch their nickels and dimes
although he charges his father 1 2
percent interest on their $1000
son-to-father loan.
The kids at Mueller Elemen

tary School, where Stanley is
student body president, are get
ting a pitch now to sign up for
financial advice at $2 per hour,
but they're leery.
Says his father: "He goes to
the kids' houses and talks to
them about things their parents
don't even understand. But Stan
ley has a problem not appearing
to be something he isn't, like a
con man."
Stanley would like his friends
to understand diversification,
not like jumping from stamps to
frogs to girls every few weeks but
how to make it big by starting
with an allowance or lawn
mowing money.
It all began when he was six on
Christmas 1975 and a man gave
Stanley a book about money. In
a few months, all his savings were
in Ralston Purina, and his stock
today pays quarterly dividends.
In 1978. he visited an art gallery
on a Sunday; put down some

pocket change on a Norman
Rockwell print which the artist
had signed and "on Wednesday 1
