JUNEAU, Alaska — The
state of Alaska""ls giving away
money.
State officials have been trying
to figure out how to slim down a
state treasury bloated with oil
revenues. Their solution, ap
proved this week by the Legisla
ture. was to pass the money out
to the state's 400.000 residents.
The state income tax is being
abolished for most people, last
year's income tax payments are
being refunded, and millions of
dollars in oil revenues are being
distributed.
The payout will total $405
million this year alone — $2,000
for the average adult — and fu
ture years hold the promise of
thousands of dollars more.
"Some people call this
socialistic," said Gov. Jay Ham
mond. "But it really is very con
servative."

The state's first big windfall —
$900 million it garnered in 1 969
from a lease on the Prudhoe Bay
oil fields—went mostly to public
works projects. Subsequent oil
revenues of under $1 billion a
year were used to continue gov -
ernment services.
But with the price ot oil having
risen dramatically, the state ex
pects to receive more than $4
billion in revenues by mid-1981.

So legislators agreed to stop
spending and start giving.
The annual distribution plan
w ill give residents at least $50 for
each year they've lived in Alaska
since 1959, when statehood be
gan. That means a 21-year resi
dent will receive $1,050 this
year.
The $50 base dividend is ex
pected to increase because it is
tied to earnings by a state trust
fund fed bv oil revenues.
