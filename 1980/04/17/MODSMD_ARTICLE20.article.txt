## Why register to vote? 
### 
At midnight on May 5, millions of
Californians will have voluntarily given up
one of their most basic rights — the right to
vote in an election. May 5 is the last day
California residents can register to vote in
the June 3 statewide primary elections.
To disinterestedly throw away such a
right that our ancestors struggled for years
to obtain, a l ight which separates our free
dom from the tyrannical oppression most of
the world's peoples live under, seems inex
cusable.
Included on the primary ballot will be
statewide propositions involving a myriad
of issues affecting almost everyone in
California. You can decide whether your
landlord can routinely charge exorbitant
rents (Prop. 10). You can help decide
whether the oil companies should have to
pay taxes on their excess profits to build

mass transit systems (Prop. 1 1 ). You can
even help decide whether you will have to
pay tuition at state schools (Prop.9).
And you can vote for the presidential
candidate of any party whom you think
could best lead this country in the next four
years.
Of course, many of our readers are resi
dents of states other than California. Many
of these states have already held primaries,
and many are still to do so. But regardless
of where you wish to vote, if you're not
registered, you will have no voice in deter
mining the path your city, county. state and
country follow.
It takes about two minutes to register to
vote. Don't miss your chance to help shape
your own future. If you don't care, how can
you expect your elected representatives to
care in your place?
