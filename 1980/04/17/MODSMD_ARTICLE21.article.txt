# Label fever now epidemic
## 
### 
I wandered into a friend's room the other day to
find him repainting the place. Being in a mischiev -
ous sort of spirit. I playfully picked up ;i brush
soaked with "ivory cork" and swiped him on the
shirt.
The boy went initso—hysterically screaming
down the hall. I thought he was going to have a
cardiac arrest under the drinking fountain. After a
moment or two he returned, frothing ;it the mouth,
a dazed look in his eye. He was moaning incohe
rently.
"Do you know what this is?" he screeched de
prnvedly. gesturing wildly at his chest, "a hila
shirt." So what? I shrugged as he writhed on the
floor — what's so monumental about a Fila shirt?
And then it hit me: the symptoms added up —
another case of label fever had struck.
W hat appeared to be an average student wearing
an average tee shirt had been transformed by the
little "F"' bragging from his sleeve. He was a raving

maniac: no Tide or Clorox would save him. His
reputation — down the trendy tubes. I felt sick for
him. And then I wondered, how many of you suffer
from this epidemic? How many innocent students
have been plagued bv the dreaded virus —label
fever?
One friend ol mine. Ingrid Izod. has it soooo bad
that when she gets dressed in the morning, she has
to take an address book to the closet: Ralph
Lauren, at the cleaners: Vidal Sassoon. clashes
with Calvin Klein: maybe Diane Von Furstenburg
is tree today.
I hen there is my dear Iriend Maria who swears
by the Italian trio: Gucci. Pucci and Fiorucci. I
thought it was a new type of pizza! Her boyfriend.
Mr. C hie. adores the French menage a trois: Yves.
St. Laurent. Charles Jourdan and "led Lapidus.
Hey. is this a cocktail party, or are we talking
severe diagnosis of label fever? This isn't name
dropping, it's name stitching — all over your body!
At the critical stages ol the disease, the skin
becomes allergic to all clothing made of polvestcr:
only the finest silk packaged at Saks can be toler

ated. especially for those formal trips to the post
office.
Label fever spreads past meager wardrobe
purchases, however, affecting the integral lifestyle
of the victim. Who can ignore the status tempta
tions of a bottle of Perrier? A quick wink through
Varnaise glasses? A few miles in a BMW? And
then there's the religious component. Jews for
Jesus are wearing Jag's for JAP's. Personally, as I
trek through White Plaza. I think I'm in a swamp
with all those loose alligators running around.
We know that all well-dressed students must
array themselves in accessories that are equally as
"in." Yes. my fine-feathered friends (bankrupt,
but fine-leathered), jewelry is a must. C'artier.
rimex and Rolev (Those of you who didn't gasp at
one of these brands are lucky: you've had a remis
sion. )
Label fever is not only disasterous to one's wal
let, it's threatening the very health of the women on
this campus. Ha\e you ever tried to walk in those
"Candies" spikey heels? A routine trek to the ol"
9 a.m. becomes suicidal. If you have to label
your feet, at least be comfortable in Espadrilles.
Pretty soon the AMA will issue warnings on all
designer items: "Labels are dangerous to your
health, we have tested them on laboratory rats
(from Paris)."
I'm telling you. it's contagious. I used to dash
around campus freshman year in a pair of green
surgeon pants and a sweat shirt. I knew I'd con
tracted a severe case after I succumbed to the
purchase of a Louis Vaton purse in Florence. Who
cares if it's fake?
We've become so deranged that it's really racy to
wear second-hand labels. I never thought the Sal
vation Army would be the center of the fashion
world!
It you've had an intense desire to rush over to the
Stanford Shopping Center and hang out at the
"Polo" store, the prognosis isn't too good. But I've
devised the following painless LHI.T (early home
label test) to determine if you are suffering from
the fever.
In this article. I've mentioned 22 designer-type
items. If you can identify I to 5: you're just casual
bourgeoisie: 5 to 10: you're on the way to Halston
heaven; 10 to 15: severe case. I hope you've mod
eled the new fuchsia La Coste: 15 to 22: hopeless,
you spend your time skimming old Vogues. You'll
undoubtedly monogram your towels with someone
else's initials . . . it's terminal.
From New York, this is A.M./. signing off:
Vidal and I are going shopping.

Hey. is this a cocktail party, or are we talking
severe diagnosis of label fever? This isn't name
dropping, it's name stitching — all over your body!
At the critical stages ol the disease, the skin
becomes allergic to all clothing made of polvestcr:
only the finest silk packaged at Saks can be toler

ated. especially for those formal trips to the post
office.
Label fever spreads past meager wardrobe
purchases, however, affecting the integral lifestyle
of the victim. Who can ignore the status tempta
tions of a bottle of Perrier? A quick wink through
Varnaise glasses? A few miles in a BMW? And
then there's the religious component. Jews for
Jesus are wearing Jag's for JAP's. Personally, as I
trek through White Plaza. I think I'm in a swamp
with all those loose alligators running around.
We know that all well-dressed students must
array themselves in accessories that are equally as
"in." Yes. my fine-feathered friends (bankrupt,
but fine-leathered), jewelry is a must. C'artier.
rimex and Rolev (Those of you who didn't gasp at
one of these brands are lucky: you've had a remis

Label fever is not only disasterous to one's wal
let, it's threatening the very health of the women on
this campus. Ha\e you ever tried to walk in those
"Candies" spikey heels? A routine trek to the ol"
9 a.m. becomes suicidal. If you have to label
your feet, at least be comfortable in Espadrilles.
Pretty soon the AMA will issue warnings on all
designer items: "Labels are dangerous to your
health, we have tested them on laboratory rats
(from Paris)."
I'm telling you. it's contagious. I used to dash
around campus freshman year in a pair of green
surgeon pants and a sweat shirt. I knew I'd con
tracted a severe case after I succumbed to the
purchase of a Louis Vaton purse in Florence. Who
cares if it's fake?
We've become so deranged that it's really racy to
wear second-hand labels. I never thought the Sal
vation Army would be the center of the fashion
world!
It you've had an intense desire to rush over to the
Stanford Shopping Center and hang out at the
"Polo" store, the prognosis isn't too good. But I've
devised the following painless LHI.T (early home
label test) to determine if you are suffering from
the fever.
In this article. I've mentioned 22 designer-type
items. If you can identify I to 5: you're just casual
bourgeoisie: 5 to 10: you're on the way to Halston
heaven; 10 to 15: severe case. I hope you've mod
eled the new fuchsia La Coste: 15 to 22: hopeless,
you spend your time skimming old Vogues. You'll
undoubtedly monogram your towels with someone
else's initials . . . it's terminal.

I wandered into a friend's room the other day to
find him repainting the place. Being in a mischiev -
ous sort of spirit. I playfully picked up ;i brush
soaked with "ivory cork" and swiped him on the
shirt.
The boy went initso—hysterically screaming
down the hall. I thought he was going to have a
cardiac arrest under the drinking fountain. After a
moment or two he returned, frothing ;it the mouth,
a dazed look in his eye. He was moaning incohe
rently.
"Do you know what this is?" he screeched de
prnvedly. gesturing wildly at his chest, "a hila
shirt." So what? I shrugged as he writhed on the
floor — what's so monumental about a Fila shirt?
And then it hit me: the symptoms added up —
another case of label fever had struck.
W hat appeared to be an average student wearing
an average tee shirt had been transformed by the
little "F"' bragging from his sleeve. He was a raving

maniac: no Tide or Clorox would save him. His
reputation — down the trendy tubes. I felt sick for
him. And then I wondered, how many of you suffer
from this epidemic? How many innocent students
have been plagued bv the dreaded virus —label
fever?
One friend ol mine. Ingrid Izod. has it soooo bad
that when she gets dressed in the morning, she has
to take an address book to the closet: Ralph
Lauren, at the cleaners: Vidal Sassoon. clashes
