## End big business regulation 
### 
The Naderites. in sponsoring
today's national Big Business
Day and virtually calling tor
turning over the control of cor
porations to labor, consumer,
environmental and assorted pub
lic interest spokespersons, have
correctly identified the disease
the American corporate state
but are hopelessly naive in
thinking that putting a few of the
"right people" in the "right
places" is a cure.
There is 110 doubt that big bus
iness controls much of the
economy and uses its wealth to
affect the political process. But it
is crucial to understand how this
came about and how it is per
petuated.
The lyth-century American
economy, while not completely
laissez-faire, often closely ap
proximated an unhampered
market sy stem. To be sure, much
injustice was present, due to the
absence of a well-enforced
common law of strict liability
(which led to pollution problems
still with us) and the failure to
treat all individuals as equal
under the law (which permitted
slavery, among other wrongs).
But the results of the market sys
tem. when compared with the
previous centuries of mercan
tilism. were spectacular — a fact
even Marxists acknowledge.
Secure in the knowledge that
the fruits of their investments
would be safe from confiscation
(either through taxation or infla
tion). the people saved and in
vested. The new breed of busi
ness was willing to assume the
greater risks of longer-range
projects. They plowed profits
back into new and expanded
lirms. I hey found new uses for a
rapidly developing technology.
These businesses, large and
small, created a \ ast and produc

live economy. Among the be
nefits that flowed to all segments
ol society was the continual rise
m real wages, even though the
population was multiplying
enormously.
Unfortunately, near the turn
of the 2<)th century a new mer
cantilism began to emerge.
Competition was often
anathema to businesses that had
made it to the top of their indus
tries. Owners of fresh combina
tions of capital were often "hun
grier" (more aggressive) than
their older, more established
counterparts. They were often
more adaptive to swiftly chang
ing circumstances. and therefore
more competitive.
The largest industries and old
est firms curried favors from
their friends in government.
They set up and influenced "reg
ulatory" agencies for their own
benefit: the ICC. FDA. FTC
and. perhaps most important of
all. the Federal Reserve System.
In this way. the big corporations,
through their representatives,
were able to discourage competi
tion. and to lay the foundations
for the monopolistic 20th
century American Corporate
State.
As important as the special in
terest regulation was in this pro
cess. the American Corporate
State could not have grown as it
did without the massive informa
tion interferences in the
economy caused by 60 years of
war and militarism. The well
developed system of "defense"
contracts, cost-plus arrange
ments. and interlocking directo
rates among the Pentagon and
pivotal sectors of American bus
iness makes a mockery of the
"free market." Most recently.
nuclca r militarism has spawned
the subsidized and protected

nuelear power industry, perhaps
the ultimate creation of the cor
porate state.
It should be apparent that the
cure is not to turn the board
rooms over to a new collection of
interlocking special interests, as
Ralph Nader would do. This
would simply bind this major
segment of the economy even
more tightly to the political sec
tor. creating even larger
corporate statist bureaucracies
and choking off what little flexi
bility and creativity is left. There
would be pressure for more bail
outs, price supports, protected
monopolies and other interven
tions that hurt consumers and
taxpayers and prolong the dis
ease.
Ihe cure is to end the
favoritism that government gives
big business through regulation,
to end the militarism that ce
ments government and business
together, and to hold owners re
sponsible for injury or damage
done to people or their property,
including environmental pre
serves and sanctuaries. This will
not only rid us of the American
Corporate State, but will end the
corruption of the political pro
cess by corporate campaign
financing as business loses in
terest in backing politicians who
have no favors to give.
Just as we ended the power of
big religion by separating church
and state, so should we end the
power of big business — by
separating economy and state.

pivotal sectors of American bus

"free market." Most recently.
nuclca r militarism has spawned
the subsidized and protected

nuelear power industry, perhaps
the ultimate creation of the cor
porate state.
It should be apparent that the
cure is not to turn the board
rooms over to a new collection of
interlocking special interests, as
Ralph Nader would do. This
would simply bind this major
segment of the economy even
more tightly to the political sec
tor. creating even larger
corporate statist bureaucracies
and choking off what little flexi
bility and creativity is left. There
would be pressure for more bail
outs, price supports, protected
monopolies and other interven
tions that hurt consumers and
taxpayers and prolong the dis
ease.
Ihe cure is to end the
favoritism that government gives
big business through regulation,
to end the militarism that ce
ments government and business
together, and to hold owners re
sponsible for injury or damage
done to people or their property,
including environmental pre
serves and sanctuaries. This will
not only rid us of the American
Corporate State, but will end the
corruption of the political pro
cess by corporate campaign
financing as business loses in
terest in backing politicians who
have no favors to give.
Just as we ended the power of
big religion by separating church
and state, so should we end the
power of big business — by
separating economy and state.

The Naderites. in sponsoring
today's national Big Business
Day and virtually calling tor
turning over the control of cor
porations to labor, consumer,
environmental and assorted pub
lic interest spokespersons, have
correctly identified the disease
the American corporate state
but are hopelessly naive in
thinking that putting a few of the
"right people" in the "right
places" is a cure.
There is 110 doubt that big bus
iness controls much of the
economy and uses its wealth to
affect the political process. But it
is crucial to understand how this
came about and how it is per
petuated.
The lyth-century American
economy, while not completely
laissez-faire, often closely ap
proximated an unhampered
market sy stem. To be sure, much
injustice was present, due to the
absence of a well-enforced
common law of strict liability
(which led to pollution problems
still with us) and the failure to
treat all individuals as equal
under the law (which permitted
slavery, among other wrongs).
But the results of the market sys
tem. when compared with the
previous centuries of mercan
tilism. were spectacular — a fact
even Marxists acknowledge.
Secure in the knowledge that
the fruits of their investments
would be safe from confiscation
(either through taxation or infla

vested. The new breed of busi
ness was willing to assume the
greater risks of longer-range
projects. They plowed profits
back into new and expanded
lirms. I hey found new uses for a
rapidly developing technology.
These businesses, large and
small, created a \ ast and produc

live economy. Among the be
nefits that flowed to all segments
ol society was the continual rise
m real wages, even though the
population was multiplying
enormously.
Unfortunately, near the turn
of the 2<)th century a new mer
cantilism began to emerge.
Competition was often
anathema to businesses that had
made it to the top of their indus
tries. Owners of fresh combina
tions of capital were often "hun
grier" (more aggressive) than
their older, more established
counterparts. They were often
more adaptive to swiftly chang
ing circumstances. and therefore
more competitive.
The largest industries and old
est firms curried favors from
their friends in government.
They set up and influenced "reg
ulatory" agencies for their own
benefit: the ICC. FDA. FTC
and. perhaps most important of
all. the Federal Reserve System.
In this way. the big corporations,
through their representatives,
were able to discourage competi
tion. and to lay the foundations
for the monopolistic 20th
century American Corporate
State.
As important as the special in
terest regulation was in this pro
cess. the American Corporate
State could not have grown as it
did without the massive informa
tion interferences in the
economy caused by 60 years of
war and militarism. The well
developed system of "defense"
contracts, cost-plus arrange

rates among the Pentagon and
