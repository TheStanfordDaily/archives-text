The diseov cry of a link between cigarettes
and the development ot lung eaneer. em
physema. Ann coronary artery disease has
prompted a worldwide campaign to stop
smoking. Unfortunately, while the number
of adult smokers in the United States has
decreased since 1964. the habit remains at a
constant level among adolescent boys and
has increased alarmingly among adolescent
females. These and other facts clearly indi
cate that past efforts to end the senseless
self-destruction of the chronic smoker have
focused on the wrong target population.
The smoking habit is extremely difficult to
extinguish.
Most American smokers realize the dan
gers of their habit, yet many terminal lung
and throat cancer patients can be found who
continue to light up. Preventive medicine has
clearly done all it can for the adult smoking
population, and should now instead direct its
efforts toward young people.
Sixteen percent ol the 12 and IN-year-old
age group in the United States were regular
smokers in compared to only 12 per
cent in 1968. While females in the past com
prised only one-third of the total, they make
up one-half of the recent group.
Several studies have shown that the aver
age age when smoking begins is decreasing.
Disturbing as this evidence is by itself, a re
cent study suggests that children who begin
smoking are more likely to begin to use al
cohol and street drugs. It appears that very
few adolescents are confirmed smokers by
the end of ninth grade, and the critical period

for starting is during high school.
Investigations have shown that some
teenagers smoke because it increases their
peer acceptance, gives them feelings of
maturity since it's an "adult" activity, pro
vides a level of physiological stimulation and
pleasure, and serves as an act of defiance of
authority figures. Prevention pfograms re
viewed in the Surgeon General's Report
rarely include such concepts, but instead em
phasize the long-term dangers of smoking,
which have little impact on most adolescents.
Relatively few high school teachers are
trained as health educators, and there are
serious problems found in the way teachers
implement programs on smoking and health.
Furthermore, a 1971 survey of 50.000 In
diana school children revealed that less than
one percent had received information about
smoking in health classes. It may be con
cluded that our society is reaching relatively
few potential young smokers and is using an
unsuccessful approach.
Several important measures should im
mediately be taken on a nationwide scale to
alleviate our current mismanagement of the
smoking problem. Two recommendations
made by the American Association for
Health. Phvsical Education and Recreation
are for schools to become responsible for
providing smoking education programs and
for teachers and other school personnel to
implement these programs. This will require
a comprehensive program tor teacher train
ing in the evaluation and effective uAe of
smoking and health education methods.

As a nation, we need to follow the example
ot Sweden, where a 25-year effort, sup
ported by government and the public, is un
derway with the objective of making people
born in 1975 a non-smoking generation.
A number of noteworthy endeavors are
being made in the United States. The Na
tional Clearinghouse for Smoking and
Health's School Health Curriculum Project
has been introduced into more than 200
school districts in 2N states, and is based on
empirically-tested concepts that communi
cate health knowledge to children. A three
year-longitudinal study is underway in Hous
ton that trains junior high school students tp
resist peer and media pressure to smoke and
to resist the model ot smoking parents.
Applying such techniques on a widespread
basis will undoubtedly be costly, but the in
vestment will definitely be worthwhile in
terms of reducing future national health care
costs. If smoking can be significantly de
creased or eliminated entirely, self-inflicted
illnesses caused by the habit will no longer fill
American hospitals with tragic victims.
Public information campaigns directed at
the prevention of smoking have been too
broadly-targeted and have not reflected the
beliefs and attitudes of children and adoles
cents. As voters and potential donors to
worthy causes, we should not hesitate to pro
vide financial support for measures aimed at
eliminating this self-destructive tendency
from our young citizens.
