## Make big business more accountable 
### 
Today is national Big Business
Day. As economist John Ken
neth Galhraith. one of the spon
sors. said, the purpose of Big
Business Day is "to see big busi
ness better understood ... a day
to see how it sets prices, per
suades consumers, influences
legislation and otherwise plans
our lives."
Corporate propaganda blames
government and labor — and
implicitly consumer programs,
environmental legislation, and
federal spending on social prog
rams — for most of America's
ills. Yet the actions of our giant
corporations have gross public
impacts. By means of the lobby
system, payoffs, and vast expen
ditures for electoral propaganda,
they have tremendously in
creased their role in determining
political, social and economic
policy in this country and ab
road.
Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal
(D-N\ ) said "excessive corpo
rate power is on the verge of
overwhelming our political and
government institutions."
Robert Georgine, president of
the AEL-CIO Buiidingand Con
struction Trades Department,
said the building trades have put
"control of corporate power 011
the top of (their) agenda for the
1980s." Georgine has criticized
corporations for attacking con
struction unions, seeking the re
peal of prevailing wage laws as
well as job health and safety
laws, and supporting anti
worker candidates in political
campaigns.
Last year over I ()(),()()() people
died from cancer they got on the
job. in the air and in their food.
Yet big business has launched a
propaganda war to undermine
the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, the
Clean Air Act and pure food
laws.
Not all the supporters of Big
Business Day are against corpo
rations. William Olwell. vice
president of the million-member
United food and Commercial

Workers, said the coalition's
primary target is the "manage
ment cadre" that has no regard
lor stockholder, employees, or
the nation.
Small businesmen are increas
ingly becoming an endangered
species. Although big business
opposes new antitrust laws as
violations of the "free market,"
the fact is that from 1975 to
1978. giant conglomerates in
creased by three-fold the
number of smaller businesses
they gobbled up. In the case of
media, the nation's newspapers,
television and radio stations are
increasingly falling into the
hands of a few corporations and
individuals, such as the Hearsts,
the Knights and Rupert Nur
doch. v
To reverse such dangerous
trends. Rosenthal plans to intro
duce a Corporate Democracy
Act early next year. The prop
osed legislation is not regulatory:
it does not create a new federal
agency. Rather, it aims to estab
lish principals of accountability.
It would cover about 800 of the
biggest companies — those with
more than 5000 employees or
more than $250 million in assets
or sales. It would provide for less
corporate secrecy, ample notifi
cation to workers on plant clo
sures. free speech and "whistleb
lower" protection for workers,
greater shareholder rights, an
independent majority on boards
of directors, and stiffer criminal
penalties for corporate criminal
conduct.
The ambitious and achievable
goal of Big Business Day is to
launch the 1980s as a period of
scrutiny of corporate power and
to spur citizen groups to organize
around this subject. We think
this event will be a significant
voice in the debate over the in
fluence and place of big business
in America — and hope that you
will share our interest, en
thusiasm and involvement.
It is a nationwide event involv -
ing hundreds of communities —
in the tradition of Earth Day.

Today is national Big Business
Day. As economist John Ken
neth Galhraith. one of the spon
sors. said, the purpose of Big
Business Day is "to see big busi
ness better understood ... a day
to see how it sets prices, per
suades consumers, influences
legislation and otherwise plans
our lives."
Corporate propaganda blames
government and labor — and
implicitly consumer programs,
environmental legislation, and
federal spending on social prog
rams — for most of America's
ills. Yet the actions of our giant
corporations have gross public
impacts. By means of the lobby
system, payoffs, and vast expen
ditures for electoral propaganda,
they have tremendously in
creased their role in determining
political, social and economic
policy in this country and ab
road.
Rep. Benjamin Rosenthal
(D-N\ ) said "excessive corpo
rate power is on the verge of
overwhelming our political and
government institutions."
Robert Georgine, president of
the AEL-CIO Buiidingand Con
struction Trades Department,
said the building trades have put
"control of corporate power 011
the top of (their) agenda for the
1980s." Georgine has criticized
corporations for attacking con
struction unions, seeking the re
peal of prevailing wage laws as
well as job health and safety
laws, and supporting anti
worker candidates in political
campaigns.
Last year over I ()(),()()() people
died from cancer they got on the
job. in the air and in their food.
Yet big business has launched a
propaganda war to undermine
the Occupational Safety and
Health Administration, the
Clean Air Act and pure food
laws.
Not all the supporters of Big
Business Day are against corpo
rations. William Olwell. vice
president of the million-member
United food and Commercial

Workers, said the coalition's
primary target is the "manage

the nation.
Small businesmen are increas
ingly becoming an endangered
species. Although big business
opposes new antitrust laws as
violations of the "free market,"
the fact is that from 1975 to
1978. giant conglomerates in
creased by three-fold the
number of smaller businesses
they gobbled up. In the case of
media, the nation's newspapers,
television and radio stations are
increasingly falling into the
hands of a few corporations and
individuals, such as the Hearsts,
the Knights and Rupert Nur
doch. v
To reverse such dangerous
trends. Rosenthal plans to intro
duce a Corporate Democracy
Act early next year. The prop
osed legislation is not regulatory:
it does not create a new federal
agency. Rather, it aims to estab
lish principals of accountability.
It would cover about 800 of the
biggest companies — those with
more than 5000 employees or
more than $250 million in assets
or sales. It would provide for less
corporate secrecy, ample notifi
cation to workers on plant clo
sures. free speech and "whistleb
lower" protection for workers,
greater shareholder rights, an
independent majority on boards
of directors, and stiffer criminal
penalties for corporate criminal
conduct.
The ambitious and achievable
goal of Big Business Day is to
launch the 1980s as a period of
scrutiny of corporate power and
to spur citizen groups to organize
around this subject. We think
this event will be a significant
voice in the debate over the in
fluence and place of big business
in America — and hope that you
will share our interest, en
thusiasm and involvement.
It is a nationwide event involv -
ing hundreds of communities —
in the tradition of Earth Day.
