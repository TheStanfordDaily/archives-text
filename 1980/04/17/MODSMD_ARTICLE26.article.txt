### Carol Rose Staff Writer 
It you ever pass through White
PI a/a between 10 and noon on a
Saturday morning, you may see a
group of second, third and fourth
graders and Stanford students
ha\ mg a treasure hum or knock
ing down a pinata.
These are volunteer tutors
from Stanford and C'hicano chil
dren from Hast Palo Alto and
Last Menlo Park.
The program is called Barrio
Assistance, from the Spanish
word "barrio" meaning
neighborhood or Mexican
ghetto. Involving about 30 chil
dren and an equal number of
tutors. Barrio Assistance pro
vides one-on-one bilingual
teaching in math, spelling and
reading skills. All of the tutors
are volunteer Stanford students
coming from on and off campus,
but most reside in Casa Zapata.
The Saturday program is bro
ken do\s n into two one-hour sec-

tions. Academic skills are stres
sed the first hour, while the sec
ond hour is spent on recreational
activities that include films,
storytellers. Ballet I olklorico
and games, according to coor
dinator Phil B aca.
"Most of the children are at
least one year behind, academi
cally." according to co
coordinator Susana Vega.
Barrio Assistance gets funding
from four sources, including the
Academic Organizations Board,
the C'hicano Fellows Program,
the Office of C'hicano Affairs
and the Office ot Student Ac
ti\ ities.
The six coordinators. Baca.
Vega. Kerin McTaggart. Roy
Rodriguez, Linda Chavez and
Sharon Padilla. work collectively
to transport the children to and
from their homes and to organize
the curriculum and activities.
"Barrio Assistance is now in its
eighth year." said senior Roy
Rodriguez
"It initially included adult and
teenage tutoring and counseling,
and community action programs,
as well as the child tutoring."
Only the child tutoring prog
ram is meeting this year, though
Rodriguez hopes to soon start
the teenager program again.
Other programs coordinated
through Barrio Assistance this
year have been food drives at
Easter and Thanksgiving and a
Halloween Haunted House at
Casa Zapata. These were or-

gani/ed by the coordinators and
Casa Zapata.
■"At 112 aster we spent over
$3000 (three to four tons of
food) tor the ( hieano commun
ity members in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park." said Baca.
I aen though the tutors are not
paid. Barrio Assistance has little
difficulty in attracting enough
teachers on Saturday mornings.
It is an opportunity to see
other p;irts of the University."
said sophomore Arleen (ion
/ales. In this elite university one
can get lost. You cross Highway
101 and reali/e that Stanford is
isolated. Barrio Assistance helps
me to get down to the real world
and improve m\ Spanish as
well."
I know that these kids need
our help." said freshman I aura
Marques. "II they are to grow up
and he successful, they have to
know hnglish But also, they
should not lose their Spanish he
cause it is a part of their culture."
In school these children uct
much less personal attention,
and no Spanish." explained
C ieraldo Cion/ale/. "We have no
pressure to be authorities, so
they can tell me their problems.
We are like their brothers or sis
ters. We are their friends."
When you see the dark eyes
and shy smile of six-year-old
Pedro, gazing at his tutor in ad
miration. it does seem as though
he has found a Iriend in Barrio
Assistance.
