# U.S. firms bid too high
## SLAC buys supplies abroad 
### Thomas O' Toole The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Inflation
and production problems have
hit U.S. high technology so hard
in the last two years that federal
contractors, including those that
supply the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, have been
forced to buy major components
from foreign suppliers for the
first time in decades.
In each case, the purchase was
made at the end of a process that
began with requests for bids
from suppliers and ended with
the selection of a foreign supplier
whose bid was so far below the
lowest U.S. proposal that the
"buy America" rule on federal
projects was waived. The "buv
America" policy states that a
foreign bid must be at least six
percent below the U.S. bid to be
considered.
Among the high-technology
components bought abroad were
$470,000 worth or quick-acting
Swiss vacuum valves for the
Positron-Electron colliding
beam project (PEP ring) near
completion at SLAC; $100,000
worth of special Japanese steel
for the Nova laser project at
Lawrence Livermore Laborat
ory; and million worth of
pumps, seals and low
temperature controls from the
Swiss, West Germans and
French for the Tokomak Fusion
Test Reactor being built at
Princeton. N.J.
"These are the sorts of things
we've never had to buy outside
the U. 5.." said one official of the
Department of Energy, which is
financing all three projects.
"Times have changed in the last
few years."
The foreign purchases that
have raised the most concern are
a pair of orders placed with West
Germany and Japan for the fu
sion project at Princeton. One is
a $1.5 million order for special
steel from Japan, the other a
SI .6 million order for long billets
of specially extruded copper
from West Germany.
Both will be used in fabricat
ing the largest magnets ever
built. Nti fewer than 20 of these
magnets will be placed in the
doughnut-shaped Tokomak

being built at Princeton to eon
fine the deuterium plasma ex
pected to reach heats of 100 mill
ion degrees and demonstrate the
Scientific feasibility of fusion.
The order placed to a West
German firm called Rabble
Metal is for 500.000 pounds of
copper extruded into shapes 50
feet long, 6.5 inches wide and
five-eighths of an inch thick.
Each 50-foot extrusion has an el
liptical hole through its center.
Many of these copper strips al-

ready ha\ e been shipped to Wes
tinghouse Electric Corp. in the
United States, where 44 are
welded together and wound to
form the coil that will generate
the magnetic field in the fusion
machine. There will be 20 coils in
the machine, each weighing
25.000 pounds.
The thing that most concerned
Princeton project officials when
bids came in for this job is that
the two lowest bids were from
West Germany and Finland.
Only Phelps-Dodge and
Anaconda in t country bid on
the job. Neither was close to the
German and Finnish bids, ac
cording to DOE officials.

At each end of each of the 20
magnetic coils in the Princeton
Tokomak, enormous steel rings
will hold the copper coils rigidly
in place. Each ring weighs
15.000 pounds and is being
forged out of a supertough and
superhard steel called "nitronic"
steel. All the rings are being
forged by the Japan Steel Co.
"These rings have a six-foot
radius and they're six inches
thick." one Energy Department
official said. "The Japanese were

not only the lowest bidder, they
were the only suppliers who
could deliver these very special
rings on the schedule at which we
needed them."
Government officials point
out that the orders to West Ger
many and Japan represent only
25 percent of the $12 million in
orders placed for the 20 magnets
that will be the heart of the
Princeton fusion machine.
\
"I do not see this as a worri
some trend." said R Robert
Russell, director of the Council
on Wage and. Price Stability.
"The whole idea of international

trading is that trading countrio
arc better off hy trading. High
technology should he no excep
tion to this."
One Energy Department offi
cial said that West Germany and
Japan are the only countries with
extrusion presses and forging
furnaces large enough to make
major magnet components. At
least two I S. suppliers said they
could have developed such a
capability if they'd been given

enough time to do so.
There is no question that U.S.
suppliers see it differently. One
suggested that the Germans and
Japanese deliberately may have
shaved their price bid to get in on
the ground floor of fusion de
velopment, which promises to
take off in the next 20 years.
"One objective of this prog
ram was to train U.S. industry in
the fabrication of major compo
nents," one potential supplier
complained. "But when you go
out of the country for these com
ponents. you defeat that objec
tive. All you're really doing is
exporting the know-how."

The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center is one of many high-technology institutions which
has been forced to buy supplies from foreign countries because U.S. firms bid too high.
