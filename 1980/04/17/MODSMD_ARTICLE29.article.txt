SAN I RANCISC () — Smiling tourists and
residentsalike happily plunked 50cents intothe
fare collector's hands yesterday to get a long
awaited, rickety ride on this city's famed
Powell-Mason cable car line.
T\e been waiting and waiting for this one to
come," said Angclique Soeey, an eight-month
resident ot San Francisco. "This one's more fun
because you can ride from end to end."
I he opening of the roller coaster-like line,
running from the heart of downtown San Fran
cisco, over Nob Mill, through Chinatown and
finally pullinginto Fisherman's Wharf at V mph,
brings the tamed 106-year-old cable car system
back in lull operation after a seven-month shut
down tor emergency repairs.
I he city s other two cable car routes have
been hauling passengers for some time. The
California Street line was reopened in
November and the outer portion of the, Hyde
Street line was running again in February, but
the Powell-Mason line is generally considered a
favorite with tourists.
I he $750,000 repairs are enough to keep the
tipsy relics running for two years, when the s\ s

tern will have to he shut down to he completely
rebuilt. The price tag for that repair job is about
$56.8 million.
Under a clear blue sky in warm, shortsleeves
weather, tourists and workers chased the sun
rise to catch a ride on the 3'/2-mile line which
opened at h a.m.
"I missed all the fun." said Joe Batiste, a
gripman tin one of the seven maroon and green
box-shaped cars working the line as he clanged
the bells to greet oncoming passengers. Grip
men control the arm that reaches under a slot
between the tracks to hook onto the continually
moving cable.
"That's what people come to San Francisco to
see — the cable cars. Golden Gate Bridge,
Fisherman's Wharf and maybe even
Chinatown," Batiste said.
But the gripman said many residents took the
cable car to work in the morning as was evident
by the number of briefcases on the wooden
seats.
Ernie Johnson, a San Francisco businessman,
said, "I sure was glad to see them back again.
Ihey're quicker than taking a bus to work
downtown."
