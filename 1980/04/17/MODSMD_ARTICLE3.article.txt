# U.S. measures in Iran not to include military action till mid-May
## 
### 
From tlje Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter may order further
retaliatory moves against Iran today but will
not consider military action to free Americans
held hostage in Tehran until after mid-May, a
top aide said yesterday.
The aide, who declined to he quoted by
name, indicated that a Carter announcement of
new economic and diplomatic sanctions would
come soon — perhaps in time for a nationally
broadcast news conference tentatively
scheduled for today.
The source also said the U.S. government
has told its allies that Iran should have ample
time by mid-May to respond to the sanctions
Carter ordered last week, which included the
severing of diplomatic relations with the
Tehran regime.
Though the Iranian government has taken a
nonchalant attitude toward the imposition of
full-scale U.S. economic sanctions, a growing
anxiety among the Iranian people is being re

flected daily in Tehran in the growing lines in
front of supermarkets and butcher shops.
If the I ran'• response to the sanctions is not
positive. *' ..ide said, the allies will be asked to
carry out additional non-military steps aimed
at increasing pressure on Iran to free the 50
Americans who have been held hostage since
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized on Nov.
4.
He emphasized that each ally would not
necessarily he expected to adopt identical sanc
tions or to impose all the sanctions put in place
by the United States.
Because of what amounted to a U.S.-
imposed mid-May deadline for an Iranian re
sponse to pressure being exerted by
Washington, the White Houseoffieial said con
sideration of any military moves against Iran
would wait until after then.
Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini has said the fate of the
hostages will be decided by a new Iranian parli

ament. which may not he selected by the mid
dle of May.
One official in Tehran said it may he as much
as three months before the parliament debates
the hostage issue.
White House press secretary Jody Powell
labeled as inaccurate a Boston Globe report
yesterday that the United States has told its
allies and Iran that it is ready to stage a naval
blockade if the hostage crisis isn't settled by the
week of May I I. The newspaper said Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance pl;ins to visit European
nations that week to discuss such a move.
Powell told reporters that no decision on a
possible blockade or similar move "has been
taken or communicated."
However, it is known that a blockade or the
mining of Iranian oil ports has been considered
by the administration.
In Tehran, the rush to stock up on basic
items, already in short supply, is clear evidence
that the boycott, while perhaps not being

enough to bring the revolutionary government
to its knees, is causing real concern among
Iranians,
Under a combined impact of revolutionary
turmoil and disruption of traditional trade
links, Iran's economy already is bogged down
in the mire of a post-revolutionary chaos that
has produced shortages, skyrocketing prices
and a thriving smuggling business from other
Persian Gulf countries.
The Iranian government is talking a brave
game, but it also displayed signs of concern
when it asked ministries and government or
ganizations this week to economize in the use
of computers and to "introduce manual sys
tems" instead.
"Until last week we were receiving parts and
certain materials from the Paris office of IBM,"
an Iranian manager complained. "Now every
thing is stopped and we can't get computer
spares from anywhere else."
Much of Iran'soil pipeline network, distribu

tion of electricity and hanking system is run
with the aid of U .S.-supplied computers, many
of them made by IBM.
There are no indications thus far that wider
trade sanctions by European allies or
Washington's blockade of Iranian ports would
cripple the economy.
But the prospect of such actions is clearly
worrying Iranian economic planners since even
the limited U.S. trade embargo currently in
effect is beginning to take its toll.
The economy, according to analysts in
Tehran, is a virtual standstill despite massive
oil revenue now running at a rate of $23 billion
annually.
"People don't work in this country, they just
use the oil money," an Iranian said.
The already low productivity, he added, has
been exacerbated by the "infiltration" of
workers' councils in \ arious enterprises by lef
tists seeking to "sabotage the production pro
cess."

the hostage issue.
White House press secretary Jody Powell
labeled as inaccurate a Boston Globe report
yesterday that the United States has told its
allies and Iran that it is ready to stage a naval
blockade if the hostage crisis isn't settled by the
week of May I I. The newspaper said Secretary
of State Cyrus Vance pl;ins to visit European
nations that week to discuss such a move.
Powell told reporters that no decision on a
possible blockade or similar move "has been
taken or communicated."
However, it is known that a blockade or the
mining of Iranian oil ports has been considered
by the administration.
In Tehran, the rush to stock up on basic
items, already in short supply, is clear evidence
that the boycott, while perhaps not being

enough to bring the revolutionary government
to its knees, is causing real concern among
Iranians,
Under a combined impact of revolutionary
turmoil and disruption of traditional trade
links, Iran's economy already is bogged down
in the mire of a post-revolutionary chaos that
has produced shortages, skyrocketing prices
and a thriving smuggling business from other
Persian Gulf countries.
The Iranian government is talking a brave
game, but it also displayed signs of concern
when it asked ministries and government or
ganizations this week to economize in the use
of computers and to "introduce manual sys
tems" instead.
"Until last week we were receiving parts and
certain materials from the Paris office of IBM,"
an Iranian manager complained. "Now every
thing is stopped and we can't get computer
spares from anywhere else."
Much of Iran'soil pipeline network, distribu

tion of electricity and hanking system is run
with the aid of U .S.-supplied computers, many
of them made by IBM.
There are no indications thus far that wider
trade sanctions by European allies or
Washington's blockade of Iranian ports would
cripple the economy.
But the prospect of such actions is clearly
worrying Iranian economic planners since even
the limited U.S. trade embargo currently in
effect is beginning to take its toll.
The economy, according to analysts in
Tehran, is a virtual standstill despite massive
oil revenue now running at a rate of $23 billion
annually.
"People don't work in this country, they just
use the oil money," an Iranian said.
The already low productivity, he added, has
been exacerbated by the "infiltration" of
workers' councils in \ arious enterprises by lef
tists seeking to "sabotage the production pro
cess."
From tlje Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter may order further
retaliatory moves against Iran today but will
not consider military action to free Americans
held hostage in Tehran until after mid-May, a
top aide said yesterday.
The aide, who declined to he quoted by
name, indicated that a Carter announcement of
new economic and diplomatic sanctions would
come soon — perhaps in time for a nationally
broadcast news conference tentatively
scheduled for today.
The source also said the U.S. government
has told its allies that Iran should have ample
time by mid-May to respond to the sanctions
Carter ordered last week, which included the
severing of diplomatic relations with the
Tehran regime.
Though the Iranian government has taken a
nonchalant attitude toward the imposition of
full-scale U.S. economic sanctions, a growing
anxiety among the Iranian people is being re

flected daily in Tehran in the growing lines in
front of supermarkets and butcher shops.
If the I ran'• response to the sanctions is not
positive. *' ..ide said, the allies will be asked to
carry out additional non-military steps aimed
at increasing pressure on Iran to free the 50
Americans who have been held hostage since
the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized on Nov.
4.
He emphasized that each ally would not
necessarily he expected to adopt identical sanc
tions or to impose all the sanctions put in place
by the United States.
Because of what amounted to a U.S.-
imposed mid-May deadline for an Iranian re
sponse to pressure being exerted by
Washington, the White Houseoffieial said con
sideration of any military moves against Iran
would wait until after then.
Iranian revolutionary leader Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini has said the fate of the
hostages will be decided by a new Iranian parli

ament. which may not he selected by the mid
dle of May.
One official in Tehran said it may he as much
as three months before the parliament debates
the hostage issue.
