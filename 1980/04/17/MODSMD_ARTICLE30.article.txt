# Aspen cracks down on drugs
## 
### S.J. Guffey The Associated Press 
ASPEN, Colo. — Tucked up
the Roaring Fork Valley 130
miles west of Denver, Aspen has
always been a place where you
could go to get away from the
rest of the world.
For quite a while now, state
and federal authorities have eon
tended it is also a place where
people can escape the drug laws
enforced elsewhere in the na
tion, a place where cocaine and
other drugs are transferred and
distributed.
And for almost as long, the au
thorities have objected to the at
titudes of Pitkin County Sheriff
Richard Kienast, a philosopher
turned lawman who has refused
to cooperate with undercover
narcotics investigations.
Grand jury
For six months, a federal
grand jury in Denver heard tes
timony about Kienast. his de
partment and allegations that the
sheriff deliberately tipped drug
dealers to an impending federal
raid last summer.
Thegrand jury was believed to
be investigating the entire
sheriffs department and several
other public officials. Last week.

it indicted a former deputy on a
felony,charge of distributing
cocaine.
FBI Special Agent Cliff
Browning said the investigation
would be renewed with another
grand jury within the month.
"You don't expect me to give
up." Browning said." That's just
the beginning."
Beautiful Aspen
Aspen's a beautiful backdrop
for such an ugly battle.
The Victorian frame homes of
its miningera now have six-figure
price tags, and the business of its
four nearby mountains has
turned from silver to skiing, mak
ing it a plush Rocky Mountain
resort.
Three years ago. the people
who live amid the mountains sur
rounding Aspen elected Kienast
their sheriff.
Kienast, a taller version of
actor Richard Dreyfuss. holds a
master's degree in philosophy
and theology from Notre Dame.
In his campaign, he used a poster
of a dove floating above a quota
tion from Thoreau: "Let everv
man make known what kind of
government would command his
respect and that will be one step
toward obtaining it."

From that, he was tagged
•"Dick Dove."
He is not, he says, a dove on
drug use — particularly cocaine,
which he calls "a very dangerous
drug."
He also says. "Sure, I can be
fairly certain that it (cocaine use)
is going on in Aspen, hut I aiso
don't think there's any way to
deal with it. Society's doing it,
not Aspen."
In Denver, on the other side of
the Continental Divide, Chief
U.S. District Judge Fred Winner
has been heard to warn drug de
fendants to tell their friends that
•"Aspen is a part of the United
States" and subject to its laws.
The original allegation involv
ing Kienast stemmed from a
news conference July 31. 1979, a
week before the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration
culminated a seven-month drug
investigation with the arrests of
32 alleged dealers in Aspen.
Basalt. Carbondale and Glen
wood Springs.
Pressed by reporters about
whether the DEA was about to
make drug arrests in the area,
Kienast said the DEA had told
him it was not doing any investi
gation in Pitkin County.
