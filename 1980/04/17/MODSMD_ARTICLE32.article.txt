## Cap and Gown raises funds 
### Mary Haber Staff Writer 
Since its start in 1907, Cap and Gown has pro
vided the University with a "tradition of service
that varies from year to year depending on the
University's needs," said Gene C'oblentz, coor
dinator of the organization's student members and
alu mm.
Cap and Gown is an all-women's "honorary ser
vice group." according to the group's president,
Sally Scandalios. Its major function is to raise
money lor scholarships and charities and to help
organize university activities.
The group's first project back in the early I 900s
was to build a clubhouse, now the left wing of Old
Union. Today the group supports one full and two
partial scholarships through the sale of calendars,
and carries out many activities throughout the
year.
I his year thegroup helped organize Rediscover
ing Stanford, an alumni program held during Big
Game weekend. Coblentz remarked that, "Meet
ing and talking with the students was the highlight
of the visit for many alums."
According to Barbara Skinner, first vice
president in charge of activities, the project was so
successful that the group plans to make it an annual
event.
For its spring project Cap and Gown plans to
co-sponsor a Greek evening with the Phi Delta
Theta fraternity. Proceeds will go to the Children's
Hospital.
Food and all other items for the event have been
provided by local merchants so that the entrance
charge "should he pure profit." Skinner said.
Along with their fundraising programs this year.

Cap and Gown members have enjoyed an occa
sional study break, a tour through the Rodin collec
tion led by Albert Hlsen. acting chairman of the Art
Department, and meetings with alumni. They plan
a spring luncheon with former Cap and Gown
members.
These functiorts are all funded by alumni mem
bership dues.
Women join the gfnup for many reasons. Skin
ner said. She explained that she became a member
"to become more involved in Stanford activities."
Scandalios said people encouraged her to join
and added that at iirst she knew very little about
the organization but as she went through the appli
cation process she became "impressed at the
favorable things to do."
"It is a really good opportunity for girls to be
bound together and it offers you the opportunities
to do things you wouldn't normally do." she said.
Vet both Scandalios and Skinner stress that Cap
and Gown is not like a sorority.
"The emphasis is really different." said Skinner.
"Our goals are to get involved in activities and
fundraising." Both noted that sororities have a
much more social emphasis.
Cap and Gown has approximately 50 student
members, the majority of whom are seniors. How
ever, the organization is open to juniors as well,
and the group is currently looking for new mem
bers. Applications are available in the Italian
House and are due tomorrow.
According to Skinner the application involves
little more than listing past extra curricular ac
tivities.
"We just want to make sure people will be willing
to put in time." she said.
