WASHINGTON — Challenging "conventional
wisdom," a group of researchers in the educational
field said yesterday that U.S. college enrollment
can be held steady or even increased slightly during
the 1980s.
Education experts have been forecasting for
years an enrollment drop because of the declining
number of I 8-year-olds in the population, with the
projected loss of 797,000 full-time students bet
ween 1980 and I 990.
But a report from the American Council on
Education told college officials that if they put their
minds to it, they could turn a losing proposition
into a winning one.
The council's chief economist. Carol Frances,
said the report. College Enrollment: Testing the
Conventional Wisdom Against the Facts was de
signed to combat "overactive pessimism" among
educators.
The optimistic possibility in the report that full
time enrollment could rise by 1.098.000. a 3.5
percent increase by 1990. was based on "alterna
tive strategies" that included:

—An increase in the number of high school
graduates that would give colleges 135.000 more
students by 1990.
— Raise the number of 20-to-30-year-old
women in college. It those in this age group at
tended college at the same rate as their male coun
terparts. full-time enrollment would jump
689.000.
—Enroll more adults of both sexes 25 and over.
Because of the increasing adult population, this
could turn up an additional 352.000 full-time stu
dents.
—Continue to enroll more foreign students, with
a target of an additional 204.000 in 1990 over
those in school in 1980.
Frances said these and other strategies, such as
recruiting more working students, have been either
"discounted or overlooked' by America's colleges
which have a 1980 full-time enrollment of
8,688.000.
The report also challenged a series of ' conven
tional wisdoms." noting that enrollment in black
colleges is up. not down, and that enrollment at
women's colleges is holding "reasonably steady at
just over 90,000."
