## Windham Hills Will Ackerman Guitar impressions, impressionism 
### 
With three highly acclaimed
albums. The Search for the Tur
tle'' Navel, It lakes a Year and
Childhood and Memory. Wil
liam Ackerman is considered by
many to be the finest steel-string
guitarist playing today.
Besides writing and recording
music. Ackerman also runs his
own independent label — Win
dham Hill Records — which is
based in Palo Alto. The label fea
tures such artists as Robbie
Basho and Ale\ DeGrassi. Al
ready having released nine al
bums. Ackerman plans on five
more from Windham Hill before
the year ends. Spirit of the Wind,
a film which won awards at both
the Cannes and the U.S. film fes
tivals. features a soundtrack by
Ackerman which should be re
leased soon. Daily writer Charles
Buckley interviewed Ackerman.
a former Stanford student last
week. Ackerman will play at the
New Varsity 2 p.m. this Sunday.
Daily : How would you describe
vour music to those w ho might he
interested in attending the Sunday
show, hut who have not heard
your music before?
Ackerman: There's a critic with
a maga/ine called Texas Jaz:
who described it as "guitar im
pressionism;" it's a little preten
tious to say but. frankly. I think
it's the best description I've
heard. It's \isual. dra natic sort
of stuff: acoustic guitar which is
all instrumental. A lot of people
who hear it. but are ignorant of
the various guitar disciplines, re
gard it as sort of classical, but I do
not. What Robbie Basho wanted
to do years and years ago was to
define a classical discipline for
steel-string guitar, which had al
ways been a folk instrument, and
I think that's part of the discip
line we're in — trying to define a
classical discipline tor steel string
guitar.
Daily: Your first album, The
Search for the Turtle's Navel.
was named by HAM magazine as
the best new album of the year
when it w as released in 1976; was
that a surprise to you?
Ackerman: By that time, there
had been a number of favorable
reviews in RAM. hut I didn't

know that the album would be
listed as one of the top ones ot
the year The whole time we
were making Turtle, I knew I was
going to be doing a privately re
leased record, but I had nointen
tion to go beyond that; I cer
tainly had no idea I was going to
be starting a record companv.
Daily: What kind of audience did
you hope to reach with that first
album ?
Ackerman: You have to realize
that at the time, I hadn't con
ceived of any of this stuff; I was
just busy being a general con
tractor. It was simply a project
among friends, and I think it was
partly that naivete which blasted
the whole thing off. 1 was patient
enough to let it go where it
wanted to go; it pushed me. Be
fore you knew it. stations were
playing the album and stores
were buying it.
Daily: What led you to eventually
start the record company and to
record other artists?
Ackerman: You've done all this
work; you've made these con
tacts with radio; you've made
contacts with distributors and
stores, and so it really makes lit
tle sense to stop there. You're
almost forced to take advantage
of all the groundwork you've
done and to release another al
bum. Linda Waterfall, a former
Stanford art student who had
been over in London doing bac
kup work seemed like a logical
choice; I've always liked her
music and I've always liked
Linda. Her album did fairly well
and then we brought out my sec
ond album. It Takes a Year. The
other albums followed from
there.
Daily: Have you ever been temp
led just to shelve the business as
pect and concentrate simply on
playing music?
Ackerman: Why would you re
ally want to? The thing is that the
momentum is there; it keeps get
ting more and more exciting. The
mov ie Spirit of the Wind never
could have happened two years
ago. This whole thing with Sony
would have never happened two
vears aizo (Ackerman is referring

to a new digital recording
machine which Windham Hill
recently acquired from Sony —
the only one of its kind on the
West Coast.)
Daily: Could you briefly explain
digital recording, and why you
feel that it is such an important
advance for Windham Hill?
Ackerman: Right now. we have
the best recordings, best
ings. and best pressing available.
The sound quality of what we do
is incredible. We're trying to do
quality audiophile stuff, and this
new Sony equipment is a huge
boost to us. Because of the na
ture of the sound analysis and the
materials that are used, there is
completely no tape hiss, which
has been one of the main prob
lems with the multi-track record
ing we've done in the past.
Daily: A couple of years ago,
there was a rumor around that
you were going to quit playing
professionally and go back into
the contracting business. What's

tin story on that?
Ackerman: There are times
when the whole idea of business
and dealing with distributors gets
to you. and you want to get the
hell out. I've always enjoyed
contracting and it was pretty luc
rative: it's a good, healthy way to
make a living. What you have to
understand is that though I'm a
guitar player, at this point I'm
basically a businessman, sitting
at the telephone and sitting at the
typewriter. It's all in working on
my artist endorsement deal with
EV microphones and Guild
guitars, and hustling Sony for all
this new equipment, and (he rest
of it. It's a constant hustle, so
sometimes I'm tempted just to
go out and pound nails. I still say
to myself that someday I'm going
to biuJJ ft house, but at this point
I have to look at it realistically. I
think I've only pounded nails
about 10 days in the last two
years.
