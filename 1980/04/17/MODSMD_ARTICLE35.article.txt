# After the concert: A talk with the Ramones
## 
### 
A pri\ ileged crowd of 750 rock 'n' rol
led Sunday night at the keystone to the
music of national punk recording artists,
the Ramones. in the band's only Bay Area
nightclub appearance. The group brought
the house to its feet dancing to the beat of
their loud but wonderful!) infectious rock
n' roll. A surprisingly well-behaved
crowd, many were decked out in the com
pulsory punk attire and seemed no worse
for wear after a long wait in line for tickets
that only became available on the day of
the show.
Backstage after the concert, pan
demonium prevails. The Ramones. vari
ous hangers-on and technical types all sit
in one room recovering from the rigors of
the show. Drummer Tommy and guitarist
Johnny Ramone sit on a sofa accom
panied by se\ eral outrageous women who
look like Deborah Harry-bleach outs
gone grossly amok.
Lead singer Joey Ramone nurses a root
beer. East Coast pasty face with long
stringy black hair and rose-colored glas
ses. he looks about ft' 2" and I 10 lbs. Joey
is not exactly a textbook example of nor
malcy. hut he doesn't come off as the
alienated, butt-kicking punk rocker
either. As a matter of fact, he's a real

sweetheart, talkative and friendly.
Although the group is riding a wave ol
national recognition. Joey claims they
aren't at all disillusioned by success. Nor
has success sapped the band's unique vit
ality.
"We love what we're doing. That's why
we're doing it. We still work every day -
drive every day. We're successful 'cos
we're good and we work harder than any
body else.
The payoff is. of course, the fans, says
Joey.
Joey knows his audience. "That's what
rock n' roll is all about. Kids go to a show
toget loose. You go toget all your frustra
tions and aggressions out. Then you are
fulfilled, like you've seen something.
"That's what keeps us going. The reac
tion from the fans makes us want to give
them all that much more. I.ike after a
show we're beat, drained. The fans know
it and they appreciate us for it. That's why
we're successful' —'cos we're great.
Joey says the band is enjoying the cur
rent tour. C alifornia is like a second home
after New York, though he disputes the
fact that Palo Alto is paradise on earth.
After the Bay area the band heads for
Seattle. Vancouver and. ves. Poeatello.

Idaho.
.locs says he appreciates the challenge
of playing in the hinterlands. "It's like a
breath ot fresh air compared to all those
kids brainwashed by the radio stations.
Not like the ones who listen to nothing but
Foreigner. Kansas. Styx. Genesis. Pink
Floyd and Toto.
"Radio when it started was meant to
discover new talent. Radio was exciting
back in the '60s before everything got into
ratings and big business. It was just get
ting turned on to the Beach Boys, the
Zombies and the Beatles and it was al
ways so exciting . . .
"That's the reason the Ramones got
started back in "74. toget back to the kind
of rock ' n" roll that got lost i 11 the polished
hea\y metal jams of the late '60s.
"Radio turned into big drum solos and
everyone had a high voice saying. 'Come
on let's rock and roll and we're going to
get uptight.' That's not rock n' roll —
that's bullshit.
"Our message to kids is to do it. Pick up
a guitar and play it. That's rock n' roll.
Hlv is wasn't playing for 20 years. . . You
don't have to be Jimmy Page or go to
Julliard to play guitar."
Joev has clear ideas on what the music

of the Ramones moans to its audience.
"Our songs happen to be great and to be
top-ranked lyrics. None ot these shitty
lyrics about being hot-blooded' and
wanting to dance or this new one we've
been hearing by this Pat Travers guy
about snorting cocaine and drinking
whiskey.
"Back in the early days you could get
off on the lyrics. I mean I don't know how
kids can relate to lyrics like The Wall. It's
going to take awhile but people are start
ing to think for themseK cs. They're start
ing to say. I'm sick of being brainwashed
by what the radio wants me to hear.' "
The Ramones' plans include an upcom
ing tour of fiurope. Australia and Japan.
The Ramones are also doing a "tape-in"
for the Slui No Na television show wheh
will he aired May 19 on independent sta
tions across the country.
Joey's final words are a tribute to the
loyalty and rectitude ol the Ramones'
fans.
"Our tans are the best ol anybody's.
Ilicv are dedicated to us and they are not
sloppy. They don't go to sleep on
Quaaludes or pass out on whiskey."
