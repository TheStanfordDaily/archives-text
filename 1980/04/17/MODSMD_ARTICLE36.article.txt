# Crawford and the Crusaders
## 
### 
Eruption of a great volcano of
music and energy by Randy
Crawford and the Crusaders
seemed certain during their
Saturday show here, especially
as the show went on. But after
some small, though exciting,
tremors, the great figures let its
viewers know that they would
have to come hack some other
time to see its biggest explosions.
Randy Crawford opened the
evening's concert. Gifted with a
classic jazz voice, Crawford can
melt you with a whispering bal
lad or belt you with a bellowing
up-tempo tune. She is a sym
phony unto herself, often chang

ing beat and rhythm after lulling
you into a comfortable listening
pattern.
Crawford's performance was
especially laudable as she had to
overcome a weak band and the
terrible accoustics of Maples
Pa\ illion.
After a lengthy break. The
Crusaders, with some special
guests, took to the stage. There
were the original three Crusad
ers. Stix Hooper. Wilton Felder.
and Joe Sample, playing drums,
saxes, and keyboards, respec
tively. Also appearing were
Airto. the Brazilian percus
sionist. and Phil Upchurch. a

prolific studio guitarist.
There were two particular
points during the concert when it
seemed as it the volcano was
going to erupt. One of these
peaks was when Sample
switched from synthesizer to a
concert grand piano and played a
couple of tunes from his "C'ar
mel'* album. He started off by
soloing and soon after the band
joined in as accompaniment. But
this was Sample's moment from
start to finish and with total
eloquence he made the most ol
it. He is much more at home
playing acoustic and he is a much
more dynamic force. When he

played the synthesizer, there
were times that he seemed to get
lost in the music.
When Sample plays the con
cert grand. The Crusaders are at
their best and he hopes that in
the future he will only be playing
acoustic. "I'd like to leave the
synthesizer playing." he says."to
the guys who really like to do it.
Ultimately. 'ITie Crusaders are
going toget around to just acous
tic piano on the concert dates."
Near the end of the show the
second big tremor took place.
Out trom the shadow of the stage
came Randy Crawford with that
gorgeous smile. Inspired by and

inspiring the band. Crawford led
the finest portion ot the show,
singing the song "Street Life"
from the Crusaders' most recent
album of the same name. Craw
ford. this time with a legitimate
band behind her, was driven to a
po we rfu I pe rfi >rmance.
Sample and Crawford were
the two most exciting performers
of the evening. One readily for
got about the acoustics when
they played and instead strained
to hear every note they released.
The rest of the band was good
but not great. I elder played in
his usual solid manner and both

Airto and Hooper had their
moments. I'hil Upchurch. how
ex er. was lost and didn't do much
all evening.
When it looked like the vol
cano was ready to burst after
Crawford raised the perform
ance to its greatest peak, the
Crusaders left the stage. A re
sponse c audience got them hack
for an encore, hut they weren't
up to the task and they played a
short and uninspired tune. The
audience had seen a good show,
hut they had really wanted to see
the volcano explode.
