# 'Duck's Breath' funny
## 
### 
To many at Stanford, the com
edy troupe of outer-landish
slapstick satire called "Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre" needs
no introduction. To others, the
name will, at first, slide awk
wardly off the tongue and will
hence become an insomniac's
mantra. Pease he enlightened,
grasshoppers: this collective of
hyperactive zanies, known out
side their hills and feathers as
Dan Coffey, Merle Kessler,
Leon Martell, Bill Allard and
Jim Turner, inspires laughter to
the point of breathlessness. The
"mystery" in the name refers
only to their enigmatic ability to
steer clear of television specials
and megabuck movie offers after
five years of fraying even the
most well-knotted of lunatic
fringes.
Last Thursday night, "Duck's
Breath" — as they are known to
their friends — opened a two
week stand at the Boarding
House in San Francisco. The
show is organized with an almost
disheartening degree of struc
ture. Egad, there is even a con
ventional 2()-minute intermis
sion.
The first half of the show in
corporates some of the group's
older sketches with more recent
tidbits. Kicking off with "Six
People From Six Countries," a
cultural revue of never-before
seen fertility dances accom
panied by soliloquies in foreign
accents of unknown origins, the
set rarely allows the audience to
calmly sip those expensive
drinks. Amid hysterical laughter
and spewed sprays of Irish cof
fee, the Duck Breathers mer
cilessly perform "More Than
Just a Baby" a to K-tel, "Old
Mac Donald Had a Farm in
E(LE.1.0)." and a parody of an
Ingmar Bergman film, among
other high-energy endeavors.
Comic timing and rapid-fire
delivery warp into a new dimen
sion during a brilliant version of
"King Richard 11," which will
win over anyone who has en
dured a Shakespeare history.
Cartoonist Bill Griffith's irrep
ressible "Zippy the Pinhead" is
brought to life for the finale ol
the first act. In this spectacular
skit of nearly epic proportions.
Zippy is elected president after
an unorthodox campaign in

which he wanders through the
audience kissing arms and shak
ing heads. John Anderson may
take firm stands on the issues,
but Zippy has the telling advan
tage in not knowing what issues
look like, let alone how to get to
the stand.
Unsubtle political commen-'
tary abounds during Zippy's suc
cinctly portrayed term of office,
and the sketch becomes a verita
ble Pinhead's "Being There,"
which gives this theme the integ
rity of the presentation the film
so lacked.
I he second act features one
plotted, semi-coherent show en
titled "Gonad the Barbarian,"
the heart-rendering tale of
Gonad, a warrior described as
"standing on the edge of
thought." who rambles through
a series of adventures in his quest
for a Kitchen Magician (patent
pending) in the post-apocalyptic
world ol the future. With his
minstrel sidekick. Ho Don,
Gonad manages to tangle with
zombie panhandlers, barbaric
rug salesmen conventioneers
and radiation-scarred Holiday
Innkeepers without learning a
thing about life or the world.
Ihe costumes for the show,
exquisitely designed in the
thrift-shop mode (with subtle
nuances of Salvation Army sen
sibilities). keenly define the un
dercurrent sense of burnt-out
Americana that runs throughout
the hour-long episode.
As a result of its length and the
confines inherent in plot,
"Gonad" is not quite as funny us
Duck Breath's shorter bits. Yet
the show towers magnificently as
a monument to the group's great
comic strength, the ability to
straddle passionately the thin
line between satiric commentary
(Gonad's Travels with Charley)
and utter nonsense (jello
hampsters turn to chihuahuas
and spit tiny spears and scalding
hot coffee one hars ax uffer
diddley womp womp womp!?).
The energy required to sustain
the comic spell of "Gonad" is
intense, and after the helter
skelter performances of the first
act, one can only wonder at the
incredible endurance involved in
this 2'/2-hour clubhouse
sandwich of gourmet silliness.

The energy required to sustain
the comic spell of "Gonad" is
intense, and after the helter
skelter performances of the first
act, one can only wonder at the
incredible endurance involved in
this 2'/2-hour clubhouse
sandwich of gourmet silliness.

Gonad the Barbarian and a friend


Sheridan's lKth century comedy, Tlic Rivals, opens Friday, April 25 at 8 p.m. at the Man
hattan Playhouse.
To many at Stanford, the com
edy troupe of outer-landish
slapstick satire called "Duck's
Breath Mystery Theatre" needs
no introduction. To others, the
name will, at first, slide awk
wardly off the tongue and will
hence become an insomniac's
mantra. Pease he enlightened,
grasshoppers: this collective of
hyperactive zanies, known out
side their hills and feathers as
Dan Coffey, Merle Kessler,
Leon Martell, Bill Allard and
Jim Turner, inspires laughter to
the point of breathlessness. The
"mystery" in the name refers
only to their enigmatic ability to
steer clear of television specials
and megabuck movie offers after
five years of fraying even the
most well-knotted of lunatic
fringes.
Last Thursday night, "Duck's
Breath" — as they are known to
their friends — opened a two
week stand at the Boarding
House in San Francisco. The
show is organized with an almost
disheartening degree of struc
ture. Egad, there is even a con
ventional 2()-minute intermis
sion.
The first half of the show in
corporates some of the group's
older sketches with more recent
tidbits. Kicking off with "Six
People From Six Countries," a
cultural revue of never-before
seen fertility dances accom
panied by soliloquies in foreign
accents of unknown origins, the
set rarely allows the audience to
calmly sip those expensive
drinks. Amid hysterical laughter
and spewed sprays of Irish cof
fee, the Duck Breathers mer
cilessly perform "More Than
Just a Baby" a to K-tel, "Old
Mac Donald Had a Farm in
E(LE.1.0)." and a parody of an
Ingmar Bergman film, among
other high-energy endeavors.
Comic timing and rapid-fire
delivery warp into a new dimen
sion during a brilliant version of
"King Richard 11," which will
win over anyone who has en
dured a Shakespeare history.
Cartoonist Bill Griffith's irrep
ressible "Zippy the Pinhead" is
brought to life for the finale ol
the first act. In this spectacular
skit of nearly epic proportions.
Zippy is elected president after
an unorthodox campaign in

which he wanders through the
audience kissing arms and shak
ing heads. John Anderson may
take firm stands on the issues,
but Zippy has the telling advan
tage in not knowing what issues
look like, let alone how to get to
the stand.
Unsubtle political commen-'
tary abounds during Zippy's suc
cinctly portrayed term of office,
and the sketch becomes a verita
ble Pinhead's "Being There,"
which gives this theme the integ
rity of the presentation the film
so lacked.
I he second act features one
plotted, semi-coherent show en
titled "Gonad the Barbarian,"
the heart-rendering tale of
Gonad, a warrior described as
"standing on the edge of
thought." who rambles through
a series of adventures in his quest
for a Kitchen Magician (patent
pending) in the post-apocalyptic
world ol the future. With his
minstrel sidekick. Ho Don,
Gonad manages to tangle with
zombie panhandlers, barbaric
rug salesmen conventioneers
and radiation-scarred Holiday
Innkeepers without learning a
thing about life or the world.
Ihe costumes for the show,
exquisitely designed in the
thrift-shop mode (with subtle
nuances of Salvation Army sen
sibilities). keenly define the un
dercurrent sense of burnt-out
Americana that runs throughout
the hour-long episode.
As a result of its length and the
confines inherent in plot,
"Gonad" is not quite as funny us
Duck Breath's shorter bits. Yet
the show towers magnificently as
a monument to the group's great
comic strength, the ability to
straddle passionately the thin
line between satiric commentary
(Gonad's Travels with Charley)
and utter nonsense (jello
hampsters turn to chihuahuas
and spit tiny spears and scalding
hot coffee one hars ax uffer
diddley womp womp womp!?).
The energy required to sustain
the comic spell of "Gonad" is
intense, and after the helter
skelter performances of the first
act, one can only wonder at the
incredible endurance involved in
this 2'/2-hour clubhouse
sandwich of gourmet silliness.
