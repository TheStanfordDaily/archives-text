# 'Pippin' from the inside out
## 
### 
At the end of the show. Pippin decides that he is "happy . . .
which isn't too bad for the end of a musical comedy." Jodi S
' Corwin hopes that a little of Pippin's happiness w ill ruh off on his
Stanford audiences.
Corwin is the director of Pippin, the light rock musical comedy
. which Ram's Head will present April 23-26 in Memorial Au- '
ditorium.
The musical is based loosely on the life ol Charlemagne's
eldest son Pepin (Pippin). Fresh out of college and dissatisfied ,
[ with life, Pippin undertakes a quest for self-fulfillment. He finds
that altruistic fulfillment is an internal, spiritual quality — which
only can be experienced in death, for which he is not ready.
"The show really has a magical element to it." Corwin said, j
5 "It's got an element of non-reality, an element of the Wizard of
Oz." She added that Pippin's set. designed by Scooter Mitchell,
contributes to this magical setting because of its striking lines
and dynamic appearance. J
' "1 think the students who go see Pippin will really enjoy it
because of its choreography and set." Corwin said." It will be an
exciting show to look at. . . . bingest light show ever in Mem
5 Aud. :
"It combines some good serious content with some equally
good music," Corwin said. Ram's Head chose Pippin because its
contemporary feel (it opened on Broadway in the early '70s).
» "People thought it was time for a change" — it would challenge '
college students while still providing them with "high entertain
ment," she said.
"We wanted to get away from the standard productions like,
| '50s musicals and similar things that has e been presented in the *
past."
The choreography sets the show apart from other productions
with which she has been involved. Corwin said. Choreography j
5 will be a vital component of the show not only because every cast
member does some dancing but also because each scene relies
heaviFy upon dance to convey its message.
"Rather than work up some neat little dance pattern for each J
' scene, we tried to think about the message of the show and how
we could relate the dancing and movement to the meaning of the
scene," choreographer Eric Hoit said. Pippin's choreography
, differs from that of past productions including last year's Kiss 3
' Me, Kate because it is not restricted by a need to stay true to a
certain time period, he added.
"We can say a lot more through dance with this show than we
5 could last year." Hoit said. "We've been able to add some
bizarre twists and various types of distorted imagery w hieh have
helped tie down our ideas to each scene."
ITie leads are played by Marty Moran as Pippin and Michael j
[Myers as the Leading Player, who guides the prince on his quest
for self-fulfillment. Both appeared in last year's Ram's Head
production Gaieties '78.
Because its production budgets are larger than those of most 3
[other Stanford-based companies. Ram's Head attracts more
talent. Corwin said.
She added that "This has been the most unusual cast I've ever
worked with. It has been a far more positive experience than 3
' anything else I've done."
Tickets for next week's performances are on sale at the Tre
sidder box office. !
