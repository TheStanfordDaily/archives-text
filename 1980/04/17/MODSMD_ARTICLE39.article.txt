# 'The Serial'
## Not liked in Kansas either 
### 
They didn't like the Serial in
Kansas. I'm not sure they like it
in Palo Alto either.
Well, it was 10:30 Sunday
night, in less-than-bustling Palo
Alto, but still, an audience ol
fewer than 10 people is embar
rassing. We were the only ones
who ever laughed. And all three
of us are from the movie's
much-maligned anil much
mocked state of California.
It wasn't all that bad. really
There are some funny lines in
Paramount's Serial—a satire on
the crazy inhabitants of trendy
Marin County. The parodies,
often overdone, occasionally hit
just right. The town shrink
Leonard (Peter Boner/—he was
the dentist on "The Bob
Newhart Show" ) dispenses
Quaaludes and advises ev ervone
to "mellow out." His therapv
consists of bored nods and em
phatic repetitions of the last
words a patient utters. And his
only gut-level response occurs
when a patient confesses
"money troubles."
Sharing with Leonard that 1 s
tablishment concern for getting
paid is hip minister Spike
Thurston (Tom Smothers).
Spike acts the quintessential
flake. His message is love and
togetherness—as long as that

paycheck is forthcoming.
The conversation is
unbeliev able—a parody of a
parody. Did they really talk like
that in the '60s? Rap. cool, need
some space, dialogue, power
perimeters, and avoiding "too
much rage." Talk about limited
\ oeabularies.
Portions of the movie are so
ludicrous you have to laugh to
keep from groaning. The teen
age supermarket clerk vehe
mently protests the attempt by
star Harvey Holroyd (Martin
Mull) tii purchase non-organic
foodstuffs with dangerous and
unhealthy ingredients. She gets
fired for her tirades so in sym
pathy and lust Harvey offers to
buy her a cup of coffee. But cof
fee is bad for the body. So is al
cohol. What can he offer? She
brightly responds that they
should just go home and go to
bed together. Who needs pre
liminaries?
There are orgies and hot tubs
and air-bondings (people don't
just get married anymore you
know ) and gay motorcycle gangs
and love cults and
consciousness-raising groups
and fads and trends and you
name it.
Harvev. the uptight pro

tagonist. gets most of the audi
ence sympathy simply because
he seems sort of normal and ra
tional. At the first pair-bonding,
between much-married Martha
(Sally kellerman) and her-is
-11 -si\ th husband, the groom's
part of the vows include the
statement "I'm an asshole."
Three-piece suited Harvey
gasps disgustedly. "so gas is over
SI a gallon and it's Ok to be an
asshole."
The other normal (or trying to
be normal) character is Martha's
kid Stokeley (Anthony Battag
lia). Leonard the shrink tries to
help him get in touch with him
self and his body with a tov turd.
Stokeley thinks it's dumb. Can
you blame him?
The Theme song is awfully
sappy—' It's a Changing
World." That's the message
we're supposed to get.
According to the producers,
viewers are supposed to see a
"great deal of each of us in the
outrageous and sympathetic
people of Serial." Maybe. But as
my friend gasped. "I hope they
don't show this mov ie anywhere
but California—everyone al
ready thinks we're weird." I'd
like to believe we're not quite
that strange.
