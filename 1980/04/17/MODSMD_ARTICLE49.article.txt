Kennedy seeks labor support
PITTSBURGH —Sen. Edward Kennedy, vowing
he's in the presidential race "right up until the roll
call," campaigned for labor support in this hard hat
city yesterday hoping it might carry him past Presi
dent Jimmy Carter in Pennsylvania's approaching
Democratic primary.
With the election less than a week away, Kennedy
has lined up more labor backing in the heavily
industrial state than Carter, having wooed the blue
collar vote with his pro-union voting record in the
Senate and his wage and price control proposals.
In the Republican race, frontrunner Ronald
Reagan picked up the endorsement of 17 of New
Jersey's 21 GOP county chairmen yesterday before
flying to Philadelphia to begin only his second day of
campaigning in a primary he appears to have wrap
ped up.
New Jersey will send 66 delegates to the GOP
National Convention in July and Ray Donovan.
Reagan's New Jersey campaign co-chairman, said
yesterday's endorsements translate into at least 60
delegates for the former California governor.
The endorsements were a significant but not unex
pected setback for former U.N. Ambassador George
Bush, who has been stumping hard in Pennsylvania
for more than a week in an effort too\ ertake Reagan.
Chase bank cuts interest rates
NEW YORK — A major bank reduced its prime
lending rate yesterday for the first time this year and
some economists said the decline, as well as a drop in
other interest rates, confirmed that a recession was
under way.
The bond market, which had been going down as
interest rates went up. staged what was apparently
the largest one-day rally in its history.
Chase Manhattan Bank lowered the prime rate —
the interest eharged to its best corporate customers —
from 20 percent to 19 3 /4 percent. It was the first
reduction for that bank since Nov. 27. Some smaller
banks reduced their prime rate to as low as 1 8 3 a
percent.
"There is strong confirmation that the economy is
in a recession." said David Jones, an economist with
the Wall Street firm of Aubrey G. Lanston & Co..
pointing to government reports showing March de
clines in industrial production, retail sales and hous
ing starts.
A recession is expected to reduce the demand for
borrowed money and therefore lower interest rates.
Loan demand on banks has been strong recently, but
Donald Maude, an economist with Merrill Lynch
Government Securities, said some bankers reported
a softening in demand in the last week.
Henry Kaufman, chief economist of the in\ estment
banking firm of Salomon Brothers, said he thought
the peak in interest rates had been reached and the
economy was on the "precipice of another reces
sion."
NRC opens scrutiny on nuke site
LOS ANGELES — The Nuclear Regulatory
Commission yesterday began scrutinizing safety and
maintenance procedures at the San Onofre nuclear
power plant after nine workmen were contaminated
while trying to locate the source of a leak in a steam
generator.
NRC officials said the incident at the plant, about
75 miles southeast of Los Angeles, posed little danger
to the health of the workmen and no danger to the
general public. But they said it was odd for so many
workers to become contaminated at the same time.
"It's not necessarily unusual for people to come out
(from the containment area of the plant) and have
some contamination on them." explained Frank
Wenslawski, chief of the reactor radiation safety sec

tion of the NRC's western regional office.
"The radiation exposure they received from it is
fairly insignificant and nothing really to worry about.
But if nine people are contaminated all on the same
job. then we start ha\ mg questions about the adequ
acy of the radiological controls for that job — that is
how well they're attempting to control the contami
nation si) as to prevent this kind of thing from happen
ing."
Hans Oddoson. manager of nuclear operations for
Southern California Edison*owner of the plant, said
tht> amount of radiation the workers were exposed to
was well below NRC limits.
Home construction rate drops
WASHINGTON — The construction of new
homes plummeted 22 percent in March to the lowest
level since the 1974-75 recession, the Commerce
Department reported yesterday.
The news that housing starts had dropped to an
annual rate of just over 1 million units last month
came amid other signs that the long-predicted 1980
recession may be underway. Among them:
— At the Federal Reserve, economists reported
that U.S. manufacturers operated at only 83 percent
of capacity in March, a drop of 0.9 percentage points
from February and 4.1 percentage points from March
1979.
— On and around Capitol Hill, top government
officials said the slowdown had become obvious.
Nancy Teeters, a member of the Federal Reserve
Board, told a gathering of bankers that she thinks the
recession probably started in March or early April.
Meanwhile. Treasury Secretary G. William Miller
told a Senate finance subcommittee that he expected
interest rates to decline in the next several months as
the economy cools.
Miller predicted that the rate of increase in con
sumer prices — now at about an 18 percent annual
rate — probably would drop early next year to an
annual rate below 10 percent.
lOC considers focus of games
WASHINGTON — The Executive Board of the
International Olympic Committee (IOC) will con
sider next week proposals for de-emphasizing
nationalism at the Olympic Games, including possi
ble cancelation of opening and closing ceremonies at
this summer's Moscow Games.
However, the lOC presently has no plans to recon
sider postponement or cancelation of the July 19-
Aug. 3 games because of the continued Soviet milit
ary presence in Afghanistan, which may be the basis
of many nations staying away.
The nine-man Executive Board, which includes
one Soviet member, will meet April 21 to 23 at lOC
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. High on the
agenda is a review of the Moscow Games, which
could be boycotted by a substantial number of major
nations following the U.S. Olympic Committee's de
cision last weekend not to send a team.
President Jimmy Carter's call for a widespread
boycott appears to he gaining momentum in the wake
of the USOC's decision. Japan, West Germany and
Canada now seem almost certain to follow the U.S.
lead, while Great Britain and Australia are among
the countries whose governments are putting re
newed pressure on their athletes Jo bypass Moscow.

automakers this week were estimated at 205,000

Exxon is nation's largest corp.
NEW YORK —The big jumpin oil prices last year
helped push Exxon past General Motors as the na
tion's largest industrial corporation and left other oil
companies holding six of the top 10 spots. Fortune
magazine reported yesterday.

500 list for 1979, with sales of $79 billion compared
to GM's sales of $66 billion.
It was the fourth time in 25 years that Exxon had
surpassed CM in sales. But Exxon's sales advantage
of almost $13 billion was a much wider margin than
GM had ever held. Fortune reported in an advance
copy of its May 5 edition.
Among other shifts in the top positions. Mobil
Corp. took over the No. 3 position from Ford Motor
Co., which dropped to No. 4.
The 500 largest industrial companies reported
total sales of $1.4 trillion in 1979, an 18.6 percent
increase from 1978 sales and the largest gain in five
years.
Net income, bolstered by big jumps for the nation's
big oil companies, rose 27 percent to $78.2 billion.
That total was also larger than the 17 percent rise in
profits in 1978.

Leaders attend Zimbabwe birth
SALISBURY, Rhodesia — Prince Charles, the
heir to the British throne, arrived here yesterday to
officiate in the demise of the last British colony in
Africa, and in the rebirth of that colony as an inde
pendent black state. What was known as Rhodesia
will now be called Zimbabwe.

88-year-old diplomat Averill Harriman and includ
ing ex-U.N. Ambassador Andrew Young, also ar
rived, to represent President Jimmy Carter at the
independence ceremony.
At a press conference. Young, with typical candor,
said he believed neighboring South Africa "learned a
lesson from Zimbabwe" and will respond to internal
pressure from its black majority to moderate white
minority rule. Young said he hoped "external pres
sure" in the form of economic sanctions would not be
required.
Only South Africa, among the major African na
tions, is not invited to the ceremonies, in what is
regarded as an intentional snub by incoming Prime
Minister Robert Mugabe.

as heads of state, prime ministers and other high
officials from more than 90 nations arrived for the
independence ceremonies, which are to begin today
just before midnight and continue into tomorrow.
