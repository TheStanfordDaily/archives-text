# Begin, Sadat agree to speed talks
## 
### Norman Kempster The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — Israel and
Egypt agreed yesterday to a round of
"accelerated and intensified" negotia
tions to try to break the deadlock over
Palestinian autonomy and other sensi
tive issues before the May 26 target
date specified in their peace treaty.
But Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin made it clear that his
country was not prepared to com
promise any of its long-standing posi
tions just to beat the clock in talks that
he said could just as well drag on
beyond the planned deadline.
"We may reach that agreement by
that day," Begin told a press confer
ence. "If not, in my opinion, nothing
happens. We will continue to
negotiate."
Nevertheless, U.S. officials were
gratified that Begin and Egyptian Pres
ident Anwar Sadat had agreed to give a
high-level push to the stalled talks on
the emotionally charged issues of
Palestinian self-rule, Israeli settle
ments in occupied areas and voting
privileges for Arabs living in the sec

tion of Jerusalem that was controlled
by Jordan before the 1967 war.
Standing together on the White
House driveway in a chilly April wind,
Begin and President Jimmy Carter an
nounced that Israeli and Egyptian
negotiators would meet every day until
May 26. The talks will be held in Egypt
and Israel.
Carter and Begin agreed on the for
mula for the talks during two days of
meetings at the White House. Sadat
approved the plan in a cable.
It was Begin's idea to conduct the
negotiations in Egypt and Israel. Car
ter wanted the two sides to meet in
Washington, where he and Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance could serve as in
termediaries. and Sadat had accepted
Carter's proposal. But both Carter and
Sadat agreed yesterday to go along
with Begin's plan.
Although both Carter and Begin
spoke of 40 days of negotiations, giving
the plan a vaguely Biblical ring, it was
understood that the talks will not begin
for about 10 days, leaving only 30 days
before the May 26 target date.
Egypt and Israel agreed last year.

when they signed their ppace treaty,
that they would strive to settle the un
resolved issues within a year. But the
two sides have been unable to reaeh
agreement on the future of the ter
ritories Israel occupied during the
Six-Day War of 1967 or of the 1.2 mill
ion Palestinians who live there.
Also left unresolved is the political
status of the Palestinians who live in
East Jerusalem, the former A\rab sector
of the city, which Israel annexed in
1967. This is the most emotional issue,
because of the former Arab sector con
tains religious shrines revered by Chris
tians and Moslems as well as Jews. The
United States has never recognized Is
rael's annexation of East Jerusalem.
At his press conference at Blair
House, which was telecast live in Israel,
Begin reiterated his government's
hard-line position on all of the issues.
Both the United States and Egypt
have criticized Israel for authorizing
increased numbers of Jewish settle
ments in predominately Arab sections
of the West Bank of the Jordan River,
the most heavily populated of the oc
cupied territories.
