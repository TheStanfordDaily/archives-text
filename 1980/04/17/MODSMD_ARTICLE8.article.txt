## East Asian theme 'house' gets office

What began as excitement when 610
Mayfield Ave. was designated the East
Asian Studies theme house for next
year has turned into disappointment
for house a frustrated
request for office space.

!\'ews analysis

Members of the four-person prog
ram proposal core committee for the
"East House" learned last week that
they would have to wait at least a year
for a residence.
Alternative housing arrangements,
proposals suggested by the East Asian
Studies theme house core committee,
have met with disapproval by Dean of

Residential Education Norm Robin
son.
The only option seemingly able to be
approved is for the committee to find
office space somewhere in the Univer
sity.

In early March, the Office of Resi
dential Education told the group the
East Asian Studies house could occupy
thv'site of the current French house for
the academic year beginning in Sep
tember. The La Maison Francaise
program was judged sub-par by the
configuration panel of the Committee
on Student Services Subcommittee on
Residences (COSS/R).
However, Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said a procedural prob
lem, that the French house residents
were not aware their house was in
danger of being elimiated and then de

cided the French house could remain
for one probationary year.
The East House program has been
approved twice, last year and this year.
Because, following Lyons' decision the
group was still without a house, Robin
son offered the core committee a trailer
cluster in Man/anita Park as an interim
arrangement until 1982.
According to Lyons, the purpose of
the interim arrangement, was to devise
a way to keep the program alive until
1982, when the rebuilding of Storey
House and the addition of an 800-
person-capacity dormitory complex
next to Lagunita Court will be com
plete.
However committee members said
that option would not provide an
adequate sense of community nor
would it offer proper program and
facilities.
In turn, the committee counter
proposed that they be given either a
house in the Cowell cluster, a wing in
Toyon Hall, or some rooms on the third
floor of Toyon that currently operate
separately from the rest of the dorm,
according to committee member Wolf
Brolley.
But Robinson told Brolley last week
that, after discussing the proposal with
Toyon staff, it appeared the idea was
not workable. "We would just get too
much Hack from the rest of the house,"
Brolley said.
Though Robinson then suggested
people interested in the program draw
together in the Spring Housing Draw to
insure being able to live together next
year, many committee members are in
the "unguaranteed" draw group so
would not be able necessarily to insure
a spot together anyway, Brolley said.
As a result, the group will probably
end up with office space next year
somewhere on campus to use for or
ganizational meetings. Groups can re
quest office space from the Office of
Student Activities.
Political Science Prof. Daniel
Okimoto, a strong faculty supporter of
the Hast House proposal, said he fears
program supporters may lose interest
in the program.
"Without a facility, it's hard to keep
enthusiasm generated," he said.
Okimoto added that the core com
mittee and several faculty supporters of
the program were unhappy with Lyons'
decision to allow the French house

program to continue for another year,
particularly because Lyons did not
meet with them before making the de
cision.
"These two proposals (one for the
East Asian Studies house and the other
for maintenance of the French house)
were, in fact, linked, a fact seemingly
recognized by everyone hut Lyons,"
committee members Steve Chelberg
and Jeff Wong stated last week in a
Daily column." We should have at least
been informed that an appeal (by
Frcnch house residents) was in process
and had an opportunity to present our
views."
Lyons said his decision was not based
on the merits of the East Asian Studies
proposal. "We are not pitting one
theme house against another." he has
said.
Despite the house's short-term fate,
Okimoto says he is still hopeful. "It was
all such a shame; so much could have
been done with a theme house of this
sort. For us it's been a two-year unit,
but we're still hopeful that something
positive will come of it."
Although Okimoto and a group of
other faculty supporters plan to visit
Lyons this week "to get clarification of
the reversal decision and to express our
disappointment. At this late stage there
doesn't seem to be too much sense in
laboring the point any further," he
said.
"We'll try to keep the core commit
tee active next year if we get office
space we can at least hold meetings,"
he added.
