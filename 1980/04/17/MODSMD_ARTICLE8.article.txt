!\'ews analysis

Members of the four-person prog
ram proposal core committee for the
"East House" learned last week that
they would have to wait at least a year
for a residence.
Alternative housing arrangements,
proposals suggested by the East Asian
Studies theme house core committee,
have met with disapproval by Dean of

Residential Education Norm Robin
son.
The only option seemingly able to be
approved is for the committee to find
office space somewhere in the Univer

James Lyons said a procedural prob

were not aware their house was in
danger of being elimiated and then de

cided the French house could remain
for one probationary year.
The East House program has been
approved twice, last year and this year.
Because, following Lyons' decision the
group was still without a house, Robin
son offered the core committee a trailer
cluster in Man/anita Park as an interim
arrangement until 1982.
According to Lyons, the purpose of
the interim arrangement, was to devise
a way to keep the program alive until
1982, when the rebuilding of Storey
House and the addition of an 800-
person-capacity dormitory complex
next to Lagunita Court will be com
plete.
However committee members said
that option would not provide an
adequate sense of community nor
would it offer proper program and
