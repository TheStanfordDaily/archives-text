### Gordon D. Mott The Associated Press 
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica — More than 230
Cuban exiles, some weeping with relief,
others with fists aloft shouting "liberty" and
"down with communism." arrived from
Havana on two planes yesterday. One re
fugee said he was beaten as he boarded,
others said their countrymen stoned them on
the way to the airport.
"I was attacked by a group of people at the
airport." said Juan Alberto Rodriguez, his
face cut and a knee bloody and bandaged.
"But I feel like it is a new day. I have left the
hell of Cuba."
The arrivals were the first of an estimated
10,800 Cubans who packed themselves into
the Peruvian Embassy in Havana the week of
April 4. President Rodrigo Carazo was on
hand for the arrival of the first plane and
embraced some of the refugees as they set
foot on Costa Rican soil at the start of an
airlift.
The first plane carried I*4 refugees. The

second, with 82. arrive 1 1 : hours later. The
refugees were taken to the Albergue de Ber
lin. part of a former prison and now a gov
ernment guest house. President Carazo said
Tuesday they would be sent later to Peru,
which has agreed to take 1000. About 300
are expected to stay in Costa Rica.
Refugees said thousands of Cubans in the
streets of Havana threw stones at buses tak
ing them to the airport and shouted. "We
don't want you."
Carlos Aguilar. a Costa Rican foreign
ministry off icial who accompanied the dissi
dents from Cuba, said the scene at Havana
airport was "like nothing I have ever seen
before."
He said about 300 people formed two rows
and shouted obscenities at the exiles as they
walked to the plane. He said he saw one man
with a bloody nose. "I could not believe what
those people had to go through to leave," he
said.
Rodriguez, treated by Red Cross workers
at the San Jose airport, said he thought the

people at the Havana airport were sent by
I idol Castro's communist government "t«
hassle lis."
Most of the exiles appeared to be men in
their 20s and 3()s but there also vtere older
people, children and women.
Hector Vasallo, an English student at the
University of Havana, said, "I don't want
Castro's gin eminent telling me what to do."
Ihe tall, handsome youth dressed in a
cotton-knit T-shirt said. "I came alive today.
I was dead. I was like a robot but now I am a
man again."
More than half of the refugees have been
spoken for. The United states has agreed to
take 3500. Spain said it will take 500,
Canada 300, Ecuador 200, Belgium I 50. and
unspecified numbers will go to Argentina,
Brazil. West Germany and Sweden.
Costa Rica has offered to be a staging area
for all of the refugees but said only 300 could
remain permanently. The country has acted
as a "bridges" for exiles leaving Cuba in the
past.
