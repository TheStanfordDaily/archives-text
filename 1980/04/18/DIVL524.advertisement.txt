various kinds of fuels must be
compared with state-of-the-art
technology and what steps
must be taken to advance that
technology quickh yet surely.
In the "concepting" stage,
a new car is conceived. II the car

years later, construction of new
plants must begin and basic
tooling must be ordered.
The second phase of the
Project Center takes 21 to
months. It encompasses devel

analysis, handling analysis,
emissions, noise and vibration,
safety, reliability, serviceability

neers and research scientists
work with the one hundred fifty
to two hundred people at the
Project Center and thousands
more in the staffs and divisions
to transfer new science and
technology to the new car. Com
ponents are hand built and
"cobbled" into existing models
for road testing.
Prototype cars are hand
built at a cost of more than
$250,000 each. These enable
the Project Center team to de
termine how newly developed,
pretested components operate

be built from production tooling
and tested some more. New
technology, such as structural
analysis by computer, saves
