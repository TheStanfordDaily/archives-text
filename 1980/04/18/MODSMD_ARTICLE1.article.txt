# 175 rally against committee decision
## 
### Carl Johnston Staff Writer 
About 175 anti-registration de
monstrators gathered in White Plaza
yesterday to protest the vote by the
House Appropriations Committee to
fund registration of IS and 19-year
olds.
Assoc. Prof, of History Paul Seaver
and Carolyn Roberts of the Mid-
Peninsula Conversion Project spoke at
the noon rally, which was sponsored by
the campus anti-registration group,
Stanford Against Conscription (SAC).
"Funding a registration program is
not merely a vote on the collection of a
few million names and addresses,"
Roberts said. "It is a vote to reactivate
one of the most inequitable bureauc
racies of this century."
Addressing the relatively quiet
crowd, Roberts claimed that President
Jimmy Carter's call for registration was
a purely political decision which served
only "to feed war, hysteria without sub
stantially improving military pre
paredness."
"Young people are being asked to
prepare for a draft to figbt to protect
U.S. oil interests," she said, "to sup
port our overdependence on that
source of energy in face of a lack of any
comprehensive energy policy."
Roberts further attacked the draft as
being discriminatory against minorities
and poor people, since these groups are
often unable to hire legal help to find
loop-holes that might exempt them,
from military service.
"People with resources that hire ex
pert help will always be able to take
advantage of exemptions and alterna
tives" to military service.
Seaver stressed that "what we're en-

gaged in is not just the question of
reinstatement of the draft, hut a reor
dering of our policies and priorities in
the long run.
"Our kind of foreign policy," Seaver
added, "tends to involve us in wars we
don't want to fight.
"A volunteer army required a cause
worth fighting and dying for, and any
engagement we are likely to be in
volved in" would not "compel that
kind of volunteer service.
"We must develop," Seaver com
mented, "a policy in which the word
'defense' draws more than a cynical
snicker."
At the end of the demonstration a
mock check for "$l4 million and mill
ions of lives" payable to the Committee
to Re-elect President Carter was
burned by some SAC members.
Yesterday's rally came only three
hours after the Appropriations Com
mittee's 26-23 vote approving the ex
penditure of $13.3 million to meet the
cost of registering all males born in
1960 and 1961 for the military draft.
The issue will be brought before the full
House for debate next Tuesday.
At the end of her speech, Roberts
made a plea to students to write their
congressmen to encourage them to
vote against the registration measure.
At present, according to Roberts, 100
House representatives are still unde
cided about the appropriation bill. In
order for the bill not to pass, she said, it
would be necessary to convince 70 of
these to vote against it.
Although the Appropriations Com
mittee vote came only yesterday, plans
for this rally had been made three
weeks in advance by SAC in anticipa
tion of the event, a SAC member said.
