# Misrepresentation blamed in Iranian crisis
## 
### Joe Rodota Staff Writer 
President Jimmy Carter's mis
representation to the American
public of the mechanisms of in
ternational law is a major factor
in prolonging the current Iranian
crisis, according to Donald War
den, international lawyer and
businessman.
Scheduled to speak on "Iran.
Afghanistan and Internaional
Law," Warden concentrated in
stead on the activist Mack-
American and Pan-African
perspectives on U.S. foreign af
fairs.
Sponsored by the Black
American Law Students Associ
ation and the International Law
Society. Warden told a group of
50 Wednesday that "The presi
dent is not too bright," and he
finds Carter's policies "pecul
iar."
Warden traced past and pre
sent foreign difficulties to a basic
misunderstanding of the Third
World political climate and a ra
cist and ethnocentric bias in the
State Department and America
at large.
Warden outlined inconsisten
cies behind Carter's declaration
that the Iranian takeover is a \ io
lation of international law. He
first admitted that the practice ot

international law is "vague," a
claim illustrated by his sub
sequent anal}sis of how interna
tional lawyers, particularly
minorities, can "solve the inter
national crises."
International law implies a
formal body to adjudicate dis
putes. According to Warden, the
International Court of Justice
was held up to the American
public bv President Carter as the
arbiter in the Iranian crisis.
But the International Court ol
Justice lacks jurisdiction without
prior consent of both parties to
abide by its decision.
Solution lias not been forth
coming for two reasons. Al
though the takeover ot the U.S.
Embassy in November was a vio
lation of international agree
ments prohibiting the taking of
embassy personnel as hostages
Carter has been one-sided, ig
noring another violation by the
United States. Warden said.
Warden cited the 1953 over
throw of the "legitimate gov
ernment of Iran" as the major
international "crime" at issue
here, and passionately stated
"the CIA planned it ' and that
the subsequent U.S. administra
tions "supported the illegal re
gime."
The current deadlock results

from U.S. willingness to submit
the present embassy takeover to
inter national ad j udi cat ions
while denying responsibility for
the 1953 incident.
I he United Nations is also
powerless in the Iranian crisis,
said Warden. The Security
Council is "controlled" by the
U.S. veto and the General As
sembly has no power beyond
moral resolution.
Warden said he and his fellow
"creative lawyers" proposed an
international tribunal which was
seen by the ITiird World "as a
cause for much excitement" in
the quest for Third World sol
idarity and "self-help in armed
struggle."
rhough vague on the current
status ot his proposal. Warden
warned that with the "official"
U.S. alternative, "military inter

vention," "the loser will be the
world," as the OPEC countries
blow up their wells and send the
world economy into a tailspin.
Warden spoke of another of
his "solutions" to the Iranian
crisis during the question period,
one which allegedly could have
set the hostages free had it not
been for opposition by the pre
sent administration. This prop
osal was covered by European,
but not American, media, ac
cording to Warden. Allegedly
representing nine million black
Americans to the Ayatollah
Khomeini, Warden claimed to
have nearly completed negotia
tions for the release of 12 hos
tages later this month.
President Carter, according to
Warden, broke off diplomatic re
lations with Iran so that Ameri
can blacks would not receive "all

the credit" for the release of the
hostages.
Warden ranged widely from
his scheduled topic in his appeals
tor world-wide black solidarity
and criticisms of U.S. "racism"
in Third World diplomacy.
These countries no longer sus
pect the U.S. of "good will" and
are realigning with the presuma
bly non-racist Soviet Union,"
Warden said.
Warden concluded his lengthy
remarks to the mostly minority,
law student audience with a plea
to keep informed on interna
tional issues, to work to solve the
international crises of the pre
sent and future through their in
volvement and unique perspec
tive, and to join him in his "final
task' of establishing a black-
American homeland in Africa.
