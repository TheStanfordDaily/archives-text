# Begin, Sadat accustomed to professional negotiations
## 
### Max Lerner The Los Angeles Times 
NEW YORK CITY — Anwar Sadat and
Menachem Begin, summoned to Washington to
confer with Jimmy Carter, came and went and
worked the treadmill of all the old arguments.
Each man lived up to his advance hilling. Sadat
offered to go to Jerusalem again and address the
Israeli Knesset, hut as a good playwright he must
know that Act Two cannot repeat Act One. Be
sides. he has never invited Begin to address Egypt's
parliament, for the very good reason that he must
play down Israel's diplomatic presence in Cairo.
Begin unyielding
Begin in turn remains unyielding on the issue of
Jewish settlements. There are two reasons why he
can afford to be. One is that the world is preoc
cupied with the obstinacy of someone who makes
Begin look like a pushover yes-man — mainly the
Ayatollah Khomeini. The second is that after Car
ter's dismal blunder on the U.N. resolution. Begin
is no longer a productive target for Carter's pres
sures.
Carter made the best of his gaffe by noting — at
the White House dinner for Begin — that the set
tlements issue which made trouble for Begin on the
West Bank of the Jordan had made trouble for
himself on the East Bank of the Hudson. It was a
wry joke, which expressed a new dimension of
reality in American-Israeli relations.
By a wild irony the American Jews who care
about Israel's diplomatic bargaining power owe
Carter a vote of thanks. By his blunder on the U.N.
resolution, Carter immobilized himself vis-a-vis Is
rael. at least until the November election. And by
the same act he gave Begin some precious room to
maneuver.
Begin is realistic enough to employ it to the hilt,
emulating Sadat with some dramatics of his own.
He is now in a hurry for an accord with Sadat, and
wants daily negotiations for 20 days, shifting bet
ween Alexandria and Herzlia. He talks of high
"principle" rather than "expediency" — which
means he knows his bargaining strength. He can

press for an autonomous Arab Council for the
West Bank and Gaza that will be mostly adminis
trative rather than broadly legislative.
Begin 1 * rule shaky
Not so long ago Begin was in deep trouble at
home, with Moshe Dayan's resignation and Ezer
Wcizman looming over Begin as a potential re
placement. His rule is still shaky, but he can no
longer be written off as an immediate casualty. It
was Carter who unwittingly saved him by his
blooper.
But in the long range both Begin and Sadat have
to operate in the shadow of a new Middle East
situation in which they are no longer the center of
the scene. Sometimes in world history a problem
that looks insoluble is swallowed up in a larger
problem that looks insoluble. Which is what has
happened in the Middle East, with Iran and the
Soviet Union occupying front stage and pushing
the Palestinian issue back stage.
Arab pressure off Sadat
For one thing, it has taken considerable Arab
pressure off Sadat. He can and must continue to
press for concessions from Begin on Palestinian
autonomy. But where a year ago he was a pariah,
for every Arab leader to spit upon, he is no longer
one. He commands the respect of the world for his
courage and decisiveness: his act in giving a haven
to the dying shah was another symbol of those
qualities. And he knows that most of the Arab
leaders, including the left-wing leaders not com
mitted to the Soviet Union, don't want a war with
Israel that would give the Russians a chance to
acquire Iran's oil fields.
As for Jimmy Carter, he deserves praise for the
Camp David accord which made a separate treaty
between Egypt and Israel possible. But he is now
plagued with a far greater migraine in the form of
an Iran with multiple power centers and a Russia
ready and eager to prey on the Iranian carrion if the
nation disintegrates.
For America's sake — and the world's too — we
must hope that he has learned enough from his
recent blunders to right the whirlwind of our time.
