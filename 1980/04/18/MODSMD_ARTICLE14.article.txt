# Debate team wins honors
## 
### Tom Harrell Staff Writer 
One of the best-kept secrets at
Stanford is the existence of ar
debate program
here on the Farm. Despite prob
lems with funding and conflicting
academic demands, several stu
dents have entered local and reg
ional tournaments.
Although the debate program
at Stanford is small in compari
son with that of other major uni
versities, its success has been
large. Earlier this year, David
Hedman and Dave Dodson won
third place at the San Francisco
State tournament, and second
place at the UC-Berkeley tour
nament national formal debate

arguing the topic, "Resolved:
that the United States govern
ment should significantly control
the mass media."
Last month Stanford's Derrick
Lopez and Mariann Byerwalter
travelled to the University of Il
linois in order to compete in the
Second Annual Engineering
Debate, a tournament held in
conjunction with that universi
ty's open house on engineering.
Debating such issues as energy
independence versus a clean en
vironment, Lopez and Byerwal
ter won first place.
At the heart of the program
here lies an Undergraduate Spe
cial course, "Advanced De

bate." This course, taught by
third-year law student and team
coach John Roos, usually at
tracts 10 to 20 students a year.
The students then research the
year's nationwide topic and
enter local tournaments, where
each team debates four to six
times in two days. Each team ar
gues both the affirmative and
negative side of the resolution.
Among the cases argued this
year by Stanford teams were a
prohibition on billboard adver
tising and regulation of televi
sion commericals aimed toward
children which push high sugar
content foods.
Debaters were generally en
thusiastic about their involve
ment with the program. "You
meet a lot of interesting people,"
said Hedman. "Debate sharpens
your arguments and helps in a lot
of areas. It helps develop skills
you use every day anyway."
Debaters all cited two con
straints on the program —
money and time. As coach John
Roos commented, "We have a
lot of talent. The trouble is lack
of money."
Although the debate team or
ganizes a high school debate
workshop at Stanford every
summer to raise money, lack of
University funding prevents the
team from competing in national
tournaments. According Roos, a
truly competitive program re
quires a minimum of $10,000 a
year.

But Assistant Dean for Tre
sidder Union Thom Massey said
the University does not fund the
debate program because it be
lieves the program can raise
money in many other ways, such
as a fee assessment.
He added the University stop
ped financing the debate team
several years ago because it was
very expensive but benefitted
few students. When the program
was cut back, he said, "there
wasn't the level of interest there
is now."
A second constraint fre
quently mentioned was conflict
ing academic demands. Even
though the debate class is a
three-unit course, "debate takes
more time than the units because
you don't want to be embarras
sed" at tournaments, said Tom
Harding, who debated fall quar
ter.
