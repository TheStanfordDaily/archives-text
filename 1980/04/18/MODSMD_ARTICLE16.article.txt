## 
### Sara Whittier Staff Writer 
Women from countries as diverse as
France. Peru, and Zaire are taking part in
an informal discussion series sponsored
by Bechtel International Center. The dis
cussion groups have been meeting tor
several years. They continue to attract
new members and retain the interest of
old ones who say they find it a stimulating
social and intellectual outlet.
The discussions are attended chiefly by
women in the Stanford Community who
are scholars or wives of foreign scholars.
"We are not a feminist group." said
Carolyn Dalton. one of the group leaders.
The gatherings are made up of women
who discuss topics they are interested in.
she said.
These topics range from education and

politics to personal issues, for example
what one misses most about being away
from her respective country. Above all,
noted Dalton, the talks are held in an
informal and supportive manner.
Many foreigners and especially wives of
foreign students or professors at Stanford
tend to feel isolated. "They don't realize
how lonely it can get being a wife of
someone who is studying," said Dalton.
Non-threatening
Most members seem to find the atmos
phere non-threatening and intellectually
stimulating. For several it was one of the
first things they started doing upon arriv
ing at Stanford.
Although many of the women are
mothers, children are not often the dis
cussion topic.
"What I like most about the group is

the flexibility of the women," stated
another participant. "Our group seems to
discuss all different types of things."
Initial fear
According to Dalton. many women feel
intimidated, afraid to come to the group
meetings, feeling that they have to be
formal or prepared on discussion topics.
Once women come and see how friendly
the group is they feel relieved.
Many members who have left the Stan
ford area make a point of coming back to
the group when they return. Dalton ad
ded.
The meetings are held in members'
homes once every two weeks and are gen
erally attended bv 12 to 15 women. At
present two groups are active, meeting
Tuesday and Wednesday evenings.
Although the discussions have an in

ternatonal flavor, about one-third of the
participans are Americans. One Ameri
can member commented that it is not well
known that Americans are welcome in
this group or at the I-Center in general.
Those who do attend, however, find
themselves warmly received.
This week the groups met in a com
bined meeting at Bechtel where, over de
ssert and coffee, they touched on topics as
diverse as the availability of public parks
in the United States and problems ol get
ting to know people in a university society
that seems to be so transient. On April 29
and 30 the groups will resume their regu
lar Tuesday/Wednesday meetings.
Those interested are in\ ited to call Dal
ton or to speak with Marilyn I lumwick at
the I-Center for further details.
