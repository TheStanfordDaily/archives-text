# Survivor raps 'Guyana Tragedy'
## 
### Howard Rosenberg The Los Angeles Times 
HOLLYWOOD — Fact or
fiction?
The riddle of Jim Jones and his
Peoples Temple followers may
never be solved, and dramatiza
tions of the man and the deaths
at Jonestown may only muddy
the waters even as they feed our
inexplicable appetite for horror
stories.
But here is the opinion of a
man who was there:
The CBS drama. "Guyana
Tragedy: The Story ot Jim
Jones," came as close "to telling
the story of Guyana as 'The
Deerhunter' did in telling the

story of Vietnam.
"That wasn't close enough for
me."
One of five survivors
< Those are the words of Bob
Flick, an NBC News producer
who was one of five persons to
survive the Guyana airfield am
bush which was depicted Wed
nesday night near the end of the
two-part production.
Yet it appeared from the small
screen that there were no sur
vivors. It appeared that press,
Jonestown defectors and
everyone else connected with the
Peoples Temple fact-finding
mission of Rep. Leo Ryan.

(I)—Calit.), were gunned down
by Jonestown gunmen.
Much of the airfield scene was
ficticious. Flick said yesterday in
a phone interview from his office
at NBC Burbank.
"They had the wrong kind of
airplane, the wrong kind of guns
and the wrong kind of people at
the airport," he said.
Victims identified
Even some of the wrong vic
tims. A couple identified in the
drama as the Ritchies, who were
in a child custody case with Jones
and were shown cut down at the
airfield, were closely patterned
after a real couple, Tim and
Grace Stowen. said Flick.
"They weren't even at the air
field. As far as 1 know they're
still alive."
The CBS drama purported to
trace the career of Rev. Jim
Jones, culminating with Ryan's
November 197<S visit to Jones
town and the grisly airfield scene
and subsequent poisoning of
more than 900 Peoples Temple
followers. CBS says the Ernest
Tidy man script was based on
"Guyana Massacre: The
Eyewitness Account," a book by
Washington Post writers, princi
pally Charles A. Krause. one of
the airfield survivors.
If, as the drama depicted,
there had been no survivors,
then who would have written the
eyewitness account?
Fact or fiction?
The distorted ending brings
before us again the ever-debated
issue of TV docudrama and the
obligation of those responsible

to stick to facts when possible
and clearly inform viewers when
license is being taken.
CBS never labeled its produc
tion as factual, but after all it was
"The Story of Jim Jones" and the
implication was clear. "A lot of
people will believe that it's the
Gospel." said Flick.
A lot were watching. Nielsen
ratings for the entire drama were
unavailable, but CF3S overnight
figures for Tuesday's Part One
showed those two hours averag
ing a whopping 4(S percent share
of sets in use, and the network
forecast even gaudier results
from Wednesday night.
Clearly, many will be influ
enced by what they've seen.
Flick wasn't consulted
CBS or executive producer
Frank Konigsberg could have
asked Flick about the airfield.
They didn't.
Another survivor, Ryan aide
Jacqueline Speier (portrayed in
the drama as a man), earlier said
she also had not been consulted
about the production. And a
psychologist who worked with
about 250 of Jones' followers
who escaped poisoning at the
Guyana settlement has said he
knew of none interviewed for the
CBS production.
"We (NBC News) had many
tapes." said Flick, "it (the air
field scene) would have been
easy to reconstruct accurately. It
would have been no more dif
ficult to make it faithful. The fact
that they didn't casts suspicion
on the whole production for me,
and I liked the first part."
