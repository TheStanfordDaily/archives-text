## Kennedy looks to 1984 election 
### 
Jody Powell is correct in expressing his
disdain about Sen. F.dward Kennedy's con
tinuing campaign. It is natural that he would
be worried that Kennedy's persistence would
hand the country over to Ronald Reagan.
The logic is that the Democratic party would
be in such disarray that Reagan's campaign
would be boosted both organizationally and
financially.
Powell's attempt at shaming Kennedy and
consequently causing the latter's withdrawal
is understandable. The only problem is that
Kennedy wants Reagan to win the next elec
tion. Outrageous as this contention may be
prima facie, the following arguments will
make the scenario quite conceivable.
Kennedy knows that mathematically he
has no chance to beat Carter for the Democ
ratic nomination. Yet. Kennedy is really
campaigning for 1984. His 1980 campaign
has gone through three phases. In the first
phase, non-candidate Kennedy enjoyed a
vigorous rapport with the people without the

obvious pitfalls of his own skeletons and the
insurmountable aura of his party's sitting
president.
In the second phase, candidate Kennedy
was transformed into a lackluster and often
ridiculous campaigner. People thought,
justly, that his heart was not with the task at
hand. The thing that really gave a shot in the
arm of Kennedy's campaign was not his vic
tory in New York and Connecticut but more
importantly Reagan's apparent electability.
Reagan, originally thought of as a
monolithic, conservative gargantuan, has
gained momentum and the latest polls present
him as a formidable challenger. Intellectuals
and university people still perceive him as a
political lightweight. Yet. the citizens of this
country have shown a distinct desire to re
place Carter. Kennedy is more than willing to
help in that end.
These are difficult times. The energy situa
tion and an array of foreign problems make
the job of the president both an unenviable
and necessarily unpopular one. Kennedy

knows all too well that President Reagan (or
whoever replaces him in the case of natural
events) is a lesser opponent than candidate
Reagan.
If Reagan beats Carter, thanks to both the
president's myriad of shortcomings and
Kennedy's brutal challenge, then Kennedy
has an almost sure win in 1984. It Carter
wins, then surely another charismatic Repub
lican could mount a campaign to wrest the
office from a certainly disastrous Carter
(Democratic) presidency.
In this scenario, Kennedy's ambition
would have to be postponed for 1992 or
more likely forever. In the unprincipled
world of presidential politics, Kennedy's per
sistence is quite a propos. He will not hesi
tate, in his quest for the 1984 presidency, to
help Republican Reagan to win the 1980
election. In fact, this is the only interpreta
tion of Kennedy's recent resurgence.
