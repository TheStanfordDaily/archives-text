WASHINGTON — President
Jimmy Carter's stalled draft registra
tion program passed the House Ap
propriations Committee yesterday on a
26-23 vote, gising him an important
victory after what a Republican source
said was "an awful lot of arm-wringing
by the administration."
Before the showdown, the commit
tee rejected, on voice votes, proposals
to include women in the registration
program.
Both supporters of draft registration
and opponents predicted victory when
the measure goes to the floor for a vote
of the full House next Tuesday.
Carter, reacting to the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan, called in January
for resumption of draft registration
and. in releasing details of his proposal
in February, said women should be re
quired to register for the first time.
Moribund
Carter's plan has been delayed in
Congress since Feb. 27 when an ap
propriations subcommittee approved
only enough money for a standby re
gistration program that would not start
until the president ordered mobiliza
tion in an emergency.
The subcommittee vote had been a
sharp setback for the administration,
and resulted in an intense lobbying ef
fort by the White House and Pentagon
to reverse the outcome.
"I would be surprised if it were de
feated," House Speaker Thomas
O'Neill, (D-Mass.) told reporters.
Survey
1 le said a White House survey shows
206 congressmen supporting registra
tion. K6 opposed and the remainder of
the 435 members undecided.

The committee's vote marked the
first victory in Congress in registration
for the administration
There was widespread division
among Republicans and Democrats on
whether to support registration. Eight
Republicans joined IX Democrats in
voting for registration, while nine GOP
members and 14 Democrats voted
against it.
'Signal'
Administration supporters said yes
terday that institution of the registra
tion program would "send a signal" to
the Soviet Union that the United States
is prepared to resist further aggression
of the sort that occurred in Afghanis
tan.
Rep. Norman Dicks, (D-Wash), said
that registration has support through
out the country and that House mem
bers would have difficulty voting
against the proposal, particularly with
elections coming up this year and na
tional security a prime concern of con
stituents. To vote against the registra
tion program might he perceived as
"undercutting" the president at a time
when he is trying to bolster the national
defense. Dicks said.
But Rep. Peter Peyser, (D-N.Y.), a
registration foe. was equally confident
that his side would prevail as it did last
September before Afghanistan —
when the House defeated a draft regist
ration plan by a vote of 252-163.
Ineffective
"(Registration) would accomplish
absolutely nothing," Peysorsaid. He is
not a member of the Appropriations
Committee, but he attended the 90-
minute meeting yesterday and said he
would propose an ammendment on the
floor that would gut the registration
proposal. "It doesn't send any signals
to anyone," he said.
Actually, Carter already has the
legal authority to order registration of
men for a possible draft. Yesterday's
legislation would give teeth to that au
thority by appropriating the $13.3 mill
ion needed to finance registration.
The original appropriation was stal
led because of Carter's budget freeze.
Then, registration proponents intro
duced the measure acted on yesterday
to transfer already-appropriated funds
from the Air Force to the Selective
Service System. The plan had suffered
several setbacks in subcommittees, los
ing once m a House Appropriations

subcommittee on a 6-6 tie.
It also has run into strong criticism in
the Senate. But the hiatus of the Easter
recess gave the administration time to
mobilize its supporters to secure a first
victory for the proposal in the full Ap
propriations Committee yesterday.
Meanwhile, a Selective Service
spokeswoman said that if Congress ap
proves a bill to register young men for
the draft. '9- and 20-year-olds will
begin signing up during the last two

weeks in June.
Joan Lamb said that young men horn
in 1960 and 1961 will be asked to re
port to their local post office to fill out
registration forms which tell the gov
ernment their name, address, date of
birth and social security number.
Should Congress authorize a draft, a
lottery based on birthdays would be
held to determine what order the
young men would be drafted.
