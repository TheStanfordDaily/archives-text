## Zimbabwe celebrates independence 
### 
Zimbabwe officially be
comes independent today. Men.
women and young people who
fought and suffered for so long
because intruders decided to stay
and benefit from their soil, mines
and blood will celebrate some
thing they really shouldn't be
doing because they should al
ways have been independent.
They will celebrate w hat some
countries in the continent of Af
rica did quite some time ago
(Ghana in 1957, Nigeria in 1960.
Kenya in 1963); what some did
only recently (Mozambique in
1975. Angola in 1975, Guinnea
Bissau in 1976) and what some
have yet to do (Azania. Namibia
and Spanish Sahara). All Afri
cans and peace-loving people of
the world join in this celebration.
The victory of the people of
Zimbabwe is, however, not
amusing at all to many people,
especially those that find the glit
ter of gold and diamonds irresis
tible and those who benefit from
the suffering of a downtrodden
people and unashamedly make
greed their first priority. Such
people as those who wield power
in South Africa or those that
have business investments there
are certainly not very amused.
Particularly with a man like
Robert Mugabe at the helm.
Zimbabwe has the oppor
tunity to learn from what has
happened in most of the rest of

Africa where independence sim
ply meant a replacement of one
set of masters with others, only
this time dark-skinned. They are
a privileged minority whose lifes
tyles are characteristic of their
foreign friends who use them as
pawns and tell them what moves
to make at w hat times and after
wards laugh at their idiocy.
The most immediate service
Africa will ask of Zimbabwe,
however, has to do with the op
pressed people of Azania (in
South Africa). Azania is the
wealthiest country in Africa but
it is here that Africans suffer
most. The South African regime
has to fall, if only for its inhuman
ity. It is hard for anyone except
the most uncivilized to forgive
incidences as the Shaperville
Massacre, arbitrary detentions
and bannings. killing of blacks in
jails, bombings of innocent
people in Zambia and Mozam
bique. fascist acts by South Afri
can mercenaries in Angola, sup
port of enemies of the people of
Africa such as Bishop Muzorewa
and worst of all the murder of
Soweto School children.
The liberation of Africa will be
possible only through force of
arms. To expect diplomacy to
succeed in dealing with an enemy
is to be naive. It is being both
unhistorical and unpoliti
cal."Power flows out of the bar
rel of a gun" said Mao Tse-Tung

and the freedom fighters in Zim
babwe, Mozambique, Angola.
Guinnea Bissau, the Mau of
Kenya and others have proved
this. They have proved it in spite
of their being called terrorists by
their enemies!
The people of Azania will win
in spite of imperialism's foothold
and the weapons they supply the
oppressors with. They have to
win in spite of John Vorster's
swearing that whites would con
tinue to rule South Africa. Lan
Smith swore the same thing. He
now knows better. The people of
Zimbabwe should throw him
into jail wtfh the three volumes
of Capital as his only compan
ions. As for the bishop, they
should send him back to the
church.
South Africa's minority is not
going to defeat the spirit of the
youngsters of Soweto or freedom
fighters now in jail or those that
have lost their lives in the strug
gle begun long ago. They are not
going to beat those Africans out
side of South Africa who are de
termined to see the whole of Af
rica liberated if only to prove
wrong one of the greatest im
perialists, Cecil Rhodes, whose
name Rhodesia had to take.
Remember that fascist
"explorer" who dreamed so
often about a map of Africa col
ored red? It is strange, isn't it?
The way things can turn out.

Now the sun even sets in the
British Empire. Nor arc the
freedom fighters going to he
stopped hy the reforms of Prime
Minister Pietr Botha for what
they want is not to see their
chains polished but removed.
The "old man" Karl Marx cal
led religion the opiate of the
people. Ironically the Ayatollah
Khomeini thinks music is. Relig
ion has been used in South Af
rica as elsewhere to legitimize
oppression. The Boers have
often quoted the Bible to prove
that blacks are inferior in the
same way William Shockley and
his likes will unashamedly de
fend their racist theory regarding
human intelligence.
Many blacks in South Africa
will find it difficult to give up say
ing the Lord's prayer not so
much because they agree with
those who use it to oppress them
but because they may seem to
think that only God can get them
out of all their troubles which is
unfortunate because it is a false
feeling. But if they must say the
Lord's prayer, they may well
learn to do it the Zimbabwe way:
"... Teach us to demand our
share of the Gold, forgive us our
docility ..." A lutta continua!
