## Don't call Hillel Board 'paranoid' 
### 
When I read the Daily's front-page ac
count of the Hillel Board's reaction to Rabbi
Mark Cartun's "support" of Palestinian
Awareness Week, my first reaction was sym
pathy for Mark (Cartun) and relief that this
was one issue which did not concern me.
As a campus minister, I have had numer
ous experiences supporting ideas and prog
rams on campus which raise concerns in the
congregations which support the ministry. I
have heard in every one of these issues the
question of whether what was done was "re
sponsible, constitutional or the right way to
have proceded" used to obscure the basic
fact that the issue is troublesome. And while
neither I nor Cartun would lessen the impor
tance of procedures — (Cartun has stated
that his letter should not have gone out on
Hillel stationery, for example) — it is the
gravity of the issue which makes the question
of procedure important.
The issue of Palestinian Awareness is cru
cial for everyone who cares about peace, but
it is even more critical for Jews because of the
place Israel has played in Jewish conscious
ness. It is clear to m that what Cartun has
asked from the Jewish community at Stan
ford is not endorsement of Palestinian
Awareness Week and not even support.
What he asks is participation, a willingness

to listen and the presence by which criticism
and debate can be engendered. Whether
they like it nor not, the Hillel Board should
have supported that. And while they might
continue to have some advice to give their
director about how to use the official station
ery, etc., they should be glad to have a direc
tor who is willing to act courageously and
prophetically.
But for the same reason that I could sigh
with relief tha this was his problem, my ad
vice to the board is somewhat gratuitous. I
don't really know what it is to be Jewish, to
experience the subtle anti-Semitism of
America or to live in the shadow of the milit
ant anti-Semitism of western Christendom.
As a Christian minister, my agony in read
ing about the mobs who went from Good
Iriday services to kill Jews and in the com
plicity of Christian ideology and Christian
people in the Nazi I holocaust is real but diffe
rent from that felt by Jews. It is easier for me
to conclude that the creation of Israel was a
mistake, another dirty trick played on Jews
by guilt-ridden Gentiles, than to see how
Jews embrace Israel in hope that exile and
"diaspora" is ended.
So the truth is that I, and all you who seek
peace, do have a part to play in this issue. We
have to end anti-Semitism. We who are iden

titled as Christians must be particularly con
scious of misusing the polemical language of
the New Testament to infer that Jews are less
favored by God or less human than anyone
else. And all of us must stand up against
thoughtless remarks and discriminatory
practices. But we also must learn to take
seriously the fact that Jewish students at
Stanford feel threatened and alienated.
Only if we have done with anti-Semitism
will our support for courageous leadership in
the Jewish community be effective. Only
then will we be able to discuss how the state
of Israel can be part of a just Middle East
without convincing many Jews that we are
preparing to accept a new persecution. Be
fore we say that the reaction of the Hillel
Board to Cartun's courageous leadership is
an exhibition of "paranoia," we had better
admit that Jews have very little reason to
take comfort in the lessons of history and
every reason to remind us of their suffering.
It turns out that we have a very important
part to play in resolving this issue and in
helping Hillel proclaim "never again" to the
specter of a Holocaust, including the
holocaust experienced by Palestinian Arabs.
Shalom.
