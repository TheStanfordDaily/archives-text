# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Randy Broberg Willis' column confusing 
### 
1 was quite perturbed to read
John Willis' comments (Daily,
April 10) entitled "Buckley's
Arguments Are Empty." Willis'
column was a confusing and con
flicting assortment of
philosophies, phraseologies and
political simplicities. The argu
ment that it is philosophically
legitimate to have a progressive
income tax because "America is
by no definition a democracy" is
an example of the naivete
characteristic of Willis which
leads him to an even more con
fusing position: "Buckley is . . .a
rightist . . . along with Ronald
Reagan â€” but conservatives
they are not." The lexical side
stepping which leads him to this
conclusion has no historical
basis.
It is necessary toexamine what
it means, historically, to be a
conservative or a rightist if one is
going to make a sound, rational
judgment free from the emo
tional hysteria found in Willis'
comments.
During the English Puritan
Revolution of the 17th century
and during the French Revolu
tion of the 18th century the
pro-monarchists were consi
dered to be the conservatives
while the revolutionaries were
thought to be the liberals or radi
cals.
Obviously, the reason was that
the pro-monarchists sought to
preserve the status quo and all
the class privileges that it en
tailed. However, in both cases
the liberals, far from represent
ing freedom, clamped down on
the people with tyranny.
In both countries the liberals
ended up in power as military
dictatorships. Of course, the jus
tification for the centralized
military control over people's
lives was the liberal Henri Rous
seau's belief that people would

need to "be forced to be free."
Let's look at another historical
example: England in the 19th
century. During the Victorian
Era the conservatives were the
ones who sought to preserve the
privileges of the landed gentry
and the nobility, while the liber
als sought to make the nation
more democratic by eliminating
slavery and by broadening suf
frage.
During our own century, polit
ical terminology has been so
muddled and confused that the
generalizations inevitably lead to
contradictions. For example, the
Nazi Socialist Party in pre-World
II Germany is generally referred
to as "right wing." So, we should
define "right wing" as meaning
militaristic, racist, and tyranni
cal. But nationalization of vital
industries, an unquestioned re
volt against the status quo, and a
base among the working class
common laborer also charac
terize the Nazis, items hardly to
be considered conservative.
If this is right wing, where do
we place communism under the
Soviets? There we have a
militaristic, racist, and tyranni
cal dictatorship of the Politburo.
Furthermore, Soviet com
munism began as a radical break
from the Czarist status quo, a
movement of the working class,
and of course nationalization of
industry. Yet at the same time
communism and socialism are
commonly described as left wing.
Where is the rhyme or reason to
this sort of lexicography?
In our contemporary situation
the title "right wing conserva
tive" is generally tagged on to
such people as Ronald Reagan,
William Buckley and Milton
Friedman. "Left wing liberal" is
attached to the likes of Edward
Kennedy, George McGovern
and John Galbraith. But do these
terms fit? Not at all; Reagan,

Buckley and Friedman could
never be accused of defending
the status quo. They advocate
change; they and those like them
have been fighting the
Washington, New Deal, Great
Society establishment for de
cades.
Furthermore, these so called
"right wing conservatives" have
all advocated less government,
more individual freedom and
less centralization of authority. It
will surprise many so-called lib
erals, I believe, to find out that
Reagan, Buckley and Friedman
all favor a volunteer army and
oppose the draft. Also, the "left
wing liberals" like Kennedy ad
vocate government control of
wages and prices, gun control,
etc.. hardly items which match
any historical definition of lib
eral. Last, the left wing now rep
resents the establishment and
status quo; it has since the days
of Franklin Roosevelt.
In conclusion, terms like "lib
eral," "conservative," "left
wing" and "right wing" have
been so misused as to lose all
inherent meaning. Political
ideologies cannot be reduced to
a horizontal scale of degrees. It is
completely irrational to say one
will not vote for Reagan because
he is "too conservative" or "too
far right," just as it is wrong to
say the same for Kennedy be-'
cause he is "too liberal."
The educated citizen must
vote on the issues. The name cal
ling and hasty generalizations
Willis would have us use will lead
only to prejudice and ignorance.
If general terminology is neces
sary, it is this writer's opinion
that new definitions and words
should be used in order to add
light upon the issues, not over
whelm them with the darkness of
preconceptions.
