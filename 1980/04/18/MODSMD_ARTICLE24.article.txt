Flick protested
We write to protest the
scheduled campus showing of
The Cheerleaders, this Sunday's
ASSU flick, and to urge the Stan
ford community to boycott this
film.
Although The Cheerleaders is
silly and frivolous and the plot is
weak, we must, unfortunately,
take it seriously. We are tired of
silly, frivolous, weak films which
suggest that interactions bet
ween the sexes are determined
solely by hormones.
In showing The Cheerleaders,
ASSU both perpetuates and pro
fits by the sexist stereotypes
which are already too prevalent.
Women in this film are
trivialized as dumb, sex-crazed
cheerleaders who are adjuncts to
real life, in which men play foot
ball.
Their only power is to use their
sexuality to infuence the game's
outcome. The stereotypical im
ages of men — as big, brainless
jocks who thoughtlessly use
women — are equally offensive.
In short, sexuality is rendered
obsolete and replaced by sexual
antics and exploitation.

Though the most explicit
scenes have been cut from the
R-rated campus version of the
film, we hope Stanford students
will join us in making ASSU
aware that The Cheerleaders is
still obscenity and inappropriate
for feeling human beings. The
portrayals of women as sexually
insatiable groupies whose sole
loyalties and aspirations center
around male football players is
supposed to be innocuous erotic
fun. We find it demeaning, reac
tionary and dartgerous.

Czarist Russia
I have no wish to glorify
Czarist Russia. But contrary to
Peter Osnos's views, Solzhenit
syn's favorite account is not "in
the strictest sense reactionary"
(Daily, April 4).
Czarist Russia had many
faults. It was anti-Semitic. Its
bureaucracy was bloated and in
efficient. State interference in
the economy was more extensive
and incompetent than in any
other European country. It was
class-ridden. Corruption was rife.

But it was a society set on the
way to progress. Contrary to the
Marxist stereotype, its economy
was expanding at a faster rate
than that of any Western coun
try. (Between 1880 and 1914,
coal production increased from
3.2 to 36 million tons; steel pro
duction rose from 0.2 to 4 mill
ion tons; manufacturing output
more than quadrupled.) These
successes would have been
trumpeted abroad had they
been achieved by a communist
government today.
Czarist achievements remain
unknown, except to a few
specialists. There was brutality
aplenty under the Czars. But
there were no mass deportations,
no mass liquidations. Russian
citizens were free to emigrate,
and millions made use of this
right. Liberty was restricted, but
the fate of a Siberian exile in
Czarist days was infinitely
erable to that of a political pris
oner in the U.S.S.R.
There were few restrictions on
academic thought. (Karl Marx's
works, for instance, circulated
freely in Russian.) The bulk of
the land, by the turn of this cen
tury, was peasant-owned. There
was no persecution of religion;
there was no official orthodoxy
in philosophy, the sciences-and
the arts. There were obscuran
tists. There was no Lysenko.
Education was expanding in a
rapid fashion.
The Czarist authorities had
begun to create an extensive sys
tem of social insurance. Russia's
record in music, philosophy, and
literature was brilliant. Would
that the so-called workers'
fatherland could make similar
boasts.

(Daily, April 4).
Czarist Russia had many
faults. It was anti-Semitic. Its
bureaucracy was bloated and in
efficient. State interference in
the economy was more extensive
and incompetent than in any
other European country. It was
class-ridden. Corruption was rife.

But it was a society set on the
way to progress. Contrary to the
Marxist stereotype, its economy
was expanding at a faster rate
than that of any Western coun
try. (Between 1880 and 1914,
coal production increased from
3.2 to 36 million tons; steel pro
duction rose from 0.2 to 4 mill
ion tons; manufacturing output
more than quadrupled.) These
successes would have been
trumpeted abroad had they
been achieved by a communist
government today.
Czarist achievements remain
unknown, except to a few
specialists. There was brutality
aplenty under the Czars. But
there were no mass deportations,
no mass liquidations. Russian
citizens were free to emigrate,
and millions made use of this
right. Liberty was restricted, but
the fate of a Siberian exile in
Czarist days was infinitely
erable to that of a political pris
oner in the U.S.S.R.
There were few restrictions on
academic thought. (Karl Marx's
works, for instance, circulated
freely in Russian.) The bulk of
the land, by the turn of this cen
tury, was peasant-owned. There
was no persecution of religion;
there was no official orthodoxy
in philosophy, the sciences-and
the arts. There were obscuran
tists. There was no Lysenko.
Education was expanding in a
rapid fashion.
The Czarist authorities had
begun to create an extensive sys
tem of social insurance. Russia's
record in music, philosophy, and
literature was brilliant. Would
that the so-called workers'
fatherland could make similar
boasts.

Photo objectionable
We find your use of the photo
on the front page (Daily, April
10) extremely objectionable. It
is evidence of sensationalistic,
shoddy journalism and presup
poses a lack of taste among your
readership that we resent.
Does your desire to revolt and
appall take precedence over all
feelings of respect for others?
Suppose members of the Hansen
family were to sec that picture?
We think you owe all concerned
an apology.

Flick protested
We write to protest the
scheduled campus showing of
The Cheerleaders, this Sunday's
ASSU flick, and to urge the Stan
ford community to boycott this
film.
Although The Cheerleaders is
silly and frivolous and the plot is
weak, we must, unfortunately,
take it seriously. We are tired of
silly, frivolous, weak films which
suggest that interactions bet
ween the sexes are determined
solely by hormones.
In showing The Cheerleaders,
ASSU both perpetuates and pro
fits by the sexist stereotypes
which are already too prevalent.
Women in this film are
trivialized as dumb, sex-crazed
cheerleaders who are adjuncts to
real life, in which men play foot
ball.
Their only power is to use their
sexuality to infuence the game's
outcome. The stereotypical im
ages of men — as big, brainless
jocks who thoughtlessly use
women — are equally offensive.
In short, sexuality is rendered
obsolete and replaced by sexual
antics and exploitation.

Though the most explicit
scenes have been cut from the
R-rated campus version of the
film, we hope Stanford students
will join us in making ASSU
aware that The Cheerleaders is
still obscenity and inappropriate
for feeling human beings. The
portrayals of women as sexually
insatiable groupies whose sole
loyalties and aspirations center
around male football players is
supposed to be innocuous erotic
fun. We find it demeaning, reac
tionary and dartgerous.

Czarist Russia
I have no wish to glorify
Czarist Russia. But contrary to
Peter Osnos's views, Solzhenit
syn's favorite account is not "in
the strictest sense reactionary"
(Daily, April 4).

bureaucracy was bloated and in
