## Presidential draw: leave it to chance 
### 
I think that we can all agree
tha,t the present presidential
primary system is inequitable.
As it stands those broad-backed
narrow-minded farmers in lowa
arfd the Arctic semi-savages of
northern New England are in a
position to set the pace for the
nation. And once you get stuck
at the bottom it's hard to get
back up again (as anyone who
has drawn into Burbank knows).
In those all important first few
weeks of the campaigning sea
son, the groups mentioned above
can relegate a promising candi
date to an electoral Manzanita
Park while giving others, of ques
tionable repute, present resi
dence priority at the top.
Why do we put with this hor
rendous system? The answer is
simple. No one seems creative
enough to think up anything else.
Not even Stanford, home of the
future elite, has presented a plan.
Yet the answer lies right here
among us if we only look.
The plan referred to above
(which shall be referred to as The
Stanford Plan)can eliminate the
now rampant voter subjectivity
and establish in its place a more
equitable, if less predictable,
mechanism â€” chance.
Is it clear yet? 1 am speaking,
of course, about the presidential
nominating draw. The logical
expansion of a system we hold so
dear.
First, every presidential can
didate would be presented with a
hefty Presidential Draw Book,
complete with descriptions of the
positions for which they might be
nominated, details of the ad
ministrative procedure involved,
and information on special
priorities (we'll get to that la
ter).
Next, each candidate who
manages to decipher the Presi
dential Draw Book goes to
Washington. D.C., and picks up
a card on which he indicates his
nomination choices in order of
preference. (Runner-up, presi
dent, vice-president, national
committee chairman, etc.)
Then (surprise) each candi

date will be instructed to choose
a number. Depending on the
budget situation there should be
some sort of gimmick to make
choosing fun and losing less pain
ful. One possible presidential
draw gimmick would be to line
up B-52s somewhere outside of
Omaha and have each candidate
pick his favorite bomber (each
plane would have a number
painted inside its bomb bay).
The candidate who gets the
lowest number has the best
chance of getting his first choice.
But there is one other element to
be added to the selection pro
cess.
The draw may be fine in itself,
you say, but there is one prob
lem. What happens to the reg
ional flavor which is the rationale

behind the present primary sys
tem? This is where special
priorities come in.
By doing different things in
different states, candidates can
improve their chances of getting
their choice. By taking out the
garbage in Illinois, baking bread
in New Mexico, cooking a meal
in New York or just showing up
in Montana, a candidate can ac
cumulate special priorities which
will, in some mysterious way, af
fect the outcome. There are
some no priority states, Nevada,
for instance.
After priorities have been ac
cumulated and numbers have
been drawn, all the information
is fed into a computer which
should determine the final out
come sometime before

November. When the final re
sults are revealed, the unas
signed begin their search for
work elsewhere and the lucky
ones step forward into the pages
of history.
Neat, huh? And think, this sys
tem can be implemented in other
social situations Wherever sub
jectivity and inequality are in
evidence a draw may be the ans
wer.
The selection of Supreme
Court justices, the distribution of
federal tunus, and high-paying
jobs might all be made fair. Im
agine a world housing draw
(winners in (irosse Point, losers
in Bangladesh). The implications
are earth-shaking.
