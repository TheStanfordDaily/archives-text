# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Phillip Bernard 'Rush' your spiritual faith 
### 
This quarter, "Rush time,"
many students will put a lot of
ellort into the quest to belong to
sororities and fraternities. I often
ask myself why, in general, are
Stanford students only willing to
search lor their niches in certain
specific areas and not in others?
I suppose I will make some
people uncomfortable by discus
sing a subject which most of us

have not been zealous in search
ing out, though we often acknow
lege its importance to us. 1 am
referring to the basis for our
spiritual faith,
Is the basic belief in God as far
as we are willing to go, so as not
to bring complications or con
flicts into our lives? The answer
to this question can only be
found in ourselves.
More than a few of us here are
unsure of our beliefs and many
strongly question them. We,
however, almost neve r go
further, and attempt to learn
more about our faith. How many
times have we said to ourselves,
"Someday, I will find out more
about my faith and better define
my beliefs . . . someday." How
many times has that chance been
presented and how many times
have we turned our backs on it?
I know that I did a number of
times. Whenever I stumbled into
my dormitory's Bible study, I
would sheepishly apologize and
quickly and quietly make my
exit, all the while feeling very
uneasy and ambivalent about my
unwillingness to ask the group
questions that concerned me
very much about my Christian
faith.
Sound familiar? It took me
three years before 1 finally ac
cepted someone else's challenge
to broaden the "search" to other
areas, notably, my spiritual self. I

learned a great deal as a result
and the experience has had a
great impact on my life.
Let me then assert to you that
the time to gain the knowledge
ahout our respective faith is now
and not later. I also want to chal
lenge every student at Stanford
to set aside at least one or two
hours each week to expose them
selves to their faith. Join an in
vestigative Bible study, read
hooks pertaining to the subject,
talk to a priest, rabbi, minister,
or just think about it alone, but
take that first step!
If you are interested in
another religion besides your
own, get in touch with the diffe
rent campus organizations, get
books on the subject, expose
yourself to it. This may lead
nowhere, but the knowledge
gained will be invaluable.
The challenge I offer is simple
to accept and yet, paradoxically
difficult because our environ
ment defines such activities as
unintellectual. and our investiga
tions will by pityingly viewed by
some as an attempt to "find a
crutch" — but, this is one search
that we must all actively pursue
or else continue our existence
with an uneasy feeling of
"spiritual ignorance," unable to
answer the skeptic who simply
asks us why we hold this faith.
