Develop the best
Steve Kaye and David
Morandi (Daily, Apr. 8) argue
that homosexual impulses
should be encouraged. This is in
the tradition of Sigmund Freud
that we should encourage our
worst tendencies because sup
pressing them might do us harm.
This is a philosophy of weak
ness and surrender. It is also an
abnegation of our responsibility
to life.
The fact is that we have the
power to go in any direction that
we want to go and to make of our
lives whatever we want to make
of them. Instead of encouraging
ourselves and others in the de
velopment of our worst poten
tialities. we should rather seek to
develop our best and highest
potentialities.
This is the philosophy of
strength, courage and hope.

Week condemned
One of the qualities that dis
tinguishes Stanford today is the
opportunity the campus provides
for almost every conceivable
opinion to be heard. This hard
won privilege was achieved by
student efforts less than 20 years
ago, and it could too easily be
taken for granted. The Hillel
Board's condemnation of Pales
tinian Awareness Week is totally
out of keeping with the spirit that
maintains the University as an
open forum.
In claiming that Palestinian
Awareness Week will be "harm
ful to Israel and the Jewish
people" Hillel undermines the
once-valued Jewish tradition in

this country of championing the
free and open expression of un
popular views. Certainly neither
American Jews nor Israelis could
have anything to fear from the
scheduled talks b\ scholars,
poets and representatives of
women's groups — especially
since there will be ample oppor
tunity to question, challenge and
discuss what is said.
The conflict between Arabs
and Israelis has been marked by
violent rhetoric as well as terror
and bloodshed. Official com
munication is limited to the hurl
ing of charges back and forth,
making it impossible even to
begin negotiations that could
lead to peace. Palestinian
Awareness Week is an honora
ble attempt to provide insight
into one of the groups involved
in this conflict and offers an op
portunity to exchange ideas that
is seldom available in the outside
world. To condemn such an ef
fort is not in the interests of
either Israelis or Palestinians,
much less those of us who seek
an understanding of issues that
will ultimately affect us all.

Honor at LOTS
When I logged in to LOTS a
few days ago, I was greeted with
the news that certain practices
aimed at increasing one's access
to LOTS, such as pretending to
take more LOTS-related courses
than is actually the case, "bor
rowing" someone else's account,
etc.. have been declared to be
Honor Code violations.
This came as no surprise to
me, since it has always been clear
that the LOTS management
would frown on such things; evi

dcntly the combination of non
enforcement, administrative lax
it) (due presumably to shortage
of LOTS staff), and the desperate
conditions prevailing at the end
of last quarter led to such an in
crease in frequency of these in
fractions that someone decided
to "blow the whistle."
Now that the Honor Code has
been brought into play, no doubt
all Stanford students will im
mediately cease to misuse
LOTS!
On examining an old blue
book, 1 discover in paragraph B
that, "The faculty will also avoid,
as far as practicable, academic
procedures that create tempta
tions to violate the Honor Code"
and realize that the Code is a
two-edged weapon.
Maybe the provision of insuf
ficient facilities for computer
based classwork is not really an
"academic procedure," but then
neither is the LOTS time alloca
tion system which we are being
asked to respect in the name of
the Honor Code. There can be
no doubt that the temptation to
violate it in the ways described
above has been overwhelming.
I call on the faculty and Uni
versity to uphold their obliga
tions under the Honor Code.

Subliminal ad
I have heard about subliminal
advertising and I siull remember
a little from my Nth grade educa
tion in human sexuality, but I am
grateful nonetheless to Data Sys
tems. whose April 1 Oth adver
tisement on page three of the
Daily provides me with the ideal
diagrammatic and written de
monstration of both.
I now also have a pretty good
idea of what Data Systems might
do with my career if I entrusted
them with it. All I need to figure
out is whether Data Systems is a
serious engineering firm or a
house of male prostitution.

Police justified
Mr. Jones works40 miles from
his home and each morning he
must face a long and boring drive
to his job. He usually drives 70
mph to be sure he gets to work on
time.
Last Monday on his way to
work Jones was pulled over by a
police officer and issued a cita
tion for speeding.
If we follow the reasoning of
the Daily editorial, (April 9),
"Random arrest is unfair," the
policeman's action was "ran
dom" and "capricious." After
all, Jones had been speeding for
the last three years and had

never been cited before.
Just as it would be ridiculous
tor Jones to feel that he had been
unfairly treated when he had
clearly broken the law, it is
ridiculous for anyone to claim
that the people arrested last
week for. publicly engaging in
homosexual acts were treated
unjustly.
The issue here is not one of
society's acceptance or nonac
ceptance of homosexuality: the
issue is what behavior society
considers appropriate in a public
place.
The writers of the Daily edito
rial seem to think that it was un
fair to arrest 10 people "at ran
dom." However, it would be im
possible to arrest evcyone who
had ever committed the act. and
if they had not arrested anyone
the situation would have re
mained unchanged. Arrests are
always random in the sense that
not all those who commit a crime
are arrested.
The Stanford police perhaps
showed too much restraint by al
lowing sexual acts to go on in a
public rcstroom. Because of
their consideration for those in
volved earlier, other Stanford
students were sub jected to a dis
turbing and embarrassing ex
perience. Their right to privacy
was infringed upon.
When people's rights are in
fringed upon it is the law's duty
to step in to protect those rights.
The Stanford police were well
justified in the action they took.

Census column scary
Surely David Miller jests in his
column "Treat U.S. census as a
joke." Otherwise, as a census
enumerator-to-be. I find his pos
ition on the census downright
scan. While dealing with people
ol his persuasion may increase
my term of employment, the
working conditions will not be
enhanced.
Miller aserts that "resisting
the census is one way to slow the
bureaucratic monster down a
bit." True enough, but the citi
zens will pay for that slowdown
directly because the census it
sclI will take longer to compile
and indirectly because incom
plete or inaccurate information
can only lead to a more inef
ficient government between
19cS() and 1990. According to
Bryce Nelson of The Los Angeles
Times, "the evidence suggests it
would be virtually impossible for
the nation's governmental units
and business concerns to operate
efficiently without such informa
tion, a major reason why 125
other nations conduct a regular
census." Surely Miller as a
graduate student in physics can
appreciate attempts to quantify;
demographers as well as physi
cists need data. And surely as a
graduate student, lie's mature
enough not to throw the lorm
away, an action analagous, I

think, to throwing away the
RSVP to a friend's party and
then showing up anyway.
Miller appears paranoid that
the "Feds" will use the census
information to promote das
tardly deeds. The Fed is com
posed of citizens who are neither
more nor less moral than their
private sector counterparts. The
demonstrated benefits of the
census outweigh the hypotheti
cal risks.

Commoner a fraud
In his campus appearance. Or.
Barry Commoner exhorted his
audience to place power in the
hands of "the people." Who are
"the people?" Commoner only
made rather obscure references
to "local co-operatives" and
usually distinguished his favored
groups by characteristics of
"smallness" and "localness."
It is somewhat incredible and
incredibly naive that Common
er should talk of raising the liv
ing standard while suggesting a
return to some kind of small-is
beautiful cottage industry stan
dard for American business.
At the reception after his talk.
Commoner revealed more speci
fically what he meant by "social
governance" when society must
make larger scale economic deci
sions. He suggested that a team
of scientists (such as a biologist, a
chemist, a physicist and so on)
could and should have predicted
the effects of auto pollution on
the environment and required

the auto industry in 1946 to pro
duce only small cars.
Commoner further suggested
that oil and gas could be allo
cated between states by vote of
Congress. Presumably, Com
moner would again turn to teams
of scientists and administrators
to reallocate resources on a day
to-day basis to take into account
idiosyncrasies that Congress
couldn't foresee.
When I consider the impact of
real world complexities on his
plans, I find Commoner to be a
fraud. What he really wants is
control by a scientific and
bureaucratic elite such as himself
with views such as his own. The
last thing he wants is control by
the very consumer he pretends to
"protect;" after all, they all
wanted big cars in 1946.
With characteristic faulty
reasoning. Commoner advo
cated government subsidies for
workers trying to keep an out
moded and uneconomic steel
plant open while claiming that
his "social governance" would
increase the overall standard of
living. Just one cost of this alloca
tion would be lagging investment
and jobs in new industries with
out political constituency.
I don't ask that Commoner re
ject his fundamentally elitist
views — only that he honestly
assess the trade-offs between ef
ficiency and equality, and bet
ween consumer choice and social
governance.
