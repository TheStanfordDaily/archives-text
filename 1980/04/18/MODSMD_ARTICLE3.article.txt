### 
From the Daily wire services
WASHING TON — President Jimmy Carter
imposed additional economic sanctions on Iran
yesterday and warned that he may take military
action — such as a naval blockade or mining of
Iranian ports — il U.S. hostages are not freed
soon.
Carter set no deadline for resorting to force
of arms but his comments, aimed both at
Tehran and at U.S. allies who are in the process
of deciding how firmly to support Carter's
sanctions, constituted the administration's
most direct warning since the crisis began that
military moves could come shortly.
"The measures which I am announcing
today are still non-belligerent in nature," Car
ter said. "The authorities in Iran should realize,
however, that the availability of peaceful mea
sures, like the patience of the American
people, is running out."

Taking military action against Iran, he said,
"is tlie prerogative and right of the United
States," if peaceful efforts fail to resolve the
hostage crisis.
The new sanctions include a ban on Ameri
can travel to Iran, financial transactions with
Iran by anyone in the United States and the
payment of reparations to families of the
American hostages, using Iranian government
assets frozen in U.S. banks and their overseas
subsidiaries.
He also said weapons that were ordered by
Iran before the crisis, but which have been
impounded by the U.S. government, will be
sold or diverted to American defense use.
Prohibition of imports
In addition, the president said at a nationally
broadcast news conference he will prohibit all
imports from Iran, even though trade between
the two countries already is virtually nonexis

tent. He also said he is prepared to ask other
nations to cooperate in barring international
communications to ant' from Iran.
Only food and medicine have been un
touched by the trade cutoff so far and Carter
said he will ban those few shipments that have
continued unless the American hostages are
freed.
Carter also appealed to American news or
ganizations to limit their activities in Iran, but
said he would not interfere in press operations.
Military action
If the new sanctions arc not effective, the
president said, "the next step will be military
action."
It is known that the administration has con
sidered as military options the mining of Ira
nian oil ports or a naval blockade.
But Carter was not specific about how he
might use force against Iran, saying, "I have

not discussed specific military steps with our
allies that I might take." How .ver, he hinted at
the naval blockade option, noting that "the
interruption of commerce with Iran" is a logi
cal move.
Europe
A naval blockade could interrupt trade bet
ween Iran and other countries, including West
ern Europe, which is heavily reliant on oil im
ports.
"We are still attempting to avoid that kind of
action," he said. "But we cannot preclude that
kind of action."
In effect, Carter directed a double-barreled
warning to Tehran and to the capitals of this
country's allies that the United States now con
siders the hostage situation so grave that it is
willing to cut off the flow of Iranian oil by
military action regardless of the impact on the
economies of Western Europe and Japan.

Discussing action to cut off Iran's oil ship
ments. Carter said:
" It would be severe in its consequences with
Iran and much less severe for any particular
customer of Iran. A total interruption of Ira
nian oil shipments to other countries would not
be a devastating blow to those countries. It
would certainly be an inconvenience; it would
certainly be serious. We have been trying to
avoid that kind of action and we are still at
tempting to avoid that kind of action. But I
cannot preclude that option for the future if it
becomes necessary."
The implication was clear. It will not profit
any country to hold back in its own sanctions
against Iran for fear of losing oil shipments
because, if international political and economic
measures prove inadequate to tree the hos
tages. petroleum shipments will be blocked
anyway.

Iran by anyone in the United States and the
payment of reparations to families of the
American hostages, using Iranian government
assets frozen in U.S. banks and their overseas
subsidiaries.
He also said weapons that were ordered by
Iran before the crisis, but which have been
impounded by the U.S. government, will be
sold or diverted to American defense use.
Prohibition of imports
In addition, the president said at a nationally
broadcast news conference he will prohibit all
imports from Iran, even though trade between
the two countries already is virtually nonexis

tent. He also said he is prepared to ask other
nations to cooperate in barring international
communications to ant' from Iran.
Only food and medicine have been un
touched by the trade cutoff so far and Carter
said he will ban those few shipments that have
continued unless the American hostages are
freed.
Carter also appealed to American news or
ganizations to limit their activities in Iran, but
said he would not interfere in press operations.
Military action
If the new sanctions arc not effective, the
president said, "the next step will be military
action."
It is known that the administration has con
sidered as military options the mining of Ira
nian oil ports or a naval blockade.
But Carter was not specific about how he
might use force against Iran, saying, "I have

not discussed specific military steps with our
allies that I might take." How .ver, he hinted at
the naval blockade option, noting that "the
interruption of commerce with Iran" is a logi
cal move.
Europe
A naval blockade could interrupt trade bet
ween Iran and other countries, including West
ern Europe, which is heavily reliant on oil im
ports.
"We are still attempting to avoid that kind of
action," he said. "But we cannot preclude that
kind of action."
In effect, Carter directed a double-barreled
warning to Tehran and to the capitals of this
country's allies that the United States now con
siders the hostage situation so grave that it is
willing to cut off the flow of Iranian oil by
military action regardless of the impact on the
economies of Western Europe and Japan.

Discussing action to cut off Iran's oil ship
ments. Carter said:
" It would be severe in its consequences with
Iran and much less severe for any particular
customer of Iran. A total interruption of Ira
nian oil shipments to other countries would not
be a devastating blow to those countries. It
would certainly be an inconvenience; it would
certainly be serious. We have been trying to
avoid that kind of action and we are still at
tempting to avoid that kind of action. But I
cannot preclude that option for the future if it
becomes necessary."
The implication was clear. It will not profit
any country to hold back in its own sanctions
against Iran for fear of losing oil shipments
because, if international political and economic
measures prove inadequate to tree the hos
tages. petroleum shipments will be blocked
anyway.
