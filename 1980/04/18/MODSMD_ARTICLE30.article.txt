# Friday Forum Flounders
## 
### 
Once upon the Farm, the Friday Forum was a fledgling
feature. First the Forum flourished. We Hipped! Then the
Forum fizzled. We fidgeted. Now,the Forum is floundering.
We are flagging. We won't feign fine, the Forum is fated. Feed
back's been fantastic but we will finish off the feeble Forum if
you don't want it.
You've told us that you like the Forum. We like it, too and
we'd like to continue, but it won t unless you write.
Next week's topic is the housing Draw. Is the Draw fair?
Does it work? Isn't there a better way? (What does it feel like
to draw 5000?)
Don't let the Forum fail. Send columns, letters and cartoons
to the Daily, Storke Publications Building, Stanford, CA
94305 by Wednesday noon. Submissions should be typed,
double-spaced, on a 57-space line, must be signed and are
subject to editing.
