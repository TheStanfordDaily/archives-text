# Libraries acquire computer catatlogs

The University libraries now maintain a
computerized card catalog containing infor
mation on every book processed through the
library system since 1973.
Computer terminals are located at most
reference desks of the various branches.
The Research Libraries Information Net
work (RLIN) is one ot the most advanced
systems available. The catalog is the offspr
ing of the library's BALLOTS project, a
computerized bibliography that uses a time
sharing system.
BALLOTS opened here in 1976 with only
a typewriter terminal in the reference de
partment. Then in 1978 Stanford and 14
other universities formed the Stanford-based
Research Libraries Group, which was in
strumental in starting widespread use of the
bibliographical system throughout the Un

ited States.
To date, 17 computers have been installed,
and plans for future expansion are underway.
A major asset of RLIN is its potential time,
cost and space saving factors — for both lib
rarians and patrons.
Systems librarian David McDonald cited
numerous advantages to using RLIN. "For
one thing, it saves a hell of a lot of walking.
You can stay at one library and search the
computer catalogs for books at every other
branch," said McDonald.
Unlike the card catalog, RLIN also lists
those books still being processed. Thus
books that would otherwise be unavailable
can be traced and checked out, according to
McDonald.
Trained library personnel type key words
into the computer terminals, and seconds
later bibliographical information appears on
the screen. The student can find out in a
matter of minutes how many books are avail-

able on a given subject, where they are lo
cated and how many copies are accessible.
If either the title, author or subject is
known, RLIN can provide the bibliographi
cal information.
If the material requested is not available
on campus, RLIN can conduct a search and
find out which universities have the materials
needed. The Stanford Library can then send
a loan request to that library. This saves time
by eliminating guessing as to which library
might have the desired materials.
RLIN also keeps track of books on order
from various book companies. If a company
is overdue in delivering ordered books, the
computer will print out a notice reminding
the company to send the books.
McDonald foresees an endless number of
possibile uses for RLIN. "In addition to
Stanford's own holdings, we also connect to
the Library of Congress and 100 other
cooperating libraries around the country."
