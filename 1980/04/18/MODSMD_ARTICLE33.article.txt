So, here we are, moving briskly into the meaty
part of the quarter. Don't worry, On Call will not
lag behind — as long as you continue to submit
reams of questions. Keep 'em rolling.
How many Stanford students contract VD annu
ally?
- Merely Asking
I can't answer your particular question because
of the sensitivity of the issue and, hence, the sig
nificant portion of venereal disease cases that are
unreported. I can, however, cite the statistics on
the VD cases treated at Cowell.
According to Dr. John Dorman, 20 cases of
gonorrhea were diagnosed at Cowell in 1979. That
figure seemed to surprise some people for totally
different reasons. Some people said, "wow, that
many." My impression was: is that all? Dorman
recounted.
On the average, around two cases of syphilis are
observed at Cowell yearly. Cowell also began over
the past two months to accumulate data on herpes,
and seven positive cultures have been noted since
the first of March.
Let's temporarily digress to another tasteful sub
ject.
I'd like to know about the evils of coffee versus
tea. Which has a higher caffeine level and which is
better for one's health? I've heard conflicting re
ports.
- Wired
Your question depends upon how the beverage
is prepared, said Dr. Vincent D'Andrea of Coun
seling and Psychological Services (CAPS). Gener
ally speaking, coffee has more caffeine than tea,
although a strong, brown tea, such as British
blends, may be equivalent in caffeine content to
coffee. Coffee does contain more acid, which
stimulates the stomach muscles. Since stomach
muscle reaction to such stimulation results in
hunger pangs, it would be better to drink tea rather
than coffee on a diet.
Can I get a cholesterol test at Cowell? Are there
requirements to be met? I have always drunk a lot of
milk and still do and am worried about my choles
terol level.
- Natural Milk Lover
Yes, your cholesterol level can be tested at Cow
ell, but you need a doctor's order for the test. You

should make an appointment to see a doctor any
way if you are concerned about the quantity of milk
you consume. Dr. D' Andrea affirmed that it is true
that people with a heavy intake of dairy products
do have higher blood levels of cholesterol. Not
milk alone is involved, though. Diets consisting of
large amounts of eggs, ice cream and whole milk
contribute to cholesterol build-up. Family history
is another important factor.
Even college age individuals need to be aware of
cholesterol levels, D'Andrea said. He recalled au
topsies performed on young soldiers killed during
the Korean War, in which high levels of cholesterol
were discovered. The cholesterol was thought to be
caused by diet and stress.
Why do men reach the peak of their sexual activity
earlier than women when men mature physically
and emotionally later?
- Growing
Females do usually enter puberty sooner than
males and remain physically one or two years
ahead of males during the early stages of adoles
cence. Puberty begins between the ages of 9 and 12
for most girls, and menstruation starts between 11
and 14. For boys, puberty is initiated at age 10 or
11 and lasts a little longer than it does in girls.
According to the Kinsey report as quoted in The'
Fundamentals of Human Sexuality, males attain'
their highest rates of sexual outlet between the ages'
of 16 and 20 and maintain that rate for a decade.,
The peak female decade occurs between 31 and 40.
In fact, the book states, "On the basis of sexual
responsiveness alone (and obviously there are!
many other considerations), we should match the
adolescent boy with the woman almost twice his
age."
The reasons for this phenomenon are hard to pin
down. It is easier for a male to be sexually aroused
and achieve orgasm than it is for a female,
D'Andrea pointed out. Thus, he said, it seems that
a woman's sexuality is much more complicated
than a man's and that women need more time to
learn and catch up sexually.
"The saying is that women get better and better
as they get older," D'Andrea intoned. "1 think it's
because they get and give more permission as they
become more experienced. It's a psycho-social oc
currence."
