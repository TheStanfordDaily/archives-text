## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Stanford's men's tennis team
strengthened its claim to the
No. 1 ranking in the ration
Wednesday as it handed pre
viously No. 1 ranked UC-
Berkeley a convincing 6-3 de
feat. For the Cardinals, the win
avenged two earlier 5-4 losses to
Cal. and placed Stanford atop
the prestigious Pac-10 confer
ence with a 5-1 record.
The Cards started their play
under hot sunny skies at the var
sity courts and sophomore Scott
Bondurant. playing No. 4 for the
first time, put them quickly on
the scoreboard with a 6-2,6-3
trouncing of Cat's Phil Lenhoff.
Constantly attacking the net.
"Bon Man" continually forced
Lenhoff to miss passing shots
and fall prey to his sharply ang
led volleys.
But the lead was soon to be
extinguished as Cal then fol
lowed with a pair of victories at
the No. 5 and 6 positions. Play
ing No. 5, Stanford's Dave
Siegler had a chance to take the
first set as he was serving at 5-4
andup2-o,butCal'sMike Bauer
rifled strong returns to break
Siegler and go on to defeat him
7-5,6-4. The No. 6 match was
also a case of missed oppor
tunities for Stanford as the
Cards' freshman Jim Gurfein.
playing well in his first Pac-10
singles match, had captured the
first set 6-4 and was up a service
break in the second set. but lost
his own serve and the second set
tie breaker before falling in the
third set in a 4-6,7-6,6-3 defeat.

Senior Lloyd Bourne, in the
feature match of the afternoon,
then scored perhaps the pivotal
win of the day for Stanford rally
ing from a 1 -4 deficit in the third
set to defeat Cal's senior Ail-
American Chris "Slam" Dunk
6-3, 3-6, 6-4. Bourne, inspired by
the loud partisan crowd on hand,
broke Dunk's serve at 2-4 as
Dunk double faulted on the no
ad point, held serve, and then
rallied for the final nine points of
the match. Bourne served the
match out by booming four win
ning first serves to Dunk, send
ing the crowd into a frenzy and
tying the team score at 2-2?
The second and third doubles
teams for Stanford then scored
two crucial wins, as Tim Mayotte
and Jeff Arons. playing perhaps
their finest match of the season,
outlasted the tough Bear duo.
Scott McCain and Randy Nixon
6-2, 3-6, 7-5, and Siegler and
Bondurant combined for a 7-6,
6-1 win over Mike Bauer and
Miles Walker. After breezing
through the first set. Mayotte
and Arons found themselves in
the third set down a break at 3-4
with McCain serving. but the
Card tandem broke McCain's
serve with strong ground strokes
and retriev ing lobs, and fowled
with another service break to
take the deciding third set. In the
N0.3 doubles match. Bondurant
and Siegler held onto the first set
tie breaker on simultaneous set
point at 4-4 as Siegler forced
Bauer to narrowly miss a bac
khand return. The Stanford pair,
seeming to gel as a doubles team
in the last two matches, then

breezed to an easy 6-1 win in the
second set.
From the sunny varsity courts,
the Cards moved inside to
Maples Pavilion to the tunes of
"All Right Now" and the Stan
ford Marching Band. With a
comfortable 4-2 lead, they
needed only one win in the three
remaining matches to clinch the
victory. Sophomore sensation
Tim Mayotte wasted no time in
prolonging death for the Golden
Bears as he defeated Ail-
American Marty Davis 7-6,6-2,
stretching his undefeated Pac-10
singles record to 6-0 and his sea
son's win streak to thirteen.
Neither Mayotte nor Dav is. both
playing strong serve and volley
games on the fast indoor carpet,
lost the serves going into the tie
breaker, although Mayotte
struggled from two set points at
5-6. In the tie breaker. Mayotte
took control winning the first
point on Davis' serve and hold
ing on to take the tie breaker 5-1.
With both the crowd and
Mayotte sensing victory, Tim
then cinched the team win by de
stroying Davis 6-2 in the second
set.
With the team victory already
clinched. Peter Rennert then
took the courts to show the
crowd why he's the No. 1 ranked
amateur in the nation as he de
feated Cal's McCain. Rennert.
using a variety of spins which
held well on the indoor carpet,
crushed McCain 6-3.6-1. In all.
Rennert fired 9 aces and was
never seriously pressed on his
own serve. The decisive service
break in the first set came at 3-3

as Rennert first used a drop shot
winner and then a top spin lob
winner to all but finish off Mc-
Cain.
Rennert then teamed with
Bourne in the No. 1 doubles
match against Davis and Dunk
with Stanford holding a 6-2 lead,
the Cal pair defeated Stanford's
top team for the third time by a
margin.
Reflecting on the win. coach
Dick Gould, who made three
lineup changes which appeared
to strengthen the team, was
pleased with the teams response
to the changes. "1 was especially
pleased with Lloyd coming back
from a 1-4 deficit in the third set
and also the way that Arons
played in the second doubles. It
was a very solid win for us. Now
we've got to waste no time in
preparing for Trinity and Pep
perdine. They are the four and
five ranked teams in the country,
so they are very important teams
to beat in terms of confidence
and seedings for the nationals."
Indeed Saturday's match with
Trinity will feature two of the
most intriguing matchups of the
season for Stanford's top two
pair, Rennert and Mayotte,
Mayotte will match up against
Eric Iskersky, NCAA doubles
champion and singles finalist last
season, and Rennert will be pit
ted against Tonv Giamalva.
These two matches will be
played at Maples starting at 6:30
Saturday evening and will be
preceeded by the day matches at
the varsity courts beginning at 1
p.m. Stanford will host fifth
ranked Pepperdine on Tuesday.
