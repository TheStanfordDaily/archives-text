# The 						Friday Interview
## Cardinal net coach: Good as Gould 
### 
I Editor's Note: In his 13 sea
sons as head coach of the Stan
ford men's tennis team, Dick
Gould has lead the Cardinals to
four NCAA team titles - 1973,
'74, '71 and '78. Sixteen players
under Gould have been named
All-America, and the team overall
has finished in the NCAA's top
five the past 10 seasons.
But statistics alone do not tell
the entire Dick Gould story. He is
known nationwide as an author
(he wrote Tennis, Anyone?, one
of the most successful instruc
tional tennis books ever written),
innovator and instuctor. Now, in
the midst of one of the Cardinals'
toughest weeks of the season,
Gould took time to talk with
Daily interviewer Sally Jenkins in
today's Friday Interview.)
Jenkins: In another interview
you said something to the effect
that tennis players expect every
thing to be handed to them on a
silver platter, and Pete Rennert
disagreed with you.
Gould: I did not say that. What I
said was this: Tennis is an indi
vidual sport. Athletes in tennis
receive privileges at a very young
age, they receive free rackets,
tennis clothes, shoes from sport
ing goods organizations. Nor
mally you write a thank-you note
when you receive a gift. How
many notes do you think get sent
to sporting goods organizations?
The kids begin to take it for
granted, and I don't mean that in
a derogatory way. But the tennis
athlete has to fight the tendency

and fact that he can be put on a
pedestal, especially at a tourna
ment. Everyone wants to house
John McEnroe at their own
home, or in a junior tournament,
the number one or two seeded
player. It takes a person who has
had a very proper upbringing to
keep things in perspective, I
think. We have been very fortu
nate at Stanford. The athletes
here do keep things in perspec
tive.
Jenkins: Pete Rennert has also
said that someone like McEnroe's
behavior is just his personality on
the court, and that it is helpful to
the game in terms of it being a
spectator sport. What do you
think about that?
Gould: I don't want to com
ment on what Pete said, so di
vorce me from that. '"Mac" is a
very high strung individual, the
highest strung that I have ever
met. If he is sittingand talking to
you, he just can't sit still, he's all
over the place. That comes out
especially in a pressure situation.
There is a way to talk to
people. You don't want to put
them on the defensive or embar
rass them in front of other
people. If you are not upset, you
can simply turn to a linesman and
just say that you think he blew
that one, without throwing him
looks. "Mac" 's personality is
great; he is one of the greatest
guys we have ever had on the
team, and he was an excellent
team player. I think he really


Dick Gould
cared about it. In collegiate
matches there are no linemen or
i-r-,; umpires. and I never saw him
have a problem when there was
no umpire on the court. 1 think
it's his frustration that he is vent
ing, though ideally there is a bet
ter way to do that. But it's very
hard when you're a hypertense
person.
•H, \s for it being good for the
game. 1 think it's good to have
(individuality. I'd like to think
that sports has hero models, in
|terms of morals and ethics and
things like that. Ideally you want
, v „jthem to be someone that your
daughter or son can emulate.
k fP«,;You can have individualities
,without their making obscene
gestures on the court. No indi
t», . v idual is above the sport, and no
sport is above life. And 1 want to
emphasi/c that I'm not talking
<i... about John. In collegiate play he
excellent. I also think he's
very exciting to watch. He does
have a distinct personality and
,i „ vitality: in that sense it's very
..V good for the sport.
<hi r Jenkins: There have been feu
<o> players in the last few years thai
have stayed the full four years at
fitanford. Hid you have anything
to do with Peter Rennert's deci
lg~*sion to stay for his last year?
Gould: I doubt it. 1 have not
( '.4 put pressure on any player with
v» the exception of Roscoe Tanner.
'"^ s a matter of fact, everyone ex

quarter to go. Even though they
turn pro, they were also students
at the same time. John McEnroe
was such a tremendous talent
that in retrospect he made the
right decision. College was great
for him At 1S it's very hard to go
into the tour, where you are
traveling constantly.
I have never really talked
about it with Pete, he just came
back. All I ask is that they don't
surprise me. that they give me
some indication before I read
about it in the paper. Obviously I
am very pleased that he came
back. A lot of times a guy will
actually hurt himself by coming
back, but Pete has handled it
beautifully. and he is still improv -
ing his game. Because of his
mental attitude he enjoys the
team concept, and he has a very
realistic approach to competi
tion.
And he has been through it all;
he knows what it's like to play
sixth and seventh, and what it's
like to play first. 1 think he is a
better person and competitor for
it.and it hasn't been easy for
him.
Jenkins: Do you think Matt
Mitchell will he able to make it on
the pro tour?
Gould: Oh yeah. He's a tre
mendous player. A lot of it is
going to depend on how patient
he is and how bad he wants it.
Matt is a very deep thinking indi
vidual: his mind is on a lot of
things besides tennis. That will
be the key — how lonu he can

sustain his interest. He's done
reasonably well so far, and his
results are improving steadily.
Jenkins: How long do you
think you wdl he able to keep
Scott Davis here?
Gould: 1 have no idea. His
father is a college graduate and
was a top player, so he's been in
the same situation. The point in
recruiting is that you go out and
get the best in the field, ev en if he
will be here only one year. You
don't recruit faculty members or
football coaches or students on
the basis of whether or not they
will fulfill the terms of the con
tract. even if they will be here
only for one year.
It he is the best there is, you go
out and get him; it he's here only
tor a year, you hope that he grew
and benefited and helped the
program. It's a fallacy to say that
you have to stay in school for a
degree: the degree does not
mean as much as everyone
thinks, it's the total experience
that really counts and is valuable.
Jenkins: It has been said that
the women's team does not get the
same recognition as the men's
team does, and that they deserve
it. Do you agree?
Gould: Obviously that is true.
The women have got a great
team. Alvcia Moulton is proba
bly the best collegiate player in
the country, and on any given
day is. She and Donna Rubin are
every bit as good an athlete as
Pete Rennert is in his own field.

It's a very young team, hut they
have done a great job. The men's
team does have a strong confer
ence. the women don't. Also, the
men play the top teams at home
and the women are playing only
two really strong teams at home.
So I would say that it's the par
ticular schedule rather than the
caliber of player that makes the
difference; I think that's the
perspective it should he put in,
and only for that reason. We
don't have a men's team and a
women's team here, we have a
tennis program, and I think the
athletes feel that. They share in
the victories and disappoint
ments.
Jenkins: Could you comment
on the results of Wednesday
night's mutch?
Gould: Obviously wc are very
happy about it, Cal has got a very
good team. There are six teams,
Cal, UCLA, Stanford and Pep
perdine are examples, that are
capable of beating each other on
any given day. We are coming off
three big wins, but we have
number four Trinity and number
three Pepperdine coming up, so
we can't really dwell too much on
the victory over Cal. The team is
improving rapidly, we have had
trouble with it, and we still ha
ven't put it together, hut I think
we will. Any six teams could win
this thing. It's tough, because in
1 2 days we play five of the best
teams in the country, so we do
have to look ahead.
