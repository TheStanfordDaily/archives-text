## Cardinal net coach: Good as Gould 
### 
I Editor's Note: In his 13 sea
sons as head coach of the Stan
ford men's tennis team, Dick
Gould has lead the Cardinals to
four NCAA team titles - 1973,
'74, '71 and '78. Sixteen players
under Gould have been named
All-America, and the team overall
has finished in the NCAA's top
five the past 10 seasons.
But statistics alone do not tell
the entire Dick Gould story. He is
known nationwide as an author
(he wrote Tennis, Anyone?, one
of the most successful instruc
tional tennis books ever written),
innovator and instuctor. Now, in
the midst of one of the Cardinals'
toughest weeks of the season,
Gould took time to talk with
Daily interviewer Sally Jenkins in
today's Friday Interview.)
Jenkins: In another interview
you said something to the effect
that tennis players expect every
thing to be handed to them on a
silver platter, and Pete Rennert
disagreed with you.
Gould: I did not say that. What I
said was this: Tennis is an indi
vidual sport. Athletes in tennis
receive privileges at a very young
age, they receive free rackets,
tennis clothes, shoes from sport
ing goods organizations. Nor
mally you write a thank-you note
when you receive a gift. How
many notes do you think get sent
to sporting goods organizations?
The kids begin to take it for
granted, and I don't mean that in
a derogatory way. But the tennis
athlete has to fight the tendency

and fact that he can be put on a
pedestal, especially at a tourna
ment. Everyone wants to house
John McEnroe at their own
home, or in a junior tournament,
the number one or two seeded
player. It takes a person who has
had a very proper upbringing to
keep things in perspective, I
think. We have been very fortu
nate at Stanford. The athletes
here do keep things in perspec
tive.
Jenkins: Pete Rennert has also
said that someone like McEnroe's
behavior is just his personality on
the court, and that it is helpful to
the game in terms of it being a
spectator sport. What do you
think about that?
Gould: I don't want to com
ment on what Pete said, so di
vorce me from that. '"Mac" is a
very high strung individual, the
highest strung that I have ever
met. If he is sittingand talking to
you, he just can't sit still, he's all
over the place. That comes out
especially in a pressure situation.
There is a way to talk to
people. You don't want to put
them on the defensive or embar
rass them in front of other
people. If you are not upset, you
can simply turn to a linesman and
just say that you think he blew
that one, without throwing him
looks. "Mac" 's personality is
great; he is one of the greatest
guys we have ever had on the
team, and he was an excellent
team player. I think he really
