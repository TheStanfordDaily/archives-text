# Massey calls plan 'best effort ever'
## Faculty Senate hears report on land use 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
The University is in the midst of a
major land use planning effort that is
the "most comprehensive and best ef
fort that Stanford has ever had," Wil
liam Massey, vice president for busi
ness and finance, said yesterday during
a Faculty Senate meeting.
In addition to land use, the senate
discussed the status of the new distribu
tion requirements for undergraduates,
and briefly touched on the increased
costs of energy and some trends in lib
rary use on campus.
The University needs to review its
long-range land use planning now be
cause Santa Clara County and Palo
Alto are in the process of reviewing
their own comprehensive plans, Mas
sey said. "We want to dovetail our

plans with theirs," he added.
The increased interest with respect
to open space and housing in the area is
another reason that the land use review
process has been started, he said.
"There are those who are fearful that
we have a diabolical plan that we are
keeping secret â€” or worse yet, no
plan at all," he said. The University
wants to show everybody that it does in
fact have a viable land use plan, he
added.
The comprehensive land use plan
should be completed and ready for re
view by the senate in June, he said.
Because comprehensive planning is
becoming more important in settling
disputes over land use in the courts,
Stanford must develop a plan consis
tent with the future needs of the Uni
versity, Planning Director Phil Wil

liams said.
Presently, the University is listed on
planning maps of local governments as
agricultural, residential or small busi
ness land, he said. Stanford needs to be
established as an academic institution
on the mapsol local governments, Wil
liams added.
In the view of the University,
academic land use includes faculty and
student housing, SLAC and other re
search facilities, but local communities
don't share this view, he said.
While he admitted that planning for
a period 30 years into the future was
"like tilting at distant windmills." he
said that future growth will probably
occur as a 112 illing-in process in the cent
ral campus.
Expansion could be into the ar
boretum area between the Quad and

the football stadium, Williams said.
"Perhaps it would be better to expand
here than into the foothills because en
vironmental pressures are less intense
and the infrastructures are in place," he
said.
The planners are basing their predic
tions on the assumption that the stu
dent body will not grow and that there
will be moderate growth in the number
of faculty and the amount of research
done here, Massey said.
In the past 10 years, while the stu
dent population has remained fairly
constant, faculty size has been increas
ing by 1 percent a year. University
Provost Donald Kennedy said.
Some growth must occur here so that
the faculty-student ratio will be com
parable to our "cohort" schools in the
East, he said.
The process of developing new dis
tribution requirements for under
graduates is "in the middle of the sub
committee stage" said Professor Caro
lyn L.ougee. chairman of the subcom
mittee.
The subcommittee of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies is reviewing
the recommendations of the seven de
partmental committees that reviewed
requirements for their departments,
she said.
A final report will be made to the
senate on May 18; Lougee said.
In other reports, energy costs here
have gone up substantially in the last
few months, said Kennedy.
The increases could cost an addi
tional $800,000 to $1 million this year
if steps are not taken to conserve, he
said.
Massey said that the oval in front of
the Quad is being refitted with irriga
tion and will be landscaped with flow
ers as a result of a $150,000 donation
made to the University by a couple who
likes to jog through the area.
