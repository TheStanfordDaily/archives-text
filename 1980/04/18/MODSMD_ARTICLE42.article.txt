# Netwomen to take on No. 1 Trojans
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
It would be a hard task to beat,
but a women's tennis victory this
afternoon and tonight over top
rated USC, would come very
close to matching the impact of
the men's lopsided 6-3 win over
No. 1 ranked California Wed
nesday .
The women, like the men. go
into the match with two prior los
ses to the top-ranked team. They
were beaten by the Trojans at
the Brigham Young Invitational
in late March and at USC April
4.
I he line-up is headed by four
returning AIAW All-Americas
and has proven, so far. to be
strong in every spot.
l eading the way is Trey Lewis
in the number one singles spot.
Lewis, in her two matches
against Stanford this year, has
split wins with the Cards' Alvcia
Moulton. Moulton edged Lewis
in the I 'tali tournament, but was
blasted 6-2.6-1 by Lewis in Los
A ngeles.
Plaving No. 2 singles for the
Trojans is returning All-
America Anna Maria Pernan
dez. Pcrnandez has yet to score a
\ ictory over Stanford this season
as Donna Rubin has put the
clamps on her twice. Rubin fol
lowed Moulton's victory in Utah
and then edged lernandez again
in Los Angeles 7-6.2-6.6-4 to
give the C ards their only victory
that day.
Pcrnandez is followed in the
line-up by Nina Vovdat. Voydat
is undekated against Stanford
this season as she has taken two

matches from Stanford freshman
Caryn Copeland.
Playing No. 4 is Anna Maria's
twin sister, Anna Lucia Pcrnan
dez. Anna Pucia is also a return
ing All-America and has yet to
lose to Stanford this year. Anna
Pucia has defeated Sue Rasmus
sen twice includinga three-setter
down in Los Angeles.
Ann White will play fourth for
the Trojans. White is also with
out a loss to the Cards and scored
an impressive 6-1,6-0
whitewashing of Lisa Gordon
down in Los Angeles.
Rounding out USCs top six is
another returning All-America,
Sheila Mclnemey. Mclnerney
has never lost a match to Stan
ford this season, either. Mclner
ney won a decisive victory in
I'tali, but had her hands full with
Gayle Chan in Los Angeles be
fore winning 6-3.6-4.
I ernandez teams with White
m the doubles competition and
together they form one of the
toughest teams around. White
and Pewis destroyed Moulton
and Rasmussen 6-2.6-0 in Pos
Angeles earlier this season and
will play the No. 1 evening
match.
Anna Maria Pcrnandez teams
with Mclnerney in the No. 2
doubles spot and Anna Pucia
w ill play with either Susie Brown
or Voydat in the third spot.
USC swept the doubles com
petition over Stanford in Pos
Angeles and will be looking at it
as one of their strengths.
The strength of Stanford's
line-up lies in their No. 1 and 2
singles spots. Moulton is consi

dered to be one of the best
women collegiate players in the
nation and has beaten Pewis
once this year.
Rubin, in the No. 2 spot, has
one of the most impressive re
cords on the Stanford singles
ladder and has yet to lose a sing
les match to the Trojans.
The No. 3 and 4 singles spots
have also been strong for the
Cards and a restructured bottom
of the line-up has greatly im
proved what was considered to
be their weak link.
Copeland in the No. 3 spot and
Rasmussen at No. 4 have played
well against USC in all of their
matches, but have been narrowly
beaten in all matches.
The inexperienced 5 and 6
spots have been improving as the
year progressed, but will have to
be especially tough to challenge
the talented White at 5 and the
All-America Mclnerney at 6.

I he return of Julia Leighton.
who was out of the line-up with
shoulder problems, will bolster
the No. 5 spot and Lisa Gordon,
moved down to No. 6, will be
stronger.
Leighton narrowly edged
Gordon in a three-set challenge
match, but Gordon bounced
back to edge the freshman
walk-on Chan for the No. 6 posi
tion.
In the doubles, which accord
ing to coach Frank Brennan
"have really come around" since
the USC match, Stanford will
play Moulton and Rasmussen in
the No. 1 night match.
Moulton and Rasmussen
edged the No. 2 team of Cope
land and Rubin in a three-set
challenge match and won the
right to play in the indoor night
match and to get anothercrack at
the tough pair of Lewis and
White.

Rounding out USCs top six is
another returning All-America,
Sheila Mclnemey. Mclnerney
has never lost a match to Stan
ford this season, either. Mclner
ney won a decisive victory in
I'tali, but had her hands full with
Gayle Chan in Los Angeles be
fore winning 6-3.6-4.
I ernandez teams with White
m the doubles competition and
together they form one of the
toughest teams around. White
and Pewis destroyed Moulton
and Rasmussen 6-2.6-0 in Pos
Angeles earlier this season and
will play the No. 1 evening
match.
Anna Maria Pcrnandez teams
with Mclnerney in the No. 2
doubles spot and Anna Pucia
w ill play with either Susie Brown
or Voydat in the third spot.
USC swept the doubles com
petition over Stanford in Pos
Angeles and will be looking at it
as one of their strengths.
The strength of Stanford's
line-up lies in their No. 1 and 2
singles spots. Moulton is consi

dered to be one of the best
women collegiate players in the
nation and has beaten Pewis
once this year.
Rubin, in the No. 2 spot, has
one of the most impressive re
cords on the Stanford singles
ladder and has yet to lose a sing
les match to the Trojans.
The No. 3 and 4 singles spots
have also been strong for the
Cards and a restructured bottom
of the line-up has greatly im
proved what was considered to
be their weak link.
Copeland in the No. 3 spot and
Rasmussen at No. 4 have played
well against USC in all of their
matches, but have been narrowly
beaten in all matches.
The inexperienced 5 and 6
spots have been improving as the
year progressed, but will have to
be especially tough to challenge
the talented White at 5 and the
All-America Mclnerney at 6.

I he return of Julia Leighton.
who was out of the line-up with
shoulder problems, will bolster
the No. 5 spot and Lisa Gordon,
moved down to No. 6, will be
stronger.
Leighton narrowly edged
Gordon in a three-set challenge
match, but Gordon bounced
back to edge the freshman
walk-on Chan for the No. 6 posi
tion.
In the doubles, which accord
ing to coach Frank Brennan
"have really come around" since
the USC match, Stanford will
play Moulton and Rasmussen in
the No. 1 night match.
Moulton and Rasmussen
edged the No. 2 team of Cope
land and Rubin in a three-set
challenge match and won the
right to play in the indoor night
match and to get anothercrack at
the tough pair of Lewis and
White.
It would be a hard task to beat,
but a women's tennis victory this
afternoon and tonight over top
rated USC, would come very
close to matching the impact of
the men's lopsided 6-3 win over
No. 1 ranked California Wed
nesday .
The women, like the men. go
into the match with two prior los
ses to the top-ranked team. They
were beaten by the Trojans at
the Brigham Young Invitational
in late March and at USC April
4.
I he line-up is headed by four
returning AIAW All-Americas
and has proven, so far. to be
strong in every spot.
l eading the way is Trey Lewis
in the number one singles spot.
Lewis, in her two matches
against Stanford this year, has
split wins with the Cards' Alvcia
Moulton. Moulton edged Lewis
in the I 'tali tournament, but was
blasted 6-2.6-1 by Lewis in Los
A ngeles.
Plaving No. 2 singles for the
Trojans is returning All-
America Anna Maria Pernan
dez. Pcrnandez has yet to score a
\ ictory over Stanford this season
as Donna Rubin has put the
clamps on her twice. Rubin fol
lowed Moulton's victory in Utah
and then edged lernandez again
in Los Angeles 7-6.2-6.6-4 to
give the C ards their only victory
that day.
Pcrnandez is followed in the
line-up by Nina Vovdat. Voydat
is undekated against Stanford
this season as she has taken two

matches from Stanford freshman
Caryn Copeland.
Playing No. 4 is Anna Maria's
twin sister, Anna Lucia Pcrnan
dez. Anna Pucia is also a return
ing All-America and has yet to
lose to Stanford this year. Anna
Pucia has defeated Sue Rasmus
sen twice includinga three-setter
down in Los Angeles.
Ann White will play fourth for
the Trojans. White is also with
out a loss to the Cards and scored
an impressive 6-1,6-0
whitewashing of Lisa Gordon
down in Los Angeles.
