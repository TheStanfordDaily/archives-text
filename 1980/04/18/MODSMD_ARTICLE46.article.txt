Due to a schedule mix-up.
Fred Sturm's men's volleyball
team will play its final home
matches off-campus. Tonight the
Cardinals take on USC at De
Anza College, while tomorrow
the\ meet Pepperdine at Foothill
College. Both matches begin at
7:30 p.m.
The two matches were origi
nally going to be played in Roble
Gym. but a Folk Festival will
take place there instead.
The Cards enter this weekend
with a 7-10 overall record and
sport a 5-10 sjate against CIVA
foes. USC is tied for second in
the league, while Pepperdine is
currently sharing fifth place.
Assistant coach John Bekins
noted that USC is a strong offen
sive squad with a good deal of
talent, including three players
from the U.S. National team.
The Trojans also boast a number
of international athletes.
When asked about the USC
match. Bekins said. "We're
going to have to go out and play
our game. We don't want to let
them get their offense going. For

us to do well, we're going to have
to have a really good defensive
effort."
Pepperdine will bring a tall
group of players to the area in
what is a "must" match for them.
Noting that Pepperdine has
"extra incentive" to play well in
the match. Bekins commented,
"We have a good chance of
knocking them off and playing
the role of spoilers. It's incentive
for our team. They have a couple
of guys 6-8, 6-6, but they're not
that quick.
"We're going to try to exploit
that difference; it makes them a
little bit vulnerable."
Hitter Rod Fletcher, who suf
fered a mild ankle sprain last
weekend against Cal Poly-SLO,
hasn't participated in practice,
but he is expected to start to
night. Joining Fletcher at the hit
ter spots will be John McColl and
Tom Grimes, with Kip Engen
playing at setter. Jack Foxworth
and Kim Lum will start as middle
blockers.
Bekins remarked that the
coaches hope to play some team
members who haven't seen very
much action this season.
