# Cyclists pedal to third place

### 
As expected, a strong team
from UC-Santa Barbara made
off with a sweeping victory in the
Stanford Criterium bicycle race
held last Saturday morning
around Wilbur and Stern Halls.
Spectators were treated to
quite a show as UCSB earned a
massive 205 point total, followed
at a distance by Foothill College
with 92 points and Stanford,
third, with 90 points. The only
other complete teams fielded on
the flat, twisty course were
UC-San Diego, scoring 41
points, Claremont and Cal Poly,
both with 33 points.
The intercollegiate series
kicked off with a 16 lap, 20 km
women's race. Mary Viv Law
son, the sole representative of
Sacramento State, took
charge and put on an impressive
performance, winning first place
points on every prime lap. in
cluding the final sprint and the
race.
She was chased by Lvnn
Kingsland from UCSB in second
place, whose teammate Kristin
Skanderup barely edged out
Stanford's Liz Newberry for
third place. Taking fifth was De
bbie Packard of Claremont Col
lege, while Stanford women
Margie Bethke. Kathy Trieb and
Beverly Schlarb finished sixth.

1 Ith and 12th in their first race
ever.
The large novice field was a
beautiful sight rounding the nar
row course. John Geary won the
20-kilometer event for Foothill
College, Jim Harris of Cal Poly
came in second and Art Sable of
UCSB took third.
Stanford was well rep
resented. Stuart Rosse and
Christian Englehardt set a fast
pace for the race with an early
breakaway. Rosse finished sixth
in the event, teammate Juan
Salas took eighth in his first
race, while Dan Murphy, Gene
Reardon and Englehardt
finished in the field.
The 40-km expert race started
off rather slowly as no one
seemed willing to force the pace
and risk tiring. On such a flat
course it would be hard for a
breakaway group to hold an or
ganized chase by the field. Fi
nally. in the last laps a successful
break of five got away, but it
eventually disintegrated into two
groups, hotly pursued by the
field.
Mark Brandt, the talented
young sprinter of Foothill Col
lege, edged out Bob Meeker of
UCSB for first place, while Stan
ford's Bob Childs outsprinted his
own half of the break for third
place. Brad Cobb of UCSB
finished fourth, followed by Kurt

Sato of UC-San Diego. Finishing
for Stanford in the field sprint
were George Hermann in 10th
place and Bruce Pauly, 12th.
Next weekend, the Stanford
team travels to Santa Cruz to
compete on the rolling, hilly
course of the Capitola Criterium.
The sixth race in California's in
tercollegiate series, it will be the
key event in deciding the team
standings going into the intercol
legiate championships the fol
lowing weekend at UCSB. Each
school may count its top four
events' scores in their final total.
So far Stanford and Foothill
College have entered only three
races and stand to make an ap
preciable gain in Capitola, while
the three colleges ahead of them,
having already competed four
times, will only modify their
scores.
