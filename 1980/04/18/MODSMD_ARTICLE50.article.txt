## The
						New San Remo-that's some classy transformation 
### 
The New San Remo
2237 Mason St.
San Francisco
(415) 673-9090
Back in 1910, or even 1920,
when you walked into the San
Remo on Mason St., near
Fisherman's Wharf in San Fran
cisco, a dirty-aproned maid
would ask brusquely, "Steak or
chicken?" Having placed your
order she would point to the
back and tell you to sit down.
You would take your place on a
bench in the back with a clap on
the back or a guffaw from one of
your North Beach friends and
eat your supper. The food was
simple but good.
Well, The San Remo is still
simple and it is still good despite
the many changes that have
taken place since the early days.

Two and a half years ago Frank
Romaguera and his wife Eleanor
bought the San Remo and gave
the restaurant a complete face
lift. What the Romagueras did
was to take a good thing and
make it better.
When they stripped the tired
old linoleum tiles from the floor,
the Romagueras discovered an
old hardwood planked surface
just waiting to be cleaned and
polished. Now the hardwood
floor shines. Though the
Romagueras were not that lucky
with all the changes they warited
to make (they had to add the
tiled floor of the bar, the pressed

ceilings, and handsome paneling
of the dining room), the restaur
ant, now called The New San
Remo, fairly glows with spit and
polish.
Once they had the setting
right, the Romagueras set out to
find the people to help run the
restaurant the way they wanted
the restaurant to be run, that is,
with style. And though Frank
himself will greet you and his
wife will seat you, the staff of The
New San Remo has learned its
lessons well. Everyone we en
countered was skilled and pro
fessional. There were no false
airs of sophistication or deliber
ate snobbery because the staff
had class without it.
Our waitress, for example, was
knowledgeable, sweet and
genuinely interested in her job.

Although a friendly and relaxed
atmosphere pervades The New
San Remo, it is obvious that the
Romagueras want it that way.
The restaurant runs smoothly
and efficiently, so it is easy to
really sit back and enjoy a fine
meal. You sense that everyting
will be attended to, and it is.
The cocktail service was fast
and good; the drinks were small
and strong. Bread, sourdough of
course, arrived warm and the
butter was cold. The menu of
The New San Remo is diverse
and there are always several spe
cials of the day to choose from.
For the budget-conscious,there is

a Chef's Special Dinner for
$8.95 which includes soup of the
day, house salad, pasta of the
day, choice of entree and dessert.
Otherwise you order a la carte
and spend some money. But it's
worth it. Nothing is overpriced at
The New San Remo.
Appetizers, cold and hot, run
tor $3 to $4, salads between $1
and $3, and pasta costs about $5.
The choices are extremely varied
in all categories. My friend and 1
sampled escargut in mushroom
caps and calamari (squid) Vinag
rette. Both of these dishes were
outstanding. The escargot came
eight or 10 to the plate and were
properly seasoned, not over
whelmed with garlic. The
crockpot of calamari was stuffed
full with tender tangy meat and
was very nearly a meal in itself.
The homemade minestrone
and house salad which we sam
pled were quite good though the

dressing on the salad was, repor
tedly, bland. My soup was ex
tremely good, especially when
topped with a spoonful of the
freshly ground parmesan cheese
supplied to each table. Piping hot
and full of fresh vegetables, my
soup was a real treat.
Our wine was a California
Cabernet Sauvignon. a Louis
Martini 1975 to be exact. The
price, a very reasonable $9.50.
was typical of the good values in
domestic and imported brands at
The New San Remo. For $7.50
Wente Brothers' Grey Reisling
can be had, while for $22 one can
delight in France's Puliguy Mon
trachet. White wines are served
in small galvanized buckets at
the patrons' tables and are robed
in clean white linen. This small
touch was typical of the simple
charm one finds at The New San
Remo.
If our pasta was representative

*' the Rom " offerings,
nd I suspect i .lust try
some. Ours was a . honara and
it was laced with garlic, whole
egg and bits of bacon; and it
tasted fine, very fine. Our wait
ress spun the pasta into creamy
bacon-laden rolls and spooned
them onto our plates. Though we
split the order of carhonara, we
found that it, in addition to our
previous courses was supplying
us with plenty of nourishment.
But, as we later discovered, the
best part was yet to come.
Our entrees would have made
the galloping gourmet proud. My
roast lamb and my friend's
abalone were superb. The lamb
was tender and juicy and it really
tasted special. The abalone,
cooked in a sweet batter, was as
tender as any I've ever tasted.
We both marvelled at the taste
and tenderness of this usually
tough and chewy exotica. We

both thoroughly enjoyed o
meals which were, incidently,
tastefully and tastily garnished
with broccoli and boiled, but
tered potato halves.
Though hardly in the mood for
more food, we felt it was our duty
to sample a dessert or two. My
friend responsibly ordered
cheesecake while I opted for the
lighter caramel custard. Both
these dishes were delicious, and
along with coffee and expresso,
served as excellent finishing
touches on an all-around excel
lent dinner. If only to act as a
basis of comparison, the biggest
thing we could find wrong with
our supper was that the espresso
was slightly too strong. I'm sure
there are those who prefer it that
way.
We tried to sample as many of
the gourmet delights of The New
San Remo as we could. Of course
we could only begin. A wealth of

alimentary satisfaction aw
Stanford gourmets and you u t
have to go into debt to get some.
A full, and I mean full, meal with
wine can be had for two for about
$60. And if you go with the
Chefs Special Dinner, you can
leave the New San Remo having
spent about half that for two,
with wine.
While it's a long way from
Stanford, you should make a trip
to The New San Remo. You
might even see Clint Eastwood
there. But don't go for that. Go
because you want to eat a fine
supper in one of the best Italian
houses in San Francisco. Your
friend will love you for it.

daily. Dinner 5 to 1 1 p.m., ex
cept Sun. from 2 p.m.; luncheon
