To those who have ven
tured beyond the confines of
Campus Drive to splurge on
an occasional meal out, it is
no secret that Palo Alto offers
a perplexingly vast assort
ment of international foods.
Everything from Chinese
wokery to French cuisine, and
Indian entrees to the ever
present pizza can be found in
the seemingly infinite number
of restaurants which compete
for student approval. Yet,
more often than not, those
looking for a palatable plea
sure to revive th.eir taste buds
leave the restaurant with the
disturbing feeling of discon
tent that comes from eating
another extremely mediocre
meal.
However, in my most re
cent outing in search of fine
foods, I encountered a re

staurant that still believes in
the old-fashioned ideal of
pleasing its customers with
the highest quality of food
and service. Set along the wa
ter's edge in Foster City, La
Bella Pasta combines excel
lent European-American
cookery with a softly elegant
atmosphere. It provides a
very satisfying dinner experi
ence for those desiring some
thing a little extra speciaj.
The restaurant's title is
somewhat misleading in that
pasta dishes constitute only a
portion of the items on the
menu, which also lists sea
food. veal, chicken and steak.
Some of the more traditional
Italian dishes served include
lasagna, canneloni. fettucine.
spaghetti with a choice of
sauces,and linguini with fresh
clams. From the sea. l.a Bella
Pasta offers trout, sole, lobs
ter and shrimp served in a
creative] Variety of sauces.
Sauces natwjc from a lobster

casserole topped with creamy
sherry sauce, to scallops
smothered with a mushroom
and wine sauce.
One can order veal either
stuffed, breaded, topped with
melted cheese, or covered
with a wine sauce. Chicken is
served in an assortment of
dishes similar to that of the
veal, or may be simply broiled
under a lemon sauce. For
those who can't bear to part
with a cut of good beef, a New
York steak is also available.
For dessert, the house ot
ters spumoni and regular ice
cream, or its specialty. Italian
cheesecake. All entrees are
served with a loaf ot bread,
the soup of the day and a
salad. Finally, a list of over 50
wines guarantees that even
the most choosy ol connois
seurs will be able to find a
satisfying complement for the
meal.
Formally dressed waiters
speaking with foreign accents

and fine place settings cm
elegant red table cloths, com
bine with the rustic decor of
antique furniture to provide a
refined yet relaxing atmos
phere. Hanging ferns add a
touch of liveliness to the
room, complemented by a
view of the water through the
restaurant's large windows.
The sincere effort on the
part of the management to
please its customers is espe
cially evident in its courteous
and almost flawless service.
The waiters, most of them
middle-aged and of foreign
biith. appear to take pride in
their work, and do all they can
to make the evening an en
joyable one.
A bar and lounge, located
in a separate part of the re
staurant. serves cocktails to
its patrons who may enjoy
nightly entertainment or view
the large screen TV. Each af
ternoon from 4 to 6, La Bella
Pasta holds its "Happy Hour"
when customers may partake

of drinks tor half the regular
price.
With the restaurant under
the new management of
George Kloczl. boasting 20
years experience managing
restaurants in Europe, some
changes are taking place. The
menu will he somewhat ex
panded to include more
French and American dishes,
and a champagne brunch has
just begun on Sundays start
ing at II a.m.
La Bella Pasta serves lunch
and dinner Tuesday through
Sunday .with only the cocktail
lounge open on Mondays.
The prices of most dinner en
trees fall between $6 and SI 0.
with lunch dishes between $4
and $7. Though a somewhat
further drive from the Stan
ford campus, for those who
delight in tine foods served in
a comfortable atmosphere.
La Bella Pasta is worth the
effort.
