La Cabane
1838 Union St.
San Francisco
921-2861
Enjoy some convincing evidence supporting the
opinion that San Francisco is the Paris of the Un
ited States at La Cabane, a very restaurant francais.
How French is the place? Spying the cozy
sidewalk terrace should instantly dispel all doubts
about La Cabane's authenticity. Visions of the
Champs Elysses. As with all French restaurants, a
menu is posted on the terrace, bait to lure those
strolling along the avenue inside. Even the prices are
French, not a casual undertaking. But just pro
nouncing the names of the dishes tastes exquisite;
temptation too great for a mere mortal to resist and
in you go. damn the expense!

The decor of La Cabane is remi
niscent of a small auberge in the
French countryside . . . Yet there
is a definite cosmopolitan twist
to the rustic atmosphere.

Tao Le.the maitre d', greets you the moment you
step inside, and offers you (if the option is availa
ble) your choice of tables, a choice too few restaur
ants leave to the diner. Who can resist an open
terrace table's invitation to respire the cool evening
air. and watch the San Francisco types walking by?
•Only those highly susceptible to the cold, for whom
there is a similarly fine selection of tables in the
interior.
The decor of La Cabane is reminiscent of a small
auberge in the French countryside with its rich
wood panelingand its pane glass window stretching
the width of the entrance. Yet there is a definite
cosmopolitan twist to the rustic atmosphere. The
chairs, tables and place settings have the refine
ment of the City. Hanging ferns add a touch of
California.
: Seated, cocktail in hand, you review the exten
sive menu and wine list, which requires a good deal
faf thought and deliberation for the selection of the
perfect combination of dishes and drink. Finally
.you have chosen, and the conversation flows as you
ciwait the arrival of the first course.
11 To each their own when it comes to choosing

either hors d'oeuvres, salad or soup to begin the
meal. Sticking to convention, I decided to start with
gratinee while my companion ordered mousse de
saumon dugleree. The salmon mousse proved an
exceptional choice by virtue of Chef Paul Dufour's

KtSTAURANT hRAN^'AIS

delightful sauce. Indeed, any sauce dish ordered at
La Cabane will certainly delight the diner. Dufour
being one of the foremost sauciers in the States.
A delicate cheese pastry crust topping my bowl
of French onion soup developed into quite a frus
trating dish: the superb crust ranked the gratinee as
the best 1 had ever eaten, but it also prevented the
soup from cooling down to a palatable tempera
ture. Thus 1 was forced to watch, for a solid 10
minutes, a gratinee that snickered at me, tempting
me to plunge in. devour it and burn my mouth
beyond gustatory functioning.
The most impressive part of the menu, and in
deed of the whole dinner, is the entrees. While we
would have had trouble imagining a main dish finer
than the creations that opened the meal, Dufour
surprised us by outdoing himself in the preparation
of lapin saute aux prunes a I'Angevine and
tripes ala mode de Caen. Rabbit and intestines may
make a number of you queasy, but 1 strongly re
commend these two uniquely French courses
cooked to perfection by a master French chef.
Of course no French restaurant lacks wine. La
Cabane's cellar can boast a selection second best to
none, which offers the most prized vintages of Fr
ance. German). Spain. Portugal and California at
prices ranging from moderate to astronomical. A
particularly good Vouvray is my recommendation
for a superior wine at a moderate price.
A 1 though there w as no cheese platter for dessert,
something noticeably lacking, the other choices of
creme caramel, mousse au chocolat, fraise melba,
and profiterolles help you to overlook this
shortcoming. Coffee and a wide selection of after
dinner drinks top an unforgettable dinner.
Located on the most interesting section of Union
Street. La Cabane is an ideal way to end a day or
start a night in the City. The dress is casual chic,
comfort being the rule of the house. Reservations
are strongly recommended, as is an ample supply of
cash. Prices for two range from $40 to $100 de
pending on what you drink. But don't watch the tab
at La Cabane. This is a place to splurge!
