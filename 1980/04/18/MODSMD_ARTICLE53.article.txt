Several years ago, much
media attention was given to
the South Vietnamese re
fugees as they were arriving in
this country. Most of them
had lost the bulk of their val
uables and were being forced
to start entirely new lives, but
since then we haven't heard
much about how they've been
faring. I've discovered that
one transplanted family has
made the transition quite
well. Au Chambertin. a suc
cessful French restaurant, is
owned and operated by
former Saigon resident
Huynh Lap, along with his
wife, daughters, sons and as
sorted in-laws. This may seem
an unlikely group to be serv
ing French cuisine, but in the
four months that they've been
in business, Au Chambertin
has gained recognition as
being one of the finest re
staurants on the Peninsula.
Such notoriety probably
comes as no great surprise to
the family. They've left a trail
of successful businesses be
hind, beginning with a large
French restaurant in Saigon.
Shortly after arriving in this
country, Huynh Lap joined
forces with his son Tan and
opened a restaurant in San
Francisco named La Cabane.
Through years of experi
ence and association with the
great chefs of France, Lap
had become a consummate
chef, and his restaurant's fare
was highly acclaimed. Several
years later, the family moved
to this area to manage the
much-lauded La Tour re
staurant. With such an abun
dance of experience, there

was little doubt that their new
venture, Au Chambertin,
would also be terrific. It ap
pears that no one has reason
to be disappointed.
The restaurant is located in
a secluded shopping district
featuring quiet, tree-lined
streets. Several other restaur
ants had unsuccessfully at
tempted to operate in this lo
cation, and the interior of Au
Chambertin still reflects some
of the decor of the previous
establishment. The floor plan
is more like that of a private
home than a place of busi
ness. Patrons are seated in
four small dining rooms, and
to assure the highest quality
food and service, the maitre
d". Huynh Tan, will not seat
more than 75 people for any
lunch or dinner.
Two things about the menu
are certain to catch one's at
tention. The first is the vast
selection of dishes offered.
Wi th 40 items to choose from,
planning a meal could be a
challenge. But there's abso
lutely no pressure to hurry,
and our waiter was delighted
to make suggestions. The
second observation is that this
establishment doesn't cater to
the budget dinner. The en
trees are priced from $8.25 to
$14.75, with the appetizers,
soups and salads being simi
larly high priced.
At the time of our visit,
dinners could be ordered only
a la carte, though the restaur
ant has just introduced a new
option. It will now be possible
to order complete dinners in
cluding soup, salad, entree,
dessert, and coffee or tea.
These meals are priced from
$11.95 to $15.95 and will be
served from 5:30 to 7:30 each
evening.
We began our meal by pro

curing a bottle of the house
wine, though if we had been
adventurous we could have
chosen a bottle from the 133
domestic and imported wines
available. Prices on these
start at $7.50, with the more
exotic vintages costing as
much as $98 per bottle.
The hors d'oeuvres list of
fered such enticing sounding
creations as mousse of scal
lops in lobster sauce with as
paragus, and baked oyster
with curry sauce in pastry. We
ended up sampling the av
ocado stuffed with crabmeat
($5.95) and the escargot
($4.95). I expected the av
ocado to be overflowing with
crab, as it was, but I was
pleasantly surprised by the
tangy lemon sauce that was
served with it — very flavor
ful! The half-dozen escargots
were also excellent. The chef
had obviously used the garlic
with restraint, and the effect
was marvelous.
The next course, Soup uux
Truffes Ely see (truffle soup),
was probably the highlight of
the meal. This awesome broth
weighs in at $6.50 per bowl,
but it's worth it. It was origi
nally created by the world
renowned French chef
Roanne, especially for Presi
dent Giscard d'Estaing.
Baked in individual earthen
ware bowls, each serving was
sealed in by a golden-brown
puff pastry that had obviously
been prepared with extreme
care. The soup itself was a
zesty vegetable creation that
had been graced with a
generous helping of truffles.
The rather steep price may
seem a little more forgivable
if you keep in mind the fact
that truffles are currently re
tailing for $400 per pound.
Ourentrees came next,and

I was immediately impressed
with the care that had been
put into arranging the food on
the plates. The vegetables
and garnishes, with their as
sorted colors, were used to
create meals that could hang
in the Louvre.
The entrees we tried in
cluded one that was the spe
cial of the day, veal papillon.
This was an extremely tender
piece of veal that had been
cooked in a light sauce. The
other entree was the Tour
nedos Belle Helene, which is
filet mignon served with an
artichoke heart and truffle
sauce. While the meat was
flavorful enough not to need
the truffle sauce, it was a wel
come addition and made the
filet that much more succu
lent.
After having put away such
a vast quantity of food, we de
cided that sampling the
tempting dessert menu would
have to wait until another
visit. And a second visit is
something I really look for
ward to. The Peninsula has
long been considered by cri
tics to be a gastronomic
wasteland, but Au Chamber
tin is obviously an exception.
Chet Lap and his family offer
all the professionalism you
could want in a fine restaur
ant, complete with proper yet
unpretentious service and
first-rate artistry in the
kitchen. And you don't have
to drive to San Francisco to
get it. Amazing.
Lunch: Monday through Fri
day, 1 1:30 to 2:30
Dinner: Monday through
Saturday. 6 to 10.
Reservations essential, for
mal banquet facilities availa
ble for up to 65 people.
