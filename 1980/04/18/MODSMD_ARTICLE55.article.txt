Chapter Two ★★
Park, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle
aged widower boy (James C'aan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate. there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody self. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.

Intruder in the Dust ★ ★★★
Friday, Kresge
Director Clarence Brown's ver
sion of the William Faulkner novel
is one of the most careful and ba
lanced adaptations of a Faulkner
work ever done on film. Brown was
on a studio contract throughout his
career, and he made a wide variety
of commercially successful movies
— including National Velvet. But
Brown's work here destroys any
notion that he was just another
studio hack — you can't take the
beauty of this movie away from
him.

Apocalypse Sow ★★★★ '
Menlo Cinema, Menlo Park
An extraordinary work of mad
genius. Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella
Heart of Darkness 4 , he employs

Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view. Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stunning
images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity
with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is, I think, the best American movie
of the just-ended decade. It has al
most untenable ambitions, but the
profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming cra/.i
ness of this "impossible," almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind. Star
ring Marlon Brando, Martin
Sheen, Robert Duvall and Frederic
Forrest.

2001: .4 Space Odyssey ★★★★
New Varsity, Palo Alio
Stanley Kubrick's classic film
may somehow seem "primitive" by
current sci-fi movie standards, but
this movie still transcends any
genre labels. Kubrick's domination
of the medium in this overwhelm
ingly visual masterwork is so obvi
ous that you may overlook the im
portance of Arthur C. Clarke's
original idea. Clarke's conception
perfectly fits the grandeur of Kub
rick's style here, and the results are
unforgettable. Starring KeirDullea
and Hal, the computer.

Electric Horseman ifkir
Tivoli Twin, San Carlos
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.

Hie fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Jane Fonda doggedly pursues Red
ford across the Southwest as he
prepares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's, are fine, Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

»/ ★★★★
Saturday, Bishop Aud 8 p.m.
In stark contrast to the wild ex
cesses of Metropolis, this Fritz
Lang movie focuses narrowly on
the world of Peter Lorre, mur
derer. It's Lorre's first starring role,
and his obsessive, emotional per
formance is unforgettable. Lang's
command of style and atmosphere
is so complete that M's nightworld
envelops you and refuses to let you
go.

Arsenic and Old Lace itirif
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
Frank Capra directed this movie

I
version of the oft-performed play;
he doesn't really add anything to it
— you get the feeling that this rep
resented a paycheck for Capra
more than anything else. Gary
Grant makes a fool out of himself
as he feverishly tries to figure out
why people keep getting poisoned
in a house owned by these dear old
ladies.
— R.L.
All That Jazz ★★★
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented lor
that result: trustratinglv. the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious. hut it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact,
112 osse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon. the Fosse character played
In Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strough personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man who's always on. a man of ta
lent w ho finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All Thai Jo::. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-bi/ sell ma 11-
/iness that Fosse stull's the sequ
ence with borders on sell-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own: he must ha\ e realized

10 ★★★
Centali> 21, San Jose
Tlje sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are. for lack

of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid-life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter,
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
humbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek. that is. This poster-star just
may have found her "niche" as the
vacuous "10" the title refers to.
— R.L.
Being There ★★★
Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be
ing, in this comedy directed by Hal
Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife who is desperately seeking for
affection) but the film drags on as
we see more and more people be
taken in by Chance's one quality:
his ability to make people see in
him whatever they want — as
Chance rises by accident and in
spite of himself comes to the brink
of becoming the President of the
U.S.
The film is a cut against corrup
tion in politics, the generation
mesmerised by television and
empty metaphors about the sea
sons..

Rock'ri Roll High School
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial ★ ★★★
American schlock cinema at its
artistic height. Rock 'n' Roll High
School is a must-see film about the
energies of high school revoltuion.
This sleazy little musical brims with
vitality, verve, and the punk-rock
music of the Ramones. R 'n' RHS is
a grade-z version of Crease but far
more exciting.
— Dana Polan

Kramer is. Kramer ifififif
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart.
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate, almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).
tint there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton s invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Mer\l Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat ior its own good.
Streep's exll perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.L.
Breaking Away ★★★
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
Away may he the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town hoy who
seeks to make his escape through
his talent on a bicycle.
—Mike Kohn
Norma Rae+ir+it
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
lights to have a union put in a tex-

tile mill where she works. Sally
Field gives an assured and very
likeable performance as Norma
Rae; her days as "the Flying Nun"
seem tar behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on charac
terization than on action. Ron
Liebman co-stars as a New York
union agitator
— Jim Mattson
Rocky Horror Picture Shot* if if
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
The camp classic of the '70s. To
try to describe this entertaining
mess dealing with transvestism and
various other forms of socially un
acceptable behavior would be as
absurd as trying to explain its cult
appeal. A great way to blow off
Sundav night. Dress appropriately.
— R.L.
Century 21, San Jose
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy. 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front — bodies fly all too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical. frenzied comedic action may
be horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi. and Dan Avkroyd,Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell. quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater
