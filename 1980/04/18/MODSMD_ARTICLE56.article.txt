African state gains independence
SALISBURY. Zimbabwe — This country, wracked by
years of civil war in a failed struggle for white supremacy,
officially became the black-ruled nation of Zimbabwe yes
terday.
The transition brought independence to Britain's last
African colony.
Britain's Prince Charles was on hand to turn over the
British Parliament's declaration granting independence to
the southern African state.
Wild cheers erupted from the stadium as Zimbabwe was
born out of the ashes of a seven-year war between black
nationalists and the country's white minority that cost some
20,000 lives and shattered an otherwise healthy economy.
House bill would restrict searches
WASHINGTON — The House Judiciary Committee
yesterday approved a bill that would bar surprise police
searches against peisons not suspected of a crime.
The bill, a more encompassing version of legislation
proposed by the Carter administration, was introduced last
year in response to a 1978 Supreme Court decision that
upheld the constitutionality of surprise police raids on
newsrooms.
The committee-approved measure would outlaw police
searches of anyone not the target of a criminal investigation,
not just persons employed by news organizations.
In the 1978 case, the Supreme Court held that police
searches of newsrooms did not violate the First Amend
ment guarantee of freedom of the press or the Fourth
Amendment guarantee against unreasonable searches.
That decision stemmed from a police raid on the offices of
The Stanford Daily. The police were looking for photo
graphs of a campus demonstration in which a policeman was
injured.
Carter: Palestinian self-rule closer
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter, assessing
his separate talks with Israeli Prime Minister Menachem
Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, said yesterday
that the problems impeding agreement on Palestinian self
rule are "much less formidable" than those of earlier stages
in the Mideast peace process.
But the optimism Carter expressed at a White House
ceremony and in a nationally televised news conference was
offset bv Begin, who gave a hard-line speech here warning
that Israel is unwilling to make compromises in its negotiat
ing position.
Begin repeated that Israel is willing to allow limited, local
self-government for the 1.2 million Palestinians in the West
Bank and Gaza. But he rejected the idea that any self
governing authority should have the powers of a legislative
assembly or other characteristics that might form the nuc
leus of an independent Palestinian state.
The separate meetings with Sadat and Begin did achieve
agreement for an intensified new round of negotiations
before the May 26 target date for an autonomy accord.
They also produced a potentially significant agreement that
some aspects of the autonomy accord could be bucked over
for resolution by a special committee after a self-governing
authority is established.
U.S. officials are hopeful that these decisions will help
pump new vigor into the negotiations, which have been
stalled for 10 months.
More Cubans flee to Costa Rica
SAN JOSE. Costa Rica — Two planes brought 254 re
fugees here during the second day of an airlift from com
munist Cuba, lifting the total flown to 490. Peruvian offi
cials said 9700 Cubans still were waiting to leave their
homeland.
Many of those who arrived Wednesday said they hope to
be t among the 3500 who will be admitted to the United
States because they have relatives there. They would' Join
about 800.000 Cubans who have emigrated to the United
States since f-idel Castro took power in 1959.
Peru has said 1000 of the refugees may settle there, and
Spain, Ecuador and Belgium have promised to take smaller
numbers.
The invasion of the Peruvian Embassy in Hav ana on
April 4 by Cubans seeking to leave the country has seriously
strained Cuba's relations with both Peru and Venezuela,
which also granted asylum to a number of Cubans.
Anderson nears separate candidacy
WASHINGTON — Rep. John Anderson of Illinois is
prepared to run for president as an independent candidate
and expects to formally announce his intentions next week
in Washington.

Anderson said yesterday he is "strongly leading" toward
running for president as an independent. But the Illinois
Republican insisted he has not yet made a final decision to
drop his challenge for the Republican nomination.
And in another indication of his intentions, Anderson's
supporters in Massachusetts said the candidate had au
thorized them to put his name on petitions as an indepen
dent candidate. Anderson's name is not on the GOP ballot
in Pennsylvania with those of Reagan and Bush.
Anderson, who has retained New York media consultant
David Garth to help plan his strategy, said he would run a
media campaign that would attempt to exploit public disen
chantment over a Carter-Reagan race without being
"wholly negative."
He has no intention of trying to launch a third-party
movement, according to campaign aides, but will run as an
independent Republican, a decision that will hurt him in
raising money.
According to the findings of a new Washington Post poll,
Anderson would draw 17 percent of the vote right now in a
three-way race among himself, Ronald Reagan and Presi
dent Jimmy Carter. He would cut deeper into Carter's
support than into Reagan's. Sixty percent of those who say
they would support Anderson would back Carter in a
Carter-Reagan contest.
With Anderson in the race. Carter currently leads with 42
percent to Reagan's 35 percent. With Anderson not run
ning. Carter leader Reagan by 51 -42, according to the poll.
Moffett plane crashes in Samoa
PAGO. PAGO. American Samoa — Seven people were
killed yesterday when a four-engine Navy plane snagged an
aerial tramway cable and crashed into an historic bayfront
hotel in the capital city of this U.S. territory in the South
Pacific.
The six crewmen aboard the P-3 Orion, which was based
at Moffett Na\al Air Station, were killed along with one
civilian on the ground, according to a Navy spokesman in
Honolulu.

that left one wing of the 250-room Rainmaker hotel in
flames, said Fred Rohlfing, who heads the American Samoa
liaison office in Honolulu.

notification of relatives.

American Samoa's 80th annual Flag Day celebration,
Rohlfing said.
U.S. expels two Libyan diplomats
WASHINGTON — The Carter administration has ex
peled two Libyan diplomats for distributing among Libyan
students in the United States calls for assassination of op
ponents of Libyan Leader Col. Muammar Khadafy, well
informed sources said yesterday.
State Department officials said the two diplomats were
also using coercive methods to control Libyan students in
the United States and that their conduct was "inconsistent
with the accepted role of diplomats."
Mottha Ibrahim, third secretary, and Mohamed Tarhuni,
a cultural attache, were given 48 hours to leave the United
States after being declared persona non grata on April 5.
The call for assassination of political opponents was con
tained in the program declaration adopted by the Libyan
Revolutionary Committees meeting in Benghazi last Feb
ruary. The Libyan Embassy here was said to have circulated
the program among Libyan students in the United States,
whose number is estimated between 3000 and 4000.
The two diplomats are also said to have been involved in
organizing a campaign to prevent expression of opposition
to Khadafy among the students.
Libya supplies l() percent of U.S. oil imports and is the
third most important U.S. source of foreign oil. Libya is
among the few natiorfs to have said publicly it would help
Iran in the event of a U.S. attack.
Carter says recession has begun
WASHINGTON — " Recent economic statistics suggest
our economy has slowed down and probably entered a
period of recession," President Jimmy Carter said at a news
conference yesterday, adding quickly," 1 believe any reces
sion will be mild and short."
He also predicted there will be "a substantial reduction in
the rate of inflation in the next few months."
Carter said the rate of inflation could decline from the
current 1 8 percent annual rate to about 10 percent within a
tew months, if oil prices do not surge again and if the cost of

home mortgages declines bv just 2 percentage points to 14
percent
I he administration is predicting a decline in economic
output ot 0.4 percent this year with unemployment rising to
7.2 percent, up from the current 6.2 percent. However, a
top government official lias said he thinks the downturn will
be more severe, with a decline in the gross national product
ol about 1.5 percent and a rise in joblessness to 8 percent.
The government acted in these areas yesterday:
rhe Federal Reserve Board said it will make between
$1 billion to $3 billion available to banks to lend to small
businesses and farmers at lower interest rates.
— The Department of Housing and Urban Development
announced it will help builders obtain loans on unsold
houses and extend subsidies tor low-income buyers at a cost
of about SI6O million.
Consumer groups rap Big Business
Yesterday was either "Big Business Day" or "Growth
Day" — depending on your point of view.
Labor leaders, senior citizens' groups and consumer ac
tivists led by Ralph Nader attacked alleged abuses in the
marketplace with marches, rallies and mock trials marking
what they called "Big Business Day."
Corporate supporters responded with "Growth Day" ac
tivities in defense of the economic system, which, they said,
"has treely and generously provided so much torso many."
Individual events spread across the country. The focus of
the "Big Business Day" campaign was a bill introduced in
Congress earlier this month to limit the powers of the na
tion's 600 largest corporations.
Local groups, however, used the day to campaign for
their own causes.
Big Business Day rallies, teach-ins and other events were
held in more than 150 cities.
Offering dramatic testimonv by"victims" of business and

tours of a "corporate hall of shame," a Washington coali
tion of consumer and union groups staged a publicity offen
sive against what they called abuses of corporate power.
Andrei Gromyko to visit France
PARIS — In what appears to be the start of a major
Soviet diplomatic drive to exploit the fissures in the Atlantic
alliance, it was here yesterday that Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko will come to France next
week on his first visit to a Western country since the inva
sion of Afghanistan.
The choice of France seemed to be a recognition of what
the Soviet ambassador here Wednesday called Moscow's
"privileged friendship" with Paris.
Soviet official? said that Gromyko would follow up the
Paris trip within two weeks with a visit to West Germany
and that other visits are being discussed with Spain. Bel
gium and others, possibly including the Netherlands.
Gromyko's Western travel plans seem to indicate that the
Soviets feel that it is possible to make headway in an at
tempt to turn the tables on Washington's efforts to portray
Moscow as a menace to East-West detente.
