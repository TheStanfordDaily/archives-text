# Students complain of LOTS account abuse
## 
### Sara Whittier Staff Writer 
Is it possible to cheat a computer
and get away with it? Some students
here have been trying — and appa
rently succeeding — despite efforts
by the Computer Science Depart
ment to thwart them.
According to Dennis Brown, as
sociate dean of the Comp Sci
Department, a group of stu
dents registered a complaint at the
end of last quarter that fellow stu
dents were opening multiple LOTS
accounts, thus monopolizing com
puter time. This is directly against
LOTS and the Comp Sci Depart
ment policy which, said Brown,
"has always been that students have
one account each."
The problem of multiple accounts
surfaced at the end of last quarter
when long lines at LOTS terminals
during Dead Week caused some
students to question the causes of
such overcrowding.
Violations?
One student said he observed
several people using five or six ac
counts and many others who, seeing
this happening, took the opportun
ity to use their friends' names to
open one or two more accounts for
themselves.
By subjecting LOTS to an ex
tremely high load, the wait for con
soles is lengthened and the speed
with which the computer produces
results is slowed. Thus, according to
one student, who asked not to be
named, people using multiple ac
counts were "taking my eight-hour
allotment and making it shorter by
using up time." He interpreted this
as a violation of the Honor Code.
Students who open LOTS ac
counts must sign an agreement stat
ing that the account is "solely for my

personal use and may not be used by
anyone else."
Abuses
The computer time is allocated at
a rate of two console-hours per
week for each unit of credit given
for a course requiring computer use.
Individuals wishing to open an ac
count are eligible for two hours per
week provided they are University
students not using the computers for
government-funded projects or
commercial purposes.
According to Brown, he was not
aware that people were abusing the
system until complaints were made
last quarter. "I assumed that people
were following LOTS rules," he
said.
Due to complaints last quarter,
LOTS personnel and comp sci TAs
have been alerted to the problem.
Brown added that he is issuing an
additional memo on the subject in
the near future.
Not enough
The anonymous comp sci student,
however, said this action is insuffi
cient. His complaints at the end of
last quarter led to a ban on new
LOTS accounts from Thursday of
Dead Week until the end of Finals
Week in an attempt to prevent
further abuse and overuse of com
puter time.
"At the crisis point we were nbt
interested in hatching anyone, but in
stopping the problem," Brown
explained. "The first move,was to
make it quit happening "by prevent
ing students from opening accounts.
He said that LOTS plans to stop
opening accounts again sometime
near the end of this quarter, al
though the date has not yet been
specified.
Although past offenders will not
be prosecuted. Brown added that
future abusers of LOTS computer
time"will be prosecuted in the same
way as any other Honor Code viola
tion." He also noted that "people
have been doing this without know
ing it was a violation."
With respect to the Honor Code
Brown commented that "it works as
well as people would like to make it
work. There is nothing more we can
do. It is not the instructors' business
to post guards around the termi
nal."
Lyons
But Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons said that he did not
view use of multiple accounts at
LOTS as an Honor Code violation.
"Whatyouare talkingabout issteal
ing," he said.
According to Lyons, that type of
offense relates to the fundamental
standard and would generally not be
handled through the Student
Judiciary Council. He suggested
deny ing student offenders access to
computers as a possible response to
the problem.
The anonymous comp sci student

claimed that the comp sci Depart
ment has not taken enough action to
reduce the temptation or the possi
bility of cheating by monopolizing
computer time. He cited overcrowd
ing of LOTS facilities because of as
signments in several classes being
due simultaneously as a cause of
overcrowding that warrents re
medy. He also suggested more
monitoring on the opening of ac
counts as a possible solution.
Dissatisfied with the response of
the Comp Sci Department, this stu
dent stated: 'Unless you come in
with an ironclad case they will ig
nore violations."
On March 31 the Comp Sci De
partment issued a statement saying
that computer activities counted as
violations. It specifies: "Allowing
another student to use your account
may give that student an unfair ad
vantage over his/her classmates.
Similarly, you may not use someone
else's account . . . Violation may be
an Honor Code offense."
University Ombudsman John
Goheen stated that "this is a big step
forward. If people really follow the
regulations it will work."
