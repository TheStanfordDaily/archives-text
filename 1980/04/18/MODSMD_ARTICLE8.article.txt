## USSR expects American influx Soviet propaganda surges 
### Dan Fisher The Los Angeles Times 
MOSCOW — A West German
tourist struck up an acquaintance
with Valery. a young Lvo\ en
gineer. during a trip to the So\ iet
Union a while hack and. later,
the two corresponded.
After a few innocent letters,
however, the "tourist" revealed
himself to be a member of an
anti-Soviet emigre organization
and enlisted the young en
gineer's help in distributing sub
versive literature. Valery "came
to his senses" just in time and
turned everything o\ er to the au
thorities.
A foreign engineer ostensibly
here to install Western equip
ment in a Soviet factory started
asking two young local acquain
tances about their military ser
vice and otherwise "behaving
suspiciously." When the
foreigner suggested visiting a
"high-security defense installa
tion," the two reported him and
the man was unmasked as a spy.
Cloak-and-dagger media
Those are only two of the
many cloak-and-dagger stories
that Soviet citizens have been
reading in their official press in
recent weeks in what some see as
part of an unprecedented official
campaign to whip up fear and
distrust of foreigners here.
There is no way of knowing
whether they are true in whole,
in part or at all.
Western governments
routinely refuse any comment
here on spying charges raised b\
Soviets. and none of the alleged
culprits is sufficiently identified
for checking. But the stories con
tinue.
Official
Official paranoia is not new in
the Soviet Union. A stcadv
stream of Soviet propaganda
continually warns the populace
that the country is surrounded
by enemies — ideological and
otherwise.
Still, the current campaign is
notable if only because of its un
usual harshness and breadth.
Some Western diplomats here
speculate that the flood of spy
stories may be in part a retalia
tion for the recent expulsion of
Soviet diplomats from New. Zea
land. France, Canada and other
countries on espionage charges
and for U.S. revelations about
Soviet Skulduegerv in America.

More likely, others say, it is
related to the unprecedented in
flux of foreigners expected here
this summer for the Moscow
Olympic Games and official
fears of possible ideological
"contamination" if Soviet citi
zens mix too freely with those
visitors.
In addition to the spy stories in
the official press, Olympic and
other Soviet officials have been
warning frequently about the
need for "ideological vigilance"
during the Games.
Airport customs officials have
already begun searching visitors
much more thoroughly than
normal, according to Western
embassies here, and are confis
cating books, magazines and
other items.
Soviet students screened
Soviet students who are to
serve as interpreters during the
Games are being screened for
political reliability as well as
their linguistic talent, and repor
tedly only those who are mem
bers of the Young Communist
League will be allowed to mix
with the foreigners.
For Soviet children too young
to understand the threat of
ideological contamination from
contact with foreigners, some
Moscow schoolteachers have re
sorted to more primitive scare
tactics. Diplomatic and Soviet
sources alike say children have
been warned that foreigners will
be handing out poisoned candy
and chewing gum during the
Games. Whether the teachers
are acting on instructions from
above or personal patriotism is
unknown.
The xenophobic Kremlin
campaign appears to stand in
sharp contrast to Olv mpic ideals,
which hold that the Games
should promote international
understanding and goodwill.
Soviet officials have boasted that
the 19.50 Games mark a "qual
itatively new stage in the Olym
pic movement." Selection of
Moscow as the host city, they
have said, confirms that "the
principles of the foreign and
domestic policies of our Com
munity Party and Soviet gov
ernment" are in full harmonv
with the "noble ideals" of the
Games.
Visitors cause worn
Vet. the prospect of "an esti
mated 300,000 foreign visitors in

the space ot a few weeks this
summer is obviously worrisome
to Kremlin conservatives.
"Ideological subversion is one
of the main forms of the subver
sive activity of imperialism
against socialism." a top KGB
official wrote in a recent issue of
Kommunist magazine.
Subversives travel to the
Soviet Union in the guise of
foreign businessmen, students,
cultural or scientific exchanges,
tourists and journalists. Semyon
Isvigun, first deputy KGB chief,
said. He also identified Jewish
emigres and dissidents as among
Soviet citizens who cooperate
with Western intelligence agen
cies.
"Centers of ideological sub
version will be especially active
during the Olympics in efforts to
discredit this worldwide sports
celebration and the Soviet Union
as its organizer." he warned.

The xenophobic Kremlin
campaign appears to stand in
sharp contrast to Olv mpic ideals,

should promote international

Soviet officials have boasted that
the 19.50 Games mark a "qual
itatively new stage in the Olym

"Ideological subversion is one
of the main forms of the subver

against socialism." a top KGB
official wrote in a recent issue of
Kommunist magazine.
Subversives travel to the
Soviet Union in the guise of
foreign businessmen, students,
cultural or scientific exchanges,
tourists and journalists. Semyon
Isvigun, first deputy KGB chief,
said. He also identified Jewish
emigres and dissidents as among
Soviet citizens who cooperate
with Western intelligence agen

"Centers of ideological sub

during the Olympics in efforts to
discredit this worldwide sports
celebration and the Soviet Union
as its organizer." he warned.
MOSCOW — A West German
tourist struck up an acquaintance
with Valery. a young Lvo\ en
gineer. during a trip to the So\ iet
Union a while hack and. later,
the two corresponded.
After a few innocent letters,
however, the "tourist" revealed
himself to be a member of an
anti-Soviet emigre organization
and enlisted the young en
gineer's help in distributing sub
versive literature. Valery "came
to his senses" just in time and
turned everything o\ er to the au
thorities.
A foreign engineer ostensibly
here to install Western equip
ment in a Soviet factory started
asking two young local acquain
tances about their military ser
vice and otherwise "behaving
suspiciously." When the
foreigner suggested visiting a
"high-security defense installa
tion," the two reported him and
the man was unmasked as a spy.
Cloak-and-dagger media
Those are only two of the
many cloak-and-dagger stories
that Soviet citizens have been
reading in their official press in
recent weeks in what some see as
part of an unprecedented official
campaign to whip up fear and
distrust of foreigners here.
There is no way of knowing
whether they are true in whole,
in part or at all.
Western governments
routinely refuse any comment
here on spying charges raised b\
Soviets. and none of the alleged
culprits is sufficiently identified
for checking. But the stories con
tinue.
Official
Official paranoia is not new in
the Soviet Union. A stcadv
stream of Soviet propaganda
continually warns the populace
that the country is surrounded
by enemies — ideological and
otherwise.
Still, the current campaign is
notable if only because of its un
usual harshness and breadth.
Some Western diplomats here
speculate that the flood of spy
stories may be in part a retalia
tion for the recent expulsion of
Soviet diplomats from New. Zea
land. France, Canada and other
countries on espionage charges
and for U.S. revelations about
Soviet Skulduegerv in America.

More likely, others say, it is
related to the unprecedented in
flux of foreigners expected here
this summer for the Moscow
Olympic Games and official
fears of possible ideological
"contamination" if Soviet citi
zens mix too freely with those
visitors.
In addition to the spy stories in
the official press, Olympic and
other Soviet officials have been
warning frequently about the
need for "ideological vigilance"
during the Games.
Airport customs officials have
already begun searching visitors
much more thoroughly than
normal, according to Western
embassies here, and are confis
cating books, magazines and
other items.
Soviet students screened
Soviet students who are to
serve as interpreters during the
Games are being screened for
political reliability as well as
their linguistic talent, and repor
tedly only those who are mem
bers of the Young Communist
League will be allowed to mix
with the foreigners.
For Soviet children too young
to understand the threat of
ideological contamination from
contact with foreigners, some
Moscow schoolteachers have re
sorted to more primitive scare
tactics. Diplomatic and Soviet
sources alike say children have
been warned that foreigners will
be handing out poisoned candy
and chewing gum during the
Games. Whether the teachers
are acting on instructions from
above or personal patriotism is
unknown.
