A panel of experts addressing "Alterna
tive Development Strategies for Africa in the
"80s" Thursday night emphasized the need
for an increased standard of living over a
mere rise in GNP.
About 150 persons attended the sym
posium held in the CERAS building, which
debated in essence the merits of building na
tional capitalism vs. socialism in Africa.
According to Abdul-Rahman Babu.
former minister of De\ elopment Planning in
Tanzania, growth in exports from Africa con
tinues to hamper growth in underdeveloped
countries. "The flow of aid (into Africa) is
outstripped by the outflow of wealth." he
said.
Consulting firms and the World Bank,
however, recommend the expansion of ex
ports and foreign investment, he said.
Babu advocated a policy of African self
reliance for the 1980s. He called production
"the principle link in development."
Exports and credit do not provide a solu
tion to Africa's problems, he added because
these only lead to a "vicious cycle of inde
btedness."
"Why is it that all African countries con
tinue to support the same policies despite
errors that are so obvious?" Babu asked.
In the final analysis, the most importani
(alternative strategy) is plan and propor

tional development, he said.
Planning must involve strict discipline and
frugality, something that has been ignored in
the past. Babu said.
Rural, urban and industrial sectors of the
economy must be kept in preparation, he
said.
"In industry, the link is steel." Babu said.
He also cited the "need to protect infant
industries."
According to St. Claire Drake, emeritus
professor in sociology here. "Africa prop
oses and the U.S. disposes."
The U.S. must listen to Africa rather than
dictate what Africa "ought to do." he said.
Drake claimed that in the 1960s U.S. fi
nancial clout could have overthrown any Af
rican government.
Prior to 1951. he said, the U.S. had held no
African policy. However, the Cold War in
troduced the "use of armed force for the
spreading of democracy ," Drake said.
With the advent of the Cold War, "anti
imperialist acts were thought to play into the
hands of the communists," he said. So
America began to "give money away and
also use military power."
Drake said that 1961 represented a turn
ing point in which legitimacy was given to
armed struggle.
Prefacing his remarks by saying that "as a
professor emeritus. 1 don't have to be re
sponsible." Drake predicted the future of

Africa.
The final phase in Africa, he said, will in
clude the escalation of violence; the escala
tion of class conflict; a non-export-oriented
economic order; the adherence of some
states to eastern ideologies and a closer
economic and political alliance with the
Caribbean.
Drake said an intra-race struggle would
follow the struggle with the whites.
He foresaw American moves to gain and
maintain control in East Africa to keep oil
and prevent Russian expansion.
The most useful U.S. policy toward Africa,
he said, "would be a repudiation of the Mar
shall Plan." He called this unrealistic, how
ever.
He said lie hoped Africa could "break its
ties with the multinationals."
According to moderator Donald Harris,
economics professor here, raising the stan
dard of living of the rural sector is the funda
mental element of development strategies.
Transformation programs must "mobilize
the agrarian sector," he said.
Aguibo Yansane, associate professor of
Afro-American Studies at UC-Berkeley,
said the United States has erroneously as
sumed that expansion of trade causes
economic growth.
He emphasized the need to "create a peas
ant power" and "an alliance between worker
and peasant."

frugality, something that has been ignored in
the past. Babu said.
Rural, urban and industrial sectors of the
economy must be kept in preparation, he
said.
"In industry, the link is steel." Babu said.
He also cited the "need to protect infant
industries."
According to St. Claire Drake, emeritus
professor in sociology here. "Africa prop
oses and the U.S. disposes."
The U.S. must listen to Africa rather than
dictate what Africa "ought to do." he said.
Drake claimed that in the 1960s U.S. fi
nancial clout could have overthrown any Af
rican government.
Prior to 1951. he said, the U.S. had held no
African policy. However, the Cold War in
troduced the "use of armed force for the
spreading of democracy ," Drake said.
With the advent of the Cold War, "anti
imperialist acts were thought to play into the
hands of the communists," he said. So
America began to "give money away and
also use military power."
Drake said that 1961 represented a turn
ing point in which legitimacy was given to
armed struggle.
Prefacing his remarks by saying that "as a
professor emeritus. 1 don't have to be re
sponsible." Drake predicted the future of

Africa.
The final phase in Africa, he said, will in
clude the escalation of violence; the escala
tion of class conflict; a non-export-oriented
economic order; the adherence of some
states to eastern ideologies and a closer
economic and political alliance with the
Caribbean.
Drake said an intra-race struggle would
follow the struggle with the whites.
He foresaw American moves to gain and
maintain control in East Africa to keep oil
and prevent Russian expansion.
The most useful U.S. policy toward Africa,
he said, "would be a repudiation of the Mar
shall Plan." He called this unrealistic, how
ever.
He said lie hoped Africa could "break its
ties with the multinationals."
According to moderator Donald Harris,
economics professor here, raising the stan
dard of living of the rural sector is the funda
mental element of development strategies.
Transformation programs must "mobilize
the agrarian sector," he said.
Aguibo Yansane, associate professor of
Afro-American Studies at UC-Berkeley,
said the United States has erroneously as
sumed that expansion of trade causes
economic growth.
He emphasized the need to "create a peas
ant power" and "an alliance between worker
and peasant."
