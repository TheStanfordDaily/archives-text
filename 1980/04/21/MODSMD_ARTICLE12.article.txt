# France seeks closer ties with Arab world

PARIS — Ever since former President
Charles DeGaulle abruptly turned his
hack on Israel at the start of the Six-Day
War in 1967, France has avidly sought a
special relationship with the Arab world.
The latest example of this policy was
Valery Giscard d'Estaing's 10-day tour of
the Persian Gulf states, Jordan and Saudi
Arabia last month, during which he de
clared France's strong support for the es
tablishment of a Palestinian homeland.
The French president also endorsed a
policy of non-alignment for the area, urg
ing Arab leaders to keep the Persian Gulf
free of superpower involvement — no
great help to the United States, which is
trying to line up military facilities in the
region.
France's pursuit of a special relation
ship with the Arab world springs from
several causes, including the historic-
French determination to be seen as an
independent power. In the Middle East,
France has tried continually to set itsell
apart from the pro-Israeli stance of the
United States, both to satisfy itself and the
Arabs.
"If France were to align itself with some
other countries' policy, then French
policies would be simple, but it would
cease to exist as such," Giscard d'Estaing
said in a recent television discussion with

French journalists.
"Seen from the outside. France would
become the province of a superpower.
This isn't the lesson we learned from our
history and it's not what the people of
France want. They want us to be loyal to
our alliances, as indeed we are, and at the
same time pursue an independent policy
that respects our solidarities."
Then in an agile display of French logic,
the president went on to say: " France is a
member of an alliance, but while belong
ing to that alliance it is not aligned."
In the months before the French presi
dential election, expected to take place
about a year from now, Giscard d'Estaing
will be pursuing this Gaullist foreign pol
icy line to the hilt — not only in regard to
the Middle East, Afghanistan and Iran,
but also with Africa. NATO and even
with France's Common Market partners.
Economic self-interest
Beyond the Gaullist ideology however,
French policy in the Middle East is one of
hard economic self-interest, in which
support of the Arab cause is calculated to
further French trading goals. There is no
thing unusual about a country adopting
political policies to further its economic
ends. The French are simply a bit haughty
in the way they go about it.
But French needs are overwhelming.
More than any other country in Europe.
France depends on imported sources of

energy — of which 56 percent is imported
oil. In 1979, France ran up a trade deficit
of approximately $9.5 billion with the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, most of it with the Arab oil
nations of the Middle East. It is not sur
prising. therefore, that France is ready
and anxious to sell arms, nuclear reactors
— anything the Arab world will buy — to
help pay its oil bill.
There has been little of a "grand de
sign" strategy to French policy in the
Middle East in the last 15 years. It has
largely been a series of tactical moves of
fering the Arabs sympathy and trade
while the Americans were backing Israel.
Little influence
To date, however, France has exerted
little influence on the course of events in
the Middle East. But things could be
changing. Giscard d'Estaing is trying to
arrange a conference of the countries of
Europe, Africa and the Middle East —
excluding the United States and the
Soviet Union. He has been discussing the
idea for almost a year now.
His next move will probably come
when he plays host to a summit confer
ence of French-speaking African states in
Nice next month. If, as expected, he gets
the gathering to back his idea of a Euro-
African-Arab conference — in which Fr
ance will try to take the lead — Giscard
d'Estaing will no doubt make it a theme of

his reelection campaign in 1981.
French diplomacy in the Middle East is
inactive, awaiting the outcome of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's round of dealings
with Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin
on which the ultimate fate of the Camp
David Agreements depends.
"When you analyze closely what Gis
card actually said and did on his last Mid
dle East trip and compare it to France's
basic diplomatic positions and attitudes
on the Middle East peace process, you
find that he pulled off a rather skillful
political propaganda act without changing
anything basically," said a high-ranking
Paris diplomat.
"He got a lot of publicity and credit for
saying things about the Palestinians and
the Palestine problem while he was out
there, and he managed to make France
look like the leader of the cause. But in
fact he was only saying in a more dramatic
and exposed way what the Germans, the
Austrians, the Irish and many others have
said publicly or in private.
"Then when it came to takinga position
in the United Nations on the Palestine
resolution (to guarantee a Palestinian
state) which followed his trip to the Mid
dle East, the French lined up solidly to get
the resolution shelved until after the
Camp David process either succeeds or
fails," he said.
