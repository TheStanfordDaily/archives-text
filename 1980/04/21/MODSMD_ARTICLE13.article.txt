PEKING â€” Negotiations are
underway here on a Sino-
American aviation agreement
that will clear the way for the first
direct air service between the
United States and China in more
than three decades.
The air accord, one of the last
steps remaining in the normali
zation process that began when
President Jimmy Carter recog
nized the communist regime
here 16 months ago, will spell
out how many airlines will oper
ate between the two countries,
the routes they will fly and the
fare schedule.
B. Boyd Hight, leader of a
10-man American delegation
that represents the government
as well as the airline industry,
said that the two countries have
exchanged draft agreements.
The two sides are familiar with
each other's position, but
"whether we will be able to reach
a final agreement this time
around is very much up in the
air," said Hight, deputy assistant
secretary of state for transporta
tion and telecommunications.
"It is not unusual for an air ag
reement to require several
rounds of negotiations."
More than a dozen American
airlines have already petitioned
the Civil Aeronautics Board for
routes to China, but the absence
of a bilateral air agreement has
held up the opening of regularly
scheduled flights. Americans
must now fly to China via Hong
Kong, Japan or Europe.
Talks delayed
The aviation talks, originally
scheduled for last fall, were de
layed by the U.S. insistence that
several American carriers must
be allowed on the China routes.
The Chinese made it clear that
they preferred to deal with a
single airline. But they have re
lented in recent weeks, agreeing
that at least two American car

riers will be granted flying rights,
Hight said.
Other differences remain,
Hight said. The Americans
would prefer a pact that leaves
enough flexibility over flight fre
quency and fares to allow some
competition among the Ameri
can airlines. The Chinese, on the
other hand, want every detail
nailed down.
A nagging problem for the
negotiators is whether there are
enough potential passengers to
make direct air service economi
cally feasible, especially since the
Chinese insist on strict equality
in the number of U.S.-operated
flights and Chinese-operated
ones. If two American airlines
scheduled two flights a week, the
Chinese airline, CAAC, must
also fly four times.
Doubts about the demand sur
faced last fall, when Pan Ameri
can World Airways and CAAC
set up six charter flights to China
from San Francisco over a
three-month period. Eventually,
four of the six flights had to be
canceled because Pan Am could
not sell the seats.
Despite these problems, the
American carriers are anxious to
penetrate the China market,
irom which they have been
excluded since the 1949 com
munist revolution. Pan Am
maintains a permanent represen
tative in Peking. Trans World
Airlines last month dispatched a
top-level delegation, led by C.E.
Meyer, the company president,
to offer marketing, a manage
ment and technical assistance to
CAAC.
The Chinese airline fleet con
sists of aging Soviet jets purch
ased in the early 19605, 10 Boe
ing 7075, and a single 7475P that
arrived last month and went into
service April 1 on the Peking-
Paris and Peking-Tokyo routes.
Two more 747SPs are
scheduled for delivery by sum
mer.
