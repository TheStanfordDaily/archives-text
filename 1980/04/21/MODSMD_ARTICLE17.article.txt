# Cuba is model for Third World

African nations must reject
industrial development to
achieve greater liberation, said
Michael Harris, a political sci
ence doctoral candidate who ad
dressed the weekly forum, Af
rica Table, last Friday at noon at
the Lou Henry Hoover building.
Harris said Af rica must estab
lish developmental strategies
stressing economic and social
equality. The Trinidad-Tobago
native also advocated the
strengthening of ties between
African and Caribbean nations.
Emulating industrial de
velopment, Harris said, has led
to disunity among Africans and
Caribbean nations with large
black populations. He said that
Africans and Caribbeans shared
a "common sense of oppression"
by the European colonists con
trolling their lands at the outset
of the African independence
movement starting after World
War 11. But the unity of Africans
fighting against Europeans van
ished as the single liberation
movement splintered into many
separate movements espousing
differing ideologies.
"There is no way any African
or Third World country is going
to develop its economy based on
the industrial model of the de
veloped nations," Harris said.
Industrial development per
petuates the oppression of Afri
can peoples because they must
depend largely on the developed
nations who seek to keep them
poor. What results, Harris said,
is neocolonialism: incorporating

African nations into the domin
ant global economic and political
framework, but only at a lower
and weaker level of develop
ment.
Harris cited the Cuban revolu
tion of the late 1950s as provid
ing a model of emancipation Af
rican nations should admire.
First he said, the Cuban revolu
tion started within the country
and shunned outside interfer
ence. Second, Cubans broke free
of the American industrial influ
ence and desired to effect
policies based on "fundamental
notions of social and economic
equality."
Where the revolution erred,
Harris said, was in its eventual
reliance on the Soviet Union.
Nevertheless, Harris claimed,
without elaboration, that several
established Cuban policies, such
as those in housing, reflect the
fundamental notions of equity
on which the revolution was orig
inally based.
Harris also emphasized the
symbolic importance of Cuban
emancipation, saying, "The
more Cubas there are, the more
other countries perceive the pos
sibilities of rejecting the old
premises on which the old order
is based."
Africa Table is a weekly forum
sponsored by the Stanford Afri
can Students Association
(SASA). Last week's presenta
tion was also part of 1980 Africa
Week, sponsored by SASA. This
six-day event highlighted the
theme "Alternative Develop
ment Strategies for Africa in the
19X05."
