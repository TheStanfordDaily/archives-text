## Pack a good lunch for' Life After Stanford’ 
### 
1 write this letter to the Stanford community from the
horrible unknown of Post-Stanford Life. And I direct it
to my two favorite groups of people still resting in the
relative warmth and embryonic safety of the Farm: the
rather small percentage of dropouts (uh. "stopouts."
excuse me), and the budding young graduates wisely
resisting the gilded lure of graduate school, at least for
the moment. On the one hand 1 congratulate you for
daring to quit the free and easy life of a student: on the
other hand, 1 have to laugh.
Ah, yes, looming on the horizon for you is The Real
World (also known as The School of Hard Knocks. Easy
Street, and Brown Nose City, depending whether you
were in fuzzy studies, a double"E". or ran for the ASSU
Senate). And all of you just sit there, sweating out the last
few days of "the best times of your life." tr\ing to get a
focus on what the hell it's like to no longer rest easy in
Jane Stanford's bosom, to become one of the millions of
average people working a regular job. to sink into the
quagmire of obscurity, to sit in the reserved section at
Stanford football games. Well. 1 know what it's like. I
write to you from that quagmire.
Let me first give you my credentials. One \ear ago. 1
was a well-known, semi-popular senior enjoying a few of
the best times of my life. I wason.orvery near, the top of
the Stanford heap (analogy intended). Today, I am a
part-time waiter at a sleazy downtown restaurant in a
Big City, very near the bottom of an even bigger heap
(analogy definitely intended). One year ago. I lived in
Zap Home with some ot my closest friends and many
good acquaintances, who. for the most part, were
open-minded, well-read articulate people. I now live

with two truck drivers and a gas station attendant. Cul
ture shock hits hard in the beginning.
And yet. for the first time in my life. 1 feel like I'm
living.
You see. life out here is not graded on a curve. There is
no pass, no credit option out here — everything counts.
There is no Big Brother at the Academic Information
Center to watch over your progress and prod you gently
when you show signs of lagging too far behind the herd.
There are no grades, no teachers, and most dangerous of
all foryou Pavlovianly-trained finals-week salivators. no
tests every quarter.
No longer do you have the luxury (and it is one hell of
a luxury) of having someone setting the goals for you.
setting the standards for you to work toward. From
Commencement on. no one dangles the carrot in front of
your face anymore. They hand you the string along with
your diploma in June.
At Stanford, the game is rigged. Everyone is allotted a
reasonable amount of success, flunking out takes a con
certed effort, and almost everyone is somewhat content,
if not happy. Even getting mediocre grades is a form of
achievement: "Well, getting a C here is like getting an
A- at Berkeley, right?"
Winning always rang a little hollow there, kind of like
being popular at summer camp — when the real school
year started, no one really gave a damn that you were
voted Camp Wannaboofoo's Best Brave.
But there is a bright side. What you have to look
forward to in the vile swill known as day-to-day living, is
life on an absolute scale. When first leaving Stanford, it

feels like you're heading into a vast void, far away from
the place where all of the "action" is. It really is quite the
opposite. And not only is there more "action" out here,
the stakes finally mean something.
The hardest realization you will have to accept, how
ever. is one that you won't even conceive as possible
while still at school. But it will dawn on you slowly while
applying for jobs and trying to get work in your field. Put
quite simply, no one gives a damn what you did at school,
for the simple reason that nothing you did at school was
worth giving a damn about. It's as simple as that.
What you did at Stanford may be important to you (as
all of my time spent there is to me) but no one out here
could really care less. Surprise!
But enough. I feel like I'm trying to describe colors to
a blind man, or sunlight to a pre-nied.
In closing, I go past all limits of presumption and offer
this: don't become a ghost, a lingerer near campus who
attends frat parties and street dances to try and keep the
feeling of security that being a student there gives you.
And no matter how much they beg you, do not take a job
at Bowman or the Old Union for lack of something
better to do. You'll merely be treading water in the Land
of Oz. going nowhere, while the freshmen just keep on
getting younger. End of presumption.
So wherever you end up or decide to go in the Big Bad
World, cheer up. because, yes, there is Life After Stan
ford. Just be sure and pack a good lunch; you're going to
be out here for a while.
