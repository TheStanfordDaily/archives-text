# Zetes pay off most of $13,500 debt to University

### Randy David Staff Writer 
Facing the threat of removal from
campus, Zeta Psi last quarter paid off
$10,000 of a $13,500 debt to the Uni
versity, according to Zete presi
dent Scott Pederson.
In February, Assoc. Dean of Resi
dential Education Norm Robinson told
the Zetes they must pay off their debt
in full by the end of this quarter. "If the
bills are not paid, they won't be living
there," Robinson said.
Justin Roach, Zete house manager,
said the fraternity will have "no prob
lem at all with paying off the (remain
ing) $3500."
The Zetes were threatened with re
moval both because of their financial
situation and excessive damages, ac
cording to Diana Conklin, director of
Row houses and fraternities.
Both of these problems "caused us to

question their viability as a housing op
tion for students," she said. The dam
ages were "more than one expects in a
house."
"We are concerned whether a group
that constantly abuses the building
should continue to have that house,"
Conklin said.
Pederson said damages "probably
did reach a problem. Now, we have cut
back a great deal."
The high cost of damages and under
budgeting by their accounting firm
were the two major reasons for the
Zetes' large debt to the University,
Roach said.
In January, the Zetes terminated a
10-year association with Millard As
sociates in Berkeley, hired to do the
fraternity's bookkeeping. The Zetes
now keep their own books.
"We never had an accurate picture
of our financial situation," Roach said,
adding that it took two weeks to get
checks from the accounting firm.

Conklin said she told the fraternity a
year ago to think about doing their own
books. She s&id she told them that
other fraternities using Millard As
sociates were dropping them.
Sigma Chi Omega is the only frater
nity still using Millard Associates, ac
cording to Conklin. The four or five
others that had been using them all
manage their own finances now.
Sigma Chi treasurer Khalil Jenab
said Sigma Chi has had no problems
with Millard. As the only fraternity that
owns its house, it must deal with tax
forms and other matters that other frats
do not have to be concerned with, he
said.
"It's too much work for one trea
surer," Jenab said. In addition, hiring
an accounting firm gives continuity to
the bookkeeping. "One bad treasurer
isn't going to mess things up," he said.
The University has not recom
mended that Sigma Chi drop Millard
Associates, Jenab said.

Damage costs were high for the
Zetes both because the house absorbed
all damage costs and the University
charges "exorbitant prices" for repair
ing damages. Roach said.
The Zetes are attempting to charge
members of the house for damages that
they incur. Roach said. However, it is
often difficult to locate the individual
responsible for the damage because the
bills for the repairs are received a
month after the incident, he said.
In addition to damages reported by
the house, the fraternity is assessed for
damages found during University in
spections. Roach said $2000 worth of
damages were assessed for the house
over winter quarter break.
The $ 1 0.000 paid by the Zetes to the
University last quarter came from a
number of sources, according to
Roach. The majority of funds, $6500,
came from alumni. In addition, the
fraternity cut back "substantially" on
social activities, he said.

The Zetes' debt began building in
January 1978, according to Conklin.
The biggest problem came this year,
with a debt of over $20,000
ledger sheet, she said. However, she
added that this figure "might not have
reflected what they really owed."
Conklin said she has met frequently
with the Zete house manager since last
year. Last May, she said she was as
sured by the fraternity that the debt
would be paid by the end of last sum
mer.
Since their warning in February,
Conklin said "I've seen a real response
from the house . . . They are trying to
improve."
Although the Zetes have been
cautioned more repeatedly than other
fraternities in the last year, two other
frats have written agreements with the
University to pay off old debts, accord
ing to Conklin. Delta Upsilon and
Beta Theta Pi are both keeping well to
their agreements, she said.

Facing the threat of removal from
campus, Zeta Psi last quarter paid off
$10,000 of a $13,500 debt to the Uni
versity, according to Zete presi
dent Scott Pederson.
In February, Assoc. Dean of Resi
dential Education Norm Robinson told
the Zetes they must pay off their debt
in full by the end of this quarter. "If the
bills are not paid, they won't be living
there," Robinson said.
Justin Roach, Zete house manager,
said the fraternity will have "no prob
lem at all with paying off the (remain
ing) $3500."
The Zetes were threatened with re
moval both because of their financial
situation and excessive damages, ac
cording to Diana Conklin, director of
Row houses and fraternities.
Both of these problems "caused us to

question their viability as a housing op
tion for students," she said. The dam
ages were "more than one expects in a
house."
"We are concerned whether a group
that constantly abuses the building
should continue to have that house,"
Conklin said.
Pederson said damages "probably
did reach a problem. Now, we have cut
back a great deal."
The high cost of damages and under
budgeting by their accounting firm
were the two major reasons for the
Zetes' large debt to the University,
Roach said.
In January, the Zetes terminated a
10-year association with Millard As
sociates in Berkeley, hired to do the
fraternity's bookkeeping. The Zetes
now keep their own books.
"We never had an accurate picture
of our financial situation," Roach said,
adding that it took two weeks to get
checks from the accounting firm.

Conklin said she told the fraternity a
year ago to think about doing their own
books. She s&id she told them that
other fraternities using Millard As
sociates were dropping them.
Sigma Chi Omega is the only frater
nity still using Millard Associates, ac
cording to Conklin. The four or five
others that had been using them all
manage their own finances now.
Sigma Chi treasurer Khalil Jenab
said Sigma Chi has had no problems
with Millard. As the only fraternity that
owns its house, it must deal with tax
forms and other matters that other frats
do not have to be concerned with, he
said.
"It's too much work for one trea
surer," Jenab said. In addition, hiring
an accounting firm gives continuity to
the bookkeeping. "One bad treasurer
isn't going to mess things up," he said.
The University has not recom
mended that Sigma Chi drop Millard
Associates, Jenab said.

Damage costs were high for the
Zetes both because the house absorbed
all damage costs and the University
charges "exorbitant prices" for repair
ing damages. Roach said.
The Zetes are attempting to charge
members of the house for damages that
they incur. Roach said. However, it is
often difficult to locate the individual
responsible for the damage because the
bills for the repairs are received a
month after the incident, he said.
In addition to damages reported by
the house, the fraternity is assessed for
damages found during University in
spections. Roach said $2000 worth of
damages were assessed for the house
over winter quarter break.
The $ 1 0.000 paid by the Zetes to the
University last quarter came from a
number of sources, according to
Roach. The majority of funds, $6500,
came from alumni. In addition, the
fraternity cut back "substantially" on
social activities, he said.

The Zetes' debt began building in
January 1978, according to Conklin.
The biggest problem came this year,
with a debt of over $20,000
ledger sheet, she said. However, she
added that this figure "might not have
reflected what they really owed."
Conklin said she has met frequently
with the Zete house manager since last
year. Last May, she said she was as
sured by the fraternity that the debt
would be paid by the end of last sum
mer.
Since their warning in February,
Conklin said "I've seen a real response
from the house . . . They are trying to
improve."
Although the Zetes have been
cautioned more repeatedly than other
fraternities in the last year, two other
frats have written agreements with the
University to pay off old debts, accord
ing to Conklin. Delta Upsilon and
Beta Theta Pi are both keeping well to
their agreements, she said.
