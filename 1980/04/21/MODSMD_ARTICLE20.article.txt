## Hedge boredom 
### 
The powers that be have fi
nally decided to do something
about the dismal, weed-infested
state of the Oval, and the whole
area has been cleared out in pre
paration for relandscaping. Just
what will be put there we mere
mortals can only guess at, but it is
likely to be something boringly
conventional like a flower gar
den trimmed with palm trees,
quaint green bollards, and (golly
gee!) a fountain.
It would be a shame for a uni
versity which prides itself on its
creativity and ingenuity to settle
for such a mundane arrange
ment, especially when an excit
ing alternative exists; a hedge
maze.
A hedge maze in the Oval
would be perhaps the best of all
possible worlds. It would be aes
thetically pleasing, fun, practical
and inexpensive for the Univer
sity to build and maintain. What?
You disagree? Well, let's take
these points one by one.
If one wall (we won't mention
any names) can be called artistic
and aesthetic, then a maze,
which is after all, a whole bunch
of walls, would surely be even
more aesthetically pleasing.
Furthermore, a small garden or a
picnic area could be located in
the center of the maze and an
artistic design could be worked
into the maze itself.
The recreational features of a
hedge maze are obvious. It could
be walked through in the usual
manner, or run through in a
series of speed trials. For those
with golf carts, the maze would
be the ultimate test of driving
skill, and for aficionados of Fris
bee golf, the maze would be a
real challenge. The maze may
even attract enough Adventure
and Dungeons and Dragons
freaks away from LOTS to sig
nificantly lower the computer's
load.
The maze would also be
enormously practical The Ad
missions Office could run
applicants through it to measure
their intelligence, perseverance
and ability to tolerate the absurd

(a valuable sur\ ival trait at Stan
ford).
During Big Game Week,
humanities majors could re
create the adventures of Theseus
by putting a Minotaur in the
maze and throwing in Cal
Weenies. The Minotaur could be
created by a bio major as part of
a senior honors project.
The Medical School could run
premeds through the maze en
masse and see which ones come
out alive, which ones get lost and
which ones give others wrong di
rections.
The Psychology Department
would undoubtedly benefit the
most since they would be able to
run many of their classic rat-race
experiments on humans for
once. Need I point out that the
Psych Department is very close
to the Oval, and Hoover Tower
would be an ideal vantage point
for the experimenter?
In fact, the maze would be so
valuable to the Psych Depart
ment that they may be able to get
a National Science Foundation
grant to build and maintain it as
an outdoor laboratory. Thus, it
would cost the University nothing.
Furthermore, the talent to de
sign a maze pattern already
exists at Stanford.
Any one of a number of integ
rated circuit (1C) patterns could
be used, or a pattern could be
specially designed by Stanford's
electrical engineers in the IC lab.
It might be best not to let them
do the actual construction how
ever; they may try to grow a solid
layer of hedge first and cut away
the maze pattern in successive
etchings.
The advantages of a hedge
maze are quite clear. In all seri
ousness, a hedge maze should be
considered for the Oval. A hedge
maze would appeal to a wide var
iety of people and would cer
tainly be less boring than a
flower garden. This university
needs a maze; it needs a hedge
against boredom.

be the ultimate test of driving
skill, and for aficionados of Fris
bee golf, the maze would be a
real challenge. The maze may
even attract enough Adventure
and Dungeons and Dragons
freaks away from LOTS to sig
nificantly lower the computer's
load.
The maze would also be
enormously practical The Ad
missions Office could run
applicants through it to measure
their intelligence, perseverance
and ability to tolerate the absurd

(a valuable sur\ ival trait at Stan
ford).
During Big Game Week,
humanities majors could re
create the adventures of Theseus
by putting a Minotaur in the
maze and throwing in Cal
Weenies. The Minotaur could be
created by a bio major as part of
a senior honors project.
The Medical School could run
premeds through the maze en
masse and see which ones come
out alive, which ones get lost and
which ones give others wrong di
rections.
The Psychology Department
would undoubtedly benefit the
most since they would be able to
run many of their classic rat-race
experiments on humans for
once. Need I point out that the
Psych Department is very close
to the Oval, and Hoover Tower
would be an ideal vantage point
for the experimenter?
In fact, the maze would be so
valuable to the Psych Depart
ment that they may be able to get
a National Science Foundation
grant to build and maintain it as
an outdoor laboratory. Thus, it
would cost the University nothing.
Furthermore, the talent to de
sign a maze pattern already
exists at Stanford.
Any one of a number of integ
rated circuit (1C) patterns could
be used, or a pattern could be
specially designed by Stanford's
electrical engineers in the IC lab.
It might be best not to let them
do the actual construction how
ever; they may try to grow a solid
layer of hedge first and cut away
the maze pattern in successive
etchings.
The advantages of a hedge
maze are quite clear. In all seri
ousness, a hedge maze should be
considered for the Oval. A hedge
maze would appeal to a wide var
iety of people and would cer
tainly be less boring than a
flower garden. This university
needs a maze; it needs a hedge
against boredom.
