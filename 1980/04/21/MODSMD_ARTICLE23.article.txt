# Palestinian Week unsettling
## 
### 
Columnists' Sideline: As of
this writing (Wednesday, April
16) Palestinian Awareness
Week is half over and several un
settling facts already have
emerged. In a successful request
for $1000 from Stanford's Dic
kinson Symposium Fund,
Awareness Week organizers
claimed that they had refrained
from overly "dwelling on history
and politics."
Yet within their nearly $4000
budget for speakers and logistics
one highly political item was
mentioned but unexplained:
round-trip airfare between
Washington. D.C. and San Fran
cisco for Hatem Hussaini. The
funding proposal failed to note
that Hussaini is registered with
the U.S. government as a foreign
agent for the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization (PLO). He is a
member of the Palestinian Na
tional Council, the PLO's ruling
body.
In the Dickinson proposal.
Awareness Week organizers had
the nerve to include Hillel as a
potential funding source. Hillei's
objection to being connected
with the event is now especially
understandable in light of Hus
saini's planned visit. In their
April 16 Daily statement Pales
tinian Awareness Week organiz
ers portray these legitimate ob
jections as examples of "anti
democratic" repression.
So far, Palestinian Awareness
Week seems to have had much

less to do with re-examining
stereotypes of Palestinians than
with reinforcing the preconcep
tion that those who have serious
misgivings about Palestinian ac
tivism are intolerant, emotional
and hypersensitive. Yes, Vir
ginia, reasonable men and
women do differ about the true
nature of "Palestinian aware
ess."

Presidential contender John
Anderson's candidacy is full of

surprises; unfortunately not all
of them are pleasant.
In our last column Eric
Miethke had an opportunity to
enumerate some of these sur
prises, showing that Anderson is
not the liberal that he's cracked
up to be. Turnabout is only fair
so today the other half of this
column partnership (Zarrow)
gets a chance to find Anderson
disappointing from a more con
servative viewpoint.
As a Democrat who generally
takes liberal positions on social
issues and more conservative
ones on economics (e.g. I oppose
gas rationing and wage and price
controls) 1 should be a perfect
target for an Anderson candi
dacy. However a closer look has
dissuaded me from signing on.
In his major campaign theme
Anderson asserts that he can
take tough stands on tough is
sues. A recent Rolling Stone in
terview with the candidate shows
that he has things slightly con
fused: he takes tough (and some
times unpopular) stands only on
relatively easy issues. He favors
abortion choice, the Equal
Rights Amendment, marijuana
decriminalization and handgun
control. Fair enough. Anderson
fares well on topics which pre
sent a clear yes-no choice and
provide an opportunity for him
to demonstrate his convictions.
However on issues which are
far less discreet and require
either a comprehensive vision or
a unique approach, Anderson is
empty-handed.
His position on nuclear power
and waste is illustrative. As rank
ing minority member of the Joint
Commission on Atomic Energy,
Anderson had the information

necessary to formulate a com
prehensive position. Yet what
would a President Anderson do
about nuclear waste-disposal?"!
would appoint a panel of five to
advise me. . ." Such an approach
is about as productive as Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's"definitive"
Three Mile Island Commission.
Anderson dodges on
economic planning and tax re
form. He leans toward a "tem
porary national economic com
mission, some kind of institu-

tional mechanism" to set in
vestment goals. In politics, those
that can, do; those that can't
form commissions. Running as a
candidate supposedly capable of
proposing and implementing
solutions, Anderson must do
better than this.
As Miethke noted in our last
column, Anderson is by no means
a liberal. Yet even as a moderate
I am disturbed by several areas in
the congressman's voting record
such as his past support of the
B-l bomber and his attempt to
revoke the right of consumers to
bring class action suits at the
Federal Trade Commission. An
derson's labor record is also
troublesome; most noticeably he
opposed a labor law reform bill
considered moderate even by the
Carter Administration.
Finally I find Anderson's
campaign aura of piety a bit
much. As The New Republic
commented, "he has turned his
courage into a shtick, an empty
routine." At Stanford the con
gressman declared that he con
tinues to run because he can't let
his supporters down. Despite the
fact that these supporters are still
not numerous enough to win a
single primary, he rallies on.
In Rolling Stone Anderson
claims that students support him
because "they don't want to in
herit a country that's going over
the side;" he hints at a brave but
doomed third party effort to pre
vent such an occurrence. Ander
son should learn to take himself
and his candidacy a little less
seriously.

Columnists' Sideline: As of
this writing (Wednesday, April
16) Palestinian Awareness
Week is half over and several un
settling facts already have
emerged. In a successful request
for $1000 from Stanford's Dic
kinson Symposium Fund,
Awareness Week organizers
claimed that they had refrained
from overly "dwelling on history
and politics."
Yet within their nearly $4000
budget for speakers and logistics
one highly political item was
mentioned but unexplained:
round-trip airfare between
Washington. D.C. and San Fran
cisco for Hatem Hussaini. The
funding proposal failed to note
that Hussaini is registered with
the U.S. government as a foreign
agent for the Palestinian Libera
tion Organization (PLO). He is a
member of the Palestinian Na
tional Council, the PLO's ruling
body.
In the Dickinson proposal.
Awareness Week organizers had
the nerve to include Hillel as a
potential funding source. Hillei's
objection to being connected
with the event is now especially
understandable in light of Hus
saini's planned visit. In their
April 16 Daily statement Pales
tinian Awareness Week organiz
ers portray these legitimate ob
jections as examples of "anti
democratic" repression.
So far, Palestinian Awareness
Week seems to have had much

less to do with re-examining
stereotypes of Palestinians than
with reinforcing the preconcep
tion that those who have serious
misgivings about Palestinian ac
tivism are intolerant, emotional
and hypersensitive. Yes, Vir
ginia, reasonable men and
women do differ about the true
nature of "Palestinian aware
ess."

Presidential contender John
Anderson's candidacy is full of

surprises; unfortunately not all
of them are pleasant.
In our last column Eric
Miethke had an opportunity to
enumerate some of these sur
prises, showing that Anderson is
not the liberal that he's cracked
up to be. Turnabout is only fair
so today the other half of this
column partnership (Zarrow)
gets a chance to find Anderson
disappointing from a more con
servative viewpoint.
As a Democrat who generally
takes liberal positions on social
issues and more conservative
ones on economics (e.g. I oppose
gas rationing and wage and price
controls) 1 should be a perfect
target for an Anderson candi
dacy. However a closer look has
dissuaded me from signing on.
In his major campaign theme
Anderson asserts that he can
take tough stands on tough is
sues. A recent Rolling Stone in
terview with the candidate shows
that he has things slightly con
fused: he takes tough (and some
times unpopular) stands only on
relatively easy issues. He favors
abortion choice, the Equal
Rights Amendment, marijuana
decriminalization and handgun
control. Fair enough. Anderson
fares well on topics which pre
sent a clear yes-no choice and
provide an opportunity for him
to demonstrate his convictions.
However on issues which are
far less discreet and require
either a comprehensive vision or
a unique approach, Anderson is
empty-handed.
His position on nuclear power
and waste is illustrative. As rank
ing minority member of the Joint
Commission on Atomic Energy,
Anderson had the information

necessary to formulate a com
prehensive position. Yet what
would a President Anderson do
about nuclear waste-disposal?"!
would appoint a panel of five to
advise me. . ." Such an approach
is about as productive as Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's"definitive"
Three Mile Island Commission.
Anderson dodges on
economic planning and tax re
form. He leans toward a "tem
porary national economic com
mission, some kind of institu-

tional mechanism" to set in
vestment goals. In politics, those
that can, do; those that can't
form commissions. Running as a
candidate supposedly capable of
proposing and implementing
solutions, Anderson must do
better than this.
As Miethke noted in our last
column, Anderson is by no means
a liberal. Yet even as a moderate
I am disturbed by several areas in
the congressman's voting record
such as his past support of the
B-l bomber and his attempt to
revoke the right of consumers to
bring class action suits at the
Federal Trade Commission. An
derson's labor record is also
troublesome; most noticeably he
opposed a labor law reform bill
considered moderate even by the
Carter Administration.
Finally I find Anderson's
campaign aura of piety a bit
much. As The New Republic
commented, "he has turned his
courage into a shtick, an empty
routine." At Stanford the con
gressman declared that he con
tinues to run because he can't let
his supporters down. Despite the
fact that these supporters are still
not numerous enough to win a
single primary, he rallies on.
