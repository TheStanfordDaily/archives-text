## Libertarian ethic rational 
### 
John Mason's column (Daily. April 16) which
attacked Libertarians for being "totally callous and
willfully ignorant" shows most clearly his own ig
norance of the rational thought which supports
Libertarian positions. Let us examine his critique
and judge the validity of his conclusions.
1) Mason's first point is that "Libertarians op
pose confiscatory taxes. . . It follows that without a
source of revenue, there would be no govern
ment." This. Mason said, would lead to privately
supported police protection, courts and research
which he implied could not lead to justice and
objectivity.
Libertarians do not oppose fees charged for a
service which is voluntarily utilized. Thus, govern
ment can exist and function without confiscatory
taxes, if it provides services which people choose to
use. Since government spending is done by people
and private support is spending done by people,
why did Mason imply that government, with con
fiscated tax money, is more objective and just than
private support? The difference is merely that con
fiscated tax money is stolen (stealing is taking by
force).
2) Mason's second point is that "The Libertarian
Party 'advocated the establishment of a purely free
market, that is, a market unhampered by govern
ment intrusions'." This is true. However, his ex
position of turn of the century economic history is
false. For a more accurate picture of this era I
would recommend Gabriel Kolko's The Triumph
of Conservatism and Railroads and Regulation.
The American government at the turn of the
century was not following a policy of laissez-faire,
for example see the land grants and subsidies to the
railroads. Also, the anti-trust laws which Mason
claims have fostered "competitive markets" were
actually supported and sponsored by big
businessmen because they were overextended and
faced declining profits due to the competition of
smaller firms. For example, in 1902, 9100 inde
pendent telephone companies were competing
with American Telephone and Telegraph
(AT&T). By 1907, 22,000 were in existence and
most had lower rates than AT&T. Only after the
industry came under the jurisdiction of the Interna
tional Communications Commission (ICC) in
1910 did competition begin to die.
3) Mason writes, "Libertarians oppose the laws
that compel Americans to obtain a certain
minimum level of education. They would also put
an end to free public schools . . The first half of
this statement is true; the second half is a miscon
ception. There is no such thing as a free school;
someone pays for it. Libertarians oppose the theft
which supports public schools at present.
Mason adds that "the effect of the Libertarian
scheme on children of lower incomc families"
would be to "make them less free, less able to
overcome the economic disadvantages they inher

ited." Here he makes two mistakes: first, he pre
sumes that public school helps these children, and
second, he does not know the nature of the
"economic disadvantages they inherited." Forcing
children to attend school does not guarantee edu
cation; as we have discovered, our high schools are
turning out illiterates.
The economic disadvantages which these chil
dren have inherited is government intervention in
favor of the business and labor interests of the
majority. Government regulations, license fees
and taxes all increase the capital needed to start a
business, thus making it more difficult for lower
income people to start a business. Minimum wage
laws don't help lower income teenagers; they just
make it extremely difficult for them to get a job.
4) Finally, Mason points out that "Libertarians
are political 'isolationists'." He worried that "our
non-communist allies . . . would become acutely
vulnerable to the sort of aggression that recently
manifested itself in the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan." Libertarians would not prohibit Mason
or anyone from fighting in Afghanistan, but we do
object to slavery (the draft) and theft (taxes) being
used to support such ventures. The U.S. policy of
intervenion which brought us Vietnam, the Bay of
Pigs, a military junta in Chile and the shah of Iran is
not a defense of freedom but the imposition of U.S.
force.
Mason concludes that "in the stilted Libertarian
view poverty, racism, hunger and ignorance pale
before the atrocities of government regulation."
Actually, as I have tried to point out, all of these
things which Mason deplores are encouraged by
the government regulations which he supports.
Libertarianism is not a " heartless ideology;" it is an
ideology based on rational and consistent princi
ples.

ment." This. Mason said, would lead to privately
supported police protection, courts and research
which he implied could not lead to justice and
objectivity.
Libertarians do not oppose fees charged for a
service which is voluntarily utilized. Thus, govern
ment can exist and function without confiscatory
taxes, if it provides services which people choose to
use. Since government spending is done by people
and private support is spending done by people,
why did Mason imply that government, with con
fiscated tax money, is more objective and just than
private support? The difference is merely that con
fiscated tax money is stolen (stealing is taking by
force).
2) Mason's second point is that "The Libertarian
Party 'advocated the establishment of a purely free
market, that is, a market unhampered by govern
ment intrusions'." This is true. However, his ex
position of turn of the century economic history is
false. For a more accurate picture of this era I
would recommend Gabriel Kolko's The Triumph
of Conservatism and Railroads and Regulation.
The American government at the turn of the
century was not following a policy of laissez-faire,
for example see the land grants and subsidies to the
railroads. Also, the anti-trust laws which Mason
claims have fostered "competitive markets" were
actually supported and sponsored by big
businessmen because they were overextended and
faced declining profits due to the competition of
smaller firms. For example, in 1902, 9100 inde
pendent telephone companies were competing
with American Telephone and Telegraph
(AT&T). By 1907, 22,000 were in existence and
most had lower rates than AT&T. Only after the
industry came under the jurisdiction of the Interna
tional Communications Commission (ICC) in
1910 did competition begin to die.
3) Mason writes, "Libertarians oppose the laws
that compel Americans to obtain a certain
minimum level of education. They would also put
an end to free public schools . . The first half of
this statement is true; the second half is a miscon
ception. There is no such thing as a free school;
someone pays for it. Libertarians oppose the theft
which supports public schools at present.
Mason adds that "the effect of the Libertarian
scheme on children of lower incomc families"
would be to "make them less free, less able to
overcome the economic disadvantages they inher

ited." Here he makes two mistakes: first, he pre
sumes that public school helps these children, and
second, he does not know the nature of the
"economic disadvantages they inherited." Forcing
children to attend school does not guarantee edu
cation; as we have discovered, our high schools are
turning out illiterates.
The economic disadvantages which these chil
dren have inherited is government intervention in
favor of the business and labor interests of the
majority. Government regulations, license fees
and taxes all increase the capital needed to start a
business, thus making it more difficult for lower
income people to start a business. Minimum wage
laws don't help lower income teenagers; they just
make it extremely difficult for them to get a job.
4) Finally, Mason points out that "Libertarians
are political 'isolationists'." He worried that "our
non-communist allies . . . would become acutely
vulnerable to the sort of aggression that recently
manifested itself in the Soviet invasion of Af
ghanistan." Libertarians would not prohibit Mason
or anyone from fighting in Afghanistan, but we do
object to slavery (the draft) and theft (taxes) being
used to support such ventures. The U.S. policy of
intervenion which brought us Vietnam, the Bay of
Pigs, a military junta in Chile and the shah of Iran is
not a defense of freedom but the imposition of U.S.
force.
Mason concludes that "in the stilted Libertarian
view poverty, racism, hunger and ignorance pale
before the atrocities of government regulation."
Actually, as I have tried to point out, all of these
things which Mason deplores are encouraged by
the government regulations which he supports.
Libertarianism is not a " heartless ideology;" it is an
ideology based on rational and consistent princi
ples.

Stanford Faculty Club.)
John Mason's column (Daily. April 16) which
attacked Libertarians for being "totally callous and
willfully ignorant" shows most clearly his own ig
norance of the rational thought which supports
Libertarian positions. Let us examine his critique
and judge the validity of his conclusions.
1) Mason's first point is that "Libertarians op
pose confiscatory taxes. . . It follows that without a
source of revenue, there would be no govern
ment." This. Mason said, would lead to privately
supported police protection, courts and research
