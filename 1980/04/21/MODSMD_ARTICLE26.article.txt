# Rennert wins amid controversy
## Netmen crush No. 5 Trinity, 9-0 
### Ivan Maisel Staff Writer 
After the afternoon po.don of
second-ranked Stanford's 9-0
blanking of fifth-ranked Trinity
Saturday, Peter Rennert, the
Cards' No. 1 player, was faceti
ously complaining about the lack
of attention he was receiving for
his efforts.
"Today I'm not the story;
we've already won the match."
the left-hander said with a smile.
"And when the match is in doubt
and 1 win, it's like everybody ex
pects (the win) with no prob
lem."
Though Rennert spoke with
tongue in cheek, he was also
sadly prophetic, for he received
more attention from an an
nounced crowd of 1579 Maples
Pavilion patrons than he ever
bargained for.
The mark of a good player is
that he wins when he shouldn't:
that he can. through luck or
psych, pull a victory out of the
air. Rennert did just that Satur
day night with a controversial
4-6,7-6 (5-1), 7-5 win over Trin
ity's hard-hitting Tony Giam
malva.
The controversy centered over
two disputed line calls that
turned both the tide of the match
and the wrath of a supposedly
home-team crowd toward Re
nnert.
The second controversial call
was the most important because
it gave the match to Rennert.
Serving at 6-5. 3-2, the Cards'
Long Island native hit a
groundstroke which back lines
man Ken Miller immediately
ruled out.
The crowd tittered at the call
as Giammalva walked back to
receive serve at what would have
been break point for him. Hear
ing the crowd. Rennert ques
tioned umpire Jim Pitts as to the
validity of the call. Pitts over
ruled the call and the match was
suddenly over, much to the hor

ror of Giammalva, the Trinity
bench and many sitting in the
crowd.
What followed resembled a
three-ring circus. Pitts climbed
down from the chair and. before
storming out of Maples Pavilion,
over and over again explained
his right as umpire to overrule to
the exasperated Trinity parti
sans.
Linesman Miller adamantly
sat at his line chair with his arm
out. signalling the hall was long.
Then he got up and circled the
court with his hands outstretched
showing how far he thought the
ball was out.
Giammalva cursed, argued
and then dejectedly gathered his
things and went to the locker
room. Rennert, feeling the
empty joy of a hollow victory,
walked back to the lockers
equally frustrated.
In the hallway, they stopped
and talked. Rennert sympathiz
ing with the loser and expressing
his regrets that such a closely
fought match had to end this
way.
Giammalva was philosophical
in defeat, accepting it with a
quiet air of dignity "Things like
this happen. It's just part of ten
nis. I feel that next time we play I
have a good shot at beating
him "
Indeed he would. The senior
All-America gave Rennert his
toughest match since a 6-2. 6-3
loss to San Jose State's N'ial
Brash six weeks ago. Giammal
va's overpowering serve-and
volley game, combined with sur
prising agility for a man the size
of a basketball forward, kept Re
nnert off-balance for much of the
match.
But the top-ranked amatuer in
the world would not be denied.
The first controversial call of the
night, a Giammalva ace which
Rennert disputed in the second
set's fourth game. lit a fire under
the Stanford star and gave him

the intensity his game had been
lacking up to that point.
Rennert's sudden motivation
was also fueled by the crowd,
which did not like his five
minute losing dispute over the
service ace. They began rooting
against him. except for a fiercely
partisan group of students sitting
in the lower stands.
After the match, readying for
the No. 1 doubles, Rennert ven
ted his frustration with the
"home" crowd.
"Sure it bothers me. I do ev
erything for this school and no
one appreciates it. I skipped a
year in the pros and stayed at
Stanford to help win the NCAA
team championships. 1 argue one
point and everyone turns against
me," he said. "The people were
against me and I don't think jus
tifiably so. We were up 7-0 and
they wanted something to root
for."
The evening's disputes over
shadowed the fact that Stanford
destroyed the nation's fifth
ranked team.
The Cards lost but four sets in
nine matches to virtually destroy
the same team that made the fi
nals of last year's NCAAs.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
was ecstatic. "This team has
been a sleeping giant. We're only
gonna get better." he said with a
smile that could light up a coal
mine. "Everybody else is going
to have to play pretty well to beat
us."
Gould had special praise for
No. 4 Scott Bondurant and
No. 6 Jeff Arons. Bon
durant. a 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 winner
over junior John Benson, "got
blown out in the first set and, as
soon as he saw an opening,
pounced on it."the coach said.
Bondurant cited a change in
rackets and a vocal crowd as the
keys to victorv. "I switched rac

kets in the middle of the first set
because the first one's handle
was too big," the sophomore
said. "The crowd was huge. They
got on Benson's case and lie let
up. I got a cheap break and the
momentum swung m\ way."
A 6-1, 7-fc (5-2) winner over
senior Eddie Reese, Arons "did
a great job." Gould said. "He
played aggressively, his serve
was great, not a blasting serve
but a high percentage one."
Arons was demoted to pI a -
tooning with freshman Jim Gur
fein after a midseason string of
losses. With this, his second con
secutive straight-set victory, he is
feeling more confident.
"The platooning doesn't
bother me," the Gunn High
School product said. "Jim is a
really good competitor. I have a
lot of respect for his game and 1
just want the team to win."
Both senior Lloyd Bourne and
freshman David Siegler pro
nounced their games "back on
the track" after Saturday's con
quests. Bourne whipped fellow
All-America Larry Gottfried
6-4. 6-3, while Siegler played
one of his best matches this sea
son with a 6-3, 6-2 win over
freshman Mark Pinchoff.
The schedule does not let up
for the Cards. They host fourth
ranked Pepperdine tomorrow,
beginning at 1:30 p.m. at the
tennis stadium. The Waves are
headed by All-America Eddie
Edwards, as well as hard-hitting
Rocky Vasquez.

as Giammalva walked back to
receive serve at what would have
been break point for him. Hear
ing the crowd. Rennert ques
tioned umpire Jim Pitts as to the
validity of the call. Pitts over
ruled the call and the match was
suddenly over, much to the hor

ror of Giammalva, the Trinity
bench and many sitting in the
crowd.
What followed resembled a
three-ring circus. Pitts climbed
down from the chair and. before
storming out of Maples Pavilion,
over and over again explained
his right as umpire to overrule to
the exasperated Trinity parti
sans.
Linesman Miller adamantly
sat at his line chair with his arm
out. signalling the hall was long.
Then he got up and circled the
court with his hands outstretched
showing how far he thought the
ball was out.
Giammalva cursed, argued
and then dejectedly gathered his
things and went to the locker
room. Rennert, feeling the
empty joy of a hollow victory,
walked back to the lockers
equally frustrated.
In the hallway, they stopped
and talked. Rennert sympathiz
ing with the loser and expressing
his regrets that such a closely
fought match had to end this
way.
Giammalva was philosophical
in defeat, accepting it with a
quiet air of dignity "Things like
this happen. It's just part of ten
nis. I feel that next time we play I
have a good shot at beating
him "
Indeed he would. The senior
All-America gave Rennert his
toughest match since a 6-2. 6-3
loss to San Jose State's N'ial
Brash six weeks ago. Giammal
va's overpowering serve-and
volley game, combined with sur
prising agility for a man the size
of a basketball forward, kept Re
nnert off-balance for much of the
match.
But the top-ranked amatuer in
the world would not be denied.
The first controversial call of the
night, a Giammalva ace which
Rennert disputed in the second
set's fourth game. lit a fire under
the Stanford star and gave him

the intensity his game had been
lacking up to that point.
Rennert's sudden motivation
was also fueled by the crowd,
which did not like his five
minute losing dispute over the
service ace. They began rooting
against him. except for a fiercely
partisan group of students sitting
in the lower stands.
After the match, readying for
the No. 1 doubles, Rennert ven
ted his frustration with the
"home" crowd.
"Sure it bothers me. I do ev
erything for this school and no
one appreciates it. I skipped a
year in the pros and stayed at
Stanford to help win the NCAA
team championships. 1 argue one
point and everyone turns against
me," he said. "The people were
against me and I don't think jus
tifiably so. We were up 7-0 and
they wanted something to root
for."
The evening's disputes over
shadowed the fact that Stanford
destroyed the nation's fifth
ranked team.
The Cards lost but four sets in
nine matches to virtually destroy
the same team that made the fi
nals of last year's NCAAs.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
was ecstatic. "This team has
been a sleeping giant. We're only
gonna get better." he said with a
smile that could light up a coal
mine. "Everybody else is going
to have to play pretty well to beat
us."
Gould had special praise for
No. 4 Scott Bondurant and
No. 6 Jeff Arons. Bon
durant. a 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 winner
over junior John Benson, "got
blown out in the first set and, as
soon as he saw an opening,
pounced on it."the coach said.
Bondurant cited a change in
rackets and a vocal crowd as the
keys to victorv. "I switched rac

kets in the middle of the first set
because the first one's handle
was too big," the sophomore
said. "The crowd was huge. They
got on Benson's case and lie let
up. I got a cheap break and the
momentum swung m\ way."
A 6-1, 7-fc (5-2) winner over
senior Eddie Reese, Arons "did
a great job." Gould said. "He
played aggressively, his serve
was great, not a blasting serve
but a high percentage one."
Arons was demoted to pI a -
tooning with freshman Jim Gur
fein after a midseason string of
losses. With this, his second con
secutive straight-set victory, he is
feeling more confident.
"The platooning doesn't
bother me," the Gunn High
School product said. "Jim is a
really good competitor. I have a
lot of respect for his game and 1
just want the team to win."
Both senior Lloyd Bourne and
freshman David Siegler pro
nounced their games "back on
the track" after Saturday's con
quests. Bourne whipped fellow
All-America Larry Gottfried
6-4. 6-3, while Siegler played
one of his best matches this sea
son with a 6-3, 6-2 win over
freshman Mark Pinchoff.
The schedule does not let up
for the Cards. They host fourth
ranked Pepperdine tomorrow,
beginning at 1:30 p.m. at the
tennis stadium. The Waves are
headed by All-America Eddie
Edwards, as well as hard-hitting

Stanford's Peter Rennert, who defeated Tony Giammalva of Trinity 4-6, 7-6 (5-1), 7-5, en
route to a convincing 9-0 Cardinal win Saturday, retreated to the "friendly confines" of the
stands and helped himself to a Coors when a disputed call was ruled in his opponent's favor.
After the afternoon po.don of
second-ranked Stanford's 9-0
blanking of fifth-ranked Trinity
Saturday, Peter Rennert, the
Cards' No. 1 player, was faceti
ously complaining about the lack
of attention he was receiving for
his efforts.
"Today I'm not the story;
we've already won the match."
the left-hander said with a smile.
"And when the match is in doubt
and 1 win, it's like everybody ex
pects (the win) with no prob
lem."
Though Rennert spoke with
tongue in cheek, he was also
sadly prophetic, for he received
more attention from an an
nounced crowd of 1579 Maples
Pavilion patrons than he ever
bargained for.
The mark of a good player is
that he wins when he shouldn't:
that he can. through luck or
psych, pull a victory out of the
air. Rennert did just that Satur
day night with a controversial
4-6,7-6 (5-1), 7-5 win over Trin
ity's hard-hitting Tony Giam
malva.
The controversy centered over
two disputed line calls that
turned both the tide of the match
and the wrath of a supposedly
home-team crowd toward Re
nnert.
The second controversial call
was the most important because
it gave the match to Rennert.
Serving at 6-5. 3-2, the Cards'
Long Island native hit a
groundstroke which back lines
man Ken Miller immediately
ruled out.

va's overpowering serve-and
volley game, combined with sur
prising agility for a man the size
of a basketball forward, kept Re
nnert off-balance for much of the
match.
But the top-ranked amatuer in
the world would not be denied.
The first controversial call of the
night, a Giammalva ace which
Rennert disputed in the second
set's fourth game. lit a fire under
the Stanford star and gave him

the intensity his game had been
lacking up to that point.
Rennert's sudden motivation
was also fueled by the crowd,
which did not like his five
minute losing dispute over the
service ace. They began rooting
against him. except for a fiercely
partisan group of students sitting
in the lower stands.
After the match, readying for
the No. 1 doubles, Rennert ven
ted his frustration with the
"home" crowd.
"Sure it bothers me. I do ev
erything for this school and no
one appreciates it. I skipped a
year in the pros and stayed at
Stanford to help win the NCAA
team championships. 1 argue one
point and everyone turns against
me," he said. "The people were
against me and I don't think jus
tifiably so. We were up 7-0 and
they wanted something to root
for."
The evening's disputes over
shadowed the fact that Stanford
destroyed the nation's fifth
ranked team.
The Cards lost but four sets in
nine matches to virtually destroy
the same team that made the fi
nals of last year's NCAAs.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
was ecstatic. "This team has
been a sleeping giant. We're only
gonna get better." he said with a
smile that could light up a coal
mine. "Everybody else is going
to have to play pretty well to beat
us."
Gould had special praise for
No. 4 Scott Bondurant and
No. 6 Jeff Arons. Bon
durant. a 2-6, 6-1, 6-2 winner
over junior John Benson, "got
blown out in the first set and, as
soon as he saw an opening,
pounced on it."the coach said.
Bondurant cited a change in
rackets and a vocal crowd as the
keys to victorv. "I switched rac

kets in the middle of the first set
because the first one's handle
was too big," the sophomore
said. "The crowd was huge. They
got on Benson's case and lie let
up. I got a cheap break and the
momentum swung m\ way."
A 6-1, 7-fc (5-2) winner over
senior Eddie Reese, Arons "did
a great job." Gould said. "He
played aggressively, his serve
was great, not a blasting serve
but a high percentage one."
Arons was demoted to pI a -
tooning with freshman Jim Gur
fein after a midseason string of
losses. With this, his second con
secutive straight-set victory, he is
feeling more confident.
"The platooning doesn't
bother me," the Gunn High
School product said. "Jim is a
really good competitor. I have a
lot of respect for his game and 1
just want the team to win."
Both senior Lloyd Bourne and
freshman David Siegler pro
nounced their games "back on
the track" after Saturday's con
quests. Bourne whipped fellow
All-America Larry Gottfried
6-4. 6-3, while Siegler played
one of his best matches this sea
son with a 6-3, 6-2 win over
freshman Mark Pinchoff.
The schedule does not let up
for the Cards. They host fourth
ranked Pepperdine tomorrow,
beginning at 1:30 p.m. at the
tennis stadium. The Waves are
headed by All-America Eddie
Edwards, as well as hard-hitting
Rocky Vasquez.

route to a convincing 9-0 Cardinal win Saturday, retreated to the "friendly confines" of the
stands and helped himself to a Coors when a disputed call was ruled in his opponent's favor.
