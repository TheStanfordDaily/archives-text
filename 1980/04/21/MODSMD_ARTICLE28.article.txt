# Baseballers lose three on the road

### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
Cardinal hopes of snagging this year's
Pac-10 Conference crown were dimmed to
but a flicker this past weekend. The visiting
Cards were swept by the University of
Arizona in their three game series 6-4. 15-6.
7-5.
The losses, which dropped Stanford's con
ference record to 8-13. make Card chances
of taking the conference a long shot at best.
But. said head coach Mark Marquess, the
light may not have gone out on the Cards yet.
"There is always a chance for first place.
Despite this weekend, we're not mathemati
cally out of it yet. The league has been crazy
this year so it's hard to predict. But we still
have got a shot." said Marquess.
As of last weekend, and with first place
Arizona State coming to town for three this
weekend, that shot is moving farther and
farther away from Stanford's range.
The Cards, though, were in the ball game
last weekend both Thursday and Saturday.
They, said second baseman Paul Zuvella,
just couldn't seem "to put anything to
gether."
"We should have won the first game. We
hit the ball well enough to win and we were
ahead 4-2 most of the night. But they had a
big inning in the sixth and took the momen
tum away from us in the late innings,"
Zuvella, the leading hitter on the team, ad

ded.
The third game was even more disappoint
ing. In that game, the Cards outhit Arizona
14-6 and were up by three, 5-2. after six. The
next inning the Wildcats tied the score and
then in the eighth pushed home two more for
the clean sweep. "They didn't get that many
hits (in the third game) but the ones they got
really hurt us." said Marquess.
The difference all weekend was that
Arizona got the big, timely plays and Stan
ford didn't. In that first game, the Cardinals
left 10 men on base, a problem that has
haunted them as of late. Over the three
games. Marquess said. Stanford didn't make
that many errors, but again, the ones they did
make were costly.
Zuvella agreed. "We made too many mis
takes in crucial spots and those mistakes
were magnified in front of the 3500 scream
ing Arizona fans every night. Saturday, for
example, in one inning. Arizona opened with
a couple of walks and then we made a costly
error, instead of say. a saving double play.
All weekend we weren't making the big
play."
On Friday, though. Stanford didn't even
have the chance to make the big one. The
Cards, down 8-0 after only three innings,
were all but out of it from the start.
And Marquess attributed a lot of the
team's problems to the pitching. "Larry
Kuhn pitched alright in the first game and

fextremely 'well in the third game. Besides
that, we're giving up too much pitching-wise
— I don't mean hits but walks. We just aren't
pitching well and we're giving up errors when
we can least afford it,"he said.
"We don't have the pitching depth,"' he
added. "So lately we have been breaking up
the pitcher's innings, throwing two or three
pitchers a game. It allows us to do a few more
things."
Stanford will certainly need a few more
things and a few less injuries this week.
Shortstop Dave Meier is having problems
with his bad knee again. He could barely run
this weekend, yet was forced to play third
base, moving Bob DeCosta to short, because
of problems Steve Buechele was having with
his throwing arm.
And they don't have much time to rest.
San Jose State comes to Sunken Diamond
tomorrow and then powerful Arizona State
over the weekend, starting Friday. Arizona
State is currently leading the conference but
Zuvella vows that "there will be no 34-2
games here."
In fact, a guardedly optimistic Marquess
said that if "we pitch well and continue to hit
like we have been, we can play well. And we
can beat them."
But first San Jose State tomorrow. Tim
Sherreli will most likely get the starting nod
as he didn't pitch at all in Tucson. The Cardi
nals' overall record is now 24-17.

The third game was even more disappoint
ing. In that game, the Cards outhit Arizona
14-6 and were up by three, 5-2. after six. The
next inning the Wildcats tied the score and
then in the eighth pushed home two more for
the clean sweep. "They didn't get that many
hits (in the third game) but the ones they got
really hurt us." said Marquess.
The difference all weekend was that
Arizona got the big, timely plays and Stan
ford didn't. In that first game, the Cardinals
left 10 men on base, a problem that has
haunted them as of late. Over the three
games. Marquess said. Stanford didn't make
that many errors, but again, the ones they did
make were costly.
Zuvella agreed. "We made too many mis
takes in crucial spots and those mistakes
were magnified in front of the 3500 scream
ing Arizona fans every night. Saturday, for
example, in one inning. Arizona opened with
a couple of walks and then we made a costly
error, instead of say. a saving double play.
All weekend we weren't making the big
play."
On Friday, though. Stanford didn't even
have the chance to make the big one. The
Cards, down 8-0 after only three innings,
were all but out of it from the start.
And Marquess attributed a lot of the
team's problems to the pitching. "Larry
Kuhn pitched alright in the first game and

fextremely 'well in the third game. Besides
that, we're giving up too much pitching-wise
— I don't mean hits but walks. We just aren't
pitching well and we're giving up errors when
we can least afford it,"he said.
"We don't have the pitching depth,"' he
added. "So lately we have been breaking up
the pitcher's innings, throwing two or three
pitchers a game. It allows us to do a few more
things."
Stanford will certainly need a few more
things and a few less injuries this week.
Shortstop Dave Meier is having problems
with his bad knee again. He could barely run
this weekend, yet was forced to play third
base, moving Bob DeCosta to short, because
of problems Steve Buechele was having with
his throwing arm.
And they don't have much time to rest.
San Jose State comes to Sunken Diamond
tomorrow and then powerful Arizona State
over the weekend, starting Friday. Arizona
State is currently leading the conference but
Zuvella vows that "there will be no 34-2
games here."
In fact, a guardedly optimistic Marquess
said that if "we pitch well and continue to hit
like we have been, we can play well. And we
can beat them."
But first San Jose State tomorrow. Tim
Sherreli will most likely get the starting nod
as he didn't pitch at all in Tucson. The Cardi
nals' overall record is now 24-17.
Cardinal hopes of snagging this year's
Pac-10 Conference crown were dimmed to
but a flicker this past weekend. The visiting
Cards were swept by the University of
Arizona in their three game series 6-4. 15-6.
7-5.
The losses, which dropped Stanford's con
ference record to 8-13. make Card chances
of taking the conference a long shot at best.
But. said head coach Mark Marquess, the
light may not have gone out on the Cards yet.
"There is always a chance for first place.
Despite this weekend, we're not mathemati
cally out of it yet. The league has been crazy
this year so it's hard to predict. But we still
have got a shot." said Marquess.
As of last weekend, and with first place
Arizona State coming to town for three this
weekend, that shot is moving farther and
farther away from Stanford's range.
The Cards, though, were in the ball game
last weekend both Thursday and Saturday.
They, said second baseman Paul Zuvella,
just couldn't seem "to put anything to
gether."
"We should have won the first game. We
hit the ball well enough to win and we were
ahead 4-2 most of the night. But they had a
big inning in the sixth and took the momen
tum away from us in the late innings,"
Zuvella, the leading hitter on the team, ad

ded.
The third game was even more disappoint
ing. In that game, the Cards outhit Arizona
14-6 and were up by three, 5-2. after six. The
next inning the Wildcats tied the score and
