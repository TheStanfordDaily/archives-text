## Trojans rip women netters 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
As expected, the No. 1 ranked USC Trojans
women's tennis team defeated a young fifth
ranked Stanford squad 8-1 Friday.
What was a bit of a surprise was the lopsidedness
of the win. USC had defeated Stanford twice, in
cluding a trouncing in Los Angeles, but an im
proved Stanford squad was expected to fare better
at home.
"I just couldn't conceive of them playing any
better," commented Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan. "They are tougher than hell indoors."
The indoor play of the Trojans also impressed
their coach, Dave Borelli, but in actuality, the
match was long over before the gates were opened
at Maples Pavilion.
The Trojans dominated all three indoor matches
en route to their easy win. Trey Lewis defeated
Alycia Moulton tor the second straight time in the
No. 1 singles match and then teamed with Ann
White to capture the No. 1 doubles match over
Moulton and Sue Rasmyssen. Lewis handed
Moulton a 6-2. 7-6 (5-3 tiebreaker) setback in the
singles and teamed with White for a 6-4. 6-1 win in
the doubles.
In the other indoor match. Anna Lucia Fernan
dez beat Donna Rubin for the first time this year in
the No. 2 singles match 6-3, 6-1.
"I was really pleased with Anna Maria," said
Borelli. "She's really been having some problems
this season. Before today, she hadn't picked up
wins in any of our matches against top teams this
season, but she has really worked hard the last two
weeks — just going back to basics and working on
her strokes. 1 thought we'd win the match, I was
mostly concerned with Anna Maria. I think she is
one of the top four or five players in the nation and
I was waiting for her to come around."
"Fernandez played really well," said Brennan,
"and Lewis played well in her win over Alycia."
The real match was decided outdoors, though.
USC swept the outdoors singles matches and then
picked up an outdoor doubles win to sew up the
victory.

White led off the outdoor matches in the No. 3
spot with a 6-1, 7-6 (5-3 tiebreaker) win over
Caryn Copeland, Sheila Mclnerney edged Sue
Rasmussen 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in the closest singles
match of the day in the No. 4 spot. Nina Voydat
slipped past Julia Leighton 6-3, 6-3 at No. 5, and
A\nna Lucia Fernandez crushed Lisa Gordon 6-1,
6-1 in the sixth match.
Stanford picked up its only win of the day in the
No. 2 doubles match as Copeland and Rubin edged
Anna Maria and Mclnerney in a tense three-setter
4-6, 6-4. 6-3. but it held the Cards in the match
only momentarily as Anna Lucia and Susie Brown
clinched the USC victory in the third doubles
match with a 6-0. 3-6, 6-2 win over Leighton and
Gayle Chan.
Brennan was fairly pleased with the doubles
matches against the strong Trojan squad. "I en
joyed the doubles, not particularly the No. 1
match, but the other two. Actually, though, Moul
ton and Rasmussen won four more games in the
match than they had in Los Angeles. The No. 1
team finally won after getting beat by them twice
badly in the other two matches."
Nobody could accuse the Stanford squad of not
trying, as Moulton and Rasmussen fired missile
after missile at the highly-touted doubles tandem
of Lewis and White, but the pair returned every
thing with bullet-like reflexes and eventually the
frustrated Stanford pair went down to defeat.
Borelli feels that USCs title hopes are in its own
hands. *1 definitely think we're the team to beat.
It's in our own hands. It we're on. nobody's going
to beat us. it's just a question of whether we can
keep up our pace. We' re really deep, heck, our No.
6 player could play No. 1 at most schools. 1 don't
mean this to sound cocky, but I think our hopes are
in our own hands."
Stanford's next match is at Ojai this weekend
and Brennan looks forward to it. "Ojai is going to
be a lot of fun," he said. There are no team stand
ings so it's going to be kind of relaxed. It's the
biggest tennis tournament in the world so it will be
pretty exciting. Anything to take my mind off of the
match tonight."

proved Stanford squad was expected to fare better
at home.
"I just couldn't conceive of them playing any
better," commented Stanford Coach Frank Bren
nan. "They are tougher than hell indoors."
The indoor play of the Trojans also impressed
their coach, Dave Borelli, but in actuality, the
match was long over before the gates were opened
at Maples Pavilion.
The Trojans dominated all three indoor matches
en route to their easy win. Trey Lewis defeated
Alycia Moulton tor the second straight time in the
No. 1 singles match and then teamed with Ann
White to capture the No. 1 doubles match over
Moulton and Sue Rasmyssen. Lewis handed
Moulton a 6-2. 7-6 (5-3 tiebreaker) setback in the
singles and teamed with White for a 6-4. 6-1 win in
the doubles.
In the other indoor match. Anna Lucia Fernan
dez beat Donna Rubin for the first time this year in
the No. 2 singles match 6-3, 6-1.
"I was really pleased with Anna Maria," said
Borelli. "She's really been having some problems
this season. Before today, she hadn't picked up
wins in any of our matches against top teams this
season, but she has really worked hard the last two
weeks — just going back to basics and working on
her strokes. 1 thought we'd win the match, I was
mostly concerned with Anna Maria. I think she is
one of the top four or five players in the nation and
I was waiting for her to come around."
"Fernandez played really well," said Brennan,
"and Lewis played well in her win over Alycia."
The real match was decided outdoors, though.
USC swept the outdoors singles matches and then
picked up an outdoor doubles win to sew up the
victory.

White led off the outdoor matches in the No. 3
spot with a 6-1, 7-6 (5-3 tiebreaker) win over
Caryn Copeland, Sheila Mclnerney edged Sue
Rasmussen 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 in the closest singles
match of the day in the No. 4 spot. Nina Voydat
slipped past Julia Leighton 6-3, 6-3 at No. 5, and
A\nna Lucia Fernandez crushed Lisa Gordon 6-1,
6-1 in the sixth match.
Stanford picked up its only win of the day in the
No. 2 doubles match as Copeland and Rubin edged
Anna Maria and Mclnerney in a tense three-setter
4-6, 6-4. 6-3. but it held the Cards in the match
only momentarily as Anna Lucia and Susie Brown
clinched the USC victory in the third doubles
match with a 6-0. 3-6, 6-2 win over Leighton and
Gayle Chan.
Brennan was fairly pleased with the doubles
matches against the strong Trojan squad. "I en
joyed the doubles, not particularly the No. 1
match, but the other two. Actually, though, Moul
ton and Rasmussen won four more games in the
match than they had in Los Angeles. The No. 1
team finally won after getting beat by them twice
badly in the other two matches."
Nobody could accuse the Stanford squad of not
trying, as Moulton and Rasmussen fired missile
after missile at the highly-touted doubles tandem
of Lewis and White, but the pair returned every
thing with bullet-like reflexes and eventually the
frustrated Stanford pair went down to defeat.
Borelli feels that USCs title hopes are in its own
hands. *1 definitely think we're the team to beat.
It's in our own hands. It we're on. nobody's going
to beat us. it's just a question of whether we can
keep up our pace. We' re really deep, heck, our No.
6 player could play No. 1 at most schools. 1 don't
mean this to sound cocky, but I think our hopes are
in our own hands."
Stanford's next match is at Ojai this weekend
and Brennan looks forward to it. "Ojai is going to
be a lot of fun," he said. There are no team stand
ings so it's going to be kind of relaxed. It's the
biggest tennis tournament in the world so it will be
pretty exciting. Anything to take my mind off of the
match tonight."
As expected, the No. 1 ranked USC Trojans
women's tennis team defeated a young fifth
ranked Stanford squad 8-1 Friday.
What was a bit of a surprise was the lopsidedness
of the win. USC had defeated Stanford twice, in
cluding a trouncing in Los Angeles, but an im
proved Stanford squad was expected to fare better
at home.
