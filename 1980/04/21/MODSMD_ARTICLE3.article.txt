A panel of experts examined Ameri
can national defense policy and ap
proaches to securing world peace at an
all-day symposium held here Saturday.
Among those speaking to the 75
people gathered in Kresge Aud. for the
event which was organized by Stanford
Against Conscription were: Prof.
Richard Falk of Princeton Univ.,
former Deputy Asst. Secretary of De
fense Prof. Henry Rowen, Prof, of
Political Science Hubert Marshall, and
Assoc. Prof, of History Paul Seaver.
In the first half of the symposium, the
panelists analyzed some of the prob
lems faced by American foreign
policy-makers in the Third World, par
ticularly the Middle East and Iran.
Prof. Falk in his keynote address

identified "the various revolutionary
nationalist movements," such as the
one led by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran,
as constituting "the basic flow of his
tory at this point in the world." He
criticized President Jimmy Carters re
cent threats to impose military sanc
tions against Iran as being against U.S.
long-term interests, because such sanc
tions would amount to an attempt to
oppose this nationalist trend, according
to Falk.
"The flow of history cannot be ar
rested by military means, there's no
way to crush revolutionary
nationalism," Falk said.
Prof. Falk also blamed multi
national corporations, the military
industrial complex, and the "imperial
frame of mind" of U.S. policy-makers
for creating militarist, anti-national

doctrines.
Prof, of Political Science Alexander
George agreed with Falk's analysis of
American military intervention in Iran,
and added that a "naval blockade of
Iran will not work. It is a high-risk ven
ture that might blow up in (Carter's)
face."
Ralph Magnus, a professor of Politi
cal Science at the Navy Postgraduate
School in Monterey, disagreed with
Falk, claiming that the U.S. has been
accommodating radical nationalist
causes for some time.
Magnus also claimed that the more
militarist policies followed by the Car
ter Administration in recent months
toward Iran have had a beneficial ef
fect, causing the revolutionary gov
ernment there to allow the Red Cross
to visit the American hostages in

Tehran.
Falk laterchallfenged this, saying that
the Red Cross visits had been cleared
by Khomeini some time before the
U.S. adopted its hard-line policy.
Ngugara Lipumbra, a Tanzanian
doctoral candidate at the Food Re
search Institute here, agreed with Prof.
Falk's assessment of nationalist move
ments in Third World countries.
Lipumbra said that he opposed
stepped-up U.S. military presence in
the Indian Ocean. He said that by ask
ing Third World nations for permission
to build bases within their borders, the
U.S. forces them to take sides in the
ongoing power struggle between the
U.S. and the USSR. The bases, once
built, would make these countries a
target for aggression in the event of any
military conflict, according to
Lipumbra.
In the second part of the symposium,
"The Roots of Peace," the panelists
considered possible means of obtaining
and maintaining peace.
Prof. Falk recommended that the
U.S. seek peace with the Iranians by
making a formal apology to that coun
try, followed by a congressional inves
tigation into crimes committed by the
U.S. against Iran.
"It's been 140 days since the hos
tages were taken; why not also say that
it's been days since Henry Kis
singer and David Rockefeller pres
sured the president to take the shah
into this country," said Falk.
Over the long run, Falk called for a
"more radical understanding of peace
and war" which would include: a firmly
held U.S. policy abandoning war as a
way of solving international disputes, a
more equitable method of sharing
world energy resources with other
countries, and the fostering of a
"planetary identity" transcending na
tional boundaries and contributing to
international goodwill.
Pacifist Paul Seaver admitted that
"religious pacifists have no practical al
ternatives to the age-old problems of
war. because if they had, political lead
ers would have long-ago become
pacifists." However, Seaver noted,
"the nation whose ego is limited only
by the size of its military budget is a
relatively recent development, and
may not represent the greatest de
velopment in human wisdom."
Prof. Henry Rowan stressed that the
oil that comes from the Middle East is
"important, but not vital" to U.S. in

terests. Military escalation in that area
with implications of nuclear weapons
use is, therefore, "a fault of the worst
kind," according to Rowan.
Instead Rowan suggested the U.S.
build an "effective conventional coun
terweight" in the Persian Gulf region
to balance the Soviet threat in the
North of Iran.
Prof. Hubert Marshall spoke of
"stick-and-carrot" sanctions in U.S. re
lations with the USSR, particularly
with regard to the conflict in Afghanis
tan. Negative sanctions, or "sticks,"
such as military force, said Marshall,
have never worked in trying to influ
ence Soviet behavior. Instead, he said,
the U.S. should use "carrots," positive
sanctions, such as offering the Soviets
more technological aid, and most
favored-nation trade status to encour
age them to act more appropriately.
"We must provide the Soviets with a
reason to believe that they can hope for
better relations with the U. 5.," Mar
shall added.
Douglass Mattern, Secretary Gen
eral of the World Citizen's Assembly,
criticized the"incredible over-kill arms
race" between the U.S. and the USSR,
which, he said, is causing the super
powers to play "nuclear chess with
human pawns." He advocated a SALT
111 agreement as offering a hope of re
versing the escalation of nuclear
weapons.
Rev. Carolyn Roberts, of the Mid-
Peninsula Conversion Project, pointed
out that Santa Clara County receives
more money from defense contracts
per-capita than any other county in the
nation. She advocated converting the
defense industry here to more peaceful
civilian purposes.
