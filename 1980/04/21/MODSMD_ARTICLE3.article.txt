A panel of experts examined Ameri
can national defense policy and ap
proaches to securing world peace at an
all-day symposium held here Saturday.
Among those speaking to the 75
people gathered in Kresge Aud. for the
event which was organized by Stanford
Against Conscription were: Prof.
Richard Falk of Princeton Univ.,
former Deputy Asst. Secretary of De
fense Prof. Henry Rowen, Prof, of
Political Science Hubert Marshall, and
Assoc. Prof, of History Paul Seaver.
In the first half of the symposium, the
panelists analyzed some of the prob
lems faced by American foreign
policy-makers in the Third World, par
ticularly the Middle East and Iran.
Prof. Falk in his keynote address

identified "the various revolutionary
nationalist movements," such as the
one led by Ayatollah Khomeini in Iran,
as constituting "the basic flow of his
tory at this point in the world." He
criticized President Jimmy Carters re
cent threats to impose military sanc
tions against Iran as being against U.S.
long-term interests, because such sanc
tions would amount to an attempt to
oppose this nationalist trend, according
to Falk.
"The flow of history cannot be ar
rested by military means, there's no
way to crush revolutionary
nationalism," Falk said.
Prof. Falk also blamed multi
national corporations, the military
industrial complex, and the "imperial
frame of mind" of U.S. policy-makers
for creating militarist, anti-national

doctrines.
Prof, of Political Science Alexander
George agreed with Falk's analysis of
American military intervention in Iran,
and added that a "naval blockade of
Iran will not work. It is a high-risk ven
ture that might blow up in (Carter's)
face."
Ralph Magnus, a professor of Politi
cal Science at the Navy Postgraduate
School in Monterey, disagreed with
Falk, claiming that the U.S. has been
accommodating radical nationalist
causes for some time.
Magnus also claimed that the more
militarist policies followed by the Car
ter Administration in recent months
toward Iran have had a beneficial ef
fect, causing the revolutionary gov
ernment there to allow the Red Cross
to visit the American hostages in

Tehran.
Falk laterchallfenged this, saying that
the Red Cross visits had been cleared
by Khomeini some time before the
U.S. adopted its hard-line policy.
Ngugara Lipumbra, a Tanzanian
doctoral candidate at the Food Re
search Institute here, agreed with Prof.
Falk's assessment of nationalist move
ments in Third World countries.
Lipumbra said that he opposed
stepped-up U.S. military presence in
the Indian Ocean. He said that by ask
ing Third World nations for permission
to build bases within their borders, the
U.S. forces them to take sides in the
ongoing power struggle between the
U.S. and the USSR. The bases, once
built, would make these countries a
target for aggression in the event of any
