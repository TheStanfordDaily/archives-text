### Steve Odell Staff Writer 
The Stanford track team went
to the prestigious Mt. SAC Re
lays this weekend, and came
home with some good results.
The Relays, which were held at
San Antonio College just east of
Los Angeles, and are one of the
annual "big meets" in the West,
produced four impressive wins
for the men's and women's
teams.

The Cardinal men won two of
the relays, with victories in the
4 x 400 meters and the 4 x 1500
meters. In the 4 x 400 relay, Gor
don Banks, Darrin Nelson,
Robert Maiocco and Garry
Shumway combined for a win
ning time of 3:20.5; and in the
4 x 1500 relay, the Cardinal
team of Dennis Arriola, Rod
Berry, Mike Melendez and John
Schaer took the tape first with a
time of 15:38.3.

Gary B runner got the only in
dividual win for the Stanford
men, winning the javelin with a
toss of 230-4. Bruner's winning
effort came on his last throw, and
head coacli Brooks Johnson re
marked, "He just continues to
do well." The Cards also got fine
performances in the hammer.
Kick Buss was fourth with a
throw of 214-10 and teammate
Dave Thompson hit a personal
best with his toss of 203-8 â€” just
four inches shy of a qualifying
throw for the Olympics.
On the women's side of the
track, "the meet went really
well,' 1 according to coach Laurel
Treon. "It was a quite successful
meet for the three girls who

went," she said.
Kim Schnurpfeil won the wo
men's invitational 5000 meters
in 16:54.7. "It was an excellent
race. Kim ran away from all her
competitors," Treon said.
Although, "there were some
quality names in the field,"
everyone surprisingly hung back.
Ihus, although Schnurpfeil
broke away with six laps remain
ing in the race, her winning time
\Vas on the slow side. Hot and
smoggy conditions also contri
buted to slower performances,
Treon added.
Freshman Mary Osborne
placed tilth overall in the invita
tional javelin competition with a
1980 personal record heave of

49.4 meters or 160 feet, 1 1 in
ches.
Johnson was pleased with his
team's effort. "It was our first
really big away meet this year. I
compare it to the (Martin
Luther) King Games. It seems
the bigger the meet, the better
we do. The performances that
w re turned in are y en
couraging.
"Gary Bruner's win just
exemplifies the way we seem to
react well to pressure. He was
behind and then won it on his last
throw. There was a big crowd
and a lot at stake, but he just
reached down and pulled it out.
It was a good day for all the com
petitors."
