With an incredible perfor
mance, the Stanford golf team
took top honors in the Stanford
Invitational yesterday.
The Stanford golfers beat out
a strong field of 34 teams, includ
ing Top 10 ranked UCLA, USC
and Arizona State, and Top 20
teams Fresno State, UOP and
San Jose State.
"It's one of the strongest col
legiate fields in the country,"
said Cardinal coach David
Yates.
The Stanford team tallied
1092 strokes over the three days
of the tournament, six strokes in
front of second place Arizona,
with 1098. UCLA took third
place with 1100, followedby San
Jose with 1101 and USC with
1102.
The Stanford team got off to a
good start, the team overall was
even par after the first round.
"That's the first time we got
off on a good foot in a tourna
ment," said Yates.
After the first round the Car
dinals kept on the pressure. They
led from start to finish.
"This is the first time that they
went out aggressive," said Yates.

The Stanford golfers put in a
solid team effort. First for Stan
ford was Steve Schroeder, with
215, followed by Ken Baskt with
219, Paul Games and Jack Skil
ling with 220, Neil Robinson
with 221 and Doug Clarke shot
229.
Schroeder wus third overall in
the tournament, missing the lead
by just two strokes. He followed
Brian Williams of Seattle Univ.
with 213 and Smokey Brau of
San Diego. 215.
"He's done a great job of lead
ing us as a senior," said Yates of
Schroeder. "1 can't say enough
about Steve. He practices hard
and plays well."
There is a good chance that the
Stanford team will jump into the
national Top 20 with this week's
performance, according to
Yates.
"I'm really proud of them.
They got what they deserved,"
said Yates. "Maybe we've
turned the corner."
Yates hopes the momentum
the team has will carry them
through the Sun Devil Tourna
ment and the Pacific-10 champ
ionships in the next few weeks. A
solid performance in both should
clinch an NCAA berth.
