# Spikers lose, close at home
## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
With a tennis match at Maples
and a Folk Festival at Roble the
men's volleyball team had to
wrap up its home season off
campus. Friday night at De Anza
College, Stanford lost three in a
row to USC 15-6, 15-12 and
15-8, while on Saturday at
Foothill College Pepperdine
took three straight 15-7, 15-10
and 15-13.
Stanford's record now stands
at 7-12 overall and 5-12 in con
ference play.
After quickly falling behind
7-0 in Friday's first game, the
Cards closed the score to 8-6
with points coming from a USC
net violation and a Trojan spike
out of bounds. USC stayed in
control for nearly the remainder
of the game, however. The Car
dinals appeared to be simply
outclassed by the powerful Tro
jans.
In the second game, Stanford
proved it could provide stronger
competition. With the score 3-2
in USC's favor. Rod Fletcher
and blocker Kim Lum blocked a
spike over the net to tie the game
at three. At this point Stanford
began to pick up steam.
Stanford soon had the
momentum but USC fought
back. The lead see-sawed until
Trojan All-America Dusty
Dvorak tapped the ball over to
tie the game at 12. Stanford
couldn't get on track again and
the Trojans spiked their way to a
15-12 win.
The third game of the night
belonged to USC, which built an
early lead and never lost it.
Tom Grimes blocked a pair of
successive spike attempts to pull

the Cards within one, but the
Trojans offense put a string of
points together for the win.
Stanford's Jack Foxworth re
turned for the Pepperdine
match, having been previously
hampered by an ankle injury, but
the Cardinals still had difficulty
getting their offense together.
The first game began pretty
evenly, with both clubs playing
solid defense. After Stanford let
a 4-6 lead slip to a 7-7 deadlock,
Pepperdine came on stronger
and scored eight straight points
for the win.
Stanford scored quickly in the
next game and possessed a 6-3
lead early. Foxworth was the
main contributor as he joined
with Fletcher to block spike at
tempts from Pepperdine's
6-foot-9 Craig Buck. Offen
sively Foxworth slapped a pair of
Engen set-ups to the middle of
the Waves' defense.
Buck started Pepperdine mov
ing with three consecutive spikes
at the net. Later, Buck blocked a
Foxwbrth attempt just before
pounding a spike to take a 13-10
lead. Eventually, it was he who
knocked a Stanford spike back
over for the winning point.
Stanford began game three
with a new lineup as Andrew
Dodds, Cory Brown and
Reagan replaced Lum, McColl
and Frank Anderson. At first the
change didn't seem to help as the
Cards fell behind 6-1 early.
Foxworth and Fletcher again
formed a wall at the net and Pep
perdine suffered a few offensive
errors to bring Stanford within
two, 8-6.
The Waves regrouped and
built a 14-7 lead after scoring
four consecutive points, but they

had to fight for the last point.
Engen set up a Foxworth spike
that triggered a Cardinal rally.
Mark Reagan and Fletcher
teamed at the net to stop a
couple of spikes, and Pepperdine
helped by hitting the ball out
twice in a row. The game ended
on a debatable call when the ball
bounced off a Pepperdine player
and hit Fletcher before touching
down.

evenly, with both clubs playing
solid defense. After Stanford let
a 4-6 lead slip to a 7-7 deadlock,
Pepperdine came on stronger
and scored eight straight points
for the win.
Stanford scored quickly in the
next game and possessed a 6-3
lead early. Foxworth was the
main contributor as he joined
with Fletcher to block spike at
tempts from Pepperdine's
6-foot-9 Craig Buck. Offen
sively Foxworth slapped a pair of
Engen set-ups to the middle of
the Waves' defense.
Buck started Pepperdine mov
ing with three consecutive spikes
at the net. Later, Buck blocked a
Foxwbrth attempt just before
pounding a spike to take a 13-10
lead. Eventually, it was he who
knocked a Stanford spike back
over for the winning point.
Stanford began game three
with a new lineup as Andrew
Dodds, Cory Brown and
Reagan replaced Lum, McColl
and Frank Anderson. At first the
change didn't seem to help as the
Cards fell behind 6-1 early.
Foxworth and Fletcher again
formed a wall at the net and Pep
perdine suffered a few offensive
errors to bring Stanford within
two, 8-6.
The Waves regrouped and
built a 14-7 lead after scoring
four consecutive points, but they

had to fight for the last point.
Engen set up a Foxworth spike
that triggered a Cardinal rally.
Mark Reagan and Fletcher
teamed at the net to stop a
couple of spikes, and Pepperdine
helped by hitting the ball out
twice in a row. The game ended
on a debatable call when the ball
bounced off a Pepperdine player
and hit Fletcher before touching
down.
