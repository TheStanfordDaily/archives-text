Kennedy looks to Penn. primary
PHILADELPHIA — This city founded on
brotherly love has turned into an angry town. And
that anger is fueling Sen. Edward Kennedy's chal
lenge to President Jimmy Carter in tomorrow's
Pennsylvania primary.
The underlying cause of the resentment, which is
most pervasive here in Philadelphia but also is evi
dent elsewhere in the state, is economic — the grind
ing pressure of inflation, budget cuts and layoffs for
which many voters blame the president.
"He promised us the world, but now we're getting
nothing," said Lynwood Jones, a west Philadelphia
grocery clerk. Like the vast majority of Philadelphia
blacks, Jones voted for Carter in the 197b Democra
tic primary, but he plans to switch to Kennedy tomor
row.
In the Republican primary. George Bush is waging
a desperate struggle to keep his candidacy alive. His
goal is to beat Ronald Reagan in presidential prefer
ence balloting that is non-binding on the state's 83
delegates to the GOP national convention. And with
a $1 million campaign effort here. Bush seems to be
cutting into Reagan's once substantial lead in the
popular vote.
Kennedy strategists, who learned how to convert
the politics of discontent into victory in last month's
New York primary, are hoping to repeat that success
here where 185 convention delegates and considera
ble prestige are at stake.
The key to Kennedy's chance is Philadelphia which
will produce about 20 percent of the statewide
Democratic vote.
Draft registration renewal likely
WASHINGTON — The House appears likely to
vote this week to renew peacetime draft registration,
and the House and Senate may vote to balance the
federal budget.
White House officials say they're confident the
House will approve tomorrow the S 13.3 million Pres
ident Jimmy Carter needs to renew draft registration
for 19- and 20-year-old men at post offices this sum
mer.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill told reporters "1
would be very surprised if it does not pass."
He said the White House count then showed about
206 House votes for registration and 86 against with
the rest of the 435 House members undecided or
uncounted.
Opponents say they still hope to defeat registration
in the House but say their best chance is in the Senate,
where Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) has vowed to try
to kill it with a filibuster.
Carter wanted to register women as well. But a
House subcommittee defeated authority he would
need for that and Congress has done nothing further
about it.
Carter's plan would require all 19- and 20-year old
men to register at post offices as soon as the system
could be set up this summer, so they could be called

faster it Congress renewed the draft itself in an
emergency.
lOC keeps "84 Olympics in L.A.
GENEVA, Switzerland — Lord Killanin, presi
dent of the International Olympic Committee, de
clared here yesterday after a six-hour meeting with
Los Angeles Olympics president Peter Uerberroth
that there is "no question" of moving the 1984
Olympics from Los Angeles.
But Killanin and lOC executive director Monique
Berlioux reportedly expressed concern during the
meeting that the lOC Executive Board, which meets
in nearby Lausanne this week, might decide to insti
tute sanctions against the U.S. Olympic Committee
for its vote April 12 to endorse the boycott of this
summer's Moscow Olympics.
A few hours after the meeting had broken up in the
early hours yesterday morning in the Intercontinental
Hotel here, Ueberroth said that he was reassured that
even if the L'SOC was suspended from the World
Olympic movement for two years, the Los Angeles
Olympic effort would go on.
The lOC president appeared to be trying to steer
the executive board discussions away from the 1954
Games when he expressly declared in a short written
statement that the subject of the Lausanne meetings
this week would be the Moscow Games.
Soviets renew detente with West
PARIS — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko will arrive here Wednesday for top-level
talks with the French that Western diplomats see as
the opening of a Soviet peace offensive.
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev last week invited
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to visit
Moscow this summer at a time of his choosing.
Schmidt has said he will be consulting his major allies
before deciding whether to go.
Meanwhile, Gromyko will be seeing Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance, British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington and French Foreign Minister Andre
Francois-Poncet in mid-May. All foij,r will be in Vie
nna for the 25th anniversary of the Austrian State
Treats that ended the allied powers' postwar occupa
tion of the country.
In general, diplomats in Western Europe doubt
that all this acti\ ity is likely to produce any new Soviet
initiatives. Instead, they feel. Moscow's aim is to try
to give the impression that things are getting back to
normal between the Soviet Union and Western
Europe and that detente is beginning to take effect
again.
The Gromyko visit to Paris has been proceeded by
a Soviet propaganda effort to drive a diplomatic
wedge between Europe and the United States.
Castro asked to set refugees' fate
HAVANA. Cuba — The United States and other
governments have asked Cuba to clarify its changing
positions about how to evacuate 10,500 refugees.

Diplomats here are hoping that President Fidel
Castro will reverse his sudden decision that the re
fugees, who two weeks yigo stormed the Peruvian
Embassy, may no longer leave for Costa Rica as a first
stop on their way to a new home. From now on they
must he picked up by the receiving country and go at
once to their destination instead of awaiting proces
sing in Costa Rica, Castro said.
For most refugees this will mean a serious delay in
departure, diplomats said, and for the countries who
have agreed to receive Cubans but have small or no
diplomatic representation here, it will complicate
matters.
Costa Rica told Cuba yesterday it was willing to
grant permanent asylum to all Cubans still trying to
leave their communist-governed homeland, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman announced.
He said Costa Rica had made its offer known in a
message to Cuban President Fidel Castro. The mes
sage also appealed to Castro to let evacuation flights
resume immediately.
Auto workers end 172-day strike
CHICAGO — The longest major strike in United
Auto Workers' history came to an end yesterday as
union members voted overwhelmingly to accept a
new three-year contract with International Harvester
Co., a union official said.
"Even if the remaining locals voted 100 percent
against the agreement, it wouldn't change anything
now," said Pat Creathouse, UAW vice president. He
declared the contract ratified yesterday as ratification
vote totals ran more than 4-1 in favor of ending the
strike.
Many of the workers were expected to begin head
ing back to the job for the first shift today.
Bargainers for the company and the union reached
tentative agreement on the proposed national con
tract last Thursday after more than eight months of
negotiations. The pact includes a 3 percent pay raise
each of the three years of the contract plus quarterly
cost-of-living adjustments and improved pension be
nefits.
Israelites mourn dead of five wars
JERUSALEM — Air raid sirens wailed the length
and breadth of Israel yesterday as the 3.5 million
living paid tribute to the 10,000 dead.
Yom Ha Zicharon, the Day of Remembrance, was
observed in synagogues and military cemeteries — a
nation still besieged paying tribute to the dead of five
wars.
But at sunset the mood changed, celebration re
placed mourning and the 32nd anniversary of na
tional independence was heralded by dancing in the
streets.
"Peace is far away," Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man told thousands gathered at the military cemetery
at Mount Herzl, overlooking Jerusalem. "We are
reminded of that by the criminal attack on Misgav
Am."

Draft registration renewal likely
WASHINGTON — The House appears likely to
vote this week to renew peacetime draft registration,
and the House and Senate may vote to balance the
federal budget.
White House officials say they're confident the
House will approve tomorrow the S 13.3 million Pres
ident Jimmy Carter needs to renew draft registration
for 19- and 20-year-old men at post offices this sum
mer.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill told reporters "1
would be very surprised if it does not pass."
He said the White House count then showed about
206 House votes for registration and 86 against with
the rest of the 435 House members undecided or
uncounted.
Opponents say they still hope to defeat registration
in the House but say their best chance is in the Senate,
where Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) has vowed to try
to kill it with a filibuster.
Carter wanted to register women as well. But a
House subcommittee defeated authority he would
need for that and Congress has done nothing further
about it.
Carter's plan would require all 19- and 20-year old
men to register at post offices as soon as the system
could be set up this summer, so they could be called

faster it Congress renewed the draft itself in an
emergency.
lOC keeps "84 Olympics in L.A.
GENEVA, Switzerland — Lord Killanin, presi
dent of the International Olympic Committee, de
clared here yesterday after a six-hour meeting with
Los Angeles Olympics president Peter Uerberroth
that there is "no question" of moving the 1984
Olympics from Los Angeles.
But Killanin and lOC executive director Monique
Berlioux reportedly expressed concern during the
meeting that the lOC Executive Board, which meets
in nearby Lausanne this week, might decide to insti
tute sanctions against the U.S. Olympic Committee
for its vote April 12 to endorse the boycott of this
summer's Moscow Olympics.
A few hours after the meeting had broken up in the
early hours yesterday morning in the Intercontinental
Hotel here, Ueberroth said that he was reassured that
even if the L'SOC was suspended from the World
Olympic movement for two years, the Los Angeles
Olympic effort would go on.
The lOC president appeared to be trying to steer
the executive board discussions away from the 1954
Games when he expressly declared in a short written
statement that the subject of the Lausanne meetings
this week would be the Moscow Games.
Soviets renew detente with West
PARIS — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko will arrive here Wednesday for top-level
talks with the French that Western diplomats see as
the opening of a Soviet peace offensive.
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev last week invited
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to visit
Moscow this summer at a time of his choosing.
Schmidt has said he will be consulting his major allies
before deciding whether to go.
Meanwhile, Gromyko will be seeing Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance, British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington and French Foreign Minister Andre
Francois-Poncet in mid-May. All foij,r will be in Vie
nna for the 25th anniversary of the Austrian State
Treats that ended the allied powers' postwar occupa
tion of the country.
In general, diplomats in Western Europe doubt
that all this acti\ ity is likely to produce any new Soviet
initiatives. Instead, they feel. Moscow's aim is to try
to give the impression that things are getting back to
normal between the Soviet Union and Western
Europe and that detente is beginning to take effect
again.
The Gromyko visit to Paris has been proceeded by
a Soviet propaganda effort to drive a diplomatic
wedge between Europe and the United States.
Castro asked to set refugees' fate
HAVANA. Cuba — The United States and other
governments have asked Cuba to clarify its changing
positions about how to evacuate 10,500 refugees.

Diplomats here are hoping that President Fidel
Castro will reverse his sudden decision that the re
fugees, who two weeks yigo stormed the Peruvian
Embassy, may no longer leave for Costa Rica as a first
stop on their way to a new home. From now on they
must he picked up by the receiving country and go at
once to their destination instead of awaiting proces
sing in Costa Rica, Castro said.
For most refugees this will mean a serious delay in
departure, diplomats said, and for the countries who
have agreed to receive Cubans but have small or no
diplomatic representation here, it will complicate
matters.
Costa Rica told Cuba yesterday it was willing to
grant permanent asylum to all Cubans still trying to
leave their communist-governed homeland, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman announced.
He said Costa Rica had made its offer known in a
message to Cuban President Fidel Castro. The mes
sage also appealed to Castro to let evacuation flights
resume immediately.
Auto workers end 172-day strike
CHICAGO — The longest major strike in United
Auto Workers' history came to an end yesterday as
union members voted overwhelmingly to accept a
new three-year contract with International Harvester
Co., a union official said.
"Even if the remaining locals voted 100 percent
against the agreement, it wouldn't change anything
now," said Pat Creathouse, UAW vice president. He
declared the contract ratified yesterday as ratification
vote totals ran more than 4-1 in favor of ending the
strike.
Many of the workers were expected to begin head
ing back to the job for the first shift today.
Bargainers for the company and the union reached
tentative agreement on the proposed national con
tract last Thursday after more than eight months of
negotiations. The pact includes a 3 percent pay raise
each of the three years of the contract plus quarterly
cost-of-living adjustments and improved pension be
nefits.
Israelites mourn dead of five wars
JERUSALEM — Air raid sirens wailed the length
and breadth of Israel yesterday as the 3.5 million
living paid tribute to the 10,000 dead.
Yom Ha Zicharon, the Day of Remembrance, was
observed in synagogues and military cemeteries — a
nation still besieged paying tribute to the dead of five
wars.
But at sunset the mood changed, celebration re
placed mourning and the 32nd anniversary of na
tional independence was heralded by dancing in the
streets.
"Peace is far away," Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man told thousands gathered at the military cemetery
at Mount Herzl, overlooking Jerusalem. "We are
reminded of that by the criminal attack on Misgav
Am."

Kennedy looks to Penn. primary
PHILADELPHIA — This city founded on
brotherly love has turned into an angry town. And
that anger is fueling Sen. Edward Kennedy's chal

Pennsylvania primary.
The underlying cause of the resentment, which is
most pervasive here in Philadelphia but also is evi

which many voters blame the president.
"He promised us the world, but now we're getting
nothing," said Lynwood Jones, a west Philadelphia
grocery clerk. Like the vast majority of Philadelphia
blacks, Jones voted for Carter in the 197b Democra

for 19- and 20-year-old men at post offices this sum
mer.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill told reporters "1
would be very surprised if it does not pass."
He said the White House count then showed about
206 House votes for registration and 86 against with
the rest of the 435 House members undecided or
uncounted.
Opponents say they still hope to defeat registration
in the House but say their best chance is in the Senate,
where Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) has vowed to try
to kill it with a filibuster.
Carter wanted to register women as well. But a
House subcommittee defeated authority he would
need for that and Congress has done nothing further
about it.
Carter's plan would require all 19- and 20-year old
men to register at post offices as soon as the system
could be set up this summer, so they could be called

faster it Congress renewed the draft itself in an
emergency.
lOC keeps "84 Olympics in L.A.
GENEVA, Switzerland — Lord Killanin, presi
dent of the International Olympic Committee, de
clared here yesterday after a six-hour meeting with
Los Angeles Olympics president Peter Uerberroth
that there is "no question" of moving the 1984
Olympics from Los Angeles.
But Killanin and lOC executive director Monique
Berlioux reportedly expressed concern during the
meeting that the lOC Executive Board, which meets
in nearby Lausanne this week, might decide to insti
tute sanctions against the U.S. Olympic Committee
for its vote April 12 to endorse the boycott of this
summer's Moscow Olympics.
A few hours after the meeting had broken up in the
early hours yesterday morning in the Intercontinental
Hotel here, Ueberroth said that he was reassured that
even if the L'SOC was suspended from the World
Olympic movement for two years, the Los Angeles
Olympic effort would go on.
The lOC president appeared to be trying to steer
the executive board discussions away from the 1954
Games when he expressly declared in a short written
statement that the subject of the Lausanne meetings
this week would be the Moscow Games.
Soviets renew detente with West
PARIS — Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko will arrive here Wednesday for top-level
talks with the French that Western diplomats see as
the opening of a Soviet peace offensive.
Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev last week invited
West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt to visit
Moscow this summer at a time of his choosing.
Schmidt has said he will be consulting his major allies
before deciding whether to go.
Meanwhile, Gromyko will be seeing Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance, British Foreign Secretary Lord
Carrington and French Foreign Minister Andre
Francois-Poncet in mid-May. All foij,r will be in Vie
nna for the 25th anniversary of the Austrian State
Treats that ended the allied powers' postwar occupa
tion of the country.
In general, diplomats in Western Europe doubt
that all this acti\ ity is likely to produce any new Soviet
initiatives. Instead, they feel. Moscow's aim is to try
to give the impression that things are getting back to
normal between the Soviet Union and Western
Europe and that detente is beginning to take effect
again.
The Gromyko visit to Paris has been proceeded by
a Soviet propaganda effort to drive a diplomatic
wedge between Europe and the United States.
Castro asked to set refugees' fate
HAVANA. Cuba — The United States and other
governments have asked Cuba to clarify its changing
positions about how to evacuate 10,500 refugees.

Diplomats here are hoping that President Fidel
Castro will reverse his sudden decision that the re
fugees, who two weeks yigo stormed the Peruvian
Embassy, may no longer leave for Costa Rica as a first
stop on their way to a new home. From now on they
must he picked up by the receiving country and go at
once to their destination instead of awaiting proces
sing in Costa Rica, Castro said.
For most refugees this will mean a serious delay in
departure, diplomats said, and for the countries who
have agreed to receive Cubans but have small or no
diplomatic representation here, it will complicate
matters.
Costa Rica told Cuba yesterday it was willing to
grant permanent asylum to all Cubans still trying to
leave their communist-governed homeland, a
Foreign Ministry spokesman announced.
He said Costa Rica had made its offer known in a
message to Cuban President Fidel Castro. The mes
sage also appealed to Castro to let evacuation flights
resume immediately.
Auto workers end 172-day strike
CHICAGO — The longest major strike in United
Auto Workers' history came to an end yesterday as
union members voted overwhelmingly to accept a
new three-year contract with International Harvester
Co., a union official said.
"Even if the remaining locals voted 100 percent
against the agreement, it wouldn't change anything
now," said Pat Creathouse, UAW vice president. He
declared the contract ratified yesterday as ratification
vote totals ran more than 4-1 in favor of ending the
strike.
Many of the workers were expected to begin head
ing back to the job for the first shift today.
Bargainers for the company and the union reached
tentative agreement on the proposed national con
tract last Thursday after more than eight months of
negotiations. The pact includes a 3 percent pay raise
each of the three years of the contract plus quarterly
cost-of-living adjustments and improved pension be
nefits.
Israelites mourn dead of five wars
JERUSALEM — Air raid sirens wailed the length
and breadth of Israel yesterday as the 3.5 million
living paid tribute to the 10,000 dead.
Yom Ha Zicharon, the Day of Remembrance, was
observed in synagogues and military cemeteries — a
nation still besieged paying tribute to the dead of five
wars.
But at sunset the mood changed, celebration re
placed mourning and the 32nd anniversary of na
tional independence was heralded by dancing in the
streets.
"Peace is far away," Defense Minister Ezer Weiz
man told thousands gathered at the military cemetery
at Mount Herzl, overlooking Jerusalem. "We are
reminded of that by the criminal attack on Misgav
Am."
