Stressing Stanford graduate students' need for "an um
brella organization" that can meet their specific needs.
Graduate Student Association (GSA) representative Sibby
Freeman discussed the new $12,000 tee assessment his
group will receive next year on KZSU's Campus Confer
ence Thursday night.
In terms of specific plans for next year. Freeman said the
GSA's major goal will not be to introduce new activities,
but simply to strengthen its existing program.
Freeman noted that most undergraduates live on campus
and are able to plan social and academic activities through
their residences. Graduate students, however, do not have
this opportunity as only 19 percent of the single graduate
student population is housed on campus, he said.
While the most important part of the undergraduate's lite
is his residence, graduates develop most of their ties within
their specific academic department. The GSA is needed,
according to Freeman, to provide activities that will involve
more graduate students in activities ranging from large
outdoor parties and sherry hours with professors to a
graduate orientation program.

Freeman justified the graduate student assessment, par
tially funded by undergraduates, by asserting that 50 to 80
percent of all fee assessments usually support under
graduate activities. He also explained that, while under
graduates-can assess themselves through dorm social dues,
graduate students have no similar option of self-assessment.
The fee assessment was seen as "the best mechanism
possible" for the GSA to obtain the desired funds.
The GSA fee assessment passed by a vote of 1374-1178,
making it one of the least supported assessments on this
quarter's ballot. Freeman, however, said that this did not
show a real lack of support from students. He observed that
normally 70 percent of the voters in elections are under
graduates who would be expected to act in "their own
self-interest" and choose not to support the assessment.
When questioned about graduate voter apathy, Freeman
contended that graduates are under a lot of academic pres
sure and often do not find the time to vote. Graduates also
do not feel the same attachment and involvement with
University elections that undergraduates do. Many feel the
graduate experience should be "an intensely academic
period," where there is no room for extra-curricular in
volvement, he said.
