# Status of hostage's parents is uncertain

### 
From the Daily wire services
A spokesman for Iranian militants
holding 50 Americans at the U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran said yesterday they
would not allow relatives of the hos
tages to visit the captives unless Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini asks them to.
But ABC News reported the milit
ants said Barbara Timm of Oak Creek,
Wis., could visit her hostage son.
Marine Sgt. Kenneth Hermening, 20, if
she received written permission from
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and
Foreigh Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh.
It said their permission "was secured
immediately" and"the way is now
clear for Mrs. Timm ... to see her son.
It is not clear how soon that will be."
The spokesman for the embassy
militants had said they had decided not
to allow families of the hostages to visit
the embassy but might reconsider that
decision if Khomeini asked.
Ghotbzadeh told a Tehran news confer
ence that Khomeini favored visits by
the hostages' "immediate families" but
did not say if the revolutionary leader
planned to force the issue.
Mrs. Timm arrived in Tehran Satur
day hoping tosee her son. The hostages
yesterday began their 24th week as
prisoners in the embassy. Three other
Americans have been held at the
Foreign Ministry since the militants
captured the embassy Nov. 4 demand
ing the return of ousted Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi.
The principle of allowing families to
visit their captive relatives was publicly
supported again yesterday by

Ghotbzadeh. He said that the militants
would be acting like jailers under the
government of the deposed shah if they
refused to let relatives see the hostages.
Ghotbzadeh said he personally be
lieved that not only the Timms. but the
families of other hostages, should be
allowed into the occupied embassy "as
a humanitarian gesture."
On Friday Bani-Sadr also expressed
support for such meetings, but the
militants apparently have not been
swayed.
In his news conference yesterday
Ghotbzadeh said he had made an un
announced "private visit" to Paris dur
ing the past few days to pick up some
documents and "seek some friends in
volved in the extradition of the shah."
He said there had been no contact with
any American officials or inter
mediaries, and that there were cur
rently "no negotiations under way" on
resolving the hostage crisis.
Ghotbzadeh called the new Ameri
can sanctions against Iran "extremely
hostile." He added, "We don't see this
as helpful to a resolution of the prob
lem in a peaceful manner."
Ghotbzadeh denied a report by Pres
ident Carter on Friday that Iran plan
ned to hold the hostages through U.S.
presidential elections in November. He
reiterated that an Iranian parliament,
not expected to convene until this
summer, would decide the fate of the
hostages. The second round parliamen
tary balloting was postponed for a
week until May 9, pending an investi
gation of fraud allegations from the
first round on March 14.
Carter, who has severed commercial
and diplomatic ties with Iran, appeared
to win support in his bid for America's
European and Japanese allies to follow
suit. Foreign ministers of the nine
nation European Economic Commun
ity and Japan meet today in
Luxembourg and one agenda topic is
Carter's request.
In a separate news conference Oil
Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar warned
that if the Japanese did not renew let
ters of credit to buy Iranian oil at a
newly raised price of $35 a barrel, sales
of 530,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil
to Japan would be stopped as of today.
Japanese off icials here said that the
oil dispute was more a question of the
new Iranian price increase of $2.50 a
barrel imposed April 1 than of
Japanese adherence to U.S. sanctions.
Japanese companies reportedly have
not bought Iranian oil at the new price
since it was declared. Representatives
of a dozen of the firms currently are in
Tehran to try to negotiate a return to
the old price.
Negotiators for two other major cus
tomers, British Petroleum and Shell,


Richard Falk
also have refused to pay the new higher
price but have been unsuccessful so far
in efforts to pare it back down.
Moinfar told reporters that if this
situation continued, Iran would keep
its oil in the ground and find better
customers later. He said that Iran was
discussing oil sales to Eastern Euro
pean countries and mentioned that
Bulgaria was interested in buying this
country's crude.
Moinfar also said that Iran was cur
rently discussing a deal with the Soviet
Union to trade Iranian gas for military
equipment and spare parts.
In another sign of a drift toward

closer relations with the Soviet Union
despite the ideological gulf between
the two countries, Maj. Gen Hadi
Shadmehr, the chief of the Iranian
military joint staffs, confirmed a "con
siderable increase in Soviet military
maneuvers" but said they were con
fined to the Soviet side of its border
with Iran.
"It might be correct that these man
euvers are not without reason, but they
are not with the thought of committing
aggression aginst Iran," Shadmehr
said. "They are for the event of another
force coming to Iran to act."

clear for Mrs. Timm ... to see her son.
It is not clear how soon that will be."
The spokesman for the embassy
militants had said they had decided not
to allow families of the hostages to visit
the embassy but might reconsider that
decision if Khomeini asked.
Ghotbzadeh told a Tehran news confer
ence that Khomeini favored visits by
the hostages' "immediate families" but
did not say if the revolutionary leader
planned to force the issue.
Mrs. Timm arrived in Tehran Satur
day hoping tosee her son. The hostages
yesterday began their 24th week as
prisoners in the embassy. Three other
Americans have been held at the
Foreign Ministry since the militants
captured the embassy Nov. 4 demand
ing the return of ousted Shah Moham
mad Reza Pahlavi.
The principle of allowing families to
visit their captive relatives was publicly
supported again yesterday by

Ghotbzadeh. He said that the militants
would be acting like jailers under the
government of the deposed shah if they
refused to let relatives see the hostages.
Ghotbzadeh said he personally be
lieved that not only the Timms. but the
families of other hostages, should be
allowed into the occupied embassy "as
a humanitarian gesture."
On Friday Bani-Sadr also expressed
support for such meetings, but the
militants apparently have not been
swayed.
In his news conference yesterday
Ghotbzadeh said he had made an un
announced "private visit" to Paris dur
ing the past few days to pick up some
documents and "seek some friends in
volved in the extradition of the shah."
He said there had been no contact with
any American officials or inter
mediaries, and that there were cur
rently "no negotiations under way" on
resolving the hostage crisis.
Ghotbzadeh called the new Ameri
can sanctions against Iran "extremely
hostile." He added, "We don't see this
as helpful to a resolution of the prob
lem in a peaceful manner."
Ghotbzadeh denied a report by Pres
ident Carter on Friday that Iran plan
ned to hold the hostages through U.S.
presidential elections in November. He
reiterated that an Iranian parliament,
not expected to convene until this
summer, would decide the fate of the
hostages. The second round parliamen
tary balloting was postponed for a
week until May 9, pending an investi
gation of fraud allegations from the
first round on March 14.
Carter, who has severed commercial
and diplomatic ties with Iran, appeared
to win support in his bid for America's
European and Japanese allies to follow
suit. Foreign ministers of the nine
nation European Economic Commun
ity and Japan meet today in
Luxembourg and one agenda topic is
Carter's request.
In a separate news conference Oil
Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar warned
that if the Japanese did not renew let
ters of credit to buy Iranian oil at a
newly raised price of $35 a barrel, sales
of 530,000 barrels a day of Iranian oil
to Japan would be stopped as of today.
Japanese off icials here said that the
oil dispute was more a question of the
new Iranian price increase of $2.50 a
barrel imposed April 1 than of
Japanese adherence to U.S. sanctions.
Japanese companies reportedly have
not bought Iranian oil at the new price
since it was declared. Representatives
of a dozen of the firms currently are in
Tehran to try to negotiate a return to
the old price.
Negotiators for two other major cus
tomers, British Petroleum and Shell,


Richard Falk
also have refused to pay the new higher
price but have been unsuccessful so far
in efforts to pare it back down.
Moinfar told reporters that if this
situation continued, Iran would keep
its oil in the ground and find better
customers later. He said that Iran was
discussing oil sales to Eastern Euro
pean countries and mentioned that
Bulgaria was interested in buying this
country's crude.
Moinfar also said that Iran was cur
rently discussing a deal with the Soviet
Union to trade Iranian gas for military
equipment and spare parts.
In another sign of a drift toward

closer relations with the Soviet Union
despite the ideological gulf between
the two countries, Maj. Gen Hadi
Shadmehr, the chief of the Iranian
military joint staffs, confirmed a "con
siderable increase in Soviet military
maneuvers" but said they were con
fined to the Soviet side of its border
with Iran.
"It might be correct that these man
euvers are not without reason, but they
are not with the thought of committing
aggression aginst Iran," Shadmehr
said. "They are for the event of another
force coming to Iran to act."
From the Daily wire services
A spokesman for Iranian militants
holding 50 Americans at the U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran said yesterday they
would not allow relatives of the hos
tages to visit the captives unless Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini asks them to.
But ABC News reported the milit
ants said Barbara Timm of Oak Creek,
Wis., could visit her hostage son.
