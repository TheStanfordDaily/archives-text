# Israeli says week 'not constructive'
## Palestinian Awareness Week questioned

When coordinators of Palestinian Awareness
Week asked members of the Jewish community to
participate in last week's event, they were inviting a
dialogue between conflicting Israeli/Palestinian fac
tions.
Whether or not that purpose was achieved is de
batable. Israeli student Gadi Kreeger termed the
week "not constructive" and claimed that propo
nents of the Palestinian cause offered solutions that
were unrealistic. On the other hand, Barry Bakin,
one of the event's coordinators, assessed the week as
successful.

Bakin countered that "If we brought together one
Palestinian and one Israeli who were able to discuss
some of the issues, while not resolving the conflict,
and were able to feel positive about their personal
involvement, then we were successful."
In response to claims that the week presented a
biased, anti-Israel position, Bakin said that he feels
that there is no way to cover the subject in a way that
pleases everyone.
He said that the lectures and film that were shown
did not represent the political positions of the coor
dinators of Palestinian Awareness Week, but were
intended to be used as "tools to raise the issues and
create a basis for discussion."
Bakin said that the coordinators — Sarah A 1 Fadl,
John and Nava Rosenblum and himself — "all have
different political views" but were all united by "a
common desire to resolve the conflict" and a belief
that the Palestinian issue had not received the atten
tion it deserved.
Bakin said he felt that the event failed "in that we
didn't reassure the Israelis that they didn't have to be
defensive, and because of that they were not able to

fully take advantage of the event. We had hoped to
involve a lot more people."
Bakin admitted that the organizers made a mistake
by failing to identify the makers of the week's fea
tured film. To Live In Freedom, which Kregger de
scribed as "Palestinian propaganda, formed by an
extreme leftist faction whose purpose is to destroy the
structure of Israel."
"I could never agree with everything that was said,
although I agree with a lot of it. The purpose of the
week's events was to show people the different as
pects of Palestinian heritage that people hadn't heard
about," said Bakin.
The failure of the coordinators of the event to
clearly state that the political views presented in the
film and lectures, biased or not. were not being pro
moted through the event and, therefore, were not to
be interpreted as threatening to the state of Israel,
contributed to feelings of misapprehension by some
Jewish participants. Bakin conceded that "We should
have been more careful about the initial presenta
tion," but maintained that "Our initial goal was the
Palestinians and the need to present their side."
