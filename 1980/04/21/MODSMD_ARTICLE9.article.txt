## Stability only an illusion Violence catches up with Liberia

NAIROBI, Kenya —
Everyone said it couldn't happen
in Liberia, a country that had
known peace and stability for
more than a century.
Liberia, the oldest republic in
black Africa, seemed an island of
calm on a continent torn by vio
lence. The coups and political as
sassinations in nearby countries
might have been part of another
world.
"We can take pride," Presi
dent William Tolbert said in
1971," in the fact that this nation
stands today unified as a true
example of stability."
A week ago, the turbulence
common in much of the rest of
Africa caught up with Liberia.
Before dawn April 12, a band of
noncommissioned officers
barged into the presidential
palace in Monrovia, the capital
of the West African nation, fired

three bullets into Tolbert's head
and declared themselves the new
guardians of Liberia.
It was the 45th successful coup
in Africa's roughly 20 years of
independence and once again
underscored an unhappy axiom:
political stability is largely an il
lusion in black Africa, where al
most any government can be
overthrown as quickly and as
easily as was Tolbert's.
Accused of corruption
The master sergeant who led
the Liberian coup, Samuel Doe,
accused Tolbert of corruption,
nepotism and economic mis
management and said some
members of his former govern
ment would go on trial. The
charges were enough to throw
shivers down the spines of presi
dents across the African conti
nent.
Many African presidents, like
Tolbert, who was a wealthy rub
ber baron when he became head
of state in 1971, have used their
offices to build or jncrease per
sonal fortunes. They have sur
rounded themselves with rela
tives or fellow tribesmen, and
many have presided over an ero
sion in the living standards of
their people. But few have the
credentials that Tolbert did.
An ordained elder, Tolbert in
1965 became the first black man
to be elected president of the
Baptist World Alliance. As
Liberia's leader, his record on
human rights was among the
more admirable in Africa and he
strove to build what he called a
"wholesome functioning soci
ety." Last July, he was elected
chairman of the Organization of
African Unity.
Progressive instincts
Those progressive instincts
were of little help to Tolbert last
weekend.
"The sad truth seems to be
that the only way Africa knows
how to bring about change is still
through the barrel of the gun," a
Western diplomat said. "No
thing has really changed in 20
years — except that 20 years ago
I can't imagine a bunch of army
sergeants bumping the chairman
of the OAU."
Tolbert's fatal shortcoming —

shared by some other African
presidents — was that he had
closed the safety valves for op
position. There was no free
press, no open forum, no honest
elections in which dissent could
be expressed.
Ironically, however, the 66-
year-old Tolbert had embarked
on a program of reform, bringing
more indigenous Liberians into
the government at the expense of
the descendants of the 45.000
freed American slaves who
founded the country in 1547.
Free education
He had recently advocated
free university education and a
constitutional amendment limit
ing presidents to one eight-year
term, and he indicated that he
was willing to allow more politi
cal expression.
But the changes were too lit
tle, too late, and proved just
enough to enable anti
government groups to agitate for
more reforms. Diplomats here
see the coup as a result of
economic and social strains unre
lated to the strong U.S. influence
in Liberia. They said there is no
immediate reason to believe that
the new Monrovia government
will want to alter its close rela
tionship with the United States.
In the week since the coup, all
ot Liberia's seaports and airports
have been reopened and the new

cabinet held its first meeting in
an apparent move toward restor
ing normalcy to the country.
All merchants, from members
of the Chamber of Commerce to
Monrovia's formidable "market
women," were summoned to the
Trade Ministry, which an
nounced a price freeze until
further notice on all merchan
dise, whether imported or locally
manufactured. The Finance
Ministry said all legitimate obli
gations previously incurred
would be honored by the new
government, including foreign
contracts.
The radio reported that new
head of state Master Sgt. Samuel
Doe had ordered the release of
259 people jailed without trial by
the Tolbert regime for petty
crimes, while five people caught
looting on Tuesday had been ar
rested, officials said.
Doe, inspecting troops, said
Liberia's Independence Day
would be celebrated henceforth
on April 1 2, the day of the coup,
and no longer on July 26, the
date of the founding of the re
public in 1847.
He said the July anniversary
was "a day when the Liberian
people became prisoners on
their own soil. After many years
of suffering and patience, they
were finally redeemed on April
12, 1980."
