### William Branigin The Washington Post 
TEHRAN â€” The U.S. Embassy's
youngest hostage had an emotional
reunion with his mother yesterday
when the militant Moslem captors
holding him and 49 other Americans
agreed for the first time to let a relative
of a captive into the occupied embassy.
Barbara Timm said after a 45-
minute meeting with her son. Marine
Sgt. Kevin Hermening, 20, that she
would go back to the United States to
work for a "peaceful settlement" of the
hostage crisis by pushing for congres
sional hearings on past U.S. involve
ment in Iran.
Officials in Washington said they
planned no legal action against the
Timms, although President Jimmy Car
ter has barred Americans who are not
journalists from traveling there. White
House press secretary Jody Powell and
State Department spokesman Hodding
Carter noted that the ban officially
goes into effect tomorrow. The
Timms "got in under the wire," Carter
said.
President Carter, on CBS, said of
Mrs. Timm. "My heart goes out to her.
I have no intention of punishing her."
Appearing composed and self
confident at a news conference after
returning from the embassy last night.
Timm said she found her son "in excel
lent health and very, very happy to see
me. He was surprised and overjoyed
that i had traveled across the globe to
be with him."
Iranian television
She said their meeting was filmed
throughout by an Iranian television
crew as several of the militants stood
by. She said the captors did not tell her
whether or when she would be able to
see her son again, and that there was no
indication whether other relatives ot
hostages would be allowed to make
similar visits.
Timm said she did not appeal to the

captors for Hermening's release or dis
cuss with them any prospective move
toward that end.
Timm, of Oak Creek, Wis., was
brought into the embassy through a
rear gate at about 3:15 p.m. alter three
of the Moslem captors took her and her
husband, Kenneth, to see the graves of
Iranians killed during the February
1979 revolution that deposed Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
A half-hour after the Timms arrived
at the embassy, Mrs. Timm and Her
mening, her son by a previous mar
riage, were brought together in a room
at the rear of the embassy compound
while Mr. Timm was led to another
room. Hermening was not informed
that his mother would be visiting until
20 minutes before the meeting.
Running battles
The Timms wete in the embassy
about six hours in all, Mrs. Timm said.
Elsewhere in Tehran leftist students
defied government orders to turn over
their campus sanctuaries to President
Abol Hassan Bani-Sadr's forces yes
terday and touched off running battles
with Moslem fundamentalists seeking
to break leftist influence at Tehran
University.
The clashes, the most serious in an
increasingly tense conflict in the capital
between left- and right-wing groups,
coincided with fighting on at least two
other college campuses in the southern
city of Shiraz and a fourth das of fight
ing in Kurdistan between government
forces and rebellious Kurdish guerril
las.
Rifle and automatic weapons fire re
sounded well past midnight at the
Tehran University campus as leftists
apparently held onto positions in de
fiance of an order from Bani-Sadr to
withdraw by last night or face expulsion
by the Iranian "masses."
There were conflicting casualty fi
gures from the clashes, and the results
