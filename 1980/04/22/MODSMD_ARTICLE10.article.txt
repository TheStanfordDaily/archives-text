## Schmidt invited to Moscow Moscow courting Bonn 
### Bradley Graham The Washington Post 
BONN — The Soviet Union's
political courting of West Ger
many has become more than a
mere mischievous flirtation with
the disclosure that Soviet Presi
dent Leonid Brezhnev has in
vited Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt to visit Moscow this
summer.
Moscow's wooing takes on the
appearance of a serious effort to
test West Germany's bonds to
the Western alliance and is sure
to heighten concern in
Washington about the faithful
ness of America's mightiest ally
in Europe.
If Schmidt accepts — and he is
known to want to — he will be
the first major Western leader to
see Brezhnev since the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan and could
deliver a clear, forceful message
from the Atlantic Alliance. But
the spectacle of Schmidt confer
ring with Brezhnev at this time
involves political risks for
Schmidt, both within the West
ern alliance, and at home al
though it is likely to have a
favorable impact on his cam
paign for re-election this fall.
Opinion is divided on how

Bonn has reacted to Moscow's
overtures. Some U.S. analysts
credit it with being realistic
about Soviet advances, neither
seeking nor expecting major
shifts in Soviet policy towards
the West. Others voice concern
at they regard as Bonn's ten
dency to be overly solicitous of
the Soviets.
Twice since the December in
vasion, Schmidt has told parlia
ment he was prepared to go to
Moscow. He is expected to delay
a decision on Brezhnev's offer,
which the Bonn government has
publicized, while he consults his
allies.
Trip a must
For Bonn, the trip is a must if
West Germany wishes to pre
serve its many ties with Eastern
Europe which were carefully
constructed during the past de
cade' by Schmidt's Social Demo
cratic Party.
But the visit would enable the
Soviets to tug further at already
strained policy differences bet
ween Bonn and Washington.
Moreover, the Soviets could use
the chancellor's visit to temper
the impact of the near certainty
that Bonn will boycott the Mos
cow Olympics.
Beyond these immediate aims,
the invitation appears to be part
of a larger Soviet strategy to cul
tivate closer ties with Bonn. Hav
ing peppered West Germany
with neo-Nazi and warmonger
ing epithets for most of the post
war period, Moscow several
years ago began to assess its de

veloping ties with Bonn in more
positive terms.
This more pleasant tone was
formalized by Brezhnev's 1978
visit to Bonn. During the visit,
long-term economic cooperation
agreements were signed.
Since then the Kremlin has
approved better transportation
and economic links between
West and East Germany. The
flow of ethnic German refugees
from Eastern Europe also con
tinues with Moscow's blessings.
At the last Brezhnev-Schmidt
meeting the invitation for the
chancellor to visit Moscow was
first tendered and was planned
for this year. But the Afghanis
tan invasion and the resulting
cooling of relations between the
Soviet Union and the West put
the visit in doubt.
Bonn leading
Moscow appeared to be
angered by Bonn's leading role
in December's NATO decision
to station medium-range nuclear
missiles in Europe.
The fact that Brezhnev has
now unexpectedly offered a
specific date for the visit this
soon is being taken here both as a
sign of Soviet interest in drawing
Bonn out as well as evidence of
Schmidt's success in striking a
somewhat independent foreign
policy from Washington.
Without a U.S. sanction, a
Schmidt-Brezhnev summit will
be open to attack by the opposi
tion Christian Democrats. So far,
no official public word has come
from Washington.
