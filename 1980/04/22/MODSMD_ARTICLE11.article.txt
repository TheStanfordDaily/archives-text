# U.S. takes political risks in Central America
## 
### Oswald Johnston Robert C. Toth The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — At the
same time that the crises in Iran
and Afghanistan have thrown
U.S. foreign policy onto the de
fensive in distant trouble spots,
the Carter administration has
quietly embarked on a high-risk
policy of calculated boldness in a
crisis area closer to home —
Central America.
In striking contrast to the in
decisive ebbs and flows of its
crisis management in the Middle
East, the administration has
committed itself to active sup
port of the unpopular junta in El
Salvador, hoping the junta can
prevail over Cuban-backed
Marxist guerrillas on the left and
reactionary terrorists on the ex
treme right.
Administration officials
acknowledge, however, that the
United States is not prepared to
back up its high-profile policy
with action that goes much
beyond the often-unorthodox
tactics of Robert White, its am
bassador in the Salvadoran capi
tal of San Salvador. And the pat

tern of violence and upheaval in
El Salvador is almost certain to
be repeated throughout Central
America, most U.S. analysts ag
ree.
In short, Latin American
specialists both inside and out
side the administration say. the
United States is making a sizable
investment of political capital in
a situation that is at'best risky
and promises less in the way of
return than it threatens in the
way of loss. If events in Central
America should begin to go seri
ously wrong, the administration
has little in reserve.
Liberal criticism
Official accounts of the policy,
which is criticized bv liberals for
its support of a military
dominated regime.and by con
servatives for its support of re
forms with a left-socialist colora
tion. remain guardedly optimis
tic.
With time. Latin American
specialists in the State Depart
ment say. the El Salvador junta
can survive, expand its base to
include moderates from left and
right, and avert civil war.
To succeed, the junta must do

two things, officials agree. It
must press ahead with its reform
program to attract political sup
port and take the wind out of
leftist sails. And it must lower the
level of violence by its own sec
urity forces. many of whom, iron
ically. become engaged in fire
fights with leftists while trying to
administer the land reform prog
ram.
Expropriation
The reforms involve sweeping
expropriation of all farms of
more than 1250 acres and
nationalization of 51 percent of
the banking industry so credit
can be made available to a wider
share of th.e population. To
gether. the reforms amount to a
program more enlightened than
anything being done in many of
the Latin American countries
that now stand aloof from the
junta, and the reforms are de
cidedly unpopular with sym
pathizers of the Salvadoran old
guard.
Nevertheless, far less sanguine
are those officials in the ad
ministration who are not in
volved in day-to-day manage
ment of the El Salvador policy

and are instead responsible for
overall assessments of the politi
cal future of Central America
and the Caribbean.
"At present, the junta has a
one-in-four chance to survive,"
is the brutal assessment of one
such analyst.
Civil war
It El Salvador does explode
into civil war, which all
specialists fear would be bloody
because of the long tradition of
political violence and class an
tagonism in that country, the
eventual victory will almost cer
tainly go the left — and to Cuba.
After the overthrow last sum
mer of Anastasio Somoza's
dynasty in Nicaragua, experts
say, a chain reaction has been set
in motion that no degree of con
servative tenacity can withstand
elsewhere in the region.
In each case, the falling
dominos can be counted as
"building blocks" fora Cuba still
determined to be an activist
power in the region.
"Every failure of a reformist
solution — such as the junta in El
Salvador — amounts to another
failure for U.S. policy and
another benefit for Cuba," one
typically pessimistic analyst con
cluded. "and another building
block in Central America: first
Nicaragua, now El Salvador,
then Honduras, Guatemala . . .
Even Costa Rica is not safe."
U.S. failures
Ultimately, a succession of
U.S. policy failures in Central
America, together with the spec
tacle of Cuba running unchecked
through the Caribbean, can only
damage U.S. interests in Latin
America as a whole, area
specialists warn.
How the administration cont
rived to enmesh itself in such a
predicament is in some ways a
textbook example of how the
foreign policy preconceptions
Jimmy Carter brought with him
into the White House prove
themselves in the real world.
The old-line American policy
toward the hemisphere, typified
in the eyes of idealistic Carter
officials by U.S. "meddling" in
Chile during the Nixon era. has
generally come to be charac
terized as blind support of
right-wing dictators in the name
of anti-Communism.

Add to that the administra
tion's declared intention to make
human rights a positive force in
U.S. policy, particularly toward
nations in Latin America once
counted as friendly to
Washington, and the old policy
becomes recast as its exact oppo
site: blind opposition to right
wing dictators in the name of
human rights.
The Nicaraguan revolution
posed the issue in almost its
pu rest form. Somoza's dynasty in
the past had been virtually an
American puppet; that, in the
new administration's view, was
reason enough for Somoza to be
dropped.
When the neighboring coun
tries of Panama and Costa Rica
were joined by the prestigious
Andean Pact nations (Ven
ezuela, Colombia, Bolivia,
Ecuador and Peru) in organized
opposition to the dictator and
when the whole Nicaraguan
populace rose up against him.
the new era in Central American
history was begun.
Fall in
By its own logic, therefore, the
Carter administration had no
choice but to fall in with the call
for Somoza's overthrow, even
though it by no means was clear
to policymakers as late as last
spring who would replace him.
A desperate attempt was
launched to assemble a moder
ate, reformist, centrist alterna
tive to the avowedly leftist San
dinistas who hud seized the in
itiative against Somoza.
Fluid situation
The administration still sticks
to the position that the situation
in Nicaragua is "fluid," and that
the United States should contri
bute aid'and political support so
the Sandinistas will not be
pushed all the way into the
Cuban-Soviet camp. But that
position gradually is being over
taken by events.
Skeptics within the foreign
policv establishment regard the
new policy of political interven
tionism exemplified by Ambas
sador White's high-profile com
mitment to the Salvadoran junta
as not much more than the flip
side of the old coin: once it was
intervention in support of dic
tators, now it is in support of
their replacements.

After the overthrow last sum

say, a chain reaction has been set

"Every failure of a reformist
solution — such as the junta in El

failure for U.S. policy and
another benefit for Cuba," one
typically pessimistic analyst con
cluded. "and another building
block in Central America: first
Nicaragua, now El Salvador,
then Honduras, Guatemala . . .
Even Costa Rica is not safe."
U.S. failures
Ultimately, a succession of
U.S. policy failures in Central
America, together with the spec
tacle of Cuba running unchecked
through the Caribbean, can only
damage U.S. interests in Latin
America as a whole, area
specialists warn.
How the administration cont
rived to enmesh itself in such a
predicament is in some ways a
textbook example of how the
foreign policy preconceptions
Jimmy Carter brought with him
into the White House prove
themselves in the real world.
The old-line American policy
toward the hemisphere, typified
in the eyes of idealistic Carter
officials by U.S. "meddling" in
Chile during the Nixon era. has
generally come to be charac
terized as blind support of
right-wing dictators in the name
of anti-Communism.

Add to that the administra
tion's declared intention to make
human rights a positive force in
U.S. policy, particularly toward
nations in Latin America once
counted as friendly to
Washington, and the old policy
becomes recast as its exact oppo
site: blind opposition to right
wing dictators in the name of
human rights.
The Nicaraguan revolution
posed the issue in almost its
pu rest form. Somoza's dynasty in
the past had been virtually an
American puppet; that, in the
new administration's view, was
reason enough for Somoza to be
dropped.
When the neighboring coun
tries of Panama and Costa Rica
were joined by the prestigious
Andean Pact nations (Ven
ezuela, Colombia, Bolivia,
Ecuador and Peru) in organized
opposition to the dictator and
when the whole Nicaraguan
populace rose up against him.
the new era in Central American
history was begun.
Fall in
By its own logic, therefore, the
Carter administration had no
choice but to fall in with the call
for Somoza's overthrow, even
though it by no means was clear
to policymakers as late as last
spring who would replace him.
A desperate attempt was
launched to assemble a moder
ate, reformist, centrist alterna
tive to the avowedly leftist San
dinistas who hud seized the in
itiative against Somoza.
Fluid situation
The administration still sticks
to the position that the situation
in Nicaragua is "fluid," and that
the United States should contri
bute aid'and political support so
the Sandinistas will not be
pushed all the way into the
Cuban-Soviet camp. But that
position gradually is being over
taken by events.
Skeptics within the foreign
policv establishment regard the
new policy of political interven
tionism exemplified by Ambas
sador White's high-profile com
mitment to the Salvadoran junta
as not much more than the flip
side of the old coin: once it was
intervention in support of dic
tators, now it is in support of
their replacements.
WASHINGTON — At the
same time that the crises in Iran
and Afghanistan have thrown
U.S. foreign policy onto the de
fensive in distant trouble spots,
the Carter administration has
quietly embarked on a high-risk
policy of calculated boldness in a
crisis area closer to home —
Central America.
In striking contrast to the in
decisive ebbs and flows of its
crisis management in the Middle
East, the administration has
committed itself to active sup
port of the unpopular junta in El
Salvador, hoping the junta can
prevail over Cuban-backed
Marxist guerrillas on the left and
reactionary terrorists on the ex
treme right.
Administration officials
acknowledge, however, that the
United States is not prepared to
back up its high-profile policy
with action that goes much
beyond the often-unorthodox
tactics of Robert White, its am
bassador in the Salvadoran capi
tal of San Salvador. And the pat

tern of violence and upheaval in
El Salvador is almost certain to
be repeated throughout Central
America, most U.S. analysts ag
ree.
In short, Latin American
specialists both inside and out
side the administration say. the
United States is making a sizable
investment of political capital in
a situation that is at'best risky
and promises less in the way of
return than it threatens in the
way of loss. If events in Central
America should begin to go seri
ously wrong, the administration
has little in reserve.
Liberal criticism
Official accounts of the policy,
which is criticized bv liberals for
its support of a military
dominated regime.and by con
servatives for its support of re
forms with a left-socialist colora
tion. remain guardedly optimis
tic.
With time. Latin American
specialists in the State Depart
ment say. the El Salvador junta
can survive, expand its base to
include moderates from left and
right, and avert civil war.
To succeed, the junta must do

two things, officials agree. It
must press ahead with its reform
program to attract political sup
port and take the wind out of
leftist sails. And it must lower the
level of violence by its own sec
urity forces. many of whom, iron
ically. become engaged in fire
fights with leftists while trying to
administer the land reform prog
ram.
Expropriation
The reforms involve sweeping
expropriation of all farms of
more than 1250 acres and
nationalization of 51 percent of
the banking industry so credit
can be made available to a wider
share of th.e population. To
gether. the reforms amount to a
program more enlightened than
anything being done in many of
the Latin American countries
that now stand aloof from the
junta, and the reforms are de
cidedly unpopular with sym
pathizers of the Salvadoran old
guard.
Nevertheless, far less sanguine
are those officials in the ad
ministration who are not in
volved in day-to-day manage
ment of the El Salvador policy

and are instead responsible for
overall assessments of the politi
cal future of Central America
and the Caribbean.
"At present, the junta has a
one-in-four chance to survive,"
is the brutal assessment of one
such analyst.
Civil war
It El Salvador does explode
into civil war, which all
specialists fear would be bloody
because of the long tradition of
political violence and class an
tagonism in that country, the
eventual victory will almost cer
tainly go the left — and to Cuba.
