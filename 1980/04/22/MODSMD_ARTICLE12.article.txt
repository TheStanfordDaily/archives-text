# Chinese wall posters banned
## Free speech threatened 
### William Sexton Newsday 
PEKING — The foreman at work was under
standing, Wang Zhangshen said, hut very firm.
This would have to he Wang's final wall poster.
And if any douht remained that China's new
attitude toward dissidence was officially
sanctioned, the standing committee of the National
Peoples Congress adopted a constitutional
amendment last week removing the wall poster
right.
The change is subject to ratification by the full
congress in August, but the experience of Wang —
a pseudonym — seemed to confirm other evidence
of retreat from the general flowering of expression
since Senior Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping's rise to
power three years ago:
—A play that criticized the privileged status of
Communist Party functionaries was taken off the
stage in Shanghai, and another play that ques
tioned the operation of the courts was subjected to
rewriting in Xian, the main city of northwestern
China.
-People's Daily, the party organ, was officially,
though privately, criticized for overemphasizing

investigative reporting, according to an authorita
tive source — resulting in a much blander mix of
news and sermonizing, and daily sellouts of the
much spicier Peking Evening News.
But "crackdown" seems much too strong a word
for the new situation — so far. at least.
Wang, for instance, felt free to talk to a foreign
correspondent about the apparent end of the pub
lic activities of China April sth — which takes its
name from the date of mass demonstrations in
1976 protesting Deng's ouster by "The Gang of
Four." Wang ran into the reporter outside Mao
Tse-tung's mausoleum, which had just been
reopened tor public viewing. The dissident was one
ot 1 6 workers at a radio factory given tickets to the
mausoleum as a reward for good work.
Moreover, the young authors of the Shanghai
play. // / Were a Real Son — it concerns a youth
who. to get theater tickets. pretended|fiis father
was a party official — were able to take their work
on tour, informally, to two other cities despite the
heavy criticism that descended on them in Shan
ghai.
What appears to be happening is a phrase much
heard in ( hina these days: tiao zhen. or readjust
ment.
