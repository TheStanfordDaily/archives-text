# Japan seeks oil after Iran cutoff
## 
### William Chapman The Washington Post 
TOKYO â€” With its Ira
nian oil supplies being choked
oil . Japan yesterday began
groping for other oil sources
and was considering asking
the United States for help.
Angry that Japan won't go
along with a price increase,
Iran's national oil company
shut off supplies to one major
Japanese importer and was
reported preparing to cut off
the others.
Japan became the second
country, after Portugal, to be
punished with an Iranian oil
cutoff after acting in part in
support of American efforts
to pressure Iran to release
U.S. Embassy hostages in
Tehran.
Even before confirmation
of the cutoff reached Tokyo
last night, chief cabinet sec
retary Masayoshi Ito said
Japan would possibly ask
major American oil com
panies to sell more oil here.
The government repor
tedly also was preparing to
ask the International Energy
Agency for emergency assis
tance.
At the government's insis
tence. Japanese importers
last week rejected a National
Iranian Oil Co. demand for a
$2.50 per barrel price in
crease, and Iran promptly
threatened to stop selling to
Japan after Sunday.
The price increase was re
fused primarily for economic
reasons, because it is out of
line with world prices, the
government said. But in exp
laining the refusal, officials
also said it was in keeping
with a four-month-old com
mitment to support the Un
ited States in the hostage

crisis by refusing to pay high
prices for Iranian oil.
Over the weekend Iranian
011 Minister Aii Akbar Moin
far reiterated the govern
ment's refusal to continue sel
ling oil to Japan at existing
prices and was reported to
have complained that Japan
had bowed to American pres
sures.
Although the cutoff puts
pressure on Japan to find
other sources, it also forces
Iran to seek other customers,
and Moinfar reportedly was
negotiating with East Euro
pean countries.
Japan buys between 1 0 and
12 percent of its total oil im
ports from Iran. Officials ex
pressed optimism that the
shortage would cause no
short-term problems but said
they were concerned about
long-term dangers.
Ito told reporters Japan
would first meet the problem
by new oil-conservation mea
sured, and bv tapping stored
reserves that are sufficient to
last 95 days if all imports from
other countries ceased.
In the past Japan has
suggested that the United
States help by diverting part
of the oil from Alaska that is
now sold in the American
market. Ambassador Mike
Mansfield has endorsed the
proposal, but such a move
would probably require spe
cial legislation by Congress.
Mansfield yesterday
thanked Prime Minister
Masayoshi Ohira for Japan's
support and, according to
Japanese newspapers, said it
was "more advanced" sup
port than that from other
countries whose help had
been sought in the hostage
crisis.
