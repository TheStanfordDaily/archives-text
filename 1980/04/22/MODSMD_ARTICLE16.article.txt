# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Raab/Swaim Make energy commitment 
### 
Wc arc a group of students united in our concern
for the world's energy future. We believe that the
utilization of conservation, renewable energy
sources and recycling provide the only long-term
solution to today's energy problems.
Although we realize that the University cannot
solve the world's energy problems by itself, we
believe that energy solutions must be simultane
ously implemented on local, state, national and
international levels. For the time being. Stanford is
our home, and we would like to see it make a
stronger commitment to conservation, solar energy
and recycling.
We are aware that the University has already
taken some important steps in this direction. The
ASSU Recycling Center, the Conservation Center,
the passive conservation measures in Terman En
gineering Building, and the few solar hot water
installations on our buildings are an excellent start.
With your help, we want to make sure that the
University continues on its way to becoming a
comprehensive model of energy efficiency and
creativity over the coming years.
Below are some of the ideas that should be pur
sued here. We feel that it is not only in the jurisdic
tion of the University, but it is also its responsibility
to work toward the implementation of these pro
posals. We. as students, are ready to participate in
this process and would like to meet with University
officials to discuss our ideas and hear what the
University is planning along these lines:
— All new construction at the University should
be as energy efficient as possible. Both passi\e
space heating and active solar hot-water heating
should be incorporated into every design at the
beginning of the design process.
— The new dormitory at Lake Lagunita. the new
music building and even the proposed motel in
Menlo Park should all adhere to the abo\e.
— A study should be made on the potential for

retrofitting all dormitories, buildings and swim
ming pools with a solar energy system.
— Solar energy devices and conservation mea
sures should be exempted from the University's
(present) payback policy. We feel that a life-cycle
cost analysis is more fair and will show the
economics of solar today.
— The program at the Conservation Center
should be expanded to include the suggestions
which have already been submitted to Ed Scoles
(Housing and Services) by the conservation staff.
— The program at the Recycling Center should
be supported and expanded to provide a more
comprehensive coverage of offices and homes on
campus.
— Scholastic and research opportunities in con
servation. solar energy and recycling here should
be expanded. Students have overwhelmingly
shown their support for classes of this type in the
past.
— Investigation should be made into other con
servation measures for campus buildings. Installing
timers for lights, removing unnecessary internal
lights, closing curtains at night and regulating heat
ing and cooling thermostats are only a few sugges
tions.
— University purchase specifications should in
clude the use of recycled paper products wherever
possible.
— Cars as a means of transportation should con
tinue to be discouraged while promoting bicycles
and public transit.
— An energy advisory board should be formed,
composed of concerned students, faculty and ad
ministration to guide Stanford's energy future in an
intelligent and comprehensive manner.
