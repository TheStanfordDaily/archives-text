## Secretary's Day not enough 
### 
Bouquets are pretty, but we
cannot flourish on flowers. A
better way to celebrate the up
coming National Secretary's
Week, which should include all
office staff, would be to give the
employees a half day off. And.
instead of flowers, a bag of
groceries including, for example,
a fine cheese or a bottle of good
wine, would probably be ap
preciated.
What about the male office
workers? I wonder what they
traditionally receive from their
bosses — a fine cigar? It's really
time we got away from the tradi
tional stereotypes for de
monstrating appreciation to the
clerical staff.
For those who wonder what
I'm jawing about, tomorrow is
National Secretary's Day.
Hot)rah. Hoorah. What this
means is the following: after a
year of devoted labor and loy
alty. on substandard wages in a
time of inflation: after a year of
playing the roles of servant, er
rand boy (or girl), efficient
machine, drudge, diplomat,
psychologist, and hostess (or
host) — the clerical workers of
the country receive one token
day of recognition.
That is. those bosses who pay
attention to and know about this
"special day" award their sec
retaries (and perhaps a few other
other "luckv" clericals) a
bouquet of flowers or take them
out to lunch. For this once-a
year kindness, the secretary pro

fusely thanks his or her boss and
demonstrates the expected ap
preciation for this noble instance
of generosity. It's a mutual strok
ing. The employer has fulfilled
his or her quota of giv ing for the
year and is duly thanked. Some
thing like giving to the United
Fund. The rest of the year, it's
business as usual.
Unfortunately, business as
usual is rather unsatisfying for
many office staff. Let's face it:
bosses are just like anyone else
— they vary. Some are consis
tently considerate and thought
ful to their staff: others are too
busy to notice them except to
say. "I want this. I want that —
and fast!" So some of us fare bet
ter than others during the year.
The point here is that flowers
or candy, or being taken out to
lunch once a year, is relatively
meaningless compared to the
ongoing situation. Many, many
clericals are quietly and desper
ately unhappy at their jobs, not
because they don't like office
work as such, but because of the
depressing circumstances of the
job.
These include lack of variety
of tasks leading to boredom, lack
of consideration from busy fa
culty and research staff leading
to anger and resentment, over
work and both mental and physi
cal strain from meeting constant
time pressures, lack of
decision-making, low wages
necessitating living on the mar
gin. and inability to make

changes in this situation because
there is no mechanism for input
from the employee. These are
probably the reasons why any
one who feels they have a choice
either leaves the profession or
never enters it. Thus, few men
are secretaries, for instance. I
can hardly blame them.
I like office work: it's the
above mentioned disadvantages
I can do without. I also like the
people I work for. They a re good
people caught in the same out
dated system I'm trapped in. and
they are forced to play the tradi
tional employer roles.
It is the system that needs to be
changed, and that can only hap
pen with employee input. Par
ticipation in the decisions that af
fect our lives is not only what a
democracy is supposed to be all
about, but also a virtual necessity
for improving the quality of our
lives and our attitudes toward
our jobs. 1 believe that "par
ticipatory democracy" will only
be possible when the employees
have organized themselves and
demand it.
Meanwhile, please think
beyond flowers when you reflect
on how to compensate your of
fice stall tor the low wages and
other frustrations they put up
with all year long. Try to de
monstrate as much patience and
courtesy to your staff throughout
the year as you expect from
them. And it wouldn't hurt to
work toward obtaining as high
wages as possible lor deserving
stall when evaluation time
comes around! These are actions
that count.
