## Why is our honor code unique? 
### 
If you've ever thought about Stanford's
Honor Code, you may have wondered about
its unique qualities. In fact, you might have
even asked why we have such a code when we
have had a Fundamental Standard in exis
tence since 1906.
The answer is simple. Whereas the Fun
damental Standard sets the general stan
dards of conduct for students in a wide spec
trum of situations, the Honor Code focuses
primarily on actions within the academic en
\ ironment.
Yet what makes our code special? An
examination of the honor systems at several
other major institutions will perhaps uncover
a few of the reasons.
The most notable and rigid honor systems
belong to the U.S. military academies. The
well-known pledge that a cadet "will not lie.
cheat, or steal nor tolerate those who do"
binds all those who go through either West
Point or Annapolis. Violations of this code
result in expulsion or "silencing," according
to the 1977 Honor Code pamphlet of the
U.S. Military Academy.
Surprisingly, one state institution, the
University of Virginia, has a similar honor
system governing social as well as academic
integrity. Lying, cheating or stealing results
in only one sanction — permanent dismissal
from the university. Of note is the interest
the University of Virginia takes in the finan

cial status of individual students. A "Bad
Check Commitee," specifically charged to
handle problems of "bounced" checks, helps
those who write them to balance their per
sonal bank accounts.
Harvard University, on the other hand,
has no honor code or honor system. Ilarvard
Dean of Student Affairs John Macquand
emphasized in a telephone interview that
Harvard does not require the participation of
its students in matters dealing with academic
integrity.
According to Macquand, such matters are
"satisfactorily" dealt with by Harvard's Ad
ministrative Board."Examinationsare proc
tored and. naturally, our system is working
well — there haven't been too many cases of
cheating recently,' he explained.
"The present system is working so well
that there has never been any initiative to
begin a student-run honor system."
Macquard continued, adding that he did not
foresee any move toward such an initiative in
the future.
Like Harvard, Cornell University does not
have an honor system per se. but it does have
a Code of Academic Integrity. While such
matters as plagiarism are covered under this
code, actions of the faculty are not addres
sed. and proctoring of exams is an accepted
practice, according to one staff person in the
Office of Student Affairs.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technol

ogy does not have an honor system. As one
student explained, "There is no need for an
honor code at the institute because competi
tion is so still that any form of cheating is
immediately reported. After all, one can't
allow some pseudo-nerd to pull up the
curve."
Finally, Princeton University's honor sys
tem is an example of a more traditional ap
proach. Final entrance into Princeton is con
tingent upon a personal letter to the Honor
Committee from the newly-admitted student
stating that lie or she understands and will
abide by the Honor System. Like Stanford,
examinations are not supervised and stu
dents at Princeton sign a pledge of honesty
on all exam books. In addition, third party
responsibility is also part of their honor sys
tem. although toleration of dishonesty may
not be as grave an offense as a direct honor
violation.
An overview of these different attitudes
about the organizations of honor systems
emphasizes an important aspect of Stan
ford's code: It is neither inflexibly rigid nor is
it merely an ambiguous element of the
bureaucracy. Initiated by students and ac
tively supported by the administration and
faculty, our Honor Code is effectively sus
tained by these collective efforts.
