# SLAC achieves breakthrough in PEP tests

### Cici Oremland Staff Writer 
Yesterday for the first time, Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center scientists circulated a high-energy
electron beam completely around the mile-and-a
half underground Positron-Electron Project ring.
"We are elated," said PEP Associate Director
John Rees. "This is the culmination of 3 V2 years of
construction. We've been trying for three weeks to
circulate an electron beam."
By circulating the electron beam, the scientists can
store it temporarily while they perform experiments.
Yesterday's test left PEP workers "absolutely jubil
ant." said Donald Getz. PEP assistant director.
SLAC director Wolfgang Panofsky was unavailable
for comment.
Hundreds of magnets weighing many tons each had
to be aligned within hundredths of an inch to achieve
the exceedingly precise electron beam.
PEP is designed to store circulating beams of elec-

trons and positrons that each contain up to IN billion
electron volts. The facilities' linear accelerator is the
source of these high energy particle beams.
Next week. SLAC scientists hope to begin sending
positron beams around the ring in the opposite direc
tion. "But first we must practice." Rees said. "It's a
learning process with the machine; it's extremely
complex."
By circulating the beams in opposite directions,
and causing them to collide, the scientists create an
infinitesimally small fireball of energy, hotter and
more densely concentrated than almost anything else
known in the universe.
The energy created instantly rematerializcs into
subnuclear particles that can be studied with elec
tronic detectors. With such particles, SLAC scientists
will be able to deepen their study of the fundamen
tal structure of matter.
"We are trying to find out how far it is possible to
break down the building blocks of matter, down to

the fundamental detail." said Getz.
The $7N million PEP ring, begun in 1 977, was built
as a joint venture of SLAC and the University of
California.
The ring is a larger version of a ring developed by
Stanford professor Burton Richter, who won a Nobel
Prize for Physics in 1976 for discoveries he made
using the apparatus.
"There is nothing earthshatteringly revolutionary
about the design (of the ring)," Getz said. "We'd be
surprised if it failed. We've had small problems with
the project, but none of our problems have been
fundamental; they just needed working out. For
example, until this month we were unable to store an
electron beam.''
Experiments with the particles will include use of
the 107 ton superconducting magnet shipped across
country last year. The magnet will be inserted into
one of the six interaction regions (where the beams
cross and collide) of the ring this fall.
