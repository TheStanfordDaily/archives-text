# Soviet invasion diverted oil criticism
## 
### 
If you were the Soviet ministerof
petroleum earlv in 1479. you
probably would have begun put
ting your resume in order. It cer
tainly wasn't your fault, but
domestic production of oil faced
dim prospects. With the Soviet
economy critically dependent on
oil for 45 percent of its energy
and for 40 percent of its export
earnings, there was little doubt
that changes in the petroleum
outlook foreshadowed changes
in Soviet foreign and domestic
policies.
What went wrong? One of
your first acts as minister had
been to persuade Brezhnev and
the Central Planning Committee
to institute a crash program of
re-allocating oil industry re
sources from the older Volga-
Urals fields to the West Siberia
region, the only region where
major output increases had been
obtained in recent years. As a
result, output was expected to
increase in that region from 5.08
million barrels per day (mb/d) in
1978 to 5.69 in 1979, up 12 per
cent.
But by 1979, the oil game was
"rigged"' against you. In recent
years, the central planners had

woefully ignored the industry's
needs to upgrade its exploration,
equipment and infrastructure.
As d result, oil output was highly
unlikely to meet both internal
needs and European export de
mands in the near future. Over
all. your comrades projected an
increase from 11.43 mb/d'in
1 978 to 11.86 in 1979, but your
ability to achieve even this mod
est increase was dubious. By the
mid-1980s, an actual decrease to
10 mb/d was quite plausible,
barely enough to supply domes
tic requirements.
In a recent phone call, a
member of the Communist
Politburo hinted that these dis
appointing energy developments
might soon play a role in Soviet
military affairs. Furthermore,
your job was at stake.
Over a couple of vodkas, you
reflected on the decisions that
had led to this situation. First,
the failure in recent years to con-!
duct adequate exploratory dril
ling had led to a dramatic fall in
your reserves-to-production
ratio, which meant that you were
depleting your resources much
faster than you were currently
replacing them.
The strategic decision to con

centrate on the enhanced de
velopment of already discovered
fields had proven disastrous,
since no significant fields had
been discovered in the past six
years. Meanwhile, production in
many Soviet fields had peaked
(particularly in Samotlar, the
massive field in West Siberia),
and it would take years to find
and develop new ones.
Second, the failure to train
enough crews and purchase
enough drilling equipment in the

past severely constrained the
prospects for increasing produc
tion in the present and near fu
ture. Thus, re-allocating de
velopment and production re
sources to West Siberia left the
older and offshore regions with
minimal facilities. In addition,
the Soviet turbo drills, left over
from the days when oil was easily
found, were wholly inapprop
riate for modern wells, typically
over 3000 meters underground.
Third, your comrades had
mismanaged the existing large
fields. In 1978, Bft percent of
Soviet oil was being produced by
water injection, a technique de
signed to increase geological
pressure and thus increase oil
flow. However, the fields had
been flooded to such an extent in
many areas that long term sus
tainable yields had been severely
sacrificed in order to meet
short-term production goals.
Fourth, the planners had
failed to install the railroads,
pipelines, roads and refineries
necessary to reliably develop and
transport any oil that your crude
geological techniques might lo
cate. In January 1979, for exam
ple, you were able to deliver only
1600 of the 4000 to 5000 rail
road cars of freight needed in
remote fields to construct the oil
called for in the 1980
plan. Drilling and pipeline goals
cannot possibly be met for the
next few years.
And as though all this were not
enough, the Western press had
begun to recognize these in
adequacies. Successive reports

by the CIA, the Joint Economic
Committee of the U.S. Congress,
the Oil and Gas Journal, for
tune, and the Wall Street Journal
were now broadcasting the
Soviet's technical and planning
failures throughout the capitalist
world. Damn the First Amend
ment!
Suppose now that you are a
member of the Politburo, the
political leadership. What's your
next move? You certainly want
to build up Soviet petroleum

capacity as quickly as possible,
but this process will take until the
late 1 980s to pay off, if it pays off
at all â€” so you begin to develop
plans for the interim period.
At the minimum, these plans
should promote worldwide
Communism, and in addition,
you'd like to put political and
military pressure on the major
oil-producing regions. Are such
opportunites available?
Indeed, the time is ripe in
mid-1979. The United States is
still immobilized by post-
Vietnam guilt, the world atten
tion is focused on OPEC prices,
so you take some bold actions.
You invade Afghanistan, and the
message to Iran is clear: Iranian
oil is in the Soviet sphere of in
terest.
You aid South Yemen militar
ily, as a possible stepping stone
to Saudi Arabia. Finally, you
support the government of Hon
duras and ferment unrest in
Nicaragua, with an eye toward
the rich oil resources of Mexico.
Perhaps you use foreign policy
ploys to divert attention from
your internal failures, alleviate
your petroleum dil?mma, and
garner geo-political advantage at
the same time. It's certainly
worth a try, since your inept
Minister of Petroleum can't
seem to meet the goals in the
plan. I hope he's got his resume
up to date.

What went wrong? One of
your first acts as minister had
been to persuade Brezhnev and
the Central Planning Committee
to institute a crash program of
re-allocating oil industry re
sources from the older Volga-
Urals fields to the West Siberia
region, the only region where
major output increases had been
obtained in recent years. As a
result, output was expected to
increase in that region from 5.08
million barrels per day (mb/d) in
1978 to 5.69 in 1979, up 12 per
cent.
But by 1979, the oil game was
"rigged"' against you. In recent
years, the central planners had

woefully ignored the industry's
needs to upgrade its exploration,
equipment and infrastructure.
As d result, oil output was highly
unlikely to meet both internal
needs and European export de
mands in the near future. Over
all. your comrades projected an
increase from 11.43 mb/d'in
1 978 to 11.86 in 1979, but your
ability to achieve even this mod
est increase was dubious. By the
mid-1980s, an actual decrease to
10 mb/d was quite plausible,
barely enough to supply domes
tic requirements.
In a recent phone call, a
member of the Communist
Politburo hinted that these dis
appointing energy developments
might soon play a role in Soviet
military affairs. Furthermore,
your job was at stake.
Over a couple of vodkas, you
reflected on the decisions that
had led to this situation. First,
the failure in recent years to con-!
duct adequate exploratory dril
ling had led to a dramatic fall in
your reserves-to-production
ratio, which meant that you were
depleting your resources much
faster than you were currently
replacing them.
The strategic decision to con

centrate on the enhanced de
velopment of already discovered
fields had proven disastrous,
since no significant fields had
been discovered in the past six
years. Meanwhile, production in
many Soviet fields had peaked
(particularly in Samotlar, the
massive field in West Siberia),
and it would take years to find
and develop new ones.
Second, the failure to train
enough crews and purchase
enough drilling equipment in the

past severely constrained the
prospects for increasing produc
tion in the present and near fu
ture. Thus, re-allocating de
velopment and production re
sources to West Siberia left the
older and offshore regions with
minimal facilities. In addition,
the Soviet turbo drills, left over
from the days when oil was easily
found, were wholly inapprop
riate for modern wells, typically
over 3000 meters underground.
Third, your comrades had
mismanaged the existing large
fields. In 1978, Bft percent of
Soviet oil was being produced by
water injection, a technique de
signed to increase geological
pressure and thus increase oil
flow. However, the fields had
been flooded to such an extent in
many areas that long term sus
tainable yields had been severely
sacrificed in order to meet
short-term production goals.
Fourth, the planners had
failed to install the railroads,
pipelines, roads and refineries
necessary to reliably develop and
transport any oil that your crude
geological techniques might lo
cate. In January 1979, for exam
ple, you were able to deliver only
1600 of the 4000 to 5000 rail
road cars of freight needed in
remote fields to construct the oil
called for in the 1980
plan. Drilling and pipeline goals
cannot possibly be met for the
next few years.
And as though all this were not
enough, the Western press had
begun to recognize these in
adequacies. Successive reports

by the CIA, the Joint Economic
Committee of the U.S. Congress,
the Oil and Gas Journal, for
tune, and the Wall Street Journal
were now broadcasting the
Soviet's technical and planning
failures throughout the capitalist
world. Damn the First Amend
ment!
Suppose now that you are a
member of the Politburo, the
political leadership. What's your
next move? You certainly want
to build up Soviet petroleum

capacity as quickly as possible,
but this process will take until the
late 1 980s to pay off, if it pays off
at all â€” so you begin to develop
plans for the interim period.
At the minimum, these plans
should promote worldwide
Communism, and in addition,
you'd like to put political and
military pressure on the major
oil-producing regions. Are such
opportunites available?
Indeed, the time is ripe in
mid-1979. The United States is
still immobilized by post-
Vietnam guilt, the world atten
tion is focused on OPEC prices,
so you take some bold actions.
You invade Afghanistan, and the
message to Iran is clear: Iranian
oil is in the Soviet sphere of in
terest.
You aid South Yemen militar
ily, as a possible stepping stone
to Saudi Arabia. Finally, you
support the government of Hon
duras and ferment unrest in
Nicaragua, with an eye toward
the rich oil resources of Mexico.
Perhaps you use foreign policy
ploys to divert attention from
your internal failures, alleviate
your petroleum dil?mma, and
garner geo-political advantage at
the same time. It's certainly
worth a try, since your inept
Minister of Petroleum can't
seem to meet the goals in the
plan. I hope he's got his resume
up to date.

If you were the Soviet ministerof
