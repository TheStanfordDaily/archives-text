Run for senate
With ASSU Senate elections
just two weeks away — and
senator candidacy petitions due
Friday of this week — I would
like to urge interested and capa
ble students to consider running
for the ASSU Senate positions.
Spring elections are necessar
ily rushed in this year of election

reform, hut the 1980-81 senate
will reap many benefits under
the new system. Senators elected
this spring will be the first able to
create and monitor ASSU pro
jects. track students on Univer
sity committees, and generally
guide student involvement in
University affairs.
Graduate students in particu

lar are needed to fill the senate
positions and properly represent
graduate concerns on campus.
This year's senate can attest to
the value of leadership and input
from the graduate ranks of the
University.
The ASSU as a whole has en
joyed tremendous growth this
year. The "acquistion" of the
Coffee House, reform of senate
elections, and issuance of an
ASSU newsletter (propaganda
from politicians after election!)
may be the most visible ac
complishments of the year, but
the 1979-80 senate has worked
hardest to achieve structural
changes that will assist future se
nates.
Drop by the ASSU office with
questions. Seek out present
senators and query them hai d on
their jobs. And feel free to at
tend the senate meeting this
Wednesday in C'F-RAS, Room
1980-81 ASSIJ Senate has al
ready been laid. The time for
concrete accomplishments is
now.
