# Friday Forum: The housing draw â€” is it fair?
## 
### 
This week's Forum topic is the Housing Draw. Granted that
there aren't enough rooms to satisfy everyone who wants to
live on campus, is the Draw the best way to allocate housing?
Or should we skip the bother and agony of a Draw in favor of
less-expensive random computer assignments?
Does the Draw system place the blame of number 5000 on
the person who drew it, rather than the University officials who
don't supply adequate housing? And are returning residence
priorities fair? Perhaps we should just charge more for desira
ble residences, and less for those like Stern and Wilbur to make
them more attractive.
Send columns and letters to The Stanford Daily, Storke

row. All contributions should be typed, double-spaced on a
