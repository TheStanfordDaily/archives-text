# TV anchorwoman makes trade-offs
## 
### Kathleen McClung Staff Writer 
"The fact that TV news has the
capability of communicating
with the largest group of people
instantaneously not only in
trigues me hut also scares the hell
out of me," television newscaster
Valerie Coleman told a noon
time audience last Wednesday in
Terman Auditorium.
"Anyone who relies on TV as
the only means of communica
tion is a very short-sighted, unin
formed person," Coleman added
in her speech entitled "The Poli
tics of Women in Broadcasting,"
part of the Center for Research
on Women (CROW) spring lec
ture series.
Coleman, who anchors Chan
nel 4's 1 I o'clock news, spoke on
the television journalist's re
sponsibilities and the particular
difficulties that women confront
in that profession.
"Journalists continually face
"professional trade-offs." Col
eman said. "The news is subjec
tive. Don't let anyone tell you it
isn't."
As an example of this subjec
tiveness, Coleman cited her deci
sion not to report on the marital
difficulties of George Moscone
during his San Francisco mayoral
race. She was the first reporter to
learn of these difficulties but
chose not to disclose them.

"1 made a judgment about
what people would be more in
terested in. Should I go tor sen
sationalism or real politics?"
Choosing whom to profile as
"top candidates" lor a Board of
Supervisors race is another
example of the arbitrary nature
ot teles ision news, Coleman
said.
Women in broadcast jour
nalism confront certain obstacles
that men do not, Coleman told
the audience of 200.
She grapples with "the
working-woman's dilemma" of
determining how to divide her
time between her career and her
family. "I have a great need to
spend time with my children, so I
need an extended dinner hour
written into my contract. I feel
stupid about asking for it, but I
do anyway."
"Women must learn to feel
comfortable expressing clout,
100 often women are concerned
with being friendly and conge
nial. They shouldn't be shy about
wielding power." Coleman as
serted.
"There are very few jobs in
TV. but it is an extremely high
paying field which leads to the
political-ness of the industry. I do
have political games to play, yet I
try to remain myself. It's impor
tant to stay a woman and a pro
fessional."
