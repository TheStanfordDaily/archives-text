What actor was originally de
signated to play the role eventu
ally played by Humphrey Bogart
in "Casablanca"?
It you answered Ronald
Reagan to the latter, perhaps
you are a member of one of the
31 teams entered in Stanford's
fourth annual Trivia Bowl.
Trivia Bowl IV, presented by
SLUT (Stanford Lovers of Un
usual Trivia), gets underway to
night with the first round of
single eliminations contests. The
preliminaries run today through
Thursday, from 7 to 10 p.m. up
stairs at Tresidder, with the
quarter-finals following Friday
night from 7 to 9. Saturday
night's semifinals, and final
rounds will be held in Kresge
Auditorium, from 7 to 10.
Each event consists of a series
of toss-up questions with bonus
questions offered to the team
properly answering the toss-up.
If a question remains un
answered, it goes to the audi
ence, whose points are tallied
along with those of the two
teams. Trivia Bowl is clearly an
audience participation event.
Sometimes the audience "wins"
a match!
The ringleader of SLUT's
executive committee is Garv

Hurlbut, a junior biology major.
He says there are two types of
questions: "the basic ones trivial
people should know and the
112 unny ones." The goal of Trivia
Bowl is fun and entertainment
for both participants and spec
tators. The competition takes on
a slightly serious tone near the
finals, as teams set their sights on
the Miller beer can trophy that is
passed on from year to year. The
prestigious trophy now rests in
the Law School.
Each team consists of four
members, and many of the con
testants will be appearing in their
second or third Trivia Bowl.
F-.ntry names range from"The
Jack Daniels" to "The Smiling
Aardvards." Hurlbut views a
group known as the "Tasmanian
Devils" as the team to beat. Its
members come from two teams,
both ha\ mg come in second
twice.
Hurlbut hopes for a large
turnout. A bigger audience
makes the event more fun for all.
Trivia Bowl contributes most in
its entertainment value. Hurlbut
says. "It's all basically useless in
formation. but. then again, that's
the purpose."
It you can't make it to Kresge
Saturday night, K/.SU will be
broadcasting the semifinal and
final rounds li\e.
