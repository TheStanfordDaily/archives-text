## Pretenders' debut proves they're the real thing 
### 
In a season which has brought
three of rock 'n' roll's most fa
bled bands to San Francisco —
the Ramones, the Clash and the
Who — Wednesday's show at
the Warfield Theatre makes it
difficult to remember anyone but
the Pretenders.
Although opening for the
Boomtown Rats, the Pretenders
were the chief attraction for the
sell-out crowd of 2200. The fans
paid up to $45 for scalper's tic
kets to see the young band in its
first area appearance.
The star of the evening was
Chrissie Hynde, lead singer and
songwriter for the Pretenders.
Hynde is one of the many New
Wavers raised in the famed cul
tural capital of Akron. Ohio. She
fled to Britain, wrote rock criti
cism for a spell, and then decided
that she could do a better job
than the people she was writing
about. She was right.
Prettified Patti
Hynde's stage appearance was
subdued, but riveting. Dressed in
black leather slacks and a bulky
T-shirt, she looked like a pret
tified Patti Smith from the neck
down. Her face ended the simi
larity — Hynde has the taut, an
gular features of a midnight
seductress, her enormous dark
eyes half-hidden behind girlish
bangs.
During their hour-long set,
the Pretenders played all but one
of the songs on their debut al
bum. as well as four excellent
new tunes. Hynde is the most
original female songwriter in
rock 'n' roll. I ler songs, typically
addressed to lovers or would-be
lovers, delight in sabotaging the
traditional stereotypes of
feminine sexuality. She is a
soft-hearted romantic with brass
knuckles: inviting in one mo
ment, intimidating in the next.
Hynde's stage manner
brought out much of the com
plexity of her character. She
managed to be powerfully erotic,
without resorting to the

Playhoy-style posing so common
among female rockers. Her
graceful movements were
punctuated by fierce, slashing at
tacks on her rhythm guitar.
Flawless
The three other Pretenders, all
British, also were impressive.
Drummer Martin Chambers,
Pete Farndon on bass, and lead
guitarist James Honeymoon
Scott provided restrained, flaw
less backdrops for Hynde's end
lessly nuanced vocals. This is a
phenomenally versatile band; it
moved effortlessly from the
bouncing '60s pop sound of
"Stop Your Sobbing" and
"Brass in Pocket" to frenetic,
ultra-modern rave-ups like "The
Wait" and "Tattooed Love
Boys."
The Pretenders' most striking
number was "Private Life." This
long, moody declaration of per
sonal independence featured a
breathtakingly bittersweet in
terplay among the three
guitarists. While Farndon's and
Scott's back-up vocals bleated
for attention, Hynde feigned in
difference in an exquisite vocal
which lingered over every sylla
ble. At the end of her song her
frustration rose into a wordless
cry, her quavering vibrato hyp
notically beautiful.
Silence
In the pit in front of the stage,
where rock 'n' roll verdicts are
issued, the Pretenders actually
succeeded in stilling most of the
pogo crowd. There are plenty of
bands that can set the kids danc
ing, but how many can make
them stop — and listen?
The Boomtown Rats made a
game attempt to top the Preten
ders' opening set. The Irish-born
Rats have emerged as the most
popular band in post-punk Bri
tain, but their following in
America is just beginning to
bloom.
The Rats are apparently going
all out on the current tour to ex
pand their stateside audience.

Their enormous stage included
split levels, extravagant decora
tions and unusual lighting ef
fects. The back wall of the stage
was a towering, flashing tic-tac
toe board which appeared to
have been lifted from the Hol
lywood Squares set.
The show itself was just as col
ossal. The six-man band played a
numbingly loud barrage of
sound, faithfully rendering the
intricate effects of their heavily
produced albums.
Fortunately, the Rats avoid
the bombast and bathos of
similarly-styled bands such as
Queen. The Rats' leader is singer
Bob Geldorf (another former
rock critic), a songwriter of un
usual wit and intelligence and an
extremely endearing performer.
Swagger
Geldorf s stage manner recal
led the music-hall antics of the
Kinks' Ray Davies, while his
singing suggested vintage-era
David Bowie (but without Bow
ie's sexual shenanigans and an
droid affectations). He danced

wildly, gestured broadly as he
acted out his dramatic composi
tions and generally swaggered
his way into the hearts of the au
dience.
The Rats' rich melange of
music and theatrics was at times
overbearing. The band played
for two hours, drawing heavily
from its third and latest album.
The Fine Art of Surfacing. Al
though the title ostensibly refers
to an aquatic maneuver, Geldorf
undoubtedly had a pun in mind
— for it is "surfaces" with which
the Boomtown Rats are obses
sed. Geldorf is a master of flash
and panache, but he sacrifices a
great deal of emotional depth
along the way.
The Rats in stride were a
sweeping spectacle of excess.
The show's best numbers —
"Joey's on the Street Again." "(I
Never Loved) Eva Braun" and
"She's So Modern" — were
manic pop catharses which had
the crowd dancing as furiously as
the band members.
The one truly great moment of

the performance occurred dur
ing "Having My Picture Taken."
Geldorf invited a dozen
camera-toting fans onstage and
then launched into the song, a
clever ditty about the übiquity of
photographic images in the
media-soaked modern world.
The young photographers
scrambled for every precious pic
ture, dodging guitars and
drumsticks in search of the per
fect close-up. " 1 can choose each
day who 1 want to be." Geldorf
sang boastfully to the clicking
shutters, which pursued him
around the stage as if he were the
Pied Piper.
The convergence onstage of
the photographers and the band
— during a song about that very
convergence — was an extraor
dinary scene. The Rats dramati
cally broke the usual boundaries
between popular art and life.
After the Pretenders' fierce
emotional intensity, the Rats'
lunatic abandon provided a
sweet, i! insubstantial nightcap.

along the way.
The Rats in stride were a
sweeping spectacle of excess.
The show's best numbers —
"Joey's on the Street Again." "(I

scrambled for every precious pic

drumsticks in search of the per

sang boastfully to the clicking
shutters, which pursued him
around the stage as if he were the
Pied Piper.
The convergence onstage of

— during a song about that very
convergence — was an extraor

The Pretenders wowed the crowd at the Warfield
In a season which has brought
three of rock 'n' roll's most fa
bled bands to San Francisco —
the Ramones, the Clash and the
Who — Wednesday's show at
the Warfield Theatre makes it
difficult to remember anyone but
the Pretenders.
Although opening for the
Boomtown Rats, the Pretenders
were the chief attraction for the
sell-out crowd of 2200. The fans
paid up to $45 for scalper's tic
kets to see the young band in its
first area appearance.
The star of the evening was
Chrissie Hynde, lead singer and
songwriter for the Pretenders.
Hynde is one of the many New
Wavers raised in the famed cul
tural capital of Akron. Ohio. She
fled to Britain, wrote rock criti
cism for a spell, and then decided
that she could do a better job
than the people she was writing
about. She was right.
Prettified Patti
Hynde's stage appearance was
subdued, but riveting. Dressed in
black leather slacks and a bulky
T-shirt, she looked like a pret
tified Patti Smith from the neck
down. Her face ended the simi
larity — Hynde has the taut, an
gular features of a midnight
seductress, her enormous dark
eyes half-hidden behind girlish
bangs.
During their hour-long set,
the Pretenders played all but one
of the songs on their debut al
bum. as well as four excellent
new tunes. Hynde is the most
original female songwriter in
rock 'n' roll. I ler songs, typically
addressed to lovers or would-be
lovers, delight in sabotaging the
traditional stereotypes of
feminine sexuality. She is a
soft-hearted romantic with brass
knuckles: inviting in one mo
ment, intimidating in the next.
Hynde's stage manner
brought out much of the com
plexity of her character. She
managed to be powerfully erotic,
without resorting to the

Playhoy-style posing so common
among female rockers. Her
graceful movements were
punctuated by fierce, slashing at
tacks on her rhythm guitar.
Flawless
The three other Pretenders, all
British, also were impressive.
Drummer Martin Chambers,
Pete Farndon on bass, and lead
guitarist James Honeymoon
Scott provided restrained, flaw
less backdrops for Hynde's end
lessly nuanced vocals. This is a
phenomenally versatile band; it
moved effortlessly from the
bouncing '60s pop sound of
"Stop Your Sobbing" and
"Brass in Pocket" to frenetic,
ultra-modern rave-ups like "The
Wait" and "Tattooed Love
Boys."
The Pretenders' most striking
number was "Private Life." This
long, moody declaration of per
sonal independence featured a
breathtakingly bittersweet in
terplay among the three
guitarists. While Farndon's and
Scott's back-up vocals bleated
for attention, Hynde feigned in
difference in an exquisite vocal
which lingered over every sylla
ble. At the end of her song her
frustration rose into a wordless
cry, her quavering vibrato hyp
notically beautiful.
Silence
In the pit in front of the stage,
where rock 'n' roll verdicts are
issued, the Pretenders actually
succeeded in stilling most of the
pogo crowd. There are plenty of
bands that can set the kids danc
ing, but how many can make
them stop — and listen?
The Boomtown Rats made a
game attempt to top the Preten
ders' opening set. The Irish-born
Rats have emerged as the most
popular band in post-punk Bri
tain, but their following in
America is just beginning to
bloom.
The Rats are apparently going
all out on the current tour to ex
pand their stateside audience.

Their enormous stage included
split levels, extravagant decora
tions and unusual lighting ef
fects. The back wall of the stage
was a towering, flashing tic-tac
toe board which appeared to
have been lifted from the Hol
lywood Squares set.
The show itself was just as col
ossal. The six-man band played a
numbingly loud barrage of
sound, faithfully rendering the
intricate effects of their heavily
produced albums.
Fortunately, the Rats avoid
the bombast and bathos of
similarly-styled bands such as
Queen. The Rats' leader is singer
Bob Geldorf (another former
rock critic), a songwriter of un
usual wit and intelligence and an
extremely endearing performer.
Swagger
Geldorf s stage manner recal
led the music-hall antics of the
Kinks' Ray Davies, while his
singing suggested vintage-era
David Bowie (but without Bow
ie's sexual shenanigans and an
droid affectations). He danced

wildly, gestured broadly as he
acted out his dramatic composi
tions and generally swaggered
his way into the hearts of the au
dience.
