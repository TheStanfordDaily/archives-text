# The 						Who in Oakland: testing themselves against themselves
## 
### 
The Who
Saturday, April 19
Oakland Coliseum
Rock performers seem to age
very quickly, and for the most
part not very gracefully. That's
partly due to our expectations:
we tend to consume performers,
ceaselessly demanding more
in every effort. Whatever the
reason, rockers who've given up
emotionally (the Rolling Stones,
for instance) can still limp
through a show; they live out the
end almost as historical artifacts,
making do on their reputation of
past greatness.
The physical end is more sad
dening — it's almost like steal
ing. You simply can't do the
things you used to do. No more
dancing all night. No more run
ning around the stage, jumping
off amps, smashing up guitars.
The wild outrageousness dies.
Continuing after this point is a
frustrating and hopeless strug
gle.
On the surface at least, the
Who seem perfect subjects for
such morbid talk. But if their
20-song 2-hour set Saturday
night was any indication, the
band hasn't quit trying to give
their best every night, even it
they have slowed a step or two.
The set spanned the band's
career, ranging from"I Can't
Explain" to material from Who's
Next, Quadrophenia and Who

Are You. The show's many high
lights proved that the hand can
often be as stirring and powerful
as ever.
The Who accomplished this
without using the lasers and
elaborate visual effects of past
tours, and more importantly,
they did it without Keith Moon.
The stripped-down staging
placed more demands on the
band's playing; more often than
not. they were up to the task.
Roger Daltrey's bellowing, ex
pressive vocals carried the first
three numbers, "Substitute," "I
Can't Explain" and "Baha
O' Riley." The rest of the band
seemed to just be getting their
bearings at first; guitarist Pete
Townshend was especially sub
dued.
John Entwistle's "My Wife"
really got the show rolling. Look
ing either like a conservative
banker or a gangster in his navy
blue pin-striped suit. Entwistle
contributed solid vocals, and his
bass playing was superb.
Townshend, clean-shaven and
clad in a pink T-Shirt that made
his arms look even more gangly
than usual, took over the vocals
on "Drowned" and began to cut
loose. Utilizing keyboardist
Rabbitt Bundrick, a three-man
horn section and Daltrey on
harmonica, the band turned this
number from Quadrophenia into
a full-fledged R & B rave-up.

Working on his new solo album
has dramatically improved
Townshend's voice; with the
band cooking behind him,
Townshend's shrieking "I want
to drown, drown, drown, drown,
drown ... in my baby's love" be
lied any fear that the Who are
past it.
From this point on,
Townshend seemed to immerse
himself in the show. While he
was clearly pacing himself.
Townshend's leaps and
windmills still had the force of
days past. In the set's extraordi
nary middle section ("Pinball
Wizard," "My Generation," "I
Can See for Miles" and the in
strumental "Sparks")
Townshend was at his very best,
shaking his body, jumping, de
manding that his guitar give him
the sound he wanted.
As the show developed, a new
harmoniousness in the band was
apparent; at first, that was a little
disconcerting. In the past, the
tension — between Townshend
and Daltrey, between Moon and
everyone else, etc. — raised the
energy level. You never knew
what was going to happen.
Since Moon's death, the band
has drawn closer. The relaxed
atmosphere onstage has a
number of positive effects.
There'> a better interplay bet
ween Dal try and Townshend —
they even sang brief duets on

"Sister Disco" and "Long Live
Rock." And the show was often
quite funny. As usual, most of
the humor is at Entwistle's ex
pense (centering on the size of
his thumbs). But there was even
some impromptu humor Satur
day night: a girl managed to get
onstage right before the first en
core, giving Daltry a pinch on the
butt before being led off by
roadies. Dal trey ran over and
goosed her back. Before long,
Townshend was getting in on the
act. goosing Daltrey.
But the easygoing confidence
within the band affects the
show's energy level — the Who
apparently need friction to be
most effective.
It's unlikely that any friction
will be created by drummer
Kenney Jones, who has handled
the unenviable job of replacing
Keith Moon quite well. Jones is
quiet and good-natured onstage,
in sharp contrast to the self
destructive Moon, and he's quick
to establish his own playing iden
tity as well. Jones lacks Moon's
explosiveness (that may be irrep
laceable), but he's a solid, steady
drummer; his work with the
Small Faces attests to his ability.
Jones' drumming powered the
climactic"See Me, Feel Me" and
"Won't Get Fooled Again;" and
while Townshend kidded that
the resulting ovations were
"kind, but stupid," it was clear

that the hand was quite pleased
with itself.
The two encores, "Young
Man's Blues" and"The Real
Me." were unexpected bonuses,
almost too good to he true. As
the hand worked through the
songs. I couldn't help hut think
that after 1 7-odd years of nights
like this, the Who somehow still
enjoyed testing themselves, se
eing how far they can go. And
while their best days are behind
them, the kind of idealism that
says that it's all still worth it lives
on. In that sense alone, this is still
a great rock band, and how old
they are doesn't really matter.
*****
One added note: the 11 deaths
in Cincinnati were on the minds
of more than a few people Satur
day night. One fan had a hopeful
"1 Survived the Who Concert"
stitched into his leather jacket.
All the seating for the Western
swing of this tour is reserved;
that creates a more subdued at
mosphere than festival seating
does, but no one seemed to mind
too much Saturday night.
Promoter Bill Graham's ef
forts at the show deserve men
tion. Before, during and after the
concert, Graham was personally
involved in keeping the aisles
clear, handling disturbances and
listening to people's complaints.
