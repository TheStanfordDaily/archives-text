of sunny Palo Alto.
Earth Quake, a long-standing
Bay area rock n' roll institution,
has been wowing hard-to-please
local audiences with powerful
heavy-metal, rhythm-and-blues
oriented numbers for close to 12
years. Performing Friday night at
The Keystone, Palo Alto's exub
erant California Street night
club. Earth Quake belted out
powerful cuts from their latest
album, Two Years in a Padded
Cell.
Hard rockers in the classic
vein. Earth Quake has early
roots in British groups like the
Yardbirds and the Who. Starting
out in the late '60s as a rowdy,
trend-setting heavy metal band
from Berkeley, the band re
corded its first album. Why Don't
You Try Me, on A&M records.
The lp boasts guest artists Pete
Sears of Starship fame and
Lenny Pickett and Chuck
I indley on horns.
forming an alliance with the
album's producer. Matthew
King Kaufman, the band re
turned from L A. to the Bay
area to co-found Beserkeley
records. This feisty independent
label carries owner-artists
Greg Kihn, the Rubinoos and
Jonathan Richman. Releasing
several albums on Beserkeley
including Leveled and 8.5, Earth
Quake has often fallen just short
of a national commercial success.
Backstage at the Keystone,

John Doukas, winsome lead
singer, and bassist Stan Miller,
founder of the band, discuss the
group's career. With Two Years
in a Padded Cell beginning to get
fair airplay on FM stations
around the country, there is
reason to he confident about the
band's future.
Doukas comments that the
color is only now returning to his

"The label put on you doesn't
matter a whole hell of a 10t...
It's all Fresca, the same taste."

skin after two grueling years of
work on the hand's new release.
Perhaps for this reason the
album contains an undercurrent
of self-irony. Songs like "Good
bye California" and "Tremor's
Touch" suggest a tongue-in
cheek reflection on the band's
California origins. The hard
hitting number, "Trouble," also
contains impressive guitar leads
by Ronnie Montrose, a long time
friend of Earth Quake guitar
whiz, Robbie Dunbar.
Though Two Years in a Pad
ded Cell has barely hit record
store shelves. the band will begin
work on another album this
week. Doukas says the effort will
contain some experimentation in
style and material.
Fresh from recent opening
dates with UFO in Sacramento
and Oakland, the band will un
dertake a nationwide tour later
this year.
As Doukas puts it, "this band
is determined to see every corner
of the earth. So many people
never see anything but their own
backyards."
A rosy future ahead of them
and a dynamic past behind them.

Doukas and Miller can afford a
certain emotional detachment
from current musical trends in
the Bay area. Doukas maintains
that San Francisco is a great
melting pot for East Coast, West
Coast and Midwestern musical
styles.
Doukas emphasizes that the
hand has not been pressured to
adopt so-called New Wave

philosophies and techniques. He
says it's the same old rock n' roll
with a new label. .
"Everything works in a circle:
It started out in the 60s, '62 and
you've got Phil Spector. In the
mid 60s along come the Beatles
and it's a New Wave. Along
comes someone else and you've
got a New Wave. Mind you, it
was never labeled as New Wave
but as the progression goes . . .
it's basically the same music. It's
about teenage rebellion. It's like
someone has to complain. What
the hell. Let's give it to the pub
lic."
Miller confirms Doukas'
point. "We went to Europe and
they called us New Wave power
pop, power rock. We got home
and it's ,i whole different story.
The label put on yOu doesn't
mean a whole hell of a lot.
"It's a media identification.
You have to put a label on it or
it's not marketable," chimes in
Doukas." It's the business you' re
in. You've got the old Fresca
cans and the new Fresca cans."
"It'sall Fresca," chuckles Mil
ler. 'It's the same damn taste."

never see anything but their own

A rosy future ahead of them
and a dynamic past behind them.

Doukas and Miller can afford a
certain emotional detachment
from current musical trends in
the Bay area. Doukas maintains
that San Francisco is a great
melting pot for East Coast, West
Coast and Midwestern musical
styles.
Doukas emphasizes that the
hand has not been pressured to
adopt so-called New Wave

philosophies and techniques. He
says it's the same old rock n' roll
with a new label. .
"Everything works in a circle:
It started out in the 60s, '62 and
you've got Phil Spector. In the
mid 60s along come the Beatles
and it's a New Wave. Along
comes someone else and you've
got a New Wave. Mind you, it
was never labeled as New Wave
but as the progression goes . . .
it's basically the same music. It's
about teenage rebellion. It's like
someone has to complain. What
the hell. Let's give it to the pub
lic."
Miller confirms Doukas'
point. "We went to Europe and
they called us New Wave power
pop, power rock. We got home
and it's ,i whole different story.
The label put on yOu doesn't
mean a whole hell of a lot.
"It's a media identification.
You have to put a label on it or
it's not marketable," chimes in
Doukas." It's the business you' re
in. You've got the old Fresca
cans and the new Fresca cans."
"It'sall Fresca," chuckles Mil
ler. 'It's the same damn taste."
