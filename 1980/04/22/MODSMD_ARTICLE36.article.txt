# Beautiful 'Wilderness' at ACT

The American Conservatory
Theatre's production of Eugene
O'Neill's light-hearted comedy
Ah, Wilderness! is one of the best
productions that you are likely to
see in San Francisco. Not only do
the actors feQl at complete ease
with the play, hut they seem to
share in the affection that fills
Ah, Wilderness!.
The most frequently per
formed O'Neill play, it is his only
comedy. It shows the brighter
side of what he usually portrays
as a dark and tragic childhood. It
is, in his own words, the "break
ing away from an old formula 1
have enslaved myself with."
"My purpose," O'Neill wrote,
"was to write a play true to the
spirit of the American large
small-town at the turn of the cen
tury."
The play follows two days, the
July 4th weekend 1906, in the
life of the Miller family. At the
center there is Richard Miller
(Thomas M. Nahrwold), an in
trospective and helplessly
romantic teen-ager. Richard
reads Shelley, Wilde, Shaw and
Carlyle's French Revolution, au
thors who scandalize his mother
Essie (Anne Lawder). She pres
ses the issue with Richard's
father Nat Miller (Michael Win
ters) so that he has to have a talk
with the boy, even though he is
more amused than alarmed at his
interests.
Richard is in love with an
equally immature Muriel
McComber (Janice Garcia),
whose father hits the roof in true
bourgeois fashion when he dis
covers that his daughter is receiv
ing Swinburne poetry.
An "I can't see you again" let
ter written to Richard by Muriel,
under duress, forces Richard
into despair and anger at her
treason. He goes to a "low dive"
to show his independence. He
buys drinks for a prostitute
(without losing his purity) and
goes home sick.

The Millers are an enlightened
middle American family. They
are more mature and aware so
that petty role playing is dis
posed of in times of crisis and the
family sticks together.
When Nat Miller is forced to
play the authoritative father he
does so only reluctantly. Both he
and Essie feel that they have to
punish Richard for his escapade;
that's what you should do with
children, but they don't do it out
of moral outrage, as does
Muriel's father.
O'Neill defines two kinds of
love in the play, the love of the
members of the family for one
another and the more destruc
tive kind that people use against
one another. O'Neill affirms the
first. The second is the kind that
Muriel uses against Richard by
playing the hard-to-get object of
desire.
It is this kind of destructive
love which fuels the drinking of
despairing good-for-nothing Sid
Davis (Daniel Davis), Essie's
brother. His is an unconsum
mated love for Nat's sister Lily
Miller (Joy Carlin) which sends
him into a vicious circle of in
feriority complexes.
In Act 111, director Allen
Fletcher could have cut some of
the mushiness and sentimental
ity which makes you shift in
your seat. But, otherwise, the
performance will keep you
laughing. Everyone does a
superb job. Some of the minor
characters such as Norah, the
maid (Bonnie Bowers), steal
many laughs, as does the
tragicomic character of Sid with
his bushy sideburns, protruding
tongue and heavy breathing (un
der the influence) which reminds
you of a lovable old bulldog as
he struggles to eat his July 4th
lobster, shell and all.
The set designed by Ralph
Funicello is as good as every
thing else in this production.
