# Darlings': Tatum, Kristy vamp at camp
## 
### 
The recipe is simple. Take a
spoiled heiress: gold earrings,
Bermuda tan; stir in a chain
smoking delinquent decked out
in dungarees. Throw the two to
gether as cabin-mates at a girl's
summer camp with a plot con
cocted from an old sorority tape
and you have the cast and crew of
the flick Little Darlings.
Directed by Ronald Maxwell
and produced by Stephen
Friedman. Little Darlings is a
light-hearted comedy centering
around a contest between co
stars Tatum O'Neal and Kristy
McNichol. The girls vie to see
who will lose her virginity first at
Camp Little Wolf.
Little Darlings attempts to
explore some otherwise "heavy"
moral decisions encountered by
the two girls as they experience
sexua I adolesce nee.
It clearly is McNichol's movie:

her role is a perfect vehicle for
the former Emmy winner and
star of the television series
"Family." As Angel Bright, the
tough, little street sweetie,
whose frequent "bitch' sand
"shithead"s tumble out of a
mouth you'd expect to see lead
ing cheers at a local high school,
McNichol takes command of the
action from her first strut in front
of the camera.
Rich kid
O'Neal's performance is dis
appointing. more, perhaps, be
cause of the character she must
create in Ferris Whitney, the rich
kid who's driven to the camp bus
in a Rolls Royce, than to her al
ready demonstrated acting ta
lents. She comes oft as being as
polished as the jewelry she
wears, a tinge unnatural in the
woodsy cabin she shares with
McNichol.

The movie focuses on the rela
tionship between O'Neal and
McNichol as they compete to
pass what they consider to be a
rite of womanhood. When the
contest finally is over, you feel a
little nostalgic. An innocence
which you hadn't realized had
been creajed. has been stolen, ir
revocably traded for the taste of
womanhood experienced by the
victor.
The supporting cast is excel
lent. Armand Assante plays the
camp counselor chosen for the
contest by O'Neal. Without
yielding to dialogue that is
temptingly condescending, he
gives a surprisingly tender and
convincing performance. New
comer Matt Dillon is equally
applaudable as the beer-guzzling
heartthrob of McNichol's
dreams.
In their relationship, the

movie is carried through the
too-often cardboard or
stereotypical portrayals: instead,
a series of believable scenes is
developed in which McNichol
delivers her strongest perfor
mance.
Young talents
The versatility she displays in
her growth from a city girl to the
fringes of adulthood indicates
rare talent in such a young ac
tress.
Little Darlings caters to the
audience. A Rocky atmosphere
builds in the theater as you cheer
the heroines.
It's a fun movie, full of antics
and yet credible enough to keep
you guessing about the outcome
of the contest. Nothing to rave
about, but certainly worth the
drive to Old Mill Six.
