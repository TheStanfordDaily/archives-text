# 1979 Senior survey results
## More than half plan to work first year after graduation 
### 
The Senior Survey is an annual
attempt by the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies to
ascertain how seniors evaluate the
various aspects of their un
dergraduate experience.
The survey has three parts. The
first pertains to the assessments by
seniors of the undergraduate
program, their competence in
broad areas, and their general
experiences with the faculty and
administration. The results of this
portion of the survey constitute
the subject matter of the present
report.
The second part, prepared and
compiled at the Academic In
formation Center, reviews
students' academic graduate
school plans. This is intended to
provide undergraduates and their
advisors with information about
the success of Stanford students in
gaining admission to particular
programs. The results are
available for reference at the
Academic Information Center.
The third part elicits students'
views particularly outstanding or
poor departmental and faculty
performances. These results are
not made public but are con
fidentially conveyed to depart
ment chairmen and certain
academic officers of the
University. Department chairmen
are at liberty to share this in
formation with their faculty at
their own discretion, but not to
incorporate this information in
departmental faculty folders.
Questionnaire response
Questionnaires were mailed to
1,789 seniors in the spring of

-1979; 793 (45%) were returned.
This year's data are subdivided
into categories to compare the
responses of 1) women with men,
and 2) students from six general
academic areas where they
majored: earth sciences,
engineering, humanities, natural
sciences, social sciences, and
interdepartmental programs
within Humanities and Sciences.
The seniors who responded to
the questionnaire consisted of 468
men and 325 women. The
distribution of students in the
various academic areas was as
follows: earth sciences, 23;
engineering, 124; humanities,
132; natural sciences, 117; social
sciences, 228; and in
terdepartmental, 165. (The
remaining four students did not
answer the question about major
program.)
Seventeen percent of students
identified themselves as transfer
students. Thirteen percent of
students specified economics as
their major. Another 12% and
11% reported their major as
biological sciences and human
biology respectively. These
percentages are similar to the
known proportions in the entire
1978-79 graduating class.
Over half of the respondents
report that they plan to work
fulltime in the year immediately
following graduation. This
represents an increase of 100%
over five years ago: In 1975
27.5% of the respondents planned
fulltime work immediately after
graduation; in 1976 the per
centage increased to 32.2%, in

1977 to 36.6%, in 1978 to 50%,
and in 1979 it increased by
another 5% to 55% of all
respondents.
The proportion of respondents
planning fulltime graduate study
in the year immediately following
graduation has declined from
53% in 1975 to 35% in 1979. As
in previous years, the proportion
of respondents planning even
tually to obtain graduate
education is 90%.
The Undergraduate Program
Table 1 presents the overall
evaluations of the undergraduate
program; Tables 2 and 3 break
this information down by broad
areas of study. In Table 1, per
centages of the "No Experience"
column include missing responses,
as well as those indicating no
experience; these figures are
excluded from the rest of the
tabulations.
Responses to the overall quality
of undergraduate education at
Stanford are quite positive.
Ninety-six percent consider it to
have been "good," "very good,"
or "excellent." Only 4% thought
it was only "fair" and less than
0.5% considered it "poor."
There are no large differences
in this regard among students
from the Schools of Engineering,
Earth Sciences, and the School of
Humanities and Sciences, nor
within the three subdivisions of
the latter.
In response to the question
concerning the value of their
studies as general or liberal
education, 80% considered it to
have been "good" through "ex

cellent." More women (83%)
than men (78%) expressed
confidence in the value of their
liberal or general education. The
departmental breakdown in
Table 2 shows it was the
engineering, earth sciences, and
natural science majors who most
frequently rated it lower.
"The adequacy of your
training for graduate or
professional schools" was assessed
"excellent" by 17% . Among those
who planned fulltime study this
year, 25% felt their preparation
for graduate school was above
average, compared to 14% of
those who planned fulltime work.
Table 2 shows how seniors in the
major academic areas evaluated
various aspects of their un
dergraduate education.
Seniors were asked to rate their
own current abilities in twelve
different subject areas. Most
students gave themselves good
through excellent ratings for their
ability to write in English (89%),
ability to understand human
behavior and development
(86%), and ability to understand
social processes and institutions
(85%). But 35% evaluated
themselves as no better than fair
in using mathematics and
statistics, and 46% made a similar
assessment of their ability to
understand Western culture.
Twenty-eight percent con
sidered themselves either fair or
poor in their ability to understand
another culture, and more than
half (55%) gave themselves poor
or fair ratings in the ability to
communicate in a foreign
language.

When we compare the self
evaluation of those who planned
to work fulltime with those who
expected to continue their studies,
only one significant difference
emerges. Of those who planned to
enter graduate or professional
schools, 25% evaluated their
"understanding the workings of
the physical world" as "ex
cellent." Only 12% of those
planning fulltime work responded
in that way.
Fifty-three prcent of the men
described themselves as "very
good" or "excellent" in using
mathematical or statistical tools,
compared to 27% of the women.
Fifty-eight percent of the men,
but only 32% of the women
thought that their understanding
of the physical world was very
good or excellent.
Ability to communicate in a
foreign langauge was reported at
a level of good through excellent
by 58% of the women but only
35% of the men. Very good or
excellent ratings were given by
55% of the women and 39% of
the men in their ability to un
derstand other cultures.
Faculty and Administration
The Senior Survey suggests
once again that undergraduates at
Stanford have a very high regard
for the faculty's competence in
scholarship and research. Table 1
shows that 99% of the respon
dents rated the faculty on average
as scholars and researchers good
through excellent. Virtually no
one rated them as poor. But by
comparison, the seniors evaluated

the faculty significantly lower as
teachers (80% good through
excellent), as major advisors
(57%), and as general advisors
(33%).
A majority of the seniors gave
good through excellent
evaluations to other areas of
student involvement with
professors and administrators:
faculty accessiblity outside the
classroom (80%) and accessibility
and helpfulness of department
administrators (68%). Sixty
percent gave good or higher
ratings to the TAs. Those who
planned to study fulltime in 1978-
79 gave higher ratings to their
major advisors (38% very good or
excellent than those who planned
to work fulltime (28%).
Senior Survey 1980
The Senior Survey
Questionnaire which is being sent
to the members of the class of
1980 has been revised in a number
of important aspects. Items AlO
to Al9 in Table 1 have been
replaced by those areas
designated as the new distribution
requirements.
Students are now being asked
to express their views not only in
terms of their perceptions of their
abilitis on an absolute scale but
also with regard to the "value
added" at Stanford.
Finally, instead of the in
vitation for additional comments
on their undergraduate ex
periences, seniors are now asked
to write an essay on their concept
of what constitutes an educated
person and the extent to which
they have approached that ideal.
