High court to look at abortion, TV
WASHINGTON —TheSupreme Court yesterday
explored whether Congress has the right to encour
age even abnormal childbirths by denying welfare
funds for most abortions.
I he debate embraced medicine and religion along
with the law as the justices heard arguments in a
major test of the right of Congress to determine how
welfare money can be spent.
The case involves the federal law prohibiting wel
fare payments, through the Medicaid program, forall
abortions except those necessary to save the mother's
lite or to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or
incest.
The case reached the court after the government
and other defenders of the funding restrictions ap
pealed trial court decisions striking down the federal
law, known as the Hyde Amendment, and a similar
Illinois statute.
The high court is expected to issue a decision be
fore its summer recess in late June.
The court also said yesterday it will decide whether
television and still-photography coverage of trials is
constitutional.
The justices said they will review Florida court
rulings that such news coverage does not automati
cally ruin a fair trial.
The court's eventual decision is not likelv before
1981.
It was 15 years ago when the Supreme Court over
turned the swindling conviction of Texas financier
Billy Sol Estes. ruling that television's techniques as
they then existed inherently interfered with a fair

trial.
Since then, many states have allowed television
and still-camera coverage of court proceedings even
though the American Bar Association has refused to
back down from its longtime opposition.

ban on electronic media and photographic coverage
ot courts still serve as a model for half the states and
the federal judiciary.
New leader heads South Yemen
CAIRO — The doctrinaire leader of South
Yemen, Abdul Fatah Ismail, resigned yesterday as
president of the Arab world's only Marxist state and
was replaced by a pragmatic former primary school
headmaster. Ali Nasser Mohammed, who had been
prime minister.

the official Aden Radio, could have important reper
cussions in the struggle between the United States
and the Soviet Union for influence and strategic ad-
v antage on the foot of the Arabian peninsula with its
petroleum treasures and proximity to the Islamic tur
bulence of Iran.
Ismail's apparent demise was v ievved with particu
lar interest, because it came as the United States
seemed headed for a showdown with Iran that could
include a blockade of the Persian Gulf on the other
side of the peninsula. Soviet reconnaisance planes
and ships use South Yemeni facilities at Khoramak
sar and Al Mukalla on the Gulf of Aden to monitor
U.S. ships in the Indian Ocean and the gulf area.
Although considered less dogmatic than Ismail,
Mohammed long has favored South Yemen's close
relations with the Soviet Union and. based on his
past, was not expected to make any radical or im
mediate changes in the strong Soviet military pre
sence accepted by Aden.

Service asked approval yesterday to increase charges
for mailing most types of letters from 15 to 20 cents,
effective early next year.

Service will need new revenue by next February or
March because of rapidly rising labor and energy
costs.
"Had inflation not shot up since May 1978. the
time of our last rate hike, but instead stayed at the
level of that time, we would not today be seeking new
rates. In fact, we could have been able to keep the
current rates in effect until 1982." Bolger told repor
ters.
The rate request, averaging 28 percent higher for
the various types of mail, went to the Postal Rate
Commission. The commission can hold up to 10
months of hearings on the request before recom
mending new rates. After that, the Postal Service
board must give final approval before the new rates
take effect.
Bolger pledged new efforts to improve productiv -
ity and said without these steps the letter rate would
have had to go to 22 cents.
Less Olympic nationalism urged
LAUSANNE. Switzerland — Olympic leaders

as possible to compete in the Moscow Games.
Three days of talks, involving the executive board

ternational Sports Federations began with discussion
of dropping national flags and anthems from Olympic
ceremonies.

decided whether to follow the United States lead and
boycott the Moscow Games because of Soviet inter
vention in Afghanistan.
Some are reported ready to send their athletes if
there were less nationalism and the opening cere
mony offered less propaganda value to the Russians.
Olympic leaders from Britain, Italy. Belgium and
Liechtenstein had a working lunch with the lOC
executive board and pressed for the defusing of
nationalism in the Games. Sir Denis Follows, presi
dent of the British Olympic Association, said:
"We reminded them that under the rules, the
Olympics are contests between Athletes and not bet
ween nations. We all agreed that everything should
be done to see that the Games are held in the correct
Olympic spirit."
The British association is one of the few Olympic
Committees in Western Europe which is firmly com
mitted to competing in Moscow.

"crimes and injustices." But the approved message
says:
"We . . . hear the agonies of your people, we hear
their cries for freedom from foreign domination,
trom cultural imperialism, from economic exploita
tion. We long tor that time when our peoples may
dwell together in peace.
"In the words of Moses, the liberator, let us say to
each other, 'Let my people go!' And let us begin to
walk together down the long, hard road toward re
conciliation."

W. Europe considers Iran bans
LUXEMBOURG — Common Market foreign
ministers, debating what steps Western Europe
should take in the U.S.-Iran crisis, are ready to re
commend stopping imports of Iranian oil. drastically
reducing diplomatic contacts and banning arms sales
to Iran, diplomatic sources said yesterday.
If that docs not pressure Iran into releasing the 50
U.S. Embassy hostages, the nine-nation Common
Market would be prepared to end all trade with the
Iranians, the sources said.
The foreign ministers, who opened their meeting
here yesterday, were expected to announce the anti-
Iran steps today.
Earlier yesterday Australia became the second
Western country to follow President Jimmy Carter's
lead by ordering economic retaliatory steps against
Iran.
The Australian Cabinet decided to discourage
non-food exports to Iran by denying Australian firms
export incentives, subsidies and tax concessions for
such trade, and to limit insurance coverage for Iran
bound goods.
Portugal w as the first to join the U.S.-led sanctions,
imposing a total ban on Portuguese-Iranian trade last
week.
The two-stage Western European plan calls for
reduction of embassy staffs in Tehran and similar
cutbacks at Iranian missions to Common Market
countries, prohibition of arms sales to Iran and a
cutoff of all purchases of Iranian oil. the sources said.
II these actions do not help win the hostages' re
lease, all trade relations between the nine nations and
Iran would be broken.
Candidates stalk Pennsylvania
PHILADELPHIA — Sen. Edward Kennedy
urged Pennsylvania Democrats yesterday to make
their primary ballots read "no more Jimmy Carter."
Hut N ice President Walter Mondale asked them to
support a president "who will continue to deliver."
Republican Ronald Reagan said if he were in
George Bush's shoes, he would "give serious
thought" to quitting the presidential campaign. But
Bush said "the indications are all encouraging" that
he will upset the former California governor in to
day's presidential preference balloting.
The preference vote is not the one that counts in
the Republican primary. The 83 nominating dele
gates are elected separately, 77 of them in the prim
ary election. Reagan said he was confident a majority
of the Pennsylvania delegation would be for him.
All three candidates, plus Carter's stand-in cam
paigner. spent election e\e in final quest of votes in a
primary that could shape the tickets of both parties.
While Kennedy insisted that defeat would not lead
him to drop his challenge to Carter, his strategists
acknowledged that he'd have to win to hold a
mathematical chance of overtaking the president's
lopsided lead in delegate strength.
The Democratic primary is for 185 nominating
votes, apportioned on the basis of the popular vote in
congressional districts.
Bush invested two weeks of his time and nearly Si
million of his campaign treasury in w hat appears to be
his last, best chance to upset Reagan.
High court to look at abortion, TV
WASHINGTON —TheSupreme Court yesterday
explored whether Congress has the right to encour
age even abnormal childbirths by denying welfare
funds for most abortions.
I he debate embraced medicine and religion along
with the law as the justices heard arguments in a
major test of the right of Congress to determine how
welfare money can be spent.
The case involves the federal law prohibiting wel
fare payments, through the Medicaid program, forall
abortions except those necessary to save the mother's
lite or to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or
incest.
The case reached the court after the government
and other defenders of the funding restrictions ap
pealed trial court decisions striking down the federal
law, known as the Hyde Amendment, and a similar
Illinois statute.
The high court is expected to issue a decision be
fore its summer recess in late June.
The court also said yesterday it will decide whether
television and still-photography coverage of trials is
constitutional.
The justices said they will review Florida court
rulings that such news coverage does not automati
cally ruin a fair trial.
The court's eventual decision is not likelv before
1981.
It was 15 years ago when the Supreme Court over
turned the swindling conviction of Texas financier
Billy Sol Estes. ruling that television's techniques as
they then existed inherently interfered with a fair

trial.
Since then, many states have allowed television
and still-camera coverage of court proceedings even
though the American Bar Association has refused to
back down from its longtime opposition.
The ABA's ethical standards imposing an absolute
ban on electronic media and photographic coverage
ot courts still serve as a model for half the states and
the federal judiciary.
New leader heads South Yemen
CAIRO — The doctrinaire leader of South
Yemen, Abdul Fatah Ismail, resigned yesterday as
president of the Arab world's only Marxist state and
was replaced by a pragmatic former primary school
headmaster. Ali Nasser Mohammed, who had been
prime minister.
The unexpected leadership change, announced by
the official Aden Radio, could have important reper
cussions in the struggle between the United States
and the Soviet Union for influence and strategic ad-
v antage on the foot of the Arabian peninsula with its
petroleum treasures and proximity to the Islamic tur
bulence of Iran.
Ismail's apparent demise was v ievved with particu
lar interest, because it came as the United States
seemed headed for a showdown with Iran that could
include a blockade of the Persian Gulf on the other
side of the peninsula. Soviet reconnaisance planes
and ships use South Yemeni facilities at Khoramak
sar and Al Mukalla on the Gulf of Aden to monitor
U.S. ships in the Indian Ocean and the gulf area.
Although considered less dogmatic than Ismail,
Mohammed long has favored South Yemen's close
relations with the Soviet Union and. based on his
past, was not expected to make any radical or im
mediate changes in the strong Soviet military pre
sence accepted by Aden.
Postal Service wants price hike
WASHINGTON — Blaming inflation, the Postal
Service asked approval yesterday to increase charges
for mailing most types of letters from 15 to 20 cents,
effective early next year.
Postmaster General William Bolgersaid the Postal
Service will need new revenue by next February or
March because of rapidly rising labor and energy
costs.
"Had inflation not shot up since May 1978. the
time of our last rate hike, but instead stayed at the
level of that time, we would not today be seeking new
rates. In fact, we could have been able to keep the
current rates in effect until 1982." Bolger told repor
ters.
The rate request, averaging 28 percent higher for
the various types of mail, went to the Postal Rate
Commission. The commission can hold up to 10
months of hearings on the request before recom
mending new rates. After that, the Postal Service
board must give final approval before the new rates
take effect.
Bolger pledged new efforts to improve productiv -
ity and said without these steps the letter rate would
have had to go to 22 cents.

High court to look at abortion, TV
WASHINGTON —TheSupreme Court yesterday
explored whether Congress has the right to encour
age even abnormal childbirths by denying welfare
funds for most abortions.
I he debate embraced medicine and religion along
with the law as the justices heard arguments in a
major test of the right of Congress to determine how
welfare money can be spent.
The case involves the federal law prohibiting wel
fare payments, through the Medicaid program, forall
abortions except those necessary to save the mother's
lite or to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or
incest.
The case reached the court after the government
and other defenders of the funding restrictions ap
pealed trial court decisions striking down the federal
law, known as the Hyde Amendment, and a similar
Illinois statute.
The high court is expected to issue a decision be
fore its summer recess in late June.
The court also said yesterday it will decide whether
television and still-photography coverage of trials is
constitutional.
The justices said they will review Florida court
rulings that such news coverage does not automati

CAIRO — The doctrinaire leader of South
Yemen, Abdul Fatah Ismail, resigned yesterday as
president of the Arab world's only Marxist state and
was replaced by a pragmatic former primary school
headmaster. Ali Nasser Mohammed, who had been
prime minister.
The unexpected leadership change, announced by
the official Aden Radio, could have important reper
cussions in the struggle between the United States
and the Soviet Union for influence and strategic ad-
v antage on the foot of the Arabian peninsula with its
petroleum treasures and proximity to the Islamic tur
bulence of Iran.
Ismail's apparent demise was v ievved with particu
lar interest, because it came as the United States
seemed headed for a showdown with Iran that could
include a blockade of the Persian Gulf on the other
side of the peninsula. Soviet reconnaisance planes
and ships use South Yemeni facilities at Khoramak
sar and Al Mukalla on the Gulf of Aden to monitor
U.S. ships in the Indian Ocean and the gulf area.
Although considered less dogmatic than Ismail,
Mohammed long has favored South Yemen's close

mediate changes in the strong Soviet military pre

W. Europe considers Iran bans
LUXEMBOURG — Common Market foreign
ministers, debating what steps Western Europe
should take in the U.S.-Iran crisis, are ready to re
commend stopping imports of Iranian oil. drastically
reducing diplomatic contacts and banning arms sales
to Iran, diplomatic sources said yesterday.
If that docs not pressure Iran into releasing the 50
U.S. Embassy hostages, the nine-nation Common
Market would be prepared to end all trade with the
Iranians, the sources said.
The foreign ministers, who opened their meeting
here yesterday, were expected to announce the anti-
Iran steps today.
Earlier yesterday Australia became the second
Western country to follow President Jimmy Carter's
lead by ordering economic retaliatory steps against
Iran.
The Australian Cabinet decided to discourage
non-food exports to Iran by denying Australian firms
export incentives, subsidies and tax concessions for
such trade, and to limit insurance coverage for Iran
bound goods.
Portugal w as the first to join the U.S.-led sanctions,
imposing a total ban on Portuguese-Iranian trade last
week.
The two-stage Western European plan calls for
reduction of embassy staffs in Tehran and similar
cutbacks at Iranian missions to Common Market
countries, prohibition of arms sales to Iran and a
cutoff of all purchases of Iranian oil. the sources said.
II these actions do not help win the hostages' re
lease, all trade relations between the nine nations and
Iran would be broken.
Candidates stalk Pennsylvania
PHILADELPHIA — Sen. Edward Kennedy
urged Pennsylvania Democrats yesterday to make
their primary ballots read "no more Jimmy Carter."
Hut N ice President Walter Mondale asked them to
support a president "who will continue to deliver."
Republican Ronald Reagan said if he were in
George Bush's shoes, he would "give serious
thought" to quitting the presidential campaign. But
Bush said "the indications are all encouraging" that
he will upset the former California governor in to
day's presidential preference balloting.
The preference vote is not the one that counts in
the Republican primary. The 83 nominating dele
gates are elected separately, 77 of them in the prim
ary election. Reagan said he was confident a majority
of the Pennsylvania delegation would be for him.
All three candidates, plus Carter's stand-in cam
paigner. spent election e\e in final quest of votes in a
primary that could shape the tickets of both parties.
While Kennedy insisted that defeat would not lead
him to drop his challenge to Carter, his strategists
acknowledged that he'd have to win to hold a
mathematical chance of overtaking the president's
lopsided lead in delegate strength.
The Democratic primary is for 185 nominating
votes, apportioned on the basis of the popular vote in
congressional districts.
Bush invested two weeks of his time and nearly Si
million of his campaign treasury in w hat appears to be
his last, best chance to upset Reagan.
High court to look at abortion, TV
WASHINGTON —TheSupreme Court yesterday
explored whether Congress has the right to encour
age even abnormal childbirths by denying welfare
funds for most abortions.
I he debate embraced medicine and religion along
with the law as the justices heard arguments in a
major test of the right of Congress to determine how
welfare money can be spent.
The case involves the federal law prohibiting wel
fare payments, through the Medicaid program, forall
abortions except those necessary to save the mother's
lite or to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape or
incest.
The case reached the court after the government
and other defenders of the funding restrictions ap
pealed trial court decisions striking down the federal
law, known as the Hyde Amendment, and a similar
Illinois statute.
The high court is expected to issue a decision be
fore its summer recess in late June.
The court also said yesterday it will decide whether
television and still-photography coverage of trials is
constitutional.
The justices said they will review Florida court
rulings that such news coverage does not automati
cally ruin a fair trial.
The court's eventual decision is not likelv before
1981.
It was 15 years ago when the Supreme Court over
turned the swindling conviction of Texas financier
Billy Sol Estes. ruling that television's techniques as
they then existed inherently interfered with a fair

trial.
Since then, many states have allowed television
and still-camera coverage of court proceedings even
though the American Bar Association has refused to
back down from its longtime opposition.
The ABA's ethical standards imposing an absolute
ban on electronic media and photographic coverage
ot courts still serve as a model for half the states and
the federal judiciary.
New leader heads South Yemen
CAIRO — The doctrinaire leader of South
Yemen, Abdul Fatah Ismail, resigned yesterday as
president of the Arab world's only Marxist state and
was replaced by a pragmatic former primary school
headmaster. Ali Nasser Mohammed, who had been
prime minister.
The unexpected leadership change, announced by
the official Aden Radio, could have important reper
cussions in the struggle between the United States
and the Soviet Union for influence and strategic ad-
v antage on the foot of the Arabian peninsula with its
petroleum treasures and proximity to the Islamic tur
bulence of Iran.
Ismail's apparent demise was v ievved with particu
lar interest, because it came as the United States
seemed headed for a showdown with Iran that could
include a blockade of the Persian Gulf on the other
side of the peninsula. Soviet reconnaisance planes
and ships use South Yemeni facilities at Khoramak
sar and Al Mukalla on the Gulf of Aden to monitor
U.S. ships in the Indian Ocean and the gulf area.
Although considered less dogmatic than Ismail,
Mohammed long has favored South Yemen's close
relations with the Soviet Union and. based on his
past, was not expected to make any radical or im
mediate changes in the strong Soviet military pre
sence accepted by Aden.
Postal Service wants price hike
WASHINGTON — Blaming inflation, the Postal
Service asked approval yesterday to increase charges
for mailing most types of letters from 15 to 20 cents,
effective early next year.
Postmaster General William Bolgersaid the Postal
Service will need new revenue by next February or
March because of rapidly rising labor and energy
costs.
"Had inflation not shot up since May 1978. the
time of our last rate hike, but instead stayed at the
level of that time, we would not today be seeking new
rates. In fact, we could have been able to keep the
current rates in effect until 1982." Bolger told repor
ters.
The rate request, averaging 28 percent higher for
the various types of mail, went to the Postal Rate
Commission. The commission can hold up to 10
months of hearings on the request before recom
mending new rates. After that, the Postal Service
board must give final approval before the new rates
take effect.
Bolger pledged new efforts to improve productiv -
ity and said without these steps the letter rate would
have had to go to 22 cents.
Less Olympic nationalism urged
LAUSANNE. Switzerland — Olympic leaders
were urged yesterday to take some of the nationalism
out of the Olympics in an effort to get as many nations
as possible to compete in the Moscow Games.
Three days of talks, involving the executive board
of the International Olympic Committee and the In
ternational Sports Federations began with discussion
of dropping national flags and anthems from Olympic
ceremonies.
Most Western European countries still have not
decided whether to follow the United States lead and
boycott the Moscow Games because of Soviet inter
vention in Afghanistan.
Some are reported ready to send their athletes if
there were less nationalism and the opening cere
mony offered less propaganda value to the Russians.
Olympic leaders from Britain, Italy. Belgium and
Liechtenstein had a working lunch with the lOC
executive board and pressed for the defusing of
nationalism in the Games. Sir Denis Follows, presi
dent of the British Olympic Association, said:
"We reminded them that under the rules, the
Olympics are contests between Athletes and not bet
ween nations. We all agreed that everything should
be done to see that the Games are held in the correct
Olympic spirit."
The British association is one of the few Olympic
Committees in Western Europe which is firmly com
mitted to competing in Moscow.
