# Secretaries settle on unfair practices claim
## 
### Chris Mills Staff Writer 
Office and clerical workers at Stan
ford Linear Accelerator Center
claimed a victory for their organizing
efforts yesterday, after the University
agreed to settlement of an unfair labor
practices claim.
University officials denied any
wrongdoing.
Eighteen secretaries at SI. AC filed a
claim last August with the National

Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that
they were illegally ordered to stay away
from meetings of the SLAC Women's
Association because they were clas
sified as supervisors, not employees.
The National Labor Relations Act for
bids supervisors from participating in
organizing activities.
The settlement requires the Univer
sity to post notices for 60 days at SLAC
saying, "We will not do anything that
interferes" with the right of employees

to organize, nor "threaten" or "inter
rogate" employees regarding their
union activities.
"We settled mainly so we would not
have to go through a lengthy adminis
trative hearing." associate University
staff counsel Priscilla Wheeler said.
She pointed out that the agreement
explicitly states that the University
does not admit to any violation of the
law.
Bernie Lighthouse, assistant director
of personnel at SLAC, said that accord
ing to NLRB definitions, secretaries
whose job descriptions include "super
visory" powers are classified as super
visors.
"I was I could not discuss with
anyone anything about unions and that
I was not to set foot in the Women's
Association area," SLAC secretary
Mary Lou Arnold said. She denied hav
ing supervisory powers and said that
she did not receive a supervisor's sal
ary.
"They thought we could be intimi
dated because we are women," Office
Staff Organizing Committee (OSOC)
chair Joyce Tipps-Coats said. The
committee was formed last July to push
for a clerical workers' bargaining unit
within the United Stanford Employees.
According to NLRB rules, OSOC
needs the signatures of at least 30 per
cent of the University's 2000 clerical
workers for a certifying election to be
held.

"Organizing will be easier all around
the University" as a result of the set
tlement, SLAC secretary Tipps-Coats
said. "We are getting very close to fil
ing" for certification as a bargaining
unit, she added.
"People who have been intimi
dated" will realize the organizing effort
is legal, said SLAC administrative as
sistant Jan Adams, a secretary at the
time of the filing. She said secretaries
should not bel ieve bosses who tell them
they cannot organize because they are
supervisors. Only the NLRB can de
cide who is a supervisor, she said.
Gail Hanson, SLAC physicist, said
the Women's Association was never
involved in organizing, but only invited
organizers to speak at meetings. She
said the group was formed to explore
women's issues after a 1976 survey
showed women's wages lagging behind
men's.
OSOC member and Stanford Medi
cal Center secretary Natalie Fisher said
the women's movement and inflation
have helped to remove a traditional
anti-union bias among office workers.
"Secretaries have found they can no
longer live on the wages they get" and
so are demanding higher pay, she said.
In a related matter, Arnold said she
has filed a charge of sex discrimination
in the University's pension plan, which
she said pays 10 percent less to women
than to men who earn the same wage.
