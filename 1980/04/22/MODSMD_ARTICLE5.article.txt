# Outgoing COP ranks job manuals as top accomplishment
## 
### Victor Goetz Staff Writer 
For the first time this spring, the in
coming Council of Presidents should
have detailed job descriptions availa
ble when it takes office.

News analysis

The current COP — which "had to
start from scratch" — considers this
project to provide information to its
successor among its most significant
achievements.
"When we came into the office, no

thing was written down about the func
tion of COP members except what was
in the ASSLJ bylaws and the constitu
tion," ASSU co-president Tom Gart
said.
After last year's election, Gart said
he only learned he was head of a legal
services committee when another
member called about an upcoming
meeting.
So during their term, COP members
Sibby Freeman, Laura Mead, Mary
Leßlanc and Gart concentrated on im
provement of ASSU operation re
cords. Currently, they are working on
operations manuals for COP members
and ASSU project members.

"One test of a good COP is how well
following slates carry through on its is
sues. Included in this is how well infor
mation was documented and defined
for the next slate," Freeman said.
The outgoing COP lists among its
other achievements the Coffee Mouse
contract, establishment of the Theatre
Guild, plans for an award given to a
faculty/staff member for service to stu
dents, election reform proposals, estab
lishment of a Minority Coordinating
Committee and the development of a
stronger mutual respect between
ASSU and the administration.
According to Mead, the COP was
"intimately involved" in what she

termed the "big year of change for Tre
sidder." In addition to the ASSU'ssuc
cessful Coffee House bid, the COP as
sisted in drawing up the terms of the
contract.
On a larger scale. Mead served on a
commission investigating Tresidder
Union and its future. She also was a
member of the screening committee
which selected new Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim.
Mead also helped initiate the con
solidation of campus drama groups into
a Theatre Guild.
"We tried to set up a coalition of
theater organizations to get jointly held
equipment, a costume bank and a prop

bank, so dorm shows, for example,
wouldn't have to develop resources
every time," she said.
One of Freeman's concerns was
minority affairs. He described the es
tablishment of a minority leaders coali
tion, and last week's passage of the
binding resolution to end the mascot
controversy, as two major ac
complishments in this area.
Although the election reform prop
osal Freeman's slate originally sup
ported last spring failed, an election
reform measure was approved by vot
ers last week. The proposal did not con
tain the districting option — dividing
the campus into voting districts —

suggested last spring.
"We had reservations about district
ing. But we felt last year the need for
some sort of election reform and re
form was more important than the dis
tricting element." Gart said.
The most significant ASSU reform
already in effect is in the committee
structure. This year, some members
appointed to University committees
will serve two-year terms instead of the
one-year term of the past.
"It takes six months to learn a com
mittee, so the student body only gets six
months of usefulness from the one
year members. The two-year term flat
tens the learning curve. That will have a
large affect on student effectiveness,"
Freeman said.
A project still under consideration is
the establishment of an ASSU ad
ministration award to complement the
Dinkelspiel and Gores honors.
This award would be given to the
faculty or staff member judged to have
best served students outside the clas
sroom.
All told, last spring's Freeman-
Mead-Leßlanc-Gart slate listed 20
planks.
"There are very few things we said,
that we didn't do at least something
about," Gart said. "And this is because
most of what we had written down was
just a natural extension of our in
terests."
Some of the projects the slate was
unable to complete included develop
ing a written long-range plan of goals
and finances for the ASSU, and three
plans which turned out to be less feasi
ble than expected — a year-round
Lake Lagunita, an off-campus living
workshop, and a lobbying group
among Bay area schools.
The COP also was unable to com
plete a written ranking of long- and
short-term ASSU priorities. Slate
members expressed hope that the new
COP will finish the list.
The plan for a lake filled year-round
was prohibitive because of cost. "With
the University tightening its belt on
spending wherever it can, a year-round
lake just ranked as one of its lower
priorities." Mead said.
The COP did initiate plans for mak
ing off-campus students feel less iso
lated from the campus community, but
the workshop did not materialize.
Mead said.
Efforts to organize a Bay area as
sociation of student governments re
vealed a too-great difference in the
main concerns of private and state
schools. However, the COP has tried to
set up a conference among private
schools.

A Pac-10 conference convened at
the start of this quarter for a discussion
of athletic issues, hut covering "every
thing from bottle bans to academic
eligibility," will probably become an
annual event, Gart said.
The present C'Ol' also decided to
make participation in the Little Eleven
conference with Ivy League schools a
regular, but not annual occurrence.
Stanford attended last year and served
as a valuable resource for less
developed student governments at
some Eastern schools. Mead said.
For the first time this spring, the in
coming Council of Presidents should
have detailed job descriptions availa
ble when it takes office.

just a natural extension of our in
terests."
Some of the projects the slate was
unable to complete included develop
ing a written long-range plan of goals
and finances for the ASSU, and three
plans which turned out to be less feasi
ble than expected — a year-round
Lake Lagunita, an off-campus living
workshop, and a lobbying group
among Bay area schools.
The COP also was unable to com
plete a written ranking of long- and
short-term ASSU priorities. Slate
members expressed hope that the new
COP will finish the list.
The plan for a lake filled year-round
was prohibitive because of cost. "With
the University tightening its belt on
spending wherever it can, a year-round
lake just ranked as one of its lower
priorities." Mead said.
The COP did initiate plans for mak
ing off-campus students feel less iso
lated from the campus community, but
the workshop did not materialize.
Mead said.
Efforts to organize a Bay area as
sociation of student governments re
vealed a too-great difference in the
main concerns of private and state
schools. However, the COP has tried to
set up a conference among private
schools.

A Pac-10 conference convened at
the start of this quarter for a discussion
of athletic issues, hut covering "every
thing from bottle bans to academic
eligibility," will probably become an
annual event, Gart said.
The present C'Ol' also decided to
make participation in the Little Eleven
conference with Ivy League schools a
regular, but not annual occurrence.
Stanford attended last year and served
as a valuable resource for less
developed student governments at
some Eastern schools. Mead said.
For the first time this spring, the in
coming Council of Presidents should
have detailed job descriptions availa
ble when it takes office.

News analysis

The current COP — which "had to
start from scratch" — considers this
project to provide information to its
successor among its most significant
achievements.
"When we came into the office, no

thing was written down about the func
tion of COP members except what was
in the ASSLJ bylaws and the constitu
tion," ASSU co-president Tom Gart
said.
After last year's election, Gart said
he only learned he was head of a legal
services committee when another
member called about an upcoming
meeting.
So during their term, COP members
Sibby Freeman, Laura Mead, Mary
Leßlanc and Gart concentrated on im
provement of ASSU operation re
cords. Currently, they are working on
operations manuals for COP members
and ASSU project members.

"One test of a good COP is how well
following slates carry through on its is
sues. Included in this is how well infor
mation was documented and defined
for the next slate," Freeman said.
The outgoing COP lists among its
other achievements the Coffee Mouse
contract, establishment of the Theatre
Guild, plans for an award given to a
faculty/staff member for service to stu
dents, election reform proposals, estab
lishment of a Minority Coordinating
Committee and the development of a
stronger mutual respect between
ASSU and the administration.
According to Mead, the COP was
"intimately involved" in what she

termed the "big year of change for Tre
sidder." In addition to the ASSU'ssuc
cessful Coffee House bid, the COP as
sisted in drawing up the terms of the
contract.
On a larger scale. Mead served on a
commission investigating Tresidder
Union and its future. She also was a
member of the screening committee
which selected new Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim.
Mead also helped initiate the con
solidation of campus drama groups into
a Theatre Guild.
"We tried to set up a coalition of
theater organizations to get jointly held
equipment, a costume bank and a prop

bank, so dorm shows, for example,
wouldn't have to develop resources
every time," she said.
One of Freeman's concerns was
minority affairs. He described the es
tablishment of a minority leaders coali
tion, and last week's passage of the
binding resolution to end the mascot
controversy, as two major ac
complishments in this area.
Although the election reform prop
osal Freeman's slate originally sup
ported last spring failed, an election
reform measure was approved by vot
ers last week. The proposal did not con
tain the districting option — dividing
the campus into voting districts —

suggested last spring.
"We had reservations about district
ing. But we felt last year the need for
some sort of election reform and re
form was more important than the dis
tricting element." Gart said.
The most significant ASSU reform
already in effect is in the committee
structure. This year, some members
appointed to University committees
will serve two-year terms instead of the
one-year term of the past.
"It takes six months to learn a com
mittee, so the student body only gets six
months of usefulness from the one
year members. The two-year term flat
tens the learning curve. That will have a
large affect on student effectiveness,"
Freeman said.
A project still under consideration is
the establishment of an ASSU ad
ministration award to complement the
Dinkelspiel and Gores honors.
This award would be given to the
faculty or staff member judged to have
best served students outside the clas
sroom.
All told, last spring's Freeman-
Mead-Leßlanc-Gart slate listed 20
planks.
"There are very few things we said,
that we didn't do at least something
about," Gart said. "And this is because
most of what we had written down was
just a natural extension of our in
terests."
Some of the projects the slate was
unable to complete included develop
ing a written long-range plan of goals
