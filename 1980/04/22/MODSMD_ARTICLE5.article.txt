For the first time this spring, the in
coming Council of Presidents should
have detailed job descriptions availa
ble when it takes office.

News analysis

The current COP — which "had to
start from scratch" — considers this
project to provide information to its
successor among its most significant
achievements.
"When we came into the office, no

thing was written down about the func
tion of COP members except what was
in the ASSLJ bylaws and the constitu
tion," ASSU co-president Tom Gart
said.
After last year's election, Gart said
he only learned he was head of a legal
services committee when another
member called about an upcoming
meeting.
So during their term, COP members
Sibby Freeman, Laura Mead, Mary
Leßlanc and Gart concentrated on im
provement of ASSU operation re
cords. Currently, they are working on
operations manuals for COP members
and ASSU project members.

"One test of a good COP is how well
following slates carry through on its is
sues. Included in this is how well infor
mation was documented and defined
for the next slate," Freeman said.
The outgoing COP lists among its
other achievements the Coffee Mouse
contract, establishment of the Theatre
Guild, plans for an award given to a
faculty/staff member for service to stu
dents, election reform proposals, estab
lishment of a Minority Coordinating
Committee and the development of a
stronger mutual respect between
ASSU and the administration.
According to Mead, the COP was
"intimately involved" in what she

termed the "big year of change for Tre
sidder." In addition to the ASSU'ssuc
cessful Coffee House bid, the COP as
sisted in drawing up the terms of the
contract.
On a larger scale. Mead served on a
commission investigating Tresidder
Union and its future. She also was a
member of the screening committee
which selected new Tresidder Director
Ellie Oppenheim.
Mead also helped initiate the con
solidation of campus drama groups into
a Theatre Guild.
"We tried to set up a coalition of
theater organizations to get jointly held
equipment, a costume bank and a prop

bank, so dorm shows, for example,
wouldn't have to develop resources
every time," she said.
One of Freeman's concerns was
minority affairs. He described the es
tablishment of a minority leaders coali
tion, and last week's passage of the
binding resolution to end the mascot
controversy, as two major ac
complishments in this area.
Although the election reform prop
osal Freeman's slate originally sup
ported last spring failed, an election
reform measure was approved by vot
ers last week. The proposal did not con
tain the districting option — dividing
the campus into voting districts —

suggested last spring.
"We had reservations about district
ing. But we felt last year the need for
some sort of election reform and re
form was more important than the dis
tricting element." Gart said.
The most significant ASSU reform
already in effect is in the committee
structure. This year, some members
appointed to University committees
will serve two-year terms instead of the
one-year term of the past.
"It takes six months to learn a com
mittee, so the student body only gets six
months of usefulness from the one
year members. The two-year term flat
