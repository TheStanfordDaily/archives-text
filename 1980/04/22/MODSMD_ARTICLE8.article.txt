# $6 million boost in capital outlays asked
## 
### Michael Weiss Staff Writer 
A recent University report recom
mends that Stanford spend $6 million
more annually from operating budget
funds on capital expenditures, includ
ing major physical plant maintenance
and construction.
The report, entitled "Facilities Plan
and Capital Funding Forecast: 1979 to
1985," is the fifth in a yearly series
prepared by the Office of Business and
Finance and the Provost's Office.
"By recognizing this future capital
demand now and beginning to take ap
propriate actions, we will be able to
avoid a capital crisis some 20 years
hence," the report said.
President Richard Lyman said the
report "makes a significant beginning
at altering the way we approach our
facility's future through the budget
process."
The University currently allocates

about $3 million in general funds to
ward the maintenance of the Universi
ty's academic facilities. The report
suggests that about $9 million be allo
cated for that purpose.
Differing greatly with the report's
recommendations, the University cur
rently plans to increase allocations of
capital expenditures by $250,000 an
nually for the next five years. It also
expects the Medical School to give
about $1 million annually toward its
own renovation by 1985.
But the report notes that these funds
combined would still be about $3 mill
ion short of the money the University
would need to maintain its physical
plant.
A major reason for the need to in
crease funds for physical maintenance
and construction is the decline in ex
ternal funds.
Bridget Morgan, a planner-analyit
in the University Facilities Office, said

"the decrease in government funds,
along with a shortage of funds from
other once-reliable outside agents, has
made it impossible for the University to
maintain old practices."
Relying mainly on University funds
for renovation and maintenance would
be a sharp departure from past prac
tices, the report said. "It has been cus
tomary for colleges and universities to
depend heavily upon gifts and govern
ment funding to erect their physical
plant," it continued.
"Stanford has followed this pattern
throughout most of its history. Rela
tively few operating budget funds have
been allocated to renewal of the capital
worth of the physical plant," the report
stated.
According to Morgan, one of the au
thors of the report, "This is the first
year the report focused in-depth on the
aging of the physical plant of the
school.

"The report stresses that building
systems have finite lives, and that they
need constant maintenance for them to
remain usable," Morgan added. "This
fact is especially noticeable at Stanford,
where many of the buildings are quite
old."
Here, as well as at many other col
leges around the country, there seems
to be a new trend toward the renewal of
old buildings, rather than construction
of new ones, Morgan said.
In the past, the report explains, the
genera) practice has been to construct
a building and then make no further
reinvestment in it. Recently, however,
the University seems to have been
more concerned with renovation: in
1978-79, for example, the University
replaced the entire plumbing system of
Toyon Hall, built in 1924.
Along with the simple fact that build
ings age, the greater sophistication of
today's technological research also
contributes to the need for renovation.
According to the report," Recent re
search requires greater degrees of air
cleanliness and purity. The general
shift is toward research in technology
areas that are increasingly more de
manding of environmental controls."
At the 13-year-old Herrin biology
building, for example, the University
recently undertook $70,000 in lab re
novations to meet new federal DNA
research standards.
If the renovation of old buildings
does become a priority, the report says,
"it is reasonable to project that 2 per
cent of the University's space will re
quire replacement or major renovation
each year."
In terms of actual space, this percen
tage amounts to I SO,OOO square feet;
at a cost of $75 per square foot, the
University would have to set aside
$13.5 million annually for reinvest
ment. This higher figure includes hos
pital and clinical renovations, added to
they million the reports recommend
lor renewal of buildings in the rest of
the University.

"the decrease in government funds,
along with a shortage of funds from
other once-reliable outside agents, has
made it impossible for the University to
maintain old practices."
Relying mainly on University funds
for renovation and maintenance would
be a sharp departure from past prac
tices, the report said. "It has been cus
tomary for colleges and universities to
depend heavily upon gifts and govern
ment funding to erect their physical
plant," it continued.
"Stanford has followed this pattern
throughout most of its history. Rela
tively few operating budget funds have
been allocated to renewal of the capital
worth of the physical plant," the report
stated.
According to Morgan, one of the au
thors of the report, "This is the first
year the report focused in-depth on the
aging of the physical plant of the
school.

"The report stresses that building
systems have finite lives, and that they
need constant maintenance for them to
remain usable," Morgan added. "This
fact is especially noticeable at Stanford,
where many of the buildings are quite
old."
Here, as well as at many other col
leges around the country, there seems
to be a new trend toward the renewal of
old buildings, rather than construction
of new ones, Morgan said.
In the past, the report explains, the
genera) practice has been to construct
a building and then make no further
reinvestment in it. Recently, however,
the University seems to have been
more concerned with renovation: in
1978-79, for example, the University
replaced the entire plumbing system of
Toyon Hall, built in 1924.
Along with the simple fact that build
ings age, the greater sophistication of
today's technological research also
contributes to the need for renovation.
According to the report," Recent re
search requires greater degrees of air
cleanliness and purity. The general
shift is toward research in technology
areas that are increasingly more de
manding of environmental controls."
At the 13-year-old Herrin biology
building, for example, the University
recently undertook $70,000 in lab re
novations to meet new federal DNA
research standards.
If the renovation of old buildings
does become a priority, the report says,
"it is reasonable to project that 2 per
cent of the University's space will re
quire replacement or major renovation
each year."
In terms of actual space, this percen
tage amounts to I SO,OOO square feet;
at a cost of $75 per square foot, the
University would have to set aside
$13.5 million annually for reinvest
ment. This higher figure includes hos
pital and clinical renovations, added to
they million the reports recommend
lor renewal of buildings in the rest of
the University.
A recent University report recom
mends that Stanford spend $6 million
more annually from operating budget
funds on capital expenditures, includ
ing major physical plant maintenance
and construction.
The report, entitled "Facilities Plan
and Capital Funding Forecast: 1979 to
1985," is the fifth in a yearly series
prepared by the Office of Business and
Finance and the Provost's Office.
"By recognizing this future capital
demand now and beginning to take ap
propriate actions, we will be able to
avoid a capital crisis some 20 years
hence," the report said.
President Richard Lyman said the
report "makes a significant beginning
at altering the way we approach our
facility's future through the budget
process."
The University currently allocates

about $3 million in general funds to
ward the maintenance of the Universi
ty's academic facilities. The report
suggests that about $9 million be allo
cated for that purpose.
Differing greatly with the report's
recommendations, the University cur
rently plans to increase allocations of
capital expenditures by $250,000 an
nually for the next five years. It also
expects the Medical School to give
about $1 million annually toward its
own renovation by 1985.
But the report notes that these funds
combined would still be about $3 mill
ion short of the money the University
would need to maintain its physical
plant.
A major reason for the need to in
crease funds for physical maintenance
and construction is the decline in ex
ternal funds.

in the University Facilities Office, said
