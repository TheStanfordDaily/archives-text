# Kennedy edges Carter
## Bush upsets Reagan in Penn.

The Los Angeles Times
PHILADELPHIA — Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) appeared to have
won a narrow victory over President
Jimmy Carter early today in the
Pennsylvania primary, boosting his
hopes of carrying his candidacy to the
floor of the Democratic National Con
vention.
On the Republican side, George
Bush defeated Ronald Reagan in a
presidential preference contest, an
election Bush couldn't afford to lose.
This result was not binding on Pennsyl
vania's 83-member delegation to the
GOP convention, which was chosen in
a separate vote.
With the help of heavy support from
Philadelphia and its suburbs, Kennedy
took the lead in early returns and told
happy supporters shortly before mid
night: "It appears like we have won a
narrow victory and so we want to thank
all the voters of Pennsylvania."
But the outcome remained in doubt
into the early hours today. And at one
point Carter seemed on the verge of
moving ahead because the National
Election Service, which conducted the
vote tally, double counted the voters in
Pittsburgh and surrounding Allegheny
county, a Carter stronghold.

With returns from 90 percent of the
precincts, Kennedy had 47 percent ot
the vote to 45 for Carter. California
Gov. Jerry Brown, who dropped out of
the race after his loss in Wisconsin
three weeks ago but whose name re
mained on the ballot, took 2 percent.
And another 6 percent of the voters,
reflecting the general negativism that
pervaded the campaign here, simply
cast their ballots for no preference.
This was the actual vote:
— Kennedy 668,417
— Carter 647,893
—Brown 34,564
—"No Preference" 83,054
54 to 45
In the Republican contest, returns
from 90 percent of the precincts gave
Bush 54 percent of the vote to 45 per
cent for Reagan. Rep. John Anderson,
whose name was not on the ballot, got 1
percent in a write-in vote.
The Republican vote total:
— Bush 537,435
— Reagan 454,052
— Anderson 12,636.
Bush rode a million-dollar media
campaign to a desperately needed win
over the front-runner in Pennsylvania's

non-binding preference poll. Reagan,
however, was expected to pick up
about 50 of the 77 technically uncom
mitted district delegates elected sepa
rately yesterday, to add to the collec
tion that has brought him more than
halfway to nomination.
Vital
But, for Bush, who had won only
three of the 14 previous primaries,
compared with Reagan's 11, last
night's victory was vital to sustain his
admittedly underdog effort to derail
the Reagan bandwagon.
Bush told several hundred suppor
ters in his home city of Houston Tues
day night he was "very, very pleased"
with the results and said, "We're going
to keep doing what we've been doing.
We're going to keep hammering at the
key issues . . . and the sometimes con
tradictory ideas of my opponent."
Reagan's managers had hoped to
remove Bush as the last challenger to
his nomination in Pennsylvania, and
that objective was not achieved.
Kennedy began pointing toward
Pennsylvania immediately following
his upset victories last month in the
New York and Connecticut primaries.

Despite subsequent losses to Carter
in the April 1 Wisconsin and Kansas
primaries, Kennedy contended that
Pennsylvania would mark a decisive
turning point in the Democratic race,
where he would begin gaining ground
on the president on his way to winning
the nomination at the Democratic con
vention in New York in August.
As a result of this strategy, Kennedy
concentrated his campaigning during
the last three weeks in Pennsylvania, a
large, industrial state with almost 3
million registered Democrats. Cros
sover voting — a factor in Wisconsin
and some other states — was not al
lowed here.
Crisscrossing the state, Kennedy
hammered away at administration
economic policies. At one of his last
campaign appearances in the state on
Monday, He seized on the president's
prediction at a news conference last
week that the recession would be"mild
and short."
The Carter campaign countered the
Kennedy drive by pouring surrogates
such as Vice President Walter Mondale
into the state and increasing its spend
ing for paid advertising.
