# Price high for American military access to Somalia
## 
### Michael Getler The Washington Post 
The government of Somalia is putting a high
price tag — much higher than the Carter administ
ration wants to pay — on allowing U.S. military
access to ports and airfields in that strategically
located country on the Indian Ocean.
Somalia is one of three countries in the region —
others are Kenya and Oman — where the ad
ministration is trying to gain footholds that would
make it easier to sustain American naval and air
power near the volatile and oil-rich Persian Gulf.
Impressive facilities
The port and airfield facilities in Somalia, built
by the Soviets before the Somali government
kicked them out in late 1977, are the most impres
sive in that chain of outposts.
U.S. officials say, however, that the Somalis are
asking five times the amount of military and
economic assistance currently being offered by the
administration as part of a package deal.
Furthermore, the Somalis want the United
States to supply modern air defense weapons such
as the Chaparral antiaircraft missile and the mobile
Vulcan antiaircraft gun as part of the aid agree
ment, items that could add to concern among other
African nations already nervous over the actions of
the controversial Somali President, Mohammed
Siad Barre.
Search for military access
The administration search for places where it
could arrange some limited military access began
following the seizure last November of the U.S.
embassy in Iran, and took on added urgency after
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan late in De
cember.
All three countries have agreed in principle to
allow the expanded U.S. access to air and sea
facilities in return for some U.S. help. Negotiations
with Oman and Kenya to arrange the details are
said to be going reasonably well.
But the negotiations with Somalia, officials say,
could take several months more, pushing a final
agreement, if one is reached, into the fall rather'
than this spring as originally planned.

One State Department official, who says he is
not as pessimistic about the situation as some
others, says the Somalis still make clear they want
the United States to come into the region and that
they have not put their aid requirements forward
on the basis that they must be met or else no deal.
Rather, he believes, the Somalis feel the United
States can do anything it wants to do. He also
thinks they are influenced by the memory of the
vast amounts of aid that the Soviets poured in there
very quickly before 1977.
The administration has not yet made public the
overall cost of the quest for these new bases. In
formed sources say, however, that the package of
aid for all three countries totals about $90 or $100
million. Somalia, sources say. would get about 35
to 40 percent of that under the current plan. The
Somalis' request for aid at five times that level
means they are seeking on the order of $175 mill
ion.
Facilities modernized
Aside from aid, the administration is planning on
spending an estimated $250 million to repair and
modernize facilities in the three countries, sources
say.
A greatly expanded aid request for Somalia
would undoubtedly have trouble on Capitol Hill.
Though Barre threw out the Soviets and has de
veloped closer ties to Saudi Arabia and Egypt,
there has always been concern among critics here
and abroad that the mercurial president could
somehow drag the United States into an African
war or make it appear that Washington was sup
porting a government unpopular elsewhere in Af
rica.
Somalia continues to give military support to
insurgents fighting in the disputed Ogaden desert
against the Soviet-backed regime in neighboring
Ethiopia.
Twice before in recent years, the United States
has edged toward a military relationship with
Somalia, including supplying arms, but pulled back
when regular Somali troops entered the fighting.
As congressional sources understood it, the cur
rent military aid package initially included so
called non-lethal items such as trucks, radars and
radios.
