# Law students here belly up to the bar
## 
### Tom Harrel Staff Writer 
Law students here appear de
termined to prove that there is
indeed life after the LSAT by or
ganizing the Stanford Bar Re
view, which meets every Thurs
day night to review local water
ing holes.
The Stanford Bar Review was
first formed in September of
1978 by Jill Matichak, a third
year law student. Since that time
the membership of the Bar Re
view has continued to grow. This
year the Bar Review has about
40 regular members, although
membership is open to "just
about anyone who shows up;"
according to Anthony Chavez,
Vice-President for Public Rela
tions.
Last Thursday night the Bar
Review gathered at Antonio's
Nuthouse for a review. By 1 1
p.m. about 30 Review members
were present, and the bi-weekly
ritual of beer drinking, joking
and pool playing was in full
swing. The meetings usually
begin around 10 p.m., when Bar
Review President Howard Ka
mins arrives, and continue until
the bar closes.
For anyone harboring an
image of Stanford law students
as unrelentingly studious, an

evening with the Stanford Bar
Review would be surprising. Al
though members discussed some
business, the general topics of
conversation were parties, sports
and beer, "Stanford has a much
more relaxed atmosphere than
most law schools, all irmed Vice
President for Protocol John
Shyer. "The Bar Review is part
of that.''
According to Anthony
C'havcz, the Bar Review has two
goals — to obtain "the biggest
drunk for the buck" and "to have
more vice-presidents than the
Environmental Law Society." In
fact, every member except
Kamns is a vice president, includ
ing such titles as Vice President
for Conspicuous Consumption,
Vice President for Quick Flings,
and Vice President for Vice Pres
idents.
So far this year the Bar Review
has visited about 12 bars. Favo
rites among the members include
the Bucket, Chuck's Cellar, and
Forty-Second Street. Results
from the reviews are spread by
word of mouth.
As Chavez concluded, "Any
one interested in the Bar Review
or just hav ing a good time is wel
come." If you have been con
templating law school, check
them out.
