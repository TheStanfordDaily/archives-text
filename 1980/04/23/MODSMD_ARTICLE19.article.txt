## Reagan- he's got a deal for you! 
### 
"Hi there folks! My name is
Ronnie Reagan and have I got a
deal ioxyou. Just come on down
to your friendly neighborhood
polling place and check out some
of the deals. No matter what
your needs are. I've got the car
for you.
"How about this one: It's only
nine years old. and it still runs

like new."
The 1971 Domestic Oil
model. "In 1971. government
got into the energy business. If
you buy this car. I'll get the gov -
ernment out of the energy busi
ness and leave the oil companies
alone. Then we won't have to
buy any more oil from OPEC. I
know it's true, because the
greatest petroleum geologists
have told me so."
(According to the American
Petroleum Institute, if all the
economically recoverable oil in
the United States were being dril
led, the production increase
would be only four million bar
rels per day, or half of current
import levels.)
The California Welfare Re

form model. "1 took the welfare
capital of the nation and almost
instantly turned a $40,000-a
-month increase in the welfare
rolls an $8000-a-month de
crease. And 1 saved the tax
payers $2 billion while increas
ing grants to the needy by 43
percent."
(According to the California

legislative analyst's office, the av
erage increase in welfare rolls was
$26,000 a month and the later
decrease $3500 a month. Over a
four year period, the estimated
savings were close to $40 million,
and the increase in benefits was
23 percent.)
The 1859 More Oil Than You
Think model- "There is more oil
in the United States yet to be
found than we have so far
pumped in the 120 years since
we first drilled an oil well in
Titusville, Pennsylvania, in
1859. And I'll see to it that we
get that oil!"
(According to the U.S. Geolog
ical Survey, production since
1859 has been 106 billion bar
rels. There are 39 billion barrels

of proven reserves left in the
ground, with a "best guess' of 82
billion barrels of potential re
serves. Ignoring all economic fac
tors, available technology can re
cover no more than 60 percent
unless there is a tremendous
breakthrough.)
"But folks, really, these are
only some of the deals 1 have for
you. Look at government regula
tions; that's where our problem
lies in this country. Just look at
what 1 can do for you:"
The Give the Land Back to the
States model. "As much as SO or
90 percent of the western states
are owned by the federal gov
ernment. And of course. Alaska,
for example — if you count the
part of Alaska that actually is
under state control— is a smaller
state than Rhode Island."
(According to the U.S. Interior
Department, about 80,000
square miles in Alaska are under
state and private control. That
represents an area 65 times the
size of Rhode Island.)
"And listen to some of the per
formance statistics on these
cars:"
The HEW Overhead model.
"Just look at how some of the
money is being misspent in this
country. It costs HEW S3 in
overhead to deliver SI to a needy
person in this country."
(According to HEW, the cor
rect amount is not $3, but 12
cents.)
The High Taxes Equal Crime
model. "History shows that
when the taxes of a nation ap

proach about 20 percent of the
people's income, there begins to
be a lack of respect for govern
ment. When it hits 25 percent,
there comes an increase in law
lessness."
(Many European nations have
long had tax rales far higher than
those in the United States, with
lower crime statistics.)
"There's never any need to
fear that we'll sell out of any
model here at Ronnie Reagan's
Used Cars. There are always
plenty more where these came
from. How does a 30 percent tax
cut with increased defense
spending and reduced inflation
sound?
"So hop in your car and drive
on down to your nearest polling
booth; I'm sure we can work out
a deal for you!"
Would you buy a used car from
this man?
