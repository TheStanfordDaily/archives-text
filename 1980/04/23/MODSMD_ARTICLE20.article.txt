## Band rallies The Knack 
### 
For some unknown reason I find myself awake at
the ungodly hour of 11 this morning. 1 don't know
about all of you math and science clones, but for us
humanities majors 11 a.m. on a Friday is like
beyond cosmic reality.
Who am 1? Why am 1? Sometimes I even wonder
"What am 1?" I am a clone. I am a sheep. 1 am a
member of the Incomparable Leland Stanford Jr.
University Marching Band (LSJUMB) alias skin
band for spring quarter.
By now my mind as well as my body has begun to
function. A sealed envelope is slid under my
dorm-room door. This is it: my papers, my mission.
It is written on red paper. (That means it is impor
tant.) It reads. "Report to the band shak by high
noon for further instructions." The orders are not
specific; they simply reveal that we are going to
experience something totally new . . . something
exciting and probably dangerous.
It is 10 until noon and I am at the shak. The shak.
for those of you unfortunates who have never ex
perienced LSJUMB. is the home of the band. It is
the realm where alcohol meets mouth and where
mouth occasionally meets sink.
Our new leader. Steve Pappas, steps up to the
podium. I can't believe my ears! He has announced
that we are going to San Jose Airport to rally The
Knack when they arrive for their concert at Stan
ford! "We've been sold out," screams an irate
bandsman as he realizes that he has cut Petroleum
Engineering for the rally. The Knack, alias New
Wave, is too horrible to comprehend.
Only two groups could be responsible for lower
ing the LSJUMB to play for New Wave fans: the
infamous KOME radio and ASSU Special Events.
Now we realize why there is only beer, instead of
mixed drinks, at the shak.
At 1:05 p.m. we board our bus fashionably late,
hoping that we will arrive at the airport late enough
to have completely missed the band. As we pull
into the terminal we find that we are out of luck:
The Knack will also be fashionably late. We begin

to settle into our hour-long wait in the airport
terminal.
Airports are a favorite playground for the hand.
Where else can you find a veritable plethora of
blond stewardesses in short skirts and a freshly
mowed carpet for playing Frisbee? Unfortunately
the airport security isn't as friendly to the band
when we haven't purchased 150 airline tickets.
Within two minutes a plain-clothed officer (I think
he was the same one who had no neck and was
armed with a bludgeon in Seattle) approached us
and declared. "We know who you are and what you
people do. We're tired of it all. You won't have San
Jose Airport to kick around this time!"
With this he asked us all to act like adults and to
drink our beer outside. What right has he to spoil
our fun? Oh now we see. the three uniformed
officers with big guns behind him give him the right
to ruin our fun.
After an impromptu concert in the airport park
ing lot, our moment has finally arrived. We slowly
work out way through the airport security
checkpoint. As usual the buttons on my band hat
set off the metal detector and I'm busted. 1 can't
help it; I love the sound of the beeper when it goes
off!
As The Knack disembarks from the plane we go
into a poorlv-charted rendition of "My Schar
rona." The Knack gives a polite nod and proceeds
to sign autographs for the multitude of high school
girls gaggling around them. The song ends and we
try,"Living in the U.S.A."
It is hard for Pappas to direct the band when he
can't tell the band members in their rally clothes
from the New Wave fans.
One of the high school girls shyly walks up to our
bass drummer and asks for his autograph. We all
leave the airport in disgust. Disco may suck, but a
New Wave clash of The Knack kind isn't much
better.

member of the Stanford Band.)
