## Create a random primary 
### 
Fred Cheever's spoof of presidential politics
(Daily, April IS) reminded me of something I've
been meaning to say for some time.
Cheever proposed that presidential candidates
list their nomination choices — president, vice
president, national chairman, and so forth — in
order of preference on computer cards and that
national offices be assigned on the basis of a ran
dom draw.
Absurd as this may sound, something like it is
virtually essential to a fair running of primaries. It
is patently absurd that a single group of voters —
say, the registered residents of New Hampshire —
should have the continued influence that they do
over the course of presidential politics in this coun
try. They have this power solely because they vote
first.
Now theoretically, states can hold their primaries
earlier or later. New Hampshire doesn't have to
always be first. This year, for instance, lowa stole
the show by holding an earlier caucus, with candi
dates proclaiming it equivalent to a primary if they
were successful and somehow not a true test of
voter preference if they weren't.
But the bare fact is that first victories, like first
impressions, are hard to break. The decision of
voters in the first primary, caucus or other formal
means of allowing voters to express their party
preferences wields an influence over the course of
presidential politics vastly disproportionate to its
weight in the population as a whole.
There are two ways to remedy this situation. The
first is to randomize the order of primary/caucus
voting in the states for every major election. The
second is to legally prohibit the making of
primary/caucus results public until voting in all the

states is complete. Of the two, the first is superior
because it removes an existing inequity and does
not deny us information. There is good reason,
however, to seriously consider implementing both
alternatives.
It is not necessarily in the interest of an unbiased
democratic process for the public to have im
mediate information about election results. Pre
sently, for instance, there is no constraint on the
government or media as to when results of na
tional, state, or local elections can be released to
the public. As a result, stations begin broadcasting
early results and statistically-based predictions of
final results before all qualified voters have had an
opportunity to cast their ballots. This lack of con
straint allows the real possibility that undecided
voters privy to early returns will be biased by what
others, not they themselves, think about the most
important political decisions they can make.
This open policy unnecessarily biases what could
easily be an unbiased democratic process, and is
especially questionable in a political climate, like
today, where growing numbers of voters are unde
cided as to their preferences.
Two bills should be introduced immediately on
the floor of Congress: one requiringa random draw
to determine the order for holding state primary/
caucuses in presidential elections, and the second
making it illegal for any party to make public the
results of local, state, or national elections or
primary/caucuses before all polls have officially
closed. Only in this way can we be assured that the
sum of votes reflects the unbiased position of each
of us as individuals.
