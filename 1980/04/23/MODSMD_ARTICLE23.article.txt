## Set Anderson's record straight 
### 
Scott Zarrow's {Daily, April
21) unanalyzed assertions and
misinterpretations of John An
derson's policy stances, if popu
larly accepted and left unchal
lenged, could jeopardize the
presidential hopes of the most at
tractive candidate for the Oval
Office in years. To set the record
straight, 1 offer the following
contentions.
Zarrow would have us believe
that abortion, ERA, marijuana
decriminalization and handgun
control are "relatively easy is
sues." Anderson has forcefully
and effectively voiced his views
on these issues and like Zarrow, I
agree with them. But to call these
issues "easy" insults the
Catholics, the National Rifle As

sociation members; the Phyllis
Schlaflysand their opponents ac
ross the nation.
These aren't simply yes/no
questions hut reflect deep and
growing concerns for millions of
Americans. Why has this divided
nation writhed with indecision
for the past decade on all four of
these explosive issues if they are
so "easy?" Anderson's stands on
these issues and others de
monstrate his non-political, tell
'em as I see them approach that
has excited Americans across the
country.
Zarrow elevates the nuclear
power question to a level that he
feels Anderson is unable to reach
with any degree of vision and un
iqueness. Anderson's stand is

considerably more complex than
simply appointing commissions
to explore nuclear waste disposal
as Zarrow asserts.
Had Zarrow read Anderson's
10-point position paper on nuc
lear power, he would have disco
vered that among other propos
als, Anderson proposes to com
pletely restructure the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission, replace
all nuclear power plant operating
licenses with four-year operat
ing permits that will require op
timal safety standards for ap
proval.and place a moratorium
on further licensing until the util
ity can demonstrate compliance
with the new safety standards.
The board Zarrow refers to are
actually four regionally located
Nuclear Waste Management
boards with "authority to select,
build, license and operate tem
porary away-from-reactor stor
age facilities for spent fuel."
Allow me to remind Zarrow
that in the area of taxation and
investment, Anderson co
sponsored the bill to roll back the
capital gains taxation rate from
49 to 28 percent. In addition,
Anderson's 50 cent gasoline tax
idea hardly shows that he is in
capable of proposing specific and
non-bureaucratic solutions.
It is important to bear in mind
that the president doesn't enact
policies: Congress does. The
executive branch can suggest
legislation and twist arms, but it

can't make Congress pass bills.
An unwilling Congress couldn't
pass Ronald Reagan's deregula
tion of oil companies plan any
sooner than a hesitant Congress
would pass Ted Kennedy's na
tional health insurance plan.
Thus, as important as policy
stances are, attributes like hon
esty, integrity, experience, the
ability to compromise and the
ability to lead are crucial and,
indeed, are voting issues. I'm
sure that Zarrow would agree
that Anderson is impeccable in
this area.
Perhaps the most shocking as
sertion was that "Anderson
should learn to take himself and
his candidacy a little less seri
ously." Suggesting this to a vete
ran congresman who has
tirelessly canvassed this nation
espousing his beliefs is an uncal
led for slap in the face to Ander
son and to anyone else who has
been or will be an underdog.
Lest Zarrow forget, Anderson
is not running for president to
satisfy his ego, he is presenting
himself as an attractive alterna
tive to Ronald Reagan and Pres
ident Jimmy Carter. Above all,
as he said during his appearance
here, he is trying to restore
people's faith, interest and activ
ity in the American political sys
tem.
