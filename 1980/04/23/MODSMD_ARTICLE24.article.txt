Report not trite
As an editor of Alternative
Energy Futures, published last
summer by the Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies, I am hopeful
that many people will read the
report and find it informative
and intriguing. Unfortunately,
Sue Goldfarb's summary of the
report (Daily, April 3) made it
sound trite and superficial by dis
torting the report's methodology
and conclusions. I would there
fore like to offer the following
clarification.
First, our scenarios are not
"predictions," as Goldfarb de
scribes; rather they are sketches
of what could occur, given vari
ous combinations of societal val
ues and technological develop
ments.
Second, in order to include
human values in our analysis, an
important innovation in our
study, we established two diver
gent sets of values, Smith and
Green. No individual is com
pletely a Smith or a Green, as
Goldfarb depicts, and the popu
lation profiles she quotes merely
represent the fraction holding
the Smith or Green viewpoint
toward any given topic.
I am especially concerned
about Goldfarb's misinterpreta
tion of the report's conclusions,
which are also explicitly stated
in the summary chapters. The
paraphrase: "Coal will be the
most important energy source in

the United States by the year
2025" is not true! Energy effi
ciency and conservation will be
the most important source. The
energy savings, measured
against a zero-conservation case,
are far greater than the coal use
in all our scenarios.
The increases we project in
coal production are much smal
ler than those of conventional
analysts, whose figures are re
vised downward annually as the
relative merits of conservation
and solar techniques become
more apparent.
Let me close by conceitedly
quoting myself from the report's
primary conclusions: " It appears
feasible to devise an energy sys
tem that mainiains increasing
material amenities and still pre
serves environmental quality.
The key to achieving such an
energy system lies in improving
the efficiency with which energy
resources are utilized." I hope
this explanation will interest
people in reading our report and
inspire them to contribute to our
nation's vital energy conserva
tion efforts.

Not a 'holocaust'
Rev. Don Caughey's refer
ence to the "holocaust experi
enced by Palestinian Arabs"
Don't call Hillel Board

'paranoid'," (Daily, April 18)
was one of the most hyperbolic
misperceptions of the Palesti
nian problem 1 have ever read.
How can one compare the
plight of Palestinians living in re
fugee camps today to the exter
mination of six million Jews and
all of the genocidal characteris
tics of that monumental tragedy?
While 1 staunchly support the
need for a more dovish stand by
the Israeli government in confer
ring autonomy to Palestinian
Arabs on the West Bank, I do so
because I believe the Palesti
nians have needlessly suffered in
the past and that their genuine
nationalistic fervor can't be ig
nored.
Palestinians have never ex
perienced a holocaust (at least
according to standard dictionary
definitions), nor do I think one
needs as compelling a reason as a
holocaust to recognize the
legitimate rights of Palestinians.
I am not contending that the
word holocaust should only be
used in describing the evils of
Hitlerian genocide. The tragedy
of Cambodia, for example, is
unquestionably a modern
holocaust. What I am contend
ing, however, is that Caughey's
use of the word in conjunction
with the Palestinians is danger
ously inappropriate.
