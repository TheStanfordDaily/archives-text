# False finish in Boston?
## Doubts taint Marathon 
### Alan Greenberg 
The Los Angeles Times
BOSTON — When it was over, the nearly 6000
runners looked like characters from "Night of the
Living Dead." But the women's winner seemed
awfully fresh for having just run 26 miles, 385
yards in surprisingly fast time.
Was that because she hadn't? Did Rosie Ruiz,
30, who fled Castro's Cuba in 1961 for New York
City, pull the greatest sting in these parts since the '
Brinks Robbery? Did she hide among the esti
mated one million people who lined the route for
Monday's 84th Boston Marathon, then slip onto
the course undetected somewhere past the 22-mile
mark and cross the finish-line 147 th overall, but
first among the race's 449 women?
"Yes," some runners and track officials said.
"Ouite possibly," said an infuriated Will Cloney,
the Boston Marathon's meet director since 1946.
Definitely not, Ruiz said when questioned nearly
an hour after Gov. Edward King presented her
with a gold medal. Back in her hotel room, be
sieged by visits and calls from reporters, she broke
into tears but continued to deny any impropriety.
The did-she-or-didn't-she fuss over Ruiz thrust
her into the spotlight that had been focused on Bill
Rodgers, 32, who easily won his third straight Bos
ton Marathon — for a total of four— in 2 hours, 12
minutes, 1 1 seconds, a full 2:44 slower than his
record time last year. One difference: Monday's
relatively warm termperatures, in the 70s, com
pared to the 40s a year ago.
"She's a definite phony," said Fred Lebow of
Ruiz. He is president of the New York Roadrun
ners Club and meet director of the New York City
Marathon, the only one Ruiz had run in before
Boston. "She had none of the signs of having won a
marathon. There were no salt stains (from exces
sive sweating) on her face. Her hair wasn't frazzled
in the back like the other women's. Her shirt on the
sides was completely dry."
"1 don't remember seeing her at any time during
the race," said 27-year-old Jacqueline Gareau of
Montreal, who placed second among the women
with a time of 2:34.28.
"Yeah, 1 was surprised, 1 was second place going
into the hills and they told me I was second when 1
crossed the finish line," said the third-place
finisher, local favorite Patti Lyons, 25, of suburban
Quincy.
Malcolm Robinson, the editor of the New York
Running News, charted the top 13 women as they
passed the 22-mile mark and said he did not see
Ruiz.
Ruiz was credited with a time of 2:31.56, better
than last year's record of 2:35.15 set by Maine's
Joan Benoit. The only faster times are by Norway's
Grete Waltz in New York, 2:27.33, and Benoit's
2:31.23 in Aukland, N.Z.
"I can't believe I'm here," Ruiz said after finish
ing. "I was really up for this race but 1 had no idea 1
was No. 1 when 1 crossed the finish line."
Could Ruiz have crashed the party undetected?
Easily. There is no television monitoring of the
entire course and the runners' progress. There are
six stations along the route where meet officials try
to chart the first 100 runners, a formidable task in
which accuracy is difficult. But it's a cinch com
pared to keeping track of the order of women.
Many have slight builds with closely cropped hair,
like Ruiz, and they're often engulfed in the river of
male runners.

Cloney issued a statement about hours after
Rodgers had crossed the finish line expressing
"grave doubts" about Ruiz's victory.
Cloney admitted he knew nothing about the con
troversy until he consulted with officials about 45
minutes after Ruiz had crossed the line. He said
"we have no proof' that would justify reversing the
decision immediately, but there will be an investi
gation with a final decision within the next
fortnight. He said there will be more talks with
officials and an examination of the videotapes of
race segments made by various local TV stations.
Last year there was a flap here when Oscar
Miranda of Tampa, Fla., crossed the finish line first
among masters (men over 40) entrants and claimed
victory. Although there was no proof that he had
sneaked onto the course, Cloney and the Boston
Athletic Association officials disqualified him. He
has stayed away from the more prestigious races
since.
"1 am completely disgusted," Cloney said, "if
the state of amateur athletics is such that we have to
spend our time on incidents like this instead of
rejoicing (Rodgers' feats)"
For the marathoners, there was little visible re
joicing when the ordeal was over. They were
sheparded down eight different chutes and into an
unoccupied parking garage beneath the Prudential
Tower downtown, site of the finish line.
Eyes glazed, hair matted, cheeks hollow, they
silently accepted tinfoil capes (to help retain body
heat) draped on them by volunteers. Then they
wandered off to sit down, or, in some cases, col
lapse. Many marathoners could be seen
spreadeagled on the concrete, oil-stained floor.
The more desperate cases were helped to other
parts of the garage where green army cots were set
up and medical doctors and podiatrists awaited.
Rodgers and Ruiz were each led to an interview
ing area in the garage. Rodgers had collapsed into
the two policemen's arms upon finishing.
There was a loudspeaker hookup, and their blar
ing voice caused some of the more disoriented
marathoners to cover their ears as they wandered
past the interview area on their way to finding a
comfortable concrete pole against which to lean.
"Going up the hills was tougher this year," said
Rodgers. "1 didn't know if 1 was gonna make it or
not... my body was whipped. It was a psychologi
cally tough ordeal, the epitome of a marathon. I
was ahead, but I was dying. I knew I was falling
apart."
Ruiz said she only began serious running 18
months ago, that the Oct. 28, 1979, New York
Marathon had been her first. She finished 23rd
among women competing there.
Lebow wasn't buying any of Ruiz's story. He said
that on Ruiz's New York entry blank she predicted
that her time would be more than four hours. He
said that when he asked what was her fastest mile
time, she said 5:30. That would make her time
Monday somewhat more miraculous than anything
Wonder Woman ever pulled off.
Lebow says none of his contacts in the running
world has ever heard of Ruiz. He said that when he
questioned her about her "splits," she didn't know
what he was talking about. A runner who doesn't
know what a "split" is is roughly akin to a pro
basketball player who never has heard of a 24-
second clock.

to chart the first 100 runners, a formidable task in
which accuracy is difficult. But it's a cinch com
pared to keeping track of the order of women.
Many have slight builds with closely cropped hair,
like Ruiz, and they're often engulfed in the river of
male runners.

Cloney issued a statement about hours after
Rodgers had crossed the finish line expressing
"grave doubts" about Ruiz's victory.
Cloney admitted he knew nothing about the con
troversy until he consulted with officials about 45
minutes after Ruiz had crossed the line. He said
"we have no proof' that would justify reversing the
decision immediately, but there will be an investi
gation with a final decision within the next
fortnight. He said there will be more talks with
officials and an examination of the videotapes of
race segments made by various local TV stations.
Last year there was a flap here when Oscar
Miranda of Tampa, Fla., crossed the finish line first
among masters (men over 40) entrants and claimed
victory. Although there was no proof that he had
sneaked onto the course, Cloney and the Boston
Athletic Association officials disqualified him. He
has stayed away from the more prestigious races
since.
"1 am completely disgusted," Cloney said, "if
the state of amateur athletics is such that we have to
spend our time on incidents like this instead of
rejoicing (Rodgers' feats)"
For the marathoners, there was little visible re
joicing when the ordeal was over. They were
sheparded down eight different chutes and into an
unoccupied parking garage beneath the Prudential
Tower downtown, site of the finish line.
Eyes glazed, hair matted, cheeks hollow, they
silently accepted tinfoil capes (to help retain body
heat) draped on them by volunteers. Then they
wandered off to sit down, or, in some cases, col
lapse. Many marathoners could be seen
spreadeagled on the concrete, oil-stained floor.
The more desperate cases were helped to other
parts of the garage where green army cots were set
up and medical doctors and podiatrists awaited.
Rodgers and Ruiz were each led to an interview
ing area in the garage. Rodgers had collapsed into
the two policemen's arms upon finishing.
There was a loudspeaker hookup, and their blar
ing voice caused some of the more disoriented
marathoners to cover their ears as they wandered
past the interview area on their way to finding a
comfortable concrete pole against which to lean.
"Going up the hills was tougher this year," said
Rodgers. "1 didn't know if 1 was gonna make it or
not... my body was whipped. It was a psychologi
cally tough ordeal, the epitome of a marathon. I
was ahead, but I was dying. I knew I was falling
apart."
Ruiz said she only began serious running 18
months ago, that the Oct. 28, 1979, New York
Marathon had been her first. She finished 23rd
among women competing there.
Lebow wasn't buying any of Ruiz's story. He said
that on Ruiz's New York entry blank she predicted
that her time would be more than four hours. He
said that when he asked what was her fastest mile
time, she said 5:30. That would make her time
Monday somewhat more miraculous than anything
Wonder Woman ever pulled off.
Lebow says none of his contacts in the running
world has ever heard of Ruiz. He said that when he
questioned her about her "splits," she didn't know
what he was talking about. A runner who doesn't
know what a "split" is is roughly akin to a pro
basketball player who never has heard of a 24-
second clock.
The Los Angeles Times
BOSTON — When it was over, the nearly 6000
runners looked like characters from "Night of the
Living Dead." But the women's winner seemed
awfully fresh for having just run 26 miles, 385
yards in surprisingly fast time.
Was that because she hadn't? Did Rosie Ruiz,
30, who fled Castro's Cuba in 1961 for New York
City, pull the greatest sting in these parts since the '
Brinks Robbery? Did she hide among the esti
mated one million people who lined the route for
Monday's 84th Boston Marathon, then slip onto
the course undetected somewhere past the 22-mile
mark and cross the finish-line 147 th overall, but
first among the race's 449 women?
"Yes," some runners and track officials said.
"Ouite possibly," said an infuriated Will Cloney,
the Boston Marathon's meet director since 1946.
Definitely not, Ruiz said when questioned nearly
an hour after Gov. Edward King presented her
with a gold medal. Back in her hotel room, be
sieged by visits and calls from reporters, she broke
into tears but continued to deny any impropriety.
The did-she-or-didn't-she fuss over Ruiz thrust
her into the spotlight that had been focused on Bill
Rodgers, 32, who easily won his third straight Bos
ton Marathon — for a total of four— in 2 hours, 12
minutes, 1 1 seconds, a full 2:44 slower than his
record time last year. One difference: Monday's
relatively warm termperatures, in the 70s, com
pared to the 40s a year ago.
"She's a definite phony," said Fred Lebow of
Ruiz. He is president of the New York Roadrun
ners Club and meet director of the New York City
Marathon, the only one Ruiz had run in before
Boston. "She had none of the signs of having won a
marathon. There were no salt stains (from exces
sive sweating) on her face. Her hair wasn't frazzled
in the back like the other women's. Her shirt on the
sides was completely dry."
"1 don't remember seeing her at any time during
the race," said 27-year-old Jacqueline Gareau of
Montreal, who placed second among the women
with a time of 2:34.28.
"Yeah, 1 was surprised, 1 was second place going
into the hills and they told me I was second when 1
crossed the finish line," said the third-place
finisher, local favorite Patti Lyons, 25, of suburban
Quincy.
Malcolm Robinson, the editor of the New York
Running News, charted the top 13 women as they
passed the 22-mile mark and said he did not see
Ruiz.
Ruiz was credited with a time of 2:31.56, better
than last year's record of 2:35.15 set by Maine's
Joan Benoit. The only faster times are by Norway's
Grete Waltz in New York, 2:27.33, and Benoit's
2:31.23 in Aukland, N.Z.
"I can't believe I'm here," Ruiz said after finish
ing. "I was really up for this race but 1 had no idea 1
was No. 1 when 1 crossed the finish line."
Could Ruiz have crashed the party undetected?
Easily. There is no television monitoring of the
entire course and the runners' progress. There are
six stations along the route where meet officials try
to chart the first 100 runners, a formidable task in
which accuracy is difficult. But it's a cinch com
