## Spikers face Cal in finale 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
Six Card spikers end their col
legiate careers tonight as Stan
ford's men's volleyball team
closes its season against cross
bay rival California. The match is
scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m.
in Berkeley.
It will be the last match for
seniors Frank Anderson, Rod
Fletcher, Jack Foxworth, Tom
Grimes, Kim Lum and John
McColl as Cardinals. Head
coach Fred Sturm noted, "I'm
sure they want to end on a happy
note — and beating Cal will even
make it better."
Stanford pulled out a 3-2 win
against the Bears when the two
squads met here in February, but
Sturm anticipates Cal to be more
anxious this time. "The last time
we met, their short-serving was
really effective. It'll be a typical
Stanford-Cal emotional match.

Berkeley's going to be hungry,"
he said, noting that the Bears ha
ven't won a conference match
this year.
Stanford's tentative lineup in
cludes Foxworth and Lum at the
blocker positions; Grimes,
McColl and Fletcher at the hitter
spots; and Kip Engen at setter.
Foxworth has been hampered
with an ankle injury, but he is
expecting to be able to play.
Concerning the team's mental
preparation Foxworth re
marked, "Berkeley's match is
easiest to get up for. You want to
beat them at anything, but you

can't go in and expect an easy
time. Hopefully we'll have the
desire to play well because it's
the last time we'll play together.
We'll definitely try to go out on a
winning note."
A win tonight would give Stan
ford an overall 8-12 record, four
more victories than last year's
squad.
Although the team has had
only a short time to rest since last
weekend's matches Sturm feels
that they're prepared for to
night's meeting. "We're going to
play to win," he said. "They'll he
ready to play."
