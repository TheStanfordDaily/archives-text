# Net teams travel to Ojai Intercollegiate
## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Stanford's men's and women's
tennis teams will take a break
from the rough conference
schedules to compete in the Ojai
Intercollegiates, which will begin
tomorrow and run through Sun
day.
The tournament will include a
Pac-10 division as well as an
open division and team point to
tals will be kept on each indi
vidual match.
The men's team, which is com
ing off six straight wins, including
victories over Cal, USC, UCLA
and Trinity, will be competing in
the 32-man draw without the
services of their top two players,
Peter Rennert and Tim Mayotte.
(Rennert is planning on playing
in a professional tournament in
Las Vegas, while Mayotte will
use the time for some well
deserved rest.)
In the Pac-10 division, Coach
Dick Gould's Cards will use
Lloyd Bourne. Scott Bondurant,
Dave Siegler, Jim Gurfein and
Jeff Arons to go against players
from UCLA, Cal, USC and the
Arizona Schools.
First round matches for the
Cards will include Bourne,
seeded No. 6, vs. UCLA's Dick
Metz, Bondurant vs. Marcel
Freeman of UCLA, Siegler vs.

USC's Jack Kruger, Arons vs.
ASU's Paul B'ernstein and Gur
fein vs. Cal's Marty Davis. The
Cards doubles lineup will include
Bondurant-Siegler, Bourne-
Gurfein and Arons-Greg Hing.
In the open division, Hing,
Andy Chase and John Corse will
all compete for Stanford.
Coach Gould looks at the
Ojai's as a good opportunity to
get in some needed tournament
experience. "We're not going to
win it without Peter and Tim
playing, but it will be a great
chance to get some tough tour
nament play in, especially for
players down the line. At the
same time, it will give Tim and
Peter a chance to rest up and heal
some minor injuries."
Rennert and Mayotte, who are
both undefeated in singles action
in Pac-10 play so far this year,
are leading the 5-1 Cards to what
could be another Stanford Na
tional Championship. With their
last four wins, Stanford should
be the uncontested No. 1 ranked
team in the nation in this week's
poll.
Yesterday's rain canceled the
Cards' scheduled match with No.
4 ranked Pepperdine. The match
will not be made up.
The women's team will send
seven members to Ojai. Alycia
Moulton and Sue Rassmussen
will compete in the women's col
legi-ate singles division, but since
no entrants are allowed to com
pete in any mortj than one event,
Julia Layton and Gayle Chan
will play in the women's col
legiate doubles.
In the open division, where
players are permitted to partici
pate in more than one' event.
Donna Rubin and Cary Cope
land will play in the doubles and
singles matches. Also on the trip
will be Judy Jordan. Jordan will
be in the women's Open doubles
too, but will be paired with a
partner when she arrives in Ojai.
"I think we're going to do
pretty well," women's coach
Frank Brennan said. "Most of
the teams do what we do in that
they divide up their strengths.
They'll all be tough."
