# Cricket and the world of the wicket
## 
### John Barnes Special to the Daily 
Have you ever seen a man
have his bails knocked off by a
googly? Ever seen a play out
l.b.w. for a duck? Have you
witnessed the feat of someone
bowling a maiden over on a
sticky wicket?
Such actions and more (none
of which is pornographic) can
quite properly be viewed in
games played by teams in the
Northern California Cricket As
sociation.
Cricket is most likely to cross
the path of Stanford residents in
two ways. One is by chancing
upon the mysterious rituals
being acted out by white-clad
priests most Sunday afternoons
on the intramural fields.
The other is by studying law:
even cricket has yielded its crop
of tedious sports litigation. Law
students commonly learn of the
hapless Miss Stone struck on the
head by a cricket ball while
standing in Beckenham Road
(Bolton v. Stone), the unfortu
nate Miller family whose house
was bombarded by cricket balls
(Miller v. Jackson), the famous
Mr. Greig who brought an antit
rust law challenge to his suspen
sion by English cricket au
thorities (Greig v. Insole), and
even the skillful Mr. Seymour
who found his benefit collection
assessed for income tax
(Seymour v. Reed).
However, most games can be
successfully completed without
judicial intervention.
Attempts to explain cricket
are notorious for floundering in a
sea of "ins," "outs," and "wic
kets." but this writer will put his
head down in the approved cric
ket stance and try to play the
issue through.
Here goes: Cricket is a game
of batting and running played by
two teams of 11 players. Both
men and women play. It is a
summer game chiefly associated
with countries of the British
Commonwealth, but which has a
substantial following in North
America.(The annual U.S.A. v.
Canada game has been played
continuously since 1844.)
The game uses a hard ball of
red leather similar in size and
weight to a baseball, and is
played on a large oval field at the

center of which is the pitch, con
sisting of a mat 22 yards long. At
either end of the pitch are three
wooden sticks, or "stumps," set
upright, close together. Resting
loosely on top of the stumps are
two small pieces of wood known
as hails. Each set of stumps and
bails constitutes a "wicket." It is
the bowler's object to hit the
wicket with the ball. The
batsman meanwhile seeks to
protect the wicket and score
runs.
The game begins with the op
posing captains tossing a coin to
decide which team will bat first.
The fielding side then tries to
dismiss the batting side; an in
ning is complete when 10
batsmen have been put out.
Two players from the batting
team will be in to bat at any given
time; they stand at either end of
the pitch. Bowlers on the fielding
side deliver the ball down the
pitch to the batsman at the oppo
site end. They try to bounce the
ball about one yard in front of
the batsman to make it difficult
to hit.
If the bowler succeeds in strik
ing the wicket with the ball and
knocking off a bail, then the
batsman is out "bowled."
The bowler may take a run-up
before delivering but must not
throw the ball with a bent arm; at
the moment ot release the arm
must be straight. Bowlers try to
vary the speed, direction and
bounce of the ball to keep
batsmen unsettled.
The batsman is armed with a
flat-faced bat and protected by
gloves and leg padding. He
stands in front of the wicket and
tries to hit the ball in any direc
tion about the field: a ball hit
behind or square is a perfectly
good shot.
The batsman may choose
which balls he wants to hit. If the
ball is hit a sufficient distance
into the field away from fielders,
the batsman who struck the ball
will run up the pitch to the
bowler's end, and his teammate
on the batting side wiltrun down
the pitch to the receiving end.
When the batsmen succeed in
exchanging positions in this way,
one run is scored.
If a fielder hits the wicket at
either end with the ball before a
batsman has reached that end of

the pitch, the batsman is out"run
out." Strategically located um
pires decide whether the
batsman made the run safely.
Life is made more leisurely for
the batsmen by the fact that a
ball hit to the perimeter of the
field scores runs automatically:
they don't have to do the running
up and down. If the ball is hit
across the field boundary along
the ground, it scores four runs; if
it crosses on the fly, it's "a six."
But there are also compensa
tions for the long-suffering field
ing team. A batsman can be out
"caught" if a fielder takes a fly
ball â€” a sometimes difficult and
bruising task since the fielders
play bare-handed. He can also
be out if the bowler causes the
batsman to miss a ball with his
bat and lets it hit his leg. If the
umpire judges that the ball
would have hit the wicket but for
hitting the leg, the batsman is out
"leg before wicket" or "1.b.w."
Much controversy may sur
round an umpire's determina
tions on this issue. There are
other, rarer ways for a batsman
to be out but the main ones are,
bowled, caught, l.b.w. and run
out. All dismissals except run
out are credited to the bowler
who bowled the ball; he is said to
have "taken the wicket."
In the Northern California
Cricket Association, teams bat
for one inning each. The innings
are limited in duration to 40
"overs." An over is a set of six
balls delivered by one bowler

from one end of the pitch. A
"maiden over" is one from which
no run is scored. All bowlers
therefore want to bowl a maiden
over. At the end of an over, a
different bowler begins bowling
from the opposite end of the
pitch. A total of 240 balls will
therefore be delivered to the bat
ting side, unless the team is all
out before this total is com
pleted.
On the average, teams score
about 100 runs an inning. Each
inning requires about 2 hours to
play.
In international games, known
as test matches, teams play with
out over limitation for five days
(with breaks for meals and dark
ness!) and each team has two in
nings. Massive scores may result.
Whatever limitation is used, the
object of the game remains the
same: to score more runs than
the opposition.
Is all now perfectly clear? Are
you now eager to play for one of
the 10 teams of the Northern
California Cricket Association in
the Bay Area? Do you feel con
fident enough to register polite
applause when you see a Stan
ford bowler knock an opponent's
bails off? (Stanford was the 1979
Northern California champion.)
You should at least be curious to
know about the as yet un
explained "googly," "duck,"
and "Sticky wicket," the latter
being a particularly tricky usage.
The only course is to"padupand
play the game."
