House approves draft registration
WASHINGTON —The House of Representatives gave
its approval yesterday to President Jimmy Carter's plan to
register millions of young men for the draft this summer.
The House passed a measure to supply $13.3 million to
revitalize the dormant Selective Service System and clear
the way for registration of some 4 million young men aged
19 and 20.
The final vote, taken after consideration of several
amendments, was 219-ISO. closer than White House offi
cials had expected.
Although the House approved the registration plan, it
would take further congressional action to institute an ac
tual draft.
Under Carter's plan, young men born in 19t>0 and 1 9h 1
w ill be required to register for the draft at post offices across
the country.
The registration question now goes to the Senate where
Sen. Mark Hatfield ( R-Ore.) has \ owed to try to filibuster it
to death.
The Senate has not scheduled action on the proposal.
Canada supports Olympic boycott
Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau's government yesterday
announced its firm opposition to Canada's participation in
the Moscow Summer Olympics, calling the boycott •"the
clearest and most effective way available" to condemn the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The announcement, made on the eve of a visit today by
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, removed doubts about
Trudeau's position and virtually assured that the Canadian
national team would not go to Moscow next summer.
With its announcement, Canada joins the major U.S.
allies — Japan. Australia, Britain and West Germany — in
recommending that their Olympic committees follow the
U.S.-led boycott.
While the Canadian Olympic Association is scheduled to
make a final decision at a meeting in Montreal Friday, its
president Dick Pound said that a majority of association
leaders "are in favor of not going" to Moscow.
Meanwhile the International Sports Federations in Swit
zerland. in a resolution polished up by Prince Philip of
Britain, yesterday unanimously condemned governments
which are putting pressure on athletes to boycott the Sum
mer Olympics Games in Moscow.
The resolution said a boycott is an "improper method" to
secure a political end and that athletes are the victims.
Prince Philip, as president of the International Equest
rian Federation, took part in a conference between the 26
federations and the executive board of the International
Olympic Committee.
The British government supports President Carter's call
for a boycott of the Games following the So\ iet intervention
in Afghanistan.

Former officials executed in Liberia
MONROVIA, Liberia — A firing squad of riflemen and
machine-gunners cheered on by thousands of Liberian sol
diers and civ ilians executed 13 top officials of the deposed
government on a sun-baked Atlantic beach yesterday.
Fhose shot included former Foreign Minister Cecil De
nnis and Frank Tolbert, elder brother of assassinated Presi
dent William Tolbert, as well as the chief justice, the
speaker of the House and the chairman of the party which
for a century governed Liberia, long America's closest Afri
can friend.
They had been sentenced to death by a five-man military
tribunal that declared them guilty of "high treason, rampant
corruption and gross violation of human rights." They had
been allowed no defense counsel and were given no details
of the charges against them.
The executions may have been the opening round of a
bloody purge of the old regime bv the military men, led by
Master Sgt. Samuel Doe, who toppled the government
April 12 and killed President Tolbert.
Seventy-nine other former officials have been brought
before the tribunal on the same charges and face possible
death sentences.
Inflation surge continues in March
WASHINGTON — Inflation surged at a near record 18
percent annual rate for a third straight month in March as
consumer prices advanced sharply across a broad range of
goods, from food to clothing, the government reported
yesterday.
The steep 1.4 percent rise in consumer prices during
March, matching the January and February increases, came
e\ en as the economy was believed to have entered a reces
sion. Howe\ er, government and private economists said the
weakening economy would not ease inflationary pressures
at the consumer level for several months.
Fhe latest rise in the Consumer Price Index produced a
record decline in the purchasing power of an average wage
earner during the previous 12 months, but it also brought a
14.3 percent cost-of-living increase forthe nation's3s mill
ion Social Security recipients.
It will cost $16.cS billion, plusanother $473 million to pay
tor higher Supplemental Security Income benefits also
geared to changes in the index.
March price increases for gasoline, other energy products
and medical care were the smallest this year. At the same
time, inflation worsened in other areas, suggesting that
sharp rises limited mainly to energy and interest rates were
now spilling over into the rest of the economy.
Food prices jumped 1 percent after two months of virtu
ally no change. Housing costs, paced by continued surges in
mortgage interest rates, registered the biggest increase in at
least 13 years. Price increases for clothing were the largest
since at least 1947. and the rise in entertainment costs was
the largest in nearly six years.

Hundreds of fires ravage the Midwest
National Guardsmen and volunteers joined professional
firefighters in the upper Midwest yesterday trying to head
off hundreds of tires that were kindled in a heat wave and
have destroyed thousands of acres of timberland and some
farms and homes.
But strong winds and sizzling temperatures stoked many
of the fires out of control with no rain in sight for the
burning lands in North Dakota, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
In Minnesota, where fires Monday forced the evacuation
of 150 residents, about 200 National Guardsmen called out
by Gov. Al Quie were joined yesterday by 75 civilian volun
teers. About 135 separate fires were burning in the central
part of the state.
Minnesota lost 25,000 acres to flames over the weekend,
bringing the total since the first of the year to 43,000 acres.
The firefighters took to the air yesterday with tankers
toting up to 1050 gallons of water, a helicopter scooping
500 gallons at a time from nearby lakes and three converted
B-26 bombers of World War 11 vintage dropping chemical
fire retardants.
CIA director sizes up Iran oil cutoff
WASHINGTON — A shutoff of Iranian oil shipments to
America's allies "won't be comfortable, but isn'tgoing to be
catastrophic," CIA Director Stansfield Turner said yester
day.
Because the world market is slack, Japan and other coun
tries can go elsewhere for their oil without driving up prices,
Turner testified at a Senate Energy Committee hearing.
Despite the current surpluses, Turner offered a gloomy
assessment of petroleum prospects during the 1980s, when
crude oil output will decline. The Soviet Union, which now
exports oil. will become a net importer, competing with
non-communist nations for Middle East petroleum, accord
ing to CIA figures.
The key political issue "is how vicious the struggle for
energy supplies will become," Turner said. "This competi
tion will create a severe test of the cohesiveness of both the
Western and Eastern alliances. The entrance of the Soviet
Union into the free world's competition for oil not only
further squeezes oil supplies to the West, but also entails
major security risks."
The Soviets "will be increasingly active in the diplomatic
arena in the Middle East, holding out as a carrot the glim
mer of a stable political atmosphere if the Gulf states be
come more cooperative on oil and political matters,"
Turner said.
Workers to enter TMI tomorrow
WASHINGTON — The Nuclear Regulatory Commis
sion staff approved plans yesterday to send people inside
the Three Mile Island nuclear reactor building, for the first
time since an accident more than a year ago contaminated
the building with radioactive water and gas.

The commission's announcement said Metropolitan Edi
son Co., the plant's operator, planned to send two people, in
protective clothing and air masks, inside the now-sealed
building for no more than 20 minutes tomorrow alternoon.
Their job would be to check the conditions of the building
and equipment, and survey the radioactive contamination.
As the two workers leave through a douhle-doored air
lock, a small amount of the krypton gas now trapped inside
the building will come out with them, the NRC said.
It estimated that this release would expose a bystander at
the plant boundary to no more than 0.7 millirem tit radia
tion to the skin and a 0.008-millirem whole-body dose.
These are considered very low exposure levels.
Earth Day celebrated nationwide
Americans celebrated the 10th anniversary of Earth Day
yesterday with sunrise services, bike rallies, kite flying and
demonstrations of ecological gizmos ranging from pedal
powered washing machines to a two-story toilet.
More than 1000 cities and towns held events to mark the
day, but for the most part crowds were much smaller than
the millions who turned out for the first Earth Day 10 years
ago.
Activities began in Washington with a sunrise service at
the Jefferson Memorial where present-day environmen
talists read selections from such environmentalists of the
past as Rachel Carson, Henry David Thoreau and E.F.
Schumacher, author of Small Is Beautiful.
CBS ends ABC's three-year reign
NEW YORK — It was anybody's race for 32 weeks, and
Jim Jones and Johnny Carson, The Dukes of Hazzard and
Robert Redford all figured in the finish. And when it was
over, CBS had ended ABC's three-year reign as the domin
ant network in prime-time television.
It was the closest race in a decade, perhaps in the history
of television. And CBS' victory, claimed yesterday, was by
the narrowest possible margin — one-tenth of a point —
and even then subject to contention by ABC.
A margin of a full point on the 1979-80 season might
have meant a difference of $60 million in advertising re
venue for the winner.
CBS won the week with a rating of 20.7 to 19.4 for ABC
and 13.2 for NBC. The networks say that means in an
average prime-time minute during the week, 20.7 percent
of the nation's TV-equipped homes were tuned to CBS.
Market rebounds in 30 point gain
NEW YORK — The stock market broke out of a long
decline yesterday, running up its sharpest gain in more than
a year and a half in heavy trading.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had
fallen 144 points from mid-February through Monday's
close, rebounded 30.72 to 789.85.
New York Stock Exchange volume reached 47.92 million
shares, up from 27.56 million Monday.
