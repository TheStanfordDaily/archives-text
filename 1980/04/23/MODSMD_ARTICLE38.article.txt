Daily magazine Thursday
Ever wonder what your professors
are busy doing when they are not busy
teaching class? Or what they're pub
lishing when they're not perishing?
Tomorrow's April edition of the Stan
ford Daily Magazine will examine re
search at Stanford and attempt to ans
wer these questions and more. Per
sonal profiles will look at the work of

10 of the University's more interesting
professors.
Correction
Sigma Chi was incorrectly noted in
Monday's paper as the only fraternity
that owns its house. Theta Xi also owns
its house, but unlike Sigma Chi, they do
their own bookkeeping. The Daily re
grets the error.
