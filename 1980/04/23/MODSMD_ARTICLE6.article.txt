# Common Market honors U.S. request for action against Iran
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
LUXEMBOURG — The nine coun
tries of the European Common Market
agreed unanimously yesterday to im
pose full economic sanctions against
Iran after May 17, "in the absence of
decisive progress" on release of the
U.S. Embassy hostages.
In the meantime, all Common Mar
ket countries will immediately prohibit
any new trading contracts with Iran,
suspend all sales of arms and military
equipment, take steps to reduce sub
stantially their diplomatic missions in
Tehran and Iranian missions in
Europe, and will reinstate visa re
quirements for Iranian citizens seeking
to travel to Europe.
The decision to impose sanctions was
announced after a day of haggling over
details of the plan. President Jimmy
Cartej, who earlier this month ordered
a virtually total U.S. trade embargo
against Iran and broke diplomatic rela
tions, had asked U.S. allies to help in
the campaign of economic and dip
lomatic pressure.
The Iranians have threatened to cut
off all oil exports to any nation that
joins in the U.S. sanctions. Thus far.
only Portugal and Australia have re
stricted trade with Iran.

The decisions were unequivocal and
a great deal tougher than had been ex
pected. This was due in part to French
readiness to act now on all necessary
measures instead of waiting for action
at a scheduled heads of government
meeting here this weekend.
Delay necessary
The delay in imposing the sanctions
until May 17 is necessary because most
countries need time to enact special
legislation to halt their trade and also
because there is another foreign minis
ters' meeting scheduled in Naples for
that date, at which they will review the
situation.
The date also follows the scheduled
completion of the election of a new
Iranian parliament, and thus should
give the Iranians sufficient time to act.
There may be some difference of
opinion among the nine governments
on what "decisive progress leading to
release of the hostages" should be by
next May 17. British Foreign Secretary
Lord Carrington, who has played a
leading role in the meeting here, told a
news conference that as far as he was
concerned, the mere transfer of the
hostages from control of the revolutio
nary students to the government would
not be enough.
However, Italian Foreign Minister
Emilio Colombo said that this "would
have to be considered," while a Ger
man spokesman said that it would in
volve consultation with the United
States at that time.
An immediate task of the ambas
sadors will be to inform the Iranian
government formally of the decisions
taken in Luxembourg "and undertake
all possible efforts to alleviate and im
prove the living conditions of the hos
tages pending their release."
A formal statement issued by the
foreign ministers expressed "solidarity
with the government and people of the
United States at this time of trial." It
declared that the fact that the hostages
are still detained after six months "is
intolerable from a humanitarian and
legal point of view." And it added that
the ministers were acting now out of
"deep concern that a continuation of

this situation may endanger interna
tional peace and security."
There was no mention of Iranian oil
in the statement, hut it was a question
that was discussed at length. In the end
it was simply agreed that none of the
countries would agree to pay Iran's
current demand of $35 a barrel for oil,
a price $3 to $4 above the prevailing
OPEC price. Refusal to pay is expected
effectively to end oil purchases from
Iran.
This has already happened with Ja
pan. and hrance stopped buying Ira
nian oil for price and other reasons
some months ago. British purchases
have already been cut. However, if Iran
now drops its asking price to the cur
rent OPEC levels, then the Common
Market members will have to take
another look at the situation in light of
its new policy of economic sanctions.
Response to Carter
Carter's aides had earlier accused
the Common Market countries — Bri
tain, France, Belgium, West Germany,
Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Ireland
and Luxembourg — of providing only
meager support of the United States in
moves to pressure Iran to release the
hostages.
Asked what he thought U.S. reaction
to the decisions might be, Britain's
Carrington said: "I would have thought
that this is hardly weakness. The
economic consequences will be quite
serious for Britain, but the British gov
ernment is prepared to do this.
"American patience after six months
is not endless, and it is exceedingly
dangerous to allow this situation to
continue. When friends are in trouble
you help them and that is what we are
doing."
As to the effect of the action here on
the hostage situation, Carrington said
simply that "nobody can be certain of
release of the hostages — how can any
body know?" Asked if the Europeans
would support the United States in tak
ing military action if the hostages are
not released, he said:
"I have just jumped a six-foot fence,
and let's not jump the next one until we
land on the other side of this one."
