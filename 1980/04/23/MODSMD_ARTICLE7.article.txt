# Repurchased for $1.1 million
## University buys land from school district 
### Rich Heftet Staff Writer 
The University Board of Trustees has bought back
th 6 40-acre Sequoia Union High School District site
on Sand Hill Road that the University sold to the
district in 1961.
The trustees paid $1.1 million cash for the land
they sold for $281,000 almost 20 years ago.
Located in the middle of Guernsey Field, a 275-
acre plot owned by the University and bordered by
Interstate 280, Sand Hill Road and Whiskey Hill
Road, the site is a "key location" for future planning
by the University, said Bob Beyers, director of the
University News Service.
The 1961 sale gave Stanford the right of first re
fusal in the event of a future sale, and the school
district had expressed an interest in selling the land.
"If the University did not repurchase the land, the

school district could have sold it to whomever it
wanted," Beyers said
Keeping land open
He explained that the University was concerned
about private development of the 40-acre site for
residential, commercial or other purposes that might
complicate the University's future plans for the entire
plot.
The University has not decided what the land will
be used for, but has undergone a study of its long
term use, he said.
Currently, the University leases out Guernsey
Field for grazing, said Robert Summers, manager of
faculty housing. Summers said that negotiations are
under way to add an equestrian training center on the
field.
The Universitv pays about $8300 in taxes to San

Mateo County for the open land at Guernsey Field,
Beyers said.
The land was originally acquired by the University
in the late 1800s as part of its founding grant. This
grant stipulated that the University could not sell any
of its land.
Land for public use
However, public agencies can condemn Stanford
lands needed for public use. This means the Univer
sity is forced to give up land and this is not unusual,
Beyers said.
The sale of land to the school district in 1 961, and
the sale of other lands to the federal government for
construction of Interstate 280, are examples of con
demnation.
The University is paying for the new site from its
easements and condemnations fund, Beyers said.
This fund includes payments from public agencies
which have condemned the lands.
