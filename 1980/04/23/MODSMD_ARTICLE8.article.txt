## Man executed for defending Deng Major criminal trial expected 
### William Sexton Newsday 
PEKING — Even to Chinese
who experienced the worst of the
Cultural Revolution, the story
must have been a shocking one:
More than two months after
Chairman Hua Guofeng toppled
the Gang of Four in 1976. a
young man in Kirin Province was
executed for criticizing the jailed
ultra-leftists and defending
Deng Xiaoping.
Moreover, according to the
dramatic account published in
Saturday's People's Daily. the
execution of Si Yufung, 28. was
carried out on direct orders from
the provincial governor, a highly
prominent figure at the time, and
against the ruling of the local di
rector of legal affairs.
Deng makes comeback
During that turbulent period
four years ago, Deng had been
purged as first vice premier. But
he was later to stage a comeback
and today he is senior vice pre
mier.
The prominent display of the
execution story on page 4 of the
Communist Party's national
newspaper set off speculation
that a major criminal trial may be
in preparation. Although the
Kirin Province governor, Wang
Huaixiang, was removed by
early 1977, observers here were
not aware of any legal proceed
ings against him since then.
People's Daily did not name
Wang directly but referred to
"the chief responsible person of
the provincial revolutionary
committee" and "his as
sociates."
Trial delayed
Whether the case might be
connected with the long-delayed
trial of the Gang of Four — Mao
Tse-tung's widow, Jiang Oing,
and her three ultra-leftist allies
— could only be conjectured.
That trial, according to H ua. was
to begin early this year, but offi
cials now decline comment on its
status. Authoritative sources say
high-level disputes are delaying
the trial; some leaders appa
rently are fearful that present
day officials might be implicated
in defense testimony.
The ousted provincial gover

nor. Wang, was a career soldier
who served Mao during the
Communist fight for survival in
the 1930s and held a string of
staff assignments as late as the
Korean War. He entered civil af
fairs through appointment to the
Kirin government in 1967,
shortly after Mao began a
thorough purge of the nation's
existing civil leadership. He ac
quired the added title of first sec
retary of the provincial party in
1971.

The victim of the belated
execution. Si. was an employee
at an optical instrument factory
in Changchun, capital of Kirin in
northeast China.
Wrote letters
Si was arrested on charges of
writing letters defending Liu
Shao-chi, the former chief of
state of China and the chief vic
tim of the Cultural Revolution,
and of "uttering complaints"
about the dismissal of Deng. Liu

was recently rehabilitated.
People's Daily said the death
sentence was pronounced on
Dec. 17. 1976, several weeks
after the Oct. 6 arrest of Jiang
Oing. Si's mother tried to obtain
a reprieve, the newspaper said,
but he was executed two days la
ter, before she could reach Pek
ing for help. Announcing Si's re
habilitation, People's Daily said
he had been posthumously
awarded full membership in the
Communist Party.
