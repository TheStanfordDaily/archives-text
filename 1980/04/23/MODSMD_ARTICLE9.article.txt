# Cuba approves dispatch of flotilla to pick up exiles

### Marlise Simons The Washington Post 
HAVANA â€” Cuba approved the dispatch of a
flotilla by Miami's Cuban exiles to pick up some of
the thousands of would-be emigres that took re
fuge in the Peruvian Embassy.
The exiles already have chartered more than 100
boats and the government announced that two ves
sels had already arrived at the port of Mariel just
west of Havana.
Repeat performance
A flotilla landing here would be a repeat perfor
mance of the massive exodus of 1966 when a
stream of vessels of all types came from Miami and
hauled away thousands of refugees from the port of
Camarioca.
Often overloading their craft, boat owners then
made fortunes by charging exorbitant fees and
Cuba was able to reduce internal pressures on its
young socialist government.
Although Cuban officials already had said pri
vately that the Miami vessels would be permitted to
land, a muted invitation came Monday, buried
casually deep down in an editorial of the Com
munist Party newspaper Granma.
Flotilla welcome
Referring to vessels "coming from Florida to
pick up antisocial elements," Granma said, "Of
course we are not going to receive them with can
non fire since they come on a peaceful mission and
we have no objection to having them take them
(the refugees) away." Cuban officials said this was
tantamount to an invitation.
Granma did not make clear whether it only en
dorsed the departure of the 10,500 refugees who
stormed the Peruvian Embassy two weeks ago. No
mention was made of others who may aspire to
leave Cuba.
Only 1500 of the 10,500 have refused to leave
the embassy and accept the safe-conduct passes the

Cuban government has given to 8400 would-be
emigres. The people now refusing to leave the em
bassy, Western diplomats believe, may have crimi
nal or other charges pending against them, or they
simply do not trust President Fidel Castro's word
that they may leave the country from their homes.
Causing waves
The newest Cuban announcement is causing
waves among diplomats here who had expected a
massive airlift to Costa Rica, where refugees would
he cleared before traveling to other countries for
permanent asylum.
Castro, known for his unorthodox and unpre
dictable approach to problem-solving, on Friday
suddenly decided to cut oft the Costa Rican air
corridor and its attendant humiliating publicity. By
then, only about 800 people had reached San Jose,
the Costa Rican capital.
A flotilla picking up refugees in the port of
Mariel conjures up for U.S. officials a chaotic scene
of Cubans boarding Miami-bound craft without
being screened and documented by the U.S. In
terests Section here.
"It will be up to the Coast Guard and Immigra
tion at the other end. They're being put on the
spot," one American source said. "I just don't
know what their attitude will be.
Refugees 'economic 1 not political
The government-controlled Cuban press has fo
cused its attention on the arrival of impoverished
Haitians in Miami who are threatened with depor
tation, allegedly because they are "economic" and
not political refugees.
The Haitians "are the true measure of Carter's
human rights policy. They live under a repressive
feudal regime .... But they are not admitted as
political refugees while the United States stimu
lates the emigration of delinquents from Cuba,"
Granma wrote Monday.
