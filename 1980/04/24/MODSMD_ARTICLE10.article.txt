# Freedman: Patiently questing quarks
## 
### Rob Lempert 
"An experimental physicist is
one who discovers important and
interesting things about nature,"
says Stanford's Stuart Freed
man. It is a statement that does
much to belittle the complexity
of the task.
Freedman is an assistant pro
fessor of nuclear physics, that
branch of the science which con
cerns itself with the behavior of
the atomic nucleus. Fie often will
spend years at a time on a single
experiment, designing and build
ing the machines that will allow
him to capture the individual
atoms he wishes to study, subject
them to a series of forces and
observe the results.
The idea of experimenting is
to test theories, to match predic
tions against actual events in na
ture and to see how close the two
come. "It keeps the field hon
est," Freedman says. "Without
experiments, physics would be
nothing but another natural
philosophy."
But even with pages of num
bers on computer print-out
sheets as answers, the questions
Freedman studies often seem as
esoteric as the most philosophic
debate.
His first experiments after he
earned his doctorate at UC-
Berkeley were done at Princeton
in the ear;ly '70s. There he
examined the validity of what
physicists call hidden variable
theories in experiments —
roughly, measures of the amount
of determinism in the universe.
New theory
Up to the beginning of this
century, scientists always as
sumed that, given enough data
and adequate theories, they
could always predict exactly
what would happen in any physi
cal situation. But in the '20s and
'30s, new discoveries forced the
development of a new type of
physics. called quantum
mechanics, to explain the be
havior of the particles that make
up atoms. One of the salient fea
tures of this new theory is that it
expressly limits what man can
know. Quantum mechanics gives
its answers in probabilities, not
certainties, and if the theory is
correct, this is as precise as one
can ever get.
Such a notion is profoundly
troubling to many physicists. It
bothered Albert Einstein him
self. who was known to say, "God
does not play dice with the uni
verse." Thus several researchers
have developed what they call
hidden variable theories post
ulating yet-to-be-disco ered fac
tors that determine events and
that, once known, will put the
certainty back into physics.
Generally these theories make
predictions identical to those of
quantum mechanics, but in a few
cases hidden variables predict a
tiny difference in the behavior of
certain atoms. The difference is
miniscule, but Freedman spent
his three years at Princeton
gathering data to test the two
competing theories. The results
were inconclusive.
Consequences key
"1 like to do experiments that
will have consequences,"
Freedman says."I don't mind if
they have a low probability of
success, if they work, the resuits
will be weighty."
Mad Freedman's data come
down strongly on the side of the
hidden variable theory, the basic
assumptions of modern physics
would have received a staggering
blow.
Not all experimentalists work
this way. Many prefer to take the
less risky course of measuring
only those effects they are cer
tain they will find. But Freedman
seems to take his search of the
unknown seriously. He seems to

relish looking for what others
say cannot be found.
PEP ring
At the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center, the finishing
touches are being put on PEP. a
giant ring of one-kilometer
diameter which, when finished,
will be one of the world's most
powerful tools for producing
sub-atomic particles. Inside its
target chamber, streams of mat
ter and anti-matter will collide
head-on, sending out sprays of
particles to be observed as they
race by.
One of the first experiments to
be done on this new machine has
been organized by a five-school
team of which Freedman is a
part. The team will be searching
for the elusive quark.
Actually, no one is quite sure
what a quark is. It started as a
mathematical abstraction with a
funny name, used to explain the
otherwise strange behavior of
certain sub-atomic particles.
Then several physicists decided
those equations might actually

Physics

represent something real, a tiny
particle that might be a basic
building block of nature, the
fundamental unit that makes up
the proton, neutron and a host of
other particles.
Though since that time there
have been many indirect indica
tions that quarks really do exist,
not one has ever been actually
detected. This is a little troubling
to those theorists who regard it
as the foundation of matter.
Finding quarks
If quarks really do exist,
theory predicts that they will
have an electric charge smaller
than that of any other particle.
Thus, when PEP is turned on,
Freedman and his colleagues will
carefully scan the atomic debris
hurling from the ring's miniature
explosions, searching for some
indication of a particle with a
charge one-third less than that
on a single electron.
Will they find what they're
looking for? Probably not,
Freedman admits. But still, there
arc reasons for doing the exper
iment. First, he argues, it would
be useful to know that there are
no quarks produced in the type
of collision occurring in PEP.
Someday this fact may prove
helpful in developing some new
theory. But more importantly,
however, Freedman says, ex
perimentalists have a responsi
bility to look for things that are
not likely to be there, for if by
chance the unexpected is disco
vered, incorrect theories will be
disproved.
No specialty
Freedman does not consider
himself a specialist. Rather, he
likes to use the techniques of
nuclear physics to study more

fundamental questions, as he did
at Princeton and hopes to do at
PEP. "I'm not in the mainstream
of any one branch of physics," he
says, "I'm in the cracks in bet
ween." In his latest experiment,
Freedman will use nuclear
physics to test the newest addi
tion to a very different branch of
the science — the universal field
theory.
There are four fundamental
forces in nature: gravity, which
makes planets orbit the sun;
electromagnetism, which holds
electrons in atoms; and the
strong and weak nuclear forces,
which hold together the particles
inside the atomic nucleus. Some
scientists hypothesize that these
four forces are really different
manifestations of a single force
(or field). This is called the univ
ersal field theory.
Last year, American physicists
Sheldon Glashow and Steven
Weinberg, along with Abdus
Salam of Pakistan, won the
Nobel Prize for a theory showing
electromagnetism and the weak

interaction to be, at root, the
same phenomenon. Freedman's
new experiment will test this
theory by examining one of its
consequences.
Parity question
One of the ramifications of the
Glashow. Weinberg and Salam
theory is that the weak interac
tion will not conserve a quality,
called parity, that up to now
physicists believed was con
served in weak interactions. If
Freedman can show that parity is
not conserved, it will be a major
experimental boost for the new
theory.
Basically, something has par

ity if it looks the same in a mirror
as it does otherwise. A pool ball
has parity; your right hand does
not. Most forces in nature con
serve parity. That is, if you were
to watch them work through a
mirror, they would look the same
as they would otherwise. Ac
cording to Glashow, Weinberg
and Salam, however, the weak
interaction does not always be
have this way.
In his experiment. Freedman
will look for slight anomalies in
the otherwise well-known be
havior of atomic nuclei to test
this prediction.
Lab turns nucleus
Freedman must use a nucleus
because the weak interaction
acts only over distances smaller
than the atomic diameter. His
lab becomes the nucleus of a
boron atom, inside of which he
will observe the force at work.
But how does one see what is
going on inside the nucleus of an
atom?
Physicists know that the protons
and neutrons inside a nucleus
can be arranged in any one of
several different ways. Any time
a force, such as the weak interac
tion, causes these particles to
rearrange themselves, a specific
amount of radiation is released.
If you know the original ar
rangement of the particles inside
the nucleus and measure the
radiation coming out. you can
calculate what changes in ar
rangement took place, and if
your theories are correct, what
force caused those changes.
So what Freedman does is this.
He knows that if he shoots a
stream of helium nuclei moving
at a certain speed at lithium nuc
lei standing still, the collision will
produce boron nuclei, each with
a specific arrangement of parti
cles inside. He then watches the
radiation emitted and calculates
how many times the weak in
teraction took place. But to
check the parity. Freedman must
make the entire experiment look
as if it were in a mirror.
Imagine a top spinning
counter-clockwise. It you were
to see it in a mirror, it would be
spinning the other way. This is
Freedman's trick. For several
hours he will make the lithium
nuclei spin counter-clockwise,
shoot the helium at them and
count the number of times the
weak interaction takes place in
side the resulting boron. Then he
will make the lithium nuclei spin
clockwise and repeat the entire
process.
One in a million
If parity were conserved, he
should count the exact same
number of reactions both ways.
But if Glashow, Steinberg and
Salam's theory is correct, one in

a million times (it is a quantum
mechanical theory and only gives
probabilities as answers) there
will be a difference when the
mirror images are compared.
There are millions of boron nuc
lei in Freedman's apparatus at
any one time, but it still takes
him three days of continuous ex
perimenting to collect the data.
Freedman calls this type of
endeavor a high-risk experi
ment, for its probable outcome is
failure. Chances are that the
random errors that plague all ex
periments will obscure the one
in-a-million times occurrence
that is the tell-tale sign of what
Freedman is trying to observe.
But it he can wrest-conclusive
data from inside the boron atom,
last's year's Nobel Prize winning
theory could be experimentally
corroborated. Or it could be
proven wrong.
"Experimenting is hard
work," Freedman says. "You
have to put up with a lot of frust
ration, work late at night and
travel around the country (He
spends eight weeks a year at one
of his labs in Chicago.). Only en
thusiasm keeps you going."
Low production
But not everyone is an en
thusiastic about Freedman's
high-risk experiments as he is.
His projects tend to produce re
sults only every few years, and in
physics as in other fields, Freed
man explains, what counts is
what you produce.
"It's easier for someone who
publishes a lot," he says. The
main problem is funding. Exper
iments are expensive, and those
who are paying for them like to
see lots of tangible results.
"Stanford tends to be a con
servative department." freed
man adds. The physics program
here tends to favor the stable,
long-term projects that produce
results year in and year out and
likewise draw outside monetary
support on the same continuous
basis. The problem with this
philosophy is that it limits how
often a young physicist can break
out on a new experiment in
search of the unexpected.
Tliis is why Freedman's parity
experiment is located near
Chicago at the federally run Ar
gonne Labs. "The government is
more willing to support risky ex
periments like mine," he exp
lains.
But despite the problems he
encounters, Freedman wouldn't
experiment any other way. "I
would find it difficult to do an
experiment I'm not interested
in," he says.
If a quark is found next year at
PEP, the interest won't be only
his.
