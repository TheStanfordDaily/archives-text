# Boskin: New capitalism for the '80s
## 
### John Mason 
Lately, on nearly any day,
news of the economy has been
dismal. Inflation is soaring, in
comes are stagnant, productivity
is falling. The nation's economic
pulse, as measured by the stock
market, has been sluggish and
weak. Not since the Great De
pression have so many funda
mental questions been posed
about the viability of American
capitalism. And not since the
Great Depression have the pub
lic. the press and the legislature
turned in such earnest to the
economics profession for
answers.
In 1930, it was the British
economist John Maynard
Keynes whose theory penetrated
the inscrutable depression. Half
a century later, a small group of
young American economists is
rallying to the call of a nation
mired in a debilitating economic
malaise. Among the leaders of
that group is 34-year-old Stan
ford economist Michael Boskin.
Ironically, the enormously
popular cure for the Great De
pression which Keynes
suggested is the disease from
which th£ modern U.S. economy
is currently suffering. Asa result,
Boskin and his peers are search
ing for new, or at least long for
gotten. solutions.
Keynes and today's older gen
eration of economists who were
weaned on "Keynesianism." ad
vocated large government ex
penditures to prop up the droop
ing demand for goods and ser
vices which periodically drove
the economy into recession.
In the post j World War II era,
this "demand management" was
used with increasing frequency
for a number of reasons. The rise
in the political power of labor
unions, low-income groups and
minorities made it almost un
thinkable for the government to
allow recessions to occur, since it
felt that these groups suffered
excessively during economic
turndowns. In addition, the wars
in Korea and Vietnam, the space
race and the Johnson-Kennedy
"Great Society" programs
brought the scope of government
spending to unparalled heights.
In 1929, the government's share
of the nation's output had been a
tenth. By the end of the 19705,
that share had grown to over a
third.
To finance these growing ex
penditures, total taxes have risen
by 300 percent, and the federal
monetary authorities have ex
panded the nation's money sup
ply at dramatic rates.
Economic healer
It is the effect of these policies
on the health of the American
economy to which Boskin has
devoted the majority of his re
search efforts since coming to
Stanford in 1971.
Boskin, a native of New York
who grew up in Los Angeles, did
his undergraduate work at UC-
Berkeley. After a disappointing
introduction to the department
of economics at Harvard —
which lasted less than a week —
Boskin returned to Berkeley,
where he completed his docto
rate in less than four years.
The transition from the large
public school atmosphere of
Berkeley to the more cloistered
Stanford environment seems to
have agreed with Boskin. "I wish
Stanford were a little closer to
San Francisco," said the unmar
ried Boskin. "But I like the idea
of the campus set apart from the
city."
Boskin, whose stay at Ber
keley from 1964 to 1971 coin
cided with a period of intense
campus turmoil and violence,
finds it hard to make compari
sons between the two rival
schools. "1 was at Berkeley when

there was a lot of unrest," Boskin
offered. "I got an unusual
perspective on the place."
Nonetheless, Boskin is able to
make some distinctions between
the schools. In particular, he
noted that Stanford professors
generally take their under
graduate students more seriously
than the Berkeley professo
took theirs. And he added that a
closer intellectual relationship
exists between professors and
graduate students here than
existed at either Berkeley or
Harvard, where he was a visiting
professor in 1977-78.
Although he feels a strong
commitment to teaching, Boskin
considers research to be his
primary concern. And at Stan
ford he has found the tools
necessary for doing his kind of
research. Intellectual stimula
tion from his colleagues and
graduate students makes a sig
nificant contribution to his work,
as does access to computer
facilities and funding sources.
Up to date
Of particular importance to
Boskin is his position at the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Re
search. As an economist for the
Bureau — which is located adja
cent to the Stanford Golf Course
— Boskin is able to participate in
a seminar and workshop prog
ram which brings the authors of
the newest research in
economics to Stanford. This
work, he observed, enables him
to keep abreast of current re
search. which is often published
only after a delay of several
years.
A specialist in the analysis of
government policies, Boskin
adds a new dimension to Stan
ford's economics department.
Owing mostly to the great dis-

Economics

tance between Palo Alto and
Washington, D C., Stanford has
rarely been a home for the na
tion's experts on economic pol
icy. Traditionally, Stanford has
attracted distinguished experts
on mathematical economics,
econometrics and economic
theory.
But the major figures in the
field of economic policy analysis
(which includes such areas as ta
xation, federal spending and
monetary regulation) have re
mained on the East Coast, where
they could be near the nation's
economic capitals: Washington
for the public sector. New York
for the private sector. It has been
from the ivy-covered halls of
Harvard, Princeton, Yale and
the University of Pennsylvania,
as well as the University of
Chicago and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, that
cabinet members and presiden
tial advisors have been selected.
Exception
Boskin is, however, an excep

tion to the rule. His studies fre
quently address federal govern
ment policy, and he advocates a
greater emphasis on this sort of
research here at Stanford. "The
real challenge at Stanford is to
build up a good group of
economists doing research into
economic policy," he said.
Whether or not the University
administration will support Bos
kin's design is uncertain, but the
rest of the country is increasingly
taking notice of him and his
work. Referred to in Time
magazine as one of the
"brightest younger economists"
on the nation's campuses, Bos
kin and his ideas are gaining a
larger audience in Washington.
He is regularly in contact with a
number of federal legislators, in
cluding such economic kingpins
as Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-lnd ),
the next chairman of Congress'
Joint Economic Committee.
What Boskin is bringing to the
nation's decision-makers is not
only a thoughtful analysis of the
impact of government on the
economy, but also a set of prop
osals for improving government
policy where its impact is nega
tive.
Three-fold plans
Basically. Boskin's research
falls into three categories, the
first of which deals with the ef
fect of government policies on
private decision-making. In par
ticular. Boskin is looking at the
effect of current tax policies on
patterns of saving and invest
ment. He is also developing
hypotheses about the potential
effects of alternative tax policies
on those same elements.
Most importantly, Boskin has
noted that our current system of
taxing incomes, both at the per
sonal and the corporate level.

has the effect of diverting re
sources from saving to spending.
To reverse this trend, Boskin has
become a proponent of the idea
that spending, and not the earn
ing of income, should be the
basis upon which people are
taxed. This would have the effect
of encouraging people to save,
which leads to growth in the
economy. And it would encour
age people to not spend their
money, resulting in a relaxation
of the inflationary tension cur
rently straining the economy.
Justification
While the abolition of the cor
porate and personal income
taxes and the imposition of an
expenditure tax may appear to
put a far greater tax burden on
middle and lower income work
ers, Boskin argues that, to some
extent, the regressive effects of
such a plan would be mitigated
by increases in growth and pro
ductivity. "If we produce more,
that will create by far the most
favorable milieu for low income

people to improve their standard
of living," he said.
He admitted, though, that his
plan would have some regressive
aspects. "There are," Boskin al
lowed. "income distribution
questions we will have to face if
we abolish the corporate income
tax."
Boskin has also found that be
cause income from investments
is taxed on a nominal basis —
meaning that no adjustment is
made for changes in the price

level — inflation has a particu
larly stifling effect on invest
ment. He therefore advocates a
strict and predictable policy gov
erning monetary growth, so that
inflation will not, among its other
ill effects, cause an erosion of the
American capital stock and
consequently, a decline in Ameri
can industrial productivity.
Still another issue in this area
that Boskin has raised is the de
sirability of the government's
ever-increasing share of the na
tion's yearly output." 1 don't cur
rently favor spending limits," he
commented, "but recently it
(government expenditure) has
gotten out of control." To rectify
the situation, Boskin advocates a
policy which would slow the rate
of growth of government spend
ing.
Alternatives
Of course, Boskin is aware
that the changes he has
suggested are dramatic ones, and
he docs have some alternative
suggestions which would be

more practical in the short
run. Among these is an accelera
tion of the depreciation allo
wance, which would make it pos
sible for businesses to deduct
larger amounts from their taxes
after buying new equipment.
Outlays would consequently
become more profitable to firms,
and the level of investment
would increase. The new and
better equipment would lead to a
rise in labor productivity, which
would ultimately manifest itself
in a higher level of national in
come. The alternative to follow
ing such policies will be a future
for Americans in which, Boskin
warns, "our standard of living
will fall behind that of other
societies."
Perhaps the most likely of
Boskin's policies to be im
plemented in the near future are
his ideas on the budgetary pro
cess. Principally focusing upon
the government's budget as his
second branch of research, Bos
kin has devised a number of
proposals which may soon show
up as a federal budget reform
and control act.
For instance, Boskin points
out that not all of the govern
ment's expenditures (such as the
National Direct Student Loan
program) are even included in
the federal budget. Hence, in
1981, when the Carter administ
ration boasts of a balanced
budget, there will in fact be a $40
billion "off-budget" deficit.
Boskin would modify the
budgetary process so that such
outside expenditures would be
included. "In inflationary
times," he noted, "you want to
have a really good idea of what
the true deficit is."
A second Boskin modification
would be the inclusion of "man
dated private activity" in the
budget. Thus, when the govern
ment tells a consumer to spend
$100 on a catalytic converter for
his car, the $ 1 00 would appear in
the budget the same way as if the
government had simply taxed
the consumer $100 and given it
to the car manufacturer for in
stalling the converter. As it is
now, the $100 shows up in the
national accounts under gross
auto sales.
Boskin would further have the
government include a separate
"capital account" in its budget.
In this way, during a year in
which the government let its
machines and buildings run
down, the value of the capital de


Growth
of gov't
spending

terioration would count as an
expenditure. Boskin's reasoning
is that the buildings and
machines will eventually have to
he repaired or replaced because
of the lack of outright spending
during that one year.
The ultimate effect of these re
forms will be to make the budget,
in Boskin's words, "a proper
measure of the economic impact
of government policies."
The third branch of Boskin's
research has dealt with a number
of problems developing — or
soon to develop — in the Social
Security system.
Early retirement
In a paper written for Stan
ford's Center for Research in
Economic Growth, Boskin links
enormous decreases in labor
force participation rate of elderly
males to growth of Social Sec

urity benefits. As Boskin put it.
"The growth of Social Security
benefits has led to an explosion
of early retirement."
The increasing number of
people leaving their jobs to join
the government dole is placing
the long-term solvency of the en
tire retirement benefit system in
jeopardy. Boskin has calculated
the present-day value of the up
coming Social Security deficit to
be over $750 billion. To meet
this financial burden, Boskin
foresees that "We will have to
raise Social Security taxes to
21-23 percent of payroll by the
year 2020."
To avoid such a state of affairs,
Boskin advocates phasing an in
crease into the ages of full and
partial eligibility. In addition, he
would seek to separate the
earned entitlements portion of
the Social Security check from

the transfer payment portion. In
other words, retirees above the
poverty line would receive only a
sum proportional to what they
had paid in, while those below
the poverty line would receive
their entitlement plus a welfare
payment.
In reference to his proposals,
Boskin said, "My own estimates
show that this would not only
eliminate the deficit, but would
also generate a surpl us that could
mean lower taxes."
This sort of optimism pervades
nearly all of Boskin's work. And
this optimism in the face of to
day's intimidating economic
maladies, combined with an im
pressive record of research, has
made Boskin one of the promi
nent figures in one of the
economics profession's most
challenging periods.

Stanford were a little closer to
San Francisco," said the unmar
ried Boskin. "But I like the idea
of the campus set apart from the
city."
Boskin, whose stay at Ber
keley from 1964 to 1971 coin
cided with a period of intense
campus turmoil and violence,
finds it hard to make compari
sons between the two rival
schools. "1 was at Berkeley when

there was a lot of unrest," Boskin
offered. "I got an unusual
perspective on the place."
Nonetheless, Boskin is able to
make some distinctions between
the schools. In particular, he
noted that Stanford professors
generally take their under
graduate students more seriously
than the Berkeley professo
took theirs. And he added that a
closer intellectual relationship
exists between professors and
graduate students here than
existed at either Berkeley or
Harvard, where he was a visiting
professor in 1977-78.
Although he feels a strong
commitment to teaching, Boskin
considers research to be his
primary concern. And at Stan
ford he has found the tools
necessary for doing his kind of
research. Intellectual stimula
tion from his colleagues and
graduate students makes a sig
nificant contribution to his work,
as does access to computer
facilities and funding sources.
Up to date
Of particular importance to
Boskin is his position at the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Re
search. As an economist for the
Bureau — which is located adja
cent to the Stanford Golf Course
— Boskin is able to participate in
a seminar and workshop prog
ram which brings the authors of
the newest research in
economics to Stanford. This
work, he observed, enables him
to keep abreast of current re
search. which is often published
only after a delay of several
years.
A specialist in the analysis of
government policies, Boskin
adds a new dimension to Stan
ford's economics department.
Owing mostly to the great dis-

Economics

tance between Palo Alto and
Washington, D C., Stanford has
rarely been a home for the na
tion's experts on economic pol
icy. Traditionally, Stanford has
attracted distinguished experts
on mathematical economics,
econometrics and economic
theory.
But the major figures in the
field of economic policy analysis
(which includes such areas as ta
xation, federal spending and
monetary regulation) have re
mained on the East Coast, where
they could be near the nation's
economic capitals: Washington
for the public sector. New York
for the private sector. It has been
from the ivy-covered halls of
Harvard, Princeton, Yale and
the University of Pennsylvania,
as well as the University of
Chicago and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, that
cabinet members and presiden
tial advisors have been selected.
Exception
Boskin is, however, an excep

tion to the rule. His studies fre
quently address federal govern
ment policy, and he advocates a
greater emphasis on this sort of
research here at Stanford. "The
real challenge at Stanford is to
build up a good group of
economists doing research into
economic policy," he said.
Whether or not the University
administration will support Bos
kin's design is uncertain, but the
rest of the country is increasingly
taking notice of him and his
work. Referred to in Time
magazine as one of the
"brightest younger economists"
on the nation's campuses, Bos
kin and his ideas are gaining a
larger audience in Washington.
He is regularly in contact with a
number of federal legislators, in
cluding such economic kingpins
as Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-lnd ),
the next chairman of Congress'
Joint Economic Committee.
What Boskin is bringing to the
nation's decision-makers is not
only a thoughtful analysis of the
impact of government on the
economy, but also a set of prop
osals for improving government
policy where its impact is nega
tive.
Three-fold plans
Basically. Boskin's research
falls into three categories, the
first of which deals with the ef
fect of government policies on
private decision-making. In par
ticular. Boskin is looking at the
effect of current tax policies on
patterns of saving and invest
ment. He is also developing
hypotheses about the potential
effects of alternative tax policies
on those same elements.
Most importantly, Boskin has
noted that our current system of
taxing incomes, both at the per
sonal and the corporate level.

has the effect of diverting re
sources from saving to spending.
To reverse this trend, Boskin has
become a proponent of the idea
that spending, and not the earn
ing of income, should be the
basis upon which people are
taxed. This would have the effect
of encouraging people to save,
which leads to growth in the
economy. And it would encour
age people to not spend their
money, resulting in a relaxation
of the inflationary tension cur
rently straining the economy.
Justification
While the abolition of the cor
porate and personal income
taxes and the imposition of an
expenditure tax may appear to
put a far greater tax burden on
middle and lower income work
ers, Boskin argues that, to some
extent, the regressive effects of
such a plan would be mitigated
by increases in growth and pro
ductivity. "If we produce more,
that will create by far the most
favorable milieu for low income

people to improve their standard
of living," he said.
He admitted, though, that his
plan would have some regressive
aspects. "There are," Boskin al
lowed. "income distribution
questions we will have to face if
we abolish the corporate income
tax."
Boskin has also found that be
cause income from investments
is taxed on a nominal basis —
meaning that no adjustment is
made for changes in the price

level — inflation has a particu
larly stifling effect on invest
ment. He therefore advocates a
strict and predictable policy gov
erning monetary growth, so that
inflation will not, among its other
ill effects, cause an erosion of the
American capital stock and
consequently, a decline in Ameri
can industrial productivity.
Still another issue in this area
that Boskin has raised is the de
sirability of the government's
ever-increasing share of the na
tion's yearly output." 1 don't cur
rently favor spending limits," he
commented, "but recently it
(government expenditure) has
gotten out of control." To rectify
the situation, Boskin advocates a
policy which would slow the rate
of growth of government spend
ing.
Alternatives
Of course, Boskin is aware
that the changes he has
suggested are dramatic ones, and
he docs have some alternative
suggestions which would be

more practical in the short
run. Among these is an accelera
tion of the depreciation allo
wance, which would make it pos
sible for businesses to deduct
larger amounts from their taxes
after buying new equipment.
Outlays would consequently
become more profitable to firms,
and the level of investment
would increase. The new and
better equipment would lead to a
rise in labor productivity, which
would ultimately manifest itself
in a higher level of national in
come. The alternative to follow
ing such policies will be a future
for Americans in which, Boskin
warns, "our standard of living
will fall behind that of other
societies."
Perhaps the most likely of
Boskin's policies to be im
plemented in the near future are
his ideas on the budgetary pro
cess. Principally focusing upon
the government's budget as his
second branch of research, Bos
kin has devised a number of
proposals which may soon show
up as a federal budget reform
and control act.
For instance, Boskin points
out that not all of the govern
ment's expenditures (such as the
National Direct Student Loan
program) are even included in
the federal budget. Hence, in
1981, when the Carter administ
ration boasts of a balanced
budget, there will in fact be a $40
billion "off-budget" deficit.
Boskin would modify the
budgetary process so that such
outside expenditures would be
included. "In inflationary
times," he noted, "you want to
have a really good idea of what
the true deficit is."
A second Boskin modification
would be the inclusion of "man
dated private activity" in the
budget. Thus, when the govern
ment tells a consumer to spend
$100 on a catalytic converter for
his car, the $ 1 00 would appear in
the budget the same way as if the
government had simply taxed
the consumer $100 and given it
to the car manufacturer for in
stalling the converter. As it is
now, the $100 shows up in the
national accounts under gross
auto sales.
Boskin would further have the
government include a separate
"capital account" in its budget.
In this way, during a year in
which the government let its
machines and buildings run
down, the value of the capital de


Growth
of gov't
spending

terioration would count as an
expenditure. Boskin's reasoning
is that the buildings and
machines will eventually have to
he repaired or replaced because
of the lack of outright spending
during that one year.
The ultimate effect of these re
forms will be to make the budget,
in Boskin's words, "a proper
measure of the economic impact
of government policies."
The third branch of Boskin's
research has dealt with a number
of problems developing — or
soon to develop — in the Social
Security system.
Early retirement
In a paper written for Stan
ford's Center for Research in
Economic Growth, Boskin links
enormous decreases in labor
force participation rate of elderly
males to growth of Social Sec

urity benefits. As Boskin put it.
"The growth of Social Security
benefits has led to an explosion
of early retirement."
The increasing number of
people leaving their jobs to join
the government dole is placing
the long-term solvency of the en
tire retirement benefit system in
jeopardy. Boskin has calculated
the present-day value of the up
coming Social Security deficit to
be over $750 billion. To meet
this financial burden, Boskin
foresees that "We will have to
raise Social Security taxes to
21-23 percent of payroll by the
year 2020."
To avoid such a state of affairs,
Boskin advocates phasing an in
crease into the ages of full and
partial eligibility. In addition, he
would seek to separate the
earned entitlements portion of
the Social Security check from

the transfer payment portion. In
other words, retirees above the
poverty line would receive only a
sum proportional to what they
had paid in, while those below
the poverty line would receive
their entitlement plus a welfare
payment.
In reference to his proposals,
Boskin said, "My own estimates
show that this would not only
eliminate the deficit, but would
also generate a surpl us that could
mean lower taxes."
This sort of optimism pervades
nearly all of Boskin's work. And
this optimism in the face of to
day's intimidating economic
maladies, combined with an im
pressive record of research, has
made Boskin one of the promi
nent figures in one of the
economics profession's most
challenging periods.
Lately, on nearly any day,
news of the economy has been
dismal. Inflation is soaring, in
comes are stagnant, productivity
is falling. The nation's economic
pulse, as measured by the stock
market, has been sluggish and
weak. Not since the Great De
pression have so many funda
mental questions been posed
about the viability of American
capitalism. And not since the
Great Depression have the pub
lic. the press and the legislature
turned in such earnest to the
economics profession for
answers.
In 1930, it was the British
economist John Maynard
Keynes whose theory penetrated
the inscrutable depression. Half
a century later, a small group of
young American economists is
rallying to the call of a nation
mired in a debilitating economic
malaise. Among the leaders of
that group is 34-year-old Stan
ford economist Michael Boskin.
Ironically, the enormously
popular cure for the Great De
pression which Keynes
suggested is the disease from
which th£ modern U.S. economy
is currently suffering. Asa result,
Boskin and his peers are search
ing for new, or at least long for
gotten. solutions.
Keynes and today's older gen
eration of economists who were
weaned on "Keynesianism." ad
vocated large government ex
penditures to prop up the droop
ing demand for goods and ser
vices which periodically drove
the economy into recession.
In the post j World War II era,
this "demand management" was
used with increasing frequency
for a number of reasons. The rise
in the political power of labor
unions, low-income groups and
minorities made it almost un
thinkable for the government to
allow recessions to occur, since it
felt that these groups suffered
excessively during economic
turndowns. In addition, the wars
in Korea and Vietnam, the space
race and the Johnson-Kennedy
"Great Society" programs
brought the scope of government
spending to unparalled heights.
In 1929, the government's share
of the nation's output had been a
tenth. By the end of the 19705,
that share had grown to over a
third.
To finance these growing ex
penditures, total taxes have risen
by 300 percent, and the federal
monetary authorities have ex
panded the nation's money sup
ply at dramatic rates.
Economic healer
It is the effect of these policies
on the health of the American
economy to which Boskin has
devoted the majority of his re
search efforts since coming to
Stanford in 1971.
Boskin, a native of New York
who grew up in Los Angeles, did
his undergraduate work at UC-
Berkeley. After a disappointing
introduction to the department
of economics at Harvard —
which lasted less than a week —
Boskin returned to Berkeley,
where he completed his docto
rate in less than four years.
The transition from the large
public school atmosphere of
Berkeley to the more cloistered
Stanford environment seems to
have agreed with Boskin. "I wish
Stanford were a little closer to
San Francisco," said the unmar
ried Boskin. "But I like the idea
of the campus set apart from the
city."
Boskin, whose stay at Ber

economic policy," he said.
Whether or not the University
administration will support Bos
kin's design is uncertain, but the
rest of the country is increasingly
taking notice of him and his
work. Referred to in Time
magazine as one of the
"brightest younger economists"
on the nation's campuses, Bos
kin and his ideas are gaining a
larger audience in Washington.
He is regularly in contact with a
number of federal legislators, in
cluding such economic kingpins
as Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-lnd ),
the next chairman of Congress'
Joint Economic Committee.
What Boskin is bringing to the
nation's decision-makers is not
only a thoughtful analysis of the
impact of government on the
economy, but also a set of prop
osals for improving government
policy where its impact is nega
tive.
Three-fold plans
Basically. Boskin's research
falls into three categories, the
first of which deals with the ef
fect of government policies on
private decision-making. In par
ticular. Boskin is looking at the
effect of current tax policies on
patterns of saving and invest
ment. He is also developing
hypotheses about the potential
effects of alternative tax policies
on those same elements.
Most importantly, Boskin has
noted that our current system of
taxing incomes, both at the per
sonal and the corporate level.

has the effect of diverting re
sources from saving to spending.
To reverse this trend, Boskin has
become a proponent of the idea
that spending, and not the earn
ing of income, should be the
basis upon which people are
taxed. This would have the effect
of encouraging people to save,
which leads to growth in the
economy. And it would encour
age people to not spend their
money, resulting in a relaxation
of the inflationary tension cur
rently straining the economy.
Justification
While the abolition of the cor
porate and personal income
taxes and the imposition of an
expenditure tax may appear to
put a far greater tax burden on
middle and lower income work
ers, Boskin argues that, to some
extent, the regressive effects of
such a plan would be mitigated
by increases in growth and pro
ductivity. "If we produce more,
that will create by far the most
favorable milieu for low income

people to improve their standard
of living," he said.
He admitted, though, that his
plan would have some regressive
aspects. "There are," Boskin al
lowed. "income distribution
questions we will have to face if
we abolish the corporate income
tax."
Boskin has also found that be
cause income from investments
is taxed on a nominal basis —
meaning that no adjustment is
made for changes in the price

level — inflation has a particu
larly stifling effect on invest
ment. He therefore advocates a
strict and predictable policy gov
erning monetary growth, so that
inflation will not, among its other
ill effects, cause an erosion of the
American capital stock and
consequently, a decline in Ameri
can industrial productivity.
Still another issue in this area
that Boskin has raised is the de
sirability of the government's
ever-increasing share of the na
tion's yearly output." 1 don't cur
rently favor spending limits," he
commented, "but recently it
(government expenditure) has
gotten out of control." To rectify
the situation, Boskin advocates a
policy which would slow the rate
of growth of government spend
ing.
Alternatives
Of course, Boskin is aware
that the changes he has
suggested are dramatic ones, and
he docs have some alternative
suggestions which would be

more practical in the short
run. Among these is an accelera
tion of the depreciation allo
wance, which would make it pos
sible for businesses to deduct
larger amounts from their taxes
after buying new equipment.
Outlays would consequently
become more profitable to firms,
and the level of investment
would increase. The new and
better equipment would lead to a
rise in labor productivity, which
would ultimately manifest itself
in a higher level of national in
come. The alternative to follow
ing such policies will be a future
for Americans in which, Boskin
warns, "our standard of living
will fall behind that of other
societies."
Perhaps the most likely of
Boskin's policies to be im
plemented in the near future are
his ideas on the budgetary pro
cess. Principally focusing upon
the government's budget as his
second branch of research, Bos
kin has devised a number of
proposals which may soon show
up as a federal budget reform
and control act.
For instance, Boskin points
out that not all of the govern
ment's expenditures (such as the
National Direct Student Loan
program) are even included in
the federal budget. Hence, in
1981, when the Carter administ
ration boasts of a balanced
budget, there will in fact be a $40
billion "off-budget" deficit.
Boskin would modify the
budgetary process so that such
outside expenditures would be
included. "In inflationary
times," he noted, "you want to
have a really good idea of what
the true deficit is."
A second Boskin modification
would be the inclusion of "man
dated private activity" in the
budget. Thus, when the govern
ment tells a consumer to spend
$100 on a catalytic converter for
his car, the $ 1 00 would appear in
the budget the same way as if the
government had simply taxed
the consumer $100 and given it
to the car manufacturer for in
stalling the converter. As it is
now, the $100 shows up in the
national accounts under gross
auto sales.
Boskin would further have the
government include a separate
"capital account" in its budget.
In this way, during a year in
which the government let its
machines and buildings run
down, the value of the capital de


Growth
of gov't
spending

terioration would count as an
expenditure. Boskin's reasoning
is that the buildings and
machines will eventually have to
he repaired or replaced because
of the lack of outright spending
during that one year.
The ultimate effect of these re
forms will be to make the budget,
in Boskin's words, "a proper
measure of the economic impact
of government policies."
The third branch of Boskin's
research has dealt with a number
of problems developing — or
soon to develop — in the Social
Security system.
Early retirement
In a paper written for Stan
ford's Center for Research in
Economic Growth, Boskin links
enormous decreases in labor
force participation rate of elderly
males to growth of Social Sec

urity benefits. As Boskin put it.
"The growth of Social Security
benefits has led to an explosion
of early retirement."
The increasing number of
people leaving their jobs to join
the government dole is placing
the long-term solvency of the en
tire retirement benefit system in
jeopardy. Boskin has calculated
the present-day value of the up
coming Social Security deficit to
be over $750 billion. To meet
this financial burden, Boskin
foresees that "We will have to
raise Social Security taxes to
21-23 percent of payroll by the
year 2020."
To avoid such a state of affairs,
Boskin advocates phasing an in
crease into the ages of full and
partial eligibility. In addition, he
would seek to separate the
earned entitlements portion of
the Social Security check from

the transfer payment portion. In
other words, retirees above the
poverty line would receive only a
sum proportional to what they
had paid in, while those below
the poverty line would receive
their entitlement plus a welfare
payment.
In reference to his proposals,
Boskin said, "My own estimates
show that this would not only
eliminate the deficit, but would
also generate a surpl us that could
mean lower taxes."
This sort of optimism pervades
nearly all of Boskin's work. And
this optimism in the face of to
day's intimidating economic
maladies, combined with an im
pressive record of research, has
made Boskin one of the promi
nent figures in one of the
economics profession's most
challenging periods.
Lately, on nearly any day,
news of the economy has been
dismal. Inflation is soaring, in
comes are stagnant, productivity
is falling. The nation's economic
pulse, as measured by the stock
market, has been sluggish and
weak. Not since the Great De
pression have so many funda
mental questions been posed
about the viability of American
capitalism. And not since the
Great Depression have the pub
lic. the press and the legislature
turned in such earnest to the
economics profession for
answers.
In 1930, it was the British
economist John Maynard
Keynes whose theory penetrated
the inscrutable depression. Half
a century later, a small group of
young American economists is
rallying to the call of a nation
mired in a debilitating economic
malaise. Among the leaders of
that group is 34-year-old Stan
ford economist Michael Boskin.
Ironically, the enormously
popular cure for the Great De
pression which Keynes
suggested is the disease from
which th£ modern U.S. economy
is currently suffering. Asa result,
Boskin and his peers are search
ing for new, or at least long for
gotten. solutions.
Keynes and today's older gen
eration of economists who were
weaned on "Keynesianism." ad
vocated large government ex
penditures to prop up the droop
ing demand for goods and ser
vices which periodically drove
the economy into recession.
In the post j World War II era,
this "demand management" was
used with increasing frequency
for a number of reasons. The rise
in the political power of labor
unions, low-income groups and
minorities made it almost un
thinkable for the government to
allow recessions to occur, since it
felt that these groups suffered
excessively during economic
turndowns. In addition, the wars
in Korea and Vietnam, the space
race and the Johnson-Kennedy
"Great Society" programs
brought the scope of government
spending to unparalled heights.
In 1929, the government's share
of the nation's output had been a
tenth. By the end of the 19705,
that share had grown to over a
third.
To finance these growing ex
penditures, total taxes have risen
by 300 percent, and the federal
monetary authorities have ex
panded the nation's money sup
ply at dramatic rates.
Economic healer
It is the effect of these policies
on the health of the American
economy to which Boskin has
devoted the majority of his re
search efforts since coming to
Stanford in 1971.
Boskin, a native of New York
who grew up in Los Angeles, did
his undergraduate work at UC-
Berkeley. After a disappointing
introduction to the department
of economics at Harvard —
which lasted less than a week —
Boskin returned to Berkeley,
where he completed his docto
rate in less than four years.
The transition from the large
public school atmosphere of
Berkeley to the more cloistered
Stanford environment seems to
have agreed with Boskin. "I wish
Stanford were a little closer to
San Francisco," said the unmar
ried Boskin. "But I like the idea
of the campus set apart from the
city."
Boskin, whose stay at Ber
keley from 1964 to 1971 coin
cided with a period of intense
campus turmoil and violence,
finds it hard to make compari
sons between the two rival
schools. "1 was at Berkeley when

there was a lot of unrest," Boskin
offered. "I got an unusual
perspective on the place."
Nonetheless, Boskin is able to
make some distinctions between
the schools. In particular, he
noted that Stanford professors
generally take their under
graduate students more seriously
than the Berkeley professo
took theirs. And he added that a
closer intellectual relationship
exists between professors and
graduate students here than
existed at either Berkeley or
Harvard, where he was a visiting
professor in 1977-78.
Although he feels a strong
commitment to teaching, Boskin
considers research to be his
primary concern. And at Stan
ford he has found the tools
necessary for doing his kind of
research. Intellectual stimula
tion from his colleagues and
graduate students makes a sig
nificant contribution to his work,
as does access to computer
facilities and funding sources.
Up to date
Of particular importance to
Boskin is his position at the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Re
search. As an economist for the
Bureau — which is located adja
cent to the Stanford Golf Course
— Boskin is able to participate in
a seminar and workshop prog
ram which brings the authors of
the newest research in
economics to Stanford. This
work, he observed, enables him
to keep abreast of current re
search. which is often published
only after a delay of several
years.
A specialist in the analysis of
government policies, Boskin
adds a new dimension to Stan
ford's economics department.
Owing mostly to the great dis-

Economics

tance between Palo Alto and
Washington, D C., Stanford has
rarely been a home for the na
tion's experts on economic pol
icy. Traditionally, Stanford has
attracted distinguished experts
on mathematical economics,
econometrics and economic
theory.
But the major figures in the
field of economic policy analysis
(which includes such areas as ta
xation, federal spending and
monetary regulation) have re
mained on the East Coast, where
they could be near the nation's
economic capitals: Washington
for the public sector. New York
for the private sector. It has been
from the ivy-covered halls of
Harvard, Princeton, Yale and
the University of Pennsylvania,
as well as the University of
Chicago and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, that
cabinet members and presiden
tial advisors have been selected.

Boskin is, however, an excep

sirability of the government's
ever-increasing share of the na
tion's yearly output." 1 don't cur
rently favor spending limits," he
commented, "but recently it
(government expenditure) has
gotten out of control." To rectify
the situation, Boskin advocates a
policy which would slow the rate
of growth of government spend
ing.
Alternatives
Of course, Boskin is aware
that the changes he has
suggested are dramatic ones, and
he docs have some alternative
suggestions which would be

more practical in the short
run. Among these is an accelera
tion of the depreciation allo
wance, which would make it pos
sible for businesses to deduct
larger amounts from their taxes
after buying new equipment.
Outlays would consequently
become more profitable to firms,
and the level of investment
would increase. The new and
better equipment would lead to a
rise in labor productivity, which
would ultimately manifest itself
in a higher level of national in
come. The alternative to follow
ing such policies will be a future
for Americans in which, Boskin
warns, "our standard of living
will fall behind that of other
societies."
Perhaps the most likely of
Boskin's policies to be im
plemented in the near future are
his ideas on the budgetary pro
cess. Principally focusing upon
the government's budget as his
second branch of research, Bos
kin has devised a number of
proposals which may soon show
up as a federal budget reform
and control act.
For instance, Boskin points
out that not all of the govern
ment's expenditures (such as the
National Direct Student Loan
program) are even included in
the federal budget. Hence, in
1981, when the Carter administ
ration boasts of a balanced
budget, there will in fact be a $40
billion "off-budget" deficit.
Boskin would modify the
budgetary process so that such
outside expenditures would be
included. "In inflationary
times," he noted, "you want to
have a really good idea of what
the true deficit is."
A second Boskin modification
would be the inclusion of "man
dated private activity" in the
budget. Thus, when the govern
ment tells a consumer to spend
$100 on a catalytic converter for
his car, the $ 1 00 would appear in
the budget the same way as if the
government had simply taxed
the consumer $100 and given it
to the car manufacturer for in
stalling the converter. As it is
now, the $100 shows up in the
national accounts under gross
auto sales.
Boskin would further have the
government include a separate
"capital account" in its budget.
In this way, during a year in
which the government let its
machines and buildings run
down, the value of the capital de


Growth
of gov't
spending

terioration would count as an
expenditure. Boskin's reasoning
is that the buildings and
machines will eventually have to
he repaired or replaced because
of the lack of outright spending
during that one year.
The ultimate effect of these re
forms will be to make the budget,
in Boskin's words, "a proper
measure of the economic impact
of government policies."
The third branch of Boskin's
research has dealt with a number
of problems developing — or
soon to develop — in the Social
Security system.
Early retirement
In a paper written for Stan
ford's Center for Research in
Economic Growth, Boskin links
enormous decreases in labor
force participation rate of elderly
males to growth of Social Sec

urity benefits. As Boskin put it.
"The growth of Social Security
benefits has led to an explosion
of early retirement."
The increasing number of
people leaving their jobs to join
the government dole is placing
the long-term solvency of the en
tire retirement benefit system in
jeopardy. Boskin has calculated
the present-day value of the up
coming Social Security deficit to
be over $750 billion. To meet
this financial burden, Boskin
foresees that "We will have to
raise Social Security taxes to
21-23 percent of payroll by the
year 2020."
To avoid such a state of affairs,
Boskin advocates phasing an in
crease into the ages of full and
partial eligibility. In addition, he
would seek to separate the
earned entitlements portion of
the Social Security check from

the transfer payment portion. In
other words, retirees above the
poverty line would receive only a
sum proportional to what they
had paid in, while those below
the poverty line would receive
their entitlement plus a welfare
payment.
In reference to his proposals,
Boskin said, "My own estimates
show that this would not only
eliminate the deficit, but would
also generate a surpl us that could
mean lower taxes."
This sort of optimism pervades
nearly all of Boskin's work. And
this optimism in the face of to
day's intimidating economic
maladies, combined with an im
pressive record of research, has
made Boskin one of the promi
nent figures in one of the
economics profession's most
challenging periods.
Lately, on nearly any day,
news of the economy has been
dismal. Inflation is soaring, in
comes are stagnant, productivity
is falling. The nation's economic
pulse, as measured by the stock
market, has been sluggish and
weak. Not since the Great De
pression have so many funda
mental questions been posed
about the viability of American
capitalism. And not since the
Great Depression have the pub
lic. the press and the legislature
turned in such earnest to the
economics profession for
answers.
In 1930, it was the British
economist John Maynard
Keynes whose theory penetrated
the inscrutable depression. Half
a century later, a small group of
young American economists is
rallying to the call of a nation
mired in a debilitating economic
malaise. Among the leaders of
that group is 34-year-old Stan
ford economist Michael Boskin.
Ironically, the enormously
popular cure for the Great De
pression which Keynes
suggested is the disease from
which th£ modern U.S. economy
is currently suffering. Asa result,
Boskin and his peers are search
ing for new, or at least long for
gotten. solutions.
Keynes and today's older gen
eration of economists who were
weaned on "Keynesianism." ad
vocated large government ex
penditures to prop up the droop
ing demand for goods and ser
vices which periodically drove
the economy into recession.
In the post j World War II era,
this "demand management" was
used with increasing frequency
for a number of reasons. The rise
in the political power of labor
unions, low-income groups and
minorities made it almost un
thinkable for the government to
allow recessions to occur, since it
felt that these groups suffered
excessively during economic
turndowns. In addition, the wars
in Korea and Vietnam, the space
race and the Johnson-Kennedy
"Great Society" programs
brought the scope of government
spending to unparalled heights.
In 1929, the government's share
of the nation's output had been a
tenth. By the end of the 19705,
that share had grown to over a
third.
To finance these growing ex
penditures, total taxes have risen
by 300 percent, and the federal
monetary authorities have ex
panded the nation's money sup
ply at dramatic rates.
Economic healer
It is the effect of these policies
on the health of the American
economy to which Boskin has
devoted the majority of his re
search efforts since coming to
Stanford in 1971.
Boskin, a native of New York
who grew up in Los Angeles, did
his undergraduate work at UC-
Berkeley. After a disappointing
introduction to the department
of economics at Harvard —
which lasted less than a week —
Boskin returned to Berkeley,
where he completed his docto
rate in less than four years.
The transition from the large
public school atmosphere of
Berkeley to the more cloistered
Stanford environment seems to
have agreed with Boskin. "I wish
Stanford were a little closer to
San Francisco," said the unmar
ried Boskin. "But I like the idea
of the campus set apart from the
city."
Boskin, whose stay at Ber
keley from 1964 to 1971 coin
cided with a period of intense
campus turmoil and violence,
finds it hard to make compari
sons between the two rival
schools. "1 was at Berkeley when

there was a lot of unrest," Boskin
offered. "I got an unusual
perspective on the place."
Nonetheless, Boskin is able to
make some distinctions between
the schools. In particular, he
noted that Stanford professors
generally take their under
graduate students more seriously
than the Berkeley professo
took theirs. And he added that a
closer intellectual relationship
exists between professors and
graduate students here than
existed at either Berkeley or
Harvard, where he was a visiting
professor in 1977-78.
Although he feels a strong
commitment to teaching, Boskin
considers research to be his
primary concern. And at Stan
ford he has found the tools
necessary for doing his kind of
research. Intellectual stimula
tion from his colleagues and
graduate students makes a sig
nificant contribution to his work,
as does access to computer
facilities and funding sources.
Up to date
Of particular importance to
Boskin is his position at the Na
tional Bureau of Economic Re
search. As an economist for the
Bureau — which is located adja
cent to the Stanford Golf Course
— Boskin is able to participate in
a seminar and workshop prog
ram which brings the authors of
the newest research in
economics to Stanford. This
work, he observed, enables him
to keep abreast of current re
search. which is often published
only after a delay of several
years.
A specialist in the analysis of
government policies, Boskin
adds a new dimension to Stan
ford's economics department.
Owing mostly to the great dis-

Economics

tance between Palo Alto and
Washington, D C., Stanford has
rarely been a home for the na
tion's experts on economic pol
icy. Traditionally, Stanford has
attracted distinguished experts
on mathematical economics,
econometrics and economic
theory.
But the major figures in the
field of economic policy analysis
(which includes such areas as ta
xation, federal spending and
monetary regulation) have re
mained on the East Coast, where
they could be near the nation's
economic capitals: Washington
for the public sector. New York
for the private sector. It has been
from the ivy-covered halls of
Harvard, Princeton, Yale and
the University of Pennsylvania,
as well as the University of
Chicago and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, that
cabinet members and presiden
tial advisors have been selected.
Exception
Boskin is, however, an excep

tion to the rule. His studies fre
quently address federal govern
ment policy, and he advocates a
greater emphasis on this sort of
research here at Stanford. "The
real challenge at Stanford is to
build up a good group of
economists doing research into
economic policy," he said.
Whether or not the University
administration will support Bos
kin's design is uncertain, but the
rest of the country is increasingly
taking notice of him and his
work. Referred to in Time
magazine as one of the
"brightest younger economists"
on the nation's campuses, Bos
kin and his ideas are gaining a
larger audience in Washington.
He is regularly in contact with a
number of federal legislators, in
cluding such economic kingpins
as Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-lnd ),
the next chairman of Congress'
Joint Economic Committee.
What Boskin is bringing to the
nation's decision-makers is not
only a thoughtful analysis of the
impact of government on the
economy, but also a set of prop
osals for improving government
policy where its impact is nega
tive.
Three-fold plans
Basically. Boskin's research
falls into three categories, the
first of which deals with the ef
fect of government policies on
private decision-making. In par
ticular. Boskin is looking at the
effect of current tax policies on
patterns of saving and invest
ment. He is also developing
hypotheses about the potential
effects of alternative tax policies
on those same elements.
Most importantly, Boskin has
noted that our current system of
taxing incomes, both at the per
sonal and the corporate level.

has the effect of diverting re
sources from saving to spending.
To reverse this trend, Boskin has
become a proponent of the idea
that spending, and not the earn
ing of income, should be the
basis upon which people are
taxed. This would have the effect
of encouraging people to save,
which leads to growth in the
economy. And it would encour
age people to not spend their
money, resulting in a relaxation
of the inflationary tension cur
rently straining the economy.
Justification
While the abolition of the cor
porate and personal income
taxes and the imposition of an
expenditure tax may appear to
put a far greater tax burden on
middle and lower income work
ers, Boskin argues that, to some
extent, the regressive effects of
such a plan would be mitigated
by increases in growth and pro
ductivity. "If we produce more,
that will create by far the most
favorable milieu for low income

people to improve their standard
of living," he said.
He admitted, though, that his
plan would have some regressive
aspects. "There are," Boskin al
lowed. "income distribution
questions we will have to face if
we abolish the corporate income
tax."
Boskin has also found that be
cause income from investments
is taxed on a nominal basis —
meaning that no adjustment is
made for changes in the price

level — inflation has a particu
larly stifling effect on invest
ment. He therefore advocates a
strict and predictable policy gov
erning monetary growth, so that
inflation will not, among its other
ill effects, cause an erosion of the
American capital stock and
consequently, a decline in Ameri
can industrial productivity.
Still another issue in this area
that Boskin has raised is the de
sirability of the government's
ever-increasing share of the na
tion's yearly output." 1 don't cur
rently favor spending limits," he
commented, "but recently it

The ultimate effect of these re
forms will be to make the budget,
in Boskin's words, "a proper
measure of the economic impact
of government policies."
The third branch of Boskin's
research has dealt with a number
of problems developing — or
soon to develop — in the Social
Security system.
Early retirement
In a paper written for Stan
ford's Center for Research in
Economic Growth, Boskin links
enormous decreases in labor
force participation rate of elderly
males to growth of Social Sec

urity benefits. As Boskin put it.
"The growth of Social Security
benefits has led to an explosion
of early retirement."
The increasing number of
people leaving their jobs to join
the government dole is placing
the long-term solvency of the en
tire retirement benefit system in
jeopardy. Boskin has calculated
the present-day value of the up
coming Social Security deficit to
be over $750 billion. To meet
this financial burden, Boskin
foresees that "We will have to
raise Social Security taxes to
21-23 percent of payroll by the
year 2020."
To avoid such a state of affairs,
Boskin advocates phasing an in
crease into the ages of full and
partial eligibility. In addition, he
would seek to separate the
earned entitlements portion of
the Social Security check from

the transfer payment portion. In
other words, retirees above the
poverty line would receive only a
sum proportional to what they
had paid in, while those below
the poverty line would receive
their entitlement plus a welfare
payment.
In reference to his proposals,
Boskin said, "My own estimates
show that this would not only
eliminate the deficit, but would
also generate a surpl us that could
mean lower taxes."
This sort of optimism pervades
nearly all of Boskin's work. And
this optimism in the face of to
day's intimidating economic
maladies, combined with an im
pressive record of research, has
made Boskin one of the promi
nent figures in one of the
economics profession's most
challenging periods.
