# Eddelman: Energizing stage
## 
### Karen Wada 
"We expect frontier research
in laboratories or medical
schools, but we often don't ex
pect it in the realm of art. But, as
a theater designer, 1 am very in
terested in knowing where the
frontiers of art are. I want to get
to the farthest, the most innova
tive and the most adventure
some."
Assoc. Drama Prof. Bill Ed
delman paused, perhaps to relish
the appalling size of his ambi
tions. He seems to thrive on the
far-ranging, never-ending di
mensions of his search for design
frontiers.
He likens himself to a detec
tive or a scientist — chasing
clues and piecing patterns from
information gathered on trips to
Europe or found in the books,
papers and slides which fill his
office.
The search has led Eddelman
to the European continent (four
times in 10 years), especially to
the eastern bloc, where, he said,
experimental theater is flourish
ing.
It also has left him waiting for
a time when American theater
will catch up to the European,
when it will lose its "notorious
conservatism" and the limits
bred into its popular artistic vis
ion by "a people who grew up on
television and the movies."
The scope and spirit of Ed
delman's research are
exemplified by a sabbatical trip
which he took in 1977. In 11
months, he saw 125 productions
and visited 22 cities, from Hel
sinki to Milan, Munich to Lenin
grad
A high point, he said, was the
two months he spent in eastern
Europe, "where the advances in
theater design are amazing."
Eddelman visited the Warsaw
Center for International Theater
Studies and received a private
showing of slides of contempor
ary design at a Moscow scenog
raphy institute. He also spent 10
days at the headquarters of the
Prague Quadrennial, "the major
international scenic exhibit in
the world.
"I went through 14,000
photographs there, trying to es
tablish an overview of the work
done in the last 10 to 1 5 years,"
Eddelman said.
Research frame
An interview with Czechos
lovakia's Josef Svoboda, one of
the world's prominent designers,
gave Eddelman a frame of refer
ence for his research. "Svoboda
said that the Czechs were hurt by
the political atmosphere; they
are not allowed the degree of ex
pression which they had before.
He confirmed my suspicions that
the most intriguing theater is
happening in the German reper
tory companies — both east and
west."
The Berlin Wall apparently
does not divide the quality of ar
tistic experimentation. "Ger
many seems to have a national
sensibility in design which trans
cends politics," Eddelman
reasoned. "Besides, I am not as
concerned with ideological con
tent as I am with the way that
content is expressed visually."
The Soviet theater provided
"a real eye-opener." He was
surprised, he said, by the ad
vanced experimentation which
he found in a country "which is
so . . . repressed isn't the world
— controlled. The degree of con
trol there shocked me . . . but the
work is amazing."
Such innovation, he added, is
limited to theater design, which
is a transitory art form (unlike
painting or sculpture). "You can
put up a show, not many people
sec it, then it's gone."
Historical links
Soviet and German ex
perimentation "really shouldn't

be such a surprise. They both
contributed in a major way to
scenic evolution in the 20th cen
tury," the Germans with expres
sionism and political theater
groups, and the Russians with
constructivism." It is natural, he
said, that these nations should
continue to pursue scenic fron
tiers.
The American theater, which
often is controlled by "the ledger
effect," lags behind the Euro
pean. Important work is done
here, Eddelman said. He chided
the Living Theater, the Teatro
Campesino and the Snake Thea
ter, "exciting" groups with
"flaws." But. in general, he said,
the push to sell seats and to pro
duce hits has led to artistic con
servatism.
Scenic experimentation in
volves "the way a designer plugs
into the artistic currents of a
period, how he makes us re-see
the past, how he reflects chang
ing visual sensibilities and the
way they are used." Too often in
America, Eddelman said, this
thickness of ideas and images is
ignored. Surface naturalism and
shallow, superficial production
ideas are common.
"That's not to say," he added,
"that everything in Europe is
terrific. They've got a lot of gar-

Drama

bage, too."
Progress is being made on the
domestic scene, Eddelman
noted, especially in the sub
sidized world of university thea
ter. Freed from commercial obli
gations, colleges arc produeing
"some truly exciting work." Last
year in Prague, Eddelman gave a
paper on scenic design at Stan
ford. UC-Berkeley and UC-
Davis.
"The Americans at the con
ference said that the ideas I pre
sented could stand with most of
what was being done in the
European theaters — in terms of
ideas or content; we're not dis
cussing budgets."
In time, "it we develop a
higher sense of theatricality, we
can stand with the Europeans as
a nation."
li-grad roots
Eddelman s interest in design
reaches back to his under
graduate days. He earned a
bachelor's degree in pre-med
zoology, but he decided that he

did not have "the temperatment
to be a doctor." He did have an
interest in theater design, which
"was something I knew that 1
could really live with."
He earned a master's degree in
theater at Stanford, spent a year
at Cornell, then returned here
and finished his doctoral re
quirements in 1964. He studied
in Europe for one and a half
years on a Fulbright scholarship,
spending much of his time in
Venice at the Foundazione
Giorgio Cini, a research center
which concentrates on the his
tory of the Venetian republic.
Eddelman also traveled in Au
stria. Germany, France and Eng
land, gathering material for a
dissertation on the development
of the landscape on the 16th to
19th century Italian opera stage.
Expo ideas
His interest in avant-garde de
sign was triggered, in a way, by
Montreal's Expo '67. Before
joining the Stanford faculty in
1970, Eddelman taught in
Canada for three years. "I was at
the University of Calgary, where
he had a group of French and
English and Czech . . . people
very interested in visual ex
perimentation."
The Canadian exposition's
Czech pavilion reminded Ed

delman of the exciting theater
work he had seen in Europe.
Calgary's stimulating academic
atmosphere, plus the Czech
exhibit "started my desire to find
the most innovative theater in
the world. The search began.
Right now, it has led Eddel
man to "neo-naturalism . . this
is where we arc today in design.
In a Munich production ot
Oediups Rex, Eddelman said,
"the scenes were 'natural with
moments, sections that moved
into abstraction. They used flat
theatrical painting, real water (or
a naturalist effect, debris on the
stage, crumpled objects almost
like 'found objects' which were
incorporated into the dramatic
exchange.
"There's a continual fluctua
tion in which the mind and the
eye of the spectator have to de
termine the theatrical reality ol a
production."
The theater has turned to such
blendings of forms and inter-

pretative realities, because "we
are at the dead end of abstrac
tion. in the sense that we have
gone about as far as we can with
pure abstract form."
The new path, neo
naturalism. offers a "textual
abstraction" and a "distortion
and division of reality," which
Eddelman is using in his designs
for Poor Murderer, the Drama
Department's May production.
Eddelman is writing a book on
the scenographic image in con
temporary design. He also is
writing two children's books, one
tracing the genealogy of a cat.the
other a "dragon book" which
deals with aspects of to

talitarianism; "these are for ad
vanced children or youngish
adults."
With so much research on
other people's theater successes,
Eddelman has definite ideas
about his own "ideal" produc
tions. He would like to design
"some highly theatrical plays,
such as The Bacchaelor, Genet's
The Balcony.
"I would use fragmentations
of reality, abstract scenery, mask
forms, interesting combinations
of fabric, mirrors, mannerist dis
tortions of space." Eddelman
laughed. "Some people would
say 1 was creating a nightmare."
But, of course, for him, it
would be a dream world.
"We expect frontier research
in laboratories or medical
schools, but we often don't ex
pect it in the realm of art. But, as
a theater designer, 1 am very in
terested in knowing where the
frontiers of art are. I want to get

here, Eddelman said. He chided
the Living Theater, the Teatro
Campesino and the Snake Thea
ter, "exciting" groups with
"flaws." But. in general, he said,
the push to sell seats and to pro
duce hits has led to artistic con
servatism.
Scenic experimentation in
volves "the way a designer plugs
into the artistic currents of a
period, how he makes us re-see
the past, how he reflects chang
ing visual sensibilities and the
way they are used." Too often in
America, Eddelman said, this
thickness of ideas and images is
ignored. Surface naturalism and
shallow, superficial production
ideas are common.
"That's not to say," he added,
"that everything in Europe is
terrific. They've got a lot of gar-

Drama

bage, too."
Progress is being made on the
domestic scene, Eddelman
noted, especially in the sub
sidized world of university thea
ter. Freed from commercial obli
gations, colleges arc produeing
"some truly exciting work." Last
year in Prague, Eddelman gave a
paper on scenic design at Stan
ford. UC-Berkeley and UC-
Davis.
"The Americans at the con
ference said that the ideas I pre
sented could stand with most of
what was being done in the
European theaters — in terms of
ideas or content; we're not dis
cussing budgets."
In time, "it we develop a
higher sense of theatricality, we
can stand with the Europeans as
a nation."
li-grad roots
Eddelman s interest in design
reaches back to his under
graduate days. He earned a
bachelor's degree in pre-med
zoology, but he decided that he

did not have "the temperatment
to be a doctor." He did have an
interest in theater design, which
"was something I knew that 1
could really live with."
He earned a master's degree in
theater at Stanford, spent a year
at Cornell, then returned here
and finished his doctoral re
quirements in 1964. He studied
in Europe for one and a half
years on a Fulbright scholarship,
spending much of his time in
Venice at the Foundazione
Giorgio Cini, a research center
which concentrates on the his
tory of the Venetian republic.
Eddelman also traveled in Au
stria. Germany, France and Eng
land, gathering material for a
dissertation on the development
of the landscape on the 16th to
19th century Italian opera stage.
Expo ideas
His interest in avant-garde de
sign was triggered, in a way, by
Montreal's Expo '67. Before
joining the Stanford faculty in
1970, Eddelman taught in
Canada for three years. "I was at
the University of Calgary, where
he had a group of French and
English and Czech . . . people
very interested in visual ex
perimentation."
The Canadian exposition's
Czech pavilion reminded Ed

delman of the exciting theater
work he had seen in Europe.
Calgary's stimulating academic
atmosphere, plus the Czech
exhibit "started my desire to find
the most innovative theater in
the world. The search began.
Right now, it has led Eddel
man to "neo-naturalism . . this
is where we arc today in design.
In a Munich production ot
Oediups Rex, Eddelman said,
"the scenes were 'natural with
moments, sections that moved
into abstraction. They used flat
theatrical painting, real water (or
a naturalist effect, debris on the
stage, crumpled objects almost
like 'found objects' which were
incorporated into the dramatic
exchange.
"There's a continual fluctua
tion in which the mind and the
eye of the spectator have to de
termine the theatrical reality ol a
production."
The theater has turned to such
blendings of forms and inter-

pretative realities, because "we
are at the dead end of abstrac
tion. in the sense that we have
gone about as far as we can with
pure abstract form."
The new path, neo
naturalism. offers a "textual
abstraction" and a "distortion
and division of reality," which
Eddelman is using in his designs
for Poor Murderer, the Drama
Department's May production.
Eddelman is writing a book on
the scenographic image in con
temporary design. He also is
writing two children's books, one
tracing the genealogy of a cat.the
other a "dragon book" which
deals with aspects of to

talitarianism; "these are for ad
vanced children or youngish
adults."
With so much research on
other people's theater successes,
Eddelman has definite ideas
about his own "ideal" produc
tions. He would like to design
"some highly theatrical plays,
such as The Bacchaelor, Genet's
The Balcony.
"I would use fragmentations
of reality, abstract scenery, mask
forms, interesting combinations
of fabric, mirrors, mannerist dis
tortions of space." Eddelman
laughed. "Some people would
say 1 was creating a nightmare."
But, of course, for him, it
would be a dream world.
"We expect frontier research
in laboratories or medical
schools, but we often don't ex
pect it in the realm of art. But, as
a theater designer, 1 am very in
terested in knowing where the
frontiers of art are. I want to get
to the farthest, the most innova
tive and the most adventure
some."
Assoc. Drama Prof. Bill Ed
delman paused, perhaps to relish
the appalling size of his ambi
tions. He seems to thrive on the
far-ranging, never-ending di
mensions of his search for design
frontiers.
He likens himself to a detec
tive or a scientist — chasing
clues and piecing patterns from
information gathered on trips to
Europe or found in the books,
papers and slides which fill his
office.
The search has led Eddelman
to the European continent (four
times in 10 years), especially to
the eastern bloc, where, he said,
experimental theater is flourish
ing.
It also has left him waiting for
a time when American theater
will catch up to the European,
when it will lose its "notorious
conservatism" and the limits
bred into its popular artistic vis
ion by "a people who grew up on
television and the movies."
The scope and spirit of Ed
delman's research are
exemplified by a sabbatical trip
which he took in 1977. In 11
months, he saw 125 productions
and visited 22 cities, from Hel
sinki to Milan, Munich to Lenin
grad
A high point, he said, was the
two months he spent in eastern
Europe, "where the advances in
theater design are amazing."
Eddelman visited the Warsaw
Center for International Theater
Studies and received a private
showing of slides of contempor
ary design at a Moscow scenog
raphy institute. He also spent 10
days at the headquarters of the
Prague Quadrennial, "the major
international scenic exhibit in
the world.
"I went through 14,000
photographs there, trying to es
tablish an overview of the work
done in the last 10 to 1 5 years,"
Eddelman said.
Research frame
An interview with Czechos
lovakia's Josef Svoboda, one of
the world's prominent designers,
gave Eddelman a frame of refer
ence for his research. "Svoboda
said that the Czechs were hurt by
the political atmosphere; they
are not allowed the degree of ex
pression which they had before.
He confirmed my suspicions that
the most intriguing theater is
happening in the German reper
tory companies — both east and
west."
The Berlin Wall apparently
does not divide the quality of ar
tistic experimentation. "Ger
many seems to have a national
sensibility in design which trans
cends politics," Eddelman
reasoned. "Besides, I am not as
concerned with ideological con
tent as I am with the way that
content is expressed visually."
The Soviet theater provided
"a real eye-opener." He was
surprised, he said, by the ad
vanced experimentation which
he found in a country "which is
so . . . repressed isn't the world
— controlled. The degree of con
trol there shocked me . . . but the
work is amazing."
Such innovation, he added, is
limited to theater design, which
is a transitory art form (unlike
painting or sculpture). "You can
put up a show, not many people
sec it, then it's gone."
Historical links
Soviet and German ex
perimentation "really shouldn't

be such a surprise. They both
contributed in a major way to
scenic evolution in the 20th cen
tury," the Germans with expres
sionism and political theater
groups, and the Russians with
constructivism." It is natural, he
said, that these nations should
continue to pursue scenic fron
tiers.
The American theater, which
often is controlled by "the ledger
effect," lags behind the Euro
pean. Important work is done
here, Eddelman said. He chided
the Living Theater, the Teatro
Campesino and the Snake Thea
ter, "exciting" groups with
"flaws." But. in general, he said,

gone about as far as we can with
pure abstract form."
The new path, neo
naturalism. offers a "textual
abstraction" and a "distortion
and division of reality," which
Eddelman is using in his designs
for Poor Murderer, the Drama
Department's May production.
Eddelman is writing a book on
the scenographic image in con
temporary design. He also is
writing two children's books, one
tracing the genealogy of a cat.the
other a "dragon book" which
deals with aspects of to

talitarianism; "these are for ad
vanced children or youngish
adults."
With so much research on
other people's theater successes,
Eddelman has definite ideas
about his own "ideal" produc
tions. He would like to design
"some highly theatrical plays,
such as The Bacchaelor, Genet's
The Balcony.
"I would use fragmentations
of reality, abstract scenery, mask
forms, interesting combinations
of fabric, mirrors, mannerist dis
tortions of space." Eddelman
laughed. "Some people would
say 1 was creating a nightmare."
But, of course, for him, it
would be a dream world.
"We expect frontier research
in laboratories or medical
schools, but we often don't ex
pect it in the realm of art. But, as
a theater designer, 1 am very in
terested in knowing where the
frontiers of art are. I want to get
to the farthest, the most innova
tive and the most adventure
some."
Assoc. Drama Prof. Bill Ed
delman paused, perhaps to relish
the appalling size of his ambi
tions. He seems to thrive on the
far-ranging, never-ending di
mensions of his search for design
frontiers.
He likens himself to a detec
tive or a scientist — chasing
clues and piecing patterns from
information gathered on trips to
Europe or found in the books,
papers and slides which fill his
office.
The search has led Eddelman
to the European continent (four
times in 10 years), especially to
the eastern bloc, where, he said,
experimental theater is flourish
ing.
It also has left him waiting for
a time when American theater
will catch up to the European,
when it will lose its "notorious
conservatism" and the limits
bred into its popular artistic vis
ion by "a people who grew up on
television and the movies."
The scope and spirit of Ed
delman's research are
exemplified by a sabbatical trip
which he took in 1977. In 11
months, he saw 125 productions
and visited 22 cities, from Hel
sinki to Milan, Munich to Lenin
grad
A high point, he said, was the
two months he spent in eastern
Europe, "where the advances in
theater design are amazing."
Eddelman visited the Warsaw
Center for International Theater
Studies and received a private
showing of slides of contempor
ary design at a Moscow scenog
raphy institute. He also spent 10
days at the headquarters of the
Prague Quadrennial, "the major
international scenic exhibit in
the world.
"I went through 14,000
photographs there, trying to es
tablish an overview of the work
done in the last 10 to 1 5 years,"
Eddelman said.
Research frame
An interview with Czechos
lovakia's Josef Svoboda, one of
the world's prominent designers,
gave Eddelman a frame of refer
ence for his research. "Svoboda
said that the Czechs were hurt by
the political atmosphere; they
are not allowed the degree of ex
pression which they had before.
He confirmed my suspicions that
the most intriguing theater is
happening in the German reper
tory companies — both east and
west."
The Berlin Wall apparently
does not divide the quality of ar
tistic experimentation. "Ger
many seems to have a national
sensibility in design which trans
cends politics," Eddelman
reasoned. "Besides, I am not as
concerned with ideological con
tent as I am with the way that
content is expressed visually."
The Soviet theater provided
"a real eye-opener." He was
surprised, he said, by the ad
vanced experimentation which
he found in a country "which is
so . . . repressed isn't the world
— controlled. The degree of con
trol there shocked me . . . but the
work is amazing."
Such innovation, he added, is
limited to theater design, which
is a transitory art form (unlike
painting or sculpture). "You can
put up a show, not many people
sec it, then it's gone."
Historical links
Soviet and German ex
perimentation "really shouldn't

be such a surprise. They both
contributed in a major way to
scenic evolution in the 20th cen
tury," the Germans with expres
sionism and political theater
groups, and the Russians with
constructivism." It is natural, he
said, that these nations should
continue to pursue scenic fron
tiers.
The American theater, which
often is controlled by "the ledger
effect," lags behind the Euro
pean. Important work is done
here, Eddelman said. He chided
the Living Theater, the Teatro
Campesino and the Snake Thea
ter, "exciting" groups with
"flaws." But. in general, he said,
the push to sell seats and to pro
duce hits has led to artistic con
servatism.
Scenic experimentation in
volves "the way a designer plugs
into the artistic currents of a
period, how he makes us re-see
the past, how he reflects chang
ing visual sensibilities and the
way they are used." Too often in
America, Eddelman said, this
thickness of ideas and images is
ignored. Surface naturalism and
shallow, superficial production
ideas are common.
"That's not to say," he added,
"that everything in Europe is
terrific. They've got a lot of gar-

Drama

bage, too."
Progress is being made on the
domestic scene, Eddelman
noted, especially in the sub
sidized world of university thea
ter. Freed from commercial obli
gations, colleges arc produeing
"some truly exciting work." Last
year in Prague, Eddelman gave a
paper on scenic design at Stan
ford. UC-Berkeley and UC-
Davis.
"The Americans at the con
ference said that the ideas I pre
sented could stand with most of
what was being done in the
European theaters — in terms of
ideas or content; we're not dis
cussing budgets."
In time, "it we develop a
higher sense of theatricality, we
can stand with the Europeans as
a nation."
li-grad roots
Eddelman s interest in design
reaches back to his under
graduate days. He earned a
bachelor's degree in pre-med
zoology, but he decided that he

did not have "the temperatment
to be a doctor." He did have an
interest in theater design, which
"was something I knew that 1
could really live with."
He earned a master's degree in
theater at Stanford, spent a year
at Cornell, then returned here
and finished his doctoral re
quirements in 1964. He studied
in Europe for one and a half
years on a Fulbright scholarship,
spending much of his time in
Venice at the Foundazione
Giorgio Cini, a research center
which concentrates on the his
tory of the Venetian republic.
Eddelman also traveled in Au
stria. Germany, France and Eng
land, gathering material for a
dissertation on the development
of the landscape on the 16th to
19th century Italian opera stage.
Expo ideas
His interest in avant-garde de
sign was triggered, in a way, by
Montreal's Expo '67. Before
joining the Stanford faculty in
1970, Eddelman taught in
Canada for three years. "I was at
the University of Calgary, where
he had a group of French and
English and Czech . . . people
very interested in visual ex
perimentation."
The Canadian exposition's
Czech pavilion reminded Ed

delman of the exciting theater
work he had seen in Europe.
Calgary's stimulating academic
atmosphere, plus the Czech
exhibit "started my desire to find
the most innovative theater in
the world. The search began.
Right now, it has led Eddel
man to "neo-naturalism . . this
is where we arc today in design.
In a Munich production ot
Oediups Rex, Eddelman said,
"the scenes were 'natural with
moments, sections that moved
into abstraction. They used flat
theatrical painting, real water (or
a naturalist effect, debris on the
stage, crumpled objects almost
like 'found objects' which were
incorporated into the dramatic
exchange.
"There's a continual fluctua
tion in which the mind and the
eye of the spectator have to de
termine the theatrical reality ol a
production."
The theater has turned to such
blendings of forms and inter-

pretative realities, because "we
are at the dead end of abstrac
tion. in the sense that we have
gone about as far as we can with
pure abstract form."
The new path, neo
naturalism. offers a "textual
abstraction" and a "distortion
and division of reality," which
Eddelman is using in his designs
for Poor Murderer, the Drama
Department's May production.

temporary design. He also is
