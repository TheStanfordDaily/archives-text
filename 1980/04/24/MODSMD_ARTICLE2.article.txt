Research accounts for half the budget of this
university. It is a vital factor in determining who is
tenured to teach in our classrooms. It ranks
alongside instruction as the main purpose for the
existence of this institution, and it is the basis of
everything we are taught here. Yet few under
graduates have any direct exposure to research at
all, and only a rare individual has experienced the
growth of more than a single field. Research as a
broad, general human endeavor is admittedly an
amorphous notion to most of us. Hence we origi
nally conceived this magazine as an attempt to shed
some light on this nebulous pursuit.
We decided to reach for the concept by example,
asking each of our writers to delve into the work of
an individual professor, to describe the problems

each reseacher thinks about and the solutions each
proposes. We saw research as a personal effort, so
we asked our writers to look at their subjects' per
sonalities and the blendings of temperaments and
work. We hoped that, when synthesized, the total
would give some idea of research as a whole.
In retrospect, this goal was, of course, more elu
sive than we had thought. When we asked Dean of
Research Gerald Lieberman how he would define
the vast array of activity carried on under the gui
dance of his office, he could only call it the "explo
ration of new frontiers of knowledge." When we
asked what qualities make a good researcher, he
only laughed. We couldn't presume to draw any
better conclusions.
So what we bring you are the isolated pieces of a
portrait of research, in the form of profiles of 10
Stanford professors and their interests. These men
and women come from all corners of the Univer
sity, from drama to physics, from medicine to
economics. A few of them are already famous for
their discoveries, others were unknown to us until
we called their departments looking for stories.
Most of them are young, but all have already added
in some way to the store of human knowledge.
Though these articles in no way encompass re
search in the grand scope we originally envisioned,
if, after reading through this magazine, you have a
little better idea of what a history professor does
between classes, or what a geologist does on field
trips, then we have probably accomplished our
goal. Or at least come close.
We would like to especially thank our writers
and photographers; Gary Reyna, our graphic ar
tist; Jimmy Glanzer, Vic Goetz and Joan O'Con
nell for their cheerful help; and the professors for
their time and their indulgence in allowing us to
compress years' worth of thinking and exploration
into a few pages that cannot possibly do them jus
tice.

6 There are many gifts that are unique in man; but at the
center ofthem all, the root from which all knowledge
grows, lies the ability to draw conclusions from what we
see to what we do not see, to move our minds through
Space and time. ... Jacob Bronowski
