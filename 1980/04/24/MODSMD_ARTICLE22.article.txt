We arc living in the age of the
technocrat, in a society often de
nounced as desoid of morality.
Yet the \ ery technological prog
ress contributing to this corrup
tion of thought is enabling scho
lars to propel themselves back
ward through time to the eras of
philosophy — to more
thoroughly analyze the roots of
our ethical heritage.

lies. Professing an "interest in
the de\ elopment of ethical ter
minology.' he 4 has embarked
upon intriguing computer-based
research ' medieval texts.
Aristotle wrote the Nicomae
hean Ethics, considered to be the
foundation of Western ethical
thought, over 1600 years ago in
Greek. The original rendition
was then either translated from
Greek into Arabic into Hebrew
and Latin, or from Greek into
Latin into Hebrew. Berman's
challenge is to investigate the
precise wording of the various
translations to see if cultural and
religious influences changed the
meaning of Aristotle's text and if
so, in what ways.
"It's true that there is a strong
philosophical tradition based on
Aristotle's Nicomacheun Ethics
that connects different cultures,"
Berman began. So, many
peoples may have read the same
book but. because of language
nuances and slight shades of
meaning through translation, in
terpreted the text in varying
ways. "The question is to see if
people in different cultures have
the same underlying values," or

It's true that there is a strong
philosophical tradition based on Aris
totle's Nichomachian Ethics . . . The
question is to see if people in different
cultures have the same underlying val
ues . . .

if transmission discrepancies
created new philosophical
trends
Several phases
Lk Ii divides his work into
tlin. , ises. He describes his
first endeavor as "bread and but
ter philological work:" the basic
craft of publishing texts and es
tablishint.' translated texts as
closely as possible to the original.
The Arabic and Hebrew transla
tions of Aristotle's work have
never been published. Berman is
currently preparing the Hebrew
version, as well as other works,
for publication.
Secondly, Berman is using the
Center for Information
Technology (CIT) computer to
compile concordances of
medieval Hebrew, Arabic and
Latin writings. "My use of the
computer is fairly simple
minded," he claims. He enters
the desired material into tne
computer's data bank and then

generates an exhaustive index,
locating the citation of every
word. In this way. he can check
up on the meaning of each word
in many different contexts.
As a sidelight to this process,
he has been instrumental in de-,
veloping the capacity for foreign
text processing at CIT.
Berman's final goal is to "step
back and see the relationships
between texts as one moves from
milieu to milieu."
Pragmatic ends
Eventually. Berman hopes to
relate his findings to the amelio
ration of modern international

conflicts. "One of the reasons for
my work is not purely scholarly,"
he confesses. "It's a way of dis
passionately, from the point of
view of history, discovering some
kind of symbiosis between the
Jewish and Arab-Islamic cul
tures in the Middle Ages," he
explained.
Then, through this profes
sional understanding, "perhaps
we can facilitate a better under
standing between people of dif
ferent backgrounds. I'm refer
ring specifically to the Jewish Is
raelis, Muslims and Christian
Arabs in the Middle East today. I
really do think that's important."
Berman is well acquainted
with the present-day Middle
East, having resided in that reg
ion for over four years. After re
ceiving bachelor's degrees from
the University of Chicago and
the College of Jewish Studies
(Chicago), as well as a master's
from Brandeis University, he
earned his doctorate at the Heb
rew University of Jerusalem in,
1960.
Berman came to Stanford in
1967 from a professorship at The
Dropsie College in Philadelphia

and a one-year stint as a visiting
professor at UC-Berkeley. He
returned to Israel in 1977 to
teach for a year at the Hebrew
University of Jerusalem.
Influential idol
Berman acquired a mastery of
Hebrew at an early age, but dates
his career choice to a precise
moment in his studies. "I was
thunderstruck by Maimonides.
a 12th-century Jewish theolo
gian and philosopher. He impre
ssed me as a towering figure in
the law and its relation to
philosophy and religion.
"Since he was a hero, I wanted
to read him in the original
(Judeo-Arabic, which was spo
ken Irom Spain to Kgypt during
Maimonides' -). I studied
Arabic and then Cireck and be
came interested in the vast
panorama of culture from an
cient to our own times, particu
larly the play between religious
and philosophical outlooks."

Grasping time-honored lan
guages, Berman first whetted a
taste for the more embryonic
language of computers while at
Cal in 1965. Aided by a three
year research grant from the Na
tional Endowment for the
Humanities and a grant last year
trom the Israel Academy of Sci
ences and Humanities for his
current project, he has used his
basic computer knowledge to
help the people at CIT develop a
foreign text system with the
capability of processing French,
German, Hebrew, Japanese
(Katakana), Russian and

Spanish.
Time-consuming
Prior to the introduction of
this text processor and ClT's
3800 laser printer, entering
Hebrew (which reads right to
left) into a computer was labori
ously cumbersome. A typist skil
led in Hebrew keypunched the
tex'' 1 using a standard
Hebn. liter key pattern
on an English keypunch, produc
ing the text in reverse order. A
computer program then trans
lated these codes to correspond
ing characters on a Hebrew
typeball for an IBM Selectric
typewriter terminal and reversed
each line again. The text was at
last printed on that special ter
minal, and corrections were
made through yet another prog
ram.
The new system allows the
typist to enter Hebrew text, in
terspersed with English, directly
into the computer using a termi
nal with Hebrew/English
keycaps. Hie characters appear
right to left on the terminal sc
reen as they are typed, and the
text can be edited from the ter
minal. The high-speed laser
printer further circumvents the
need for special hardware, since
it can immediately produce al
most any symbol desired. The
necessity of changing the print
chain on the line printer is
thereby eliminated.
Back to cottage industry
Berman is enthusiastic about
the potential of these innova
tions. "The use of modern
technology has really opened up
the age of tomorrow. Because of
the new software capability, we
can create all kinds of letters in a
very flexible manner We can re
produce certain manuscripts that
we couldn't before."
He calls this computer
technology "a return to the age
of the handwritten book," when
a scholar would prepare a man
uscript from which the scribe
would directly produce copies.
The computer now functions as
the pen of both the scholar and
the scribe.
Before the invention of the
printing press, many mistakes
were made in the process of re
producing texts, and the scho
lar's actual work was often irret
rievably lost. Now, according to
Berman, "we can reproduce the
handwriting of the scholar. We
can be absolutely certain of what
the author has written. It's al
most paradoxical."

Thus, by refining computer
printing techniques, Berman is
precluding some research of the
type he is undertaking. For when
the author's original work is
readily available in unaltered
form, the transmission mistakes,
studied by Berman as "one of the
reasons why scholarly work
exists," will no longer occur.
Berman said he has nothing
but the highest praise for the
campus computing facilities:
CIT and the Artificial Intelli
gence labs who have cooperated
with him in his work. Overall, he
said, "It's been stimulating and

pleasant here, but not as
stimulating as it could have been.
'Tve been very disappointed
that I was not able to develop an
interest in Middle East studies
on a broader basis here. It's one
of the great holes in the cur
riculum at Stanford. Stanford
can hardly be called the Harvard
of the West as long as it does not
attempt to cover the important
areas of the Middle and Near
East."
Berman said he had worked
for establishment of endowed
professorships in various de
partments for the study of the
Middle East, but was frustrated
in his attempts. "Even the mini
mal support for Hebrew and
Arabic language classes was not
given, which restricts the ability

of the student to gain even a min
imal understanding of the cul
ture," he said.
Teaching schedule
Berman does, nonetheless,
teach several combined
undergraduate/graduate courses
on such subjects as Judaism and
Islam, prophets and prophecy,
Mohammed and the Koran,
Maimonides and Near Eastern
religion. He termed teaching in
his field here "somewhat iso
lated. I envy my colleagues in the
East Asian Studies Department
or in the religious studies area
with (Far Eastern) languages."
Berman just completed an ar
ticle on the Hebrew translation
from the Latin Nicotnachean
Ethics, including a sample of text
published for the first time. This
article will serve as a prototype
for his forthcoming book con
taining an edition of the Hebrew
translation from the Arabic. He
said that he will probably store
his completed translations on
microfiche or in some flexible
form, rather than bulky manus
cript. He will be publishing a
series of monographs to explain
his interpretive work in En
glish, so that "it will enter the
mainstream of history of cul
ture."
Besides addressing confer
ences, such as an American
Oriental com ention last week on
"Aristotle and Auerroes on The
End of Man," Berman is busy
translating a work written in
Judeo-Arabic by the 12th
century Jewish-Spanish thinker
Judah Halevi on the Jewish relig
ion. Berman said he is fascinated
by that work's "insights of
Judaism as a minority culture
against the overpowering rich
ness of Islam."
Moreover, Berman said that
he tries to "sum up and present
for people without linguistic ex
pertise the meaning" of aristote
lian ethics. Americans may be
becoming philistines, but Lawr
ence Berman and his computers
won't let them go without a fight.
