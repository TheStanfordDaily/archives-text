# Chowning: 'Carma,' the mastery of sound
## 
### Jiri Weiss 
Tucked away in the hills a few
miles from campus is a spacious
building with glass walls, a build
ing that is partly gutted thanks to
the Artificial Intelligence project
that abandoned the building a
year or so ago.
The building's only inhabit
ant is a group of musicians who
have been motivated by a com
mon goal to develop the compu
ter into a musical instrument and
to study the psychology and digi
tal representation of sound.
The project, the Center for
Computer Research in Music
(CCRMA), affectionately
known as "Carma" is a highly
interactive, interdisciplinary en
terprise.
There is research in digital re
cording, the analysis of natural
tones through digital signal pro
cessing, psychoacoustic re
search. and the automatic pro
duction of music scores.
Most of the researchers are
musicians by training who have
become motivated into becom
ing experts in computers and
electronics.
The goal of the project has
been, according to its director
John Chowning, himself a com
poser, to make true the dream of
Edgar Varese, a turn of the cen
tury American composer. Var
ese "dreamed of a world that we
have currently available to us. A
world of sound manipulation
where a composer can get at a
sound on a very elementary level
and create music that is more

analogous to a painter who is
able to mix his own colors,"
Chowning said.
Chowning became the student
of Leland Smith, a music profes
sor here, in 1964 and proposed
to study sound synthesis by a
computer as his thesis topic.
"I told him that I didn't know
anything about it and that he
could go ahead just as long as he
would teach me," said Smith.
Chowning and Smith divided
up the labor. Chowning took up
the sound generation end, Smith
the input and software.
For years the project struggled
without funding, according to
Smith, who has done most of his
research during his free time. In
1975 the CCRMA was formed
with funding from both the Na
tional Science Foundation and
National Endowment for the
Arts.
At first the results were not
very impressive, but a break
through came in 196S with the
development of a frequency
modulation technique that ena
bled Chowning to describe a
sound with fewer cumbersome
computations.
Natural sounds are a complex
mixture of frequencies. You

Artificial Intelligence

don't have to be a musician to be
able to tell the difference bet
ween the sound of a violin and an
oboe.
What enables you to tell in
struments apart is the complex
nature of their sounds. Each
sound has the quality musicians
call timbre that distinguishes one
instrument from another and
gives the richness to natural
sounds that many kinds of elec
tronic synthesizers cannot dupli
cate.
Another thing that makes
much of synthesized sound dull is
that it is stable and predictable.

"It is the small amount of unpre
dictability that keeps people in
terested and attentive," said
Chowning. The computer over
comes that difficulty because it
gives the programmer complete
control over his sound, allowing
him to recreate the full complex
ity of natural sound.
Recently, digital recordings
have started to appear on the
market, and they are a direct
outgrowth of projects like
C'howning's. Digital recording,
the method used '■■ Ovnvning,
minimizes distoition l ocalise
music is stored in ;i numerical
form and is not susceptible to the
kind of background noise that
accumulates in an ordinary re
cording.
Composing
I low do you actually go about
writing a composition on a com
puter? First you have to learn the
complex notation of Smith's
program. The more you under
stand about the 90 or so
parameters that go into produc
ing each sound the more control
you have, although you need
normally to worry only about a
few of the most important ones.
Next you can choose from an
ever expanding library of "in

struments' or computer analogs
of "patches" on a synthesizer, or
you can write your own in the
SAIL, or FORTRAN program
ming languages.
You can write a tune of a few
notes, which only take a few sec
onds of computer time to pro
duce, to hear what you are doing
before you undertake to write a
full length composition. A com
position is entered in from a
typewriter keyboard rather than
in musical notation, said Smith.
The advantage of writing
music for a computer is for
someone like Jonathan Berger, a
doctoral student and composer
on the project, that you have
control both over your instru
ment itself and the composition
where you define your own style
through an algorithm.
The computer with its preci
sion has opened up new areas in
music performance.
Harmonics
Some compositions like
Chowning's employ unusual
ratios of harmonics that are not
found in music. Chowning's
piece "Stria" for example, uses
harmonics in ratios of the gol
den mean. Other composers mix
recorded and generated sound,
or present gradual transitions
from one instrument to another
as from a drum to a trumpet.
Chowning has performed his
computer generated music from
a tape all over the U.S. and
Europe. For example, when
avant-garde composer Gyorgy
I igcti heard Chowning's compu
ter music during a visit to Stan
ford in 1972, he was so impre
ssed with them that he invited
Chowning to the Berlin Festival
of New Music that summer.
Since then Chowning has been
commissioned by Pierre Boulez'
to write and perform "Stria" in
Paris in 1977.
Research and composition
blend together. Christopher
Sheeline, a Ph.D student in
Hearing and Speech sciences, is
studying auditory space percep
tion, how we perceive angle dis
tance and velocity of sounds.
"We can learn how a particu
lar class of sounds behaves, re
verberates in an environment,"
said Sheeline, "People hear dif
ferent things depending on
where they are."
Taj Mahal
Sheeline can model the acous
tics of different places and re
create that environment. "You
can model in a rough sort of way
the Taj Mahal or Dinkelspeil and
within that model you can make
your music."
11l is type of research can ena
ble you to present the listener
with sounds that travel around
the room, in "musical gestures"
as Sheeline describes them. This
is a direct application of research
in composition, and the more you

talk to the people involved in
CCRMA the more you realize
that here the two have a symbio
tic relationship.
One of the graduate students
in the project remarked in good
humor that Chowning runs "an
organized anarchy." Decisions
about the project are made by
everyone involved. As Smith
remarked, "since Chowning
bore the the dealings
with the outside world, he was
designated as director." The
other four senior researchers in
cluding Smith are codirectors.
All research is tied to specific
needs of compositions and com
posers.
Graphics
Smith's research into compu
ter graphics has led him to de
velop a music typesetting prog
ram that can eliminate much of
Hje painstaking detail and ex
pense that goes into publishing
music.
It would take a budget of
about $1 (),()()() and many days
just to copy out the orchestral
part of a work like Debussy's
"La Mer." Smith can do it in a
matter of minutes.
Smith has typeset his own
textbook on music theory with
his system. His "San Andreas"
company claims "no-fault pub
lishing."
Apprentk.es
Smith explains with a smile
that he worked out that a 19th
century apprentice to a music
publisher started to learn how to
lay out and engrave a plate at the
age of 14. "When he reached 25
he could do one himself." said

Smith who claims that you can
learn his system in a few weeks.
"What we are doing is not
going to take over the music
world," said John Strawn a Ph.D.
candidate with the project. But
that is missing the point. "We are
not trying to create the ultimate
instrument hut a creative tool."
Nobody at the center claims
that they have created a revolu
tion (Chowning does not believe
in them), but computer music
projects have grown up in other
universities around the country,
and the center's summer semi
nars attract musicians from all
over the world.
There is a great deal of interest
in computer music in Europe,
especially in France where Pierre
Boulez runs the multi million
dollar Institut de Recherche et
Coordination Acoustique/
Musique known as IRCAM,
which supports a system similar
to Stanford's with a good deal of
exchange between the two.
Computer music is not tied to
any style, but those that are ex
cited by it are mostly avant
garde composers. The public
may not be flocking to their con
certs, but then, explains Chown
ing, they never have. In art
museums, "people always fre
quent the art of the past more
than the present," and modern
art is not dependent on memory
as music is. "You can take your
time to comprehend an image."
In music what you need is educa
tion. "Otherwise you would not
see such a difference between
New York and Memphis in terms
of music appreciation."
