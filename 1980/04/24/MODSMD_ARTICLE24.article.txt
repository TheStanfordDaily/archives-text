# Merigan: Striving to a cure for cancer
## 
### Brad Crystal 
Thomas Merigan had a year
left to go at UC-San Francisco
medical school when a rare pro
tein molecule, called interferon,
was discovered in 1957. Today.
23 years later, interferon is being
touted as one of the most promis
ing anti-cancer and anti-viral
agents on the horizon, and Meri
gan, now George E. Lucy
Becker Profesor of Medicine
here, is considered one of the
country's top interferon resear
chers.
What makes interferon re
markable is not so much its appa
rent efficacy in malignant tumor
shrinkage (it hasn't yet produced
an effect that standard
chemotherapy hasn't ac
complished), but rather that it is
a natural body substance and,
therefore, produces few. if any,
of the side effects witnessed in
more toxic forms of therapy.
Merigan's successes with in
terferon have raised eyebrows in
medical research circles around
the world. In 1972. for example.
Merigan and a group of British
researchers found that
teers given a nasal spray of in
terferon one day before and
three days after exposure to a
common-cold virus did not de
velop cold symptoms, while 13 of
another group of 16 unsprayed
volunteers did.
After testing interferon's ef
fect on other viruses such as
chicken pox, shingles and
hepatitis B infections, Merigan
turned his attention to lym
phoma. a cancer of the lymphatic
system. A December 1978 re
port compiled by Merigan for the
New England Journal of
Medicine bears out his encourag
ing data: three lymphoma pa
tients not previously treated with
traditional chemotherapy ex
perienced significant regressions
after receiving interferon. All
three are alive today.
Long road ahead
Despite the promising results
so far, Merigan, who came to
Stanford in 1963, maintains a
cautiously optimistic outlook.
"Interferon will, I think, prove
to have some unique applica
tions because it is so broadly ac
tive," he explains. "But there's a
long way to go from the first
trials showing efficacy, where we
are now, to introducing the sub
stance into clinical application
on a widespread basis."
Perhaps the most prohibitive
characteristic of interferon is its
exorbitant cost. Almost all the
world's current supply of interfe
ron is derived from a manufac
turing plant in Helsinki, Finland,
where virologist Karl Cantell ex
tracts the protein from white

blood cells using blood donated
by the Finnish Red Cross. The
extraction process is time con
suming and expensive — as little
as a millionth of an ounce of pure
interferon costs close to $1500.
Interferon's scarcity has been its
greatest limitation.
But that may change.
Production innovation
In January scientists at the Swiss
gene-transplanting firm. Biogen.
announced a breakthrough. Using
recombinant DNA they induced a
common strain of bacteria to make
human interferon. Last month a
team of Massachusetts Institute of
Technology researchers reportedly
developed a new mass-production
technique that could cut the cost of
interferon 20-fold.
Even gene-splicing methods
of interferon production are not
without snags, however. For
example, the bacterium being
used by Biogen produced many
proteins in addition to interfe
ron, one of which is harmful to
human beings.
Interferon's role in destroying
viral infections appears to be that
of an intercellular messenger.
When a virus infects one cell, in
terferon is manufactured by the
nucleus and sent to neighboring
cells to warn of the impending
attack. The healthy cells respond
to the interferon message by
producing anti-viral proteins of
their own. thus resisting the
onslaught of invading viruses.
Cancer combatant?
As an anti-cancer weapon, in
terferon's viability is less certain,
although scientists have estab
lished a definite link between
specific cancers and specific virus

What makes interferon remarkable is
not so much its apparent efficacy in
malignant tumor shrinkage, but rather
that it is a natural body substance and y
therefore, produces few, if any side ef
fects ...

infections. In bolstering the
body's immune system against
viruses, interferon may enable
healthy cells to ward off malig
nancy, as well.
Yet, once interferon becomes
•widely available, the mysteries
surrounding its usefulness and
application may be cleared up.
Merigan says, "We have to not
only do the confirming work to
find out what diseases we can
apply interferon to, but more
importantly we have to get
enough of the source to put on

Medicine

the market. And that will only
come with new methods of pro
duction. I hope recombinant
DNA is such a method, and I'm
very excited about the results."
Big bucks
For the time being, funding for
interferon research is large, un
derwritten by multi-million dol

lar grants from the National
Cancer Institute and the Ameri
can Cancer Society. Merigan
co-directs the cancer society's
study underway at 10 medical
centers nationwide including
Stanford. Merigan's research
here has involved more than 200
patients in the past seven years.
To evaluate interferon's anti
viral strength, the protein is ad
ministered on a double-blind
basis in which patients receive
either interferon or a placebo.
To ensure objectivity, neither

the patients nor the doctors
know who got what until after
the study is over.
Merigan lists three objectives
of current interferon research:
determining minimum effective
dose; determining the length of
time interferon should be ad
ministered; determining
whether interferon produces a
more significant response than
standard chemotherapy.
"One of the goals of the
American Cancer Society
cooperative trials is to determine
whether one. three or nine mill
ion units a day are required to get
tumor shrinkage," Merigan re
lates. "We started with 10 mill
ion units a day, and it would be
nice to know what the lowest ef
fective dosage is."
The American Cancer Socie
ty's decision to fund a $2 million
study of interferon in 1978 has
resulted in a spate of phone calls
and solicitations to Merigan
from cancer patients infused
with optimism after reading re
cent newspaper and magazine
headlines. But until interferon is
certified by the Food and Drug
Administration and produced
more readily, cancer patients
must meet a rigid set of medical
criteria known as "protocols" to
receive interferon. For the most
part, interferon is administered
only to cancer victims who have
not responded to conventional

therapy.
"All of our work has been with
specific protocols — we can't
take unsolicited patients," says
Merigan.
Those who do receive treat
ment are, in a sense, human
guinea pigs. With no other re
course hut death, it is under
standable that many patients
would be eager to undergo a
treatment that has shown
documented beneficial, if only
transient, results.
Early stages
"I think we are at a very em
bryonic stage in our under
standing of the material," Meri
gan surmises. "We have to have
enough material to work to re
produce our results at more than
one center."
In assessing interferon, Meri
gan refrains from unconditional
jubilance. "Interferon is not a
panacea, but it does seem to have
activity. There are relatively few
natural products that have ap
plication as anti-viral applica
tions.
"You can't be dogmatic about
interferon's application at the
present. We don't want to mis
lead the patients ourselves about
something that has yet to be
proven. On the other hand, ev
erything is looking good that it's
an active material, and there's a
lot of enthusiasm."
