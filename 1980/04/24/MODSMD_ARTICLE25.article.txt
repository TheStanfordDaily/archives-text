# Dornbusch: Discerning dating patterns

### Karen Springen 
What do veterans of Herant
Katchadourian'sHuman Sexual
ity class and Sociology Professor
Sanford Dornbusch have in
common? They have both
studied more sex than they had
dreamed possible.
"I have learned more about
sexual development than I'd
ever thought I'd want to know,"
said Dornbusch. who is particu
larly interested in the surprising
discovery that sexual develop
ment is not related to dating. In
fact, Dornbusch has reached the
important conclusion that peers,
rather than physical maturation,
influence us in much of our social
development — from moral
choices to dating habits.
Dornbusch has concentrated
his recent research in three

areas. These include the relation
of sexual development to dating,
the moral values and choices of
students in Catholic schools in
comparison to students here and
the manner by which govern
ment education programs are
evaluated.
According to Dornbusch,
people's dating habits reflect
those of their peers. Friends re
ject those whose dating patterns
do not conform to the norm for
their age group. "Dating is a
product of age, not sexual de
velopment," he claimed.
Dornbusch based his dating
research on data from a National
Health Service study of adoles
cents between 12 and 17, which
measured sexual development
through physical examination.
The study showed that sexual
development explained less than

one percent of dating.
Dating "is not in the hor
mones, but in the age groups the
kids belong to," said Dornbusch.
"Dating is a social custom" and
"a product of pressure from pa
rents and peers." Although
"children are forced to go along
with the group," however,"soci
ety takes the average age of sex
ual development into account."

Sociology

Dornbusch emphasized that
"control of dating is an indirect
control of social development."
Thus, peers are influential in
forming the behavior of a child.
Three types of youth experi
ence dating problems, he said.
These children are runaways,
those with police records and
those who control their own
nighttime hours. In addition,
foreign-born and single-parent
families have difficulty with the
dating process.
"People who don't participate
in the culture are less able to con
trol their kids." Dornbush said.
Therefore, "dating is an alien
culture pattern" to the
foreign-born.
In single-parent families, the
child is more likely to exert con
trol over his own affairs than in
the traditional family. Parents
who work full-time, he said, also
have less control over their chil
dren.
Dornbusch cited several re
sults of the dating survey, which
he found surprising. For exam
ple, "Among lower class boys
who are late in sexual matura
tion, 15 percent wet their beds at
age 14."

In another major field of re
search, the study of values,
Dornbusch found no correlation
between a person's morality and
his number of years of exposure
to Catholic instruction. When
adolescents were faced with
moral choices, friends had the
most impact on decisions. Paren
tal influence was secondary, and
the church had virtually no im-

pact.
Dornbusch has been studying
students here for ten years for
the moral choices project. The
sexual development research,
however, was not based on Stan
ford students.
In his study of the methods the
government uses in evaluating
education programs, such as
public schools and community
bilingual and special education
projects, Dornbusch found that
"the federal government sets re
quirements which are absolutely
unrealistic." He said that
"there's chaos out there."
Prevarication
Dornbusch added that "a lot
of the material is lies." He attri
buted this trend to schools that
"fake it" because "they don't
have the resources to get the
right answers." The programs
have "too much unrelated data."
and so "paper flow becomes an
end in itself."
Thus, the nature of valuations
sometimes interferes with doing
a good job. Dornbusch said he is
trying to "understand why these
perfectly well-intentioned
people (in school programs) arc
messing up so badly."
Dornbusch, who did his un
dergraduate work at Syracuse

and his graduate work at the
University of Chicago, praised
the working environment here.
Although he has been at the
University for 20 years, he had
previously never lived in the
same house more than two years.
He also taught at Washington
University in St. Louis and at
Harvard. "I didn't like Harvard
at all," he said. "Harvard has lots
of bright individuals, but 1 had no
sense of collegiate cooperation.
Here the atmosphere was much
more cooperative.

Dornbusch emphasized that
he "likes working with people."
efforts result in a product
better than that which an indi
vidual could produce alone, he
said.
Much of Dornbusch's col
laborative work, such as the sex
ual development study, is per
formed at the Boys Town Center
for the Study of Youth De
velopment at Stanford. A similar
research center in Nebraska do
nated some of its funding to the
Stanford center and provided
seed money for small projects
like Dornbusch's.
Dornbusch is currently work
ing with other faculty members
and a few graduate students in a
seminar on social development
at Boys Town. The group is try
ing to determine what needs to
be researched in this field.
Dornbusch emphasized that the
Boys Town seminar is separate
from his research on sexual de
velopment.
Ideas defeat ego
Speaking of the cooperative
attitude within the group, he said
"you get to know each other so
well that you don't show off."
Cooperative efforts bring to
gether faculty with diverse
backgrounds. He said the group
is able to engage in a "battle of
ideas without much self
consciousness."

Dornhusch expressed reserva
tions about some media cover
age of research. He said that
Huntley-Brinkley had wanted
him to describe the results of a
former project on San Francisco
school children in 40 seconds.
"I'd rather not have it at all." he
said. "When they're very short. I
often find interviews do more
harm than good." He called this
an "oversimplification of life."
Former projects of
Dornbusch's have included a
study of the way in which
Catholic priests are evaluated,
the way in which Stanford faculty
are evaluated and the way in
which female university instruc
tors are evaluated.
Service to the community,
teaching and research form the
basis for faculty evaluation. He
said, however, that "service was
of no importance to what hap
pened to the faculty."
Partially as a result of this find
ing, he said, teaching has moved
up to assume moderate impor
tance here. "The faculty wanted
teaching to be given more
weight, and we are moving in
that direction."

Although Dornbusch agrees
that "teaching should have more
weight" here, he said research
should remain the top priority at
Stanford. "Service comes by the
way," he added.
Dornbusch said that he per
sonally probably spends more
time on teaching than on re
search. But he spends "more
time worrying about research."
With regard to the condition
ot female instructors, he said
prestige universities and, teach
ing colleges show no difference
between the sexes. At research
universities, though, "women
are given more teaching duties,"
he said. This is a subtle form of
discrimination because "the
greatest rewards are from re
search," he added.
Although Stanford was not in
cluded in his study, Dornbusch
said he would classify it as a
research-oriented university, in
that women spend more time
teaching than doing research.
Dornbusch enjoys using stu
dents in his studies. Their par
ticipation in research, he said,
"shows that stuff we studied in
the abstract applied directly to
them."

Katchadourian'sHuman Sexual
ity class and Sociology Professor
Sanford Dornbusch have in
common? They have both
studied more sex than they had
dreamed possible.
"I have learned more about
sexual development than I'd
ever thought I'd want to know,"
said Dornbusch. who is particu
larly interested in the surprising
discovery that sexual develop
ment is not related to dating. In
fact, Dornbusch has reached the
important conclusion that peers,
rather than physical maturation,
influence us in much of our social
development — from moral
choices to dating habits.
Dornbusch has concentrated
his recent research in three

areas. These include the relation
of sexual development to dating,
the moral values and choices of
students in Catholic schools in
comparison to students here and
the manner by which govern
ment education programs are
evaluated.
According to Dornbusch,
people's dating habits reflect
those of their peers. Friends re
ject those whose dating patterns
do not conform to the norm for
their age group. "Dating is a
product of age, not sexual de
velopment," he claimed.
Dornbusch based his dating
research on data from a National
Health Service study of adoles
cents between 12 and 17, which
measured sexual development
through physical examination.
The study showed that sexual
development explained less than

one percent of dating.
Dating "is not in the hor
mones, but in the age groups the
kids belong to," said Dornbusch.
"Dating is a social custom" and
"a product of pressure from pa
rents and peers." Although
"children are forced to go along
with the group," however,"soci
ety takes the average age of sex
ual development into account."

Sociology

Dornbusch emphasized that
"control of dating is an indirect
control of social development."
Thus, peers are influential in
forming the behavior of a child.
Three types of youth experi
ence dating problems, he said.
These children are runaways,
those with police records and
those who control their own
nighttime hours. In addition,
foreign-born and single-parent
families have difficulty with the
dating process.
"People who don't participate
in the culture are less able to con
trol their kids." Dornbush said.
Therefore, "dating is an alien
culture pattern" to the
foreign-born.
In single-parent families, the
child is more likely to exert con
trol over his own affairs than in
the traditional family. Parents
who work full-time, he said, also
have less control over their chil
dren.
Dornbusch cited several re
sults of the dating survey, which
he found surprising. For exam
ple, "Among lower class boys
who are late in sexual matura
tion, 15 percent wet their beds at
age 14."

In another major field of re
search, the study of values,
Dornbusch found no correlation
between a person's morality and
his number of years of exposure
to Catholic instruction. When
adolescents were faced with
moral choices, friends had the
most impact on decisions. Paren
tal influence was secondary, and
the church had virtually no im-

pact.
Dornbusch has been studying
students here for ten years for
the moral choices project. The
sexual development research,
however, was not based on Stan
ford students.
In his study of the methods the
government uses in evaluating
education programs, such as
public schools and community
bilingual and special education
projects, Dornbusch found that
"the federal government sets re
quirements which are absolutely
unrealistic." He said that
"there's chaos out there."
Prevarication
Dornbusch added that "a lot
of the material is lies." He attri
buted this trend to schools that
"fake it" because "they don't
have the resources to get the
right answers." The programs
have "too much unrelated data."
and so "paper flow becomes an
end in itself."
Thus, the nature of valuations
sometimes interferes with doing
a good job. Dornbusch said he is
trying to "understand why these
perfectly well-intentioned
people (in school programs) arc
messing up so badly."
Dornbusch, who did his un
dergraduate work at Syracuse

and his graduate work at the
University of Chicago, praised
the working environment here.
Although he has been at the
University for 20 years, he had
previously never lived in the
same house more than two years.
He also taught at Washington
University in St. Louis and at
Harvard. "I didn't like Harvard
at all," he said. "Harvard has lots
of bright individuals, but 1 had no
sense of collegiate cooperation.
Here the atmosphere was much

for the Study of Youth De

research center in Nebraska do
nated some of its funding to the
Stanford center and provided
seed money for small projects
like Dornbusch's.
Dornbusch is currently work
ing with other faculty members
and a few graduate students in a
seminar on social development
at Boys Town. The group is try
ing to determine what needs to
be researched in this field.
Dornbusch emphasized that the
Boys Town seminar is separate
from his research on sexual de
velopment.
Ideas defeat ego
Speaking of the cooperative
attitude within the group, he said
"you get to know each other so
well that you don't show off."
Cooperative efforts bring to
gether faculty with diverse
backgrounds. He said the group
is able to engage in a "battle of
ideas without much self
consciousness."

Dornhusch expressed reserva
tions about some media cover
age of research. He said that
Huntley-Brinkley had wanted
him to describe the results of a
former project on San Francisco
school children in 40 seconds.
"I'd rather not have it at all." he
said. "When they're very short. I
often find interviews do more
harm than good." He called this
an "oversimplification of life."
Former projects of
Dornbusch's have included a
study of the way in which
Catholic priests are evaluated,
the way in which Stanford faculty
are evaluated and the way in
which female university instruc
tors are evaluated.
Service to the community,
teaching and research form the
basis for faculty evaluation. He
said, however, that "service was
of no importance to what hap
pened to the faculty."
Partially as a result of this find
ing, he said, teaching has moved
up to assume moderate impor
tance here. "The faculty wanted
teaching to be given more
weight, and we are moving in
that direction."

Although Dornbusch agrees
that "teaching should have more
weight" here, he said research
should remain the top priority at
Stanford. "Service comes by the
way," he added.
Dornbusch said that he per
sonally probably spends more
time on teaching than on re
search. But he spends "more
time worrying about research."
With regard to the condition
ot female instructors, he said
prestige universities and, teach
ing colleges show no difference
between the sexes. At research
universities, though, "women
are given more teaching duties,"
he said. This is a subtle form of
discrimination because "the
greatest rewards are from re
search," he added.

sonally probably spends more
time on teaching than on re
search. But he spends "more
time worrying about research."
With regard to the condition
ot female instructors, he said
prestige universities and, teach
ing colleges show no difference
between the sexes. At research
universities, though, "women
are given more teaching duties,"
he said. This is a subtle form of
discrimination because "the
greatest rewards are from re
search," he added.
Although Stanford was not in

said he would classify it as a
research-oriented university, in
that women spend more time
teaching than doing research.

them."
What do veterans of Herant
Katchadourian'sHuman Sexual
ity class and Sociology Professor
Sanford Dornbusch have in
common? They have both
studied more sex than they had
dreamed possible.
"I have learned more about
sexual development than I'd
ever thought I'd want to know,"
said Dornbusch. who is particu
larly interested in the surprising
discovery that sexual develop
ment is not related to dating. In
fact, Dornbusch has reached the
important conclusion that peers,
rather than physical maturation,
influence us in much of our social
development — from moral
choices to dating habits.
Dornbusch has concentrated
his recent research in three

areas. These include the relation
of sexual development to dating,
the moral values and choices of
students in Catholic schools in
comparison to students here and
the manner by which govern
ment education programs are
evaluated.
According to Dornbusch,
people's dating habits reflect
those of their peers. Friends re
ject those whose dating patterns
do not conform to the norm for
their age group. "Dating is a
product of age, not sexual de
velopment," he claimed.
Dornbusch based his dating
research on data from a National
Health Service study of adoles
cents between 12 and 17, which
measured sexual development
through physical examination.
The study showed that sexual
development explained less than

one percent of dating.
Dating "is not in the hor
mones, but in the age groups the
kids belong to," said Dornbusch.
"Dating is a social custom" and
"a product of pressure from pa
rents and peers." Although
"children are forced to go along
with the group," however,"soci
ety takes the average age of sex
ual development into account."

Sociology

Dornbusch emphasized that
"control of dating is an indirect
control of social development."
Thus, peers are influential in
forming the behavior of a child.
Three types of youth experi
ence dating problems, he said.
These children are runaways,
those with police records and
those who control their own
nighttime hours. In addition,
foreign-born and single-parent
families have difficulty with the
dating process.
"People who don't participate
in the culture are less able to con
trol their kids." Dornbush said.
Therefore, "dating is an alien
culture pattern" to the
foreign-born.
In single-parent families, the
child is more likely to exert con
trol over his own affairs than in
the traditional family. Parents
who work full-time, he said, also
have less control over their chil
dren.
Dornbusch cited several re
sults of the dating survey, which
he found surprising. For exam
ple, "Among lower class boys
who are late in sexual matura
tion, 15 percent wet their beds at
age 14."

In another major field of re
search, the study of values,
Dornbusch found no correlation
between a person's morality and
his number of years of exposure
to Catholic instruction. When
adolescents were faced with
moral choices, friends had the
most impact on decisions. Paren
tal influence was secondary, and
the church had virtually no im-

pact.
Dornbusch has been studying
students here for ten years for
the moral choices project. The
sexual development research,
however, was not based on Stan
ford students.
In his study of the methods the
government uses in evaluating
education programs, such as
public schools and community
bilingual and special education
projects, Dornbusch found that
"the federal government sets re
quirements which are absolutely
unrealistic." He said that
"there's chaos out there."
Prevarication
Dornbusch added that "a lot
of the material is lies." He attri
buted this trend to schools that
"fake it" because "they don't
have the resources to get the
right answers." The programs
have "too much unrelated data."
and so "paper flow becomes an
end in itself."
Thus, the nature of valuations
sometimes interferes with doing
a good job. Dornbusch said he is
trying to "understand why these
perfectly well-intentioned
people (in school programs) arc
messing up so badly."
Dornbusch, who did his un
dergraduate work at Syracuse

and his graduate work at the
University of Chicago, praised
the working environment here.
Although he has been at the
University for 20 years, he had
previously never lived in the
same house more than two years.
He also taught at Washington
University in St. Louis and at
Harvard. "I didn't like Harvard
at all," he said. "Harvard has lots
of bright individuals, but 1 had no
sense of collegiate cooperation.
Here the atmosphere was much
more cooperative.
People lover
Dornbusch emphasized that
he "likes working with people."
efforts result in a product
better than that which an indi
vidual could produce alone, he
said.
Much of Dornbusch's col
laborative work, such as the sex
ual development study, is per
formed at the Boys Town Center
for the Study of Youth De
velopment at Stanford. A similar
research center in Nebraska do
nated some of its funding to the
Stanford center and provided
seed money for small projects
like Dornbusch's.
Dornbusch is currently work
ing with other faculty members
and a few graduate students in a
seminar on social development
at Boys Town. The group is try
ing to determine what needs to
be researched in this field.
Dornbusch emphasized that the
Boys Town seminar is separate
from his research on sexual de
velopment.
Ideas defeat ego
Speaking of the cooperative
attitude within the group, he said
"you get to know each other so
well that you don't show off."
Cooperative efforts bring to
gether faculty with diverse
backgrounds. He said the group
is able to engage in a "battle of
ideas without much self
consciousness."

Dornhusch expressed reserva
tions about some media cover
age of research. He said that
Huntley-Brinkley had wanted
him to describe the results of a
former project on San Francisco
school children in 40 seconds.
"I'd rather not have it at all." he
said. "When they're very short. I
often find interviews do more
harm than good." He called this
an "oversimplification of life."
Former projects of
Dornbusch's have included a
study of the way in which
Catholic priests are evaluated,
the way in which Stanford faculty
are evaluated and the way in
which female university instruc
tors are evaluated.
Service to the community,
teaching and research form the
basis for faculty evaluation. He
said, however, that "service was
of no importance to what hap
pened to the faculty."
Partially as a result of this find
ing, he said, teaching has moved
up to assume moderate impor
tance here. "The faculty wanted
teaching to be given more
weight, and we are moving in
that direction."

Although Dornbusch agrees
that "teaching should have more
weight" here, he said research
should remain the top priority at
Stanford. "Service comes by the
way," he added.
Dornbusch said that he per
sonally probably spends more
time on teaching than on re
search. But he spends "more
time worrying about research."
With regard to the condition
ot female instructors, he said
prestige universities and, teach
ing colleges show no difference
between the sexes. At research
universities, though, "women
are given more teaching duties,"
he said. This is a subtle form of
discrimination because "the
greatest rewards are from re
search," he added.
Although Stanford was not in
cluded in his study, Dornbusch
said he would classify it as a
research-oriented university, in
that women spend more time
teaching than doing research.
Dornbusch enjoys using stu
dents in his studies. Their par
ticipation in research, he said,
"shows that stuff we studied in
the abstract applied directly to
them."
