# Financing: The bureaucratic process

Doing research costs money.
Everything from laboratory os
cilliscopes to professors' salaries
must he paid for. But very little
of the normal University funds
— those raised by tuition, the
endowment,' and donations —
are available to meet these ends.
Stanford's research budget must
come from outside the Univer
sity, primarily from the federal
government. Last year Uncle
Sam obliged with over $90 mill
ion in research grants to profes
sors here.
The money, however, does not
go into some general fund. Each
professor who dtsires financial
assistance for his project applies
individually to Washington for
help, although a percentage of
what he receives goes to the Uni
versity to pay for the indirect
costs (upkeep on buildings, for
instance) associated with doing
research here.
According to Gerald Lieber
man, vice-provost and dean of
research here, Stanford consis
tantly ranks among the top three
federal research grant recipients.
The University of Washington
and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology are other major
money getters.
The University received $100
million for research in the last
fiscal year, ending August 31,
1979, of which $94.4 million
came from the federal govern
ment. Another $5 million came
from assorted non-federal
sources, Lieberman said.
All that money isn't provided
by any one governmental source,
but rather by many departments
within the federal structure.
For fiscal year 1979, the old
department of Health, Educa
tion and Welfare (HEW), acting
mostly through the National In
stitute of Health, chipped in $45

million for Stanford's research
efforts, the National Science
Foundation $ 15.3 million, the
National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) $6.2
million, the Navy $4.4 million,
the Air Force $3.1 million, the
Army $1.4 million, the Energy

Agency $5.7 million, the Ad
vanced Research Project
Agency $2.7 million and others
$7.7 million.
About 40 percent of the re
search money goes to the medi
cal school, one-third goes to the
School of Engineering and 30
percent goes to humanities and
sciences, Lieberman said. In ad
dition, the Stanford Linear Ac
celerator Center received $47
million in federal support.

Over the last four or five years
federal research monies have in
creased at a rate of one or two
percent per year, when adjusted
for inflation, Lieberman said.
Independent requests
Research projects receive fed
eral money after professors have

made research proposals to the
individual funding agencies,
Kenneth Creighton, University
controller explained. Getting re
search money is a "bottoms-up
operation," agreed Lieberman.
The professors work through the
Sponsored Projects Office here,
which acts as a liaison between
the University and the federal
government. Basically, if the
agency likes the research prop
osal, the project is funded,
Creighton said.

But not all of this money
makes it into the hands of the
researcher. "The government
takes the position that it will pay
its fair share of indirect costs of
doing research on campus,"
Lieberman said.
Indirect costs include utilities,
libraries, research assistants, and
administrative expenses. Up to
50 percent of the salaries of ad
ministrators, like President
Richard Lyman, can be included
as part of these indirect costs.
Direct costs entail the primary
investigator's payment and
equipment expense.
"Indirects represent a sub
stantial chunk of the operating
budget," Lieberman said. "Of
the $94.4 million in federal
money received for research in
1979. about $29 million went to
pay the government's share of
the indirects."
Half Tare
The University general
operating fund (not including re
search) for one year is about
$120 million, Lieberman said.
Thus, the additional $100 mill

ion received for research repre
sents about one-half of all money
used to fund the University in
any given year.
"If the government didn't pay
its share of indirect costs, the
general fund would have to pay
it,"he said. Indirect research
money is " not profit — we prob
ably wouldn't have as large a lib
rary, for example, without in
drects," added Lieberman.
Furthermore, the University is
accountable for "every penny"
of research money it receives.
"The University is accountable
intellectually and financially,"
Lieberman said.
Check-up
"Intellectually we are respon
sible because all research con
tracts and grants come from
proposals," he said. "When the
government gives money they
say 'Fine, we like your research.
Go ahead and do it." Lieberman
added.
The high renewal rate for re
search grants indicates that Stan
ford does well in the intellectual
accounting process, Lieberman
said.
"Financially the University is
held very accountable," for re
search money. "We get audited
both for direct and indirect
costs." Lieberman affirmed.
All research money flows
through the Controller's Office,
said Creighton. The office makes
sure that research money is being
used in conformance with the
terms of the research contract gi
ven. This review does not include
the specific scope of research
being done, only the general ag
reements.
Last year, a newer, more
stringent set of accounting rules;
known as A-21, were im
plemented by the government.
Lieberman said. "We don't like
the A-21 for all sorts of
reasons," he said.
"The new rules will require
more accountability," he elabo
rated. "We will have to account
for our research time in smaller
and smaller pigeon holes."
Under the new rules, profes
sors must account for time when
teaching or when doing research
and make some distinction bet
ween the two, Lieberman said.
Yet the distinction is not al

ways easy to make. "When I am
teaching my graduate students,
am 1 teaching or doing re
search," said Lieberman, also a
professor of operations research
and statistics.
Prohibitive time costs
Lieberman said he is worried
that, in the near future, the ac
countability requirements of the
the government could impair re
search efforts because faculty
members would need to spend
too much productive time ac
countingfor what they are doing.
Nevertheless, Stanford is
heavily dependent on federal re
search money to maintain its pos

ition as a first-class university.
Because research money filters
throughout much of the Univer
sity, boosting the budgets of the
libraries, computer facilities, and
administrative staff, the quality
of the educational product that
Stanford can provide is linked to
the share of federal funding re
ceived.
"If government funding
ceased, Stanford might survive,
but it wouldn't survive as we
know it today," Lieberman said.
Yes, "Stanford could survive,
but it would not survive as the
institution of excellence that it
has grown to be."
