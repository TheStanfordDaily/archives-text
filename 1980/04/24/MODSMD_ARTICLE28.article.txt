Kennedy takes narrow PA vote
PHILADELPHIA — Sen. Edward Kennedy out
lasted President Jimmy Carter yesterday to win the
Pennsylvania presidential primary liy the frailest of mar
gins, and said he'll have to do better than that to catch up
in the race for the Democratic nomination.
A final installment of votes from Philadelphia, Ken
nedy's stronghold, was tallied late in the day. That wide
ned Kennedy's margin to nearly 1 (),()()() votes, with 99
percent of the precincts counted.
Former U.N. ambassador George Bush upset Ronald
Reagan in the Republican primary. He gained 53 per
cent of the vote to Reagan's 46 percent. The GOP popu
lar vote did not bind delegates, who were elected sepa
rately and were officially uncommitted.
The final News Election Service tabulation, with 99
percent of the precincts counted, the numbers read this
way.
Kennedy 731,958 or 46 percent, for 93 delegates.
Carter 722,177 or 46 percent, for 92 delegates.
Six percent of the vote was uncommitted, 2 percent
went to California Gov. Edmund Brown Jr., who had
already quit the race.
Carter came out of Pennsylvania with a total of 1038
delegates; Kennedy had 569; 29 were uncommitted.
As the Carter campaign sees it, in an analysis that
serves its own political purposes. Carter has now shown
for the first time that he is not always destined to collapse
in the final stretch — which is the core of the Kennedy's
prayerful blueprint.
The Pennsylvania voting, Kennedy said, indicated
that half of his message — the contention that President
Carter and his policies are responsible for current
economic problems — has gotten through to voters. But
he seemed to agree that the electorate has not yet ac
cepted the other essential plank of the Kennedy candi
dacy — that Kennedy and his policies would be better.
Kennedy indicated that perhaps the most annoying
aspect of this campaign — more annoying, even, than the
recurring "character" issue — is the suggestion, raised
by Carter and reflected widely in opion surveys, that no
president could do much to handle inflation and other
economic ills.
Athletes contest USOC boycott
The U.S. Olympic Committee illegally caved in to
political pressure when it voted to boycott this summer's
Moscow Games and the decision should be reversed, 19
Olympic hopefuls told a federal court yesterday.
The athletes contended in a lawsuit that the interna
tional Olympic Charter requires national Olympic
committees to "resist all pressures of any kind . ..
whether of a political, religious or economic nature."
The USOC violated the charter when it went along
with President Carter's boycott demand, according to
the suit filed in U.S. District Court.
Since then, the governments of Canada, Japan, Au
stralia, Britain and West Germany have recommended
that their Olympic committees follow the LJ.S. boycott.
In Lausanne, Switzerland, the International Olympic
Committee Executive Board decided yesterday that any
team coming to the Moscow Games this summer will be
allowed to choose whether to appear under its national
(lag, its own Olympic flag or the world Olympic banner.
The executive board's decision does not ban all na
tional flags and anthems, as some lOS officials and the
president of the International Sports Federations
wanted.

But the order does constitute a step in the direction of
denationalization of the games, and lOC officials said
they hoped that would encourage some Western Euro
pean Olympics committees to decide against staying
from the Moscow Games.
Anderson to run as independent
WASHINGTON — Rep. John Anderson, who failed
to win a single primary as a Republican, has scheduled a
news conference today to announce that he will run for
president as an independent.
The move has been expected for more than a week. It
will leave only two remaining contenders for the GOP
nomination, front-runner Ronald Reagan and George
Bush, who won an upset victory in Tuesday's Pennsyl
vania primary.
Historically, independent and third-party candidates
haven't fared well in American elections, and most polit
ical experts regard Anderson as more of a potential
spoiler than a realistic winner in the general election.
Oil companies report high gains
WASHINGTON — Exxon Corp. announced yester
day it had first-quarter earnings of $1.925 billion, more
than twice what it earned in the same quarter last year
and by far the highest quarterly profit any corporation
ever has reported. Exxon is the nation's largest industrial
corporation as ranked by 1979 sales.
Three other large oil companies. Shell Oil Co., Stan
dard Oil Co., and Occidental Petroleum Co., also re
ported very large increases in their first quarter profits.
These are gains and losses not on actual transactions
but on changes in the dollar value of money owed by the
company that must be paid in a foreign currency. Be
cause of the recent decline in the dollar's value, Exxon's
chairman C.C. Garvin, Jr. said Exxon has "lost" about
$130 million so far this month on this"paper basis."
'"Extreme care should be used when attempting to
form judgements on the basis of the earnings estimates
just announced," Garvin cautioned. "The results of any
short time period are not necessarily indicative of earn
ings over a full year. This may be particularly true of the
1980 first-ljuarter results in view of the current volatility
in world petroleum and foreign exchange markets."
Cubans take offered exit to US
HAVANA, Cuba — The Cuban government has for
mally opened the door for a mass exodus to the United
States of all Cubans who want to leave here, a number
that officials have suggested could reach hundreds of
thousands.
The sudden Cuban offer, contained in a cryptic an
nouncement printed in Tuesday's edition of the official
newspaper Granma, is expected to affect far more than
the 10,000 persons who originally took refuge in the
Peruvian Embassy here two weeks ago.
Yesterday's announcement prompted the State De
partment to call yesterday for immediate suspension of
the sealift on the grounds that it is illegal. In making the
announcement, department spokesman Tom Reston
warned that participants were "playing into the hands of
Cuban authorities."
Specifically, the officials said, the situation was enabl
ing Castro to divert attention from his disavowal of an
agreement for the organized departure of some 10,000
Cubans in refuge at the Peruvian Embassy in Havana.
He made it appear that the United States is unwilling to
accept them.

Aid may halt if Congress is slow
WASHINGTON — Food stamp benefits for nearly
22 million Americans will be cut off June 1 unless Con
gress acts within three weeks to provide an extra $2.6
billion for the program. Department of Agriculture offi
cials said yesterday.
The Carter administration, deeply concerned over
possible disruption of the program, especially in an elec
tion year, is mobilizing to urge quick approval of the
funds.
Because of complex parliamentary procedures in
volved, however. Congress may miss a May 15 deadline
for action to avoid a cut-off directive from the Depart
ment of Agriculture to the states.
In an unusual bipartisan alliance, Sen. George
McGovern (D-S.D.) and Sen. Robert Dole (R-Kan.)
have teamed to support emergency approval of $750
million to assure food stamp benefits through June 30
while Congress considers the bigger sum.
The shortage of funds arose because Congress seri
ously underestimated the rise in food costs and the
number of Americans who would apply for the special
subsidy, officials said.
Stocks up after uneven trading
NEW YORK — Stock prices finished mostly higher in
an erratic session yesterday, but blue-chip issues failed
to extend Tuesday's dramatic gains.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which
surged 30.72 points Tuesday in its best daily showing in
more than a year and a half, slipped back .60 to 789.25.
Most other indicators moved ahead, however, and the
broad tally on the New York Stock Exchange showed
more than two gainers for every stock that lost ground.
Volume on the Big Board totaled 42.62 million
shares, down from 47.92 million Tuesday.
Today's weather
Partly cloudy today, clearing tonight. Fair tomorrow.
Warmer days. Lows in the 40s to low 50s. Highs in the
60s to low 70s. Northwest winds 10 to 20 mph after
noons and evenings.
