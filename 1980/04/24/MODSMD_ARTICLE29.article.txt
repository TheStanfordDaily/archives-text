Indecent exposure
A 22-year-old man from Menlo Park was arrested by
University police early yesterday morning after he ex
posed himself to a decoy police officer near Lake
Lagunita.
Captain Raoul Niemeyer of Police Services said the
man is also being investigated in connection with an
attempted rape early last week. He said a woman was
jogging near Junipero Serra and Frenchman's Road
when a man wearing a ski mask jumped from the side of
the road and tried to attack her.
The woman fended off the attack, contacted police but
decided not to file a report, Niemeyer said.
