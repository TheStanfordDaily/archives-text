A decision bv European allies to impose phased
economic and diplomatic sanctions against Iran may
prompt the I nited States to deter use of military force to
tr\ to free the American hostages held in Tehran, a
senior Carter administration official said vesterdav.
The official, who is deeply in\o!ved in planning I S
strategy in the Iranian crisis, criticized the nine Euro
pean Common Market countries for what he called a
lack of strategic understanding of the problems facing
the West in Iran.
"They are not responding adequately to the larger
strategic problems." said this official, who asked not to
be identified. "They've become regionalized."
President Jimmy Carter, at a news conference last
v, eek. as.ud it L .S and allied economic pressures against
Iran fail to win the release of the 50 Americans held
hostage at the I S. Embassy in Tehran, "the only next

step available that I can see would he some form of
military action."
Reassessment
Carter's statement, combined with an earlier informal
announcement ot a major I S. "reassessment" of the
hostage crisis b\ mid-Ma>. raised the prospect ot a I S.
run al blockade or some other forcible measure to tr\ to
gain release of the Americans, who ha\ e been held pris
oner since a militant mob sei/ed the embassy last No\ .4.
\n Iranian leader said \esterda\ he doubts Iran can
meet the European Common Market deadline of Ma\
I for release ot the American hostages. Further indica- |
tions surfaced ot closer economic and industrial cooper
ation between Iran and the Soviet I'nion.
( anada announced new economic and diplomatic
sanctions against Iran because ot its "serious and con
tinuing violation of international law" b\ holding the
hostages. Britain warned Iran it would risk sanctions bv

most nations unless it meets the mid-May deadline.
Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, head of Iran's Jus
tice Ministry and a member of the ruling Revolutionary
Council, was asked by reporters in Tehran about the
deadline set by Common Market foreign ministers dur
mga meeting in I uxembourg."We need more time," he
said.
Beheshti said the situation was made more difficult b\
the European actions: a ban on new export and service
contracts with Iran and all military sales to Iran and all
military sales to Iran, and reduction of diplomatic staffs
in Tehran.
I he European allies also threatened economic san
tions against I ran unless there is "decisiy e progress lead
ing to the release of the hostages" by May 17. The
Americans — 50 at the I S. Embassy and three .it the
Iranian f oreign Ministry — have been held since milit
ants occupied the embassy Noy. 4.
