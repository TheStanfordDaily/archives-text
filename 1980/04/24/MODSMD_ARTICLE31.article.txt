## Students rap registration 
### Carl Johnston 
A banner-waving crowd of about 150 gathered
in White Plaza yesterday to protest the passage of
President Jimmy Carter's draft registration prog
ram by the House of Representatives.
Veteran activist David Harris was scheduled to
speak at the rally, but cancelled his appearance the
night before, according t<> Stanford Against Con
scription (SAC) sources.
The noon-time protest was the second anti
registration rally on campus in less than a week
organized in response to Congressional proceed
ings to implement Carter's plan to register 18- and
19-year olds for the mi!itar\ draft.
Coordinated by SAC . the demonstration fea
tured speakers Claire Smith, of People Against the
Draft. Erench Prof. Raymond Giraud, and (iarv
Chapman, of the socialist New American Move
ment.
Activ ism
About 40 demonstrators marched to the Post
Office at the end of the speeches, shouting "Hell,
no! We won't go!" I hey stood outside tlu- building
for a few minutes while they continued theirchant.
Although the 40 were a relatively small propor
tion of the crowd, this was the first time SAC went
beyond its usual noon rally format of presenting
speakers without more direct forms of action.
Speaking to a crowd dotted with banners proc
laiming "I don't want to die for a gas line." and
"registration is an act of aggression. Ciiraud
blamed big oil companies' interests in the Persian !
Gulf. Carter's need to be viewed by the electorate ;
as a strong leader, and a general anger in the I n- !
ited States about events in Iran and Afghanistan as
"leading politicians to believe that now the time
may be rieht to have some sort of a war."

( ailing the registration plan a first step to a draft.
Giraud admonished the crowd "to do every thing
we can to fight this odious, dangerous, and needless
bill."
friendship
Smith encouraged protesters to oppose registra
tion "not from a position of hatred for oil com
panies. but on the basis of affection tor your friends
who might be killed in a war."
"Don't line up at the Post Office (to register tor
the draft) like lining up for Kool-Aid at Jones
town." Smith said.
Referring to complaints among supporters of the
Equal Riuhts \mendment that women should be
registered for the draft as well as men. Smith said
that "the role of women is not to make the same
mistakes as men. but to liberate them from these
mistakes."
Rising tide
Chapman encouraged people to "join the rising
tide of radical politics." He decried what he called
"a lack of personal self-affirmation and lack of
self-confidence" among many Americans. He
suggested ironically that a way to regain self
confidence is through the type of leadership train
ing provided by the I S. Army.
A better and less violent way. according to
Chapman, however, is to join "the great and ven
erable tradition" of radical causes in this country.
" I he time has come." Chapman said, "for vou to
decide vvInch side you're going to be on. You can be
on the side of Carter or (former California Gov.
Ronald) Reagan, or whoev er else is in power at the
time, or you can join the rising tide bv taking part in
radical politics now ... by fighting the draft, fight
ing the MX missile, fighting nuclear power, racism,
sexism, a nd all the other things that are holding vou
back."

the draft) like lining up for Kool-Aid at Jones
town." Smith said.
Referring to complaints among supporters of the
Equal Riuhts \mendment that women should be
registered for the draft as well as men. Smith said
that "the role of women is not to make the same
mistakes as men. but to liberate them from these
mistakes."
Rising tide
Chapman encouraged people to "join the rising
tide of radical politics." He decried what he called
"a lack of personal self-affirmation and lack of
self-confidence" among many Americans. He
suggested ironically that a way to regain self
confidence is through the type of leadership train
ing provided by the I S. Army.
A better and less violent way. according to
Chapman, however, is to join "the great and ven
erable tradition" of radical causes in this country.
" I he time has come." Chapman said, "for vou to
decide vvInch side you're going to be on. You can be
on the side of Carter or (former California Gov.
Ronald) Reagan, or whoev er else is in power at the
time, or you can join the rising tide bv taking part in
radical politics now ... by fighting the draft, fight
ing the MX missile, fighting nuclear power, racism,
sexism, a nd all the other things that are holding vou
back."
