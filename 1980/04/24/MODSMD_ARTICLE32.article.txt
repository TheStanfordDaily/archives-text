# ASSU Senate delays fee assessment petition cutoff
## 
### Sue Goldfarb 
In an effort to rally students to vote in the ASSI
election May 5 and 6 the ASSI Senate voted last night
to extend the fee assessment deadline from Friday to
Monday.
In the upcoming election, students will elect a new
senate, select a senior class president slate and vote on
fee assessments.
After the senate voted by a two-thirds vote to place a
fall-quarter Speakers Bureau fee assessment on the up
coming ballot, it instructed a newly-proposed fee as
sessment for cultural projects to petition tor placement.
l o be placed on the ballot, the group, which solicits
funds for ( incode Mayo, a (hicanoev cut. Black I ibera
tion Month, Stanford American Indian Association
Powwow and the Asian Art Series, will have to obtain
the signatures of roughly 1200 students 10 percent of
the student body.
ASSIJ Sen. Chris Greene said petitioning would
create student awareness ot the election, and thus give
the cultural fee assessment a better chance of passing.
At least 20 percent of the student body must vote in
order to validate the fee assessment elections.
Cireene said by placing the assessment on the ballot
automatically, there is a risk that the 20 percent figure

may not be met. If 20 percent of the student body does
not vote, the group can order a second election, which
would be held next tall, to try to pass their assessment
again. That would be too expensive, he said. He prop
osed the deadline extension to Monday to enable the
group to gather the required signatures.
ASSU Sen. Renee Richards said students here are
upset because there are too many f ee assessments on the
ballot. She said they sometimes don't remember signing
petitions and to put a new fee assessment on the ballot
without consultation of the student body is inapprop
riate.
Stating that the merging of four groups for a single fee
assessment is a precedent, Richards said the groups'
gathering of signatures would lend credibility to the
senate and allow students to decide whethei .. precedent
should be set or not.
The recently passed Club Sports fee assessment unites
all non-varsity sports under one assessment.
Richards said placing the Speakers Bureau fee as
sessment on the ballot does not contradict this policy
because the Speakers Bureau petitioned for a position
on the last ballot anil has gotten a fee assessment in each
of recent years.
Speakers Bureau, which won an assessment for
winter-spring in the last election, applied lor a fall quar-

ter assessment so they could bring "big names" to cam
pus and eosponsor events with 30 to 35 other groups.
"Every time something like this comes up. we're ac
cused of discrimination," Richards said.
I om Gart. immediate past Council of Presidents
member, said the ASSl is required fo hold an election
within 14 days of receiving a petition.
"If your petition isn't in until Tuesday, the COP will
put you oil the ballot anyway because it's too expensiv e
to run a special election." Gart assured members of the
minority groups.
In other financial matters, the senate overruled the
1 inance Committee's recommendation not to allocate
any funds to the annual Stanford Powwow sponsored by
the American Indian Association. Ihe association will
receive $200 in ASSl' funds to help finance the event.
Deputy Chair Yvonne Hill/ announced the ASSU
By-laws and Constitution are being put on LOTS by a
newly-hired computer operator. The mov e to computer
will facilitate amendments and reforms instituted in the
future because of the editing feature LOTS has.
Two alternates last night joined the ranks of voting
senators. Since Marc Ventresca and Dick Butterfield
were elected to COP last week. Terri Dohbcls and Julie
Johnson, the first two alternates, became voting mem
bers of the senate.
