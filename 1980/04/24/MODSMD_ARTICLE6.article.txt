# Fox: Unraveling the mystery of Mayan
## 
### Andrea James 
The Stanford a nth r op oli gists
work their way through the
Guatemalan jungles, avoiding the
hairy tarantulas and small green
lizards that dart across the worn
path. In the clearing ahead of
them awaits the huge stone
monument they seek, inscribed
with the foreign hieroglyphs they
are determined to decipher.
Ever since the secrets of the
Rosetta Sone and the Egyptian
pyramids were laid bare, modern

Anthropology

man has been obsessed with dis
covering the meaning of the odd
markings covering ancient
monuments. For years now, re
searchers have pored over the
photographs of the Mayan struc
tures that are hidden away in the
Guatemalan jungles and dot the
southern Mexican deserts, peer
ing closely at the complicated
hieroglyphics and aching to
know the history they relate.
James Fox, assistant professor
of anthropology here, is one such
researcher. His studies of the
Mayan language and culture
often take him to Guatemala,
south Mexico and the British
Honduras where he compares
and analyzes the 30 Mayan
dialects still spoken by more than
four million people and gets a
first-hand look at the ancient
Mayan writings.
When he returns to campus,
usually a month later, he does
intense comparative studies,
searching for clues as to the lan
guage's origin and meaning and
extrapolating from those find
ings to gain insight into ancient
Mayan culture.
Early interest
Fox's fascination with Indian
culture began when he was a
child growing up in a small Mon
tana town, surrounded bv Crow

and Cheyenne reservations.
"1 used to go out a lot to the
reservations," Fox remembers.
"I was interested in their (the In
dians') languages and decided
then that I wanted to study In
dian culture."
He did undergraduate work at
Brigham Young University,
studying foreign languages, and
then earned a master's degree in
international relations from the
Fletcher School of I .aw and Dip
lomacy in Boston. He also
studied ancient Egyptian at Har-

vard.
"1 was thinking then of a
career in international business
or government, or maybe the
foreign service," Fox said. But
he was too interested in theoreti
cal studies of language to give up
his education. So, after receiving
his degree from Fletcher in 1970,
he enrolled in the University of
Chicago, where he studied lin
guistic anthropology, concen
trating on the Mayan language.
Thriving language
"I chose Mayan because of its
many dialects and because it's a
language that's not dying out,"
he said. "Also, at that time it was
still a predominantly unde
ciphered writing system. It was
an enormous puzzle. I knew that
if I could help solve that puzzle I
would be contributing both to
world knowledge in general and
to the American Indian culture
in particular."
His studies took him to the
University of Hamburg for one
year where he studied under
Guenter Zimmerman, a world
renowned leader in Mayan
hieroglyphi c decipherment.
Studies there weren't too dif
ficult, he said, because he was
already fluent in German, one of
the 25 languages he now speaks.
He returned to Chicago in

-1972, earning his master's in
1974 and his doctorate in 197 N.
Stanford hired him after he
finished his paster's, and he
completed his studies for his doc
torate here while working as an
acting assistant professor and as
a resident fellow (RF) in Arroyo
House, an all-freshman dorm in
Wilbur Hall. He is currently in
his second year as RF of Rin
conada, another Wilbur
freshman dorm.
Five tours
Fox's first research trip to

Mexico took place in 1973 while
he was still working on his mas
ter's. Since then, he has traveled
to Latin America five times, both
for pure research and as a lec
turer for Alumni Association
tours.
"I haven't spent a lot of time
actually doing research in the
monument site areas," Fox said.
"Much of my work is intensely
comparative, so I use photo
graphs and drawings from arc
hive photos and facsimiles of the
ancient Mayan texts."
But he adds he hopes to spend
a lot more time in Central
America during the next few
years, studying the actual sites
and the culture of the Mayan
people.
Basic knowledge
Fox's work and that of many
other anthropologists has led to
the decipherment of most of the
ancient Mayan hieroglyphics.
Researchers know the basic sys
tem of the Mayan language and
can read most of the calendrical
and astronomical materials in
scribed on the monuments and
written in the three ancient texts
that still remain. This ability has
already given them good insight
into the ancient history. Fox said.
Inscriptions written as long
ago as 292 A.D. tell of the births,
deaths and marriages of ancient
rulers. They relate battles, the
number of captives in those hat
ties and who captured them.
Texts dating back to the 13th
century, probably copies of ear
lier books, served as manuals for
priests, astronomers and ancient
astrologists.
Succession theory
Some kinship terms have been
identified, helping an
thropologists piece together fam
ily life in ancient Maya. It is these
crucial glyphs that Fox and his
colleague John Justeson from
the University of South Carolina
have used to postulate their
theory of ruler succession in the
ancient culture.
"We think that succession to
the throne was based on the in
termarriage of cousins," Fox
said. "It appears from the glyphs
that, in order to rule an ancient
Mayan town, a man must marry
the daughter of the previous
ruler, the man must be the wo
man's cousin and he must come
from outside the town."
What happened to most of the
Mayan culture remains a mys
tery to today's anthropologists.
In the late ninth century, most of
the civilization seems to have col
lapsed. Cities were abandoned,
and the entire area suffered mass
depopulation. The cause could
have been internal weaknesses
due to high population density in
the area or an invasion of war
ring tribes in Mexico.
Only one area in northern
Yucatan retained the Mayan cul
ture in a half-hearted way until it
was conquered by the Spanish in
the 1500s. In that conquest, most
of the Mayan texts were burned.

leaving only three for resear
chers to ponder and to use to
piece together an entire civiliza
tion.
Many American archeologists
have been turned away recently
by Mexican officials who fear the
researchers and their large teams
of laborers will damage the his
torical sites or take away their
country's artifacts. But so far.
Fox said, he and his team have
not encountered problems.
"Linguists don't have many
troubles with the foreign gov
ernments," he said. "We don't
have the major logistic problems
archaeologists have with 70
laborers carting away artifacts.
We can do our work fairly unob
trusively."
Archeologists study the re
mnants of cultures to ascertain
man's lifestyle, while an
thropologists concentrate on
man and his changing values.
Alumni leader
Most of Fox's trips to the
Guatemalan highlands and jung
les have been with Alumni As-

sociation tours, where he serves
as a lecturer. The trips usually
last 15 days and include about 20
people. He takes alumni to the
major Mayan sites of Tikal in
Guatemala and the Altar of Sac
rifices and to other spots where
traces of ancient Olmec and
Mayan culture can still be seen.
This March, Fox plans to lead
a more rugged alumni trip into
Guatemala via steep foot trails
and motorized dugout canoe.
Lodging will be provided by pup
tents and sleeping bags.
"We're hoping a few students
can go on this trip," he said. "It
should be more exciting and
more nature-oriented than the
others."
Family affair
But one of the best trips Fox
thinks he'll ever experience was
the two-and-a-half-month re
search trip to Guatemala he took
in the summer of 1978. With him
was his then eight-year-old son
Hugh.
"It was a special experience
for both of us," Fox said. Not
only did he share more time with

his son, but having Hugh along
also opened up the way for him
to work more with today's
Mayan people.
"We'd be in a small Indian vil
lage. and an Indian man would
come to me and ask if my son
could play with his while I talked
with the villagers," Fox re
counted. "When it was time for
me to leave, I'd walk into the
man's house to pick up Hugh,
and I could see more closely how
the people lived, what their
home life was really like. I never
would have been brazen enough
before to go into a villager's
house."
Fox so thoroughly enjoyed in
cluding part of his family in his
work that he plans to take Hugh,
his wife Margaret or their three
other children with him on more
trips.
On 26th language
When he's not concentrating
on Mayan, Fox studies and
analyzes other languages, taking
a special interest in Russian
based pidgin and Creole lan-

guages. He already has a con
tract with the Stanford Press to
write a book on his studies in that
field.
Fox is also interested in the
biology of language — how hu
mans speak and hear sounds and
formulate words.
When he's not concentrating
on studies at all. Fox can be seen
among the tidepools north of
Point Reyes and Moss Beach or
out among his bee hives south of
Palo Alto.
"The Palo Alto Fire Depart
ment used to call me for help
whenever a swarm of bees was
found somewhere in the area,"
he said. "After catching 40
swarms I decided that was
enough, so this summer 1 stop
ped being on call."
And in his spare moments.
Fox still dreams of his ultimate
goal — devising his own lan
guage. With the fundamentals of
25 languages already secure in
his mind and another one —
Mandarin Chinese — now on its
way, he's well on his way to doing
it.
