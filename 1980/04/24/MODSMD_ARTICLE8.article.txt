# Camarillo: Looking at Chicanos' 'lost' past
## 
### Jimmy Glanzer 
The history of Mexican people
in the United States "has been
beclouded by misinterpretation
and neglect," according to Al
bert Camarillo, assistant profes
sor of history here.
In a recent work. Chicanos in a
Changing Society, Camarillo
writes. "It is ironic that so little is
known about a people who have
historically constituted one of
the largest ethnic groups in the
western United States."

History

Camarillo describes his latest
research on the history of
Chicanos in the United States as
an expansion of concepts pre
sented in Chicanos in a Changing
Society. In that work Camarillo
concentrated on Chicano history
from IN4B, the year of Califor
nia's annexation by the United
States, to 1930 and the Great
Depression.
Using primary and secondary
sources, Camarillo focused on
changes in the political and
economic status of Mexicans in
Santa Barbara as their tradi
tional pueblo society clashed
with and succumbed to Anglo
domination. He then compared
the Mexican experience in Santa
Barbara to the experience of
Mexicans in other areas of
southern California. The evolu
tion of the barrio, or Chicano
ghetto, in Los Angeles, San Ber
nardino and San Diego provided
a major point for comparison of
these experiences.
Camarillo is presently working
on what he calls "a volume two"
and says it will "cover Chicano
historv from its origins in the

Southwest and Midwest to the
present day."
The new research, begun two
years before Chicanos in a
Changing Society reached the
bookshelf, examines the history
of Chicanos in 10 cities across
the country.
"It is the first time anyone's
ever attempted to write a na
tional history of Mexican-
Americans in the cities and the
first time anyone will make a sys
tematic comparison between
blacks and Chicanos in the

cities," Camarillo says.
Camarilo emphasized the cur
rent conditions of Chicanos in
American society in this latest
research, tentatively titled The
Urban Chicanos: Mexican-
Americans in the Cities of the Un
ited States. Broader in scope than
his previous work, he estimates
the book will run more than 500
pages upon completion in 19H3.
'Structural constraints'
Camarillo believes Chicanos
were historically "locked into" a
class of semi-skilled or unskilled
workers by "structural con
straints" placed on them by the
dominant Anglo society. Poll
taxes and gerrymandering, the
division of voting districts in a
grotesque manner to suit politi
cal interests, were part of those
institutional constraints.
Camarillo says that gerryman
dering still exists as a way of
limiting the potential electoral
power of Chicanos in eastern Los
Angeles.
"In eastern L.A. there is a
population of one million
Chicanos who have not been
able to attain municipality,"

Camarillo observes. As an unin
corporated area of Los Angeles
the people living there cannot
control their district politically,
Camarillo says researcn shows
that "if Mexican-Americans
were to have the political clout
just by the potential of their
vote" they would gain the right
of self determination for their
community.
Childhood roots
Camarillo's interest in com
paring black and Chicano ex
periences in cities reflects his
own childhood experiences in
Compton. Calif., a black and
Chicano neighborhood "next to
Watts." He received his
bachelor's and doctorate in his
tory from UCLA.
The comparison of blacks and
Chicanos in his next book "will
be in terms of the persistence of
ghettos and barrios and in terms
of the job history of blacks and
Mexican-Americans,"
Camarillo says.
Political failings
Camarillo says his new re
search asks, "Why haven't these
groups attained the political in
fluence immigrant groups
have.?" Camarillo says his re
search will prove that the fault
lies with "attempts by the do
minant group to exclude" blacks
and Chicanos through "struc
tural constraints." Use of these
methods, Camarillo savs. placed
many blacks and Chicanos in "a
disadvantaged position."
The new research will also
examine "the common belief
that after World War II they
(blacks and Chicanos) began to
attain job and social mobility,"
according to Camarillo.
Camarillo says that he cannot
list any detailed conclusions
from his research. "1 don't think
I've digested all of the informa
tion." he comments. He does,
however, see "a lot of diversity
and heterogeneity" among to
day's Chicanos. For this reason
he says he will pay close atten

tion to the type and degree of
assimilation by Chicanos into
mainstream American culture.
Bicultural ideal
"If there's an ideal,"
Camarillo says,"it would be a
bicultural type of reality." Bicul
turalism, he explains, would
mean the coexistence of both
traditional Chicano and modern
American cultures.
In contrast to his examination
of Chicano assimilation,
Camarillo is also engaged in the
historical documentation of
reaction to illegal Mexican im
migration to the U.S.
Camarillo notes that largely
beause of illegal immigration
and, to a lesser extent, high birth
rates. Mexicans will constitute
the majority of California's
population by the turn of the
century. "There is a really severe
reaction to that," Camarillo says.
Camarillo also cites govern
ment statistics indicating that
one million illegal immigrants
arrive in the U.S. each year. If

that level is maintained, demog
raphers predict Mexicans will he
the largest minority in America
by the year 2015.
Class inclusion
Camarillo says he tries to in
corporate information he gains
through his research into his
classes here. He is currently co
teaching an undergraduate
course in Chicano culture. This is
the first time the course has been
ottered at the University.
Camarillo also teaches a course
entitled "An Oral Traditions
Perspective on Ethnic Minorities
and Women in the U.S." and one
graduate course in history.
" I he fact that there are so few
Chicano faculty at Stanford
means that all of the ethnic re
sponsibilities — University
committees, ethnic programs
and departmental commitees —
all those responsibilities fall on
about six people," Camarillo
says. He notes that the situation
is similar tor black faculty mem
bers.
