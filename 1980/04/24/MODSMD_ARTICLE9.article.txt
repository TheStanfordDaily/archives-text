# Mahood: Below volcanoes
## 
### Joan O'Connell 
When the Mount St. Helens
volcano developed geological
indigestion earlier this year, the
U.S Geological Survey team
examining the faulty mountain
said they didn't know whether it
was going to erupt or not. . . but
the local press in Washington
state feared the team wasn't tel
ling them the whole story.
So the reporters called Gail
Mahood, assistant professor of
geology here, who is currently
teaching a course in "volcanol
ogy." Mahood assured the skeo-

tical reporters that they, in truth,
had all the facts.
Right now, she explains, it is
not possible to predict when a
volcano will erupt. But the re
search that Mahood is working
on is helping scientists evaluate
the eruption-provoking changes
that take place in the deep
chambers below volcanoes.
Mahood, 28, became in
terested in geology and vol
canoes for several reasons. "I
knew I always wanted to be some
sort of scientist, but I really never
liked math that much. Besides,
there's something very satisfying
about knowing how the world
works," she said.
Igneous penologist
She describes herself as an
"igneous petrologist," rather
than a "volcanologist," although
most of her work centers around
volcanoes.
"A volcanologist is someone
who goes scurrying to the scene
whenever a volcano starts to
blow somewhere," she said.
"They (volcanologists) also
spend a lot more time doing
seismic work and sampling the
kinds of gases emitted from vol
canoes."
Volcanology combines
geochemistry, geophysics and
seismology, as well as geology.
Earthquakes are often the
precursor of volcanic activity, as
in the case of Mount St. Helens.
That area has undergone some
"seismic crises," which could
spark volcanic activity, although
none has yet occurred for that
reason.
Delayed response
Mahood's work, petrology, in
stead sends her to the scene hun
dreds, or more often thousands,
of years after an eruption to
study and date the rock samples
and the "mechanisms of dif
ferentiation." By analyzing the
rocks and minerals, she learns
how the composition of the

Geology

magma — molten rock and gases
beneath the volcano — has
changed through time for a par
ticular magma chamber.
There is a correlation between
the amount of certain substance,
like silica and iron present in the
magma and the kind of eruption
that is likely to take place, she
revealed.
"When the magma is poor in
silica and rich in iron, the more
peaceful the eruption is likely to
be, as in the Hawaiian volcanoes
where you have a spectacular fire
show, but you can stand right
there and watch it. But when it's

rich in silica and low in iron, you
have a more explosive erup
tion," Mahood said.'
For instance, in the case of
Mount St. Helens, the last erup
tion was 1 50 years ago and was
iron-rich in composition. "The
system probably has not had
time to build up to a high silicic
content," she said. Therefore,
there is probably not much
danger of a violent eruption. ,
What's down there?
Although the magma compos
ition studies may eventually aid
scientists in predicting eruptions,
this is only one facet of Mahood's
research, not her primary goal.
Her basic interest lies in simply
trying to understand what hap
pens in the chambers between
two and five kilometers below
the earth's surface.
The potential for economic
benefits as a result of her re
search, however, does exist,
since mapping the sites and col
lecting samples helps locate ore
samples and other trace metals.
For instance, the element
uranium is sometimes found in
magma. If erupted, the uranium
may form a concentrated ore de
posit if water runs through it.
Drilling directly into the
magma chambers below the vol
canoes would aid Mahood's
work, but she said that technique
really hasn't been tried yet. The
depth is not an insurmountable
problem — oil has been drilled at
that depth — but it's more dif
ficult to drill through volcanic
rock, and there is just not an
economic advantage in this kind
of drilling, she said.
Reverse process
Instead, Mahood goes to the
site and maps the area to record
and date the rocks which have
formed from different lava flows.
"In a sense, what I have to do
is stuff it (the magma) back down
the tube," she said.
Then she returns to the

laboratory and analyzes the
rocks to determine chemical
compositions and to date them
more precisely. Although the
field work is one of the most en
joyable aspects of her research,
she said that the laboratory
analysis and recording of data
take the most time.
"You have to do that for 10
months to have two months of
fun." she laughed.
Time constraints
So far at Stanford, the most
difficult part of her research has
been "finding the time to do it,"
she said. As a first-year faculty
member, Mahood's research has
had to take a backseat to her
teaching/advising duties. All be
ginning faculty members have to
teach at least one course per
quarter. "Initially it's a full-time
job — to do a good job," she
said. "At first I had to spend so
much time doing things like
scrounging through the rock col
lections for lab samples."
She taught an igneous petrol
ogy course last quarter and is
currently teaching "volcanol
ogy" to upper division under
graduates and graduate students.
Finishing up her dissertation has
also proved to be an added time
burden this year.
Mahood came here from
UC-Berkeley, where she worked
under one of the world's leading
petrologists, lan Carmichael.
She said she obtained her job
here in a fairly common way;
"When they are looking for
someone to fill a position, they
often ask someone who is well
known in the field to recommend
a student."
One of two
Mahood is one of only two
women in the School of Earth
Sciences here. The other is
Elizabeth Miller, a structural
geologist. Mahood said there
exists a "certain amount of pre
judice by older male faculty
members, but they get used to
having you around, and it tends

to disappear. This was not so
much the case here as at Ber
keley.
"It's interesting, hut women
three years ahead of me (Ma
hood finished her undergraduate
degree in 1974 and her master's
in 1976) had a lot of trouble, and
some emerged with chips on
their shoulders. When 1 was
going through, there was still
enough prejudice that 1 was
aware of it, hut I had an easier
time. Now when I look at women
about three years behind me,
they're able to just get down to
business."
Mahood's thesis work in
volved study of a small range of
volcanoes in Guadalajara,
Mexico, called Sierra la Primav
era — the springtime range.
'Learning experience'
It was suggested to her by
Carmichael, "He was flying into
Guadalajara, and he looked out
the window of the plane and saw
all these little volcanoes down
there. The next thing I knew I
was on a truck," she laughed.
She described her experience

in Mexico as a real "learning ex
perience," running the gamut
from learning exactly how to do
research, to more pragmatic
tasks as securing vehicles and
"figuring our which road goes
where," on the site. She has pub
lished one paper about her find
ings, with another in the process
of being printed.
Although no outstanding
geological findings emerged
from her work on Sierra la
Primavcra, she said it was "startl -
ing to the Mexicans to find that
there was a caldera — a large,
fairly circular depression formed
by collapse of the summit of the
volcano — there which was re
ally very young on a geological
timescale. They had thought it
was millions of years old."
Money maze
Mahood's work in Mexico was
financed by a research grant,
which Carmichael controlled,
from the National Science Foun
dation (NSF). She explained that
these kinds of grants support
many research projects. "An ad

visor will write a research prop
osal and get students to help, she
said. Following the research,
they will write up the results and
publish them, with the name of
the group funding the research
prominent in the report. "The
mark of good science is expres
sion in a publication," she said.
Mahood's research is now par
tially sponsored by the School of
Earth Sciences here through a
small stipend, which pays for
some equipment and fieldwork.
She is, yet, in the process of ap
plying for a faculty "starter
grant" of $10,000, made availa
ble by the University to young'
faculty members trying to start
out in research, according to
Mahood.
She is also applying to the
NSF, a major source of support
for researchers. Obtaining these
kinds of grants will enable her,
and her students too, to conduct
more research.
Mexican summer
This summer Mahood and a
student will return to Mexico, fi
nanced by an NSF grant, and do
some research in the "Mexican
volcanic belt," mapping sites and

collecting samples for petrologic
study.
She will also visit the island of
Pantelleria, off the coast of Sicily
and the Coast of Africa, to study
a volcano with the somewhat
"unusual composition" of a very
high flourine and chlorine con
tent. This trip will be financed in

part by the School of Earth Sci
ences and in part from Mahood's
own pocket.
Mahood said she enjoys the
atmosphere here and feels it is
conducive to her research. She
looks forward to staying here for
a long time — although certainly
not on a geologic timescale.
