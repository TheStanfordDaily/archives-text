PEKING — China has agreed to join with an Ameri
can firm in building a 19-story luxury hotel in Peking,
scheduled to be the largest hotel in the Chinese capital
ind the first Sino-American joint venture under ne\v
investment guidelines.
Chinese authorities took the unusual step of announc
ing on the front page of the Communist Party news
paper. the /'copies Daily, their approval of the $70
million to $80 million "Great Wall" hotel. The plans
include a swimming pool and a computerized accounting
system, unheard of at hotels here.
Construction is expected to begin this year and the
hotel scheduled to open in l ( '«S3. The prominent an
nounceinent of the landmark deal indicated Chinese
interest in encouraging further such ventures despite
delays in negotiations involv ing several other American
companies here.
It also underlined the advantages to American com
panies who have Chinese-Americans actively involved
in the negotiations, in this case former Bendix Corp.
Vice President C.B. Sung of San Francisco.

China's newly created Foreign Investment Commis
sion ratified the contract between the China Interna
tional Travel Service and the E-S Pacific Development
and Construction Co. Ltd.. whose principal officers are
Sung and financier Cyrus Eaton, Jr. The firm last year
underscored its interest in the Chinese market with a
$150 million investment in the government's new
Chinese International Trust and Investment Corp.
The foreign investment commission also announced
approval of two other joint ventures for construction of a
smaller hotel in Peking with a Hong Kong company and
tor a new catering service at Peking's new international
airport, also with a Hong Kong firm.
reached at his home in San Francisco, said under
til. new Chinese guidelines the government travel ser
\ !c will hold 51 percent and his company 49 percent
interest in the hotel and split profits accordingly.
American success
The success of the recently organized American firm's
venture here contrasts sharply with the difficulties en
countered by Intercontinental Hotels Corp. in pursuing
a preliminary agreement signed in November 1978 to

build five or six hotels.
No final agreement has been signed for the deal, once
estimated at $500 million. A spokesman for Pan Ameri
can World Airways, which owns International Hotel
Corp., said talks still are "progressing slowly."
Reassessment
In early 1979 China seemed to step back from many
large preliminary developments deals with Western
companies. Peking underwent a major reassessment of
its economic resources, and since then has moved for
ward cautiously, committing itself mostly to smaller pro
jects on a step-by-step basis.
The Chinese have continued to view tourism, how
ever, as a relatively easy way to rapidly increase their
foreign exchange earnings significantly. The three newly
announced joint ventures — the American-backed
1000-room "Great Wall" hotel, the Hong Kong-backed
528-room Jianguo Hotel and the catering service — all
are designed to increase tourist services. Peking received
150,000 tourists in 1979, up 4 1 percent from 1978, but
the facilities here were strained severely.
