# Vietnam in critical period
## 
### Keyes Beech The Los Angeles Times 
BANGKOK, Thailand â€” Five years after they
won the war, Vietnam's Communist rulers are fac
ing perhaps the most critical period in their long
and bloody revolutionary history.
They have not only lost the peace, but they have
plunged their country deep into an economic and
political quagmire from which there is no visible
escape without a major change of course. And no
such change seems to be in the cards.
Military machine intact
The formidable North Vietnamese military
machine remains intact, if over-extended, with an
estimated 200,000 troops deployed along the bor
der with China, another 200,000 committed to
Cambodia and about 50,000 in Laos.
But the cost to Vietnam's economy has been
high. Economic growth in the north has been re
duced to zero. By official admission, the people
have barely enough to eat. By contrast, the "liber
ated"' south is comparatively well-fed.
Goodwill evaporated
The international goodwill that Hanoi enjoyed
in the afterglow of victory has long since evapo
rated. So has most of the desperately needed
foreign aid. It dried up with Vietnam's ruthless
expulsion of ethnic Chinese and the invasion of
Cambodia.
"There's been a change of roles," an American
diplomat said.
"The guys in Hanoi are no longer knights in
shining armor battling the wicked American im
perialists. Today they're the black hats." And, he
added, "instead of playing David to our Goliath,
they're now cast as Goliath."
Indochina a hollow ruin
Hanoi's devastated Indochina empire is in large
part a hollow ruin held together only by force of
arms.
More than a million people, including many of its

best brains, have fled Indochina since the Com
munists seized power in 1975. And while the Mood
of refugees peaked last year, the end is not in sight.
More than 4000 Vietnamese made their escape last
month. Laos and Cambodia are still hemorrhaging.
Yet Bangkok-based analysts say that Hanoi's
grip on its own people, as well as its satellite states
of Cambodia and Laos, remains i'irm. It is likely to
stay that way so long as the Soviet Union, Hanoi's
only major backer, continues to pour military aid
into Vietnam at a rate estimated at $3 million a
day.
Moscow tired
Diplomatic sources scoff at the suggestion that
Moscow is getting tired of its Vietnam burden.
''With a bloated military budget like theirs-,(Sup
plying military hardware to Vietnam is the easiest
thing the Russians can do," said a Western official
with experience in both Moscow and Southeast
Asia.
More to the point, he said, is that Vietnam is an
excellent investment for the Russians. It added a
whole new dimension to Soviet military power by
giving the Russians use of U.S.-built air and naval
bases in South Vietnam at a time when American
military strength in this part of the world was never
lower.
Vietnam a brake
Moreover, Vietnam serves as a brake on Chinese
expansionism in Southeast Asia, in addition to pre
senting China with a hostile presence on its south
ern flank.
But this cuts two ways. One of the greatest bur
dens Hanoi has to bear is the oppressive weight of
one billion hostile, unforgiving Chinese on its
northern border.
"The greatest mistake Vietnam ever made," one
analyst said, "was to ally itself with the Soviet
Union against China. In the end, that mistake
could be fatal, for China is always there and the
Russians are far away."
