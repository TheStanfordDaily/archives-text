# Said to perpetuate discrimination
## Mobile may keep at-large elections 
### Jim Mann The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — In a set
hack for civil rights forces, the
Supreme Court ruled this week
that cities may use an at-large
election system to select their
local governments, even if the
system works in a way that re
duces the voting strength of ra
cial minorities.
By a vote of 6 to 3, the court
upheld the at-large election sys
tem by which Mobile, Ala., has
chosen its City Commission since
1911. Black voters had argued
that the system made it harder
for black officials to win election
in Mobile.
Under an at-large election sys
tem, all the voters throughout a
city select all the officials. Under
a system of single-representative
districts, a city is subdivided into
smaller areas, each of which
selects its own city commissioner
or councilman.
Black voters in Mobile con
tended that the city's at-large
system violated their 15th
Amendment rights to vote and
their 14th Amendment rights to
equal protection of the laws. But
in an opinion for a four-man
plurality of the court. Justice
Potter Stewart said these rights
arc not violated unless there is
proof that the system was
adopted for the specific purpose
of discriminating against blacks.
Outrage
The ruling provoked an un
usually outraged dissent from
Justice Thurgood Marshall, the
court's only black member, who
said the decision made the court
"an accessory to the perpetua
tion of racial discrimination."

Marshall said that if the Sup
reme Court approves what he
called sophisticated methods of
discrimination, then "it cannot
expect the victims of discrimina
tion to respect political channels
of dissent."
In the main opinion for the
court, Stewart wrote that the
Constitution "does not require
proportional representation as
an imperative of political organi
zation."
Stewart's decision was en
dorsed by Chief Justice Warren
Burger and Justices William Re
hnquist and Lewis Powell, Jr. In

separate opinions. Justices John
Paul Stevens and Harry
Blackmun agreed, though for
somewhat different reasons.
To exclude blacks
The three dissenters were
Marshall and Justices William
Brennan. Jr., and Byron White.
However, White and Brennan
wrote their own separate dis
sents and did not sign Marshall's
angry attack on the court. These
two justices noted that there was
evidence Mobile maintained its
at-large system for the purpose
of keeping out black officials.
In June 1975, a group of black

voters in Mobile filed suit against
the city and the three members
of the City Commission govern
ing Mobile. Mobile is 35 percent
black, but no black official has
ever been elected to the City
Commission.
Both a federal district judge
and the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit ruled in
favor of the blacks and ordered
the city to adopt a new local gov
ernment with a mayor and a City
Council elected from single
member districts. On Tuesday,
however, the Supreme Court
overturned these rulings.
