# Concrete boat race at lake
## 
### Chris Mills Staff Writer 
Lake Lagunita will be the
scene of a concrete canoe race
this Sunday.
"Stone boats" from 12 West
ern colleges are scheduled to
compete in the race, as the final
event of a weekend-long confer
ence sponsored by the Stanford
chapter of the American Society
of Civil Engineers (ASCE).
Paddlers from as far away as
the University of Nevada at
Reno and Cal State at Los
Angeles are planning to truck
their vessels here for the fes
tivities, according to senior
Rodger Miller, chapter presi
dent. Also entered are teams
from UC-Berkeley, San Jose
State, University of Santa Clara,
San Francisco State and Chico
State, he said.
In last year's race on Lake
Vasona, Los Gatos, a crew of
Stanford professors scored an

"upset" by accidentally ramming
and sinking the Chico State
canoe.
The last time Stanford's stu
dent crew won first place was in
1974. Since then Cal has domi
nated the races.
"Chico State's canoe is the one
we have to watch out for this
year," civil engineering senior
John Reed said. "After all the
work they put into building their
canoe, they were very angry at
having it sunk."

Reed and six other civil en
gineering students have been
working for a month on this
year's entry. When finished, it
will be 18 feet long and weigh
more than 300 pounds, he said.
"Before we built this, I did not
think anyone could really make a
concrete canoe," said one of
Reed's co-workers. "And I still
don't."
The races will begin at 9 a.m.,
and awards will be presented at 1
p.m., according to Miller.
