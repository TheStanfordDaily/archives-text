## I'll give old time religion another try 
### 
Now that everyone's being
Born Again, I think maybe I
ought to give it another try. I
didn't seem to be much good at it
when I was younger. In fact. I
probably hold some sort of re
cord for the most failed attempts
at being saved. If it's not a world
record, then it certainly is a re
cord in my home town in Min
nesota. I must have been doing
something wrong.
1 don't remember much about
the first years of my religious
training. One thing that stands

out in particular occurred when I
was in the fourth grade. It was in
our annual Christmas play. I was
playing a Wise Man, and I over
acted a bit. I kicked the guy from
the sixth grade who was playing
the part of my camel to spur him
on. 1 guess I d seen too many
westerns. Anyway, the guy got
angry and started bucking. But 1
grabbed on tight and managed to
ride him for the full eight seconds
before being thrown off. I landed
on the cradle.
Alice Johnson was playing the
part of Mary, and she got so
upset that she forgot all her lines
and started to cry. The play
ended rather abruptly and we got
our candy early.
I should tell you this about
Alice. She was a knockout. She
had long brown hair, and she
wore glasses. That's why 1 fell for
her. I mean for her glasses, not
for her hair.
She was the only other kid in

my class at school who had to
wear glasses. Hers were pink
with silver speckles. They were
so hideous compared to mine
that I almost forgot 1 had to wear
glasses myself. I'll always love
her for that. One other thing
about Alice. Her father was the
pastor of our church.
After the play. Alice told me I
was a heathen and that she had
decided that when we grew up
she wouldn't marry me after all.
A year earlier Alice had planned
our In cs for us. She had decided

that when we graduated from
college we were going to get
married, become missionaries,
and move to some place that had
heathens to save. It all seemed
reasonable at the time.
1 think it was the following
Sunday that I first got the urge to
get saved. 1 went to see Mr.
Johnson after church, and we
talked for a long time. 1 said all
the words I was supposed to and
then Mr. Johnson shook my
hand and said I was saved. 1 tried
to act excited but I remember I
was disappointed at the time be
cause I didn't really feel any dif
ferent. I figured maybe it would
just take a few days to sink in.
Hie next Sunday I got to go to
the front of the church after the
sermon so that everyone could
shake my hand and welcome me
to the fold. But before I'd shaken
many hands I started to feel
nuiltv because I still didn't feel

any different than I had before 1
was saved. But 1 didn't say any
thing.
That afternoon Alice forgave
me for ruining the Christmas
play. I was so happy that I told
Alice it was better to be forgiven
by her than it was to be forgiven
by God. That was the start of my
heresy.
The next few years went by
like they're supposed to for a kid
in a small town, except for one
thing. I started feeling guiltier
and guiltier when Sundays came
around. 1 still didn't feel like 1
was saved, yet 1 was pretending
to be. Finally, I started getting so
nervous on Sundays that 1 didn't
even want to go to church. 1 de
cided there was nothing to do but
get saved all over again.
Mr. Johnson didn't like the
idea at all. He tried to prove to
me that once was enough, but in
the end he let me say the words
over again. That was probably
his first real mistake as a minis
ter. He should have stood firm
because the second time didn't
work any better than the first.
And that's when I started to
panic.
I knew Alice could never love
me if I were a heathen so I had to
get saved. I started seeing Mr.
Johnson more and more often.
By the time I reached the 11th
grade I was talking to him every
Sunday afternon. And 1 tried to
get sa\ ed most of those Sundays.
But it never seemed to work.
It might have ended diffe
rently if Mr. Johnson had thought
1 was faking, or if he'd had more
self-confidence to begin with.
But he knew I was serious, and
one day when I was telling him
that I still didn't feel saved he
told me he felt he hadn't really
been called to the ministry. He
broke down and told me he'd al
ways wanted to be a truck driver
because he liked the sound of the
horns on the big rigs.
During my senior year. Mr.
Johnson resigned as pastor of
our church and went to truck,
driving school. Alice blamed me
for her father's fall and told me
she never wanted to see me
again. I was heartbroken.
I've been writing to Alice
every month for 1 1 years. I think
she's starting to come around. I
believe she's finally admitted to
herself that her father is happy
now. He owns a fleet of six 18-

wheelers and he still drives one
ot them himself. He sends me a
nice card every Christmas.
In her last letter from New
Guinea, Alice said she's coming
back this summer. I think maybe
I'd like to get saved by then if I
can, but I'm a bit wary. 1 don't
want to upset anyone else like I
did Mr. Johnson.
On second thought maybe I'll
just wait for Alice. She'd proba
bly enjoy the challenge. And
when 1 think about it. I have to
admit I've probably been saving
myself for her all along.
