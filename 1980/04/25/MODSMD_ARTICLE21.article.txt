## Martial spirit misguided 
### 
A martial spirit is clearly in the
air when an eminently liberal
publication like The New Repub
lic urges that, in the event of a
Soviet invasion, "we should be
prepared to seize the part of Iran
that is important to us: its oil
fields" (TNR, Jan. 26).
It is, of course, devoutly to be
hoped that such talk will deter
the Soviets from advancing on
the Persian Gulf, or from trying
to impose their European Marx
ist barbarism on any more inno
cent people. However, that
things have come to this hysteri
cal extremity is testimony to a
bipartisan failure of American
foreign policy, which has too
often been misguided by
ideologic delusions.
One such delusion, until re
cently fashionable among liber
als, is that Soviet intentions are
basically benign, and that their
leaders can be trusted to act in
good faith. Yet it is opportunism,
not good faith, which best ac
counts for recent Soviet be
havior: their utter disregard for
the Helsinki accords, their spon
sorship of Cuban militarism in
Africa and the Horn, their sup
port for Palestinian Liberation
Organization (PLO) subver
sives, and now their invasion of
Afghanistan conveniently coin
ciding with events in Iran.
Had President Jimmy Carter
responded more intelligently to
earlier provocations, or had he
shown more consistency in the
matter of the Cuban brigade, it is
possible that the present crisis
might have been averted. In
stead, we arc left with his whin
ing moral outrage at being bet
rayed by his dear Leonid
(Brezhnev, Soviet Premier),
whom he so recently clasped to
his bosom to kiss in Vienna.
It would be folly, though, to
react to such naivete by embrac
ing the opposite, right-wing de
lusion that wc must rely on a
military strategy to protect our
"vital interests" in the Mideast.
In fact, given the strategic vul

nerability of our oil lifeline, no
such protection is possible. It is
bad enough that our supply lines
to the Persian Gulf extend 8000
miles over water, as opposed to a
few hundred miles over land for
the Soviets; worse yet that we
would be massively outnum
bered in terms of tanks and man
power.
But all of this is beside the
point, given that our flow of oil
could be cut by a single bombing
run, or a mere platoon of
saboteurs in the Straits of Hor
muz. Ouite simply, a Mideast
war is a losing proposition for us.
No more promising is the no
tion that by involving ourselves
more deeply in Mideastern poli
tics we can hope to maintain a
stable balance of power. This is
the delusion of realpolitik a la
former Secretary of State Hdnry
Kissinger, who arranged the pre
sent debacle in Iran: nor is it
likely that His Excellency, Presi
dent Zia ul-Haq of Pakistan, will
provide any more stable a bas
tion against Communism than
did the shah.
Given the vagaries of Islamic
politics, it is far more likely that
our presence will fevolve into a
casus belli for others, as had oc
curred in Iran.
The only sober policy under
the circumstances is to commit
ourselves to the principles of
demilitarization and national au
tonomy in the Mideast. Rather
than pandering arms to the
Pakistanis or establishing bases
in Somalia or Oman, we should
be offering to negotiate with the
Soviets for a permanent ban on
all outside military intervention
in the Mideast.
We should stand up for the
right of all nations to self
determination, and seek to ex
pose Soviet intelligence opera
tions where they subvert this
principle. And we should stop
discussing the Mideast as if it
were our own rightful oil reserve,
or the Flanders of World War
111.

Finally, and most importantly,
we should recognize the folly of
the nuclear arms race when the
real threat to national security
comes from our dependence on
imported oil. Precisely because
of the Soviet threat to the
Mideast, we should ratify SALT
II and get on with SALT 111.
The money to be allocated for
the MX missile would do far
more for our security if spent on
energy conservation instead. For
that matter, the entire defense
budget might well be financed by
a $50 per barrel tax on imported
oil.
Oh yes: there is also the matter
of the draft. It seems unlikely,
from the above, that conscrip
tion makes any sense. What stu
dents might more profitably be
employed in, is questioning the
bankrupt ideologies of both left
and right, which have gotten us
into this mess.
