## Are hostages Soviet bait? 
### 
The media still sees the milit
ants occupying the American
embassy in Tehran as some sort
of spontaneous Moslem youth
group. But they have shown a
tightness and organizational dis
cipline that would be unusual for
these circumstances.
rhey have also had close con
tacts and consultation with the
Palestine Liberation Organiza
tion. which is Marxist and pro-
Soviet. Also, during the Russian
invasion of Afghanistan, the
Soviet embassy in Tehran was
defended by the militants. If the
Soviets are pulling the strings of
the militants, what might the
plan be?
It could be ominous. It turns
out that the mosque seizure in
Saudi Arabia last November was
not so much a religious squabble,
as first reported, but a carefully
planned action involving several
hundred trained guerrillas from
South Yemen, a Soviet client
state.

They had the very political aim
of seizing the Saudi king, it st
rains belief that an action of this
magnitude could he ac
complished without the close
consultation and approval of the
Soviet Union.
Why should the Soviets spon
sor an action that may have been
an attempt to topple Saudi
Arabia? Surely the Soviets must
realize that if Saudi Arabia were
about to topple, the United
States would intervene. It would
be a wasted effort, and counter
productive if American presence
was reasserted.
It makes more sense if the
Soviets had planned to counter
any American rescue attempt
and defend the Saudi revolution.
In short, the Soviets may be
planning to seize the Persian
Gulf and the oil-rich nations
there, even to the point of a
military showdown with the Un
ited States.
With the failure of the mosque

uprising, the Soviet bait could be
the hostage crisis in Tehran. If
the United States could be
goaded into military action, the
Soviets would have a chance to
intervene and "save" the Iranian
revolution.
To this purpose, the militants,
i! they were dyncing to a Soviet
tune, would not release the hos
tages, but continue to hold them,
perhaps with trials or executions,
in order to bring about the de
sired super-power confronta
tion.
During the last two years, the
Soviets have installed an impres
sive intermediate ballistic missile
force with the Warsaw Pact
forces. Added to an already
existing superiority in conven
tional weaponry, this force con
stitutes a nuclear blackmail card
that could be meant to keep
Western Europe neutral in any
Soviet-American showdown.
