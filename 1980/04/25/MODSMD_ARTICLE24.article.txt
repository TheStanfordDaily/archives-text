# Let's start appreciating each other
## 
### 
Last weekend I had the chance
to go camping in Rig Sur for the
first time. The same old nagging
things tried to keep me at Stan
ford. hut eventually 1 left them
lying under some desk in UGLY.
Later I lay in my sleeping hag
and let my eyes wander over the
billions of tiny lights overhead. 1
decided (again) that stars are
amazing. Who would ever have
thought of stars? Brilliant lights
piercing a deep blue curtain.
I went to sleep that night really
appreciating the stars. I guess to

me they represent some kind of
ideal in beauty and simplicity.
I'm very glad, knowing that stars
are out of the reach of the pollut-
When I returned to Stanford
after the weekend, I remem
bered one of the reasons I had
wanted to get away; and I de
cided that if I was so willing to
defend the stars because I think
they are so valuable, then I
should be ready to speak out
about something much more
valuable that I think we all injure
and destroy in small ways every

day.
1 think we need a lot of work in
the ways that we treat a part of
nature very close to us: each
other. It strikes me as pretty
funny, hut also pretty sad, how
we literally deify nature, spend
ing endless energy making sure
that it is given due respect and
appreciation, while we often de
cline to treat the people around
us with anything even resembl
ing love and respect.
I think I know why this hap
pens. It is easy to care for and
celebrate the stars . . . You can

count on them to hold the same
configurations night after night,
always to shine gently, always to
be beautiful. The stars bother no
one. It takes no effort to love
stars.
It isn't easy to love people.
Some act the way we like. We
agree with their views and think
their jokes are funny. These
people become our friends.
Other people bother us. They
may be inconsiderate. They may
do things we find stupid, vulgar,
or simply obnoxious. We may
give these people a "trial period"
to prove their worth. If they
don't pass, they're gone. We
write them off.
I don't think I am exaggerat
ing. Think of the dorms you have
lived in. Right now I live in a
University residence that is
much more tightly-knit than
most. But over the course of the
year I have watched a pattern
develop, and I expect that it is
fairly typical.
For about the first quarter of
school, people tried to be nice to
each other. But during winter
quarter, when everyone seems to
be in a bad mood anyway, the
general trend seemed to be to
divide and discriminate. Some
people became our friends; the
rest got very little, if any, respect
or love from us.
Now it is spring, and the
weather is finally improving. But
the rifts between people seem
permanent.

I simply find this sad, and I'm
writing this because I think that
anyone who stops and thinks
about it will also find it sad.
Maybe we can begin to change
our habits a little.
So last night 1 wrote down
three suggestions that I think
could make a difference. They
are answers to the question of
what attitudes and actions go
into cherishing and correctly
valuing the people around us.
First, we have to stop destroy
ing people behind their backs. It
is so easy to do; in fact, it is often
one more thing we can have in
common with our friends: a
mutual disdain for those we dis
like. But it is so destructive, and
it is no better than insulting
people to their face.
Second, the whole pattern of
writing off the people we don't
naturally like is a waste of a great
opportunity we have here at
Stanford to learn about other
people who are not just like us. I
know I have ignored individuals
merely on the strength of other
people's opinions about them,

only to find that when I finally
talked to the person, he was
much; more agreeable than any
one would have led me to be
lieve.
Maybe we can begin to em
phasize what draws us together
instead of what divides us, and
seek to be reconciled to people
instead of holding grudges.
Finally, we have to believe
that even if in the end we simply
cannot understand another per
son and do not like one thing
about him, that person is still a
human being and as such is valu
able.
1 believe that if we began to
think along these lines, we might
begin to give the same respect
and appreciation to the people
around us that we give to the
stars. Things will never be per
fect as long as we are imperfect
people; but there is still a great
deal that we can learn.

always to shine gently, always to
be beautiful. The stars bother no
one. It takes no effort to love
stars.
It isn't easy to love people.
Some act the way we like. We
agree with their views and think
their jokes are funny. These
people become our friends.
Other people bother us. They
may be inconsiderate. They may
do things we find stupid, vulgar,
or simply obnoxious. We may
give these people a "trial period"
to prove their worth. If they
don't pass, they're gone. We
write them off.
I don't think I am exaggerat
ing. Think of the dorms you have
lived in. Right now I live in a
University residence that is
much more tightly-knit than
most. But over the course of the
year I have watched a pattern
develop, and I expect that it is
fairly typical.
For about the first quarter of
school, people tried to be nice to
each other. But during winter
quarter, when everyone seems to
be in a bad mood anyway, the
general trend seemed to be to
divide and discriminate. Some
people became our friends; the
rest got very little, if any, respect
or love from us.
Now it is spring, and the
weather is finally improving. But
the rifts between people seem
permanent.

I simply find this sad, and I'm
writing this because I think that
anyone who stops and thinks
about it will also find it sad.
Maybe we can begin to change
our habits a little.
So last night 1 wrote down
three suggestions that I think
could make a difference. They
are answers to the question of
what attitudes and actions go
into cherishing and correctly
valuing the people around us.
First, we have to stop destroy
ing people behind their backs. It
is so easy to do; in fact, it is often
one more thing we can have in
common with our friends: a
mutual disdain for those we dis
like. But it is so destructive, and
it is no better than insulting
people to their face.
Second, the whole pattern of
writing off the people we don't
naturally like is a waste of a great
opportunity we have here at
Stanford to learn about other
people who are not just like us. I
know I have ignored individuals
merely on the strength of other
people's opinions about them,

only to find that when I finally
talked to the person, he was
much; more agreeable than any
one would have led me to be
lieve.
Maybe we can begin to em
phasize what draws us together
instead of what divides us, and
seek to be reconciled to people
instead of holding grudges.
Finally, we have to believe
that even if in the end we simply
cannot understand another per
son and do not like one thing
about him, that person is still a
human being and as such is valu
able.
1 believe that if we began to
think along these lines, we might
begin to give the same respect
and appreciation to the people
around us that we give to the
stars. Things will never be per
fect as long as we are imperfect
people; but there is still a great
deal that we can learn.

Last weekend I had the chance
to go camping in Rig Sur for the
first time. The same old nagging
things tried to keep me at Stan
ford. hut eventually 1 left them
lying under some desk in UGLY.
Later I lay in my sleeping hag
and let my eyes wander over the
billions of tiny lights overhead. 1
decided (again) that stars are
amazing. Who would ever have
thought of stars? Brilliant lights
piercing a deep blue curtain.
I went to sleep that night really
appreciating the stars. I guess to

me they represent some kind of
ideal in beauty and simplicity.
I'm very glad, knowing that stars
are out of the reach of the pollut-
When I returned to Stanford
after the weekend, I remem
bered one of the reasons I had
wanted to get away; and I de
cided that if I was so willing to
defend the stars because I think
they are so valuable, then I
should be ready to speak out
about something much more
valuable that I think we all injure
and destroy in small ways every

day.
1 think we need a lot of work in
the ways that we treat a part of
nature very close to us: each
other. It strikes me as pretty
funny, hut also pretty sad, how
we literally deify nature, spend
ing endless energy making sure
that it is given due respect and
appreciation, while we often de
cline to treat the people around
us with anything even resembl
ing love and respect.
I think I know why this hap
pens. It is easy to care for and
celebrate the stars . . . You can

count on them to hold the same
configurations night after night,
always to shine gently, always to
be beautiful. The stars bother no
one. It takes no effort to love
stars.
