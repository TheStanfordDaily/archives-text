## Dorian Benkoil Draw fair-blame housing 
### 
Something about having "home sweet home"
decided hy the luck of the Draw offends my basic
sensibilities. I'd like to think that the choice of
where I hang my hat is more in my control.
Yet, after much pondering, I cannot come up
with a much better idea than a lottery. There are a
limited number of living spaces on campus, and
some non-discriminatory method has to be used to
decide who will get first choice of living spaces. A
computer draw would serve the same purpose, but
picking numbers by hand out of an old trunk adds
panache to an otherwise dull ritual.
Furthermore, the fairness of the Draw has been
increased this year by not giving returning resident
priority to unguaranteed students. Some continuity
in houses is insured by giving guaranteed student
priority. However, guaranteed students, with or
without priority, should always get choices before
the unguaranteed.
This does not mean that I find nothing wrong
with the current system. Students who consistently
draw poorly are "shafted." Perhaps a student who
draws poorly the first time around could be given

some sort of priority the next year, to insure that he
has the same opportunities to the Stanford Experi
ence as those immortals who consistently draw low
numbers. Perhaps he could draw from a pool of
lower numbers than the immortals.
The real crimt; is in the lack of housing. How can
a university as wealthy as Stanford force so many of
its students off campus? Even some Row houses on
campus are five-minute bike rides from many
classrooms.
I can't help wondering why there has been no
display of Stanford fund-raising finesse in order to
raise money to provide convenience for the people
who, supposedly, reap the benefits of the Univer
sity. Some will say that the new Lake Lag dorms are
the answer. I can't help but wonder whether these
dorms will really solve the problem. Will Stanford
keep its admissions quotas the same, or will it admit
more students?
The housing situation here, while largely fair,
still deserves some serious review.
