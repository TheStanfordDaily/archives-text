Hunger in Cambodia
I suppose forgetfulness isn't
very notable; it's about as un
usual as breathing for most of us.
Just about anything we're capa
ble of thinking or perceiving is
vulnerable to getting lost in our
heads — presidents forget
pledges, singers forget songs and
men forget their Maker.
Recent "world shattering"
events have been obscured by a
multitude of other global pro
lems that seem to spring up out
of nowhere. The result is that
these events stay in our con
sciousness about as long as a
moderate case of the flu.
No doubt the Cambodian
people have been the most re
cent, and perhaps the most sur
prising, example of our memory
difficulties. I remember the in
dignation of many at the Univer
sity over the Cambodian war and
famine; comparisons with the
Holocaust were common and
students were willing to contri
bute both time and money to
help ease the terrible situation.
And because people around the
world were also willing to do this,
the situation in Cambodia im
proved.
Since then Iran, Afghanistan,
the draft and the presidential
elections have almost completely
obliterated interest in the situa
tion in Cambodia, so much so
that probably only a small per
centage of students here are
aware of Cambodia's serious im
pending problems. I'm not sure
why we allow ourselves to have
our attention diverted so easily
— perhaps we have some per
verse need for "newness," or
maybe we simply want to avoid
the costly sacrifice that long
term commitment to a person or
situation involves. I don't know.
Whatever the case, the Cam
bodian people still need us.
Though they are probably no
longer in danger of being wiped
out as a race, they are still vul
nerable to a massive famine
sometime later this year. Of
course, many are still starving
every day, but unless 200,000
tons of additional food and
40,000 tons of pesticides and
seeds reach Cambodia-within the
next six to eight months, hun
dreds of thousands may perish in

a renewed famine.
Students here can help the
most by contributing money to
the many relief agencies helping
out in Cambodia, including Ox
fam. Red Cross and World Vis
ion. Letting friends know about
the continuing need there can
also be of great importance.
However you go about it, please
don't let your attention waver.
After so much progress, let's not
allow the survivors to die of neg
lect.

Secretary enjoys day
I feel that 1 must reply to the
vitriolic article written by Natalie
Fisher (Daily, Apr. 22).
When I graduated from secre
tarial school (which at that time
entailed two years of study — not
just a couple of courses in the
evening), I was handed my dip
loma. After reading it over care
fully 1 cannot find a single men
tion of the fact that 1 am entitled
to, yes even due, a day of recog
nition for performing the tasks I
trained for and do with pride.
National Secretary's Day does
not rank right up there with
Mother's Day, Father's Day,
Christmas or even the Fourth of
July for national celebration as
far as 1 am concerned. As a mat
ter of fact, 1 truly feel that
homemakers (or "household en
gineers") deserve a day of rec
ognition before I do.
I receive my reward in know
ing that the people I work with
and for are having their needs
met, and that I am fulfilling the
promise I made to them when
they hired me — namely that I
was qualified, capable and com
petent. They, in turn, treat me
with dignity and respect, and
twice a month I get a paycheck
for tangible evidence that I have
met my obligations.
I am weary of hearing that all
that is wrong with any office is
the money that is spent in run
ning it and that the way to get rid
of arty strife — long hours, de
manding personalities, pressing
deadlines — is to simply pay the
people more. That simply is not
true. TheTe will always be good

and bad employers just as there
will always be competent and in
competent employees.
I, for one, have enjoyed the
flowers and the luncheon this
week. It was made more special
by the fact it encompassed not
only the secretaries but all of the
clerical support staff in my office.
I am delighted that our super
visors and managers have taken
time out of their overcrowded
and impossible schedules to de
vote the time to make us feel ap
preciated over and above their
routine, normal smiles and
"Thanks a lot" that we always
get.

Apology offered
In my last column (Daily, Apr.
16), I presented a criticism of
Libertarian proposals and be
liefs. Unfortunately, I also in
dulged in a rather nasty attack on
the character of the Libertarians
themselves. For this, I would like
to offer the Libertarians an un
solicited apology.
I believe that the Libertarian
party reforms would have some
miserable consequences. But I
should not have implied that the
Libertarians would gladly trade
the oppression of others for their
own freedom. Their goals are
more noble than that.
The problem was that I could
not reconcile our profoundly dif
ferent views of society with the
idea that they and I both want a
better world.
I regret having attacked the
Libertarian character. It was un
necessary and unjust.

Pass solar ordinance
Although President Jimmy
Carter's administration insists on
pursuing an energy policy based
on synthetic fuels and nuclear
energy, we in Santa Clara
County have an opportunity to
help implement a more rational
solution to the energy crisis, a
program based on conservation
and decentralized, renewable
energy sources.

The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors is in the
process of voting on a series of
solar and energy conservation
ordinances. They have already
passed an energy conservation
ordinance (requiring pre-1975
housing to be retrofitted to
minimum state energy conserva
tion standards upon resale)and a
solar-access ordinance for new
subdivisions.
On May 5 they will be voting
on a solar hot water ordinance.
This would require installation
of solar water heaters for new
residences (single and multi
family) starting Oct. 1,1980, and
the retrofit of solar water heaters
on existing dwellings at time of
resale, starting two years later.
An ordinance prohibiting the use '
of natural gas to heat residential
swimming pools is yet to be
scheduled for hearings.
Although the ordinances
apply only to the unincorporated
area of the county (the only area

over which the supervisors have
jurisdiction), they can have a
substantial impact through their
example to local cities and to
other counties in the state.
It is regrettable that the Stan
ford Campus Homeowners As
sociation has come out against all
the ordinances, a decision made
by the board without any input
or vote of the homeowners
themselves'.
We are reminded daily that
our nation's addiction to non
renewable energy sources has
disastrous consequences for our
economy ;ind for world peace.
By taking effective steps now. we
can provide for our energy needs
without resorting to economi
cally unsound and ecologically
ruinous technologies.

Buckley admirable
Recent polls tell us that as
many as 80 percent of Ameri

cans believe we are in "deep,
serious trouble." This is after de
cades of Democratic congres
sional rule, with mushrooming
government, unbalanced
budgets and runaway spending.
William F. Buckley in his ap
pearance here on April 7th tried
to underscore these evident con
tributors to our inflation and
general national weakness and to
demonstrate that soaking the
rich won't do much to alleviate
the basic ills of our society.
Buckley suggests that we give
up our faith in federal magic,
"funny money" and Utopian
schemes. He's been saying this
for years.
For his pains he gets called
among other things "cynical"
and "blasphemous" by Rev.
Don Caughey, assistant dean of
the chapel (Daily, April 15).
who, having espoused the mys
tique that brought us to the edge
of collapse, now proposes we
give it a second chance, headed

no doubt by that intellectual and
moral giant. Sen. Edward Ken
nedy.
Sorry, Reverend. The times
they are a-changing. Some
realities, such as global shortages
and Soviet or Iranian ruthless
ness, have become too plain to
ignore. To be on the side of in
dulgence and fantasy is not
necessarily to be tin the side of
humans, even poor ones.
As for Buckley, your resentful
attack does you no honor, him no
harm. I have never met anyone
more admirable for intellect,
knowledge, talent, eloquence,
wit and dedication. But what
strikes me most of all about him
is his wonderfully warm and
generous nature, the very oppo
site of cynical.
Buckley blasphemous? To

Apology offered
In my last column (Daily, Apr.
16), I presented a criticism of
Libertarian proposals and be
liefs. Unfortunately, I also in
dulged in a rather nasty attack on
the character of the Libertarians
themselves. For this, I would like
to offer the Libertarians an un
solicited apology.
I believe that the Libertarian
party reforms would have some
miserable consequences. But I
should not have implied that the
Libertarians would gladly trade
the oppression of others for their
own freedom. Their goals are
more noble than that.
The problem was that I could
not reconcile our profoundly dif

idea that they and I both want a
better world.
I regret having attacked the
Libertarian character. It was un

Pass solar ordinance
Although President Jimmy
Carter's administration insists on
pursuing an energy policy based
on synthetic fuels and nuclear
energy, we in Santa Clara
County have an opportunity to
help implement a more rational
solution to the energy crisis, a
program based on conservation
and decentralized, renewable
energy sources.

The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors is in the
process of voting on a series of
solar and energy conservation
ordinances. They have already
passed an energy conservation
ordinance (requiring pre-1975
housing to be retrofitted to
minimum state energy conserva
tion standards upon resale)and a
solar-access ordinance for new
subdivisions.
On May 5 they will be voting
on a solar hot water ordinance.
This would require installation
of solar water heaters for new
residences (single and multi
family) starting Oct. 1,1980, and
the retrofit of solar water heaters
on existing dwellings at time of
resale, starting two years later.
An ordinance prohibiting the use '
of natural gas to heat residential
swimming pools is yet to be
scheduled for hearings.
Although the ordinances
apply only to the unincorporated
area of the county (the only area

over which the supervisors have
jurisdiction), they can have a
substantial impact through their
example to local cities and to
other counties in the state.
It is regrettable that the Stan
ford Campus Homeowners As
sociation has come out against all
the ordinances, a decision made
by the board without any input
or vote of the homeowners
themselves'.
We are reminded daily that
our nation's addiction to non
renewable energy sources has
disastrous consequences for our
economy ;ind for world peace.
By taking effective steps now. we
can provide for our energy needs
without resorting to economi
cally unsound and ecologically
ruinous technologies.

Recent polls tell us that as
many as 80 percent of Ameri

serious trouble." This is after de
cades of Democratic congres
sional rule, with mushrooming
government, unbalanced
budgets and runaway spending.
William F. Buckley in his ap
pearance here on April 7th tried
to underscore these evident con
tributors to our inflation and
general national weakness and to
demonstrate that soaking the
rich won't do much to alleviate
the basic ills of our society.
Buckley suggests that we give
up our faith in federal magic,
"funny money" and Utopian
schemes. He's been saying this
for years.
For his pains he gets called
among other things "cynical"
and "blasphemous" by Rev.
Don Caughey, assistant dean of
the chapel (Daily, April 15).

Sorry, Reverend. The times

realities, such as global shortages

necessarily to be tin the side of

As for Buckley, your resentful

Hunger in Cambodia
I suppose forgetfulness isn't
very notable; it's about as un
usual as breathing for most of us.
Just about anything we're capa
ble of thinking or perceiving is
vulnerable to getting lost in our
heads — presidents forget
pledges, singers forget songs and
men forget their Maker.
Recent "world shattering"
events have been obscured by a
multitude of other global pro
lems that seem to spring up out
of nowhere. The result is that
these events stay in our con
sciousness about as long as a
moderate case of the flu.
No doubt the Cambodian
people have been the most re
cent, and perhaps the most sur
prising, example of our memory
difficulties. I remember the in
dignation of many at the Univer
sity over the Cambodian war and
famine; comparisons with the
Holocaust were common and
students were willing to contri
bute both time and money to
help ease the terrible situation.
And because people around the
world were also willing to do this,
the situation in Cambodia im
proved.
Since then Iran, Afghanistan,
the draft and the presidential
elections have almost completely
obliterated interest in the situa
tion in Cambodia, so much so
that probably only a small per
centage of students here are
aware of Cambodia's serious im
pending problems. I'm not sure
why we allow ourselves to have
our attention diverted so easily
— perhaps we have some per
verse need for "newness," or
maybe we simply want to avoid
the costly sacrifice that long
term commitment to a person or
situation involves. I don't know.
Whatever the case, the Cam
bodian people still need us.
Though they are probably no
longer in danger of being wiped
out as a race, they are still vul
nerable to a massive famine
sometime later this year. Of
course, many are still starving
every day, but unless 200,000
tons of additional food and
40,000 tons of pesticides and
seeds reach Cambodia-within the
next six to eight months, hun
dreds of thousands may perish in

a renewed famine.
Students here can help the
most by contributing money to
the many relief agencies helping
out in Cambodia, including Ox
fam. Red Cross and World Vis
ion. Letting friends know about
the continuing need there can
also be of great importance.
However you go about it, please
don't let your attention waver.
After so much progress, let's not
allow the survivors to die of neg
lect.

Recent polls tell us that as
many as 80 percent of Ameri

William F. Buckley in his ap
pearance here on April 7th tried
to underscore these evident con
tributors to our inflation and
general national weakness and to
demonstrate that soaking the
rich won't do much to alleviate
the basic ills of our society.
Buckley suggests that we give
up our faith in federal magic,
"funny money" and Utopian
schemes. He's been saying this
for years.
For his pains he gets called
among other things "cynical"
and "blasphemous" by Rev.

Sorry, Reverend. The times
they are a-changing. Some
realities, such as global shortages
and Soviet or Iranian ruthless
ness, have become too plain to
ignore. To be on the side of in

necessarily to be tin the side of
humans, even poor ones.
As for Buckley, your resentful
attack does you no honor, him no

more admirable for intellect,
knowledge, talent, eloquence,

strikes me most of all about him
is his wonderfully warm and

Hunger in Cambodia
I suppose forgetfulness isn't
very notable; it's about as un
usual as breathing for most of us.
Just about anything we're capa
ble of thinking or perceiving is
vulnerable to getting lost in our
heads — presidents forget
pledges, singers forget songs and
men forget their Maker.
Recent "world shattering"
events have been obscured by a
multitude of other global pro
lems that seem to spring up out
of nowhere. The result is that
these events stay in our con
sciousness about as long as a
moderate case of the flu.
No doubt the Cambodian
people have been the most re
cent, and perhaps the most sur
prising, example of our memory
difficulties. I remember the in
dignation of many at the Univer
sity over the Cambodian war and
famine; comparisons with the
Holocaust were common and
students were willing to contri
bute both time and money to
help ease the terrible situation.
And because people around the
world were also willing to do this,
the situation in Cambodia im
proved.
Since then Iran, Afghanistan,
the draft and the presidential
elections have almost completely
obliterated interest in the situa
tion in Cambodia, so much so
that probably only a small per
centage of students here are
aware of Cambodia's serious im
pending problems. I'm not sure
why we allow ourselves to have
our attention diverted so easily
— perhaps we have some per
verse need for "newness," or
maybe we simply want to avoid
the costly sacrifice that long
term commitment to a person or
situation involves. I don't know.
Whatever the case, the Cam
bodian people still need us.
Though they are probably no
longer in danger of being wiped
out as a race, they are still vul
nerable to a massive famine
sometime later this year. Of
course, many are still starving
every day, but unless 200,000
tons of additional food and
40,000 tons of pesticides and
seeds reach Cambodia-within the
next six to eight months, hun
dreds of thousands may perish in

a renewed famine.
Students here can help the
most by contributing money to
the many relief agencies helping
out in Cambodia, including Ox
fam. Red Cross and World Vis
ion. Letting friends know about
the continuing need there can
also be of great importance.
However you go about it, please
don't let your attention waver.
After so much progress, let's not
allow the survivors to die of neg
lect.

Secretary enjoys day
I feel that 1 must reply to the
vitriolic article written by Natalie
Fisher (Daily, Apr. 22).
When I graduated from secre
tarial school (which at that time
entailed two years of study — not
just a couple of courses in the
evening), I was handed my dip
loma. After reading it over care
fully 1 cannot find a single men
tion of the fact that 1 am entitled
to, yes even due, a day of recog
nition for performing the tasks I
trained for and do with pride.
National Secretary's Day does
not rank right up there with
Mother's Day, Father's Day,
Christmas or even the Fourth of
July for national celebration as
far as 1 am concerned. As a mat
ter of fact, 1 truly feel that
homemakers (or "household en
gineers") deserve a day of rec
ognition before I do.
I receive my reward in know
ing that the people I work with
and for are having their needs
met, and that I am fulfilling the
promise I made to them when
they hired me — namely that I
was qualified, capable and com
petent. They, in turn, treat me
with dignity and respect, and
twice a month I get a paycheck
for tangible evidence that I have
met my obligations.
I am weary of hearing that all
that is wrong with any office is
the money that is spent in run
ning it and that the way to get rid
of arty strife — long hours, de
manding personalities, pressing
deadlines — is to simply pay the
people more. That simply is not
true. TheTe will always be good

and bad employers just as there
will always be competent and in
competent employees.
I, for one, have enjoyed the
flowers and the luncheon this
week. It was made more special
by the fact it encompassed not
only the secretaries but all of the
clerical support staff in my office.
I am delighted that our super
visors and managers have taken
time out of their overcrowded
and impossible schedules to de
vote the time to make us feel ap
preciated over and above their
routine, normal smiles and
"Thanks a lot" that we always
get.

Apology offered
In my last column (Daily, Apr.
16), I presented a criticism of
Libertarian proposals and be
liefs. Unfortunately, I also in
dulged in a rather nasty attack on
the character of the Libertarians
themselves. For this, I would like
to offer the Libertarians an un
solicited apology.
I believe that the Libertarian
party reforms would have some
miserable consequences. But I
should not have implied that the
Libertarians would gladly trade
the oppression of others for their
own freedom. Their goals are
more noble than that.
The problem was that I could
not reconcile our profoundly dif
ferent views of society with the
idea that they and I both want a
better world.
I regret having attacked the
Libertarian character. It was un
necessary and unjust.

Pass solar ordinance
Although President Jimmy
Carter's administration insists on
pursuing an energy policy based
on synthetic fuels and nuclear
energy, we in Santa Clara
County have an opportunity to
help implement a more rational
solution to the energy crisis, a
program based on conservation
and decentralized, renewable
energy sources.

The Santa Clara County
Board of Supervisors is in the
process of voting on a series of
solar and energy conservation
ordinances. They have already
passed an energy conservation
ordinance (requiring pre-1975
housing to be retrofitted to
minimum state energy conserva
tion standards upon resale)and a
solar-access ordinance for new
subdivisions.
On May 5 they will be voting
on a solar hot water ordinance.
This would require installation
of solar water heaters for new
residences (single and multi
family) starting Oct. 1,1980, and
the retrofit of solar water heaters
on existing dwellings at time of
resale, starting two years later.
An ordinance prohibiting the use '
of natural gas to heat residential
swimming pools is yet to be
scheduled for hearings.
Although the ordinances
apply only to the unincorporated
area of the county (the only area

over which the supervisors have
jurisdiction), they can have a
substantial impact through their
example to local cities and to
other counties in the state.
It is regrettable that the Stan
ford Campus Homeowners As
sociation has come out against all
the ordinances, a decision made
by the board without any input
or vote of the homeowners
themselves'.
We are reminded daily that
our nation's addiction to non
renewable energy sources has
disastrous consequences for our
economy ;ind for world peace.
By taking effective steps now. we
can provide for our energy needs
without resorting to economi
cally unsound and ecologically
