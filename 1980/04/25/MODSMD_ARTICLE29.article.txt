## Draw, then state your preferences 
### 
The Draw is usually regarded
as a process by which space in
buildings is allocated among stu
dents. A better approach would
be to regard it as a way of form
ing communities of people. This
approach clarifies some issues
and leaves more hope for im
proved quality ot life ,1 the resi
dences.
Clearly there is a need for new
buildings, but rather than be
coming frustrated with the slow
progress on this front, we can di
rect our energy and imagination
toward improving satisfaction
with the lifestyles, activities and
relationships in the present resi
dences. The idea is to structure
the Draw so that students can
choose the kinds of communities
that they will most enjoy li\ ing in
rather than overemphasizing
walls, floors and food.
Returning resident and spec
cial priorities are crucial to pro
viding continuity, and they pro
vide a way for students to get a
feel for what the community
might be like beyond the impres
sion gained by just looking at the
building.

Descriptions of Row houses in
the Draw book also help to set
the atmosphere for a house and
attract those who are interested
in the kinds of lifestyles and ac
tivities that are described. The
policy of only including descrip
tions of whole dorms instead of
the individual houses it! ■
fleets an attitude that ui
ings count and houses in the
dorms are pretty much the same.
Hie added cost of publishing
individual descriptions would be
small compared to the impor
tance of allowing students to
choose the kind of community in
which they want to live. In addi
tion, the process of writing the
descriptions could provide an
opportunity for residents to dis
cuss the character of their houses
and ways of improving them.
Looking at the raw system
as a way of forming communities
points out the drawbacks of
proposals to give preferences
based on class rankings or in
come. These would restrict an
important aspect of life at Stan
ford by limiting opportunities to
get to know people of different
backgrounds and experiences,
since they would tend to create
concentrations of students of
similar social status in the same
houses.
Under a seniority system, re
sidences would be likely to fill
with students from a new class
each year, with seniors concen
trated in the most popular places
and sophomores in the less de
sirable residences. This would
reduce continuity in the houses
and impede sharing of experi
ences between the classes.
A free market for houses or
Draw numbers would allow those
with wealthy parents or

academic programs that allow
extra time for paid work to buy
their way into the more popular
houses, creating itilicaion
without the traditional benefits
of the free market system. Incen
tives for students to do extra paid
work are not necessary here and,
in'" 112 University housing,
the l>raw provides a system of
distribution that is both fairer
and more conducive to under
standing between people of dif
ferent backgrounds.
Emphasis on the individual
characteristics of each of the
houses on campus would provide
a wide choice of living com
munities. But who has spat 1 on
the Draw card for distinguishing
between Loro and Mirlo when
there's a possibility of drawing
under 100 and needing to decide
between 558 and Lambda Nu? If
you only knew ahead of time that
you could draw >500. you could
pay a visit to the dorm.sand find
out about the houses there in
stead of spending a lot ol time
and energy visitin the most
popular Rum. hou es arid then
being disappointed at a poor
number.
The solution? Draw your
number when you pick up your
Draw card instead of when you
turn it in. The Draw could be held
at Tresidder much as it is now
except that it would be about a
week earlier and would allow
students to know their numbers
before getting priorities and staU
ing their preferences. Cards
could be turned in where they
are presently picked up.
One reason this is not the pre
sent policy is fear that students
would try to outguess the system
and make choices based on
criteria other than actual prefer

ences. Yet students already
make choices based on expecta
tions about what the system will
do. Reducing the uncertainty
would be a tremendous help to
rational decision making. Re
moving the necessity of con
tingency planning for all different
Draw numbers would make de
ciding which preferences to put
down infinitely less complex and
would allow students to concen
trate on finding out about com
munities they might be able to
get into, rather than touring
every building in the system
It would somehow be
psychologically more satisfying
to draw 4000. \isit the Stem
houses and get the ie ou * m
rather than putti iga lot ■ >t effort
into tou 11 -est places on: \
to have ii ht pes and dreams
smashed hv h.id Draw number.
But it could also make a very real
difference it knowing your
number led you to seek out
friends with whom to spend i
year in Man/ar>ta oi >.11rn i:s.
or le\i you to t.'V ie trout
get .irst priority ;re it
make the difference regarditss
of your number.
Most importantly, a policy of
publishing descriptions of all the
houses and choosing Draw num
bers at the beginning of the pro
cess might lead to more interest
in the individual houses and pro
vide a way for students to choose
the kind of residential experi
ence they want. Perhaps it would
even encourage people to shape
their communities to meet their
expectations.
