# New dormitory to heat up with solar power system
## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
A solar energy system will be used to
heat water in the new dormitory here.
University officials said this week.
The decision to use solar power came
after a student committee found origi
nal cost estimates tor installation of a
solar system were at least fivi time t o
high. The new estimates make install.i
tion of solar units economically feasi
ble, the officials said.
Though the solar heating svstem may
not he installed in the initial phases ot
project construction, the building will
be designed so eventually it may house
the solar equipment, according to
Robert Nerrie, project manager ol the
new student housing project.
"The question is not il we will do it,
hut when we will dw it.' he said.
"Studies will determine at what point it
is most economically feasible to install
the system."
The student committee estimated
the installation cost at about $720,000,
while the University's architectural re
search firm. Building Systems De

velopment. estimated installation cost
it between 5.<.5 and $N million.
According to the student projec
tions completed h\ Stanford Pnergy
Action (SPA), the solar system will
have paid for itself live years after ini
tial installation
Alter six years, the I diversity would
be sav ing money if solar water heating
is compared t.> conventional electrical
or gas power methods ol heating the
water. Die student group's projections
indicate a net cash benefit of $268,275
at the end ol the first I 0 years of opera
tion.
According to Nerrie. the project ar
chitects have requested that funds to
cover the lull cost til installing the solar
system be added to their $23 million
budget.
The architects said thÂ«_v plan to de
sign the building to accommodate solar
heating, now that the I nivcrsity had
decided solar power is feasible.
Christopher Arnold, a spokesman
tor the architectural consulting firm,
said passi\e (non-mechanical) solar
design will be utilized as much as possi
ble. including use ol shade awnings and

glass windows to collect as much heat
as possible in the winter.
Arnold admitted the firm had mis
calculated the preliminary figures foi
solai heating installation. The resear
chers assumed one square foot of col
lector space heats two gallons ot watet.
but perfoinied the calculations as il one
square foot heats only one-half a gallon
of water.
Accordingly, the firm's total pre
liminary figure was about four times

greater than it should have been.
The preliminary cost figure was esca
lated further when the research firm
estimated students use 75 gallons ot
hot water a day when, according to
SPA. students here actually use no
more than 25 gallons a day.
Another contributor to the high es
timate was the architect's assumption
that students do laundry every day. 1 he
firm also calculated that from 25 to 4 1
gallons of water are used for a shower.

"That figure is absurd by any mea
sure." said Jonathon Raab of SEA.
Raab added the I niversity i> afraid
of the technology of solar energy. and is
not "looking at solar very effectively.
Net another factor in the considera
tion of solar hot water heating for the
new dorm project is a proposed ordi
nance that would requjre all new resi
dence construction in Santa Clara
county to utilize solar energy methods.
