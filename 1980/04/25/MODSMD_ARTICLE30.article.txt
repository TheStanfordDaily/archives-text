## Make changes in the system 
### 
Knowing I had been one of the lucky 15 percent
of applicants who got into Stanford, I was equally
confident I would draw in the 700s or better. What
a shock, what dismal reality to draw 3249 and be
faced with Siberia. At that moment (how odd) I
saw the light: The system's not fair. (1 couldn't rig
it.) Therefore, be it resolved:
1) That, while Returning Residence Priority is
great. Fresh Face Priority should be even greater.
A system in which a woman draws 0014 and has no
hope of getting into 558 Mayfield has something
wrong with it. I propose that no more than, say, 15
percent of a house's population consist of re turning
residents (determined, ot course, by Draw
number).
In the case of this year's Storey disaster, a few
individual exceptions might be made, but for the
rest of the women. Returning Resident Priority

should have gone up with the house. They were
lucky to get into Storey in the first place â€” no need
to reward (?) them with 558.
2) That before determining "the assignable
pool," 5000 should be added to every unguaran
teed student's draw number. Such people should
be entitled simply to shelter on campus, not the
luxury of a number one choice.
3) That the University construct the planned
undergraduate residence facilities bv the time my
unguaranteed year rolls around.
Selfish? Yes.'
Greedy? Yes!
Fair? Eminently!
Subject to change when 1 make it into Alpha Sig?
Of course!
