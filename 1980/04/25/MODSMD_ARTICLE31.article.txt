# BUG ME
## 
### 
Been a real nice week, hasn't it? Well, when all
else tails, there's always Hug Me. I have two ques
tions this week about Lake Lagunita:
Dearest Hug Me,
If you have been strolling around the lake you
have noticed that many trees have been cut down
and the area has been generally cleaned up. As a
resident of Lagunita with a lake-view room, I can't
complain about my improved view; in fact, I'm
grateful for it. My question is, why did the University
decide to cut down the trees? How much did it cost?
Now that the University has cleaned up the lake, are
they going to keep out those that dirty the urea
(typically area high school students)? Thanks.

Dear Rug,
It appears that Luke Lug is being drained! In
February it was full, but now the level is lowering.
Isn't it usually left full until June?
K.M.P.
Don't panic or drop out of your sailing class, the
lake is not being drained. The water level is cer
tainly lower than it was in February, but the only
culprit involved is Mother Nature. 1 he lake is tilled
by the overflow from Searsville and I• cl l l akes.
When there's a lot of rain, there's a lot of overflow.
When the weather gets nice, however. Lake
Lagunita not only stops receiving water.it begins to
lose it. Besides evaporation, the lake loses a lot«>1
water through"seepage into its porous bed.
No small loss, this. Of its capacity I IN million
gallons. Lake Lag can lose over one million gallons
of water a day. For those of you who can't picture
one million gallons, think of it this way: the lake's
water level can drop by as much as two inches a day
from this seepage and evaporation.
The lake is not actively drained until June, as
K.M.P. believed, at which time pipes are opened to
speed nature along.
Now back to the lirst question. There are trees

being cut down all over campus right now as part of
a general safely plan (the wind has dropped a few
branches on cars recently). But the clean-up
around the lake is a separate project.
I'he clean-up was mandated by the State Re
source Agency, which has jurisdiction over all the
state's water, according to water superintendent
Joe ( 'arrignton. State inspectors, who are out here
right now. need to be able to observe and inspect
the drainage of the lake and the ecosystem around
it. frees are being cut down, primarily along the
golf course-side of the lake, to prevent the chance
of a tree falling arfd tearing out the bank.
As for the cost of the project: "not bad at all,"
said Carrington. All that it involves is the labor. As
for keeping out the culprits who dirty the area,
that's impossible.
Besides, from what I can tell, some of the worst
offenders are students who live on the lake.
Here's a short but curious inquiry addressed to
my alter ego:
Hey rlease Me,
Where are all the "available" Stanford women?
Still Looking
Overseas.
Well, that's all for this week, and il I don't get
some more letters soon, that may be all for awhile.
Put down any thoughtful questions or questionable
thoughts you have and send them to me at The
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, 94305. Or save yourself the fifteen cents
and bring it by the Daily office.
I'll tackle just about any inquiry you put to me, as
you can see if you've read this column regularly.
But i! you ask about private individuals or families
around campus, I may not be able to give you a
public answer (some people don't like to see their
names on the pages of this hallowed journal). I lave
a nice weekend but don't read the next two
words . . .
