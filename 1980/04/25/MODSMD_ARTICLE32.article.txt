# Junk food disease hits teenagers
## 
### Victor Cohn The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — A new "junk food
disease," a kind of "marginal malnutrition"
almost akin to beriberi, is appearing in ado
lescents, according to a Cleveland Clinic
doctor.
Beriberi is a severe thiamin (vitamin B1)
deficiency seen in the Orient among people
who subsist on polished rice.
Twenty persons, mainly adolescents,
studied by Dr. Derrick Lonsdale at the
Cleveland medical center turned out to have
thiamin deficiencies linked in most cases, he
believes, to diets common among teen-agers.
The diets, he says, consisted almost en
tirely of high-calorie but often nutritionally
deficient, sugar-laden drinks, pastries,candy
and snack foods such as potato chips and
pretzels. They were supplemented, perhaps,
by some milk, sandwiches, frencli fries and
hamburgers. The diets included some pro
tein and other nutrients, but not as much as
fast growing bodies required.
Personality Change
Junk food eaters with thiamin deficiency
often undergo severe personality changes,
generally becoming highly aggressive and ir
ritable, Lonsdale says. Some suffer severe
abdominal or chest pains, as well as restless
ness, lack of sleep, night terrors and frighten
ing dreams.
Many doctors see such youngsters,
Lonsdale believes, but treat their symptoms
as behavior or psychiatric problems, or

sometimes give them drugs for supposed in
fections.
Lonsdale and Dr. Raymond Shambergber
report the Cleveland study in the American
Journal of Clinical Nutrition.
"We studied 20 persons biochemically,"
Lonsdale said in an interview, "but I've seen
many in the past few years. 1 think there are
probably a lot of them around. What these
kids were eating was a fairly average Ameri
can teen-age diet.
Snacks
"No breakfast. Maybe school lunch,
maybe not. But lots of doughnuts, snacks,
nibbles, washing it down with various colas
and such."
The Lonsdale diagnosis of thiamin defi
ciencv and marginal malnourishment is a
new and controversial one. Nutritionists and
biochemists disagreed last week on whether
it may exist in many adolescents.
Dr. Artemis Simopopulos at the National
Institutes of Health said the surveys gener
ally have found only a few common nutri
tional defects in adolescents. The most com
mon is iron-deficiency anemia in menstruat
ing girls on poor diets.
But some scientists called the Lonsdale
suggestion a provocative one that needs
more study before being called true or false.
Long overdue
Dr. Carroll Leevy of the New Jersey Medi
cal College — though disagreeing with much
that Lonsdale said — said in an editorial in

the nutrition journal that a 1967 study ot' 642
New York schoolchildren found low thiamin
blamed on diet in 6<X percent of black and 52
percent of white pupils.
In another editorial. Dr. Myron Brin of the
Roche Research Center in Nutley. N.J., a
leading thiamin authority, said "serious pub
lic health and medical attention to the ad
verse health effects of marginal vitamin defi
ciency" is "long overdue."
"We need to be very cautious about jump
ing to any conclusion about a B vitamin defi
ciency." said Dr. Audrey Cross, Agriculture
Department nutrition coordinator.
Forgotten (.roup
"But adolescents are really a forgotten
group. We do a lot of nutritional studies on
the infants and aging. But there's not a lot of
work on adolescents, the period of a huge
growth spurt."
She said she, too, worries about youngsters
who get their main nourishment from snacks
or last-food chains. "They may get animal
protein and carbohydrates and fats," she
said, but often no fruits or vegetables and, as
a milk source, "shakes" without much milk.
As for Lonsdale's patients, most have
slowly improved after changing their diets.
The frightening thing, he said, is that:"The
symptoms in all . . . were relatively trivial,
never life-threatening but nevertheless de
bilitating and extremely frustrating, since
many . . . had already received conventional
therapy . . . None of them or their parents
had the slightest notion that their symptoms
might be related to their diet."
