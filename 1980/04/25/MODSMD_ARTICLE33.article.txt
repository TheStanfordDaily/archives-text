## 
### Laine Ericson Staff Writer 
rhe Career Planning and
Placement Center (CPPC) will
sponsor the Second Annual
Stanford Job Faire today in
White Plaza.
The 6-hour program will begin
at 10 a.m.
Sixty companies, ranging from
the Boy Scouts to Rockwell In
ternational. will be represented
at the Faire. Charlenc Berry,
co-coordinator of the Faire,
explained that these organiza
tions "are not peddling jobs. It is
an information session for stu
dents thinking about career op
portunities to meet with
employment organizations."
1 lowever, added Debbie Dun
can, assistant to the director of
the CPPC and co-coordinator of
the program with Berry, some ot
the firms are looking for people.
Participation in the Job Faire
is on an invitation-only basis,
and Duncan said that some or
ganizations asked to be included
that the CPPC has had to turn
away. Berry explained that non
technical opportunities are em
phasized. although some techni
cal opportunities are em
phasized, although some techni
cal companies have been in
cluded. Berry said the campus
wide Job Faire is designed
"especially lor the undecided
liberal arts student."
Among those organizations
turned away numbered some

agencies that offer temporary
services because, said Duncan,
all of the employers who are in
cluded, offer full-time or sum
mer career opportunities.
Although most of the particip
ants in the 1980 Faire are located
in the Bay area. Berry said that
there are also nine from Los
Angeles and four from the East
Coast. Duncan noted that, "it'sa
compliment to Stanford students
that people come from all over."
She also cited public relations
benefits such as publicizing the
corporate name and talking to
students on the spot as reasons
for the employers' interest in the
Job F aire.

Student response to the Job
Faire has also been excellent ac
cording to Berry. She said that at
least 1000 students participated
last year, and that she expects a
turnout of about 1500 today.
Surveys also indicated that the
students benefitted from the
1979 Faire. A survey of graduat
ing seniors showed that some did
find jobs through the program,
and evaluations filled out di
rectly following last year's Faire
were very positive, according to
Berry.
Duncan said that one reason
for the popularity of the Job
Faire may be that 55 percent of
the class of 1979, or twice as

many as in 1 974. wanted to enter
the job market full-time im
mediately following graduation,
according to the results of the
annual senior survey conducted
by the Office of the Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies.
The Job laire is a result of a
brainstorming session investigat
ing ways to reach the needs of
more students at the August
197K CPPC staff retreat.
Work on today's program
began in November, and since
the initial mailing of invitations
in January, Duncan estimated
that the task has occupied half of
her work week.
