# ON CALL
## 
### 
Ho, hum. What a boring week . . . And to top it
off, my letter supply is quickly dwindling. So, I've
come up with a brilliant scheme to solve all our
problems. Since this is On Call, you may hence
forth call me (by telephone) on Monday and Wed
nesday afternoons at the Daily office, 497-4632.
You may still retain your anonymity, if so desired.
You'll just have to disguise your voice instead of
your handwriting.
I sometimes worry about my friends who drink
too much. When someone passes out at a party,
should / he concerned, or should I just allow the
person to sleep it off ?
-Auntie Em
II you have a good idea of how much alcohol
your friend has consumed and in what manner, you
should have a good indication of your appropriate
action in the situation you described. If the person
concerned has been chugging or has swallowed
close to a fifth of distilled spirits before losing con
sciousness, he or she probably should be taken to
the hospital's emergency room, according to doc
tors at Cowell Student Health Center.
For another test (my favorite word), try to rouse
the sleeping individual. You could sit the person
up, or poke and pinch a friend, or really abuse a
catatonic date. But, seriously, if you are able to
awaken the lush, there's probably no major crisis.
If. however, the sot withstands your pelting efforts
without lashing back, if his respiratory rate is slow
and if his skin is cold, you should locate medical
assistance immediately.
You know that funny hump you get on the third
finger of your writing hand? First of all, what is it?
Why does it get worse the more you write? Can it
cause cancer? Does anybody ever have theirs re
moved? If I stopped writing, would it go away and
for how long?
- Tumoral Scribe
I guess we've all been afflicted by this condition
since day one of first grade. The protruberance is a
hypertrophy of the skin, in medical lingo, and sim
ply a callous, in English. If extremely irritated, it
can develop into an overgrowth of the bone under
the skin.
The callous is indeed a use problem, caused by
vise-gripping your pencil or pen. If you gave up
writing for a significant period of time (I've never
tried it, and I don't think anyone's ever performed
any experiments on this issue, so I'm not sure of the

specific time commitment), the callous would dis
appear.
You could hire a stenographer, become am
bidextrous, or start typing exclusively (my solu
tion). or experiment with different sizes of pens.
Changing pen diameters might ease some of the
excess pressure you've been exerting when writing.
Finally. I couldn't find anyone who had ever
heard of removing the offending lump, nor of it
causing cancer or other hideous diseases.
Do you have any advice about how I can calm
down before interviews? I know it's good to be
slightly nervous, but I don't think my quivering
voice and shaking hands (before contact) impress
the interviewer.
- Jittery
Counselors at Counseling and Psychological
Services (CAPS), who have tons of experience in
interviewing, recommend that you practice inter
viewing a lot to put yourelf at ease and gain self
confidence. They said you should "decatas
trophize" yourself: take away the punch of the
event by reminding yourself that it's only one in
terview and not the only job in the world. Put the
interview in perspective, in other words.
You could also desensitize yourself and utilize a
rehearsal mechanism by anticipating the worst
eventuality of the interview and preparing for it.
Also, think of the interview as a bilateral experi
ence. Think in advance of the points you would like
to bring out and the questions you would like to
ask. You can put yourself in partial control of the
interview in this way.
Can I masturbate too much?
- Celibate
Dr. Vincent D'Andrea at CAPS replied affirma
tively to your question. Women, he said, should be
careful about irritation and swelling. "To young
men, my advice is to go slow." he said, because
excessive masturbation could interfere with your
sexual abilities. If you train your orgiastic reflex to
be overly quick, you could have premature ejacula
tion problems with a partner.
D'Andrea suggested that you read The Hite Re
port or Male Sexuality by Zilbergeld.
He concluded by reciting some grafitti he had
spied in the Law School bathroom:
"A sex life at Stanford is like a game of poker: If
you've got a good hand, you can get through the
game."
