# Spartans victorious in non-conference game
## Baseballers lose again; this time 5-3 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
The baseball ( '.tnlinals lost a heartbreaker
to San Jose State Wednesday. 5-3. their
fourth loss in a row. And with league-leading
\n/onu State coming to Sunken Diamond
for a three-game series opening this after
noon. the Cards are hoping that their luck
will change . . . and soon.
A two-run Spart .n honierun with two out
in the ninth spoiled C ardinal victory hopes
and left them with their fourth loss in the past
week. Spartan left tielder J.i> Daniels swat
ted the round tripper off Card reliever Lee
Cline in the top half of the inning and the
Cards were unable to respond in kind in theii
half of the inning.
But, said head coach Mark Marquess, the
team didn't play that poorly. "We should
have won and I'm disappointed that we
didn't win, but we didn't play that bad. And
that is what is so frustrating."
In that rescheduled game, the Cards were
plagued by the problems that have been stal
ling their winning attack all season. Defen
sively, walks, a wild pitch and a crucial error
in the first inning hurt. And. said Marquess,
"we're not getting the big hit."
C ardinal starter George Lope/gave up two
unearned runs in the very tirst inning in a
fashion that is becoming all too familiar to
the C arils ot late. The lead-off batter for the

Spartans reached second base on an error by
third baseman David Meier.
Hie next hitter sacrificed Jones to third
and he scored on an infield out. San Jose
State also pushed home another run that in
ning. Card pitching shut down the Spartans,
though, through the next six innings.
In the eighth inning. Steve Gallego sing
led. moved to second on a sacrifice, third on a
long fly and then scored on a Lee Cline wild
pitch to tie the score at three.
I lle Cards were all but shut down by San
Jose State through the first five. The only
score off Spartan starter John Tillema in
those innings was in the fifth. Paul Zuvella
doubled with two-outs and then scored on an
infield error on a ball hit by shortstop Dave
Meier.
Tillema was just too tough. In fact. Mar
quess reported, "he is one of the best we've
faced all year. He is the fastest thrower I've
seen since 1 came to Stanford. So we knew we
weren't going to score a lot of runs off him."
After the first, the Cards got strong pitch
ing from Lope/. Bob Boatman and Tim
Sherrell took the lead in the seventh with two
runs. Catcher Mike Freitas homered to start
the mini-rally. Center fielder Darryl
Stephens doubled and scored after a couple
of infield outs.
That lead was short-lived however. The
Spartans got one back the very next inning
oft Lee Cline. And then with two out in the

ninth, second baseman (iallego singled and
Daniels did his thing, pounding a C'line pitch
over the lence.
Said Marquess in evaluating the game,
"the error in the first hurt us. Lopez, Boat
man and Sherrell pitched well but 1 don't
think Lee was really sharp on Wednesday. It
I list wasn't a good outing for him. They (San
Jose State) lui him pretty hard."
Hitting the ball hard is what the Cardinals
will have to do it they are to take the Sun
Devils this weekend. The last time the two
teams met in Phoenix, the < irds were swept
in three. But Marquess thinks they have a
good shot at redeeming themselves at home.
"In Phoenix, besides the 34-2 game, we
should have won the next two. In both of
those last two games, we were ahead going
into the ninth inning but couldn't hold on,"
said the head coach.
1 le added the "players are not down about
the last week and will not be intimidated by
Arizona State. If we play well, we can beat
them."
And they're back at full strength. Dave
Meier's knee is near 100 percent and he will
move back to shortstop after playing third
base the last couple games. Larry Kuhn, the
Cardinal ace in the past, will get the starting
nod tomorrow, with Brian Mignano and
Boatman awaiting in the bull-pen.

week. Spartan left tielder J.i> Daniels swat
ted the round tripper off Card reliever Lee
Cline in the top half of the inning and the
Cards were unable to respond in kind in theii
half of the inning.
But, said head coach Mark Marquess, the
team didn't play that poorly. "We should
have won and I'm disappointed that we
didn't win, but we didn't play that bad. And
that is what is so frustrating."
In that rescheduled game, the Cards were
plagued by the problems that have been stal
ling their winning attack all season. Defen
sively, walks, a wild pitch and a crucial error
in the first inning hurt. And. said Marquess,
"we're not getting the big hit."
C ardinal starter George Lope/gave up two
unearned runs in the very tirst inning in a
fashion that is becoming all too familiar to
the C arils ot late. The lead-off batter for the

Spartans reached second base on an error by
third baseman David Meier.
Hie next hitter sacrificed Jones to third
and he scored on an infield out. San Jose
State also pushed home another run that in
ning. Card pitching shut down the Spartans,
though, through the next six innings.
In the eighth inning. Steve Gallego sing
led. moved to second on a sacrifice, third on a
long fly and then scored on a Lee Cline wild
pitch to tie the score at three.
I lle Cards were all but shut down by San
Jose State through the first five. The only
score off Spartan starter John Tillema in
those innings was in the fifth. Paul Zuvella
doubled with two-outs and then scored on an
infield error on a ball hit by shortstop Dave
Meier.
Tillema was just too tough. In fact. Mar
quess reported, "he is one of the best we've
faced all year. He is the fastest thrower I've
seen since 1 came to Stanford. So we knew we
weren't going to score a lot of runs off him."
After the first, the Cards got strong pitch
ing from Lope/. Bob Boatman and Tim
Sherrell took the lead in the seventh with two
runs. Catcher Mike Freitas homered to start
the mini-rally. Center fielder Darryl
Stephens doubled and scored after a couple
of infield outs.
That lead was short-lived however. The
Spartans got one back the very next inning
oft Lee Cline. And then with two out in the

ninth, second baseman (iallego singled and
Daniels did his thing, pounding a C'line pitch
over the lence.
Said Marquess in evaluating the game,
"the error in the first hurt us. Lopez, Boat
man and Sherrell pitched well but 1 don't
think Lee was really sharp on Wednesday. It
I list wasn't a good outing for him. They (San
Jose State) lui him pretty hard."
Hitting the ball hard is what the Cardinals
will have to do it they are to take the Sun
Devils this weekend. The last time the two
teams met in Phoenix, the < irds were swept
in three. But Marquess thinks they have a
good shot at redeeming themselves at home.
"In Phoenix, besides the 34-2 game, we
should have won the next two. In both of
those last two games, we were ahead going
into the ninth inning but couldn't hold on,"
said the head coach.
1 le added the "players are not down about
the last week and will not be intimidated by
Arizona State. If we play well, we can beat
them."
And they're back at full strength. Dave
Meier's knee is near 100 percent and he will
move back to shortstop after playing third
base the last couple games. Larry Kuhn, the
Cardinal ace in the past, will get the starting
nod tomorrow, with Brian Mignano and
Boatman awaiting in the bull-pen.
