# The 						Friday Feature-Alycia Moulton
## 
### Sally Jenkins Staff Writer 
Alycia Mouiton is an aggres
sive tennis player, yet quiet off
the court. She loves being a stu
dent hut dislikes studying tennis;
she has a motivation problem yet
wishes to become a pro, and it is
often difficult to tell whether she
has won or lost a match when it's
over. In short, Mouiton doesn't
much like tennis, but she loves
playing it.
Mouiton picked up tennis
when she was 10 years old. occa
sional!) sneaking a set when she
wasn't swimming competitively
at a local club in Sacramento.
Her parents had very little to do
with entering her into competi
tion, yet they had almost every
thing to do with making it easier
for her to play, and it is rare that
her mother misses a match in the
area.
One could hardly call Mouiton
a disciplined player. Her success
raises serious questions as to the
validity of certain training
methods that most people take
tor granted. She never runs, and
she eats anything and everything
whenever she likes, including be
fore a match.
'"I've never had a routine, like
getting up at the same time every
morning and eating the same
thing for breakfast." Mouiton
said. "I'm not that in anything I
do. I can't do the same thing
everyday." Nevertheless, Moui
ton has never taken an extended
period of time off from tennis.
She says she often wants to take a
break, but "it gets old after a
week."
What physical discipline she
does have probably comes from
10 years of ballet training. This
manifests itself in her fluid
movement on the court, as well
as her quickness. "It definitely
helps on the court." she said.

" Fhe discipline helps too, espe
cially in terms of muscle condi
tioningand things like that." The
ballet seems to be an advantage
off the court as well: according to
her friends, Mouiton is a great
dancer. "Let's just say that if she
could jive as much on the court
as she does off, she'd be unbeat
able," one friend and teammate
/laughed.
Mouiton does not like talking
about her tennis oft the court and
is rarely able to read»about her
self. According to her room
mates. she reacts in virtually the
same way whether she wins or
loses. "One time she came back
from a tournament and we asked
her how she did. She just said she
did fine until she got to the fi
nals," one roommate said. The
fact is that Mouiton has won
some of the most impressive
amateur tournaments in the
world. She won the Junior U.S.
Open this year and managed to
last two rounds in the profes
sional Open until she was beaten
by Martina Navritilova. F.\en so.
her friends had a hard time per
suading her to stay the evening
and celebrate.
Mouiton is the last one to be
impressed with her talent and is
impatient with those who are,
though she agrees that it is to be
expected. She contends that it is
easier to play Navritilova than it
is to play the juniors. "Of course
it's scary, and you freeze up," she
asserts. "But you play better be
cause you don't have anything to
worry about; in the juniors you
worry about your rankings and
things like that."
Mouiton doesn't appear to
worry about much ofanythingon
the court. When she loses she
puts it out of her mind almost
immediately, not thinking about
the match until at least a day af
terwards. "I recuperate very

quickly," she laughed. "1 don't
sit down and say,'Oh, did I blow
that one.' " Nor does Mouiton
ever psyche herself up or think
about a match before she plays it.
In fact, she doesn't do anything
at all. More often than not she
simply sits in the stands with a
few friends until it is time to
warm up. She does have one
small problem, though. She can't
listen to music before she plays,
because it will run through her
mind and disturb her concentra
tion.
Mouiton's method of concent
ration is one of her major
peculiarities. She does not know

what she thinks about on the
court. Many times she has come
off the court not knowing what
the score was, nor can she re
member specific shots or mo
ments.' It's amazing. You would
think that it I were really concen
trating, 1 would know the score,
hut 1 just don't concentrate that
way. I know when I'm ahead and
when I'm behind. Most people
can remember when they won
their serve, when they lost it, but
I can't, 1 just don't," she said.
When she loses it is usually be
cause she is not serving well. She
plays a hard hitting, fast game.

primarily because she is impa
tient. Rather than wait for her
opponent to make a mistake, she
prefers to put the ball away and
win the point outright. "1 don't
think 1 will ever be able to stay on
the baseline and wait for them to
miss. 1 won't win any points that
way; if I do. well it will be be
cause I am serving and \olleyihg
well." she asserted.
As a result, she plays better
when she is angry. Which is for
tunate, because she does not like
tennis players as a breed, exclud
ing Stanford players ot course.
Anger improves her ser\ e. which
in turn improves her game
whole. "If 1 get angry before a
match and I find something I
don't like about the person I'm
playing, it helps a lot." she com
mented. "I don't like that many
tennis players. 1 don't have any
close tennis-playing friends; 1
don't think I really like any of
them very much. I'm not talking
about at Stanford." she added
hastily. Thus, playing someone
she likes has never been a prob
lem for her.
Mary Lou Piatek of Trinity
was her opponent in the finals of
both the Junior L'.S. Open and
Junior Wimbledon tournaments.
Piatek has been called one of
Moulton's closest friends on the
tour. Before the Open, an article
was printed asserting this as well
as a picture of the two shaking

hands with the caption, "It's
hard to beat your friend." Piatek
and Moulton stayed in the same
room and warmed up together
before the match. Moulton
laughs about all of this out loud
because the two in fact have
never been friends. "1 don't
know where they got that; it's all
fabrication. We've never been
friends." she said. The truth is,
the two rarely spoke and the re
lationship could be classified as
more ambivalent than anything
else.
This dislike of tennis players is
extended to most other aspects
of the game sa\ e actual competi
tion. Moulton cannot stand to
read a tennis magazine, watch a
match on television or watch a
tournament that she is not com
peting in. "I think it's just be
cause 1 don't like to be a spec
tator, an observer. That's why I
leave if I'm at a tournament and I
lose. I'm outa there on the next
flight." she said.
If she has a major problem on
the court, it is her lack of motiva
tion. She is notorious as a come
from behind player largely be
cause she has to make herself
angry enough to play her best. "I
definitely have to get behind to
feel threatened It comes down
to extra motivation: they're win
ning and that's bad news."
Roommate and teammate
Lisa Gordon is almost awed by
her ability to come from behind
and win a match. "She has this
uncanny ability to play so damn
tough when she's down," Gor
don said. "She just pulls off un
believable matches. Against
B YU you knew she was going to
win. They'd have her down by

two match points and she would
come back and win," Gordon
continued. "I'd hate.to be on the
other side of the net if she's fired
up or mad. She's just unbeata
ble."
Regardless of her motiva
tional problem, Moulton be
lieves that she has the ambition
and drive to become a top pro
fessional player. The problem, if
any, will be her lack of patience.
"I like to succeed at what I'm
doing, and if I'm not 1 won't play
anymore competitively at all,"
she said. When she giaduates she
will turn pro, "just because
there's no reason not to."
Her desire to succeed carries
over into other areas. She is a
political science major and
though she has no career plans,
she wants a job where she
doesn't have too many people
above her. "1 want to be the
boss," she laughed.
The lifestyle of a pro tennis
player is one of the least appeal
ing things about the game to
Moulton. "Some people can get
into the travel and the being
around all the other athletes and
women tennis players all the
time. That totally bores me. It's
not interesting," she said simply.
Nevertheless, it's what she
wants to do, and she's quietly
confident that she will succeed.
"If I didn't think I could be in the
top 10 in the world, I wouldn't be
playing, I'd be doing something
else." Moulton appears to take
an extremely simplistic approach
to the game both on and off the
court and with regards to her
likes and dislikes. But the fact is,
her likes and dislikes about the
game remain at odds.

as she does off, she'd be unbeat
able," one friend and teammate
/laughed.
Mouiton does not like talking
about her tennis oft the court and
is rarely able to read»about her
self. According to her room
mates. she reacts in virtually the
same way whether she wins or
loses. "One time she came back
from a tournament and we asked
her how she did. She just said she
did fine until she got to the fi
nals," one roommate said. The
fact is that Mouiton has won
some of the most impressive
amateur tournaments in the
world. She won the Junior U.S.
Open this year and managed to
last two rounds in the profes
sional Open until she was beaten
by Martina Navritilova. F.\en so.
her friends had a hard time per
suading her to stay the evening
and celebrate.
Mouiton is the last one to be
impressed with her talent and is
impatient with those who are,
though she agrees that it is to be
expected. She contends that it is
easier to play Navritilova than it
is to play the juniors. "Of course
it's scary, and you freeze up," she
asserts. "But you play better be
cause you don't have anything to
worry about; in the juniors you
worry about your rankings and
things like that."
Mouiton doesn't appear to
worry about much ofanythingon
the court. When she loses she
puts it out of her mind almost
immediately, not thinking about
the match until at least a day af
terwards. "I recuperate very

quickly," she laughed. "1 don't
sit down and say,'Oh, did I blow
that one.' " Nor does Mouiton
ever psyche herself up or think
about a match before she plays it.
In fact, she doesn't do anything
at all. More often than not she
simply sits in the stands with a
few friends until it is time to
warm up. She does have one
small problem, though. She can't
listen to music before she plays,
because it will run through her
mind and disturb her concentra
tion.
Mouiton's method of concent
ration is one of her major
peculiarities. She does not know

what she thinks about on the
court. Many times she has come
off the court not knowing what
the score was, nor can she re
member specific shots or mo
ments.' It's amazing. You would
think that it I were really concen
trating, 1 would know the score,
hut 1 just don't concentrate that
way. I know when I'm ahead and
when I'm behind. Most people
can remember when they won
their serve, when they lost it, but
I can't, 1 just don't," she said.
When she loses it is usually be
cause she is not serving well. She
plays a hard hitting, fast game.


Alycia Moulton
primarily because she is impa
tient. Rather than wait for her
opponent to make a mistake, she
prefers to put the ball away and
win the point outright. "1 don't
think 1 will ever be able to stay on
the baseline and wait for them to
miss. 1 won't win any points that
way; if I do. well it will be be
cause I am serving and \olleyihg
well." she asserted.
As a result, she plays better
when she is angry. Which is for
tunate, because she does not like
tennis players as a breed, exclud
ing Stanford players ot course.
Anger improves her ser\ e. which
in turn improves her game
whole. "If 1 get angry before a
match and I find something I
don't like about the person I'm
playing, it helps a lot." she com
mented. "I don't like that many
tennis players. 1 don't have any
close tennis-playing friends; 1
don't think I really like any of
them very much. I'm not talking
about at Stanford." she added
hastily. Thus, playing someone
she likes has never been a prob
lem for her.
Mary Lou Piatek of Trinity
was her opponent in the finals of
both the Junior L'.S. Open and
Junior Wimbledon tournaments.
Piatek has been called one of
Moulton's closest friends on the
tour. Before the Open, an article
was printed asserting this as well
as a picture of the two shaking

hands with the caption, "It's
hard to beat your friend." Piatek
and Moulton stayed in the same
room and warmed up together
before the match. Moulton
laughs about all of this out loud
because the two in fact have
never been friends. "1 don't
know where they got that; it's all
fabrication. We've never been
friends." she said. The truth is,
the two rarely spoke and the re
lationship could be classified as
more ambivalent than anything
else.
This dislike of tennis players is
extended to most other aspects
of the game sa\ e actual competi
tion. Moulton cannot stand to
read a tennis magazine, watch a
match on television or watch a
tournament that she is not com
peting in. "I think it's just be
cause 1 don't like to be a spec
tator, an observer. That's why I
leave if I'm at a tournament and I
lose. I'm outa there on the next
flight." she said.
If she has a major problem on
the court, it is her lack of motiva
tion. She is notorious as a come
from behind player largely be
cause she has to make herself
angry enough to play her best. "I
definitely have to get behind to
feel threatened It comes down
to extra motivation: they're win
ning and that's bad news."
Roommate and teammate
Lisa Gordon is almost awed by
her ability to come from behind
and win a match. "She has this
uncanny ability to play so damn
tough when she's down," Gor
don said. "She just pulls off un
believable matches. Against
B YU you knew she was going to
win. They'd have her down by

two match points and she would
come back and win," Gordon
continued. "I'd hate.to be on the
other side of the net if she's fired
up or mad. She's just unbeata
ble."
Regardless of her motiva
tional problem, Moulton be
lieves that she has the ambition
and drive to become a top pro
fessional player. The problem, if
any, will be her lack of patience.
"I like to succeed at what I'm
doing, and if I'm not 1 won't play
anymore competitively at all,"
she said. When she giaduates she
will turn pro, "just because
there's no reason not to."
Her desire to succeed carries
over into other areas. She is a
political science major and
though she has no career plans,
she wants a job where she
doesn't have too many people
above her. "1 want to be the
boss," she laughed.
The lifestyle of a pro tennis
player is one of the least appeal
ing things about the game to
Moulton. "Some people can get
into the travel and the being
around all the other athletes and
women tennis players all the
time. That totally bores me. It's
not interesting," she said simply.
Nevertheless, it's what she
wants to do, and she's quietly
confident that she will succeed.
"If I didn't think I could be in the
top 10 in the world, I wouldn't be
playing, I'd be doing something
else." Moulton appears to take
an extremely simplistic approach
to the game both on and off the
court and with regards to her
likes and dislikes. But the fact is,
her likes and dislikes about the
game remain at odds.
Alycia Mouiton is an aggres
sive tennis player, yet quiet off
the court. She loves being a stu
dent hut dislikes studying tennis;
she has a motivation problem yet
wishes to become a pro, and it is
often difficult to tell whether she
has won or lost a match when it's
over. In short, Mouiton doesn't
much like tennis, but she loves
playing it.
Mouiton picked up tennis
when she was 10 years old. occa
sional!) sneaking a set when she
wasn't swimming competitively
at a local club in Sacramento.
Her parents had very little to do
with entering her into competi
tion, yet they had almost every
thing to do with making it easier
for her to play, and it is rare that
her mother misses a match in the
area.
One could hardly call Mouiton
a disciplined player. Her success
raises serious questions as to the
validity of certain training
methods that most people take
tor granted. She never runs, and
she eats anything and everything
whenever she likes, including be
fore a match.
'"I've never had a routine, like
getting up at the same time every
morning and eating the same
thing for breakfast." Mouiton
said. "I'm not that in anything I
do. I can't do the same thing
everyday." Nevertheless, Moui
ton has never taken an extended
period of time off from tennis.
She says she often wants to take a
break, but "it gets old after a
week."
What physical discipline she
does have probably comes from
10 years of ballet training. This
manifests itself in her fluid
movement on the court, as well
as her quickness. "It definitely
helps on the court." she said.

" Fhe discipline helps too, espe
cially in terms of muscle condi
tioningand things like that." The
ballet seems to be an advantage
off the court as well: according to
her friends, Mouiton is a great
dancer. "Let's just say that if she
could jive as much on the court
as she does off, she'd be unbeat

because it will run through her
mind and disturb her concentra
tion.
Mouiton's method of concent
ration is one of her major
peculiarities. She does not know

what she thinks about on the
court. Many times she has come
off the court not knowing what
the score was, nor can she re
member specific shots or mo
ments.' It's amazing. You would
think that it I were really concen
trating, 1 would know the score,
hut 1 just don't concentrate that
way. I know when I'm ahead and
when I'm behind. Most people
can remember when they won
their serve, when they lost it, but
I can't, 1 just don't," she said.
When she loses it is usually be
cause she is not serving well. She
plays a hard hitting, fast game.


Alycia Moulton
primarily because she is impa
tient. Rather than wait for her
opponent to make a mistake, she
prefers to put the ball away and
win the point outright. "1 don't
think 1 will ever be able to stay on
the baseline and wait for them to
miss. 1 won't win any points that
way; if I do. well it will be be
cause I am serving and \olleyihg
well." she asserted.
As a result, she plays better
when she is angry. Which is for
tunate, because she does not like
tennis players as a breed, exclud
ing Stanford players ot course.
Anger improves her ser\ e. which
in turn improves her game
whole. "If 1 get angry before a
match and I find something I
don't like about the person I'm
playing, it helps a lot." she com
mented. "I don't like that many
tennis players. 1 don't have any
close tennis-playing friends; 1
don't think I really like any of
them very much. I'm not talking
about at Stanford." she added
hastily. Thus, playing someone
she likes has never been a prob
lem for her.
Mary Lou Piatek of Trinity
was her opponent in the finals of
both the Junior L'.S. Open and
Junior Wimbledon tournaments.
Piatek has been called one of
Moulton's closest friends on the
tour. Before the Open, an article
was printed asserting this as well
as a picture of the two shaking

hands with the caption, "It's
hard to beat your friend." Piatek
and Moulton stayed in the same
room and warmed up together
before the match. Moulton
laughs about all of this out loud
because the two in fact have
never been friends. "1 don't
know where they got that; it's all
fabrication. We've never been
friends." she said. The truth is,
the two rarely spoke and the re
lationship could be classified as
more ambivalent than anything
else.
This dislike of tennis players is
extended to most other aspects
of the game sa\ e actual competi
tion. Moulton cannot stand to
read a tennis magazine, watch a
match on television or watch a
tournament that she is not com
peting in. "I think it's just be
cause 1 don't like to be a spec
tator, an observer. That's why I
leave if I'm at a tournament and I
lose. I'm outa there on the next
flight." she said.
If she has a major problem on
the court, it is her lack of motiva
tion. She is notorious as a come
from behind player largely be
cause she has to make herself
angry enough to play her best. "I
definitely have to get behind to
feel threatened It comes down
to extra motivation: they're win
ning and that's bad news."
Roommate and teammate
Lisa Gordon is almost awed by
her ability to come from behind
and win a match. "She has this
uncanny ability to play so damn
tough when she's down," Gor
don said. "She just pulls off un
believable matches. Against
B YU you knew she was going to
win. They'd have her down by

two match points and she would
come back and win," Gordon
continued. "I'd hate.to be on the
other side of the net if she's fired
up or mad. She's just unbeata
ble."
Regardless of her motiva
tional problem, Moulton be
lieves that she has the ambition
and drive to become a top pro
fessional player. The problem, if
any, will be her lack of patience.
"I like to succeed at what I'm
doing, and if I'm not 1 won't play
anymore competitively at all,"
she said. When she giaduates she
will turn pro, "just because
there's no reason not to."
Her desire to succeed carries
over into other areas. She is a
political science major and
though she has no career plans,
she wants a job where she
doesn't have too many people
above her. "1 want to be the
boss," she laughed.
The lifestyle of a pro tennis
player is one of the least appeal
ing things about the game to
Moulton. "Some people can get
into the travel and the being
around all the other athletes and
women tennis players all the
time. That totally bores me. It's
not interesting," she said simply.
Nevertheless, it's what she
wants to do, and she's quietly
confident that she will succeed.
"If I didn't think I could be in the
top 10 in the world, I wouldn't be
playing, I'd be doing something
else." Moulton appears to take
an extremely simplistic approach
to the game both on and off the
court and with regards to her
likes and dislikes. But the fact is,
her likes and dislikes about the
game remain at odds.
Alycia Mouiton is an aggres
sive tennis player, yet quiet off
the court. She loves being a stu
dent hut dislikes studying tennis;
she has a motivation problem yet
wishes to become a pro, and it is
often difficult to tell whether she
has won or lost a match when it's
over. In short, Mouiton doesn't
much like tennis, but she loves
playing it.
Mouiton picked up tennis
when she was 10 years old. occa
sional!) sneaking a set when she
wasn't swimming competitively
at a local club in Sacramento.
Her parents had very little to do
with entering her into competi
tion, yet they had almost every
thing to do with making it easier
for her to play, and it is rare that
her mother misses a match in the
area.
One could hardly call Mouiton
a disciplined player. Her success
raises serious questions as to the
validity of certain training
methods that most people take
tor granted. She never runs, and
she eats anything and everything
whenever she likes, including be
fore a match.
'"I've never had a routine, like
getting up at the same time every
morning and eating the same
thing for breakfast." Mouiton
said. "I'm not that in anything I
do. I can't do the same thing
everyday." Nevertheless, Moui
ton has never taken an extended
period of time off from tennis.
She says she often wants to take a
break, but "it gets old after a
week."
What physical discipline she
does have probably comes from
10 years of ballet training. This
manifests itself in her fluid
movement on the court, as well
as her quickness. "It definitely
helps on the court." she said.

" Fhe discipline helps too, espe
cially in terms of muscle condi
tioningand things like that." The
ballet seems to be an advantage
off the court as well: according to
her friends, Mouiton is a great
dancer. "Let's just say that if she
could jive as much on the court
as she does off, she'd be unbeat
able," one friend and teammate
/laughed.
Mouiton does not like talking
about her tennis oft the court and
is rarely able to read»about her
self. According to her room
mates. she reacts in virtually the
same way whether she wins or
loses. "One time she came back
from a tournament and we asked
her how she did. She just said she
did fine until she got to the fi
nals," one roommate said. The
fact is that Mouiton has won
some of the most impressive
amateur tournaments in the
world. She won the Junior U.S.
Open this year and managed to
last two rounds in the profes
sional Open until she was beaten
by Martina Navritilova. F.\en so.
her friends had a hard time per
suading her to stay the evening
and celebrate.
Mouiton is the last one to be
impressed with her talent and is
impatient with those who are,
though she agrees that it is to be
expected. She contends that it is
easier to play Navritilova than it
is to play the juniors. "Of course
it's scary, and you freeze up," she
asserts. "But you play better be
cause you don't have anything to
worry about; in the juniors you
worry about your rankings and
things like that."
Mouiton doesn't appear to
worry about much ofanythingon
the court. When she loses she
puts it out of her mind almost
immediately, not thinking about
the match until at least a day af
terwards. "I recuperate very

quickly," she laughed. "1 don't
sit down and say,'Oh, did I blow
that one.' " Nor does Mouiton
ever psyche herself up or think
about a match before she plays it.
In fact, she doesn't do anything
at all. More often than not she
simply sits in the stands with a
few friends until it is time to
warm up. She does have one
small problem, though. She can't
listen to music before she plays,
because it will run through her
mind and disturb her concentra
tion.
