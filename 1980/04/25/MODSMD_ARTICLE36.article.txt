Alycia Mouiton is an aggres
sive tennis player, yet quiet off
the court. She loves being a stu
dent hut dislikes studying tennis;
she has a motivation problem yet
wishes to become a pro, and it is
often difficult to tell whether she
has won or lost a match when it's
over. In short, Mouiton doesn't
much like tennis, but she loves
playing it.
Mouiton picked up tennis
when she was 10 years old. occa
sional!) sneaking a set when she
wasn't swimming competitively
at a local club in Sacramento.
Her parents had very little to do
with entering her into competi
tion, yet they had almost every
thing to do with making it easier
for her to play, and it is rare that
her mother misses a match in the
area.
One could hardly call Mouiton
a disciplined player. Her success
raises serious questions as to the
validity of certain training
methods that most people take
tor granted. She never runs, and
she eats anything and everything
whenever she likes, including be
fore a match.
'"I've never had a routine, like
getting up at the same time every
morning and eating the same
thing for breakfast." Mouiton
said. "I'm not that in anything I
do. I can't do the same thing
everyday." Nevertheless, Moui
ton has never taken an extended
period of time off from tennis.
She says she often wants to take a
break, but "it gets old after a
week."
What physical discipline she
does have probably comes from
10 years of ballet training. This
manifests itself in her fluid
movement on the court, as well
as her quickness. "It definitely
helps on the court." she said.

" Fhe discipline helps too, espe
cially in terms of muscle condi
tioningand things like that." The
ballet seems to be an advantage
off the court as well: according to
her friends, Mouiton is a great
dancer. "Let's just say that if she
could jive as much on the court
as she does off, she'd be unbeat
able," one friend and teammate
/laughed.
Mouiton does not like talking
about her tennis oft the court and
is rarely able to readÂ»about her
self. According to her room
mates. she reacts in virtually the
same way whether she wins or
loses. "One time she came back
from a tournament and we asked
her how she did. She just said she
did fine until she got to the fi
nals," one roommate said. The
fact is that Mouiton has won
some of the most impressive
amateur tournaments in the
world. She won the Junior U.S.
Open this year and managed to
last two rounds in the profes
sional Open until she was beaten
by Martina Navritilova. F.\en so.
her friends had a hard time per
suading her to stay the evening
and celebrate.
Mouiton is the last one to be
impressed with her talent and is
impatient with those who are,
though she agrees that it is to be
expected. She contends that it is
easier to play Navritilova than it
is to play the juniors. "Of course
it's scary, and you freeze up," she
asserts. "But you play better be
cause you don't have anything to
worry about; in the juniors you
worry about your rankings and
things like that."
Mouiton doesn't appear to
worry about much ofanythingon
the court. When she loses she
puts it out of her mind almost
immediately, not thinking about
the match until at least a day af
terwards. "I recuperate very

quickly," she laughed. "1 don't
sit down and say,'Oh, did I blow
that one.' " Nor does Mouiton
ever psyche herself up or think
about a match before she plays it.
In fact, she doesn't do anything
at all. More often than not she
simply sits in the stands with a
few friends until it is time to
warm up. She does have one
small problem, though. She can't
listen to music before she plays,
because it will run through her
mind and disturb her concentra
tion.
Mouiton's method of concent
ration is one of her major
peculiarities. She does not know

what she thinks about on the
court. Many times she has come
off the court not knowing what
the score was, nor can she re
member specific shots or mo
ments.' It's amazing. You would
think that it I were really concen
trating, 1 would know the score,
hut 1 just don't concentrate that
way. I know when I'm ahead and
when I'm behind. Most people
can remember when they won
their serve, when they lost it, but
I can't, 1 just don't," she said.
When she loses it is usually be
cause she is not serving well. She
plays a hard hitting, fast game.
