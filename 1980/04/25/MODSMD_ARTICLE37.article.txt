## IOC postpones site decision 
### Kenneth Reich The Los Angeles Times 
LAUSANNE. Switzerland — The International
Olympic Committee executive board has decided
to postpone for one year, from 1 MS 1 until 1982. the
date for selecting the sites of the 1988 Olv mpics in
another apparent consequence of the spreading
boycott against the Moscow Games.
Although the action must be ratified b\ the full
lOC membership when it meets in Moscow in July.
ratification of such actions is customarih automa
tic.
lOC officials said that the unannounced decision
came in part because the prospective candidates
for the Summer Games in 198N — Melbourne.
Brussels and Nagova, Japan —are all reevaluating
their plans in light of the boycott, taking it as fresh
evidence that an Olympics can bring the host city
many unexpected troubles.
Another one-time prospective 1988 candidate.
London, bowed out earlier after officials there ex
pressed doubt that the British capital could afford
the Games that year.
A second reason for the postponement is that it
the 1988 selections were made next year, thev
would be made during the World Olvmpic Con
gress. scheduled for Baden-Baden. West Ger
many.
lOC' officials fear that if West Germany boycotts
the Moscow Games, as urged bv the go\ ernment of
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, the Communist na
tions will refuse to go to Baden-Baden. The con
gress then would no doubt be moved to a neutral
site, but the process might be difficult and time
consuming. disrupting the selection process for the
1988 Games.
In the past. Olympic cities have generally been
chosen six years in advance, and bv planning to
make the 1988 selection in 1981, the lOC had been
experimenting with gi\ing host cities a longer time
to prepare for the competition.
Although the latest change simplv reverts to the
traditional schedule, it is still viewed as another
sign of the uncertainty surrounding the Olympic

movement because of the Moscow boycott being
pushed bv the Carter administration to protest the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The boycott gained an important new adherent
yesterdav when the Chinese Olympic Committee
officially announced it would not send a team to
Moscow, an intention the Chinese had signaled
earlier.
/hong Shitong. chairman of the Peking-based
committee, said the decision could still be rev ersed
if Soviet troops withdraw fully from Afghanistan
bv Mas 24. the deadline for accepting Moscow's
invitation.
In Washington, high White House and State De
partment sources said they are more optimistic
than ever that the boycott will be a success. A State
Department source said that more than 60 coun
tries are expected not to go to Moscow.
At the White House, a senior official told the
Los Angeles Times that France is expected to fol
low the West German government's lead and en
dorse the boycott. He added that he still belies es it
is quite likely that the British Olvmpic Association
decision ot March 25 to attend the Game be re
\ersed.
The White House official pointed to a 442-8
vote in the West German Bundestag endorsing the
Bonn government's boycott call as indicating the
strength of boycott sentiment in Western Europe.
Vitaly Smirnov. chief operating executiv eof the
Moscow Games, said here yesterday that as far as
the Soviets are concerned. May 24 will not be
regarded as the final date for entering a team in
Moscow.
Smirno\ told the Los Angeles Times that if the
situation changed and the U.S. Olvmpic Commit
tee decided to send a team, it would be welcome in
Moscow e\en if it gave notice it was coming in the
last week before the games.
The Carter administration, however, has called
the U.S. boycott final.and there has been nosign in
any case that the Soviets are prepared to withdraw
their troops from Afghanistan at an early date.
