## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
BERKELEY — Stanford
overpowered a weak California
squad in three straight games to
end the men's volleyball season
on a winning note. The Bears
were outclassed by a loose Car
dinal team that won 15-12. 15-1
and 15-7 in Berkeley Wednes
day night.
The victory gives Stanford an
K-12 overall record, including a
6-10 league slate. The Cardinals
finish up the season in seventh
place in the 10-member Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association.
Stanford dominated play from
the very start as they ran up an
1 1-3 lead early in the first bame.
But the last point was the most
difficult one to score for Stan
ford. With the Cards ahead 14-4
Cal closed the gap with a string of
eight straight points, but Tom
Grimes spiked a Kip Engen set
down the right side to give Stan
ford the win.
Although the Bears appeared
to have regrouped during the last
part of the first game, their sys
tem collapsed after the teams
switched sides. Cal suffered from
offensive errors, while Stanford
played consistently on both of
fense and defense to take the
game in 20 minutes.
Middle blocker Jack Foxworth
blocked a Cal spike attempt over
the net alter pounding two
Engen sets to score three con
secutive points for the Cards. Cal
was called lor a number of net
violations to also contribute to
the Cardinal score. Grimes again
put the game away with a block
at the net which bounced off a
Cal spiker and sailed out of
bounds.
In the beginning of the third
game Foxworth remained the
only starter in the lineup as head
coach Fred Sturm went to his
bench, but the Cardinals still eas
ily handled Cal. Sophomore Bob
Dean, who replaced F.ngen at
setter, tapped the ball over the
net to tie the game at one. After
the serve, Dean teamed with

Mark Reagan at the net to block
a spike over and give Stanford a
lead they kept for the rest of the
game.
Two Cal spikes out of bounds,
two net violations, and a spike
into the net quicly put the Cards
up 7-1. Dean set hitters Corey
Brown, Andrew Dodds and
Reagan to keep Stanford ahead,
but Cal scored the last four
points for the Cards on a net vio
lation and three ball handling
miscues.
"We played really great,"
Engen said,"lt was the last game
of the season so everyone was
psyched. It's pretty hard not to
beat Berkeley, though, because
they're so weak." Engen en
joyed a good season at the setter
position where he was highly
praised by Sturm as well as op
posing coaches.
The match was the collegiate
finale for six seniors on the team
who contributed greatly to the
program's development. Re
fleeting on his last match as a
Cardinal, Foxworth said, "I'm
glad to win the last game. My
career has had its ups and downs.
We didn't put it all together this
year, but that's history. They're a
great bunch of guys. I'm sorry to
go."
Middle blocker Kim Lum
noted, "It's been fun for four
years; it's nice to go out with a
win over Berkeley."
Hitter John McColl agreed.
"It was fun to beat the Bears in
the last game," he said.
Senior hitter Frank Anderson
wrapped up the season saying,
"The coaches deserve a lot of
credit for the job they did. They
were responsible for everything
except the losses."
Coach Sturm and assistant
coach John Bekins were also
lauded by team captain Rod
Fletcher. "Our coaches deserve
a lot of credit," he said. "Last
year we didn't do what the
coaches wanted, and it really
showed. This year we did, and
when we didn't you could tell. It
was a really well-coached team."

was a really well-coached team."
BERKELEY — Stanford
overpowered a weak California
squad in three straight games to
end the men's volleyball season
on a winning note. The Bears
were outclassed by a loose Car
dinal team that won 15-12. 15-1
and 15-7 in Berkeley Wednes
day night.
The victory gives Stanford an
K-12 overall record, including a
6-10 league slate. The Cardinals
finish up the season in seventh
place in the 10-member Califor
nia Intercollegiate Volleyball
Association.
Stanford dominated play from
the very start as they ran up an
1 1-3 lead early in the first bame.
But the last point was the most
difficult one to score for Stan
ford. With the Cards ahead 14-4
Cal closed the gap with a string of
eight straight points, but Tom
Grimes spiked a Kip Engen set
down the right side to give Stan
ford the win.
Although the Bears appeared
to have regrouped during the last
part of the first game, their sys
tem collapsed after the teams
switched sides. Cal suffered from
offensive errors, while Stanford
played consistently on both of
fense and defense to take the
game in 20 minutes.
Middle blocker Jack Foxworth
blocked a Cal spike attempt over
the net alter pounding two
Engen sets to score three con
secutive points for the Cards. Cal
was called lor a number of net
violations to also contribute to
the Cardinal score. Grimes again
put the game away with a block
at the net which bounced off a
Cal spiker and sailed out of
bounds.
In the beginning of the third
game Foxworth remained the
only starter in the lineup as head
coach Fred Sturm went to his
bench, but the Cardinals still eas
ily handled Cal. Sophomore Bob
Dean, who replaced F.ngen at
setter, tapped the ball over the
net to tie the game at one. After
the serve, Dean teamed with

Mark Reagan at the net to block
a spike over and give Stanford a
lead they kept for the rest of the
game.
Two Cal spikes out of bounds,
two net violations, and a spike
into the net quicly put the Cards
up 7-1. Dean set hitters Corey
Brown, Andrew Dodds and
Reagan to keep Stanford ahead,
but Cal scored the last four
points for the Cards on a net vio
lation and three ball handling
miscues.
"We played really great,"
Engen said,"lt was the last game
of the season so everyone was
psyched. It's pretty hard not to
beat Berkeley, though, because
they're so weak." Engen en
joyed a good season at the setter
position where he was highly
praised by Sturm as well as op
posing coaches.
The match was the collegiate
finale for six seniors on the team
who contributed greatly to the
program's development. Re
fleeting on his last match as a
Cardinal, Foxworth said, "I'm
glad to win the last game. My
career has had its ups and downs.
We didn't put it all together this
year, but that's history. They're a
great bunch of guys. I'm sorry to
go."
Middle blocker Kim Lum
noted, "It's been fun for four
years; it's nice to go out with a
win over Berkeley."
Hitter John McColl agreed.
"It was fun to beat the Bears in
the last game," he said.
Senior hitter Frank Anderson
wrapped up the season saying,
"The coaches deserve a lot of
credit for the job they did. They
were responsible for everything
except the losses."
Coach Sturm and assistant
coach John Bekins were also
lauded by team captain Rod
Fletcher. "Our coaches deserve
a lot of credit," he said. "Last
year we didn't do what the
coaches wanted, and it really
showed. This year we did, and
when we didn't you could tell. It
was a really well-coached team."
