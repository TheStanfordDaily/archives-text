# Netwomen land four top recruits
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
In his first season as Stanford's
women's tennis coach, 112 rank
Brennan took a major step in the
direction of continuing Stanford
as a tennis powerhouse by sign
ing four prominant high school
players to national letters of in
tent this year.
Leading the way is the No. 2
rated high-schooler in the na
tion, Elise Burgin of Baltimore,
Md., Burgin was just recently
chosen to be one of four junior
representatives at Junior Wimb
ledon, the Junior French Open
and the Junior Italian Open.
Brennan was understandably
pleased with Burgin's decision to
come to Stanford. "She's a real
prospect. If she was on our team
right now she'd probably plug in
about number two. She's just a
little behind Alycia (Stanford's
No. 1 player Alycia Moulton.) It
was real tough recruiting war for
her — she was considering
Florida for a long time.
"She has played quite a bit of
doubles with Caryn (Stanford
freshman Caryn Copeland —
No. 3 singles) in juniors," Bren
nan continued, "so we might re
surrect that doubles team again
here at the Farm." BuFgin has
also played some doubles with
Moulton.
Stanford's second major re
cruit is the under-publicized No.
3 high schooler in the nation,
Susy Jae Jaeger.
From Lincoln Shire, 111.,
Jaeger is the older sister of I 4-
year-old professional phenom
Andrea Jaeger who is often
touted as "the next Tracy Au
stin."
"Susy has gone through most
of her career in the shadow of her
younger sister," said Brennan,
"It's been tough on her ha\ing a
little sister who's better than her
and a professional at 14 years
old, but she wisely decided to
stick out her amateur career and
I think her game is improving all

the time.
"She has played our No. 2
player Donna Rubin three times
this year and beaten her in all
three matches."
Brennan's third recruit is,
Michelle Weiss, the No. 5 rated
high-schooler in the nation after
a vast improving campaign di
rected by world-renowned ten
nis coach Harry Hopkins.
Weiss, originally from
Tenafly, N.J., moved to Florida
several years ago and her game
has been improving ever since.
The fourth recruit for Stan
ford. Alison Hardey from Santa
Barbara, is. according to Bren
nan "ranked about 12th or
13th," but iv possibly the most
important catch for Brennan.
"Alison is coming here with no
aid. simply because I don't have
any aid left. She turned down a
full-scholarship at < al — their
first ever, to come here. I think it
was a real compliment to our
program that she decided to
come here with no aid."
explained Brennan, who be
lies es that 1 lardey's contribution
will go beyond court play.
"She's No. 3 in Southern
California even though she
hasn't been playing all that long
— maybe four or five years. She
has won the CI I
Brennan was extremely
pleased with all ol his recruits
and foresees no problems for
them in adjusting to the Farm.
As for their playing ability
Brennan says, 'All are top
players — it was a great recruit
ing year."
