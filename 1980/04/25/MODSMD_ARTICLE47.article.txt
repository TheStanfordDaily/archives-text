## 
### Steve Odell Staff Writer 
The Stanford men's track
team takes a 3-2 dual meet re
cord into their final home track
meet of the 1980 season, when
thev will play host to Oregon
State and UC-lrvine this Satur
day at Stanford Stadium. Hie
field events begin at 12:30 with
the hammer throw at Angell
Field, while the rest of the com
petition will get under way at
1:30
The Cards are coming off
some impressive performances
in last week's Mt, SAC Relays, in
which they won both the 4 x
1600 and 4 x 400 meter relays,
and the javelin, which Gary
Bruner took with a toss of 230-4.
The Beavers from Oregon
State bring a fine 5-1 dual meet
record into the three-way meet,
while UC-Irvine's Anteaters
have a 1-3 mark. The Beavers
finished ninth ahead of Stanford
last year in the Pacific-10 champ
ionships, while UC-lrvine is the
two-time defending pacific coast
Athletic Association Champs.
"This is a pretty important
meet for us," remarked Stan
ford's head coach Brooks
Johnson. "We need to get some

positive momentum and inertia
built up. I see it as a very com
petitive meet, and compare it to
the one against San Jose State,
where it came down to the last
few events."
UC-lrvine, coached by Kevin
McNair, has several excellent in
dividual performers, including
defending I'CAA 800-meter
champion Thomas Frazier.
Other events to watch for the
Anteaters will be in the 400 met
ers, with Tony Wells (47.5), and
the hurdles, where they have
Greg Marjama (14.2, 52.5).
Beaver head coach Frank
Morris brings some impressive
talent into the meet also, and it is
headed by his discus thrower
Tim Fox. Fox, a senior, was last
year's Pac-10 champ and placed
third in the NCAA's. His
lifetime best is 202-3 and he also
has the best throw in the Pac-10
this year with a toss of 196-5.
Other Beavers to look for are
Tom Schillinger, also in the
discus (182-0); and javelin man
Mike Hesseltine (240-9).
The Cards own a lifetime mark
of 4-2 against OSU, while this
weekend will be the first meeting
ever between the Anteaters and
Stanford.

Stanford has had an up and
down track year so far and would
like a win to put some solidarity
into their attack, heading into
the Cal meet next week. The
Cards started off the year by
barely losing to San Jose State,
85-77, but then came back to win
three meets in a row against
Hayward State (100-58), Fresno
State (84-79), and Occidental
(108-45). But in Stanford's last
dual meet appearance, they were
destroyed by UCLA, (120-33).
"We match up well with both
teams, and most all of the events
I expect to be close," Johnson
noted. "The 100 and 200 meters
should be very good races, and
the 800 is going to be close also."
llie Cardinals boast Darrin
Nelson and Gordon Banks in
both of the short sprints, and in
the 800 they are led by John
Schaer and Dennis Arriola.
Johnson also gave special at
tention to the hammer, which
features Rick Buss. "It's one of

our best events, hut it usually
doesn't get that much coverage
or attention, because it's held
outside the stadium. I would im
agine though, that it Kick got a
lot of people to show up and a lot
of support, that he could break
his own school record, at least.
He really performs well under
pressure and in big situations."
Buss has cleared the 2 14 mark
the last two weeks, and holds a
lifetime best of 215-10,the best
effort in the Pac-10 this year.
Dave Thomson is also another
man to watch in the hammer for
Stanford. At Mt. SAC last week,
he came up with a personal best
on his toss of 203-8, which is only
four inches shy of the U.S.
Olympic qualifying standard.
"We need a dual meet win this
weekend. Our last one was a dis
aster, when we went up against
UCLA. We need a strong per
formance to get back in the har
ness," Johnson said.
