# Ruggers to host regional tourney
## 
### 
The Stanford Rugby Club
which is considered to be one of
the best in California will be
competing in the first round of
the National University Rugby
Tournament this Saturday on the
Rugby Field. The tournament
will begin at 1:30 p.m.
Competing on Saturday will
be Stanford, Cal and Long Beach
State in a round robin format.
The winner of this round will ad
vance to the Golden Gate Tour
nament Sunday in Golden Gate
Park. That tournament will start
at 1 p.m.
The nationals will be held in
lowa in mid-March and the win
ner of the Golden
ment will be the Western rep
resentative. The tournament is
not exactly official, it is some
what loosely organized, but it is
the only one of its kind and will

have representatives from all
areas of the country. The East
ern representative has already
been determined as Army.
Michelob is the probable
sponsor for the tournament in
lowa, but that's not certain yet.
They were the ones who first ap
proached Stanford with the idea
over vacation at the Monterey
tournament.
"If we can get by the tourna
ment Saturday," team member
Frank Hicks said, "I'm confident
we can win the whole thing. Long
Beach State is very lough but we
can beat them.
"I'll just say I'm pretty sure we
can win the nationals."
When asked if he thought the
team was psyched up for the
tournament, all Hicks said was
"Rap on!"
