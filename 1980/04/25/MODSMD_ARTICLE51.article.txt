Writing of Lionel Trilling's
view of Freud, William M. Chace
says that Trilling
had never been much interested in
some of Freud's technical or clin
ical formulations, particularly as
they involved the explicitly sex
ual, the infantile, the specific
dynamics of the unconscious, and
the world of dreams. His atten
tion had been riveted for years on
Freud's metaphysical and
prophetic force, not on how the
small, intricate steps of his argu
ment were to end at last in truth
(p. 167).
Trilling, that is. found himself
drawn to the Freud of Civiliza
tion and its Discontents rather
than to the Freud of Dora, found
himself drawn to the tragic
Freud, to Freud in his largest and
most synthetic moments.
Much the same can be said of
Chace's interest in Trilling. He is
not much concerned with Tril
ling's judgments of individual
works of literature, like the
finely wrought "Emma and the
Legend of Jane Austen." In deal
ing with Trilling's essays, such as

those collected in The Liberal
Imagination, Chace skims over
the individual pieces,concentrat
ing instead on the points at
which, in overlapping each
other, those essays provide a
critique of something far more
than the work at hand. Chace's
final focus is on Trilling's own
synthesis of those overlapping
points. Sincerity and Authentic
ity, his Norton Lectures for
1969-70, in which, summing up
the concerns of a career. Tril
ling's range most nearly ap
proached that of the Freud he
admired.
Chace's approach is sound.
For Trilling's importance is not
primarily as a thinker about lit
erature per se. As Chase insists:
It is not the sped fic findings of his
literary writings, the isolated re
marks and apercus that give him
his unmistakable value to the cul
ture in which he lived ... he was
not a theorist and he left to the
future no coherent philosophy of
literature (p. 187).
A student will learn very little
about the business of literary
criticism from Trilling, certainly
much less than he or she would
learn by studying some of Tril
ling's contemporaries, such as
Winters or Brooks.
Trilling offers other lessons.
Like the Arnold about whom he
wrote his first book, Trilling was

a critic of the culture as a whole.
In reading him, one surely learns
about literature, but always lit
erature in context, literature as
both creator and reflector of soc
iety's beliefs about itself. The re
sult is that "Trilling has been
judged a moralist, or a historian
of moral consciousness, or a
philosopher of culture (p. 187)."
In time, ChaOe claims, Trilling
was seen by both himself and
others as a spokesman not just
for those connected with literary
study, but for American intellec
tuals in general.
There are a number of reasons
for this, but Trilling's abstention
from a rigid critical methodology
looms largest. This abstention
made his work free of the solip
sistic quality of much literary
criticism, allowed him to speak
largely about the culture in gen
eral. Trilling's admirable empiri
cism is part and parcel of his un
shakeable conviction that litera
ture and life are intimately con
nected, that they affect each
other. This
faith in the real existence of soci
ety - a tough fabric in which his
tory, political event, and
economic situation are interwo
ven with the artist's peculiar aspi
ration - made him a literary critic
accessible to a multitude of non
literary thinkers (p. 179).
Accessible, that is, without at all
simplifying his arguments for the
sake of that accessibility.
Those arguments are far too
complex for me to describe here
without doing serious injustice
both to Trilling and to Chace's
admirable synthesis. Chace
makes those arguments clear;
perhaps more importantly, he
demonstrates why Trilling is
worth caring about. As in read
ing Trilling, we never forget that
literature is connected with life,
so in reading Chace, we never
forget that Trilling's criticism is
intimately connected with a
human being. Paradoxically, the
study is not traditional bio
graphical — it does not examine
the events ot a personal life. Yet
in another sense the work is pro
foundly biographical.
Trilling did not have a
methodology, he had a sensibil
ity, whose incessant battles with
itself, as expressed in his work,
gave that work complexity and
authority. Chace's book is a
biography of that sensibility. It
details the ways in which Tril
ling's particular vision of culture
grew out of those public battles
with himself. Reading Lionel
Trilling: Criticism and Politics,
one realizes that Trilling's battles
were not simply intellectual
ones, that he could not mentally
juggle them away, because they
grew out of the contradictions of
the human spirit itself. That is a
large claim to make for any sen
sibility; the great strength of
Chace's graceful, lucid book is
that it provides firm evidence for
that claim.
