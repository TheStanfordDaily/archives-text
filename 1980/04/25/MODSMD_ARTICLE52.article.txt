In Broken Country

My initial impulse after read
ing David Wagoner's collection
of poetry, In Broken Country,
was to try and convince him to
become some sort of official
mediator in environmental dis
putes. Gradually realizing I was
getting a bit carried away, I
reasoned he'd probably do more
good staying behind his typewri
ter, and I might make better use
of my time trying to convince you
to read a copy under your favo
rite tree some brilliant Northern
Californian afternoon.
If upon closing the book, you
don't immediately retreat to
some remote unspoiled region of
America, you'll at least become
more aware of what, up until that
point, you may have been taking
for granted or missing. For the
power of Wagoner's poetry lies
in its celebration of that within
both man and nature which per
sists in surviving, even rejoicing,
amidst the oppression and de
struction of today's broken coun
try. In "The Singers" he writes:
"Without false promises/
Leaving their smiles for later,
lifting their voices/With calm
straight faces, they must face
their music."
In the opening poem, "After
the Speech to the Librarians,"
the narrator observes the inabil
ity of a locked gate to prevent
"Everything trespassing as
easily/As the hazy sunlight . . ."
By placing boundaries between
himself and nature, man is really
only cutting off his own freedom.
Librarians are trapped among
shelves of books, children are
trapped in schools "listening to
how not to be so childish," while
the hawks and horses are "not
even thinking of opening a
thesaurus." In the concluding
lines of the poem, Wagoner
hopes that man will eventually
stop seeing nature from the other
side of a fence: "Their breasts all
hold the same air/As his and the
softly whickering unsaddled
horses'/And mine and the
Librarians'/With which we all
might sing for the children."
This theme of the natural
overcoming artificial boundaries
is echoed again and again
throughout the first two sections
of the volume, by images that
seem commonplace when listed
but turn miraculous under
Wagoner's soft touch: a tuft of
thistledown floating through a
car window, the thorned
branches of pruned rosebushes
clinging to gloved hands, a herd
of cows surrounding the nar
rator's car, swallows soaring
above a garbage fill turned
sanctuary, and in "Seeds," chic
kadees planting the seeds of dis
carded sunflowers: "Black
and-White birds, the color of
sunflower seedc and field
mice,/ Even ink and paper, are
cramming darkness with light."
In his accounts of human ex
perience, Wagoner's style paral
lels the themes he explores.
"Stunts," a series of five lively
poems, is as unique and tellingas

the unconventional approaches
to life Wagoner is applauding.
By slipping back behind child
hood eyes to write such nostalgic
and often humorous poems as
"Boy Jesus," "The Junior High
School Band Concert," "Dirge
for a Flayer Piano," and "My
Father's Wall," he expresses an
admiration for the pure and hon
est perception of children . . .
These are also proof of
Wagoner's own ability to per
ceive the potential human being
struggling to emerge from be
neath the clumsy uncertainty of
adolescence, no less great in his
ability to sense the presence of
someone behind the confused nd
vacant stares of the senile, as
evidenced by the simple but in
tense beauty of the last lines of
"Into the Nameless Places:"
And no one asks if I wish to be
Anyone else or called anyone
younger
Or where these rootless flowers
have come from,
What gardens must still be grow
ing somewhere
To pour such color against color
less pillows
Or why everyone is too far away
To kiss me, so lost beside me
Even inside my arms, and no one
Asks out of politeness why I stare
at nothing
As if it were really here.
The 12 selections included in
Part Three again describe man's
interaction with nature, but in an
even more direct and piercing
tone than that of the previous
two sections. The human ele
ment in these poems is neither a
passive observer nor an aggres
sive conquerer of nature, but i
lone man struggling for surviva
in some vast stretch of wilder
ness. While there is a certair
Jack London flavor to thr
theme, Wagoner denies you thi
detachment London permits
The poems are addressed to you
the reader, the human being, tin
lone man
You've earned this worn-down
hard, incredible sight
Called Here and Now.
Now, what you make of it mean:
everything,
Means starting over:
The life in your hands is neithei
here nor there
But getting there,
So you're standing again ana
breathing, beginning another
Journey without regret
Forever, being your own un
peaceable kingdom,
The end of endings.
To miss reading In Broken
Country is like missing a journey,
a holiday and most of all, a song.
â€” Anne Galicich
