The Dogs of March
Ernest Hebert
Penguin Books
225 pp. $2.95
What does New Hampshire
mean to you? Maple syrup (from
Vermont)? The Presidential
Primary? New Hampshire is un
known territory to most of us. A
place very far away. However, it
is a place, with its own unique,
interesting and sometimes tragic
culture.
Ernest Hebert has written a
book about New Hampshire. A
book that investigates the situa
tion of the poor, almost desper
ate. rural yankees who make up
such a large part of its popula
tion. The Dogs oj March takes
the reader inside one of Ameri
ca's lesser known subcultures
and helps him to understand a
people and a way of life.
'But Hebert's book is not an
anthropological study. It is a
novel and a good novel at that.
The characters are real and be
lievable, though different. The
author does not bend them out of
shape to illustrate different di
mensions of their world.
Howard El man is the book's
protagonist, a factory worker
with fifty acres of rocky farm
land and a yard full of junk cars.
Husband, father, and hunter.
Elman comes across. He is a de
sperate man and his desperation
drives him to near madness, but
it never drives him out of the
realm of believability. His desp
eration and his madness are
natural and sympathetic. They
do not seem to be con jured up to
demonstrate the plight of the
New England lower class.
One of the most distressing
symptoms of the self-serving age

we live in has been that most
good novels have been about
novelists, monuments to the wri
ter's concern with himself. There
are no writers in The Dogs of
March. Here, rather than getting
inside himself, a writer has man
aged to get inside someone else.
And by doing so he revives the
power for educating and under
standing, which is one of fiction's
greatest potentials, if not one of
its most common attributes.
It is common wisdom that

good reviews are shorter than
bad re\ iews, for both reader and
writer quickly tire of praise.
Hebert's Dons of March is not a
great book. It will never be
analyzed in upper division En
glish courses or included in col
lections of classics.
It is a good book, and if any
thing this is more significant. It is
not a book to have or a book to
study, it is a book to read. A sort
of book we could use more of.
