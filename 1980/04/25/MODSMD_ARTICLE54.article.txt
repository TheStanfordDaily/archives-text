# Parents at center of modern novels

In a review of Adrienne
Rich's Of Woman Horn:
Motherhood as Experience
and Institution, the critic
Helen Vendler notes, with an
approval she withholds from
the book as a whole, that:
As Rich remarks, there is re
markably little written at all
about motherhood. Thf
reason for the dearth . . . is
that motherhood is pro
foundly uninteresting to
men . . . Oddly enough. Rich
did not, at least when she was a
young mother, see her chil
dren as a subject. . . Is there
something about the relation
with children in contrast to re
lations with adults, which
makes it unavailable to the
writer?
Vender's last observation is
her most telling. While it is
true that men have not writ
ten very much about mother
hood. it is also true that they
haven't written much about
fatherhood, a subject which
one might presume would en
gage the male imagination.
Nor did the great women
novelists of the nineteenth
century find themselves en
gaged by motherhood — but
then, neither Austen or Eliot
or the Brontes were mothers.
Make of that what you will.
The simple fact is that there
is surprisingly little written
about parenthood. Countless
self-help guides, of course —
it's quite easy to find out
about bottles and diapers and
no longer dressing boys in
blue and girls in pink. Beyond
that — very little. That lack
scares me. scares me because

the prospect of parenthood —
for me, of fatherhood — is
itself a frightening one. In
choosing to become a parent,
one assumes, with an awful
arrogance, theaweful respon
sibility for a human life, for a
life too frail to protect itself,
perhaps to protect itself most
especially from its own pa
rents. Yet I know next to no
thing about what that respon
sibility entails, except what
the self-help guides tell me.
What 1 want, against the quite
distant day when I become a
father, is something that tells
me what that responsibility
feels like, what it means, to
become a parent. I want an
imaginative articulation of
what it means to be a parent;
the fact that Kramer vs.
Kramer has been so popular
points to the fact that others
want the same thing.
Literature is full of the rela
tions of parents and children,
but the relationship is almost
always seen from the child's
point of view. One speaks of
comjng to terms with one's
mother-or father, bat not with
one's children. Most English
novels are about growing up,
or about relations between
adult men and women; these
are often combined, and the
result is a novel about court
ship. Parental irresponsibil
ity, such as Mr. Bennet's in
Pride and Prejudice is usually
dealt with cursorily, if at all.
The one great nineteenth cen
tury novel about parental in
adequacy, James' What
Maisie Knew, is told from the
viewpoint of a child.

One can speculate as to
vhy parenthood did not much
engage the nineteenth cen
tury novel. Nowadays we
'choose" whether or not to
become parents. Choosing to
do something increases one's
feeling of responsibility for
results; hence the trepidation
with which I.and many of us,
approach the idea of parent
hood. Yet in the nineteenth
century one didn't choose to
become a parent; children fol
lowed more or less uncon
trollably upon marriage.
One's responsibility lay not in
the decision to have children,
but in the decision to marry.
A character was either a bad
or a good parent insofar as he
or she was or was not a fool;
the degree of wisdom with
which one chose a spouse in
dicated one's success as a pa
rent. Hie novel fastened upon
marriage because it was an
area in which choice was pos
sible, because areas of choice
were, and are, the most in
teresting parts of life.
Now those areas have
changed. Parenthood is now a
choice, and an interesting
one. perhaps even more in
teresting than marriage, be
cause it involves a wider
range of issues; for one, mar
riage need not interfere with
either spouse's career, while
parenthood is certain to do
so. Parenthood would be an
interesting choice if only be
cause so many seem inclined
not to choose it, while remain
ing "traditional" in almost
every other respect. And so I
find it sustaining to realize
that much of the best con
temporary literature is a re
sponse to that choice, does
not simply touch on parent
hood. but places that experi
ence at the center of its con
ception.
1 find it no acci
dent that the most popular
"serious" novel of the last few
years, John Irving's The
World According to Garp
deals quite powerfully with
what it means to be a father,
with a father's love and as
sumption of responsibility for

his children. John Leonard's
Black Conceit is a litie known
but quite wonderful book
which combines a sure feel for
sixties politics with an intense
probing of parenthood;
Leonard's "Private Lives"
column in the New York
Times also deals, frequently
and movingly, with the prob
lems of being a divorced
father. John Updike writes on
similar theses, particularly in
his short story,
"Separating."
These works on fatherhood
make a short list, but it is a list
all the same, and is quite a bit
better than nothing. What of
motherhood? It's true that, as
Vendler notes, it doesn't en
gage most male imaginations,
though it does engage
Leonard's in Black Conceit.
Yet it does engage the female
imagination, most impor
tantly in the work of the En
glish novelist Margaret
Drabble. The Needle's Eye is
one of the most intelligent
novels, on any subject, to be
published in the last twenty
years, intelligent in the ways
that Eliot and James arc intel
ligent. in ways that are far
more important to our moral
lives than any post-modernist
fiction could ever be. And is a
more complex work than
Kramer vs. Kramer ever had a
hope of being.
The women's movement's
emphasis on choice, on one's
right not to have children
should, almost paradoxically,
increase the number of works
of imaginative literature
which deal centrally with
parenthood. For the moment,
however, the writers on my
list begin to provide model,
begin to tell a parent, present
or future, what to do after
we've"walked and prayed for
this young child an hour." My
list, like that hour, is a start,
but it is not enough, and I do
not know that there can ever
be enough. But by the time I
become a parent, I think
there will be more to guide
me, and 1 find that reassuring.

century one didn't choose to
become a parent; children fol
lowed more or less uncon
trollably upon marriage.
One's responsibility lay not in
the decision to have children,
but in the decision to marry.
A character was either a bad
or a good parent insofar as he
or she was or was not a fool;
the degree of wisdom with
which one chose a spouse in
dicated one's success as a pa
rent. Hie novel fastened upon
marriage because it was an
area in which choice was pos
sible, because areas of choice
were, and are, the most in
teresting parts of life.
Now those areas have
changed. Parenthood is now a
choice, and an interesting
one. perhaps even more in
teresting than marriage, be
cause it involves a wider
range of issues; for one, mar
riage need not interfere with
either spouse's career, while
parenthood is certain to do
so. Parenthood would be an
interesting choice if only be
cause so many seem inclined
not to choose it, while remain
ing "traditional" in almost
every other respect. And so I
find it sustaining to realize
that much of the best con
temporary literature is a re
sponse to that choice, does
not simply touch on parent
hood. but places that experi
ence at the center of its con
ception.
1 find it no acci
dent that the most popular
"serious" novel of the last few
years, John Irving's The
World According to Garp
deals quite powerfully with
what it means to be a father,
with a father's love and as
sumption of responsibility for

his children. John Leonard's
Black Conceit is a litie known
but quite wonderful book
which combines a sure feel for
sixties politics with an intense
probing of parenthood;
Leonard's "Private Lives"
column in the New York
Times also deals, frequently
and movingly, with the prob
lems of being a divorced
father. John Updike writes on
similar theses, particularly in
his short story,
"Separating."
These works on fatherhood
make a short list, but it is a list
all the same, and is quite a bit
better than nothing. What of
motherhood? It's true that, as
Vendler notes, it doesn't en
gage most male imaginations,
though it does engage
Leonard's in Black Conceit.
Yet it does engage the female
imagination, most impor
tantly in the work of the En
glish novelist Margaret
Drabble. The Needle's Eye is
one of the most intelligent
novels, on any subject, to be
published in the last twenty
years, intelligent in the ways
that Eliot and James arc intel
ligent. in ways that are far
more important to our moral
lives than any post-modernist
fiction could ever be. And is a
more complex work than
Kramer vs. Kramer ever had a
hope of being.
The women's movement's
emphasis on choice, on one's
right not to have children
should, almost paradoxically,
increase the number of works
of imaginative literature
which deal centrally with
parenthood. For the moment,
however, the writers on my
list begin to provide model,
begin to tell a parent, present
or future, what to do after
we've"walked and prayed for
this young child an hour." My
list, like that hour, is a start,
but it is not enough, and I do
not know that there can ever
be enough. But by the time I
become a parent, I think
there will be more to guide
me, and 1 find that reassuring.

In a review of Adrienne
Rich's Of Woman Horn:
Motherhood as Experience
and Institution, the critic
Helen Vendler notes, with an
approval she withholds from
the book as a whole, that:
As Rich remarks, there is re
markably little written at all
about motherhood. Thf
reason for the dearth . . . is
that motherhood is pro
foundly uninteresting to
men . . . Oddly enough. Rich
did not, at least when she was a
young mother, see her chil
dren as a subject. . . Is there
something about the relation
with children in contrast to re
lations with adults, which
makes it unavailable to the
writer?
Vender's last observation is
her most telling. While it is
true that men have not writ
ten very much about mother
hood. it is also true that they
haven't written much about
fatherhood, a subject which
one might presume would en
gage the male imagination.
Nor did the great women
novelists of the nineteenth
century find themselves en
gaged by motherhood — but
then, neither Austen or Eliot
or the Brontes were mothers.
Make of that what you will.
The simple fact is that there
is surprisingly little written
about parenthood. Countless
self-help guides, of course —
it's quite easy to find out
about bottles and diapers and
no longer dressing boys in
blue and girls in pink. Beyond
that — very little. That lack
scares me. scares me because

the prospect of parenthood —
for me, of fatherhood — is
itself a frightening one. In
choosing to become a parent,
one assumes, with an awful
arrogance, theaweful respon
sibility for a human life, for a
life too frail to protect itself,
perhaps to protect itself most
especially from its own pa
rents. Yet I know next to no
thing about what that respon
sibility entails, except what
the self-help guides tell me.
What 1 want, against the quite
distant day when I become a
father, is something that tells
me what that responsibility
feels like, what it means, to
become a parent. I want an
imaginative articulation of
what it means to be a parent;
the fact that Kramer vs.
Kramer has been so popular
points to the fact that others
want the same thing.
Literature is full of the rela
tions of parents and children,
but the relationship is almost
always seen from the child's
point of view. One speaks of
comjng to terms with one's
mother-or father, bat not with
one's children. Most English
novels are about growing up,
or about relations between
adult men and women; these
are often combined, and the
result is a novel about court
ship. Parental irresponsibil
ity, such as Mr. Bennet's in
Pride and Prejudice is usually
dealt with cursorily, if at all.
The one great nineteenth cen
tury novel about parental in
adequacy, James' What
Maisie Knew, is told from the
viewpoint of a child.

One can speculate as to
vhy parenthood did not much
engage the nineteenth cen
tury novel. Nowadays we
'choose" whether or not to
become parents. Choosing to
do something increases one's

results; hence the trepidation

but it is not enough, and I do
not know that there can ever
be enough. But by the time I
become a parent, I think
there will be more to guide
me, and 1 find that reassuring.
