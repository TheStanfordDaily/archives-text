Tom Jones ★ ★
Friday, Kresge 7:30 & 9:45 p.m.
While sporadically very funny,
Tom Jones now seems dated by its
self-consciously clever style. The
movie mixes cutesy optical
techniques — a surfeit of
television-style trick wipes and
swish pans — with a chronic confu
sion about whether it is laughing
with its characters or at them. The
movie's unconventional narrative
technique must have been startling
in the early '60s; today it's at best
ignorable and at worst downright
irritating. Tony Richardson di
rected; Albert Finney has the title
role.

Gone With the Wind
Sunday* Mem Aud K p.m.
Best movie,fcver made.

Caligula
Lumiere, Sap Francisco
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the movie
that combines big-time stars (Mal
colm McDowell, Peter O'Toole)
with hard-core sex (you name it).
Unfortunately, these two groups
are mutually exclusive and the au
dience never learns if O'Toole is
truly deserving of his surname. This
overly violent movie purports to
tell a story of ancient Rome, but it
is really about the calculations of
buck-hungry magazine publishers
attempting one of history's greatest
tie-ins: a moving, grunting
Penthouse. If you want ancient
Rome, watch Ben Hur on TV. If
you want porn, take Caligula's $6
■ admission tag and see 24 quarter
peep shows. As entertainment,
Caligula doesn't deliver, and as art,
it is vile.

The War at Home ★★★★
Surf Theater, San Francisco
The Vietnam anti-war move
ment's answer to John Wayne and
Joe. You can see this documentary
on unrest at the University of Wis
consin and wallow in nostalgia and
then come home and put on the
Youngbloods or Jefferson
Airplane and wallow some more,
and think about why things have
changed and how they can change
back. Perfect for the '60s freak.
— Seth Zuckerman
The Fury-kit
Mountain View Theatre
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalma is a visual genius;
he achieves great sequences but he
never gets any tension building in
this mess about a telekinetic boy
and girl. The script is terrible and
the characterization is worse — but
DePalma doesn't seem to care. Yet
the movie's too nonsensical for
great horror and too serious for sa
tire. That's too bad, because the
climax»nas all the elements of clas

sic parody: John Cassavetes liter
ally gets blown up; we see his body
explode from six different camera
angles and at varying speeds. The
scene must be the ultimate in camp
horror. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick,
with his upcoming The Shining, will
make the stylized horror farce that
DePalma seems to hint at here.
— Ron Lillejord
The Rose ★
Mountain View Theatre
Really just another version of A
Star is Born, except that this one is
clothed with a 1969 setting and
centered on a character vaguely
based on Janis Joplin. But the
movie only makes three references
to '69, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and
drums than as Janis Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballvhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less than convincing in
the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.

Electric Horseman ★ ★★
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thought!ul feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a SI 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and. despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturcdness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
— R.L.
The Day of the Jackal irifif
New Varsity
Fred Zinnemann directed this
carefully crafted, well-paced thril
ler based on Frederick Forsyth's
novel. Edward Fox plays the Jac
kal, hired to assassinate Charles
deGaulle. The movie requires a
good deal of "willing suspension of
disbelief" from the audience, Bui
Zinnemann is so firmly in control

of the material tit at difficulties in
this area never surface.
R.L.
Sleuth ick-k
Festival Cinema, Palo Alto
This movie's parlor games begin
to drag about two-thirds of the way
tli rough, but the acting games more
than compensate Laurence Olivier
and Michael Caine romp gleefully
through Anthony Shaffer's exces
sively witty play about a two-man
English mystery where one
upmanship goes more than a little
too far.
— Re-

Chapter Two ★★
Park, Menio Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle
aged widower boy (James Caan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate, there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody self. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.

2001: .4 Space Odvssev ★★★★
Friday, Cubfocrley 7 & 9:30 p.m.
Stanley Kubrick's classic film
may somehow seem "primitive" by

current sci-fi movie standards, but
this movie still transcends any
genre labels. Kubrick's domination
of the medium in this overwhelm
ingly visual masterwork is so obvi
ous that you may overlook the im
portance of Arthur C. Clarke's
original idea. Clarke's conception
perfectly fits the grandeur of Kub
rick's style here, and the results are
unforgettable. Starring Keir Dullea
and Hal, the computer.

All That Jazz ★★★
Old Mill
Boh Fosse's thinl\ veiled exami-

nation of Ins own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result: frustrating!), the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious. hut it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All Thai Jazz- It's

hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

Hair ¥***
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director

Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy vision of America, but even in
those terms. Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.
— R.L.
10 ★★★
Century 21, San Jose
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
he right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for lack
of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid-life crisis

probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered. As an over-40 songwriter,
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
humbler, and Edwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek, that is. This poster-star just
may have found her "niche" as the
vacuous "10" the title refers to.
— R.L.
Being Their it it it
Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be
ing, in this comedy directed by Hal
Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife who is desperately seeking for
affection) but the film drags on as
we see more and more people be
taken in by Chance's one quality:
his ability to make people see in
him whatever they want — as
Chance rises by accident and in
spite of himself comes to the brink
of becoming the President of the
U.S.
Hie film is a cut against corrup
tion in politics, the generation
mesmerised by television and
empty metaphors about the sea
sons.
— Jiri Weiss
Kramer vs. Kramer it-kit '/2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
mov ie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate, almost Truffaut-like
character study of a div orced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is

the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.
— R.L.
Breaking 1 wav ★★★
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
A way may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to make his escape through
his talent on a bicycle.
—Mike Kohn
Norma Nat ★ ★★★
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in a tex
tile mill where she works. Sally
Held gives an assured and very
likeable performance as Norma
Rae; her days as "the Flying Nun"
seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on charac
terization than on action. Ron
Liebman co-stars as a New York
union agitator
J. iY|.
Rocky Horror Picture Show ★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
The camp classic of the '70s. To
try to describe this entertaining
mess dealing with transvestism and
various other forms of socially un
acceptable behavior would be as
absurd as trying to explain its cult
appeal. A great way to blow oft
Sunday night. Dress appropriatelv.
— R.L.
1941+++
Century 21, San Jose
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years. Like a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front — bodies fly all too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partially explain the very
harsh reaction of most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, frenzied comedic action may
be horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be-,
lushi.and Dan Aykroyd.Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater
