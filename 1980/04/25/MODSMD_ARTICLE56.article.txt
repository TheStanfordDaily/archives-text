Iran threatens to cut off oil exports
Iran threatened yesterday to cut off the West's vital Pcr
sianGulf oil lifeline if the I J ni ted States mines Iranian ports.
"We shall close the Persian Gulf at any price." Foreign
Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said in an interview with Ira
nian radio and television.
He did not say just how the Iranians might try to halt the
supertanker traffic out of the gulf, which accounts for some
60 percent of all world oil exports. But it they succeeded, it
would abruptly cut off 10 percent of the United States' oil.
and higher proportions for Western Europe and Japan.
The threat came as the Iranians edged closer to the Soviet
Union economically in the face of growing Western pres

The Soviets confirmed they would open their highway
system to increased Iranian traffic it President Jimmy Car
ter orders a blockade of Iranian seaports, and they an
nounced thev were resuming suspended negotiations to buy
Iranian natural gas.
The war in rebellious Kurdistan raged on. meanwhile. A
Turkish newspaper report told of hundreds killed in attacks
by the Iranian air force, and a Kurdish group appealed to
world organizations for help.
In Tehran, the 50 American hostages spent their 173 rd
da\ in capti\ ity.
Trade ban by West would hurt Iran
BRUSSELS, Belgium — A ban on exports to Iran by the
Western world and Japan would cut off almost 90 percent ot
the goods Iran from foreign countries. With friendlier
relations developing between Iran and the Soviet bloc. Iran
might turn to East Europe to fill the void.
Latest statistics from the British department of trade
show that in the first-nine months of 197« J. Iran relied on
West Germany for 23.9 perccnt of its imports, on the Un
ited States for 22.6 percent and on Japan for 1 3.2 percent.
Britain. France and ltalv supplied Iran with a combined
23.6 percent ot its imports during the same period.
On the other hand, the amount of those countries' ex
ports going to Iran is only one percent of their overall
exports, indicating Iran would be hurt far more by a ban
than the industrial nations.
The I nited States has ordered such a ban and the Euro
pean Common Market announced this week they would
join it unless there is "decisive progress" by May 1 7 toward
release of 53 American hostages held in Tehran since Nov.
4.
The Common Market members — Britain. France. Bel

But the cabinct at a special meeting, decided to postpone
a decision as to whether Japan would join the Common
Market in declaring an overall export ban. excluding only
food and medical supplies, by May 1 7 it Iran tails to make a
specific move toward releasing the hostages.
Norway and Portugal have ordered a full trade boycott of
Iran. Australia and Canada have said they would go along.

Anderson declares as independent
Rep. John Anderson (R-III.) declared his independent
candidacy for the White House yesterday. dropping his bid
for the Republican nomination and creating a new element
of uncertainty in a presidential race that seems to be getting
closer e\ ery day.
Lev elling equally sharp attacks on President Jimmy Car
ter and former Gov. Ronald Reagan, the GOP front runner.
Anderson claimed to have a chance in November because
of polls showing high voter dissatisfaction with both men.
Anderson contended that his loss of all six Republican
primaries in which he campaigned did not necessarily mean
he would do badly in the November general election.
Mov ing within hours of his announcement of an indepen
dent campaign. Anderson's campaign mailed 10.000 letters
yesterday to California backers to start a petition drive.
Anderson must collect signatures of 101,296 registered
California voters — one percent of the voters statewide —
between June 9 and Aug. 8 to win a place on the Nov. 4
presidential ballot as an independent.
In Austin. Texas. Reagan said there was "a terrible pos
sibility" that Anderson's reborn candidacy might throw the
November election into the House of Representatives.
Reagan said he was not seriously concerned it might

happen, but if it did — with Democrats holding the majority
in the House — "it's pretty obvious what would happen."
White House press secretary Jody Powell said it was too
early to predict the impact of an independent Anderson
candidacy on President Jimmy Carter's bid for re-election.
Neither would he say whether the Carter campaign would
go to court in an attempt to keep Anderson's name off the
November ballots.
Fed chairman aided silver speculators
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Re
serve Board, Paul Volcker. helped arrange up to $800
million in credit for the billionaire Hunt brothers of Texas
to help them pay their silver speculating debts, it was
learned yesterday.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Banking Commit
tee accused the board of appearing to violate its own credit
restraint directives through its involvement in the transac
tion. Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wis.) also said lie planned to
hold hearings on the development.
A government source, who did not want to be identified,
said Volcker gave his approval to the line of credit from
private banks in late March because of concern that the
financial problems of Nelson Bunker Hunt and William
Herbert Hunt placed some brokerage houses and banks in
potential jeopardy.
Volcker's approval apparently was deemed necessary be
cause the board had announced rigid restraints on credit
sought for speculative purposes two weeks earlier, on
March 14. The credit restraints are an integral part of the
government's anti-inflation program.
About $300 million of the $800 million credit line al
ready hiis been borrowed bv the Hunts to pay maturing
debts resulting from their sil\ er purchases, according to the
Los Angeles Times, which first reported Volcker's involve
ment.
Volcker was in Hamburg. Germany, for a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund yesterday and was not availa
ble for comment. A spokesman, Joseph Coyne, would
neither confirm nor deny the report.
U.S. Navy scrounges for missiles
WASHINGTON — The Navy has had to scrounge for
air-to-air missiles to arm its warplanes aboard carriers
stationed near the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said yes
terday.
" We've had to draw from other areas and put most of our
eggs in the Indian Ocean basket," said one source who
asked to remain anonymous.
Asked about reports that planes on the carriers Nimitz
and Coral Sea were short of Sidewinder. Sparrow and
Phoenix missiles, the Navy said it deploys its forces "with
sufficient munitions, including missiles, to perform their
assigned operational missions." The Navy would not go
beyond that statement.
However. Pentagon sources said there is an overall shor
tage of missiles used by jet fighters for air combat because
the Carter administration has for several years held down
money requests to Congress for such weapons.
As a result, these sources said, the Navy did have a
munitions problem in the Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea force
and acted to solve that problem by pulling supplies from
other places.
This, in turn, has strained the combat readiness of carriers
elsewhere, the sources said.
The new Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles will be im -
proved and more effective models, experts said.
The Air Force, which also is reported to have supply
problems, would experience sev ere reductions in purchases
ot new Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles under next year's
defense budget.
Lawmakers attack Jarvis-backed bill
SACRAMENTO — Stung by years of attacks from
Howard Jars is, Democratic state senators seized on a
Jarv is-backed bill yesterday as an occasion to heap scorn on
the author of Propositions 13 and 9.
The bill. SB 1464 by Senate Republican leader William
Campbell ot Hacienda Heights, would change the effective
date ot Proposition 9. if voters approv ed the June 3 ballot
measure.
Proposition 9 would cut state income tax rates in half.
Since state law makes all tax changes effective from the start
of the year in which they are passed, the tax cut would be
backdated to the start of 1980.
Campbell's bill, which Jarvis says expresses his original
intention, would delay the effective date until June 4, the
day after the election.

It would reduce the average 1980 state income tax cut
from 54 to 27 percent, and cut the state revenue loss for
fiscal 1980-81 from about $4.9 billion to $3.4 billion.
3 nuke laws ruled unconstitutional
SACRAMENTO — A federal judge, in ruling Califor
nia's three 1976 nuclear laws are unconstitutional, says the
state cannot regulate nuclear power plant construction or
operation at all.
U.S. District Judge Manuel Real of Los Angeles, sitting
as a visiting judge in Sacramento, is the second federal
judge to throw out the state nuclear laws.
He said the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
exclusive power over nuclear plants and the state Energy
Commission must not "regulate or monitor the construc
tion or operation of any nuclear power plant."
The Energy Commission, which appealed the first ruling,
said it would also appeal the new one and try to have the
appeals heard together in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeal in San Francisco.
Real, in a 35-page document issued late Wednesday,
ruled that the state could not make law s restricting nuclear

power because the 1954 federal Atomic Energy Act grants
the federal government final say over states in regulating
nuclear power plant construction and waste disposal. <
He said each of the laws "obstructs the accomplishments
and execution of the purpose of Congress, manifested in the
Atomic Energy Act, to promote the private development of
nuclear power plants as electrical energy sources in the
United States."
The suit challenging the laws was filed in October 1978
by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California
c dison Co.

Trade ban by West would hurt Iran
BRUSSELS, Belgium — A ban on exports to Iran by the
Western world and Japan would cut off almost 90 percent ot
the goods Iran from foreign countries. With friendlier
relations developing between Iran and the Soviet bloc. Iran
might turn to East Europe to fill the void.
Latest statistics from the British department of trade
show that in the first-nine months of 197« J. Iran relied on
West Germany for 23.9 perccnt of its imports, on the Un
ited States for 22.6 percent and on Japan for 1 3.2 percent.
Britain. France and ltalv supplied Iran with a combined
23.6 percent ot its imports during the same period.
On the other hand, the amount of those countries' ex
ports going to Iran is only one percent of their overall
exports, indicating Iran would be hurt far more by a ban
than the industrial nations.
The I nited States has ordered such a ban and the Euro

join it unless there is "decisive progress" by May 1 7 toward

Anderson declares as independent
Rep. John Anderson (R-III.) declared his independent
candidacy for the White House yesterday. dropping his bid
for the Republican nomination and creating a new element
of uncertainty in a presidential race that seems to be getting
closer e\ ery day.
Lev elling equally sharp attacks on President Jimmy Car
ter and former Gov. Ronald Reagan, the GOP front runner.
Anderson claimed to have a chance in November because
of polls showing high voter dissatisfaction with both men.
Anderson contended that his loss of all six Republican
primaries in which he campaigned did not necessarily mean
he would do badly in the November general election.
Mov ing within hours of his announcement of an indepen
dent campaign. Anderson's campaign mailed 10.000 letters
yesterday to California backers to start a petition drive.
Anderson must collect signatures of 101,296 registered
California voters — one percent of the voters statewide —
between June 9 and Aug. 8 to win a place on the Nov. 4
presidential ballot as an independent.
In Austin. Texas. Reagan said there was "a terrible pos
sibility" that Anderson's reborn candidacy might throw the
November election into the House of Representatives.
Reagan said he was not seriously concerned it might

happen, but if it did — with Democrats holding the majority
in the House — "it's pretty obvious what would happen."
White House press secretary Jody Powell said it was too
early to predict the impact of an independent Anderson
candidacy on President Jimmy Carter's bid for re-election.
Neither would he say whether the Carter campaign would
go to court in an attempt to keep Anderson's name off the
November ballots.
Fed chairman aided silver speculators
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Re
serve Board, Paul Volcker. helped arrange up to $800
million in credit for the billionaire Hunt brothers of Texas
to help them pay their silver speculating debts, it was
learned yesterday.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Banking Commit
tee accused the board of appearing to violate its own credit
restraint directives through its involvement in the transac
tion. Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wis.) also said lie planned to
hold hearings on the development.
A government source, who did not want to be identified,
said Volcker gave his approval to the line of credit from
private banks in late March because of concern that the
financial problems of Nelson Bunker Hunt and William
Herbert Hunt placed some brokerage houses and banks in
potential jeopardy.
Volcker's approval apparently was deemed necessary be
cause the board had announced rigid restraints on credit
sought for speculative purposes two weeks earlier, on
March 14. The credit restraints are an integral part of the
government's anti-inflation program.
About $300 million of the $800 million credit line al
ready hiis been borrowed bv the Hunts to pay maturing
debts resulting from their sil\ er purchases, according to the
Los Angeles Times, which first reported Volcker's involve
ment.
Volcker was in Hamburg. Germany, for a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund yesterday and was not availa

neither confirm nor deny the report.
U.S. Navy scrounges for missiles
WASHINGTON — The Navy has had to scrounge for
air-to-air missiles to arm its warplanes aboard carriers
stationed near the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said yes
terday.
" We've had to draw from other areas and put most of our
eggs in the Indian Ocean basket," said one source who
asked to remain anonymous.
Asked about reports that planes on the carriers Nimitz
and Coral Sea were short of Sidewinder. Sparrow and
Phoenix missiles, the Navy said it deploys its forces "with
sufficient munitions, including missiles, to perform their
assigned operational missions." The Navy would not go
beyond that statement.
However. Pentagon sources said there is an overall shor
tage of missiles used by jet fighters for air combat because
the Carter administration has for several years held down
money requests to Congress for such weapons.
As a result, these sources said, the Navy did have a
munitions problem in the Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea force
and acted to solve that problem by pulling supplies from
other places.
This, in turn, has strained the combat readiness of carriers
elsewhere, the sources said.
The new Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles will be im -
proved and more effective models, experts said.
The Air Force, which also is reported to have supply
problems, would experience sev ere reductions in purchases
ot new Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles under next year's
defense budget.
Lawmakers attack Jarvis-backed bill
SACRAMENTO — Stung by years of attacks from
Howard Jars is, Democratic state senators seized on a
Jarv is-backed bill yesterday as an occasion to heap scorn on
the author of Propositions 13 and 9.
The bill. SB 1464 by Senate Republican leader William
Campbell ot Hacienda Heights, would change the effective
date ot Proposition 9. if voters approv ed the June 3 ballot
measure.
Proposition 9 would cut state income tax rates in half.
Since state law makes all tax changes effective from the start
of the year in which they are passed, the tax cut would be
backdated to the start of 1980.
Campbell's bill, which Jarvis says expresses his original
intention, would delay the effective date until June 4, the
day after the election.

It would reduce the average 1980 state income tax cut
from 54 to 27 percent, and cut the state revenue loss for
fiscal 1980-81 from about $4.9 billion to $3.4 billion.
3 nuke laws ruled unconstitutional
SACRAMENTO — A federal judge, in ruling Califor
nia's three 1976 nuclear laws are unconstitutional, says the
state cannot regulate nuclear power plant construction or
operation at all.
U.S. District Judge Manuel Real of Los Angeles, sitting
as a visiting judge in Sacramento, is the second federal
judge to throw out the state nuclear laws.
He said the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
exclusive power over nuclear plants and the state Energy
Commission must not "regulate or monitor the construc
tion or operation of any nuclear power plant."
The Energy Commission, which appealed the first ruling,
said it would also appeal the new one and try to have the
appeals heard together in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeal in San Francisco.
Real, in a 35-page document issued late Wednesday,
ruled that the state could not make law s restricting nuclear

power because the 1954 federal Atomic Energy Act grants
the federal government final say over states in regulating
nuclear power plant construction and waste disposal. <
He said each of the laws "obstructs the accomplishments
and execution of the purpose of Congress, manifested in the
Atomic Energy Act, to promote the private development of
nuclear power plants as electrical energy sources in the
United States."
The suit challenging the laws was filed in October 1978
by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California

Trade ban by West would hurt Iran
BRUSSELS, Belgium — A ban on exports to Iran by the
Western world and Japan would cut off almost 90 percent ot
the goods Iran from foreign countries. With friendlier
relations developing between Iran and the Soviet bloc. Iran
might turn to East Europe to fill the void.
Latest statistics from the British department of trade
show that in the first-nine months of 197« J. Iran relied on
West Germany for 23.9 perccnt of its imports, on the Un
ited States for 22.6 percent and on Japan for 1 3.2 percent.
Britain. France and ltalv supplied Iran with a combined
23.6 percent ot its imports during the same period.
On the other hand, the amount of those countries' ex
ports going to Iran is only one percent of their overall
exports, indicating Iran would be hurt far more by a ban
than the industrial nations.
The I nited States has ordered such a ban and the Euro

join it unless there is "decisive progress" by May 1 7 toward
release of 53 American hostages held in Tehran since Nov.

Anderson declares as independent
Rep. John Anderson (R-III.) declared his independent
candidacy for the White House yesterday. dropping his bid
for the Republican nomination and creating a new element
of uncertainty in a presidential race that seems to be getting
closer e\ ery day.
Lev elling equally sharp attacks on President Jimmy Car
ter and former Gov. Ronald Reagan, the GOP front runner.
Anderson claimed to have a chance in November because
of polls showing high voter dissatisfaction with both men.
Anderson contended that his loss of all six Republican
primaries in which he campaigned did not necessarily mean
he would do badly in the November general election.
Mov ing within hours of his announcement of an indepen
dent campaign. Anderson's campaign mailed 10.000 letters
yesterday to California backers to start a petition drive.
Anderson must collect signatures of 101,296 registered
California voters — one percent of the voters statewide —
between June 9 and Aug. 8 to win a place on the Nov. 4
presidential ballot as an independent.
In Austin. Texas. Reagan said there was "a terrible pos
sibility" that Anderson's reborn candidacy might throw the
November election into the House of Representatives.
Reagan said he was not seriously concerned it might

happen, but if it did — with Democrats holding the majority
in the House — "it's pretty obvious what would happen."
White House press secretary Jody Powell said it was too
early to predict the impact of an independent Anderson
candidacy on President Jimmy Carter's bid for re-election.
Neither would he say whether the Carter campaign would
go to court in an attempt to keep Anderson's name off the
November ballots.
Fed chairman aided silver speculators
WASHINGTON — The chairman of the Federal Re
serve Board, Paul Volcker. helped arrange up to $800
million in credit for the billionaire Hunt brothers of Texas
to help them pay their silver speculating debts, it was
learned yesterday.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the House Banking Commit
tee accused the board of appearing to violate its own credit
restraint directives through its involvement in the transac
tion. Rep. Henry Reuss (D-Wis.) also said lie planned to
hold hearings on the development.
A government source, who did not want to be identified,
said Volcker gave his approval to the line of credit from
private banks in late March because of concern that the
financial problems of Nelson Bunker Hunt and William
Herbert Hunt placed some brokerage houses and banks in
potential jeopardy.
Volcker's approval apparently was deemed necessary be
cause the board had announced rigid restraints on credit
sought for speculative purposes two weeks earlier, on
March 14. The credit restraints are an integral part of the
government's anti-inflation program.
About $300 million of the $800 million credit line al
ready hiis been borrowed bv the Hunts to pay maturing
debts resulting from their sil\ er purchases, according to the
Los Angeles Times, which first reported Volcker's involve
ment.
Volcker was in Hamburg. Germany, for a meeting of the
International Monetary Fund yesterday and was not availa

neither confirm nor deny the report.
U.S. Navy scrounges for missiles
WASHINGTON — The Navy has had to scrounge for
air-to-air missiles to arm its warplanes aboard carriers
stationed near the Persian Gulf, Pentagon sources said yes
terday.
" We've had to draw from other areas and put most of our
eggs in the Indian Ocean basket," said one source who
asked to remain anonymous.
Asked about reports that planes on the carriers Nimitz
and Coral Sea were short of Sidewinder. Sparrow and
Phoenix missiles, the Navy said it deploys its forces "with
sufficient munitions, including missiles, to perform their
assigned operational missions." The Navy would not go
beyond that statement.
However. Pentagon sources said there is an overall shor
tage of missiles used by jet fighters for air combat because
the Carter administration has for several years held down
money requests to Congress for such weapons.
As a result, these sources said, the Navy did have a
munitions problem in the Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea force
and acted to solve that problem by pulling supplies from
other places.
This, in turn, has strained the combat readiness of carriers
elsewhere, the sources said.
The new Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles will be im -
proved and more effective models, experts said.
The Air Force, which also is reported to have supply
problems, would experience sev ere reductions in purchases
ot new Sparrow and Sidewinder missiles under next year's
defense budget.
Lawmakers attack Jarvis-backed bill
SACRAMENTO — Stung by years of attacks from
Howard Jars is, Democratic state senators seized on a
Jarv is-backed bill yesterday as an occasion to heap scorn on
the author of Propositions 13 and 9.
The bill. SB 1464 by Senate Republican leader William
Campbell ot Hacienda Heights, would change the effective
date ot Proposition 9. if voters approv ed the June 3 ballot
measure.
Proposition 9 would cut state income tax rates in half.
Since state law makes all tax changes effective from the start
of the year in which they are passed, the tax cut would be
backdated to the start of 1980.
Campbell's bill, which Jarvis says expresses his original
intention, would delay the effective date until June 4, the
day after the election.

It would reduce the average 1980 state income tax cut
from 54 to 27 percent, and cut the state revenue loss for
fiscal 1980-81 from about $4.9 billion to $3.4 billion.
3 nuke laws ruled unconstitutional
SACRAMENTO — A federal judge, in ruling Califor
nia's three 1976 nuclear laws are unconstitutional, says the
state cannot regulate nuclear power plant construction or
operation at all.
U.S. District Judge Manuel Real of Los Angeles, sitting
as a visiting judge in Sacramento, is the second federal
judge to throw out the state nuclear laws.
He said the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission has
exclusive power over nuclear plants and the state Energy
Commission must not "regulate or monitor the construc
tion or operation of any nuclear power plant."
The Energy Commission, which appealed the first ruling,
said it would also appeal the new one and try to have the
appeals heard together in the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeal in San Francisco.
Real, in a 35-page document issued late Wednesday,
ruled that the state could not make law s restricting nuclear

power because the 1954 federal Atomic Energy Act grants
the federal government final say over states in regulating
nuclear power plant construction and waste disposal. <
He said each of the laws "obstructs the accomplishments
and execution of the purpose of Congress, manifested in the
Atomic Energy Act, to promote the private development of
nuclear power plants as electrical energy sources in the
United States."
The suit challenging the laws was filed in October 1978
by Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California
