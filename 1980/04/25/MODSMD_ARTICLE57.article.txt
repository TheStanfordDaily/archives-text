### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
Gay men and lesbians are entering the 1980s with an
increasing sense of confidence, according to organizers
of this year's Gay Awareness Week here.
"Our confidence stems from society's recognition of
our political power, our realization that we can use it to
bring about changes, and the emergence of a new, open
gay culture," said Bob Nelson, a member of the Gay
People's Union steering committee.
Focusing on the political and cultural growth of gays,
the week opens today with a speech by the first openly
gay person to be appointed to the bench. Superior Court
Judge Stephen Lachs of Los Angeles. Appointed last
year by Gov. Jerry Brown, Lachs will appear at the Law
School at 4:15 as a guest of the Gay Law Students
Association.
San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt, successor to
slain Supervisor Harvey Milk, will speak at a noon rally
Tuesday <n White Plaza. He will be joined by Constance
Carpenter, co-chairperson of the Santa Clara County
Coalition for Human Rights, which is currently attempt
ing to defeat an initiative measure to repeal the county's
gay rights ordinance.
Despite the new-found confidence, Connie Nelson,
member of the steering committee and the Lesbian Dis
cussion Group here, pointed out some difficulties which

remain.
"Most of the lesbians on campus are undergoing per
sonal struggles to develop the inner strength to live
openly, without fear and guilt," she said. She said she
hopes the week will "educate the straight community on
what lesbians and gav men are going through, so that the
struggle will become easier, if not altogether unneces
sary."
A film, "In the Best Interests of the Children," which
explores the problems laced by lesbian mothers in child
custody cases, will be shown at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday in the
Women's Center.
The week's cultural events will include a performance
of the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus on Wednesday
at 8 p.m. at Dinkelspiel Auditorium, a reading by gay/
lesbian poets Karen Brodine. Rubert Gluck and Aaron
Shurin at 8 p.m. on Thursday in History Room 203, and
an evening of feminist, Third World and gay music at 8
p.m. Saturday, May 3 in Annenberg Auditorium.
The May 3 concert will include Casselberry & Dupree,
two black lesbians who sing a variety of folk, blues and
gospel music, and Steve Grossman, one of the first
openly gay male recording artists to release an album on
a major recording label.
In addition, the GPU is sponsoring an all-campus
dance from 9 p.m. to 2 p.m. next Friday at the Old
Firehouse.
