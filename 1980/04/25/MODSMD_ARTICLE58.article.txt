# LOTS 'crash' repaired
## 
### Cici Oremland Staff Writer 
A hardware malfunction that left
4000 LOTS users without facilities for
36 hours was repaired late yesterday
afternoon.
At about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday,
LOTS "crashed" and the LOTS office
said the computer was not at full
strength until several hours after the
problems were corrected. The Stanford
Digital Equipment Corp.. manufac
turer of the LOTS terminal and com
puters, stayed to examine the facilities
alter repairs had been made to insure
all problems had been corrected.
"The breakdowns are not usually so
unscheduled. But with so complex a
facility, if one little piece becomes
slightly flaky, it can be a major problem
to track down what is wrong," said
David Fuchs, a computer science in
structor.
For the many students who use

LOTS on a regular basis, a breakdown
36 hours long can be a crisis as longer
waiting lines for use of computer ter
minals become inevitable.
The deadline on a Computer Science
106 project assignment was extended
to Monday because of the crash.
•'lt's really frustrating to make
changes and then have it all blown
away if you didn't press (the) save (but
ton)," said one computer science stu
dent.
"My time is limited. 1 just can't wait
around for the computer to go back on
so 1 can do my work," he continued.
"It makes consulting impossible
when it's (the computer) going on and
off every five minutes. There isn't
enough time to make changes," said
one LOTS consultant.
Other not-so-heavily-used campus
computers are unavailable to LOTS
users. These computers are designed
for more specialized purposes.
