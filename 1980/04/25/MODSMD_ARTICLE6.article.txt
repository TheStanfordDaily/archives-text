## 
### Kathleen McClung Staff Writer 
I niversity officials have issued a
warning to fraternities that am further
destructi\ e incidents invo|\ mg alcohol
may result in loss of campus housing.
The warning came in a letter Dean of
Student Affairs James Lyons sent to
fraternity presidents earlier this week.
Lyons' letter follows a recent out
break of rush-related incidents which
•luJe h'H'k injuries to a woman stu
dent following a party at Delta Tan
Delta house, two male students who
suffered sprained ankles after jumping
from an 8-foot loft .it Kappa Alpha
house, and broken windows at a resi
dence adjacent to Delta I psilon house.
In his letter. Lyons stated that "a
recurrence of such incidents will he
cause to consider a strong University
response to the house or houses in
volved. Such a response could include
reassigning a house to another group or
making 11 a\ ailable as a room choice tor
all students in the draw."
But according to Inter-Fraternity
Council President John Kinney . I \ons'
letter was not intended as a threat

Whether a single incident would cause
the ouster ot the fraternities 1 think is a
little o\ erdramatic."
Lyons also disclosed plans to estab
lish a commission to review:
Whether fraternity selection pro
cesses interfere with academic or resi
dential lift.- at the University;
Whether fraternities ire respon
sible members of the campus commun
ity;
Whether fraternities take collec
tive responsibility foi actions oi their
individual members at house-ielated
events; and
Whether they collectively govern
common activities, such as rush.
The decision to establish the com
mission was based in part upon a report
submitted by the Row Office last week
to Norm Robinson, associate dean for
residential education.
"There were a lot of awful rumors
floating around. We tried to run them
down by interviewing several people
involved in the incidents," said Bill Ol
futt, acting assistant director of the
Row Office.
"The incidents in and of themselves

didn't look like a plan or a conspiracy,"
Oftutt added. "They all just came cas
cading in at the same time. Ihev looked
qualitati\ elv different from past inci
dents."
I Ins rush season "is not substantially
worse than past years. In fact, it's sub
stantially better," said Kinney.
I've noticed a considerable de
crease in alcohol use and a considera
ble increase in responsible drinking.

kinney outlined some ot the
"specific measures'" taken by the IK.
Rush Committee to decrease "irres

"We've required that non-alcoholic
alternatives he equally accessible at all
rush parties, that food must be served
to soak up the alcohol, and that no
rushee be served mixed drinks alter
10:30 p.m. and no beer or vvine after
12:30 a.m."
