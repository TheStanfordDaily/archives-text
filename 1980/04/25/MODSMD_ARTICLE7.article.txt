## Prof condones his violation of Honor Code

Chemistry l'rol. 1 1 ans Andersen said
Wednesday he would consciously viol
ate Stanford's Honor Code by proetor
ing exams and has already done so.
lie spoke at a forum of professors
and administrators on the general spirit

and unique character of the Universi
ty's Honor Code, faculty compliance
with the codc anil the responsibility of
students to turn in Honor Code vio
lators.
Andersen argued that teachers can
violate the Honor Code while students
should not. A teacher's proctoring \ io
lation is open and the professor accepts
full responsibility lor his actions, he
said. Andersen noted that the decision
to proctor an exam would be done for
the "benefit of the students to deter
would-be cheaters. But students who
violate the code do not assume respon
sibilif for their actions as cheating is
done in secret." he said.
Andersen pointed out that he had his
exams proctored five years ago when
there was talk of rampant cheating on
campus. He did not want his students
spending their energies on policing
others and feared that it a large percen
tage of students were cheating without
being caught, the rest would end up
cheating as well.
Ombudsman John Cioheen said,
however, that he was disturbed that
Andersen would violate the honor
code, arguing that the code "trans
cends everything." 112 he code is ,t bind
ing moral agreement between teachers

and students, according to Cioheen.
"Those who trust us. teach us."
Cioheen argued for the elimination
of the third-party responsibility section
of the code that requires students to
turn in peers for \ iolationsof the honor
code or else be in violation of the code
themseb es. 1 le called the honor system
here "strange" because it includes this
clause that many openly violate
Dr. James McClenahan, cx-offieio
member of the Honor C ode Commis
sion, called this ••policing clause" the
most difficult, but an extremely impor
tant part of the code.
While acknowledging tfu ostracism
and social pressures that often occur
with student reporting of peer viola
tions, McClenahan gave several
suggestions to aid students in turning in
a violator The first alternative is to
confront the suspected violator and ask
him to turn himself in. The next step
would be to point out the violation to
the professor and let him handle it from
there. He noted that there are a wide
variety of alternatives for punishing of
fenders ranging from a quarter's sus
pension to simply retaking an exam.
McClenahan praised the University
for the flexibility and benevolence of its
honor system.

Students and faculty benefit from the
Honor Code, established in l ( '21 at
student initiative, said Ph\sics Prof
Mason Yearian. former chairman of
the Student C onduct I egislativ e ( oun
eil. I acultv are relieved of the burden
of monitoring exams and students have
the take-home exams option and can
avoid the distasteful and degrading
practices, such as proetoring. that stu
dents elsewhere must face, he said.
Yearian added that faculty .ire sur
prisingly ignorant ol the code. He
noted that changing the percentage
tli.it a final exam will be worth in ligur
inc the total course grade is an honor
code violation.
Yearian said that closed-book
take-home tests or take-home exams
that set time limits less than the total
time the student should have for the
exam are 1 lonor Code violations as well.
At least one such case has occurred
during the past two years. Hie exam
results were invalidated.
Photocopying graded tests before
they are returned to the students to
ensure that students don't change their
answers and ask to be regarded has
been found acceptable under the code,
but requiring students to sign in and out
of the exam room is not, he said.
