## Miami receives Cubans 
### Ward Sinclair The Washington Post 
MIAMI — To judge from the
unfurling of Cuban flags and the
coffeeshop talk in sprawling Lit
tle Havana, one would have to
believe that counterrevolution is
nigh and 1 idel Castro's days are
numbered.
The heart of Miami's Cuban
exile community always has
throbbed to the beat ot such an
ticipation. but the excitement
this time is a little different, a
little more fervent.
Anti-Castro manifestos flower
on storefronts. Spanish
language radio exhorts exiles to
new levels of patriotism. Rallies
and marches are mounted. The
150 or so disparate exile political
groups are actually talking to one
another.
Counterrevolution
Counterrevolution and poli
tics are found here. Miami can
provide guns, armaments or spy
equipment. Illicit drugs from ab
road come in the large economy
size. Multilingual sects, alien
smuggling and the tools they re
quire are readily available.
Coincidences of geography
and climate, the hundreds of
miles of open coastline plus a
large and sympathetic Spanish
speaking population make this a
natural haven for the displaced
and ne'er-do-wells of the Carib
bean and Latin America.
Political, turmoil in the
Spanish-speaking countries is
soon felt here. In the 19505,
ousted Venezuelan dictator
Perez Jiminez and > cronies
came here. year, the
Nicaraguan re on sent dic
tator .last omoza nd
10,000 counii .i to tin !.
And South I iorida has a
launching pad for revolutions
the most lotah being the
Cuban independe ice movement
that culminated in the Spanish-
American War of 189 S. Cuban
liberal. Ji <. Marti did much of
his scheming in Florida.
Cuban connection
The Cuban connection con
tinues to be South Florida's most
constant engine of intrigue.
More than 500,000 Cubans have

come to Dade County since the
Castro revolution of 1959, and
many of them live in a state of
perpetual political anxiety.
Their current motivation is the
rumbling of discontent, or what
the exiles want to believe is dis
content, rolling out of Cuba
these days.
Arthur Nehrbass, special
agent in charge of the FBl's
Miami office, savs. "There is a
building fever in the Cuban
community. Many feel that Cas
tro is about to topple and a coun
terrevolution is coming. They
want to be near where the action
is."
The FBI official's observation
is quickly confirmed in the pros
perous and vivacious Cuban
neighborhood known as Little
Havana. southwest of
downtown
Restaurants abuzz
Restaurant patrons are abuzz
over the Peruvian Embassy
drama in Havana, a subject that
generates infinite theorizing and
speculating. Reports of crop fail
ure. animal disease uid food
shortages fuel the , cculation
about Castro's troubles.
Immigration, Customs. Coast
Guard. FBI and Alcohol-
Tobacco-Firearms agents all
have their eyes on political ac
ti\ ists and terrorists, as well as on
arms traffickers and purv eyorsof
turpitude.
"With the Cuban immigrants,
we have a counter-intelligence
interest to assure that Castro
hasn't shipped in agents," the
FBl's Nehrbass said. "And we
are involved because of the
domestic violence i. organiza
ti is like Onn 7 and Alpha
b'\ ' rabid n astro groups.
Tn.de monitored
• " stoma and ATF agents
monitor the arms trade, which is
huue. according to Bob Nun
nery. special agent in v . . of
U.S. Customs operati.
"There is an unusuu > large
number of gun scalers here, and
a lot of the trade is legitimate
with South and Central Ameri
cans," Nunnery said. "But be
cause of politics, when they need
arms, they tend to come here

also."
Nunnery cited recent illicit
arms purchases by people from
Honduras, El Salvador,
Nicaragua, Panama and Gre
nada — nations all having vary
ing degrees of political upheaval.
Weapons traffic
Among the vendors of militar)
items are Sherwood Interna
tional Export Corp.. which ad
vertises itself as one of the
world's largest ordnance
suppliers, and Focus Scientific
and Electronics, which adver
tises CIA equipment for sale —
infrared gunsights, electronic
pistols and other necessities.
Dave Tucker, director of ATF
activities, added. "There is a
huge traffic in weapons. You can
triple your money by selling in
Central and South America. We
really touch the surface of this."
The other big intrigue, of
course, is the illicit drug trade,
which has spawned gang warfare
here and drawn traffickers from
all over. Enormous as the drug
seizure statistics are. enforce
ment officials concede that they
are fighting a losing battle —
they won't even estimate how
much they miss.
