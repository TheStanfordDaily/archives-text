American Express hasn't changed its application qualifi
cations for graduating students during the current credit crisis.
That's because the American Express® Card isn't a credit
card. It's a charge card. There's no revolving, open-end credit
You are expected to pay your bill in full every month. So with the
Card, you don't get in over your head.
You use your head.
American Express is continuing its special application
plan for graduating students. If you have a $10,000 job (or the
promise of one) lined up, you can apply for an American Express
Card right now.
You'll need the Card for everything from business lunches
to vacations, from buying clothes to buying theatre tickets.
You'll have new responsibilities after graduation. The
American Express Card will help you manage them. HHH
To apply for a Card, just pick up an application
at one of the displays on campus. Or you can call the toll- KfcßH,
free number 800-528-8000, and ask for a special student application.
The American Express Card. Don't leave school without it.
