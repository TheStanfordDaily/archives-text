# Conflict with Carter over rescue attempt
## Cyrus Vance resigns in protest 
### 
From the Daily wire services
WASHINGTON â€” Secretary of
State Cyrus Vance resigned last night
over disagreement with President Car
ter on the mission to rescue American
hostages in Iran.
There was no official announcement
of the resignation, hut it was learned
that Vance was the only member of the
National Security Council to oppose
the ill-fated rescue mission.
An administration official said that
Carter and Vance agreed that under
the circumstances it would not he ap
propriate for Vance to continue as sec
retary of state. *
Associates close to Vance expressed
surprise at word of the resignation, al
though they confirmed he had been
opposed to the rescue attempt.

In recent months, Vance had been
increasingly out of public view and
there had been reports of substantial
differences on Iranian policy between
Vance and national security adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski.
Brzezinski is a hard-liner who is
known to have been enthusiastically in
support of the rescue mission.
The stunning word of Vance's resig
nation comes at a time when Carter is
perceived to have increasing difficulty
with his re-election bid.
There was no immediate indication
of who would take Vance's place. He
had said he would be leaving at the end
of the four-year presidential term, even
il Carter is re-elected, and Warren
Christopher, the deputy secretary of
state, has been considered a leading

prospect to succeed him.
A theory has persisted from the start
that Brzezinski, like Kissinger, would
like to move from the national security
adviser's job to secretary of state. But
last month, Brzezinski told a women's
Democratic group that his choice for a
new secretary was Christopher, a slight
Los Angeles lawyer who served in the
Justice Department during the
Johnson administration.
Christopher recently has taken on a
number of travel missions that nor
mally would have been Vance's, includ
ing efforts to persuade European lead
ers to support Carter's economic sanc
tions against the Soviet Union for the
Soviets' intervention in Afghanistan.
Vance, 63, is a veteran of the Demo
cratic foreign policy establishment

whose international views underwent a
major shift during the Vietnam war. A
former deputy defense secretary, he
became a quiet advocate of conciliation
and a low-keyed approach to world
problems.
One of his principal interests, a trans
ition to black rule in Rhodesia, was
accomplished largely through the of
fices of the British government. But in
arms control and human rights, Vance
saw once-favored Carter policies take a
back seat to growing confrontation
with the Soviet Union.
The high point of Vance's tenure as
secretary of state was the Israel-Egypt
peace treaty that was negotiated with
his intensive mediation including
Cairo-Jerusalem shuttle diplomacy in
December of 1978.
