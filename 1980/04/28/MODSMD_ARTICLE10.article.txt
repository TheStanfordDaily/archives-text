All the Iranian militants want from the United
Suites is acknowledgement of the truth and accep
tance ol responsibility, according to Paul Johnston,
a labor organizer in San Francisco.
Johnston. 28. who addressed students at Theta
Chi co-op last week, was in\ ited to visit Iran by the
militants themselves and representatives from a
cross-section of political and church organizations
interested in basic human rights.
During the visit. Johnston said the militants
urged that "the truth of the incredible bloodshed
and trauma of the Iranian people be conveyed."
The delegation Johnston traveled with consisted
of 4S) \ isitors. They were shown the roots of Iranian
aggression towards the United States.
"The militants were trying to convey their politi
cal and religious outlook," Johnston said. "We
\ isited old prisons, talked to members of the ruling
council, spoke with SAVAk agents in prison and
saw the "cemetary of the Martyrs.' Throughout
our time in Iran we were the focus of the students.
We were exposed to some heavy things."
Open communication
Johnston said both sides, the militant students
and the visitors, wanted open communication. He
said the visiting delegates tried to show Iran's im
pact on the United States through "Iran sucks"
buttons and advertising that utilizes Khomeini's
image. He said the delegates made it clear the
Iranian crisis was an emotional issue in the United
States.
"We told them they can't expect the U.S. to rise
up as a revolutionary mass," Johnston said. "They
must deal with us on a more sophisticated level."
Johnston and the other visitors stayed at the
Jerusalem Hotel, just down the street from the
American Hmbassy, where the hostages were
being held.
"Our hotel was surrounded by documentation"
of the trauma and bloodshed in Iran. Johnston said.
"We met people who had been paralyzed due to
torture and families whose children were buried at
the Cemetary of the Martyrs."
Carter doll
Johnston said the Iranian people showed him a
Jimmy Carter Human Rights doll that covers its
eyes when a string is pulled, symbolizing blindness
and hypocrisy.
Most of the Iranian aggression towards the Un

ited States stems from U.S. aid in their country's
modernization. Johnston said. With America's
help. Iran was transformed, repressing resistance.
"The day after Black Friday when 3000 Iranians
were shot in the Square of the Martyrs for refusing
to return to their homes. Carter called the shah."
Johnston said. "He said he was sorry about the
violence but gave continued support to the shah's
program of Westernization."
Revolution
Johnston said the militants holding the embassy
are "true believers in the Islamic revolution" and
"they feel a government of the oppressed will be
formed eventually, through revolution."
Most of the militants are still in school and range
in age from IS to 24. They are different culturally
from us. Johnston said, "because they have more
practical experience and a more serious, but
idealistic attitude.
"It is not easy for them to escape reality." he
said.
Iranian awareness
Johnston is on the Committee for Iranian-
American Crisis resolution, a nationwide organiza
tion that formed after Iranian students here were
harrassed. Among the group's accomplishments
are sending the clergy to Iran at Christmas and
Easter and a working plan to send hostages'
families to visit them.
Since the delegation's return to the United
States, the committee has sought to educate the
American public about the visit, which received no
press coverage in the United States.
At the time of their visit, the United States press
had been expelled from Iran but reporters with the
delegation sent out reports of the daily activities.
Johnston said he believes the reports were suppres
sed. Before the trip, members of the delegation
phoned the major wire services to inform them of
the visit.
"We were told the situation was too complicated
and not important enough to cover." Johnston
said.
Repercussions
Johnston, who attended Stanford for a short
time, pointed out the international repercussions
of American actions in Iran.
"As students, it is important that you exercise
compassion and moral responsibility for the ac
tions of your own government." Johnston told the
audience.
