KEY WEST, Fla. — Cuban and U.S. Coast
Guard rescue vessels searched the stormy waters
off the Florida Straits yesterday after receiving re
ports that two "Freedom Flotilla" boats — one
carrying 200 refugees — were sinking.
The two boats were bound for Florida in turbu
lent seas and strong, gusty winds Saturday when
the first distress calls came into the Coast Guard.
One of the boats reported it had 200 persons
aboard and the other said it had 10 to 15.
The distress calls also were among dozens re
ceived by Coast Guard officials and ham radio
operators.
One ham radio operator reported that a Soviet
freighter sank two small boats, but the Coast
Guard said it could not confirm the report. It could
not be learned how many people were supposed to
have been aboard the boats or when or where the
collisions occurred.
Lt. Roland Isnor of the Coast Guard's Key West

station said a ham radio operator reported "that a
Russian freighter had run down two vessels and
that they sank."
A Coast Guard duty off icer, who asked not to be
identified, said there was no other evidence of a
collision or intentional ramming.
The boats reported to be sinking were reported
to be in trouble off Cuba's northern coast. A small
vessel was later found in the area, capsized and
deserted, and the Coast Guard said it may have
been one of the two that reported they were in
distress.
Five Coast Guard cutters were in the area Sun
day and four others were steaming toward it.
The Coast Guard said distress calls were re
ceived from dozens of other small craft as inexperi
enced skippers ran into trouble in the 90-mile cros
sing.
Three boats carrying 523 people arrived in Key
West overnight, bringing the total number of
Cuban refugees who have arrived in Forida since
April 20 to about 3000.
