# Crisis threatens Cambodian life

The fate of the Cambodian race could be
determined within the next six months, Lou
Werner, a Cambodian relief organizer,
warned at a campus presentation last week.
He said much depends on whether rice seeds
are planted within the next three or four
weeks — before the big rains begin.
Werner, recently returned from a trip
through the Cambodian countryside, is co
founder of Operation California, a private
volunteer organization that has sent $6 mill
ion in supplies to Cambodia in a series of nine
missions.
Also at the presentation was Heinrich
Schmelzer, who worked for six weeks as a
surgeon in a Cambodian refugee camp dur
ing January and February.
Holocaust
Werner called the situation in Cambodia
"a condition of human suffering paralleling
the holocaust of World War II." Since last
November, thousands of Cambodians have
been dying every day, Werner said, with
nearly SO percent of the children experienc
ing severe malnutrition. Many Cambodians
suffer from malaria, skin diseases, and de
hydration, and the majority of women have
amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation),
which makes them unable to reproduce.
Although more than 50 nations have
pledged more than $200 million in aid to
Cambodia, distribution of relief food and
supplies is seriously hindered by the coun
try's unstable political situation, according to
a progress report published by the San
Francisco-based Hunger Project.
In April 1975, the Khmer Rouge, under
Pol Pot, seized Phnom Penh and ordered the
evacuation of all urban areas so as to estab
lish an agrarian socialist state. Intellectuals

were tortured and murdered, and the coun
try's entire infrastructure was destroyed.
So far, the Vietnamese have been un
cooperative about distributing relief food
and supplies, which they fear will fall into the
hands of the Khmer Rouge, Werner said.
The government has prohibited airlifts and
truck convoys to remote areas. Rice seeds
are "literally stacking Up at the Phnom Penh
airport," he said.
Meanwhile, the Thais and Vietnamese are
"at a stage of semiwarfare reminiscent of the
early days of the Vietnam war." he said.
Much of the fighting is taking place along the
border between Thailand and Cambodia
(the Green border).
Battles
"Thert are four main groups battling in
Cambodia: the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer
Blanc, the Vietnamese, and the Thais,"
Werner explained. "And they're all using
food as a weapon, by withholding it from one
another."
But despite logistical problems, at leasi
some of the supplies do reach the people.
Goods arriving at the Phnom Penh airport or
at the country's two deep-water harbors are
distributed within the country via rail, truck
or oxcart. Supplies are also flown to Thailand
and then trucked to refugee camps in the
Green Border.
The camps, largely under the jursisdiction
of UNICEiF. the International Red Cross,
and Oxfam, collectively house more than
500,000 refugees, with more arriving daily.
Most refugees live in huts made of bamboo
and plastic sheets and own nothing hut a few
pots, said Schmelzer.
Continually attacked
The camps are attacked continually by var
ious military groups — Khmer Rouge, Viet
namese and Thais. Mines surround many of

the camps, and people are injured by explo
sions every day, Schmelzer said.
But he said the biggest problems are
"hygiene, lack of food, and lack of shelter
from the cold at night." Often these difficul
ties are aggravated by the naivete of the re
fugees themselves. Many trade food and es
sential medicine for blankets. Hungry chil
dren eat dirt. And mothers often pinch their
babies — it's a Khmer superstition that this is
beneficial — so hard that there is no place for
doctors to insert IVs (intervenous devices),
Schmelzer said.
In general, Werner said he is dissatisfied
with the relief organizations at work in Cam
bodia. He criticized them on three grounds:
— that they give out inaccurate and con
flicting statistics, thereby discouraging
would-be donors;
— that they compete and bicker with one
another to the point of inefficiency;
— that they tend to be prejudiced for or
against certain nations.
Relief organizations 'bandaids'
"The relief organizations are little more
than bandaids," he said. "The best chance of
remedy is for the governments of the U.S.,
the Soviet Union and China to abandon
geopolitical orientations and concentrate on
providing strictly humanitarian aid." Cur
rently. China, concerned about encircle
ment. supports only the Khmer Rouge. Rus
sia is aiding Vietnam so as to maintain it as a
defense zone and the U.S. is reluctant to
collaborate with Vietnam or involve itself
with Southeast Asia at all, Werner said.
But according to Werner, the U.S. must
normalize relations with Vietnam to help the
Cambodians effectively. "The only way to
save the Cambodians is to gain permission to
begin massive airlifts of supplies and to begin
building roads," he said.

or oxcart. Supplies are also flown to Thailand
and then trucked to refugee camps in the
Green Border.
The camps, largely under the jursisdiction
of UNICEiF. the International Red Cross,
and Oxfam, collectively house more than
500,000 refugees, with more arriving daily.
Most refugees live in huts made of bamboo
and plastic sheets and own nothing hut a few
pots, said Schmelzer.
Continually attacked
The camps are attacked continually by var
ious military groups — Khmer Rouge, Viet
namese and Thais. Mines surround many of

the camps, and people are injured by explo
sions every day, Schmelzer said.
But he said the biggest problems are
"hygiene, lack of food, and lack of shelter
from the cold at night." Often these difficul
ties are aggravated by the naivete of the re
fugees themselves. Many trade food and es
sential medicine for blankets. Hungry chil
dren eat dirt. And mothers often pinch their
babies — it's a Khmer superstition that this is
beneficial — so hard that there is no place for
doctors to insert IVs (intervenous devices),
Schmelzer said.
In general, Werner said he is dissatisfied
with the relief organizations at work in Cam
bodia. He criticized them on three grounds:
— that they give out inaccurate and con
flicting statistics, thereby discouraging
would-be donors;
— that they compete and bicker with one
another to the point of inefficiency;
— that they tend to be prejudiced for or
against certain nations.
Relief organizations 'bandaids'
"The relief organizations are little more
than bandaids," he said. "The best chance of
remedy is for the governments of the U.S.,
the Soviet Union and China to abandon
geopolitical orientations and concentrate on
providing strictly humanitarian aid." Cur
rently. China, concerned about encircle
ment. supports only the Khmer Rouge. Rus
sia is aiding Vietnam so as to maintain it as a
defense zone and the U.S. is reluctant to
collaborate with Vietnam or involve itself
with Southeast Asia at all, Werner said.
But according to Werner, the U.S. must
normalize relations with Vietnam to help the
Cambodians effectively. "The only way to
save the Cambodians is to gain permission to
begin massive airlifts of supplies and to begin
building roads," he said.

The fate of the Cambodian race could be
determined within the next six months, Lou
Werner, a Cambodian relief organizer,
warned at a campus presentation last week.
He said much depends on whether rice seeds
are planted within the next three or four
weeks — before the big rains begin.
Werner, recently returned from a trip
through the Cambodian countryside, is co
founder of Operation California, a private
volunteer organization that has sent $6 mill
ion in supplies to Cambodia in a series of nine
missions.
Also at the presentation was Heinrich
Schmelzer, who worked for six weeks as a
surgeon in a Cambodian refugee camp dur
ing January and February.
Holocaust
Werner called the situation in Cambodia
"a condition of human suffering paralleling
the holocaust of World War II." Since last
November, thousands of Cambodians have
been dying every day, Werner said, with
nearly SO percent of the children experienc
ing severe malnutrition. Many Cambodians
suffer from malaria, skin diseases, and de
hydration, and the majority of women have
amenorrhea (cessation of menstruation),
which makes them unable to reproduce.
Although more than 50 nations have
pledged more than $200 million in aid to
Cambodia, distribution of relief food and
supplies is seriously hindered by the coun
try's unstable political situation, according to
a progress report published by the San
Francisco-based Hunger Project.
In April 1975, the Khmer Rouge, under
Pol Pot, seized Phnom Penh and ordered the
evacuation of all urban areas so as to estab
lish an agrarian socialist state. Intellectuals

were tortured and murdered, and the coun
try's entire infrastructure was destroyed.
So far, the Vietnamese have been un
cooperative about distributing relief food
and supplies, which they fear will fall into the
hands of the Khmer Rouge, Werner said.
The government has prohibited airlifts and
truck convoys to remote areas. Rice seeds
are "literally stacking Up at the Phnom Penh
airport," he said.
Meanwhile, the Thais and Vietnamese are
"at a stage of semiwarfare reminiscent of the
early days of the Vietnam war." he said.
Much of the fighting is taking place along the
border between Thailand and Cambodia
(the Green border).
Battles
"Thert are four main groups battling in
Cambodia: the Khmer Rouge, the Khmer
Blanc, the Vietnamese, and the Thais,"
Werner explained. "And they're all using
food as a weapon, by withholding it from one
another."
But despite logistical problems, at leasi
some of the supplies do reach the people.

at the country's two deep-water harbors are
