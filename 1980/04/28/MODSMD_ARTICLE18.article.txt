Ethnicity really doesn't have anything
to do with securing a job in the mass
media, according to a panel of journalists
that spoke in the Zapata lounge Wednes
day night.
Ron Castro of K.YA radio, Jim Avila of
KPIX-TV, and Ron Gonzales of the San
Jose Mercury-News spoke on the role of
Chicanos in the mass media, a career dis
cussion panel sponsored by the CPPC.
•• Don't believe you're getting a job just
because you're a minority. You're getting
the job because you're good. Ninety per
cent of the job is confidence," said Gon
zales who received his journalism degree
from the graduate program at UC-
Berkeley.
"Journalism is always what I wanted to
do; being a minority never really made a
difference," Avila said. "It may have
been a benefit being half Mexican-
American, but 1 consider myself a paid
obsyrver, not a participant in stories," he
sam.
"I would feel insulted being assigned

only minority stories, because then I
would only be fulfilling a stereotype. 1 feel
responsible to all minority communities,"
Avila added.
Gonzales said that he received his first
job offer with a newspaper in Riverside
"because they needed a reporter to cover
Casa Blanca, a semi-tough barrio."
The Chicanos tended to have a bad
image of the newspaper as well as the
district attorney's office, police and city
hall because of the negative coverage the
paper gives the Chicano community.
"Even though the animosity they held for
me as a reporter was more against an in
stitution, it became very frustrating for
me to cover minorities and Chicanos
fulltime," Gonzales said.
Asked whether having a Latino name
affects his credibility, Castro, who is Cu
ban, answered. "I've never felt ethnically
assaulted because of my name. I think
people believe I am a part of what they are
because of my name, but out of the com
munity I don't think anyone considers it. I
haven't gotten negative feedback because
of my name."

Avila was more opinionated. "If a vie
wer is rednecked enough to let a name
like Avila bother him, I don't care. In field
reporting I conduct myself as a profes
sional, and if it bothers a viewer because I
have darker skin, I don't care," he said.
As far as breaking into radio, Castro
said FCC management and ownership
laws have been reworked to make it easier
for minorities to get a job. Because a cer
tain percentage of a station's employees
must be minorities for the FCC to renew
its license, many stations now have minor
ity training .programs.
"Before, the doors were sort of par
tially closed, and now they're wide open,"
Castro said.
Despite the increasingly easy accessibil
ity of radio, Castro stressed "working
anywhere to get experience. .You don't
even have to like what you're reading
over the air, just get that time on the air,"
he said.
All three panelists recommended hav
ing an area of expertise. "You're going to
start small: small towns, small stations
and small salaries, so you're going to have

to be able to offer something more than
just being a disc jockey," said Castro who
got into radio with an engineering in
terest.
And even though a college degree isn't
absolutely necessary. "It helps in getting
that first job," Avila said.
"I graduated from Northwestern and
got a job as a coffee pourer, which the
station called a 'department assistant.' In
journalism it's necessary to have a good
liberal arts education so that you know a
little bit about a lot," Avila said.
In print media, "Newspapers are so
competitive that it is almost necessary to 112
have a college degree, just to show that
you have something to offer," Gonzales I
said. He suggested economics, law or
political science as a major.
Unlike Avila and Gonzales, Castro did
not graduate with a collcge degree in
journalism, but he summarized the
panel's opinion that "it's all in how you
perform. The performance aspect rather
than a college degree is most important
because there's a lot of educated idiots
who can't perform. All you really need is
skill and talent," Castro said.
