# From beds to cookies
## Students practice free enterprise

If the business of America is
business, students here are sup
porting their country.
Hawking everything from
beds to bands, student entrep
reneurs here concur on at least
one point: establishing a small
business is time-consuming.
Take junior Brett Kingstone,
for example. The owner
operator of Kingstone Bedding
Warehouse in San Carlos, said,
"1 have to operate it (the busi
ness) like an extra-curricular ac
tivity."
Kingstone, who sells electric
adjustable beds at prices 30 to 50
percent below the nationally ad
vertised prices, keeps overhead
costs low and saves time by main
taininga phone service to take all
his business calls. He usually sets
up appointments one day a
week, transporting his models to
clients' homes in a rented van.
He devotes the rest of his time to
studies and Stanford-related ac
tivities.
Kingstone said he got the idea
to market the "beds with a
thousand fingers" when he
realized the nationally adver
tised brands must be shipped
from New York, and he could
deliver to local customers more
quickly and efficiently from a
local warehouse.

"l wasn't sure how profitable
the business would be, so I main
tained my job with the Univer
sity the first two months of my
business operation," he said.
"Not until 1 was secure that my
business was profitable did 1 quit
my job."
Kingstone worked for the
University Research Libraries
Group. He said the money he
makes selling the "high ticket,
low-overhead product" is at
least double his hourly wage
earnings there.
"1 expected to make more
money than working at a part
time job, but 1 didn't expect to
make a fortune," Kingstone said.
Tax breaks
He said the main advantage to
running his own business came in
the form of tax benefits. Kings
tone approached the Internal
Revenue Service and asked them
which expenses were legitimate
to write oft. He said his business
pays his education expenses, and
travel, phone and gas expenses.
Only expenses related to the
business and expenses that are
seen to improve his professional
skills can be written off by his
business, the economics major
said.
Kingstone said he didn't have
to invest a lot to start the busi
ness. He arranged with his
warehouseman to pay him 10
percent of all sales, rather than a
monthly rental fee. The beds sell
for $600 to $1200 each.
Although he does not plan to
continue the business next year,
he said at the end of the summer,
"I will have been in business 5V2
months. I will have received a
return on my investment and 1
will have learned an incredible
amount, which was all I intended
to accomplish."
Spin-off
As a spin-off ofHiis bedding
warehouse, Kingstone is writing
a booklet entitled The Student
Entrepreneur's Guide: How to
Start Your Own Part-Time Small
Business.
He said marketing the booklet
would be another business in it
self. He has already spoken to
publishers and intends to sell the
guide through college
bookstores and mailorder out
lets.
Not marketing a product, but
clearly in a successful business,
are Jamie Halper and Tim Ouin
lan. Together they run a booking
agency for bands.
Auditions in bars
The business, called T & B As
sociates, books about half the

bands that play on campus,
Halper said. He said the job is
time-consuming because he has
to go to bars to hear bands play
and audition them.
Rather than charging a com
mission, which was the way the
business worked before it was
passed along to Halper and
Quinlan two years ago, they
charge a flat fee of $25 per book
ing. Halper said by charging a
flat rate the firm carries more
credibility because clients aren't
wondering which portion of their
money goes to an agent and
which goes to the band itself.
Halper said that in the past, T
& B had some difficulty dealing
with agents and decided to
change the policy to a more up
front approach. He said the bus
iness makes about $500 per
quarter. There are no overhead
costs, as most of the business is
carried on by word of mouth and
phone calls are placed to his
home.
Now juniors, Halper and
Quinlan are preparing to pass
the business along to two
sophomores. It was given to
them by a junior here two years
ago.
Not just a smile
Also working in the arts,
sophomore David Gottfried has
established The Soft Image, a
photography portrait business
aimed at capturing the subject's
character rather than "just their
smile."
"The difference is that it's all
shot outdoors and I'm trying to
understand the people 1 shoot
before I shoot them. More than a
snapshot, which is just a smile, I
try to convey the essence of the
person."
Gottfried's work, mostly in
black and white, sells for about
$40 for an 8-x- 10-inch portrait.
He began his business at the
beginning of spring quarter, in
vesting $400 worth of personal
funds.
But, he said the main incentive
for this project is not photo
graphy nor money. He said he is
really interested in formulating
and starting his own business and
photography fit well for a part
time student business because
"it's something I do that's better
than most."
He said he will continue The
Soft Image for about a year, and
if it's not profitable by then, he
will shift his business endeavors
to other fields.
"I'm willing to fail. I'm willing
to get nailed, simply because I
want to learn," he said.
Hello, Deli!
One business venture on cam
pus has had the time to learn and
is clearly doing well — Hello
Deli. It started fall quarter and
delivers sandwiches in the even
ings to Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
Florence Moore Hall and
Lagunita Court in the evening
hours.
A partner. Brad Heinz, said
"In terms of profitability, it's not
very profitable. It serves more as
a service for people. A lot of
people like us because even
though it's not very profitable,
we're not going to quit now."
He said if there is a net profit
at the end of the quarter, he di

vides it between the four
partners involved, but "we've
never even made a three-digit fi
gure."
Employees of the service
make $4.50 to $5.50 an hour.
They used to be paid a commis
sion of 25 cents per sandwich,
but were dissatisfied, so the pay
scale was changed. Heinz said it
actually comes out to be about
the same.
Hello Deli does not concern
itself with payroll taxes "because
nobody makes enough per quar
ter to be responsible for payroll
taxes." He said he purchased a
basic bookkeeping kit at a store
which serves the firm's needs.
Owners deliver
All employees of Hello Deli
deliversandwiches, including the
owners. "It's like a communica
tions thing," Heinz said. "If
you're directly selling, you can
find out what they (the custom
ers) want to eat."
The sandwiches, sold between
10 p.m. and 1 1:30 p.m. Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday nights,
sell for $1.90.
On a similar note, Greg War
wick has started Cookie Craze, a
door-to-door chocolate chip
cookie business. Warwick, a
senior, purchases the cookies for
25 cents from The Cookie Stop
in Palo Alto and sells them for 35
cents in the dormitories. Row
houses, fraternities and inde
pendent houses.
'Pretention of business 1
"This is something that is
fairly easy for anyone to do,"
Warwick said. "It has been done,
informally, before. But under
the pretention of a business, it's
easier to sell for a profit. I plan to
sell for 35 cents a cookie and
make 10 cents per cookie sold. 1
feel that is a reasonable profit
considering the services re
ndered."
He pointed out that students
do not have to get in their cars,
use their gas and interrupt their
studies when they get a case of
"the munchies" as long as they
know the Cookie Craze will be
along between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.
Once established. Warwick
plans to prov ide a phone number
for students who want to order
more than a dozen cookies. The
call will have to be placed a cer
tain time before the cookies are
needed.
Warwick said he came up with
the idea in January, basing it on
the success of two other busines
ses that cater to students here —
Pizza Express and Hello Deli.
$15 an hour
Ordering 600 cookies per
night and working only four
hours, Warwick will make $15
an hour. But like Kingstone did
atfirst. he has kept his University
job as a safeguard.
Student entrepreneurs here
agree their businesses have
taught them things they couldn't
learn as employees and for that
reason, some have continued
operations on break-even basis.
For them, the experience of run
ning a business is important
enough in itself that they don't
necessarily need the added in
centive of profits.
But then, the business of
America is business.

Pizza Express and Hello Deli.

Ordering 600 cookies per

atfirst. he has kept his University
job as a safeguard.

agree their businesses have
taught them things they couldn't
learn as employees and for that
reason, some have continued
operations on break-even basis.
For them, the experience of run

necessarily need the added in

one point: establishing a small
business is time-consuming.
Take junior Brett Kingstone,
for example. The owner
operator of Kingstone Bedding
Warehouse in San Carlos, said,
"1 have to operate it (the busi

Kingstone, who sells electric
adjustable beds at prices 30 to 50
percent below the nationally ad
vertised prices, keeps overhead

He devotes the rest of his time to

Kingstone said he got the idea

"l wasn't sure how profitable
the business would be, so I main
tained my job with the Univer
sity the first two months of my
business operation," he said.
"Not until 1 was secure that my
business was profitable did 1 quit
my job."
Kingstone worked for the
University Research Libraries
Group. He said the money he
makes selling the "high ticket,
low-overhead product" is at
least double his hourly wage
earnings there.
"1 expected to make more
money than working at a part
time job, but 1 didn't expect to
make a fortune," Kingstone said.
Tax breaks
He said the main advantage to
running his own business came in
the form of tax benefits. Kings
tone approached the Internal
Revenue Service and asked them
which expenses were legitimate
to write oft. He said his business
pays his education expenses, and
travel, phone and gas expenses.
Only expenses related to the
business and expenses that are
seen to improve his professional
skills can be written off by his
business, the economics major
said.
Kingstone said he didn't have
to invest a lot to start the busi
ness. He arranged with his
warehouseman to pay him 10
percent of all sales, rather than a
monthly rental fee. The beds sell
for $600 to $1200 each.
Although he does not plan to
continue the business next year,
he said at the end of the summer,
"I will have been in business 5V2
months. I will have received a
return on my investment and 1
will have learned an incredible
amount, which was all I intended
to accomplish."
Spin-off
As a spin-off ofHiis bedding
warehouse, Kingstone is writing
a booklet entitled The Student
Entrepreneur's Guide: How to
Start Your Own Part-Time Small
Business.
He said marketing the booklet
would be another business in it
self. He has already spoken to
publishers and intends to sell the
guide through college
bookstores and mailorder out
lets.
Not marketing a product, but
clearly in a successful business,
are Jamie Halper and Tim Ouin
lan. Together they run a booking
agency for bands.
Auditions in bars
The business, called T & B As
sociates, books about half the

bands that play on campus,
Halper said. He said the job is
time-consuming because he has
to go to bars to hear bands play
and audition them.
Rather than charging a com
mission, which was the way the
business worked before it was
passed along to Halper and
Quinlan two years ago, they
charge a flat fee of $25 per book
ing. Halper said by charging a
flat rate the firm carries more
credibility because clients aren't
wondering which portion of their
money goes to an agent and
which goes to the band itself.
Halper said that in the past, T
& B had some difficulty dealing
with agents and decided to
change the policy to a more up
front approach. He said the bus
iness makes about $500 per
quarter. There are no overhead
costs, as most of the business is
carried on by word of mouth and
phone calls are placed to his
home.
Now juniors, Halper and
Quinlan are preparing to pass
the business along to two
sophomores. It was given to
them by a junior here two years
ago.
Not just a smile
Also working in the arts,
sophomore David Gottfried has
established The Soft Image, a
photography portrait business
aimed at capturing the subject's
character rather than "just their
smile."
"The difference is that it's all
shot outdoors and I'm trying to
understand the people 1 shoot
before I shoot them. More than a
snapshot, which is just a smile, I
try to convey the essence of the
person."
Gottfried's work, mostly in
black and white, sells for about
$40 for an 8-x- 10-inch portrait.
He began his business at the
beginning of spring quarter, in
vesting $400 worth of personal
funds.
But, he said the main incentive
for this project is not photo
graphy nor money. He said he is
really interested in formulating
and starting his own business and
photography fit well for a part
time student business because
"it's something I do that's better
than most."
He said he will continue The
Soft Image for about a year, and
if it's not profitable by then, he
will shift his business endeavors
to other fields.
"I'm willing to fail. I'm willing
to get nailed, simply because I
want to learn," he said.
Hello, Deli!
One business venture on cam
pus has had the time to learn and
is clearly doing well — Hello
Deli. It started fall quarter and
delivers sandwiches in the even
ings to Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
Florence Moore Hall and
Lagunita Court in the evening
hours.
A partner. Brad Heinz, said
"In terms of profitability, it's not
very profitable. It serves more as
a service for people. A lot of
people like us because even
though it's not very profitable,
we're not going to quit now."
He said if there is a net profit
at the end of the quarter, he di

vides it between the four
partners involved, but "we've
never even made a three-digit fi
gure."
Employees of the service
make $4.50 to $5.50 an hour.
They used to be paid a commis
sion of 25 cents per sandwich,
but were dissatisfied, so the pay
scale was changed. Heinz said it
actually comes out to be about
the same.
Hello Deli does not concern
itself with payroll taxes "because
nobody makes enough per quar
ter to be responsible for payroll
taxes." He said he purchased a
basic bookkeeping kit at a store
which serves the firm's needs.
Owners deliver
All employees of Hello Deli
deliversandwiches, including the
owners. "It's like a communica
tions thing," Heinz said. "If
you're directly selling, you can
find out what they (the custom
ers) want to eat."
The sandwiches, sold between
10 p.m. and 1 1:30 p.m. Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday nights,
sell for $1.90.
On a similar note, Greg War
wick has started Cookie Craze, a
door-to-door chocolate chip
cookie business. Warwick, a
senior, purchases the cookies for
25 cents from The Cookie Stop
in Palo Alto and sells them for 35
cents in the dormitories. Row
houses, fraternities and inde
pendent houses.
'Pretention of business 1
"This is something that is
fairly easy for anyone to do,"
Warwick said. "It has been done,
informally, before. But under
the pretention of a business, it's
easier to sell for a profit. I plan to
sell for 35 cents a cookie and
make 10 cents per cookie sold. 1
feel that is a reasonable profit
considering the services re
ndered."
He pointed out that students
do not have to get in their cars,
use their gas and interrupt their
studies when they get a case of
"the munchies" as long as they
know the Cookie Craze will be
along between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.
Once established. Warwick
plans to prov ide a phone number
for students who want to order
more than a dozen cookies. The
call will have to be placed a cer

"This is something that is
fairly easy for anyone to do,"
Warwick said. "It has been done,
informally, before. But under
the pretention of a business, it's
easier to sell for a profit. I plan to
sell for 35 cents a cookie and
make 10 cents per cookie sold. 1

considering the services re

He pointed out that students
do not have to get in their cars,
use their gas and interrupt their
studies when they get a case of
"the munchies" as long as they
know the Cookie Craze will be
along between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.
Once established. Warwick
plans to prov ide a phone number
for students who want to order
more than a dozen cookies. The
call will have to be placed a cer
tain time before the cookies are
needed.
Warwick said he came up with
the idea in January, basing it on
the success of two other busines
ses that cater to students here —
Pizza Express and Hello Deli.

Ordering 600 cookies per
night and working only four
hours, Warwick will make $15

atfirst. he has kept his University
job as a safeguard.
Student entrepreneurs here
agree their businesses have
taught them things they couldn't
learn as employees and for that
reason, some have continued
operations on break-even basis.
For them, the experience of run
ning a business is important

necessarily need the added in

one point: establishing a small
business is time-consuming.
Take junior Brett Kingstone,
for example. The owner

"1 have to operate it (the busi

Kingstone, who sells electric
adjustable beds at prices 30 to 50
percent below the nationally ad

Kingstone said he got the idea

"l wasn't sure how profitable
the business would be, so I main
tained my job with the Univer
sity the first two months of my
business operation," he said.
"Not until 1 was secure that my
business was profitable did 1 quit
my job."
Kingstone worked for the
University Research Libraries
Group. He said the money he
makes selling the "high ticket,
low-overhead product" is at
least double his hourly wage
earnings there.
"1 expected to make more
money than working at a part
time job, but 1 didn't expect to
make a fortune," Kingstone said.
Tax breaks
He said the main advantage to
running his own business came in
the form of tax benefits. Kings
tone approached the Internal
Revenue Service and asked them
which expenses were legitimate
to write oft. He said his business
pays his education expenses, and
travel, phone and gas expenses.
Only expenses related to the
business and expenses that are
seen to improve his professional
skills can be written off by his
business, the economics major
said.
Kingstone said he didn't have
to invest a lot to start the busi
ness. He arranged with his
warehouseman to pay him 10
percent of all sales, rather than a
monthly rental fee. The beds sell
for $600 to $1200 each.
Although he does not plan to
continue the business next year,
he said at the end of the summer,
"I will have been in business 5V2
months. I will have received a
return on my investment and 1
will have learned an incredible
amount, which was all I intended
to accomplish."
Spin-off
As a spin-off ofHiis bedding
warehouse, Kingstone is writing
a booklet entitled The Student
Entrepreneur's Guide: How to
Start Your Own Part-Time Small
Business.
He said marketing the booklet
would be another business in it
self. He has already spoken to
publishers and intends to sell the
guide through college
bookstores and mailorder out
lets.
Not marketing a product, but
clearly in a successful business,
are Jamie Halper and Tim Ouin
lan. Together they run a booking
agency for bands.
Auditions in bars
The business, called T & B As
sociates, books about half the

bands that play on campus,
Halper said. He said the job is
time-consuming because he has
to go to bars to hear bands play
and audition them.
Rather than charging a com
mission, which was the way the
business worked before it was
passed along to Halper and
Quinlan two years ago, they
charge a flat fee of $25 per book
ing. Halper said by charging a
flat rate the firm carries more
credibility because clients aren't
wondering which portion of their
money goes to an agent and
which goes to the band itself.
Halper said that in the past, T
& B had some difficulty dealing
with agents and decided to
change the policy to a more up
front approach. He said the bus
iness makes about $500 per
quarter. There are no overhead
costs, as most of the business is
carried on by word of mouth and
phone calls are placed to his
home.
Now juniors, Halper and
Quinlan are preparing to pass
the business along to two
sophomores. It was given to
them by a junior here two years
ago.
Not just a smile
Also working in the arts,
sophomore David Gottfried has
established The Soft Image, a
photography portrait business
aimed at capturing the subject's
character rather than "just their
smile."
"The difference is that it's all
shot outdoors and I'm trying to
understand the people 1 shoot
before I shoot them. More than a
snapshot, which is just a smile, I
try to convey the essence of the
person."
Gottfried's work, mostly in
black and white, sells for about
$40 for an 8-x- 10-inch portrait.
He began his business at the
beginning of spring quarter, in
vesting $400 worth of personal
funds.
But, he said the main incentive
for this project is not photo
graphy nor money. He said he is
really interested in formulating
and starting his own business and
photography fit well for a part
time student business because
"it's something I do that's better
than most."
He said he will continue The
Soft Image for about a year, and
if it's not profitable by then, he
will shift his business endeavors
to other fields.
"I'm willing to fail. I'm willing
to get nailed, simply because I
want to learn," he said.
Hello, Deli!
One business venture on cam
pus has had the time to learn and
is clearly doing well — Hello
Deli. It started fall quarter and
delivers sandwiches in the even
ings to Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
Florence Moore Hall and
Lagunita Court in the evening
hours.
A partner. Brad Heinz, said
"In terms of profitability, it's not
very profitable. It serves more as
a service for people. A lot of
people like us because even
though it's not very profitable,
we're not going to quit now."
He said if there is a net profit
at the end of the quarter, he di

vides it between the four
partners involved, but "we've
never even made a three-digit fi
gure."
Employees of the service
make $4.50 to $5.50 an hour.
They used to be paid a commis
sion of 25 cents per sandwich,
but were dissatisfied, so the pay
scale was changed. Heinz said it
actually comes out to be about
the same.
Hello Deli does not concern
itself with payroll taxes "because
nobody makes enough per quar
ter to be responsible for payroll
taxes." He said he purchased a
basic bookkeeping kit at a store
which serves the firm's needs.
Owners deliver
All employees of Hello Deli
deliversandwiches, including the
owners. "It's like a communica
tions thing," Heinz said. "If
you're directly selling, you can
find out what they (the custom
ers) want to eat."
The sandwiches, sold between
10 p.m. and 1 1:30 p.m. Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday nights,
sell for $1.90.
On a similar note, Greg War
wick has started Cookie Craze, a
door-to-door chocolate chip
cookie business. Warwick, a
senior, purchases the cookies for
25 cents from The Cookie Stop
in Palo Alto and sells them for 35
cents in the dormitories. Row
houses, fraternities and inde
pendent houses.

itself with payroll taxes "because
nobody makes enough per quar
ter to be responsible for payroll
taxes." He said he purchased a
basic bookkeeping kit at a store
which serves the firm's needs.
Owners deliver
All employees of Hello Deli
deliversandwiches, including the
owners. "It's like a communica
tions thing," Heinz said. "If
you're directly selling, you can
find out what they (the custom
ers) want to eat."
The sandwiches, sold between
10 p.m. and 1 1:30 p.m. Monday,
Tuesday and Thursday nights,
sell for $1.90.
On a similar note, Greg War
wick has started Cookie Craze, a
door-to-door chocolate chip
cookie business. Warwick, a
senior, purchases the cookies for
25 cents from The Cookie Stop
in Palo Alto and sells them for 35
cents in the dormitories. Row
houses, fraternities and inde
pendent houses.
'Pretention of business 1
"This is something that is
fairly easy for anyone to do,"
Warwick said. "It has been done,
informally, before. But under
the pretention of a business, it's
easier to sell for a profit. I plan to
sell for 35 cents a cookie and
make 10 cents per cookie sold. 1
feel that is a reasonable profit
considering the services re
ndered."
He pointed out that students
do not have to get in their cars,
use their gas and interrupt their
studies when they get a case of
"the munchies" as long as they
know the Cookie Craze will be
along between 9 p.m. and 1 a.m.
Once established. Warwick
plans to prov ide a phone number
for students who want to order
more than a dozen cookies. The
call will have to be placed a cer
tain time before the cookies are
needed.
Warwick said he came up with
the idea in January, basing it on
the success of two other busines
ses that cater to students here —
Pizza Express and Hello Deli.
$15 an hour
Ordering 600 cookies per
night and working only four
hours, Warwick will make $15
an hour. But like Kingstone did
atfirst. he has kept his University
job as a safeguard.
Student entrepreneurs here
agree their businesses have
taught them things they couldn't
learn as employees and for that
reason, some have continued
operations on break-even basis.
For them, the experience of run
ning a business is important
enough in itself that they don't
necessarily need the added in
centive of profits.
But then, the business of
America is business.
