## Sorority violates individual rights 
### 
In these days of increased awareness of
individual rights, and in these times when
sororities are supposed to be correcting the
faults which have kept them off campus for
the last 33 years, one hardly expects to dis
cover that there are sororities that are inves
tigating rushees in a manner that can only be
considered outrageous.
I entered Stanford with a fairly open mind
about the sorority system, and 1 saw nothing
wrong with going through rush to find out
whether I might be interested in joining a
sorority . After the first round of invitational
parties last Saturday . 1 decided that although
1 had been favorably impressed with the sys
tem. joining it was not a commitment that 1
wanted to make.
Imagine my surprise, then, on Monday af
ternoon when I learned from my mother that
she had been called Monday morning by a
woman connected with a national Panhel
lenic organization (connected with all
Greek-letter fraternities and sororities). This
woman told my mother that 1 was going
through rush and proceeded to ask her the
following questions: Where did my parents
attendschool? What wasmy father's occupa
tion? Was he a member of a fraternity? What
was mv high school GPA? My college GPA?

What were my honors and activities? Could
she gi\e the names and addresses of three
personal references?
So what. you might say — this is general
information you might he asked when apply
ing to join any organization. What you don't
know is that 1 ga\ e the sororities no informa
tion about myself other than my name, cam
pus address and phone number — they
never asked for any other information. This
phone caH was made to my home completely
without my knowledge or consent — 1 never
even game anyone my parents' phone
number. No one e\er indicated to me in any
way that anyone might be "checking up" on
my "credentials."
1 feel very strongly that my individual
rights have been violated. 1 have spoken with
the President of the Inter-Sorority Council
(ISC (about the matter and been assured that
such investigations are not standard practice,
and that the ISC was unaware of such activ
ity. Nevertheless. I feel, that there are still
questions that the ISC and the University
need to answer — especially in view of the
fact that the sororities are making a serious
attempt at gaining official University recog
nition.
Questions such as: How is the ISC going to

keep a watch on sororities to make sure they
are conforming with ISC and University
guidelines? How was a sorority allowed to
carry out such an investigation of a rushee?
Will they be punished or reprimanded? Will
rushees be warned of such possible violations
of ISC policy as a way of preventing repeti
tions?
As for the University: Did they know this
kind of activity was taking place? (Probably
not — my resident fellow, who is an assistant
to the president, three house associates and 95
percent of my dorm, including several
rushees, didn't know. How will they ensure
that //sororities are recognized such activity
will not take place? How much do they really
know about sorority practices, and do they
really want organizations in any way con
nected with such activity under University
sanctions?
1 would call for a very full and close exami
nation of the sorority system before any
further consideration is given to allowing
them back on campus. Mine may not be the
standard case, but I doubt that my parents
were the only ones called, and the fact that
this kind of incident is occurring at all should
point out some of the serious shortcomings of
the sorority system.

not — my resident fellow, who is an assistant
to the president, three house associates and 95
percent of my dorm, including several
rushees, didn't know. How will they ensure
that //sororities are recognized such activity
will not take place? How much do they really
know about sorority practices, and do they
really want organizations in any way con
nected with such activity under University
sanctions?
1 would call for a very full and close exami
nation of the sorority system before any
further consideration is given to allowing
them back on campus. Mine may not be the
standard case, but I doubt that my parents
were the only ones called, and the fact that
this kind of incident is occurring at all should
point out some of the serious shortcomings of
the sorority system.
