## Time to look at Palestinian situation honestly 
### 
Another terrorist attack has
occurred in Israel. Our response,
both as Jews and Israelis, has
been one of grief, outrage and
righteousness. The incident has
been seized as justification for
the continued rejection of Pales
tinian statehood. But now. hav
ing once again focused world at
tention on Palestinian atrocities
and Israel's defense concerns, we
must honestly address the
background against which this
and similar incidents of violence
have occurred.
Indeed, we share a tradition of
moral irresponsibility with the
nations of the world. The inabil
ity of man to overcome irrespon
sibility, within both himself and
his institutions, is one explana
tion of a world which allows such
mutations as yearly worldwide
famine or Nazi Germany. But
laying these greater failings
aside, it is our own attitude which
justifies Palestinian subjugation
as the fortunate side-effect ol Is
raeli freedom.
As a further extension of this
logic, we have written our own
version of history emphasizing
the culpability of the Palestinians
in creating their present plight.
We next demand that they re
spond to their perceived mis
treatment other than as they do.
When they break the rules, for
example by killing innocent civi
lians. we are so consumed with
rage that again and again we miss
an important lesson. Injustice is
not reasonable!
Its counterparts — suffering,
grief and revenge — are also by
nature not subject to reason, and
thus reappear and spread accord

ing to their own logic. Recogniz
ing the predictable unreasona
bleness of terrorism is not to
condone it. but rather to take the
tirst step toward overcoming it.
To interrupt the vicious cycle of
injustice we must now, in mem
ory of the most recent casualties,
examine our own role in per
petuating such a cycle.
With all respect for the Jewish
heritage and history, we must
once and for all abandon the ba
lance sheet of grievances that
leads unfailingly to our self
image as victims and scapegoats.
A few painful questions illustrate
the self-imposed isolation that
such images promote: How, for
example, is it possible that the
importance of speaking Arabic
in Israel is so poorly appreciated
today, and that many students
taking a third language choose
French over Arabic? And how is
it that most Jews have little
analytical understanding or
sympathy with Arab and Islamic
history? If communication is
vital to understanding, arc not
the results of such disinterest
demonstrably tragic?
Just as the original Jewish vis
ion of monotheism was born into
a climate of adversity, counter to
conventions of the day, so was
the Jewish state born amidst
equally improbable cir
cumstances. And just as Jews
have transformed history with a
unique concept ol God, so are
they in a position to devise an
equally radical response to man's
inhumanity to man. Our historic
experience with the phenomena
of injustice enables us to meet
this challenge, if we so will.
The ironic fact that Jews now

find that their survival depends
upon the subjugation of another
people — even taking into ac
count extenuating circumstances
— is great cause for cynicism
among those so inclined. Indeed,
it is especially painful for Jewish
youths whose idealism is flat
tened by the realities of our
modern warrior state.
It will require a great venture
of faith to put into practice the
moral belief of our own and
other religions — to love our
brothers. Yet, if we could

exemplify and build into our
political and social institutions
this radical and timeless idea, we
might well guide the family of
nations from their obsolescent
and dangerous political prac
tices.
Occupying as we do the center
of a vortex in a volatile world, the
risks are already great in remain
ing with the status quo. With all
respect for the dangers of the
unknown, let us prefer them to
the dangers of the present; draw
ing strength from the knowledge

that our life destined to pass at
any rate, should pass purpose
fully.
The first step is to fashion a
new approach, one that is both
principled and safe.
Not until we acknowledge that
injustice exists exclusive to none,
unreasonable everywhere and
empowered by all, can we re
sponsibly ask the questions, the
answers to which shall set us free.

not reasonable!
Its counterparts — suffering,
grief and revenge — are also by
nature not subject to reason, and
thus reappear and spread accord

ing to their own logic. Recogniz
ing the predictable unreasona
bleness of terrorism is not to
condone it. but rather to take the
tirst step toward overcoming it.
To interrupt the vicious cycle of
injustice we must now, in mem
ory of the most recent casualties,
examine our own role in per
petuating such a cycle.
With all respect for the Jewish
heritage and history, we must
once and for all abandon the ba
lance sheet of grievances that
leads unfailingly to our self
image as victims and scapegoats.
A few painful questions illustrate
the self-imposed isolation that
such images promote: How, for
example, is it possible that the
importance of speaking Arabic
in Israel is so poorly appreciated
today, and that many students
taking a third language choose
French over Arabic? And how is
it that most Jews have little
analytical understanding or
sympathy with Arab and Islamic
history? If communication is
vital to understanding, arc not
the results of such disinterest
demonstrably tragic?
Just as the original Jewish vis
ion of monotheism was born into
a climate of adversity, counter to
conventions of the day, so was
the Jewish state born amidst
equally improbable cir
cumstances. And just as Jews
have transformed history with a
unique concept ol God, so are
they in a position to devise an
equally radical response to man's
inhumanity to man. Our historic
experience with the phenomena
of injustice enables us to meet
this challenge, if we so will.
The ironic fact that Jews now

find that their survival depends
upon the subjugation of another
people — even taking into ac
count extenuating circumstances
— is great cause for cynicism
among those so inclined. Indeed,
it is especially painful for Jewish
youths whose idealism is flat
tened by the realities of our
modern warrior state.
It will require a great venture
of faith to put into practice the
moral belief of our own and
other religions — to love our
brothers. Yet, if we could

exemplify and build into our
political and social institutions
this radical and timeless idea, we
might well guide the family of
nations from their obsolescent
and dangerous political prac
tices.
Occupying as we do the center
of a vortex in a volatile world, the
risks are already great in remain
ing with the status quo. With all
respect for the dangers of the
unknown, let us prefer them to
the dangers of the present; draw
ing strength from the knowledge

that our life destined to pass at
any rate, should pass purpose
fully.
The first step is to fashion a
new approach, one that is both
principled and safe.
Not until we acknowledge that
injustice exists exclusive to none,
unreasonable everywhere and
empowered by all, can we re
sponsibly ask the questions, the
answers to which shall set us free.

Another terrorist attack has
occurred in Israel. Our response,
both as Jews and Israelis, has
been one of grief, outrage and
righteousness. The incident has
been seized as justification for
the continued rejection of Pales
tinian statehood. But now. hav
ing once again focused world at
tention on Palestinian atrocities
and Israel's defense concerns, we
must honestly address the
background against which this
and similar incidents of violence
have occurred.
Indeed, we share a tradition of
moral irresponsibility with the
nations of the world. The inabil
ity of man to overcome irrespon
sibility, within both himself and
his institutions, is one explana
tion of a world which allows such
mutations as yearly worldwide
famine or Nazi Germany. But
laying these greater failings
aside, it is our own attitude which
justifies Palestinian subjugation
as the fortunate side-effect ol Is
raeli freedom.
As a further extension of this
logic, we have written our own
version of history emphasizing
the culpability of the Palestinians
in creating their present plight.
We next demand that they re
spond to their perceived mis
treatment other than as they do.
When they break the rules, for
example by killing innocent civi
lians. we are so consumed with
rage that again and again we miss
an important lesson. Injustice is
not reasonable!
Its counterparts — suffering,
grief and revenge — are also by
nature not subject to reason, and
thus reappear and spread accord
