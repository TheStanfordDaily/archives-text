## Check out co-generation 
### 
"Co-generation will probably
be the major way to save energy
after 1985 and could provide as
much new electricity as the Un
ited States economy will need by
2000," or so reports the
textbook from Gil Masters' Man
and His Environment class.
An exciting possibility exists
for Stanford to get in on some of
this upcoming action. An in
novative concept, co-generation
efficiently makes use of a fuel
source by producing both ther
mal steam and electricity.
Currently, a natural gas
fueled boiler on campus pro
duces steam for heating, while all
of our electricity comes from an
outside utility. A co-generation
plant can simultaneously pro
duce both steam and electricity.
The facilities being considered

for Stanford use a variety ot fuels
ranging from oil and natural gas
to solid waste.
Solid waste, a new alternative
fuel source, is readily available,
and though it must first be pro
cessed, is now wasted as landfill.
The co-generation plant which
combusts solid waste for fuel was
conceived by mechanical en
gineering professor Bob Eustis.
Oversimplifying its operation,
this specific facility is comprised
of a fluidized bed of sand made
turbulent with air, with steam
generating pipes running
throughout. The refuse-derived
fuel is combusted to generate
steam, which may be used for
heating as well as for turning the
turbine of an electrical
generator. Solid waste does not
supply as many BTU's as the fos
sil fuels, but on the other hand it
is wise to consider its relative av
ailability.
Right now Stanford is spend
ing approximately $H) million
yearly for utility bills. Co
generation, whichever fuel is
chosen, would cut down on much
of that expense; yet there arc
some tricky considerations. In
fact, when the proposal was
studied five years ago. further

development of the co
generation option was rejected
because of cost and other factors.
It is estimated that a co
generation plant would cost
about $50 million to build and
operate. The availability and
cost of various fuels is another
factor. Santa Clara County may
become a source of refuse
derived fuel, but the county's
plans are not final.
In the next few months, Stan
ford intends to conduct a techni
cal co-generation study. The
feasibility of co-generation will
be examined with emphasis on
the load profiles for steam, elec
tricity and chilled water; pre
liminary designs; costs; and the
amount of capital investment
necessary. The costs and advan
tages of number six fuel, natural
gas; number two, diesel fuel and
refuse-derived fuel will all be
evaluated and compared. Hope
fully the hard facts will support
the co-generation step towards
energy efficiency, though insight
and sense alone should predict
the advantages of a total energy
system which can produce
energy with increased efficiency,
in a self-contained and -operated
facility using fuel now dumped
into the dirt.
