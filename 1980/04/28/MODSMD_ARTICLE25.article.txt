# Automakers eating dirt
## 
### 
As the wheels of progress roll onward, some ride
it out on top. some run alongside and some find
themselves dragged through the mud. American
automakers are eating dirt these days, and they're
rapidly reaching the end of their tow line. Mean
while, American consumers just shake their heads
and mutter. "I told you so."
Just one glance at the news will tell you that the
United States automobile industry is sputtering
along on flat tires. Time magazine reports that sales
are off 26 percent from last year's deflated figures,
and the effects are hitting hard. Chrysler is rum
maging through the financial hack alleys, hoping to
scrape up enough cash to qualify for a loan from
Uncle Sam, and praying that it will stave off ban
kruptcy.
Ford has a better idea: shut down several plants
and lay off several thousand employees. The idea
has caught the industry like wildfire: one out of
every four members of the United Auto Workers is
now on layoff. Tilings haven't been this bad since
the Great Depression.
And yet the automakers have nobody to blame
but themselves. Americans have not abandoned
their marriage to the automobile: they've merely
been courting the more attractive foreign produc
ers. While Detroit continues to roll its awkward
steel tonnage oft the assembly lines, the Japanese
and Europeans have seduced the Yankee con
sumer with their smart, efficient little models. This
year you'll see more new Japanese cars on the road
than Fords or Chryslers.
You may be wondering what the big wheels in
Motown have been up to since the 1973 Arab oil
embargo, when Americans began calling for smal
ler American cars. The answer is simple: they've
been fishing for profits. The Big Three make big
profits selling big cars, so they lavishly baited (and
re-baited) their big hooks. Only this time Ameri
cans-didn't go for the plastic worm. Consequently,
the blind fishermen have been left high and dry
with nothing in their nets but holes. They let the
"little one" get away.

Ironically, the industry's temporary savior ap
pears to be a set of government regulations man
dating greater fuel efficiency for new models
regulations the industry fought tooth and nail to
roll back. Without the guidelines. Detroit would
be even further behind in the gas-mileage race.
Market pressures will eventually make the regula
tions unnecessary as automakers boost luel effi
ciency just to survive, but only after we see more
plant shotdowns and more layoffs.
This points to the greatest tragedy of the au.to
industry's predicament. Literally hundreds ot
thousands of workers in related industries arc now
paying the price for auto executive greed and
myopia: they are out of work and out of luck. Now

is not the time to be out of either.
The American auto industry desperately neejds
an overhaul and as usual, the repairs will be expen
sive. Motown may be getting what it deserves, but
the workers are getting the shaft. We will soon see
if U.S. automakers can bear down and meet the
challenge of a fiercely competitive world market.
However, one lesson must be learned first: those
wheels of progress don't always roll forward. And
when they begin to slip backward, those who have
been dragging their heels had better be on thtfii
toes.
