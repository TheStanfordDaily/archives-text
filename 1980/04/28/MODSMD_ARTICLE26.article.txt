## Gay community life joyful 
### 
A great deal is written about
the problems that gay men and
lesbians face because we differ,
in an important way, from the
majority. Much is said about
both the psychological pressures
exerted by an often homophobic
society, and about the overt dis
crimination that gay people ex
perience.
Despite the publicity given to
gay issues, we continue to find it
necessary to remind people that
we comprise roughly 10 percent
of the population, and that we
are in every profession and of
every ethnic background.
It is the invisibility of sexual
orientation, as compared to race
or national origin, that distin
guishes gay people from other
minority groups. Most
homosexuals, even when they
are fully aware of their orienta
tion. are not openly gay. They

sacrifice the ability to participate
in everyday conversations about
romantic interests or social ac
tivities.
It is possible that one reason for
the reluctance of closeted gay
people to "come out" is the pre
ponderance of publicity of the
negative aspects of gay life. We
feel that it is time to balance the
picture by pointing out some
positive rewards that are at
tained only after a measure of
openness and self-assuredness
has been achieved.
For the gay person who has
come to full self-acceptance, the
realization that he or she has sur
vived a battle that most people
need never fight leads to a strong
sense of pride and self-worth.
This can be reflected in a bold,
confident approach to life that
comes from a feeling of great
achievement at having finally
come to appreciate one's real
self. It is with this same pride that
we point to the cultural and polit
ical accomplishments of lesbians
and gay men during Gay Aware
ness Week.
The bond that all gay people
share is our passage through long
periods of isolation and conce
alment. It is the loneliness of this
experience, as well as its univer
sality among gay people, that
makes us value friendship so
highly. The ability to be totally
honest about oneself is new to
the person who is just coming
out. and it results in deep, shar

ing relationships among gay
people. In addition, participa
tion by many in the gay move
ment leads to a sense of to
getherness and unity of purpose
that contributes to the closeness,
of the gay community.
The new-found freedom upos
entering into gay life is itsl
greatest reward. Not only is one,
free to express feelings that has)
always been suppressed and
experience the romantic side of«
life for the first time, but one alscj«
has the liberty to experiment J
with a multitude of different J
ways of relating to people that •
are far less accessible in the
straight world.
Traditions of dating,
monogamy and marriage are
carried over into gay relation
ships only when useful, and the
concept of male-female role
playing has no obvious analogue
among most gay couples. Furth
ermore, once one is accepted as
different in one respect, no one is
particularly surprised by any new
piece of information, and one
finds oneself worrying far less
about what others will think.
The joys of the gay experience
arise from the very oppression
that we fight against. It is our
victory in our personal struggle
that makes us proud, our
enemies that unite us, and our
being labeled as different that
makes us free.
