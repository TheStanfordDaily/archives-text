Turnabout, fair play, sweet revenge, just
desserts . . . call it what you will, the Cardi
nals got a healthy serving of it this weekend
as they swept powerhouse Arizona State in
three, 6-4, 1 1-5 and 1-0.
Said head coach Mark Marquess, "Re
venge was not a conscious thing on our mind.
But we did remember it.(It was a three-game
ASU sweep of visiting Stanford earlier in the
season that Marquess refered to, including a
34-2 drubbing). We wanted to play well.
"As lor the sweep, it was weird. We can't
seem to win on the road. But at home I think
we've only lost four games all year. Also in
this league, anybody can sweep anybody.
Once you get started, the momentum just
builds," added Marquess.
That momentum climaxed yesterday. To
put the icing on the cake, all Card hurler
Larry Kuhn did was totally shut down the
Sun Devil attack, to say nothing of shutting
them out. He held ASU to three hits and
except for a shaky sixth inning, was in control
the entire afternoon.
"Larry pitched super. It was a great per
formance. And as he proved today, he is one
of those rare pitchers who can throw almost
every day." marveled Marquess.
And the Cards were thankful for that as
they were having problems mustering an at
tack of their own before the seventh. From
the second inning through the sixth, Devil
southpaw E:d Vandeberg pretty much kept
the Cards at bay.
The Cards, though, had a chance in the
very first inning but not due to any merit of
their own. With one out in that inning. Van
deberg walked Mike Dottefer, Paul Zuvella
and Dave Meier to load the bases. The attack
was stalled right there, however, as catcher
Bill Worden grounded into an inning-ending

double play.
The Sun Devils weren't so fortunate in the
seventh. Mike Toothman opened the inning
with a slash single and moved to second
thanks to a sacrifice bunt by first baseman
Loring Davies. Designated hitter Steve
Buechele then promptly drilled a Vandeberg
pitch into center and Toothman scored what
turned out to be the winning run. Cards 1,
'Devils zip.
"We have been hitting the ball well lately
but leav ing a lot of runners on base. So when
we left three on base in the first inning, I
thought,'Oh no, here we go again.' But Steve
(Buechele) came through for us in the
seventh. He has been hitting fine for us the
last couple of weeks, only his sore arm is
keeping him off the field," reported Mar
quess.
On the field, Kuhn set down the Devils
1-2-3 in the eighth. And in the ninth, after
outfielder Ricky Nelson (no relation) dou
bled, Kuhn retired the next three batters and
that was that.
The other two games were played a bit
differently but with the same result. Satur
day, the Cards came from behind to take
ASU 11-5. In that game, they hit the best
they did all series, cracking 1 3 hits and giving
Card pitchers, particularly Lee Cline, some
needed breathing space.
Tied at four after five and a half innings,
the Cards broke the game open with one in
the fifth, two in the sixth, one in the seventh
and three in the eighth to hand Cline his
seventh victory of the year.
Marquess breathed a little easier after the
game was over. "Saturday's game was the
pivotal game. We had to get some hitting to
protect our pitchers. And I knew we'd be in
good shape if we won that one because we
had the pitching coming up on Sunday," he
said.

As for Saturday's pitching, Marquess said
"we gave up a lot of walks, more than we
should have. But Cline got us out of it. When
he had to get an out, he got it."
Friday's finish was more exciting. Like the
final game, this one was scoreless through the
first four innings. Kuhn, in a preview of what
was to come two days later, shut down the
'Devils in his three innings. Bob Boatman,
though, ran into some problems in the fifth,
as did Brian Mignano in the sixth and ASU
was up 3-1 after six.
In the seventh, freshman centerfielder
Darryl Stephens slammed a home run off
starter and ace Ken Jones to narrow the de
ficit to one. On the day, Stephens hit the ball
solidly four times and "is really coming into
his own," according to Marquess.
The Cardinals and a little known player
named Dave Dacus came into their own the
next inning. In that crucial eighth, the Cards,
sparked by Dacus, pushed home four runs
and never looked back, as it turned out, all
weekend.
Paul Zuvella reached second to open the
inning on an error by centerfielder Nelson.
Dave Meier walked and an infield out later,
John Elway was walked intentionally to load
the bases. The stage was set for Dacus.
A seldom-used left-handed hitting
sophomore who, according to Marquess, had
"swung well in batting practice" that day,
Dacus came to bat for only the seventh time
in his Pacific-10 career. Dacus swatted at the
first good pitch thrown and sent an opposite
field liner to the left field corner, scoring all
three runners and giving the Cards the lead
for the first time in the game, 5-3. Stephens
finished a strong game with a RBI single.
"To his credit, Dave swung at the first
strike he got. That play showed a lot of
character. It's very hard for a non-starter to

Larry Kuhn, who ran into a pitching lull on Friday, overcame the problem yesterday as he held
the Sun Devils to three hits and won the game which completed Stanford's sweep this weekend
of ASU.
keep up his concentration but Dave came
through," said Marquess.
He did come through, but was avenging
previous losses on his mind?
"We talked a little about it before the
game," Dacus said. "But the motivation was
mostly understood and not expressed. We all
knew we had a lot to owe them."
Whatever the Cardinals had owed, they
certainly paid it back in kind this weekend.

Not only did they maim Arizona State's
chances at a Pac-10 title, but they put them
selves back in the thick of things as well.
The Sun Devils went into the series four
games ahead of Stanford and only Vi a game
out of first place (Cal is in first) and they
came out of the weekend debacle a mere
game ahead of the Card-iac kids, to say no
thing of the lost ground to Cal. Stanford, on
the other hand, raised it's conference record

to 11-13 (27-18 overall) and also raised
Marquess' optimism.
"This league is so screwy this year. But
we're right back in the race. We now have an
especially good chance at second place, at
least," said an obviously pleased Marquess.
That new-found pleasure will be tested
tomorrow as the Cards travel, to sunny
Fresno to take on the nationally ranked
Fresno State squad.
