# Violation of rights claimed in sorority rush
##

Investigation into a woman's
background by a sorority alumna has
outraged several University officials as
well as sorority members on campus
and may have further hurt the chances
of University recognition for sororities
here.
Freshman Carol Chesarek told the
Daily last week that a woman represen
tative from the San Jose chapter of the
National Panhellenic Society — a
group of sorority and fraternity alumni
nationwide — had contacted her
mother on April 21. during sorority
rush.
Mrs. Ruth Chesarek of Los Gatos
said the woman, whose name she could
not remember, called and said Carol
was going through rush, and could she
please answer a few questions. The
woman's questions regarded Mr.
Chesarek's occupation, whether Mrs.
Chesarek worked outside the home,
whether she or her husband had been
in the Greek system in college, and
Carol's high school grade point average
and activity record.
Mrs. Chesarek, thinking that the in
vestigation had been authorized by
Carol, answered the questions, al
though she explained to the woman
that Carol had decided not to continue
with rush.
"She said that they still wanted the
information for the files in case Carol
decided to go through rush again,"
Mrs. Chesarek said.
However, Carol has stated. "The
phone call was made completely with

out my knowledge or consent. 1 never
gave anyone my parent's phone
number. No one ever indicated to me in
any way that anyone would be checking
up on my credentials.
"1 feel very strongly that my indi
vidual rights have been violated," she
added.
Meanwhile, the Daily has learned
from several sources that this was not
an isolated incident and that other wo
men's parents were also contacted.
When Nancy Hoffman, president of
the Inter-Sorority Council, learned of
the call to Mrs. Chesarek and others,
she said she was enraged.
"This is in no way Stanford sorority
policy, nor is it standard Panhellenic
policy," she said. "Some alums just
went ahead and did this, and I'm sure
no Stanford sorority member told them
to," she said.
At this point it is not known which
sorority requested the information on
Carol Chesarek or furnished her name
to the Panhellenic representative.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, called the action, "just the kind
of invasion of privacy that sororities
have practiced for a long time that
make us so adamant about insisting
that control of student groups should
rest in the hands of students here."
Lyons added that the University would
certainly remember this action when
considering whether to give sororities
official recognition in the future.
Although the 33-year ban on
sororities was lifted by the University
Board of Trustees in 1977, sororities
have not succeeded in gaining official

University recognition, or the right to
use on-campus facilities for meetings
or activities.
Earlier this year Lyons, Associate
Dean for Residential Education Norm
Robinson, and the Committee for Stu
dent Services told the seven Stanford
sororities they could not be given rec
ognition until the "problem of local au
tonomy" was solved.
Robinson said then that national
sorority constitutions contained
"clauses and provisions that infringe on
the ability of the local group to govern
their own affairs," and did not conform
to University guidelines for selective
groups.
Those guidelines state, "The selec
tion process may not in any way involve
persons from outside the University for
the purpose of influencing either the
decisions made by selective groups or
the decisions of students as to whether
to join the groups."
Hoffman admitted that the ISC has
no control over the activities of the
Panhellenics and that no one had
cleared this action with her.
The "recommendation policy" of
some national sororities' constitutions,
which led to this incident, is one of the
major reasons why the University is
withholding recognition.
Hoffman explained that some na
tional sorority constitutions require
alumnae recommendations for women
rushing the sorority.
However. Hoffman said, and soror
ity rush chairpersons confirmed, that
these recommendations are generally
not used in the selection process and

are simply placed on file. Most recom
mendations are sent independently by
women who are aware of a student they
know whom is rushing. In cases where
the woman knows no alumnae, some
one from the rushees' local Panhellenic
group may recommend her to comply
with national regulations.
Apparently this is what led to the
calls to Mrs. Chesarek and several
other women. Hoffman said, however,
that Panhellenic administrators told her
this practice was only to be used in
extreme cases and is not condoned by
the National Panhellenic Society.
Diana C'onklin, assistant director of
residential education, said she was very
angry and appalled at this sort of intru
sion of privacy, and that she had never
heard of such a case before. Conklin
said that although she thought recogni
tion for some of the sororities was
"imminent," this could hamper their
cause.

out my knowledge or consent. 1 never
gave anyone my parent's phone
number. No one ever indicated to me in
any way that anyone would be checking
up on my credentials.
"1 feel very strongly that my indi
vidual rights have been violated," she
added.
Meanwhile, the Daily has learned
from several sources that this was not
an isolated incident and that other wo
men's parents were also contacted.
When Nancy Hoffman, president of
the Inter-Sorority Council, learned of
the call to Mrs. Chesarek and others,
she said she was enraged.
"This is in no way Stanford sorority
policy, nor is it standard Panhellenic
policy," she said. "Some alums just
went ahead and did this, and I'm sure
no Stanford sorority member told them
to," she said.
At this point it is not known which
sorority requested the information on
Carol Chesarek or furnished her name
to the Panhellenic representative.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons, called the action, "just the kind
of invasion of privacy that sororities
have practiced for a long time that
make us so adamant about insisting
that control of student groups should
rest in the hands of students here."
Lyons added that the University would
certainly remember this action when
considering whether to give sororities
official recognition in the future.
Although the 33-year ban on
sororities was lifted by the University
Board of Trustees in 1977, sororities
have not succeeded in gaining official

University recognition, or the right to
use on-campus facilities for meetings
or activities.
Earlier this year Lyons, Associate
Dean for Residential Education Norm
Robinson, and the Committee for Stu
dent Services told the seven Stanford
sororities they could not be given rec
ognition until the "problem of local au
tonomy" was solved.
Robinson said then that national
sorority constitutions contained
"clauses and provisions that infringe on
the ability of the local group to govern
their own affairs," and did not conform
to University guidelines for selective
groups.
Those guidelines state, "The selec
tion process may not in any way involve
persons from outside the University for
the purpose of influencing either the
decisions made by selective groups or
the decisions of students as to whether
to join the groups."
Hoffman admitted that the ISC has
no control over the activities of the
Panhellenics and that no one had
cleared this action with her.
The "recommendation policy" of
some national sororities' constitutions,
which led to this incident, is one of the
major reasons why the University is
withholding recognition.
Hoffman explained that some na
tional sorority constitutions require
alumnae recommendations for women
rushing the sorority.
However. Hoffman said, and soror
ity rush chairpersons confirmed, that
these recommendations are generally
not used in the selection process and

are simply placed on file. Most recom
mendations are sent independently by
women who are aware of a student they
know whom is rushing. In cases where
the woman knows no alumnae, some
one from the rushees' local Panhellenic
group may recommend her to comply
with national regulations.
Apparently this is what led to the
calls to Mrs. Chesarek and several
other women. Hoffman said, however,
that Panhellenic administrators told her
this practice was only to be used in
extreme cases and is not condoned by
the National Panhellenic Society.
Diana C'onklin, assistant director of
residential education, said she was very
angry and appalled at this sort of intru
sion of privacy, and that she had never
heard of such a case before. Conklin
said that although she thought recogni
tion for some of the sororities was
"imminent," this could hamper their
cause.

Investigation into a woman's
background by a sorority alumna has
outraged several University officials as
well as sorority members on campus
and may have further hurt the chances
of University recognition for sororities
here.
Freshman Carol Chesarek told the
Daily last week that a woman represen
tative from the San Jose chapter of the
National Panhellenic Society — a
group of sorority and fraternity alumni
nationwide — had contacted her
mother on April 21. during sorority
rush.
Mrs. Ruth Chesarek of Los Gatos
said the woman, whose name she could
not remember, called and said Carol
was going through rush, and could she
please answer a few questions. The
woman's questions regarded Mr.
Chesarek's occupation, whether Mrs.
Chesarek worked outside the home,
whether she or her husband had been
in the Greek system in college, and
Carol's high school grade point average
and activity record.
Mrs. Chesarek, thinking that the in
vestigation had been authorized by
Carol, answered the questions, al
though she explained to the woman
that Carol had decided not to continue
with rush.
"She said that they still wanted the
information for the files in case Carol
decided to go through rush again,"
Mrs. Chesarek said.
However, Carol has stated. "The
phone call was made completely with

out my knowledge or consent. 1 never
gave anyone my parent's phone
