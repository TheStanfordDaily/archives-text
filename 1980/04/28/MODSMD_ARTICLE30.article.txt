# Trackwomen hit Orinda Invitational
## 
### 
Competing in what women's
track coach Laurel Treon called
"marginal conditions," a few
members of the Stanford wo
men's track team traveled to the
East Bay for the Orinda Invita
tional yesterday.
But nevertheless, the atheletes
that went came home with some
nice honors. Pam Donald won
the long jump and the 1 00 meter
dash. Her winning long jump, a
leap of 1S feet, 3 inches, was not
her best ever, but according to
Treon was impressive consider
ing the conditions under which
she competed.
Mary Osborne took first place
in the javelin throw with a heave
of 43 meters. She also unleashed
her lifetime best throw in the dis
cus, tossing it 137 feet.

Shelly Poerio was fifth in the
400 meter clash, but set a new
Stanford record in the process
with a time of 59.6.
"We're winding down the sea
son." Treon said. "We took a
group of people who are still
keyed for our last two meets be
fore the nationals. They're trying
to make qualifying marks for the
nationals, or to set their season's
best."
Overall, Treon was very
pleased with the performance of
her atheletes.
"Under the circumstances, we
did well. There were delays wait
ing for events . . . but when you
run a big event like that, things
like that happen. There were
changes, and our women
adapted well to them."
