The Oregon State Beavers, led
by individual victories in four
field events, squeezed by Stan
ford and UC-Irvine in a three
way track and field meet held
Saturday at Stanford Stadium.
"We did everything but win,"
said head coach Brooks Johnson,
and in fact, Stanford won the
most events. They were leading
after 14 events, but the Beavers
ended up on top, tallying 76
points to 70 for Stanford. Irvine
picked up 57 in the triangular
scoring.
In dual meet scoring, it was
Stanford edging Irvine 83-80,
OSU over the Anteaters 89-71,
and the Beavers beating Stan
ford by the score of 85-79.
Oregon State got five points
each for victories in the shot put.
(Ron Schmidt, 68-2), High jump
(Dave Grossnicklaus, 6-10),
pole vault (Shannon Sullivan,
15-6) and the discus, where
standout Tim Fox tied the meet

record with a throw of 179-10.
In addition, the Beavers won
the 400 meter hurdles, as Ken
Scott set a meet record with his
time of 5 1.8 and the 5000 met
ers, where Rick Kumm won
going away with a time of 14:38.
OSU also picked up a win in the
400 meter relay as they nipped
Irvine at the tape with a time of
41.6.
For Stanford it was the sprin
ters who shined, especially in the
200 meters. Gordon Banks
clocked a career best 20.8 for
first place and Darrin Nelson
tied his personal best in the event
for second place with a time of
21.1. Nelson also took the 100
meters in a time of 10.7, with
Banks nabbing third at 10.8.
"We finally got a good race out
of Gordy Banks," Johnson said,
"and Darrin had a good day."
John Schaer turned in a strong
performance for the Cards as he
just missed doubling in the 800
and 1500. Schaer took the 1500
meters quite easily with his time

of 3:44.8, but came in second in
the 800 meters, despite a very
strong kick at the end which saw
him fall short by .04 of a second.
Curt Hatton chalked up a fine
performance for the Cards in the
field events. He won both the
long jump and the triple jump.
Hatton outdistanced the compet
ition with jumps of 23-2 and
46-10V2 in the long and triple
jumps respectively.
The Cards also got two per
sonal records in two other field
events. In the javelin. Gary
Bruner threw 274-2 for his best
ever and in the hammer, Rick
Buss bettered his personal mark
with his toss of 219-3. which is
also a new school record.
"Rick Buss kept up his record
breaking trend." Johnson said.
"He seems to go out there and
improve every time."
Also winning for the Cardinals
was Bill Haldeman, who easily
took the 3000 meter steeplech
ase bv eleven seconds with a

clocking of 19:10.0.
"For us, winning is a secondary
consideration," Johnson said.
"That's the objective part. We
won the subjective part of the
meet by putting in a lot of good
performances and improving a
lot of personal records. That's
the part we're into. When a guy
like Curt Hatton increases his
personal record by a foot, that's
what keeps me happy."
When asked if he thought the
team was panning out after their
mid-season low against UC'LA.
Johnson said. "When you're de
aling with Stanford students
there's a lot more involved — a
lot more crossfire. They have

more antennae out than the av
erage college jock so when they
get drubbed like they did against
UCLA, a lot of things make it
more difficult to come back.
They're more complicated. So, 1
think it's been a pretty Hurcu
lean effort for them to keep com
ing and improving like they have
in the last two meets."
The meet Saturday was the
last home track and field meet ot
the year for Stanford, as they
now must prepare for the
California Bears who they will
face this weekend at Berkeley.
Cal won in a triangular meet
Saturday against Washington
State and Fresno State.
