# Women booters upset in Berkeley

Attitude and commmunica
tion are as important as flawless
passes and tackles in order to win
a soccer game. This fact perhaps
in part explains why the Stanford
women's soccer team suffered
defeats from UC-Berkeley (1-0)
and Chico State (2-0) at this
weekend's Northern California
Women's Soccer League
playoffs, held in Chico. These
losses leave the Cards in fourth
place in the league.
The playoff line-up pitted the
Cards against their most formid
able opponent, UC-Berkeley. in
Saturday's noon match. Though
the Bears are reknowned for
their size and speed. Stanford
had defeated them twice this sea
son and was expected to take the

Bears again.
First-half play, however,
suggested the outcome of the
game would be otherwise, as the
Bears outshot the Cards nine to
three and took a 1-0 lead.
The Bears' play was generally
effective and quickly executed,
especially on defense. Stanford
lagged on free halls, and that is
where they fell behind.
Stanford also faced certain
disadvantages. Injuries limited
leading scorer Cindy Shorney
and fullback Sarah Little. Height
also proved a problem: Stan
ford's team averages about
5-foot-6 (v. Berkeley's 5-foot
-7). Stanford invariably lost the
free air balls, thereby losing the
chance to generate many offen
sive moves.

Stanford picked up in the sec
ond half, making six shots to
Berkeley's four. However, of
fensive plays still lacked cohe
sion, and communication re
mained minimal, holding Stan
ford's efforts outside the goal.
Defensively. Stanford played
an excellent second half, mark
ing tight and clearing the endless
long boots Berkeley threw them.
Halfback Sue Handel played an
exceptional game, providing
consistent offensive-defensive
transitions with her near
impeccable dribbling and tackl
ing.
Frustrated by the Bears in a
1-0 upset that the whole team
felt shouldn't have happened,
the Cards turned to Sunday's
match against Chico. This was to

determine the third and fourth
places in the league. Chico had
also been defeated by the hoot
ers in prior season piay.
But the Cards were unable to
score, though they outshot Chico
2-1 throughout the 90 minutes of
play. The Cards threw away
many opportunities on too-long
lead balls into a cluttered Chico
defense.
Said assistant coach Tom Mil
ler: "They didn't work as a team
on the offense, taking the easy
passes and quick plays. They
went for the one-in-a-hundred
shots and passes."
Cindy Shorney's efforts to
push through an elbow-infested
Chico line notwithstanding, the
offense in general remained as
diffident as in the Berkeley
game.
Defensively, however, the
team played a superior game.
The marking was tight enough to
be a one-on-one. and the full
to-half clears kept Chico chasing
after SU passes: Said Miller:
"The defensive unit did a lot of
good things. They had a lot of
pressure on them, but they kept
up with it." Debbie Lum and
Suzie Abosch contributed espe
cially consistent support on the
fullback flanks.
Chico goals were scored on
through dribbles and shots taken
from in front of the goal, five
yards out.
Thus Stanford must acquiesce
to a fourth place standing, results
of these playoff consessions to
Berkeley and Chico. This is a
step down from the undefeated
record they have maintained for
the last two years. The playoffs
ended Stanford women's soccer
team's playing season, save for
the third annual Stanford Soccer
Invitational tournament to be
held May 10 and 11.

Attitude and commmunica
tion are as important as flawless
passes and tackles in order to win
a soccer game. This fact perhaps
in part explains why the Stanford
women's soccer team suffered
defeats from UC-Berkeley (1-0)
and Chico State (2-0) at this
weekend's Northern California
Women's Soccer League
playoffs, held in Chico. These
losses leave the Cards in fourth
place in the league.
The playoff line-up pitted the
Cards against their most formid
able opponent, UC-Berkeley. in
Saturday's noon match. Though
the Bears are reknowned for
their size and speed. Stanford
had defeated them twice this sea
son and was expected to take the

Bears again.
First-half play, however,
suggested the outcome of the
game would be otherwise, as the
Bears outshot the Cards nine to
three and took a 1-0 lead.
The Bears' play was generally
effective and quickly executed,
especially on defense. Stanford
lagged on free halls, and that is
where they fell behind.
Stanford also faced certain
disadvantages. Injuries limited
leading scorer Cindy Shorney
and fullback Sarah Little. Height
also proved a problem: Stan
ford's team averages about
5-foot-6 (v. Berkeley's 5-foot
-7). Stanford invariably lost the
free air balls, thereby losing the
chance to generate many offen
sive moves.

Stanford picked up in the sec
ond half, making six shots to
Berkeley's four. However, of
fensive plays still lacked cohe
sion, and communication re
mained minimal, holding Stan
ford's efforts outside the goal.
Defensively. Stanford played
an excellent second half, mark
ing tight and clearing the endless
long boots Berkeley threw them.
Halfback Sue Handel played an
exceptional game, providing
consistent offensive-defensive
transitions with her near
impeccable dribbling and tackl
ing.
Frustrated by the Bears in a
1-0 upset that the whole team
felt shouldn't have happened,
the Cards turned to Sunday's
match against Chico. This was to

determine the third and fourth
places in the league. Chico had
also been defeated by the hoot
ers in prior season piay.
But the Cards were unable to
score, though they outshot Chico
2-1 throughout the 90 minutes of
play. The Cards threw away
many opportunities on too-long
lead balls into a cluttered Chico
defense.
Said assistant coach Tom Mil
ler: "They didn't work as a team
on the offense, taking the easy
passes and quick plays. They
went for the one-in-a-hundred
shots and passes."
Cindy Shorney's efforts to
push through an elbow-infested
Chico line notwithstanding, the
offense in general remained as
diffident as in the Berkeley
game.
Defensively, however, the
team played a superior game.
The marking was tight enough to
be a one-on-one. and the full
to-half clears kept Chico chasing
after SU passes: Said Miller:
"The defensive unit did a lot of
good things. They had a lot of
pressure on them, but they kept
up with it." Debbie Lum and
Suzie Abosch contributed espe
cially consistent support on the
fullback flanks.
Chico goals were scored on
through dribbles and shots taken
from in front of the goal, five
yards out.
Thus Stanford must acquiesce
to a fourth place standing, results
of these playoff consessions to
Berkeley and Chico. This is a
step down from the undefeated
record they have maintained for
the last two years. The playoffs
ended Stanford women's soccer
team's playing season, save for
the third annual Stanford Soccer
Invitational tournament to be
held May 10 and 11.
