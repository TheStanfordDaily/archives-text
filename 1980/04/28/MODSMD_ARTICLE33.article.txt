National University Rugby
Championships, the Stanford
rugby club was soundly defeated

players who were out for

In the second game, the Cards
met their hated rival, Cal. As the

did its chances for a berth in the

national championships. The
Bears ran to an embarrassing
16-3 victory.
"(Cal's) forward men were

"And no one on our team did
particularly well."
The two victors, Cal and Long
Beach, played each other yester
day in the tournament's final
round. Cal won the match and
the tournament.
