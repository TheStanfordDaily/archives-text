NEW YORK — Some
where in the United States, there
is a football player who, about 24
hours from now, will experience
what is known as mixed emo
tions. He will be selected by the
Pittsburgh Steelers in the first
round of the National Football
League draft.
He'll be joining a four-time
Super Bowl winner, a dynasty of
sorts. Very nice. The only prob
lem is, what's he going to do

when he gets there?
The Steelers have an all-pro
player at virtually every position,
which leads to a lot of lounging
around for the rookies. Last
year's No. 1 pick, for example,
was Greg Hawthorne, a running
back. He carried the ball all of 28
times for 123 yards in 1979 —
not much more than a routine
game for Franco Harris.
Not that being a No. 1 draft
choice by the Steelers is a ticket
to oblivion, mind you. Far from
it. Consider, if you will, that
among Pittsburgh's first-round
selections since 1969 are Harris,
linebacker Robin Cole, tight end
Bennie Cunningham, wide re
ceiver Lynn Swann, quarterback
Terry Bradshaw and defensive
tackle Joe Greene.
An educated guess is that the
Steelers, unless they trade to im
prove their drafting position
(28th, last in each round) or to
pick up a veteran in exchange for
their first-round pick, will come
away with a defensive lineman.
Among the candidates are ends
Jacob Green (Texas A&M), Jim
Stuckey (Clemson), Rulon Jones
(Utah State) and tackles Bruce
Clark (Penn State) and Doug
Martin (Washington).

A few hours before the Steel
ers complete the first round, the
Detroit Lions will start it. Also
barring a trade, they'll be taking
Billy Sims, the Oklahoma run
ning back. In the past few weeks,
Sims' agent, a former Houston
dentist named Jerry Argovitz,
has been talkingabout extracting
something in the neighborhood
of $750,000 a year from the
Lions' bank account to get Sims'
name on a contract. The Lions
have been mentioning numbers
about one-third that size.
The order of drafting (again,
barring any late trades) is De
troit, San Francisco, Cincinnati,
Green Bay, Baltimore, St. Louis,
Atlanta, New York Giants, Min
nesota, Buffalo, Kansas City,
New Orleans. New York Jets,
New England, Geveland, Oak
land, Seattle. Washington,
Chicago, the Jets from Denver
(in the Matt Robinson-Craig
Penrose deal), Miami, Tampa
Bay, Philadelphia, Baltimore
from Dallas (for John Dutton),
New England from Houston (for
Leon Gray), Green Bay from
San Diego (for Willie Bucha
non), Los Angeles and
Pittsburgh.
In all, there will be 12 rounds
covering two days of drafting,

wheeling and dealing.
Besides Sims and the
aforementioned defensive line
men, high-priority candidates
for the first round include run
ning backs Charles White
(Southern California) and Curtis
Dickey (Texas A&M), tight end
Junior Miller (Nebraska), wide
receiver Johnny "Lam" Jones
(Texas), and offensive linemen
Brad Budde and Anthony
Munoz (both Southern Cal).
Probably the brightest hope as
a first round draft pick from
Stanford will be Andre Hines, a
6-foot-6, 250 pound offensive
tackle from Oakland. Hines only
started for one year on the Farm,
last season, but has been making
a lot of pro scouts drool ever
since.
Heading the list of other prob
able draftees is Turk Schonert.
Schonert waited four years to
play on the Farm and then went
out last season and claimed
another NCAA passing crown
for Stanford. Chuck Evans, 6-4,
240, the team's defensive leader
last season at tackle and Terry
Rennaker, an outside
linebacker, round out the proba
bles from the Farm.

(Southern California) and Curtis
Dickey (Texas A&M), tight end
Junior Miller (Nebraska), wide
receiver Johnny "Lam" Jones
(Texas), and offensive linemen
Brad Budde and Anthony
Munoz (both Southern Cal).
Probably the brightest hope as
a first round draft pick from
Stanford will be Andre Hines, a
6-foot-6, 250 pound offensive
tackle from Oakland. Hines only
started for one year on the Farm,
last season, but has been making
a lot of pro scouts drool ever
since.
Heading the list of other prob
able draftees is Turk Schonert.
Schonert waited four years to
play on the Farm and then went
out last season and claimed
another NCAA passing crown
for Stanford. Chuck Evans, 6-4,
240, the team's defensive leader
last season at tackle and Terry
Rennaker, an outside
linebacker, round out the proba
bles from the Farm.

NEW YORK — Some
where in the United States, there
is a football player who, about 24
hours from now, will experience
what is known as mixed emo
tions. He will be selected by the
Pittsburgh Steelers in the first
round of the National Football
League draft.
He'll be joining a four-time
Super Bowl winner, a dynasty of
sorts. Very nice. The only prob
lem is, what's he going to do

when he gets there?
The Steelers have an all-pro
player at virtually every position,
which leads to a lot of lounging
around for the rookies. Last
year's No. 1 pick, for example,
was Greg Hawthorne, a running
back. He carried the ball all of 28
times for 123 yards in 1979 —
not much more than a routine
game for Franco Harris.
Not that being a No. 1 draft
choice by the Steelers is a ticket
to oblivion, mind you. Far from
it. Consider, if you will, that
among Pittsburgh's first-round
selections since 1969 are Harris,
linebacker Robin Cole, tight end
Bennie Cunningham, wide re
ceiver Lynn Swann, quarterback
Terry Bradshaw and defensive
tackle Joe Greene.
An educated guess is that the
Steelers, unless they trade to im
prove their drafting position
(28th, last in each round) or to
pick up a veteran in exchange for
their first-round pick, will come
away with a defensive lineman.
Among the candidates are ends
Jacob Green (Texas A&M), Jim
Stuckey (Clemson), Rulon Jones
(Utah State) and tackles Bruce
Clark (Penn State) and Doug
Martin (Washington).

A few hours before the Steel
ers complete the first round, the
Detroit Lions will start it. Also
barring a trade, they'll be taking
Billy Sims, the Oklahoma run
ning back. In the past few weeks,
Sims' agent, a former Houston
dentist named Jerry Argovitz,
has been talkingabout extracting
something in the neighborhood
of $750,000 a year from the
Lions' bank account to get Sims'
name on a contract. The Lions
have been mentioning numbers
about one-third that size.
The order of drafting (again,
barring any late trades) is De
troit, San Francisco, Cincinnati,
Green Bay, Baltimore, St. Louis,
Atlanta, New York Giants, Min
nesota, Buffalo, Kansas City,
New Orleans. New York Jets,
New England, Geveland, Oak
land, Seattle. Washington,
Chicago, the Jets from Denver
(in the Matt Robinson-Craig
Penrose deal), Miami, Tampa
Bay, Philadelphia, Baltimore
from Dallas (for John Dutton),
New England from Houston (for
Leon Gray), Green Bay from
San Diego (for Willie Bucha
non), Los Angeles and
Pittsburgh.
In all, there will be 12 rounds
covering two days of drafting,

wheeling and dealing.
Besides Sims and the
aforementioned defensive line
men, high-priority candidates
for the first round include run
ning backs Charles White
(Southern California) and Curtis
Dickey (Texas A&M), tight end
Junior Miller (Nebraska), wide
receiver Johnny "Lam" Jones
(Texas), and offensive linemen
Brad Budde and Anthony
Munoz (both Southern Cal).
Probably the brightest hope as
a first round draft pick from
Stanford will be Andre Hines, a
6-foot-6, 250 pound offensive
tackle from Oakland. Hines only
started for one year on the Farm,
last season, but has been making
a lot of pro scouts drool ever
since.
Heading the list of other prob
able draftees is Turk Schonert.
Schonert waited four years to
play on the Farm and then went

another NCAA passing crown
for Stanford. Chuck Evans, 6-4,
240, the team's defensive leader
last season at tackle and Terry
Rennaker, an outside
linebacker, round out the proba
