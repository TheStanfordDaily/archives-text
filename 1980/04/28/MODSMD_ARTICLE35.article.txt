# 'Too Tall' gives up boxing

The Associated Press
NASHVILLE, Tenn. — His
boxing career on the ropes, Ed
"Too Tall" Jones says he's ready
for a return to professional foot
ball — but not necessarily with
the Dallas Cowboys.
Jones, a No. 1 draft choice out
of Tennessee State in 1974 who
developed into one of the Na
tional Football League's premier
defensive ends while with the
Cowboys, admitted Saturday by
telephone from Dallas that his
pro boxing career had ended.
"I'm giving up boxing and re
turning to pro football," Jones
said. And then he hinted he
might welcome a bidding battle
among NFL clubs looking to
shore up their defensive lines
with a 6-foot-9,270-pound vete
ran.
"I consider myself a free
agent," the Jackson, Tenn., na
tive said. "I'll leave it to my at
torney to get me the best deal I
can. My first choice will be with
the Cowboys, but I'm not saying
for sure I'll go back to them. I'll
just wait and see what kind of
offers I get."
Jones said he had no regrets
about his move into pro boxing,
which spanned 10 months and

six heavyweight fights — all of
which he won.
"I would definitely do it again
if I had a chance to repeat his
tory," he said. "It was always
something I had to try. . . .
"I think the experience will
make me a better football player,
because I know that's what I'm
best at. With boxing behind me,
my concentration on football will
be better."
When Jones announced his
decision to go into boxing last

year, he said he was determined
to become the world
heavyweight champion, and that
nothing would stand in the way
of that goal.
Saturday, however, he said
simply he had changed his mind.
"Boxing wasn't what I thought
it would be," Jones said. "Box
ing is something that if you can't
enjoy it, then you should get out
of it. . . and 1 decided 1 didn't
enjoy it any longer."
