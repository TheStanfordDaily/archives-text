SEATTLE—The Seattle SuperSonic's trainer surely exer
cised bad judgment in allowing any of his players to handle
sharp objects after yesterday's game, but there was forward
Johnny Johnson, sitting on a bench in the varsity dressing room
at the Hec Edmundson Pavilion, glowering and slicing the tape
off his ankles.
He would have needed something sharper to cut the gloom
in the room. The Los Angeles Lakers had just whipped the
Sonics, 98-93, before a sold-out home crowd, a wrung-out
8524 fans in this quaint old campus gymnasium.
"It was embarrassing, what occured today," Johnson said.
The Lakers, down 21 points halfway into the third quarter,
unwilted, rowed back from somewhere out on nearby Union
Bay, and destroyed the Sonics with a little run 'n stun basket
ball.
The Lakers lead the best-of-seven Western Conference
championship series, three games to one. And now the scries
returns to Los Angeles, land of smog and bedbugs. Game five
is Wednesday night, at the Forum.
"They (the Sonics) claim they like to play with their backs
against the wall," said Laker center Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,
"and at this point, they're about to go over the wall."
Kareem, the Lakers' Mr. Playoffs, quickly qualified the
statement by saying, "We still have a great deal of respect for
the Sonics, but I think we can get it in L.A."
The Lakers won with the unlikely combination of perhaps
their worst first half of the season and maybe their finest
second half.
Down 21 points with 6:36 left in the third quarter, they
outscored the Sonics, 24 to 2. Then, down by four points with
4:22 left in the fourth quarter, they outscored the defending
world champs, 11-0.
The Sonics did make a late run at the Lakers, but when
downcast Freddy Brown missed a three-point attempt that
would have tied the game with 12 seconds left — it was
Brown's 1 Ith missed field goal in 11 tries — the Sonics wtre
dead.
The feeling wasn't so swell down the hall in the Sonic's
locker rooms. Johnny Johnson, for one, was disgusted.
"We gave them this one, believe me. It's disappointing. We
go to L.A. and bust our butt (winning one of two games), then
come back up here and practically give it away. Friday (a Laker
win here) they earned it because the Big Fella (Abdul-Jabbar)
was so awesome, but today we just gave it away."
