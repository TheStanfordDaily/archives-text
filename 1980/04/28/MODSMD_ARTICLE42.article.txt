The children's verse informs
us that April showers bring May
flowers. This year, besides the
usual array of spring sports, the
late winter rains gave way to the
first Stanford Spring Soccer
Showcase.
Represented in the innagural
event were Pacific Soccer Con
ference members San Jose State,
Santa Clara, Fresno State, Uni
versity of the Pacific, two Cal
teams and the Cardinals. Also
included in the invitational was
the University of Colorado.
Rather than placing an em
phasis on the outcomes of head
to-head competition as in most
tournament play, two days of
scrimmaging offered coaches
and players the opportunity to
substitute freely and evaluate
different formations and plays.
"1 don't think that the scores
were important," said Card
coach Nelson Lodge. "We made
sure that everybody played and
we tried out new systems.
"The best game for us was
against Fresno, one of the better
teams in the tournament. We
tied two of the best teams —
Fresno (a ()-() deadlock yester
day) and San Jose (a 1-1 match
Saturday)," Lodge said.
With the participation of good
soccer squads, fair weather and
interested spectators, the only
element missing from the event
was the presence of defending
NCAA champion University of
San Francisco.
"I'm surprised and disap
pointed about USF," Nelson
said, "because it was a confer
ence tournament. They had too
many players in the amateur
Sunday leagues who couldn't get
away." Additionally, the Dons
had several top team members in
the state soccer cup series held
yesterday in Los Angeles.
The Cards themselves were
missing several key players from
the team which earned a 14-5-2
mark last fall — the second best
record in modern Stanford his
tory. Stanford's 5-2 PSC total
was good for second place, the
best finish in school annals.
Among the missing athletes were
Willie Giucci. who is studying in
Berlin, Mark Toney and Rick
Gordon, according to Lodge.
"Those are players who would
make a difference on any team,
especially Giucci," Lodge ad
ded.

Giucci, a sophomore who will
play with his national team,
Uruguay, in the People's Repub
lic of China this summer, paced
the Cards with 20 goals and five
assists.
"I think the tournament as a
whole went well, but we'll have
to re-evaluate inviting outside
teams — they take the event dif
ferently (more seriously than the
exhibition was intended to be),"
Lodge explained. "We have to
be careful how we handle it (next
year) — we can't have two sea
sons."
Spring training thus far for the
Cards is "exceptional" in
Lodge's estimation. "We have
some players who didn't get to

play much in the fall who are get
ting to play now. Graham Legget
and Marc Shor are looking
strong and the first-string goalie.
Jeff Jones, is only a freshman and
he's going to improve."
Leggett, currently a freshman,
is a walk-on. Shor is a sopho
more who played as a second
string fullback during the regular
season but is earning his way into
the limelight.
Looking ahead to next year.
Lodge predicted that: "With ail
of our returnees and three re
cruits, we're going to be good."
In more off-season scrimmag
ing, Stanford plays host to Hay
ward State Thursday at 3 p.m. on
Maloney Field.
