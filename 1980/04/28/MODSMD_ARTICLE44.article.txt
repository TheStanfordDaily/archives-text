Kennedy seeks Chicano support
DETROIT — Sen. Edward Kennedy, bolstered by elec
tion victories ov or President Jimmy Carter in two industrial
states, headed yesterday for a visit to Mexico that may yield
new political dividends for Kennedy's presidential cam
paign.
The reason: the next big Carter-Kennedy primary test is
next Saturday in Texas, where Kennedy enjoys strong sup
port in the large Mexican-American community. That back
ing could be strengthened by Kennedy's meeting today with
Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo.
Hie Iran situation, too, could affect the outcome, but
Carter was favored to win a majority of the 152 delegate
votes at stake in Texas.
Ronald Reagan picked up 12 more delegates this
weekend in congressional district caucuses in Missouri and
Minnesota, lengthening his already-wide margin over
George Bush tor the Republican presidential nomination.
Kennedy won last week in Pennsylvania and Michigan by
the narrowest of margins and didn't make much of a dent in
Carter's wide lead in their contest for the 1666 delegate
votes needed for nomination at the Democratic National
Convention in August.
The latest total compiled by the Associated Press gave
Carter I 109 nominating votes and Kennedy 639.
The balloting in Missouri and Minnesota left Reagan with
429 delegates compared with Bush's 96. A total of 998
delegate votes is needed for the GOP nomination.

MICHIGAN CITY. Ind. — A food service worker and
six guards were taken hostage yesterday by about 35 appa
rently unarmed inmates at the Indiana State Prison. Three
of the hostages were released during the evening.
In another section of the prison. 200 other inmates bar
ricaded themselves inside, and held no hostages, officials
said.
"We have no reports of injuries. We do not believe the
inmates hav c weapons," said William Watt, executive assis
tant to Gov. Otis Bonen.
"Negotiations will continue through the night. We expect
a settlement by early morning, noon at the latest. There is a
tone of optimism." said State Sen. John Larson, chairman
of the Indiana Senate Corrections Committee.
One guard was released early on because he became ill.
After several hours, the inmates released two more guards
as a show of good iaith and began negotiations with state
officials. Two newsmen also were present.
Bill Warrick of South Bend television station WSBT. one
of the newsmen inside, said the inmates sought better medi
cal care, individual review of the cases of prisoners in the
security lockup and better news coverage of the prison.
They "also wanted amnesty for all inmates participating in
the incident.
About 100 state troopers stood guard in riot gear. County

and city police also were at the prison. "We do have more
state police being called in for backup." said Sgt. Larry
Dembinski. public information officer at the state police
post in nearby Lowell.
Watt and state police said after the first guard was re
leased. there were five guards and a food service worker
being held in the security area of the "C' cell block. But
Maj. Warren Jackson said only four guards and the food
service worker were held.

Chrysler loan board to meet today
DETROIT — Thousands of jobs. 10 percent of the na
tion's auto production and the future of one of the most
familiar names in U.S. industry could hangin the balance as
the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board meets today.
The board meets in Washington at the call of Treasury
Secretary William Miller, its chairman, who said he would
ask for a decision on the $1.5 billion in loan guarantees
Chrysler Corp. needs to survive.
His announcement last week of the meeting stepped up
the timetable of events. Earlier, he had said a decision on
the loan guarantees would take "several weeks."
Asked what would happen if Chrysler is turned down, the
company's top spokesman, vice president Wendell Larsen.
said. "It is mconceiv able that they would turn us down, and
the worst thing that could happen would be delay."
The tottering No. 3 automaker is perilously low on cash
and has not met all the interlocking goals of the legislation
that established the guarantees last December.
A federal official close to the situation noted that
Chrysler had to demonstrate it would be self-financing and
a going concern by 1983. Such a demonstration will be
"tough." he said, and carrying it out will be "hard, real
hard."
Even if the guarantees are approved. Chrysler cannot get
its hands on any of the money for 15 days, a waiting period
written into the law to give Congress a chance to change its
mind.
26 Trident protesters still held
GROTON. Conn. — Twenty-six of the 211 protesters
arrested at the christening of the nation's second Trident
submarine remained in custody yesterday, held because
they refused to tell police their names.
The 26 are scheduled to appear today in New London
Superior Court.
Demonstrators objected to the cost of the submarine and
the nuclear missiles it will carry.
Most of the 211 peaceful protesters were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges Saturday after they stepped
from among more than 850 demonstrators and lay down in
front of the gates of the Electric Boat shipyard.
All but 26 of the arrested were released after they iden
tified themselves and promised to appear in court during

the next few weeks. They were from several New England
states and Michigan.
Some 5000 persons gathered to watch the christening of
the $1.2 billion USS Michigan by Margaret Garvey Ned/i,
wife of a Michigan congressman.
The Michigan was planned as a 560-foot high-speed un
derwater launching platform for multiple-warhead inter
continental ballistic missiles, with a range of 4000 miles.
The Michigan remained in its construction slip throughout
the launch ceremony, too large and heavy to be slid down
launching ways as other smaller submarines are.
34 U.S. ships now in Indian Ocean
WASHINGTON — U.S. naval strength in the Indian
Ocean area reached a record lev el yesterday with the arrival
of the aircraft carrier Constellation and six escorting war
ships.
This brings to about 34 the number of American naval
ships operating in the vast Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea-
Persian Gulf area.
There were 31 ships in the area last month.
The Defense Department announced the arrival of the
Constellation and said that the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier Eisenhower and two nuclear-propelled cruisers are
due to enter the Indian Ocean tomorrow.
The Constellation battle group and the Eisenhower force
are due to relieve two aircraft carriers, the nuclear-powered
Nimitz and the Coral Sea, which have been on station in the
Arabian Sea-Gulf of Oman for months.
It will take several days for the Constellation and
Eisenhower to reach their stations and replace the Nimitz

and the Coral Sea, which means that for at least a brief
period the United States will have four of its 13 aircraft
carriers in the Indian Ocean area.
At last report, the Soviets had 26 ships in those same
general waters, about five fewer than the peak Russian
naval force there in late February.
Officials said the arrival of the Constellation from the
Pacific and the Eisenhower from the Atlantic are not con
nected with the heated up crisis over the ill-fated American
attempt to rescue 53 hostages held in Iran late last week.
Lance jury struggles over verdict
ATLANTA — Deadlocked after six days of delibera
tions, the jury in former U.S. budget director Bert Lance's
bank fraud trial returns to court today for new instructions.
Defense lawyers say they want to know if the six men and
six women on the jury have reached agreement on some of
the 19 charges against the former federal budget director
and three associates.
"I think we are going to insist that the judge receive and
publish those verdicts that have been reached," said attor
ney Erwin Mitchell, who represents two of Lance's co
defendants.
The jurors announced Saturday that they had reached the
end of the road after 33 hours of sifting evidence and
debating verdicts.
"We're ready to go home," juror William Savage told a
deputy marshal at 2:09 p.m.
But U.S. District Judge Charles Moye, reached by tele
phone, told the jurors to stick to their task i'or the rest of the
afternoon.

Kennedy seeks Chicano support
DETROIT — Sen. Edward Kennedy, bolstered by elec
tion victories ov or President Jimmy Carter in two industrial
states, headed yesterday for a visit to Mexico that may yield
new political dividends for Kennedy's presidential cam
paign.
The reason: the next big Carter-Kennedy primary test is
next Saturday in Texas, where Kennedy enjoys strong sup
port in the large Mexican-American community. That back
ing could be strengthened by Kennedy's meeting today with
Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo.
Hie Iran situation, too, could affect the outcome, but
Carter was favored to win a majority of the 152 delegate
votes at stake in Texas.
Ronald Reagan picked up 12 more delegates this
weekend in congressional district caucuses in Missouri and
Minnesota, lengthening his already-wide margin over
George Bush tor the Republican presidential nomination.
Kennedy won last week in Pennsylvania and Michigan by
the narrowest of margins and didn't make much of a dent in
Carter's wide lead in their contest for the 1666 delegate
votes needed for nomination at the Democratic National
Convention in August.
The latest total compiled by the Associated Press gave
Carter I 109 nominating votes and Kennedy 639.
The balloting in Missouri and Minnesota left Reagan with
429 delegates compared with Bush's 96. A total of 998
delegate votes is needed for the GOP nomination.

MICHIGAN CITY. Ind. — A food service worker and
six guards were taken hostage yesterday by about 35 appa
rently unarmed inmates at the Indiana State Prison. Three
of the hostages were released during the evening.
In another section of the prison. 200 other inmates bar
ricaded themselves inside, and held no hostages, officials
said.
"We have no reports of injuries. We do not believe the
inmates hav c weapons," said William Watt, executive assis
tant to Gov. Otis Bonen.
"Negotiations will continue through the night. We expect
a settlement by early morning, noon at the latest. There is a
tone of optimism." said State Sen. John Larson, chairman
of the Indiana Senate Corrections Committee.
One guard was released early on because he became ill.
After several hours, the inmates released two more guards
as a show of good iaith and began negotiations with state
officials. Two newsmen also were present.
Bill Warrick of South Bend television station WSBT. one
of the newsmen inside, said the inmates sought better medi
cal care, individual review of the cases of prisoners in the
security lockup and better news coverage of the prison.
They "also wanted amnesty for all inmates participating in
the incident.
About 100 state troopers stood guard in riot gear. County

and city police also were at the prison. "We do have more
state police being called in for backup." said Sgt. Larry
Dembinski. public information officer at the state police
post in nearby Lowell.
Watt and state police said after the first guard was re
leased. there were five guards and a food service worker
being held in the security area of the "C' cell block. But

Chrysler loan board to meet today
DETROIT — Thousands of jobs. 10 percent of the na
tion's auto production and the future of one of the most
familiar names in U.S. industry could hangin the balance as
the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board meets today.
The board meets in Washington at the call of Treasury
Secretary William Miller, its chairman, who said he would
ask for a decision on the $1.5 billion in loan guarantees
Chrysler Corp. needs to survive.
His announcement last week of the meeting stepped up
the timetable of events. Earlier, he had said a decision on
the loan guarantees would take "several weeks."
Asked what would happen if Chrysler is turned down, the
company's top spokesman, vice president Wendell Larsen.
said. "It is mconceiv able that they would turn us down, and
the worst thing that could happen would be delay."
The tottering No. 3 automaker is perilously low on cash
and has not met all the interlocking goals of the legislation
that established the guarantees last December.
A federal official close to the situation noted that
Chrysler had to demonstrate it would be self-financing and
a going concern by 1983. Such a demonstration will be
"tough." he said, and carrying it out will be "hard, real
hard."
Even if the guarantees are approved. Chrysler cannot get
its hands on any of the money for 15 days, a waiting period
written into the law to give Congress a chance to change its
mind.
26 Trident protesters still held
GROTON. Conn. — Twenty-six of the 211 protesters
arrested at the christening of the nation's second Trident
submarine remained in custody yesterday, held because
they refused to tell police their names.
The 26 are scheduled to appear today in New London
Superior Court.
Demonstrators objected to the cost of the submarine and
the nuclear missiles it will carry.
Most of the 211 peaceful protesters were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges Saturday after they stepped
from among more than 850 demonstrators and lay down in
front of the gates of the Electric Boat shipyard.
All but 26 of the arrested were released after they iden
tified themselves and promised to appear in court during

the next few weeks. They were from several New England
states and Michigan.
Some 5000 persons gathered to watch the christening of
the $1.2 billion USS Michigan by Margaret Garvey Ned/i,
wife of a Michigan congressman.
The Michigan was planned as a 560-foot high-speed un
derwater launching platform for multiple-warhead inter
continental ballistic missiles, with a range of 4000 miles.
The Michigan remained in its construction slip throughout
the launch ceremony, too large and heavy to be slid down
launching ways as other smaller submarines are.
34 U.S. ships now in Indian Ocean
WASHINGTON — U.S. naval strength in the Indian
Ocean area reached a record lev el yesterday with the arrival
of the aircraft carrier Constellation and six escorting war
ships.
This brings to about 34 the number of American naval
ships operating in the vast Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea-
Persian Gulf area.
There were 31 ships in the area last month.
The Defense Department announced the arrival of the
Constellation and said that the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier Eisenhower and two nuclear-propelled cruisers are
due to enter the Indian Ocean tomorrow.
The Constellation battle group and the Eisenhower force
are due to relieve two aircraft carriers, the nuclear-powered
Nimitz and the Coral Sea, which have been on station in the
Arabian Sea-Gulf of Oman for months.
It will take several days for the Constellation and
Eisenhower to reach their stations and replace the Nimitz

and the Coral Sea, which means that for at least a brief
period the United States will have four of its 13 aircraft
carriers in the Indian Ocean area.
At last report, the Soviets had 26 ships in those same
general waters, about five fewer than the peak Russian
naval force there in late February.
Officials said the arrival of the Constellation from the
Pacific and the Eisenhower from the Atlantic are not con
nected with the heated up crisis over the ill-fated American
attempt to rescue 53 hostages held in Iran late last week.
Lance jury struggles over verdict
ATLANTA — Deadlocked after six days of delibera

six women on the jury have reached agreement on some of
the 19 charges against the former federal budget director

Kennedy seeks Chicano support
DETROIT — Sen. Edward Kennedy, bolstered by elec
tion victories ov or President Jimmy Carter in two industrial
states, headed yesterday for a visit to Mexico that may yield
new political dividends for Kennedy's presidential cam
paign.
The reason: the next big Carter-Kennedy primary test is
next Saturday in Texas, where Kennedy enjoys strong sup
port in the large Mexican-American community. That back
ing could be strengthened by Kennedy's meeting today with
Mexican President Jose Lopez Portillo.
Hie Iran situation, too, could affect the outcome, but
Carter was favored to win a majority of the 152 delegate
votes at stake in Texas.
Ronald Reagan picked up 12 more delegates this
weekend in congressional district caucuses in Missouri and
Minnesota, lengthening his already-wide margin over
George Bush tor the Republican presidential nomination.
Kennedy won last week in Pennsylvania and Michigan by
the narrowest of margins and didn't make much of a dent in
Carter's wide lead in their contest for the 1666 delegate
votes needed for nomination at the Democratic National
Convention in August.
The latest total compiled by the Associated Press gave
Carter I 109 nominating votes and Kennedy 639.
The balloting in Missouri and Minnesota left Reagan with
429 delegates compared with Bush's 96. A total of 998
delegate votes is needed for the GOP nomination.
Indiana inmates take guards hostage
MICHIGAN CITY. Ind. — A food service worker and
six guards were taken hostage yesterday by about 35 appa
rently unarmed inmates at the Indiana State Prison. Three
of the hostages were released during the evening.
In another section of the prison. 200 other inmates bar
ricaded themselves inside, and held no hostages, officials
said.
"We have no reports of injuries. We do not believe the
inmates hav c weapons," said William Watt, executive assis
tant to Gov. Otis Bonen.
"Negotiations will continue through the night. We expect
a settlement by early morning, noon at the latest. There is a
tone of optimism." said State Sen. John Larson, chairman
of the Indiana Senate Corrections Committee.
One guard was released early on because he became ill.
After several hours, the inmates released two more guards
as a show of good iaith and began negotiations with state
officials. Two newsmen also were present.
Bill Warrick of South Bend television station WSBT. one
of the newsmen inside, said the inmates sought better medi
cal care, individual review of the cases of prisoners in the
security lockup and better news coverage of the prison.
They "also wanted amnesty for all inmates participating in
the incident.
About 100 state troopers stood guard in riot gear. County

and city police also were at the prison. "We do have more
state police being called in for backup." said Sgt. Larry
Dembinski. public information officer at the state police
post in nearby Lowell.
Watt and state police said after the first guard was re
leased. there were five guards and a food service worker
being held in the security area of the "C' cell block. But
Maj. Warren Jackson said only four guards and the food
service worker were held.
No names were released.
Chrysler loan board to meet today
DETROIT — Thousands of jobs. 10 percent of the na
tion's auto production and the future of one of the most
familiar names in U.S. industry could hangin the balance as
the Chrysler Loan Guarantee Board meets today.
The board meets in Washington at the call of Treasury
Secretary William Miller, its chairman, who said he would
ask for a decision on the $1.5 billion in loan guarantees
Chrysler Corp. needs to survive.
His announcement last week of the meeting stepped up
the timetable of events. Earlier, he had said a decision on
the loan guarantees would take "several weeks."
Asked what would happen if Chrysler is turned down, the
company's top spokesman, vice president Wendell Larsen.
said. "It is mconceiv able that they would turn us down, and
the worst thing that could happen would be delay."
The tottering No. 3 automaker is perilously low on cash
and has not met all the interlocking goals of the legislation
that established the guarantees last December.
A federal official close to the situation noted that
Chrysler had to demonstrate it would be self-financing and
a going concern by 1983. Such a demonstration will be
"tough." he said, and carrying it out will be "hard, real
hard."
Even if the guarantees are approved. Chrysler cannot get
its hands on any of the money for 15 days, a waiting period
written into the law to give Congress a chance to change its
mind.
26 Trident protesters still held
GROTON. Conn. — Twenty-six of the 211 protesters
arrested at the christening of the nation's second Trident
submarine remained in custody yesterday, held because
they refused to tell police their names.
The 26 are scheduled to appear today in New London
Superior Court.
Demonstrators objected to the cost of the submarine and
the nuclear missiles it will carry.
Most of the 211 peaceful protesters were arrested on
disorderly conduct charges Saturday after they stepped
from among more than 850 demonstrators and lay down in
front of the gates of the Electric Boat shipyard.
All but 26 of the arrested were released after they iden
tified themselves and promised to appear in court during

the next few weeks. They were from several New England
states and Michigan.
Some 5000 persons gathered to watch the christening of
the $1.2 billion USS Michigan by Margaret Garvey Ned/i,
wife of a Michigan congressman.
The Michigan was planned as a 560-foot high-speed un
derwater launching platform for multiple-warhead inter
continental ballistic missiles, with a range of 4000 miles.
The Michigan remained in its construction slip throughout
the launch ceremony, too large and heavy to be slid down
launching ways as other smaller submarines are.
34 U.S. ships now in Indian Ocean
WASHINGTON — U.S. naval strength in the Indian
Ocean area reached a record lev el yesterday with the arrival
of the aircraft carrier Constellation and six escorting war
ships.
This brings to about 34 the number of American naval
ships operating in the vast Indian Ocean-Arabian Sea-
Persian Gulf area.
There were 31 ships in the area last month.
The Defense Department announced the arrival of the
Constellation and said that the nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier Eisenhower and two nuclear-propelled cruisers are
due to enter the Indian Ocean tomorrow.
The Constellation battle group and the Eisenhower force
are due to relieve two aircraft carriers, the nuclear-powered
Nimitz and the Coral Sea, which have been on station in the
Arabian Sea-Gulf of Oman for months.
It will take several days for the Constellation and
Eisenhower to reach their stations and replace the Nimitz

and the Coral Sea, which means that for at least a brief
period the United States will have four of its 13 aircraft
carriers in the Indian Ocean area.
At last report, the Soviets had 26 ships in those same
general waters, about five fewer than the peak Russian
naval force there in late February.
Officials said the arrival of the Constellation from the
Pacific and the Eisenhower from the Atlantic are not con
nected with the heated up crisis over the ill-fated American
attempt to rescue 53 hostages held in Iran late last week.
