Many students may he happy that
the next week's Harry Chapin concert
is free.
But ASSU Special Events Office, the
dance and drama departments and the
office of Public Events are not.
One of these departments is respon
sible for the double-booking of Memo
rial Auditorium, where the concert was
to have been held. But no one seems
certain which one. The department
that made the mistake must pay the
concert tab, estimated to be in excess of
$10,000, according to Dean of Student
Affairs James Lyons.
But that question, which already has
been discussed for more than three
months, remains unresolved, Lyons
said.
The free concert will be held in Frost
Amphitheater.
Said John Harris, director of Special
Events, "Our attitude is if windows get
smashed up at a concert, we pay. If we
make mistakes, we have to pay for it.
But it's not fair to charge students for a
mistake the ASSU Special Events of
fice did not make."
According to Vicky Holt, director of
Public Events, both the Dance De
partment and ASSU Special Events
requested use of Mem Aud for the
evening of May 2.
Dance request
Both were told they could use the
facility. The Dance Department, hop
ing to use Mem Aud for its annual
dance production, unofficially re
quested the facility by contacting the
Drama Department in November
1979, Holt said.
Because the Dance Department ap
parently believed the dance event was
an academic affair, it did not get the
required written'approval to use Mem
Aud from the Office of Public Events,
according to Holt. She said the Public
Events office must confirm all non
academic room scheduling.
On Jan. 24, ASSU Special Events
was told by phone that it could use
Mem Aud. The same day, the Drama

Department realized it already had
told the Dance Department it had the
building for May 2, Holt said.
An oversight
Apparently, the double-booking oc
curred when the Drama Department
overlooked the previous commitment
it had made two months earlier to the
Dance Department, Holt said.
The Office of Public Events then de
cided to grant the Dance Department
use of Mem Aud since it had made the
request two months before ASSU Spe
cial Events.
The question over who will foot the
bill is complicated by the fact that the
Drama Department may not have the
funds to pay for the concert, a Univer
sity official who requested anonymity
said yesterday.
No Drama Department spokesmen
could be reached for comment.
Free concert
Though Harris said ASSU Special
Events considered charging $5 or $6
fee for the concert partially to cover the
concert's cost, he added "that fee is not
an accurate reflection of Chapin's qual
ity as an acoustic guitarist. Next time he
came around, we'd have to charge
more."
Because Frost cannot be used at
flight, the event was rescheduled for

the afternoon of May 2, a Friday. Har
ris said since that is a workday, it would
have been ver> difficult to sell the con
cert, so the free concert option was
considered seriously.
"If we charge for the concert, we'd
have an obligation to advertise for it.
We'd have to pay ticket collectors and
there would be other costs. We just felt
the costs would far outweigh the be
nefits. And if we just canceled the con
cert, we'd still have to pay the artist.
We have a contract," Harris said.
Harmful results
He added one of the harmful results
of the mix-up is that ASSU Special
Events may have jeopardized its rela
tions with agents and artists for future
concert bookings. â– 
"The artist, agent and manager are
not at all happy about what happened,"
he said.
Chapin had agreed to give a con
cert here because he wanted to play for
the intimate audience that could have
been provided in Mem Aud, Harris
said. "He's agreed to do it in Frost, but
I don't know how happy he is about it."
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons and Director of Student Ac
tivities Thomas Massey are negotiating
with the departments invovled to de
termine an equitable solution to the
problem.
