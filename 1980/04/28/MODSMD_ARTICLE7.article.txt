Several Stanford professors de
nounced last Thursday night's aborted
attempt to rescue the American hos
tages in Iran as dangerous, poorly exe
cuted, foolish and an exhibit of inep
titude.
Political Science Prof. Hubert Mar
shall described the failure as. "One last
episode in a long line of administrative
failures. It makes the administration
appear to be inept." Marshall con
demned President Jimmy Carter for
overemphasizing the hostage situation.
"Carter is guilty of having kept the
attention of the Americans on the hos
tages rather than calming things
down," he said.
Peter Duignan, curator of the
Hoover Institution's Africa and Middle
East collections further proclaimed
Carter's guilt and accused the president
of seeking political favor.
"I believe it was in part due to Car
ter's desire to gain political glory. It was
foolish, dangerous, and not a prudent
thing to do," Duignan said.
Duignan explained Carter's move as
an attempt to relieve political pressure
for him to act.
"It was the desperate act of a desper
ate president," he said.
Political Science Prof. Jan Triska's
reaction to the mission was one of
"shock and sadness." Triska said he
views the episode as unfortunate.
"Measured in terms of successor fai
lure. it shows our lack of ability to carry

out carefully designed plans. It was
poorly executed," he said.
These viewpoints extend to mem
bers of the student body. Jack Landy, a
member of People Against Military In
tervention in Iran, spoke against Car
ter's military moves.
"I am completely opposed to the
military action in Iran. It was an act of
war."
Landy said he fears that the recent
military action "will only further iso
late America in its struggle and defi
nitely stall processes for the release of
the hostages. This is exactly what we
were fearing. If Iran does do something
to the hostages. Carter's only option
will be to engage in military action."
Duignan said he is also concerned
about the risks the United States has
taken in regard to its allies.
"We've put too much pressure on
our allies — we're risking our allies
saying they won't support us."
Another common concern is the
Soviet question. Despite the Iranian
governments' statement which says
Iran would consider any Russian inter
vention an act of aggression, Triska
said he fears possible Soviet invasion.
"They could use this to attempt a
takeover. I don't think Russia would
invade at this time, but we must re
member the Soviets are on the border
and would use their allies in Iran to
stage such a takeover," Triska said.
Marshall echoed Triska's doubts,
and cited the Russian Treaty of 192 las
Russia's legitimate excuse to intervene
in Iran. According to Marshall, the tre
aty gives Russia the legal right to oc
cupy northern Iran if any major power
invades southern Iran.
Russian occupation of Iran would
allow Russia to protect its southern
border and also provide the Soviet
Union easy access to the Persian Gulf.
All three professors agreed that the
Soviet Union would not hesitate to in
tervene if the United States took
further military action against Iran.
There are also those on campus who
support Carter's attempt to rescue the

hostages. Peter Pierce, a member of
Students Against Soviet Aggression,
favored Carter's military move. Ac
cording to Pierce, diplomatic channels
had been stifled and the action was jus
tified.
Pierce defended ti , « rescue attempt
in the eyes of our J.ies saying, "It
shows that the U.S. is willing to do
things— that we're not paper tigers."
Pierce also pointed to the U.S.' moral
right to make such an attempt.
"The Iranian government has viol
ated International Law. If it takes
military action to free the hostages,
then that's right."
