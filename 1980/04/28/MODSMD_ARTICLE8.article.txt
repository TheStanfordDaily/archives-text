BOGOTA, Colombia — Guerrillas ended their 61-day
occupation of the Dominican Republic Embassy yesterday,
flying aboard a Cuban jetliner to Havana where they were
granted political asylum. All 16 of their diplomatic hos
tages, including U.S. Ambassador Diego Asencio, were
freed.
The ambassadors from Venezuela, the Dominican Re
public, Israel and Egypt were released just before the
Soviet-built Ilyushin jet took off at K:2O a.m., about IV2
hours after the guerillas left the embassy with their hostages
in two Red Cross buses for the Bogota airport.
The others, including Asencio and the papal nuncio, were
flown to Havana along with the guerrilla band, then set free,
according to reports from Havana and Washington. Shortly
after the siege began, Cuban President Fidel Castro offered
the guerrillas asylum.
From Havana, Asencio was flown on a charter plane to
Homestead Air Force Base in southern Florida where he
was met by his wife, Nancy, other members of his family and
government officials. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance sent a
message praising the diplomat's courage and said he was
"proud of the manner you have conducted yourself through
the long siege."
"I'm here," exclaimed Asencio as he came down the
stairs of the plane, stepped on Cuban soil and received bear
hugs from his fellow Americans.
"Fcrgy, hey. how arc you?" he beamed to Ferguson Reid.
a State Department doctor on hand.
It was the end of a 61-day ordeal and all diplomatic
protocol was out the door. Ambassadors from a do/en
nations waiting on the runway worked their way through
the throng, pulling at sleeves, kissing and slapping backs.
Asencio. who looked well and relaxed and had grown a

beard, said that he wanted to return to the Colombian
capital "because I have a lot of unfinished business to attend
to."
Asked how he was treated during captivity, Asencio said,
"After the first 72 hours, which were very difficult and
dangerous, we were treated correctly and cordially."
A State Department spokesman said Asencio would rest
at the air base until tomorrow when a White House jet will
take him to Washington to report to President Jimmy Car
ter.
The other diplomats were to return to Bogota or headed
home from Havana. They were met by Cuban officials upon
their arrival there.
According to a Colombian Foreign Ministry official,
other hostage diplomats aboard the flight to Havana be
sides Asencio were: the ambassadors of Mexico, Brazil,
Switzerland, Haiti, Guatemala, the papal nuncio, the
charges d'affaires of Paraguay and Bolivia and the consuls
of Peru. Venezuela, and Guatemala.
Also on board was the Cuban ambassador to Colombia,
relief agency officials, and officials from international or
ganizations that helped mediate an end to the dispute.
Prensa Latina, the official Cuban news agency, issued the
same list.
Details of the settlement were not immediately known,
but the guerrillas left the country without gaining the re
lease of jailed comrades, as they had originally demanded.
They had also originally demanded a ransom of $50 million
and worldwide publication of their manifesto, neither of
which they got.
They were reported, however, to have won international
guarantees governing the conduct of political trials and
other assurances their rights would be protected.
There also was a report, unconfirmed, that a $2.5 million
ransom would be paid.
