LONDONâ€”The aborted
I'.S. military mission to rescue
the American hostages held in
Iran has increased fears among
the allies of a dangerous further
escalation of the crisis.
Although government offi
cials were reluctant to discuss it
publicly, there also was concern
about the timing of the operation
just after the European allies had
agreed to impose economic and
diplomatic sanctions on Iran
primarily to forestall any U.S.
military moves.
Allies not consulted
The allies were not consulted
or informed in advance about the
rescue mission, according to

government spokesmen in
European capitals. But Foreign
Secretary Lord Carrington said
Britain had been informed of the
possibility of a rescue attempt
"in confidential diplomatic
channels" some time ago.
He and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher each tirst
heard on early morning radio
broadcasts about the White
House announcement of the
mission's failure. Later, the al
lied leaders were sent brief mes
sages by the White House.
Not critical
Carrington said "we don't
want to be too critical" of the
United States, and he agreed
with what he said would be Pres
ident Carter's belief that there is

a distinction between a rescue
mission like this and "an act of
force or warlike action against
Iran." such as a naval blockade
or the mining of its harbors.
"If it had been a success, we
would all have been applaud
ing,"Carringtion said. "I'm ex
tremely sorry that it didn't suc
ceed." But Peter Shore, foreign
affairs spokesman for Britain's
opposition Labor Party, said
"the world will be holding its
breath this weekend." He added
that "it is important that the gov -
ernments of the West make plain
to the United States that warlike
measures will not work" to force
the release of the hostages and
instead threaten world peace.
He said the United States

"should have taken its principal
friends and partners into its con
fidence" about the mission after
havingsuccessfull) pressed them
to join in economic and diploma
tic sanctions against Iran.
Italy opposes force
Italian Foreign Minister
Emilio Colombo informed the
U.S. government of ktalv's "clear
opposition to the recourse to ac
tion of force in any circumstance
for the liberation of the hos
tages." according to a statement
by the Italian Foreign Ministry in
Rome.
Japanese. Foreign Minister
Saburo Okita said he was "wor
ried and seriously concerned that
the U.S. action this time may led
to armed action in the future."
"1 trust that in the days ahead
there will be a ureat deal of re
straint shown by all parties." said
Australian Foreign Minister
Andrew Peacock.
Withholding cooperation
Amidst indications of growing
political opposition to necessary
legislation to enable Britain to
impose sanctions on Iran, prom
inent left-wing Labor members
of Parliament introduced a re
solution calling on the British
government to inform President
Carter that "unless the U.S. go\ -
ernment gives assurance" that
no more military action will be
taken "the British government
will withhold cooperation on
economic sanctions."
French government sources
complained Friday about being
told that supporting sanctions
was the way to avoid military ac
tion. only to have this mission
mounted shortly after the Euro
pean governments had made
their difficult decision to impose
sanctions.
The French and West German
governments refused to make
public statements on the aborted
rescue mission. West German
government spokesman Klaus
Boelling said only that Chancel
lor Helmut Schmidt had not
been informed in advance and
first learned about it from news
agency dispatches.
