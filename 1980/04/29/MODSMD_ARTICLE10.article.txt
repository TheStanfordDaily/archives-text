# Soviet rule in Afghanistan suffers setbacks
## 
### Tyler Marshall The Los Angeles Times 
NEW DELHI, India — "All
powers of the state are now in the
hands of the people of Afghanis
tan." crackled the voice of Radio
Kabul two years ago.
The announcement signaled
the success of a bloody coup that
erased the last traces of Af
ghanistan's monarchy and
brought a shadowy band of Mar
xist fanatics and little-known
military officers to power.
They were arrogant and ruth
less, yet politically inept, and it
took barely 19 months to gener
ate a grass-roots, nationwide re
volt against their policies of re
form.
Far from giving power to the
people of Afghanistan, the Mar
xists delivered their fiercely in
dependent nation into the arms
of the Soviet Union, tearing its
social and economic fabric to
shreds in the process.
Today — in the wake of the
Soviet Union's year-end inva
sion, ostensibly at the invitation
of the government in Kabul —
Afghan government officials
take orders from the cadre of
Soviet civilian bureaucrats that
runs most of the nation's minis
tries.
Soviets. not Afghans, now dic
tate strategy in the war to wipe
out the stubborn anti
government insurgency waged
by the Moslem rebels, known as
Moujaheadeen.
Strict control
The Soviets are even reported
to strictly control access to Af
ghan President Babrak Karmal,
the man they installed last De
cember.
According to reports from Af
ghan government officers who
have lied the country in recent
weeks, the Soviets in govern
ment offices deport themselves
like representatives of a colonial
administration.
"If a deputy minister wants
something from a Russian in his

ministry, he can't summon the
Russian, he must get an ap
pointment and go to his office,"
one senior government officer
said.
Widespread purges of
thousands of "counter
revolutionaries" in the two years
since the coup have decimated
Afghanistan's small corps of
well-educated, capable bureauc
rats.
Escape
Many of those few remaining
competent Afghan civil servants
are plotting their escape from the
country.
Reports reaching here earlier
last week indicated that the gov
ernor of Herat province was ar
rested trying to flee across the
Iranian border after engaging in
a plot to kill a number of Soviets.
The urge to desert the regime
and its Soviet masters is just as
strong in the military, where
major elements of the once pro
fessional army of 80,000 have
disintegrated under the weightof
purges, desertions and casualties
sustained during their campaign
against insurgents.
There are no accurate figures
on the present size of the Afghan
army, but some Western intelli
gence sources pi ace it at less than
half its original strength.
Economic problems
In the economic area, the
drain on the small pool of re
maining bureaucratic talent in
Afghanistan makes it difficult for
the government to confront bal
looning problems. Many now
feel they can be solved only with
massive Soviet aid.
As the cost of pacifying anti
government activity grows, tax
revenues have trailed off sharp
ly-
According to a senior gov
ernment official who left the
country in recent weeks, a tax
placed on imports from the
West, once a principal source of
government revenue, now gen
erates only a fraction of what it

did a year ago. Most of the coun
try's imports now come from the
Soviet Union.
"The Russians are finding it
harder than they thought." said
one former Kabul bureaucrat.
"Our culture is hard for foreign
ers to understand. We were
raised with guns and often don't
obey even our fathers, let alone
the government or foreigners.
"The Soviets can't go freely
into the bazaars because the
people hate them. If they can't
communicate with the common
people, they will never under
stand their point of view."
The gloomy picture facing the
Sovietsand their Afghan Marxist
regime is a far cry from the ex
citement that filled the streets ol
Kabul two years ago.
The Soviet leaders smugly
celebrate the extension of their
ideology across the Oxus River
to the crossroads of western

Asia. Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev, in a congratulatory
message to the poet
schoolteacher named Nur
Mohammed Taraki who led the
coup, spoke glowingly of joint
development with full respect for
Afghanistan's national
sovereignty and the doctrine of
non-interference.
Meanwhile, the triumphant
Taraki met with his new Cabinet
of ideologues and erstwhile tank
commanders to map out reforms
that he promised would catapult
Afghanistan into the 20th cen
tury.
But the people of Afghanistan
rejected both Marxism and the
20th century. Meanwhile, the
revolutionary leaders were too
preoccupied with a series of
bloody vendettas to tailor their
policies to the realities of their
staunchly Islamic, underde
veloped nation.
Cultivating his own image as

the benevolent father figure,
Taraki delegated the hatchet
work of eliminating state
enemies to his right-hand man
and prime minister, Hafizullah
Amin.
It was a job Amin took on with
zeal. He jailed thousands and by
early last year it was estimated
that between 100 and 150 politi
cal prisoners a night were being
executed in the Kabul valley.
By last September, Amin de
cided that it was Taraki's own
turn to die. The leader of the re
volution was killed in a shootout
on the stairs of the presidential
palace. Amin patched up the bul
let holes and ruled for four
months, earning himself the title
of most hated man in recent Af
ghan history.
He died when the Soviets de
cided that Afghanistan's Marxist
experiment could survive only at
gunpoint — with the Soviets
holding the gun.

army, but some Western intelli
gence sources pi ace it at less than
half its original strength.
Economic problems
In the economic area, the
drain on the small pool of re
maining bureaucratic talent in
Afghanistan makes it difficult for
the government to confront bal
looning problems. Many now
feel they can be solved only with
massive Soviet aid.
As the cost of pacifying anti
government activity grows, tax
revenues have trailed off sharp
ly-
According to a senior gov
ernment official who left the
country in recent weeks, a tax
placed on imports from the
West, once a principal source of
government revenue, now gen
erates only a fraction of what it

did a year ago. Most of the coun
try's imports now come from the
Soviet Union.
"The Russians are finding it
harder than they thought." said
one former Kabul bureaucrat.
"Our culture is hard for foreign
ers to understand. We were
raised with guns and often don't
obey even our fathers, let alone
the government or foreigners.
"The Soviets can't go freely
into the bazaars because the
people hate them. If they can't
communicate with the common
people, they will never under
stand their point of view."
The gloomy picture facing the
Sovietsand their Afghan Marxist
regime is a far cry from the ex
citement that filled the streets ol
Kabul two years ago.
The Soviet leaders smugly
celebrate the extension of their
ideology across the Oxus River
to the crossroads of western

Asia. Soviet President Leonid
Brezhnev, in a congratulatory
message to the poet
schoolteacher named Nur
Mohammed Taraki who led the
coup, spoke glowingly of joint
development with full respect for
Afghanistan's national
sovereignty and the doctrine of
non-interference.
Meanwhile, the triumphant
Taraki met with his new Cabinet
of ideologues and erstwhile tank
commanders to map out reforms
that he promised would catapult
Afghanistan into the 20th cen
tury.
But the people of Afghanistan
rejected both Marxism and the
20th century. Meanwhile, the
revolutionary leaders were too
preoccupied with a series of
bloody vendettas to tailor their
policies to the realities of their
staunchly Islamic, underde
veloped nation.
Cultivating his own image as

the benevolent father figure,
Taraki delegated the hatchet
work of eliminating state
enemies to his right-hand man
and prime minister, Hafizullah
Amin.
It was a job Amin took on with
zeal. He jailed thousands and by
early last year it was estimated
that between 100 and 150 politi
cal prisoners a night were being
executed in the Kabul valley.
By last September, Amin de
cided that it was Taraki's own
turn to die. The leader of the re
volution was killed in a shootout
on the stairs of the presidential
palace. Amin patched up the bul
let holes and ruled for four
months, earning himself the title
of most hated man in recent Af
ghan history.
He died when the Soviets de
cided that Afghanistan's Marxist
experiment could survive only at
gunpoint — with the Soviets
holding the gun.
NEW DELHI, India — "All
powers of the state are now in the
hands of the people of Afghanis
tan." crackled the voice of Radio
Kabul two years ago.
The announcement signaled
the success of a bloody coup that
erased the last traces of Af
ghanistan's monarchy and
brought a shadowy band of Mar
xist fanatics and little-known
military officers to power.
They were arrogant and ruth
less, yet politically inept, and it
took barely 19 months to gener
ate a grass-roots, nationwide re
volt against their policies of re
form.
Far from giving power to the
people of Afghanistan, the Mar
xists delivered their fiercely in
dependent nation into the arms
of the Soviet Union, tearing its
social and economic fabric to
shreds in the process.
Today — in the wake of the
Soviet Union's year-end inva
sion, ostensibly at the invitation
of the government in Kabul —
Afghan government officials
take orders from the cadre of
Soviet civilian bureaucrats that
runs most of the nation's minis
tries.
Soviets. not Afghans, now dic
tate strategy in the war to wipe
out the stubborn anti
government insurgency waged
by the Moslem rebels, known as
Moujaheadeen.
Strict control
The Soviets are even reported
to strictly control access to Af
ghan President Babrak Karmal,
the man they installed last De
cember.
According to reports from Af
ghan government officers who
have lied the country in recent
weeks, the Soviets in govern
ment offices deport themselves
like representatives of a colonial
administration.
"If a deputy minister wants
something from a Russian in his

ministry, he can't summon the
Russian, he must get an ap
pointment and go to his office,"
one senior government officer
said.
Widespread purges of
thousands of "counter
revolutionaries" in the two years
since the coup have decimated
Afghanistan's small corps of
well-educated, capable bureauc
rats.
Escape
Many of those few remaining
competent Afghan civil servants
are plotting their escape from the
country.
Reports reaching here earlier
last week indicated that the gov
ernor of Herat province was ar
rested trying to flee across the
Iranian border after engaging in
a plot to kill a number of Soviets.
The urge to desert the regime
and its Soviet masters is just as
strong in the military, where
major elements of the once pro
fessional army of 80,000 have
disintegrated under the weightof
purges, desertions and casualties
sustained during their campaign
against insurgents.
