# Egypt speeds up process
## Normal relations set up 
### Edward Cody The Washington Post 
CAIRO — Despite stalemate
and rancor in the Palestinian au
tonomy talks, Egypt is moving
ahead with unexpected speed in
setting up the normal bilateral
relations with Israel outlined in
their 13-month-old peace treaty.
Far from the theater visits to
Washington by President Anwar
Sadat and Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Egyptian and
Israeli diplomats negotiating
smoothly and without fanfare in
Cairo and Tel Aviv this week
signed the last of eight accords
designed to transform the two
former enemies into good
neighbors.
This marked a three-month
advance over the timetable fore
seen in the March 26, 1978, tre
aty. The swift agreement under
lined Sadat's policy of separating
progress in the normalization
measures, where both sides want
basically the same thing, from
progress in the autonomy talks,
where each side wants something
vastly different.
The Egyptian leader's willing
ness to proceed on this basis,
often against the advice of his
own Foreign Ministry specialist,
has been crucial in allowing
negotiators to set up the
framework for normal relations
ahead of schedule. Barring swift
progress in the autonomy talks,
however, it also has left Sadat
exposed to charges that his Arab
critics were right in accusing him
of making a separate peace with
Israel.

The final accord, regulating
commerce and trade, was signed
over the weekend in Cairo just
before a reception in a hotel
overlooking the Nile to mark Is
raeli independence day. It had
been preceded by accords reg
ulating Egyptian oil sales to Is
rael, telephone and postal ser
vice between the two countries,
transports, tourism, agricultural
cooperation, cultural exchanges
ano civil aviation.

*"I have been involved in the
peace process almost from the
beginning, and I had never im
agined we would be this far by
now," said Yousef Haddas, an
Arabic-speaking Syrian Jew who
is the No. 2 man at the Israeli
Embassy here under Ambas
sador Eliahu Ben-Elissar.
The Israeli reception, Ben-
Elissar's first venture of such
scale on the Cairo circuit, also
was a milestone in its own way. It
was attended by a sprinkling of
Egyptian officials and. to the
surprise of many observers,
Minister of State for Foreign Af
fairs Butros Ghali.
Ghali, who has urged a closer
link between the autonomy talks
and bilateral progress, repor
tedly had been encouraging his
Foreign Ministry officials to
keep their distance from Ben-
Elissar and his embassy staff.
Ghali's appearance at the recep
tion thus was taken as a signal
that the ministry's unofficial so
cial boycott is softening.
The Foreign Ministry still can
control the spigot of normaliza
tion, however, because the eight
accords provided for in the treaty
form only an outline for normal
relations. The Egyptian
bureaucracy could prevent or
delay concrete steps if Sadat de
cided later to reduce the flow to
make a point in the autonomy
talks.
At the same time, many of the
concrete steps already taken
have been carried out. The first
private business deal resulting in
delivery of Israeli merchandise
directly to Egypt became a real
ity last week when 10,000 chicks
arrived at Cairo airport in the
hold of an El At plane — and got
such swift service by the clearing
agent that they left the airport
before the passengers who had
arrived aboard the same flight.
El A 1 officials report their
twice-weekly flights between

Cairo and Lod Airport near Tel
Aviv operate at about 90 percent
of capacity. Nefertiti, the Egyp
tian airline formed last month
specially for the Cairo-Lod run,
reports about 60 percent capac
ity on its flights, also twice a
week. Diplomats say both air
lines are considering adding a
third weekly flight for what is ex
pected to be steadily improving
business as tour agencies
schedule visits combining

Since last week, tourists also
can travel in private cars bet
ween Israel and Egypt. Travel by
bus or taxi has been possible
since late January through a gate
at El Arish, an Egyptian town
marking the northern end of the
withdrawal frontier until 1981.
The traveler who makes his
schedule fit the timetable for
crossing the Suez Canal can take
an Egyptian taxi to El Arish for
about $7.50 and then pick up an
Israeli taxi on the other side for a
$10 ride into Tel Aviv. A one
way plane trip costs $85.
Most travelers have been
foreigners. But Egyptian au
thorities have issued about 5000
visas to Israelis since visits began
last July, 2000 since the Israeli
Embassy opened here Feb 18.
Another 1000 visa requests are
pending, with positive responses
expected as soon as they wind
their way through the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry bureaucracy,
Israeli officials say.
In its two months of work the
Israeli Embassv has issued about
200 visas to Egyptians traveling
to Israel. They include few
tourists, but most Flgyptians
cannot afford to travel for plea
sure. A few were Egyptian Jews
visiting relatives. The majority
were businessmen seeking con
tacts with their Israeli counter
parts, and one was a blind man
who wanted an operation to re
store his sight at a hospital in
Jerusalem, embassy officials re
ported.
Telex and telephone com
munications, meanwhile, have
become routine between the two
countries. Telephone connec
tions pass through Rome ex
changes for the time being, but
Egyptians plan to hook onto Is
raeli lines left behind at a former
Israeli base at Bir Gafgaga in the
Sinai for direct links.

Since last week, tourists also
can travel in private cars bet
ween Israel and Egypt. Travel by
bus or taxi has been possible
since late January through a gate
at El Arish, an Egyptian town
marking the northern end of the
withdrawal frontier until 1981.
The traveler who makes his
schedule fit the timetable for
crossing the Suez Canal can take
an Egyptian taxi to El Arish for
about $7.50 and then pick up an
Israeli taxi on the other side for a
$10 ride into Tel Aviv. A one
way plane trip costs $85.
Most travelers have been
foreigners. But Egyptian au
thorities have issued about 5000
visas to Israelis since visits began
last July, 2000 since the Israeli
Embassy opened here Feb 18.
Another 1000 visa requests are
pending, with positive responses
expected as soon as they wind
their way through the Egyptian
Foreign Ministry bureaucracy,
Israeli officials say.
In its two months of work the
Israeli Embassv has issued about
200 visas to Egyptians traveling
to Israel. They include few
tourists, but most Flgyptians
cannot afford to travel for plea
sure. A few were Egyptian Jews
visiting relatives. The majority
were businessmen seeking con
tacts with their Israeli counter
parts, and one was a blind man
who wanted an operation to re
store his sight at a hospital in
Jerusalem, embassy officials re

Telex and telephone com
munications, meanwhile, have
become routine between the two
countries. Telephone connec

CAIRO — Despite stalemate
and rancor in the Palestinian au
tonomy talks, Egypt is moving
ahead with unexpected speed in
setting up the normal bilateral
relations with Israel outlined in
their 13-month-old peace treaty.
Far from the theater visits to
Washington by President Anwar
Sadat and Prime Minister
Menachem Begin, Egyptian and
Israeli diplomats negotiating
smoothly and without fanfare in
Cairo and Tel Aviv this week
signed the last of eight accords
designed to transform the two
former enemies into good
neighbors.
This marked a three-month
advance over the timetable fore
seen in the March 26, 1978, tre
aty. The swift agreement under
lined Sadat's policy of separating
progress in the normalization
measures, where both sides want
basically the same thing, from
progress in the autonomy talks,
where each side wants something
vastly different.
The Egyptian leader's willing
ness to proceed on this basis,
often against the advice of his
own Foreign Ministry specialist,
has been crucial in allowing
negotiators to set up the
framework for normal relations
ahead of schedule. Barring swift
progress in the autonomy talks,
however, it also has left Sadat
exposed to charges that his Arab
critics were right in accusing him
of making a separate peace with
Israel.

The final accord, regulating
commerce and trade, was signed
over the weekend in Cairo just
before a reception in a hotel
overlooking the Nile to mark Is
raeli independence day. It had
been preceded by accords reg
ulating Egyptian oil sales to Is
rael, telephone and postal ser
vice between the two countries,
transports, tourism, agricultural
cooperation, cultural exchanges
ano civil aviation.

*"I have been involved in the
peace process almost from the
beginning, and I had never im
agined we would be this far by
now," said Yousef Haddas, an
Arabic-speaking Syrian Jew who
is the No. 2 man at the Israeli
Embassy here under Ambas
sador Eliahu Ben-Elissar.
The Israeli reception, Ben-
Elissar's first venture of such
scale on the Cairo circuit, also
was a milestone in its own way. It
was attended by a sprinkling of
Egyptian officials and. to the
surprise of many observers,
Minister of State for Foreign Af
fairs Butros Ghali.
Ghali, who has urged a closer
link between the autonomy talks
and bilateral progress, repor
tedly had been encouraging his
Foreign Ministry officials to
keep their distance from Ben-
Elissar and his embassy staff.
