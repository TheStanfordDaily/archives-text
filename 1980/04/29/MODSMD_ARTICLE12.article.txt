# Bhutan tunes out rest of world to save identity

THIMPHU, Bhutan â€” The day this
tiny Himalayan kingdom inaugurated its
first radio station, the producers scrapped
the scheduled international news sum
mary. Bhutan was not ready, they de
cided.
"The news was too depressing, so we
ripped it up and played a little more
music," Chief Justice Balorji Dorji, who
was in the studio on that occasion a few
years ago, recalled in a recent interview.
Bhutan is like that. It has tuned out the
rest of the world for most of its seven
centuries as a nation. Consequently, most
of the 1.5 million or so Bhutanese farm
the steep mountain slopes in the same way
their ancestors did hundreds of years ago.
Although the country's 24-year-oltt
monarch. King Jigme Singhe Wangchuk,
has committed his realm to a program of
modernization, his plans seem to set well
with his subjects.
"We'll modernize, but at a pace the

Bhutanese people can keep up with," he
said in a recent interview. "Grossnational
happiness is just as important to us as
gross national product."
So far. the king has practiced what he
preaches.
With his country sandwiched between
two ancient rivals, India and China, the
king sees little point in spending money to
strengthen his armed forces. Unless the
4000-man army can help on development
projects, there is little justification for its
existence, he said.
The Bhutanese air force consists of an
old Soviet helicopter, a gift of the Indian
government. No longer airworthy, it is
rusting away.
Severing of Bhutan's traditional trade
and cultural links with Tibet in 1958,
when the Chinese marched into Tibet,
placed Bhutan even more than before at
the mercy of India, which strictly controls
the only access into the landlocked king
dom. In return for political allegiance.
India has underwritten most of Bhutan's

efforts to modernize.
Electricity and motorized vehicles first
reached the kingdom in the early 19605.
In the years since, Bhutan has worked its
way through three five-year development
plans and will wind up its fourth this year
with some modest signs of progress. The
number of Bhutanese finishing the 10th
grade of school has risen from 45 to 180.
Although yaks, ponies and mules are
still the chief means of transportation for
most Bhutanese, about 900 miles of roads
now link key areas. Medical care has im
proved with the construction of new hos
pitals, and the capital's 19-page tele
phone directory attests to the growth of
communications.
Bhutan's long-range goal is achieving
economic self-sufficiency through the de
velopment of its natural resources, mainly
wood, and harnessing water for hyd
roelectric power. The granting of Bhu
tan's first tourist visa in October 1974
sparked an industry that has become the
country's largest source of foreign ex

.change.
But the pace of development remains
slow, to ensure preservation of traditional
values. "We're trying to learn from the
mistakes of others," the king said.
The king has also decided against mass
tourism like that in neighboring Nepal.
Bhutan, he said, can handle no more than
1000 visitors a year.
Partly to hring development closer to
the people, !ind partly to head off the
growth of a central bureaucratic elite, the
king has decided that future development
will be decentralized and administered by
locally elected governments.
Parallel to its internal modernization,
Bhutan has in the last decade taken its
place in the community of nations. It
joined the United Nations in 1971 and
two years later became a member of the
non-aligned group. In an effort to loosen
India's grip on its affairs, Bhutan has
managed to increase sharply the aid it gets
from U.N. agencies, which it believes to
have fewer political strings.
