# Beijing editor visiting here
## China's journalism gains freedom 
### Todd Pickett Staff Writer 
The most fundamental change
in Chinese society in the last de
cade has been an "emancipation
of the mind," according to visit
ing Chinese journalist Guan Zai
Han.
Speaking last Tuesday before
125 faculty and students in
Bechtel International Center,
Guan extolled the new-born
freedom of expression he says
now exists in the People's Re
public.
The newspapers no longer
must submit to government con
trol "and not talk about what has
not been mentioned," Guan
said.
A writer and editor for the first
national English-language daily
in China, The Beijing Times,
Guan is studying journalism here
at the invitation of the Stanford
Committee on U.S.-China Rela
tions.
China's journalistic freedoms
began surfacing as recently as
1978, ushered in by the people's
demands for more human rights
and greater democracy — cries
that are still echoing inside the
country's borders. Not until the
downfall of the Gang of Four in

-1976, a leftist faction which tem
porarily rose to power, did the
human rights movements begin
to make effective changes.
283 papers
Today, accocding to Guan,
China boasts the existence of
283 daily newspapers with a
nationwide circulation of over 62
million — only one million short
of the U.S. newspapers' circula
tion. In comparison, during the
Cultural Revolution under Mao
Zedong, only three
government-owned publications
were produced.
In addition to the daily news
papers now in circulation, more
than 1200 magazines and jour
nals are published on topics rang
ing from science and technology
to literature and art, said Guan.
Among the specific freedoms
granted Chinese journalists are
the rights to investigate and
editorialize. For the first time,
according to Guan, "real" inves
tigative reporting is being prac
ticed by many Chinese newspap
ers.
In addition, articles criticizing
China's state of affairs appear
regularly in many national news
papers, though "it is not the
practice of Chinese newspapers

to name names," added Guan.
Letters
Many of the investigations and
editorials are prompted by let
ters to the editor from a popula
tion that is taking advantage of
its new voice. China's largest na
tional newspaper, The People's
Daily, receives more than 2000
opinions each day in the form of
letters to the editor.
Speaking about the character
posters that individuals often
post in China criticizing political
leaders and issues there, Guan
said the government ruled the
posters an unjust expression be
cause those criticized did not
have an effective means to de
fend themselves.
Although Chinese journalism
has changed markedly from what
it was a decade ago, it is still far
from producing the daily publi
cations Americans are familiar
with. The People's Daily, for in
stance, is only eight pages long
(four pages on Sunday), sells for
five cents. Only one-half page is
devoted to advertisements, and
merchants are on a six-month
waiting list for space.
More departments
Recently, pages including arti
cles on fashion, cooking, furni

ture making and sports have
been added to the straight news
stories.
Even China's journalistic style,
added Guan, is unique in com
parison with the rest of the
world's public press. In contrast
with conventional news writing
which places a synopsis of the
most important facts in the lead
paragraph fo the story, Chinese
news articles are written
chronologically, much like a
short story.
Tlius, in the case of an impor
tant meeting of high-ranking
government officials, the issues
discussed and resolved might not
be mentioned until mid-way
through the article.
However, Guan noted that
some Chinese journalists have
adopted lead writing, and that
that style is expected to eventu
ally replace the chronological
format.
No yellow journalisfti
Sensationalism, the practice of
drawing attention to certain
stories through oversized head
lines and prominent placement
on the page does not appear in
Chinese newpapers and is consis
tently avoided in most other
Communist countries, Evan
said. Unlike the American press,
scandals in the personal lives of
China's leaders are neither in
vestigated nor reported.
Guan said he is optimistic
about the future of journalism in
China and looks for continued
modernization of the country's
public press.
Guan began his career as a
journalist in the mid-1940 s but
his career, like most journalists',
was interrupted by the turmoil of
the Cultural Revolution. Through
the '50s and '60s, Guan worked
with the Department of Informa
tion in the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, eventually returning to
his career as a journalist after the
downfall of the Gang of Four. At
the conclusion of Guan's two
month stay at Stanford, he will
return to Beijing as editor of The
Beijing Times.
