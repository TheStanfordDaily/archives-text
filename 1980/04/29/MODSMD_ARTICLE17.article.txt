## David Sartoris Rescue try objectionable 
### 
President Jimmy Carter is to be harshly criticized
for the recent unsuccessful attempt at a military
rescue of the American hostages in Iran. The pres
idential oath of office was clearly violated by the
apparent failure to consult Congress, the American
people, or even the hostage families prior to initia
tion of an act which would jeopardize the lives of
American citizens. Eight American servicemen
now lie dead, and the future safety of the hostages
has become an even greater uncertainty.
The militants holding these individuals in
Tehran since the U.S. embassy was seized on
November 14 have threatened repeatedly to kill
them in the event of an attempted military rescue.
Should this action now occur, a military confronta
tion between the United States and Iran would be a
strong possibility. Thus, Carter's hasty maneuver
will have resulted in the death of many more citi
zens of both nations.
The likelihood of war must be considered great
in view of the current public mentalities within the
two involved countries. Political tension and social
unrest have plagued Iran for some time, and the
economic experience of the 1930's demonstrates
that our impending hard times will probably be
sufficient to overcome even the bitter memories of
Viet Nam.
Perhaps more objectionable than the fact that an
unapproved military rescue of the hostages was
attempted is the reason why it was attempted.
American voters should be all too familiar with the
scenario of political events during an incumbent
election year; announcements and actions hinge
around the concept of appeasement of the electing
population.
Carter has been under increasingly heavy politi
cal pressure to try to secure release of the captive
Americans. Soon after the embassy takeover.
Chief of Staff Hamilton Jordan announced that the
possibility of a rescue mission had been studied and

found not to be feasible. In spite of this. Carter was
apparently tempted by the opportunity to quickly
and decisively end the Iranian crisis and restore his
own public popularity.
Instead, he has indirectly killed eight Americans,
risked the tragedy and hardship of war in a nation
dangerously close to areas of Soviet aggression,
and. if we are a sensible voting public, given up the
Democratic nomination and perhaps the presi
dency.
The official White House report of the incident
stated that the rescue attempt was aborted because
of "equipment failure." The eight American
crewmen reportedly died as a result of a collision
between two U.S. aircraft on the ground in an
Iranian desert. However, one Iranian spokesman
stated that the American rescue squadron was suc
cessfully intercepted and attacked by Iranian
forces. While the latter report must be interpreted
with some skepticism, it seems equally unlikely
that a mission of such crucial importance should
fail for such vague and unorganized reasons.
Whatever happened during the attempted hos
tage rescue and how much of a tragic political
mistake it was, much remains to be salvaged from
the situation as it presently stands. If the captive
Americans are injured or killed by the Iranian
terrorists, our nation will do wise to "bite the bul
let" and refrain from retaliatory military action of
any kind. As the more sane and rational of the two
involved factions, it is our duty for the preservation
of world peace to prevent the deaths of 50 from
becoming the deaths of thousands.
Nationalist pride must be put aside in the hope
of greater international understanding in the fu
ture. and the Iranian crisis considered a learning
experience applicable to future American in
volvement abroad.
