## Reform corporate tax laws 
### 
Corporations don't pay taxes
— people do. To determine
which persons the corporate tax
really hits, several questions
have to be considered.
Is the corporation in a strong
enough market position to pass
on the tax to its customers? If so,
the corporate income tax hits the
individual something like a sales
tax, and if the tax is on a business
that produces necessities, its im
pact may be regressive.
If the corporation cannot pass
on the tax, then it must be ab
sorbed by the stockholders in the
form of lower profits and di
vidends. Still, it is people who
bear the tax. It should also be
noted that some 35 million tax
payers directly own, and an addi
tional 85 million indirectly own,
stock in corporations.
The question of whom the
corporate tax hits is difficult to
answer — except that it does not,
as some would have us believe,
fall only on "big business." In
one way or another, taxes are al
ways paid by the people.
Any tax'system may be judged
on its fairness, its impact on the
efficient use of economic re
sources, and on its "deadweight
loss." To pass business-like
judgment on the business in
come tax structure: its fairness is
questionable; its neutrality with
regard to the allocation of capital
is disavowed; and the costs to
society of collection and com
pliance have been conservatively
estimated bv the American Bar

Association to amount to almost
four percent of the revenue col
lected by the Internal Revenue
Service (IRS).
Economist Robert Eisner has,
in my opinion, argued very per
suasively for the elimination of
the business income tax and the
integration of business income
into the individual income tax
structure. Under this system, the
government would allocate cor
porate income directly to stoc
kholders and require them to pay
individual income taxes on all
earnings, whether distributed in
the form of dividends or not.
Briefly, let me summarize some
of his points.
For years, investors have pro
tested the "double-taxation" of
that portion of corporate income
paid out in dividends. Combin
ing the business and individual
income taxes would remove this
inequity and, more importantly,
eliminate an even greater injus
tice owing to the essentially flat
marginal corporate tax rate of 48
percent. For, far from being
progresive with respect to stoc
kholder incomes, the corporate
tax takes the same 48 percent
bite out of a poor widow's return
on equity as it does out of a mil
lionaire's.
Furthermore, the integration
of tax structures would end a
plainly unintended incentive for
three-martini lunches and Miami
conventions since a 48 percent
tax on company earnings is, in a
sense, also a 48 percent govern

ment subsidy of all tax
deductible business expenses.
The expected tightening of con
trols over entertainment and
travel expenses would promote
greater efficiency and. hence, the
growth in productivity which is
so essential in our battle against
inflation. Moreover, the repeal
of the business income tax would
increase company cash flow by
the amount of the tax and there
upon spur the productive in
vestment in structures, machin
ery and equipment. Corporate
tax reform would have a healthy
effect on the American
economy, indeed.
There are some obstacles, of
course, to bringing about such a
change. For one thing, if indi
vidual tax rates were to remain
unchanged, the government
would forgo whatever extra re
venue it would have collected by
taxing dividends twice and gain
only whatever additional indi
vidual income taxes would be
generated, beyond those owing
to the allocation of corporate
earnings directly to sharehol
ders, from having most stoc
kholders enter higher tax brac
kets. Yet, this net loss might be
recovered by ending the special
treatment of capital gains. After
all, why should money made by
money be taxed any less than
money made by man?
Another problem would arise
because some 23 percent of cor
porate earnings would be alloted
to the tax-exempt sector. To
prevent these recipients from
getting a bonus at government
expense, a 48 percent tax could
be applied to their share of cor
porate profits without affecting
their finances at all.
Clearly, these minor obstacles
pale in comparison with the on
going advantages of eliminating
Subchapter C of the Internal Re
venue Code. The IRS would no
longer audit business income tax
returns and could concentrate on
compliance by individual tax
payers. Moreover, the major re
duction in tax planning and liti
gation would free management
and professionals to engage in
more productive affairs.
