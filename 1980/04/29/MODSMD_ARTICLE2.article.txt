# Living arrangements to change next year at Wilbur Hall dorms
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
Wilbur Hall won't be quite the same
next year.
Under an experimental housing
program, living arrangements will
change in several dorms.
Otero, now a four-class residence,
and all-frcshmen Rinconada, will
house only freshmen under the plan to
combine the adjacent living quarters.
Also under the program, freshman
dorm Arroyo will become an all-class
residence.
'Sandwich' structure
The plan calls for a change in the
traditional "sandwich" housing struc
ture — which houses the sexes by
floors. Program planners hope to have
the usual two floors of males and one
floor of females in one dorm, and re
verse the arrangement with two floors
of females and one of males in the
other.
"With the joint-dorm programs we
will have a larger population and one
that is more balanced in terms of sex,"
said Alice Supton, assistant dean of re
sidential education.
The plan to combine two dorms for
certain activities resulted largely from
dissatisfaction with the imbalanced

situation in sandwich dorms.
"The reason behind this new ar
rangement is that students and resident
staff seem to feel that the living envi
ronment in sandwich dorms is less at
tractive," Supton said. "There tends to
be more sex-role stereotyping, and
more difficulty in having easy, natural
social interaction."
Co-ed by room
Most students here seem to prefer
housing that is co-ed by alternating
rooms. Supton said, however, that the
cost to install the necessary co-ed
bathroom facilities on each floor is too
high.
Otero Resident Fellow Bill Weber
estimated that it would cost $50,000
per floor to make the necessary
changes.
Wilbur showers are the large, com
munal sort, which makes conversion to
co-ed bathrooms difficult.
So Residential Education is trying
another solution — attempting to
create a larger, balanced social envi
ronment with the joint-dorm concept.
'Individual flavor*
Weber and his wife Sheila said that in
addition to the large group activities,
they will still be working to maintain
the "individual flavor of the two dorms."

"We have a dual aim," Weber said.
"Not only do we want to make sure that
each dorm has special unity and per
sonality of its own, we also want to
integrate with Rinconada on a large
scale in such areas as social program
ming, plays and lectures."
Weber said he believes the resident
staffs and fellows will work together
closely next year. Asst. History Prof.
Stephen Ferruolo and his wife Karen
will be Rinconada resident fellows next
year.
