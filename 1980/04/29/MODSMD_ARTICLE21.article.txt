# Discuss libertarianism sans myths
## 
### 
Libertarianism is the fastest-growing
creed in America today. Before judging and
evaluating libertarianism, it is vitally impor
tant to find out precisely what it is, and, more
precisely, what it is not. I would like to clear
away two of the most common myths about
libertarianism so people can discuss it free of
misconceptions, and deal with it as it should
be — on its very own merits or demerits.
Myth No. 1: Libertarians are heartless,
with no concern for the less fortunate mem
bers of society. They would reduce all rela
tionships to economic ones, leaving the free
market to trample on the poor.
It is easy to see how this myth arises. Be
cause libertarians oppose government prog
rams whose stated purpose is to help the
poor, they seem to be against the help itself.
The libertarian, however, has dared to ask
the question of whether government prog
rams do what they are supposed to do, or
whether they merely assuage the guilt of
those who think of themselves as caring
about the poor, but are unwilling to give of
themselves.
Ask yourself, what is real help to these
people? Is it money? Is it preferential treat
ment in hiring? Is it government make-work
jobs, such as CETA? The answer may be
gotten from the poor themselves. Do they
consider the government welfare workers
their saviors? Visit the government welfare
office if you have any doubt.
Forced charity is a contradiction in terms.
And the worst part is the both sides are hurt:
the self-help opportunities of the poor are
destroyed and the opportunities for joy and
spiritual advancement of the givers of help
are eliminated. In situations where help is
freely given it is sometimes hard to tell who is
helping and who is being helped. It can be a
mistake to think of the "needy" versus the
"non-needy." Everyone has many complex
needs and something to give.

Freedom means much more than the free
market. It means the advancement of all
people, as they create their own oppor
tunities, as they look to each other rather
than the government for support and en
couragement, and as they help each other in
countless ways that government can't. Only
people can care, government can never care.
When the poor people get a welfare check,
they also get the message, loud and clear,
that they can't hack it and will never have

anything unless someone gives it to them. If
you wanted to design a system that destroyed
their self-esteem, you couldn't do better than
the one we have.
Libertarians want to end this inhuman
cycle of grinding poverty by eliminating its
causes — the restrictions on employment,
business and entrepreneurship that keep
poor people from working, starting busines
ses and climbing the economic ladder. If this
is done, the need for welfare and other "so
cial programs" will disappear.
Myth No. 2: Libertarians do not under
stand the numerous imperfections that occur
in free markets, such as externalities, price
fixing, monopolies, etc.
To the libertarian these are really legal, not
economic problems.
Externalities, such as pollution, result

from the failure to define use and property
rights. The remedy is a well-defined and en
forced system of rights for individuals to be
free from physical interferences caused by
others. To the libertarian, pollution is ag
gression and should be enjoined except
where agreed upon by contract.
The problems of monopoly and price
fixing are a direct result of the attempt by
government to enforce a particular model of
economic competition. When the real world
is held up to the mathematical ideal of "per
fect competition," imperfections are inevita
ble. It is ironic that in the attempt to make the
market more "perfect," competition has
been stifled and monopoly has been fostered.
To the libertarian, competition is a process
in which there is free entry into the market,
not an equilibrium condition in which all
producers are small, relative to the total mar
ket. Government intervention in the
economy to keep it competitive is another
contradiction in terms.
Anyone who doubts that regulation and
anti-trust laws have been used to reduce
competiton, discourage innovation and raise
prices to consumers should read socialist his
torian Gabriel Kolko's The Triumph of Con
servatism, or The Myths of Anti-Trust by
Dom Armentano. It was the leaders of big
business, not the political reformers, who
were the chief initiators of the Progressive
era's "reforms." Their support for govern
ment intervention continues today.
These two myths are the ones most likely
to be held by liberals and the ones which
mainly prevent libertarianism from making
even more rapid progress than it is. In my
next column I will discuss myths likely to be
held by conservatives.
