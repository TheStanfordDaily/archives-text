## Israeli settlements block peace 
### 
Next to the question of Jerusalem, the es
tablishment of Jewish settlements in the ter
ritories occupied by Israel is the most crucial
issue in current Eygptian-Israeli autonomy
negotiations.
After the 1967 war,successive Israeli gov
ernments built civilian settlements in areas
captured from Jordan, Syria and Egypt, jus
tifying them as a defensive measure agaisnt
possible future invasions. In the part of
Jerusalem that came under Israeli control,
Arab inhabitants were displaced and Jewish
communities established for the purpose of
maintaining the city as a permanent part of
Israel. By 1977, when Prime Minister
Menachem Begin took office, there were 32
Israeli settlements on the West Bank, 22 in
Gaza, and 26 in the Golan area.
The Begin government claimed that the
West Bank was an integral part of historic
Israel and almost immediately began build
ing new settlements despite objections by the
United Nations that such settlements viol
ated Article 49 of the Geneva Convention,
which bars an occupying power from settling
occupied territory for other than security
reasons. Since 1977 the Israelis have built 47
new settlements and at least SO more are
planned. The government has clearly stated
its intention of using these settlements to
establish the permanent presence of Jews on
the West Bank.
At present there are fewer than 10,000
settlers in the occupied areas, but many of
them are members of the Gush Emunim
(Movement for a Greater Israel), a militant
group that claims the West Bank for Israel.
Where the settlements are in close proximity
to Arab populations there have been out
bursts of violence. Arab children have stoned
Israeli soldiers, a settler and two Arab stu
dents have been killed, and Arab schools
have been vandalized.
Arabs on the West Bank charge that set
tlements are built on land they have used for
generations for farming or grazing, and that
scarce irrigation water has been diverted to
Jewish settlers. (The French newspaper, Le
Monde, estimates that Israel uses more than
300 billion gallons of West Bank water a
year.) As long as the Palestinians see their

land chipped away for Jewish settlements
and connecting road networks, there is no
hope they will consent to take part in the
autonomy discussions called for by the Camp
David agreements. Their spokesmen point
out that autonomy would have little meaning
as long as Jews could settle freely in the area,
under their own local authorities, while
Palestinian immigration continued to be con
trolled by Israel.
Leaders of the Arab nations see Israel's
settlement policy as an expansionist device,
designed to keep areas captured in the 1967
war a permanent part of Israel. As such, they
claim, the policy violated United Nations
Resolution 242, which calls for a return of
territories taken by Israel in exchange for
peace.
Israeli citizens are showing increasing op
position to the settlement policy, most nota
bly the Peace Now movement, a non
political group that maintains that a secure
peace is more important than additional ter
ritory. Peace Now protests against new set
tlements have attracted tens of thousands of
participants. Members of the group have also
established contacts with Palestinians on the
West Bank, and in a gesture of goodwill have
replanted vineyards that were destroyed by
Jewish settlers.
Other Israelis, who suffer from Israel's se
vere economic difficulties — including a 110
percent inflation rate — complain that the
costs of new settlements take badly needed
funds from housing and other social needs

within Israel. Such opposition is bound to
become stronger if the Israeli government
implements its present plans to spend more
then $3 billion over the next five years on
new settlements and roads on the West
Bank.
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat has
strongly urged a freeze on new settlements as
a means of moving the autonomy negotia
tions forward, but so far the Israeli govern
ment has refused to comply. Begin has lost
popularity and polls show that he would lose
an election if one were held today. Con
sequently, he needs the support of religious
groups and militants more than ever — and
such support depends largely on his willing
ness to establish more settlements. So, ironi
cally, the government's weakness at home
contributes to its inflexibility abroad.
The people of Israel are still haunted by
memories of the Holocaust, when the entire
world abandoned them, and security is their
uppermost concern. At the same time, Is
rael's intransigence causes increasing hostil
ity around the world, which in turn intensifies
Israeli feelings of isolation.
According to Israeli journalist Lesley
Hazelton, the vicious circle may end only
when Israel faces up to "the question of
where its security lies — in settlements that
make a peace agreement impossible or in a
peace agreement that makes settlements im
possible."
