# peppy 'Pippin'
## 
### 
Pippin is a very empty
show, but Ram's Head has fil
led it up as much as it could
with beautiful designing and
choreography and several
outstanding performances,
especially Michael Myers' as
the Leading Player.
The Stephen Schwartz-
Roger Hirson musical is an
amusing, bland pop-rock
"morality play," a string of
songs and episodes in the
quest of Charlemagne's son
for ultimate fulfillment.
Naive Pippin (Marty Mo
ran ) believes himself to be ex
traordinary, which means no
thing in life is good enough
for him. "There must be
something more," he keeps
saying, as he wades through
war, religion, sex and revolu
tion.
Well, perhaps there is, but
we get tired of the quest and
of our brash, narrow-minded
hero. The show is empty be
cause it has no heart, no
characters which attract us,
no dynamic plot and only a
few good numbers.
But, and it is a big but,
Ram's Head and director Jodi
Corwin dress up this skeleton
beautifully. The sets, de
signed by Albert Mitchell,
often are breathtaking in
their simplicity and original
ity. We see scaffolds and plat
forms, and glistening spider
web strands of silver
stretched against scrims. The
lighting design also deserves
praise, especially for Peter
Maradudin's coordination of
colors with Mitchell's sets.
Suzanne Loube has pro
duced the best costumes for a
Ram's Head show since Fid
dler on the Roof in 1977. She
i handles the rather impossible
task of creating a Holy
Roman Empire's worth of
soldiers, peasants, seductres
| ses and monks, yet always in
i tegrates the costumes with a
\ pastel color scheme and a
' lively floral pattern.
[ The choreography also is
r very modern -r- which is just
. fine. Eric Hoit's dancers, de
j spite a few opening-night

bobbles, are smooth, espe
cially Michelle Dufrechou.
The acting, in general, is
strong, with two excellent
leads. Moran plays Pippin
with a soft, wide-eyed naiv
ete, maybe a little too soft. He
sings beautifully, though, and
carries a difficult role.
The real star, to me, is
Michael Myers, who is magic
itself as the Leading Player,
the macabre master of cere
monies. He sings with a deep,
rich, seductive voice, dances
like a panther and dominates
the stage with his properly
demonic leer and ele ( gant
sweeps of the hand.
Dawn Atkinson wins the
audience with her feisty
sing-along number as Pip
pin's not-ready-for-the-rest
home grandmother. Robert
Coleman sneers his way into
an imposing performance as
Charlemagne.
The others in the support
ing cast were hurt by
opening-night microphone
problems. They did not pro
ject well, and some of their
lines and songs were lost. Lilli
Ann Linford plays a villain
ous Fastrada, nonetheless,
not needing a mike to flash
her legs and Cheshire cat
smile.
Susan Faye as the woman
whom Pippin loves makes
much of a weak role.
Special mention should go
to the players, a troupe which
never let up. Director Jodi
Corwi n works them as hard as
Bob Fosse did the original
cast on Broadway. They are
always doing somersaults,
running up ladders, singing,
dancing.
And finally, the orchestra,
under musical director Claire
Kelm and conductors Kelm
and Dan Powers, has to be
pointed out for rich, smooth
sounds — the best Ram's Head
pit I've ever heard.
There are problems with
the play itself, but this pro
duction of Pippin makes up
for them. Ram's Head does
have "Magic to Do" and it
does it quite well. 1
