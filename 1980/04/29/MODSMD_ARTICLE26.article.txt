# Multi-colored masks, masques

Beginning in July, an exhibi
tion of 80 works by 10 Russian
dissident artists will be displayed
at the Faculty Club, Bechtel In
ternational Center and Tresid
der Union. It will be organized
by Shelly Komarov of the
Eduard Nakhamkin Gallery,
which is currently exhibiting the
works of one of the artists,
Mikhail Chemiakin, at the San
Jose Museum of Art.
Chemiakin emigrated to Paris
in 1971 because his style of
painting did not conform to the
Soviet definition of art, which
basically is social realism.
His exhibitions in Russia of
primitive art — scenes of St.
Petersburg, portraits of people in
18th-century dress, and heads
influenced by tribal masks —
were closed within a few days
after they opened.
In the last 10 years he has
exhibited in Paris, Zurich, To

kyo, Vienna, Antwerp, Rio de
Janeiro, New York and Los
Angeles.
The body of work exhibited in
San Jose — 55 drawings, lithog
raphs and "mixed media"
(watercolor, gouache, pen and
ink) — all has been done in the
last five years, and ranges in style
from amorphous, multi-colored
images reminiscent of the
psychodelic poster art of the
'60s, to colorful Klee- and
Bosch-like figures in carnival
dress, to wonderfully drawn, sur
realistic figures from the Paris
meat market.
His use of color — bold blues,
greens, reds, purples, yellows,
oranges and blacks, all in the
same picture—doesn't appeal to
me. Neither do his curvilinear fi
gures, which contain allusions to
profiles of people and beasts,
and which he labels "metaphysi
cal svnthesis" but never defines.

However, Chemiakin is a fine
technician and has a remarkable
command of line and, even, of
color. One of his Paris meat
market scenes has a splendid
combination of blues, purples,
golds and browns; and some of
his carnival scenes are very pleas
ing, as are his large Klee-like
heads, when they are done in
muted colors.
Although more interesting, his
art has an appeal similar to that
of Boulanger — it's slick and un
original, but well-executed.
Chemiakin is still young
enough — 37 — to develop in
other directions, and he is a fine
enough artist that someday he
may be deserving of the
worldwide praise which,
Komarov said, he is receiving.
(The Mikhail Chemiakin
exhibition will be at the San Jose
Museum of Art through May 5.)
