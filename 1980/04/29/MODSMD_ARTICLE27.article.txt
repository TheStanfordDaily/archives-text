# Esslin, Eddelman, 'Poor Murdered'
## 
### 
Drama professors Martin Esslin and Wil
liam Eddelman will discuss the politics and
scenography of the Drama Department's
spring production, Pavel Kohout's Poor
Murderer, 2:30 p.m. Sunday in the Little
Theater.
Esslin, who has known Kohout since 1968,
will speak on the playwright's relationship to
contemporary Czechoslovakian dissident
drama.
According to the Drama Department,
Kohout had been a staunch communist who
became a spokesman of liberal ideas during
the 1968 revolution. When Soviet suppres
sion in Czechoslovakia increased, Kohout

joined the dissident group, Charter 77. Last
year, returning from a trip to Vienna, he was
forced into exile.
Eddelman will discuss contemporary
scenography in Eastern Europe, notably in
Poland, the Soviet Union and Czechos
lovakia. He is interested in experimental
forms of scenic design and spent part of a
1977 sabbatical researching innovations in
the Eastern Bloc theater. Eddelman said he
plans to incorporate visual and aesthetic
ideas he encountered in Europe, with the
requirements of Kohout's play: a twisting,
turning look at life in a turn-of-the-century
Russian insane asylum.

Poor Murderer runs at 8 p.m. May 14-17,
2 1 -24 in the Little Theater. It uses a standard
'70s dramatic device: the play staged by in
mates, to a new advantage—the lines between
sanity and craziness, government and
tyranny blend into irony, humor and political
satire. Kohout offers a "literary pastiche"
which ranges from Hamlet to the fringes of
contemporary theater.
The play is directed by doctoral student
David McCandless and stars Fritz Brun, Jim
Carmody and Miriam Yahil-Wax. Eddelman
is designing the sets and costumes. Lighting is
being designed by John Rathman.
