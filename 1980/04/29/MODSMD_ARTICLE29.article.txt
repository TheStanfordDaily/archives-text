# 'Caligula'. —at long last, love?
## No climax for ancient Rome in 'Caligula' 
### 
In an incredibly masturbatory
interview in this month's Penth
ouse, masturbatory because
Guccione, besides being pro
ducer of the movie Caligula, is
the publisher and editor of
Penthouse, states that he has
"done with cinematic images
what so many authors and histo
rians have done with words — we
have recreated a complex life
style that flourished before
Christ and the Judeo-Christian
philosophy came into being."
Caligula is based on the life of
Rome's mad fourth emperor
Gaius Caligula Caesar, but un
fortunately investigative ancient
history does not turn a hefty pro
fit at the box office — certainly
few classicists could afford to
bankroll Caligula's $1 7.5 million
budget (imagine Professor
Raubitschek in an ascoted safari
suit). What does sell? Stylized
sex. as Guccione has de
monstrated with his wonderful
publishing empire. So, combine
big-name respectable stars, big
time historical spectacle, and
hard-core sex. And turn a heftv

Aside from whatever one's
views on pornography — and
Guccione's opinions to the con
trary. Caligula is a pornographic
movie — the film is far more of
fensive for its crass calculation.
Much as Penthouse sells sex
under the guise of an informa
tive. literary publication, so does
Caligula peddle its \arious wri
tings under a threadbare cloak
of historical accuracy and
cinematic pretension. In fact,
watching Caligula is a lot like
reading a copy of Penthouse: one
must wade through alternatively
strained attempts at character
development and plot, or poorly
written articles about Mafia
kingpins and sexual dysfunction,
in order to get to the naked ladies
and the odd camera angles that
allow the naked ladies to sling
their genitalia at the lenses.
Caligula even has the obligatory
lesbian scene — that's what men
like — featuring two former
Penthouse Pets who Penthouse is
touting as up-and-coming stars.
But in a daring commercial

move, the men and women be
hind Caligula have gone so far as
to add a new element to the tried
and true Penthouse formula:
explicit scatology and violence
worthy of a quicky Italian exploi
tation movie. The audience is
treated to numerous beheadings,
a detached penis thatjs fed to
hungry palace dogs, a woman
who urinates on corpses, and a
disembowelment.
Yet for all its sensationalism,
this is essentially a boring movie
in the long tradition of crummy
B-movies. The plot, based on a
Gore Vidal screenplay he
sued to have his name taken oft
of. consists of Caligula becoming
emperor, doing some bad things,
and then being executed by the
suitably fed-up Roman estab
lishment in a gory finale that is
consistent with the rest of the
film. Along the way the audience
is forced to endure some of the
worst acting since the heyday of
the Airport movies: Malcolm
McDowell as Caligula, and Peter
O'Toole. as Caligula's predeces
sor Tiberius, ham it up consider

ably, alternately screaming,
sneering, or whispering hoarsely
according to the degree of mad
ness that the script demands for a
particular scene. The rest of the
male cast speaks in deep stento
rian voices —"You called for me
Caesar," and "Guards, take him
away" — in order to indicate
patience and nobility. There are
no male characters who are
neither mad nor noble. And ex
cept for Helen Mirren who man
ages a few good licks as Caligu
la's wife Caesonia, the female
cast is composed mainly of "de
lectable" Penthouse Pets who
have little to do but run around
naked under their togas and
perform an occasional copula
tion. Even the production values
of this big-budget idiocy are sur
prisingly poor: O'Toole's age

make-up nearly peels off, some
of the erections look disturbingly
plasticine, and for all their opu
lence, the sets are, well, fakey.
In a lovely scene that could
easily be the last panel of a
parody in Mad — which, follow
ing the prevailing trends these
days, is currently previewing its
own forthcoming movie —and is
indicative both of the mentality
behind Caligula and of this re
viewer's reaction to the film,
McDowell, in sharp close-up and
excruciatingly slow motion,
leans forward, closes his eyes,
grimaces, and throws up into the
camera. Don't go see this movie.
(Caligula is currently playing
in Palo Alto at the Aquarius
Theatre, which should be
ashamed of itself.)
