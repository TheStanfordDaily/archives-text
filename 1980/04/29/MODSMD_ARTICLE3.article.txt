## Trustees urge Phillips reforms 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
For the second year in a row, the
University Board of Trustees,has de
cided to call on Phillips Petroleum
Corp. to dispose of its South African
assets unless its corporate affiliate
there adopts the Sullivan principles by
the end of 1981.
The principles involve corporate
conditions in the apartheid state.
The board's Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility agreed last
week with the Stanford Commission on
Investment Responsibility recommen
dation favoring this shareholder resol
ution.

Both CIR — an advisory group of
students, faculty, staff and alumni —
and the trustees backed a similar mea
sure on Phillips last year...
Several trustees indicated, according
to Bob Beyers of University News and
Publication, that they were "troubled"
by Phillips' lack of compliance with the
Sullivan principles.
At the time, the board members
asked the University staff to obtain
more information from the company.
'Troubled' by actions
According to Jonathon Bower, one
of the two student CIR members, the
commission also was troubled by Phil
lip's actions this past year. "We felt

Phillips had not made any effort at all
to comply (to the Sullivan principles),"
he said.
The Sullivan principles involve cer
tain minimal social criteria to be met
by U.S. companies with investments in
South Africa — including showing of
evidence of corporate commitment to
affirmative action programs, and non
discriminatory employment practices.
The trustees abstained in a split vote
on an IBM proxy which called for the
company to stop sales, leasing and ser
vice of computers used by the South
African government.
CIR had supported it 6-2 with the
minority favoring abstention. Stanford
owns 125.195 shares of IBM stock.
