## Trustees urge Phillips reforms 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
For the second year in a row, the
University Board of Trustees,has de
cided to call on Phillips Petroleum
Corp. to dispose of its South African
assets unless its corporate affiliate
there adopts the Sullivan principles by
the end of 1981.
The principles involve corporate
conditions in the apartheid state.
The board's Special Committee on
Investment Responsibility agreed last
week with the Stanford Commission on
Investment Responsibility recommen
dation favoring this shareholder resol
ution.

Both CIR — an advisory group of
students, faculty, staff and alumni —
and the trustees backed a similar mea
sure on Phillips last year...
Several trustees indicated, according
to Bob Beyers of University News and
Publication, that they were "troubled"
by Phillips' lack of compliance with the
Sullivan principles.
At the time, the board members
asked the University staff to obtain
more information from the company.
'Troubled' by actions
According to Jonathon Bower, one
of the two student CIR members, the
commission also was troubled by Phil
lip's actions this past year. "We felt

Phillips had not made any effort at all
to comply (to the Sullivan principles),"
he said.
The Sullivan principles involve cer
tain minimal social criteria to be met
by U.S. companies with investments in
South Africa — including showing of
evidence of corporate commitment to
affirmative action programs, and non
discriminatory employment practices.
The trustees abstained in a split vote
on an IBM proxy which called for the
company to stop sales, leasing and ser
vice of computers used by the South
African government.
CIR had supported it 6-2 with the
minority favoring abstention. Stanford
owns 125.195 shares of IBM stock.
Oppose two resolutions
Proxy votes based on the Universi
ty's 1 18,266 shares of General Electric
will oppose two shareholder resolu
tions calling for the company to phase
out its Morris operations nuclear stor
age facility and halt all commercial and
defense-related uranium mining. CIR
members had voted four in favor, two
against and two backing abstentions on
the Morris issue. Six members opposed
and two backed abstentions on the min
ing proxy.
In other issues, the trustees opposed
a shareholder proposal that Union
Carbide Corp. withdraw from South
Africa. This decision followed exten
sive discussion by the trustees, but they
voted the University's 27,345 proxy

votes against withdrawal, although the
CIR had split 4-4 on the issue.
Equal employment
The board committee also opposed a
proposal that Phillip Morris Corp. dis
close information on equal employ
ment opportunity programs, noting
that the company has stated a policy of
affirmative action and that a "number
of significant efforts are under way" in
that area.
The next set of CIR recommenda
tions is scheduled to come before the
trustees tomorrow. The CIR has been
meeting at least once a week for the
past month during this proxy season to
consider shareholder resolutions.
