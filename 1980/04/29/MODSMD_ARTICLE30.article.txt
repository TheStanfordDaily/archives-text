# The 						Rubinoos: Be-bop rock comes of age
## 
### 
"Rock and Roll Is Dead (and
We Don't Care)" . . . Strange
sentiments for one of the Bay
Area's leading and youngest re
cording groups? The song may
express the band's wry affection
for the music business, but be
ware, these lads can rock 'n' roll
with the best of the bunch.
The Rubinoos, a cherubic
looking musical foursome, re
cently enthralled a Saturday
night audience at the Keystone,
Palo Alto, that lively, though
largely unsung, local night spot.
Formed just a few years ago,
the band offers a refreshing al
ternative to high-decibel rock' n'
roll. Nightclub patrons were
treated to a combination of
stylized pop songs with a classic
45 sound as well as several
high-energy rock numbers.
Tight, polished four-part har
monies and lead singer Jon Ru
bin's sweet tenor and Beatlesque
movements added an element of
comic flair to bubble-gum num
bers "I Wanna Be Your Boyf
riend." "How Come Mothers
Always Know?" and "Rita."
Nonetheless, lead guitarist

Tommy Dunbar and bassist
Royse Ader. who boasts a big
booming voice, did rock justice
to numbers "Born To Be Wild"
and "Partytime." As musicians
capable of energy and versatility,
they quickly took the edge off
the band's be-bop veneer. Not
only did the Rubinoos play hard,
they managed to do so while
executing onstage shenanigans,
including Dunbar's imitations of
famous rock 'n' rollers.
Barely out of high school, the
band already has released two
albums on Beserkdey records,
The Rubinoos and Back to the
Drawing Board. Scoring hit sing
les with "I Think We're Alone
Now" and "Hold Me," the band
also recently toured with Elvis
Costello as well as trekking ac
ross Europe on its own.
An interview
Onstage, the Rubinoos are
rowdy but professional.
Offstage, they are utterly charm
ing. Tommy Dunbar, brother of
label-mate Earth Quake
guitarist Robbie, and Jon Rubin
sit backstage at the Keystone
preparing for the show. Co

founders of the group, these two
witty, warm men do not look old
enough to be 23 — but look too
young to be so successful or so
quick on the draw.
This will be no ordinary inter
view. Tommy eyes my gin and
tonic. Jon actually looks through
my notes. 1 sense dimly that
banalities and ignorance on my

part will not go unpunished in
this conversation. As a matter of
fact, the repartee will be excep
tional.
Great aficionados of the '50s
singles which have so influenced
the Rubinoos' musical direction.
Tommy and Jon are music trivia
buffs. I have come prepared.
However, Tommy guesses right
away that the original version of
"Master Jack" was done by Two
Jacks and a Jill. Damn impres
sive. Nor is it easy to get a
straight answer from these two.
Asked about their song "Rock
and Roll Is Dead (and We Don't
Care)," they humorously explain
that the song speaks for itself.
Describing it musically, they say
it is a cross between Chubby
Checkers and Deep Purple.
Some maintain that such a
tongue-in-cheek orientation re
nders these two musical
mavericks. They are amused by
the notion. Jon says it is OK to be
a maverick if you can still live at
your mom's house. Tommy says
his mom doesn't want h,m back.
Jon claims Tommy's mom will
take her son back.
The Rubinoos first played to
gether in school and lived at
home while the act gained
momentum. The group now is so
well established that it turns
down offers from national labels
like Warner Brothers. "They
just call us every week," jokes

Jon.
Tommy and Jon say the tour
with Klvis Costello, whose real
name, they claim, is Decklin
McMannis, was one of the best
things that ever happened to the
band. In addition to the national
exposure the Rubinoos received,
the experience was a maturing
one. Jon claims the band "came
of age on the tour."
Despite the success and
growth the band has seen, it faces
the imminent loss of bassist
Royse Ader. A tall, young man
(6'6"), Royse is leaving to join a
basketball team, Tommy jokes.
The band is auditioning for a new
bass player, although finding
someone who fits the Rubinoos'
youthful, yet accomplished
image could prove to be difficult.
Once Royse has been replaced,
the band will be on to new pro
jects, including a third Be
serkley.
Somewhere in the background
someone is listening to a televi
sion set. Tommy leaves to ap
propriate the electric blue pants
worn by one of the Barret
brothers of No Sisters fame, the
evening's opening act. They'll
look great when the Band does
"I I.ike Plastic." Jon goes off to
talk to the rest of the band. Me?
Time for another gin and tonic.
Rock 'n' roll may not be dead,
but it's taken on a new form.
