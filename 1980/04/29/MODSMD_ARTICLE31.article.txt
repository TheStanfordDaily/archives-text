						grope for soap in 'Steambath'
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Players' Steambath tells us a
lot about one man's view of God and the
value of life, and about the four-letter thea
ter which flourished in certain parts of New
York not so long ago. In particular, play
wright Bruce Jay Friedman says God is a fig
ment of the imagination (i.e. divinity is in the
eye of the beholder) and man, at least the
brownstone-to-borough variety, takes the
wrong things seriously — himself and
Bloomingdale's, for instance.
Friedman offers his usual dark and screwy
melange ofvulgarity. wit and New Yorkisms,
and the Players capitalize in a zany, although
terribly loose, production. Director Dan
McKereghan sometimes loses control of the
pace and doesn't quite tie up the ends
(Friedman often is guilty of throwing in too

many jokes, ideas, characters and not doing
enough with them.) But nothing can spoil
the play's brilliant comic idea: God is the
attendant of a NYC steambath, and his cus
tomers are those unfortunates sweating out
the time between NOW and FOREVER
MORE.
The Players also, unfortunately, suffer
from Steambath's outdated crudity, a delight
in onstage displays of cussing and bodily
functions which amused some people a de
cade or so ago. Today, it all seems childish:
the living theater needs to be reborn. Even
the flash of female nudity and those ultra
tight jockey briefs just don't work no more.
Eddie Velez is superb as the streetwise,
panther-smooth attendant/God who tests
the faith of New York Everyman Bruce A.

Anderson.
Laura McLarty and Frank Costa also stand
out in the admittedly lesser roles of a drippy
That Girl and a ballsy old guff. Friedman
likes to invert stereotypes to fit his ironic
hilarious-satiric ends and the cast takes ad
vantage.
Steambath's technical work needs no im
provement. save a sweeter-smelling brand of
steam. (Don't sit near the wings.) The show,
overall, needs a cleaning — a tightening up
and a stripping away of a few hesitancies in
direction and acting, and those dog-eared
vulgarities.

weekend.) _ Ka rc-n Wada
