Carter visits injured flightmen
SAN ANTONIO, Texas — President Jimmy Car
ter visited yesterday with the five Americans injured
in the aborted effort to free the hostages in Iran, and
said that he found them all ready to try again to rescue
their countrymen.
"All voiced gratitude for the chance to participate
and off ered to continue in every possible way, includ
ing the offer of their lives, to secure the safety and
freedom of the hostages," Carter told several
hundred soldiers and hospital workers as he left
Brooke Army Medical Center.
Carters 40-minute visit to the big facility where
four of the men are under treatment for burns was his
second and last stop here. The trip to San Antonio
was Carter's first such outing from the Washington
area since the hostages were seized on Nov. 4.
In his short talk to the friendly crowd that gathered
outside the hospital. Carter vehemently denounced
the Iranian leaders who helped arrange for the dis
play in Tehran Sunday of the bodies of eight Ameri
cans who died in a helicopter crash after the raid was
called off.
"I am filled with a sense of abhorrence and hor
ror." Carter said, "at the actions of Iranian officials in
recent days who violated all principles of humanity
and decency by exhibiting the bodies of the fellow
warriors of these brave men in Iran.
"They did not and could not bring dishonor on
those who fell in the performance of their duty. They
only brought dishonor on themselves and they indi
cated by this inhumane act of displaying these bodies
the kind of people with whom we have been dealing
to try to secure the freedom of our fellow Ameri
cans."
Europe calls for new U.N. action
LUXEMBOURG — Western European leaders
yesterday renewed their threat to impose economic
sanctions against Iran on May 17 unless "decisive
progress" is made toward freeing the 53 American
hostages. They also called for new U.N. efforts to try
to win the captives' release.
The nine-nation Common Market ended a two
day summit pledging solidarity with "the government
and people of the United States in their present time
of trial."
The expressions for support came despite displea
sure over the aborted U.N. rescue attempt in Iran and
the resignation yesterday of Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, who opposed the mission.
Privately, diplomats interviewed at the conference
remained puzzled and unsure of Washington's future
intentions in the aftermath of Friday's mission. They
also voiced their belief that the Americans, deliber
ately or not. had seriously misled them about the
military operation.
The European declaration urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to renew his ef
forts to gain freedom for the hostages, who spent
their 177 th day in captivity yesterday. Visits to
Tehran by Waldheim and a U.N. investigative com
mission earlier this year ended in failure.
The Common Market leaders also called on Is
lamic and other Third World nations to press the
Soviet Union again to withdraw its troops from Af
ghanistan. They said the central Asian country should
be made neutral and free of ouside interference.
Cronkite may join Anderson
WASHINGTON — And that's the way it could be,
John Anderson.
Walter Cronkite, one of the most popular and
highly trusted men in America, is quoted in a
magazine as saying he would be honored to team up
with Anderson in the 1980 presidential race.

Anderson would be the anchorman; Cronkite No.
2
The Illinois Republican congressman, recently
embarked on an independent campaign for the White
House, hasn't asked him to be his running mate,
Cronkite reportedly told the Sew Republic.
But it Anderson did invite Cronkite aboard, ac
cording to the magazine, CBS would lose television's
top newscaster faster than you could say Dan Rather.
"I'd be so honored to be asked, I wouldn't turn it
down." Cronkite is quoted as telling executive editor
Morton Kondracke. "It would be the right party. I've
been an independent all my life."
An Anderson aide said that the congressman, who
quit the Republican race and announced his inde
pendent bid last week, has not talked with anyone
about second place on his ticket.
Anderson's press spokesman. Mike Rosenbaum,
added, "There is no list of people being considered.
It's one for the back burner at this point."
Kondracke tells a different story.
"1 have it nice and high from the Anderson entour
age." he said, it's not a joke. I know it's been seri
ously discussed with the candidate. I wouldn't be
presumptuous enough to say that Cronkite is Ander
son's number one choice, but 1 do know he is being
considered."
Court upholds Delaware busing
WASHINGTON — Because of an unusual vote
cast by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Supreme
Court decided 5-3 yesterday to let stand a lower
court decision requiring extensive school busing
throughout Wilmington. Del., and surrounding sub
urban schools.
The effect of the court's action was to permit school
desegregation to go forward between Wilmington
and 1 1 independent school districts in New Castle
County. Delaware, which surrounds the city. The
desegregation plan, which is the most extensive ever
approved between a city and its suburbs, has been in
operation for nearly two years.
The Supreme Court's action does not change fed
eral law concerning the requirements for school de
segregation.
However, the justices' refusal to review the Wil
mington case gave a glimpse of the maneuvering and
voting alignments within the Supreme Court in
school desegregation controversies.
Burger is one of four justices who have suggested in
recent years that they think federal judges have gone
too far in imposing extensive school desegregation
plans. The other three justices sharing that view are
William Rehnquist. Lewis Powell and Potter Stewart.
Kennedy campaigns in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — It was a time of political cau
tion for Sen. Edward Kennedy as he completed his
quick visit to Mexico yesterday.
The Massachusetts Democrat carefully avoided
taking a clear-cut stand on how to stem or regulate
the flow of illegal aliens into the United States.
And he also declined to draw any political conclu
sions from the resignation of Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance or from the political fallout from the aborted
attempt to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran.
Kennedy indicated he is prepared to let today's
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
Iranian and Vance issues develop any material with
which he can attack President Jimmy Carter in the
campaign.
Kennedy did not disclose what he and President
Jose Lopez Portillo discussed during their 60-minute
private talk at the Mexico City presidential palace.
But it was learned that Kennedy sought to reassure
the Mexican leader on three points — that the United
States will not try unilateral solutions of border prob
lems. that the United States will respect Mexico's

right to keep and use its own oil and gas supplies for
its own people, and that a more enlightened trade
policy should be the goal of both countries.
Kennedy told Mexican reporters he believes in
granting amnesty, in some manner, to illegal aliens in
the United States and he thinks there is a "growing
consensus" for such a move.
He also restated his belief that "electric fences" are
not the answer to the flow of illegal aliens across the
border into the United States.
When a Mexican reporter suggested Kennedy's
visit was aimed at winning votes from Chicano voters,
the senator said,"Hispanics (in the U.S.) have a great
interest in the leaders of Mexico and are entitled to
our impressions of Mexico."
Refugees battle ocean storms
KEY WEST, Fla. — Federal authorities yesterday
seized three vessels in the "Freedom Flotilla" ferry
ing thousands of refugees from Cuba while the Coast
Guard found at least 14 small boats capsized in the
wake of a furious weekend storm.
One of the captains whose shrimp boat was seized
in Key West said he grossed over $170,000 on Sun
day. bringing in 260 refugees, including a mother who
gave birth during the voyage.
Gov. Bob Graham, meanwhile, declared a state of
emergency in two South Florida counties and acti
vated National Guardsmen to help protest the health
and safety of some 3500 refugees who have arrived
here in the past week despite warnings from the fed
eral government.
Graham released $50,000 in state aid and said he
was asking for emergency federal assistance.
The Coast Guard organized a sea search yesterday
after at least 14 small boats were found capsized and
abandoned in the wake of a storm that surged
through the Florida Straits with hurricane-force
winds up to 90 mph.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Samuel Dennis said it would
be "highly remarkable" if no boaters were killed.
300 arrested at Pentagon protest
WASHINGTON — More than 300 anti-nuclear
demonstrators were arrested at the Pentagon yester
day and hundreds more rallied in their support dur
ing a massive symbolic effort to "shut down" the huge
Defense Department headquarters in suburban Vir
ginia.
Shouting "No more nukes!" and "Shut down the
war machine!" the protesters jammed entranceways,
blocked traffic at some points and splattered what
they said was blood against the building.
To no one's surprise, the attempt to close the Pen
tagon failed. But hundreds of employees were incon
venienced or slowed as they clambered over and
around the chanting protesters at the entrances and
heard their pleas to stop working for the "death
machine."
The avowedly illegal "civil disobedience" action
marked the largest mass arrest of political de
monstrators on a single day here since the Mayday
anti-war demonstrations of May 3, 1971, when more
than 7000 persons were arrested in downtown
Washington.
Dow Jones closes with mild gain
NEW YORK — Merger candidates and special
situation stocks were the standouts yesterday as the
broad market faded in the final stretch after a mild
rally early in the session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks
closed with a gain of 1.88 at 805.46. The blue chip 1
index had posted a gain of more than 6 points earlier
in the session before that eroded in the afternoon.
Big Board volume came to a relatively slow 30.6
million shares, up from 28.59 million on Friday,
which was also a slow day.

LUXEMBOURG — Western European leaders
yesterday renewed their threat to impose economic
sanctions against Iran on May 17 unless "decisive
progress" is made toward freeing the 53 American
hostages. They also called for new U.N. efforts to try
to win the captives' release.
The nine-nation Common Market ended a two
day summit pledging solidarity with "the government
and people of the United States in their present time
of trial."
The expressions for support came despite displea
sure over the aborted U.N. rescue attempt in Iran and
the resignation yesterday of Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, who opposed the mission.
Privately, diplomats interviewed at the conference
remained puzzled and unsure of Washington's future
intentions in the aftermath of Friday's mission. They
also voiced their belief that the Americans, deliber
ately or not. had seriously misled them about the
military operation.
The European declaration urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to renew his ef
forts to gain freedom for the hostages, who spent
their 177 th day in captivity yesterday. Visits to
Tehran by Waldheim and a U.N. investigative com
mission earlier this year ended in failure.
The Common Market leaders also called on Is
lamic and other Third World nations to press the
Soviet Union again to withdraw its troops from Af
ghanistan. They said the central Asian country should
be made neutral and free of ouside interference.
Cronkite may join Anderson
WASHINGTON — And that's the way it could be,
John Anderson.
Walter Cronkite, one of the most popular and
highly trusted men in America, is quoted in a
magazine as saying he would be honored to team up
with Anderson in the 1980 presidential race.

Anderson would be the anchorman; Cronkite No.
2
The Illinois Republican congressman, recently
embarked on an independent campaign for the White
House, hasn't asked him to be his running mate,
Cronkite reportedly told the Sew Republic.
But it Anderson did invite Cronkite aboard, ac
cording to the magazine, CBS would lose television's
top newscaster faster than you could say Dan Rather.
"I'd be so honored to be asked, I wouldn't turn it
down." Cronkite is quoted as telling executive editor
Morton Kondracke. "It would be the right party. I've
been an independent all my life."
An Anderson aide said that the congressman, who
quit the Republican race and announced his inde
pendent bid last week, has not talked with anyone
about second place on his ticket.
Anderson's press spokesman. Mike Rosenbaum,
added, "There is no list of people being considered.
It's one for the back burner at this point."
Kondracke tells a different story.
"1 have it nice and high from the Anderson entour
age." he said, it's not a joke. I know it's been seri
ously discussed with the candidate. I wouldn't be
presumptuous enough to say that Cronkite is Ander
son's number one choice, but 1 do know he is being
considered."
Court upholds Delaware busing
WASHINGTON — Because of an unusual vote
cast by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Supreme
Court decided 5-3 yesterday to let stand a lower
court decision requiring extensive school busing
throughout Wilmington. Del., and surrounding sub
urban schools.
The effect of the court's action was to permit school
desegregation to go forward between Wilmington
and 1 1 independent school districts in New Castle
County. Delaware, which surrounds the city. The
desegregation plan, which is the most extensive ever
approved between a city and its suburbs, has been in
operation for nearly two years.
The Supreme Court's action does not change fed
eral law concerning the requirements for school de
segregation.
However, the justices' refusal to review the Wil
mington case gave a glimpse of the maneuvering and
voting alignments within the Supreme Court in
school desegregation controversies.
Burger is one of four justices who have suggested in
recent years that they think federal judges have gone
too far in imposing extensive school desegregation
plans. The other three justices sharing that view are
William Rehnquist. Lewis Powell and Potter Stewart.
Kennedy campaigns in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — It was a time of political cau
tion for Sen. Edward Kennedy as he completed his
quick visit to Mexico yesterday.
The Massachusetts Democrat carefully avoided
taking a clear-cut stand on how to stem or regulate
the flow of illegal aliens into the United States.
And he also declined to draw any political conclu
sions from the resignation of Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance or from the political fallout from the aborted
attempt to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran.
Kennedy indicated he is prepared to let today's
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
Iranian and Vance issues develop any material with
which he can attack President Jimmy Carter in the
campaign.
Kennedy did not disclose what he and President
Jose Lopez Portillo discussed during their 60-minute
private talk at the Mexico City presidential palace.
But it was learned that Kennedy sought to reassure
the Mexican leader on three points — that the United
States will not try unilateral solutions of border prob
lems. that the United States will respect Mexico's

right to keep and use its own oil and gas supplies for
its own people, and that a more enlightened trade
policy should be the goal of both countries.
Kennedy told Mexican reporters he believes in
granting amnesty, in some manner, to illegal aliens in
the United States and he thinks there is a "growing
consensus" for such a move.
He also restated his belief that "electric fences" are
not the answer to the flow of illegal aliens across the
border into the United States.
When a Mexican reporter suggested Kennedy's
visit was aimed at winning votes from Chicano voters,
the senator said,"Hispanics (in the U.S.) have a great
interest in the leaders of Mexico and are entitled to
our impressions of Mexico."
Refugees battle ocean storms
KEY WEST, Fla. — Federal authorities yesterday
seized three vessels in the "Freedom Flotilla" ferry
ing thousands of refugees from Cuba while the Coast
Guard found at least 14 small boats capsized in the
wake of a furious weekend storm.
One of the captains whose shrimp boat was seized
in Key West said he grossed over $170,000 on Sun
day. bringing in 260 refugees, including a mother who
gave birth during the voyage.
Gov. Bob Graham, meanwhile, declared a state of
emergency in two South Florida counties and acti
vated National Guardsmen to help protest the health
and safety of some 3500 refugees who have arrived
here in the past week despite warnings from the fed
eral government.
Graham released $50,000 in state aid and said he
was asking for emergency federal assistance.
The Coast Guard organized a sea search yesterday
after at least 14 small boats were found capsized and
abandoned in the wake of a storm that surged
through the Florida Straits with hurricane-force
winds up to 90 mph.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Samuel Dennis said it would
be "highly remarkable" if no boaters were killed.
300 arrested at Pentagon protest
WASHINGTON — More than 300 anti-nuclear
demonstrators were arrested at the Pentagon yester
day and hundreds more rallied in their support dur
ing a massive symbolic effort to "shut down" the huge
Defense Department headquarters in suburban Vir
ginia.
Shouting "No more nukes!" and "Shut down the
war machine!" the protesters jammed entranceways,
blocked traffic at some points and splattered what
they said was blood against the building.
To no one's surprise, the attempt to close the Pen
tagon failed. But hundreds of employees were incon
venienced or slowed as they clambered over and
around the chanting protesters at the entrances and
heard their pleas to stop working for the "death
machine."
The avowedly illegal "civil disobedience" action
marked the largest mass arrest of political de
monstrators on a single day here since the Mayday
anti-war demonstrations of May 3, 1971, when more
than 7000 persons were arrested in downtown
Washington.
Dow Jones closes with mild gain
NEW YORK — Merger candidates and special

broad market faded in the final stretch after a mild
rally early in the session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks

index had posted a gain of more than 6 points earlier
in the session before that eroded in the afternoon.
Big Board volume came to a relatively slow 30.6

Carter visits injured flightmen
SAN ANTONIO, Texas — President Jimmy Car
ter visited yesterday with the five Americans injured
in the aborted effort to free the hostages in Iran, and
said that he found them all ready to try again to rescue
their countrymen.
"All voiced gratitude for the chance to participate
and off ered to continue in every possible way, includ
ing the offer of their lives, to secure the safety and
freedom of the hostages," Carter told several
hundred soldiers and hospital workers as he left
Brooke Army Medical Center.
Carters 40-minute visit to the big facility where
four of the men are under treatment for burns was his
second and last stop here. The trip to San Antonio
was Carter's first such outing from the Washington
area since the hostages were seized on Nov. 4.
In his short talk to the friendly crowd that gathered
outside the hospital. Carter vehemently denounced
the Iranian leaders who helped arrange for the dis
play in Tehran Sunday of the bodies of eight Ameri
cans who died in a helicopter crash after the raid was
called off.
"I am filled with a sense of abhorrence and hor
ror." Carter said, "at the actions of Iranian officials in
recent days who violated all principles of humanity
and decency by exhibiting the bodies of the fellow
warriors of these brave men in Iran.
"They did not and could not bring dishonor on
those who fell in the performance of their duty. They
only brought dishonor on themselves and they indi
cated by this inhumane act of displaying these bodies
the kind of people with whom we have been dealing
to try to secure the freedom of our fellow Ameri

The Illinois Republican congressman, recently
embarked on an independent campaign for the White
House, hasn't asked him to be his running mate,
Cronkite reportedly told the Sew Republic.
But it Anderson did invite Cronkite aboard, ac
cording to the magazine, CBS would lose television's
top newscaster faster than you could say Dan Rather.
"I'd be so honored to be asked, I wouldn't turn it
down." Cronkite is quoted as telling executive editor
Morton Kondracke. "It would be the right party. I've
been an independent all my life."
An Anderson aide said that the congressman, who
quit the Republican race and announced his inde
pendent bid last week, has not talked with anyone
about second place on his ticket.
Anderson's press spokesman. Mike Rosenbaum,
added, "There is no list of people being considered.
It's one for the back burner at this point."
Kondracke tells a different story.
"1 have it nice and high from the Anderson entour
age." he said, it's not a joke. I know it's been seri
ously discussed with the candidate. I wouldn't be
presumptuous enough to say that Cronkite is Ander
son's number one choice, but 1 do know he is being
considered."
Court upholds Delaware busing
WASHINGTON — Because of an unusual vote
cast by Chief Justice Warren Burger, the Supreme
Court decided 5-3 yesterday to let stand a lower
court decision requiring extensive school busing
throughout Wilmington. Del., and surrounding sub
urban schools.
The effect of the court's action was to permit school
desegregation to go forward between Wilmington
and 1 1 independent school districts in New Castle
County. Delaware, which surrounds the city. The
desegregation plan, which is the most extensive ever
approved between a city and its suburbs, has been in
operation for nearly two years.
The Supreme Court's action does not change fed
eral law concerning the requirements for school de
segregation.
However, the justices' refusal to review the Wil
mington case gave a glimpse of the maneuvering and
voting alignments within the Supreme Court in
school desegregation controversies.
Burger is one of four justices who have suggested in
recent years that they think federal judges have gone
too far in imposing extensive school desegregation
plans. The other three justices sharing that view are
William Rehnquist. Lewis Powell and Potter Stewart.
Kennedy campaigns in Mexico
MEXICO CITY — It was a time of political cau
tion for Sen. Edward Kennedy as he completed his
quick visit to Mexico yesterday.
The Massachusetts Democrat carefully avoided
taking a clear-cut stand on how to stem or regulate
the flow of illegal aliens into the United States.
And he also declined to draw any political conclu
sions from the resignation of Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance or from the political fallout from the aborted
attempt to rescue U.S. hostages in Iran.
Kennedy indicated he is prepared to let today's
Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
Iranian and Vance issues develop any material with
which he can attack President Jimmy Carter in the
campaign.
Kennedy did not disclose what he and President
Jose Lopez Portillo discussed during their 60-minute
private talk at the Mexico City presidential palace.
But it was learned that Kennedy sought to reassure
the Mexican leader on three points — that the United
States will not try unilateral solutions of border prob
lems. that the United States will respect Mexico's

right to keep and use its own oil and gas supplies for
its own people, and that a more enlightened trade
policy should be the goal of both countries.
Kennedy told Mexican reporters he believes in
granting amnesty, in some manner, to illegal aliens in
the United States and he thinks there is a "growing
consensus" for such a move.
He also restated his belief that "electric fences" are
not the answer to the flow of illegal aliens across the
border into the United States.
When a Mexican reporter suggested Kennedy's
visit was aimed at winning votes from Chicano voters,
the senator said,"Hispanics (in the U.S.) have a great
interest in the leaders of Mexico and are entitled to
our impressions of Mexico."
Refugees battle ocean storms
KEY WEST, Fla. — Federal authorities yesterday
seized three vessels in the "Freedom Flotilla" ferry
ing thousands of refugees from Cuba while the Coast
Guard found at least 14 small boats capsized in the
wake of a furious weekend storm.
One of the captains whose shrimp boat was seized
in Key West said he grossed over $170,000 on Sun
day. bringing in 260 refugees, including a mother who
gave birth during the voyage.
Gov. Bob Graham, meanwhile, declared a state of
emergency in two South Florida counties and acti
vated National Guardsmen to help protest the health
and safety of some 3500 refugees who have arrived
here in the past week despite warnings from the fed
eral government.
Graham released $50,000 in state aid and said he
was asking for emergency federal assistance.
The Coast Guard organized a sea search yesterday
after at least 14 small boats were found capsized and
abandoned in the wake of a storm that surged
through the Florida Straits with hurricane-force
winds up to 90 mph.
Coast Guard Cmdr. Samuel Dennis said it would
be "highly remarkable" if no boaters were killed.
300 arrested at Pentagon protest
WASHINGTON — More than 300 anti-nuclear
demonstrators were arrested at the Pentagon yester
day and hundreds more rallied in their support dur
ing a massive symbolic effort to "shut down" the huge
Defense Department headquarters in suburban Vir
ginia.
Shouting "No more nukes!" and "Shut down the
war machine!" the protesters jammed entranceways,
blocked traffic at some points and splattered what
they said was blood against the building.
To no one's surprise, the attempt to close the Pen
tagon failed. But hundreds of employees were incon
venienced or slowed as they clambered over and
around the chanting protesters at the entrances and
heard their pleas to stop working for the "death
machine."
The avowedly illegal "civil disobedience" action
marked the largest mass arrest of political de
monstrators on a single day here since the Mayday
anti-war demonstrations of May 3, 1971, when more
than 7000 persons were arrested in downtown
Washington.
Dow Jones closes with mild gain
NEW YORK — Merger candidates and special
situation stocks were the standouts yesterday as the
broad market faded in the final stretch after a mild
rally early in the session.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks

index had posted a gain of more than 6 points earlier
in the session before that eroded in the afternoon.
Big Board volume came to a relatively slow 30.6
million shares, up from 28.59 million on Friday,
which was also a slow day.

Carter visits injured flightmen
SAN ANTONIO, Texas — President Jimmy Car
ter visited yesterday with the five Americans injured
in the aborted effort to free the hostages in Iran, and
said that he found them all ready to try again to rescue
their countrymen.
"All voiced gratitude for the chance to participate
and off ered to continue in every possible way, includ
ing the offer of their lives, to secure the safety and
freedom of the hostages," Carter told several
hundred soldiers and hospital workers as he left
Brooke Army Medical Center.
Carters 40-minute visit to the big facility where
four of the men are under treatment for burns was his
second and last stop here. The trip to San Antonio
was Carter's first such outing from the Washington
area since the hostages were seized on Nov. 4.
In his short talk to the friendly crowd that gathered
outside the hospital. Carter vehemently denounced
the Iranian leaders who helped arrange for the dis
play in Tehran Sunday of the bodies of eight Ameri
cans who died in a helicopter crash after the raid was
called off.
"I am filled with a sense of abhorrence and hor
ror." Carter said, "at the actions of Iranian officials in
recent days who violated all principles of humanity
and decency by exhibiting the bodies of the fellow
warriors of these brave men in Iran.
"They did not and could not bring dishonor on
those who fell in the performance of their duty. They
only brought dishonor on themselves and they indi
cated by this inhumane act of displaying these bodies
the kind of people with whom we have been dealing
to try to secure the freedom of our fellow Ameri
cans."
Europe calls for new U.N. action
LUXEMBOURG — Western European leaders
yesterday renewed their threat to impose economic
sanctions against Iran on May 17 unless "decisive
progress" is made toward freeing the 53 American
hostages. They also called for new U.N. efforts to try
to win the captives' release.
The nine-nation Common Market ended a two
day summit pledging solidarity with "the government
and people of the United States in their present time
of trial."
The expressions for support came despite displea
sure over the aborted U.N. rescue attempt in Iran and
the resignation yesterday of Secretary of State Cyrus
Vance, who opposed the mission.
Privately, diplomats interviewed at the conference
remained puzzled and unsure of Washington's future
intentions in the aftermath of Friday's mission. They
also voiced their belief that the Americans, deliber
ately or not. had seriously misled them about the
military operation.
The European declaration urged U.N.
Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim to renew his ef
forts to gain freedom for the hostages, who spent
their 177 th day in captivity yesterday. Visits to
Tehran by Waldheim and a U.N. investigative com
mission earlier this year ended in failure.
The Common Market leaders also called on Is
lamic and other Third World nations to press the
Soviet Union again to withdraw its troops from Af
ghanistan. They said the central Asian country should
be made neutral and free of ouside interference.
Cronkite may join Anderson
WASHINGTON — And that's the way it could be,
