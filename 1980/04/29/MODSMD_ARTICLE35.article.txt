Freshman issue
First-year Daily staffers will meet
Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Daily to plan
the first-year staffer issue scheduled to
dazzle the Stanford community on May
12. Sandwiches will not be served.
Correction
The Daily incorrectly stated in an
article on a LOTS computer facility
breakdown that Digital Equipment
Corporation is a part of Stanford. Digi
tal Equipment Corporation is head
quartered in Massachusetts. The Daily
regrets the error.
