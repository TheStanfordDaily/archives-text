From the Daily wire services
TEHRAN, Iran â€” Iran's Revolutionary Council decided
last night to turn over the bodies of eight American ser
vicemen to representatives of the pope and the Interna
tional Red Cross for repatriation to their families in the
United States.
The decision, which appeared to end a quarrel between
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and his Moslem clerical
rivals over the issue, came as the militant students occupy
ing the U.S. Embassy here announced further transfers of
their hostages to distant Iranian cities to thwart any future
U.S. rescue attempt. If the students' statements are accu
rate, hostages are now being held in five cities besides the
capital, Tehran.
In other developments, a wave of terrorist bombings in
the capital killed at least four persons, and intensified fight
ing was reported between government forces and Kurdish
guerrillas in the western Kurdish region.
The Revolutionary Council's decision to allow the repat
riation of the remains of the U.S. servicemen who died
during an abortive hostage rescue mission followed a dis
pute within the Iranian leadership over using the badly
burned corpses to try to extract concessions from the Un
ited States and to make propaganda points.
On Sunday a top Moslem clergyman, Ayatollah Sadegh
Khalkhali, stage-managed a macabre presentation at the
occupied U.S. Embassy compound in which the Americans'
remains were used as props for a denunciation of U.S.
policies and President Jimmy Carter. The bodies were later
turned over to Revolutionary Guards and delivered to the
Tehran morgue, where the bodies were being kept pending
a government decision on what to do with them.
The Islamic Republican Party, led by Bani-Sadr's main
clerical rival, Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti, spearheaded
the opposition to the president's decision Saturday to allow
the remains to be returned to the United States.
Beheshti was quoted in an interview yesterday as saying,
"Such important political decisions should be discussed in
the Revolutionary Council, and it is the Revolutionary
Council that should decide."
Beheshti's party newspaper, Islamic Republic, said in an
editorial: "These bodies have political value for us." It
suggested that the remains be held in Iran until Washington

agrees to release Iranian assets frozen in the United States.
"The frozen Iranian assets can he taken out of the Ameri
can claws, and other advantages can be taken, too," the
paper said.
Last night's Revolutionary Council decision amounted to
a compromise between Bani-Sadr and Beheshti, stipulating
that the remains be returned to the servicemen's families
through intermediaries other than the U.S. government.
But the council reportedly admonished Beheshti for drag
ging his quarrel over the bodies before the public.
In papering oVer the dispute, Bani-Sadr last night issued a
statement charging that the United States "does not attach
any value to human beings" and saying that it was "not clear
whether the U.S. government would give the bodies back to
the families."
Therefore, the statement said, the president asked radical
Greek Catholic Archbishop Hilarion Capucci, Iran's favo
rite Christian, to "take responsibility for repatriation of the
bodies." Bani-Sadr said that Capucci, who has visited Iran
several times and supports the aims of the embassy milit
ants, had accepted the Iranian request.
A spokesman for Bani-Sadr said that the International
Red Cross would also be involved in the repatriation, and
that the remains would be returned "as soon as possible."
In their latest communique, meanwhile, the militants
occupying the U.S. Embassy here said they had dispatched
some of their 50 hostages to three more Iranian cities as part
of their plan to scatter them across the country following the
failed U.S. rescue bid.
The militants said an undisclosed number of hostages had
been sent to the central Iranian city of Isfahan, the country's
second largest; the town of Najafabad about 15 miles west
of Isfahan; and the city of Yazd. about 110 miles from the
site of the desert accident in which the eight Americans died
early Friday.
Sunday the militants announced that some hostages were
sent to the holy city of Qom. 90 miles south of Tehran, and
to Tabriz in the northwestern corner of the country.
The militants' statement that Madani, the governor gen
eral of East Azerbaijan province, had turned the consulate
over to them further demonstrated the Iranian govern
ment's de facto involvement in the holding of the hostages,
