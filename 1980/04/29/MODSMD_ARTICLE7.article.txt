# Acting State Dept. head a Stanford grad
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer, with wire reports 
Undersecretary of State Warren
Christopher, a 1949 Stanford Law
School graduate, was named acting
secretary of state yesterday.
The selection was praised by his gov
ernment colleagues and former as
sociates in California, many of whom
urged that he be named permanently to
the post.
A Carter administration official said
the president is expected to move

quickly to name a successor for Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance, who resigned
Sunday over disagreement with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter on the military mis
sion to rescue American hostages in
Iran. However, the official told The
Los Angeles Times that the odds are
against the 54-year-old Christopher
being chosen as Vance's permanent re
placement.
Christopher was the first president of
the Stanford Law Review. He helped
organize the review with classmate
Shirley Mount Hufstedler, now Secret
ary of Education.
He also served as a member of the
Board of Trustees here from June 1972
through January 1977, when he was
named deputy secretary of state
under Vance.
Until his State Department ap
pointment in 1977, Christopher was a
prominent lawyer in the prestigious
Los Angeles firm O'Melveny and
Myers.
Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown, Sr., said yesterday that Christ
opher "would make a superb secretary
of state." Christopher served as one of
Brown's chief counselors in Sac
ramento.
"He has my unreserved en
thusiasm," added Secretary of Educa
tion Hufstedler.
Christopher, the one-time president,
of the Los Angeles County Bar Associ
ation, has earned the nickname Mr.
Cool for his calm, low-keyed conduct
under the most intensive pressure.
Although Christopher served in
Brown's eight-year administration for
only a few months, the ex-governor
said he remained a kitchen cabinet ad

viser. Brown praised Christopher's
work as vice chairman of a state com
mission that studied the Watts riots of
1965 and recommended changes to al
leviate black complaints — work that
earned Christopher his first
Washington appointment as deputy at
torney general in 1967.
In 1970, Christopher devised the
legal plan for severing Stanford Re
search Institute (now SRI Interna
tional) from the University.
There also was support for Christ
opher from colleagues in the State De
partment, where he has been an ad
ministrator and a global trouble
shooter during three years as Vance's
chief aide.

He survived an angry mob when he
went to Taiwan last year to make the
break with the Nationalist Chinese
government before the establishment
of U.S. ties with Communist China.
Earlier, Christopher took over much
of the difficult negotiation of the
Panama Canal treaties, ironing out
problems with the Panamanians and
even more difficult ones with the U.S.
Senate. Currently, he has been charged
with rallying U.S. allies to support U.S.
sanctions against the Soviet Union fol
lowing the Afghanistan invasion.
Associate Dean of Stanford Law
School Keith Mann, who has known
Christopher since 1949, and who
worked as a Supreme Court clerk with
Christopher, called him "superbly
trained. He has infinite amounts of ex
perience."
After graduating from Stanford,
Christopher served as law clerk to the
late Justice William O. Douglas.
Christopher is "always very self
contained and cool under fire," Mann
said. "I've never know him to be flapp
able about anything."
Several of Christopher's law school
associates also called him "extremely
able."
According to Law Prof. John Kap
lan, "He was a brilliant student here.
He is an absolutely superb, first-rate
human being."
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said that
he is also "highly regarded as a compe
tent lawyer."
Vice President of Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig called Christopher
"extremely reliable and discreet" and
"a skilled negotiator."


Warren Christopher
He added that "if it (the position)
takes personal ability, he's got it."
Acting Law Prof. James Atwood
said Christopher would "he an excel
lent choice. He has been running a
good deal of the department's activities
over the past three years and has been
very close to Secretary Vance. As
Vance undertook special assignments,
Christopher manned'much of the de
partment's work. He has the respect of
the State Department, confidence of
the people and good relations with
Congress."

Born in Scranton, N.D., on Oct. 27,
1925, Christopher's family moved to
Los Angeles when he was a child. In
high school, he was a stringer for the
Hollywood Citizen-News, reporting
high school sports for 10 cents an inch.
He graduated with honors from the
University of Southern California in
1945.
Christopher's first marriage ended in
divorce. In 1956, he married Marie
Wyllis, a Los Angeles schoolteacher.
They have two sons and a daughter by
his firstAnarriage.

Brown's eight-year administration for
only a few months, the ex-governor
said he remained a kitchen cabinet ad

viser. Brown praised Christopher's
work as vice chairman of a state com
mission that studied the Watts riots of
1965 and recommended changes to al
leviate black complaints — work that
earned Christopher his first
Washington appointment as deputy at
torney general in 1967.
In 1970, Christopher devised the
legal plan for severing Stanford Re
search Institute (now SRI Interna
tional) from the University.
There also was support for Christ
opher from colleagues in the State De
partment, where he has been an ad
ministrator and a global trouble
shooter during three years as Vance's
chief aide.

He survived an angry mob when he
went to Taiwan last year to make the
break with the Nationalist Chinese
government before the establishment
of U.S. ties with Communist China.
Earlier, Christopher took over much
of the difficult negotiation of the
Panama Canal treaties, ironing out
problems with the Panamanians and
even more difficult ones with the U.S.
Senate. Currently, he has been charged
with rallying U.S. allies to support U.S.
sanctions against the Soviet Union fol
lowing the Afghanistan invasion.
Associate Dean of Stanford Law
School Keith Mann, who has known
Christopher since 1949, and who
worked as a Supreme Court clerk with
Christopher, called him "superbly
trained. He has infinite amounts of ex
perience."
After graduating from Stanford,
Christopher served as law clerk to the
late Justice William O. Douglas.
Christopher is "always very self
contained and cool under fire," Mann
said. "I've never know him to be flapp
able about anything."
Several of Christopher's law school
associates also called him "extremely
able."
According to Law Prof. John Kap
lan, "He was a brilliant student here.
He is an absolutely superb, first-rate
human being."
Law Prof. Gerald Gunther said that
he is also "highly regarded as a compe
tent lawyer."
Vice President of Public Affairs
Robert Rosenzweig called Christopher
"extremely reliable and discreet" and
"a skilled negotiator."


Warren Christopher
He added that "if it (the position)
takes personal ability, he's got it."
Acting Law Prof. James Atwood
said Christopher would "he an excel
lent choice. He has been running a
good deal of the department's activities
over the past three years and has been
very close to Secretary Vance. As
Vance undertook special assignments,
Christopher manned'much of the de
partment's work. He has the respect of
the State Department, confidence of
the people and good relations with
Congress."

Born in Scranton, N.D., on Oct. 27,
1925, Christopher's family moved to
Los Angeles when he was a child. In
high school, he was a stringer for the
Hollywood Citizen-News, reporting
high school sports for 10 cents an inch.
He graduated with honors from the
University of Southern California in
1945.
Christopher's first marriage ended in
divorce. In 1956, he married Marie
Wyllis, a Los Angeles schoolteacher.
They have two sons and a daughter by
his firstAnarriage.
Undersecretary of State Warren
Christopher, a 1949 Stanford Law
School graduate, was named acting
secretary of state yesterday.
The selection was praised by his gov
ernment colleagues and former as
sociates in California, many of whom
urged that he be named permanently to
the post.
A Carter administration official said
the president is expected to move

quickly to name a successor for Secret
ary of State Cyrus Vance, who resigned
Sunday over disagreement with Presi
dent Jimmy Carter on the military mis
sion to rescue American hostages in
Iran. However, the official told The
Los Angeles Times that the odds are
against the 54-year-old Christopher
being chosen as Vance's permanent re
placement.
Christopher was the first president of
the Stanford Law Review. He helped
organize the review with classmate
Shirley Mount Hufstedler, now Secret
ary of Education.
He also served as a member of the
Board of Trustees here from June 1972
through January 1977, when he was
named deputy secretary of state
under Vance.
Until his State Department ap
pointment in 1977, Christopher was a
prominent lawyer in the prestigious
Los Angeles firm O'Melveny and
Myers.
Former California Gov. Edmund
Brown, Sr., said yesterday that Christ
opher "would make a superb secretary
of state." Christopher served as one of
Brown's chief counselors in Sac
ramento.
"He has my unreserved en
thusiasm," added Secretary of Educa
tion Hufstedler.
Christopher, the one-time president,
of the Los Angeles County Bar Associ
ation, has earned the nickname Mr.
Cool for his calm, low-keyed conduct
under the most intensive pressure.
