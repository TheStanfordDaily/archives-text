# 11 years as an undergraduate degree
## Afro-American studies program thrives 
### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
In 1969, Stanford became the first of all major
private universities to grant undergraduate degrees in
Afro-Amcrican studies. The still-developing prog
ram appears to be going strong after 11 years. How
ever, in their attempt to expose students to a multip
licity of cultures, program directors express some
disappointment in the small white student enroll
ment.
African studies here date back to the 1920s but
those earlier programs were designed only for
graduate students. A degree has never been offered
to graduate students.
Students tended to pursue graduate programs in
other disciplines but maintained an Afro-American
focus in their studies, according to Sylvia Wynter,
chairperson of African and Afro-American Studies.
It was not until the 1960s that a strong student
interest, coupled with the civil rights movement, en
couraged the organization of an undergraduate dis
cipline, Wynter added.
The program plans were spearheaded by several
black organizations and a number of interested in
dividuals. Funding came from the Ford Foundation
in a grant intended to improve the international rela
tions program. The program began in January of
1969 under the direction of Anthropology Prof.

James Gibbs, Jr., a black anthropologist who later
served as dean of undergraduate studies here.
"We didn't just slap something together; our prog
ram had intellectual substance," noted Gibbs. "We
wanted a strong African component, because intel
lectually you have to know both the old world and the
new world, we also had strength there, given the
composition of the faculty," Gibbs added.
Yale followed with a Black Studies program three
weeks later and Harvard was not far behind. The first
group to enter Stanford's program was comprised of
13 students, including a few white students.
Stanford administrators insisted upon having a
good faculty and enouraged students to double their
majors.
"We wanted students to have enough strength in a
discipline so they could go on to graduate school,"
Gibbs said.
Currently, there are 12 students, none of whom is
white, majoring in Afro-American studies at Stan
ford, according to Wynter. They are all encouraged to
pursue multiple majors, and many also take advan
tage of studying abroad in Africa at the University of
Nairobi.
Courses in this inter-departmental major cover a
wide range of disciplines from "Afro-American
Poetry" and "Afro-American History" to "Inter
mediate Swahili" and "Anthropology of Film."
"Black Americans are not African; they are a

blend of cultures and must deal with a dual culture
identity," said Sue Ross, assistant chairperson of Af
rican and Afro-American Studies here. "There is no
absolute identity, but one needs the majority culture.
What we want is the admission of multiple cultures,
not a ranking," Ross added.
One large concern of the current program directors
is the limited white student participation. "We tend
to think of Afro-American studies as something that
is there just for black students," Gibbs said. "The
program is open to all students, but racism is man
ifesting itself in a boycott of classes," he added.
The strongest area of Afro-American studies at
Stanford is in literature, with anthropology, history,
and psychology following close behind. Wynter notes
that political science and sociology need more faculty
in black studies to help "remove the sense of incom
pleteness" in the program.
In addition to a more complete course schedule,
the Afro-American program plans to organize a
graduate search component which would work within
the university framework. Being included in the
Western Culture requirements might also encourage
students to enroll in the introductory courses, prog
ram planners believe.
"We are being more universal with our program,"
said Wynter. "We are the pilgrims."
