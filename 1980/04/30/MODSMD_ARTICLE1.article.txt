WASHINGTON — President
Jimmy Carter, moving swiftly to eon
tain the damage to U.S. foreign policy
caused by Cyrus Vance's resignation,
named Maine's Democratic Sen. Ed
mund Muskie yesterday as his new sec
retary of state.
Carter's choice of Muskie, which
came as a stunning surprise, was an
nounced at a late afternoon ceremony
in the White House press room, where
Muskie pointedly said, "The president
has left no doubt in my mind . . . that I
will be the foreign policy spokesman"
for the administration.
The remark seemed especially sig
nificant because of the circumstances
leading up to Muskie's appointment
Vance's resignation in protest against
last week's abortive attempt to rescue
the American hostages in Iran, and
subsequent speculation that Vance had
lost out to Carter's national security
affairs adviser, Zbigniew Br/ezinski. in
the struggle for control of foreign pol
icy.
Broad smiles
Standing behind Carter and Muskie
(in the podium were Vance and
Br/ezinski, both smiling broadly, as
well as Vice President Walter Mori
dale, Defense Secretary Harold
Brown, whose Pentagon planners con
ceived the ill-fated rescue attempt, and
acting Secretary of State Warren Chris
topher. who had been widely expected
to get the nod as Vance's successor.
Carter made clear that Christopher
had agreed to stayon as Muskie's deputy
and referred to them as a team "that
will provide continuity for our foreign
policy." White House sources said the
president personally had asked Christ

opher, who was Vance's choice to be
his successor, to remain in the deputy
post.
Muskie's principal reputation, and
his major interest in recent years, has
been built on domestic policy issues,
principally those related to the envi
ronment and government spending. In
fact, his departure from Congress will
leave a big \ oid in the leadership in the
fighting over those questions.
There was an initial tendency last
night to assume that by turning to
Muskie, Carter had pulled off a bril
liant political stroke. According to this
view, he came up with a man who en
joys national stature and has great in
fluence with Congress, but who will
have to go through a trial-and-error
period before he is in a position to in
tervene authoritatively in the policy di
rections now being pursued by the pres
ident under Brzezinski's general gui
dance.
Tough fighter
Vet Muskie is known as a tough
lighter and a man who knows how to
wheel and deal in Washington power
circles, and he could use the free-and
easy political style of his Senate years in
ways that will provide surprises.
Explaining the choice ot Muskie,
White House press secretary Jody
Powell said. "There was a feeling we
needed someone of stature who would
project a general sense of continuity."
Powell also said the administration
sought a nominee who would quickly
gain Senate confirmation, and some
one "with whom the president felt
comfortable."
In a statement issued earlier in the
day, Muskie referred to the controver
sial rescue mission in terms that ap
peared to put him squarely behind Car
ter's approach to the Iran situation. He

said:
"I believe the president had the au
thority and the responsibility to
explore the feasibility of a rescue mis
sion, to develop it as an option and to
carry it out at such time as his best
judgment dictated.
Carter press conference
Later in the day at an evening press
conference. Carter said that failure to
attempt a military rescue of the U.S.
hostages in Iran would have been far
worse than the actual 112 ailure of the mis
sion that was undertaken — even
though it ended in tragedy.
"There is a deeper failure than that
of incomplete success," he said as he
paid tribute to the 90-man commando
team that slipped into Iran last Thurs
day, "and that is the failure to attempt a
worthy effort, a failure to try."
Confirming that he had met secretly
on Sunday with many of the key par
ticipants in the aborted raid. Carter
said that "this is a sentiment shared by
the men who went on the mission."
Although he opened tho half-hour
meeting by praising the bravery and
determination of those who made the
rescue attempt. Carter heaped con
tempt tor those Iranians who put the
bodies of the dead American service
men on displiv.
Carter declared that Iranian milit
ants and government leaders had. by
their actions, "aroused the disgust and
contempt of the rest of the world."
By cold-bloodedly displaying the
remains of the dead Americans. Carter
said, "they did not bring shame and
dishonor on those fallen Americans.
They brought shame and dishonor
upon themselves."
'Abhorrent act'
"The man who supervised the desec

ration ol the bodies was a member of
the Revolutionary Council," Carter
said. "Other members ot the Iranian
government did publicly condemn this
abhorrent act and have now promised
to deliver the American bodies to in
termediaries and ultimately back to our
country. We hope that this commit
ment will be kept and I pray that it
will.
"We will not forget our hostages,"
the president vowed, "and we will con
tinue to take whatever steps are neces
sary and feasible to secure their safe
release and their return to their homes
and freedom."
