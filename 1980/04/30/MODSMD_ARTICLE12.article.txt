# World nears brink of financial disaster
## 
### Hobart Rowen The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — A world operating
under a shaky international monetary sys
tem was brought that much closer to the
brink of financial disaster by America's
unsuecesslul military operation in Iran.
Affects atmosphere
"It affects the atmosphere," says inter
national expert Lawrence Krause of
Brookings Institution. "Everyone won
ders what happens next. It's a very
dangerous time." The resignation of Sec
retary of State Cyrus Vance is widely vie
wed abroad as the removal of the last
voice ot moderation from the Carter ad
ministration.
What worries financial experts most is
that any new crisis might induce large dol
lar holders among the OPEC nations to
pull their investments out of U.S. banks,
and out of dollar-denominated assets in
the huge Euro-dollar market. A

worldwide financial panic could ensue,
turning anticipated recession into some
thing worse.
The stability ol the Euro-dollar market,
estimated by some to be as much as SI
trillion, has already been shaken by the
U.S. freeze of Iranian assets, one of the
main causes of the rush into gold at the
end of 1979 by large Arab depositors.
OPEC surplus
Presently, OPEC surpluses are ac
cumulatingat the astonishing rate of $1 20
billion a year (equal to $10 billion every
month). This re-emerging OPEC surplus,
which is expected to continue to grow at
this rate for the next several years, is still
going heavily into dollars, despite Arab
efforts at diversification.
But the weakened political position of
the United States could change that
course dramatically. Taking Carter and
Defense Secretary I larold Brown at their
word, a new military adventure — one

that could ultimately embroil the United
States with the Soviet Union — can't he
ruled out.
At this fragile moment, the unspoken
question in leading financial circles is
whether the banking system is strong
enough to pull through without a panic.
Testimony
In sobering testimony before the Se
nate Banking Committee. Michael Mof
fitt of the Institute for Policy Studies, said
that the "global interest-rate war" among
the United States and other major coun
tries is forcing the world into a dangerous
deflation.
Die U.S. recession is likely to be a
corker, and the European and Japanese
economies are poised for what economist
Harald (ccj) Malmgren calls "a collective
downturn."
Worst of all. the International Monet
ary Fund, which should be the key agency
to deal with these problems, has just let an

opportunity go by at its Hamburg meeting
to beet up its resources and its role rela
tive to world trade. The temporary im
provement of the dollar — as interest
rates skyrocketed — plus the departure of
former Treasury Under Secretary An
thony Solomon hurt the I MI- effort to
create a "substitution account" for the
dollar.
Substitution account
Treasury Secretary G. William Miller
has never had much interest in the Sub
stitution Account, which now, in effect, is
in a state of suspense tor the balance of
the Carter administration.
Meanwhile, the vast Euro market goes
along virtually unregulated. "We can't
even guess what the dimensions of a crack
in the Euro-dollar market might be,"
Alan Greenspan told a private audience
in Washington the other day. As usual, it
probably will be crisis first, with repairs
attempted later.
