# Carter endorsed slashing of military defense budget

### George F. Will The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Hours before the eight old
helicopters lilted off the deck of the USS Nimitz,
bound for disaster in the desert, Jimmy Carter sent
a letter to House Speaker Tip O'Neill, endorsing a
move to slash his own defense budget by $3.8
billion. This would drive the "post-Afghanistan"
defense budget below even the level called for in
Carter's January budget, which even Carter
quickly repudiated as inadequate.
Lesson
Zbigniew Brzezinski says the lesson of the
aborted rescue mission in Iran is: "Do not scoff at
American power. Do not scoff at American
reach." But the mission resembled the Bay of Pigs
operation in its tentativeness, in shaving the margin
of safety, thereby betraying lack of conviction.
You would not expect conviction from a presi
dent who has repeatedly and pettily disparaged the
"Mayaguez" rescue, which rescued. You would
hardly expect conviction from a President whose
proudest and loudest campaign boast — even after
two soldiers died defending our embassy in Pakis
tan — was that during his presidency no American
had died in combat. You would hardly expect con
viction in the use of military assets by a President
who struggles to decrease those assets.
Hogging the military
The failed mission will be another occasion for
Hogging the military. Already a Washington Post
commentary is headlined: "Another President
111-Served by the Military He Heads." Actually,
the military has been ill-served by the president
and his appointees, including some senior officers

who arc distinguished primarily by behavior con
venient for their civilian benefactors.
Consider Harold Brown, the secretary of de
fense, and General David Jones, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Cut spending
As secretary of defense. Brown has deceptively
packaged four straight budgets cutting real spend
ing below that of the previous year. He has been a
central factor in the advertising of first a fraudulent
five percent, then a fraudulent three percent, de
fense increase, and has even tried to reduce this
year's spending to produce the illusion of increases
next year.
Jones is an Air Force general who was elevated
to the chairmanship of the JCS after service selling
the Panana Canal treaties and quelling Air Force
protests about Carter's unilateral and unrecipro
cated killing ol the B-l bomber. Fraudulent re
cruiting by sergeants reflects an atmosphere of
abandoned integrity at the highest levels, by those
who (to take just one example) say that the F-15s
at Langley Air Base,which are only 40 percent
operationally ready, are ready to fight a war.
Nothing changes. Carter abandoned his stay
at-home policy six days before the Texas primary
to fly to Texas to visit the casualties of the Iran
mission. He thereby indicated his unchanged de
termination that Iran shall remain the sun around
which his campaign, and American foreign policy,
revolves. Harold Brown, asked about Iran's
nauseating display of American bodies, said the
display was "disappointing." Nothing changes:
Those disappointing Iranians still won't live up to
administration expectations.
