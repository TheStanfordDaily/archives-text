# Carter, Reagan may clinch nominations in May
## California primary may settle little 
### Doug Willis The Associated Press 
SACRAMENTO — Califor
nia's June 3 primary could be
Sen. Edward Kennedy's last
hope to stop President Jimmy
Carter's drive for the Democra
tic nomination. and it may clinch
the Republican nomination for
Ronald Reagan.
Or. the primary could be a
meaningless afterthought il
Reagan and Carter have all the
delegates they need for their
party nominations before
Californians even vote.
California still could be the
focus in the coming month of a
presidential campaign rivaling
New Hampshire in intensity and
importance, particularly in the
race for the state's 30b Democ
ratic delegates.
But as Reagan and Carter con
tinue to amass delegates, it ap
pears more likely that California
may be the forgotten presiden
tial primary of 1980.
In 1976. Reagan and (iov.
Jerry Brown were landslide win
ners in California. But cir
cumstances are so different
today that those results have lit
tle meaning.
Reagan was favored by 74
percent of the Republicans in
one recent poll, virtually assur
ing the former California gover
nor all I b.S delegates under
California winner-take-all GOP
rules.
Since the No. 2 GOP candi
date in that poll. John Anderson,
has abandoned the Republican
race for an independent cam
paign. Reagan's only active rival
is George Bush. With polls b-1
against him. Bush hasn't even
made a token effort in Califor
nia.
The Democratic race is much
closer, with Kennedy holding a

42-3 l > lead over Carter in the
latest poll. Hut unless Kennedy
makes speetaeular gains in the 1 2
Democratic primaries between
today and June 3. even a
California landslide wouldn't
help his campaign.
However, even it California's
presidential primary becomes a
showdown that never happens,
the ballot contains issues and
races ol immense importance to
the future ol state government
and politics.
Among top contests on the
California ballot are:
— Proposition 9. the latest

tax cut initiative by Proposition
13 co-author Howard Jarvis.
gives taxpayers another oppor
tunity to reduce their own taxes
by an additional 53.5 billion to
$5 billion annually and to force
more cuts in state and local gov -
eminent budgets.
Without the huge surplus that
cushioned Proposition 13's ef
fects two years ago. the debate
over Proposition 9centers on the
question ol whether state and
local governments can absorb
this second budget squeeze by
cutting fat and frills, rather than
essential services.

Propositions I 0 and I 1. the
rent and oil tax initiatives, luck
the immediate impact on voters
that Proposition V promises
Hut hii.,, have hroad ramifica
tions.
Most local rent control ordi
nances would he curbed or in
validated if Proposition 10 is
enacted. Proposition I I imposes
a surtax on California oil com
pany profits to support local
transit systems. Both the poten
tial benefit to lotiil transit ;iikJ
the harm to California's business
climate are subjects ol intense
debate.
