## Senate endorsements 
### 
Next Monday and Tuesday's ASSU elec
tion marks the beginning of a new era for
the ASSU Senate and Stanford student
government. The recently passed constitu
tional amendment, which has brought us
this election, is a step in the right direction
for tht senate. The senate will now be a
year-long working body, from registration
day until the spring elections. Summer
months will from now on be a time of plan
ning and communication between
senators, the Council of Presidents and
other ASSU officials, instead of wasted
time.
Next week's election is thus doubly im
portant. Not only is another senate being
chosen, but it is the first Senate to have the
opportunity to make use of its new lease on
lite. It is a senate that will take the fine
groundwork from this year's group, and go
to work early in the year with a myriad of
issues to tackle.
Forty-eight undergraduates and 1 1
graduate students are running for the 10
senate openings for each group. The in
terest these students have shown in the
election is encouraging, considering the
fact that less than three weeks ago, the
campus was fated with another election
that gave students little time to think about
and prepare for this senate election.
We make the following endorsements
based on interviews with a large number of
the undergraduate candidates and less than
halt of the graduate candidates. No candi
dates who were not interviewed were con
sidered for an endorsement, and we de
cided early on to endorse only those candi
dates we felt would make effective
senators. We did not have a quota of can
didates to endorse.
The following nine undergraduate stu
dents would, in our opinion, make able and
hard-working senators. The graduate stu
dent endorsements will be published to
morrow. along with fee assessment en
dorsements.
Jeff Bradich — Bradich has shown an
unusual ability to gain an understanding of
the University and the ASSU as a
freshman. He understands the possibilities
the senate has in recruiting incoming stu
dents to become involved, and he has a
solid platform of issues he would see
brought to the senate's attention next year.
Sherilvn Gilbert — Gilbert has consid
erable committee experience (including
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies)

and we think her demonstrated ability to
deal with the administration will help make
her an effective senator.
Sue Goldfarh — Goldfarb has' covered
the ASSU for the Daily and she has de
veloped a good understanding of its work
ings. She is especially concerned with
working through the Career Planning and
Placement Center in order to develop job
opportunities for liberal arts majors.
John Kinney — involved in a lot of stu
dent organizing, including the current pres
idency of the Inter-Fraternity Council,
Kinney is concerned with expanding ex
tradepartmental course offerings to in
clude practical instruction and has shown a
dedication to accomplishing things, not
just talking about them. He has also noted
increased alcohol awareness as one of his
concerns.
Bobby Lapin — Lapin has the ability to
be a very dynamic organizer, and he is very
aware that historically the senate has been
in dire need of organizational ability. We
think Lapin would be especially valuable
on senate committees, where effective
work needs to be done in order to increase
the senate's efficiency.
Michael O'Reilly — O'Reilly is an
employee of the Academic Information
Center, and he has also previously served
as ASSU elections commissioner. Because
of his valuable experience, O'Reilly is
realistic about the senate's role and thus
can be a more effective senator.
Kellev Raftery — a refreshing exception
in a field of candidates who often spout
tired, worn-out issues and propose no crea
tive solutions, some of her ideas include
strengthening the ASSU Consumer Affairs
Bureau and creating a "minority liaison
officer" for the senate to deal with
minorities' concerns. She has the concep
tion and drive to follow through with her
ideas.
Eve Rodler — someone who will work
on the publication of an on-campus-job
directory for students and the formulation
of a women's studies program. She is know
ledgeable about the ASSU and realistic
about the potential the senate has.
Rex Sharp — Sharp is a transfer student
who has had previous experience with stu
dent government at the University of Ok
lahoma. Sharp has a different perspective
than the typical senate candidate, and he
manages to avoid much of the shop-worn
rhetoric of other candidates.
