## Britt calls nuclear energy, draft sexist 
### Jill Liscom Kathleen McClung Staff Writers 
Gay rights, nuclear power and draft registration
are all issues related to sexism. San Francisco Super
\ isor Harry Britt said at a gav rights rally in White
Plaza yesterday.
"The more I deal with politicians, the more 1 see
that what the gay movement is about is a whole lot
more than gay rights. It involves making some rather
heavy changes in our society that go way beyond gay
rights or any other kind of rights," Britt told the
applauding crowd.
If gay people are going to accomplish anything, it
will be through the creation of a non-sexist society, he
continued. There can never be gay rights, an end to
nuclear power, or prevention of a military draft "until
we take the leadership in doing something about
sexism," he said.
Britt said that "although I can't articulate about it,
I know it's true" that there is something about nuc
lear power and "knowing that eventually it can go
boom" that makes it "profoundly male and pro
foundly sexist."

Solar energy, on the other hand, is "very loving,
very human, very female, and may 1 say. very gay."
Attacking President Jimmy Carter's draft registra
tion proposal, Britt said, "the draft is the natural,
normal and correct thing to do if you happen to he
Jimmy Carter," because Carter was educated at the
U.S. Naval Academy. Britt described Annapolis as a
place where "when you have problems, you stick
your tummy in, stick your chest out. forget you have
feelings, and you attack."
Britt added that the gay community must "develop
more human and rational ways to respond to crisis."
According to Britt, the fundamental political prob
lem gays must deal with is the situation of parents
forcing their little boys to grow up and become "a
strong daddy" and forcing their little girls to grow up
and "sell themselves" to men.
Because "the last thing you want to do is to chal
lenge your mommy and daddy's sexism," Britt said,
young gay people end up trvi ng to conform and trying
to accommodate to the existing power structure.
"1 believe that the wonderful thing about being gay
in the '<X()s is that we have had to deal with sexism in a

very powerful society, and we have learned that ac
commodation to sexism does not work for us," Britt
added.
Based on their history of struggle to develop a
sense of identity and fight society's sexism, gay
people must "take the responsibility and show the
way to a truly free and natural and non-perverted
society," Britt concluded.
Also speaking at the Gay Awareness Week rally
were Patricia Brandt, assistant director of the Office
of Student Activities here, and Constance Carpenter,
co-chair of the Santa Clara County Commission on
Human Rights.
Brandt spoke of the importance of developing
"non-oppressive relationships" within the University
and of making "a personal commitment to he iden
tified with gays hy challenging anti-gay comments."
Carpenter urged listeners to show active support
for a county ordinance on the ballot which prohibits
discrimination in housing and employment on the
basis of sexual orientation. This measure is vital be
cause "gay people do not have the legal protection
that racial minorities do," she said.
