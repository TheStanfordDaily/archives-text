## Kent State shots 'shook the nation' 
### 
This Sunday will mark the pas
sing of 10 years sinee the killing
of four undergraduates by Ohio
National Guardsmen at Kent
State University. It is difficult
today to sense the intensity of
feeling about cause and country
aroused by those events long
ago. And yet. as the days of
spring sprint toward May. the
memory of those days and those
deaths is stirred.
The tragedy is now quietly re
corded in pages of history. Kent
State, like hundreds of campuses
that would later form the "strike
network." was in the process of
reacting to the decision of Presi
dent Richard Nixon to send
Americans soldiers stationed in
Vietnam into Cambodia. The
announcement on April 30
triggered anti-war organizing the
following weekend culminating,
at Kent State, in an announce
ment of a noon protest on the
Kent State commons, o May 4.
The National Guard.

exhausted from quieting a
wildcat labor strike in Akron,
had been summoned to
the campus by Governor
James Rhodes, against the
wishes of the college president.
As the noon hour approached,
the assembling students were or
dered to disperse. A volley of
tear gas, a flurry of rock throw
ing, and then the Guard opened
fire. In 13 seconds 61 shots were
fired. Four persons were killed,
none wounded.
Those killed represented a
cross-section of college students.
One was a fraternity member;
another, an ROTC cadet; the
third intended to become a
speech therapist; the fourth was
a freshman honors student.
None was actively involved in
organizing the protest. Some had
wandered down to watch —
perhaps in hindsight, to be wit
nesses to — the times of their
lives.
Ten days later, the plague of
violence of 1970 would spread

south, to the Jackson State Uni
versity campus in Mississippi.
There, two black youths were
gunned down by highway pat
rolmen at a women's campus
dormitory. An FBI investigation
would later show that nearly 400
bullets or pieces of buckshot
struck the dormitory.
One can recount those days by
viewing them in the larger histor
ical context. Civilian killings in a
political context in this country
are not altogether rare: they in
clude the death of three civil
rights workers in 1964, the slay
ing of black students at Oranges
burg University and Southern
University, the killing at
People's Park in Berkeley and
the bombing death at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin.
Yet. the Kent State killings
shook the nation in an original
way. It was as though the streak
of violence in our culture had
veered the rifle site away from
political leaders or racial
minorities, directing its dis
charge point-blank into the gut
of middle-class America.
That summer, the President's
Commission on Campus Unrest
would report: "We are now in
grave danger of losing what is
common among us through
growing intolerance of opposing
views on issues and diversity it
self."
I was a college freshman when
those shots rangout, and the chill
of the Kent State deaths resides
with me still. If middle class kids
were dying in this nation — and
for what reason — what could
my life come to in this society?
The commission said, "A nation
that has lost the allegiance of
part of its youth is a nation that
lost part of its future."
The reaction of campus lead
ers in the wake of the shootings
was to call a halt to "business as
usual:" suspend classes, attend

teach-ins, write letters to alumni
to explain the reasons for the
strike and the need to stop the
war. Ultimately, there was en
couragement to travel to
Washington to meet with anyone
who might help end the war and
restore a regime of morality to a
nation that had slumped into a
spiritual malaise.
That was 10 years ago. Today
when we speak of malaise, we
have in mind inflation, un
employment or a lack of un
leaded gasoline to maintain a
certain style of life. We look
back, and the momentarily
catastrophic fades into the larger
mosaic. The president ana vice
president of the day both res
igned from office in disgrace, and
ultimately we did get out of that
war.
Still, the memory of Kent
State lives on. It is a catch-word
for a time of violence and lost
hopes, an example of how moral
bankruptcy can be more devas
tating to the human spirit than
double-digit inflation. May 4 is a
watch night of spiritual loss and
how we came to understand what
we had lost.
For leaders of communities,
the lesson is less metaphysical.
When a leader, whether mayor
of a town or a university presi
dent, permits militia carrying live
ammunition to clear a distur
bance, the preconditions for
tragic use of force are set in
place. For those who live in the
community, Kent State can be a
way to remember the predicates
for violence and to reflect on
how to avoid them.

of four undergraduates by Ohio
National Guardsmen at Kent
State University. It is difficult
today to sense the intensity of
feeling about cause and country
aroused by those events long
ago. And yet. as the days of
spring sprint toward May. the
memory of those days and those
deaths is stirred.
The tragedy is now quietly re
corded in pages of history. Kent
State, like hundreds of campuses
that would later form the "strike
network." was in the process of
reacting to the decision of Presi
dent Richard Nixon to send
Americans soldiers stationed in
Vietnam into Cambodia. The
announcement on April 30
triggered anti-war organizing the
following weekend culminating,
at Kent State, in an announce
ment of a noon protest on the
Kent State commons, o May 4.
The National Guard.

exhausted from quieting a
wildcat labor strike in Akron,
had been summoned to
the campus by Governor
James Rhodes, against the
wishes of the college president.
As the noon hour approached,
the assembling students were or
dered to disperse. A volley of
tear gas, a flurry of rock throw
ing, and then the Guard opened
fire. In 13 seconds 61 shots were
fired. Four persons were killed,
none wounded.
Those killed represented a
cross-section of college students.
One was a fraternity member;
another, an ROTC cadet; the
third intended to become a
speech therapist; the fourth was
a freshman honors student.
None was actively involved in
organizing the protest. Some had
wandered down to watch —
perhaps in hindsight, to be wit
nesses to — the times of their
lives.
Ten days later, the plague of
violence of 1970 would spread

south, to the Jackson State Uni
versity campus in Mississippi.
There, two black youths were
gunned down by highway pat
rolmen at a women's campus
dormitory. An FBI investigation
would later show that nearly 400
bullets or pieces of buckshot
struck the dormitory.
One can recount those days by
viewing them in the larger histor
ical context. Civilian killings in a
political context in this country
are not altogether rare: they in
clude the death of three civil
rights workers in 1964, the slay
ing of black students at Oranges
burg University and Southern
University, the killing at
People's Park in Berkeley and
the bombing death at the Uni
versity of Wisconsin.
Yet. the Kent State killings
shook the nation in an original
way. It was as though the streak
of violence in our culture had
veered the rifle site away from
political leaders or racial
minorities, directing its dis
charge point-blank into the gut
of middle-class America.
That summer, the President's
Commission on Campus Unrest
would report: "We are now in
grave danger of losing what is
common among us through
growing intolerance of opposing
views on issues and diversity it
self."
I was a college freshman when
those shots rangout, and the chill
of the Kent State deaths resides
with me still. If middle class kids
were dying in this nation — and
for what reason — what could
my life come to in this society?
The commission said, "A nation
that has lost the allegiance of
part of its youth is a nation that
lost part of its future."
The reaction of campus lead
ers in the wake of the shootings
was to call a halt to "business as
usual:" suspend classes, attend

teach-ins, write letters to alumni
to explain the reasons for the
strike and the need to stop the
war. Ultimately, there was en
couragement to travel to
Washington to meet with anyone
who might help end the war and
restore a regime of morality to a
nation that had slumped into a
spiritual malaise.
That was 10 years ago. Today
when we speak of malaise, we
have in mind inflation, un
employment or a lack of un
leaded gasoline to maintain a
certain style of life. We look
back, and the momentarily
catastrophic fades into the larger
mosaic. The president ana vice
president of the day both res
igned from office in disgrace, and
ultimately we did get out of that
war.
Still, the memory of Kent
State lives on. It is a catch-word
for a time of violence and lost
hopes, an example of how moral
bankruptcy can be more devas
tating to the human spirit than
double-digit inflation. May 4 is a
watch night of spiritual loss and
how we came to understand what
we had lost.
For leaders of communities,
the lesson is less metaphysical.
When a leader, whether mayor
of a town or a university presi
dent, permits militia carrying live
ammunition to clear a distur
bance, the preconditions for
tragic use of force are set in
place. For those who live in the
community, Kent State can be a
way to remember the predicates
for violence and to reflect on
how to avoid them.
