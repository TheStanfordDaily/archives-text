# Friday Forum:
## 
### 
Are Stanford's fraternities re
ally "different" from those at
other schools? Do sororities de
serve University recognition on
the basis of Title IX? Has the
Greek system "cleaned up" its
record of injustices? Or are the
groups a negative contribution to
the Stanford experience? Do
they contribute to elitism at an
already elite institution? Would

we all be better off without
them?
