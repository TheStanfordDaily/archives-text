# Libertarian's ideas 'nonsensical'
## 
### 
I can't take it anymore. I must
join my fellow Daily columnist
John Mason in protesting the re
curring inanities of the vocal and
aggressive Stanford Liberta
rians. Although certain liberta
rian ideas seem interesting and
worthy of discussion, the mem
bers of the group (if we are to
judge by those who write in the
Daily) argue with all the flexibil
ity and subtlety of people who
are convinced they have just dis
covered God's truth. As a result,
time after time we are treated to
dogmatic expositions supporting
positions that are often patently
nonsensical.
A fine example of libertarian
argument is a column that ap
peared in the April 17 Daily enti

tled "End Big Business Regula
tion," written by Rick Forberg
and Chuck Olsen. Citing the be
nefits of the nearly "unham
pered market system" of the
19th-century American
economy, the authors urge an
end to government regulation,
presumably so that we may re
turn to an expanding and com
petitive economy.
Let's start by considering
some of the benefits of the " 19-
th century American economy"
(whatever that is, since the
economy was vastly different in
1810 or even 1850 than in
1890). "The people," write For
berg and Olsen. "saved and in
vested" for they were "secure in
the knowledge the fruits of their
investments would he safe from
confiscation."
What "people" were those, I
wonder? The immigrants packed
into urban tenements with open
sewers? The slaves? The child
laborers who made up 40 per
cent of the Massachusetts labor
force at mid-century? I wish the
authors had told us what percen
tage of the population was living
in grinding poverty so that "the
people" might feel secure when
they invested their money.
"To be sure," admit Forbert
and Olsen, "much injustice was
present." It sure was. In 1851,
Horace Greeley calculated the
amount a family would need to
survive and then found that the
common laborer made half that
amount. During the recurring
depressions that marked the
19th century, whole families
starved and froze to death in the
cities. Yet Forberg and Olsen
cite this period as exemplary of
the benefits of the free market
system.
The authors then offer to take
us even further into fantasyland

with the suggestion that the in
justices of that period were due
to "the absence of a well
enforced common law of strict
liability . . . and the failure to
treat all individuals as equal
under the law." This makes as
much sense as arguing that if we
only had the right laws, inflation,
stagnating productivity and
Third World poverty could be
removed from today's economic
system. In fact, using such
reasoning, any economic system

could be defended as the ideal.
The positive aspects of the
19th-century economy cannot
be separated from the abuses of
slavery, recurrent depressions,
starvation wages, and all the rest,
for that economy was built on
those abuses. If Forberg and
Olsen want to make a historical
argument, they should use his
tory, not fairy tales.
Another little problem with
their column is that their conclu
sion — government regulation of
business should be ended —
doesn't follow from their pre
mises. They assert that corporate
influence on government is
harmful: I can buy that. They as
sert that the military establish
ment grows and prospers be
cause of an interlocking relation
ship with big business. That
sounds plausible. They then con
clude that regulation of the type

advocated by Ralph Nader must
ho halted. Huh?
I guess they want their readers
to assume that representatives of
consumer groups are somehow
the same as representatives of
the Pentagon. Perhaps some sec
ret knowledge available only to
libertarians allows them to see
this connection, but I'm not con
vinced.
The really maddening thing
about libertarians is, as I said,
that there seem to be some good

ideas in there somewhere. Grea
ter personal liberty, decentrali
zation and elimination of gov
ernmental bureaucracy, and an
opposition to militarism are ad
mirable goals. But why do they
stick so dogmatically to the ab
surd principle that the power
wielded by money is legitimate
while the power wielded by polit
ical groups is not?
As a friend of mine recently
expressed it,"The basic princi
ple of libertarianism seems to be
that if a bunch of rich people get
together to make money, that's
liberty, but if a bunch of poor
people get together to protect
their rights, that's tyranny."
