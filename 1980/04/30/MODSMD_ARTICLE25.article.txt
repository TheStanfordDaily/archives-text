## Gay relations too uptight 
### 
Blueboy is what we call him. All we know about
him is that he usually wears blue. We sec him
almost every night at the library. He stares at us; we
stare at him. That's all. He knows we're gay and he
apparently jokes with his friends about us, but he
keeps walking by us. We don't know what he
wants, and he doesn't know what we want.
The Beta Nooner was great. There was good
music playing and I felt like dancing. The girls were
all taken. I asked the gay man I was with to dance,
but he just laughed. Then 1 saw all these cute boys
standing around, some of them looking like they
might want to dance, and I thought to myself "why
not?" As 1 thought more about frat boys, though,
things started coming to mind like broken bones
and lonely nights spent recuperating in a hospital. I
left without dancing.
I participate in speaking programs in dorms. We
go to a dorm and talk for an hour or so about what
it's like to be gay. The dialogue is very personal and
open, and we answer any question put to us. I enjoy
the contact with people, but when I see them later I
never know how to act. 11 seems I can't say hello or
even notice them without making them nervous.
These are just three examples of strained gay/
straight relations. I don't think most straight
people realize how much our day-to-day social
interaction and our standards of acceptable be
havior are geared toward straights. Straight men
have the option of talking to girls they don't know,
asking them out — whatever. The girls may get
angry, but that just means the guy came on too
strong, that he was going too fast. If I had asked one
of those boys at the Nooner to dance, it would have
been much more than coming on too strong.
Most of my gay friends think that straights have
to be handled with great care. If you're attracted to a
man, you try to get to know him as a friend. Then
you find out his feelings toward gays, and if you get
a positive response you carefully tell him that
you're gay. Then after a few more months you
•night actually hint that you find him attractive.

Heaven forbid that this process should be rushed,
that one should let a stranger know he's attractive,
especially since we assume that people are straight
unless otherwise declared.
I agree to a certain extent. I've never been one to
camp it up, to shock straights just for the sake of
shocking straights. I never assume, though, that a
person is straight. I also see no harm in answering
the bright, California smiles all the Stanford men
seem to wear with another smile and maybe a hello,
just to say that I find them attractive. I don't con
sider this tantamount to propositioning them; I
consider it a compliment. I low they choose to deal
with it is another matter, but I hope that they
wouldn't become nervous or angry.
I have several objections to the kid-gloves ap
proach to provisionally straight men (that is, men
who are not known to be gay, and therefore
thought to be straight). For one thing, it keeps alive
a hope that maybe after months of proper condi
tioning one of those boys might turn out to be
interested. I find many gays on campus (including
myself) are continually infatuated with people who
as far as we know are straight, but we find it impos
sible to tell them so. Hi is is not good for either side.
Another problem I have with this approach is
that it is just not fair. If boys can tell girls that
they re interested, and girls can tell boys, why can't
I tell a boy that I'm interested in him? I'm just
asking tor the right to wink at a cute boy in public
without tearing for my life or risking an unpleasant
scene. I don't think that's too much to ask for.
Stanford is much too uptight, and I think it's time
that we loosened up a bit. I don't mean to imply
that straight men are at fault. I would say that at
least halt of the problem is my own, imagining
prejudice and lack of understanding where it
doesn't exist. So I'll work on my half, but I expect
the rest of you to work on yours.
