# Biographer reveals personal goals
## Woolf's nephew is a reluctant critic 
### Beth Harrison Staff Writer 
Claiming ;t "high and difficult
ambition" to tell the truth.
Quentin Bell, biographer and
nephew of Virginia Woolf, ad
dressed a large attentive audi
ence here last Wednesday night
in Jordan Hall He revealed his
personal goals as a biographer, a
reluctant critic, and his intimate
observations of "that curious
phenomenon" Bloomsbury.
v The position of a literary biog
rapher is an impossible ideal to
achieve, Bell said, because one
must be committed to fact as well
as attempting criticism. And
criticism. Bell said, involves the
kinds of truths that a historian
views as "no more than flowers
which may blossom tomorrow
but die tomorrow evening."
Consequently, Bell said he has
"steered clear" of criticism, hop
ing to achieve instead "a usable
history" by recording the life ol
Virginia Wool! and her
Bloomsbury companions.
Popular image
Bell discounted the popular
images the public holds of
Woolf, which tend to "remodel
history a little closer to heart's
desire." Twenty years ago, he
said, people believed she was a
"limp and languid lady perched
upon a sofa, exquisitely upper
class." This fragile picture ol her

contains an element of truth Bell
admitted, for she was often ill,
but her life of luxury was essen
tially apocryphal.
Today people hold a reverse
opinion of her as an activist, a
"strident women's leader." Bell
conceded that she had feminist
inclinations but overall, Woolf
was not "an organizing woman"
and her suffragette friends were
largely from outside the
Bloomsbury circle.
Who is the real Virginia
Woolt? Bell challenged the au
dience. He answered his own
question saying that there can be
110 coherent or true picture of her
life. "Like most of us," Bell said,
"she was inconsistent, change
able. inconstant." She cannot be
"typed."
The best way to learn more
about Virginia Woolf is to "go
back to the documents," Bell
said.
Bloomsbury
Bloomsbury is even more
enigmatic according to Bell. In
fact it is a nearly meaningless
term, a journalist's phrase used
to describe a "group of friends,
peculiar to its time" because of
its political and philosophical
ideas.
11 contained some famous per
sonages, Bell said, like Woolf
herself. Keynes. Strachey. Roger
I rv, and on the outskirts E.M.

Forster, but it also harbored
some people important to the
group and unknown to the out
side world.
Having " no doctrine, no rules,
no formal being," Bell explained
that the group was "united by
friendship and a leu generally
accepted ideas â€” the importance
of rationality, and a left-wing
stance in politics."
Journalists often accused the
group of being snobbish or trivial
and m;.Je wide generalizations
about it without considering the
individual members. But studies
of Bloomsbury have been sub
stantially accurate, although
thoughtless. Bell said.
Elusive
Despite the growing interest in
Bloomsbury, it remains elusive.
Bell said. At one point he com
pared the nature of the group to
the Chesire cat in Alice in Won
derland: a discombobulated
head, "a grin in thin air."
How did Bloomsbury affect
Virginia Wool! and her writing?
Bell said that he had no concrete
answer to this question.
He described a schism that oc
curred in the group between the
political writers who chose com
prehensible, simple writing for
their persuasions, and the artists
who were absorbed by "moder
nism" or a break-up of old

forms.
Revolutionary
Woolf followed the moder
nists in her novel writing,
employing a style neither strictly
prosaic nor strictly poetic. Bell
said. She was a " revolutionary,"
lie elaborated, and like most re
volutionaries. "sometimes very
hard to understand."
This similarity of form bet
ween Woolf and the artistic fac
tion of Bloomshury is interesting
Bell said.but not definitive. It is
up to the literary critics to de
termine the importance ot the
connection.
Overall. Bell said,
Bloomshury served as a group of
people on whom Woolf could
"sharpen her intellect." Al
though she might be highly mali
scious to her friends at times.
Bell said, she was nevertheless,
"bound to them by ties of
enormous and irrefrangible sol
idity." and these bonds were ex
tremely important to Woolfs
life.
As an aloof biographer. Bell
offered the audience a detailed
portrayal of the lives and
thoughts of Woolf and her con
temporaries.
Bel 1 is currently touring the
U.S. trying to raise funds for her
parent's home, Charleston, one
of Bloomsbury's main gathering
places.
