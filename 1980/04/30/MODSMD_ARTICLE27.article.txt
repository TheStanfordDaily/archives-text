# County judge overrules Warsaw air convention
## 
### Benjamin Weiser The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON —For 51
years the Warsaw Conven
tion, the treaty that governs
liability in international air
travel, has survived wars, jet
planes and changing world
politics.
Then, two and one-half
weeks ago in a sleepy cour
troom in Upper Marlboro,
Md., it ran into Judge Louis
DeTrani.
Angered when Air India, in
his view, did not adequately
compensate a College Park.
Md., couple for losing their
baggage, DiTrani, a county
district court judge — the
lowest ranking judge in Mary
land — declared the treaty to
be unconstitutional.
Air India, he said, should
have paid the couple accord
ing to the true value of their
luggage, not simply $20 per
kilo, as the« Warsaw Conven
tion prescribes. So he ordered
the airline to pay the couple
$2000 — nearly 10 times
what it had originally prop
osed — and then directed a
few pointed remarks in the di
rection of the airline's high
priced lawyers.
"I dread to think." said
Judge DiTrani. "that an air
line has the privilege to just

toss out your bag, help them
selves to what they want, ship
your empty bag . . . and then
treat you like a complete nin
compoop."
Alarmed federal officials
arc watching the ease closely,
and a Justice Department
spokesman said the depart
ment's civil division would
"certainly" enter the case on
Air India's behalf if there is
an appeal.
The case began three years
ago when Henry Eifert. a Col
lege Park builder, and his
wife, Joan, flew to London on
a business trip and. upon arri
val. discovered that their bag
gage had been lost. Later
some of the bags were found,
but much of the contents was
missing.
Among the missing items
were some important docu
ments needed to complete a
multimillion-dollar deal.
Without the documents.
Eifert claimed the deal fell
through. His wife also lost a
lot of expensive clothing.
When the Eiferts filed a
claim with Air India, the air
line agreed to pay according
to the weight of the missing
baggage — a sum amounting
to about $200. The couple did
not think it was enough, so
they decided to go to court.

Air India's attorneys ar
gued that the Eiferts had been
adequately compensated
under the terms of the War
saw Convention, the often
challenged treaty that limits
the amount of money an air
line must pay survivors of
crashes or passengers who
' nc their luggage. They
pointed out that the conven
tion is a longstanding agree
ment — enacted in 1 929 and
signed by 100 nations— and
that its terms are spelled out
on the back of every interna
tional airline ticket.
DiTrani was not impressed.
He said the airline should
either change its method of
compensation, or give pas
sengers better warning.
"It may be tin the ticket,"
he said, "and that may be the
law between nations, but I
don't think that you can take
from the constitutional rights,
of individuals.'"
He then proceeded to
award the Eiferts $2000 —
nearly 10 times what the air
line had offered.
He said that he did not
think a "normal, average pas
senger would understand
what the Warsaw Convention
is about. Indeed, most
Americans don't understand
what a kilo weight is."
