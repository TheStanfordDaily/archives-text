# Schonert, Evans, Rennaker wait for today's results
## Andre Hines drafted in NFL's 2nd round 
### Mike Oneal Sports Editor 
Two years ago it someone had
told von that Andre Hines would
be picked in the second round of
the 19S0 NFI draft, you proba
bly would have thought the
6-foot-6, 250 pound offensive
tackle had stepped on the guy's
head or something. And Hines
would have probably tried to
remember if he had.
But true to form, this year's
draft was as unpredictable as
ever and Hines was picked 45th
by the Seattle Seahawks.
Hines was virtually born again
on the Farm last year after a fine
career at St. Mary's prep high
school in Oakland. I le sat on the
bench for three years at Stanford
but finally pulled it together last
spring, earning a starting spot on
the '79 squad.
He had an outstanding season
but the fact that he was picked so
high this year is remarkable.
"1 didn't really expect to be
drafted so high." Hines said yes
terday. "But I was told earlier
that some very important people
in the NFL said 1 would go by the
third round. I expected that I
would go in the middle rounds.
"Right now." he added with a
smile. "I'm tickled pink."
The portion of the draft yes

terday held its usual share of sur
prises. defying most predictions.
Detroit took Billy Sims with its
No. 1 pick, which surprised no
one. but San Francisco, which
traded away its No. 2 pick to the
Jets for a pair of first round
choices, shocked everyone by
passing up Mark Wilson from
Brigham Young with their No.
13 selection. The word before
yesterday was that the
would pick Wilson second. Oak
land nabbed him sixteenth after
an on-the-spot decision.
Charles White, this year's
Hcisman Trophy recipient, was
the next to last pick of the first
round by Cleveland.
From Stanford, Hines was the
only player taken during the first
five rounds of drafting held yes
terday. lurk Schonert. Chuck
I \ans and Terry Rennaker, the
other probable draftees, could
only hope for better results to
day.
"I was shocked when they cal
led this morning," Hines said
yesterday. "They called my
agent too and I talked to him. I
feel fantastic — but it hasn't re
ally sunk in yet."
Hines had been in contact with
the Seahawks for some time but
figured, like everyone else, that
thev would be looking to

strengthen their defense in the
first rounds.
"I only started at Stanford for
one year," Hines said."so I don't
know how soon I'll play. I'm sure
I have a lot of things to learn. But
being picked in the second round
was a boost I need that kind ol
support.
"Any time you take another
step in something like football,
you wonder 1 if you're good
enough. It's "time to dig down
again.'*
Schonert, Evans and Re
nnaker all had to wait for today,
but after the results were in yes
terday, none of them sounded
too worried.
Schonert. who won the NCAA
passing title last season after sit
ting out at Stanford for four
years, said, "I didn't know what
would happen today — you
never know. A couple of quar
terbacks were picked ahead of
me and I thought I would be
picked ahead of them and that
disappointed me a little. But I
just want to get a chance to play
for a team. 111 go tomorrow or go
as a free agent. I know 1 can help
a team out."
Evans echoed Schonert.
"You never can tell what will
happen." last season's defensive
leader said. "I don't feel bad

about not going on the first day.
Hey, if a guy can play, he can
play and it doesn't matter if he
goes later in the draft or as a free
agent. But I'd be foolish not to
give it a try after I've played for
so long. I'd be a little surprised if
I wasn't picked, though."
In the same vein, Rennaker
said, "You never know what to

expect with the draft I'M go as a
free agent if it docsn'«t happen
(today). I've got other things to
do though, so I'm not that wor
ried. I'm a mechanical engineer.
"I've been in contact with
some teams and I want to play
football. I'll find out what hap
pens between K (a.m.) and noon
tomorrow."

disappointed me a little. But I
just want to get a chance to play
for a team. 111 go tomorrow or go
as a free agent. I know 1 can help
a team out."
Evans echoed Schonert.
"You never can tell what will
happen." last season's defensive
leader said. "I don't feel bad

about not going on the first day.
Hey, if a guy can play, he can
play and it doesn't matter if he
goes later in the draft or as a free
agent. But I'd be foolish not to
give it a try after I've played for
so long. I'd be a little surprised if
I wasn't picked, though."
In the same vein, Rennaker
said, "You never know what to

expect with the draft I'M go as a
free agent if it docsn'«t happen
(today). I've got other things to
do though, so I'm not that wor
ried. I'm a mechanical engineer.
"I've been in contact with
some teams and I want to play
football. I'll find out what hap
pens between K (a.m.) and noon
tomorrow."

\ndre Hines
Two years ago it someone had
told von that Andre Hines would
be picked in the second round of
the 19S0 NFI draft, you proba
bly would have thought the
6-foot-6, 250 pound offensive
tackle had stepped on the guy's
head or something. And Hines
would have probably tried to
remember if he had.
But true to form, this year's
draft was as unpredictable as
ever and Hines was picked 45th
by the Seattle Seahawks.
Hines was virtually born again
on the Farm last year after a fine
career at St. Mary's prep high
school in Oakland. I le sat on the
bench for three years at Stanford
but finally pulled it together last
spring, earning a starting spot on
the '79 squad.
He had an outstanding season
but the fact that he was picked so
high this year is remarkable.
"1 didn't really expect to be
drafted so high." Hines said yes
terday. "But I was told earlier
that some very important people
in the NFL said 1 would go by the
third round. I expected that I
would go in the middle rounds.
"Right now." he added with a
smile. "I'm tickled pink."
The portion of the draft yes

terday held its usual share of sur
prises. defying most predictions.
Detroit took Billy Sims with its
No. 1 pick, which surprised no
one. but San Francisco, which
traded away its No. 2 pick to the
Jets for a pair of first round
choices, shocked everyone by
passing up Mark Wilson from
Brigham Young with their No.
13 selection. The word before
yesterday was that the
would pick Wilson second. Oak
land nabbed him sixteenth after
an on-the-spot decision.
Charles White, this year's
Hcisman Trophy recipient, was
the next to last pick of the first
round by Cleveland.
From Stanford, Hines was the
only player taken during the first
five rounds of drafting held yes
terday. lurk Schonert. Chuck
I \ans and Terry Rennaker, the
other probable draftees, could
only hope for better results to
day.
"I was shocked when they cal
led this morning," Hines said
yesterday. "They called my
agent too and I talked to him. I
feel fantastic — but it hasn't re
ally sunk in yet."
Hines had been in contact with
the Seahawks for some time but
figured, like everyone else, that
thev would be looking to

strengthen their defense in the
first rounds.
"I only started at Stanford for
one year," Hines said."so I don't
know how soon I'll play. I'm sure
I have a lot of things to learn. But
being picked in the second round
was a boost I need that kind ol
support.
"Any time you take another
step in something like football,
you wonder 1 if you're good
enough. It's "time to dig down
again.'*
Schonert, Evans and Re
nnaker all had to wait for today,
but after the results were in yes
terday, none of them sounded
too worried.
Schonert. who won the NCAA
passing title last season after sit
ting out at Stanford for four
years, said, "I didn't know what
would happen today — you
never know. A couple of quar
terbacks were picked ahead of
me and I thought I would be
picked ahead of them and that
disappointed me a little. But I
just want to get a chance to play
for a team. 111 go tomorrow or go
as a free agent. I know 1 can help
