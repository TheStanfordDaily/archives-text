The tennis was loose, tempers were short, and the
lineup was without No. I player Peter Rennert. but the
Cards still managed to whip the Spartans from San Jose
State 9-0. extending the No. I rated Cardinals season
record to 14-2.
The feature match lor the day pitted Stanford's Tim
Mayotte against the Spartans Nial Brash, who earlier in
the season handed Rennert his only loss. And for a
while, it looked as though Brash would continue his
winning ways as he jumped to a 6-3 first set lead. But
Mayotte began putting his powerful serve-volley game
together in the second set as he breezed to a 6-2 win.
setting up an exciting third set which Mayotte pulled out
h-4. In the final set Mayotte took advantage of two
double faults by Brash on no ad points to hold a 5-3 lead,
only to relinquish his own serve allowing Brash to serve
to tie the match. But Mayotte broke serve for the third
time on a no ad point as Brash netted an overhead
following a precision lob by Mayotte.

Other highlights for Stanford included a 6-4,6-4 win
by Lloyd Bourne over a scrappy Paul Batten, and a
"double bagel job" by freshman Jim Gurfein over the
Spartan's Jeff Ev erist, 6-0,6-0. Stanford's No. 3 doubles
team ot Dave Siegler and Scott Bondurant, playing in
the No. 1 spot, also scored an impressive victory with a
6-2,6-2 rout over Brash and Batten, a team which li
gures to be a factor in the NCAA's.
"With the exception of Gurfein's play, the team was
not razor sharp today, but 1 still have to be happy with a
9-0 victory," said head coach Dick Gould. "Especially
considering we were playing without Peter. It was nice to
come back after two first-set losses in the singles, and I
was pleased to sweep the doubles."
Rennert has been sidelined the last five days with a
back injury which he aggravated in his match with Tony
Giamalva of Trinity. He is expected to see some action
this weekend as the Cards travel to Arizona to take on
the Sun Devils and the Wild Cats.
