# Netwomen return from Ojai Invite
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
Caryn Copeland lost in the
semi-finals of the women's invi
tational division of the Ojai
Tournament last weekend and
Gayle Chan and Julia Leighton
were ousted in the semi-finals of
the college division doubles to
finish the individual play of Stan
ford women in the tournament.
No team totals were kept.
Stanford Coach I rank Bren
nan was pleased with the play of
Copeland and his number three
doubles team of Chan and
Leighton.
Copeland had defeated Shan
non Gordon and Lee An
tonopolis before losing Tim
Mochizucki 6-4.7-5 in the semi's
and Chan and Leighton had pro
duced several upsets before
being beaten by Ann White and
Anna Lucia Fernandez of USC.
"Caryn played better than she
has all year," said Brennan. "She
beat Antonopolis 6-2,6-2 in her

best match all year. Antonopolis
has been a pro for about four
years and has been doing pretty
well.
"She really had a tough next
round. though. Against
Mochizucki she didn't play as
well, but she still played pretty
well. Mochizucki then went on
and lost a really tough match in
the final to Kelly Henry."
Chan and Gordon breezed
through two earlier matches and
then overwhelmed Arizona
State's No. I doubles team of
Ann Lebedeff and Jane Klinga
man in straight sets to advance to
the semi's, before being beaten
by the tough USC tandem.
"Leighton and Chan did quite
well. They beat ASU's No. 1
doubles team in straight sets
which made me real happy be
cause they are usually my No. 3
team."
Brennan was also pleased with
theplay of Sue Rasmussen in col
lege division singles.
"Sue did as well as could have
been expected. She won two
matches and was playing real
well until she met Trey Lewis n
the quarters. Trey beat her 6-2,
6-1 which isn't that much of a
surprise because Lewis is as good
as anyone around."
Stanford's other two players
didn't fare as well for varying
reasons.
The Card's top player. Alyeia
Moulton, reached the quarterfi
nals of college singles before
being upset 7-6. 6-0 by Micki
Schillig of Pepperdine and Stan
ford's No. 2 player. Donna Ru
bin. was still bothered by illness

and lost early.
"Alyeia didn't play particu
larly well. 1 think, in retrospect,
we should have left her home to
rest. She's just over-tennised.
She played fairly well and then in
her quarterfinal match she
jumped out to a 5-2 lead and
then only won one more game. It
wasn't her strokes or her play
ing. she just couldn't keep up her
concentration.
"Donna wasn't feeling real
great. She won a couple of

matches and then uas beaten by
Kelly Henry — the eventual
winner."
Stanford's next match is
Saturday afternoon at the varsity
courts against UCI A. The Cards
have beaten UCLA twice al
ready this season by the small
margin of 5-4. The Card's match
against Arizona State scheduled
for Monday has been cancelled
due to budget problems for the
Sun Devils.

larly well. 1 think, in retrospect,
we should have left her home to
rest. She's just over-tennised.
She played fairly well and then in
her quarterfinal match she
jumped out to a 5-2 lead and
then only won one more game. It

concentration.
"Donna wasn't feeling real
great. She won a couple of

matches and then uas beaten by
Kelly Henry — the eventual
winner."
Stanford's next match is
Saturday afternoon at the varsity
courts against UCI A. The Cards
have beaten UCLA twice al
ready this season by the small
margin of 5-4. The Card's match
against Arizona State scheduled
for Monday has been cancelled
due to budget problems for the
Sun Devils.
