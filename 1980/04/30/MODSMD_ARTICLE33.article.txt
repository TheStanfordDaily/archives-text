# Golfers prepare for key matches
## 
### Val Vaden Staff Writer 
After strong finishes in the
past two weeks, both the Stan
ford men's and women's golf
teams are looking forward to this
week's tournaments.
But they aren't resting on their
laurels or taking any breathers
since those tournaments are
coming up hard and fast.
The men take off today for the
Sun Devil Intercollegiate Tour
nament hosted by Arizona State
University in Phoenix. The tour
nament will continue through
Friday.
Even then they can't come
back to the Farm for a rest as
they head straight for the Pac-10
championships at Seattle on
Monday and Tuesday. That
tournament is hosted In the

University of Washington.
Men's coach David Yates is
very confident that his goiters
will do well in Phoenix. Last
week, he may have not been so
sure. The men. in his words, had
"started out slow." But then
came the Stanford Intercol
legiate. two weekends ago,
where the Cards won over what
Yates called, "a very, very strong
field."
"We did extremely well," said
Yates. "The finish put us right
back in the picture for our ulti
mate goal, the NCAA tourna
ment at Ohio State later in
May."
Yates predicted that "to reach
the NCAA's, we need to finish in
the top three or four places at
Arizona and Washington."
However, he noted that the Sun

Devil Intercollegiate would have
a "very, very tough field includ
ing Brigham Young, New
Mexico and 'a-Couple of Texas
schools." And the Pac-10
Championships are, after all the
championships.
Still, Yates and the men are
confident. "The tournaments are
going to be a tremendous grind
both mentally and physically,"
he said.
The key for the men, accord
ing to "Yates, is to get out front
early, much as they did at the
Stanford tournament.
The women, on the other
hand, have a little more time to
prime themselves for their next
tournament. But it is one for
which they will need to he very
primed.
The tournament in question is
the Northern California Athletic
Conference Championships to
be played here May 6 and 7.
While the field lor this tour
nament will only include 3 teams

— Stanford, Sacramento State
and San Jose State — the San
Jose women are unquestionably
among the best teams in the na
tion.
The Cards proved their worth
last February at a separate but
identical tournament to the
NorC'al Championships at Stan
ford. Alter the lull two days.
Stanford and San Jose State were
in a dead tie.
Asst. Sports Information Di
rector Chris Preiniesberger
noted that the women have con
tinued toplay \ ery well since that
"upset" tie.
He pointed specifically to this
past weekend when the women
traveled to Athens. Georgia for
the Southern Intercollegiate
Golf Tournament. which
Preiniesberger called, "the sec
ond most important tournament
of the year." I lie women
finished sixth in a field of 27
there.
But San Jose State was there
too. And they finished third.
