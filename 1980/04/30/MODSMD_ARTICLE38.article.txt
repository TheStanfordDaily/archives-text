Alfred Hitchcock dead at age 80
HOLLYWOOD — Sir Alfred Hitchcock, the master
motion picture director whose genius for the macabre chil
led the spines ot three generations of movie-goers, died
peacefully in his sleep yesterday at his home here. He was
SO years old.

career that spanned the same number of years.
Some of his best known movies were Psycho. The Birds,
Dial M for Murder, Rear Window and North by Northwest.
His 1940 film. Rebecca, was named best picture of the year,
but he never won an Oscar in his own name. In 1968,

Subcommittee approves draff funds
WASHINGTON — A Senate Appropriations subcom
mittee yesterday approved. 8 to 4. the $13.3 million re
quested by President Jimmy Carter to register 19- and
20-year-old males for a possible military draft.
The government could not draft young men into military
service without an act of Congress, and President Carter
told congressional leaders yesterday that he foresees no
need to ask Congress for power to resume the draft, which
was ended in 1973.
But one ot the arguments used by opponents is that
resumption of registration only would cause dissension and
widespread refusal to comply by young people, which either
would require prosecuting large numbers or exposing re
gistrations as a "hollow sham" if no attempt was made to
police it.

Hie argument for registration is that it would give the
defense establishment a head start on mobilizing an army in
time of erisis. Hut opponents eontend that registration alone
is meaningless without classification and some training, that
our adversaries realize this but that the United States will be
lulled into a false sense ol security when the Pentagon has
compiled a list of names. The Mouse approved the money
last week.

LOS ANGELES — Walter Cronkite says he isn't going
to be John Anderson's running mate in Anderson's inde
pendent drive tor the White House. Yesterday Cronkite put

magazine quoting Cronkite as saying the Illinois Republi
can congressman had not yet in\ ited him to run on the same
ticket.

Republic reporter has misinterpreted our com ersation," he

interest in entering politics in any capacity. I have never
endorsed a political candidate and I have no intention of
endorsing a political candidate in the upcoming campaign,
including Mr. Anderson."

Cronkite's statement, said the magazine stood by its report
as accurate.
