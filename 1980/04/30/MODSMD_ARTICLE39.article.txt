## 
### Sue Goldfarb Staff Writer 
Student desires for residence ser
\ ices will he reported to the University
now that an advisory board lias been
formed here.
The Residence Budget Advisory
Board, comprised of four students and
two resident fellows, is expected to
begin functioning in the fall, according
to Jason Mavis, director of service op
erations for the University.
"This is to advise me on the services
that students are most interested in re
ceiving. what takes priority for them,
what's good, what's bad, where they
think we should spend more dollars or
fewer dollars," Mavis said. "It's to help
un understand the students' desires in
the services they receive in housing."
In addition to the six voting mem
bers, three University officials will sit
on the board ex officio: Director of
Housing Management Ed Scoles, As
soc. Dean for Res. Ed. Norm Robinson
and Assoc. Director of Building
Maintenance Jim Horgan will assist the
board in reaching decisions.
According to ASSU Sen. Chris
Greene, who was among the students
who proposed the board, the residence
budget is self-contained.
"It's a module on a flow chart,"
Greene said. "Because it doesn't affect
other parts of the University, it gives
the students a more powerful posi
tion."
He said the board would determine
how operating costs work in relation to
program costs.
"There'll be overlap." Greene said.
"That'll be good, though. We'll be able
to communicate openly with COSS
(Committee on Student Services) and
COSS-R (Committee on Student Ser
vices Residence Division)."
The main distinction between the

board and COSS. another predomin
antly student committee, is that COSS
addresses programs while the hoard is
operations-oriented.
Among the issues Greene sees as
coming before the board are food ser
vice, whether the heat in the residences
is turned off too early or too late and
energy conservation questions.
"This committee has nothing to do
with dorm funds," Greene said. "This
committee would deal with major deci
sions that go into the budget and setting
the policy."
Mavis echoed Greene's feelings, say
ing "This has to do with nuts and bolts,
not programs.
"Our job is to try to facilitate student
desires as reported to us by the student
body representatives," he said. "What
we think students want is not always

what students want."
Student representation to the board
will be determined by the ASSU
Committee on Nominations. Applica
tions for the four positions, two of
which will be two-year terms, are avail
able in the ASSU office. They are due
Friday.
Mavis said he plans to write formally
James Lyons, dean of student affairs,
and request a list of resident fellows
who might be interested in serving on
the committee.
Although he admitted the commit
tee may not be instrumental for a
couple of years, Greene said, "Once
the policy starts to be set on how the
new dorm is going to run from an oper
ational standpoint, I'm sure this com
mittee will have a lot to say."
