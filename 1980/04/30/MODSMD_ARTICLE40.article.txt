The column written by Steve Kaye.
"Gay community life joyful" (Daily,
April 28), was also endorsed by the
Steering Committee of the Gay
People's Union. The Daily regrets
omitting the endorsement.
The Daily reported on April 28 that
Stanford Energy Action predicts that
investment in a solar system for the
new dormitory will result in "a net cash
benefit of $268,275 at the end of the
112 irst 10 years of operation." The
correct version should have stated that

at the end of the first 10 years of
operation, the system will save the
University $268,275 annually.
