## 
### Associated Press 
Two carrier-based U.S. fighter jets
intercepted an Iranian patrol plane
over the vital Gulf of Oman and "es
corted" it back to Iranian air space yes
terday.the Pentagon said. Iran claimed
the American jets "started to shoot" at
the plane; the Pentagon said no
weapons were tired.
The aerial encounter was the first
military confrontation between the Un
ited States and Iran since militants oc
cupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
took 53 Americans hostage Nov .4.
Iran's defense ministry formally
charged that two U.S. F-14 fighter
planes fired at two Iranian air force
planes flying routine patrol over the
Gulf of Oman. The minister added that
it scrambled four 1-4 Phantom fighters
and they drove oft the American attac
kers. (However, other sources in

Washington said that the two U.S.
planes merely made visual contact with
a single Iranian C-1 30 cargo plane and
turned it away from getting too close to
the American carrier Nimitz.)
Meanwhile.a Swiss representative in
Tehran was quoted as saying the bodies
of eight Americans killed in last Fri
day's aborted hostage rescue effort w ill
be flown to Zurich this week. Accord
ing to the Swiss news agency, the Swiss
ambassador to Iran. Eric I.ang. discus
sed the transfer with Greek Catholic
Archbishop Hilarion Capucci.
When he arrived in Tehran yester
day, Capucci said he would accompany
the bodies to another country and turn
them over to the Red Cross.
Later in the day. Capucci was pre
sent as a high Iranian official displayed
the tire-blackened foot of one of the
dead servicemen as a stage prop in a

propaganda broadside against the Un
ited States.
C'apueci. a Melehite Roman
Catholic, had been recruited to sit at
the table upon which President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's press secret
ary spilled the American remains from
a cardboard box.
Although the archbishop appeared
slightly uncomfortable, he did not pro
test. and said:
"1 appeal to all men to climb toward
God."
He indicated that he would follow
through with the repatriation of the
bodies to the United States. But he
made clear that the success of Ins mis
sion still rested in the hands of the
Ayatollah Ruholah Khomeini, who re
portedly has gi\en his blessing to their
return.
Capucci said he was doing "what the
Imam (Khomeini) has already decided.
It is a humanitarian gesture, a religious
gesture."
Swiss Embassy officials said that the
release of the bodies, now held at
Tehran's central morgue, might take
four or five days. They were uncertain
whether the American remains would
be given to them, to the International
Committee of the Red Cross, to a rep
resentative of Pope John Paul II or to
Capucci. Officials at the morgue said
they had not vet received the necessary
documents from the Iranian Ministry
of Justice to release the remains to
anyone.
According to best reports from
photographic evidence, and Iranians
who have examined the remains, there
appeared clearly to be five probably

identifiable bodies and a mixture of
charred body parts that could perhaps
constitute three others. Iranian religi
ous leaders, including the notorious
"Ayatollah Blood" Khalkhali, have
claimed that at least 30 more Ameri
cans were "burned to ashes" and left in
the sands
The Iranian news agency quoted
Bani-Sadr as saying he had asked
Cuban President Fidel Castro, current
head of the non-aligned nations, to
convene a special meeting to deal with
the American hostage rescue attempt.
Pars said Bani-Sadr also asked that the
non-aligned countries set up a commis
sion toinvestigate"Americancrimes "
during the rule of the deposed shah.
The Iranian president asked that the
meeting be held May 10-12 in Tehran,

Washington said that the two U.S.
planes merely made visual contact with
a single Iranian C-1 30 cargo plane and
turned it away from getting too close to
the American carrier Nimitz.)
Meanwhile.a Swiss representative in
Tehran was quoted as saying the bodies
of eight Americans killed in last Fri
day's aborted hostage rescue effort w ill
be flown to Zurich this week. Accord
ing to the Swiss news agency, the Swiss
ambassador to Iran. Eric I.ang. discus
sed the transfer with Greek Catholic
Archbishop Hilarion Capucci.
When he arrived in Tehran yester
day, Capucci said he would accompany
the bodies to another country and turn
them over to the Red Cross.
Later in the day. Capucci was pre
sent as a high Iranian official displayed
the tire-blackened foot of one of the
dead servicemen as a stage prop in a

propaganda broadside against the Un
ited States.
C'apueci. a Melehite Roman
Catholic, had been recruited to sit at
the table upon which President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's press secret
ary spilled the American remains from
a cardboard box.
Although the archbishop appeared
slightly uncomfortable, he did not pro
test. and said:
"1 appeal to all men to climb toward
God."
He indicated that he would follow
through with the repatriation of the
bodies to the United States. But he
made clear that the success of Ins mis
sion still rested in the hands of the
Ayatollah Ruholah Khomeini, who re
portedly has gi\en his blessing to their
return.
Capucci said he was doing "what the
Imam (Khomeini) has already decided.
It is a humanitarian gesture, a religious
gesture."
Swiss Embassy officials said that the
release of the bodies, now held at
Tehran's central morgue, might take
four or five days. They were uncertain
whether the American remains would
be given to them, to the International
Committee of the Red Cross, to a rep
resentative of Pope John Paul II or to
Capucci. Officials at the morgue said
they had not vet received the necessary
documents from the Iranian Ministry
of Justice to release the remains to
anyone.
According to best reports from
photographic evidence, and Iranians
who have examined the remains, there
appeared clearly to be five probably

identifiable bodies and a mixture of
charred body parts that could perhaps
constitute three others. Iranian religi
ous leaders, including the notorious
"Ayatollah Blood" Khalkhali, have
claimed that at least 30 more Ameri
cans were "burned to ashes" and left in
the sands
The Iranian news agency quoted
Bani-Sadr as saying he had asked
Cuban President Fidel Castro, current
head of the non-aligned nations, to
convene a special meeting to deal with
the American hostage rescue attempt.
Pars said Bani-Sadr also asked that the
non-aligned countries set up a commis
sion toinvestigate"Americancrimes "
during the rule of the deposed shah.
The Iranian president asked that the
meeting be held May 10-12 in Tehran,
Pars said.
