Two carrier-based U.S. fighter jets
intercepted an Iranian patrol plane
over the vital Gulf of Oman and "es
corted" it back to Iranian air space yes
terday.the Pentagon said. Iran claimed
the American jets "started to shoot" at
the plane; the Pentagon said no
weapons were tired.
The aerial encounter was the first
military confrontation between the Un
ited States and Iran since militants oc
cupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and
took 53 Americans hostage Nov .4.
Iran's defense ministry formally
charged that two U.S. F-14 fighter
planes fired at two Iranian air force
planes flying routine patrol over the
Gulf of Oman. The minister added that
it scrambled four 1-4 Phantom fighters
and they drove oft the American attac
kers. (However, other sources in

Washington said that the two U.S.
planes merely made visual contact with
a single Iranian C-1 30 cargo plane and
turned it away from getting too close to
the American carrier Nimitz.)
Meanwhile.a Swiss representative in
Tehran was quoted as saying the bodies
of eight Americans killed in last Fri
day's aborted hostage rescue effort w ill
be flown to Zurich this week. Accord
ing to the Swiss news agency, the Swiss
ambassador to Iran. Eric I.ang. discus
sed the transfer with Greek Catholic
Archbishop Hilarion Capucci.
When he arrived in Tehran yester
day, Capucci said he would accompany
the bodies to another country and turn
them over to the Red Cross.
Later in the day. Capucci was pre
sent as a high Iranian official displayed
the tire-blackened foot of one of the
dead servicemen as a stage prop in a

propaganda broadside against the Un
ited States.
C'apueci. a Melehite Roman
Catholic, had been recruited to sit at
the table upon which President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's press secret
ary spilled the American remains from
a cardboard box.
Although the archbishop appeared
slightly uncomfortable, he did not pro
test. and said:
"1 appeal to all men to climb toward
God."
He indicated that he would follow
through with the repatriation of the
bodies to the United States. But he
made clear that the success of Ins mis
sion still rested in the hands of the
Ayatollah Ruholah Khomeini, who re
portedly has gi\en his blessing to their
return.
