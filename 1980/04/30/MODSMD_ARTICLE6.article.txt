# Search committee opens choice of president to student scrutiny
## 
### Mike O'Reilly Staff Writer 
The search for a new University pres
ident invokes images of a nationwide
dragnet, a long, secretive process of in
terviewing, investigating and eliminat
ing nominees in the hope of eventually
selecting the man or woman best qual
ified to lead the University. While such
notions are partly accurate, they ignore
the very important task of defining
what will he expected of the new presi
dent. One of several groups currently
considering the role of the president is
the Student Presidential Search Com
mittee.
Chaired by Sibhy Freeman and
Laura Mead, former members of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, the com
mittee represents the commitment of

the Board ol Trustees to involve stu
dents in the selection process. Accord
ing to Freeman, "One of tin: valuable
things about the committee afthut this
will be a chance to express viewpoints
which might not otherwise be aired.
The trustees are more intimately aware
of the faculty's concerns and can easily
forget student issues."
The form which student participa
tion would take was left largely up to
the ASSU. On March 5, the ASSU Se
nate chartered the commitee to take
action in three areas. First, the commit
tee has been working for eight weeks to
write a Student Position Paper on the
state of the University and what issues
the committee hopes the new president
will consider. Second, the committee
has presented to the Faculty Search
Commitee a list of nominees for the
presidency. Finally, when the inter
viewing process begins, students from
the committee will participate along
with faculty, alumni and trustees.
To date, the 12-member committee
has been most involved in soliciting
student opinion by attending study
breaks in University residences. The
meetings have come to be called "gripe
sessions." In one meeting at Roble
Hall, students attacked poor teaching,
the University's emphasis on research
over than teaching. This issue will
likely appear in the position paper.
Students have also complained about
admissions policies, advising, recent
tenure decisions, new housing, the
Draw System, and the enmity which
currently exists between many
a cadem i c departments.
In an effort to deal with these issues
the committee has divided into four
subcommittees, each of which
examines a specific area of issues and
how those issues can be translated into
criteria for selecting a new president.
The External Affairs Subcommittee
looks at problems the University faces
in its relations with state, local, and

federal governments. The University
Management Subcommittee examines
the president's role 1/1 internal ad
ministration of the University.
The Educational Policy and
Philosophy Subcommittee deals with
issues such as the academic expertise ot
the nominees and the academic quality
here. Finally, the Leadership and
Equitv Subcommittee examines the
commitment of the nominees to use the
University's resources, both institu
tional and intellectual, to foster aware
ness and change, according to one
committee member.
At this point, none of the committees
has concluded its reports. However,
several trends can be noted from the
committee members' reports. A con
tinued commitment to affirmative ac
tion and non-discrimination will be
urged.
Luis Reyes, member of the Leader
ship and Equitv Subcommittee, said he
hopes the new president will be willing
to talk with under-represented groups
here. "He should bring with him a
commitment to the participation of di
verse groups in the University." Reyes
said.
Kevin Rhodes said he looks for a
"strong leader. The new president
must he able to work within the Uni
versity's consensual decision-making
processes so that the University will
reflect his vision, personality, character
and goals," Rhodes said.
Finally, on the issue of leadership
style, the committee unanimously con
cluded that it is looking for "someone
who is proactive rather than reactive,"
said Rhodes.
According to Katherine Tobin.
committee member, the committee
plans to submit its criteria lists and Stu
dent Position Paper to the Board of
Trustees before its June meeting so
that the trustees may consider the
proposals at that time.
