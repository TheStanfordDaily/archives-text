# Students seek convention delegate positions
## 
### Lisa Adler Staff Writer 
As campaign fever heats up all over
California in anticipation of the June 3
presidential primary, half a dozen Stan
ford students are seeking delegate posi
tions to the Democratic National Con
vention this summer in New York City.
On May 4 two groups of students,
one supporting President Jimmy Car
ter and one for Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass:), are scheduled to attend
presidential nominating caucuses in
Mountain View, the first stage ifi the
selection of Democratic delegates from
the 12th Congressional district
Brad Crystal, a sophomore majoring
in political science, and Pete Fischer, a
first-year law student, are seeking Car
ter delegate positions, while junior
Mark Agnew and freshman Gary Hal
lee, sophomore Joe Caldcrazzo and
history graduate student Ted Andrews

are in contention for Kennedy delegate
spots.
Two pairs of these students are pool
ing their efforts to obtain delegate sluts
— Crystal and Fischer for Carter and
Agnew and Hallec for Kennedy. The
others are running individually.
Good experience
While each of the six student dele
gate candidates said they decided to
run because it "would be a good ex
perience," Crystal. Fischer and Agnew
specifically cited the need for youth
representation.
"What 1 see as being most important
is representing students. Youth need to
have a representative. I hope that in
itself will draw people to the caucus,"
Agnew, the Kennedy Student/Youth
Campaign coordinator for Northern
California, said.
"The main thrust bf our campaign is
to see that the youth — those under 30

— are represented," said Crystal,
founder of the Stanford Carter/
Mondale Campaign Committee.
With that aim in mind. Crystal said
he and Fischer are distributing cam
paign fliers, setting up an afternoon
booth in White Plaza and hiring a bus
to transport supporters to the May 4
caucus. "
Caldcrazzo affirmed that "the more
friends you bring, the better the
chances of getting elected." But he said
he has no plan of action. "I didn't even
know there was an organization for
Kennedy on campus."
Agnew expressed optimism concern
ing his and Hallec's chances of becom
ing delegates.
"The caucus is a matter of who you
know, not necessarily who you bring."
Agnew said.
He predicted that about 500 people
would attend the Kennedy caucus. "If

we c;in bring 50 people, we will be very
appealing to those present.'" he said.
Caucus strategy
Crystal and Fischer have ii strategy
of their own. Explained Crystal:
"Since each person at the caucus is
allowed to cast five votes, Stanford
students will presumably be using two
votes for Pete and&nysclf. It is crucial to
make sure that our supporters deliver
their other three votes in a manner that
won't compromise our chances."
To do this Crystal said he and Fischer
will take advantage of a party by-law
which mandates that half the delegate
slots be reserved for women.
"If our supporters disperse all their
non-Stanford votes among female can
didates, or if we can form an alliance
with a woman's group at the caucus our
chances will improve immeasurably,"
he said.
Andrews' reasons for running for a
Kennedy delegate spot include "halt
curiosity" and "half commitment."
He indicated that, it not elected at
the caucuses, he would try again during
the state convention on June 21. when
65 at-large delegates will be picked.
Both Agnew and Crystal said the
caucus would be educational, the latter
adding that those attending the caucus
would be exposed to the political pro
cess and. in so doing, discover healthy
and unhealthy aspects of the system.
Although each of the two caucuses
will choose four delegates, just how
many of them will be eligible to attend
the convention depends on how well
the two candidates fare in this district in
the primary. For example, if Carter and
Kennedy each receive 50 percent of the
12th Congressional djstrict popular
vote in June, then two delegates from
each candidate would go the conven
tion. If one of the two candidates wins
by a landslide, all four of that candi

date's delegates would attend the con
vention.
Agnew mentioned that the esti
mated expenses for a delegate to attend
the Democratic National Convention
in New York would run about $1000 to
$1200. Calderazzo and Andrews

stated that it would he a problem rais
ing the money.
As far as Crystal could see, the only
significant impact a delegate could
have would be on the second ballot.
The California delegation, though, is
very powerful," Crystal said.

ing the money.
As far as Crystal could see, the only
significant impact a delegate could
have would be on the second ballot.
The California delegation, though, is
very powerful," Crystal said.
As campaign fever heats up all over
California in anticipation of the June 3
presidential primary, half a dozen Stan
ford students are seeking delegate posi
tions to the Democratic National Con
vention this summer in New York City.
On May 4 two groups of students,
one supporting President Jimmy Car
ter and one for Sen. Edward Kennedy
(D-Mass:), are scheduled to attend
presidential nominating caucuses in
Mountain View, the first stage ifi the
selection of Democratic delegates from
the 12th Congressional district
Brad Crystal, a sophomore majoring
in political science, and Pete Fischer, a
first-year law student, are seeking Car
ter delegate positions, while junior
Mark Agnew and freshman Gary Hal
lee, sophomore Joe Caldcrazzo and
history graduate student Ted Andrews

are in contention for Kennedy delegate
spots.
Two pairs of these students are pool
ing their efforts to obtain delegate sluts
— Crystal and Fischer for Carter and
Agnew and Hallec for Kennedy. The
others are running individually.
Good experience
While each of the six student dele
gate candidates said they decided to
run because it "would be a good ex
perience," Crystal. Fischer and Agnew
specifically cited the need for youth
representation.
"What 1 see as being most important
is representing students. Youth need to
have a representative. I hope that in
itself will draw people to the caucus,"
Agnew, the Kennedy Student/Youth
Campaign coordinator for Northern
California, said.
"The main thrust bf our campaign is
to see that the youth — those under 30

— are represented," said Crystal,
founder of the Stanford Carter/
Mondale Campaign Committee.
With that aim in mind. Crystal said
he and Fischer are distributing cam
paign fliers, setting up an afternoon
booth in White Plaza and hiring a bus
to transport supporters to the May 4
caucus. "
Caldcrazzo affirmed that "the more
friends you bring, the better the
chances of getting elected." But he said
he has no plan of action. "I didn't even
know there was an organization for
Kennedy on campus."
Agnew expressed optimism concern
ing his and Hallec's chances of becom
ing delegates.
"The caucus is a matter of who you
know, not necessarily who you bring."
Agnew said.
He predicted that about 500 people
would attend the Kennedy caucus. "If

we c;in bring 50 people, we will be very
appealing to those present.'" he said.
Caucus strategy
Crystal and Fischer have ii strategy
of their own. Explained Crystal:
"Since each person at the caucus is
allowed to cast five votes, Stanford
students will presumably be using two
votes for Pete and&nysclf. It is crucial to
make sure that our supporters deliver
their other three votes in a manner that
won't compromise our chances."
To do this Crystal said he and Fischer
will take advantage of a party by-law
which mandates that half the delegate
slots be reserved for women.
"If our supporters disperse all their
non-Stanford votes among female can
didates, or if we can form an alliance
with a woman's group at the caucus our
chances will improve immeasurably,"
he said.
Andrews' reasons for running for a
Kennedy delegate spot include "halt
curiosity" and "half commitment."
He indicated that, it not elected at
the caucuses, he would try again during
the state convention on June 21. when
65 at-large delegates will be picked.
Both Agnew and Crystal said the
caucus would be educational, the latter
adding that those attending the caucus
would be exposed to the political pro
cess and. in so doing, discover healthy
and unhealthy aspects of the system.
Although each of the two caucuses
will choose four delegates, just how
many of them will be eligible to attend
the convention depends on how well
the two candidates fare in this district in
the primary. For example, if Carter and
Kennedy each receive 50 percent of the
12th Congressional djstrict popular
vote in June, then two delegates from
each candidate would go the conven
tion. If one of the two candidates wins
by a landslide, all four of that candi

date's delegates would attend the con
vention.
Agnew mentioned that the esti
mated expenses for a delegate to attend
the Democratic National Convention
in New York would run about $1000 to
$1200. Calderazzo and Andrews

stated that it would he a problem rais
ing the money.
