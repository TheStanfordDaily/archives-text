## African nations shun new Liberian regime 
### James Macmanus The Guardian 
NAIROBI. Kenya — The as
sassination of President l olhert
of Liberia and the subsequent
exeeution of most of his Cabinet
members have made the new re
gime of Master Sgt. Samuel Doe
a temporal s outeast in the rest ot
Africa.
Hacks turned
With the exception of Libya,
which recognized the military

government in Monrovia within
hours ot the April 12 coup,
members ot the Organization ot
African Unity (OAU) have
turned their backs on Doe and
his People's Redemption Coun
cil.
In an unprecedented step,
Nigeria refused permission for
Monrovia's new foreign minis
ter. B a ecus Mathews, to attend
the current OAU economic
summit in Lat»os.

Although the host nation
made the decision alone, there
was no apparent dissent among
representatives of the 50-
member organization.
I'his was unusual since the
OAU calls for recognition of
states and not governments — a
philosophy conveniently devised
to excuse participation in Pan
African policymaking of such
previously tyrannical regimes as
Uganda. Equitorial Guinea and
the former Central African Em
pire.
OAU spokesman Peter Onu
offered the explanation that
since the meeting was for heads
ot state, a foreign minister could
not attend the meeting anyway.
In fact only half the OAU
heads of state have traveled to
Lagos for the meeting, and there
are plenty of African foreign
ministers around the Nigerian
capital to disprove the explana
tion.
The point is that Nigeria had
joined other nations and world
organizations in asking for an
end to the violence in Liberia
after Tolbert's death. They were
snubbed by the nevs rulers in
Monrovia. Doe therefore has
begun life as an African leader
with an unforgiving neighbor on
his doorstep in the shape of the
most powerful nation in the

OAU.
Hostility
The initial hostility to the
People's Redemption Council in
Africa goes a lot deeper than
mere dislike of military coups
and theexample that could be set
for other non-commissioned of
ficers on the continent.
For obvious reasons, the OAU
does not wish to be seen to con
done coups or invasions, al
though at least 10 current Afri
can leaders have come to power
through such means.
The barbaric seafront execu
tions of such well-known figures
as Cecil Dennis, the former
Liberian foreign minister (who
was sentenced to life imprison
ment and not death) have re
pulsed ev en those governments
who liked the corruption and
elitism of the old Americo-
Liberian order in Monrovia.
Perfect Propaganda
Written and televised reports
of a jeering Monrovian mob
celebrating the work of a firing
squad were circulated around
the world, making perfect prop
aganda for those abroad who be
lieve in instability oil the conti
nent.
As a senior Kenyan official
said here this week. "It was a
humiliating and disgusting ex

perienee for us all. I thought we
had grown out of that sort of
thing."
Apart from the cruelty of the
killings, which despite Liberian
denials involved ministers who
had actually been acquitted by
the military tribunal. Doe's
clumsy attempt to assume the
mantle of Tolbert as this year's
OAU chairman, was taken as a
deliberate insult in Pan African
circles. Hie charter of the or
ganization has no provision for
the replacement of a chairman
during his term of duty.
Solves problem
This should solve a delicate
problem for the OAU at the July
summit in Freetown. Sierra
Leone, when the outgoing
chairman traditionally gives an
address summing up the prob
lems and achievements of his
term in office.
The thought of an unknown
sergeant assuming the role of a
man he had murdered in order to
lecture the organization on such
successes as the independence of
Zimbabwe frankly appalled the
OAU secretariat.
One of the vice presidents will
be invited to make the keynote
address, which will almost cer
tainly contain strong condemna
tion of military coups.

problem for the OAU at the July

NAIROBI. Kenya — The as
sassination of President l olhert
of Liberia and the subsequent
exeeution of most of his Cabinet
members have made the new re
gime of Master Sgt. Samuel Doe
a temporal s outeast in the rest ot
Africa.
Hacks turned
With the exception of Libya,
which recognized the military

government in Monrovia within
hours ot the April 12 coup,
members ot the Organization ot
African Unity (OAU) have
turned their backs on Doe and
his People's Redemption Coun
cil.
In an unprecedented step,
Nigeria refused permission for
Monrovia's new foreign minis
ter. B a ecus Mathews, to attend
the current OAU economic
summit in Lat»os.

Although the host nation
made the decision alone, there
was no apparent dissent among
representatives of the 50-
member organization.
I'his was unusual since the
OAU calls for recognition of
states and not governments — a
philosophy conveniently devised
to excuse participation in Pan
African policymaking of such
previously tyrannical regimes as
Uganda. Equitorial Guinea and
the former Central African Em
pire.
OAU spokesman Peter Onu
offered the explanation that
since the meeting was for heads
ot state, a foreign minister could
not attend the meeting anyway.
In fact only half the OAU
heads of state have traveled to
Lagos for the meeting, and there
are plenty of African foreign
ministers around the Nigerian
capital to disprove the explana
tion.
The point is that Nigeria had
joined other nations and world
organizations in asking for an
end to the violence in Liberia
after Tolbert's death. They were
snubbed by the nevs rulers in
Monrovia. Doe therefore has
begun life as an African leader
with an unforgiving neighbor on
his doorstep in the shape of the
most powerful nation in the

OAU.
Hostility
The initial hostility to the
People's Redemption Council in
Africa goes a lot deeper than
mere dislike of military coups
and theexample that could be set
for other non-commissioned of
ficers on the continent.
For obvious reasons, the OAU
does not wish to be seen to con
done coups or invasions, al
though at least 10 current Afri
can leaders have come to power
through such means.
The barbaric seafront execu
tions of such well-known figures
as Cecil Dennis, the former
Liberian foreign minister (who
was sentenced to life imprison
ment and not death) have re
pulsed ev en those governments
who liked the corruption and
elitism of the old Americo-
Liberian order in Monrovia.
Perfect Propaganda
Written and televised reports
of a jeering Monrovian mob
celebrating the work of a firing
squad were circulated around
the world, making perfect prop
aganda for those abroad who be
lieve in instability oil the conti
nent.
As a senior Kenyan official
said here this week. "It was a
humiliating and disgusting ex

perienee for us all. I thought we
had grown out of that sort of
thing."
Apart from the cruelty of the
killings, which despite Liberian
denials involved ministers who
had actually been acquitted by
the military tribunal. Doe's
clumsy attempt to assume the
mantle of Tolbert as this year's
OAU chairman, was taken as a
deliberate insult in Pan African
circles. Hie charter of the or
ganization has no provision for
the replacement of a chairman
during his term of duty.

be invited to make the keynote
address, which will almost cer
tainly contain strong condemna
