### Kathy Sawyer The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Not long
alter the bullets stopped tlvingat
the Dominican Embassy in
Bogota. I S. Ambassador Diego
Asencio and two other diplomats
held hostage by leftist guerrillas
there began to act as consultants,
of a sort, for their image
conscious captors. They even
wrote a "first draft" of the de
mands that eventually led to
their safe release.
Asencio shared that and other
revelations about his hi days ol
captivity yesterday as he re
turned to Washington tor a
hero's welcome from Vice Presi
dent Mondale. Acting Secretary
of State Warren Christopher and
throngs ol Ins colleagues in the
Foreign Sen ice.
l or the professional dip
lomats. with their chief resigning
and do/ens of their colleagues
held hostage in Iran. Asencio
provided one of the lew occa
sions for jubiliation they ha\e
had lately.
As hundreds of State Depart
ment employees filled the bal
conies and lobby of their head
quarters building, applauding
and cheering. Christopher gave
Asencio a plaque, eventually to
be replaced by a gold medal, "for
valor."
Hie wry. personaable Asen
cio. solidly built with a salt-and
pepper beard lie grew in captiv
ity. responded that he wouldn't
recommend this particular route
to a medal.
"My relief is great at being
free, hut it is \ erv much tem

pered bv the fact that I don't
think any Foreign Serv ice officer
can consider himself truly free
while Ins friends and cohorts are
being held prisoner in Tehran."
In a subdued but warm cere
mony earlier at Andrews Air
Force Base. Mondale hailed
Aseneio as "a hero, a man ot
courage and as a symbol ot the
finest in American character."
The vice president took the
opportunity, as well, to say a
word about the hostage-takers,
underscoring the administra
tion's new hard line. "Terrorism
and the taking of hostages
whether in Bogota. Tehran or
anywhere else in the world, are
inhumane acts. They must be
condemned. They must be com
bated. They must be stopped.
"We must measure our own
civilization by the force with
which we separate ourselves
from barbarism." Mondale said.
Ascencio. asked how he would
have felt about a mission to re
scue him similar to the one that
failed in Iran, said he had mixed
emotions.
"I felt it would result in con
siderable casualties." he said, re
ferring to his own circumstances.
"With my colleagues (other hos
tages). I decided instead ot get
ting tough, let's get smart. We
had the experience. They had the
muscles, the grenades, the
dynamite, the bombs."
He said he had no direct evi
dence that his seizure was in
spired by the takeover of the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran, "but I
think it probably influenced" the
Colombian guerrillas.
