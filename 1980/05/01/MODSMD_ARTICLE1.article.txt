# Iranian embassy in London seized by Arab militants

From the Daily wire services
LONDON — Three "Arab power" militants
took oventhe Iranian Embassy on a quiet Lon
don back street yesterday and threatened to
kill their 20 hostages unless Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini's regime frees 91 political pris
oners held in Iran's Arab-populated oil belt.
11 the Tehran government does not meet
their demand by noon today, the gunmen said,
they will blow up the building.
The three men, who described themselves as
Iranians of Arab ethnic origin, said they were
members of a "martyrs group" that sought au
tonomy for Khuzistan, which they referred to
as "Arabistan."
Among those held in the embassy were a
British policeman, who was stationed at the
entrance, and two television staffers from the
British Broadcasting Corp, who were inside

applying for visas to go to Tehran. The rest of
the hostages were thought to be Iranians —
mostly embassy staff members — but there
were conflicting reports as to whether one
might be a Lebanese journalist.
By last night, the gunmen had communi
cated by telephone with the police and the
BBC in London, and they had instructed the
two BBC hostages to transmit a message via
the embassy telex to the outside world.
In another call to a local radio station, the
raiders said in answer to a question that all the
hostages were safe.
The British police technique was described
last night as that of a policy of "watching, wait
ing, negotiating and keeping calm."
"We are hoping to bring it to a successful
conclusion as we have done in the past," a
senior police official said of the takeover.

Police cordoned»off the area and sent
specially-trained marksmen to surround the
embassy soon after the attack, which came
shortly before noon.
At the time, three men — described by one
witness as "Arab looking" and carrying a rifle
and handguns — forced their way through the
front door of the embassy, a five-story struc
ture with a white Georgian-style facade on the
south side of Hyde Park.
They apparently disarmed the police officer
standing guard inside the door and took over
the embassy. At first, they were thought to be
Iraqis, but when the captors heard those re
ports over the radio, they called the BBC to
announce that they were "southern Iranians."
Police experts here presume them to be Ira
nian ethnic Arabs who have called on Tehran
in the past to grant more autonomy to Khuzis

tan, the southwestern province of Iran that lies
closest to Iraq.
The Iraqis, of course, are Arabs, while the
Iranians are of Persian origin, and there has
always been difficulty between the two ethnic
groups along the border.
It is thought that those whose release is de
manded by the terrorists are political prisoners
jailed by the revolutionary government domi
nated by Khomeini or by the previous regime
of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi.
A few hours after the seizure, a woman was
taken from the embassy — apparently ill or
extremely distraught — and driven off in an
ambulance.
The attack by Khuzistan ethnic Arabs
touched a very sensitive nerve with the Ira
nians.
Iran has been plagued in recent years by

autonomy movements — by the Kurds in Kur
distan, by the Turks in Azerbaijan, by the Tur
komans in the northeast, and by the Baluchis in
the southeast.
But. while the central Iranian government
has opposed any dramatic form of autonomy
for any of the ethnic groups, an independence
move in Khuzistan would be very damaging to
the economy — because that is where 95 per
cent of the country's oil comes from.
Under the shah, the central government
tried to move many Persians into the Khuzistan
area. This further aggravated the situation for,
even though the area was producing most of
the nation's wealth, the Arabs in Khuzistan felt
that their living conditions were poor.
The move toward autonomy in Khuzistan
has been supported, either overtly or secretly,
by the Iraqi government in Baghdad.
