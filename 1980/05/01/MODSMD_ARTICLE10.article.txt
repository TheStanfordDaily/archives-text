# Officials tolerate unrest
## Korean workers strike

SEOUL, Korea — Sitdown
strikes, walk-outs and other
labor protests, some of them vio
lent, are spreading across South
Korea in a wave of worker upris
ings that were never tolerated
during the reign of the late Presi
dent Park Chung Hee.
At least 25 companies have
been subjected to strikes or
other actions demanding higher
wages and the ousting of pro
management union leaders.
Representatives of both labor
and business groups call the ex
tent of the actions unpre
cedented.
Workers in several industries
have sat down on shop floors,
occupied managers' offices,
smashed furniture, and on two
occasions fought violently with
police.
A demand for higher wages in
the face of soaring inflation is
one reason for the uprisings. But
both strikers and businessmen
say the major reason is that, for
the first time in years, the gov
ernment is not intervening on
management's behalf in labor
disputes — in effect, permitting
technically illegal strikes to go on
unhampered.
Two disputes have been
marked by widespread violence.
In the southern port city of Pu
san, about 1000 steelworkers
clashed Tuesday night with local
police during a protest demand
ing a 40 percent wage increase.
Eleven policemen and one
steelworker were injured.
Miners attack
In the most serious confronta
tion, coal miners last week took
over the central city of Sabuk,
attacked a police station, killed a
policeman and demonished sev
eral houses. They were trying to
oust their union president, who
had accepted a 20 percent com
pany wage increase instead of a
figure twice that much being
sought by the rank and file.
Other plant rebellions have
been settled without serious vio
lence, largely because employers
have granted big wage increases
to avoid more trouble.
Here in Seoul, for example,
980 workers at the 11-shin Steel
Co. sat on the shop floor for two
days last weekend, chanting slo
gans and shouting their de
mands. Management surren
dered, and by Monday afternoon
workers had posted at the plant
gate a list of their victories —
doubled bonuses, an average
wage increase of 25 percent and
the ousting of the union presi
dent, deemed subservient to the
management.

The wave of unrest has
shocked businessmen and gov
ernment officials. Coming on <he
heels of widespread campus de
monstrations by students, it has
triggered fears of a military
crackdown and further trouble.
But neither the civilian govern
ment nor the martial-law com
mand has stepped in.
Strikes are illegal under South
Korea's national security law
and were rarely attempted dur
ing the late President Park's long
rule. Occasional protest actions
were frequently followed by
harassment by the Korean Cent
ral Intelligence Agency. Persons
advocating strong trade union
activities were often arrested.
But the interim civilian gov
ernment that followed Park's as
sassination last October has de
cided to let the disputes this year
run their course. "The govern
ment seems to have an unstated
policy that these (strikes) are al
right so long as they do not dis
turb the social order," said one
business leader.
Substantial wage increases al
ready have been promised this
spring. Reports tabulated by the
Urban Industrial Mission, a

church-sponsored labor group
show many factories have been
forced to reduce working days
from 12 to eight hours and to
grant sizeable pay increases.
According to Hwang C'hung
hyan, executive director of the
Korean employers association,
the average wage increase so far
has been about 25 percent, de
spite a government guideline
seeking to limit them to about 1 5
percent.
Hwang, who said the scale of
protests is unprecedented, thinks
the fear of inflation is driving
workers to make exorbitant de
mands. "There is one machinery
plant where they're asking for 50
percent," he said. "How can
anybody pay that?"
Business leaders are shocked
and angered by the unrest but
agree employers will try to meet
most demands unless the gov
ernment intervenes.
The labor movement is
"spreading rapidly and won't
reach its peak for months," said
one executive who asked not to
be identified in print. "It is just
the beginning."
