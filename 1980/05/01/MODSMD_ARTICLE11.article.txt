NEW DELHI, India â€”
Hundreds of high school girls
and women college students
demonstrated in central
Kabul yesterday, shouting
anti-government and anti-
Soviet slogans, according to a
report reaching here.
The demonstrations, which
took place in the Shar-I-Nau
district of central Kabul, were
described as the most open
display of anti-government
and anti-Soviet sentiment
since late February, when
hundreds were killed in a
general city-wide uprising
against the Soviet occupation.
Both Soviet troops and
armed civilian members of
the ruling Khalq Party moved
into the area, in an attempt to
restore order, according to
the report.
Rumors sweeping the city
Tuesday that several students
at a boy's school in Kabul
were killed Sunday by Af
ghan troops could not be con
firmed, the report said.
The demonstrations were
said to be the culmination of
several incidents at Kabul
schools in recent days. There
is speculation in diplomatic
circles here that they were
part of an attempt to embar
rass the government as it
celebrated the second an
niversary of the coup (April
27) that first brought the
pro-Marxist, pro-Soviet re
gime to power.
The source of the report,
who refused to be identified,
has been a reliable informant
in the past concerning de
velopments in the city.
Teenagers march
The report said Tuesday's
unrest began in the early
morning when an estimated
200 teen-age girls from the
Zarghuna High School, near
the Iranian Embassy,
gathered outside the school
and began marching toward
the Foreign Ministry, less
than one-half mile away.

They shouted, "Death to
the Soviets" and "Death to
Babrak Karmal" as they
marched, according to the re
port. Karmal was installed as
Afghanistan's president fol
lowing the Soviet invasion.
About two blocks from the
school', the procession was
ringed by Afghan security
forces, who tried to prevent it
from going farther.
According to the account,
the girls then began throwing
rocks at passing vehicles. Two
girls were said to have been
injured, but it is unclear how
the injuries were incurred.
By late morning, the
number of demonstrators had
dropped to about 100, but in
defiance of the civilian and
army force which still sur
rounded them, the protesters
began moving toward the ci
ty's main shopping areas.
The armed security forces,
apparently reluctant to break
up the demonstration by
force, moved with the protes
ters toward the shopping
area, according to the report.
By this time, the high
schoolers had been rein
forced by a group of college
age women who had gathered
in the same general area.
'Russians go home'
When the demonstrators
spotted a group of Russian
women shopping, they broke
into chants of "Russians go
home, Russians go home,"
the account said.
Shoppers hurriedly left the
area, and by midday about
half the shops in the district
were reportedly shut down.
A group of boys from
Amani College near the
Shar-I-Nau district, appa
rently trying to join the de
monstration, were halted by
warning shots from Afghan
army troops before they
could leave the college, the
report said. The troops then
closed the gates to the col
lege, locking the students in
side.
