WASHINGTON — From swallowing
goldfish to sitting atop flagpoles, from stuf
fing phone booths to streaking, college stu
dents have seized upon wacky fads to immor
talize their generation.
For the class of it's tucking each
other into hed.
"It's precious, really." said Dr. William
Thomas, vice chancellor of student affairs at
the University of Maryland where the tuck
in craze is going strong. "For a small fee,
they'll read you a bedtime story, tuck you
into bed and kiss you goodnight."
"It's definitely innocent," said Jennifer
Little, a 2 1-year-old junior who was tucked
in last week. "You're away from home, it
makes you feel more comfortable and more
secure. Besides, it's something that hasn't
been done to you in a loni>, lonjj time."

Die current craze reportedly started at
Penn State last semester, made a brief stop at
Catholic University and then landed
squarely on the third floor of University ol
Maryland's Frederick Hall where Pillow
Talk, Inc., a company made up of male stu
dents, currently is filling nightly tuck-in or
ders for female students.
"We're strictly a class operation," said Pil
low Talk member David Swerdlow. lor a
yy-cent fee, the students dispatch a pajama
clad bed-time reader, escorted by two Pillow
Talk members in three-piece suits, to the
client's dormitory room. There, the woman
student is offered a choice of stories and a
stuffed animal. When the story is finished,
the reader tucks in his client, pecks her on the
cheek and exits.
"It's unusual, yes," said Richard
Stimpson, directorof resident life on the Col

lege Park campus which houses 8000 stu
dents. "I don't know whether there's been
anything similar to it in recent years."
Pillow Talk, Inc. began placing ads in the
campus newspaper last month and has per
formed over 100 tuck-ins.
In retaliation, a female tuck-in serv ice has
sprung up at St. Mary's Hall. "When was the
last time you had five gals tuck you into
bed?" was how the St. Mary's students ad
vertised their service, l or a 25-cent tee. the
coeds will read a bedtime story, sing
"Rock-A-Bye Baby" and tuck the male
client under the covers.
"It's pretty funny," said 21-year-old
sophomore Marie Beyernheimer.
The female tuckers place notices in the
men's dormitories and never travel in groups
of less than five. "For security reasons,"
