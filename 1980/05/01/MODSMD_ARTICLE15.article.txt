What is the fascination in writ
ing on walls? And how far does
the right to express yourself in
this manner extend?
Many don't realize that graffiti
is a misdemeanor classified
under malicious mischief. And,
according to campus police I t.
Marvin Moore, it is a bookable
offense. However, he estimated
there will only he a do/en graffiti
arrests this year.
Graffiti here runs from crea
tive, to artistic, to political, to
rude. And it is no longer limited
to men's bathrooms.
Women are catching up to
men in just about everything —
including bathroom graffiti.
According to painting and
glass supervisor Mans Scheelke,
women are responsible for the
slight increase in rest room writ
ings recently.
Women's comments in Tre
sidder, a major graffiti haven,
run the gamut from "if men got
pregnant, abortion would be a
sacrament" to "I personally feel
that it's about time that we give
men credit for being human be
ings: there are just as many fools
that masquerade as women."
Scheelke said maintenance
crews check and repaint com
mon graffiti spots about every
two to three months. The prim
ary locations are Meyer, Cub
berley. Green and ( ummings. he
said.
He called Meyer "one of the

worst" graffiti sites on campus
since all of its bathrooms are hit.
The library has 3000 tenants
daily, and heavy traffic is a large
cause of graffiti proliferation.
"If you go back to these every
week, there's at least some graf
fiti," he said.
Maintenance periodically
checks other buildings, usually
about every four or six months.
Scheelke also acts on reports of
very obscene, political or offen
sive material.
Individual departments often
receive complaints and call
Scheelke.
According to painter Manuel
Sanchez, "sometimes they (the
students) also do the outside of
the buildings if they're mad at a
professor or something."
Maintenance operations man
ager Bruce Wiggins said there is
no special vandalism or graffiti
budget. "We don't really keep
track as to whether we're paint
ing something for graffiti," he
said, "because it's not thousands
and thousands of dollars."
The total budget for painting
academic buildings is less than
$4 million, so graffiti cost is in
significant, he said. He added
that "if graffiti went away, we'd
still be painting over."
Wiggins said painting can usu
ally wipe out graffiti, but a
sandblaster must be used occa
sionally in external damage.
According to Moore, large
scale graffiti is mostly centered
around events on campus, par

ticularly Big Game.
Major graffiti can be reported
to the 24-hour maintenance dis
patch at 497-2281.
Otero, a four-class Wilbur
house, has recently had some
graffiti controversy. According
to RA Marc Ventresca, "Some
people thought it was a wonder
ful way to express themselves,
but we had a lot of discussion
about whether to clean it up."
He said that Otero had a "suc
cessful run of butcher paper on
the first floor." But he added
that "people had a certain
amount of pleasure in writing on
the walls."
Ventresca claimed that tooth
paste is a popular medium for
graffiti expression. "It's a
three-dimensional art," said
Otero resident Tom Tromba
dore. "It's a creative art form."
Otero residents blew the graf
fiti controversy out of propor
tion, said Ventresca. This led to
the forming of committees for
"freedom and justice in the
stalls."
Otero resident Brian Stoll
helped organize FILTH (Free
dom in lavatories through
honor)." We want to write on the
walls, not the paper." he said.
FILTH's slogan ran: \
"The graffiti that blesses* our
wall
Must be saved for the btyiefit
of all
Our creative expression 1
Will not stand repression
Vote liberty and justice for
all." ' H
Ventresca emphasized that
the bathrooms are the "one
place people really do 'rbad
stuff." '
One Otero bathroom proc
laims "Don't drop acid — tifke it
Pass-No credit!"
Hie Tresidder walls seem par
ticularly politically orieHt'ed,
however. One stall user wrofe:
"Smile capitalists smile \
Smile while you can J "
Remember what happened
To the Shah of Iran." 1
Another commented that 1 "a
bourgeois democracy means
democracy for the bourgeois# —
not me."
People also seem to onjoy
criticizing the writings of others.
One woman wrote "I was burn
here." Another responded " You
are free to move."
