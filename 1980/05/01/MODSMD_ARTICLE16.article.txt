Yesterday's Daily included our recom
mendations for undergraduate senate can
didates. The following four graduate stu
dents, after interviews with the editorial
board, were determined to be promising
senate candidates who would make able

residential education and housing consid
erations for graduate students. He shows a
basic understanding of ASSU mechanics
and seems to have the energy necessary to
persevere in a role as senator.
Ted Mitchell — a most impressive can
didate. Mitchell has a tremendous record
here as an undergraduate and graduate.
His experience includes three years as an
RA. one year as director of the Speakers

Bureau and director of the summer hous
ing program. Mitchell's understanding of
the University would be a boon to next
year's senate.
Clay Smith — another well-rounded,
experienced candidate. Smith spent con
siderable time this year working with the
Coffee House Task Force, which brought
us one of the senate's most impressive re
cent accomplishments. In addition. Smith
has been involved with several worthwhile
programs and has put a great deal of time
into preparing his senate platform.
Gary Reiff — this year's senate par
liamentarian. Reiff has campus experience
as a former KZSU news director and
member of the senate rules committee. He
has a firm grasp of the issues facing
graduate students and undergrads. and has
the energy and experience necessary to be
