# Fee assessment
## 
### 
One fee assessment request will appear
on next week's ASSU ballot. All 15 fee
assessment requests were passed in the last
election, and with the addition of this $1
assessment. $25 in refundable assessments
will be collected next year fr.om each regis
tered student. As always, 2*o percent of the
registered student body must vote on this
assessment request for the vote to be valid.
The Daily makes the following recommen
dation on the fee assessment proposal.
Speakers Bureau â€” Yes
The Speakers Bureau is requesting a fall
quarter fee assessment that will supple

ment the winter and spring quarter fee al
location already approved in the last elec
tion.
Although we are concerned that the
Speakers Bureau has not been as well
managed as it could have been this year
(and this hasty request for an additional fee
assessment seems to illustrate this), this
group has proven to be an important fund
ing source for a host of valuable programs
and speakers, and we therefore recom
mend a yes vote on this measure. Voting
yes will help to ensure a stronger Speakers
Bureau in the fall.
