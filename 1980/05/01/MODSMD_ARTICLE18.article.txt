# The 						Coffee House
## 
### 
Today is the first day of operation for the
new. student-operated Coffee House. We
welcome the addition of this innovative
and potentially significant addition to the
Stanford community.
Months of hard work by many students
led to the fine proposal submitted to the
University by the ASSU. It is perhaps the
most impressive accomplishment by the
ASSU Senate, in recent years, and makes
today a special one. We congratulate the
efforts of those students who believed a
student-run campus establishment wquld
have a positive effect on the community.
We also applaud the University ad
ministration for its confidence in the stu
dents' ability to operate a well-run business
venture designed to benefit thfe entire Uni

versity community.
Certainly, the difficult task is still ahead.
Transforming the Coffee House into a
place more appealing to more students will
take time and energy. Better service, lower
prices and a more congenial atmosphere do
not happen magically. Nor does good,
sound management.
But we believe the decision to award the
contract to the ASSU was a good one. Only
with this opportunity will students have the
chance to show what they can, or cannot,
do.
On our part, we hope the gamble suc
ceeds. More services run by members of
the community can only make this campus
more aware of the needs and wants of stu
dents, staff and faculty here.
