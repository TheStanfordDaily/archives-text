Student discounts
I'd like to extend a note of
thanks to ASSU Special Events
for having the consideration to
offer student prices to some of
their events, such as the upcom
ing Stanford Jazz Picnic. It is my
hope that we will see more stu
dent discounts of this kind for
events that take place on our
campus.

Many Americans fear that the
Soviet arms build-up reveals
sadistic motives. But I fear that
the Soviet Union resembles
America; like the Soviets, we
enjoy masochism, not mere
sadism.
Remember Miss Liberty, the
lady who once led our troops into
battle, with the fervor of righte
ousness in the struggle for free
dom? She appears in old paint

ings, scantily clad and enticing.
But alas, in our eagerness to win
in Vietnam we lost her. She
drifted off in the Gulf of Tonkin,
while we bombed peasants.
More recently, we lost eight
lives in the Iranian desert. Our
hearts were in the right place, but
our technicians were not.
That brings me near my con
clusion, and perhaps our conclu
sion: Soon. American masoch
ists will get the thrill to end their
lives. If our best technicians can
not send well-trained Marines
through a sandstorm (and ac
cording to Defense Secretary
Harold Brown, we used the best
ones available), should we trust
other technicians (presumably
not as competent) with the
countless nuclear weapons and
plants they build around our
countrv?
Do you want to trust our lives
to technicians? We must to some
extent; but we don't need to
spend $140 billion each year on
weapons.
Those weapons might kill us

someday, as they wounded Miss
Liberty. Masochism is a deadly
game.

New Wave better
As an avid admirer of such
New Wave artists as Elvis Cos
tello and The Talking Heads. I'm
offended when Jeffrey
Maltzmann. as he describes a
band rally for The Knack (Daily,
April 23), refers to this group as
New Wave and the high school
cheerleaders who "gaggle"
about them as "New Wave
fans."
How can Elvis Costello be
classified in the same group as
those who produce such
bubble-gum trash as " My Schar
rona?" Disco sucks. The Knack
is worthless, and true New Wave
is much better.
