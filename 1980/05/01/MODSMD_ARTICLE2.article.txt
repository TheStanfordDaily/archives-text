Coffee House Inc., a student-led
corporation organized by the ASSU,
over the management of the Cof
fee House today, one month after win
ning a bid for the campus eatery's op
eration.
"We're opening low key so we can
work the bugs out and run as smoothly
as possible," ASSU Sen. Dick Butter
field. who chairs the board of directors
of Coffee House Inc., said yesterday.
Getting enough hired help has been
the biggest problem facing the infant
corporation. Hiring four new workers
and extending the number of work
hours of some employees has solved
the problem, Butterfield said.
The corporation is still looking for
new managers and will seek out stu
dents interested in working as coor
dinators. Students will be coordinating
the bookkeeping, programming and
advertising operations of the Coffee
House, according to Butterfield.
Aside from changes in employment
practices, the leaders of the new Coffee
House plan to:
— Decrease prices initially. Butter
field said the price of a cup of coffee
will drop from 30 cents to 25 cents and
the price of a sandwich from $2.25 to
$2. He said most price decreases would
range from 5 to 25 cents.
— Create a "cozier, brighter" at
mosphere and work on decoration of
the facility. Coffee House Inc. is spon
soring a mural contest and will install
"Casablanca-type fans" to permit bet
ter air circulation and to add to the
aesthetic appeal.
— Acquire a liquor license. The Cof
fee House will not be able to serve al
coholic beverages until the license is
processed. Butterfield said he would
ask the community to "bear with us"
for the first days of operation.
— Work with Student Arts at Stan
ford (STARTS) programming
student-oriented entertainment.
"Ourgoal is to make this (the Coffee
House) more of a student-faculty and
community gathering spot," Butter
field said. He emphasized the impor
tance of intellectual interaction at Stan
ford and said the new Coffee House
will try to foster that.
Butterfield said he "would like to see
more of a grand opening" in two
weeks. He said the project should be
running smoothly by then.
Coffee House Inc. is currently
operating on loans from ASSU. Butter
field declined, however, to estimate the
size of the loan.
