## Supervisor relations hurt 
### 
A lot of the problems of staff employment condi
tions pertain to performance evaluations. In this
column, I would like to provide some information
to supervisors about an evaluation technique they
can use. if they are not already doing so.
Very simply, supervisors can secretly solicit, re
ceive and rely on imputs of others in evaluating
their own staff. The employees being evaluated do
not have to be informed of who is to be consulted
about their performance, what is to be asked of
each interviewee, nor what the response of each
interviewee was. More importantly, the employee
does not have to have the opportunity to respond
to the inputs of each interviewee before the super
visor writes the evaluation.
As supervisors can readily see, this can be a very
valuable evaluation tool; it can also be a deadly
shaft for mal-intentioned supervisors and third
parties.
The evaluation method described above is, as we
say in the vernacular, legit. It has been endorsed by
the Office of Development, and by the University's
Employee Relations Office. I know this, having
been a victim of such a practice for two consecutive
years, and having unsuccessfully filed my second
grievance.
Even in the grievance, the University's hearing
officer admitted that he used the same technique.
Having admitted that he'd used the same evalua
tion procedure about which I was grieving, the
hearing officer did not see fit to disqualify himself
from the case, and the employee relations rep
resentative was not concerned.
l"he point of the grievance was to learn the ex
tent to which the Office of Development, and the
Personnel Office, would allow policies of fairness.

consistency and equity to be breached. What I
attempted to stress to the hearing officer then, and
to the University now, is that such an evaluation
policy, if it were to be popularized throughout the
University, would lead to very serious problems.
Morale will continue to decline; backbiting
among staff will proliferate; productivity will de
cline. This kind of cowardice in performance
evaluation should not be allowed or encouraged.
The University will suffer eventually, if it is fer
tilized.
The University's respect for staff has declined,
and it has declined dramatically and drastically
during the so-called Lyman Decade. There are
employee hostages in almost every building and
office on campus, hostages of all ages and both
sexes. The hostages are being held by supervisors
(some, not all) who can inflict "lead poisoning"
with a single stroke of a pencil.
At the same time there are hostages of color. .
Somehow the national media, in reporting Pres
ident Richard Lyman's move to the Rockefeller
Foundation, wrote of his improving opportunities
for minorities at Stanford. He may have done much
here, but increasing opportunites for blacks on the
staff has not been one of his accomplishments. The
message to provide increased opportunities for
minorities, if there was ever one, never got down
from his office to the vice presidents, deans and
directors; at least it never got to the Office of
Development.
Without question, the Lyman Decade was one of
supervisor-employee decadence. The decade was a
tremendous setback to minority staff — what re
mains of it.
