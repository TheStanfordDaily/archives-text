## Public health needs our concern 
### 
Most of us don't think about our health till
we're siek, and we certainly don't think about
the health of the general public even when
they arc siek. We might applaud each other
for a daily run or trying to eat an apple a day.
but that's often the extent of it.
Such days of ignorance should be ended.

The public health needs not only our atten
tion but our concern and effort. Twenty per
cent of Americans will die of cancer that
could have been prevented. Most is due to
environmental causes, usually found in work
ing conditions. Here on the Farm you may
feel immune, but go to work in a major city or

a nuclear lab and you won't be so safe.
Pollution, radiation leaks and pesticides
are among the problems that are causing the
fall of public health. Yes. the damage done
by them is irreversible, but many future prob
lems can be stopped. Three Mile Island does
not need to reoccur.
We first need to switch our mentalities
from the focus of curing the sick to keeping
the healthy well. It is much easier to prevent
cancer than to cure it.
Air pollution and radiation aren't the end
of it. Agricultural chemicals and food addi
tives are far from being sufficiently regu
lated. But as we watch such harmful chemi
cals, we need to watch our callousness. Most
of us notice air pollution much less now than
five years ago — when air quality was much
better. Like everything else, it has to first
affect someone we know or ourselves before
we become outraged and try to fight against
it.
It is worth driving less-polluting cars and
watching the foods you eat. No, I am not
suggesting that you become a staunch veg
etarian and feel guilty for every Tab you have
swallowed. You don't even need to establish

residence at Ilie Good Earth. Just watch it.
Now I know most of us are trying. And it is
as frustrating as the problems of energy and
waste. But keep trying. Silence shouldn't be a
luxury, and neither should vegetables with
out pesticides. You don't have to accept toxic
odors — it's worth it to fight for yourself and
friends and grandchildren.
Do complain to city officials and regulat
ory agencies. They are much more sensitive
to what the public thinks than you probably
realize. Write your congressman and the
Food and Drug Administration about your
specific concerns. At least worry about the
products that harm the masses. Some things
such as food at least only initially harm the
user, but pesticides and loud noises cause
problems for all of us.
If environmental quality really does de
termine the measure of the public health,
then we must care about that quality. And we
must protect it. To wait until we have cancer,
and children with birth defects and deaf ears
is only stupidity.
