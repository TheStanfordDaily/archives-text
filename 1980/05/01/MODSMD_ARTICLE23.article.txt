## Why is Reagan sweeping the nation? 
### 
A liberal splash of Grecian
Formula, a generous application
of Poly Grip, a painstakingly af
fixed American flag lapel pin.
and he's ready for the star
spangled glimmer and glare of
yet another Hyatt Regency. En
circled by Secret Service agents,
he strolls briskly through the
hotel hall and darts into the
gaudy dining room where hun
dreds are paying hundreds to
hear him speak.
In his address he decries the
United State's loss of interna
tional status and prestige; he be
rates the Democratic administra
tion for inciting inflation and
skyrocketing interest rates; in
general, he evokes a turn-of
the-century, middle-class white
America, complacent nostalgia:
a time when America, unchal

lenged overseas, was mighty.
Fielding questions from the
press with "common man"
simplifications and charming
anecdotes, his relaxed style of
delivery stands in stark contrast
to the peanut farmer's jittery
oratory. This is the consummate
presidential candidate — glib,
disarmingly ingenuous, self
deprecating, on occasion even
sporting a feistiness reminiscent
of blustery Theodore Roosevelt.
(In reference to the Panama
Canal he declares: "We built it,
we paid for it, it's ours and we're
going to keep it!")
This is Ronald Reagan — the
near-septuagenarian out to
prove there's more to being a
senior citizen than collecting So
cial Security payments and hit
ting golf balls. Reagan is out to

win the presidency.
He is a man who, despite his
unabated and unmasked conser
vatism — indeed, because of it —
is mustering widespread support
among alienated Democrats and
independents. To what can one
attribute Reagan's popularity
and the growing consensus that
his nomination and election are
(shudder) "inevitable?"
The conservatism widely repu
ted to be "sweeping" the nation
is more of a psychological
backlash to a creeping sense of
inadequacy, failure and inferior
ity than a rational ideological
evolution. Humiliation in Iran,
ineffectiveness in Afghanistan, a
circle of European allies too de
pendent upon oil to exhibit more
than a token loyalty, runaway in
flation and a declining gross na
tional product growth rate — all
abet this sinking suspicion that
we may no longer be what we
once were.
The candidacy and image of
Reagan is an antidote to this
psychological crisis. His calls to
make America great "again," his
appeals as a stalwart of the
Grand Old Party (the party of
"main street, the small town, the
city neighborhood, the shop
keeper, the farmer, the cop on
the beat") assuage America's
fears and displace America's in
securities with illusory and
empty recollections of "happier
times." Reagan's appeal to nos
talgia detracts from and makes
less painful the subjective reali
zation that America is losing its
predominant position in the
world, to such an extent that the
inadequacy of the man himself is
obscured.
How conservative really is
America? Would the public tol
erate the reality of some of
Reagan's staunch but less
publicized policy positions? He
would abolish the minimum
wage. He opposes the Equal
Rights Amendment. He would
slash tens of billions of dollars
from social welfare legislation
and would return the programs
to state and local governments.
He even seeks to return to the
gold standard (a position so reac
tionary that it was the campaign
theme of William McKinley in
1K96!). Americans may want to
cut their income and property
taxes, but not at the expense of
Social Security and unemploy

ment compensation: America is
"contradictorily" conservative.
Although he endeavors to play
down his extremism, Reagan
cannot long disguise his intellec
tual shortcomings. While gover
nor of California, Reagan was
spoon-fed "mini-memos" on im
portant policy issues, given posi
tion papers that summarized
complicated aspects of impend
ing legislation.
John Sears, Reagan's former
campaign manager, often admits
that while working for the
former governor he was per
petually unaware of how much
this former host of "Death Val
ley Days" really grasped during
briefings. Reagan relies for his
decisions almost exclusively
upon the advice of a hefty staff of
renowned political and
economic experts — the list of
which reads like a Who's Who of
American Republican politics —
John Schlesinger, Arthur Burns,
William Simon, Milton Fried
man and others. If he is asked a
question for which he can best
construe a vague response,
Reagan apologizes profusely,
confessing that he has misplaced
his "8-by-10 card" on the sub
ject. Ambiguity and reliance
upon the opinions of others is not
the sort of independence of
judgment most American citi
zens would like to see in their
chief executive.
In short, due to America's ob
session with international set
backs and domestic economic
problems, the national psyche is
experiencing the "inferiority
complex" of a nation threatened
with a decline in global status.
Reagan serves as a psychological
remedy, the happy reminder of a
simpler and more confident past.
The proper focus of opposition
to Reagan, however, should not
be the irrelevant issue of age, but
rather the ideological orienta
tion he professes to espouse.
Were the American public to
examine Reagan's positions on
the critical issues and his ability
to respond to difficult problems,
without allowing nostalgia to
obscure the assessment of
Reagan's true qualifications for
the presidency, he would surely
not command the broad elec
toral support he now does.
