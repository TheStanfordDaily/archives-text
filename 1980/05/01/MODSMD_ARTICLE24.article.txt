From behind a desk covered
with neatly stacked papers and
sunlight, Emeritus Professor of
Philosophy John Goheen con
tinues his attempts to improve
the quality of the Stanford edu
cation, just as he has done for the
past 30 years. '
A distinguished, well
gfoomed figure, Goheen con
veys «n air of formality, yet his
warmth and sensitivity come
through in his soft speech and
engaging smile.
For the past six years, 73-
year-old Goheen has served as
the University's ombudsman.
His role is to examine and chan
nel the complaints and grie
vances of students and faculty, a
task that requires a great deal of
delicacy.
Describing the job as one
necessitating "a balancing act of
investigation," Jean Fetter, Pres

ident Richard Lyman's assistant,
said if she had to design the per
fect ombudsman, she could not
improve on Goheen.
"He possesses the ideal
characteristics of an om
budsman," Fetter *aid. "He
combines sensitivity,jind warmth
with the image of the elder
statesman and philosopher."
A student has provided Go
heen with another method of de
aling with the University's prob
lems.
One day when Goheen was
out of his office, a button and a
sticker reading, "Push this but
ton to make Stanford disappear"
were placed behind his dtjsk. As
of yet, he hasn't been forced to
use the button.
Continuing interest
Goheen said his interest in
students has been the primary
motivation for continuing in his
position as ombudsman.
This concern with students

?nd their relationship with the
faculty has played a major role in
Goheen's career at Stanford.
Goheen was instrumental in
the formation of the student ad
visinfe system, a program de
signed to foster a close, informal
relationship between faculty and
students.
Goheen said the system is con
stantly undergoing review.
"Problems arise when the fa
culty don't have enough time.
They're under pressure to write
and do research, and it becomes
hard for them to be generous
with their time."
The freshman seminar system
was also formulated by Goheen
to give a small group of students
the opportunity to get to know
their instructor, something that
is almost impossible in most in
troductory courses.
Main concern
Sara Stephenson, secretary to
the ombudsman, said that Go
heen's main concern is that stu
dents get a good education at
Stanford.
"He gives a lot toward this end
— certainly beyond the call of
duty," Stephenson said. "He is a
very human, very warm man,
and each person that comes into
the office is important to him."
Goheen is also a member of
the Honor Code Commission,
which is in charge of monitoring
the success of the code.'
Noting that honor code viola
tions have increased in recent
years, Goheen attributes this to
today's economic circumstances
and uncertainties.
"My impression is that under
the pressure of many things to
day, ' mainly pre-professional
pressure, people think they have

to have A's or B's and sometimes
feel they must take shortcuts to
get them," Goheen said with a
tinge of remorse.
Goheen contrasted contem
porary students with those of the
'60s, saying that students have
not been brought together by
: any issue since the traumatic
period of Vietnam.
'Didn't throw stones'
"I supported the student ac
tivism at the time," Goheen said.
"I didn't go out and throw
stones, but I supported it."
The stone-throwing reference
brought a big smile as Goheen
remembered a recently distri
buted Chaparral cartoon which
depicted him as a door
shattering super hero.
"Contrary to the comic strip,
I'm really not a violent person,"
Goheen said with a chuckle. "In
fact, I oppose violence in all
forms."
Prior to his assignment as om
budsman, Goheen had been
head of the Philosophy Depart
ment at Stanford for more than a
decade. Since his retirement in
1972, he has continued to teach
occasional courses, and is now
involved with the Structured
Liberal Education program
under the direction of Associate
Professor Mark Mancall.
Bill Uzgalis, a teaching assis
tant for Goheen's Greek
philosophy course in 1978, said
he was impressed by Goheen's
tremendous rapport with his stu
dents and his continued recon
sideration of the material.
"I'd come in early to classes
and he'd be sitting there reading
the book, trying to figure things
out, even though he'd been
teaching the course for years,"
Uzgalis said. "It showed he was
still thinking about the material
and not just coasting."

In his 30 years as a professor at
Stanford, Goheen said he has de
veloped a definite philosophical
outlook on life. He hesitated to
describe it. however, explaining
that he would have to write, a
book to make it clear.
"I hesitate to describe it in
terms of 'isms' such as 'idealism'
or 'structuralism' just because
'isms' are loaded with am
biguity," Goheen said.
Teaching emphasis
II he has time. Goheen said, he
someday hopes to write that
book. He has published many
other works, but looking back
over his career, he said it has
been characterized by administ
ration and teaching.
Sitice his retirement eight
years ago, Goheen said he has
carried on much as always.
Friends say his wile's death two
years ago affected him deeply,
but he has remained active in the
Stanford community and now
teaches and serves on numerous
committes.
He is a member of the Emeriti
Undergraduate Council. Its
purpose, according to Dean of
Undergraduate Studies Herant
Katchudourian, is "to fulfill a un
ique role as teachers of other
teachers and as counselors to
those of us who help shape in
stitutional policy."
In the words of Philosophy
Department Chairman John
Perry. "We still rely on Goheen's
judgment and sound wisdom lor
advice."
Goheen is more than content
with his present situation.
"I like to spend a great deal of
time with people," Goheen said,
"mainly my family and closest
friends.
"Of course the most important
thing," he said with a smile, "is
that 1 enjoy what I'm doing."

From behind a desk covered
with neatly stacked papers and
sunlight, Emeritus Professor of
Philosophy John Goheen con
tinues his attempts to improve
the quality of the Stanford edu
cation, just as he has done for the
past 30 years. '
A distinguished, well
gfoomed figure, Goheen con
veys «n air of formality, yet his
warmth and sensitivity come
through in his soft speech and
engaging smile.
For the past six years, 73-
year-old Goheen has served as
the University's ombudsman.
His role is to examine and chan
nel the complaints and grie
vances of students and faculty, a
task that requires a great deal of
delicacy.
Describing the job as one
necessitating "a balancing act of
investigation," Jean Fetter, Pres

ident Richard Lyman's assistant,
said if she had to design the per
fect ombudsman, she could not
improve on Goheen.
"He possesses the ideal
characteristics of an om
budsman," Fetter *aid. "He
combines sensitivity,jind warmth
with the image of the elder
statesman and philosopher."
A student has provided Go
heen with another method of de
aling with the University's prob
lems.
One day when Goheen was
out of his office, a button and a
sticker reading, "Push this but
ton to make Stanford disappear"
were placed behind his dtjsk. As
of yet, he hasn't been forced to
use the button.
Continuing interest
Goheen said his interest in
students has been the primary
motivation for continuing in his
position as ombudsman.
This concern with students

?nd their relationship with the
faculty has played a major role in
Goheen's career at Stanford.
Goheen was instrumental in
the formation of the student ad
visinfe system, a program de
signed to foster a close, informal
relationship between faculty and
students.
Goheen said the system is con
stantly undergoing review.
"Problems arise when the fa
culty don't have enough time.
They're under pressure to write
and do research, and it becomes
hard for them to be generous
with their time."
The freshman seminar system
was also formulated by Goheen
to give a small group of students
the opportunity to get to know
their instructor, something that
is almost impossible in most in
troductory courses.
Main concern
Sara Stephenson, secretary to
the ombudsman, said that Go
heen's main concern is that stu
dents get a good education at
Stanford.
"He gives a lot toward this end
— certainly beyond the call of
duty," Stephenson said. "He is a
very human, very warm man,
and each person that comes into
the office is important to him."
Goheen is also a member of
the Honor Code Commission,
which is in charge of monitoring
the success of the code.'
Noting that honor code viola
tions have increased in recent
years, Goheen attributes this to
today's economic circumstances
and uncertainties.
"My impression is that under
the pressure of many things to
day, ' mainly pre-professional
pressure, people think they have

to have A's or B's and sometimes
feel they must take shortcuts to
get them," Goheen said with a
tinge of remorse.
Goheen contrasted contem
porary students with those of the
'60s, saying that students have
not been brought together by
: any issue since the traumatic
period of Vietnam.
'Didn't throw stones'
"I supported the student ac
tivism at the time," Goheen said.
"I didn't go out and throw
stones, but I supported it."
The stone-throwing reference
brought a big smile as Goheen
remembered a recently distri
buted Chaparral cartoon which
depicted him as a door
shattering super hero.
"Contrary to the comic strip,
I'm really not a violent person,"
Goheen said with a chuckle. "In
fact, I oppose violence in all
forms."
Prior to his assignment as om
budsman, Goheen had been
head of the Philosophy Depart
ment at Stanford for more than a
decade. Since his retirement in
1972, he has continued to teach
occasional courses, and is now
involved with the Structured
Liberal Education program
under the direction of Associate
Professor Mark Mancall.
Bill Uzgalis, a teaching assis
tant for Goheen's Greek
philosophy course in 1978, said
he was impressed by Goheen's
tremendous rapport with his stu
dents and his continued recon
sideration of the material.
"I'd come in early to classes
and he'd be sitting there reading
the book, trying to figure things
out, even though he'd been
teaching the course for years,"
Uzgalis said. "It showed he was
still thinking about the material
and not just coasting."

In his 30 years as a professor at
Stanford, Goheen said he has de
veloped a definite philosophical
outlook on life. He hesitated to
describe it. however, explaining
that he would have to write, a
book to make it clear.
"I hesitate to describe it in
terms of 'isms' such as 'idealism'
or 'structuralism' just because
'isms' are loaded with am
biguity," Goheen said.
