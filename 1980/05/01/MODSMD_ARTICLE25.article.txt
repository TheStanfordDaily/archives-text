â€” Put away the books, summer
students. Forget the lectures, the
all-night cramming and exhaust
ing final exams. Instead, go out
side and get some "hands-on
education."
That's what staffers at Expedi
tion Training Institute call their
program, which offers up to
three college credits for such
courses as trekking up Kenya's
Mount Kilimanjaro,, bicycling
through literary Ireland or study
ing sea otters from a kayak in an
Alaskan bay.
Lowell Thomas and his
Explorers' Club founded the
non-profit institute in as a
placement service for outdoor
programs. Three years later, di
rector James Elder and three
others began organizing their
own expeditions, working out of
a large, waterfront mansion.
So far, 1500 students have
signed up, traveling north to the
Arctic Circle and south to
Patagonia. Chile.
Oil spill
This year, expeditions will
leave at the end of June to study

effects of the oil spill in the Gulf
of Mexico, mountaineering in
the Cascades, mountain sheep
and sea otters in Alaska, alpine
ecology in Morocco and tropical
mountain ecology in Guatemala.
The basic theory of ETI is
"experiential learning," or
"hands-on education," Elder
said. But ETI differs from scien
tifically oriented schools like
Earthwatch, where members pay
to work with scientists on re
search projects. ETI considers it
self primarily an outdoor school.
Students between the ages of
16 and 26 are taught various
skills, then given time to conduct
experiments or test their new

"Our primary motivation is to
educate young people, not to
fund research," said Elder, 28,
who earned degrees in
philosophy and religion at Col
gate, then worked as an Outward
Bound instructor in Kenya and
North Carolina. "We're less
concerned with findings than we
are in the teaching process."
ETl's curriculum is loosely
structured, and Elder is always
recruiting leaders with new
ideas. Elder gives them nearly
free rein for expeditions.
ETI also works with hand
icapped students, giving them
what Elder called outdoor

therapy. A group of blind chil
dren went rock climbing, com
plete with technical equipment,
and a group of deal youngsters
spent four days sailing the insti
tute's 71-foot ketch from Provi
dence, R. 1., to Manchester,
Mass.
Massachusetts approached the
institute last year with a $50,000
grant to work with juvenile de
linquents. Graduates now in
clude convicted rapists, armed
robbers and one boy accused of
manslaughter.
Tuition for each three- to
four-week course averages
$900, which includes all food
and group equipment.
