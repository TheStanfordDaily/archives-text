Now that the first stages of
baring housing draw are past
Jrid the dream of where you
•light want to live has turned
Jpto a disillusioned acceptance of
•here you might have to live, it is
Serhaps appropriate to consider
SJhat might be done to improve
Ate policies and procedures of
lie housing system.
ff This is just what an ASSU task
fcrce on the housing system and
Hie draw has been formed to do.
According to ASSU Deputy
•hairperson Yvonne Hilt/., a
Committee made up of Bruce Zi
fian from COSS-R (The Commit-
Ce on Services to Students —
Residences). Sonja Johnson,
fiudent assistant to the
Gmsbudsman's Office and Hilt/
fcrself held se\ eral meetings last
ttiarter to discuss problems with
Ae housing system and to
*ggest possible solutions.
J They have come up with four
Suggestions that. Hilt/ said, "are
ly suggestions that, if proven
iasible. will require student in
prest and input for future im
■ementation."
■ The first of these four sugges
■ms concerns the possibility of
A optional roommate priority
students who would prefer to
Iwc together in a less desirable
honse rather than live apart in
their first or second choice
lx»«ise. According to Sonja
lilinson. this priority "would he
i ptional in that students that
c raw together or in a group and
t lat have the same choices listed
ii the same order on their draw
c irds would be able to choose
ether to accept an assignment
c nly where the .entire group
c iuld be placed, or to accept
s nglv the best assignment that
t leir individual priorities and
u larantee standings will afford
t iem."
• This particular suggestion.
.l|hnson said, was the direct re
sult of complaints that she had
received in the Omsbudsman's
C ffice from students who felt
tl at "what was important in
h using was the person or per
s< ns with whom you share a
r< om and not the house itself."
A * the housing system works
n w. the place takes precedence
o'er the person.
jThe second suggestion was

geared toward ameliorating the
"bad luck syndrome," whereby a
student having once drawn
poorly finds it continually dif
ficult to obtain what he or she
considers good housing.
To eradicate this syndrome,
the committee suggested that
draw numbers be divided into
two groups — from one to 2500
and 2501 to 5000 — and that,
depending on what number a
person drew the preceeding
year, he or she would draw from
the other group in the currfent
year.
Hilt/ pointed out that there
are problems with this sugges
tion in that "freshmen would
have to be accounted for in a
separate draw that would have to
take place prior to the general
draw."
Freshmen would draw from
the entire group of numbers —
from 1 to 5000. Non-freshmen
would subsequently draw from
one of the two number groups.
Hilt/ also admitted that this is
not an altogether \ iable solution
in that high priority would still
cancel eligibility based on a per
son's draw number.
In the interest of diversity , the
task force also suggested that

there be a two-year residency
limit set on all dorm and Row
houses — that is. that a person
could live only two years in one
residence and woufd have to
choose alternate housing for his
or her remaining years at Stan
ford.
There was also discussion
about the current policy toward
unguaranteed students who. by
virtue of their draw numbers, are
placed in the assignable group
along with the guaranteed stu
dents.
Hilt/ commented th.it tins pol
icy is "unfair to the guaranteed
students" and that perhaps it
would be better "to ha\ e the un
guaranteed students tacked on to
the end of the assignable group
instead of thrown in with the
guaranteed students for equal
consideration."
As it is now. once a student
gets into the assignable group, he
or she is eligible for on-campus
housing regardless of guarantee
standing.
Tins quarter, the task force
hopes to research these and other
suggestions, and then compile a
report for the Office of Residen
tial Education lor consideration
in their yearly review of the

housing system. Hilt/ stressed
the need tor active student in
terest and input in order to de
velop realistic insights and im
provements in the current As
tern.
Although they ha\ e gotten > il
to ,i slow start this quarter. Hilt/
said, "The task force plans a
uiorough study ot the housing
problem, including a survey on
housing similar to the \SSI> sur
\e\s on lighting, safety and re
creational facilities conducted
earliei this year."
Sonja Johnson emphasized
the fact that the task force is de
signed as a communication
liaison between the student body
and the administration. She
urged that "students should not
just sit around and passively
gripe about the inequities of the
system, but should let the ad
ministration know their feelings,
needs and wants through the
ASSU task force."
Hie ASSU task force on hous
ing and the draw meets Thurs
days at 2:15 p.m. in Tresidder.
Students with comments, sugges
tions or an interest in working
with the task force are urged to
attend or to leave their names

Now that the first stages of
baring housing draw are past
Jrid the dream of where you
•light want to live has turned
Jpto a disillusioned acceptance of
•here you might have to live, it is
Serhaps appropriate to consider
SJhat might be done to improve
Ate policies and procedures of
lie housing system.
ff This is just what an ASSU task
fcrce on the housing system and
Hie draw has been formed to do.
According to ASSU Deputy
•hairperson Yvonne Hilt/., a
Committee made up of Bruce Zi
fian from COSS-R (The Commit-
Ce on Services to Students —
Residences). Sonja Johnson,
fiudent assistant to the
Gmsbudsman's Office and Hilt/
fcrself held se\ eral meetings last
ttiarter to discuss problems with
Ae housing system and to
*ggest possible solutions.
J They have come up with four
Suggestions that. Hilt/ said, "are
ly suggestions that, if proven
iasible. will require student in
prest and input for future im
■ementation."
■ The first of these four sugges
■ms concerns the possibility of
A optional roommate priority
students who would prefer to
Iwc together in a less desirable
honse rather than live apart in
their first or second choice
lx»«ise. According to Sonja
lilinson. this priority "would he
i ptional in that students that
c raw together or in a group and
t lat have the same choices listed
ii the same order on their draw
c irds would be able to choose
ether to accept an assignment
c nly where the .entire group
c iuld be placed, or to accept
s nglv the best assignment that
t leir individual priorities and
u larantee standings will afford
t iem."
• This particular suggestion.
.l|hnson said, was the direct re
sult of complaints that she had
received in the Omsbudsman's
C ffice from students who felt
tl at "what was important in
h using was the person or per
s< ns with whom you share a
r< om and not the house itself."
A * the housing system works
n w. the place takes precedence
o'er the person.
jThe second suggestion was

geared toward ameliorating the
"bad luck syndrome," whereby a
student having once drawn
poorly finds it continually dif
ficult to obtain what he or she
considers good housing.
To eradicate this syndrome,
the committee suggested that
draw numbers be divided into
two groups — from one to 2500
and 2501 to 5000 — and that,
depending on what number a
person drew the preceeding
year, he or she would draw from
the other group in the currfent
year.
Hilt/ pointed out that there
are problems with this sugges
tion in that "freshmen would
have to be accounted for in a
separate draw that would have to
take place prior to the general
draw."
Freshmen would draw from
the entire group of numbers —
from 1 to 5000. Non-freshmen
would subsequently draw from
one of the two number groups.
Hilt/ also admitted that this is
not an altogether \ iable solution
in that high priority would still
cancel eligibility based on a per
son's draw number.
In the interest of diversity , the
task force also suggested that

there be a two-year residency
limit set on all dorm and Row
houses — that is. that a person
could live only two years in one
