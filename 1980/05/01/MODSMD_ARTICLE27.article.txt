NEW YORK — John Anderson's politics are
unfamiliar to many Americans, but those who
know something of the independent candidate
for president rate him one of the most liberal
contenders for the White House, an Associated
Press-NBC News poll says.
Despite the public's lack of familiarity with
Anderson, almost a third of those questioned
say they might vote for him in November. Not
surprisingly, in view of his image, his candidacy
gets the best reception from liberals and those
who say they are neither Republicans nor
Democrats.
The AP-NBC News poll was taken Friday
and Saturday. Telephone interviews with 1603
adults nationwide make up the basis.
Thirty-five percent of those questioned said
they know enough about the Illinois con
gressman to have an opinion of him. Sixty-five
percent said they were not familiar with him.
No other major presidential candidate is so
much of a mystery to the public. Fifty-six per
cent said they were unfamiliar with George
Bush; 22 percent were unfamiliar with Sen.
Edward Kennedy and 17 percent were unfamil
iar with Ronald Reagan.
Forty percent called Anderson a liberal; 29
percent, a moderate; and 20 percent, a conser
vative.
Only Kennedy, of the major active candi
dates, is viewed as more liberal than Anderson.

Sixty-five percent of those familiar with Ken
nedy said he is a liberal, 14 percent said he is a
moderate and 12 percent said he is conserva
tive.
Reagan is rated the most conservative ot all
the candidates. Sixty-two percent said he is con
servative; 17 percent moderate and 14 percent
liberal. In each case, the remainder were not
sure.
Asked about the possibility of voting tor An
derson in November. 32 percent said it was very
likely or somewhat likely they would cast their
ballots for the Illinois congressman. Sixty-two
percent said it was not likely they would vote tor
him, and 6 percent were not sure.
Those who know about Anderson were more
likely to think of voting for him. Forty-one per
cent of that group said it was likely they would
vote for him.
As with all sample surveys, the results of the
AP-NBC News poll can vary from the opinions
of all Americans because of chance variations in
the sample.
For polls with more than 1600 interviews, the
results should vary no more than three percen
tage points because of sampling error.
Of course, the results could differ from the
other polls for a number of other reasons. Dif
ferences in the exact wording of the questions,
the timing of the interviews and how the inter
views were conducted could also cause varia
tions.
