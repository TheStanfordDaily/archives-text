SAN ANTONIO. Texas — There
were those at Brooke Army Medical
Center who thought that Sen. Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass) had no business
there.
There were plenty who thought his
visit was politically motivated. And
there were others who were convinced
the senator. President Jimmy Carter's
rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, was making a humanitarian
gesture when he visited four servicemen
wounded in the attempt to free the
American hostages in Iran.
Kennedy , stumping for votes and de
legates in Saturday's Democratic prim
ary. abruptly shifted his schedule during
a campaign stop Tuesday to spend about
30 minutes with the men just a day after

the president visited their ward.
The people at Brooke said they would
not be the least bit surprised to see First
Lady Rosalynn Carter or Republican
hopeful George Bush, both scheduled
for San Antonio campaign stops this
week, also pay their respects to the
commandos burned in a helicopter
transport plane collission.
Mixed reception
"It doesn't hurt to get on national
television showing sympathy to gallant
guys who risked their lives." said Pvt.
Brian Uhler. a military policeman on
duty for the Kennedy stop-through.
"Yeah, but the president's
commander-in-chief, he had to visit the
troops." said his MP companion, Albert
Hailey.
Lora Harrison, who said she wouldn't
want Kennedy as president under any

circumstances, said he had "no busi
ness" coming to the hospital.
"It's like he woke up this morning and
decided he had to do something," she
said. "Now, Carter, I'm real glad he
came. But he looked so peaked."
Airman 1C Thomas Hartman. hos
pitalized at Brooke with a blood clot in
his lung, decided that Kennedy's visit
was "a nice thing."
"The fact that he was in San Antonio
on a political campaign doesn't make it
less sincere," he said. "And Carter, that
was an honorable thing and really spe
cial because he didn't have to. I'm really
glad everyone's treating the guys the
way they are. I know they're really dis
appointed they couldn't go ahead and
do the job."
Politics played down
Spectators outside Brooke said that

Kennedy made an effort to make his
visit non-political. He turned down
pleas that he address an applauding
crowd of about I 50 and left the hospital
without comment. Press coverage was
limited to a small pool selected from
wire services and local media.
A busload of reporters traveling with
the candidate was shuttled off to the
airport while Kennedy made his visit.
The senator has repeatedly stated his
support of Carter's abortive raid, saying
there is "no issue" between them on that
subject.
Kennedy, wearing a surgical robe and
mask, spoke alone to Air Force Staff
Sgt. Joseph Byers. who is in critical con
dition in the intensive care unit. Then he
and his wife Joan spoke to Maj. Leslie
Petty and Maj. James Sehaefer, Jr.. both
of the Marine Corps, and Air Force l.t.

Jeffrey Harrison.
I.auds rescue try
He told the men they were "heroes"
and praised their effort to free the hos
tages, an aide said. He was accompanied
by Brig. Gen. Andre Ognibenc. Brooke
commanding officer, and Col. Basil
Pruitt, Jr., commander of the burn
center.
"It was justa private visit. Nopolitical
hay," said Dußois. Maj. Chauncey
Spencer concluded that the visit was
"humanitarian."
"It might have been political if he had
spoken to the crowd, but he didn't." he
said.
Kennedy said later that he knew his
own stop might seem a political ploy but
added, "this is something I feel very
strongly about, and I wasn't going to be
dissuaded."
