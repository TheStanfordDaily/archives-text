## Ensor prints on exhibit here 
### 
An exhibition of prints by-
James Ensor will be on view at
the Stanford Museum of Art
from April 25 through June 1.
Included are some 120 etchings
by this major Belgian artist, who
died in 1949. The only West
Coast showing of this com
prehensive collection will be at
the museum as part of the celeb
ration of Belgium Today.
The exhibition clearly illus
trates the full range of Ensor's
printmaking, which encompas
ses both poetic landscapes and
savage satires. He began
printmaking in 18N6, when his
mature style had already de
veloped. During the next dozen
years Ensor made virtually all his
prints. He worked in two veins
simultaneously: while his land
scapes pay homage to the tradi
tion of Dutch 17th century art,
his satires recall the grotesque
themes found in works by Bosch
and Goya.
Ensor's work is extremely per
sonal. peopled with skeletons,
monsters and masks. His religi

ous scenes, often simple and
powerful, reveal his familiarity
with Rembrandt's work. Christ is
frequently the center of these
scenes. Ensor obviously iden
tified with Christjn feeling mis
understood and persecuted. On
occasion Ensor endowed Christ
with his own features.
Ensor's life was passed in the
provincial coastal town of Os
tend. There, in a claustrophobic
and anxiety-ridden atmosphere,
he lived with his parents who ran
a small gift shop. He good
naturedly ridiculed the bathers
who flocked to the beaches each
summer.
Ensor reserved his most sav
age attacks for the establish
ment, exposing incompetent
doctors, dishonest judges, cor
rupt bankers and politicians
alike. Alter 1900 he did little
important work, hut ironically
this rebel and taunter lived to be
come highly respected and ad
mired by the bourgeoisie he so
hated.
