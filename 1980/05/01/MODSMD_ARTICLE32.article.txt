# Robben Ford : the inside story on the blues
## 
### 
Robben Ford sits cross-legged on the
carpeted floor backstage at the Keystone
Palo Alto, quietly restringing his electric
guitar. Robben and his band have just
finished a dazzling first set of jazz and
blues numbers for an appreciative Friday
night club crowd.
Robben is completely at ease as he pre
pares for a second set that includes mate
rial ranging from James Taylor to Billy
Paine, as well as traditional blues tunes.
"Cry Like a Baby" and "Baby, Take Me
by the Hand." Blessed with gentle dark
good looks, Robben looks much too
youngand tender to sing the blues so well.
An accomplished jazz and blues
guitarist. Robben has already achieved
national recognition for his first album.
The Inside Story. His versatile musical
style creates a lively, upbeat and unique
electric jazz. As pure unadorned jazz, it
avoids electronic excesses of a Weather
Report or Tangerine Dream. Strongly

vocal-oriented, Robben's music makes
a smooth transition from easy jazz to the
gutsy blues numbers of the second set.
Robben is articulate and unpretentious
as he explains his musical beginnings. He
has been playing in the Bay area for years
since he and older brother Pat made the
southward trek from native Ukiah. Ironi
cally, this marvel on the guitar first started
out on the saxophone. A longtime fan of
the Rolling Stones and the Beatles, it
wasn't until he heard the exciting guitar
work of Mike Bloomfield that Robben
began to see the full potential of the in
strument. Always precocious, he began
his career on the guitar at 13.
Asked about his affinity for the blues,
Robben says the attachment is a musical
rather than purely psychological one. He
points out that blues players don't just do
the blues "to get down and dirty." The
blues are instead a source of musical en

joyment and self-expression for the
young guitarist.
"Eiverybody gets the blues," chuckles
Mark Ford who is relaxing with Robben
after making an impromptu appearance
as the fifth member iiis brother's band.
"Robben's love of t/e blues comes from
the three B's," explains Mark. Mike
Bloomfield, Elvin Bishop and the Butter
tield Blues Band were early critical influ
ences in charting Robben's musical out
look.
Robben agrees with his brother's
analysis and adds with an ingratiating
grin. "There's nothing like a good shuffle
and that's the blues too."
As far as future plans go, Robben hopes
to eventually do some film scoring, al
though he admits that adapting to a new
medium will be hard work. At a more
immediate level, he intends to continue
shifting from jazz instrumentals to

more vocally oriented songs. Robben says
that changing direction and expanding as
a lyricist have made material harder to
find. In spite of such difficulties, his sec
ond album is due out late this summer and
Robben says it's going to be good.
Robben hastens to add that retreating
from pure jazz is not a move calculated to
pursue a wider audience or to"make stars
out of the band." He doesn't want to
abandon his musical roots just to make a
commerical killing.
As a recording artist, Robben claims he
hasn't been affected by pressures to pro
duce profitable, popular music. Iliough
he says he is not fond of the Cars, Robben
sees strong, worthwhile musical elements
in New Wavegroups such as Sue Saad and
the Next. However. Robben Ford says he
is one man who is not going to don an
electric-blue tie to keep up with the com
petition.
