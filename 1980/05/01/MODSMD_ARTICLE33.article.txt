What do two black women

ing on a high-school musical in
Brooklyn about 10 sears ago.
Second. they are performing to
gether at S p.m. Saturday in An
nenberg Auditorium as part of

"Our music comes from the
many places we've been to as
black women and lesbians in
America." said J. Casselberry,

acoustic guitar. She was the cast
ing director of that high-school
{production, which starred her fu
ture partner. Jaque Dupree. and
\*as scored and directed by Ste
vbn Grossman, who completes
Saturday's program.

miiMC for cultural 1\ diverse audi

ences. Casselberry-Dupree are

versatility and rapport with lis
teners.

grew in demand until it became
an underground hit.
