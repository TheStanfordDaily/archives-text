Weiss has high expectations

"I hope the dancers will pro

they are doing and their love for
the craft. They are sincere in
what they have to say. We are a
young growing movement, but
we have high standards." Weiss
said.
"It's a wonderful experience
to have the alumnae come back
to dance. A close group, they

have great respect for each other
and in each other's work." added
Weiss.
The program begins with an
improvisational piece depicting
the procedure a dancer follows in
preparing for a performance.
The program then weaves
through a multitude of dances
with music ranging from Bach to
Moondog to the traditional dul
cimer music of John
McGlaughlin.
The themes of the dances are
varied. "The Initiate." the first
dance, was choreographed origi
nally in silence by Beth Johnson,
a graduate student, but was re
cently adapted to the music of
Gwendolyn Watson. Deidre
Toohey has choreographed a
dance which is a continuous
movement representing the
abstraction of fire. Entitled
"Lotus Flare." the dance is done
to the music of John
McGlaughlin. ••Seawall," which
takes place in a traditional fish
ing village, was choreographed
by Eugenia Haney and features
the music of Moondog. Several
other pieces are also on the prog
ram.
Tickets to the performances
are available through the Tre
sidder Box Office.
