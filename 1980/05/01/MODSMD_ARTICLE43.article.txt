Plan to return bodies challenged
TEHRAN — President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's chief
clerical rival yesterday challenged a government plan to
repatriate the charred bodies of eight American servicemen
and said that last week's abortive U.S. rescue mission could
raise new dangers for the hostages.
A ya toll ah Mohammad Beheshti. the chief of Iran's Sup
reme Court and a leading member of the ruling Revolutio
nary Council, also told a news conference that the rescue
attempt increased the possibility of hostage trials for the 50
Americans held by militant Moslem students since Nov. 4.
Asked if Iran would demand money from the United
States in return for the Americans' corpses following an
editorial in Beheshti's party newspaper suggesting that they
be held in Iran until Washington released frozen Iranian
assets, the ayatollah further confounded reporters by reply
ing: "The American government tells many of these kinds
of lies."
One of Bani-Sadr's aides said that despite Beheshti's
statement, a decision had been made on the repatriation
and that a plan was going ahead for Greek Catholic Ar
chibishop Hilarion Capudji to deliver the remains to the
International Red Cross in Switzerland for subsequent re
turn to their families in the United States, bypassing the
U.S. government.
Acquittal, mistrial end Lance case
ATLANTA — Former budget director Bert Lance,
whose forced departure from the federal government left
President Jimmy Carter close to tears, was found innocent
yesterday on nine counts of bank fraud.
The jury deliberated nine days. At one time, as many as
10 of the 12 jurors voted to convict Lance on two counts of

making false financial statements to a bank, one juror said
after the acquittal.
Jurors were unable to agree on those charges and one
other, U.S. District Judge Charles Moye declared a mistrial
on the three counts but said he would consider entering
acquittals after both sides submit briefs.
Lance was "delighted" by the outcome but said the two
year investigation and 16-week trial were "a total, abject
and ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money."
Lance, a long-time friend and confidant of Carter, res
igned his Cabinet-level post as director of the Office of
Management and Budget under congressional and public
pressure in September 1977.
Cuban influx stirs administration
KEY WEST, Fla. — More waves of refugees mixed with
convicts released from Cuban prisons swarmed ashore here
yesterday as the Carter administration worked to negotiate
an airlift to replace the illegal boat convoy between the
United States and Cuba.
More than /000 Cuban refugees have sailed to Florida
since the "Freedom Float" began last week. In the past two
days alone, about 1500 refugees checked in at the swamped
processing center here.
At a heiymg before the House Judiciary Committee in
Washington yesterday. Victor Palmieri, the State Depart
ment's coordinator for refugee affairs, said the administra
tion was considering seveal options in an attempt to bring
the refugee flood under control.
Christopher to remain deputy sec'y
WASHINGTON — Warren Christopher intends to re
main at the State Department as long as the new secretary.

Edmund Muskie, needs him — and then return to his law
practice in Los Angeles, department aides said yesterday.
Christopher, the acting secretary of state during the in
terim period until Muskie's confirmation vote, was former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's personal choice to succeed
him and was regarded by department officials as the most
likely nominee when the surprise choice of Muskie, the
senior Democratic senator from Maine, was announced
Tuesday.
Christopher, in particular, is reported "under heavy pres
sure" from President Jimmy Carter to stay on as deputy
secretary, and sources said yesterday that Muskie staff
members have begun calling Vance's senior aides to ask
them also to stay put. Christopher has been Vance's No. 2
man at the State Department since the Carter administra
tion took office in January 1977.
Carter ends 'Rose Garden 9 policy
WASHINGTON — Guess who is coming out of the Rose
Garden?
President Jimmy Carter, who vowed not to campaign
until the American hostages in Iran are released and who
for almost six months has imposed a near-total travel ban on
himself, abruptly changed those ground rules yesterday.
Carter told a group of civic leaders at the White House
yesterday that he plans to resume "a limited travel
schedule, including some campaigning if I choose."
But presidential aides, asserting that Carter already has
the nomination locked up, said politics was not the primary
reason for the change in tactics.
Rather, they said. Carter has concluded that the rescue
attempt amply demonstrated the United States' "serious
ness of intent" over the hostage issue, and that he could now

resume travel and campaigning without sending Iranian
authorities "the wrong signal" about his determination to
free the hostages.
In a news conference in Indianapolis, Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) said the president's decision "to come out
of the Rose Garden and face the American people ... is a
victory for the process and the political system."
House passes revenue-sharing cut
WASHINGTON — The House, aiming to balance the
fiscal 198 1 budget, upheld yesterday the proposed elimina
tion of $2.3 billion a year in federal revenue-sharing with
the states.
"Let the states raise their own money and fund their own
programs," thundered Rep. Robert Giaimo (D-Conn.), the
House Budget Committee chairman. "If we were down to
one program we had to destroy, it would be revenue
sharing. Now is the time for Congress to rise up and destroy
it."
The House then voted 225-192 to reject an effort by Rep.
Barber Conable (R-N.Y. ) to restore revenue-sharing funds
to the committee's proposed budget for the fiscal year be
ginning Oct. 1. Conable would have cut the so-called
categorical grants — money that states must spend on spe
cial projects ordered by Congress — instead of cutting
revenue-sharing funds, which can be spent at will.

ATLANTA — Former budget director Bert Lance,
whose forced departure from the federal government left
President Jimmy Carter close to tears, was found innocent
yesterday on nine counts of bank fraud.
The jury deliberated nine days. At one time, as many as
10 of the 12 jurors voted to convict Lance on two counts of

making false financial statements to a bank, one juror said
after the acquittal.
Jurors were unable to agree on those charges and one
other, U.S. District Judge Charles Moye declared a mistrial
on the three counts but said he would consider entering
acquittals after both sides submit briefs.
Lance was "delighted" by the outcome but said the two
year investigation and 16-week trial were "a total, abject
and ridiculous waste of taxpayers' money."
Lance, a long-time friend and confidant of Carter, res
igned his Cabinet-level post as director of the Office of
Management and Budget under congressional and public
pressure in September 1977.
Cuban influx stirs administration
KEY WEST, Fla. — More waves of refugees mixed with
convicts released from Cuban prisons swarmed ashore here
yesterday as the Carter administration worked to negotiate
an airlift to replace the illegal boat convoy between the
United States and Cuba.

since the "Freedom Float" began last week. In the past two
days alone, about 1500 refugees checked in at the swamped
processing center here.
At a heiymg before the House Judiciary Committee in
Washington yesterday. Victor Palmieri, the State Depart
ment's coordinator for refugee affairs, said the administra
tion was considering seveal options in an attempt to bring
the refugee flood under control.
Christopher to remain deputy sec'y
WASHINGTON — Warren Christopher intends to re
main at the State Department as long as the new secretary.

Edmund Muskie, needs him — and then return to his law
practice in Los Angeles, department aides said yesterday.
Christopher, the acting secretary of state during the in
terim period until Muskie's confirmation vote, was former
Secretary of State Cyrus Vance's personal choice to succeed
him and was regarded by department officials as the most
likely nominee when the surprise choice of Muskie, the
senior Democratic senator from Maine, was announced
Tuesday.
Christopher, in particular, is reported "under heavy pres
sure" from President Jimmy Carter to stay on as deputy
secretary, and sources said yesterday that Muskie staff
members have begun calling Vance's senior aides to ask
them also to stay put. Christopher has been Vance's No. 2
man at the State Department since the Carter administra
tion took office in January 1977.
Carter ends 'Rose Garden 9 policy
WASHINGTON — Guess who is coming out of the Rose
Garden?
President Jimmy Carter, who vowed not to campaign
until the American hostages in Iran are released and who
for almost six months has imposed a near-total travel ban on
himself, abruptly changed those ground rules yesterday.
Carter told a group of civic leaders at the White House
yesterday that he plans to resume "a limited travel
schedule, including some campaigning if I choose."
But presidential aides, asserting that Carter already has
the nomination locked up, said politics was not the primary
reason for the change in tactics.
Rather, they said. Carter has concluded that the rescue
attempt amply demonstrated the United States' "serious
ness of intent" over the hostage issue, and that he could now

resume travel and campaigning without sending Iranian
authorities "the wrong signal" about his determination to
free the hostages.
In a news conference in Indianapolis, Sen. Edward Ken
nedy (D-Mass.) said the president's decision "to come out
of the Rose Garden and face the American people ... is a
victory for the process and the political system."
House passes revenue-sharing cut
WASHINGTON — The House, aiming to balance the
fiscal 198 1 budget, upheld yesterday the proposed elimina
tion of $2.3 billion a year in federal revenue-sharing with
the states.
"Let the states raise their own money and fund their own
programs," thundered Rep. Robert Giaimo (D-Conn.), the
House Budget Committee chairman. "If we were down to
one program we had to destroy, it would be revenue
sharing. Now is the time for Congress to rise up and destroy
it."
The House then voted 225-192 to reject an effort by Rep.
Barber Conable (R-N.Y. ) to restore revenue-sharing funds
to the committee's proposed budget for the fiscal year be
ginning Oct. 1. Conable would have cut the so-called
categorical grants — money that states must spend on spe
cial projects ordered by Congress — instead of cutting
revenue-sharing funds, which can be spent at will.
Trading quiet, close mostly higher
NEW YORK — The stock market rallied near the close
of a slugfgish session to finish mostly higher yesterday.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more
than 6 points in early trading, was up 5.97 to 817.06 by the
close.
Plan to return bodies challenged
TEHRAN — President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr's chief
clerical rival yesterday challenged a government plan to
repatriate the charred bodies of eight American servicemen
and said that last week's abortive U.S. rescue mission could
raise new dangers for the hostages.
A ya toll ah Mohammad Beheshti. the chief of Iran's Sup
reme Court and a leading member of the ruling Revolutio
nary Council, also told a news conference that the rescue
attempt increased the possibility of hostage trials for the 50
Americans held by militant Moslem students since Nov. 4.
Asked if Iran would demand money from the United
States in return for the Americans' corpses following an
editorial in Beheshti's party newspaper suggesting that they
be held in Iran until Washington released frozen Iranian
assets, the ayatollah further confounded reporters by reply
ing: "The American government tells many of these kinds
of lies."
One of Bani-Sadr's aides said that despite Beheshti's
statement, a decision had been made on the repatriation
and that a plan was going ahead for Greek Catholic Ar
chibishop Hilarion Capudji to deliver the remains to the
International Red Cross in Switzerland for subsequent re
turn to their families in the United States, bypassing the
U.S. government.
