# Researcher talks about house based on self-reliant lifestyle

The environment cannot be improved unless the gen
eral public changes its values, said Robert Goodman of
the Farallones Institute, an environmental research
group, in a presentation Tuesday night.
"People must see something that confronts their
taboos." continued Goodman, a professor at UC-
Berkeley. "Then they will see the importance of de
veloping a whole new environmental ethic."
Goodman spoke in conjunction with Environment
Week. The Annenberg Auditorium audience also heard
Keith Bray from the Solar Cal Council's Local Govern
ment Commission on Renewable Resources speak on
the Davis Village homes, a solar project in Davis.
Goodman's talk and slide show centered around the
Integral Urban House, a project he has been involved
with since its beginning in 1974.
Self-reliant
The house, a center for classes, workshops and re
search on self-reliant urban living, is located in Berkeley.
The structure is an old Victorian house that has been
transformed into a living unit almost entirely reliant on
passive energy sources.
Solar systems serve 95 percent of the house's heat and
hot water needs, and solar appliances, such as the oven,
are used almost daily in place of conventionally powered
ones.
The gardqp, which includes an agricultural pond,
supplies 65 to 85 percent of the food for the staff of three
that lives in the house as well as lunch each day for 10 to
12 people.
Interdependence
Goodman's goal, however, is not complete indepen
dence from outside resources. "We are not trying to be
self-sufficient. We are trying to be self-reliant. We are
definitely in contact with our community and other re
sources."
He also emphasized the integrated aspect of the
house's systems, citing the compost bins as perhaps the
"heart" of the house and the emblem of this idea. Inter
dependence is evidenced in seemingly small things: the
passive fly trap hangs above the agricultural pond, so
that dead flies can fall down and feed the fish.
"Probably you wouldn't have all the things in your
house that we have," added Goodman. He prefaced his

talk with a request to the audience to "think of what
you'll see here as questions, not answers."
Efficient
Bray spoke on one group's answer to the need for
urban self-reliance on a larger scale. He termed the
Davis Village homes "a total energy-efficient neighbor
hood." ,
Located in Davis, this community was constructed
with the goal of making optimum use of energy-efficient
design features to conserve energy. These include an
active solar heating system in each of the 200 homes and
40 apartments as well as multiple passive design fea
tures.
Passive design features include roof overhangs de
signed to admit maximum winter sunlight and a
minimum amount in summer, a north-south orientation
for all homes, and availability of community services and
activities to eliminate the need for people to get in their
cars and go outside the area.
Upcoming Environment Week events include a trip to
the Davis Village homes and displays on environmental
concerns set up by Stanford, Bay area and national
groups.
Events
A slide show of Mono Lake, a volcamic lake in eastern
California which is being drained in order to supply
Southern California, will be held today, as will a speech
by Bob Scowcroft, organizer for Friends of the Earth.
"A giant canvas-covered ball, painted like a globe"
will be used in the "ne,w games" to be played on the
White Plaza lawn today at noon, said Martha Watson,
one of the Environment Week coordinators.
"One of the goals of Environment Week is to give
people a new perspective on working in their environ
ment," she said.
"New games," as non-competitive games, correspond
with the goals of Environment Week, for they show
people that working with the environment is not a com
petitive win/loss situation, said Watson. "It can be a
situation where everybody wins."
Environment Week is being sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, the Civil Engineering Department,
Stanford Energy Conservation, Stanford Engineering
Management Program, Synergy House and the U.S. En
vironment Protection Agency.

The environment cannot be improved unless the gen
eral public changes its values, said Robert Goodman of
the Farallones Institute, an environmental research
group, in a presentation Tuesday night.
"People must see something that confronts their
taboos." continued Goodman, a professor at UC-
Berkeley. "Then they will see the importance of de
veloping a whole new environmental ethic."
Goodman spoke in conjunction with Environment
Week. The Annenberg Auditorium audience also heard
Keith Bray from the Solar Cal Council's Local Govern
ment Commission on Renewable Resources speak on
the Davis Village homes, a solar project in Davis.
Goodman's talk and slide show centered around the
Integral Urban House, a project he has been involved
with since its beginning in 1974.
Self-reliant
The house, a center for classes, workshops and re
search on self-reliant urban living, is located in Berkeley.
The structure is an old Victorian house that has been
transformed into a living unit almost entirely reliant on
passive energy sources.
Solar systems serve 95 percent of the house's heat and
hot water needs, and solar appliances, such as the oven,
are used almost daily in place of conventionally powered
ones.
The gardqp, which includes an agricultural pond,
supplies 65 to 85 percent of the food for the staff of three
that lives in the house as well as lunch each day for 10 to
12 people.
Interdependence
Goodman's goal, however, is not complete indepen
dence from outside resources. "We are not trying to be
self-sufficient. We are trying to be self-reliant. We are
definitely in contact with our community and other re
sources."
He also emphasized the integrated aspect of the
house's systems, citing the compost bins as perhaps the
"heart" of the house and the emblem of this idea. Inter
dependence is evidenced in seemingly small things: the
passive fly trap hangs above the agricultural pond, so
that dead flies can fall down and feed the fish.
"Probably you wouldn't have all the things in your
house that we have," added Goodman. He prefaced his

talk with a request to the audience to "think of what
you'll see here as questions, not answers."
Efficient
Bray spoke on one group's answer to the need for
urban self-reliance on a larger scale. He termed the
Davis Village homes "a total energy-efficient neighbor
hood." ,
Located in Davis, this community was constructed
with the goal of making optimum use of energy-efficient
design features to conserve energy. These include an
active solar heating system in each of the 200 homes and
40 apartments as well as multiple passive design fea
tures.
Passive design features include roof overhangs de
signed to admit maximum winter sunlight and a
minimum amount in summer, a north-south orientation
for all homes, and availability of community services and
activities to eliminate the need for people to get in their
cars and go outside the area.
Upcoming Environment Week events include a trip to
the Davis Village homes and displays on environmental
concerns set up by Stanford, Bay area and national
groups.
Events
A slide show of Mono Lake, a volcamic lake in eastern
California which is being drained in order to supply
Southern California, will be held today, as will a speech
by Bob Scowcroft, organizer for Friends of the Earth.
"A giant canvas-covered ball, painted like a globe"
will be used in the "ne,w games" to be played on the
White Plaza lawn today at noon, said Martha Watson,
one of the Environment Week coordinators.
"One of the goals of Environment Week is to give
people a new perspective on working in their environ
ment," she said.
"New games," as non-competitive games, correspond
with the goals of Environment Week, for they show
people that working with the environment is not a com
petitive win/loss situation, said Watson. "It can be a
situation where everybody wins."
Environment Week is being sponsored by the ASSU
Speakers Bureau, the Civil Engineering Department,
Stanford Energy Conservation, Stanford Engineering
Management Program, Synergy House and the U.S. En
vironment Protection Agency.
