# More alumnae investigations of sorority rushees reported

More instances of checks by sorority
alumnae into Stanford women's
backgrounds during spring rush have
been reported this week, both to the
Daily and to University officials.
In addition to questioning parents of
women going through rush, represen
tatives from the National Panhellenic
Society — a group affiliated with
sororities and fraternities across the
country — have sought background in
formation on rushees from schools,
churches and employment contacts, a
national officer of the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority revealed yesterday.
These investigations first came to the
attention of the Daily following a letter
by freshman Carol Chesarek of Los
Gatos, who said mother had
been called during rush and asked what
Mr. Chesarek did for a Ming, whether
Mr. or Mrs. Chesarek had been in the
Green system in college and about
Carol's grades and high school ac
tivities. Carol called this search a "vio
lation of my individual rights," particu
larly since it had been conducted with
out her knowledge.
Since the Chesarek incident was re
ported to the Daily Monday, other re
ports have emerged. Diana Conklin,
director of row houses and fraternities,
said that she has also been contacted by
students resenting these checks.

It was originally thought that the
Chesarek check was an isolated inci
dent, or that the checks were limited to
the San Jose area. However, another
rushee from Washington state said that
her mother was also contacted for simi
lar information and, in addition, was
asked her daughter's SAT scores by a
woman claiming to need the informa
tion in connection with Theta rush.
Although it has still not been deter
mined which sorority requested the in
formation on Chesarek, apparently the
recommendation policies of the Thetas
have prompted numerous other calls,
both this year and since 1977.
In 1977 the Board of Trustees lifted
a 33-year ban on sororities, although it
did not grant official University recog
nition to the groups. This recognition is
necessary to hold meetingsorfunctions
on campus or to apply for housing, and
has been denied for various reasons,
including some of the groups' alumnae
recommendation policies.
Members of Stanford sororities, in
cluding the Thetas, have insisted
numerous times that the recommenda
tions sent by alumni are not in any way
involved in their selection procedures,
but that several sorority constitutions
make it mandatory for them to be col
lected.
So far, only the Thetas have been
linked to the phone calls.
Nancy Hoffman, president of the

Inter-Sorority Council here, Said she
was enraged at these calls and woyld
send a letter of apology to Mrs.
Chesarek.
"This is not only not Stanford soror
ity policy, it's not standard Panhellenic
policy," Hoffman said.
Norma Jorgensen, national rep
resentative to the Panhellenics for the
Thetas, said, contrary to these reports,
calling parents' homes is not against
National Panhellenic policy. The over
100 National Panhellenic chapters ac
ross the country often gather informa
tion for collegiate groups "as a ser
vice," Jorgensen said from Connec
ticut.
Jorgensen said that calling women's
homes is not the usual procedure, but
may be used as a last resort if there are
"no other sources of information."
Other sources include community
groups, church organizations and high
schools, she said.
"Schools are often very cooperative.
Many are most anxious to have women
graduating from their schools becoipe
involved in the Greek way of life if they
so desire it," she said.
Jorgensen said that academic infor
mation was collected to ensure that
women rushing the sororities would
not become too involved in the sorority
at the expense of their schoolwork. In
