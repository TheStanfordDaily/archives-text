# More alumnae investigations of sorority rushees reported
##

More instances of checks by sorority
alumnae into Stanford women's
backgrounds during spring rush have
been reported this week, both to the
Daily and to University officials.
In addition to questioning parents of
women going through rush, represen
tatives from the National Panhellenic
Society — a group affiliated with
sororities and fraternities across the
country — have sought background in
formation on rushees from schools,
churches and employment contacts, a
national officer of the Kappa Alpha
Theta sorority revealed yesterday.
These investigations first came to the
attention of the Daily following a letter
by freshman Carol Chesarek of Los
Gatos, who said mother had
been called during rush and asked what
Mr. Chesarek did for a Ming, whether
Mr. or Mrs. Chesarek had been in the
Green system in college and about
Carol's grades and high school ac
tivities. Carol called this search a "vio
lation of my individual rights," particu
larly since it had been conducted with
out her knowledge.
Since the Chesarek incident was re
ported to the Daily Monday, other re
ports have emerged. Diana Conklin,
director of row houses and fraternities,
said that she has also been contacted by
students resenting these checks.

It was originally thought that the
Chesarek check was an isolated inci
dent, or that the checks were limited to
the San Jose area. However, another
rushee from Washington state said that
her mother was also contacted for simi
lar information and, in addition, was
asked her daughter's SAT scores by a
woman claiming to need the informa
tion in connection with Theta rush.
Although it has still not been deter
mined which sorority requested the in
formation on Chesarek, apparently the
recommendation policies of the Thetas
have prompted numerous other calls,
both this year and since 1977.
In 1977 the Board of Trustees lifted
a 33-year ban on sororities, although it
did not grant official University recog
nition to the groups. This recognition is
necessary to hold meetingsorfunctions
on campus or to apply for housing, and
has been denied for various reasons,
including some of the groups' alumnae
recommendation policies.
Members of Stanford sororities, in
cluding the Thetas, have insisted
numerous times that the recommenda
tions sent by alumni are not in any way
involved in their selection procedures,
but that several sorority constitutions
make it mandatory for them to be col
lected.
So far, only the Thetas have been
linked to the phone calls.
Nancy Hoffman, president of the

Inter-Sorority Council here, Said she
was enraged at these calls and woyld
send a letter of apology to Mrs.
Chesarek.
"This is not only not Stanford soror
ity policy, it's not standard Panhellenic
policy," Hoffman said.
Norma Jorgensen, national rep
resentative to the Panhellenics for the
Thetas, said, contrary to these reports,
calling parents' homes is not against
National Panhellenic policy. The over
100 National Panhellenic chapters ac
ross the country often gather informa
tion for collegiate groups "as a ser
vice," Jorgensen said from Connec
ticut.
Jorgensen said that calling women's
homes is not the usual procedure, but
may be used as a last resort if there are
"no other sources of information."
Other sources include community
groups, church organizations and high
schools, she said.
"Schools are often very cooperative.
Many are most anxious to have women
graduating from their schools becoipe
involved in the Greek way of life if they
so desire it," she said.
Jorgensen said that academic infor
mation was collected to ensure that
women rushing the sororities would
not become too involved in the sorority
at the expense of their schoolwork. In
formation regarding activities and

hobbies is collected to assist local chap
ters in "getting to know the girl more
quickly."
Conklin has said that these kinds of
inquiries "will simply not be tolerated
at Stanford," and that none of the
sororities can hope to gain official rec
ognition here until they discard the re
commendation policies enforced by the
national constitutions.
Members of the seven sorority chap
ters here have insisted repeatedly that
they do not use the recommendations
in any way in their selection procedure.
Alisa Terrell, rush chairperson for
the Thetas, explained that alums
"think we need them (the recommen
dations), but we don't." Terrell added
that in any case where a girl does not
receive an alumni .recommendation, a
council within the chapter generally ex
tends a blanket recommendation to the
person, and no one in the sorority, ex
cept that council, is aware of who has
received a recommendation and who
has received the "blanket recommen
dations."
Terrell also outlined theTheta policy
which leads to the investigations by
misinformed alums. "Geographic
areas of the country are divided into
rush recommendations boards. We
waited until after the second open
house this rush and then sent letters to

local chapters requesting recommen
dations on the girls in their areas."
She added that there was no need for
the women to conduct investigations of
the kind experienced by Chesarek and
that "they are not supposed to call the
girl's mother in any event."
"The big question is whether these
alumnae are aware that they are not
supposed to do these kinds of things, or
whether they are aware, and they just
don't care," said Conklin.
Jorgensen said she could not under
stand why anyone should protest the
investigations, because the information
gleaned "could often be found in local
paper press clippings." When asked if
she had ever received any complaints
about invasion of privacy, Jorgensen
said, "Some alumni object because it
takes an awful lot of time."
Terrell said that there is definite sen
timent within the Thetas against the
recommendation policy. "We're talk
ing about drafting an amendment to
the national constitution to make re
commendations not mandatory," she
said.
Many local sorority members and
alumnae have expressed dismay at the
telephone calls to parents. Carol
Livingston, treasurer of the Palo Alto
Panhellenics, said the calls were inap
propriate and "simply not in good
taste. It's an unspoken rule that you
don't make direct contact," she said.
