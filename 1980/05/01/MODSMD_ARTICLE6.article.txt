# Education secretary tops in class at Stanford Law
## Hufstedler has 'sacks full of ideas' on education 
### Sara Lessley 
Staff Writer
Being appointed the nation's first
Secretary of Education isn't had for
someone who has never been an ad
ministrator, educator or Washington
bureaucrat, and who hasn't been back
to school since 1949.
But Shirley Mount Hufstedler hasn't
been idle since she graduated tenth in
her Stanford Law School class that
year.
When she went to the capital last
year to head the new Cabinet level de
partment, she left the post of Ninth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge
she has held since 1968. That appoint
ment — following positions as Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge
and Associate Justice of the, California
Court of Appeals — had made her the
highest ranking female jurist in the

country.
Hufstedler, 54, is also considered a
top contender for the next Supreme
Court opening — which would make
her the first woman appointed, to the
high court.
Pushing onward
The spark of drive and determina
tion that has carried her this far started
early. Born in Denver, Colorado in
1925, her early school years were con
stantly interrupted as the family moved
with her constructor father's changing
jobs during the Depression. But the
upheaval didn't seem to bother the
bright student. Just about the only sub
ject that troubled her — and still does
— was mixed fractions.
But a little difficulty with figures
didn't prevent her from earning her
bachelor's degree in business administ
ration from the University of New
Mexico in just 2Vi years — and still
with nearly a straight-A average.
Graduate work was next on her
agenda, even though she said as a
woman she found some career paths
blocked. She dropped the idea of a
foreign service career when she found
the opportunities for women were "ab
solutely nothing."

In a phone interview from
Washington, D.C., last week, she
explained, "The whole of society be
lieved devoutly that a woman's place
was definable — unlike a man's — in
the home rearing and bearing children.
I never accepted that, unlike most who
obeyed societal dictates."
Her decision to attend Stanford Law
School was no accident, she said.
Graduate school was definitely plan
ned; she had only to choose an area.
She said she "crossed medical school
off' her list because she could "neither
afford the time nor the tuition" to redo
virtually her entire undergraduate edu
cation.
She called Stanford "a good choice
for a graduate institution in many re
spects" and when she decided this was
the place, she applied nowhere else.
Small percentage
She entered law school in a large
class of some 260 students — five of
whom were women. (One of her
classmates was Warren Christopher,
deputy secretary of state.) Only two of
the women ultimately graduated.
The small number of women stu
dents was not surprising, according to


Shirley Hufstedler
Hufstedler. Even to law schools which
admitted women, "women failed to
apply in droves," she said. At the time,
women seldom comprised more than
one percent of a law class.
Hufstedler remembers "Stanford
and the rest of the world in 1946 as a
very different place from Stanford and
the rest of the world v in 1980."
The Farm more closely resembled its
older days as a farm, she said. She re
minisces about surrounding
municipalities as the "village" of Los
Altos, the "village" of Sunnyvale and
"almost a large village of San Jose."
She remembers a Santa Clara Valley
full of "magnificent almond and prune
orchards."
Spartan quarters
The Law School was essentially a
large classroom located in "very in
adequate quarters" in the Quad — and
the first-year instructors were forced to
teach double sessions to accommodate
the large class
While at Stanford, she worked on the
Law Review with its first president
Christopher and another studer>t, Seth
Hufstedler. After finishing law school
in 1949 — Seth Hufstedler, who
graduated first in his class — and Shir
ley were married.
Entering the male-dominated law
profession wasn't easy, but Hufstedler
said that wasn't so much the result of
prejudice against women.
Struggles
"There was prejudice in thesense of
not hiring . . . but I didn't feel the pre
judice of hiring because of my own
background. In my growing up, every
one had a terrible struggle to find
employment.
"During the great Depression diffi
culty in getting jobs happened to wo
men, but it also happened to men."
She said it was very clear the law
students would have to make their own
job market.
"When I graduated from law school
only one recruiter came to the Stanford

campus, and that was an FBI recruiter
looking for agents. There were no
other recruiters."
Hufstedler "made her own market"
in private practice, until she was ap
pointed to the bench in 1961, by
then-California Governor Pat Brown.
In a mid-life career change, her latest
appointment has placed her at the top

of the unwieldly new Cabinet depart
ment — a department with 1 50 existing
programs, six agencies, nearly 18,000
employees and a budget of some $14
billion.
The task doesn't seem to phase the
5-foot-2 secretary, who " has sack-fulls
of ideas about education" she hopes to
turn into policy while in office.

ley were married.
Entering the male-dominated law
profession wasn't easy, but Hufstedler
said that wasn't so much the result of
prejudice against women.
Struggles
"There was prejudice in thesense of
not hiring . . . but I didn't feel the pre
judice of hiring because of my own
background. In my growing up, every
one had a terrible struggle to find
employment.
"During the great Depression diffi
culty in getting jobs happened to wo
men, but it also happened to men."
She said it was very clear the law
students would have to make their own
job market.
"When I graduated from law school
only one recruiter came to the Stanford

campus, and that was an FBI recruiter
looking for agents. There were no
other recruiters."
Hufstedler "made her own market"
in private practice, until she was ap
pointed to the bench in 1961, by
then-California Governor Pat Brown.
In a mid-life career change, her latest
appointment has placed her at the top

of the unwieldly new Cabinet depart
ment — a department with 1 50 existing
programs, six agencies, nearly 18,000
employees and a budget of some $14
billion.
The task doesn't seem to phase the
5-foot-2 secretary, who " has sack-fulls
of ideas about education" she hopes to
turn into policy while in office.

Being appointed the nation's first
Secretary of Education isn't had for
someone who has never been an ad
ministrator, educator or Washington
bureaucrat, and who hasn't been back
to school since 1949.
But Shirley Mount Hufstedler hasn't
been idle since she graduated tenth in
her Stanford Law School class that
year.
When she went to the capital last
year to head the new Cabinet level de
partment, she left the post of Ninth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge
she has held since 1968. That appoint
ment — following positions as Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge
and Associate Justice of the, California
Court of Appeals — had made her the
highest ranking female jurist in the

country.
Hufstedler, 54, is also considered a
top contender for the next Supreme
Court opening — which would make
her the first woman appointed, to the
high court.
Pushing onward
The spark of drive and determina
tion that has carried her this far started
early. Born in Denver, Colorado in
1925, her early school years were con
stantly interrupted as the family moved
with her constructor father's changing
jobs during the Depression. But the
upheaval didn't seem to bother the
bright student. Just about the only sub
ject that troubled her — and still does
— was mixed fractions.
But a little difficulty with figures
didn't prevent her from earning her
bachelor's degree in business administ
ration from the University of New
Mexico in just 2Vi years — and still
with nearly a straight-A average.
Graduate work was next on her
agenda, even though she said as a
woman she found some career paths
blocked. She dropped the idea of a
foreign service career when she found
the opportunities for women were "ab
solutely nothing."

In a phone interview from
Washington, D.C., last week, she
explained, "The whole of society be
lieved devoutly that a woman's place
was definable — unlike a man's — in
the home rearing and bearing children.
I never accepted that, unlike most who
obeyed societal dictates."
Her decision to attend Stanford Law
School was no accident, she said.
Graduate school was definitely plan
ned; she had only to choose an area.
She said she "crossed medical school
off' her list because she could "neither
afford the time nor the tuition" to redo
virtually her entire undergraduate edu
cation.
She called Stanford "a good choice
for a graduate institution in many re
spects" and when she decided this was
the place, she applied nowhere else.
Small percentage
She entered law school in a large
class of some 260 students — five of
whom were women. (One of her
classmates was Warren Christopher,
deputy secretary of state.) Only two of
the women ultimately graduated.
The small number of women stu
dents was not surprising, according to


Shirley Hufstedler
Hufstedler. Even to law schools which
admitted women, "women failed to
apply in droves," she said. At the time,
women seldom comprised more than
one percent of a law class.
Hufstedler remembers "Stanford
and the rest of the world in 1946 as a
very different place from Stanford and
the rest of the world v in 1980."
The Farm more closely resembled its
older days as a farm, she said. She re
minisces about surrounding
municipalities as the "village" of Los
Altos, the "village" of Sunnyvale and
"almost a large village of San Jose."
She remembers a Santa Clara Valley
full of "magnificent almond and prune
orchards."
Spartan quarters
The Law School was essentially a
large classroom located in "very in
adequate quarters" in the Quad — and
the first-year instructors were forced to
teach double sessions to accommodate
the large class
While at Stanford, she worked on the
Law Review with its first president
Christopher and another studer>t, Seth
Hufstedler. After finishing law school
in 1949 — Seth Hufstedler, who
graduated first in his class — and Shir
