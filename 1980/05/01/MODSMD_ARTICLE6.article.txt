# Education secretary tops in class at Stanford Law
## Hufstedler has 'sacks full of ideas' on education

Being appointed the nation's first
Secretary of Education isn't had for
someone who has never been an ad
ministrator, educator or Washington
bureaucrat, and who hasn't been back
to school since 1949.
But Shirley Mount Hufstedler hasn't
been idle since she graduated tenth in
her Stanford Law School class that
year.
When she went to the capital last
year to head the new Cabinet level de
partment, she left the post of Ninth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals judge
she has held since 1968. That appoint
ment — following positions as Los
Angeles County Superior Court judge
and Associate Justice of the, California
Court of Appeals — had made her the
highest ranking female jurist in the

country.
Hufstedler, 54, is also considered a
top contender for the next Supreme
Court opening — which would make
her the first woman appointed, to the
high court.
Pushing onward
The spark of drive and determina
tion that has carried her this far started
early. Born in Denver, Colorado in
1925, her early school years were con
stantly interrupted as the family moved
with her constructor father's changing
jobs during the Depression. But the
upheaval didn't seem to bother the
bright student. Just about the only sub
ject that troubled her — and still does
— was mixed fractions.
But a little difficulty with figures
didn't prevent her from earning her
bachelor's degree in business administ
ration from the University of New
Mexico in just 2Vi years — and still
with nearly a straight-A average.
Graduate work was next on her
agenda, even though she said as a
woman she found some career paths
blocked. She dropped the idea of a
foreign service career when she found
the opportunities for women were "ab
solutely nothing."

In a phone interview from
Washington, D.C., last week, she
explained, "The whole of society be
lieved devoutly that a woman's place
was definable — unlike a man's — in
the home rearing and bearing children.
I never accepted that, unlike most who
obeyed societal dictates."
Her decision to attend Stanford Law
School was no accident, she said.
Graduate school was definitely plan
ned; she had only to choose an area.
She said she "crossed medical school
off' her list because she could "neither
afford the time nor the tuition" to redo
virtually her entire undergraduate edu
cation.
She called Stanford "a good choice
for a graduate institution in many re
spects" and when she decided this was
the place, she applied nowhere else.
Small percentage
She entered law school in a large
class of some 260 students — five of
whom were women. (One of her
classmates was Warren Christopher,
deputy secretary of state.) Only two of
the women ultimately graduated.
The small number of women stu
dents was not surprising, according to
