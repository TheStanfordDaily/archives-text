"If I look at this coolly and dispassionately," said
Nobel Laureate William Shockely, "I can see no
reason why . . . anyone I know is more likely to re
duce Negro agony, Negro misery, the tragedy for
American Negroes in the next generation than my
self."
Speaking on KZSU's Campus Conference Tuesday
night, the electrical engincer-turned-geneticist
explained his controversial views on differences in
intelligence between the races and discussed his re
cent contribution to a sperm bank for Nobel Prize
winners.
"It is a very tragic thing to face the possibility that
nature may have produced different races of human
beings with different capacities to succeed," Shockley
said.
In reference to welfare progrartis, Shockley
explained that "We may now be unwittingly produc
ing a situation in our country, with the noblest of

intentions, in which black competence is being de
creased from one generation to the next."
' Shockley's reasoning stems from his claim that the
poorest and least successful segments of the black
population have the highest fertility rates. Therefore,
the black population will contain a consistently in
creasing percentage of people who inherited their
genes from the least intelligent and capable members
of the race, resulting in a decline in the average intel
ligence of blacks over time.
To ameliorate this situation, Shockley proposed a
"sound, humane remedial measure" which he called
the "Voluntary Sterilization Bonus Plan." In this
scheme, persons would be offered a monetary reward
for having themselves sterilized. However, taxpayers
— who, according to Shockey, "might, on an
evolutionary basis, have been regarded as the group
that would have succeeded" — would receive no
bonus at all.
For non-taxpayers, the size of the reward would

depend upon the degree to which their genes were
considered to be inferior, Shockley said. For exam
ple, someone with low measured intelligence might
receive $1000 for every point that his 10 was below
the average. In addition, persons suffering from dis
eases linked to their genetic heritage, such as
hemophelia or diabetes, would be payed for being
sterilized, he said.
Shockley also responded to questions regarding his
recent contribution of sperm to the elite Repository
of Germinal Control in San Diego.
In an earlier interview, Shockley had responded to a
query about the all-white constituency of the exclu
sive sperm bank, saying that sperm banks need not be
exclusively white and that a sperm bank for basket
ball players would also be worthwhile.
On Campus Conference, Shockley was asked if he
wasn't implying that blacks were good at playing
basketball while whites were good at thinking. *
"There is, in my opinion, definitely this sort of a
difference," Shockley replied.
