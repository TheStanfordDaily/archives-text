## Netherlands honors new queen 
### Bradley Graham 
The Washington Post
AMSTERDAM — In 1568. a cluster of
provinces on the northwest corner of Europe
revolted against Spain's King Philip 11. They
won, eventually, with the support of their
overlord, Prince William of Orange.
The descendants of those times, now citi
zens of the Netherlands, never forgot the
favor, and yesterday they honored a new
queen and heir of William's house: Beatrix
Wilhelmina Armgard, princess of the
Netherlands, princess of Orange-Nassau,
princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld.
Holland is an odd place to find royalty still
being celebrated. Fiercely democratic, highly
socialized, determinedly informal, the Dutch
would seem an unlikely subject of the formal,
tradition-bound ways of court.
But even Netherlander find moments of
princely grandeur difficult to part with. Be
sides, their royal house has learned to temper
its style to Dutch tastes.
Democratically inclined and constitution
ally limited, the Dutch monarchy keeps to
modest proportions with fewer trappings and
a much smaller household (numbering 250
OT'sol than England's royal clan. No showy
changing of the guard for the bearers of this
kingly crest.
Grandmotherly queen
For the past 32 years, Holland's royal
house has been ruled by Juliana, a grand
motherly figure of a queen (she turns 71 on
Wednesday) who earned the affections of the
people by her gentle manner, regal — if a bit
eccentric — style, deep sense of duty and
informal actions that extended to writing her
own speeches and riding a bicycle.
The cloud of scandal over her husband —
Prince Bernhard was charged in 1976 by a

government commission with misusing his
position to solicit large sums of money from
Lockheed aircraft and subsequently was
forced from government and military posi
tions — seemed only to draw more sympathy
for the queen and boost her own popularity
among 14 million Hollanders.
Juliana's official reason for stepping down
is age. Her own mother, the austere Wilhel
mina. gave up the throne at age 68 after a half
century.
The question here is what kind of queen
Beatrix will be. The answer appears to be: a
queen different from her mother.
Unknown
At 42, Beatrix has not often appeared in
public on official occasions, causing many
Dutch to feel they do not really know her.
Her soft, round face carries a ready smile,
accented by dimples, which contributes to
her charm.
At the same time, there is a definite aris
tocratic air in her manner and speech. Some
call her aloof.
Information about the royal family is
strictly controlled, and there is little one can
glean from public resources about the real
Beatrix. The court's official biography says,
"The princess is deeply interested in
sculpture, painting, dramatic art and ballet,
and regularly attends exhibitions, plays and
ballet performances. She likes to talk to the
artists and performers." She also is described
as enjoying sports, especially riding, skiing,
swimming and tennis.
More practical
Beatrix is widely regarded as more intelli
gent and more practical than her idealistic
mother. She is also said to be more
headstrong, stemming in large part from her
insistence in 1966 on marrving Claus von

Amsberg. a West German diplomat whose
background as a member of the Hitler youth
caused controversy in Holland.
Beatrix threatened togoona hungerstrike
unless her parents approved the marriage,
and once they did. she refused to get married
in the quiet of the Hague, pressing instead for
a formal wedding in Amsterdam.
Such open displays of stubborn desire will
not work from the queen's chair. "The
danger is that Beatrix will try to exert her will
too much." said one source close to the royal
family. "She must not overplay her hand. She
must not appear to want to dominate." The
basic formula of the House of Orange has
been not to stand above the people but to live
with them.
The Dutch monarch's powers are ex
tremely limited by constitution. They consist
chiefly of selecting the person who forms a
new government after each national election.
This can be a delicate process, since the
country's system of proportional representa
tion ensures that any government will be a
coalition. There are 13 parties currently rep
resented in parliament.
In general, Holland's monareh is expectcd
to take social initiatives but not to mix in
politics — and is actually protected from
political responsibility by the constitution,
which says"the king can do no wrong. The
ministers are responsible."
Observed one Western diplomat, "Beatrix
will be more successful the less political she
is."
Prince Claus. 53. a handsome and quiet
spoken man. is said by court observers to he a
wise counselor to Beatrix. After an upsetting
introduction, he has become widely popular
in Holland for his energetic interest in en
vironmental and Third World issues. He also
learned to speak Dutch well.

zens of the Netherlands, never forgot the
favor, and yesterday they honored a new
queen and heir of William's house: Beatrix
Wilhelmina Armgard, princess of the
Netherlands, princess of Orange-Nassau,
princess of Lippe-Biesterfeld.
Holland is an odd place to find royalty still
being celebrated. Fiercely democratic, highly
socialized, determinedly informal, the Dutch
would seem an unlikely subject of the formal,
tradition-bound ways of court.
But even Netherlander find moments of
princely grandeur difficult to part with. Be
sides, their royal house has learned to temper
its style to Dutch tastes.
Democratically inclined and constitution
ally limited, the Dutch monarchy keeps to
modest proportions with fewer trappings and
a much smaller household (numbering 250
OT'sol than England's royal clan. No showy
changing of the guard for the bearers of this
kingly crest.
Grandmotherly queen
For the past 32 years, Holland's royal
house has been ruled by Juliana, a grand
motherly figure of a queen (she turns 71 on
Wednesday) who earned the affections of the
people by her gentle manner, regal — if a bit
eccentric — style, deep sense of duty and
informal actions that extended to writing her
own speeches and riding a bicycle.
The cloud of scandal over her husband —
Prince Bernhard was charged in 1976 by a

government commission with misusing his
position to solicit large sums of money from
Lockheed aircraft and subsequently was
forced from government and military posi
tions — seemed only to draw more sympathy
for the queen and boost her own popularity
among 14 million Hollanders.
Juliana's official reason for stepping down
is age. Her own mother, the austere Wilhel
mina. gave up the throne at age 68 after a half
century.
The question here is what kind of queen
Beatrix will be. The answer appears to be: a
queen different from her mother.
Unknown
At 42, Beatrix has not often appeared in
public on official occasions, causing many
Dutch to feel they do not really know her.
Her soft, round face carries a ready smile,
accented by dimples, which contributes to
her charm.
At the same time, there is a definite aris
tocratic air in her manner and speech. Some
call her aloof.
Information about the royal family is
strictly controlled, and there is little one can
glean from public resources about the real
Beatrix. The court's official biography says,
"The princess is deeply interested in
sculpture, painting, dramatic art and ballet,
and regularly attends exhibitions, plays and
ballet performances. She likes to talk to the
artists and performers." She also is described
as enjoying sports, especially riding, skiing,
swimming and tennis.
More practical
Beatrix is widely regarded as more intelli
gent and more practical than her idealistic
mother. She is also said to be more
headstrong, stemming in large part from her
insistence in 1966 on marrving Claus von

Amsberg. a West German diplomat whose
background as a member of the Hitler youth
caused controversy in Holland.
Beatrix threatened togoona hungerstrike
unless her parents approved the marriage,
and once they did. she refused to get married
in the quiet of the Hague, pressing instead for
a formal wedding in Amsterdam.
Such open displays of stubborn desire will
not work from the queen's chair. "The
danger is that Beatrix will try to exert her will
too much." said one source close to the royal
family. "She must not overplay her hand. She
must not appear to want to dominate." The
basic formula of the House of Orange has
been not to stand above the people but to live
with them.
The Dutch monarch's powers are ex
tremely limited by constitution. They consist
chiefly of selecting the person who forms a
new government after each national election.
This can be a delicate process, since the
country's system of proportional representa
tion ensures that any government will be a
coalition. There are 13 parties currently rep
resented in parliament.
In general, Holland's monareh is expectcd
to take social initiatives but not to mix in
politics — and is actually protected from
political responsibility by the constitution,
which says"the king can do no wrong. The
ministers are responsible."
Observed one Western diplomat, "Beatrix
will be more successful the less political she
is."
Prince Claus. 53. a handsome and quiet
spoken man. is said by court observers to he a
wise counselor to Beatrix. After an upsetting
introduction, he has become widely popular
in Holland for his energetic interest in en
vironmental and Third World issues. He also
learned to speak Dutch well.
