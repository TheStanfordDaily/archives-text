MOSCOW — Some Soviet scientists
about to visit the United States have been
told in pre-departure briefings by Com
munist Party officials here that if ques
tioned about the exile of Nobel Prize
winning physicist Andrei Sakharov by
American colleagues, they should say
they personally believe it to have been a
mistake.
The party officials made it clear that the
instructions did not signal any change in
official policy toward the dissident physi
cist, but rather were intended to deflect
criticism of the Kremlin's handling of the
Sakharov affair, according to reliable
sources in Moscow.
Sakharov, who has long been the most
influential and important figure among
Soviet human rights dissidents, was sud
denly stripped of all his state awards and
prizes and whisked into internal exile in
the Volga River city of Gorky more than
three months ago. Gorky is closed to

foreign travelers.
The 58-year-old physicist, who won the
Nobel Peace Prize for his human rights
stand in 1975. has been under constant
police supervision since the January exile
and has been branded by the official
Soviet press as a "traitor" who passed
state secrets to the West.
Known as the "father of the Soviet hyd
rogen bomb." the scientist's exile caused
widespread protest in the West, not only
those identified with the human rights
movement here, but also among major
scientific groups in the United States,
Western Europe and elsewhere.
Limit damage
Western analysts here say that the re
ported instructions given tovisitingSoviet
scientists, along with other unusual recent
development, indicate the high value the
Kremlin leadership places on scientific
contact with the West and its desire to
limit the damage tosuch contacts from the
rapidly deteriorating Soviet-American
political relationship.

The instructions to the scientists came
at a pre-departure ideological briefing
commonly given to Soviet citizens travel
ing abroad on official visits, the sources
said. At least one group was told that if
the subject of Sakharov came up in meet
ings with their American counterparts,
they should at first attempt to change the
subject.
However, the party officials said, if the
American scientists persisted in their
questioning, the visiting Soviets were
permitted to tell them: "1 agree. Person
ally, I think what the Soviet Union did was
a mistake."
Cutback
There has been a noticeable cutback in
Soviet-American scientific contacts,
especially in physics, since the invasion of
Afghanistan late last year and the exile of
Sakharov.
However, scientific exchanges continue
at a brisk pace in such aieas as the envi
ronment. health, and oceanic research.
About 30 Soviet scientists are expected to

visit the United States during the next
month — about half the number who
were going monthly in better times.
The bulk of the visits coine under bilat
eral scientific exchange agreements,
primarily in the health and environmental
area. Also, Soviet scientists are still travel
ing to international scientific conferences
which may happen to be scheduled to take
place in the United States.
In addition to the reported briefings of
traveling scientists, there have been other
curious developments here in recent
weeks which point to Soviet concern over
losing out on scientific contacts they con
sider to be valuable.
Jewish activists
Earlier this month the Soviets permit
ted an unofficial scientific conference or
ganized by Jewish activists here to pro
ceed with negligible interference. Three
of 23 foreign scientists who attended even
received visas after stating specifically
that the reason for their visit was to attend
what was, essentially, a protest seminar.
