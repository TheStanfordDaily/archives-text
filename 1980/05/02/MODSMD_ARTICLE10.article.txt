# Mugabe 'disappointed' with U.S. aid

### Jay Ross The Washington Post 
SALISBURY. Zimbabwe —
Zimbabwean Prime Minister
Robert Mugabe said yesterday
he was "disappointed"' at the
$45 million in aid that the United
States has offered his newly in
dependent nation and expects
American assistance to total "as
much as a billion dollars spread
over three to four years."
In his first public criticism of
American policy since taking of
fice two weeks ago. the leader of

the key southern African nation
also voiced concern that the Un
ited States did not send "a high
powered delegation" to the
country's independence celebra
tions last month. He unfavorably
compared the U.S. team led by
former ambassadors Averell
Harriman and Andrew Young to
that of Britain, which sent Prince
Charles and Foreign Secretary
Lord Carrington.
The former guerrilla leader
received most of his aid from
communist countries outside the

Soviet bloc during the seven
year Rhodesian war but has
openly turned to the West while
keeping the Soviets at arm's dis
tance since his election in Feb
ruary.
Speaking in an interview, he
was careful to qualify his criti
cism of the United States and ba
lance it with remarks that could
hardly satisfy the Soviet Union.
He appeared to be maneuvering
to get substantial assistance from
both superpowers as he begins
the task of rebuilding his war

torn country.
From all indications,
Washington is unlikely to pro
vide anything like the amount of
aid Mugabe envisages because of
domestic economic considera
tions and East-West military is
sues sparked by the Soviet inva
sion of Afghanistan.
So far. the United States has
given $2 million for the rehabili
tation of provincial medical ser
vices. promised $13 million dol
lars during the current fiscal year
ending Sept. 30 and has prop
osed another $25 million to $30
million for next year, pending
congressional approval.
Jeff Davidon. U.S. charge
d'affairs, said the 17-month allo
cation of as much as $45 million
was one of the largest U.S. aid
programs for a hlack African
country and shows the serious
U.S. interest in Zimbabwe
Mugabe sai<J he could not es
timate when the Soviets would
be allowed to set up an embassy
in Salisbury since it depended on
negotiations.
During the war, the Soviet
Union and its allies refused arms
to Mugabe and instead lavished
them on Nkomo's forces.
Mugabe did not invite Moscow's
closest East bloc allies to the in
dependence festivities.
