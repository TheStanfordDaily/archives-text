# Jordanian-Israeli border games
## Travelers must juggle 
### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
AMMAN. Jordan — Games
people plav, as seen crossing
from Jordan into the Israeli
occupied West Bank over the
narrow Jordan River:
— A taxi driver in Amman,
when directed to the Allenby
Bridge, feigns an uncom
prehending look and pretends to
search the recesses of his mem
ory. "Allenby? Allenby? Oh,
you mean King Hussein Bridge.
Yes, of course. King Hussein
Bridge."
— A bored clerk in the Jorda
nian Ministry of Interior, know
ingfull well the tourists crowding
his office are all headed for Israel
and points beyond, passes out
forms. They read: "Application
for a permit to cross from the
East Bank of the Hashemite
kingdom of Jordan to the West
Bank of the kingdom and re
turn."
A New York-bound
backpacker, struggling to hide

his exaltation at receiving his
approved application several
days later, just in time for his
Hight connections in Tel Aviv,
departs nervously, saying, "See
you in a couple of days."
— An Amman-bound visitor
from Israel unwittingly tells a
Jordanian frontier official he
plans to return to Israel the same
way several days later. "Don't
tell me you're doing that, or I
can't let you in." the official tells
the visitor, who quickly begins
muttering about airline (lights
out of Jordan.
— Trucks laden with oranges
from the Gaza Strip brake to a
halt at the edge of the Israeli side
of the river and hand green per
mits to an Israeli soldier. As the
trucks begin to lumber across the
wooden plank bridge, the Arab
drivers casually reach out the
windows and remove Israeli
issued license plates from frames
welded to the sides of their
doors. Even before they hit Jor
danian soil, all traces of Israeli
identity are gone.
— In the Israeli passport con-

trol terminal, travelers are reas
sured by a prominent sign: "We
do not stamp passports."
In Jordan obtaining a bridge
permit ean be an exercise in
frustration. Until recently,
foreign correspondents based in
Israel were allowed to cross both
ways across the bridge. But the
government appears to have
ended that practice for the time
being.
"In principle, you can travel
only from the West Bank to the
East Bank. You must under
stand. we don't have diplomatic
relations with Israel," said Peter
Salah, undersecretary of the
Ministry of Information, before
sending two Jerusalem-based
correspondents on a three-day
treasure hunt through the In
terior Ministry for bridge
crossing permits.
In Room 34. a clerk im
mediately presented a Catch-22.
An application could not be
made without a revenue stamp.
But the man who sells revenue
stamps had gone home. In Room
27, another clerk said delays
might hold up the application
until 1 p.m. Friday, without me
tioning that the bridge closes at
noon Fridays for the Jewish sab
bath.
In the end. however, the per
mits mysteriously appeared in
the promised three days, and all
impediments seemed removed.
But as the Jordanian minibus
carrying travelers from a
passport terminal on the East
Bank to the 30-foot-wide river
approached the unimposing
bridge, it was the Israelis' turn to
make the crossing difficult.
A dour-faced soldier held the
bus for nearly two hours and, at
one point, ordered the Arab
driver to turn off his engine.
When the driver explained that
small children in the bus would
swelter in the heat without air
conditioning, the soldier snap
ped, "Turn it off!"
At the entry terminal, travel
ers are subjected to exhausting
searches by the security
conscious Israelis, who empty
suitcases, laboriously examine
every article of clothing and con
duct lengthy body searches.
In the end. the 50-mile trip
from Amman to Jerusalem took
five hours.
