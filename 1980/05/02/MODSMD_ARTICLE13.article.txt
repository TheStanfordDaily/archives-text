KINSHASA, Zaire (AP) —
Sunday evening Mass at Kinsh
asa's Notre Dame cathedral is a
toe-tapping blend of tribal
drums, throbbing African
rhythms and Roman Catholic
ritual brought to the Congo by
European colonizers a century
ago.
But profession of a "colonial"
faith by nearly half the people of
a country in search of its African
roots has been a cause of friction
between church and state which
Pope John Paul 11 hopes to ease
with his visit to the former Bel
gian Congo this week.
Arriving today for the first
stop on his six-nation African
tour, the Polish-born pontiff will
be welcomed by President
Mobutu Sese Seko. A Catholic
who was baptized Joseph Desire
Nobutu. he is also Zaire's autoc
ratic, self-styled guide,
founder-president and author of
an Africanization program
which in the 1970s tried to cur

tail sharply the power of the
church.
Programs this week on Tele
Zaire, the government TV net
work, depicted the pope as the
"defender of the poor and a
friend of the weak." The deputy
minister of information organiz
ing the papal visit. Bolela Wa
Boende, called it "not only an
affair of the church or of the gov
ernment, hut a national affair."
Though church-state relations
have improved in recent years,
many among Zaire's I 1.7 million
Catholics — about 45 percent of
the population of 26.5 million —
hope the papal visit will help im
prove the lot of the church in the
long term.
A Belgian Catholic missionary
who has lived in Zaire for 25
years said he hopes the visit will
also have some moral impact on
the Zairean authorities.
In a country larger than the
United States east of the Missis
sippi, the mass of the population
lives barely above subsistence
level, while Mobutu is described

as living in luxury. Allegations
are frequently made of wide
spread official corruption.
"If the pope can manage to
make the Zaireans more Christ
ian, and live that Christianity,"
said the priest, who declined use
of his name, "there will be
change. The authorities will be
there, too, and hear what the
pope says."
It was in 1971 that Mobutu,
49, a former army colonel who
seized power in 1965, ordered a
return "to truly African authen
ticity of life so that Zaire may
discover its true personality."
Teaching of religion was
abolished in all schools, and por
traits of Mobutu replaced the
crucifix in classrooms.
But the restrictions proved
unpopular and unworkable, and
over the past few years they were
lifted. Church and state began a
reconciliation. Cardinal Joseph
Mulalu, who lived briefly in exile
at the Vatican during the repres
sion, will be with Mobutu at the
airport to welcome John Paul 11.
