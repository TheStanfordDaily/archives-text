Wouldn't you know it â€” as soon as the sun
comes hack, so do all the questions! I received a
lot of mail this week, hut surprisingly none of it
was in response to last week's question about
available women. 1 expected to have some
equally interesting inquiries about Stanford
men. but it seems people are more interested in
inanimate objects like plants, musicand money.
Dear Bug Me,
I am curious as to what indoor plant company
installed and maintains the indoor plants in the
Law School, new computer science building,
psych department and other such buildings on
campus.
Plant Lover and Businessman
Strange as it may seem, the University does
not provide or maintain any of the indoor plants
on campus. Every department or facility must
fend and spend for itself to add verdant interior
decoration to its environment.
Some departments rent their plants, much in
the way one might rent a car, but most purchase
the plants from nurseries or companies that will
contract to maintain the green things as well.
The Psychology Department purchased its
plants 10 years ago from the California Street
Nursery in San Francisco, which apparently
does a lot of plant maintenance on the Penin
sula. The nursery takes care of the plants and
replaces them if they die.
The Computer Science Department purch
ased its plants from a Palo Alto company called
Flowers by Ronnie. The Law School refused to
divulge the name of its plant company. It almost
seems as if each department has its own pro
vider.
Dear 8.M.:
The Office of Student Activities offered a
Creativity grant a few months ago. Who won?
Anonymous
The bulk of the grant, according to Patricia
Brandt, assistant director of student activities,
went to a group representing the Outing Club
and the Alpine Club. These students were
awarded $250 to put together an equipment
bank. Working with the Recreation Center at
Tresidder, they are planning to stock tents and
other assorted hiking and camping equipment,
which will be available to students at low rental
rates.
Brandt said that the Office of Student Ac
tivities received a number of good proposals

and tries to follow up on the proposals with each
group. The office awarded a second place grant
of $100 to the Stanford Circus, which will be
training interested people in circus skills, such
as juggling.
Other groups submitting proposals were
given information and, in some cases, were pro
vided with funds from other sources to help
them pursue their goals.
Dear Bug Me,
My folks are coming up for my graduation in a
motorhome. Is their somewhere around here
they can park it? How about over by the
stadium? And where can I get a map of the
campus showing where the mini-bus stops are?
Green and Sticky
According to Police Services, it is University
policy that motorhomes are not allowed to park
overnight on campus and will be ticketed if they
do. Police Services suggests that motorhomes
park in nearby trailer parks, which are fairly
numerous and can be found by looking in the
phone book.
One place to get a copy of the Marguerite
route is to ask at the Visitor Information booth
at the front of the Quad, which is a good place to
send your parents upon arrival here anyway.
Dear Bug Me,
Why doesn't Lagunita get AM radio recep
tion?
Kyuu and you too
Strange question this, but stranger still is the
response. I called the Lagunita office, and the
office assistant there said that not only had they
never had a complaint, but they in fact get AM
stations on the office radio. Suspecting that the
question may have come from a student with a
broken radio, I called an RA at Lag.
Brett Thompson, the RA, also said that no
body had ever complained and that he hadn't
noticed the lack of reception because he lis
tened to FM music. But when he tried gettingan
AM station, he found that it was true: AM
reception was poor to terrible Could it just be
that nobody listens to AM radio in all those
dorms, or do some of you Lagunita residents get
AM reception? What's the story over there?
