# Ohio salt mine hosts experiment
## Scientists look for end of world 
### Thomas O'Toole The Washington Post 
An enormous hole is being dug in the bot
tom of a salt mine in Ohio to conduct a feder
ally funded experiment that could prove that
the entire universe will disappear someday in
an enormous fireball.
The experiment, which is backed by $2
million from the Department of Energy, in
volves excavating a chamber 70 feet high,
2000 feet down in a salt mine on the shores of
Lake Erie, filling the hole with 10,000 tons of
the purest water and surrounding the water
with 2000 photoelectric cells. If there is a
sudden flash of light at any time in the next
year that the photoelectric cells pick up, it
means the world will come to an end some
day.
"A flash of light will mean a proton has
decayed and has released energy in its de
cay," Dr. Frederick Reines of UC-lrvine
Wednesday told the annual meeting of the
American Physical Society. "It will mean
that the notion that protons live forever is not
the correct one."
Tiny mass loss
An unstable proton means that all matter
as we know it in the universe will ultimately
decay. Decay of the proton means that at
some distant point in time, the protons that

make up the heart of the universe will sud
denly lose a tiny fraction of their mass and
become electrons, an act that will release
enough energy to burn up the universe.
Reines is conducting the experiment at the
bottom of the Ohio salt mine because the
1979 winners of the Nobel Prize predicted
that the proton had a finite lifetime, not an
infinite one as physicists have believed for
the last 100 years.
The Nobel Prize winners (Sheldon
Glashow and Steven Weinberg of Harvard
University) won their prize in part for a
theory that suggests that the electromagnetic
and the weak and strong nuclear forces of
nature are all manifestations of the same
force. This means the proton and electron
are linked, which tells physicists that the
heavier proton can emit a flash of light and
decay to an electron.
Transition period
"This says the universqas we see it is only
in a transitory phase," said Dr. Rolf Sinclair
of the National Science Foundation. "This
means that all matter could ultimately decay
to electrons."
The experiment conceived by Reines in
volves filling a hole at bottom of a salt
mine with purified water, which is composed
mostly of protons that make up the hydrogen

atom in the water molecule of hydrogen and
oxygen.
The salt mine was chosen because the rock
and salt will block out any cosmic rays from
outer space that could strike the Earth and
confuse the photoelectric cells surrounding
the water into thinking they had seen the
decay of a proton.
Proton glut
Reines said the hole will be filled with
10,000 tons of water to supply what in efffect
will be an almost unlimited number of pro
tons for the experiment. He said there are 10
to the 19th protons in each ton of pure water.
In the theory that won them the Nobel
Prize, Glashow and Weinberg said that the
"average" proton would last between 10 to
the 30th and 10 to the 34th years. Reines said
if their theory is right, one proton in the
water bath at the bottom of the salt mine
would decay and emit a flash of light in each
year the water bath sits there.
Reines said his experiment will be ready in
a year, but if he detects a flash of light any
time in the year after that, nobody should
panic. That would still mean the world has a
long way to go. The universe is estimated to
be 20 billion years old, which is 20 plus nine
zeros. That still leaves between 21 and 24
zeros for time to go on.
