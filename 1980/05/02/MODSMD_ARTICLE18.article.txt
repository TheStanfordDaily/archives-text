WASHINGTON — George
Wright had been called here for
several days of business and was
in the midst of a series of meet
ings when he was abruptly sent
home.
Like several other Federal

Trade Commission officials,
Wright, the assistant director of
the FTC's Boston regional of
fice, was unexpectedly caught
out-of-town on the eve of a fed
erally ordered shutdown of the
regulatory agency at midnight
Wednesday.
When he arrived Wednesday
morning, "Everything was in a
hubbub about closing down, and
1 was told to go home," he said
yesterday.
The agency shutdown was ex
pected to last only one day. Both
the House and Senate quickly
passed a resolution yesterday
nii/ino the commission $7.6 mill
operate through May 31.
The resolution was rushed to
the White House later in the day
for President Jimmy Carter to
sign.
Wright and other travelling
PTC officials were among the
1700 PTC employees instructed
by the commission's executive
director to stop whatever busi
ness they were conducting —
from complex litigation to con
sumer education meetings. It
was th\» first shutdown of the
FTC since it opened 66 years
ago.
Wright's predicament was far
less complicated than that of
lawyers forced to stop litigation,
and he had more warning than
was given several of the 10 reg
ional off ices. At the one in Cleve
land. for example, uniformed
guards appeared unannounced
to begin changing locks.
At the FTC's main office in
Washington, the library was
nearly empty. Telephone calls to
the public reference room, which
handles inquiries on commission

matters, were answered with a
tape recording saying that the
commission was closed.
Calls from consumers were
turned away in other offices.
Businesses seeking assistance on
FTC rules were told they
couldn't be helped, as officials
were trying to figure out what to
do with pending cases and were
compiling lists of employees who
would be laid off first.
Employees were told to clean
out and organize their files.
"There are a lot of people pack
ing things in boxes around here
today," said one official.
"I can't say this is the most
pleasant experience I've ever
had," said David Clanton, one of
the five FTC commissioners,
who was going through papers
on his desk when a reporter cal
led. "About the only beneficial
thing is that people can clean out
their files for the first time in a
long while."
Morale at the agency, which
has been under attack in recent
months by business and Con
gress, sagged even further.

One worried official even
stripped his office walls of every
thing in anticipaliAn of the shut
down.
To boost morale, President
Carter sent a letter late yesterday
to the FTC commissioners and
the staff saying he was aware of
the agency's predicament, and
pledging his support.
"I know that the past several
months have been trying for all
of you and that the uncertainty
arising from the protracted effort
to secure an authorization bill
has made your jobs more dif
ficult than they might otherwise
be," the president wrote.
The temporary measure pas
sed by Congress assures the
commission of short-term fund
ing while Congress acts on legis
lation to change some of the
commission's policies and to
guarantee it a funding authoriza
tion. A House-Senate confer
ence committee approved the
compromise bill Wednesday,
and it now awaits a vote by the
full House and Senate, possibly
next week.
