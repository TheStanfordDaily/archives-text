# Minority coalition may seek assessment
## 
### Seth Zuckerman News Editor 
A coalition of four minority groups may decide not
to seek a $1 fee assessment for next year because rt
fears that other sources of funding may be cut if the
assessment passes! members of the'group said last
night. , ''
The group, the Third World Coalition, will meet
today with Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons.
Clarifications it receives at the meeting will deter
mine whether it seeks the assessment, said' Nancy
Takahashi of the Asian "American Students Associa
tion.
Students will on fee assessments and elect
ASSU senators next week.
She said the group should not go ahead with the
assessment unless the Dean of Student Affairs Office
can guarantee that allocations from the office's dis
cretionary fund will continue next year.
The office has provided several thousand dollars
each year for the Asian American Art Series, Black
Liberation Month. Cinco de Mayo and the Stanford
Powwow in recent years. The ethnic organizations
that sponsor these events comprise the Third World
Coalition.
Lyons said that projects usually continue to receive
allocations as long as they remain viable. But he said
the University's budget is "subject to change because
of circumstances beyond our control."
Lyons would not say whether the passage of a

Third World fee assessment would be a factor in the
allocation of the dean's office discretionary funds.
But Jonathan McGee of the Black Students Union
said "there is concern in the black community that
Dean Lyons will use the assessment as an excuse to
cut already existing funding."
If the University budget is tightened, funding for
minority groups will be cut first, said Elmer Aragon
of MEChA. "They are not going to cut money from
the football team," he said.
McGee spoke to Lyons about the assessment this
week and said Lyons told him he (Lyons) couldn't
promise future funding would not be cut.
The organizers of Black Liberation Month re
ceived $3000 this year from the Dean of Student
Affairs Office. The series of events cost $10,000.
McGee said.
Both McGee and Takahashi stressed that there is
no guarantee the student body would continue to pass
the Third World assessment in future years. If not,
and if the coalition had lost funding from the dean's
office, they could be put in a financial bind.
According to Lyons and Takahashi, the assessment
is intended to replace funds the organizations collect
for about 25 academic departments and from other
University offices like the Academic Information
Center.
Lyons said he has heard that departments regularly
sponsoring ethnic events want to curtail their dona
tions since the events are occurring regularly.

Fred Tejada ol the Asian American Students As
sociation said the idea of a Fhird World Coalition
seems to have originated with Lyons. McGee said
there is a lee 1 rig in the black community that Lyons
suggested theJffssessment because he was under pres
sure from departments that have funded the ethnic
events in the past.
Lyons said he and others have been suggesting an
assessment of this type for several years.
"l"he fact that Lyons suggested the assessment has
fostered the fear that the minority organizations'
funding would be cut if the assessment passes, mem
bers of the coalition said.
Takahashi said the coalition has gathered the re
quisite number of student signatures to place the
assessment on next week's ballot. Though the origi
nal deadline for petitions was Monday, the ASSU
Council of Presidents has extended the deadline until
this afternoon, said Takahashi.
ASSU Flections Commissioner Doug Mitchell said
the ballots for next week's elections have already
been sent to the overseas campuses and that the COP
has told him to postpone printing the ballots for the
home campus until the coalition reaches a decision
today.
Takahashi, a member ol the COP and of the coali
tion. said she did not participate in the discussion of
whether to give the coalition an extension on submit
ting its petitions. This kept a conflict of interest from
arising, she said.
