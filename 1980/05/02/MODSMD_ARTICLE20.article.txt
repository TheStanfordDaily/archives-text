## How to create a Magic Moment 
### 
Slow dancing with my date. 1
decided that it was time to create
a Magic Moment. I started rub
bing her lower back with my
hands, and whispered softly.
"You are beautiful, you're so
beautiful." When she whispered
back, "Lower, 'Early-Date,'
lower," 1 then said in a very
deep, bass voice, "YOU ARE
BEAUTIFUL, SO BEAUTI
FUL," and she started laughing
at me! Totally embarrassed. I
suddenly realized what she had
meant, and more importantly
that once again my attempt to
create a Magic Moment was no
thing more than hocus-pocus. ,
What is the Magic Moment
and why is it so important? Well
folks, it is the very thing that de
termines whether your dinner or
movie is a "just a friend" date or
in fact "hot tamales." If your
date is romantic and includes ac
tivities like kissing or something
more (2nd base, 3rd base, home
run or whatever), then you have
definitely had a few Magic Mo
ments.
Now I have been asked a
whole lot of questions about this
subject. A couple of you wrote
me and asked, "Dear 'Early-
Date,' how do you know for sure
if you are experiencing a Magic
moment?" Well, for you two
Gomer Pyles, I am sorry. I can't
help you. You clods are pretty
hopeless, and should stay out of
the big leagues by going to
"Paly" or something.
A lot of girls and guys, how
ever, did ask me a very serious
question — "How do you create
the Magic Moment?" Although
this is a very difficult question to
answer (it's very hard to write
about something you know no
thing about), that's the reason
why I am here, lucky-bucks. I
have thought of some styles and
tips that will help you create
those Magic Moments.
At the Movies: Watching a
movie together can be very
romantic, for you can put your

arm around the girl, or at times
even hold her hand. However,
there are some things you should
be aware of when you try to
create the Magic Moment at the
movies. When putting your arm
around a girl, most of you guys
will stretch out and yawn first,
wait for an action scene in the
movie, hastily put your arm ac
ross, and then begin to rub the
girls's back, while all the time
looking straight at the movie.
This can be very dangerous. I
remember one time I tried this

maneuver and started feeling out
a dude's shoulder.
He turned around, yelled
"What the 'hudda'!" and then
pushed all of his Junior Mints
right in my date's face! Although
it was an improvement, you
couldn't believe how mad she
was. Remember, always look at
where you are putting your arm.
As for drive-in movies, these are
great for creating Magic Mo
ments, but it is this columnist's
hope that these will be the only
things you will be creating.
Parking: Your car can be a
great place for Magic Moments if
you remember a few things.
First, bucket-seats are sure
loser-seats. People might be im
pressed with your car during the
day, but you want an old Chevy
or Ford for your night life. Also,
remember to use your protection
while parking — always keep the
warning blinkers on just in case
Probably the most important

thing you'll need to have is a
good, mellow Make-Out Tape.
Now I am sorry if you are a
rocker, but if you start blasting
"Hey Hey Mama . . you are
going to be a very lonely man.
Your Make-Out Tape should in
clude some "Earth. Wind, and
Fire" and other soft songs.
During the Date: First of all
let's dispel some rumors. Many
girls falsely believe that the re
sponsibility for creating Magic
Moments lies only with the
dudes. Wrongo, Old Maid, you

are a 50 percent partner in these
deals, and it is your duty to show
a little initiative (as Sylvia would
sing, "it takes two to tango").
Many of you girls already do this
successfully with such lines as,
"Oh, I am so cold," and "I'm just
a little scared." In fact there are a
lot of little things to remember in
helping to capture the Magic
Moment. For example, in order
that the guy can put his arm
around you, always wear your
purse on the side away from him
when you're walking together.
It's the little things that count.
Perhaps the bigget thing is
clothes. Girls, when they say "in
spring a young man's loving
turns fancy'' (whatever, I for
got), do you think this is so be
cause of the pretty flowers all
around and the nice birdies sing
ing in the trees? Heck no, it's
because people are showing
some skin finally (and the same
thing goes for guys with girls.)
Also remember Gark Kent's big
rule about clothing — clothes
that are extremely difficult to put

on are usually extremely difficult
to take off. Have you ever won
dered why the bundled-up Es
kimo families you see on televi
sion documentaries are lucky to
have one or two kids hanging
around, while some tropical, hot,
jungle-forest family has almost
50 kids buzzing like mosquitoes
all over the place?
End of Date: Girls, you can
create a lot of Magic Moments
near the end of your date if you
really like the guy. Your first ob
jective is to "legitimately" get
him in your room, so you must
ask him questions such as
"Would you like to read some of
my poetry?"
These techniques can also be
used by guys (if you have any
questions please ask my assis
tant, David Jaffe), but whoever
uses them must be sure that he
or she can really do the things
they ask about! 1 remember when
one of my sister's boyfriends
came over to hear her play the
guitar, and he almost broke the
Mattel four-string over her head
when he found out all she could
play was the radio.
Now your second objective
should be to get the guy in a re
clining position (you can't kiss
standing forever in some Bridge
on the River Kwai torture), and
the best way to do that is with
another question, "Would you
like a backrub?" This one is very
popular (in fact I'd never seen so
many sore backs until I came to
Stanford).
Well, these are the styles and
tips you should use to create
those Magic Moments, and I
hope that they help you this year.
Personally I think the best thing
is the "Inebriation Invitation,"
which is widely used by both girls
and guys. When you want a
Magic Moment with some dude
or chick you like, whether just at
a party or on a date, start moan
ing loudly, "I am sooo drunk,
oooh baby am I drunk!" Bingo,
it's Magic Time!
