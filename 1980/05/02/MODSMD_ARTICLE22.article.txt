## Tresidder stumps arsonist 
### 
I am an admitted arsonist. Each day, I scorch
Tresidder Union with fiery ideas and scathing
comments in an attempt to set the building on fire. I
lust to see a blazing campus center enveloping pas
sing pedestrians and consuming campus activities.
But the Tresidder structure simply will not burn.
Instead, the Tresidder facility is smothering. Its
cold, sterile interior stifles any flickers of light and
chokes off vital student socializing, interacting and
participation in campus activities.
Several recent changes have improved Tresid
der's volatility — a new -union director, a new
food contractor in the Transition, an ASSU take
over of the Coffee House — but Tresidder's physi
cal plant may muffle even these sparks of en
thusiasm. The facilities are an arsonist's nightmare:
dank conference rooms, a barren recreation
center, a metallic, sterile dining area, and a Coffee
House swamped by more Santa Cruz nomads than
light fixtures.
Less impassioned observers share my somber
view of the facility. A 1978 Civil Engineering 197
paper observed that "the lack of a casual lounge
area only increases feelings of loneliness and alie
nation in freshmen, transfers and new graduates."
The study further noted that the "physical struc
ture, specifically interior space utilization, is one of
Tresidder's main weaknesses . . . prohibiting suc
cessful interaction of students and the commun
ity" J . .
The problem of Tresidder's inadequacies is evi
dent; progress toward renovation is not. Even a
visiting committee of union experts noted last fall

that Tresidder was designed to expand — but has
not in its first 17 years of existence.
So I want to ask: how high a priority is Tresid
der? How much is it really a University commit
ment? If Tresidder does indeed rank among ad
ministration concerns, it must rank pitifully low:
for the last 17 years of construction inactivity at
Tresidder has see the construction (or major reno
vation) of Green and Meyer libraries, Maples, de-
Guerre, the Bookstore, CERAS, the Graduate
School of Business, the Law School, the Faculty
Club, and a score of other campus buildings. Tre
sidder administrators have not even seen renova
tion blueprints.
In my remaining year-and-a-half at this univer
sity, I will persevere with my quixotic quest, my
visions of a Transition dining area with ambiance,
an expanded Tresidder second deck with activity
offices and meeting rooms, a changed Coffee
House that pulses as a campus social center ought
to.
But until concrete documents appear, the
three-month long studies and financial estimates
that certify the birth of a project. I will have to
wonder about my approach. Perhaps I should cease
struggling to ignite Tresidder with words; perhaps I
should just bomb the place. But there would always
be that horrible, unthinkable thought. Would they
replace the pile of rubble? Is it really that much of a
priority?
