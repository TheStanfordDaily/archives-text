## Beware Britt's buckshot 
### 
Harry Britt's remarks reported in the April 30
Daily require comment. At best, Britt was mis
quoted. At worst, he has embarrassed himself and
the gay movement, which itself can ill afford rep
resentatives who reduce the impact of winning is
sues by bringing in silly ones.
The story reported that Britt, though he could
not articulate why, believed nuclear energy to be
male and sexist and draft registration sexist. Britt is
Hailing, and reveals two intellectual weaknesses.
First, Britt is calling sexist everything he doesn't
like and undermines the chances for rational de
bate on such issues. Since sexism appears to be
second in awfulness only to sexual-preferencism as
far as the gay movement is concerned, Britt has
called the above issues almost the dirtiest word he
can, and woe to those who would try to defend
them from such wholly inapplicable labels.
Britt's tactic is akin to that used by radicals who
call anything remotely anti-Communist "McCar
thyism," or black extremists who label as "racists"
anyone who disagrees with them. It's a handy way
to smear your opponents (which is part of McCar
thyism, if memory serves) and discourage discus
sion of the merits of the issues.
The first weakness is intellectually dishonest.
The second is bad tactics, and consists of lumping
non-gay and gay issues together, in the perhaps
mistaken belief that most gays agree on most non
sexual issues. The lack of merit of Britt's arguments
is exposed below. But here Britt alienates those
who find the cases against nuclear power and draft
registration less than compelling.
Britt seems to think that all gays are liberal,
which is nonsense. It's reasonable to assume 10
percent of conservatives are gay as well. Such
rhetoric cannot promote their participation in the
gay movement; 1 hope such a result is uninten
tional.
Amnesty International (AI) made a similar mis
take. A 1 decided to make a basic part of its plat
form opposition to the death penalty. The death
penalty is only tangentially related to Al's core

efforts regarding prisoners of conscience. Prisoners
of conscience should not he put to death for their
beliefs, obviously, hut why would AI stick up for
Charles Manson? The waters have heen muddied,
and Al's overall effectiveness blunted.
The above observations would apply even if
Britt'sobservations on those issues were definitive,
but his statements are ridiculous. Nuclear energy
and the draft have nothing to do with sexism, at
least Britt's brand of it. Is it sexist (i.e., anti-female)
to support an all-male draft, a device which would
not require women to participate in practices that
Britt likely detests (such as efforts to assure a
strong U.S. military posture)? If so, then perhaps
an all-female draft is a pro-female sexist thing, in
which case Britt should approve since he seems to
like the femaleness of solar energy.
Nuclear energy is better than a lot of things,
including depression and burning coal. Solar
energy is not without faults, a big one'being that it
cannot generate electricity for the foreseeable fu
ture at less than prohibitive costs, in spite of its
femaleness and gayness. Is there spmetning inhe
rently female about hot water arid male about elec
tricity? Thf nentjre notion is absurd.
Britt should stick to the issues, such as the fun
damental unfairness of discrimination based on
sexual preference. If some people simply don't like
gays, tough luck. Some people don't like races or
religions different from their own, but such dis
crimination is now illegal in many situations. Job,
housing and other issues should be decided by re
levant factors, such as productivity or dependabil
ity in paying the rent. Race arid sexual preference
are clearly irrelevant.
The gay movement should beware of the
buckshot approach. People unsympathetic will be
delighted to use silly remarks like Britt's as excuses
to ignore arguments Britt can marshall on relevant
issues.

far as the gay movement is concerned, Britt has
called the above issues almost the dirtiest word he
can, and woe to those who would try to defend
them from such wholly inapplicable labels.
Britt's tactic is akin to that used by radicals who
call anything remotely anti-Communist "McCar
thyism," or black extremists who label as "racists"
anyone who disagrees with them. It's a handy way
to smear your opponents (which is part of McCar
thyism, if memory serves) and discourage discus
sion of the merits of the issues.
The first weakness is intellectually dishonest.
The second is bad tactics, and consists of lumping
non-gay and gay issues together, in the perhaps
mistaken belief that most gays agree on most non
sexual issues. The lack of merit of Britt's arguments
is exposed below. But here Britt alienates those
who find the cases against nuclear power and draft
registration less than compelling.
Britt seems to think that all gays are liberal,
which is nonsense. It's reasonable to assume 10
percent of conservatives are gay as well. Such
rhetoric cannot promote their participation in the
gay movement; 1 hope such a result is uninten
tional.
Amnesty International (AI) made a similar mis
take. A 1 decided to make a basic part of its plat
form opposition to the death penalty. The death
penalty is only tangentially related to Al's core

efforts regarding prisoners of conscience. Prisoners
of conscience should not he put to death for their
beliefs, obviously, hut why would AI stick up for
Charles Manson? The waters have heen muddied,
and Al's overall effectiveness blunted.
The above observations would apply even if
Britt'sobservations on those issues were definitive,
but his statements are ridiculous. Nuclear energy
and the draft have nothing to do with sexism, at
least Britt's brand of it. Is it sexist (i.e., anti-female)
to support an all-male draft, a device which would
not require women to participate in practices that
Britt likely detests (such as efforts to assure a
strong U.S. military posture)? If so, then perhaps
an all-female draft is a pro-female sexist thing, in
which case Britt should approve since he seems to
like the femaleness of solar energy.
Nuclear energy is better than a lot of things,
including depression and burning coal. Solar
energy is not without faults, a big one'being that it
cannot generate electricity for the foreseeable fu
ture at less than prohibitive costs, in spite of its
femaleness and gayness. Is there spmetning inhe
rently female about hot water arid male about elec
tricity? Thf nentjre notion is absurd.
Britt should stick to the issues, such as the fun
damental unfairness of discrimination based on
sexual preference. If some people simply don't like
gays, tough luck. Some people don't like races or
religions different from their own, but such dis
crimination is now illegal in many situations. Job,
housing and other issues should be decided by re
levant factors, such as productivity or dependabil
ity in paying the rent. Race arid sexual preference
are clearly irrelevant.
The gay movement should beware of the
buckshot approach. People unsympathetic will be
delighted to use silly remarks like Britt's as excuses
to ignore arguments Britt can marshall on relevant
issues.
