## Council follows whale path 
### 
Californians are very fortunate in that they have
the rare opportunity to observe one of the largest
creatures to ever inhabit the earth, the whale. The
California gray whales pass our coast from De
cember through January on their way south to the
Baja where they mate and bear their young.
From March through May they cruise along our
coast again on the way north to their rich feeding
grounds in the Arctic Bering sea. This 10,000 mile
migration is the longest of any mammal on the
planet. Gray whales reach a length of about 50 feet
and a weight of 40 tons.
The grays may be observed from most vantage
points along the coast during their migration. Look
ior their blow, which is a 10-foot plume of water
and air as they rise to the surface to exhale and
catch another breath.
Sometimes you can catch a glimpse of their mas
sive backs, and if you're lucky you may catch one
leaping almost entirely out of the water, which is
called breaching.
The whales have large brains with more convolu
tions in their cerebral cortex than do humans. They
have been evolving in their present form for 30
million years. The study of whales is a very young
science and considering the amazing findings thus

far, it may be the most exciting.
Members of the Whale Council, a non-profit
organization from Eugene, Oregon, dedicated to
the preservation of marine mammals, took a trip to
the Baja this March for a closer look at the gray
whale.
With a photographer, sound technician and a
musician they photographed courting gray whales,
mother grays and calves coming along side their
boats to be petted and have music played to them.
They also recorded the whale sounds under water
while simultaneously recording live music above .
the water which enabled them to monitor the
whales' responses to the music.
The Whale Council is following the migration of
the grays north, giving free slide presentations with
live music to the public along the way.
The gray whales have been lifted from their pro
tected status by the International Whaling Com- •
mission and the Soviets have been granted a quota i
of 179 gray whales for this summer. The Whale
Council along with other concerned people and
organizations plans to stop this hunt.
