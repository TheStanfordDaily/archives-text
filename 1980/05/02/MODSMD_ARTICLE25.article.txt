Britt sexist
. If supervisor Harry Britt is re
ally interested in the creation of a
non-sexist society, perhaps he
could start by changing his own
blatantly sexist statements.
Britt states that a nuclear
power plant "going boom" is
"profoundly male" ( Dally, Apr.
30). He prattles on to imply that
only females and gays possess
the qualities of being loving and
human.
His characterization of men as
lacking love and humanity is as
sexist as stating that women
aren't practical thinkers. Both
statements are absurd, and
neither idea would be counte
nanced by a truly non-sexist soc
iety.
Being rational, loving, etc. are
all human qualities. Attempting
to deny them to any group of
humans, men or women, is the
core of sexism. Britt's promulga

tion of these ideas under false
colors makes me wonder if he
understands (or indeed desires)
a non-sexist society.

Nader wrong
Go ahead, Peter Stromberg
{Daily, Apr. 30), talk to us about
how sweet Nader is. Ralph
Nader came to prominence with
the book Unsafe At Any Speed,
which indicted the Corvair as a
death trap.
His evidence was a now
discredited Ford Motor training
film which showed the Corvair
spinning-out uncontrollably. In
fact, the Corvair has now been
exonerated — Nader attacked a
satisfactory automobile, and for
that great service, has now be
come an authority on everything.
Nader was also in the forefront
attacking the Ford Pinto. De
spite what the papers reported,
according to the official trial
transcript, the Pinto was average
in rear-end integrity in its class.
In fact, the Datsun B-210, the
Honda Civic and the Chevy
Vega all have worse rear-end fire
statistics than the Pinto. Of
course, any good consumer ad
vocate, motivated by European
and Japanese corporations and
the need for sensational stories
to keep his name on the front
pages, must not dare tell the
truth.
Indeed, representatives of the
Pentagon are at least as truthful
as Ralph Nader. Put that in your
pipe and smoke it, Stromberg.

National rules
Carol Chesarek's claim that a
sorority violated her individual
rights in its pursuit of informa
tion about her for a Panhellenic
file is, in fact, comoletely valid.
However, at this point, it is only
fair that I explain what happened
and the accompanying feelings
of the Inter-Sorority Council
(ISC) regarding this "violation
of rights."
In order to comply with na
tional rules, most sororities are
asked to have data information
sheets on file for each rushec for

which they may he considering
bid contention. However, this
does not mean that the Stanford
sororities actively use the infor
mation provided on these sheets.
In fact, most of the groups prefer
to meet rushees as they come
through the door with as little or
no information about the indi
viduals as possible.
When Chesarek called me, I
was angry. As I stated in the
Daily (April 28) I had no know
ledge of that call or any calls of
that nature being made.
In subsequent discussions with
two different National Panhel
lenic Delegates, the message that
the National Panhellenic Con
ference in no way condones this
type of calling came across very
strongly. Needless to say, it hap
pened, and obviously, something
needs to be done to prevent
further incidents of this nature.
At this point, the ISC has de
cided to draft a letter expressing
our concern to the national pres
idents of the chapters rep
resented at this campus.
When issues like this one arise,
I find myself reassessing my in
volvement in the sorority system
at Stanford. Despite the
shortcomings of this imperfect
system, I'm constantly reimpres
sed with the positive features in
this particular system. We who
are involved in this system are
not contented to sit passively by
as national organizations issue
rules and directions. Rather, we
will question and we will work to
change a system in which be
lieve.
