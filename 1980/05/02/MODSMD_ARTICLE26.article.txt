## Fraternities and sororities Alex Kline Phase out Greek system 
### 
For the past three years, I have
been tempted to write an article
explaining my critical attitude
toward fraternities and
sororities. I've restrained myself
because I didn't want to alienate
the fairly substantial number of
my friends and acquaintances
who are in the "Greek" system.
The itch has now grown irresist
able, and I only hope those
"Greeks" whose opinions I re
spect will at least consider what I
have to say before the inevitable
lashing out.
If 1 were running this Univer
sity, one of my highest priorities
would be the gradual phasing
out of the Greek system.
Why do I dislike the Greek
system? It's something I've puz
zled over. The ostensible pur
pose of my "side" of the system,
fraternities, is merely to bring
together a group of people who
like each other's company and
want to live together. On the sur
face, there's nothing so bad
about that, except that many of
the side-effects of fraternities are
ignored.
First of all, it offends my sense
of individuality to be associated
with a group identity. F air or not
fair, rational or irrational,
everyone knows that frats de
velop characteristic reputations.
1 know members of each group
who don't fit these stereotypes,
but they exist nevertheless, and
group reputations usually do
have basis in fact. I would
not want to be labeled and as
sociated with a group identity,
even if it were in a favorable way:
viz, "All the boys from XYZ are
so nice, so-and-so is probably so
nice.''
Another aspect of fraternities
which repels me is their in
stitutionalization of certain so
cial behaviors, robbing these acts

of spontaneity and sincerity. The
rituals, handshakes and certain
phrases used in common by
members of the group, all gain a
momentum of their own that
tends to tlatten out individual
differences. Members tend to
converge on certain group at
titudes, values and ways of look
ing at and reacting to the world,
not responding as they might if
they lived in a different group.
Many people join fraternities
or sororities out of fear and so
cial insecurity, hut at Stanford I
think the motives are more sub
tle. Faced with unaccustomed
diversity of viewpoints and
backgrounds during their first
year, people long for a group that
shares common assumptions and
attitudes so that they needn't
watch every word they say for
fear of offending someone.
This usually amounts to find
ing a niche where they can in
dulge their prejudices and into
lerances freely. Misogyny, class
distinctions, subtle racism and
general disdain for those who
"just don't have a clue" have
more room to flourish when one
is surrounded by like-minded
people. Sheltered in a haven of
those with the perspicacity and
discipline to conduct themselves
with intelligence, responsibility
and taste, there is more latitude
to ridicule the "rads," feminists,
faggots and general slobs litter
ing the campus. Overweight, or
otherwise less than voluptuous
women can be kept safely out of
earshot of clever appellations
like "pig"' or "sow." The human
flotsam who don't appreciate the
importance of athletic prowess, a
good stereo or a flashy car can be
screened out.
I realize that 1 and everyone
else have prejudices, opinions
and constantly make judgments

of other people. But it seems to
me that one of the greatest be
nefits one could get from Stan
ford is to be thrust into a group
where you at least consider other
people's ideas and viewpoints.
Tlie challenge is often frustrat
ing, everyone loses patience with
different factions, groups,
backgrounds and opinions; but I
don't see the necessity of in
stitutionalizing one's attitudes,
likes and dislikes by living with a
group that shares them. We
should try to broaden our
perspectives rather than insulat
ing ourselves from those who
might cause us to do so.

For the past three years, I have
been tempted to write an article
explaining my critical attitude
toward fraternities and
sororities. I've restrained myself
because I didn't want to alienate
the fairly substantial number of
my friends and acquaintances
who are in the "Greek" system.
The itch has now grown irresist
able, and I only hope those
"Greeks" whose opinions I re
spect will at least consider what I
have to say before the inevitable
lashing out.
If 1 were running this Univer
sity, one of my highest priorities
would be the gradual phasing
out of the Greek system.
Why do I dislike the Greek
system? It's something I've puz
zled over. The ostensible pur
pose of my "side" of the system,
fraternities, is merely to bring
together a group of people who
like each other's company and
want to live together. On the sur
face, there's nothing so bad
about that, except that many of
the side-effects of fraternities are
ignored.
First of all, it offends my sense
of individuality to be associated
with a group identity. F air or not
fair, rational or irrational,
everyone knows that frats de
velop characteristic reputations.
1 know members of each group
who don't fit these stereotypes,
but they exist nevertheless, and
group reputations usually do
have basis in fact. I would
not want to be labeled and as
sociated with a group identity,
even if it were in a favorable way:
viz, "All the boys from XYZ are
so nice, so-and-so is probably so
nice.''
Another aspect of fraternities
which repels me is their in
stitutionalization of certain so
cial behaviors, robbing these acts

of spontaneity and sincerity. The
rituals, handshakes and certain
phrases used in common by
members of the group, all gain a
momentum of their own that
tends to tlatten out individual
differences. Members tend to
converge on certain group at
titudes, values and ways of look
ing at and reacting to the world,
not responding as they might if
they lived in a different group.
Many people join fraternities
or sororities out of fear and so
cial insecurity, hut at Stanford I
think the motives are more sub
tle. Faced with unaccustomed
diversity of viewpoints and
backgrounds during their first
year, people long for a group that
shares common assumptions and
attitudes so that they needn't
watch every word they say for
fear of offending someone.
This usually amounts to find
ing a niche where they can in
dulge their prejudices and into
lerances freely. Misogyny, class
distinctions, subtle racism and
general disdain for those who
"just don't have a clue" have
more room to flourish when one
is surrounded by like-minded
people. Sheltered in a haven of
those with the perspicacity and
discipline to conduct themselves
with intelligence, responsibility
and taste, there is more latitude
to ridicule the "rads," feminists,
faggots and general slobs litter
ing the campus. Overweight, or
otherwise less than voluptuous
women can be kept safely out of
earshot of clever appellations
like "pig"' or "sow." The human
flotsam who don't appreciate the
