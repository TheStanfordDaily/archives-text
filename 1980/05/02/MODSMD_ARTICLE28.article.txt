## Sororities satisfy OSA goals, objectives 
### 
Sororities returned to the Stanford
community in 1977 after the administra
tion lifted a 33-year-old ban.The equality
demanded by Title IX partially acted as a
mediating force for their return, yet the
return would not have been possible or
successful had a need for such organiza
tions not existed on this campus.
Now in their third year on campus,
sororities continue to fill women's needs
as well as continue to participate in pro
jects and,activities which benefit both the
Stanford campus and community.
The functions, achievements and goals
of sororities satisfactorily fulfill the gen
eral goals and objectives set forth by the
Office of Student Activities (OSA), part
of the Office of Student Affairs which is
headed by Dean James Lyons.
ITie OSA deals with recognized volun
teer campus groups and has released a
report outlining goals and objectives for
these organizations.
The report says, "Our concern is
primarily with programs and services
aimed to encourage the development of
guiding values, knowledge of self and so
cial and interpersonal skills . . .
"The core experience of the student. . .
is a unique and highly personal synthesis
of what is learned in the encounters which
a student has . . . most of this synthesis
and integration necessarily goes on outside
of the classroom in out-of-class contacts
with other students . . . and with the
community beyond."
Sororities are a means of providing this
synthesis and a corresponding integration
of knowledge and skills within a beneficial
and supportive personal and community
environment. This means has already

been discovered by thousands of women
across the country during the last century.
One of the foremost advantages of
sorority membership is the opportunity
provided for leadership. In a competitive
campus environment, where most organi
zations are large and often impersonal,
assurance and self-confidence are pre
requisites for attaining leadership roles.
Sororities, however, provide a supportive
environment among women who come to
know and trust one another, feeling com
fortable taking on responsibility and ex
perimenting with new activities and roles.
The question most often asked of soror
ity members is "Why did you join?" And
the answer given is usually for the friend
ships. Interpersonal relationships support
the system and, in turn, the system pro
vides a healthy backdrop for the de
velopment of personal and coopertive in
teractions.
Again, the sororities have reflected the
OSA statement "that a healthy commun
ity life among students is important to the
full development of students at Stanford
. . . Since the structure and tradition of the
University emphasizes personal au
tonomy and competition among students,
we believe it is doubly important to pro
vide students with opportunities for in
terdependence and cooperation . . . We
are committed to helping students de
velop communities of interest through
which they can join with others in work
and play as well as in talk and intellectual
discourse."
Learning the functions of group
dynamics prepares the women for similar
experiences with organizations in the fu
ture. Qualities of cooperation and flexibil
ity are developed in the understanding of

the responsibilities of group membership.
The associations available through
sorority membership also develop an in
dividual's social skills. A sorority is an
ideal forum for the exchange of ideas and
concerns in a relaxed, noncompetitive
atmosphere, and the group structure
facilitates informal interaction with other
campus women's and men's groups. A
close rapport among the groups in the
Greek system, in particular, expands so
cial contacts and provides social experi
ences in the form of exchanges, work pro
jects and traditional activities unique to
the Greek system.
As well as providing social benefits, an
important emphasis in a sorority's struc
ture is the educational benefits for its
members.
Both graduate and undergraduate
scholarships are offered by nearly all
sororities, and an integral part of the
group's programming is educational ac
tivities. similar to activities supplied by
residential education. These include
speakers, demonstrations, films and
forums with Stanford and Palo Alto
community members.
Sororities also fill needs of the campus
and of the community, reaching another
goal set by the OSA.
They cosponsor women's activities
such as Women's Week and are involved
in career planning and placement. The
sororities have leaders, scholars, artists
and doers in their memberships and are
able to offer friendships and happiness for
many lonely and alienated women.
To the community the sororities also
offer their time, energy, talent and dedi
cation. Each sorority has a philanthropy
for which it works. Alpha Phi, for exam

pie, raises funds for the Stanford
Pediatric-Cardiology Ward as work for its
philanthropy, the Heart 112 und.
Several sororities aid Stanford
another way, through the money the UrfK
versity holds in trust for them.
The University received this money
when the sororities sold their houses at
the time of the ban in 1V44. Iliey left the
money in trust with the University in
hopes that the chapters would reactivate
and he recognized, and the money be
turned.
However, recognition has been difficult'
for the sororities to achieve for a variety,
ot reasons, yet each sorority has its own
points of contention with its national and
the University.
As student groups, sororities should
have equal rights with other student or
ganizations but these rights are being dc r ,.
nied by the University and the nationals.
Sorority women are caught in a bind and.
must fight and negotiate their way to ac
ceptance.
Die Office of Student Activities states
as its belief, "Whenever possible we
tend to assist students in reducing to a ,
minimum the amount of time and effort
they must spend in negotiating their needs ,
and interests within the University." . i
It is hard to put a good foot forward and |
slide back two steps. Sororities desire this ,
proferred assistance as a step on the road
to acceptance. Three years is a long time,.,
to wait and negotiate.

of what is learned in the encounters which
a student has . . . most of this synthesis
and integration necessarily goes on outside
of the classroom in out-of-class contacts
with other students . . . and with the
community beyond."
Sororities are a means of providing this
synthesis and a corresponding integration
of knowledge and skills within a beneficial
and supportive personal and community
environment. This means has already

been discovered by thousands of women
across the country during the last century.
One of the foremost advantages of
sorority membership is the opportunity
provided for leadership. In a competitive
campus environment, where most organi
zations are large and often impersonal,
assurance and self-confidence are pre
requisites for attaining leadership roles.
Sororities, however, provide a supportive
environment among women who come to
know and trust one another, feeling com
fortable taking on responsibility and ex
perimenting with new activities and roles.
The question most often asked of soror
ity members is "Why did you join?" And
the answer given is usually for the friend
ships. Interpersonal relationships support
the system and, in turn, the system pro
vides a healthy backdrop for the de
velopment of personal and coopertive in
teractions.
Again, the sororities have reflected the
OSA statement "that a healthy commun
ity life among students is important to the
full development of students at Stanford
. . . Since the structure and tradition of the
University emphasizes personal au
tonomy and competition among students,
we believe it is doubly important to pro
vide students with opportunities for in
terdependence and cooperation . . . We
are committed to helping students de
velop communities of interest through
which they can join with others in work
and play as well as in talk and intellectual
discourse."
Learning the functions of group
dynamics prepares the women for similar
experiences with organizations in the fu
ture. Qualities of cooperation and flexibil
ity are developed in the understanding of

the responsibilities of group membership.
The associations available through
sorority membership also develop an in
dividual's social skills. A sorority is an
ideal forum for the exchange of ideas and
concerns in a relaxed, noncompetitive
atmosphere, and the group structure
facilitates informal interaction with other
campus women's and men's groups. A
close rapport among the groups in the
Greek system, in particular, expands so
cial contacts and provides social experi
ences in the form of exchanges, work pro
jects and traditional activities unique to
the Greek system.
As well as providing social benefits, an
important emphasis in a sorority's struc
ture is the educational benefits for its
members.
Both graduate and undergraduate
scholarships are offered by nearly all
sororities, and an integral part of the
group's programming is educational ac
tivities. similar to activities supplied by
residential education. These include
speakers, demonstrations, films and
forums with Stanford and Palo Alto
community members.
Sororities also fill needs of the campus
and of the community, reaching another
goal set by the OSA.
They cosponsor women's activities
such as Women's Week and are involved
in career planning and placement. The
sororities have leaders, scholars, artists
and doers in their memberships and are
able to offer friendships and happiness for
many lonely and alienated women.
To the community the sororities also
offer their time, energy, talent and dedi
cation. Each sorority has a philanthropy
for which it works. Alpha Phi, for exam

pie, raises funds for the Stanford
Pediatric-Cardiology Ward as work for its
philanthropy, the Heart 112 und.
Several sororities aid Stanford
another way, through the money the UrfK
versity holds in trust for them.
The University received this money
when the sororities sold their houses at
the time of the ban in 1V44. Iliey left the
money in trust with the University in
hopes that the chapters would reactivate
and he recognized, and the money be
turned.
However, recognition has been difficult'
for the sororities to achieve for a variety,
ot reasons, yet each sorority has its own
points of contention with its national and
the University.
As student groups, sororities should
have equal rights with other student or
ganizations but these rights are being dc r ,.
nied by the University and the nationals.
Sorority women are caught in a bind and.
must fight and negotiate their way to ac
ceptance.
Die Office of Student Activities states
as its belief, "Whenever possible we
tend to assist students in reducing to a ,
minimum the amount of time and effort
they must spend in negotiating their needs ,
and interests within the University." . i
It is hard to put a good foot forward and |
slide back two steps. Sororities desire this ,
proferred assistance as a step on the road
to acceptance. Three years is a long time,.,
to wait and negotiate.

Sororities returned to the Stanford
community in 1977 after the administra
tion lifted a 33-year-old ban.The equality
demanded by Title IX partially acted as a
mediating force for their return, yet the
return would not have been possible or
successful had a need for such organiza
tions not existed on this campus.
Now in their third year on campus,
sororities continue to fill women's needs
as well as continue to participate in pro
jects and,activities which benefit both the
Stanford campus and community.
The functions, achievements and goals
of sororities satisfactorily fulfill the gen
eral goals and objectives set forth by the
Office of Student Activities (OSA), part
of the Office of Student Affairs which is
headed by Dean James Lyons.
ITie OSA deals with recognized volun
teer campus groups and has released a
report outlining goals and objectives for
these organizations.
