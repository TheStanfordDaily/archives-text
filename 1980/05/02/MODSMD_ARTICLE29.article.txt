Can't choose house
Because fraternities not only
exist but live in houses on Uni
versity land, a blatantly unequal
situation exists that absolutely
nothing is being done about.
Stanford women simply do not
have equal access to University
resources.
A woman who draws 3000
finds herself in Manzanita in a
trailer, while a man who draws
over 4000 can drop out of the
Draw, rush a fraternity and end
up in a room overlooking the
lake, Mayfield Ave. or a Jac
uzzi.
The diversity in housing in
which Stanford takes such pride
is simply not available to women.
Roughly 30 women can live in

houses in view of Latee Lagunita,
compared to approximately 150
men. More importantly, the
women are at the mercy of the
Draw for their spots, the men are
free to choose.
Speaking for a sorority that
was fortunate enough to meet
with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Associate
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson and present this
very issue, the final answer given
by Lyons himself was "Not ev
erything in life is fair." Is that
satisfactory?
Perhaps a viable solution to
the housing situation would be to
allow fraternities and sororities
to exist on campus as social or
ganizations, and turn all the

fraternities into co-ed houses.
No, this wouldn't be punishing
the fraternities, it would simply
be correcting an error that's long
overdue.

Stanford sororities are funda

It's that time of year again,
time for fraternity rush and
rush-related activities, and once
again guys are trolling White
Plaza with 115 pound-test line
and a good wire-core leader, in
quest of dates. Lures vary: luaus,
formals, theme parties and Bay
cruises. (With sororities grow
ing, the women are out trolling
too, but that's a different story.)
"Are Stanford fraternities re
ally 'different' than those at
other schools," the Daily asks, as
bait for this column. All anybody
has to do is look at other schools'
frats to see they are different.
Some people think some houses
here arc trashed. I walked into
the SAH house at the University
of Nevada, lTiey had a nice front
door, and a nice front room. The
rest of the house was in sham
bles. No one complains; the
pledges get the rooms with no
doors on them.
So it's really a question of
"how different" are Stanford
fraternities. In other words, are

they different enough to be
worthy of Stanford? To which I
ask. what is this big deal about
being different? Everyone at
Stanford seems to think they
have to be different than people
in the outside world. They come
here and try so hard to be diffe
rent that they end up being diffe
rent together, looking like each
other.
And are the fraternities re
sponsible members of the Stan
ford community? I'm not sure
what is meant by "responsible,"
but I know we're responsible for
most of the entertainment on
campus. "So what," you say. "a
bunch of beer busts." Well, all
those people who drink our beer
for free could go spend money in
bars. Or they could get cultured
and go to the theater, or the op
era, and so-on. which is great.
But you can go to the theater
when you're 99, and many folks
around here only have a few
years to get rowdy, rollicking
wasted before they have to be
come responsible.
F inally, are Stanford frater
nities "elitist?" And the answer is
yes. I hate the idea of picking one
guy over another, and it hurts me
at this time of the year. But soci
ety is elitist, and the good times
and the great friends I have
among the guys who chose me,
and the guys I had to choose,
makes up for the discomfort.

As a fraternity member. I have
visited about 15 different cam

mv organization from dozens'*

When some schools would i
visit our campus, they would '
drive their pick-ups through the i:
streets of Ann Arbur. Mich., sh
outing obscenities at other r
fraternities, women, small chil-ji
dren. dogs and squirrels. But be- i
fore we feel too superior, let us
remember beatings, broken glass :
and falling women. I would ex-'
pect, and have seen, the Stanford
fratenities to behave, on the av
erage, like Stanford students.
1 believe that the bad aspects
of fraternity life come from the
reputations which the houses re
ceive and are propagated
through the years. Friends are
alike, and this can work to the
detriment of the organization. It
has been said that fraternity men
are conservative, sexist, elitist,
frustrated jocks, that the goals of
the organization are fornication
and alcohol, and that fraternities
are very discriminating. There is
some truth to this, hut notice that
there is no reason why it must be.
Stanford Delta Tau Delta was
the first chapter in the organiza
tion to pledge a black (I960).
The USC chapter brought suit
(inside Delta Tau Delta). Stan
ford stuck to its principles and
won — Stanford was right.
Fraternities have their flaws.
They get rowdy, that's part of \
being 20. They do dumb things,
that's part of learning self- i
government. But if people leav
ing fraternities better under
stand how to exist in a democ
racy, how to compromise, and
what it is like to work toward a
goal, then fraternities are worth
it, without even considering the
benefits of brotherhood.

Can't choose house
Because fraternities not only
exist but live in houses on Uni
versity land, a blatantly unequal
situation exists that absolutely
nothing is being done about.
Stanford women simply do not
have equal access to University
resources.
A woman who draws 3000
finds herself in Manzanita in a
trailer, while a man who draws
over 4000 can drop out of the
Draw, rush a fraternity and end
up in a room overlooking the
lake, Mayfield Ave. or a Jac
uzzi.
The diversity in housing in
which Stanford takes such pride
is simply not available to women.
Roughly 30 women can live in

houses in view of Latee Lagunita,
compared to approximately 150
men. More importantly, the
women are at the mercy of the
Draw for their spots, the men are
free to choose.
Speaking for a sorority that
was fortunate enough to meet
with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Associate
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson and present this
very issue, the final answer given
by Lyons himself was "Not ev
erything in life is fair." Is that
satisfactory?
Perhaps a viable solution to
the housing situation would be to
allow fraternities and sororities
to exist on campus as social or
ganizations, and turn all the

fraternities into co-ed houses.
No, this wouldn't be punishing

But you can go to the theater
when you're 99, and many folks
around here only have a few

F inally, are Stanford frater

bunch of beer busts." Well, all
those people who drink our beer
for free could go spend money in
bars. Or they could get cultured
and go to the theater, or the op
era, and so-on. which is great.
But you can go to the theater
when you're 99, and many folks
around here only have a few
years to get rowdy, rollicking
wasted before they have to be
come responsible.
F inally, are Stanford frater
nities "elitist?" And the answer is
yes. I hate the idea of picking one
guy over another, and it hurts me
at this time of the year. But soci
ety is elitist, and the good times
and the great friends I have
among the guys who chose me,
and the guys I had to choose,
makes up for the discomfort.

Frats worth it
Fraternities, like all organiza
tions, are composed of people.
The people shape the fraternity
and the fraternity shapes people.
Some fraternities allow women
members, some do not. A large
number of national fraternities
at one time did not allow such
minority groups as blacks,
Catholics and Jews to be mem
bers. These are all facts, the
reputation of the fraternity sys

tern comes from how these facts
are interpreted.
As a fraternity member. I have
visited about 15 different cam
puses and talked to members of
mv organization from dozens'*

more.
When some schools would i
visit our campus, they would '
drive their pick-ups through the i:
streets of Ann Arbur. Mich., sh
outing obscenities at other r
fraternities, women, small chil-ji

fore we feel too superior, let us
remember beatings, broken glass :
and falling women. I would ex-'
pect, and have seen, the Stanford
fratenities to behave, on the av

1 believe that the bad aspects
of fraternity life come from the
reputations which the houses re
ceive and are propagated
through the years. Friends are
alike, and this can work to the
detriment of the organization. It
has been said that fraternity men
are conservative, sexist, elitist,
frustrated jocks, that the goals of
the organization are fornication
and alcohol, and that fraternities
are very discriminating. There is
some truth to this, hut notice that
there is no reason why it must be.
Stanford Delta Tau Delta was
the first chapter in the organiza
tion to pledge a black (I960).
The USC chapter brought suit
(inside Delta Tau Delta). Stan
ford stuck to its principles and
won — Stanford was right.
Fraternities have their flaws.
They get rowdy, that's part of \
being 20. They do dumb things,
that's part of learning self- i
government. But if people leav
ing fraternities better under
stand how to exist in a democ
racy, how to compromise, and
what it is like to work toward a
goal, then fraternities are worth
it, without even considering the
benefits of brotherhood.

Can't choose house
Because fraternities not only
exist but live in houses on Uni
versity land, a blatantly unequal
situation exists that absolutely
nothing is being done about.
Stanford women simply do not
have equal access to University
resources.
A woman who draws 3000
finds herself in Manzanita in a
trailer, while a man who draws
over 4000 can drop out of the
Draw, rush a fraternity and end
up in a room overlooking the
lake, Mayfield Ave. or a Jac
uzzi.
The diversity in housing in
which Stanford takes such pride
is simply not available to women.
Roughly 30 women can live in

houses in view of Latee Lagunita,
compared to approximately 150
men. More importantly, the
women are at the mercy of the
Draw for their spots, the men are
free to choose.
Speaking for a sorority that
was fortunate enough to meet
with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons and Associate
Dean of Residential Education
Norm Robinson and present this
very issue, the final answer given
by Lyons himself was "Not ev
erything in life is fair." Is that
satisfactory?
Perhaps a viable solution to
the housing situation would be to
allow fraternities and sororities
to exist on campus as social or
ganizations, and turn all the

fraternities into co-ed houses.
No, this wouldn't be punishing
the fraternities, it would simply
be correcting an error that's long
overdue.

Issue confused
In February, 1979, the Inter-
Sorority Council (ISC) submit
ted proposals for University rec
ognition. It was not until De
cember, 10 months later, that
sororities were officially denied
recognition because constitu
tions did not meet University
guidelines for residentially selec
tive groups. During this time.

there was a change in the per
sonnel handling the issue.
To date. University, ISC and
Panhallenic officials have not
met in the same room at the same
time to discuss the same issue.
The above incidents are just a
few examples which illustrate the
confusion and inefficiencies
which have surrounded the rec
ognition issue for the past two
years. I question whether
sororities really are being
evaluated objectively.
Sororities have enriched the
Stanford experience for many
women. Not only is it easier to
meet a cross-section of the
female student body, but it is
possible to have some continuity
of friendships.

Stanford sororities are funda
mentally different from groups
on other campuses. Academics
are a top priority here. Individu
als are involved in a variety of
other activities so the sorority is
typically only a small but valu
able part of a woman's campus
life. Finally, rush is held in the
spring so undergraduates, espe
cially freshmen, have time to ex
perience Stanford and to
evaluate whether or not a soror
ity would be right for them.
Stanford women reinstated
sororities here two years ago
fully aware of the past problems.
They have fought a hard and suc
cessful battle to overcome the
many stereotypes and pre
judices, and are still devoted to
developing a system that is fair
and can complement the Stan
ford experience.

Frats belong here
It's that time of year again,
time for fraternity rush and
rush-related activities, and once
again guys are trolling White
Plaza with 115 pound-test line
and a good wire-core leader, in
quest of dates. Lures vary: luaus,
formals, theme parties and Bay
cruises. (With sororities grow
ing, the women are out trolling
too, but that's a different story.)
"Are Stanford fraternities re
ally 'different' than those at
other schools," the Daily asks, as
bait for this column. All anybody
has to do is look at other schools'
frats to see they are different.
Some people think some houses
here arc trashed. I walked into
the SAH house at the University
of Nevada, lTiey had a nice front
door, and a nice front room. The
rest of the house was in sham
bles. No one complains; the
pledges get the rooms with no
doors on them.
So it's really a question of
"how different" are Stanford
fraternities. In other words, are

they different enough to be
worthy of Stanford? To which I
ask. what is this big deal about
being different? Everyone at
Stanford seems to think they
have to be different than people
in the outside world. They come
here and try so hard to be diffe
rent that they end up being diffe
rent together, looking like each
other.
And are the fraternities re
sponsible members of the Stan
ford community? I'm not sure
what is meant by "responsible,"
but I know we're responsible for
most of the entertainment on
campus. "So what," you say. "a
bunch of beer busts." Well, all
those people who drink our beer
for free could go spend money in
bars. Or they could get cultured
and go to the theater, or the op
era, and so-on. which is great.
But you can go to the theater
when you're 99, and many folks
around here only have a few
years to get rowdy, rollicking
wasted before they have to be
come responsible.
F inally, are Stanford frater
nities "elitist?" And the answer is
yes. I hate the idea of picking one
guy over another, and it hurts me
at this time of the year. But soci
ety is elitist, and the good times
and the great friends I have
among the guys who chose me,
and the guys I had to choose,
makes up for the discomfort.
