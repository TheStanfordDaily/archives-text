# Leader of rescue mission emerges: advised aborting
## 
### Fred Hoffman The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Col. Charles
Beckwith, the tough-talking Army
commando leader, said yesterday he
unhesitatingly recommended cancella
tion ol hist week's hostage rescue raid
m Iran because the breakdown of three
helicopters made it too risky.
Surfacing for the first time since the
mission was scrubbed, Bechwith made
clear he had no doubts his recommen
dation was correct, although he obvi
ously was disappointed that long
months of preparation were wasted.
The 51-year-old commander of the
90-man Army-Marine commando
strike force bristled when asked about
reports he wanted to proceed with the
mission even though he had only five
usable helicopters, one below what
planners had fixed as a safe minimum.
"I'm not about to be a party to a
half-assed loadingofa bunch of aircraft
and going up and murdering a bunch of
fine soldiers," Beckwith told Pentagon
reporters."l'm not that kind of a man."
Dressed in civilian slacks, an open
collared blue shirt and a gold jacket,
Beckwith said everything went
smoothly up to the point where the
commandos arrived at a lonely desert
position for refueling, although he had
heard on the radio of the C-130 trans
port plane in which he was riding that
two of eight helicopters had dropped
out.
Helicopter failed
Then, he said, he was told by the
pilot of one of hte helicopters at the
desert staging site that the machine

could not fly. Ibis helicopter, it has
been said, had developed hydraulic
problems.
Beckwith said he quickly conferred
with the overall commander on the
scene, an Air Force colonel, and said:
"My recommendation is to abort."
His recommendation was the crucial
one because he would lead the next
critical stages ot the operation —
movement of his commandos from the
desert to a mountain hideout about 100
miles from Tehran, and then, the next
night, into the city by truck to try and
snatch the 53 American hostages from
their armed captors.
Beckwith said there was "a little dis
cussion" vsith the Air Force colonel in
charge, who asked him it he would con

sider going on with only five helicop
ters.
"1 considered this for a few seconds
and then replied,'No way,"' Beckwith
said.
He stressed that "it was planned that
it we didn't ha\ e sufficient helicopters,
we'd abort." •
L'nder wraps
Beckwith has been kept under wraps
and it is known senior Army officials
wanted to shield him from possible
"harassment." But defense superiors
obviously overrode Army objections in
order to dispute rumors that Beckwith
wanted to continue the mission, had
been overruled and that he was so
angry he was planning to retire or res
ign
Asked about such reports, Beckwith
replied: "Pure bullshit."
Go-ahead
After receiving a go-ahead to end
the mission anil evacuate, the force on
the ground scuiried about in an effort
to get everybody and as much equip
ment as possible into the departing air
craft. as Beckwith sketched the scene.
rhen came the collision of a helicop
ter with a C-130 as the chopper was
topping-tiff its fuel tanks, resulting in
what Beckwith called "one hell of a
fire."
He said explosives and ammunition,
as well as fuel were flaming and deto
nating and that 39 of his men and some
Air 1 orce support personnel managed
to escape from the burning C-130
through a single side door.
Eight Marine and Air Force crew
men died in the helicopter and the
C-130.
Crewmen saved
Beckwith said four of his men "went
literally into the plane" and saved two
C-130 crewmen, both of whom were
badly burned. He said the four com
mandos were slightly burn d
Stressing the haste under which they
were operating. Beckwith said he was
worried about daylight catching us on
the ground."
Although he wanted to cl< n up, as
he put it.and leav • no equipment be
lli: ' lie itn.ii ated was not j sible to
act -V e this -npi telv because of the
time pres* e ! the explosive condi
tions.
Asked why efforts were not made to
take out the bodies of the eight dead,
Beckwith said. "I did three years in
Vietnam and don't like to leave any
body."
But. he added."l don't think it's very
prudent" to endanger the living to

bring out the dead.
Beckwith said he was on the ground
at the desert refueling site for four
hours and 58 minutes and that one
hour and 15 minutes of that time
elapsed between his recommendation
to abort and the take off from the
scene.
beckwith recalls that he was aboard
the first aircraft to land at the base 200
miles southeast of Tehran, near Pabas.
"I went out on the first aircraft, and
we landed on a dirt strip. . . . The
weather was clear, temperature bet
ween 50 and 63.1 looked up at the stars
and there was some haze. But it cer
tainly wasn't haze that would block
someone's vision.
"I had walked approximately 100
yards toward an unimproved road that
was to my north ... I looked up, and
there was a Mercedes bus loaded with
personnel, corning in our direction.
"We had made plans for the sort of
situation. We immediately put into ac
tion one of the drills we had prepared
for.
"We over l u 'u.> and under the
us. We 'U'ppcd the bus. There were
elderly people. ITiere were very young
children. In my judgment, because I
didn't stop to count, 44 personnel in
total. . . .

scene with me that I took in. and I

Beckwith said.
WASHINGTON — Col. Charles
Beckwith, the tough-talking Army
commando leader, said yesterday he
unhesitatingly recommended cancella
tion ol hist week's hostage rescue raid
m Iran because the breakdown of three
helicopters made it too risky.
Surfacing for the first time since the
mission was scrubbed, Bechwith made
clear he had no doubts his recommen
dation was correct, although he obvi
ously was disappointed that long
months of preparation were wasted.
The 51-year-old commander of the
90-man Army-Marine commando
strike force bristled when asked about
reports he wanted to proceed with the
mission even though he had only five
usable helicopters, one below what
planners had fixed as a safe minimum.
"I'm not about to be a party to a
half-assed loadingofa bunch of aircraft
and going up and murdering a bunch of
fine soldiers," Beckwith told Pentagon
reporters."l'm not that kind of a man."
Dressed in civilian slacks, an open
collared blue shirt and a gold jacket,
Beckwith said everything went
smoothly up to the point where the
commandos arrived at a lonely desert
position for refueling, although he had
heard on the radio of the C-130 trans
port plane in which he was riding that
two of eight helicopters had dropped
out.
Helicopter failed
Then, he said, he was told by the
pilot of one of hte helicopters at the
desert staging site that the machine

could not fly. Ibis helicopter, it has
been said, had developed hydraulic
problems.
Beckwith said he quickly conferred
with the overall commander on the
scene, an Air Force colonel, and said:
"My recommendation is to abort."
His recommendation was the crucial
one because he would lead the next
critical stages ot the operation —
movement of his commandos from the
desert to a mountain hideout about 100
miles from Tehran, and then, the next
night, into the city by truck to try and
snatch the 53 American hostages from
their armed captors.
Beckwith said there was "a little dis
cussion" vsith the Air Force colonel in
charge, who asked him it he would con

sider going on with only five helicop
ters.
"1 considered this for a few seconds
and then replied,'No way,"' Beckwith
said.
He stressed that "it was planned that
it we didn't ha\ e sufficient helicopters,
we'd abort." •
L'nder wraps
Beckwith has been kept under wraps
and it is known senior Army officials
wanted to shield him from possible
"harassment." But defense superiors
obviously overrode Army objections in
order to dispute rumors that Beckwith
wanted to continue the mission, had
been overruled and that he was so
angry he was planning to retire or res
ign
Asked about such reports, Beckwith
replied: "Pure bullshit."
Go-ahead
After receiving a go-ahead to end
the mission anil evacuate, the force on
the ground scuiried about in an effort
to get everybody and as much equip
ment as possible into the departing air
craft. as Beckwith sketched the scene.
rhen came the collision of a helicop
ter with a C-130 as the chopper was
topping-tiff its fuel tanks, resulting in
what Beckwith called "one hell of a
fire."
He said explosives and ammunition,
as well as fuel were flaming and deto
nating and that 39 of his men and some
Air 1 orce support personnel managed
to escape from the burning C-130
through a single side door.
Eight Marine and Air Force crew
men died in the helicopter and the
C-130.
Crewmen saved
Beckwith said four of his men "went
literally into the plane" and saved two
C-130 crewmen, both of whom were
badly burned. He said the four com
mandos were slightly burn d
Stressing the haste under which they
were operating. Beckwith said he was
worried about daylight catching us on
the ground."
Although he wanted to cl< n up, as
he put it.and leav • no equipment be
lli: ' lie itn.ii ated was not j sible to
act -V e this -npi telv because of the
time pres* e ! the explosive condi
tions.
Asked why efforts were not made to
take out the bodies of the eight dead,
Beckwith said. "I did three years in
Vietnam and don't like to leave any
body."
But. he added."l don't think it's very
prudent" to endanger the living to

bring out the dead.
Beckwith said he was on the ground
at the desert refueling site for four
hours and 58 minutes and that one
hour and 15 minutes of that time
elapsed between his recommendation
to abort and the take off from the
scene.
beckwith recalls that he was aboard
the first aircraft to land at the base 200
miles southeast of Tehran, near Pabas.
"I went out on the first aircraft, and
we landed on a dirt strip. . . . The
weather was clear, temperature bet
ween 50 and 63.1 looked up at the stars
and there was some haze. But it cer
tainly wasn't haze that would block
someone's vision.
"I had walked approximately 100
yards toward an unimproved road that
was to my north ... I looked up, and
there was a Mercedes bus loaded with
personnel, corning in our direction.
"We had made plans for the sort of

for.
"We over l u 'u.> and under the
