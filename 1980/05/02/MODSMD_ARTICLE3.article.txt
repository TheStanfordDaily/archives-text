# Leader of rescue mission emerges: advised aborting
## 
### Fred Hoffman The Associated Press 
WASHINGTON — Col. Charles
Beckwith, the tough-talking Army
commando leader, said yesterday he
unhesitatingly recommended cancella
tion ol hist week's hostage rescue raid
m Iran because the breakdown of three
helicopters made it too risky.
Surfacing for the first time since the
mission was scrubbed, Bechwith made
clear he had no doubts his recommen
dation was correct, although he obvi
ously was disappointed that long
months of preparation were wasted.
The 51-year-old commander of the
90-man Army-Marine commando
strike force bristled when asked about
reports he wanted to proceed with the
mission even though he had only five
usable helicopters, one below what
planners had fixed as a safe minimum.
"I'm not about to be a party to a
half-assed loadingofa bunch of aircraft
and going up and murdering a bunch of
fine soldiers," Beckwith told Pentagon
reporters."l'm not that kind of a man."
Dressed in civilian slacks, an open
collared blue shirt and a gold jacket,
Beckwith said everything went
smoothly up to the point where the
commandos arrived at a lonely desert
position for refueling, although he had
heard on the radio of the C-130 trans
port plane in which he was riding that
two of eight helicopters had dropped
out.
Helicopter failed
Then, he said, he was told by the
pilot of one of hte helicopters at the
desert staging site that the machine

could not fly. Ibis helicopter, it has
been said, had developed hydraulic
problems.
Beckwith said he quickly conferred
with the overall commander on the
scene, an Air Force colonel, and said:
"My recommendation is to abort."
His recommendation was the crucial
one because he would lead the next
critical stages ot the operation —
movement of his commandos from the
desert to a mountain hideout about 100
miles from Tehran, and then, the next
night, into the city by truck to try and
snatch the 53 American hostages from
their armed captors.
Beckwith said there was "a little dis
cussion" vsith the Air Force colonel in
charge, who asked him it he would con

sider going on with only five helicop
ters.
"1 considered this for a few seconds
and then replied,'No way,"' Beckwith
said.
He stressed that "it was planned that
it we didn't ha\ e sufficient helicopters,
we'd abort." •
L'nder wraps
Beckwith has been kept under wraps
and it is known senior Army officials
wanted to shield him from possible
"harassment." But defense superiors
obviously overrode Army objections in
order to dispute rumors that Beckwith
wanted to continue the mission, had
been overruled and that he was so
angry he was planning to retire or res
