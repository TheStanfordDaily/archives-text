## Alpha Chi working to iron out kinks 
### 
You joined a sorority? Are you kidding me.'
Get serious! This was the reaction I got most
often when I first joined Alpha Chi Omega.
Why did I become a sorority "sister?"
Heaven only knows. I certainly heard plenty
of discouraging words from my friends when
I first joined. Neither of my parents are
"Greeks," so that wasn't it. Both of my
brothers graduated from college in the late
'60s when anti-frat rumblings were at a
climax, so it wasn't their influence either.
Why did I do it? It was me — my choice
and decision alone. Joining a sorority was a
big decision for me and I'm really glad I took
the leap. It has definitely made my experi
ence at Stanford even better. I've learned a
great deal from the other members of my
sorority. Each of us in Alpha Chi is an indi
vidual — we all have our own academic and
career goals, as well as outside interests.
Alpha Chi came to Stanford in the fall ot
1978 — the last sorority to arrive. I had "no
clue" about the workings of a sorority.
Naturally, as the first members, we had to
learn the ropes and our alums helped us tre
mendously. Without them, we would have
never made it through the first few hectic
months. Now. we are a full-fledged chapter
and our alums serve us in an advisory capac
ity. They give us suggestions which we are
free to accept or reject. We arc typical Stan
ford students in that we utilize our alum sup
port fully — but we insist on being indepen
dent - free to make our own decisions.

We are concerned with making Alplii Chi
and the sorority system an integral part of
Stanford because we feel that it enhances the
Stanford experience. We are working to
gether with the other Stanford sororities and
the Inter-Sorority Council (ISC) to iron out
the kinks and strengthen our system.
Therefore, when we — Alpha Chi and the
alums alike — learned of the incident regard
ing the telephoning of rushees homes for re
commendations, we were surprised and out
raged. Required recsare nothing new. Many
sororities require that the women they
pledge be "recommended." The purpose of a
rec is to confirm the qualities of the future
sorority member. Recs, in and of themselves,
aren't bad — as long as they don't infringe on
personal privacy.
I can't give you all the answers regarding
the use of recs. Personally, I have very little
knowledge about them because Alpha Chi
does not require recs for women we pledge.
We receive recs on women we met through
rush and we put them in the rushees file —
hut they are not required. It is my impression
that recs are not a bad thingper se. For many
sororities they are simply a formality. Cer
tainly, they are not intended to be an investi
gation.
What happened to Carol Chesarek was
unfortunate. In her column appearing in
Monday's Daily, she raises several questions
— and basically all of them concern the
means by which the ISC and Stanford can

keep sororities "in line." Although I can un
derstand Chesarek's dismay — because I
share it — I feel that answers arc readily
available.
Stanford's sororities went to work with the
ISC. After all, ISC is made up of women who
arc members of each of Stanford's seven
sororities. Naturally, ISC is striving to make
up a cohesive set of rules, and it is in each
sorority's best interest to follow the rules as
determined by ISC. No sorority member I
know is happy about what happened. We are
striving to be recognized by the University
and most certainly it was no one's intention
to infringe on anyone's personal rights. Un
fortunately, the San Jose Panhellenic Rep
resentative did just this. Obviously, she did
not have her thinking cap on.
ISC must develop a concrete set of
guidelines regarding rec gathering and make
it available to all area Panhellenic groups.
We all want to prevent such an incident from
happening again. The fact remains, rccs are
required by some groups, but if they are ob
tained "above board" they should not be
regarded as a detrimental aspect of the soror
ity system. Sororities do belong at Stanford
and they can contribute positively to the
Stanford experience. It is unfortunate that
this incident occurred, but it ran be remedied
and then we can proceed toward attaining
our goal of official University recognition.
