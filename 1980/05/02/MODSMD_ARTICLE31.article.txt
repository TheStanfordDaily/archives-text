# Chemical warfare experts to tour world
## U.S. seeks poison gas investigation 
### Michael Getler The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — A team of U.S. chem
ical warfare experts will tour overseas capi
tals next month to gather support for crea
tion of an international commission to inves
tigate charges that the Soviet Union or its
allies are using poison gas in Laos, Cambodia
and Afghanistan.
The idea, officials said last week, is not to
convince other countries on the spot that
communist forces are in fact' using such
weapons. Rather, it is to make the case that
there is sufficient concern and circumstantial
evidence to warrant setting up a neutral
commission of scientific experts or other in
ternational forum.
There is also an awareness that charges by
the United States alone probably would be
viewed as propaganda in many parts of the
world.
At a joint session of two House Foreign
Affairs subcommittees last week, Thomas
Davies of the U.S. Arms Control and Disar
mament Agency testified that:
"We recognize that in the present interna
tional political environment it may be dif
ficult to gain broad support for an investiga
tion. Many countries, including some
friendly to us, may suspect that our principal
motivation is to embarrass our adversaries;
this is not the case," he said.
Others, he said, "may consider our ap
proach hypocritical in view of the U.S. use of
riot control agents and herbicides in Viet
nam" — which are non-lethal.
"Nonetheless," Davies told the panel, "we
are determined to press ahead and to try to
persuade others of the need for an investiga
tion. We recognize that to be accepted our
approach must be based on principle."
Extent of usage?
Another witness, Harvard University
biochemistry professor Matthew Neselson,
challenged administration allegations about
the extent of poison gas usage, but also called
for international investigations.
Noting that reports of chemical warfare in
Laos have been going on for years and those
involving Afghanistan for four months with-

out hard, confirming evidence, Meselson
said, "what we have in the present situation is
the worst of both worlds.
'if the unconfirmed allegations of the use
of poison gas are false, continued doubt
serves only to erode the existing restraints
against chemical warfare and to undermine
the basis for effective arms control.
"If, on the other hand, the allegations are
true, our inability to document them pre
vents us from having much impact on the
actual course of events."
Geneva protocol
The Geneva protocol of 1925 prohibits the
first use in war of lethal or incapacitating
chemical agents. But the protocol provides
no mechanism for investigation.
Furthermore, Under Secretary of State
Matthew Nimetz pointed out to the panel last
week that Cambodia, Laos and Afghanistan
are not parties to the protocol and that the
Soviets adhered to it with a reservation that
they would not be bound with regard to
states that are not parties.
Aside from approaching allies and key
non-aligned governments, Nimetz said the
United States was considering raising the
issue in the U.N. General Assembly session
this fall.
Uncertainty
Nimetz said, "We are not in a position
either to confirm or disprove conclusively
reports of the use of chemical weapons in
remote areas where the U.S. government has
,no presence."
But, in a country-by-country rundown, he
said information "at our disposal" supports
the conclusion that Vietnamese and Lao
forces have used chemical agents to gain con
trol over dissident tribesmen for several
years.
U.S. estimates, based on interviews with
refugees, are that about 700 to 1000 persons
may have died and several times that number
made ill by chemical agents, he said.
In Cambodia, he said, the evidence is "less
substantial" but enough to "warrant serious
concern."
In Afghanistan, he said, "we regard it as

highly likely that the Soviet inva
have used non-lethal chemical agents in their
efforts to suppress Afghan resistance" and
the chances are "about even" that lethal
agents also have been used, based on refugee
reports.
Privately, officials last week confirmed the
general outline of a Boston (Jlohe report that
some Soviet weapons that may be poison gas
canisters have been retrieved from the Af
ghan battlefield and are being studied at the
Army's Edgewood Arsenal (Md.). Other
items, including clothing, also have been re
trieved.
Yet one official cautioned against putting
too much hope into such efforts to gain "hard
evidence." He called the chemical warfare
field "the most complicated and frustrating"
in terms of trying to find traces of short-lived
agents.
Inability to perform autopsies, or even to
bring bodies out over long distances, or to
quickly and properly encase possibly con
taminated equipment at the scene, creates
monumental problems of proof, he said.
USSR anthrax outbreak
Meselson also challenged public State De
partment suggestions in March that the out
break of anthrax in the Soviet city of
Sverdlovsk last year was caused by an acci
dent at a Soviet plant producing biological
weapons. If true, this could mean Moscow
violated at 1975 convention that bans pro
duction of such poisons.
Meselson said reports in the West Ger
man, Israeli and U.S. press about the inci
dent left him "with serious doubts."
He said research of Soviet literature has
turned up 100 references to the disease in
articles over 15 years, showing that the dis
ease itself was "a major problem" generally
for the Soviets. He said about I million
Soviets are innoculated against it each year,
which means that the Soviets must have to
grow the bacteria in order to produce the
vaccine.
He said he also was unconvinced by the
Soviet explanation of what happened, but
felt it was not all clear that a treaty had been
violated.
