# ON CALL

I've been biding my time the past week wait
ing patiently by the telephone for all your in
quiries or solicitations, but have I received even
one call? Noooo. So, nothing's new.
Here's a question from a Stern resident.
What causes heartburn, and can I prevent it
once I've eaten several delights from "South of
the Border"?
-Fired Up
For all of you out there in newspaper land
who aren't acquainted with "South of the Bor
der," it's the stand in the Transition featuring
"Mexican" food. Should you ever partake of
any real Mexican or, hotter yet. New Mexican
sizzlers, here's the answer to your question.
Dr. John Dorman at Cowell said he thinks of
heartburn as a regurgitation of stomach acid
into the esophagus, where one can sometimes
even experience an unpleasant taste. Dr. Vin
cent D'Andrea elaborated that the condition is
caused by inflamation of the stomach and the
esophagus, usually from irritating contact with
spicy food. The irritant remains in place until
washed away, and the hapless victim suffers a
burning sensation in the lower chest and upper
abdomen.
Both physicians recommended the use of an
over-the-counter antacid and water to relieve
heartburn. If the problem is recurrent and per
sistent, you should be evaluated by a doctor.
What could more depressing than Stern
food? Read on.
Is suicide on the increase among people in our
age group?
- Burned Out
A 1978 study found that from 1961 until
1975, suicides by persons in the 20-24 year
category increased 130 percent, according to
D'Andrea. The trend has not been so markedly
on the upswing at Stanford, however. The Farm
has witnessed a flat suicide rate over the past 10
years, D'Andrea said.
From 1963 to 1978, 19 suicides were commit
ted here, for an average of around 1.2 per year.
The ratio of male to female suicides was six to
one. and slightly more graduate students ended
their abject misery than didundergrads. Most of
the acts succeeded by jumps, firearms or poison
ing.
In comparison, the entire UC system witnes

sed 23 suicides over a ten-year period. Also, a
word to the wise to all you aspiring Rhodes
Scholars: Oxford has the worst record of all
bastions of higher learning worldwide. In one
year, 26.4 Oxford students killed themselves, a
figure over six times greater than the British
average for that age group and 5.9 times more
than the rate for other English universities.
Dr. Dorman said he investigated campus
suicide by ingestion a few years ago and dis
cerned several patterns. Women are more likely
to attempt suicide, but men are more likely to
succeed, he found. Women usually use pills or
slash their wrists, while men shoot themselves
or leap off tall buildings (which may explain the
success differential). The kinds of drugs taken in
suicide attempts have changed over the years,
he said. In the late '60s and early '70s suicides
were apt to overdose on barbituates. In the mid
'70s Valium moved up to assume that popular
distinction.

At long last, here's the noise information 1
promised you weeks ago, when responding to a
question concerning Rock 'n Roll Ear.
Damage to the ear is a combination of the
loudness of the noise and the length of time
exposed to it. according to Aeronautics and As
tronautics Professor Vincent Salmon.
Of persons listening to 90 dba (decibels dis
regarding low frequency) sound for eight hours
a day, five days a week, 50 weeks a year for a
working lifetime of 15 to 20 years, 15 to 20
percent would experience appreciable hearing
loss in detecting the spoken word. To give you
an idea of a decibel: two persons speaking in a
normal tone, or perhaps a little louder than
average, about two-and-a-half feet apart are
subjecting their ears to about 65-70 decibels. A
vacuum cleaner noise is about 70 decibels.
For the same amount of expected hearing
loss, the time exposure must decrease by a fac
tor of two for every five decibels the sound
increases, Salmon said. Listening to 100 de
cibels for two hours a day during a full working
lifetime would most likely not cause appreciable
hearing loss, he concluded.
In other words, unless you're a rock musician,
you're probably pretty safe.
