# Schonert, Evans picked by Chicago and New Orleans
## 
### Peter Finch Sports Editor 
II you heard some high
volume voices booming out of
the off-campus wasteland Wed
nesday morning, there may be a
logical explanation.
Chances are it was Turk
Schonert and Chuck Evans, both
seniors, both of the
Stanford football team. The
reason they may very well ha\e
let out a couple of the loudest
shouts-for-joy heard in these
parts for some time, is simple.
For on that morning, each was
informed of his selection in the
National Football League's an
nual draft.
Schonert. the nation's leading
passer last y ear. was picked up by
the Chicago Bears in the ninth
round of the draft. F\ans, a Stan
ford stand-out at defensive
tackle, was drafted as a
linebacker by the New Orleans
Saints in the eighth round.
The Cardinal duo joined
teammate Andre Hines. picked
Tuesday b\ the Seattle Sea
hawks. and 1 1 other Northern
California athletes who were
selected by NFL clubs.
"I figured I'd go in the middle
rounds," Schonert said yester
day."I didn't get my hopes too
high because I saw what hap
pened to (Gordy) Ceresino."
(Ceresino. a former Stanford
star was not chosen in last year's
draft and eventually signed with
the San Francisco 49crs.)

Schonert looks confidently
torwurd to his experience in the
pros with excitement and little
hesitation.
"It doesn't really scare me."
he said. "Chicago's a big town,
and I've never really been to the
Midwest. I've spent most tit m\
time in California, but I'm sure
I'll adjust."
Next Thursday, Schonert will
have a chance to see just how
well he'll adjust when he flys to
Chicago for a "mini-camp."
Regular camp won't begin until
midsummer.
Now that it's all o\ er, Schonert
feels "vety relieved. Waiting to
hear from a team was a painful
experience." he said.
"Tuesday.all my friends kept
coming over or calling to see how
it was going. I just sat by the
phone and waited. The phone
must have rung 50 times and it
was never them. Then I just for
got about it and went to bed.
"1 woke up early the next
morning and didn't hear any
thing tor a while. I was pretty
bummed out. Then 1 heard from
Chicago and I let out a holler. I
was very excited."
It was a slightly different story
for E\ans, who was awakened at
8 in the morning by a phone call
from the Saints.
"1 was totally crashed when
they called," he said. But he was
nevertheless very excited to hear
from them. "It's the best possible
situation for me." he continued.

"They need help on defense, and
that's where 1 can help out. The
situation is really ideal.
"1 think New Orleans is a good
place for me to go. I've been
there twice when we played
I ulunc. I've been to Bourbon
Street twice, too. Unit place re
ally tore me up. I better keep
myself under control there "
I tiesday night Evans was at
Schonert's house, along with
Mines and a few other friends.
I here he relaxed and tried not to
think about the whole affair.
"I really didn't think much
about going away," he said.
"And now I'm going all the way
to New Orleans and I'm really
keyed for it."
Once he gets there, Evans will
have to learn the fine points of
playing in the linebacker slot,
something lie's only done once
— at the East-West Shrine game
this year. But the only problem
Evans t'orsees in adjusting to his
new position will be working in a
pass defense.
"I'll probably play the run the
same way." he said. "But man
to-man coverage may give me
some problems."
Like Schonert. Evans is ap
proaching his new job with
gusto. "When you get to this
point, he said, "you have to go
in with your guns flarin ."
And you can bet Evans.
Schonert and Hines will do just
that.

II you heard some high
volume voices booming out of
the off-campus wasteland Wed
nesday morning, there may be a
logical explanation.
Chances are it was Turk
Schonert and Chuck Evans, both
seniors, both of the
Stanford football team. The
reason they may very well ha\e
let out a couple of the loudest
shouts-for-joy heard in these
parts for some time, is simple.
For on that morning, each was
informed of his selection in the
National Football League's an
nual draft.
Schonert. the nation's leading
passer last y ear. was picked up by
the Chicago Bears in the ninth
round of the draft. F\ans, a Stan
ford stand-out at defensive
tackle, was drafted as a
linebacker by the New Orleans
Saints in the eighth round.
The Cardinal duo joined
teammate Andre Hines. picked
Tuesday b\ the Seattle Sea
hawks. and 1 1 other Northern
California athletes who were
selected by NFL clubs.
"I figured I'd go in the middle
rounds," Schonert said yester
day."I didn't get my hopes too
high because I saw what hap
pened to (Gordy) Ceresino."
(Ceresino. a former Stanford
star was not chosen in last year's
draft and eventually signed with
the San Francisco 49crs.)

Schonert looks confidently
torwurd to his experience in the

hesitation.
