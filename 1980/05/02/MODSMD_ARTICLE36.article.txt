# Card-9 breaks streak in 10-1 loss
## 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
Fresh off u three game sweep
o£"si\-Pac" bully Arizona State,
the Cardinals had the air let out
of their balloon Tuesday night.
,But as they say, what goes up
must come down.
Tuesday 's loss to Fresno State.
10-1. is yet another indication
that the Cards, in the immortal
wprds of Donny Osmond, are
like a yo-yo. Sometimes they're
up and other times, well, they're
not so up.
And as they travel to So Cal
this weekend to take on UCLA,
the Cards are indeed hoping for
another shot of helium ... or
whatever.
"If we're to have a realistic
shot at winning the league, we
have got to win at least two of the
three games at UCI.A. If we
don't, well then we're out of it,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
Stanford's league chances
were improved markedly by the
sweep of the Sun Devils this past
weekend, but they're not out of
the*woods yet. With six games
left in the league, the Cards re
main four games behind fron
trunning Cal. And the Cards
have yet to win on the road in
Pac-10 competition this year.
But there may be light at the
end of the tunnel. If the Cards
play well this weekend, they
have a good shot at second at
least, which would send them to
a best of three series against the
Pac-10 Northern Division
champion. And in Berkeley this
weekend, Cal and second place
Arizona ram horns in a "crucial
series" according to Marquess.
"The Arizona-Cal series could

very well determine the league.
Cal has been playing \er\ well
and they're tough to beat at
home. Still. 1 don't see anyone
sweeping the other." Marquess
added. "
As for the UCLAns, they are
currently riding the cellar of the
league, a game and a halt' behind
the Cardinals.
"UCLA hasn't been hitting
ball well lately but they have
a couple of good pitchers. So
they are capable of playing well.
It just depends when we catch
them", reported Marquess.
"And we are playing inconsis
tently. so it also depends on how
they catch us," he added.
How UCLA catches Stanford
in a doubleheader on Saturday
and a single game on Sunday in
Malibu. where the Bruins are
playing their home games this
year, remains to be seen.
But how they hit Stanford
pitching is even more dubious.
Card hurler Larry Kuhn. coming
off the Cards first Pac-10 confer
ence shutout,mi four years, will
get the nod in the first game.
Because of the doubleheader
on Saturday. Marquess won't be
able to use the system he has
been using lately, that is. throw
ing Kuhn and Mignano in the
first game of a series and then
bringing them right back for the
third game.
Rather, this weekend. Mar
quess is going to let Kuhn and
Mignano. the starters on Satur
day. "throw as long as they can.
There is no use saving anything.
This is it."
1 uesday's disaster, however,
was not it
Fresno State pounded 11 hits

off a combination of three Card
pitchers, Mignano, Bob Boat
man. and Cline. But defensive
errors were just as costly .
Said Marquess, "We didn't
play well defensively. And when
we're not getting the good pitch
ing. along with poor defensive
play, we just don't play well."
Fresno State is no slouch,
though. Their \ ictory Tuesday
upped their record to 40-7 for

the year. That's right. 40 wins.
I hey are currently ranked
somewhere in the national top
five, and that's not Dick Clark's
American Bandstand, either.
Marquess didn't attribute the
loss to a post-ASU let-up how
ever. "It was not a let-down. You
can always say that we were look
ing ahead toward UCLA. But
the tact is. we just didn't play
well."

"And we are playing inconsis
tently. so it also depends on how
they catch us," he added.
How UCLA catches Stanford
in a doubleheader on Saturday
and a single game on Sunday in
Malibu. where the Bruins are
playing their home games this
year, remains to be seen.
But how they hit Stanford
pitching is even more dubious.
Card hurler Larry Kuhn. coming
off the Cards first Pac-10 confer
ence shutout,mi four years, will
get the nod in the first game.
Because of the doubleheader
on Saturday. Marquess won't be
able to use the system he has
been using lately, that is. throw
ing Kuhn and Mignano in the
first game of a series and then
bringing them right back for the
third game.
Rather, this weekend. Mar
quess is going to let Kuhn and
Mignano. the starters on Satur
day. "throw as long as they can.
There is no use saving anything.
This is it."
1 uesday's disaster, however,
was not it
Fresno State pounded 11 hits

off a combination of three Card
pitchers, Mignano, Bob Boat
man. and Cline. But defensive
errors were just as costly .
Said Marquess, "We didn't
play well defensively. And when
we're not getting the good pitch
ing. along with poor defensive
play, we just don't play well."
Fresno State is no slouch,
though. Their \ ictory Tuesday
upped their record to 40-7 for

the year. That's right. 40 wins.
I hey are currently ranked
somewhere in the national top
five, and that's not Dick Clark's
American Bandstand, either.
Marquess didn't attribute the
loss to a post-ASU let-up how
ever. "It was not a let-down. You
can always say that we were look
ing ahead toward UCLA. But
the tact is. we just didn't play
well."

Fresh off u three game sweep
o£"si\-Pac" bully Arizona State,
the Cardinals had the air let out
of their balloon Tuesday night.
,But as they say, what goes up
must come down.
Tuesday 's loss to Fresno State.
10-1. is yet another indication
that the Cards, in the immortal
wprds of Donny Osmond, are
like a yo-yo. Sometimes they're
up and other times, well, they're
not so up.
And as they travel to So Cal
this weekend to take on UCLA,
the Cards are indeed hoping for
another shot of helium ... or
whatever.
"If we're to have a realistic
shot at winning the league, we
have got to win at least two of the
three games at UCI.A. If we
don't, well then we're out of it,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
Stanford's league chances
were improved markedly by the
sweep of the Sun Devils this past
weekend, but they're not out of
the*woods yet. With six games
left in the league, the Cards re
main four games behind fron
trunning Cal. And the Cards
have yet to win on the road in
Pac-10 competition this year.
But there may be light at the
end of the tunnel. If the Cards
play well this weekend, they
have a good shot at second at
least, which would send them to
a best of three series against the
Pac-10 Northern Division
champion. And in Berkeley this
weekend, Cal and second place
Arizona ram horns in a "crucial
series" according to Marquess.
"The Arizona-Cal series could

very well determine the league.
Cal has been playing \er\ well
and they're tough to beat at
home. Still. 1 don't see anyone
sweeping the other." Marquess
added. "
As for the UCLAns, they are
currently riding the cellar of the
league, a game and a halt' behind
the Cardinals.
"UCLA hasn't been hitting
ball well lately but they have
a couple of good pitchers. So
they are capable of playing well.
It just depends when we catch
them", reported Marquess.
"And we are playing inconsis
tently. so it also depends on how
they catch us," he added.
