## The 						Friday Interview Andre Hines talks draft 
### 
(Editor's Note: Andre Mines, a senior offensive
tackle, was picked in the second round of the NFL
Draft Tuesday after starting for only one season at
Stanford. In this Friday Interview with Sally Jen
kins, Hines explains his feelings at this profound
juncture in his life.)
Jeifkins: Did you expect to get drafted or did you
intend to he a free agent?
Hines: 1 expected to get drafted, but at the same
time I knew it wasn't going to be my decision.
Everyone 1 talked to in the NFL said \ would be
drafted.
Jenkins: Did you expect to he drafted ahead of Turk
Schonert and Chuck Evans?
Hines: Yes.
Jenkins: How do you feel about Seattle, as a team
and as a town?
Hines: As a team, it's a young team, a real aggres
sive team.
Jenkins: Is that good for you? Or would you rather
play for a more established team?
Hines: Not necessarily, no. The thing about a
young team is that they don't have all the old
heroes that you're trying to live up to. It's like,
whoever is tin the team now , that's who they relate
to. You don't have all the traditional things like
"well twenty years ago we did it this way," things
like that. And I've heard some people say that
teams in the NFL can be like that, real traditionally
oriented to things that went on way back when.
Jenkins: Do you know the head coach of the Sea
hawks (Jack Patera)?
Hines: I've talked with him. 1 met him briefly in
Dallas.
Jenkins: Did you like him?
Hines: Yes. He's a nice guy, and I'm almost posi
tive he played offensive line when he played ball.

To me that's always a plus.
He's done real well with the team. They do
things that 1 think should he done in football, as far
as wide open offense, and not necessarily trick
plays, but setting the defense up to be able to do
things that you might not ordinarily be able to with
a real basic kind of attack. I have a lot of respect for
him, and I look forward to playing with him.
Jenkins: Was there any particular coach that you
would have most liked to play for?
Hines: I met Ray Malavasi from the Rams and I
liked him a lot. But you really don't have that much
contact with the head coach. I met some assistants,
like head offensive line coaches, that I liked. The
Rams had a good one and the Washington guy I
liked a lot.
Jenkins: This was your first year as a starter at
Stanford. How do you account for that? Did you
improve tremendously?
Hines: A lot of different things were going on.
When I first got here I wasn't ready to play. In my
freshman and sophomore year I couldn't really
pass protect — it's a thing of experience. They can
take you if you are inexperienced and not ready to
play and play you if you have some of the basic
skills. You might do pretty well, but it's the experi
ence that really makes a difference. So my first
couple of years, I could have been playing just as
easily as I wasn't playing. It's the coach's decision. I
didn't feel that there were people out there that I
was a lot better than. They were seniors under
coach Christianson and it was a seniority kind of
establishment going where the older guys played.
So I was content to wait my turn, and of course
there were some things I bad to learn to do. So
basically it was a matter of physically maturing and
getting a tougher mental attitude — knowing
what it takes to play and doing it.
| Jenkins: So you always had the potential?
Hines: Mm-hmm. If I hadn't had the poten
tial they wouldn't have given me a scholar
ship.
Jenkins: Has playing pro ball always been an
aspiration of yours?
Hiqes: No it hasn't. When 1 was in high
school I played because my friends played.
And in high school we had a pretty rough
coach, and it wasn't really that fun. It's al
ways fun to play the games, to compete, win
los£ or draw, that was always fun. It's always
a special experience. But sometimes practice
gets tedious, and if the coach is a real discip
linarian in terms of conditioning it's hard
work. At the time 1 wasn't ready to work that
hard. 1 did it, but 1 didn't think I could. But
then I grew bigger and I got more confidence
as far-as dealing with the pressures and the
things that coaches would ask me to do.
Jenkins: So at about what point did you de
cide that football could be a career?
Hines: Well, 1 knew 1 was big enough, and
that's the number one thing. That's the
reason 1 knew 1 would get drafted before
Ch&ck or Turk. If Turk was two inches taller,
1e probably would've gone before 1 did. As
Far as the draft they are always real careful
ibout who they pick. There is certain criteria
khey have and one of the main ones they have
is size.
I came here at 6-6. 250. so everybody
cnew 1 had the size to play any level of foot
>all. I guess it was my sophomore year that
here was a scout there, and I was playing
against Duncan Mcoll. Sometimes Duncan
would just tear me up and sometimes I would
gefmad at him and we'd have a good battle. I
had two or three days where I was kind of
pissed off and we were going hard and ha\ ing
a good practice and I think it was a Raider
scout. He told the defensive line coach that if

I kept working and did well, I could be a great
pro prospect. The guy was really excited.
Jenkins: Are you apprehensive or confident
about going into pro ball?
Hines: I'm both. A lot of people are talking
about how it's such a surprise that 1 was
drafted so high and such a surprise that 1 was
drafted to Seattle, a team that needed mostly
defensive help. But I've done some good
things in football, and against some of the
more highly rated defensive linemen. Scouts
know that. I played in the Pac-10, and they
know that the Pac-10 is one of the biggest
conferences in the nation. 1 played in the
Hula Bowl against All Americans. I wasn't
totally dominant, but they didn't dominate
me either. It was at least equal and in some
situations perhaps 1 did dominate. 1 know
that 1 have the ability to compete with the
best people. In that sense. 1 am confident. 1
know that 1 can go out there and do it.
In terms of apprehension, I don't know
what their approach will be to me personally,
to their style of football and how I will be able
to adapt. Also. I think about the way rela
tionships may develop between the team, the
players, and whoever is in the immediate
Seahawk family. It's basically a tear of the
unknown.
Jenkins: Do you think football in any way
detracted from your education at Stanford.'
Hines: It detracts from your academic educa
tion, unless you are very. \ er> rigorous, as tar
as vour schedule on a day-to-day basis ou
have to know what you are going to do e\ ery
day in order to do well, or else be extremely
bright.
You have practice until noon, you have a
meeting at 3:00, then you're on the field,
you're off the field at 5:00. meals at 5:30.
You're beat, you know? There's no doubt
about it, you're tired. You'd rather go and sit
back and relax. And that's where a person's
character is tested, to see if they can do it.
And the thine about football, it's very

emotionally strenuous to put that much of
yourself physically into what you are doing
and not have good results, not win. You are
beat up physically, and then, if you aren't
starting, or if you're injured a little bit and
that's hindering your play, these little an
xieties just build up and build up and it sits on
your head all the time. There is a whole lot of
mental stress there, and if you're not close to
the game it's hard to understand. I think
personally that that is the biggest challenge
of the game
Jenkins: And then pick up the hooks.
Hines: Exactly. And try to deal with all the
outside things, especially academia at the col
lege level — all the things that are related to
college ball. At Stanford, you have to go to
school. As we've been seeing in the news
papers, at other places they don't go to
school. And I just found that out. They don't.
This is the only place that I know of, besides
maybe Brigham Young, where they make
you go to school. Everybody else, well, if
you're not a star, they make you go to school.
But it you're one of the stars, at almost all
places, especially in the south, where the
whole community is built around the football
team, you don't do nothin'. You just call the
Alumni, call the coach. Literally, almost ev
erything you need, they get it for you. But
you almost need that to play well. They say
athletes are pampered, but you almost have
to be.
Something should be done somewhere,
either make it a little more lax or something.
But 1 think the athletes deserve a little more
than what they get. That's why most places
cheat and give them more. Stanford doesn't
cheat. Stanford has something like 93 or 94
percent graduation class, and I'm telling you,
everybody else has to be 60 or 70. I was
asking guys if they graduated, and nobody
did. You say "hey man. did you graduate?"
and they just start laughing. They don't go to
school. They just play football.
