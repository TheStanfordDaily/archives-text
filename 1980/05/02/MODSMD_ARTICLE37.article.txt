## The
						Friday Interview Andre Hines talks draft 
### 
(Editor's Note: Andre Mines, a senior offensive
tackle, was picked in the second round of the NFL
Draft Tuesday after starting for only one season at
Stanford. In this Friday Interview with Sally Jen
kins, Hines explains his feelings at this profound
juncture in his life.)
Jeifkins: Did you expect to get drafted or did you
intend to he a free agent?
Hines: 1 expected to get drafted, but at the same
time I knew it wasn't going to be my decision.
Everyone 1 talked to in the NFL said \ would be
drafted.
Jenkins: Did you expect to he drafted ahead of Turk
Schonert and Chuck Evans?
Hines: Yes.
Jenkins: How do you feel about Seattle, as a team
and as a town?
Hines: As a team, it's a young team, a real aggres
sive team.
Jenkins: Is that good for you? Or would you rather
play for a more established team?
Hines: Not necessarily, no. The thing about a
young team is that they don't have all the old
heroes that you're trying to live up to. It's like,
whoever is tin the team now , that's who they relate
to. You don't have all the traditional things like
"well twenty years ago we did it this way," things
like that. And I've heard some people say that
teams in the NFL can be like that, real traditionally
oriented to things that went on way back when.
Jenkins: Do you know the head coach of the Sea
hawks (Jack Patera)?
Hines: I've talked with him. 1 met him briefly in
Dallas.
Jenkins: Did you like him?
Hines: Yes. He's a nice guy, and I'm almost posi
tive he played offensive line when he played ball.

To me that's always a plus.
He's done real well with the team. They do
things that 1 think should he done in football, as far
as wide open offense, and not necessarily trick
plays, but setting the defense up to be able to do
things that you might not ordinarily be able to with
a real basic kind of attack. I have a lot of respect for
him, and I look forward to playing with him.
Jenkins: Was there any particular coach that you
would have most liked to play for?
Hines: I met Ray Malavasi from the Rams and I
liked him a lot. But you really don't have that much
contact with the head coach. I met some assistants,
like head offensive line coaches, that I liked. The
Rams had a good one and the Washington guy I
liked a lot.
Jenkins: This was your first year as a starter at
Stanford. How do you account for that? Did you
improve tremendously?
Hines: A lot of different things were going on.
When I first got here I wasn't ready to play. In my
freshman and sophomore year I couldn't really
pass protect â€” it's a thing of experience. They can
take you if you are inexperienced and not ready to
play and play you if you have some of the basic
skills. You might do pretty well, but it's the experi
ence that really makes a difference. So my first
couple of years, I could have been playing just as
easily as I wasn't playing. It's the coach's decision. I
didn't feel that there were people out there that I
was a lot better than. They were seniors under
coach Christianson and it was a seniority kind of
establishment going where the older guys played.
So I was content to wait my turn, and of course
there were some things I bad to learn to do. So
basically it was a matter of physically maturing and
