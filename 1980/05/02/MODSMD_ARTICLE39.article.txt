# Trackmen confront Bears
## 
### Steve Odell Staff Writer 
The Stanford men's track team will conclude
their dual meet season this Saturday when they
square off against the California Bears at Ber
keley's Edwards Stadium, continuing a rivalry
which goes hack to 1893. Stanford boasts a 4-3
record in dual meet competition so far this year.
The Bears hold a 43-40 lead in the S3 meetings
they have had with Stanford, including winning
eight straight and nine of the last 10. Last year, the
Bears inflicted the worst defeat (1 17-37) in series
history.
But there is room for some optimism for coach
Brooks Johnson's Cardinals also, heading into the
meet with the Bears. Last weekend, the Cards
chalked up seven career bests, despite finishing
second in the triangular meet that included Oregon
State and UC-lrvine.
And Johnson stressed that even though Stanford
was nudged by the Beavers, they are not
"down" heading into their final dual meet of the
year against Cal. "Nobody's depressed. The guys
know that they competed well. We were just out
gunned. We won more events than anybody else;
they just had more people and won it by taking a lot
of seconds and thirds.
"Our basic goal and philosophy is to get a com
petitive attitude established — that's our primary
concern. I think this was manifested last week in
the meet, and we hope to carry this into the meet
with Cal. Hie score did not measure our success."
But the Cards first year coach was also realistic
coming into the meet against the Golden Bears.
"Cal is a very fine dual meet team and we know
that. And frankly, we don't have that great of a

dual meet team — yet. We see Cal as kind of a
motivational example for us. They were in the
same position that we are in now pretty much, a few
years back. And now look where they are."
And where Berkeley is now is pretty impressive.
I he Bears are 4-1 thus far in dual meet competi
tion. and are coming off of sound victories over San
Jose State (80-74), USC (84-70) and Washington
State (93-61 ).
Coach Erv Hunt's team must be heavily favored
this week, and looking at their powerful attack, it's
not hard to see why. Their attack includes many
Olympic and NCAA qualifiers, including Mike
White (1:47.1 in the 800), Dave Porath (191-1 in
the discus). Larry Cowling (13.85 and 59.64 in the
hurdles), Paul Bates (25-() 1 and 52-5' A in the
long and triple jumps), and Gary Kelly (46.5 in the
400).
Still Johnson expects good competition. "We
stack up pretty well with them, actually. The 100,
200. 800. and 1500 meters look to be dogfights.
Most ot the other events they have an edge, I think.
Except the hammer."
Ihe 1 00 and 200 meters should indeed be hotly
contested races with Stanford's sprint duo of Dar
rin Nelson (10.3. 21.1 ) and Gordon Banks (10.4.
20.8) matching up against Cal's swift pair of
Eugene Rachal (10.4. 21.0) and Derek Robinson
(10.67. 2 1.0) in both events.
"I think the people here at Stanford are self
mot i\ ated going into a meet against Cal. If we have
the same intensity and desire that we showed last
week. I'll be happv. I he score in this meet is really
a secondary consideration. But we'll put up a good
tight." said Johnson.

Lloyd Bourne, who has had somewhat of an up-and-down year so far, is playing No. 3 now for
the Cards as they wind down their highly successful season. Stanford travels to the desert this
weekend for a couple of Pac-10 match-ups against the Arizona schools.
