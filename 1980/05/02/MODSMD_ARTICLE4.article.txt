# Effect of Iran asset freeze small here
## 
### Sidra Watts Staff Writer 
President Jimmy Carter's Nov. 14.
1979 order to free/e an estimated $N
billion in Iranian government assets
has had a negligible effect on the ability
of the University's 101 Iranian stu
dents to make tuition, room and board
payments, officials here said this week.
Though last year's Iranian Revolu
tion caused some delay in quarterly
payments by students sponsors in Iran,
the University resolved the problems.
Many students here have savings ac
counts on which they are relying to pay
quarterly bills until there is some
change in the volatile Middle East
crisis. Lee Zeigler. director of Bechtel
International Center, said.
He added that the Iranian students
typically are helpful and supportive of
each other financially.
Help each other
' Following the Iranian Revolution,
when the disruption was prolonged, we
were surprised to see how willing they
were to help each other financially
when funds weren't coming through."
Zeigler said.
While payments from most students
have continued as usual, some difficul
ties have arisen since the Iranian Con
sulate General's Office in San Fran
cisco closed recently.
That office was sponsoring two stu
dents here; since its closure, payments
for those students have not been made.
"It's difficult to knov\ just where
their money will come from." /.eigler
said, adding he is seeking assistance
from the U.S. Treasury Department
regarding financial support for the stu
dents
Before Iranian students here were
granted visas, various supporting agen
cies, mostly in Iran, agreed to make
quarterly tuition and room payments
for them, according to John Gardner,
manager of student aid accounting and

accounts receivable. Gardner's office
acts as an agent, hilling each sponsor
for its students when hills come due.
This week, for example, the Univer
sity received an SIN.OOO check from
Isfahan Technical University to pay the
expenses of 22 students it is sponsor
ing.
One student said he fears the finan
cial situation for students here may
worsen if Iranian currency conversion
becomes more difficult.
Another problem which may face
the students is that their visas may not
he renewed next year, forcing them to
return to Iran to complete academic
studies.
Following the April 16 break in dip
lomatic relations with Iran. Carter is
sued directives forbidding visa exten
sions to most Iranian students.
Exceptions to the rule, however,
may enable some students to stay at the
University next year, Zeigler said.
Students in need of immediate medi
cal care or those who have a close rela
tive here who is a U.S. citizen may be
granted extensions.
Students who can prove their free
dom would he seriously jeopardized if
they return to Iran also may apply for
political asylum in the United States. If
granted asylum, these students could
continue their education here.
'Crisis mentality'
"The Iranian students are accus
tomed to a crisis mentality. They don't
panic. The students at Stanford are
very intent on finishing their degrees
and arc serious dedicated students of
high academic quality," Zeigler said.
Mary Clark, assistant director of
administration at Bechtel. has been de
signated to handle diplomatic affairs
for the Iranian students. They have
been referred to the Algerian Embassy
in Washington, D.C., for visa exten
sions, she said.
