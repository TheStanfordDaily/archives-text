### 
The Stanford cycling team
turned out in force last weekend
for the Intercollegiate Champ
ionships hosted by UC Santa
Barbara. Twelve team members
and coach Tim Nicholson made
the seven-hour trip to represent
Stanford in a battle for second
place team standings behind the
super-powered UCSB team.
Going into the two-stage
championship event. Stanford
held third place in season stand
ings, with Foothill College in
second. The team looked for
ward to a strong performance to
round out the intercollegiate
season.
In the expert category the race
was modified to a 40-km team
time trial â€” a TT with four riders
working together. The course
was close to dead flat with not
very much wind, a factor which
can drastically alter the outcome
of the event. The Stanford team
of Bruce Pauly, George Her
mann. Bob Childs, and Christian
Englehardt had been training
hard for several weeks in prep
aration, getting the four riders to
work together most efficiently.
Coordination of both strength
and style is the key to a good
pacing, and Stanford was well
rewarded for their practice,
clocking a 53.45 and an average
of 28 MPH to win with and 1 1
second lead over UCSB's strong
and experienced team.
In the women's race, Stan
ford's Margi Bethke motored to
an excellent 33.45 minute time
over the 20 km course, taking
third palce. The event was won
by Audrey Thornton of UCSD
with an impressive 45 second
lead over second place finisher
Kathy Swords of UCSB. Liz
Newberry placed fifth for Stan

ford, clocking 33.58.
Novice Rich Swent was Stan
ford's top finisher in that event,
also 20 km, taking fourth place
with a time of 3 1.20. Art Sable of
UCSB won the race at 30.22,
while Stuart Rosse finished thir
teenth for Stanford (32.32) and
Kelly Foster, fourteenth (32.34).
Dan Murphy (17th), Eugene
Reardon (18th), and Juan Salas
(21st) also collected points for
Stanford.
The criterium course for Sun
day circled the gym on the edge
of the UCSB campus, the worst
corner handily situated just in
front of the ambulance-fire sta
tion.
The large novice pack set off
first for a 20-lap event. Stuart
Rosse was the top finisher for
Stanford, sprinting to fourth de

spite being forced to leave the
pavement as he tried to pass
another rider. Rosse also nahhed
third place points in one prime
sprint, while Kelly Foster placed
11th overall.
Margi Bethki took sixth place
in the women's race, after doing
a lion's share of the work during
the 15-lap race, and Stanford's
Liz Newberry sprinted to fourth
place behind winner Lynn Kings
land from UCSB.
