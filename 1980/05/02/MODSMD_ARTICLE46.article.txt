# Women netters to challenge UCLA Bruins
## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
Stanford's women's tennis
team goes into its final warmup
before western regionals at
Santa Barbara next weekend
when they host the UCLA
Bruins Saturday at 1:30 p.m. at
the varsity courts.
Stanford coach Frank Bren
nan looks for the match to be the
most competitive women's
match held at Stanford all year as
the Cards have edged the Bruins
by identical 5-4 margins twice

this year.
"I'd be really happy with
another 5-4 win," said Brennan,
"but I'd prefer it if we'd pull
away a little? bit this time.
Brennan hopes that UCLA
will use the same line-up that the
Cards have already faced and
beaten twice.
"I'm hoping they don't change
their line-up. We've beaten that
line-up and I think we can
again."
In their previous matches
against Stanford, the Bruins

have played Kathy O'Brien in
the No. 1 spot followed by Lucy
Gordon and Karin Huebner in
the N0.2 and 3 spots.
All-American Becky Bell has
played fourth, Angela Walker
has played fifth and Liz Stalder
has played sixth.
"Becky Bell, their All-
American, is really tough and
they move her around in their
line-up. I'm hoping they play her
at N0.4 because even though
she's beaten Sue Rasmussen, I
think Sue is capable of beating

her.
"That's really going to be a
key match for us. 1 think it will
make my day if Sue beats her,
because the top three spots in
our line-up have been really
strong for us in our matches
against UCLA, but they have ex
ceptional depth in the lower
matches."
Heading the Stanford attack in
the singles matches will be
sophomore Alycia Moulton fol
lowed by Donna Rubin at two
and Caryn Copeland at three.

Rasmussen will play fourth and
Julia Leighton and Lisa Gordon
will round out the line-up at five
and six.
"Alycia, Donna and CC
(Copeland) have really heen
keys for, us against UCLA.
Donna hasn't heer feelin all
that ..ell lately, hut le's icUing
a little better now, so I'd really
like to see her heat Lucy Gordon
again. She's beaten her twice al
ready in straight sets, but I think
she's capable of beating her by a
little better margin."
In the doubles, Brennan will
stick with Moulton and Rasmus
sen as his number one team fol
lowed by Copeland and Rubin at
No. 2 and Leighton and Gayle
Chan at No. 3.
For UCLA. Bell and O'Brien
will play No. 1, Huebner and
Gordon will play No. 2 and Stal
der and Cindy Campbell will
play three.
With only two more duals re
maining, Brennan is hoping for a
little better match against the
Bruins.
"Again, I'd like to see us win
by a little better margin, but a
wi-n is a win and I'll take it even if
we're down three match points in
the deciding match."
