Correction
In Monday April 27's sports
section it was reported that the
Stanford baseball team defeated
No. 1 Arizona State in three
straight games. In actuality,
Arizona State is currently
ranked No. 3 in the Pacific-10
Southern division.
In the same issue, it was also
stated in headline form that the
Stanford women's soccer team
was defeated in Berkeley. The
team did, in fact lose to Ber
keley, but the match was played
in Chico. The Daily sports de
partment regrets the errors.
