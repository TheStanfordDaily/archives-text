# RESTAURANTS
## A
						wondrous assortment of ice cream awaits the sweet tooth 
### 
I his week we visited several
ice cream stores in the Stanford
area. Two reviewers visited each
establishment and ordered a
chocolate chip ice cream cone
and the specialty sundae of the
house.
Rick's Rather Rich Ice
Cream
Charleston and Middlefield
Palo Alto
Nestled in the Charleston
Shopping Center is a small qual
ity self-run ice cream store. What
Rick's lacks in atmosphere, it
makes up in quality of ice cream.
Serving IS flavors made at the
store. Rick also serves frozen

yogurts, ice freezes, and Ulti
mate cookies.
The chocolate chip cone was
large for 50 cents and the ice
cream is fuller and more dense
than most other places we \is
ited. The lh percent butterfat
made the base rich and creams,
and the whole chocolate chips
provided an interesting contrast
to other chocolate chip ice
cream. The sundae was a good
buy for the money with lots of
everything including whipped
cream.
Our only complaint was that
the hot fudge was. like at many of
the stores, heavy and sugars. All
in all. Rick's ups one of the bet

ter places we visited. Single
cones cost 50 cents and doubles
95 cents.
Bud's Ice Cream
613 El ( amino Real
Redwood City
After visiting Bud's, one
realizes whs this faraway place is
so popular with Stanford stu
dents. Ice cream cones are the
main product of Bud's with 35
flavors of ice cream (made on
location) from which to choose.
Frozen yogurt and sherbets are
also served. The prices are
slightly higher than most places.

but the scoops are generally
larger. Bud's was undoubtedly
the most clean and well kept
store that we visited.
I'he chocolate chip cone was
smooth and creamy with 16 per
cent butterfat and lots of air
whipped into the stock. The ice
cream held many"small bit
tersweet chocolate chips. The
banana hot fudge sundae was full
of ice cream and sugary, heavy
hot fudge. However the bananas
and tresh almonds took awav
some of the strength of the hot
fudge and made it one of the best
sundaes we tasted. Single cones
cost 60 cents, doubles $ l. 15 and

a sundae was $1.50.
Old Uncle Gay lord's Old
Fashioned Ice Cream Par
lour
636 Kmerson
Palo Alto
With coffee house fare such as
expresso. cappuccino, hot apple
cider, and fresh pastry items in
addition to ice cream. Old Uncle
Gay lord's proved to be much
more than the usual ice cream
parlour. This was the only place
we visited that had plenty of seat
ing for customers, and novelties
like a piano, customer stereo sys
tem. checkers, and live musical
" entertainment on Friday and
Saturday nights.
All Old Uncle Gaylord's ice
cream is made in San Francisco
the old-fashioned way — in rock
jSalt type ice cream makers.
Although the portions seemed
small in comparison to the other
places we visited, the ice cream is
very dense and possesses all the
qualities of home-made ice
cream. The chocolate chip cone
we tried had a very strong taste
and a pleasant, lingering after
taste.
The two specialty flavors we
tried — chocolate bisque and
lotus cream — were especially
tasty and intriguing. The lotus
cream tasted very much like
lemon meringue laced with al

mond slices. The home-made
characteristics of the ice cream
were really brought out in the
hot fudge sundae which came
complete with whipped cream
and chopped walnuts. Prices ran
60 cents for a single. $1.15 for
doubles, and $1.65 for the sun
dae.
Shaw's Ice Cream and
Candy Store
9X9 El Camino Real
Menlo Park.
Besides serving ice cream.
Shaw's has an assortment of
candy, sandwiches, and toys,
which provide an interesting at
mosphere. Prices were a little
high, but we received a tremend
ous amount of ice cream for one
scoop. There are many diverse
and interesting flavors of both
ice cream and yogurt.
Hie chocolate chip cone was
very heavy and dense, reminding
us of homemade ice cream. The
picturesque hot fudge sundae
contained a lot of hot fudge and
whipped cream with fresh al
monds on top. As at several
places, the hot tudge was very
sugary. Overall, Shaw's gives a
healthy amount of diverse var
ieties of ice cream at a close dis
tance from campus. Cones are 65
cents for a single, $1.25 for a
double with 5 cents added on for
a sugar cone. Sundaes are
$2.15.

Sally's Ice Creamery
442 California Ave.
Palo Alto
Being the closest to campus of
the places we visited, Sally's is an
ideal place for those interested in
taking a quick trip off-campus
for an ice cream study break. All
of Sally's 36 flavors are made
fresh daily at their sister store in
Santa Clara and only fresh fruit is
used in the fruit flavors.
The chocolate chip cone we
tried was very creamy and
smooth with plenty of chocolate
chips for a full chocolate accent.
The generous, heaping scoops
are enough to put a smile on
anyone's face. Singles are 60
cents and doubles are $1.10 with
an extra 5 cents charged for
sugar cones.
One of the most popular sun
daes is Sally's Invitational: a very
filling and tasty hot fudge sundae
lined with fresh slices of banana
and topped with whipped cream
and fresh walnuts. We found the
hot chocolate sauce to be very
thick. The price for this sundae is
$ 1.80.
Sally's also serves sodas.
