# Committee to decide by summer
## Med Center approaches end of search for new director 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
The Stanford Medical Center, with
out a permanent director for 16
months, will have selected a new head
by the start of summer, the chairman of
the search committee for a new direc
tor said yesterday.
Though the committee has yet to in
terview about four more candidates for
the position, eight already have been
interviewed and two more will visit the
campus this month, said Thomas Meri
gan. committee chairman and profes
sor of infectious diseases here.
Acting Director Dr. Lawrence
Crowley told the University last month
that he will resign from the interim pos
ition on Aug. 31, even if a permanent
Med Center head has not been

selected. In his resignation letter to
President Richard Lyman, Crowley,
also a surgery professor, stated he
wants to be considered for the post.
l"he search committee, composed of
Medical School professors, a local sur
geon, a psychology professor and two
medical students, has been meeting
every two weeks for about a year in an
effort to find a new head to run the
center. Merigan said.
As the Med Center combines a
community and a university hospital,
its new head must be able to allocate
resources efficiently between the two
branches, he added.
He added the committee is looking
for someone who is a strong leader in
bio-medical policy development. Can
didates interviewed either have been

strong in management skill areas or
have been more qualified in the bio
medical aspects of hospital direction.
The successful permanent head must
have a combination of these qualities.
Merigan said.
The search, which has lasted for
more than a year, was not expected to
take as long as it has. according to
Merigan, but has been slowed by sev
eral factors.
A Jan. 12, 1979 article in Science
magazine painted a gloomy picture of
the Med Center's future that may have
discouraged potential candidates. In
particular, it stated that the center
would face potentially severe financial
problems.
"Tliis article put thoughts in people's
(candidates') minds and gave them a

negative preconception about the job,"
Merigan said.
However, more recently, candidates
seem to have been impressed by the
stabilization and improvement in con
ditions at the Center, he added.
Said Joshua Prager, committee
member and fourth-year medical stu
dent here, "The management prob
lems at the Med Center are no greater
than at any other similar center."
Another factor frustrating the quest
for a new head is that because most

candidates hold positions at other in
stitutions throughout the country,
scheduling interview appointments
with them has taken a lot of time.
A change in the definition of the pos
ition also has slowed the process. Meri
gan said. The new head will be titled
the vice-president lor medical affairs
and will serve over a dean of the medi
cal school and a director of the hospital,
he said.
When the change was made, .the
committee was forced to re-educate

candidates on the type of person for
which it was searching, Merigan said.
This also was time-consuming.
In an interview with the Daily three
weeks ago. University Provost Donald
Kennedy said the process has been
slowed hy uncertainty over who will
take the University presidential reigns
when Lyman leaves late this summer.
Apparently, some candidates have
■ been unwilling to commit themselves
because of the uncertainty over who
will succeed Lyman, Kennedy said.
