Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the
movie that combines big-time stars
(Malcolm McDowell, Peter
O'Toole) with hard-core sex (you
name it). Unfortunately, these two
groups are mutually exclusive and
the audience never learns if
O'Toole is truly deserving of his
surname. This overly violent movie
purports to tell a story of ancient
Rome, but is really about the calcu
lations of buck-hungry magazine
publishers attempting one of his
tory's greatest tie-ins: a moving,
grunting Penthouse. 11 you want
ancient Rome, watch Ben Hur on
TV. If you want porn, take Caligu
la's $6.00 admission tag and see 24
quarter peep shows. As entertain
ment, Caligula doesn't deliver, and
as art, it is vile.

The War at Home it it it it
Surf Theater, San Francisco
The Vietnam anti-war move
ment's answer to John Wayne and
Joe. You can see this documentary
on unrest at the University of Wis
consin and wallow in nostalgia and
then come home and put on the
Youngbloods or Jefferson
Airplane and wallow some more,
and think about why things have
changed and how they can change
back. Perfect for the '60s freak.
— Seth Zuckerman
The Furyitif
Mountain View Theatre
An empty style piece. Director
Brian DePalma is a visual genius;
he achieves great sequences but he
never gets any tension building in
this mess about a telekinetic boy
and girl. The script is terrible and
the characterization is worse — but
DePalma doesn't seem to care. Yet
the movie's too nonsensical for
great horror and too serious for sa
tire. That's too bad. because the
climax»nas all the elements of clas
sic parody: John Cassavetes liter
ally gets blown up; we see his body
explode from six different camera
angles and at varying speeds. The
scene must be the ultimate in camp
horror. Perhaps Stanley Kubrick,
with his upcoming The Shining, will
make the stylized horror farce that
DePalma seems to hint at here.
— Ron Lillejord
The Rose ★
Mountain View Theatre
Really just another version of A
Star is Born, except that this one is
clothed with a 1969 setting and
cen on a character vaguely
bastu i Janis Joplin. But the
movie only makes three references
to '69, and without those you'd
probably just assume the movie
was set in the present. And the
music is more aptly described as
frenetic show tunes with bass and

drums than as Jams Joplin's form of
blues and rock. The performances
at times manage to obscure some of
the movie's lack of authenticity,
but the much-ballyhooed Bette
Midler only exacerbates the prob
lem by being less than convincing in
the concert sequences. When
teamed with either Frederic For
rest or Alan Bates, Midler comes
off much better, but it's too little
too late.

Electric Horseman itirit
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
- R.L.
Chapter Two ★★
Park, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle
aged widower boy (James Caan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate. there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody sell. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.

All That Jazz ★★★
Old Mill
Bob Fosse thir'y \ oiled exami
nation of his own lite and death is
the kind of self-induigcnt mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; t rust ratinuly. the movie
fluctuates wildly it's often selt
conscious. but it's olten dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.

I osse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe (ii
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. Vou olten teel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film
Scheider successfully captures a
man who's alwaysoH. a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and liis greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but lie's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
Flic often extraordinary musical
sequences typify I// That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-bi/ sclimalt-

/iness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
lit theirown; he must have realized

Breaking Ahoy ★★★
Old Mill
A low-budget, likeable movie
with few pretentions — Breaking
A way may be the most good
natured film of the past summer.
Peter (Bullitt) Yates directed this
story about a small-town boy who
seeks to make his escape through
his talent on a bicycle. «,

Harold and Maude ★★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
Harold is a young man whose
hobbies are attending funerals and
committing suicide. Maude is an
old woman who believes in free
love and in the inherent goodness
of humanity. It's clear from the be
ginning that the two are destined to
fall in love. Hal Ashhy (Shampoo,
Coming Home) directed this in
vigorating cult comedy. The two
principals are played by Bud Cort
and Ruth Gordon. Songs by Cat
Stevens round out the soundtrack.
Jim Mattson

Hair
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest. Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy \ ision of America, but even in
those terms. Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.
— R.L

10 ★★★
Century 21, San Jose
The sexist ad campaign has mis
led many people to this movie; if
you're looking for a semi
pornographic turn-on, 10 may not
be right for you. Writer-director
Blake Edwards' values are, for lack
of a better word, straight, and this
comedy about male mid-life crisis
probably won't please those who
enjoy watching females get con
quered As an over-40 songwriter.
Dudley Moore is an ingratiating
bumbler, and Fdwards gives the
rest of the cast more than enough
depth to get by. Except for Bo De
rek. that is. This poster-star just

may have found her "niche" as the
vacuous "10" the title refers to.
— R.L.
Kramer vs. krumerititir '/j
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
I loffman and a youngster ol almost
I Tightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart.
Benton constructs a mov ing, com
passionate. almost I ruffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and v ice versa).

Hut there's ;i gnawing (tor me at
least) Haw in the treatment of the
custody ease at the end ot the film.
After all the care and honesty Hen
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the diee
against the female character
( Meryl Streep)'.' I ler case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on. Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat lor its own good.
Streep's cxtiaordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencics in how her character is
written.
Vet in the main. Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

1941
Century 21, San Jose
Although it's a decided regres
sion for Steven Spielberg, 1941 is
still a bravura directing perfor
mance. The script offers no real
suspense and scarcely any dramatic
tension, but as a loving expression
of visual comedy, 1941 is the
strongest effort in years, f.ike a
Stennett or Lloyd two-reeler, 1941
is all up front — bodies fly all too
frequently and the comedy is gen
erally not of the lasting variety.
That may partialb' explain the very
harsh reaction ot most critics to this
movie; also, such completely phys
ical, frenzied comedic action may
be horribly out of place now.
Despite all that, I like this movie.
There isn't a physical comedian
working today better than John Be
lushi, and Dan Aykroyd.Treat Wil
liams, Toshiro Mifune and Slim
Pickens are all fine here. But
Robert Stack, as General "Vinegar
Joe" Stilwell, quietly steals the
show as he tearfully watches Dis
ney's Dumbo as a full-scale riot
goes on outside the theater

Being There
Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be
ing, in this comedy directed by Hal
Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife who is desperately seeking for
affection) but the film drags on as
we see more and more people be
taken in by Chance's one quality:
his ability to make people see in
him whatever they want — as
Chance rises by accident and in
spite of himself comes to the brink

of becoming the president of t.ic ,
U.S. ;
Ihe film is a cut against corrup-
tion in politics, the generation ;
mesmerised by television and ;
empty inctapliois about the sea- A

The Spy Who Loved Me ★★★
Sunday, Mem And 7 & 9:30
Even Roger Moore — the low
rent version of James Bond — can't
do much damage to this dazzling 4
007 thriller. Hie special effects and !
stunts are superb (indeed, after the
first stunt, everything that follows <
is almost anticlimactic.) The
Moore-Barbara Bach pairing work
quite well: Bach is easily Moore's
equal, and she adds some tension
and humor to the formulaic brew.
With Richard Kiel as "Jaws," a
character I hope will go away.

Not among the best of Shakes-

boisterous and dazzling movie ver- j
sion. In 1 I M4. this movie gave a lift I
to war-weary England, now. you j
