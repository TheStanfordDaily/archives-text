Muskie to review 'global picture*
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter will
meet with Secretary of State-designate Edmund
Muskie and other national security advisers at Camp
Dav id this weekend for a wide-ranging review of
foreign policy in the wake of the aborted hostage
rescue operation in Iran.
Muskie. democratic senator from Maine, was
nominated by Carter on Tuesday to succeed Cyrus
Nance, who resigned as secretary of state over the
tailed rescue attempt.
In announcing the meeting. White House press
secretary Jody Powell said yesterday that Carter.
Muskie and Acting Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher will go to the Maryland presidential retreat
today. They will be joined Saturday by Defense Sec
retary Harold Brown, national security affairs adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski and other officials.
Although Powell said the Camp Dav id session will
provide an "opportunity for them to review the
global picture." administration sources said much of
the time probably will be devoted to discussion of

possible new steps for resolving the Iran crisis.
Meanwhile, the House and Senate voted yesterday
to cut the pay ot the secretary of state so Muskie can
take the job Hie legislation was sent to Carter.
The problem is that during Muskie's current term
in the Senate, which began in January 197 7, the
salary of the secretary of state was increased from
$63,000 to $69,000.
llie Constitution prohibits any member of Con
gress from takinga position in the executive branch it
the salary for that job has been increased during the
member's term.
Hie Justice Department lias said, however, that
Congress can get around this by reducing the salary to
its previous level.
the bill, passed by voice vote in both chambers,
would cut the secretary of state's pay back to
$63,000 A senator receives $60,6r>2.
U.S. inay help Japan with oil
WASHINGTON President Jimmy Carter told
Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira yesterday that the
I nited States would help Japan secure oil supplies, it
necessary, in gratitude for its refusal to buy high
priced oil from Iran
The offer to help Japan deal with the cutoff of
Iranian oil. which amounted to 10 percent of the
nation's imports, highlighted a harmonious exchange
of pledges of mutual support between the two lead
ers.
Carter, however, did. make two new requests of
Ohira: he asked Japan to speed up implementation of
a t iv e-year military buildup, and also asked for help in
forestalling potential political troubles caused by im
port*. of Japanese cars into this country.
In a public statement before the two leaders signed
an agreement on science and technology coopera
tion, Carter praised Japan's support of his poll' -s
toward the Iranian cv is and the Soviet invasion v r
Afghanistan.
Earlier, luring a working luncheon. Carter specifi
cally praise*' Ohira f->r Japan's decision to reject an
Iranian demand for a $2.50-per-barrel price increase
for oil. According to a senior U.S. official present at
the luncheon, Carter said that if Japan's cooperation
in not buying oil at higher prices "created special
problems for Japan, the United States was prepared
to be helpful."
Ohira told Carter that Japan did not need help at
the moment and that it was seeking to expand its
supplies of oil from other sources, including Mexico.
Ohira is to meet with Mexican President Jose Lopez
Portillo today and tomorrow.

Carter says inflation will ease
W \SHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter said'
y csterday the nation has turned the corner" on infla
tion. but two former top economists in Republican
and Democratic administrations said the economy is
falling into a tar deeper and longer recession than
Car' r predicts.
"is gong to be a horrible one (recession)." said
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers in the Ford administration. "It's
going to be terribly costly. It's going to throw a lot of
people out of work."
Barry Bosworth. Carter's former director of the
Council on Wr.ge and Price Stability, said the
economy is deteriorating "in a very steady and ex
treme fashion." and predicted the recession would
last into 198 1.
Carter, meanwhile, told a group of accountants at
the White House that "we do believe we've turned
the corner" in fighting inflation, and he repeated an
earlier prediction that the inflation rate "will drop
significantly during the summer."
Greenspan and Bosworth, speaking at a public
forum on inflation, concurred with Cartel's predic
tion that inflation would fall from a current annual
rate of 1- pen. in to about 10 percent or even less
during these >nd half of 1980.
But the two economists departed sharply from Car

Muskie to review 'global picture*
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter will
meet with Secretary of State-designate Edmund
Muskie and other national security advisers at Camp
Dav id this weekend for a wide-ranging review of
foreign policy in the wake of the aborted hostage
rescue operation in Iran.
Muskie. democratic senator from Maine, was
nominated by Carter on Tuesday to succeed Cyrus
Nance, who resigned as secretary of state over the
tailed rescue attempt.
In announcing the meeting. White House press
secretary Jody Powell said yesterday that Carter.
Muskie and Acting Secretary of State Warren Christ
opher will go to the Maryland presidential retreat
today. They will be joined Saturday by Defense Sec
retary Harold Brown, national security affairs adviser
Zbigniew Brzezinski and other officials.
Although Powell said the Camp Dav id session will
provide an "opportunity for them to review the
global picture." administration sources said much of
the time probably will be devoted to discussion of

possible new steps for resolving the Iran crisis.
Meanwhile, the House and Senate voted yesterday
to cut the pay ot the secretary of state so Muskie can
take the job Hie legislation was sent to Carter.
The problem is that during Muskie's current term
in the Senate, which began in January 197 7, the
salary of the secretary of state was increased from
$63,000 to $69,000.
llie Constitution prohibits any member of Con
gress from takinga position in the executive branch it
the salary for that job has been increased during the
member's term.
Hie Justice Department lias said, however, that
Congress can get around this by reducing the salary to
its previous level.
the bill, passed by voice vote in both chambers,
would cut the secretary of state's pay back to
$63,000 A senator receives $60,6r>2.
U.S. inay help Japan with oil
WASHINGTON President Jimmy Carter told
Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira yesterday that the
I nited States would help Japan secure oil supplies, it
necessary, in gratitude for its refusal to buy high
priced oil from Iran
The offer to help Japan deal with the cutoff of
Iranian oil. which amounted to 10 percent of the
nation's imports, highlighted a harmonious exchange
of pledges of mutual support between the two lead
ers.
Carter, however, did. make two new requests of
Ohira: he asked Japan to speed up implementation of
a t iv e-year military buildup, and also asked for help in
forestalling potential political troubles caused by im
port*. of Japanese cars into this country.
In a public statement before the two leaders signed
an agreement on science and technology coopera
tion, Carter praised Japan's support of his poll' -s
toward the Iranian cv is and the Soviet invasion v r
Afghanistan.
Earlier, luring a working luncheon. Carter specifi
cally praise*' Ohira f->r Japan's decision to reject an
Iranian demand for a $2.50-per-barrel price increase
for oil. According to a senior U.S. official present at
the luncheon, Carter said that if Japan's cooperation
in not buying oil at higher prices "created special
problems for Japan, the United States was prepared
to be helpful."
Ohira told Carter that Japan did not need help at
the moment and that it was seeking to expand its
supplies of oil from other sources, including Mexico.
Ohira is to meet with Mexican President Jose Lopez
Portillo today and tomorrow.
