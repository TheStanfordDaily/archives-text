# Committee on Investment Responsibility makes recommendations in proxy votes
## 
### 
If U.S. Steel Corp. does not comply
with the Sullivan employment princi
ples hy the end of 198 I, it should with
draw from its South African affiliates, a
trustee committee here said this week.
The Sullivan principles are a guide
mandating the end of segregation and
promotion of fair employment prac
tices at plants and facilities of com
panies doing business in South Africa.
In a series of proxy votes Wednes
day, the Stanford Trustee Special
Committee on Investment Responsi
bility (SCIR). also took these actions:
— Urged Coca-Cola Co. to sign the
Sullivan principles and require all sub
sidiaries and future franchises to ob
serve basic human rights by Sep
tember, a change that refers particu
larly to Coca-Cola Guatemala botters.
— Voted against demands that
Eastman Kodak Co. withdraw from

South Africa.
In its decision, committee members
said they believed the company has
made exceptional progress in programs
for social betterment and affirmative
action there.
— Opposed expansion by Exxon
Corp. in South Africa for the second
consecutive year.
— Opposed expansion of Mobil Oil
Corp. in South Africa and said the
company and its subsidiaries should
not sell products or provide services to
the South African police or military.
Each of these actions had been re
commended by the Commission on In
vestment Responsibility, an advisory
group to SCIR composed of students,
faculty, alumni and staff.
The University owns 122,700 shares
of U.S. Steel; 200 of Coca-Cola;
78,151 of Kodak; 44,384 of Exxon and

3600 of Mobil.
In other action Wednesday, the trus
tee committee reversed two of the
ClR's recommendations. Following
extended discussion, the trustee com
mittee voted against a shareholder re
solution asking Atlantic Richfield
Corp. (ARCO) not to expand in Chile
until the government there reinstates
constitutional and democratic rule.
According to Rod Adams, director
of finance, the trustees said they
wanted further discussion with the CIR
on the advisory group's apparent belief
that an American corporation's pre
sence usually signals support for rep
ressive governments. While this may be
true in some instances, it may not be so
in others, Adams said.
When CIR made its recommenda
tions. five commission members sun
ported the shareholder proposal, while
four believed the University should
abstain on the issue. Hie University
holds 15,300 shares of ARCO stock.
Standard Oil Corp.
I'he trustee committee also voted
down a shareholder resolution calling
on Standard Oil Corp to report on its
holdings in the federally irrigated
Westlands Water District in California.
11 ustees told Adams they did not be
-1 icv e the proposal was well thought out.
The University holds 2200 shares in
the company.

The only other disagreement bet
ween the trustees and the CI R came on
a Dow Chemical proxy calling for a
pesticide rev iew committee and ban on
herbicides produced for export until
the company committee's report is
published. Five commission members
favored this proposal, which two be
lieved the University should abstain.
The trustees, in turn, abstained.
Adams said the trustees felt that
either favoring or opposing the prop
osal would be premature during the
current Environmental Protection
Agency investigation at Dow.
