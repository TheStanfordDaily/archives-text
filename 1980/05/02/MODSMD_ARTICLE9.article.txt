## West Bank tensions escalate Palestinian youth shot at rally 
### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
NABLUS, Occupied West
Bank — Tensions in the West
Bank rose sharply yesterday
when a Palestinian student was
shot to death after allegedly at
tacking a high-ranking Israeli
military governor with a knife
during a demonstration in the
Arab village of Anabta, near
here.
Israeli military authorities said
the youth, masked and carrvi ng 4
Palestinian flag, was slain while
scuffling with an army captain
who had gone to the village with
Lt. Col. Mutsafi Shalom, the
military governor of the Tulkarm
district, to investigate students
throwing rocks at passing Israeli
vehicles.
Officials said three youths
hurled rocks at Shalom and his
aide. Capt. Amit Zaid. and that
the governor chased and over
powered two of them. Mean
while. authorities said, Zaid
struggled with the third youth,
identified as Najah Ammed Abu

Ali Ghouli, 17. and the officer's
weapon discharged once.
Escalation of violence
While Israeli soldiers are often
the targets of surreptitious at
tacks by West Bank youths, such
as hit-and-run rock-throwing,
the alleged knife attack illus
trated the escalation of violence
in the occupied territory in re
cent weeks. Hand grenades and
Molotov cocktails have been
thrown at passing military vehi
cles, and troops have been in
creasingly opening fire over the
heads of demonstrators.
Some Palestinian leaders have
warned that the West Bank is on
the brink of open revolt against
occupation, but army Brig. Gen.
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. while
acknowledging an upsurge in
nationalism, said the situation is
far from reaching widespread in
surrection.
'"The military government .. .
will under no circumstances
allow this area to be transformed
into the wild west. We shall re
spond with violence to manifes

tations of violence, and we will
not allow the process of radicali
zation and escalation in the areas
to continue to gain strength."
Ben-Eliezer said.
Conflicting accounts
As usual, there were conflict
ingaccounts of what happened in
the Anabta schoolyard, about 12
miles west of here. Military au
thorities said the Tulkarm gov
ernor and his aide were sum
moned by a school official, who
complained students were ston
ing vehicles on the Nablus-to-
Tulkarm road.
Officials said they had 110 exp
lanation of why Shalom and Zaid
went alone, unescorted by
troops, as normally is the case.
One army officer said Anabta
had been relatively quiet in
terms of anti-Israel demonstra
tions. and the two may have felt
no need for an escort.
Officials said when the youths
attacked, the officers first shot
their weapons in the air and then
chased them. Zaid. they said,
was struck on the head several

times with a brick before his
weapon went off.
Palestinians deny assault
Palestinian sources denied the
officers had been assaulted and
said Zaid and Shalom "broke
into" the schoolyard to break up
a student strike. They said the
two students with Ghouli were
beaten up and hospitalized.
Anabta was shut down by a
general strike following the inci
dent, and the majors of all the
towns in the northern half of the
West Bank planned a meeting to
discuss actions to be taken.
Following the incident, the
army set up numerous
roadblocks and searched vehi
cles for weapons.
On Monday, hundreds of
Arab residents of Ramallah de
monstrated after ultranationalist
Jewish settlers went to the
municipal building to demand
the* * Arabs leave the West Bank.
In a clash with troops, one youth
was shot in the leg. and several
others were hospitalized with in
juries.

Molotov cocktails have been
thrown at passing military vehi
cles, and troops have been in
creasingly opening fire over the
heads of demonstrators.
Some Palestinian leaders have
warned that the West Bank is on
the brink of open revolt against
occupation, but army Brig. Gen.
Binyamin Ben-Eliezer. while
acknowledging an upsurge in
nationalism, said the situation is
far from reaching widespread in
surrection.
'"The military government .. .
will under no circumstances
allow this area to be transformed
into the wild west. We shall re
spond with violence to manifes

tations of violence, and we will
not allow the process of radicali
zation and escalation in the areas
to continue to gain strength."
Ben-Eliezer said.
Conflicting accounts
As usual, there were conflict
ingaccounts of what happened in
the Anabta schoolyard, about 12
miles west of here. Military au
thorities said the Tulkarm gov
ernor and his aide were sum
moned by a school official, who
complained students were ston
ing vehicles on the Nablus-to-
Tulkarm road.
Officials said they had 110 exp
lanation of why Shalom and Zaid
went alone, unescorted by
troops, as normally is the case.
One army officer said Anabta
had been relatively quiet in
terms of anti-Israel demonstra
tions. and the two may have felt
no need for an escort.
Officials said when the youths
attacked, the officers first shot
their weapons in the air and then
chased them. Zaid. they said,
was struck on the head several

times with a brick before his
weapon went off.
Palestinians deny assault
Palestinian sources denied the
officers had been assaulted and
said Zaid and Shalom "broke
into" the schoolyard to break up
a student strike. They said the
two students with Ghouli were
beaten up and hospitalized.
Anabta was shut down by a
general strike following the inci
dent, and the majors of all the
towns in the northern half of the
West Bank planned a meeting to
discuss actions to be taken.
Following the incident, the
army set up numerous
roadblocks and searched vehi
cles for weapons.
On Monday, hundreds of
Arab residents of Ramallah de
monstrated after ultranationalist
Jewish settlers went to the
municipal building to demand
the* * Arabs leave the West Bank.
In a clash with troops, one youth
was shot in the leg. and several
others were hospitalized with in
juries.
