Superman was talking to a friend
Superman I was cruising over a beach one
day when I noticed Wonderwoman lying
on her back, completely naked, making
very strange body motions Wanting to
investigate this a little more closely I flew
down about a 1000 teet and, sure enough,
it was Wonderwoman in the nude and sne
was still making the strange body mo
tions Seeing all this I got very excited and
I finally coulan t control myself, I tore off
my cape, flew down and landed besided
her
Friend What did Wonderwoman say when she
saw you
Superman Oh, nothing, but you should have
seen the look on the invisible man s face!
