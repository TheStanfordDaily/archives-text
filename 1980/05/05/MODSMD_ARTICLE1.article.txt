# Two-alarm blaze damages offices near Med Center
## 
### Andrea James News Editor 
Dental and psychiatry offices were badly damaged yes
terday when a two-alarm fire struck the Welch Road Pro
fessional Center near the Medical Center.
Most of the first- and second-story offices in one wing of
the privately owned building suffered some structural dam
age, and there was extensive damage to equipment in those
offices.
Firefighters said the 2 p.m. blaze was apparently caused
by a smoldering piece of lumber lying in the basement near
electrical and heating equipment. Flames then spread up
through the building.
No rooms were gutted, but equipment in the offices "was
completely ruined," said Fire Inspector Robert Cleveland
of the Palo Alto Fire Department. Five trucks from Palo
Alto responded to the call. Another unit from Menlo Park
was dispatched by was never used.
Investigators first believed the fire was caused when a tar
roofing truck, left unattended next to the building, sprung a

leak in its propane tank. They thought the liquid had spilled
through a building ventilator and pooled next to the fur
nace, causing a small explosion.
But Deputy County Fire Marshall Peter Irish said last
night that when firefighters were finally able to get into the
basement they fould that charring had occurred over a
relatively long period.
"It was not likely that it could have taken placc sub
sequent to the time the liquid propane was ignited," Irish
said.
He said there is not a "clear indication of arson," but
added he is not yet ruling out that possibility.
Cleveland estimated structural damage at $15,000.
Equipment loss was roughly estimated to be $30,000 to
$40,000.
The damaged dental offices were used by Dr. Donald
Ostrus, Dr. James Starr. Dr. James Laughlin, Dr. Gary
Eggers and Dr. Thomas Booth.
The psychiatry office was used by Dr. Fowler Biggs.


Firefighters battled a blaze yesterday at a professional
more than $45,000.
