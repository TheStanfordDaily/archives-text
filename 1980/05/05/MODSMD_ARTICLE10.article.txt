KINSHASA, Zaire â€” Nine persons were tram
pled to death, among them a 2-year-old boy and a
12-year-old girl, in an early morning rush to see
Pope John Paul II yesterday.
Attendants at Mama Yemo Hospital here said
that another 72 persons were injured, some criti
cally.
The tragedy apparently was not known by the
pope as he moved into his third day of a 10-day
African trip with an ordination mass for eight new
African bishops and a firm appeal to them to speak
out against corruption and injustice.
Sister Gertrude Koseck, a Polish nun who has
worked here since 1939 and who was looking for
ward to a scheduled reunion with the pope and the
Polish community here, gave a description of the
incident from her bed at N'Galiema Hospital,
where she was being treated for serious bruises and
possible internal injuries.
"I arrived at the gate at the People's Palace at
5:15 because they said the gates would open at
5:30. but there already was a huge crowd," she
said.
"I was right at the gate when they finally opened
it at 6 o'clock. I was knocked down, another person
on top of me and a third person above, but the
crowd kept coming, climbing over us. 1 lost con
sciousness."
Doctors at the hospital said that all nine of the
fatalities were dead on arrival.
They were part of a crowd that finally totalled a

half million people that had come to see the out
door ordination mass, which was the major public
event of the pope's program.
The pope arrived at the gate two hours after the
panic and there were no signs that anything had
occurred out of the ordinary. The pope gave no
indication as the day progressed that he was aware
of what had happened, but a member of the papal
party later said that the pope had been informed of
the incident in the late afternoon, only after offi
cials had confirmed the casualties.
In his homily at the ordination, he urged the new
bishops to speak out against corruption and injus
tice.
That instruction inspired a cheers from those
who had gatheres for the ordination mass / cheers
that may have created some tension later in the day
when the pope met privately with Zaire President
Mobutu Sese Seko, whose government has been
frequently accused of corruption.
The pope saw the ordinations as a "particularly
eloquent sign of the maturity and of the autonomy
of these churches."
Seven of the new bishops are blacks and will
serve in Zaire, Sudan and Burundi. The eighth is 3
French-Canadian who will serve in Djibouti.
The pope returned to the scene of the morning
trampling later in the day for a meeting with uni
versity students and professors, but he made no
reference to the incident and appeared in high
spirits.
The pope will visit a second African nation to
day, the People's Republic of the Congo.
