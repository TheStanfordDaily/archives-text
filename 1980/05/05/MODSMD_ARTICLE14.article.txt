# Israelis criticize U.S. raid into Iran
## 
### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
JERUSALEM — The United
States made basic blunders in its
aborted raid into Iran, according
to Israeli military experts, who
claim to have more experience
than anyone in the world in clan
destine operations. Among the
mistakes:
— U.S. forces failed to main
tain radio silence, which gave
away details of the operation
while it was "-till in progress.
— The United States did not
provide contingency planning
tor events that would go wrong
— "something goes wrong every
mission," an Israeli expert said
— so when three helicopters
tailed no replacements were av
ailable.
Once committed to the opera
tion, the United States backed
out of it "Once we got into an
operation." an Israeli said, spac
ing the words for emphasis, "we
cannot fail. It las to go on."
After ihe political decision
was made, Israeli military plan
ners devised the strike into En
tebbe in 48 hours. An Israeli who
was in on the Entebbe planning
said Thursday, shaking his head:
"Six months. Can you imagine
what you could Jo in six months?
In that time, you could find a
house a mile from the embassy,
bring the compressors piece by
piece, and tunnel your way into
the compound '
Two things especially
bothered Israeli tacticians about
the American operation: The
reported plan to stay overnight
before striking. and the hasty
withdrawal leaving bodies.

documents and helicopters at the
landing area.
'Having it drawn out over two
nights, this is incredible," said
one expert. "It is non
professional. The basis of every
clandestine operation is to move
swiftly, and >trike by surprise."
I he Israeli military considers
bringing out a dead Israeli al
most as serious as evacuating a
wounded man When Israelis say
of the Americans, "they left be
hind their dead," it is with a sad
ness close to despair.

'Six months? In that time you could
find a house a mile from the embassy,
bring in the compressors piece by piece,
and tunnel your way into the
compound!

Israelis take no pleasure in the
U.S. failure, even though they
are rankled by the fact that the
United States did not ask for as
sistance trom Israel in planning
its mission. Israel treed more
than 100 hostages at Entebbe,
and has carried out scored of sec
ret operations, including the de
struction of Arab airliners at
Beirut airport in 1968 and the
ihett of an entire radar station
trom an Egyptian island in the
Gult of Suez in 1969.
The Americans could have
come to us, and asked, "It Iran
hyd 50 Israeli hostages, how
would you get them out?" said

one Israeli expert. "We could
have shared our experience."
How would the Israelis have
done it? The week before the
American attempt, Maj. Gen.
Dan Shomron, who directed the
1976 Entebbe raid, outlined to
an Israeli editor how the Tehran
hostages might be freed:
Iran's state of near-chaos
would simplify a military move
to free the hostages. A rescue
team could move among the var
ious armed Iranian groups with
out causing alarm. "Blending
with the general situation," they

could, he said, "find openings for
action."
Information from Tehran in
dicates that the American force
had Iranian insignias to apply to
U.S. helicopters, and that Ira
nians were among the U.S. raid
ers — suggesting that the U.S.
plan may have included some of
the ideas mentioned by Shom
ron.
The Entebbe raid was a mas
terpiece of deception. Ari Israeli
command plane, a Boeing 707
transport, radioed the Etebbe
tower that it was an Air France
jet bringing to Uganda the Pales
tinian prisoners whose release
the terrorists had demanded.
As the 707 circled, drawing at
tention, three C-130 transports
landed quietly at the end of the
runway and unloaded the com
mandos in vehicles who took the
terminal building by surprise.

Among the vehicles was a
Mcrcedes Ben/ sedan painted to
resemble one used hv Uganda
dictator Idi Amin. The Israeli
forces carried Russian-made
AK-47 assault rifles of the same
sort used by Ugandan troops so
their gunfire could be mistaken
tor those of other Uganda units.
I'hc main Israeli assault force
maintained strict radio silence,
which the U.S. forces involvcd in
the Iranian raid did not. A Tel
Aviv radio journalist, who
monitors foreign broadcasts for
Israeli radio and television,
plugged into the U.S. operations
channel for the Iran mission and
learned about the mission while
it was in progress in Iran.
Israeli television broadcast the
fact that an American operation
was under way. The United
States later complained to Isiael
about the broadcast.
During the 1977 West tier
man raid to tree a Lufthansa jot
held by terrorists in Mogadishu,
Somalia, the same journalist did
the same thing. The Germans
had not maintained radio si
lence, either. The United States,
Israeli experts noted, apparently
did not learn from the 1977 les
son.
"The fact is," said Benvamin
Metanyahu, executive co
chairman of Jerusalem's
Jonathan Institute on Terrorism,
that terrorism is not a local prob
lem. "There are lines of support
between these groups, and there
has to be cooperation between
the nations facing them."
Netanyahu, whose brother
Jonathan, for whom the institute
was named, was killed Jeadmg
the Entebbe strike, criticized
what lie called the United States'
failure to "take the forefront' in
the campaign against terrorism
and the Palestine Liberation Or
ganization.

one Israeli expert. "We could

How would the Israelis have
done it? The week before the
American attempt, Maj. Gen.
Dan Shomron, who directed the
1976 Entebbe raid, outlined to
an Israeli editor how the Tehran
hostages might be freed:
Iran's state of near-chaos
would simplify a military move
to free the hostages. A rescue
team could move among the var
ious armed Iranian groups with
out causing alarm. "Blending
with the general situation," they

could, he said, "find openings for
action."
Information from Tehran in
dicates that the American force
had Iranian insignias to apply to
U.S. helicopters, and that Ira
nians were among the U.S. raid
ers — suggesting that the U.S.
plan may have included some of
the ideas mentioned by Shom
ron.
The Entebbe raid was a mas
terpiece of deception. Ari Israeli
command plane, a Boeing 707
transport, radioed the Etebbe
tower that it was an Air France
jet bringing to Uganda the Pales
tinian prisoners whose release
the terrorists had demanded.
As the 707 circled, drawing at
tention, three C-130 transports
landed quietly at the end of the
runway and unloaded the com
mandos in vehicles who took the
terminal building by surprise.

Among the vehicles was a
Mcrcedes Ben/ sedan painted to
resemble one used hv Uganda
dictator Idi Amin. The Israeli
forces carried Russian-made
AK-47 assault rifles of the same
sort used by Ugandan troops so
their gunfire could be mistaken
tor those of other Uganda units.
I'hc main Israeli assault force
maintained strict radio silence,
which the U.S. forces involvcd in
the Iranian raid did not. A Tel
Aviv radio journalist, who
monitors foreign broadcasts for
Israeli radio and television,
plugged into the U.S. operations
channel for the Iran mission and
learned about the mission while
it was in progress in Iran.
Israeli television broadcast the
fact that an American operation
was under way. The United
States later complained to Isiael
about the broadcast.
During the 1977 West tier
man raid to tree a Lufthansa jot
held by terrorists in Mogadishu,
Somalia, the same journalist did
the same thing. The Germans
had not maintained radio si
lence, either. The United States,
Israeli experts noted, apparently
did not learn from the 1977 les
son.
"The fact is," said Benvamin
Metanyahu, executive co
chairman of Jerusalem's
Jonathan Institute on Terrorism,
that terrorism is not a local prob
lem. "There are lines of support
between these groups, and there
has to be cooperation between
the nations facing them."
Netanyahu, whose brother
Jonathan, for whom the institute
was named, was killed Jeadmg
the Entebbe strike, criticized
what lie called the United States'
failure to "take the forefront' in
the campaign against terrorism

JERUSALEM — The United
States made basic blunders in its
aborted raid into Iran, according
to Israeli military experts, who
claim to have more experience
than anyone in the world in clan
destine operations. Among the
mistakes:
— U.S. forces failed to main
tain radio silence, which gave
away details of the operation
while it was "-till in progress.
— The United States did not
provide contingency planning
tor events that would go wrong
— "something goes wrong every
mission," an Israeli expert said
— so when three helicopters
tailed no replacements were av
ailable.
Once committed to the opera
tion, the United States backed
out of it "Once we got into an
operation." an Israeli said, spac
ing the words for emphasis, "we
cannot fail. It las to go on."
After ihe political decision
was made, Israeli military plan
ners devised the strike into En
tebbe in 48 hours. An Israeli who
was in on the Entebbe planning
said Thursday, shaking his head:
"Six months. Can you imagine
what you could Jo in six months?
In that time, you could find a
house a mile from the embassy,
bring the compressors piece by
piece, and tunnel your way into
the compound '
Two things especially
bothered Israeli tacticians about
the American operation: The
reported plan to stay overnight
before striking. and the hasty
withdrawal leaving bodies.

documents and helicopters at the
landing area.
'Having it drawn out over two
nights, this is incredible," said
one expert. "It is non
professional. The basis of every
clandestine operation is to move
swiftly, and >trike by surprise."
I he Israeli military considers
bringing out a dead Israeli al
most as serious as evacuating a
wounded man When Israelis say
of the Americans, "they left be
hind their dead," it is with a sad
ness close to despair.

Israelis take no pleasure in the
U.S. failure, even though they
are rankled by the fact that the
United States did not ask for as
sistance trom Israel in planning
its mission. Israel treed more
than 100 hostages at Entebbe,
and has carried out scored of sec

Beirut airport in 1968 and the
ihett of an entire radar station
