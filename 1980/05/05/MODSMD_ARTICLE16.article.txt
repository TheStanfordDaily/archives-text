## Editorial COP: job well done 
### 
Sibby Freeman, Tom Gart. Mary Leßlanc,
and Laura Mead began their term last spring as
the Council of Presidents with little more than
the ASSLJ Bylaws and Constitution and the
keys to their second-floor Tresidder offices.
Recently, they handed over detailed job
manuals and well-defined roles within the ad
ministration and the ASSU Senate to the new
COP.
We'd like to thank the COP members for
their hours of dedicated work, manifest in the
Theatre Guild, the Minority Coordinating
Committee, plans for a faculty/staff award to be
given for service to students, and intense work
with the senate to win the Coffee House bid.
The bid and the COP's input on a commission
investigating Tresidder's future are first steps
toward the real student union we'd like to see.

This COP met the ehallenges presented by
membership on many University committees.
It's not easy for student input to ha\e impact on
these committees, but the COP rose to a dif
ficult situation. By dealing with the administra
tion on its own level, the COP effectively advo
cated student positions. We applaud this COP.
They have earned the respect of faculty, ad
ministrators and students.
The job manuals were one tangible result of
this COP's year-long push lor ASSU continuity
and credibility. The COP worked with the se
nate to reach other goals: ASSU election re
form. passed in March, stipulates spring elec
tions and ensures a year-round senate.
This COP has truly set a standard of excel
lence and action. Freeman. Cart, Leßlanc and
Mead will be a tough act to follow.
