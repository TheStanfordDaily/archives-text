## Channel Cowell complaints 
### 
Students here do a lot of comp
laining about the care they re
ceive at Cowell Student Health
Center. Mostly these complaints
begin and end in the dorm dining
room and therefore never get
back to Cowell.
Last quarter we investigated
what feedback channels for
complaints and suggestions
Cowell had for students. We also
studied systems on other college
campuses. Though the channels
here arc quite informal, the di
rector and others at Cowell are
very billing to hear what stu
dents have to say. We suggest
that Cowell make this fact better
known by expressing their in
terest in the Daily and in dorm
flyers.
On several other campuses
there are student complaint
suggestion boards run either out
of the health center or b> the
student association. These or
ganizations are usually called
Student Health Advisory Com
mittees (SHACs) and have
communication with each other
through a newsletter and at

biannual conferences. Though
the staff at Cowell has tried in the
past to form SHACs here, there
has not been a great deal of suc
cess or interest. Though some of
this was apathy, we do not think
that the SHAC positions were
publicized or organized as they
should have been.
The SHACs on other cam
puses have not been trouble
free. The most effective ones are
independent from the campus
health centers, yet also meet with
and have the enthusiastic sup
port of the centers. We areuiot
sure that a SHAC per se is the
solution for unheard student
feedback to Cowell. but we do
suggest that student participa
tion is an important ingredient of
an effective sy stem of communi
cation.
One proposal that might prove
effective here is the formation of
a "Cobud" group. This two stu
dent, two Cowell staff, co
omfruJsperson group would
maintain office hours at Cowell
when only student, only staff, or
both kinds of cobud members

would be present. A group like
this would be approachable to
both students and Cowell staff as
each individual chooses who he
or she wants to see.
The student members, chosen
by the ASSU committees' pro
cedure, could maintain their au
tonomy by meeting with the
ASSU, and could at the same
time foster understanding with
Cowell staff by working closely
with them. The Cowell staff
cobuds could provide the group
with expertise and would be a
link to other staff members.
We have presented a full
proposal to Cowell and will be
discussing it with them. Ulti
mately. it is up to the students
here to make some kind of effort
if they really expect improved
campus health services. We be
lieve Cowell i> listening, what do
you say?
