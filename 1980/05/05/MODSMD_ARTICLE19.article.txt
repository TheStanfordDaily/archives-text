## Don't judge Carter's Iran plan 
### 
After the announcement that the United
States military had tailed in an attempt to
rescue the hostages in Iran. I was somewhat
surprised at the reactions of many of my fel
low students. At least four out of five stu
dents 1 spoke with condemned the rescue
attempt because it was "a stupid thing to do."
Several remarked that "the plan" never
would have worked, and"( President Jimmy)
Carter is just trying to be reelected."
I question the short-sightedness of those
with these attitudes. My main complaint is
that we may not know exactly what the plan
entailed. No matter what the newspapers
say, even if they report word for word what
they are told, we still may not know the full
details of the plan.
Would you be surprised if the military was
reluctant to relate explicit details of a top
secret mission that held the lives of 50
Americans in the balance? Undoubtedly.
President Carter received great amounts of
information concerning the number of milit
ants guarding the hostages, carrying guns,
etc.
Even so. Carter would not have been the
only one to decide whether the plan (what
ever it really was) would work — he has a
staff of some of the world's best generals to
tell him if it would. In fact, it was the National
Security Council who actually decided, not
Carter alone.
In answer to those who claim Carter was

simply trying "to gain political glory," (Peter
Duignan, Daily, April 28) it seems strange to
me that on such a "dangerous" mission ("It
was a .. . dangerous . . . thing to do." —
Duignan again) where there was a good
chance for a few hostages to be killed, that
Carter would be trying to gain political glory.
If the helicopters had gotten through and
one of the hostages was even injured. Carter
must have known that his opponents could
have easily used the opportunity to say he
had nearly killed all of the hostages. In other
words, even if Carter did mean to "gain polit
ical glory," he could only do so if all the
hostages were returned safely. Therefore,
they must have had a plan they knew would
work, once they got to Tehran.
Also, many comments I have heard are
directed toward the possibility of the hos
tages being executed because of the rescue
attempt: "The militants holding these indi
viduals. . . have threatened repeatedly to kill
them in the event of an attempted military

rescue." (David Sartoris, Daily, April 29)
Well, we attempted a military rescue. Arc
the hostages dead? It must be realized that
when a group of people holding hostages fqr
the purpose of gaining something (not for a
specific "cause" as with some Middle Hast
terrorists) they will not kill their hostages
simply because it would leave them with ab
solutely no bargaining power.
I strongly suggest that we take into account
that which we do not know. Given the infor
mation released by the press over the last few
months, 1 don't believe anyone would have
moved to free the hostages. But remember
that we do not necessarily know all that the
National Security Council knew at the time
of its decision. We may later find that we
have already been given the full details of the
rescue attempt, but until then, have an open
mind and remember that the government
doesn't have to tell us everything.
