# Tito dies after long illness

From the Daily wire services
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — President Josip Tito,
creator of modern Yugoslavia and the first communist
leader to break away from the Soviet Bloc, died yesterday
after a grave illness that lasted more than four months. He
would have been 88 on May 7.
Tito, one of the last surviv ing leaders of World War 11 and
a founder of the non-aligned movement, died hours after
his team of eight doctors issued a medical bulletin saying he
had slipped into critical condition with heart failure.
The announcement of Tito's death, in a hospital in the
northwestern city of Ljubljana, was made by a nationwide
television commentator who said in a halting voice, "Com
rade Tito has died. His great heart stopped beatingat 15:05
(10:05 a.m. EDT)."
He had been hospitalized in Ljubljana for nearly four
months following a blood vessel blockage that led to ampu
tation of his left leg.
The president's office and the Communist Party leader
ship said Tito's body would be taken on a special train to
Belgrade today and would lie in state in the Federal Parlia
ment building until Thursday. He is to be buried Thursday
near the Museum of the Revolution in suburban Belgrade.
A Western diplomat in Belgrade described the men who
will succeed Tito as "loyal lieutenants," who "can all be
expected to put on a good show of making the system
work."
Tito had established a collective leadership structure to
take over after his death, and his vice president, Lazar
Kolisevski, 66, was installed as president last night with
portions of the ceremony televised. Kolisevski was serving a
one-year term as vice president, and his term of office —
now as president — is due to expire later this month. The
presidency is to rotate among eight men.
Stevan Doronjski, 61, is to replace Tito as head of the
Communist Party, but will share control with 22 others.
Outwardly, Belgrade and other major Yugoslav cities
remained calm as news of the president's death traveled
fast. Many Yugoslavs first heard the news after returning
home from mountain and seaside resorts following an ex
tended May Day holiday.
The lengthy death vigil for Tito, which lasted three
months longer than that for Spanish Leader General Fran
cisco Franco in 1975, has undoubtedly helped prepare
Yugoslavs psychologically for the transition. After an initial
flurry of nervousness when Tito was first admitted to the
hospital in early January, the new Yugoslav leaders have
gradually eased themselves into their new responsibilities.
Even so, yesterday's announcement of his death came as
a considerable shock.
In the final medical report the president's panel of doc
tors revealed that he had been suffering from diabetes and
kidney disease for many years. These problems, combined
with arteriosclerosis, came to a head in December shortly
before he was admitted to the Ljubljana Clinic,
lavia's best-equipped hospital for heart and circulatory dis

eases.
In his first act as head of state, Kolisevski ordered seven
days of mourning, during which all flags will be flown at half
mast and public events and entertainments canceled.
Yugoslav newspapers rushed out special, black-bordered
editions commemorating the remarkable career of a man
who took part in the Russian revolution, led a guerrilla
uprising in World War 11, and survived an attempt by
Joseph Stalin to depose him in 1948.
1 ito s wartime partisans were credited with ridding
then-monarchist Yugoslavia of German and Italian oc
cupiers in World War 11 and it was chiefly his success in that
effort that vaulted him over monarchists and other
nationalists in 1945 to the undisputed leadership of Yugos
lavia.
His determined independence led him to a historic 1 948
break with the Soviet Union that was never entirely
mended.
More than three decades after Stalin cast Yugoslavia out
of the Soviet bloc, Tito was still openly opposing Moscow's
policies and ruling unchallenged over a Communist nation
armed to defeat Warsaw Pact aggressors.
A waiter and metal worker in his teens, Tito rose to
become a venerated national hero.
Born Josip Broz on May 7, 1892, son of a Croatian
farmer, Yugoslavia's legendary leader took the name Tito
during the years in the pre-war Communist underground.
He kept it the rest of his life.
