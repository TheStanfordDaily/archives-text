# We don't measure up on 'character meter'
## 
### 
A while back, Howard K. Smith did a show on public
television called The Presidency. At one point, he asked
several of the recent luminaries of that institution what
they thought was the most necessary quality to make a
good president. One after the other, Richard Nixon,
Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter mentioned character.
(Hold the snickers back there.)
Ask most people' what those three men meant by the
term character, and they would answer something like
integrity, honesty, telling the truth. But this is not what
Nixon, Ford and Carter had in mind. I think what they
had in mind was more like the ability to hold together in
the face of constant and daily adversity — in the form of
resistance to their will by friend and foe, conflicting
advice, outright failure and public criticism.
The fact is, we don't talk much about character. We
talk instead about lifestyle, an altogether mousier and
more narcissistic idea. Lifestyle points to the self, and
presupposes the freedom and leisure necessary to impart
a style to one's life. Character points to something other
and larger than the self. It refers to the acceptance of
weighty responsibility and presupposes a prior commit
ment to something equally weighty.
The avoidance of such responsibility has gained a
certain currency among us. We talk admiringly of people
keeping their options open, and we praise those who
exploit thc'ir freedom and leisure to make diverse and
intersting lives for themselves.
To a certain extent, we live in a lifestyle-oriented
society. Cohabitation is up, marrying and raising a family

is down. Buying on credit, for the present, and for one
self is up. Saving for the future and for others is down.
Character connotes the stability to survive hard times. In
the easier times in which we live, we tend to value change
instead.
Character is abetted by a sense of transcendent pur
pose. With the decline of religious, patriotic and marital
values, a sense of transcendent purpose is missing for a
lot of people.

The closest thing to a sense of transcendent purpose
we have in our neo-Puritan hankering after the perfect
society. We talk a lot about stamping out racism, sexism,
ageism. What we do not talk so much about is grooming
the kind of individual in whom those attitudes would be
inconceivable. Such an individual would have what I

take to be the more correct definition of integrity. He or
she does good because he or she is good, rather than
being good becausc he or she does good.
I think there are at least two important reasons why we
don't talk about character or integrity in this way. First,
we believe less th'j" ever that thefe is such an integrity.
Everything is complex, in our view, and the personality is
no exception. We routinely say things like, "One side of
me feels this way, but another side of mc feels that way,"
as though the personality, like a diamond, has 58 facets.
Unlike a diamond, however, we presume less and less
that there is »ny principle of coherence behind the com
plexity.
Second, for 2000 years or so we in the West
have looked at ethics like a scientific model. First it was
the lists of vices and virtues passed on from pre-Christian
to Christian thinkers, which borrowed objectivity, univ
ersality and analytical classification from philosophy. In
more recent times, the pursuit of objective rules of con
duct as a basis for ethics has gone on in earnest.
For these reasons and others — some of long standing,
some of more recent origin — the formation of what
Nixon and Ford and Carter referred to as character is
virtually absent in our culture. And if we are dissatisfied
with how our recent presidential candidates measure up
on the character meter, maybe it is because we are
getting candidates who reflect ourselves all too accu
rately
