## Unite to solve everybody's energy problem 
### 
During the '70s, the fact that the Un
ited States was using about 30 percent of
the world's energy resources arose as a
ma jor economic and environmental prob
lem.
Where then do we look for energy
supplies that do not require increasingly
scarce fuel, complex equipment and se
vere environmental degradation? Hie
answer is in every house and apartment in
the nation, in every institutional and
commercial building, in every industry
and farm, in every car, truck, bus and
plane.
While big government and big business
search for one or two big energy supplies,
there are millions of little ones located
wherever energy is being used. There is an
enormous potential for meeting our cur
rent and future energy uses with less
primary energy resources.
Knergy-saving options can take the
form of technology replacement, effi
ciency improvement, waste elimination or
lifestyle modification.
Technology replacements include in
dustrial cogeneration, solar water heaters
and lighter, more efficient vehicles. Effi
ciency improvements include electronic
energy monitoring, insulation and well
tuned engines. Energy waste can be re
duced by eliminating unneeded lighting,
turning down thermostats and observing

speed limits. Bicycling, avoiding proces
sed foods and installing greenhouses con
stitute energy saving life-style changes,
which are usually motivated primarily by
considerations other than energy.
The first three of the above categories
do not impose any significant lifestyle alt
erations, and all such energy-saving mea
sures are technically proven. Further
more, the implementation of these types
of measures require less capital and gen
erate more employment at the margin
than the production of the same amount
of energy from conventional sources.
Hie importance of energy conservation
is now being endorsed by such conven
tional institutions as the Harvard Busi
ness School ("Conservation could do
more than any of the conventional
sources to help the country deal with its
energy problem.") and the Ford Founda
tion ("Conservation is an essential source
of energy in large quantities.").
What each citizen needs in order to
promote energy conservation is the con
sciousness to avoid energy waste and the
knowledge to accept opportunities to im
plement energy-saving technologies.
These concepts arc quite simple, but they
have been obscured by the bureaucratic
furor over oil pipelines and nuclear power
plants.
Being conscious of energy waste takes

no more thought or effort than a person's
everyday concern over spending money
or consuming calories. Turning off lights
when one leaves a room should be as
habitual as turning them on when one
enters.
Moreover, once we realize that the
energy problem is everybody's problem,
we'll find out where to look for efficient
appliances and vehicles, where to recycle
used materials, how to install insulation
and solar energy devices and how to pro
mote statutes and policies that overcome
the barriers to energy efficiency.
The current contusion and lack of
awareness of the public's role in the
energy problem is one such barrier. The
other major barrier is economic, and re
sults from the basic fact that those who
consume energy resources and those who
produce them are two entirely distinct
groups with vastly different investment
priorities and access to capital.
On one hand, there are the oil com
panies and electric utilities with much cap
ital available for energy technology in
vestments but little ability to attack the
many decentralized conservation op
tions. On the other hand, there are the
residential and industrial energy users,
potentially the energy savers as well, who
have very tight budgets and many invest
ment options besides energy conscrva

tion.
Current fuel price controls, utility rate
structures and tax policies make energy
supplies appear artificially cheap, further
discouraging energy-saving investments.
These disincentives can he reversed by
realistic energy pricing, revamped tax
policies that stimulate adoption of con
servation and solar equipment, and utility
financing of this equipment.
The implementation of the above mea
sures requires active public support, just
as the avoidance of energy waste and the
acceptance of energy-efficient technology
requires constant public awareness. In
deed, energy is everybody's problem, but
that only means that we each have the
opportunity to contribute to its solution.

Being conscious of energy waste takes

no more thought or effort than a person's
everyday concern over spending money
or consuming calories. Turning off lights
when one leaves a room should be as
habitual as turning them on when one
enters.
Moreover, once we realize that the
energy problem is everybody's problem,
we'll find out where to look for efficient
appliances and vehicles, where to recycle
used materials, how to install insulation
and solar energy devices and how to pro
mote statutes and policies that overcome
the barriers to energy efficiency.
The current contusion and lack of
awareness of the public's role in the
energy problem is one such barrier. The
other major barrier is economic, and re
sults from the basic fact that those who
consume energy resources and those who
produce them are two entirely distinct
groups with vastly different investment
priorities and access to capital.
On one hand, there are the oil com
panies and electric utilities with much cap
ital available for energy technology in
vestments but little ability to attack the
many decentralized conservation op
tions. On the other hand, there are the
residential and industrial energy users,
potentially the energy savers as well, who
have very tight budgets and many invest
ment options besides energy conscrva

tion.
Current fuel price controls, utility rate
structures and tax policies make energy
supplies appear artificially cheap, further
discouraging energy-saving investments.
These disincentives can he reversed by
realistic energy pricing, revamped tax
policies that stimulate adoption of con
servation and solar equipment, and utility
financing of this equipment.
The implementation of the above mea
sures requires active public support, just
as the avoidance of energy waste and the
acceptance of energy-efficient technology
requires constant public awareness. In
deed, energy is everybody's problem, but
that only means that we each have the
opportunity to contribute to its solution.

During the '70s, the fact that the Un
ited States was using about 30 percent of
the world's energy resources arose as a
ma jor economic and environmental prob
lem.
Where then do we look for energy
supplies that do not require increasingly
scarce fuel, complex equipment and se
vere environmental degradation? Hie
answer is in every house and apartment in
the nation, in every institutional and
commercial building, in every industry
and farm, in every car, truck, bus and
plane.
While big government and big business
search for one or two big energy supplies,
there are millions of little ones located
wherever energy is being used. There is an
enormous potential for meeting our cur
rent and future energy uses with less
primary energy resources.
Knergy-saving options can take the
form of technology replacement, effi
ciency improvement, waste elimination or
lifestyle modification.
Technology replacements include in
dustrial cogeneration, solar water heaters
and lighter, more efficient vehicles. Effi
ciency improvements include electronic
energy monitoring, insulation and well
tuned engines. Energy waste can be re
duced by eliminating unneeded lighting,
turning down thermostats and observing

speed limits. Bicycling, avoiding proces
sed foods and installing greenhouses con
stitute energy saving life-style changes,
which are usually motivated primarily by
considerations other than energy.
The first three of the above categories
do not impose any significant lifestyle alt
erations, and all such energy-saving mea
sures are technically proven. Further
more, the implementation of these types
of measures require less capital and gen
erate more employment at the margin
than the production of the same amount
of energy from conventional sources.
Hie importance of energy conservation
is now being endorsed by such conven
tional institutions as the Harvard Busi
ness School ("Conservation could do
more than any of the conventional
sources to help the country deal with its
energy problem.") and the Ford Founda
tion ("Conservation is an essential source
of energy in large quantities.").
What each citizen needs in order to
promote energy conservation is the con
sciousness to avoid energy waste and the
knowledge to accept opportunities to im
plement energy-saving technologies.
These concepts arc quite simple, but they
have been obscured by the bureaucratic
furor over oil pipelines and nuclear power
plants.
