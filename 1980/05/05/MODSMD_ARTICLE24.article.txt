# Stanford 0-14 in conference away games
## UCLA blanks homesick Card 9 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
In what was probably the season's most
untimely series of losses, the Stanford
baseball team fell apart this weekend as it
was swept in three by the UCLA Bruins, 4-2,
4-1 and 9-4.
And as anyone who is familiar with the
game knows, three strikes and yer out. This
time, it was the Cards who went down on
their proverbial third strike.
And with the multiple losses, all Card
hopes of first or even second place in the
conference have been laid to waste Their
Pac-10 party is now over.
They had to win at least two of the three
games to have a fighting shot at catching the
league-leading Cal Bears and the second
place Arizona Wildcats. (Arizona has since
replaced Cal for first place.)
But instead, said team captain Paul
Zuvella, they "just got beat."
Getting beat on the road is becoming all
too familiar to the Cards. Every single one of
their 14 conference away games has ended in
defeat. At home, on the other hand, they
have lost but twice in Pac-10 play.
/Said Zuvella, "We've been wondering
about why we can't win on the road all year, i

can't pinpoint it though, but it's obvious that
we don't play well.
"Maybe it's the different fields or condi
tions. Or maybe it's the visibility. 1 don't
know. But it sure doesn't seem to effect the
other teams as much," he added.
The home field advantage certainly didn't
hurt the UCLAns a bit. In fact, they're not
even playing on their home field this year as
it is being torn up for remodeling. The home
games are at nearby Pepperdine's home
field.
Nevertheless, the Bruins jumped to an
early lead in all three games and the Cards
were unable to mount a comeback.
"We were behind early and that hurt us,"
Zuvella said. "For the game we play, we have
to get ahead early. We like to run a lot and hit
and run, too, but we weren't able to do that
this weekend."
Tlicy weren't able to do that, according to
Zuvella, because UCLA got good pitching
and Stanford didn't hit. "Ami that was pretty
much the story." he said.
"UCLA threw two of the best four
pitchers in the league at us. In the first game,
Burt Young was tough against us. He was
ahead (on the count) all day long and was
clocked at one time at 95 inph. Still, we

should have hit but we didn't," said Zuvella.
The Cards got some pretty fair pitching
performances themselves in the first two
games. In Saturday's doubleheader, Larry
Kuhn and Brian Mignano both went the dis
tance in "good pitching performances that
we wasted."
Wasted indeed, as they were getting some
lucky breaks up North and down South.
"We knew that 'rizona had beaten Cal in
the first two games and that USC was beating
Arizona State and it was a boost. It (needing
to take the UCLA series) was definitely on
our minds but we didn't do anything about
it," added Zuvella.
The Cards ha\e ample opportunity to take
out their frustrations this week, however.
Tuesday night they play in Santa Clara and
then starting Thursday in Sunken Diamond,
the Cards take on Cal in a three game free
way series, the second game will be played in
Berkeley, the third back at home.
"Both Cal and Arizona have pretty much
wrapped up the conference, but we always
like to beat Cal .There will be no let-up. Who
knows, maybe we might even be a little
looser," said Zuvella.

Stanford catcher Bill Worden blocks the plate for a moment earlier this season, but the ball
pops loose and a run scores. Worden and the rest of the Cardinals suffered three disappointing
defeats this weekend at the hands of the UCLA Bruins.
