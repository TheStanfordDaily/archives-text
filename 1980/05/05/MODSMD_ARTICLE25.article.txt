Stanford's mens' tennis team
continued its winning ways
over the weekend as it cruised
to a pair of wins over Arizona
State and Arizona. On Friday
the Cards blasted the Sun Devils
8-1, and on Saturday they de
feated the Wildcats from

Arizona 7-2. The Cards have
now extended their win streak to
nine matches since dropping
their Pacific-10 conference
opener to California, and are
currently tied with USC for the
conference lead with a 7-1 re
cord.
Equally impressive as the lop
sided score for the Cards was

the fact that they notched the vic
tories with their No. 1 ace, Peter
Rennert, sitting out the singles.
Bothered by a sore back and
strained knee, Rennert com
peted only in the doubles where
he and Lloyd Bourne teamed to
score two impressive wins.
But coach Dick Gould
seemed confident that Rennert
will return to action Thursday

against UCLA and Saturday ver
sus USC.
"Peter's knees were bothering
him so we thought we'd save him
for the big matches coming up"
Gould said. Fortunately, the
team played really well and his
absence in the singles didn't hurt
us. He'll be ready to go for
UCLA and USC."

Netwomen Sue Rasmussen put in a good effort this weekend
against UCLA, hut lost in three sets in singles and Was de
feated again in three with partner Alycia Moulton in the
doubles competition.
Filling in for Rennert in the
No. 1 spot for Stanford was
sophomore Tim Mayotte. And
Mayotte responded as he has all
season long by chalking up
another two victories to extend
his personal win streak in singles
action to 1-5. On Friday against
the Sun Devils Mayotte disposed
ot Tim Anderson 7-6,6-2 and on
Saturday Mayotte defeated a
tough Andy Gordon in three
sets. 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. A day earlier.
Gordon had defeated Cal's No. 1
man Scott McCain as the two
went to simultaneous match
point with Gordon pulling out a
5-4 tie breaker in the third and
final set.Cal narrowly slipped by
Arizona State 5-4.
Also impressive for the Cards
was the play of two treshmen,
Dave Siegler and Jim Gurfein.
Siegler JtTntinued to improve his
collegiate record as he scored
two impressive victories, and
Gurfein playing in the No. 6
spot, surrendered only six games
in his two matches, winning 6-3,

6-0 on Friday and 6-1, 6-2
against Arizona on Saturday.
"If I had to single out indi
viduals. I'd have to say that the
two freshmen. Siegler and Gur
fein, did a great job." Gould
commented. "Dave continues to
improve his game and Gurf re
ally filled in well. Mayotte also
did a heck of a job moving into
" the No. 1 position. They were
tough matches for the team to
play with the big matches ahead
of us, and they did a line job."

ot Tim Anderson 7-6,6-2 and on
Saturday Mayotte defeated a
tough Andy Gordon in three
sets. 3-6, 6-1, 6-4. A day earlier.
Gordon had defeated Cal's No. 1
man Scott McCain as the two
went to simultaneous match
point with Gordon pulling out a
5-4 tie breaker in the third and
final set.Cal narrowly slipped by
Arizona State 5-4.
Also impressive for the Cards
was the play of two treshmen,
Dave Siegler and Jim Gurfein.
Siegler JtTntinued to improve his
collegiate record as he scored
two impressive victories, and
Gurfein playing in the No. 6
spot, surrendered only six games
in his two matches, winning 6-3,

6-0 on Friday and 6-1, 6-2
against Arizona on Saturday.
"If I had to single out indi
viduals. I'd have to say that the
two freshmen. Siegler and Gur
fein, did a great job." Gould
commented. "Dave continues to
improve his game and Gurf re
ally filled in well. Mayotte also
did a heck of a job moving into
" the No. 1 position. They were
tough matches for the team to
play with the big matches ahead
of us, and they did a line job."

Stanford's mens' tennis team
continued its winning ways
over the weekend as it cruised
to a pair of wins over Arizona
State and Arizona. On Friday
the Cards blasted the Sun Devils
8-1, and on Saturday they de
feated the Wildcats from

Arizona 7-2. The Cards have
now extended their win streak to
nine matches since dropping
their Pacific-10 conference
opener to California, and are
currently tied with USC for the
conference lead with a 7-1 re
cord.
Equally impressive as the lop
sided score for the Cards was

the fact that they notched the vic
tories with their No. 1 ace, Peter
Rennert, sitting out the singles.
Bothered by a sore back and
strained knee, Rennert com
peted only in the doubles where
he and Lloyd Bourne teamed to
score two impressive wins.
But coach Dick Gould
seemed confident that Rennert
will return to action Thursday

against UCLA and Saturday ver
sus USC.
"Peter's knees were bothering
him so we thought we'd save him
for the big matches coming up"
Gould said. Fortunately, the
team played really well and his
absence in the singles didn't hurt
us. He'll be ready to go for
UCLA and USC."

Netwomen Sue Rasmussen put in a good effort this weekend
against UCLA, hut lost in three sets in singles and Was de
feated again in three with partner Alycia Moulton in the
doubles competition.
Filling in for Rennert in the
No. 1 spot for Stanford was
sophomore Tim Mayotte. And
Mayotte responded as he has all
season long by chalking up
another two victories to extend
his personal win streak in singles
action to 1-5. On Friday against
the Sun Devils Mayotte disposed
