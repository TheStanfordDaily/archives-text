Stanford's mens' tennis team
continued its winning ways
over the weekend as it cruised
to a pair of wins over Arizona
State and Arizona. On Friday
the Cards blasted the Sun Devils
8-1, and on Saturday they de
feated the Wildcats from

Arizona 7-2. The Cards have
now extended their win streak to
nine matches since dropping
their Pacific-10 conference
opener to California, and are
currently tied with USC for the
conference lead with a 7-1 re
cord.
Equally impressive as the lop
sided score for the Cards was

the fact that they notched the vic
tories with their No. 1 ace, Peter
Rennert, sitting out the singles.
Bothered by a sore back and
strained knee, Rennert com
peted only in the doubles where
he and Lloyd Bourne teamed to
score two impressive wins.
But coach Dick Gould
seemed confident that Rennert
will return to action Thursday

against UCLA and Saturday ver
sus USC.
"Peter's knees were bothering
him so we thought we'd save him
for the big matches coming up"
Gould said. Fortunately, the
team played really well and his
absence in the singles didn't hurt
us. He'll be ready to go for
UCLA and USC."
