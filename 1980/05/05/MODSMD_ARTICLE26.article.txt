# Bruins surprise netwomen

### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
Being in the unaccustomed position of needing
only one doubles match to defeat the UCLA
Bruins, the Stanford women's tennis team
promptly dropped all three to give UCLA its first
win over Stanford this year by a 5-4 margin.
In two previous matches the Cardinals have
come out on top by 5-4 margins.
Stanford, led by a surprising 6-1, 6-0 victory by
Lisa Gordon in the No. 6 singles spot, held a 4-2
lead going into the doubles and needed only one
more match to seal the victory.
Hie Cards also picked up singles victories by
Alycia Moulton. Donna Rubin and Carvn Cope
land in the top three matches.
Moulton edged Kathy O'Brien 7-5, 6-4 at No.
Rubin squeezed by Lucy Gordon in three sets 6-4,
3-6, 6-2 at No. 2, and Copeland handled Karin
Huebner 6-3, 6-1.
Stanford coach Frank Brennan expected to win
these matches as the top of the line-up has been the
strength of the Stanford team all year.
The surprise came in the bottom three spots of
the line-up, where the Cards were again expected
to have trouble with the exceptionally deep UCLA
lineup, but all three players came through with
gritty matches.
Aside from Gordon's trouncing of Cindy
Campbell at No. 6, Sue Rasmussen and Julia

Leighton both scrambled in tense, three-set
matches.
Rasmussen lost to All-America Becky Bell 2-6,
7-6, 6-1 in the No. 4 match and Leighton was
edged by Liz Stalder 2-6, 6-2, 6-4 in the number
five match.
Had another ball bounced Stanford's way in
either of these two matches, UCLA would have
been sent to bed early.
As it was, UCLA bounced back aggressively to
win all three doubles matches — an area where
Stanford had dominated in the two previous out
ings.
O'Brien and Bell coasted to a 6-3, 6-3 win over
Moulton and Rasmussen in the No. 1 match and
Huebner and Gordon easily handled Rubin and
* Copetand 6-2, 6-3 in the No. 2 match.
Again Stanford rested on the play of its lower
players and again they almost came through to
meet the challenge.
After dropping the first set to Campbell and
Stalder (and it was apparent that no one was in a
position to give them help in winning the team
competition), Leighton and Gayle Chan struggled
back to capture the second set.
In the all-too-crucial third set, Leighton and
Chan continued to scrap for the team title in the
3-3 match, but UCLA's depth proved too great,
and Campbell and Stalder squeaked to a 6-4 third
set win.
