# Lakers rally to 109-102 first game win
## 
### Scott Ostler The Los Angeles Times 
INGLEWOOD, Calif. — Laker Lightning was
stronger than Chocolate Thunder, Dr. J's medicine or
anything else the Philadelphia 76ers could come up with
yesterday afternoon in Game 1 of the National Basket
ball Association championship series.
Pnlling off ihe same hit-and-run act that has worked
so well for them all season, the Lakers ran the Sixers off
the court in the third quarter, and held on to win, 109-
102. before 17,505 fans in the Forum.
If Darryl Dawkins doesn't snap out of his Chocolate
Slumber, if Julius (Dr. J) doesn't find a remedy
for the defense the Lakers dropped on him like a net. and
if the Sixers can't persuade NBA officials that Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar is of mandatory retirement age, this could
be a short scries.
The Sixers are sure to make some adjustments before
Game 2, Wednesday night. For sure they'll be studying
clips of the third quarter, and coach Billy Cunningham's
review on that bit of film probably won't b«* suitable for
publication in a family newspaper.
During the third quarter the Lakers outscored the
Sixers, 31 to 17 to parlay a halftime tie into a 14-point
lead going into the final quaiter. The Lakers scored the
first 12 points of the quarter, beginning with Abdul-

Jabbar's 18-foot jump shot.
The Laker defense held the Sixers to three field goals
in 20 shots at the hoop. The Sixers didn't score for the
first four and a half minutes of the period.
This was a game the Lakers were obviously ready for.
Mike Cooper woke up at 4:30, eight hours before tipoff
time, thoughts of Dr. J "jammin' through my mind." He
passed the predawn hours watching a film of the Sixers'
win over the Lakers three months ago.
Norm Nixon was up at 3 a.m. to pick his mother up at
the airport. Kareem? Nobody knows if he even sleeps,
especially during April and May. Abdul-Jabbar scored
33 points, hit 14 of 21 shots and had 14 rebounds, five
assists and six blocked shots.
During one four minute stretch that put the Sixers
away in the fourth quarter, Abdul-Jabbar blocked shots
by Frving and 6-11 Caldwell Jones, hit two free shots
and a finger roll, passed to Nixon for a jump shot and
took a pass from Magic Johnson for a slam dunk and a
106-98 Laker lead with 1:04 left.
His mismatch with Dawkins, the 6-11, 260-pound
Sixer center, stood out like a shattered backboard. Daw
kins, in foul trouble early, played just 1 8 minutes, took
eight shots and had three rebounds.
As Sixer assistant coach Chuck Daly said before the
series. "You expect to get weak-side help on Kareem,
from your forward. But realistically, once he gets the ball
in there, you couldn't stop him with an airplane."

Usually it's the same type of challenge trying to guard
Dr. J, but. for one game at least, the Lakers kept Erving
from doing his usual destruction act. He scored 20, but
the Sixers needed something more spectacular from him.
Cooper and Jamaal Wilkes took turns guarding Erv
ing, with double-team help from whoever happened to
be in the neighborhood when he got the ball.
"They (The Sixers) got the ball to the guys we'd rather
see shoot it," said Laker assistant coach Pat Riley. "That
was out game plan. Not that Hollins and Bibby won't
hurt you. but you'd rather see them shooting than getting
the ball inside."
Lionel Hollins, playing with a sore shooting arm, hit
just seven out of 18 shots, and reserve guard Henry Bibby
made just two of nine shots.
"Numero uno was to contain the Doctor," said Laker
coach Paul Westhead. "The advantage we were working
ori is that Julius Erving is a great player who is unselfish.
When we double team him 30 feet out, it's difficult for
him to say, 'I'm gonna shoot.' He's too good a player to
flat-out gun when he's covered like that."
While Erving was quiet and Dawkins was silent, the
Lakers were making noise. Nixon scored 23 points and
Wilkes had 20. Magic Johnson, still somewhat under the
weather with a virus, came alive in the second half and
wound up with fairly typical stats for a 6-9 rookie point
guard-power forward —16 points (8 for 12 shooting), nine
rebounds, 10 assists, three steals.

Lakers were making noise. Nixon scored 23 points and
Wilkes had 20. Magic Johnson, still somewhat under the
weather with a virus, came alive in the second half and
wound up with fairly typical stats for a 6-9 rookie point
guard-power forward —16 points (8 for 12 shooting), nine
rebounds, 10 assists, three steals.
INGLEWOOD, Calif. — Laker Lightning was
stronger than Chocolate Thunder, Dr. J's medicine or
anything else the Philadelphia 76ers could come up with
yesterday afternoon in Game 1 of the National Basket
ball Association championship series.
Pnlling off ihe same hit-and-run act that has worked
so well for them all season, the Lakers ran the Sixers off
the court in the third quarter, and held on to win, 109-
102. before 17,505 fans in the Forum.
If Darryl Dawkins doesn't snap out of his Chocolate
Slumber, if Julius (Dr. J) doesn't find a remedy
for the defense the Lakers dropped on him like a net. and
if the Sixers can't persuade NBA officials that Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar is of mandatory retirement age, this could
be a short scries.
The Sixers are sure to make some adjustments before
Game 2, Wednesday night. For sure they'll be studying
clips of the third quarter, and coach Billy Cunningham's
review on that bit of film probably won't b«* suitable for
publication in a family newspaper.
During the third quarter the Lakers outscored the
Sixers, 31 to 17 to parlay a halftime tie into a 14-point
lead going into the final quaiter. The Lakers scored the
first 12 points of the quarter, beginning with Abdul-

Jabbar's 18-foot jump shot.
The Laker defense held the Sixers to three field goals
in 20 shots at the hoop. The Sixers didn't score for the
first four and a half minutes of the period.
This was a game the Lakers were obviously ready for.
Mike Cooper woke up at 4:30, eight hours before tipoff
time, thoughts of Dr. J "jammin' through my mind." He
passed the predawn hours watching a film of the Sixers'
win over the Lakers three months ago.
Norm Nixon was up at 3 a.m. to pick his mother up at
the airport. Kareem? Nobody knows if he even sleeps,
especially during April and May. Abdul-Jabbar scored
33 points, hit 14 of 21 shots and had 14 rebounds, five
assists and six blocked shots.
During one four minute stretch that put the Sixers
away in the fourth quarter, Abdul-Jabbar blocked shots
by Frving and 6-11 Caldwell Jones, hit two free shots
and a finger roll, passed to Nixon for a jump shot and
took a pass from Magic Johnson for a slam dunk and a
106-98 Laker lead with 1:04 left.
His mismatch with Dawkins, the 6-11, 260-pound
Sixer center, stood out like a shattered backboard. Daw
kins, in foul trouble early, played just 1 8 minutes, took
eight shots and had three rebounds.
As Sixer assistant coach Chuck Daly said before the
series. "You expect to get weak-side help on Kareem,
from your forward. But realistically, once he gets the ball
in there, you couldn't stop him with an airplane."

Usually it's the same type of challenge trying to guard
Dr. J, but. for one game at least, the Lakers kept Erving
from doing his usual destruction act. He scored 20, but
the Sixers needed something more spectacular from him.
Cooper and Jamaal Wilkes took turns guarding Erv
ing, with double-team help from whoever happened to
be in the neighborhood when he got the ball.
"They (The Sixers) got the ball to the guys we'd rather
see shoot it," said Laker assistant coach Pat Riley. "That
was out game plan. Not that Hollins and Bibby won't
hurt you. but you'd rather see them shooting than getting
the ball inside."
Lionel Hollins, playing with a sore shooting arm, hit
just seven out of 18 shots, and reserve guard Henry Bibby
made just two of nine shots.
"Numero uno was to contain the Doctor," said Laker
coach Paul Westhead. "The advantage we were working
ori is that Julius Erving is a great player who is unselfish.
When we double team him 30 feet out, it's difficult for
him to say, 'I'm gonna shoot.' He's too good a player to
flat-out gun when he's covered like that."
While Erving was quiet and Dawkins was silent, the
Lakers were making noise. Nixon scored 23 points and
Wilkes had 20. Magic Johnson, still somewhat under the
weather with a virus, came alive in the second half and
wound up with fairly typical stats for a 6-9 rookie point
guard-power forward —16 points (8 for 12 shooting), nine
