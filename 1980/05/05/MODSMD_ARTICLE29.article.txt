"We had a great day," said
* women's track coach Laurel
•* Treon of her team'sperformance
** at the non-scoring NorCal
*'■ championships held at UC-
Berkeley last Friday. Nine Card
qualifiers attended that meet in
the hopes of either attaining na
tional championship standards
or improving upon personal re
cords.
- Treon described those nine as
"the outstanding nucleus of
things yet to come for the wo

men's track team." In that sense,
freshman Pam Donald paved the
way in an exemplary fashion. She
finished first in the long jump
with a 19-IV4 leap and set
lifetime bests and new school re
cords in the 100- and 200-meter
dashes with a fourth-place 12.2
and a second-place 25.2 respec
tively.
Donald also anchored the
school-record pace of the mile
relay, which garnered third
place honors in 3:57.8. Shelley
Poerio, Andrea Cheek afid
Johnna Hansen were the other

members of that squad, which
has begun to race consistently
under four minutes. Such a re
cord is remarkable, according to
Treon, considering that two of
the current relay members ran
on last year's team that failed to
break 4:15.
Hansen, a senior, established
another new school record and
season highlight with a 64.6-
second clocking for fourth place
in her specialty, the 400-meter
hurdles. Freshman Meg Metzger
earned another Stanford fourth,
clearing 5-2 in the high jump.
Also in the field, freshman
Mary Osborne was third in the
javelin with a heave of 160-7 or
48.94 meters. She finished in her
seeded position against "some of
the best competition she's
fciced, v Treon said Osborne
hirtjed the discus her furthest dis
tance. 137-5, for seventh.
Hie Cards' other frosh stand
out, Kim Schnurpfeil, placed
second in the 3000 meters in

9:44.5, denoted "a very com
petitive effort" by Treon.
Schnurpfeil was on or ahead of
her target pace until the last 200
yards when she tightened up and
finished 10 seconds oft pace. Still,
"it was important that she had
that experience," Treon said. "It
was just what we were looking
for."
Tliis Friday the Cards will host
the Stanford Women's Classic at
Stanford Stadium. Another
non-scoring activity, Treon cal
led the event "a glorified all
comers meet. But we're hoping
to possibly make it into an attrac
tive meet" for top caliber com
petition in the future, she
explained.
Cal State-Northridge. the de
fending national champion, will
be participating, as will UC-
Berkeley, the winner of the
California Invitational over na
tionally ranked Oregon. UC-
Santa Barbara and Cal-Poly San
Luis Obisbo.
