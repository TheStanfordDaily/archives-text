# A 						statement from the editor
## An explanation of Friday's hoax 
### 
On Friday, the Stanford commun
ity and The Stanford Daily were the
victims of a cruel and morbid hoax
when seven students here planted a
fallacious photo and caption in the
upper left hand corner of the front
page of the Daily.
The caption under the photo of
seven men posed with bowling balls
and trophies read as follows:
Tragedy Strikes
Bowling Team
The members of the Stanford
Bowling Team pictured above died
in a plane crash last night at 11:42
PM (PST). They were en route to the
National Championships to be held
tomorrow in Terra (sic) Haute, In
diana. Details in Monday's Daily.
The seven individuals pictured
were not members of the bowling
team, nor was the bowling team
scheduled to participate in any
tournament over the weekend.
The sfeven individuals were in
itiates into the Hammer and Coffin
Society, the publisher of the Stan
ford. Chaparral. To become mem
bers of the society, persons are re
quired to perform a stunt or hoax
that affects the entire community.
This, they most certainly
achieved. Within minutes after the
issue hit the campus, the Daily and
various University offices were de
luged with phone calls from dozens
of students, faculty and staff expres
sing grief, anger and outrage at the
hoax. Predictably and understanda
bly, the Daily was thought by many
to be the perpetrator of the hoax.
To my knowledge, no one on the
staff of the Daily had any prior
knowledge of the planned hoax.
Another picture, one of Environ
ment Week activities in White
Plaza, was planned to go in the
space the Hammer and Coffin in
itiates placed their photo.
The switch was made at approxi
mately 5 a.m. on Friday, just 15 mi
nutes after I delivered intact the
page flats to our printer, Nowels
Publications, in Menlo Park.
According to Nowels employees,
Jim Gable, one of the seven indi
viduals in the photo, presented him
self to employees at the printer as a
Daily staff member who, under my
direction, was making a last-minufe
change on the front page. The
employees, somewhat naively, ac
cepted the man's explanation and
1 allowed the photo switch to be
made.

Where the photo was processed
and where the caption was typeset
has not been disclosed. Apparently,
the initiates had prepared several
photos and captions of different
sizes before Gable went to the
printer to make the switch.
After the picture was replaced,
the newspaper was then printed and
distributed on campus as usual.
As soon as the hoax was disco
vered, I immediately ordered all
remaining copies of the newspaper
to be retrieved so that as few people
as possible would be affected by the
prank.
The Daily has taken steps with its
printer to ensure that unauthorized
tampering with the newspaper will
never again take place. No such pol
icy has previously been necessary
because neither the Daily nor Now
els Publications has ever had reason
to suspect, with the exception of Big
Game Week, that any individual or
group would attempt to interfere
with the business activities of the
Daily.
The Daily has also been in contact
with the Dean of Student Affairs
Office and the President's Office
regarding the incident. Both offices
have assured us that they consider
the act to be a serious offense.
In the Daily's view, the serious
ness of the act and the harm it in
flicted upon the community is four
fold. First, and foremost, the
thoughtless prank brought agony to
countless members of the commun
ity. Some believed for hours, that a
friend pictured or a friend on the
actual bowling team had been kil
led.
Numerous reports of students
and staff seen and heard in tears
after learning of the "accident"
have come to our attention. Many
persons called or stopped by the
Daily office to confirm the reported
accident.
Statements of apology to the
community from the seven indi
viduals have reflected upon the
community's inability to see
through the "subtlety" of the prank.
They allege that were the public less
trusting o f the press, this "misun
derstanding" would not have taken
place. On the contrary, the com
munity's faith in reports in the Daily
has been built through years of de
dicated and honest service to this
community.
Dean of Student Affairs James
Lyons awoke me minutes after se
eing the issue to ask for details of the

accident. He, as the seven persons
would have us all believe, was not
alert enough to catch the subtlety of
the "humor" in the hoax, and was
simply concerned with the task at
hand of preparing to inform seven
students' families of their sons'
deaths. His experience with the
Daily led him to believe the report,
as did many community members.
Second, because of the act, the
Daily has suffered irreparable dam
age to its credibility and reputation
in the community. Can anyone,
without a doubt, believe today's
headline about the death of Tito?
Has someone else slipped some
thing past us? For some time, the
Daily will now have to hope the
community believes what it reads in
these pages. As always, we will do

our best to make the articles in each
issue as accurate and fair as we can,
but the community's faith in this
newspaper has been shaken by this
incident.
This is not only an unfortunate
occurrence for the Daily, but it is
unfortunate for our readers, many
of whom rely on the Daily each
weekday morning for their campus,
state, national and international
news. It is in the interests of this
community to see that the Daily is in

no way tampered with or defaced.
In my opinion, you. our readers,
have been most harmed by this
prank.
Third, the Daily is a private in
stitution producing a product of
value fo readers and advertisers. Ir
responsible tampering with private
property and "interfering with the
legitimate business practices of an
organization, is an act we find rep
rehensible and far too serious to let
pass without comment and action
against the individuals involved.
Fourth, the Daily has suffered
substantial financial harm through
this irresponsible act. Typesetting
and printing charges for the issue
amounted to more than $2000. In
my mind, the issue that appeared on
campus was not the issue of the

Daily we had intended to publish.
Therefore, these charges a fi
nancial burden the Daily may have
to bear because of the hoax. In addi
tion, the Daily's advertisers, with
out whom there is no newspaper,
contracted with us to have their ad
vertisement printed in 15,000
copies of the untampered-with
Stanford Daily. In my mind, that
contract has been broken, and we
will be working with advertisers in


The above photo was the one placed in Friday's Daily by seven
initiates of the Hammer and Coffin Society. They are, from left to
right: (front row), junior David Sahlin; junior David Mandelkern;
and sophomore DougSteiner; (back row), junior Jim Gable; senior
Rob Holbrook; sophomore Dave Lyons; and senior Steve Adolph.
the next several weeks to ensure
that they are satisfied with the ser
vice we are providing.
Here again, the Daily faces finan
cial harm through the actions of the
seven students. I hold those indi
viduals personally responsible for
their actions, and 1 am determined
that the Daily not suffer financially
because of this hoax.
1 also hold the Hammer and Cof
fin Society and the Chaparral re
sponsible for the actions of those
individuals belonging to the organi
zations. Just as University resi
dences and organizations are held
responsible for the actions of their
members, so too should these
groups.
Finally, I wish to make it clear to
the community that the Daily will be
consulting with its attorneys about
this incident. I view this prank as a
serious matter. Four times in the re
cent past, individuals or groups have
inserted leaflets into the Daily with
out paying for the advertising be
nefit thereby received. One other
time, students here, angered by an
investigatory article concerning al
leged illegal activities, destroyed
several hundred copies of the Daily.
The University administration

has hereto considered these acts to
be serious, but not serious enough
to warrant official action. Through
this indifference, the door has been
left open for the kind of antic seen
Friday. For the protection of the
community's interest and the Daily,
we will file an official complaint
with the University, in hopes that
the students and organizations in
volved will be made accountable for
their actions and punished accord
ingly under the University's Fun
damental Standard.
The belief that this newspaper is
fair game for pranks, personal-ven
dettas and political use is one I in
tend to eliminate in this community.
Such an attitude is clearly harmful
to the entire community.
In closing, 1 am deeply sorry that
many persons were emotionally dis
traught because of the morbid hoax
of a few insensitive individuals. It
will be of little satisfaction to those
harmed by the act, but of great be
nefit to the many who will be pro
tected from such antics in the future,
to know that the Daily intends to
make clcar that this type of behavior
is completely unacceptable and will
be dealt with seriously and'to the
fullest extent.
