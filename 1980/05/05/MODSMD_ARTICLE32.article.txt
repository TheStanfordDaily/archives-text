# Cal crushes Card trackmen
## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
As expected, the University of California de
feated Stanford 1 13-41 in a men's ifual track meet
run Saturday at Berkeley, but Cardinal coach
Johnson expressed satisfaction with his
team's effort.
"Our best people did their best jobs," Johnson
remarked, adding, "the kids are doing one heck of
a job. I don't look at the boxscore so much. How
well they are competing is the criteria I use to
e\aluatc their performances."
Individually, the Cards were led by Gordon
Banks as he set a personal record in the 200-meter
dash. Banks sprinted to a 20.7 timing, breaking his
previous mark by a tenth of a second.
Concerning the race Banks commented, "I ran
really well the week before. 1 did a lot of overcondi
tioning at the beginning of the season, such as
running 400s. 1 was also working on my speed last
week."
He also expects to lower that mark in the future.
"1 haven't peaked yet." he remarked.
A Ithough Banks, who also played on the football
team here, wasn't selected in the NFL draft held
last week, he has received invitations by some clubs
to try out as a free agent. "Now that the draft is
over it's more comfortable. There isn't the high
pressure to make a decision right away," the senior
noted
Other bright spots for Stanford in the meet in
cluded John Schaer's 3:50.2 first place finish in the
1 SOU meters. Bill Haldeman's 9:00.2 victory in the
3000-meter steeplechase, and Rick Buss' winning
toss of 217-feet-5 in the hammer throw.
Darrin Nelson ran to second place in a tight

100-meter race, as Cal's Derek Robinson passed
him up to tie the meet record in 10.4. Nelson
finished in 10.5.
The Cardinals also fared well in the relay races.
The 400-meters was a close matchup, as both
squads were marked at 40.6. Cal won at the tape,
however.
Stanford's foursome of Kevin Jones, Robert
Maiocco, Garry Shumway and Banks took the
1600-meter relay in 3:12.4.
Cal collected points with first, second and third
place sweeps in the shot put, high jump, 400-meter
hurdles, pole vault and the 5000 meters. Johnson
pointed out that Stanford lacked the depth to give
Cal a strong challenge in these areas.
Said the coach, "We have essentially the same
team as last year. The reality is that we had to stand
pat while the other schools were bringing in more
people. So, if you frame it up properly, the team is
doing a good job."
The Bears took first and second in the 110-meter
hurdles as well, led by Larry Cowling who set the
only meet record of the day with a 13.K timing. The
previous record was 13.9.
The meet was the 86th confrontation of the'
schools, with Cal now leading the series 44-40. The
Bears improved their record to 7-1 in dual meet
competition, while Stanford holds a 4-4 slate.
Asked if he expected his team to rebound from
the loss. Johnson replied, "These guys know what's
going on. If a runner sees his objective time, he
knows if he's doing the job he can do." The track
director also mentioned that, "recruiting is going
exceptionally well. We should reach parity with the
league in a couple of years."
The Cards next meet is the West Coast Relays to
be held at Fresno State next Saturday.
