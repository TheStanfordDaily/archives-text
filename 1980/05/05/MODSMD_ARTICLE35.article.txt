Iran, Cuba discuss anti-U.S. summit
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr met yesterday
with Cuban officials to consider a conference of non
aligned nations to protest the U.S. attempt to rescue the 53
American hostages, Tehran Radio said. It said the bodies of
the U.S. commandos killed in the aborted mission may be
turned over to the Swiss Embassy tomorrow or Wednesday.
But a later broadcast quoted Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh as saying the bodies will be handed over to
Greek Catholic Archbishop Hilarion Capudji, who also has
taken part in the arrangements, instead of the Swiss Em
bassy. A Bani-Sadr adviser explained the apparent change
in plans by saying it was to "maintain the religious character
of the transfer," Tehran radio said.
The late report said Archbishop Capudji would deliver
the bodies to authorities at the Vatican in Rome to be
returned to relatives in the United States.
The American hostages began their seventh month in
captivity yesterday. The Islamic militants who seized the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4 said they had moved an
unspecified number of captives to two more Iranian towns.
Arak and Mahallat, about 155 miles southwest of Tehran.
Israel debates West Bank security
JERUSALEM — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday debated
new tough security measures for Israeli-occupied territories
as thousands of mourners attended military funerals for two
of five Jewish settlers killed in a West Bank ambush.
" In front of your open grave, we renew our pledge not to
give up the land of our forefathers," said Energy Minister
Yitzhak Modai, who represented the government at the
funeral services for two 21-year-olds killed in the attack,
blamed on Arabs, Friday night in the occupied city of Heb
ron.
A Cabinet statement said the secret Ministerial Defense
Committee would rule on "the imposition of law, order and
peace . . . and the maintenance of normal living conditions"
in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
But the Cabinet also authorized Israeli negotiators to
resume talks with Egyptian officials "on the basis of

guidelines previously laid down." The talks were designed
to lead to Palestinian autonomy.
U.S. shuts down Havana visa office
The United States closed its visa office in Havana yester
day in response to an earlier bloody brawl between pro-
Castro Cubans and those seeking to leave the country. The
action left nearly 380 visa-seeking Cubans stranded inside
the old American embassy.
The Cuban government demanded yesterday that all the
men who fled into the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana
two days ago during a violent melee be handed over without
conditions.
The Cuban demand creates an apparent deadlock in the
U.S.-Cuban negotiations on the fate of the 386 Cubans
jammed into the U.S. mission and sets the stage for pro
longed talks that are likely to involve other, broader issues
between Havana and Washington.
"The present situation with its lack of security or protec
tion for people who have legitimate business with us is
intolerable and dangerous." said State Department
spokeswoman Anita Stockman. "The United States cannot
continue to operate these programs without the guarantees
and cooperation of Cuban authorities."
U.S. expels four Libyan diplomats
WASHINGTON — The United States has ordered four
more members of Libya's diplomatic mission here to leave
the country in apparent connection with a widespread Li
byan campaign to wipe out opponents of Col. Muammar
Khadafy living in exile.
A State Department spokeswoman said Saturday night
that Nuri Ahmed Swedan, Ali Ramram. Mohammed
Gamudi and Abdulla Zbedi were told Friday that they had
72 hours to leave the country.
The United States is also recalling the skeleton staff at the
U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.
<On April 17 U.S. officials disclosed that two Libyan
diplomats had been expelled from Washington earlier in the
month for distributing literature calling for the "liquida
tion" of Khadafy's opponents.

Pope bars priests from public office
WASHINGTON — Pope John Paul II has issued a direc
tive barring all Roman Catholic priests from serving in
public office, ranking U.S. Catholic sources confirmed yes
terday.
Most immediately affected here is Rep. Robert Drinan
(D-Mass.). the only Roman Catholic cleric in Congress.
Drinan was planning to seek election to his sixth term in
Congress in November and is affected by a worldwide papal

decision, said Jerome Grossman, chairman of the Commit
tee to Re-Elect Robert Drinan and a Democratic National
Committeeman for Massachusetts. Grossman said Drinan
"is not going to run."

Iran, Cuba discuss anti-U.S. summit
Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr met yesterday
with Cuban officials to consider a conference of non
aligned nations to protest the U.S. attempt to rescue the 53
American hostages, Tehran Radio said. It said the bodies of
the U.S. commandos killed in the aborted mission may be
turned over to the Swiss Embassy tomorrow or Wednesday.
But a later broadcast quoted Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh as saying the bodies will be handed over to
Greek Catholic Archbishop Hilarion Capudji, who also has
taken part in the arrangements, instead of the Swiss Em
bassy. A Bani-Sadr adviser explained the apparent change
in plans by saying it was to "maintain the religious character
of the transfer," Tehran radio said.
The late report said Archbishop Capudji would deliver
the bodies to authorities at the Vatican in Rome to be
returned to relatives in the United States.
The American hostages began their seventh month in
captivity yesterday. The Islamic militants who seized the
U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4 said they had moved an
unspecified number of captives to two more Iranian towns.

Israel debates West Bank security
JERUSALEM — The Israeli Cabinet yesterday debated
new tough security measures for Israeli-occupied territories
as thousands of mourners attended military funerals for two
of five Jewish settlers killed in a West Bank ambush.
" In front of your open grave, we renew our pledge not to
give up the land of our forefathers," said Energy Minister
Yitzhak Modai, who represented the government at the
funeral services for two 21-year-olds killed in the attack,
blamed on Arabs, Friday night in the occupied city of Heb
ron.
A Cabinet statement said the secret Ministerial Defense
Committee would rule on "the imposition of law, order and
peace . . . and the maintenance of normal living conditions"
in the occupied West Bank of the Jordan River.
But the Cabinet also authorized Israeli negotiators to
resume talks with Egyptian officials "on the basis of

guidelines previously laid down." The talks were designed
to lead to Palestinian autonomy.
U.S. shuts down Havana visa office
The United States closed its visa office in Havana yester
day in response to an earlier bloody brawl between pro-
Castro Cubans and those seeking to leave the country. The
action left nearly 380 visa-seeking Cubans stranded inside
the old American embassy.
The Cuban government demanded yesterday that all the
men who fled into the U.S. diplomatic mission in Havana
two days ago during a violent melee be handed over without
conditions.
The Cuban demand creates an apparent deadlock in the
U.S.-Cuban negotiations on the fate of the 386 Cubans
jammed into the U.S. mission and sets the stage for pro
longed talks that are likely to involve other, broader issues
between Havana and Washington.
"The present situation with its lack of security or protec
tion for people who have legitimate business with us is
intolerable and dangerous." said State Department
spokeswoman Anita Stockman. "The United States cannot
continue to operate these programs without the guarantees
and cooperation of Cuban authorities."
U.S. expels four Libyan diplomats
WASHINGTON — The United States has ordered four

A State Department spokeswoman said Saturday night
that Nuri Ahmed Swedan, Ali Ramram. Mohammed
Gamudi and Abdulla Zbedi were told Friday that they had
