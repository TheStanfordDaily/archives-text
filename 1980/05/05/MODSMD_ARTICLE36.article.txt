# Supreme Court justice hears Law School moot court case
## 
### Todd Pickett Staff Writer 
"Oyez. oyez, oyez. The Supreme Court of the United
States if now in session," announced the bailiff as the expec
tant crowd rose to its feet. Wearing the traditional dark robe
of judicial authority. Supreme Courte Justice Byron White,
accompanied by two fellow judges, seated himself at a table,
between the desks of the opposing attorneys.
As Justice White motioned for the respondents to com
mence, a sharply dressed and quietly confident young
woman approached the podium, opened her notebook, and
began.
"Your honor ..."
Though it had all the drama and excitement of a session of
America's highest judicial power, the staged courtroom
scene was not a real meeting of the Supreme Court. Nor
were the counsel actual practicing attorneys, but second
and third-year law students competing in the finals of the
28th Annual Kirkwood Moot Court Competition held in
kresge Auditorium Friday afternoon.
Two teams of two members each brought to a climax four
months of preparation and competition with oral arguments
and previously submitted briefs on a fictitious court case.
In this instance, the case involved a charge by a
homosexual school teacher that his First Ammendment
rights were infringed upon when he was dismissed from
teaching after advocating that students be exposed to gay
people.
In addition to Justice White, U.S. Court of Appeal Judge
Patricia Wald and Robert Utter of the Supreme Court of
Washington listened to the appeals of the final four par
ticipants.
After over an hour of presentations by the teams, the
panel emerged, following a brief period of deliberation, to
recognize the team of John Phillips and Marilyn Tesauro as
the overall winners in a "close" contest against the team of
Ron Beck and John Roos. Phillips and Tesauro were also
awarded the prize for the best written brief, while Tesauro
was acknowledged as the competition's finest oral advo
cate.

Not to be confused with a mock trial in which witnesses
testify, a moot court consists of strictly legal argument
among student lawyers before a panel of judges. Each one
of the 24 teams which entered the competition was asked to
prepare a written brief, not exceeding 50 pages, advocating
one side of the case. In the first two rounds of the five-round
tournament, participants argued both sides of the legal
question.
In the final round, each team was allowed 30 minutes,
equally divided between the two team members, to present
one side of the case before the panel. The panel was free to
question the speakers in order to test their knowledge of the
issue and their ability to think and respond quickly. Justices
White, Utter and Wald put the student lawyers to the test
Friday, bombarding them with numerous questions which
often forced the counsel members to alter their presenta
tion in both content and length.
"A competitor must anticipate every possible question
that might be asked, and then some," commented law stu
dent Jim Wagstaffe.
The case dealt with an Oklahoma high school biology
teacher, David Briggs, who said he was a homosexual dur
ing a PTA-sponsored panel discussion on sex education.
Following a barrage of negative publicity and angry let
ters directed at Briggs, he was dismissed from his position
on the grounds that his influence might encourage
homosexuality among the students. This was in accordance
with an Oklahoma statute that prohibits public homosexual
conduct, defining it as "advocating, soliciting, imposing,
encouraging, and promoting public or private homosexual
activity."
The two legal questions addressed were whether the fed
eral courts had jurisdiction in this case, and if so, whether
Briggs' dismissal was a violation of his First Amendment
rights to free speech.
The case was created solely as a way to evaluate the
abilities of the participants. No legal decision was rendered
by the justices.
