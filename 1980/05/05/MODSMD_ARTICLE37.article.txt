In Friday's Daily, an article concerning the effect of the
government's freeze of Iranian assets in this country on
Iranian students here contained several factual errors.
Lee Ziegler had no knowledge of students here being
sponsored by the Iranian Consulate, nor did he state that he
is seeking assistance from the U.S. Treasury Department
»regarding financial support for Iranian students. In fact, it is
John Gardner of the Controller's Office who is seeking
information regarding assistance of the U.S. Treasury De
partment in placing a claim against frozen Iranian assets for
payment of Iranian Consulate and embassy bills, should this
become necessary.
In addition, the $18,000 check from Isfahan Technical
University is intended to pay only some of the expenses, and

not tuition, of the 22 students it is sponsoring here.
Finally, Mary Clark has not been designated to handle
diplomatic affairs for the Iranian students. The Algerian
Embassy in Washington, D.C., has been designated to
handle such affairs, including passport, not visa, extensions
for the students.
The Daily regrets the errors in the story.
