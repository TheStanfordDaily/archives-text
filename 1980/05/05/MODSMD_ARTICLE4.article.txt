The Third World Coalition has de
cided not to seek a $1 fee assessment
for next year because members are
concerned with its effect on University
support for minority activities.
The decision was made at a meeting
Friday with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
According to Hope Nakamura of the
Asian American Student Association
(AASA), "The reasoning is that we
wanted to have better control of the
repercussions of having a fee assess
ment."
The Office of Student Affairs had
suggested that the coalition seek a stu

the assessment would theoretically give
the groups permanent funding at the
beginning of the year so that they

would not have to scramble around for
small amounts from various sources
during the year. However, members of
the coalition, especially MEChA, ex
pressed doubts about the actual out
come and questioned the Office of Stu
dent Affairs' intentions.
"The group is not clear on the Uni
versity commitment to minority affairs
and on whether the fee assessment is a
supplement or a replacement of pre
sent funding," said Valentin Hernan
dez of MEChA.
In the past, the minority groups have
been supported by about 25 academic
departments and University offices
such as the Academic Information
Center.
Nakamura said that the coalition was
concerned particularly about support
from the University after the next
