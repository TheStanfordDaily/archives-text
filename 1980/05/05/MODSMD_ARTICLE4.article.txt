# Assessment for ethnic coalition not on ballot
## 
### Rose Chan Staff Writer 
The Third World Coalition has de
cided not to seek a $1 fee assessment
for next year because members are
concerned with its effect on University
support for minority activities.
The decision was made at a meeting
Friday with Dean of Student Affairs
James Lyons.
According to Hope Nakamura of the
Asian American Student Association
(AASA), "The reasoning is that we
wanted to have better control of the
repercussions of having a fee assess
ment."
The Office of Student Affairs had
suggested that the coalition seek a stu
dent fee assessment. Nakamura said
the assessment would theoretically give
the groups permanent funding at the
beginning of the year so that they

would not have to scramble around for
small amounts from various sources
during the year. However, members of
the coalition, especially MEChA, ex
pressed doubts about the actual out
come and questioned the Office of Stu
dent Affairs' intentions.
"The group is not clear on the Uni
versity commitment to minority affairs
and on whether the fee assessment is a
supplement or a replacement of pre
sent funding," said Valentin Hernan
dez of MEChA.
In the past, the minority groups have
been supported by about 25 academic
departments and University offices
such as the Academic Information
Center.
Nakamura said that the coalition was
concerned particularly about support
from the University after the next
discuss the matter and agreements that
are not being carried out.
The coalition was formed last year by
four minority groups on campus —
MEChA. AASA. BSU and SAIO —
and is associated with the Bay Area
Minority Network. Andy Vialobos
stressed that the coalition was not
Lyons' idea and did not originate be
cause of the fee assessment. He said the
coalition was the product of a confer
ence in Berkeley last year.
Hernandez said the group was
formed out of need to unite the Third
World organizations on campus and
•was set up specifically to address the
effect of the draft on the Third World
people.
The only fee assessment which will
be on tomorrow's ballot will be for the
Speakers' Bureaj.l, $aid ASSU Elec
tions Commissioner Doug Mitchell.
Mitchell said 49 undergraduates and
11 graduates will be vying for the 10
undergraduate and 10 graduate posi
tions on the senate. Five candidates will
also compete for the three positions on
the Student Conduct Legislative Coun
cil.
Frolic on the Farm and BARB, slates
for Senior Class Presidents, will face
each other in the Senior Class run-off
election.
The Frolic on the Farm slate includes
Bill Kemmeries, Mary Ellen Riley, Ina
Coleman and Jaime Halper. BARB
group members are Jeff Bell, Aleetf
Zimberoff, Renee Richards and Mark
Breier.
Mitchell said that because of difficul
ties with the format of the last ASSU
election ballot, tomorrow's ballot will
look very different. The ballot will be
Bxll inches and names of the can
didates will be printed on the front of
the sheet to avoid the confusion of two
separate pieces of paper.
Voting places and times will be basi
cally the same. However, the polling
table at Green Library will be replaced
by one on the Row in front of Ameri
can Studies, said Mitchell. Also, to take
some strain off the Post Office location,
there will also be a table in front of
Meyer Library from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

school year, because the budget has al
ready set aside funding for the coming
year,
"There's supposedly a base amount
allotted for minority programs and the
rest is made up with nickel and dim
ing," said Odell Mays of the Black Stu
dent Union. "The fee assessment
would take care of deficits that need to
be made up." Mays was more* optimis
tic than other coalition members inter-,
viewed. '*
" From what Dean Lyons said, he feft

the impression with me that the office is
supportive and will continue to be sup
portive of minority affairs," Mays said.
"This means that the funding allotted,
at least for next year, will be guaran
teed."
Mays also said that Lyons will re
spond to a letter written to him by the
Third World Coalition, in order to reaf
firm his commitment to minority con
cerns.
Members of MEChA said they plan
to meet with both Thorn Massey of the
Office of Student Affairs and Lyons to
