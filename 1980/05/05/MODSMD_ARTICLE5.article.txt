# County law may call for solar in new dorm
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
The Santa Clara County Board of
Supervisors will vote tonight on a solar
ordinance that will affect future resi
dential construction at Stanford if pas
sed.
The ordinance requires that all new
homes in unincorporated areas of the
county install solar systems as the main
source of hot water heating. In addi
tion, all existing residences will have to
be outfitted with solar hot water sys
tems when resold.
This is the third in a packet of four
proposed solar ordinances which have
come before the Board of Supervisors
in the last few months. Two of the mea
sures, one providing for energy audits
of pre-1975 homes and one defining
solar access rights for installed residen
tial collectors, have already been pas
sed.
The fourth ordinance, which would
ban the use of natural gas in heating
residential swimming pools, will be
considered in late May or early June.
All four of the ordinances are ac
companied by exemptions relating to
cost-effectiveness or health and safety
standards.
If passed tonight, the solar water
heating ordinance will be in effect prior
to the construction of the new student
dorm here and the Willow Road de
velopment.

Whether the solar ordinance would
apply to the new dorm depends on "the
way the county defines residential resi
dence," said Jonathan Raab of Stan
ford Energy Action, a student group
concerned with University energy
plans.
Raab added that he will request that
the question of definition be resolved
at tonight's meeting.
Robert Nerrie, project manager for
the new dorm, said it will be outfitted
for solar water heating regardless of the
county's decision.
"We are conducting necessary
economic and practical studies to de
termine at what point it will be feasible
and desirable to install a solar system,"
Nerrie said.
Though economic factors may pre
vent the initial installation of a system,
Nerrie said a solar system would be
designed that could be easily installed
when appropriate.
The specific guidelines which the
county Building Inspection Depart
ment will use to determine the cost
effectiveness of a solar system in a
given residence have not yet been de
fined.
In the case of the new dorm here,
students in SEA conducted an inde
pendent study and concluded that a
solar water heating system would pay
for itself in five years. They estimate
installation cost at $720,000.
