## Accepts U.S. military personnel Oman cut off from Arabs 
### Doyle McManus The Los Angeles Times 
MUSCAT. Oman — The Sul
tanate of Oman, the United
States' new military ally on the
Persian Gulf, has long been the
odd-man-out of the Arab world.
It is the only country on the
Arabian Peninsula that is ready
to accept U.S. military person
nel, the only one that has sup
ported Egypt in its effort to make
peace with Israel, the only one
with virtually no direct relations
with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
All this should make the
Kansas-size desert sultanate an
ideal partner in the Carter ad
ministration's drive to reassert
American power around the
Middle East's oil fields. But it
also makes the sultan, 39-year
old Kaboos Ibn Said, slightly
nervous.
Ironically, the United States is
negotiating a military pact with
Kaboos at the precise moment
when his country is moving
closer to its Arab cousins — and
that may create tensions and
problems, in the long run, for
both the sultan and his American
friends.
"Oman is an island." a West
ern diplomat said. "It's been cut

off from the rest of the Arab
world for a long time. It's always
looked out to sea, to India and
Africa, where its trading
partners were, not back across
the desert. But this is changing.
Now you get the feeling they
think of themselves as part of the
gulf."
Changes image
The change in Oman's self
image — and its alignment —
appears to be a natural product
of history, economics and, like
most changes in this part of the
world, oil.
In the 18th century, the
Om .lis were the Indian Ocean's
greatest traders, with colonies in
Pakistan and Zanzibar and En
glish sea captains in their
employ. The sheiks of the Ara
bian desert to their north were
little more than impoverished
nomads.
Hie Omanis even practiced a
separate kind of Islam. They are
still the main remaining adher
ants of the Ibadhi sect, a group
some Arabists describe as "the
Quakers of Islam," for they have
virtually no clergy.
Power shifts
With the discovery of oil in
Saudi Arabia and the gulf states,
the balance of power changed.
Now Oman, which produces
only 300,000 barrels of oil a day
(compared with Saudi Arabia's
9.5 million), is the poor cousin.
The United Arab Emirates up
the coast are attracting many
Omani workers with the promise
of higher wages; as many as
12,000 Omanis serve in the
UAE army, whose basic pay of
$900 a month is three times the
rate at home, according to the
British officers who run the sul
tan's armed forces.
The emirates have financed
the construction of new roads ac
ross the desert that makes it
easier for Omanis to drive the
300 miles from Muscat to Abu
Dhabi. And Abu Dhabi televi
sion reaches most of north
Oman, giving viewers a choice
between hearing the news from
an Omani Walter Cronkite wear
ing a bright blue turban or his
Abu Dhabi counterpart in a spot
less white kaffiyeh.

But compared with backward
Oman, where the sultan reigns
with no parliament or other con
sultative body and where some
rural areas functioned until re
cently without currency, the emi
rates are cosmopolitan and mod
ern. They are full of Western
business and Western goods.
And they are full of Palestinians,
the educated refugees who have
become the doctors, engineers,
technicians and teachers of the
oil states.
Sultan Kaboos has kept all but
a handful of Palestinians out of
Oman, so, unlike his neighbors,
he does not have to be sensitive
to the presence of a pro-PLO
minority. But as more and more
Omanis travel, work and study in
the emirates and other Arab
countries, they are becoming
more aware of Palestinian de
mands, which often dominate
the politics of the Arab world.
"This is my only complaint
about the sultan," said an Omani
businessman, who admitted that
he might be voicing a minority
viewpoint. "He is ignoring the
Palestinain cause, which is the
cause of all the Arabs. We should
not be so different. Why do we
support Camp David, when this
is like supporting Israel?"
In fact, diplomats said, there
are signs that the sultan may
quietly withdraw his support for
the Camp David accord. When
the pact was signed, Oman went
along with it as "a first step" to
ward a comprehensive settle
ment that would include the
Palestinians. But if the current
Egyptian-Israeli talks on Pales
tinian autonomy fail, Oman may
find it both opportune and
necessary to rejoin the rest of the
Arab world in rejecting Camp
David.
Such a move would have the
added advantage of bringing the
sultanate back in line with its
most important Arab ally, Saudi
Arabia. Despite the two coun
tries' differences on the question
of Camp David, Saudi Arabia
still sends Kaboos what a former
Omani official called "the odd
half-million in aid now and
then," and has sent the sultan's
air force a U.S.-made C-130
transport complete with crew.

Persian Gulf, has long been the
odd-man-out of the Arab world.
It is the only country on the
Arabian Peninsula that is ready
to accept U.S. military person
nel, the only one that has sup
ported Egypt in its effort to make
peace with Israel, the only one
with virtually no direct relations
with the Palestine Liberation
Organization.
All this should make the
Kansas-size desert sultanate an
ideal partner in the Carter ad
ministration's drive to reassert
American power around the
Middle East's oil fields. But it
also makes the sultan, 39-year
old Kaboos Ibn Said, slightly
nervous.
Ironically, the United States is
negotiating a military pact with
Kaboos at the precise moment
when his country is moving
closer to its Arab cousins — and
that may create tensions and
problems, in the long run, for
both the sultan and his American
friends.
"Oman is an island." a West
ern diplomat said. "It's been cut

off from the rest of the Arab
world for a long time. It's always
looked out to sea, to India and
Africa, where its trading
partners were, not back across
the desert. But this is changing.
Now you get the feeling they
think of themselves as part of the
gulf."
Changes image
The change in Oman's self
image — and its alignment —
appears to be a natural product
of history, economics and, like
most changes in this part of the
world, oil.
In the 18th century, the
Om .lis were the Indian Ocean's
greatest traders, with colonies in
Pakistan and Zanzibar and En
glish sea captains in their
employ. The sheiks of the Ara
bian desert to their north were
little more than impoverished
nomads.
Hie Omanis even practiced a
separate kind of Islam. They are
still the main remaining adher
ants of the Ibadhi sect, a group
some Arabists describe as "the
Quakers of Islam," for they have
virtually no clergy.
Power shifts
With the discovery of oil in
Saudi Arabia and the gulf states,
the balance of power changed.
Now Oman, which produces
only 300,000 barrels of oil a day
(compared with Saudi Arabia's
9.5 million), is the poor cousin.
The United Arab Emirates up
the coast are attracting many
Omani workers with the promise
of higher wages; as many as
12,000 Omanis serve in the
UAE army, whose basic pay of
$900 a month is three times the
rate at home, according to the
British officers who run the sul
tan's armed forces.
The emirates have financed
the construction of new roads ac
ross the desert that makes it
easier for Omanis to drive the
300 miles from Muscat to Abu
Dhabi. And Abu Dhabi televi
sion reaches most of north
Oman, giving viewers a choice
between hearing the news from
an Omani Walter Cronkite wear
ing a bright blue turban or his
Abu Dhabi counterpart in a spot
less white kaffiyeh.

But compared with backward
Oman, where the sultan reigns
with no parliament or other con
sultative body and where some
rural areas functioned until re
cently without currency, the emi
rates are cosmopolitan and mod
ern. They are full of Western
business and Western goods.
And they are full of Palestinians,
the educated refugees who have
become the doctors, engineers,
technicians and teachers of the
oil states.
Sultan Kaboos has kept all but
a handful of Palestinians out of
Oman, so, unlike his neighbors,
he does not have to be sensitive
to the presence of a pro-PLO
minority. But as more and more
Omanis travel, work and study in
the emirates and other Arab
countries, they are becoming
more aware of Palestinian de
mands, which often dominate
the politics of the Arab world.
"This is my only complaint
about the sultan," said an Omani
businessman, who admitted that
he might be voicing a minority
viewpoint. "He is ignoring the
Palestinain cause, which is the
cause of all the Arabs. We should
not be so different. Why do we
support Camp David, when this
is like supporting Israel?"
In fact, diplomats said, there
are signs that the sultan may
quietly withdraw his support for
the Camp David accord. When
the pact was signed, Oman went
along with it as "a first step" to
ward a comprehensive settle
ment that would include the
Palestinians. But if the current
Egyptian-Israeli talks on Pales
tinian autonomy fail, Oman may
find it both opportune and
necessary to rejoin the rest of the
Arab world in rejecting Camp
David.
Such a move would have the
added advantage of bringing the
sultanate back in line with its
most important Arab ally, Saudi
Arabia. Despite the two coun
tries' differences on the question
of Camp David, Saudi Arabia
still sends Kaboos what a former
Omani official called "the odd
half-million in aid now and
then," and has sent the sultan's
air force a U.S.-made C-130
transport complete with crew.
