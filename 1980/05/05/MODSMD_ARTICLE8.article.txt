# Haiti burns its future along with its forests

PORT-AU-PRINCE. Haiti
— What used to be a lush Carib
bean country has been stripped
of its foliage. The Haitians are
literally burning their future.
Forests have been felled for
charcoal, and now even that is
nothing but spindly black sticks.
The hills around Gonaives are
bare of all but thornbushes. the
topsoil long ago carried away by
erosion that foliage once held in
check.
All over Haiti, once known as
the "Pearl of the Antilles." de
struction of the land is going on
at an ever-accelerating pace.
Before the slave uprising that
freed this land from its French
masters in 1804. Haiti accounted
for 40 percent of France's
foreign trade. A small country
the size of Maryland, it had great
plantations that produced sugar
cane and a wealth of fruits.
Today the plantations are
gone, broken up by successive
generations into plots of di
minishing size until today the av
erage farm consists of just two
acres and supports four or five
people.

houses are surrounded by rocky.

worn-out holdings where listless
peasants struggle to raise enough
food to keep their hungry chil
dren alive.
There is less land under irriga
tion now than there was two cen
turies ago. And the last of the
forests are being devoured.
Only 10 years ago. 12 percent
of Haiti was still covered by
trees. Since then, a third of those
trees have been destroyed, the
wood used for fuel and the land,
suitable or not. planted in crops
in a desperate attempt to relieve
the pressure caused by growing
numbers of starving people.

"Charcbal provides 85 percent
of Haiti's energy needs, and
while the trees last, hundreds of
thousands of peasants will aug
ment their meager incomes by
making charcoal.
"As the population has
boomed, people have moved
farther and farther up the hill

The state of the land is a sym
bol ot what has happened to

Haiti politically and economi
cally in the last 175 years. Gen
erations of tyrants have
exploited the country and its
people, repressing them and
robbing them.
Haiti, whose people re
member with pride that their
country was the second nation in
the Western Hemisphere to win
independence by fighting for it.
today finds itself in the humiliat
ing position of being the poorest
country in the hemisphere and
one of the poorest on earth.
Since independence, the popu
lation has increased ten-fold. In
this century there has been a
steady decline in rural living
standards and today nearly four
out of five rural Haitians live
below the poverty line.
Poor farming
A recent report by the U.S.
Agency for International De
velopment says the main cause of
Haiti's poverty is low agricul
tural production.
"Haitian agriculture is increas
ingly unable to feed its growing
population and the government
has been forced to import more
and more food to prevent wide
spread suffering." the report
says.
Haiti has almost no natural re
sources. There is a bauxite mine

near Port-Au-Prince. the capi
tal. hut it is close to mined out.
"Even the sea has been fished
out." an observer said.
The country is regularly beset
by drought, floods and hur
ricanes. As drought followed last
year's Hurricane David, the
peasants of the most afflicted
areas migrated to Port-au-Prince
and other towns.
Boat people
Those who could scrape to
gether the money joined the
"boat people" in what has be
come Haiti's most famous export
— human beings.
Immigration is an old safety
valve for Haiti, a way out during
economic disasters or political
repression. For generations Hai
tians have left in waves. There
are probably 100,000 Haitians in
Cuba, thousands more in the
Dominican Republic, which
shares the island of Hispanola
with Haiti. And there are large
and growing exile colonies in
Miami, New York, Mexico,
Paris, Montreal, the Bahamas,
and Caracas, Venezuela.
Great numbers left during the
15 years of dictatorship under
the tyrant Francois (Papa Doc)
Duvalier, who brought death,
torture, repression, voodoo ter
ror and economic stagnation to
Haiti.
Some experts calculate that
during his reign 40.000 people
disappeared. When Duvalier
died in 1972 almost nothing had
been done for the country for 15
years.
A black man, he had broken
up the old administration of
mulattoes, eliminating from
government service the people
who had run the country for gen
erations. Even the few roads,
built by U.S. Marines who oc
cupied Haiti from 191 5 to 1934,
were falling apart.
During the worst years of
Duvalier s regime. Western na
tions that had been providing fi
nancial and technical aid with
drew. After his death, they re
turned.
Today $75 million a year is
being poured into Haiti in aid
from all over the world, one third
of it from the United States.
The U.S. program is aimed

basically at agricultural de
velopments — conservation and
upgrading the land — and public
health and nutrition in rural
areas.
Today Haiti is run by Jean
Claude Duvalier. 28. the son of
Francois Duvalier. Known as
Baby Doc, young Duvalier was
proclaimed president for life the
day after his father died.
"For a time after Jean Claude
took power things improved, but
there has been a deterioration
since last year," said Gregoire
Eugene, leader of the Social
Christian Party. "There has been
a very tense mood since August,

Haiti, whose people re
member with pride that their
country was the second nation in
the Western Hemisphere to win
independence by fighting for it.
today finds itself in the humiliat
ing position of being the poorest
country in the hemisphere and
one of the poorest on earth.
Since independence, the popu
lation has increased ten-fold. In
this century there has been a
steady decline in rural living
standards and today nearly four
out of five rural Haitians live
below the poverty line.
Poor farming
A recent report by the U.S.
Agency for International De
velopment says the main cause of
Haiti's poverty is low agricul
tural production.
"Haitian agriculture is increas
ingly unable to feed its growing
population and the government
has been forced to import more
and more food to prevent wide
spread suffering." the report
says.
Haiti has almost no natural re
sources. There is a bauxite mine

near Port-Au-Prince. the capi
tal. hut it is close to mined out.
"Even the sea has been fished
out." an observer said.
The country is regularly beset
by drought, floods and hur
ricanes. As drought followed last
year's Hurricane David, the
peasants of the most afflicted
areas migrated to Port-au-Prince
and other towns.
Boat people
Those who could scrape to
gether the money joined the
"boat people" in what has be
come Haiti's most famous export
— human beings.
Immigration is an old safety
valve for Haiti, a way out during
economic disasters or political
repression. For generations Hai
tians have left in waves. There
are probably 100,000 Haitians in
Cuba, thousands more in the
Dominican Republic, which
shares the island of Hispanola
with Haiti. And there are large
and growing exile colonies in
Miami, New York, Mexico,
Paris, Montreal, the Bahamas,
and Caracas, Venezuela.
Great numbers left during the
15 years of dictatorship under
the tyrant Francois (Papa Doc)
Duvalier, who brought death,
torture, repression, voodoo ter
ror and economic stagnation to
Haiti.
Some experts calculate that
during his reign 40.000 people
disappeared. When Duvalier
died in 1972 almost nothing had
been done for the country for 15
years.
A black man, he had broken
up the old administration of
mulattoes, eliminating from
government service the people
who had run the country for gen
erations. Even the few roads,
built by U.S. Marines who oc
cupied Haiti from 191 5 to 1934,
were falling apart.
During the worst years of
Duvalier s regime. Western na
tions that had been providing fi
nancial and technical aid with
drew. After his death, they re
turned.
Today $75 million a year is
being poured into Haiti in aid
from all over the world, one third
of it from the United States.
The U.S. program is aimed

basically at agricultural de
velopments — conservation and
upgrading the land — and public
health and nutrition in rural
areas.
Today Haiti is run by Jean
Claude Duvalier. 28. the son of
Francois Duvalier. Known as
Baby Doc, young Duvalier was
proclaimed president for life the
day after his father died.
"For a time after Jean Claude
took power things improved, but
there has been a deterioration
since last year," said Gregoire
Eugene, leader of the Social
Christian Party. "There has been
a very tense mood since August,
when opposition leader Sylvio
Claude was arrested. People who
were powerful under Papa Doc
are coming back into office."
