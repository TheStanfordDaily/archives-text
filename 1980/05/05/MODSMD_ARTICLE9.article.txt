LONDON — Envoys of Kuwait, Jordan and
Syria met yesterday with British officials in a dip
lomatic bid to end the siege at the Iranian Embassy
where Iranian-Arab gunmen are holding about 20
hostages.
The embassy invaders freed one of their captives
yesterday. He was identified as Mustatha Kark
■outi, a 37-year-old Syrian journalist.
Police said later the gunmen were still holding
'about 19 to 20" hostages, but they were unsure of
the exact number. Most of the captives were Ira
nians.
Karkouti emerged from the building at 8:10 p.m.
(12:10 p.m. EDT), his hands elapsed behind his
head. Police placed him on a stretcher and took
him to a waiting ambulance. It was believed Kark
outi was the hostage suffering from a stomach ail
ment and for whom medication was sent into the
embassy earlier in the day.
He was the fifth hostage released since the em
bassy was seized Wednesday. A 23-year-old pre
gnant Iranian woman employee and a Pakistani

who had been visiting the mission were freed
Saturday. An Iranian woman and a sick Briton
were released earlier.
In Tehran. Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh ruled out participation by Iraq and
said "tens of thousands" of unarmed Iranians were
ready to swarm the embassy. He did not elaborate.
Police negotiators, meanwhile, reestablished
contact with the hostage-takers after an 11-hour
break, the longest period without communication
since the siege began Wednesday.
The gunmen, from Iran's oilproducing province
of Khuzestan, which borders on Iraq, are seeking
the release of 91 comrades imprisoned in Iran.
Khuzestan Arabs demand autonomy for their reg
ion from the Islamic revolutionary regime of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
Iran accuses Iraq's ruling Baath Party of stirring
up trouble among the Arabs, who have mounted a
sabotage campaign against oil installations and
public buildings.
