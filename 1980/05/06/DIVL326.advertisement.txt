buperman was talking to a friend
Superman I was cruising over a beach one
day when I noticed Wonderwoman lying
on her back, completely naked, making
very strange body motions Wanting to
investigate this a little more closely I flew
down about a 1000 feet and. sure enough,
it was Wonderwoman in the nude and she
was still making the strange body mo
tions Seeing all this I got very excited and
I finally couldn't control myself. I tore off
my cape, flew down and landed besided
her
Friend What did Wonderwoman say when she
saw you:
Superman Oh. nothing, but you should have
seen the look on the invisible man's face!
