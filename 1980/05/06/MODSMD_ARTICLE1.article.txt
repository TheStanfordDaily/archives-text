# British commandos storm embassy; 19 hostages safe

### 
LONDON — The siege of the Ira
nian Embassy here ended in explo
sions, flames and gunfire last night
when British Army anti-terrorist
commandos stormed the building and
rescued 19 Iranian and British hos
tages.
Britain ordered the assault after the
ethnic Arab Iranians holding the em
bassy killed two hostages. The British
killed three and captured two of the
gunmen, who had seized the embassy
and a total of 26 hostages last Wednes
day. Earlier, the gilnmen had freed five
hostages.
At least two explosions rocked the
elegant five-story building as the Spe
cial Air Services commandos charged
in. A fire followed but it was soon ex
tinguished.
"My God, they've done it!" said a
reporter for the British Broadcasting
Corp., who believed as did many other
journalists watching the drama from
behind police barricades that the ter
rorists had carried out their threat to
blow up the building.
Diversion
However, British sources in
Washington said the explosions were
caused by the commandos as a diver
sion.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner
Sir David McNee said the decision to
launch the assault was made after the
Arabs killed two of their captives yes
terday and threatened to kill another
every half hour if their demands were
not met.
Officials reported none of the com
mandos or police was wounded in the
lightening raid that was over in about
five minutes. They declined to say how
many SAS commandos were involved,
but it was believed at least two four
man squads had been committed.
One of the slain hostages was iden
tified as the embassy press aide, Abbas
Lavasani, 25. Iranian Consul-General
Saytollah Endrie, who was not in the
embassy, said Lavasani "wanted to be a
martyr for Islam. We do not mourn his
death. We are happy his wish was
granted."
Witness report
The report that commandos caused
the explosion was substantiated by a
witness, Morley Smith, who lives near
the embassy. He said he saw "six or
eight" commandos lower themselves
by rope from the rear of the embassy
roof and then throw something into a
second-floor window. An explosion
followed, with flames shooting out of
the windows, and the commandos
"started firing and then they went in,"
he said.
"My initial reaction was, with all the
blasts and flames and shooting, my
God. if anybody comes out unscathed it
will be an absolute miracle," Smith told
reporters.
It was believed the commandos also
were equipped with "stun" grenades
used to immobilize victims with con
cussion
The terrorists had automatic
weapons and grenades.
The terrorists initially had said they
would kill all the hostages if Iran's re
volutionary Islamic government did
not free 91 imprisoned Iranian Arabs.
Arabs form an ethnic minority in

Iran's oil-rich Khuzestan province and
their militants have been waging a hit
and-run war for autonomy from Iran's
central government. Iran is a predo
minantly Moslem country, hut Iranians
are Persians and not Arabs.
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
government had refused to negotiate
and threatened to kill one of the
Khuzestan prisoners for each hostage
slain.
Iranian Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh told Tehran radio Sun
day: "If Britain declares that it cannot
do anything, then we will start taking
action."
Militants 'no comment 1
Iranian militants in the U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran who have held 50
American hostages since Nov. 4 de
clined comment.
The terrorists had freed five hostages
earlier — the last one a Syrian jour
nalist,
British police had been in contact via
field telephones with the gunmen in the
embassy, and had expressed optimism
the siege would end without
bloodshed.
Stalled talks
Then negotiations stalled and at 4:39
p.m. (11:39 a.m. EDT) several shots
were heard inside the embassy and at
7:04 p.m., a man's body in a yellow
macket was pushed through the em
bassy door.
Twenty minutes later, flak-jacketed
commandos swarmed into the em
bassy.
A white flag was waved from a win
dow and one of the three British hos
tages, soundman Sim Harris of the
British Broadcasting Corp., managed
to escape.
Gunfire rattled through the building
and at 7:45 p.m..
Firemen won their battle with the
flames and at 8:15 p.m.. Deputy Assis
tant Commissioner Peter Nievens of
Scotland Yard declared the siege had
ended.
