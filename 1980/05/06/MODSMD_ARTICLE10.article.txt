# Chinese officials confront popular cynicism
## 
### Linda Mathews The Los Angeles Times 
PEKING — "We have talked
of the Communist ideal for so
long, and yet the country is so
poor and the lives of the people
so bitter," a 27-year-old Peking
worker. Yu Qiushi, complained
in a letter to a newspaper. "What
good are ideals? We can't eat
them."
A few years ago, no one would

' What good are ideals?, We can't eat them'

have dared utter such thoughts.
But Yu's burst of candor was
printed in a Communist Party
newspaper, the Worker's Daily,
as part of an official effort to con
front the widespread cynicism
that has engulfed China, eroding
youthful idealism and undercut
ting Communist Party authority.
The growing dissatisfaction
with the government is apparent
wherever young urbanites
gather. At universities, in
smoke-filled teahouses, over
bowls of steaming noodles in
dingy cafes, youthful Chinese
pour out their grievances and
voice their disappointment that
the regime has failed to deliver
on many of its promises.
"Liberation was so long ago,"
a 30-year-old Chinese tour guide
recently lamented, "and it's no
longer enough for the oldtimers
to keep telling us that China is
better off than it was before
1949. Most of us weren't even
alive then.
"All I know is that my stan
dard of living never improves.
Under the Gang of Four, I
earned $27 a month. Under
Deng Xiaping, I earn $27 a
month. What's the difference?
Facing problems
Revolutions often grow old
and stale, but what is surprising
here is that the Peking au
thorities are facing up to their
problem and trying to raise pub
lic morale, although without ap
preciable success so far. \.
The Shanghai newspaper Wen
Hui Rao recently printed a brut
ally accurate summary of what it
called "China's crisis of confi

dence," something ordinary
Chinese previously had discus
sed only among friends.
"Some people think
Marxism-Leninism no longer
works," the paper reported.
"They are unwilling to study it
any more. In school, political les
sons are not well-received. Of
fices and factories often hold
political and theoretical study
classes in a happy-go-lucky fash

ion. To them, they are just occa
sions for killing time."
Malaise
So far, the malaise is not so
great that it jeopardizes the par
ty's grip on the country, but it is
reflected in factory absenteeism,
shoddy work, street crime,
juvenile delinquency and other
social problems potentielly
threatening to China's stability.
"We all recognize that young
people are impatient," said the
editor of a leading party news
paper. "By now, thingsshould be
better, much better, and they're
not. I don't blame young people;
I'm impatient myself."
Such impatience seems jus
tified, for the dimensions of Chi
na's urban problems are over
whelming.
Lack housing
By official count, 35 percent of
China's 200 million urban resi
dents lack adequate housing. At
least 10 million youths are un
employed. On the average, a
high school graduate waits two
years before he can be assigned a
job. Some of those who are put
to work are even unhappier, for
they find themselves in dead-end
factory jobs with little chance of
advancement. Universitites can
find places in their freshman
classes for only one applicant in
20.
Salaries are an especially sore
point. To boost production, the
government has raised the pay of
60 percent of the work force
since the 1976 death of Mao
Tse-tung. But the other 40 per
cent, including teachers and
other intellectuals, are working

at salary levels frozen since
1965.
Some of these grievances
against the system were stirred
by China's now-defunct dissi
dent magazines, whose youthful
editors startled their elders by
speaking the unspeakable and
publishing material the official
press would never touch.
Unhappy
"Marxism and communism
have not brought happiness to
Chines youth," the underground
journal Explorations declared
before it was silenced last winter.
"As a result, we no longer be
lieve in politics or any of the
'isms.' Who can blame us?"
But the Communsit Party it
self and the current moderniza
tion drive, with all its inflated
rhetoric about catching up with
the Western world economicaly
by the year 2000, are also to
blame for low morale.
"What we have here is a classic
case of rising expectations — an
inevitable disappointment," a
Communist newspaper editor
observed. "In a sense, we
created this problem ourselves.
Disillusioned
"People thought that once na
tional policies began to change,
they could expect speedy action
on their problems and a signific
ant improvement in their living
standards. And, of course,
they're disillusioned that nothing
of the sort has happened."
To lift some of the gloom, the
party has begun to take concrete
measures to upgrade living stan
dards, create new jobs and cor
rect old injustices. People are
also being permitted, in the let
ters columns of newspapers and
other forums, to sound off about
their grievances.
But the main thrust of the cur
rent campaign is that Chinese
citizens must simply try to under
stand the scope of the nation's
problems, forget their own
yearnings for a while and be pa
tient.
The rhetoric and high-flying
promises that produced this gen
eration of cynics has been toned
down markedly in recent weeks.
Youth placated
Definite steps have been ta

ken, however, to placate youth
ful malcontents, the single most
volatile and troublesome group in
the country.
In the past year, jobs have
been found for nearly 10 million
young people, though the official
press has conceded that there are
still another 10 million on the
jobless rolls.
A system of proficiency tests
has been introduced in Chinese
factories so that skilled workers
can be assured of promotions. In
Peking alone, more than
160,000 scientific and technical
personnel who had been shunted
into menial work for political
reasons have been transferred to
jobs in their specialties.
The New China News Agency
reported recently that, for the
first time in 30 years 356 Shan

ghai intellectuals and profes
sional people had been com
mended as "model workers," a
sign that intellectuals are slowly
winning political acceptance.
"When I read the newspapers,
I am confident about the future,"
said the tour guide, a second
generation party member and
thus, from the Chinese perspec
tive, someone with impeccable
credentials. "But when I turn
around and face the reality of
daily life in China, well . . . The
truth is that most people are
struggling just to get from one
day to the next.
"All my life I have been taught
to say, 'Long live the Chinese
Communist Party.'But I'm not
sure I believe that. I'm not sure
any young Chinese believes
that."

editor of a leading party news
paper. "By now, thingsshould be
better, much better, and they're
not. I don't blame young people;
I'm impatient myself."
Such impatience seems jus
tified, for the dimensions of Chi
na's urban problems are over
whelming.
Lack housing
By official count, 35 percent of
China's 200 million urban resi
dents lack adequate housing. At
least 10 million youths are un
employed. On the average, a
high school graduate waits two
years before he can be assigned a
job. Some of those who are put
to work are even unhappier, for
they find themselves in dead-end
factory jobs with little chance of
advancement. Universitites can
find places in their freshman
classes for only one applicant in
20.
Salaries are an especially sore
point. To boost production, the
government has raised the pay of
60 percent of the work force
since the 1976 death of Mao
Tse-tung. But the other 40 per
cent, including teachers and
other intellectuals, are working

at salary levels frozen since
1965.
Some of these grievances
against the system were stirred
by China's now-defunct dissi
dent magazines, whose youthful
editors startled their elders by
speaking the unspeakable and
publishing material the official
press would never touch.
Unhappy
"Marxism and communism
have not brought happiness to
Chines youth," the underground
journal Explorations declared
before it was silenced last winter.
"As a result, we no longer be
lieve in politics or any of the
'isms.' Who can blame us?"
But the Communsit Party it
self and the current moderniza
tion drive, with all its inflated
rhetoric about catching up with
the Western world economicaly
by the year 2000, are also to
blame for low morale.
"What we have here is a classic
case of rising expectations — an
inevitable disappointment," a
Communist newspaper editor
observed. "In a sense, we
created this problem ourselves.
Disillusioned
"People thought that once na
tional policies began to change,
they could expect speedy action
on their problems and a signific
ant improvement in their living
standards. And, of course,
they're disillusioned that nothing
of the sort has happened."
To lift some of the gloom, the
party has begun to take concrete
measures to upgrade living stan
dards, create new jobs and cor
rect old injustices. People are
also being permitted, in the let
ters columns of newspapers and
other forums, to sound off about
their grievances.
But the main thrust of the cur
rent campaign is that Chinese
citizens must simply try to under
stand the scope of the nation's
problems, forget their own
yearnings for a while and be pa
tient.
The rhetoric and high-flying
promises that produced this gen
eration of cynics has been toned
down markedly in recent weeks.
Youth placated
Definite steps have been ta

ken, however, to placate youth
ful malcontents, the single most
volatile and troublesome group in
the country.
In the past year, jobs have
been found for nearly 10 million
young people, though the official
press has conceded that there are
still another 10 million on the
jobless rolls.
A system of proficiency tests
has been introduced in Chinese
factories so that skilled workers
can be assured of promotions. In
Peking alone, more than
160,000 scientific and technical
personnel who had been shunted
into menial work for political
reasons have been transferred to
jobs in their specialties.
The New China News Agency
reported recently that, for the
first time in 30 years 356 Shan

ghai intellectuals and profes
sional people had been com
mended as "model workers," a
sign that intellectuals are slowly
winning political acceptance.
"When I read the newspapers,
I am confident about the future,"
said the tour guide, a second
generation party member and
thus, from the Chinese perspec
tive, someone with impeccable
credentials. "But when I turn
around and face the reality of
daily life in China, well . . . The
truth is that most people are
struggling just to get from one
day to the next.
"All my life I have been taught
to say, 'Long live the Chinese
Communist Party.'But I'm not
sure I believe that. I'm not sure
any young Chinese believes
that."
PEKING — "We have talked
of the Communist ideal for so
long, and yet the country is so
poor and the lives of the people
so bitter," a 27-year-old Peking
worker. Yu Qiushi, complained
in a letter to a newspaper. "What
good are ideals? We can't eat
them."
A few years ago, no one would

' What good are ideals?, We can't eat them'

have dared utter such thoughts.
But Yu's burst of candor was
printed in a Communist Party
newspaper, the Worker's Daily,
as part of an official effort to con
front the widespread cynicism
that has engulfed China, eroding
youthful idealism and undercut
ting Communist Party authority.
The growing dissatisfaction
with the government is apparent
wherever young urbanites
gather. At universities, in
smoke-filled teahouses, over
bowls of steaming noodles in
dingy cafes, youthful Chinese
pour out their grievances and
voice their disappointment that
the regime has failed to deliver
on many of its promises.
"Liberation was so long ago,"
a 30-year-old Chinese tour guide
recently lamented, "and it's no
longer enough for the oldtimers
to keep telling us that China is
better off than it was before
1949. Most of us weren't even
alive then.
"All I know is that my stan
dard of living never improves.
Under the Gang of Four, I
earned $27 a month. Under
Deng Xiaping, I earn $27 a
month. What's the difference?
Facing problems
Revolutions often grow old
and stale, but what is surprising
here is that the Peking au
thorities are facing up to their
problem and trying to raise pub
lic morale, although without ap
preciable success so far. \.
The Shanghai newspaper Wen
Hui Rao recently printed a brut
ally accurate summary of what it
called "China's crisis of confi

dence," something ordinary
Chinese previously had discus
sed only among friends.
"Some people think
Marxism-Leninism no longer
works," the paper reported.
"They are unwilling to study it
any more. In school, political les
sons are not well-received. Of
fices and factories often hold
political and theoretical study
classes in a happy-go-lucky fash

ion. To them, they are just occa
sions for killing time."
Malaise
So far, the malaise is not so
great that it jeopardizes the par
ty's grip on the country, but it is
reflected in factory absenteeism,
shoddy work, street crime,
juvenile delinquency and other
social problems potentielly
threatening to China's stability.
