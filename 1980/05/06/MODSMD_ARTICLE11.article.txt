# Threat to Bani-Sadr's authority
## Iran slips in Kurd fighting 
### William Branigin The Washington Post 
TEHRAN â€” The government
of President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr, already boxed in by domes
tic and international political
problems, is taking a beating in a
military conflict that may prove a
more serious threat to his author
ity: an increasingly damaging
war with the country's Kurdish
minority.
An indicator of the intensity of
the fighting, in which govern
ment forces have used air strikes
and heavy guns against Kurdish
cities and towns, was a six-hour
cease-fire called Sunday to allow
relief workers to collect the dead
from the streets of Sanandaj, the
provincial capital of Iranian
Kurdistan.
Iranian radio and television
reported that the cease-fire was
broken when "counter
revolutionaries" opened fire on
army troops and Revolutionary
Guards, killing or wounding at
least 20 of them.
Before the cease-fire, scores
of bodies littered the streets, and
could not be retrieved because of
the intensity of the fighting, re
ports from Sanandaj said. Kur
dish authorities reportedly were
worried about the possibility of
an epidemic and critical shor
tages of food and medical

supplies.
For Bani-Sadr, the Kurdish
war represents another instance
where his government has been
caught in a conflict from which it
does not stand to gain. As with
the problem posed by the U.S.
hostage crisis and last month's
clashes between leftist students
and right-wing Moslem fun
damentalists, the Bani-Sadr
government has been forced to
toe the line drawn by his hard
line Moslem rivals and see his
authority weakened in the pro
cess.
Bani-Sadr's declaration of a
unile.jral government cease-fire
last month was met by Kurdish
feelers for a negotiated settle
ment. But the Revolutionary
Guards, a fighting force loyal to
Iran's leader Ayatollah Ruhol
lah Khomeini, announced it
could not accept a truce and
would fight until Kurdish resis
tance had been crushed.
The developments have
forced Bani-Sadr to espouse a
tougher position on the fighting
in Kurdistan, as evidenced by his
statement Saturday night to
Khomeini in a briefing on
domestic and foreign policy.
According to the official Pars
news agency, Bani-Sadr said,
"We did not start the fighting in
Kurdistan. We tried to persuade
them (Kurdish guerrillas) not to
begin war and fratricide . . . But
they regarded our efforts to pre
vent fratricide as a sign of our
weakness. 1 declare again we
shall act according to what we
have promised as soon as the
armed irresponsible elements
leave."
In their efforts to wipe out
Kurdish guerrilla strongholds,
the Revolutionary Guards and
regular Army units have re
sorted to use of F-4 fighter bom
bers, Cobra helicopter gunships
and mortars against civilian
population centers, causing
heavy casualties and material
damage. Diplomatic analysts
said the use of such weaponry is
not only a sign of weak and inef
fective armed forces, but also
placed Bani-Sadr in a political no
man's land.
"The government is in terrible
shape over Kurdistan," one ob
server said. "This could even
turn out to be Bani-Sadr's Viet
nam. I don't think he'll be able to

get out of this one."
According to diplomats, a
military solution to the conflict
looks increasingly remote, and
the hard-liners' opposition to
negotiation is making it difficult
for Bani-Sadr to act to end the
warfare.
According to the Kurdistan
Democratic Party, one of the
main guerrilla organizations in
volved in the fighting, about
1500 persons have been killed in
Sanandaj in the past two weeks.
Most of the casualties have re
sulted from air strikes and mor
tar fire, Kurdish sources said.
No complete casualty figures
have been announced for the
government forces, but several
hundred soldiers and Revolutio
nary Guards were estimated to
have been killed or wounded in
the fighting.
The Kurdish conflict flared
shortly after Iran's February
1979 revolution when restive
Kurds began agitating for reg
ional autonomy. Khomeini last
June ordered a full-scale offen
sive against Kurdish rebels. The
insurgents were forced to quit
their urban strongholds and take
to the hills following an
onslaught by government forces.
They gradually worked their
way back into effective control of
the region as the government be
came preoccupied with other
problems.
Khomeini then reversed him
self and tacitly authorized
negotiations with the Kurds on
their autonomy demands. The
negotiations continued through
the winter, but fell apart this
spring.
Confronted by skirmishing
along the border between Ira
nian and Iraqi forces early last
month, the Tehran government
ordered an Army column to
march through Sanandaj toward
the border area. The column's
advance was halted outside the
provincial capital by Kurdish
groups that suspected the de
ployment was a ruse to take back
control of the city in violation of
an agreement to keep Iranian
troops out of Kurdish cities.
Fighting between government
forces and the Kurds was
sparked when hard-line mem
bers of small Kurdish parties at
tacked the column.
