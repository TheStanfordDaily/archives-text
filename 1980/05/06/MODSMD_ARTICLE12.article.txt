# Iraqi instability hurts regional role
## 
### Jonathan C. Randal The Washington Post 
BAGH DAD, Iraq — The assassination at
tempts, mass deportations and angry rhetoric
in Iraq are for the country's leaders a dis
quieting throwback to the embattled early
years following seizure of power by the Arab
Socialist Baath Party in 1968.
Despite Baghdad's pretensions to Arab
and Third World leadership, such as its effort
in late 1978 to rally Arab opposition to
Egypt's impending peace treaty with Israel,
the Iraqi Baathists are showing signs of settl
ing for mere survival.
President Saddam Hussein still formally
follows a policy of calculated flexibility and
seems in no hurry to return to the self
imposed isolation that formerly made Iraq
the Arab world's odd man out.
Two years ago, Iraq's pretensions to Mid
dle East leadership were based not just on its
potential — oil reserves second only to Saudi
Arabia, a disciplined and motivated ruling
party, sufficient if salt-drenched land and a
sizeable population — but also on the weak
ness of its rivals.
Suddenly, geopolitics seemed to have sing
led out Iraq for greatness: a regional role as
protector of the oil of Arab states in the
Persian Gulf from the encroachments of
Iran's Islamic revolution.
Turn hack clock
Yet, for those with long memories, it was
as if an effort was being made to turn the

clock back two decades, to the time before
the 1958 military coup had swept away the
British-backed monarchy and murdered
prime minister Nuri Said. The West had set
up the so-called Baghdad Pact linking Pakis
tan, Iran, Iraq, Britain and the United States
in an alliance aimed at stemming Egyptian
president Gamal Abdel Nasser's brand of
resolution.
All but forgotten in the reworked
Baghdad-as-bulwark theories has been
Iraq's postrevolutionary record — at least 10
coups or attempted coups, two armed rebell
ions, a full-scale civil war and an ever-restive
Shiite Moslem majority.
Also overlooked in such calculations are
the regime's bristling nationalism, its fixation
with its sovereignty and its determination to
maintain pure revolutionary credentials in
playing host to the 1982 nonaligned summit
conference.
'Little corruption'
Despite an admirable record on corrup
tion (by oil-rich nations' standards, at least),
massive efforts on education, industrializa
tion, roads and housing, Iraq seethes with
rumors of political instability.
In April, grenades were tossed at Depty
Prime Ministr Tariq Aziz, the only Christian
on the ruling Revolutionary Command
Council. Last year, there were disturbances
in the cities of Kerbala and Najaf, where
important Shiite shrines are located.
Iraqi Kurds and Turkemans reportedly
have been arrested — national minorities

that have been restive in neighboring Iran as
well.
In the steady deterioration of their rela
tions, border clashes gave way to unsubstan
tiated Iranian claims that Iraq had killed
Ayatollah Mohammed Bakr Sadr, a Shiite
leader who has been under house arrest since
June 1979.
Sunni Moslems
Iraq is run by Sunni Moslems increasingly
under fire from Iran's Shiites, who are
angered at their Iraqi brothers' alleged
second-class citizen status.
In addition to problems with Iran,
Baghdad's relations with Baathist rival Syria
have worsened. Since last year relations bet
ween the two capitals have relapsed into
Iraqi accusations that Syria formented an
abortive coup here and Baghdad's boasting
that it backs the increasingly serious domes
tic opposition in Syria.
The 1979 security arrangements between
verbally revolutionary Iraq and the Saudi
monarchy, born of commonly perceived
dangers from Iran, does not seem to have
gone beyond low-level police cooperation.
Since the Grand Mosque seizure in Mecca
last November, the Saudis have become
more wary of Iraqi ties, according to dip
lomats. Rising Iraqi political influence in
Saudi Arabia could be interpreted as indirect
support for the younger princes in the Saudi
royal family who are said to favor lessened
dependence on the United States.
