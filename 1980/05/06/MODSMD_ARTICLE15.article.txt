This is probably not what Samuel Coleridge had in mind when he wrote Kubla Khan. It is,
however, the architect's model of the new dorm to be erected near Lake Lagunita. In the
bottom left is Lagunita Hall, in the top left is the lake and at the top is the golf driving range.
The dorm is scheduled to open beginning in 1982. "So twice five miles of fertile ground with
walls and towers were girdled round." — Coleridge.
