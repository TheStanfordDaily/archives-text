## ACLU: University conceals Franklin facts 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the first of a two-part column on
the dismissal of former Prof. Bruce Franklin and the
current advisory board hearing. See tomorrow's Daily for
part two.)
On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of
Northern California (ACLU), we write to protest the
star-chamber quality of a "hearing" currently being
conducted by the Stanford administration and its Advis
ory Board in the matter of former Prof. Bruce Franklin.
As the University administration is attempting to con
ceal the facts of Franklin's case from the Stanford com
munity. though issues in the suit have a serious impact on
academic freedom far beyond Professor Franklin's par
ticular situation, it is vital that the University community
be made aware of the history and current status of the
litigation:
— Franklin, a nationally respected scholar of litera
ture. was the first, and only, tenured member of the
faculty ever to be fired by the University.
— Franklin was fired explicitly for delivering four
speeches in 1971. denoucing Stanford's complicity in the
Vietnam war and police suppression of an anti-war de
monstration on campus. Those speeches, in the ACLU's
view, are expressions of political dissent protected by the
First Amendment. For that reason, in 1972, the ACLU
decided to provide legal representation to Franklin in a
court challenge to this dismissal, and continues to repre
sent him before the Advisory Board.
— The Santa Clara Superior Court in 1978 ruled that
two of the speeches for which Franklin was discharged
are constitutionally protected, and ordered the Univer
sity hearings to be re-opened to reconsider the penalty of
dismissal.
— The administration and its Advisory Board have
now decided that the new court-ordered Advisory
Board hearings will be held in private and allow for only
two written comments as the sole presentation on
Franklin's behalf. The procedures ordered for the new
hearings violate Stanford'sown Rules for the Conduct of
Hearings and fundamental principles of due process.
The board will follow procedures which deny Franklin
the right to introduce any evidence, the right to an open

hearing, the right of access to information critical to his
defense, the right to address the hoard members, the
right to full representation on the board by members of
Franklin's School of Humanities and Sciences, and the
right to an unbiased panel.
Franklin is nationally recognized as a brilliant writer,
scholar and teacher; even the Advisory Board which
recommended his termination eight years ago conceded
his "exceptional competence" as an English professor.
He was fired explicitly for delivering four speeches in
1971. at the height of campus protest against the escalat
ing war in Southeast Asia.
In those speeches. Franklin condemned the Universi
ty's active involvement in the military effort in Vietnam
and the police dispersal of an anti-war rally on campus.
Specifically, Franklin denounced a secret computer
program being run in Stanford's Computation Center.
Known as "Gamut H," that program was a plan for a
potential amphibious invasion of Indochina, and, as clas
sified research, was illegal under the University rules.
Franklin's termination by the Stanford trustees fol
lowed a hearing before the Stanford Advisory Board in
1971. In many ways, that hearing failed to satisfy the
requirements of fundamental fairness: for example, the
University expended substantial resources to hire a team
of attorneys from a large law firm in Los Angeles, while
Franklin, who had no such financial resources, was
forced to defend himself with the assistance of a chang
ing cast of volunteers.
Nevertheless, a hearing was held, as the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure required. Its result:
five members of the board voted to disharge Franklin;
two members of the board, Donald Kennedy and Robert
McAfee Brown, believed afar less severe sanction (tem
porary suspension) should be imposed. Both recom
mendations were presented to President Richard Lyman
and the board of trustees, who chose termination.
Franklin, without the finances to challenge the Uni
versity and its phalanx of lawyers in a protracted legal
battle, turned to the ACLU for help. Members of the

community, both enemies and supporters of Franklin,
barraged the ACLU with letters, telephone calls and
visits. Considerable pressure — unique to our experi
ence — was applied in an attempt to prevent or promote
the ACLU's intervention in the suit.
A painstaking review of the case was conducted.
Academic freedom experts at the ACLU's national
headquarters in New York analyzed the bulky file. The
ACLU's Northern California Legal Committee, com
prised of some of the Bay area's most distinguished
attorneys, discussed the case at length. The ACLU of
Northern California's Board of Directors reviewed the
140-page Advisory Board report which recommended
Professor Franklin's discharge.
Written legal analyses of the case were circulated to all
ACLU members in Northern California (over 17,000)
and their views were solicited. Finally, the controversy
culminated in an oral debate on the case presented be
fore the ACLU Board of Directors between constitu
tional law scholars Gerald Gunther of Stanford and Alan
Dershowitz of Harvard.
At the conclusion of this thorough evaluation process,
in March, 1972, the ACLU's Board of Directors voted
unanimously, 20 to 0, to represent Franklin.
The ACLU made this decision fully aware of this
lawsuit's tremendous drain on our limited resources. But
we felt that the time and expense were justified by two
aspects of this case. First, Franklin's speeches, charac
terized by the Stanford administration as "incitement to
misconduct," are expressions of significant political dis
sent plainly protected by the First Amendment.
Second, Franklin's firing was a blow to academic free
dom which posed a critical threat to civil liberties: if
unchallenged, the Franklin discharge symbolized a
loaded gun held to the head of any faculty member who
might wish to voice controversial positions on matters of
public concern.
We have never retreated from those views of the
Franklin case. We never will.

potential amphibious invasion of Indochina, and, as clas
sified research, was illegal under the University rules.
Franklin's termination by the Stanford trustees fol
lowed a hearing before the Stanford Advisory Board in
1971. In many ways, that hearing failed to satisfy the
requirements of fundamental fairness: for example, the
University expended substantial resources to hire a team
of attorneys from a large law firm in Los Angeles, while
Franklin, who had no such financial resources, was
forced to defend himself with the assistance of a chang
ing cast of volunteers.
Nevertheless, a hearing was held, as the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure required. Its result:
five members of the board voted to disharge Franklin;
two members of the board, Donald Kennedy and Robert
McAfee Brown, believed afar less severe sanction (tem
porary suspension) should be imposed. Both recom
mendations were presented to President Richard Lyman
and the board of trustees, who chose termination.
Franklin, without the finances to challenge the Uni
versity and its phalanx of lawyers in a protracted legal
battle, turned to the ACLU for help. Members of the

community, both enemies and supporters of Franklin,
barraged the ACLU with letters, telephone calls and
visits. Considerable pressure — unique to our experi
ence — was applied in an attempt to prevent or promote
the ACLU's intervention in the suit.
A painstaking review of the case was conducted.
Academic freedom experts at the ACLU's national
headquarters in New York analyzed the bulky file. The
ACLU's Northern California Legal Committee, com
prised of some of the Bay area's most distinguished
attorneys, discussed the case at length. The ACLU of
Northern California's Board of Directors reviewed the
140-page Advisory Board report which recommended
Professor Franklin's discharge.
Written legal analyses of the case were circulated to all
ACLU members in Northern California (over 17,000)
and their views were solicited. Finally, the controversy
culminated in an oral debate on the case presented be
fore the ACLU Board of Directors between constitu
tional law scholars Gerald Gunther of Stanford and Alan
Dershowitz of Harvard.
At the conclusion of this thorough evaluation process,
in March, 1972, the ACLU's Board of Directors voted
unanimously, 20 to 0, to represent Franklin.
The ACLU made this decision fully aware of this
lawsuit's tremendous drain on our limited resources. But
we felt that the time and expense were justified by two
aspects of this case. First, Franklin's speeches, charac
terized by the Stanford administration as "incitement to
misconduct," are expressions of significant political dis
sent plainly protected by the First Amendment.
Second, Franklin's firing was a blow to academic free
dom which posed a critical threat to civil liberties: if
unchallenged, the Franklin discharge symbolized a
loaded gun held to the head of any faculty member who
might wish to voice controversial positions on matters of
public concern.
We have never retreated from those views of the
Franklin case. We never will.

the dismissal of former Prof. Bruce Franklin and the

On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union of
Northern California (ACLU), we write to protest the
star-chamber quality of a "hearing" currently being
conducted by the Stanford administration and its Advis
ory Board in the matter of former Prof. Bruce Franklin.
As the University administration is attempting to con
ceal the facts of Franklin's case from the Stanford com
munity. though issues in the suit have a serious impact on
academic freedom far beyond Professor Franklin's par
ticular situation, it is vital that the University community
be made aware of the history and current status of the
litigation:
— Franklin, a nationally respected scholar of litera
ture. was the first, and only, tenured member of the
faculty ever to be fired by the University.
— Franklin was fired explicitly for delivering four
speeches in 1971. denoucing Stanford's complicity in the
Vietnam war and police suppression of an anti-war de
monstration on campus. Those speeches, in the ACLU's
view, are expressions of political dissent protected by the
First Amendment. For that reason, in 1972, the ACLU
decided to provide legal representation to Franklin in a
court challenge to this dismissal, and continues to repre
sent him before the Advisory Board.
— The Santa Clara Superior Court in 1978 ruled that
two of the speeches for which Franklin was discharged
are constitutionally protected, and ordered the Univer
sity hearings to be re-opened to reconsider the penalty of
dismissal.
— The administration and its Advisory Board have
now decided that the new court-ordered Advisory
Board hearings will be held in private and allow for only
two written comments as the sole presentation on
Franklin's behalf. The procedures ordered for the new
hearings violate Stanford'sown Rules for the Conduct of
Hearings and fundamental principles of due process.
The board will follow procedures which deny Franklin
the right to introduce any evidence, the right to an open

hearing, the right of access to information critical to his
defense, the right to address the hoard members, the
right to full representation on the board by members of
Franklin's School of Humanities and Sciences, and the
right to an unbiased panel.
Franklin is nationally recognized as a brilliant writer,
scholar and teacher; even the Advisory Board which
recommended his termination eight years ago conceded
his "exceptional competence" as an English professor.
He was fired explicitly for delivering four speeches in
1971. at the height of campus protest against the escalat
ing war in Southeast Asia.
In those speeches. Franklin condemned the Universi
ty's active involvement in the military effort in Vietnam
and the police dispersal of an anti-war rally on campus.
Specifically, Franklin denounced a secret computer
program being run in Stanford's Computation Center.
Known as "Gamut H," that program was a plan for a
potential amphibious invasion of Indochina, and, as clas
sified research, was illegal under the University rules.
Franklin's termination by the Stanford trustees fol
