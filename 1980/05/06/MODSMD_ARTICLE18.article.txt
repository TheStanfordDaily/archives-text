Hoax Apology
We, the initiates of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society would
like to extend an apology and an
explanation to the Stanford
community with regards to the
bowling picture and caption
which appeared on the cover of
Friday's Daily.
What we intended to be an in
nocent initiation prank blew up
in our faces. It was a misun
derstanding which none of us
predicted or desired. We did not
intend to cause anybody grief.
Our goal from the start was to
get our picture before the cam
pus in a manner we hoped the
campus would find humorous. The
Chaparral, which all of the in
itiates work for (and which was
unaware of the prank), had or
dered bowling shirts instead of
its yearly T-shirts. This gave us
the idea for the picture. Our first
Caption read "They Pulled It
Off! Bowling team wins National
title."

The problem with this caption
was that there was no plausible
excuse that we could give the
printer for why the story had
come in late and why a substitu
tion had to be made just then.
Hence, the unfortunate choice
was made to put in the caption
finally selected. For this caption
we originally typeset "Tragedy
Strikes Bowling Team. None
'Spared'," but it was felt that this
was too obvious, and that the
pun "Tragedy Strikes Bowling
Team" alone would be enough
to tip off the prank.
It must be made clear that
none of us expected the picture to
be taken seriously. We did not
intend for people to think that
we were dead or that the bowling
team was dead. To our distress,
this was not the case. We undere
stimated the power that printed
news has in persuading its read
ers. Again, we are very sorry.
We do not condone drawing
humor from the misfortunes of
others. This was not the intent of

the picture. Rather, we intended
the humor to derive from the ab
surdity of the situation.
Perhaps naively, we assumed
that the individuals depicted
would he recognized as non
howlers. also that the real bowl
ing team would not be thought of
since the caption specified
"members of the Stanford Bowl
ing Team pictured above." We
have apologized to the bowling
team. Contrary to rumor, none
of the members we have spoken
to are aware of any bowler's pa
rents receiving calls of condo
lence.
We also felt that the appear
ance of the hammer in the pic
ture would suggest the Hammer
and Coffin Society.
Finally, the abrupt "Details in
Monday's Daily" without men
tion of the names or any sur
rounding curcumstances was in
tended to arouse suspicion.
All this, along with the title
pun, was intended to assure
readers that the picture was a
prank. In retrospect, we were
much too subtle.
Regrettably, the sympathy of
many in the Stanford community
was extended unnecessarily. It is
for this that we are most sorry.

H&C apology
The Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety apologizes to Stanford's
bowling team, their family and
friends, and to all those deceived

by Friday's thoughtless prank.
As the publishers of a humor
magazine, we are the first to ap
preciate that what took place was
not funny.
The seven pranksters are in
itiates to the Hammer and Coffin
Society, an organization founded
in 1906 as the owner and pub
lisher of the Stanford Chaparral.
While the society is responsible
for the content of the magazine,
neither the Chaparral nor its
staff can be held responsible for
the actions of a few aspiring
members of the society. This is
not our first initiation prank, and
it is traditional for the initiates
not to discuss their prank with
the members. The idea was to
surprise us. They succeeded.
Former editor Bruce Flandy
and editor Jay Martel were con
tacted early Friday morning. The
first they heard of the prank was
from the reporters. They spoke
as students and as personal
friends of those pictured. They
were not given time to consider
the emotional consequences to
those outside the organization.
They were not speaking for the
society, which has always prom
oted responsible behavior by the
magazine staff.
Past Hammer and Coffin initi
ation pranks have been so in
nocuous that we didn't think it
necessary to discuss their plans
beforehand. Had we done so,
this would not have happened.
While we cannot condone
their behavior, we support the
efforts of our initiates to obtain
rational adjudication of their
case. We have worked closely
with them for two years and
know them to be responsible in
dividuals of good character.
After a serious discussion with
the initiates, we have no doubt
that their intent was innocuous
and their remorse is sincere.

Editor's note: The Daily finds
the two apologies from the
Hammer and Coffin Society and
the seven initiates into that society
incredibly insensitive and insuffi
cient. They are printed today be
cause the incident and subsequent
reactions all occurred after the
opinions page deadline for yes
terday's Daily.
The letter from the seven in
itiates of the Hammer and Coffin
Society seems to indicate that this
community was not sophisticated
enough to take note of the several
clues the group left which, to
them, clearly showed the picture
and caption to be a hoax. Their
subtlety certainly was aimed for a
much more alert and aware audi
ence than this community.
Conspicuously missing from
both letters is any sign of apology
to the Daily, or to its readers for
harm done to the newspaper's
reputation or financial base.
Neither seem to find anything
wrong with the idea of tampering
with a newspaper. In fact, Bruce
Handy said Sunday that he still
considered the Daily to be fair
game for this type of action.
The Daily intends to make it
clear to the community that it is
not fair game for its humorous, or
political purposes. It is not for our
own benefit for this to be so, but
for the benefit of the Daily's read
ers. You have a right to expect
more from this community's
newspaper.

Editor's note: The Daily finds
the two apologies from the
Hammer and Coffin Society and
the seven initiates into that society
incredibly insensitive and insuffi
cient. They are printed today be
cause the incident and subsequent
reactions all occurred after the
opinions page deadline for yes
terday's Daily.
The letter from the seven in
itiates of the Hammer and Coffin
Society seems to indicate that this
community was not sophisticated
enough to take note of the several
clues the group left which, to
them, clearly showed the picture
and caption to be a hoax. Their
subtlety certainly was aimed for a
much more alert and aware audi
ence than this community.
Conspicuously missing from
both letters is any sign of apology
to the Daily, or to its readers for
harm done to the newspaper's
reputation or financial base.
Neither seem to find anything
wrong with the idea of tampering
with a newspaper. In fact, Bruce
Handy said Sunday that he still
considered the Daily to be fair
game for this type of action.
The Daily intends to make it
clear to the community that it is
not fair game for its humorous, or
political purposes. It is not for our
own benefit for this to be so, but
for the benefit of the Daily's read

Hoax Apology
We, the initiates of the Ham
mer and Coffin Society would
like to extend an apology and an
explanation to the Stanford
community with regards to the
bowling picture and caption
which appeared on the cover of
Friday's Daily.
What we intended to be an in
nocent initiation prank blew up
in our faces. It was a misun
derstanding which none of us
predicted or desired. We did not
intend to cause anybody grief.
Our goal from the start was to
get our picture before the cam
pus in a manner we hoped the
campus would find humorous. The
Chaparral, which all of the in
itiates work for (and which was
unaware of the prank), had or
dered bowling shirts instead of
its yearly T-shirts. This gave us
the idea for the picture. Our first
Caption read "They Pulled It
Off! Bowling team wins National
title."

The problem with this caption
was that there was no plausible
excuse that we could give the
printer for why the story had
come in late and why a substitu
tion had to be made just then.
Hence, the unfortunate choice
was made to put in the caption
finally selected. For this caption
we originally typeset "Tragedy
Strikes Bowling Team. None
'Spared'," but it was felt that this
was too obvious, and that the
pun "Tragedy Strikes Bowling
Team" alone would be enough
to tip off the prank.
It must be made clear that
none of us expected the picture to
be taken seriously. We did not
intend for people to think that
we were dead or that the bowling
team was dead. To our distress,
this was not the case. We undere
stimated the power that printed
news has in persuading its read
ers. Again, we are very sorry.
We do not condone drawing
humor from the misfortunes of
others. This was not the intent of

the picture. Rather, we intended
the humor to derive from the ab
surdity of the situation.
Perhaps naively, we assumed
that the individuals depicted
would he recognized as non
howlers. also that the real bowl
ing team would not be thought of
since the caption specified
"members of the Stanford Bowl
ing Team pictured above." We
have apologized to the bowling
team. Contrary to rumor, none
of the members we have spoken
to are aware of any bowler's pa
rents receiving calls of condo
lence.
We also felt that the appear
ance of the hammer in the pic
ture would suggest the Hammer
and Coffin Society.
Finally, the abrupt "Details in
Monday's Daily" without men
tion of the names or any sur
rounding curcumstances was in
tended to arouse suspicion.
All this, along with the title
pun, was intended to assure
readers that the picture was a
prank. In retrospect, we were
much too subtle.
Regrettably, the sympathy of
many in the Stanford community
was extended unnecessarily. It is
for this that we are most sorry.

H&C apology
The Hammer and Coffin Soci
ety apologizes to Stanford's
bowling team, their family and
friends, and to all those deceived

by Friday's thoughtless prank.
As the publishers of a humor
magazine, we are the first to ap
preciate that what took place was
not funny.
The seven pranksters are in
itiates to the Hammer and Coffin
Society, an organization founded
in 1906 as the owner and pub
lisher of the Stanford Chaparral.
While the society is responsible
for the content of the magazine,
neither the Chaparral nor its
staff can be held responsible for
the actions of a few aspiring
members of the society. This is
not our first initiation prank, and
it is traditional for the initiates
not to discuss their prank with
the members. The idea was to
surprise us. They succeeded.
Former editor Bruce Flandy
and editor Jay Martel were con
tacted early Friday morning. The
first they heard of the prank was
from the reporters. They spoke
as students and as personal
friends of those pictured. They
were not given time to consider
the emotional consequences to
those outside the organization.
They were not speaking for the
society, which has always prom
oted responsible behavior by the
magazine staff.
Past Hammer and Coffin initi
ation pranks have been so in
nocuous that we didn't think it
necessary to discuss their plans
beforehand. Had we done so,
this would not have happened.
While we cannot condone
their behavior, we support the
efforts of our initiates to obtain
rational adjudication of their
case. We have worked closely
with them for two years and
know them to be responsible in
dividuals of good character.
After a serious discussion with
the initiates, we have no doubt
that their intent was innocuous
and their remorse is sincere.
