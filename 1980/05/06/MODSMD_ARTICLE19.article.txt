## Vote yes on Proposition A 
### 
In the wake of Gay Awareness
Week here, the campus has
turned its attention to the prob
lems and concerns of the
homosexuals among us. 1 feel
that the greatest contribution of
the recognition week was that it
enlightened the community to
the status of gays as individual
human beings, much like us in
most ways.
Gays will be the focus of atten
tion again — this time on a
county-wide scale — on June 3,
when Proposition A appears on
the ballot. The ordinance, passed
by the County Board of Super
visors and now up for confirma
tion by the voters, would pro
hibit discrimination in housing
and employment based on sexual
orientation.

One of the reasons the issue
has been so controversial is that
it is widely misunderstood. It is
not a "Gay Rights Ordinance"
ensuring special rights for
homosexuals. It applies equally
to people of all sexual orienta
tions. It does not include affirma
tive action programs to encour-

age hiring of gays. And most im
portant, it in no way implies a
condonation of homosexuality,
or approval of any particular
sexual activity.
On this subject, I feel that
homosexuality is not right for
me, and that's why I'm a
heterosexual. But I take this a
step further than most liberals on
the subject. I feel that being gay
is unnatural in general, not just
for me. I think that heterosexual
ity is normal, and those who de
viate from it, for whatever
reason, are unfortunate.
This, however, is no reason to
deprive someone of the basic
rights of a place to live and a
means to make a living.
If you're worried about this
lenient attitude toward
homosexuality going too far, it
doesn't under Proposition A.
The law only says that discrimi
nation based solely on sexual
orientation is illegal.
Take the most commonly used
example: What happens if an
elementary school teacher is gay,
and may influence our children?
Well, he can't be fired for being
gay, but of course he can be fired
for trying to convert his students,
or advocating homosexuality in
class, practices which abuse his
responsibility as an educator.
The other common objection
is from those heterosexuals who
say, "I just don't like having
them around," and therefore
oppose both the housing and
employment clauses of the prop
osition. The response is this:
Proposition A is a civil rights law,
written with language parallel to
laws protecting blacks in the
'60s.
In 1964, many American
whites still "didn't like being
around" blacks and didn't want

to be forced to live or work with
them. Well, our Congress finally
had the wisdom to decide that an
individual's right to live and
work where he pleases super
cedes another individual's right
to exercise bigotry for the sake of
his "comfort."
In the past year, while this or-

dinance has been in the political
arena of Santa Clara County, the
only strong, organized opposi
tion has been from fundamen
talist Christian groups, who be
lieve every word of the Bible,
and hold that homosexuality is a
sin. Well, if we had laws against
everything prohibited in the Bi
ble, I know I'd be in trouble and I
think most of the rest of us would
be as well.
The fact is that the mainstream
religious groups, including the
County Council of Churches, the
Archdiocese Council of Social
Justice and the California Pro
vince of the Society of Jesuits,
support the proposition. The
Labor Council, the Commission
on the Status of Women, the
Human Relations Commission
and the County'sCommissionon
Youth agree, and hold that the
ordinance preserves freedom of
opportunity for the individual.
Proposition A simply states
that sexual orientation is not a
valid criterion for evaluating
one's fitness as an employee or
tenant. It protects those of all
orientations from unfair label
ing, true or untrue.
Although I feel that activity
other than heterosexuality is un
natural, I don't think that what
my neighbor does in bed is any of
my concern.
A no vote on Proposition A
would not be a vote to promote
my ideas of decency; rather it
would be a vote to deprive my
fellow citizen of his basic human
rights.
Live and let live. Vote yes on
A.
