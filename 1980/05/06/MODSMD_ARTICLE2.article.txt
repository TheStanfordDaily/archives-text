# Iran releases crewmen's bodies to bishop

From the Daily wire services
Iran turned over the bodies of eight
U.S. servicemen to a Greek Roman
Catholic archbishop in Tehran yester
day, Tehran radio reported.
The remains of the eight crewmen
killed during the ill-fated rescue mis
sion 10 days ago were taken to Tehran
airport.
Barring unforeseen last-minute
complications, the remains will be
flown to Zurich in the custody of Ar
chbishop Hilarion Capudji.
In Zurich, the remains will be turned
over to the Swiss government and the
International Commit
tee of the Red Cross, which will coop
erate with U.S. government officials in
returning them to their families in the
United States.
Capudji, Swiss Ambassador Erik
Lang and Papal Nuncio Annibale Bug
nini yesterday signed papers at the
Tehran morgue permitting the remains
to be transferred to the airport in the
archbishop's keeping.
Informed sources said the remains
were placed in nine lead-lined caskets
specially flown in from Switzerland last
week.

The United States insists that only
eight men were killed when a helicop
ter and a C-130 fuel tanker collided
and exploded in the desert rescue op
eration.
The nine caskets apparently were
used because Ayatollah Sadegh
Khalkhali has maintained that nine
Americans were killed in the incident.
Informed sources said, however, that
the Tehran coroner could only account
for eight men, despite the recent dis
covery of more remains at the site of
the accident.
The sources said that, because of the
condition of the bodies, only three of
the victims could be identified by their
dog tags.
Meanwhile, the spokesman for the
Iranian joint chiefs of staff last night
announced that authorities had located
the final American helicopter used in
the rescue effort.
After suggesting at midday that the
United States had made a new helicop
ter incursion far inland — based on
nomads' claims that they had sighted
four unidentified helicopters flying
overhead Sunday — the spokesman
said the downed helicopter was part of

the failed rescue operation.
The helicopter was found aban
doned in the desert about 370 miles
southeast of Tehran, along the route
taken by the ill-fated American rescue
mission. It had been forced down be
cause of technical failure and a com
panion craft picked up the crew.
The spokesman said maps and
documents had been found in the
helicopter that will be transported to
Tehran.
The student militants holding the
hostages announced last night that they

had transferred more Americans to
three additional cities.
The day after the mission failed, the
militants who have held the hostages at
the U.S. Embassy since Nov. 4 said
they were transferring some of the cap
tives to otljer cities, but some remain in
the embassy and three others are still at
the Foreign Ministry. The militants
added that towns of Arak and Mahal
lat, about 155 miles southwest of
Tehran, to the list of eight places where
they have moved hostages.
