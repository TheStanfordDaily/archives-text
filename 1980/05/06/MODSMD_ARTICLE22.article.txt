## Minstrel with a mission 
### 
Harry Chapin brought his com
pelling blend of musical narra
tive, personal insight and social
activism to Frost Amphitheater
Friday afternoon. Unaccom
panied by his vacationing band,
Chapin's rich voice and warm,
earthy anecdotes delighted the
sun-drenched audience for more
than two hours. Chapin's sweet
six-string guitar melodies and
dynamic lyrics proved to the
capacity crowd that he has
earned his longstanding reputa
tion as the storyteller of the
music industry.
Chapin performed perrenial
favorites such as "Cat's Cradle,"
"A Better Place to Be," "Cir
cle," "Taxi," and its recent up
date, "Sequel." New material in
cluded "Babe, You've Been
Good to Me," and "Sailor's
Song," a sea chanty, due for re
lease following next week's an
nouncement of a new record
label created by former Casab
lanca powerhouse, Neil Bogart.
A strong family man. Chapin
also did "Poor Damned Fool,"
"I Wanna Learn a Love Song,"
and "Tangled Up Puppet"
As one of the music world's
most dedicated philanthropists
and a leading fundraiser on be
half of eliminating world hunger,
Chapin reflects a strong sense of
social consciousness in many of
his songs. The 37-year-old
minstrel performed "Bummer,"
"Copper," and "Red Flowers,"
a number adopted by national
educational organizations as a
banner song against repressive
primary-level schooling.
Chapin, long an advocate of
social change, also encouraged a
passionate platform of political
and personal involvement by the
same students he was entertain
ing, aimed at resolving national
ills. Tempered by the singer's
lively sense of humor, the con
cert remained light in tone.
After his encore, Chapin
mixed with the crowd and of
fered his time for a Daily inter
view. Responsive, extremely
well-read and occasionally self
effacing, Chapin spoke out on a
number of social issues.
Optimism coupled with politi
cal awareness and participation
are critical for the evolution of

America and all other societies,
maintains the singer. Harry
Chapin believes in dreams. And
he believes whole-heartedly in
the American Dream.
"We have to keep the dreams
real or we'll never have the
America you and I were taught
to believe in and expect in grade
school. Without those dreams
we'll lose it, the whole thing. All
our leaders down to the institu
tions themselves, theoretically,
should be trumpeting those
dreams. What else have you
got?" points out Chapin.
Chapin is worried that a gen
eration of young adults is being
systematically conditioned to be
lieve that they cannot effect so
cial change or solve the nation's
problems. The result is a distinct
fatalistic hedonism on the part of
these future pillars of America
and a growing appetite for diver
sions. The analogy Chapin uses is
the title cut from his recent al
bum. Dance Band on the Titanic.
Americans refuse to recognize
the dangers facing an entire so
cial system. Instead they indulge
in diversions created by politi
cians and the media, much like
the dance band that gruesomely
contintues to entertain passen
gers while the Titanic sinks.
"The same Cold War we're
having right now between
Brezhnev and Carter, why? Be
cause they're not able to answer
human rights and human needs
questions in their own societies.
So, what they're doing is creating
a diversion," Chapin contends.
Asked about the presidential
campaign, Chapin humorously
remarked, "Oh boy, can you im
agine choosing between a 19th
-century idealist and a 20th
century prophet? One is an ex
tended childhood and the other
is a bad mechanic."
Though he does not favor
Reagan or Carter for a four-year
term, Chapin did a benefit two
weeks ago in his native New
York for independent candidate
John Anderson.
Chapin also has strong words
of criticism for the music indus
try. He knows that fellow musi
cians could make a greater public
contribution. They, too, are busy
creating diversions. The mention

of current music trends brings a
wry smile to his face.
"You mean New Wave? A
heavyweight at MCA told me
once that New Wave is just loud
television. Again, people just
want to be entertained."
Chapin maintains New Wave
with its noisy color is fulfilling a
large-scale need to forget prob
lems. He said many musicians
begin their careers producing
commercial material hoping to
do something better later on.
"But it only gets tougher later
on. By that time you've sold off
too much," Chapin said.
Chapin firmly believes that the
concerned individual and musi
cian alike can make a difference.
In the past two months he has
played benefits garnering
$700,000 for the World Hunger
Organization, of which he is a
principal founder.
"I'd say there are a hundred
stars who are 'bigger,' more im
portant than I am in terms of
sales and standings on the charts.
But I matter becasue I choose to
do something. Now Bob Dylan
when he was at his peak, he mat
tered . . Chapin said.
Even Dylan can become lostin
the loud displays of music
business concern for the public,
Chapin maintains. "Sometimes,
it's just symbolism. Dylan re
cently played a benefit for UN
ICEF. That concert actually lost
$40,000." The rest of the gross
was eaten up, as is often the case
in such benefits, in overhead,
limosines and union fees, Chapin
explained.
"Do you realize that there are
100 people in the United States
today who are worth $100 mill
ion? They could be the most im
portant people in the world and I
could show them how if they only
cared to matter," Chapin said.
Harry Chapin has a word of
warning'for Stanford students.
Politicians and musicians may be
upholding a weak and faulty sys
tem, much like the "mechanics"
on Harry's Titanic. Young, pro
fessionally bound students, who
don't care, can end up fulfilling
the same fate. Ample food for
thought from the music indus
try's storyteller and conscience.
