# The
						dregs they ain't
## 
### 
If you had enough sense to
read Down Beat, Rolling Stone,
or Guitar Player lately, you'd
have heard of them by now. But
when I hear "The Dixie Who
. . ." for the God-knows-teenth
time, it is apparent that no one
bothers.
Get with the times. Even
Randy Hansen has moved on to
other things. The Dixie Dregs
are current, they're innovators
Originality with a bullet. And
they're coming. Today at 8 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
Critics have said that they
sound like a "country-fried
Mahavishnu Orchestra." Above
all, this should tell you about
how easy it must be to break into
the music-review racket. The
guy was groping for words that
don't exist. See the Dixie Dregs
for yourself.
