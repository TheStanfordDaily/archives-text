# O'Keefe's California
## Astral projections of 'All Night Long' 
### 
The hardest thing about the
Magic Theatre's production of
John O'Keefe's new play All
Night Long is writing about it.
The play is a takeoff on the"nuc
lear family" and, for this
California playwright, "nuclear"
is not used in the purely figura
tive sense: the family of five in
cludes a daughter, Terry, who is
a product of the space program.
She lives inside the wall closet in
which she is plugged to recharge.
The play reminds you of such
skewed reality — like a Ray
Bradbury story-
O'Keefe's Southern Califor
nia family is unusual. Their
dialogue is beyond the stream of
consciousness. It is a mixture of
absurdity, based on daydreams,
and random as well as vindictive
thoughts.
O'Keefe's surreal landscape
has some familiar landmarks.
There is the clumsy father. Jack
(George Coates), who is alwavs

getting parts of his body stuck in
the bathroom sink. There is the
voracious son, Eddy (Michael
Grodenchik), who is perpetually
raiding the refrigerator and is
being picked on by his
classmates. There is the budding
teenage daughter, Tammy (Julie
Jay), who likes to tease her
father, and the mother, Jill (Les
lie Harrell), who either is day
dreaming or reprimanding her
son and whose personality is ex
pressed by her little trinkets on
top of the refrigerator.
The size of the theater and the
set itself, a naturalistic prefab
house, complete with tasteless
furnishings (a pale blue couch
with pink cushions), makes you
feel right at home in California.
Love and death
The play deals essentially with
the family tensions ranging from
incestuous relationships bet
ween mother and son, father and
daughter, to the growing pains of

Tammy.
The dialogue is obscure, some
times incomprehensible, and al
ways "spaced out," but it keeps
you laughing throughout. For
example, when Jill serves blue
jello for dinner, everyone com
pliments her as they squirt the
jello around the room. In
another sequence, Jill talks
about her "REM's," rapid-eye
movements, not only her own,
but of those of everything
around her, even inanimate ob
jects.
The play is kept alive through
the brilliant acting of the whole
cast and the wonderfully im
aginative and surrealistic set, in
which people move freely
through walls and pop up in the
refrigerator or disappear down
the sink. There always are sur
prises, especially in the second
act, when the family members
wander "disembodied" in their
sleep. Windows and doors slam
automatically. Terry is fed on
milk extracted from a huge
breast mounted in the freezer,
(which looks like it has been de
signed by Salvador Dali). Eddy
gets a midnight snack and talks
about the noise of a day on the
street; the room brightens and
sound effects illustrate his point.
In the morning. Jack wants to let
the sun in through the living
room window and discovers a
black mass blocking the view.
The play is California taken to
the extreme, but not "mellow."
It has textural richness which
keeps your mind busy.
John O'Keefe
The Magic Theatre's produc
tion is a world premiere. John

O'Keefe is a relatively unknown
playwright who livus north ot
San Francisco and contributed
two plays to the theater's 1972-
73 season. Chamber Piece and
Jimmy Bean. Talking with him
on the phone is like dealing with
one of his characters. He jumps
from point to point in a never
ending flood of words. The
amusing thing is that he is a be
liever in the very Californiana,
the astral-projection and
transcendental-meditation cul
ture, which Ins play so brilliantly
satirizes.
"I am embracing an open
ended cosmological scheme," he
told me. The play is not a put
down of astral projection, ac
cording to O'Keefe, nor is it a
put-down of the nuclear family.
"It's a picture of what a nuclear
family could be like, just look at
Pygmies: how they argue, it's
wonderful . . ." And O'Keefe is
off: "If the nuclear family dissol
ved, we would dissolve too."
The character of Terri, the
NASA space program off-shoot,
isforhim the"walkingandliving
metaphor of the future. She is
programmed for an ambivalent
future. She doesn't punk rock,"
O'Keefe said.
Whether you agree with
O'Keefe's views of his own work,
you must admit that he is right
when he says that "the play is a
Rorschach test." You see what
you are looking for.

movements, not only her own,
but of those of everything
around her, even inanimate ob
jects.
The play is kept alive through
the brilliant acting of the whole
cast and the wonderfully im
aginative and surrealistic set, in
which people move freely
through walls and pop up in the
refrigerator or disappear down
the sink. There always are sur
prises, especially in the second
act, when the family members
wander "disembodied" in their
sleep. Windows and doors slam
automatically. Terry is fed on
milk extracted from a huge
breast mounted in the freezer,
(which looks like it has been de
signed by Salvador Dali). Eddy
gets a midnight snack and talks
about the noise of a day on the
street; the room brightens and
sound effects illustrate his point.
In the morning. Jack wants to let
the sun in through the living
room window and discovers a
black mass blocking the view.
The play is California taken to
the extreme, but not "mellow."
It has textural richness which
keeps your mind busy.
John O'Keefe
The Magic Theatre's produc
tion is a world premiere. John

O'Keefe is a relatively unknown
playwright who livus north ot
San Francisco and contributed
two plays to the theater's 1972-
73 season. Chamber Piece and
Jimmy Bean. Talking with him
on the phone is like dealing with
one of his characters. He jumps
from point to point in a never
ending flood of words. The
amusing thing is that he is a be
liever in the very Californiana,
the astral-projection and
transcendental-meditation cul
ture, which Ins play so brilliantly
satirizes.
"I am embracing an open
ended cosmological scheme," he
told me. The play is not a put
down of astral projection, ac
cording to O'Keefe, nor is it a
put-down of the nuclear family.
"It's a picture of what a nuclear
family could be like, just look at
Pygmies: how they argue, it's
wonderful . . ." And O'Keefe is
off: "If the nuclear family dissol
ved, we would dissolve too."
The character of Terri, the
NASA space program off-shoot,
isforhim the"walkingandliving
metaphor of the future. She is
programmed for an ambivalent
future. She doesn't punk rock,"
O'Keefe said.
Whether you agree with
O'Keefe's views of his own work,
you must admit that he is right
when he says that "the play is a
Rorschach test." You see what
you are looking for.

Michael Grodenehik in 'All Night Long'
The hardest thing about the
Magic Theatre's production of
John O'Keefe's new play All
Night Long is writing about it.
The play is a takeoff on the"nuc
lear family" and, for this
California playwright, "nuclear"
is not used in the purely figura
tive sense: the family of five in
cludes a daughter, Terry, who is
a product of the space program.
She lives inside the wall closet in
which she is plugged to recharge.
The play reminds you of such
skewed reality — like a Ray
Bradbury story-
O'Keefe's Southern Califor
nia family is unusual. Their
dialogue is beyond the stream of
consciousness. It is a mixture of
absurdity, based on daydreams,
and random as well as vindictive
thoughts.
O'Keefe's surreal landscape
has some familiar landmarks.
There is the clumsy father. Jack
(George Coates), who is alwavs

getting parts of his body stuck in
the bathroom sink. There is the
voracious son, Eddy (Michael
Grodenchik), who is perpetually
raiding the refrigerator and is
being picked on by his
classmates. There is the budding
teenage daughter, Tammy (Julie
Jay), who likes to tease her
father, and the mother, Jill (Les
lie Harrell), who either is day
dreaming or reprimanding her
son and whose personality is ex
pressed by her little trinkets on
top of the refrigerator.
The size of the theater and the
set itself, a naturalistic prefab
house, complete with tasteless
furnishings (a pale blue couch
with pink cushions), makes you
feel right at home in California.
Love and death
The play deals essentially with
the family tensions ranging from
incestuous relationships bet
ween mother and son, father and
daughter, to the growing pains of

Tammy.
The dialogue is obscure, some
times incomprehensible, and al
ways "spaced out," but it keeps
you laughing throughout. For
example, when Jill serves blue
jello for dinner, everyone com
pliments her as they squirt the
jello around the room. In
another sequence, Jill talks
about her "REM's," rapid-eye
movements, not only her own,
but of those of everything
around her, even inanimate ob
jects.
