# Flaws in 'Rivals' — music of 'Ruddigore'
## 
### 
A particular problem with the Manhat
tan Players' production of Sheridan's Re
storation comedy. The Rivals, is that as a
serious dramatic performance it succeeds
only sparsely. Yet. as the unpretentious
product of a non-profit, talent-training
theater group, it is entirely laudable. It is
as wrong to criticize the production's
dramatic failing, without acknowledging
the stature of the artists, as it is to ap
preciate the worthiness and sincerity of
the endeavor without regarding its lack of
dramatic success. The Rivals is a good try.
but it is a bad show.
The script is very funny, as are those of
all Restoration comedies, and stable. The
melodramatic action rests on deception,
intrigue and resolution. There are three
men — one of whom, for the sake of cap
rice, has decided to be two men — vying
for the affections of one woman; there is a
maid whose insincerity and cunning is the
cause of the turmoil; and there is an er
roneously articulate old aunt who is the
butt of the comedy ; and more.
The acting depends entirely depends
upon stylized character portrayal and on
idiomatic peculiarities. Thus the play,
being easily acted and easily enjoyed,
lends itself very well to the purposes and
capabilities of developing actors.

The first act is slow-paced, a fault which
can be attributed to the fact that the audi
ence is as yet uninformed and uninvolved.
The other two acts, however, draw the
audience more into a sense of sympathy
with the characters and their dilemmas,
through the success of a few adroitly re
ndered scenes.
Of particular note are the scenes bet
ween the fitful Sir Anthony Absolute
(Dean Corse) and his placid son. Captain
Jack Absolute (Alan Skantze). Squire
Acres (Scott Enright) is appropriately
gullible and Lydia Languish (Dotty Hol
land) appealingly capricious. Mrs. Malap
rop (Marian Sinton). certainly the most
victimized and comical character in the
play, is portrayed slightly infirmly. Her
personality is pinned too closely to her
pronunciation and, as a consequence, her
character never is quite so full or funny as
her linguistic faux-pax alone. She really
never achieves Sheridan's intended she
dragon air.
Director Judith Dresch rightly keeps
her interpretation of the play close to the
script, modernizing some of the language
and achieving an impressive clarity of ar
ticulation in a play whose verbal quips are
so central.
The production is good as an amiable

exercise in acting
As a serious attempt at drama it is
flawed, but pardonably so.

Ruddigore
Ruddigore is a gun, gree peice of Gil
bert and Sullivan given an audibly beauti
ful, visually lacking production by the
Stanford Savoyards.
This group of students, faculty and staff
traditionally presents works by the mas
ters of British light opera and the charac
teristics of most of their shows holds true
in the current Dinkelspiel Auditorium
run.
The orchestra maintains its position as
the best of its kind on campus. The strings
and percussion, under Peter Jaffe's fer
vent direction, are unusually refined.
The singing also ranks among the high
est heard in campus productions. Several
of the male leads are exceptional; Curtis
Loer as a baronet-in-disguise. Kirk Ride
out as his flaming foster brother, and Dan
Allen as one of the dastardly ancestors of
Ruddigore.

A witch's curse has forced the baronets
of Ruddigore to commit one crime each
day. The thwarted love and intrigues of
the curse's victims and benefactors carry
us through the first act. In the second,
though, the only worthwhile part is the
famous Portrait Gallery scene, in which
celebrities pop out of the frames as Rud
digore ancestors. This year, the cast of
notables includes a glum Andy Geiger
(University athletic director), and jolly
Merton Bernfield (Human Biology
chairman), and two glowering Nobel
laureates, Kenneth Arrow and Burton
Richter.
The costumes are of the right colors —
the maids in pastels, the heroes in white,
the villains in black — but of the wrong
cut: waists are too high, hats fall too low.
The sets look hastily painted and the
lighting is amateurish.
But, close your eyes and delight in the
musical magic and madness — and, truly,
the Savoyards know how to singand bring
an orchestra into the toughest lines glori
ously.
—Mark Rice
Riddigore, or the Witch's Curse, runs this
weekend at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Au
ditorium. Tickets are available at Tresid
der.
