Beckwith urges second rescue try
WASHINGTON — Army Col. Charles Beckwith, who
led the unsuccessful commando raid to free Americans held
in Iran, told members of Congress yesterday that another
rescue mission should be mounted if the hostages can be
located.
"He just said that if we could find out where the hostages
are, we should go back in and pick them up." said Rep.
Samuel Stratton (D-N.Y.) following a three-hour closed
door meeting of the House Armed Services Committee.
The 50 American hostages who had been held at the U.S.
Embassy since last November were moved, scattered
among a number of Iranian cities after the commando
group's aborted effort to rescue them.
Beckwith, called before the House panel to give details of
the aborted mission, also was quoted as saying that taking
more than eight helicopters on the mission would have
made the operation too cumbersome.
Three of the eight choppers taken on the mission broke
down and the operation was scrubbed.
"Beckwith said he was satisfied with eight because if you
add more it takes more Cl3os (cargo planes) to fuel them
and makes the whole thing too cumbersome for stealth."
said Rep. William Dickinson (R-Ala.).
Stratton quoted Beckwith as saying he aborted the effort
when the three helicopters broke down, since if he had
continued the operation he would have had to leave 15 to
18 of his commandos behind.
"He said every man had several jobs to do and he just
could not figure how he could go in with 15 or 18 fewer
men," Stratton said.
"Obviously, he was very upset at not being able to carry it
out," Stratton said.
But he said he believes Beckwith convinced the commit
tee that he and not some higher authority actually decided
the mission had to be canceled.
"Once he said the mission would not go, that was it."
Stratton said. He said Beckwith told the committee the
helicopter pilots and commandos did not argue with the
decision.
Cuban placement program to begin
EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla. — The first of
thousands of Cuban refugees living temporarily in a north
western Florida tent city may begin moving into American
towns today, officials say.
"That's a darn good possibility," site director Norman
Steinlauf of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
said yesterday. The federal agency is coordinating all fed
eral activities in the processing.
The four-acre makeshift tent community, just a few miles
from downtown Fort Walton Beach, continues to grow as
hundreds of military engineers and construction workers
labor around the clock to erect 18-by-52-foot tents which
house 25 to 35 people.
More than 2000 refugees were packed into the center by
midday yesterday and another 500 were expected by day's
end. being flown from Key West, the entry point into this
country.
As soon as a refugee receives clearance from immigration
officials and has both a sponsor and transportation to the
sponsor's city, he is free to leave the tent city beginning
today, Steinlauf said. The clearance involves a security
check and medical examinations.
Steinlauf said 17 new arrivals were detained at Santa
Rosa County Jail after investigators learned they were sus
pected of "having committed crime in Cuba . . . the full
gamut from petty theft to assault and possibly murder."
One man was "pulled back" after it was determined he
was not a criminal as first suspected. Steinlauf said.
Three male refugees reiterated the claim of many that
President Fidel Castro has permitted convicts to leave the

country via the Mariel-to-Key West sealift.
Reagan, Carter expect victories
Voters in North Carolina, Tennessee and Indiana are
expected to give a big push today to Ronald Reagan's
unrelenting drive toward the Republican presidential
nomination, and move President Jimmy Carter closer to
ward renomination for a second term.
Only in the District of Columbia is Reagan's rival,
George Bush, given a chance of making a close race in what
are fast becoming the closing days of competition for the
GOP nomination.
Similarly. Carter is the easy favorite in North Carolina,
Tennessee and Indiana, and Sen. Edward Kennedy is rated
likely to win in the district, the city where the president lives
and works.
Seeking to limit the size of Reagan's expected victories in
the Southern states, Bush campaigned hard in North
Carolina over the weekend and began a four-stop tour
across Tennessee yesterday.
Bush conceded the best he could hope for would be about
one-third of Tennessee's 32 delegates to the Republican
National Convention at Detroit in July.
Despite the stark evidence of Reagan's ever-growing
count of convention delegates. Bush insisted the former
California governor's strength could melt before the GOP
nomination is awarded.
Bush, a former U.N. ambassador, contends many Reagan
delegates have grown dissatisfied and could defect before
the convention.
Congressman obeys Papal order
NEWTON. Mass. — Squeezed between his career as a
congressman and his duties as a priest. Rep. Robert Drinan
said yesterday he will obey a Vatican order to quit politics.
He said giving up the priesthood for politics would be
"unthinkable."
A Jesuit and an outspoken liberal Democrat, Drinan had
planned to seek reelection to his sixth term from Mas
sachusetts' 4th Congressional District. He will leave office
in January.
He received word from the Jesuits at the Vatican during
the weekend that under the policy of Pope John Paul 11, he
no longer would be allowed to run for office.
"It is with regret and pain that I accept the decision of the
Holy See," the 59-year-old priest said at a news conference
yesterday.
"I am proud and honored to be a priest and a Jesuit,"
Drinan said. "As a person of faith I must believe there is
work for me to do which somehow will be more important
than the work 1 am required to leave."
Drinan was the first congressman to seek the impeach
ment of former President Richard Nixon. Known for his
opposition to the Vietnam War and the draft, and his advo
cacy of civil liberties and social services including federal
financing of abortions, Drinan said he was "grateful for
these opportunities to be a moral architect."
"I can think of no other activities more worthy of the
involvement of a priest and a Jesuit," he said. "I undertake
this new pilgrimage with pain and with prayers."
Asked if he considered leav ing the priesthood to continue
in politics, Drinan. ordained 27 years ago, responded
firmly: "No. It's just unthinkable."
Israelis mourn as tension grows
JERUSALEM — In a show of force that underscored the
Jewish insistence on the right to live in Hebron, some 3000
Israelis gathered in the West Bank city yesterday to bury an
American-born ex-GI who was among six persons slain
there Friday night.
Eli Ha'zeev, 32, nicknamed "the wolf' in Vietnam and
called that here, served seven months in an Israeli prison

last year for assaulting Hebron Arabs. His funeral was
among three yesterday, for victims of the Friday attack by
the Palestinian underground.
The services were held as confrontation and violence
continued in the fallout from the Friday attack. Among
yesterday's developments:
— Sporadic anti-Israeli demonstrations spread across the
West Bank. Israeli troops fired shots in the air and used tear
gas to disperse a protest at a girl's school in El Bireh. Roads
were blocked and stones thrown at Israeli vehicles in several
Arab cities.
— Egyptian-Israeli-U.S. talks on a proposed autonomy
for Israeli-occupied territories faltered and nearly failed in
clashes over security matters — on which Egypt demands
concessions that Israel refuses to make.
— Defense Minister Ezer Weizman defended the gov
ernment's West Bank policies at a chaotic meeting of the
Israeli Knesset on the Friday killings. Despite cat calls and
interruptions, Weizman urged moderation: "Let's find a
way to live together in the land of Israel, both Jews and
Arabs."
But the violence resulting from the slayings — and from
Israel's deportation in reprisal of two popular West Bank
mayors — grew worse yesterday.
EPA issues rules to control waste
WASHINGTON — The Environmental Protection
Agency yesterday took its "best shot" at controlling the
nation's flood of toxic waste, issuing regulations to define it
and say how it must be handled in the future.
But critics immediately charged that EPA had already
missed the mark by exempting far too many small waste
generators and leaving too many chemicals out of the rules.
Eckardt Beck, EPA's assistant administrator for water

and waste management, said the rules, a stack 8 inches high,
were probably the most complex the U.S. government had
ever put together. They cover 501 hazardous chemicals,
wastes and waste processes and will cost industry about $1
billion to implement. Beck told a news conference.
But the costs are small compared with the price of doing
nothing, he added. It is now estimated that it may take $ 124
million to clean up the abandoned Love Canal site in New
York.
In a statement EPA administrator Douglas Costle pre
dicted that the new procedures to track the wastes "will turn
up information and situations which will shock our nation"
regarding past practices.
Dow up 5.38 as .prime rate falls
NEW YORK — Stock prices moved up yesterday amid
falling interest rates and more signs of trouble for the
American economy.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 5.38
to 816.30, and would have been up 3.09 more except for
divident payments by six companies included in the aver
age.
Advancing stocks led decliners by a 2-1 margin in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
Big Board volume was a moderate 34.09 million shares,
up from 28.04 million in the previous session.
The prime lending rate dipped yesterday to its lowest
level in two months when Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., the
nation's fifth-largest bank, cut its rate one point to \l x /i
percent.
Some banks matched the new rate and others made smal
ler cuts to 18 percent, but most stayed at the prevailing rate
of IBV2 percent, which was set last week.
