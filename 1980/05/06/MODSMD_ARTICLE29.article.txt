Nameplate missing
A small brass plate, about 2x5 inches, part of the old
Stanford clock tower, has disappeared. The historical
souvenir is to be part of an exhibit in the engineering library.

It was awaiting cleaning when discovered missing. Anyone
with information about the plate should contact Jim Adams
in engineering.
Frisbee-a-thon
This weekend the residents of Burbank in Stern will
conduct a 48-hour "Frisbee-a-thon," as a benefit for the
Stanford Children's Hospital. The dorm hopes to raise
$2000 from pledges of money for each hour of continuous
Frisbee throwing.
