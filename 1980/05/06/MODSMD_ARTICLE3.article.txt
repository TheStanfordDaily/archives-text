# Democratic caucuses elect two students as potential delegates

Two University students each finished fourth in local
caucus balloting held Sunday to select delegates to the
Democratic National Convention.
Sophomore Brad Crystal, a political science major, gar
nered 34 of 84 votes cast at the presidential nominating
caucus for President Jimmy Carter, held at Carpenters'
Union Hall in Mountain View. At the same time, junior
Mark Agnew took 38 votes from a similar assembly of 109
Edward Kennedy supporters at Mountain View High
School.
Caucuses were held this week in each congressional dis
trict throughout the state to choose California's potential
representative at this summer's New York City convention.
All registered Democrats in each district were eligible to
attend their respective meetings. The members of each
group then cast exactly five votes apiece to elect four pros
pective delegates and one alternate.
The precise makeup of each region's official delegation
will be determined by the percentage of that district voting
for Carter or Kennedy in the June 3 primary. Five delegates
from the 12th district will attend the summer convention.
Because the state must be equally represented by men
and women, men and women competed separately at the
caucuses. A coin toss fixed the delegate ranking between
the sexes. The women won the flip at both the Carter and
Kennedy 12th District caucuses, giving the top three
women vote-getters the first, third and alternate positions.
The two leading men earned the second and fourth poten
tial delegate spots.

Running on a slate with the highest two women vote
getters, Crystal assumed the men's runner-up role a mere
three points behind former 1977-78 Stanford Council of
Presidents member Steve Westly. Thus, Crystal, the head of
the Stanford Carter/Mondale Campaign Committee, is the
fourth in line as a 12th District Carter delegate.
A presidential contender needs 20 percent of a district's
primary vote to receive one delegate. So, if Carter receives
more than 80 percent of this district's Democratic primary
ballots, Crystal will be eligible to vote at the national con
vention.
Agnew, the Kennedy Student/Youth Campaign coor
dinator for Northern California, won the same position on
the Kennedy slate, running a mere one vote behind the
first-place man at the Kennedy caucus. Assessing his
chances of gaining a delegate slot as slim, Agnew said that
he will attend the June 21 state Democratic convention. At
that time, 69 at-large delegates will be selected.
"It's usually very political," said Agnew ot the state meet
ing. "The VIPs in district politics are usually chosen as
delegates," he explained. The state assemblage also is the
time when minority quotas are filled. "I'm going to try to
argue that students are a minority," Agnew said.
Other Stanford students aspiring to delegate posts were
freshman Gary Hallee, sophomore Joe Calderazzo and his
tory graduate student Ted Andrews for Kennedy, and
first-year law student Pete Fischer for Carter. Hallee failed
to show at the Kennedy caucus, while Andrews and Cal
derazzo pledged their support to Agnew. But because of a
delay in the mail, Fischer's petition did not meet the filing
deadline, and his name was absent from the ballot.
