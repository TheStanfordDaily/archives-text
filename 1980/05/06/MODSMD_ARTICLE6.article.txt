# Scholars see few immediate threats
## Yugoslavia's future uncertain without Tito 
### 
From the Daily wire services with staff reports
As the funeral train carried his body
to Belgrade yesterday, Yugoslavia's
late President Josip Broz Tito was
hailed around the world as one of the
great leaders of the era. But leaders
and scholars also expressed concern
over the future of the country Tito un

ited amid the chaos of World War 11.
and the effects Yugoslavian instability
might have on the rest of Europe.
"They kept him alive for so long I
thought he was immortal," said Stan
ford Political Science Prof. Jan Triska.
"It's too bad. he was a great man."
Tito would have been 88 years old
tomorrow.
President Jimmy Carter called Tito a
"towering figure on the world stage,"
while in Peking the Chinese press ac
corded Tito more attention than has
been granted any other foreign leader
in recent memory.
Tito's death leaves questions about
the future of the Eastern European
state.
Yugoslavia is a conglomeration of
eight ethnic groups. The problem, ac
cording to Triska, is that without Tito,
the country could fall apart.
Yugoslavia is also strategically im
portant; since 1948 it has been the only

European communist state free from
Soviet control. American officials pub
licly expressed concern that in the
post-Tito era, the Soviets may try to
align Yugoslavia with the Warsaw pact
â€” a move that could have ominous
consequences for the East-West power
balance.
But Alexander Dallin, a history pro
fessor here, said that the fears of an
immediate crisis have been exagger
ated.
Tito's long illness (he had been in the
hospital since January) allowed the
transition of power in the country to
occur before the leader actually died,
according to Dallin.
He added that this would be a bad
time for the Soviets to try to intervene
in Yugoslavia either militarily or politi
cally. "If anything, Afghanistan helps
the Yugoslavs," he said. "The Soviets
have themselves tied down elsewhere."
Dallin also said that while Yugos

lavia does have a potential problem in
holding together its ethnic minorities,
these groups have in common a hatred
of the Soviets. The groups most reluc
tant to be Yugoslavs are also the most
anti-Russian, he said.
While Triska predicted that there
will soon be nationalistic movements
forming among the Yugoslavian ethnic
groups, he also belittled the dartger of
Soviet interference in the near future.
"They (the Russians) will wait," he
said. "They like to be invited from the
inside."
Before he died, Tito installed a com
plex system of joint leadership to rule
the country in his stead. Lazar
Kolisevski, 66, was installed as "presi
dent of the presidency" at a televised
meeting of the ruling body called only
hours after Tito died. But he was ex
pected to serve as president for only 13
days, when he will be replaced under
the rotating system.
He had been running the country as
vice president of the presidency during
Tito's four-month illness.
Cvijetin Mijatovic, 67, the represen
tative of Bosnia-Herzegovina, was
namedvice president at the same meet
ing Sunday. He was expected to suc
ceed Kolisevski as president on May
16, when the one-year term Kolisevski
had been serving as vice president ex
pires.
Kolisevski will remain a member of
the collective presidency as the rep
resentative of Macedonia until 1984,

when the five-year terms of office of all
members of the expire.
Mijatovic and future presidents of
the presidency will serve one-year
terms under Tito's system, designed to
keep the widely varying regions of the
country together and prevent any one
person from gaining too much power.
The presidency includes representa
tives of each of Yugoslavia's six states
and two autonomous provinces plus a
representative of the Communist
Party.
Tito was both president-for-life and
party president.
Triska said it is difficult to predict
how well the coalition will run the

country. The system looks good on
paper, he said.
Triska lauded Tito for building a
socialist state that was not "excessive."
He called the regime a responsible one.
Unlike the other states in Eastern
Europe, Yugoslavia's workers went
abroad and returned voluntarily, he
added.
Tito's unique brand of socialism was
marked by a market economy, open
borders, worker self-management, and
home rule for all republics and regions
that constitute Yugoslavia. In foreign
policy he insisted on independence and
nonalignment.
