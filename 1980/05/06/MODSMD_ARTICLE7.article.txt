## Spring elections start today 
### Rob Lempert News Editor 
Elections for ASSU Senate, senior
class presidents and positions on the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) will be held today and tomor
row.
Also on the ballot will be a fee as
sessment request for the ASSU Speak
ers Bureau, which is seeking an addi
tional quarter's assessment. The or
ganization's original two-quarter re
quest was approved by voters in the
April election.
The BARB and Frolic on the Farm
slates will face each other in the run-off
election for the senior class presidents
office.
Frolic on the Farm slate members
are Bill Kemmeries, Mary Ellen Rielly,
Ina Coleman, and Jamie Halper. The
BARB slate includes Jeff Bell, Aleen
Zimberoff, Renee Richards, and Mark
Breier.
There are 49 undergraduates run
ning for the 10 undergraduate seats
and 10 alternate positions on the se
nate. Eleven graduate students are
running for 10 senate seats and a possi
ble 10 alternate positions. Five stu
dents are also running for three spots
on the SCLC, which is empowered to
alter the Honor Code and other parts
of the legislative and judicial charters.
The spring senate election is a result
of the constitutional amendment ap

proved in April which moved the an
nual senate election from the fall to the
spring. The senate elected this week
will officially begin its term in June and
serve through the end of the next
school year. Next spring the senate bal
loting will coincide with the Council of
Presidents election in April.
Because of difficulties in the last
ASSU election, the ballot procedure
has been changed. Instead of the com
puter cards usually used, the ballot will

be BV2XII sheets with the names of the
candidates printed on them.
In order for the fee assessment to be
approved, at least 20 percent of the
students here must vote. This means
approximately 2300 voters must visit
the polls today and tomorrow.
All registered students are eligible to
vote for all measures except in the
senior class president race, for which
only juniors can cast ballots.
