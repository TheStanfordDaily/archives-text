# ASSU election turnout weak
## 
### 
Voter turnout was poor in yesterday's ASSU Senate
elections with only S to 9 percent of the student body
casting ballots. Elections Commissioner Doug Mitchell
said last night.
Another 12 percent will be needed today for the result
of the Speakers Bureau Fee Assessment request to be
valid. The ASSU requires that 20 percent of the student
body vote on fee assessment issues for them to be valid.
Turnout was fair at some of the polling places yester
day, Mitchell said. A major exception was the voting
table at the Business School where only four persons
voted between 1 1 a.m. and I p.m. That booth will not be
open today.
Popular P.O.
The most popular voting spot on campus was the Post
Office where 550 students cast their ballots yesterday.
Mitchell said that while "it will be tough to get the 20
percent" today, he was confident that with banners and
heavy publicity by other commissioners a sufficient
number of votes would be rounded up.
Commissioners discovered last night that the compu
ter they had rented from a Millbrae firm to count the

ballots was not working properly and they planned to
take the machine back today and rent a new one.
Big trouble
"We're certainly glad we tried it out," Mitchell said
last night. "II we'd waited until 6 p.m. Wednesday to
count ballots and then had nowhere to take the compu
ter, we'd be in big trouble."
He said the computer they were using last night was
miscounting ballots, forcing them to work slowly and
double check all counts.
\ The commissioners apologized publicly for accidently
omitting the statements from candidates Amin Lahkani
and Bobby Lapin from the Election Pamphlet and for
misspelling Julie Kulhanian's name on the ballot.
"Otherwise, things have been pretty good during this
election," Mitchell said.
The spring ballot includes names of candidates for
ASSU Senate, senior class presidents and positions on
the Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC). a
body empowered to alter the Honor Code and othor
parts of the legislative and judicial charters.


The most popular ballot box yesterday was at the
Post Office, where over 500 students turned out
for the first day of voting for such things as ASSU

senators and a fee assessment. Overall turnout was
rather low, though, with only about 9 percent of
the student body voting.
