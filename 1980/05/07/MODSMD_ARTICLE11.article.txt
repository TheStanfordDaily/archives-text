NAIROBI. Kenya — are not as
numerous as the Cubans or as prominent
as the Russians, but thousands of East
Germans are in black Africa these days,
gaining influence in the continent's radi
cal states and liberation movements.
To their critics, they represent a sinister
force, a front for Moscow that establishes
propaganda networks and repressive sec
urity apparatuses wherever there is tur
moil and instability.
Their friends view them as they view
Cubans, a progressive ally that sends sol
diers and doctors to corgbat colonialism
and racism.

"They are our best friends," Joshua
Nkomo said last year, when he was lead
ing a guerrilla army in the civil war in
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
Western diplomatic sources estimate
that East Germany's "Afrika Korps"
numbed as many as 10,000 men, about
evenly divided among military advisers
and civilian technicians and professionals.
Their presence and the aid they offer is

believed to be underwritten by the Soviet
Union.
"They may take the initiative from time
to time on their own, but I think it's safe to
assume that they don't do much without
the consent of Moscow." an intelligence
gatherer said.
Brotherhood-in-arms
East Germany's active involvement
here began a dozen years ago when it sent
pilots to fly missions for Nigeria against
secessionists. Since then, the At-,
rican operation — code-named
"Brotherhood-in-Arms" — has become
increasingly bold. President Erich Hon
ecker said during one of his two visits to
Africa last year that East Germans are
there to furnish "arms and bread" for the
peoples of Africa.
That may have been an exaggeration,
but the East Germans are playing key
roles in governments and armies spread
from Ethiopia to Angola and Mozam
bique. They also are benefactors of guer
rilla groups agitating for the downfall of
the white-minority South African gov
ernment. South Africa's prime minister.
Pieter W. Botha, calls them a part of the

"Communist onslaught" organized by the
Soviet Union.

His contempt is not surprising. The Af
rican National Congress, an anti-Soiffh
Africa movement, has one of its most im
portant offices in East Berlin and East
German soldiers in Angola are training
and advising guerrillas of the South-West
Africa Peoples Organization lighting in
Namibia, a territory controlled bv South
Atrican arms. In the guerrilla war against
the former Rhodesian government, the
East Germans operated tanks, artillery
and ground-to-air missiles and in Angola
they have flown MIGs against anti
government rebels.'
The East German Communists pro
vided soldiers and guns for the liberation
movements that eventually came to
power in Angola, Mozambique and
Guinea-Bissau, and Western analysts be
lieve the East Germans not only or
ganized the ill-fated 1978 invasion of
Zaire by Angola-based Katangan rebels
but also sent tanks to the border to protect
the retreating Katangese.

The assistance is largely militarily
oriented, not developmental, a practice
most Communist nations follow. From
1970 to 1980, for instance, the Warsaw
Pact countries gave African nations $3.4
billion in nonmilitary services and aid.
The countries of the European Economic
Community gave $21 billion during the
same period and West Germany alone
gave $4.2 billion. Western aid officials
said.
Aside from providing combat help.
East Germany's most frequent role is in
security and propaganda. In Ethiopia,
Angola and Mozambique, it has trained
fearsome secret police forces and oper
ated internal security systems. Its advisers
also have held key positions in the minis
tries of information and dozens of African
journalists have been trained in East Ber
lin.
In addition to their military role, the
East Germans, like the Cubans, provided
doctors, teachers and technical assistants
to countries in the Soviet sphere of influ
ence and operate modest agricultural pro
ject.

as the Russians, but thousands of East
Germans are in black Africa these days,
gaining influence in the continent's radi
cal states and liberation movements.
To their critics, they represent a sinister
force, a front for Moscow that establishes
propaganda networks and repressive sec
urity apparatuses wherever there is tur
moil and instability.
Their friends view them as they view
Cubans, a progressive ally that sends sol
diers and doctors to corgbat colonialism
and racism.
Best friends
"They are our best friends," Joshua
Nkomo said last year, when he was lead
ing a guerrilla army in the civil war in
Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.
Western diplomatic sources estimate
that East Germany's "Afrika Korps"
numbed as many as 10,000 men, about
evenly divided among military advisers
and civilian technicians and professionals.
Their presence and the aid they offer is

believed to be underwritten by the Soviet
Union.
"They may take the initiative from time
to time on their own, but I think it's safe to
assume that they don't do much without
the consent of Moscow." an intelligence
gatherer said.
Brotherhood-in-arms
East Germany's active involvement
here began a dozen years ago when it sent
pilots to fly missions for Nigeria against
secessionists. Since then, the At-,
rican operation — code-named
"Brotherhood-in-Arms" — has become
increasingly bold. President Erich Hon
ecker said during one of his two visits to
Africa last year that East Germans are
there to furnish "arms and bread" for the
peoples of Africa.
That may have been an exaggeration,
but the East Germans are playing key
roles in governments and armies spread
from Ethiopia to Angola and Mozam
bique. They also are benefactors of guer
rilla groups agitating for the downfall of
the white-minority South African gov
ernment. South Africa's prime minister.
Pieter W. Botha, calls them a part of the

"Communist onslaught" organized by the
Soviet Union.
/aire invasion
His contempt is not surprising. The Af
rican National Congress, an anti-Soiffh
Africa movement, has one of its most im
portant offices in East Berlin and East
German soldiers in Angola are training
and advising guerrillas of the South-West
Africa Peoples Organization lighting in
Namibia, a territory controlled bv South
Atrican arms. In the guerrilla war against
the former Rhodesian government, the
East Germans operated tanks, artillery
and ground-to-air missiles and in Angola
they have flown MIGs against anti
government rebels.'
The East German Communists pro
vided soldiers and guns for the liberation
movements that eventually came to
power in Angola, Mozambique and
Guinea-Bissau, and Western analysts be
lieve the East Germans not only or
ganized the ill-fated 1978 invasion of
Zaire by Angola-based Katangan rebels
but also sent tanks to the border to protect
the retreating Katangese.

The assistance is largely militarily
oriented, not developmental, a practice
most Communist nations follow. From
1970 to 1980, for instance, the Warsaw
Pact countries gave African nations $3.4
billion in nonmilitary services and aid.
The countries of the European Economic
Community gave $21 billion during the
same period and West Germany alone
gave $4.2 billion. Western aid officials
said.
Aside from providing combat help.
East Germany's most frequent role is in
security and propaganda. In Ethiopia,
Angola and Mozambique, it has trained
fearsome secret police forces and oper
ated internal security systems. Its advisers
also have held key positions in the minis
tries of information and dozens of African
journalists have been trained in East Ber
lin.
In addition to their military role, the
East Germans, like the Cubans, provided
doctors, teachers and technical assistants
to countries in the Soviet sphere of influ
ence and operate modest agricultural pro
ject.
