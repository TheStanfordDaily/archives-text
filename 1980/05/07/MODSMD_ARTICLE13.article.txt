BUDAPEST. Hungary — Dr. Ferenc Fulep. director
of the Hungarian National Museum, is sure that there is
nothing mystical about the Crown of St. Stephen.
But he concedes that many people, especially older
people, do not agree with him.
The crown, which is fashioned of gold, encrusted with
precious jewels and topped with a bent cross, has drawn
the largest crowds in the museum's 178 years. Roughly
1.4 million people, more than one-third of them foreig
ners, have come to see it since it was returned to Hun
gary on Jan. 5, 1978.
The return of the crown, along with other emblems
and insignia, ended 32 years of exile, mostly in the
United States, that began in July 1945. when Col. Ernest
Paitas, commander of the Hungarian Royal Crown
Guard, spirited the valuables out of the country to keep
them from falling into the hands of advancing Soviet
troops.
The Hungarians, World War II allies of Nazi Ger
many, feared that the Russians would take the crown to
Moscow as war loot. But the crown and the other valu
ables were turned over to U .S. forces in Germany, then

taken to Fort Knox for safekeeping.
"The Amerieans took good care of the crown," Fulep
said. "We were afraid that it would come back in poor
condition, but we were very pleased when we examined
it."
Demands refused
For three decades the U.S. government refused the
demands of Hungary's postwar Communist government
that the crown be returned. It was thought that com
pliance would signify U.S. approval of the Communist
rulers, for it has long been considered the embodiment
of Hungarian sovereignty. No ruler has been accepted as
legitimate without it.
Opposition to returning the crown came mainly from
Americans of Hungarian descent and Hungarian
emigres who had fled their homeland during and after
the 1956 uprising that left about 20,000 dead.
Roman Catholics everywhere were opposed to return
ing the crown because of the church's bitter feud with the
Communist regime that was dramatized by Cardinal
Joszef Mindszenty's 15-year stay in the U.S. Embassy
here. The cardinal took refuge with the Americans to
escape a life prison sentence for his opposition to the
regime.

To the devout, the crown symbolizes opposition to
non-believers. The United States agreed to return the
irown and other symbols after Hungary's oppressive
regime gradually developed into one of the most liberal
in the Communist world. Hungary's 10.6 million in
habitants liow enjoy a relatively high degree of social,
economic and religious freedom.
The regime has apparently lived up to its promise to
keep the crown on display. Since being placed on exhibit
on Jan. 31, 1978, it has been seen by more people than at
any time in its long history. Fulep said the crown wal on
public display only once before, for two days in I^3B.
Crown is genuine
The crown is the centerpiece in the museum's main
exhibit hall. It is seated under glass on a raised platform
covered with red velvet. The velvet extends over other
platforms of varying height that hold the other items.
The crown s gold bands, pearls, precious stones and
(Small enameled plates showing religious scenes glow in
the beam of a spotlight.
1 here is no question that the crown and its parts are
genuine, Fulep said.
"After its return, we had a specialist who had
examined the crown in 1938 look at it again," he said.
"We are convinced that all the pieces are geniune."
