# Gov't agencies to ban PCBs in food machinery
##

The Washington Post
WASHINGTON — The fed
eral government will propose
Friday that all old electrical
\ transformers containing the
deadly chemical PCBs be re
moved from food production
and feed facilities nationwide at
the owners' expense.
Untold thousands of the out
dated'transformers and hun
dreds of thousands of electric
capacitors are thought to be
either in use or stored around the
country, harboring the
polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) like deadly traps waiting
to be sprung.
In regulations scheduled for
Friday publication in the Federal
Register, the Environmental
Protection Agency, the Food
and Drug Administration and
the Department of Agriculture
will order that all thpse old parts
be turned in to the government.
The proposed regulations,
which would go into effect a year
after becoming final, would
cover fertilizer and pesticide
processing and manufacturing
facilities, food and feed produc
tion, slaughter houses and other
food processing operations
under the FDA's Food Safety
and Quality Service Jurisdiction.
Industries affected will be

given 90 days in which to com
ment.
PCB-contuminated feed
PCBs spilled Jrom a damaged,
forgotten transformer in a stor
age shed in Billings. Mont., last
summer and>got into human and
animal feed that went to 17
states. Assistant Agriculture
Secretary Carol Tucker Foreman
told a House hearing last Sep
tember that the incident was
quickly detected, but only by
chance, and that even so.
400.000 pounds of poultry,
16.000 pounds of pork and
73.000 pounds of egg products
had to be taken off the market.
The agencies decided in the
wake of that incident to get rid of
the transformers still in use
around food plants, according to
Steven D. Jell inek, assistant ad
ministrator for pesticides and
toxic substances at EPA.
PCBs are suspected cancer
causing chemicals that have been
linked to skin and liver disease,
bone problems and other ail
ments. They were banned from
new uses in 1977 but had been
used for years as a lubricant and
high-temperature coolant in in
dustrial machinery and electrical
equipment. The Environmental
Defense Fund has estimated that
275 million gallons of PCBs in
transformers are currently in

use.
"PCBs arc very hazardous."
said Jellinek in confirming the
impending announcement.
"They are everywhere, they ac
cumulate in human tissue and
they don't degrade in the envi
ronment." They are so persis
tent. in tact,'that the only known
way to get rid of them is by incin
eration at high temperatures. No
PCB incinerators currently exist.
Under the new requirements,
storage and use of equipment
containing oils with more than
50 parts per million of PCBs will

he prohibited. Anyone using
such equipment now or storing it
will have to get it to an approved
landfill or to a storage facility tor
eventual incineration, Jellinek
said.
Jellinek said that h\ the time
the rules go into effect, EPA will
have at least one and possibly
two or more PCB incinerators
available to dispose of the mate
rial.
Current regulations
* Existing regulations promul
gated tv\o years ago govern

proper storage and transport of
PCB-related material and
should cover the possibility of
accidents while the regulations
are being obeyed. Jellinek con
tinued. "Most of the spills we've
had so far. like the one in Mon
tana. involved improper storage
or transport." he said.
Penalties for violation ot the
new rules are set under the Toxic
Substances Control Act (TSCA)
at $25,000 per day per violation.
Jellinek said inspectors of all
three agencies would participate
in enforcing the new rules.

quickly detected, but only by
chance, and that even so.
400.000 pounds of poultry,
16.000 pounds of pork and
73.000 pounds of egg products
had to be taken off the market.
The agencies decided in the
wake of that incident to get rid of
the transformers still in use
around food plants, according to
Steven D. Jell inek, assistant ad
ministrator for pesticides and
toxic substances at EPA.
PCBs are suspected cancer
causing chemicals that have been
linked to skin and liver disease,
bone problems and other ail
ments. They were banned from
new uses in 1977 but had been
used for years as a lubricant and
high-temperature coolant in in
dustrial machinery and electrical
equipment. The Environmental
Defense Fund has estimated that
275 million gallons of PCBs in
transformers are currently in

use.
"PCBs arc very hazardous."
said Jellinek in confirming the
impending announcement.
"They are everywhere, they ac
cumulate in human tissue and
they don't degrade in the envi
ronment." They are so persis
tent. in tact,'that the only known
way to get rid of them is by incin
eration at high temperatures. No
PCB incinerators currently exist.
Under the new requirements,
storage and use of equipment
containing oils with more than
50 parts per million of PCBs will

he prohibited. Anyone using
such equipment now or storing it
will have to get it to an approved
landfill or to a storage facility tor
eventual incineration, Jellinek
said.
Jellinek said that h\ the time
the rules go into effect, EPA will
have at least one and possibly
two or more PCB incinerators
available to dispose of the mate
rial.
Current regulations
* Existing regulations promul
gated tv\o years ago govern

proper storage and transport of
PCB-related material and
should cover the possibility of
accidents while the regulations
are being obeyed. Jellinek con
tinued. "Most of the spills we've
had so far. like the one in Mon
tana. involved improper storage
or transport." he said.
Penalties for violation ot the
new rules are set under the Toxic
Substances Control Act (TSCA)
at $25,000 per day per violation.
Jellinek said inspectors of all
three agencies would participate
in enforcing the new rules.
