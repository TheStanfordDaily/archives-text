Felix Cireene, the British au
thor and filmmaker who was a
personal friend to Mao Zedong
and Zhou Enlai, spoke to an uu
.dience of about 200 about his
impressions on China sinee the
overthrow of the Gang of Four in
197h, at Braun Auditorium last
Wednesday.
The Gang of Four, an ex
tremist faction led by Mao's
widow Jiang .ling tried unsuc
cessfully to take power following
Zhou Enlai's death in 1976.
Greene was the first Wes
terner to be granted a personal
interview with premier Hua
Guo-feng, who has for the most
part remained behind the scenes
according to Greene.
"I was ready to be unimpre
ssed." said Greene about his in
terview at Una's house on the
outskirts of Peking but added

that his opinion changed rather
quickly. "Hua has none of that
outward charisma but what im
pressed me is that he was very
frank without a sense of self
importance."
According to Greene, Hua
keeps his private life to himself,
even his wife is unknown to his
colleagues. Green said it took
him a good deal of convincing to
persuade Hua to let him photo
graph his one-room birthplace.
Hua did not have any photo
graphs of himselt as a child since
his family was too poor. Hua's
formal education ended when he
was I 3 and by the age of 1 7 he
was already fighting with Mao's
forces.
"You get a sense that he is in
control." said Greene as here- ,
called being invited to the Great
Hall of the people in Peking.
Most of the Chinese leadership
are old men that could barely
stand up as the crowd thousands
strong gave them an ovation. At
59 Hua is the youngest and the
most vital of the Chinese leader
ship, according to Greene.
"When you see a headline in
the Los Angeles Times that
Maoists have been purged in the
leadership," said Greene, "there
has probably not been a purge
but age has forced one of Mao's
contemporaries into retire
ment."
What impressed Greene the
most in his recent trip to China
was the openness of China
since the overthrow of the Gang
ot Four. "There is much more
open discussion and admission of
mistakes and the Chinese ha\e
stopped that grueling language

about 'imperialists and craven
lackeys."
Greene charged that the
American media has presented a
false picture. "Journalists have
paid too much attention to
Democracy Wall." The impor
tance of this wall in the middle of
Peking where anybody could
hang up grievances has been
exaggerated.
Democracy Wall became?' The
Speaker's Corner of Peking, a
place where you could say any
thing but there is hardly any
reason to take what was said very
seriously. Ii is the very attention
that the media gave to Democ
racy Wall that forced the leader
ship to remove it.
The West has put too much
emphasis on democracy and
human rights according to s
Greene,"to change people is dif
ficult and there is a real problem
in China of how to get rid of the
dependence that Chinese feel on
their leadership." As in the West
leadership had been considered
for centuries a mandate from
heaven. "After all," said
Greene, "votes for women came
in my lifetime and let us re
member that a hundred years
ago a man could be hung in Eng
land for stealing a sheep."
Hua faces enormous pres
sures: the rising expectations of
the young who anO tired of the
austere aspects of levolutionary
life and the need to broaden the
decision making element in the
society and to formulate a con
stitution.
There are internal as well as
external pressures. China's
population in spite of Mao's and
Chou's birth control policies is
still adding an extra 18 million
people every year. With tne
move toward modernization
there has been an increase in un
employment and so Chinese
leadership is starting to move
population to where it is needed.
There has been an increase in the
crime rate especially among the
young but it is miniscule com
pared to the West. From the out
side China faces 34 combat
ready divisions on the Soviet
border and a strong Vietnam.
Overall, "the Chinese have
not lost am of their enthusiasm.
They are certain that they are
building a new society and are
determined for it never to be
come a 'me first' jungle of com
petitiveness," Greene said. - â€¢
