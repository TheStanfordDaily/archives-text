WASHINGTON — Rep. John Ander
son's independent drive lor the presidency
got another shot in the arm yesterday when his
Massachusetts campaign staff filed 100.000
signatures, more than twice the number
needed to qualify him for the state's
November ballot.
He is already on the ballot in New Jersey,
and filed enough signatures Monday to qual
ify for the Michigan ballot. But as he enters
Ins third week of independent campaigning,
the legal problems in getting on other ballots
continue to mount.
"We're spending most of our money on
lawyers," Tom Matthews, one of Anderson's
chief fundraisers, said.

"The legal problems are a nightmare."
added Francis Sheehan. the Anderson cam
paign treasurer. "But we can beat them."
Anderson has retained the prestigious
Washington law firm of Arnold and Porter to
wrestle with the many state election laws. A
series of recent memos from the firm to An
derson strategists charts a plausible but
costly course for his first two months ot cam
paigning:
— In North Carolina. Anderson must gel
10.000 signatures bv May 16 and then create
an independent party to satistv state law.
In Utah. Anderson needs onlv 300 sig
natures. but they must be notarized individu
ally. State officials have promised thev will
not enforce laws that prohibit a registered
Democrat or Republican from running as an

independent, but the door is open for a court
challenge to that decision by either of the two
major parties.
— In Texas. Anderson needs 40,000 sig
natures by July 14. But well ahead of that
date Anderson lawyers must challenge a
state law that prohibits individuals who voted
in the state primary from signing the peti
tions. A similar law applies in West Virginia.
■' 11 is one of the most absurd laws we've come
across," Sheehan said.
— Anderson has missed filing deadlines in
four states: Ohio. New Mexico, Maine and
Maryland. The campaign plans to collect sig
natures anyway and hopes that the lawyers
can overturn the deadlines in court as being
unfair.
