Proposition 9 will result in further
tax reductions for the wealthy and a
loss of state-financed public services to
the poor, said Education Prof. Michael
Kirst in a debate yesterday with State
Board of Education President Dr.
Alvin Rabushka, who maintained that
the proposition will not trim public
programs while lowering personal in
come tax.
The proposition, authored by How
ard Jarvis, father of Proposition 13,
would amend the state constitution to
reduce personal income taxes by 50
percent. Prop. 9 would also tie the in
come tax rate to the rate of inflation
and abolish the business inventory tax.
Jarvis 11, as it is known, will be on the
June 3 California ballot.
A constitutional amendment is
necessary to "prevent unanticipated,
unvoted tax increases," Rabushka, a
Hoover Institute fellow, said. The tax
index is a temporary statute that ex
pires in 198 1, and while the business
inventory tax has no expiration date, it
can be revoked because it is a statute.
Proposition 9 would place them both in
the State Constitution permanently.

Rabushka said that the poor's per
sonal income taxes would be cut 70 to
75 percent while tax reductions for the
rich would amount to 50 percent. Both
private investment and the state's stan
dard of living would increase, he ad
ded.
"It's a question of whether you can
cat dollars or percentages," Kirst said.
The poor may receive a larger percen
tage reduction but the wealthy still are
receiving a big reduction from their al
ready bigger incomes, he added.
Kirst said that Prop. 9 is ill-timed in a
period of recession and overkill in the
aftermath of 1978's Prop. 13, whose
effects have yet to be fully felt. The
professor added that only the rich, who
can afford to pay for private education,
health and other special services, will
benefit. Rabushka contended that the
poor will have tax savings with which to
pay for private services.
The proposition is not designed to
reduce governmental spending to hurt
the poor but to streamline legislative
spending and create government effi
ciency within the available budget,
Rabushka said.
Cuts of some state programs, such as
California State Scholarships, would

force private universities to provide al
ternative scholarships. Public univer
sities may be forced to raise tuition.
About 800 students here would be
subject to state grant reductions of up
to $680,000, money the University
would have to finance alternatively
through increased tuition or cuts in
other programs. In addition, Prop. 9
would restrict Medi-Cal reimburse
ments to all medical institutions, in
cluding Stanford Hospital, which could
lose up to $140 million.
"I don't think the taxpayer should

support the educational and medical
needs of those that can afford to pay for
it." Rabushka said.
The debators agreed that the bill
represents an issue of principle and
philosophy. Since the 19505. California
has had a history of being a high-tax
and high-service state. The question
now before the voters, they said, is
whether California would rather be a
lower-tax, lower-service state, closer to
the national average.
'The debate took place on KZSU's
Campus Conference program.
