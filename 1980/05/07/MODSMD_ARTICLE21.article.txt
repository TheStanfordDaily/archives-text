# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Hold line on sororities 
### 
It was only two years ago that the University
Board of Trustees removed its33-year-old ban
on sororities. This was seen by many as a first
step toward full University recognition of
sororities and their possible eventual acquisiton
of on-campus housing. This process, all agreed,
had to be predicated on the independence of the
local sorority chapters from the national organi
zations and the implementation of a selection
policy that would not require rushees to submit
letters of recommendation to the national or
ganization.
The trust and good faith that have charac
terized this process o\ er the past few years have
fallen apart in the past week, with the revelation
that members of the national Panhellenic roof
organization for sororities have been conduct
ing inquiries into rushees' backgrounds on be
half of some Stanford sorority chapters.
The parents of several rushees were asked
personal questions about their daughters'
backgrounds. Topics included the women's
grade point averages, their family's income,
whether their mothers worked outside the
home, church member recommendations, and
so on.
We cannot condone these kinds of inquiries,
for several reasons.
First and foremost, calling rushees' parents

without the rushees' consent is an unparalleled
invasion of privacy. A woman who wishes to
become a member of a social group should not
have to disclose her past for the scrutiny of the
group she wishes to join. The sororities have no
right to expect rushees to make available the
personal details of their lives â€” certainly not
without their prior permission.
Second, at a university like Stanford, there is
an opportunity for everyone to make a new
beginning. Whatever roles a woman wishes to
play, they should be open regardless of her
high school GPA. Probing as the sororities
have done destroy s the clean slate that can be so
valuable to students when they come here.
Last, the sororities have long known that they
must minimize their ties to the national organi
zations if they are to achieve University recogni
tion. This is significant evidence that the ties to
the nationals are still as strong as ever.
This incident only serves to demonstrate that
the University administration's misgivings
about granting the sororities recognition are
well-grounded. Their stance has not been a
popular one in many circles; it is to their credit
that they have held to their position. We hope
they will continue to do so as long as there is a
reasonable doubt that sororities can function
with complete local autonomy.
