## ACLU: University conceals Franklin facts 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the second of a two-part column on
the dismissal of former Prof. Bruce Franklin and the
current Advisory Board Hearing. See yesterday's Daily
for part one.)
Since the ACLU originally filed a lawsuit in August.
1972. claiming that Franklin's discharge violated his
constitutional rights, the administration and trustees,
defendants in the suit, have spent over a quarter of a
million dollars of the University's money to defend their
actions in court. That expensive effort has not been
successful.
In 197 N. after six years of protracted litigation, the
Santa Clara Superior Court ruled thatlwo of the four
speeches for which Franklin was dismissed were pro
tected b> the First Amendment, and that the administra
tion hail violated Franklin's constitutional rights by
punishing him in part for protected speech. In light of its
ruling, the court ordered the matter returned to Stanford
for reconsideration of the penalty inflicted on Franklin.
We believe that the members of the University com
munity have a right to know both the procedures by
which that court-ordered reconsideration of Franklin's
dismissal is to be conducted and the basic grounds for the
University's ultimate decision on sanction. The ad
ministration apparently opposed the concept of com
munity awareness ol the Franklin case, and has used
every weapon in its arsenal to prevent a fair and open
reconsideration of Franklin's discharge.
First, the administration attempted to delay any re
consideration at the University, by seeking to block the
court-ordered rehearing until the court of appeal re
viewed the finding that two of Franklin's speeches were
constitutionally protected. I he administration
petititioned for a delay three times; its request was
unanimously rejected three times by the superior court
and the court of appeal.
Those rulings, a major legal defeat tor the administra
tion. were then distorted by its press office in its publica
tion. Campus Report, to conceal the fact that the ad
ministration had strenuously and unsuccessfully resisted
having the Franklin case returned here.
Second, having the facts surrounding the new Franklin
hearing, the administration is proceeding to conceal the
hearing itself from the University. How? By ordering its
Advisory Board to conduct a closed-door rush to judg
ment and complete its "deliberations" so that President
Richard Lyman can issue his decision "no later than the
end of May."
And the Advisory Board has been very compliant,
revoking each and every procedural protection granted
bv the 1972 Advisory Board, specified in the 1973 Rules
for Conduct of Hearings for Faculty Discipline, and
compelled by fundamental notions of fairness. Accord
ing to procedures adopted by the board last week:
1) Franklin has been denied the right to introduce any
evidence.
2) Franklin has been denied the right to an open
hearing.
3) Franklin has been denied the right to an oral argu
ment by counsel before the Advisory Board members.
4) Franklin has been denied the right to address the
Advisory Board members personally.
5) Franklin has been denied the right to a seven

person Advisory Board, and specifically to full represen
tation on the board by members of his School of
Humanities and Sciences (a majority of whom, in 1 972,
voted not to terminate him.) After a regular member of
the board from the School of Humanities and Sciences
withdrew from the case, the board refused to seat his
alternate.
6) Franklin has effectively been denied the right to
challenge Advisory Board members for cause, by the
refusal of the Advisory Board members to divulge any
information regarding their prior involvement in the
events in question or their relationship with Franklin.
7) Franklin has been denied the right to review or
submit public records documenting the discipline in
flicted on other Stanford professors found to have en
gaged in serious misconduct. In Franklin's hearing, the
board is charged with redetermining a penalty tor a
tenured faculty member who "urged and incited'' vio
lence. As a matter of public record, there are faculty
members at the University who committed violence, and
suffered punishment far less severe than dismissal.
Certainly a fair and nondiscriminatory sanction
should be consistent with the standards for the commun
ity, particularly when the case concerns an individual
whose ideas are as controversial as Franklin's. Yet the
board calls those other penalty determinations "not re
levant" and will neither permit the ACLU access to
those public records nor consider them in deciding
whether to refire Franklin.
These extremely restrictive procedures violate the
Rules for the Conduct of Hearings, the board's own prior
procedures and fundamental principles of academic due
process. Both the administration and its Advisory Board
are apparently willing to jettison even the forms of jus
tice in their haste to put this case quietly behind them this
month.
Perhaps the most disturbing and revealing manifesta
tion of the approach adopted by the administration and
Advisory Board is the refusal to allow any oral argument
at a public hearing because, in the words of the board's
counsel, "The board does not consider that oral argu
ment would be helpful." The 1973 Rules grant a faculty
member an absolute right to an open hearing, at his or
her request, in a room that may accommodate at least
100 people, with broadcasting to the rest of the commun
ity by KZSU radio. Moreover, the Rules grant a right to
oral argument, limited only by a provision that argument
consume "no more than one day for each party. (We
requested two hours.) Here, the board is infringing not
only Franklin's right to procedural due process, but
your right to know how the University administration
conducts its significant trials.
What evidence has the board allowed for its reconsid
eration of the firing — or "academic capital punish
ment" _ of a tenured faculty member? The board will
accept two written statements from Franklin's attorneys
and from the administration's counsel. Thus, f-ranklin
has been relegated to a star-chamber, closed-door, "re
consideration" that is proceeding at breakneck speed:
the board members will meet privately, probably within
the next month, and release their decision in early sum
mer.

We are dismayed by the treatment afforded Franklin,
in part, of course, because he is the ACLU s client, and
we wish to see him receive a tull and fair hearing. But it is
not this legal representation that compels us to protest.
Rather, we speak out as the ACLU, an organization
dedicated to the preservation of the fundamental princi
ples of due process and the public's right to know.
As civil libertarians, we must be, and are, appalled at
the spectre of a major university trampling on the rights
of a tenured faculty member, disregarding its own pro
cedures, and concealing these actions and their implica
tions from members of its community.
The superior court has refused to intervene at this
stage of the Advisory Board proceedings. We intend to
raise all these procedural defects, and the fundamental
unfairness of the entire proceeding, after the University
decision is released and the case returns to court.
But this issue should not be viewed simply as a legal
dispute. Nor should this matter be dismissed as the
lonely battle of Franklin, perceived by some as a
banished and forgotten figure from the University's dis
tant past. These due process violations are occurring
now, and they stem from manipulations of terms of the
tenure contract and Rules of Conduct that are supposed
to protect all faculty members. What about the next
faculty discipline case at Stanford? Which procedural
protections will then be sacrificed in the interests of
administrative expedience?
It is for these reasons that we have brought these
issues to your attention. Ultimately, what is at stake here
is not the fate of Franklin, but due process and freedom
of speech at this University; and it is you, the men and
women of Stanford, who must cherish and protect these
rights if they are to survive.

tion. Campus Report, to conceal the fact that the ad
ministration had strenuously and unsuccessfully resisted
having the Franklin case returned here.
Second, having the facts surrounding the new Franklin
hearing, the administration is proceeding to conceal the
hearing itself from the University. How? By ordering its
Advisory Board to conduct a closed-door rush to judg
ment and complete its "deliberations" so that President
Richard Lyman can issue his decision "no later than the
end of May."
And the Advisory Board has been very compliant,
revoking each and every procedural protection granted
bv the 1972 Advisory Board, specified in the 1973 Rules
for Conduct of Hearings for Faculty Discipline, and
compelled by fundamental notions of fairness. Accord
ing to procedures adopted by the board last week:
1) Franklin has been denied the right to introduce any
evidence.
2) Franklin has been denied the right to an open
hearing.
3) Franklin has been denied the right to an oral argu
ment by counsel before the Advisory Board members.
4) Franklin has been denied the right to address the
Advisory Board members personally.
5) Franklin has been denied the right to a seven

person Advisory Board, and specifically to full represen
tation on the board by members of his School of
Humanities and Sciences (a majority of whom, in 1 972,
voted not to terminate him.) After a regular member of
the board from the School of Humanities and Sciences
withdrew from the case, the board refused to seat his
alternate.
6) Franklin has effectively been denied the right to
challenge Advisory Board members for cause, by the
refusal of the Advisory Board members to divulge any
information regarding their prior involvement in the
events in question or their relationship with Franklin.
7) Franklin has been denied the right to review or
submit public records documenting the discipline in
flicted on other Stanford professors found to have en
gaged in serious misconduct. In Franklin's hearing, the
board is charged with redetermining a penalty tor a
tenured faculty member who "urged and incited'' vio
lence. As a matter of public record, there are faculty
members at the University who committed violence, and
suffered punishment far less severe than dismissal.
Certainly a fair and nondiscriminatory sanction
should be consistent with the standards for the commun
ity, particularly when the case concerns an individual
whose ideas are as controversial as Franklin's. Yet the
board calls those other penalty determinations "not re
levant" and will neither permit the ACLU access to
those public records nor consider them in deciding
whether to refire Franklin.
These extremely restrictive procedures violate the
Rules for the Conduct of Hearings, the board's own prior
procedures and fundamental principles of academic due
process. Both the administration and its Advisory Board
are apparently willing to jettison even the forms of jus
tice in their haste to put this case quietly behind them this
month.
Perhaps the most disturbing and revealing manifesta
tion of the approach adopted by the administration and
Advisory Board is the refusal to allow any oral argument
at a public hearing because, in the words of the board's
counsel, "The board does not consider that oral argu
ment would be helpful." The 1973 Rules grant a faculty
member an absolute right to an open hearing, at his or
her request, in a room that may accommodate at least
100 people, with broadcasting to the rest of the commun
ity by KZSU radio. Moreover, the Rules grant a right to
oral argument, limited only by a provision that argument
consume "no more than one day for each party. (We
requested two hours.) Here, the board is infringing not
only Franklin's right to procedural due process, but
your right to know how the University administration
conducts its significant trials.
What evidence has the board allowed for its reconsid
eration of the firing — or "academic capital punish
ment" _ of a tenured faculty member? The board will
accept two written statements from Franklin's attorneys
and from the administration's counsel. Thus, f-ranklin
has been relegated to a star-chamber, closed-door, "re
consideration" that is proceeding at breakneck speed:
the board members will meet privately, probably within
the next month, and release their decision in early sum
mer.

We are dismayed by the treatment afforded Franklin,
in part, of course, because he is the ACLU s client, and
we wish to see him receive a tull and fair hearing. But it is
not this legal representation that compels us to protest.
Rather, we speak out as the ACLU, an organization
dedicated to the preservation of the fundamental princi
ples of due process and the public's right to know.
As civil libertarians, we must be, and are, appalled at
the spectre of a major university trampling on the rights
of a tenured faculty member, disregarding its own pro
cedures, and concealing these actions and their implica
tions from members of its community.
The superior court has refused to intervene at this
stage of the Advisory Board proceedings. We intend to
raise all these procedural defects, and the fundamental
unfairness of the entire proceeding, after the University
decision is released and the case returns to court.
But this issue should not be viewed simply as a legal
dispute. Nor should this matter be dismissed as the
lonely battle of Franklin, perceived by some as a
banished and forgotten figure from the University's dis
tant past. These due process violations are occurring
now, and they stem from manipulations of terms of the
tenure contract and Rules of Conduct that are supposed
to protect all faculty members. What about the next
faculty discipline case at Stanford? Which procedural
protections will then be sacrificed in the interests of
administrative expedience?
It is for these reasons that we have brought these
issues to your attention. Ultimately, what is at stake here
is not the fate of Franklin, but due process and freedom
of speech at this University; and it is you, the men and
women of Stanford, who must cherish and protect these
rights if they are to survive.

Since the ACLU originally filed a lawsuit in August.
1972. claiming that Franklin's discharge violated his
constitutional rights, the administration and trustees,
defendants in the suit, have spent over a quarter of a
million dollars of the University's money to defend their
actions in court. That expensive effort has not been
successful.
In 197 N. after six years of protracted litigation, the
Santa Clara Superior Court ruled thatlwo of the four
speeches for which Franklin was dismissed were pro
tected b> the First Amendment, and that the administra
tion hail violated Franklin's constitutional rights by
punishing him in part for protected speech. In light of its
ruling, the court ordered the matter returned to Stanford
for reconsideration of the penalty inflicted on Franklin.
We believe that the members of the University com
munity have a right to know both the procedures by
which that court-ordered reconsideration of Franklin's
dismissal is to be conducted and the basic grounds for the
University's ultimate decision on sanction. The ad
ministration apparently opposed the concept of com
munity awareness ol the Franklin case, and has used
every weapon in its arsenal to prevent a fair and open
reconsideration of Franklin's discharge.
First, the administration attempted to delay any re
consideration at the University, by seeking to block the
court-ordered rehearing until the court of appeal re
viewed the finding that two of Franklin's speeches were
constitutionally protected. I he administration

unanimously rejected three times by the superior court
and the court of appeal.

flicted on other Stanford professors found to have en
gaged in serious misconduct. In Franklin's hearing, the
board is charged with redetermining a penalty tor a
tenured faculty member who "urged and incited'' vio
lence. As a matter of public record, there are faculty
members at the University who committed violence, and
suffered punishment far less severe than dismissal.
Certainly a fair and nondiscriminatory sanction
should be consistent with the standards for the commun
ity, particularly when the case concerns an individual
whose ideas are as controversial as Franklin's. Yet the
board calls those other penalty determinations "not re
levant" and will neither permit the ACLU access to
those public records nor consider them in deciding
whether to refire Franklin.
These extremely restrictive procedures violate the
Rules for the Conduct of Hearings, the board's own prior
procedures and fundamental principles of academic due
process. Both the administration and its Advisory Board
are apparently willing to jettison even the forms of jus
tice in their haste to put this case quietly behind them this
month.
Perhaps the most disturbing and revealing manifesta
tion of the approach adopted by the administration and
Advisory Board is the refusal to allow any oral argument
at a public hearing because, in the words of the board's
counsel, "The board does not consider that oral argu
ment would be helpful." The 1973 Rules grant a faculty
member an absolute right to an open hearing, at his or
her request, in a room that may accommodate at least
100 people, with broadcasting to the rest of the commun
ity by KZSU radio. Moreover, the Rules grant a right to
oral argument, limited only by a provision that argument
consume "no more than one day for each party. (We
requested two hours.) Here, the board is infringing not
only Franklin's right to procedural due process, but
your right to know how the University administration
conducts its significant trials.
What evidence has the board allowed for its reconsid
eration of the firing — or "academic capital punish
ment" _ of a tenured faculty member? The board will
accept two written statements from Franklin's attorneys
and from the administration's counsel. Thus, f-ranklin
has been relegated to a star-chamber, closed-door, "re
consideration" that is proceeding at breakneck speed:
the board members will meet privately, probably within
the next month, and release their decision in early sum
mer.

We are dismayed by the treatment afforded Franklin,
in part, of course, because he is the ACLU s client, and
we wish to see him receive a tull and fair hearing. But it is
not this legal representation that compels us to protest.
Rather, we speak out as the ACLU, an organization
dedicated to the preservation of the fundamental princi
ples of due process and the public's right to know.
As civil libertarians, we must be, and are, appalled at
the spectre of a major university trampling on the rights
of a tenured faculty member, disregarding its own pro
cedures, and concealing these actions and their implica
tions from members of its community.
The superior court has refused to intervene at this
stage of the Advisory Board proceedings. We intend to
raise all these procedural defects, and the fundamental
unfairness of the entire proceeding, after the University
decision is released and the case returns to court.
But this issue should not be viewed simply as a legal
dispute. Nor should this matter be dismissed as the
lonely battle of Franklin, perceived by some as a
banished and forgotten figure from the University's dis
tant past. These due process violations are occurring
now, and they stem from manipulations of terms of the
tenure contract and Rules of Conduct that are supposed
to protect all faculty members. What about the next
faculty discipline case at Stanford? Which procedural
protections will then be sacrificed in the interests of
administrative expedience?
It is for these reasons that we have brought these
issues to your attention. Ultimately, what is at stake here
is not the fate of Franklin, but due process and freedom
of speech at this University; and it is you, the men and
women of Stanford, who must cherish and protect these
rights if they are to survive.
