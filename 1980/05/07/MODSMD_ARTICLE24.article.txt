# FORUM:
## The 						hostage rescue 
### 
On April 24, the United States tried and failed to
rescue the 53 Americans that were being held hostage at
the embassy in Tehran. This week's Forum asks: What
did we do wrong and where do we go from here?
First, was it wise to risk the lives of the hostages and
the military personnel involved by attempting such a
dangerous operation?
Second, was the rescue attempt made solely for politi
cal reasons, or would any rational leader have used a
military option for humanitarian reasons?
And finally, is media attention of the Iranian militants'
actions just encouraging them to drag out the crisis?
Contributions of columns or letters should be typed,
double-spaced, on a 57-spacc line. All submissions must
be signed and are subject to editing. Bring them by noon
today to The Stanford Daily, Storkc Publications Build
