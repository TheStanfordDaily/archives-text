# Accusations by gays are insulting
## 
### 
During our recent "Gay
Awareness Week," the campus
gay community set out to ac
quaint the local "straight" com
munity with the problems and
realities of being homosexual.
However, instead of becoming
more enlightened about gay
problems, I was put off by gay
rhetoric and the gays' lack of in
sight into their own situation.
For a group that has suffered
from prejudice, ignorance and
insensitivity, the gays seemed to
be strangely unconcerned about
their own biases and close
minded views.
For a first example, let me take
the statements made at a White
Plaza rally on April 29 by San
Francisco Supervisor Harry
Britt. Britt claimed that nuclear
power — which he obviously
considers malevolent and awful
— is "profoundly male and pro
foundly sexist." Solar power, on
the other hand, is "very loving,
very human, very female . . .
very gay."
What ludicrous drivel. Ac
cording to Britt. the feeling that
nuclear power is "profoundly
male" stems from' knowing that
eventually it can go boom."
Perhaps the object of this cryptic
allusion is the male orgasm. And
perhaps what Britt meant was
that our male-dominated gov
ernment is promoting nuclear
power in the hope of achieving
one great big, world-shattering

orgasm.
Unfortunately for Britt*s
novel little argument, nuclear
power plants don't go "boom"
— they go "melt." And if going
"boom" is somehow masculine,
then going "melt" is somehow
feminine. With this little correc
tion in mind, Britt would have to
make the equally silly argument
that the apocalyptical climax
being engineered by the power
companies is, in fact profoundly
female.
But the real problem with
Britt's statement was not this
inane imagery. It was, instead,
the spurious association of un
popular things with masculinity
and heterosexuality, and of
popular ideals with feminity and
homosexuality.
This is the sort of de
magoguery one expects from
Klansmen. not the spokesman of
a group that has known first
hand the effects of corrupted
rhetoric. Broad accusations
about men — straight men —
being sexist, destructive, unlov
ing and cold are not my idea of
liberated thinking. Insulting yes,
enlightened no.
A far more pervasive lack of
understanding was exemplified
in Stuart Reges' opinion, "Gay
relations too uptight" (Daily,
Apr. 30). Reges mentioned that
as a representative of the gay
community, he feels comfortable
talking to people in dorms but is
unable to interact with his audi
ence on a personal level after
ward.
When I read this, I couldn't
help wondering what Reges says
to his audience. Perhaps his pre
sentation repels rather than at
tracts people. While I seriously
doubt that he makes the sort of
irresponsible comments that
Britt made, 1 can imagine other
ways of alienating a group of
generally receptive straights.

For example, when a group of
speakers from the Gay People's
Union came to my dorm last
year, they informed us that vir
tually everyone is homosexual,
but that only a few brave and
sensitive individuals are able to
admit it. This line of reasoning
not only undermined the credi
bility of the gay speakers, but it
also put the house members on

the defensive about their own c
sexuality. As a result, after the
gays were done speaking, no- p
body was too interested in get- t
ting to know them personally. a
lam not implying that Reges t
uses such an approach. But Ido i
feel that he should have realized a
that the gay movement has often h
taken on an aggressive, self
righteous attitude that makes
people all the more wary of indi- n
vidual homosexuals. d
I also found Reges'discussion t:
of the "kid gloves" approach to a
picking up straight men com- 1
pletely one-sided. As he b
explained it, "If you're attracted
to a man, you try to get to know a
him as a friend. Then you find s
out his feelings toward gays, and h
if you get a positive response you 1
carefully tell him that you're gay. r
Then after a few more months t
you might actually hint that you (
find him attractive."
u
Reges raises objections to this e
process on the grounds that it is I
unnecessarily protracted and I

takes far more energy than the
analogous process tor
heterosexuals. It was a signific
ant omission not to have noted
that the "kid gloves" approach
consists of deceiving straights.
He should have objected to the
fact that what some unsuspecting
men see as budding friendships
are actually elaborate,

carefully-disguised pickups.
I understand that years of op
pression and prejudice have led
to things like the "kid gloves"
approach. But I don't see where
the gays have shown any insight
into how these current practices
are creating more tension, more
hostility.
In general, I think the gay
movement could make a great
deal more progress if it momen
tarily stopped pointing its finger
at the straight community and
tried to look at the issues from
both sides. Only then would it
become clear that blind hatred
and intolerance are no longer the
sole causes for strained
heterosexual/homosexual rela
tions. And this change of
perspective would be a real step
toward "gay awareness."
