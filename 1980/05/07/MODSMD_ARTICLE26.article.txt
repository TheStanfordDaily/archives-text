Indian land raped
The Carter Administration's
energy development programs
designed to bail us out of the oil
crisis were clearly initiated at the
behest of the huge energy con
glomerates.
Accelerated coal and uranium
mining on Indian reservations in
the Black Hills of South Dakota
and in northern New Mexico is
devastating millions of acres of
beautiful land, lands that had
been kept virtually unscathed by
ihe Sioux, Lakota, Navajo and
Hopi tribes for centuries.
Millions of tons of radioactive
mine tailings lie in huge piles
around the desert. The radon gas
these piles emit is distributed by

winds over widespread areas,
significantly increasing the inci
dence of cancer.
The Indians are nearly power
less to stop the rape of their
homelands without the support
of others because they number
so few, and because their in
terests are continually betrayed
by supposedly responsible agen
cies, such as the Bureau of Indian
Affairs and the Bureau of Land

Management. These agencies
have been totally complicit in
corporate phi.is to construct nuc
lear reactor parks, coal gasifica
tion plants and hundreds of
uranium mines on Indian land.
When President Jimmy Carter
speaks of human rights, it's clear
that he does not mean those of
Native Americans.
