The Los Angeles Times
HOLLYWOOD'â€” Johnny Carson has signed a
three-year contract to continue on "The Tonight
Show," which lie began' Jrrtsting more than 17 years
ago.
The announcement was made in New York yes
terday by Edgar Griffiths, chairman of the board
and chief executive officer of RCA, at its annual
stockholders meeting. RCA is NBCs parent com
pany.
The announcement ended wide-ranging specu
lation as to whether Carson would remain on "The
Tonight Show" or fold up his ad libs and move on,
possibly to another network. Carson had said he
had wanted out as "Tonight Show" host before the
April 1981 expiration date of his old contract.
Under the new agreement, the show will be
trimmed to an hour from its present 90 minutes
starting in September, with Carson continuing to
host four nights a week. NBC will still use guest
hosts and reruns of old CaMon shows dn the fifth
night, a network spokesman said.
The contract also calls forjCarson to "develop a

number of new projects exclusively" for NBC, said
Griffiths.
According to an RCA spokesman, NBC charges
$50,000 per commercial minute on "The Tonight
Show," which means that the network stands to
lose a substantial chunk of advertising revenue by
trimming a half hour from the show.
In response to a question, however, Griffiths
said yesterday that NBC (or Carson) had "some
very interesting ideas" for the last halt hour. NBC
will announce plans for that 30 minutes when its
affiliate stations meet in Los Angeles May 18.
Financial terms of Carson's new contract were
not disclosed. Asked after the stockholders meet
ing how much money Carson will get, NBC board
chairman Jane Pfeiffer rbplied, "I have no idea
about that."
Carons's salary under his old contract has been
estimated at between $3 million and $5 million,
and the Nebraska-born comedian has said that
money was not at issue in any dispute he has with
NBC. Carson's total annual income is estimated at
$12 million to $15 million.
