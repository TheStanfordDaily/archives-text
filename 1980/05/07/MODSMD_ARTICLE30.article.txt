Relax in quaint European

events. Visiting Music Prof.
Gottfried Scholz is inviting Uni
versity students, faculty and staff
to traipse through the European
countryside with him for two
weeks this summer. The cultural
tour will concentrate on the vil
lages of the Loire, Rhone and
Rhine valleys and will run from
June 22 to July 6.
"There are tours just for re
creation and others just for sigh
seeing," Scholz explained. "We
would like to have a little intel
lectual attitude â€” so that it
should bring home a lot of ex
periences."
Scholz will provide the trip

with informal lectures on fine
arts, music and architecture in re
lation to the historical and social
backgrounds of the areas the
group passes through.
Scholz insisted, however, that
the tour will be "leisurely." He
said he feels that the routine
tourist schedule which has the
group at the first church at 8 a.m.
and keeps it going until 8 p.m. is
too hectic.
"They should have the time to
enjoy what those places can of
fer," he said. The tour will be
more flexible than most, allow
ing participants to go off on their
own when they wish to, he ad
ded.
The tour starts in London,
then moves on to Paris, Versail
les, Chartres, Tours and Tour-
Auxerre. The latter half covers

Basel, Strasbourg, Rothenberg,
Auxberg and Munich. The group
will travel mostly by bus. Much
of the time will be spent in small
towns on back-country roads,
where the group will be away
from tourist crowds and can
enjoy the ambience of the vil
lages and their townfolk as well
as the landscape.
The idea for the trip was con
ceived by Vince Carrino, a busi
ness school student who was in
Scholz's winter class on Euro
pean cultural history.
"We thought it would be a
good way to see Europe in a way
that wouldn't be normally avail
able," said Carrino. "I guess I'm
just an organizational sort. I like
to put things like that together."
The trip Carrino has organized
will cost about $1300 to $1700,

depending on the level of ac
comodations the group chooses.
The price of the tour includes
roundtrip airfare from New
York to Paris with an open re
turn date, two meals per day.
first-class accommodations in
country inns and all European
transportation.
"It's a good way to start a
European trip," Carrino added.
With a background from the
two-week period, people have
the opportunity to continue
travelling and to experience
Europe on their own.
