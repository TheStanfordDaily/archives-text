## Why can't Cards win on the road? 
### 
Homesickness. Everybody gets it sometimes on the Farm.
But none have suffered so acutely as the 1980 Stanford
baseball team.
The Card nine has lost every one of its 14 conference road
games this season, and then come home and won all but two. In
captain Paul Zuvella's words, "it's just incredible." In coach'
Mark Marquess', "it's highly unusual."
Mostly it's pretty flukey, but that seems to be the nature of
the game. Slumps and streaks are as much a part of baseball as
seeds and chew. And what's more, these phenomena are typi
cally unexplainable. Such is the case with this year's crop,
except what makes the road slump and the home streak even
more enigmatic is that they are team efforts as opposed to
individual ones. That makes them even more complicated.
When asked why the team has been losing on the road, both
Marquess and Zuvella answered, "1 don't really know,"
though Marquess added that "It's just one of those things." No
one really can know for sure. There are just too many things
involved technically and psychologically to sift out any con
crete answer. But there are some causes which are more prob
able than others.
First of those is talent. Talent is reflected in performance and
statistics — the nuts and bolts of baseball — and by comparing
Stanford's numbers with those of their opponents, some prob-
Ums / seen. Stanford has simply been out-hit in league
Their conference average is .257 while their opponents is
.302. They've hit 19 home runs — the opponents have hit 25.
As far as pitching, Stanford has a 5.82 team ERA while the
opponents are mostly under 4.00.
"Coaches have to look at it objectively," Marquess said.
"When looking at this season, 1 have to say, hey, we start four
or five freshmen and I think there's only one other freshman
starting in the league. We weren't deceived. We knew we were
thin pitching-wise and inexperienced."
Regardless of an underabundance of solid talent, the Cards
did very well early on arid surprised team after team at home all
year. Stanford did start some freshmen, but those players, John
Elway, Mike Dotterer, Darryl Stephens and Steve Buechele,
are no slouches. But they are freshmen and college ball is a
giant step from ball both objectively and subjec
tively. Good baseball relies on concentration and that can be
broken down in a young player fairly easily — at least
more easily than in a veteran. It's easier to concentrate at home
in front of friendly crowds.
"In any sport things are different on the road," Zuvella said.
" We might have been waiting back a little and hesitating — you
can't help it. I know that I'm pretty used to it by now (Zuvella is
a senior), but for a freshman it could be more of a problem."
Then he added, "Sometimes we'd get up and then later in the
game they'd get a couple of walks and their crowd would start
to cheer a lot and things would start to snowball a little bit."
The Cards were leading into the late innings of a lot of road
games but then lost those games to opponents' big plays and
their own mistakes. At home, most of the time, they were able
to melt the snowball before it got too big and then comeback
with a big play of their own. The difference, it seems is familiar
ity. Overcoming discomfort with unfamiliar surroundings
comes with experience and when almost half the team is made
up of freshmen that discomfort can get in the way.
A third factor contributing to the slump could have been the
fact that the team was in a slump at all. It's the kind of thing that
can hang over a team's head. The Cards started out the Pac-10
season No. 1 in the nation. They won a series against perrennial
power Arizona in the"Six-Pac" opener but then went down to
Arizona State and lost the first game to the Sun Devils 34-2.
They lost the rest of the series in close games and then went to
USC where they were swept again. That's when they started to
think about their road troubles.
By last weekend's UCLA series the road blight was defi
nitely a factor. "It was in the back of everybody's mind,"
Marquess said, "'here it goes again.' that kind of thing."
Despite the road losses this season, both Marquess and
Zuvella were pleased with the team. They should be. The
Cards did exceptionally well at home this season and for a team
that fielded as many freshmen as it did, in the toughest college
baseball league in the nation, it did very well overall.
"Considering the adversity," Marquess said, "we played
well at home, which is good. They could have just folded up the
tent, but this team's attitude is the best I've seen in a long time.
And they're one of the most hard-working teams I've had. I'm
very proud of that."
Stanford has one more chance to win a road game when they
play Cal at Berkeley this Friday. Zuvella feels the team will
probably get especially worked up. As he said yesterday, "No
one wants to say in 20 years that' 1 played on the Stanford team
that never won on the road.'"
I'm sure no one wants to say it this summer either.
