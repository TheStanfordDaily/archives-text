# Card nine to finish v. Cal
##

Closing out what head coach Mark Marquess
summed up as an "unusual season." the Stanford
baseball team clashes with the UC-Berkeley Bears
this weekend. The first game of the series begins
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m. at Sunken Diamond. Fri
day's game takes place in Berkeley at 1 p.m. and
Saturday's contest will be back at the Farm, also at
1 p.m.
The Cards, coming off a 2-1 non-conference loss
in Santa Clara last night, had their hopes for a
Pacific-10 pi ay oft berth shattered last weekend by
the UCLA Bruins. The ever-tough Bruin nine
downed the Cards in three straight games, 4-2,4-1
and 9-5.
And now, with nothing to really fight for but
their pride and a good dose of rivalry, the Cards
will try to play spoilers — to do their best to keep
the Bears out of the Pac-10 lead.
At the present, Cal can lock up at least a tie for
first place in the league if they sweep the Cards.
They own a 16-11 conference record and are
32-18-1 overall, and are thus virtually assured a
spot in the playoffs.
"This is always a natural rivalry," Marquess said.
"We want to finish on a positive note — we want to
finish well." '
For the weekend's series. Marquess intends to
return to his regular pitching rotation. Larry Kuhn
will take to the mound in Friday's contest and
Brian Mignano will get the nod on Sunday. Friday's

game at Berkeley, according to Marquess, "de
pends." Depending on how things go tomorrow.
Marquess will start either Lee Cline or Paul
Grame.
Marquess also that Kuhn, team captain
Paul Zuvella and catcher John Freitas, all seniors,
may see extra playing time because they will be
competing for their last time in a Cardinal uniform.
The Bears are led by second baseman Jeff Ronk
(.356), outfielder Kelly Wood (.319). utility man
Bruce Johnson (.318) and centerfielder Lyle Brac
kenridge (.317) at the plate. Cal's pitching staff,
one of the strongest in the West, is headed by
Chuck Hensley (8-11, 2.58 ERA), Glenn Prater
(5-2, 2.43) and Chuck Cary (2-1, 2.58).
Though Stanford's coach Marquess described
the year as "unusual," that's not to say he wasn't
pleased with some of the things which took place
along the line.
"I'm happy with the young people on our team,"
he said. "Particularly (John) Elway, (Mike) Dot
tererand (Darryl) Stephens. They'll be a lot better
for (their experience) next year."
The main disappointment the coach sees as he
looks back over the season is defense. It just wasn't
strong enough when it needed to be.
But despite the team's up and down again sea
son, Marquess insists it will play its heart out in this,
its final series of the year.
"This team will play hard regardless of what's
happened," he said. "And I'm proudest of that."
