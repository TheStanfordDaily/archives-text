Stanford's No. I ranked men's
tennis team will try to keep its
nine match win streak intact to
morrow and Saturday as they
battle for the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title and national rankings
against perennial tennis powers
UCLA and USC.
UCLA, ranked second behind
Stanford in the latest poll, will
begin Thursday's play at I p.m.
at the varsity courts with the Nos.
3 to 6 singles matches and the
Nos. 2 and 3 doubles matches
and will conclude'with the top
two singles and top doubles
matches starting at 6:30 p.m. in
doors at Maples Pavilion. The
same format will be used when
the Cards host USC Saturday.
UCLA and USC will
have revenge on their minds as
Stanford handed both schools
narrow 5-4 defeats earlier in the
season in L.A. — only the second
time since World War II that a
Stanford team had accomplished
such a feat.
Going into Thursday's
matches, Stanford and USC are
tied for the conference lead with
7-1 records, out of reach of both
UCLA and UC-Berkeley who
trail with 5-3 records. Earlier
this season, the Trojans have
edged the Bruins twice by 5-4
scores as they have twice swept
the three doubles matches after
trailing 2-4 in the singles.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
sees the doubles play for the
Cards as a key against the
Bruins.
"I have tremendous respect
for UCLA's singles lineup. Their
depth is awesome. This is the
same team as last year's national
championship team, with Rob
bie Venter replacing Fritz
Beuhning (who turned pro) at
the No. 1 position. The key could
be in our doubles play."
In the previous outing in LA,
Stanford was able to take two of

the three doubles matches with
the deciding point going to the
third match pitting the Card's
Scott Bondurant and Dave
Siegler against Venter and Dan
Salt/. The Cards pulled out a nail
biting 6-4. 6-7 (5-4), 6-4 win to
clinch the team victory.
Featured inside on the carpet
of Maples will be Peter Rennert
and Tim Mayotte for Stanford.
The two have so far combined
for an amazing 27-2 record this
season and have not lost 'a
Pac-10 singles match. Rennert
w ill be matched against Venter, a
South African who was a top
ranking world junior. Mayotte's
opponent will not be decided
until the match begins, but it
should be either Mike Har
rington or Blaine Willenborg.
The No. 1 doubles match should
feature Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne against Willenborg and
Dick Metz, w ho earlier defeated
the Stanford duo.
Saturday's match against USC
will decide the Pac-10 title. Ear
lier this season, the match bet
ween the two schools was de
cided on the No. 1 doubles match
when Rennert and Bourne
fought off a match point in the
third set and went on to score the
victory over Robert Van't Hof
and Doug Adler.
USC is lead by Van't Hof, who
is currently ranked 10th among
the nation's collegiate players,
and 64th in the world. Earlier,
Rennert, who is ranked 42nd in
the world, beat Van't Hof 6-4,
7-6, but feels this match should
prove tough.
"When Van't Hof is on, he can
beat anyone in college tennis,"
Rennert said. "The key to my
match should be my serve. If I'm
able to serve well, it takes pres
sure off me and allows me to go
after service breaks."
Also inside will be Mayotte
versus Bill Nealon, who earlier
defeated Bourne, and a rematch
of the Rennert-Bourne vs. Van't
Hof-Adler doubles match.

Stanford's No. I ranked men's
tennis team will try to keep its
nine match win streak intact to
morrow and Saturday as they
battle for the Pacific-10 Confer
ence title and national rankings
against perennial tennis powers
UCLA and USC.
UCLA, ranked second behind
Stanford in the latest poll, will
begin Thursday's play at I p.m.
at the varsity courts with the Nos.
3 to 6 singles matches and the
Nos. 2 and 3 doubles matches
and will conclude'with the top
two singles and top doubles
matches starting at 6:30 p.m. in
doors at Maples Pavilion. The
same format will be used when
the Cards host USC Saturday.
UCLA and USC will
have revenge on their minds as
Stanford handed both schools
narrow 5-4 defeats earlier in the
season in L.A. — only the second
time since World War II that a
Stanford team had accomplished
such a feat.
Going into Thursday's
matches, Stanford and USC are
tied for the conference lead with
7-1 records, out of reach of both
UCLA and UC-Berkeley who
trail with 5-3 records. Earlier
this season, the Trojans have
edged the Bruins twice by 5-4
scores as they have twice swept
the three doubles matches after
trailing 2-4 in the singles.
Stanford coach Dick Gould
sees the doubles play for the
Cards as a key against the
Bruins.
"I have tremendous respect
for UCLA's singles lineup. Their
depth is awesome. This is the
same team as last year's national
championship team, with Rob
bie Venter replacing Fritz
Beuhning (who turned pro) at
the No. 1 position. The key could
be in our doubles play."
In the previous outing in LA,
Stanford was able to take two of

the three doubles matches with
the deciding point going to the
third match pitting the Card's
Scott Bondurant and Dave
Siegler against Venter and Dan
Salt/. The Cards pulled out a nail
biting 6-4. 6-7 (5-4), 6-4 win to
clinch the team victory.
Featured inside on the carpet
of Maples will be Peter Rennert
and Tim Mayotte for Stanford.
The two have so far combined
for an amazing 27-2 record this
season and have not lost 'a
Pac-10 singles match. Rennert
w ill be matched against Venter, a
South African who was a top
ranking world junior. Mayotte's
opponent will not be decided
until the match begins, but it
should be either Mike Har
rington or Blaine Willenborg.
The No. 1 doubles match should
feature Rennert and Lloyd
Bourne against Willenborg and
Dick Metz, w ho earlier defeated
the Stanford duo.
Saturday's match against USC
will decide the Pac-10 title. Ear
lier this season, the match bet
ween the two schools was de
cided on the No. 1 doubles match
when Rennert and Bourne
fought off a match point in the
third set and went on to score the
victory over Robert Van't Hof
and Doug Adler.
USC is lead by Van't Hof, who
is currently ranked 10th among
the nation's collegiate players,
and 64th in the world. Earlier,
Rennert, who is ranked 42nd in
the world, beat Van't Hof 6-4,
7-6, but feels this match should
prove tough.
"When Van't Hof is on, he can
beat anyone in college tennis,"
Rennert said. "The key to my
match should be my serve. If I'm
able to serve well, it takes pres
sure off me and allows me to go
after service breaks."
Also inside will be Mayotte
versus Bill Nealon, who earlier
defeated Bourne, and a rematch
of the Rennert-Bourne vs. Van't
Hof-Adler doubles match.
