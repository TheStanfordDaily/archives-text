LOS ANGELES — From the
day Kareem Abdul-Jabbar en
tered the National Basketball
Association back in 1969, it was
evident that he was a player of
extraordinary talent.
But this season, bolstered by a
strong supporting cast and dis
playing new-found intensity and
enthusiasm, the "Big Guy," as
his teammates call him, has been
playing bettej than ever.
"He's older, he's wiser — he's
something," said Philadelphia
76ers coach Billy Cunningham
after Abdul-Jabbar's 33 points,
14 rebounds and six blocked
shots led the Lakers to a 109-192
victory in Sunday's opening
game of the NBA championship
series.
"Four years I've been playing

against Kareem, and it seems
like he's improved every year,"
said Caldwell Jones, the Sixers'
7-footer who will have at least
partial responsibility forcontain
ing Abdul-Jabbar when the
best-of-seven playoff finals re
sume tonight.
Darryl Dawkins, Philadel
phia's muscular 23-year-old
pivotman, got in early foul trou
ble trying to play against
Abdul-Jabbar Sunday and
fouled out after only 18 minutes
of action. "We've got to keep
Darryl in the lineup more, so
maybe we'll make some
changes," said Cunningham,
hinting that he might move
Dawkins onto Lakers forward
Jim Chones and give Jones the
task of tangling with the 7-2
Abdul-Jabbar.
Jones knows it's no easy task.

"You've got to bump him once
or twice," he said. "You've got
to lean on him. You've got to try
to make him shoot the jump
shot. Then you've got to keep
him from getting the rebound if
he does miss.
"You've got to see if you can
hold him to between 30 and 35
points, because if he gets 40
you've really got problems."
It is a measure of the 33-
year-old Abdul-Jabbar's amaz
ing skill that an opponent would
consider limiting him to 30
points a major accomplishment.
For virtually any other NBA
player, a 30-point playoff game
would be a career highlight.
It's always been that way for
Abdul-Jabbar, from the time he
was a celebrated schoolboy at
New York's Power Memorial
High School, through his college
career at UCLA that included
three NCAA titles, to his early
pro years with the Milwaukee
Bucks, whom he led to the NBA
crown in 197 1.
"The overall difference this
year is what happens on the
court," Abdul-Jabber said. "Be
cause people wanted to give me
all the blame, now they want to
give me all the credit, to say I've
changed and come through. I
think I've been pretty consistent
the whole time."
