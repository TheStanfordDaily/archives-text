# Jack Skilling ties for first place
## Linxmen finish third in Pac-10s 
### Val Vaden Staff Writer 
As the sun went down on the
Pacific-10 men's golf champion
ships in Seattle, Stanford
sophomore Jack Skilling's at
tempt at a tournament-winning
putt rolled a mere three feet
short of the last hole.
Nevertheless, Skilling's two
day, 72-hole performance of
even par left him tied with two
other golfers for first-place,
medalist honors in the champ
ionships.
Skilling's outstanding indi
vidual performance was com
plemented by a third-place finish
by the Stanford men's team.
Stanford men's golf coach.
David Yates, was extremely
pleased with his golfers' perfor
mance. "We played extremely
well," he said. "The two teams
that beat us(USC and Arizona
State) and UCLA (with whom
the men tied) are all in the top 10
nationally. I'm very proud of the
guys."
As is true with many goll tour
naments. the final moments on
the 18th green proved the most
dramatic.
Skilling came into the final
round in first place. After the
second round, he was tied for
first. During the third, he gained
a stroke on the rest of the field.
In his final foursome was an

Arizona State golfer, Jim Ber
tocino, with whom Skillingeven
tually tied.
The Stanford sophomore's
drive off the 18th tee went into
the woods. But he played out of
them well and was on the green
with a chance for a birdie and the
tournament championship.
In the meantime, Bertoncino
had carded an incredible eagle to
put him in a tie for first. The
pressure was on for Skilling.
His birdie putt, however, rol
led just a few feet short of the
cup. As he faced the final putt, he
knew that he had to make it to tie
for medalist honors. He knocked
it in.
Yates practically singled out
the entire remainder of the team
for kudos. He seemed especially
proud of Ken Bakst and Steve
Schroeder for "providing out
standing senior leadership."
Yates did note, however, that
"We needed a win to assure us of
an invitation to the NCAA tour
nament," to be held later this
month. "But," he continued,
"We can't be counted out just
yet. Our chances for an invita
tion are fair. Compared to last
year, we've played better at
every single tournament."
And of course he was espe
cially pleased with yesterday's
third-pi ace performance.
"Lookingat the way we played, I
think we deserve a shot at the
NCAAs," he said.
