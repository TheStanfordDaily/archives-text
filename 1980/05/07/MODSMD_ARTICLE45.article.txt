U.K. commando raid frees hostages
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
yesterday the daring commando assault that ended the Ira
nian Embassy siege "made us all . . . proud to be British,"
and expressed hope it will encourage Iran to free the 53
Americans held hostage there.
She went before an exultant I louse of Commons the day
after the spectacular rescue of 1hostages — three Britons,
the rest believed to be Iranians. Mrs. Thatcher referred to
the "brilliant operation" carried out with "courage and
confidence."
"I believe the way the operation was carried out in this
country will have an effect on the future position with
regard to the American hostages in Iran." she said.
The raid on the embassy by eight members of the elite
Special Air Service regiment was undertaken after the Ira
nian Arab separatist gunmen holding the building mur
dered one of their hostages Monday, and possibly two.
Commandos backed by police stormed the embassy to
end the six-day siege in one of the most dramatic scenes
witnessed in London since World War II.
Amid a crackle of gunfire and the blast of two explosions
set oft by the commandos, the 19 remaining hostages were
rescued. Scotland Yard said at least four terrorists died in
the raid and their bodies were still in the fire-gutted build
ing.
Another body in a London hospital may be either a
terrorist or a hostage, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
One terrorist was captured alive.
Former Prime Minister James Callaghan. leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr should be told it is his government's duty to
resume control in Iran and free the American hostages.
Bani-Sadr sent a message of gratitude to the British go\ -
ernment for the safe release of the hostages. Thatcher told
the Commons that in her reply she spelled out to him "what
I believe to be the legal responsibility of each and every
government to look after the safety of diplomats on their
territory."
Carter stiffens Cuban refugee policy
WASHINGTON — As the number of refugees pouring
into Florida reached 18,000. the Carter administration an
nounced actions yesterday to shore up the nation's ragged
refugee policy. The president:
— Declared a state of emergency in Florida, making
federal tunds available to local governments struggling to
provide tood and shelter for both Cuban and Haitian re
fugees.
— Said that the United States would escalate its efforts to
enlist the participation of other Western Hemisphere na
tions in resettling refugees. Included in those efforts is a
conference beginning tomorrow in Costa Rica in response
to the refugee crisis.
Beleaguered Florida officials had met with administra
tion officials several times to seek reimbursement for local
governments that have been strained in pro\ iding reception
facilities for the refugees, as many as 3600 Cubans in a
single day.
The president's emergency declaration provides open
ended funds administered through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. This commitment follows Carter's
authorization last Friday to use up to $10 million from his
emergency fund to set up resettlement centers such as the
V'tent city' at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhan
dle
In another action, the Department of Agriculture an
nounced yesterday that food stamps would be made availa

through agencies in Florida.
Jody Powell. White House press secretary, said that Car
ter welcomed the international conference called by Presi
dent Rodrigo Carazo Odio of Costa Rica in response to th$
refugee crisis. The United States. Powell said, will "aggres
sively pursue efforts to obtain regional cooperation in find
ing a solution to the problem."
Several Florida officials who met with Carter yesterday
applauded the idea of a hemispheric approach to the re
fugee problem. Those officials have estimated that the first
week of the influx of refugees had cost Florida and Dade
County (Miami) about $600,000 in added expenses.
Tito's funeral draws foreign leaders
BELGRADE. Yugoslavia — Premier Hua Guofeng of
China was the first foreign political leader to arrive in
Belgrade yesterday for what is expected to be the largest
international funeral of the postwar era.
Since Yugoslav President Josip Tito, who died Sunday.

was a leading independent Communist and a founder of the
non-aligned nations' movement, top-ranking officials of
more than 100 countries are expected to arrive before the
services and burial are conducted tomorrow.
Hua, who visited Yugoslavia three years ago and received
Tito in Peking in 1978. encouraged the Belgrade policy of
national Communism against the influence of the Com
munist Party of the Soviet Union with which Tito broke in
1948.
Soon after Peking announced that Hua would attend the
Belgrade services. Moscow disclosed that President Leonid
Brezhnev would lead the Soviet delegation here.
■ Among the Western leaders expected to arrive today are
Prince Philip and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain. President Karl Carstens and Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt of West Germany and Premier Raymond Barre of
France.
Ihe Linited States delegation will be headed by Vice
President Walter Mondale, who is well-known to the
Yugoslavs from a previous visit to Belgrade.

gures attended a memorial service at the Trade Union
headquarters.
The eulogy was delivered by Vladimir Bakarach. a
member of both the collective national presidency and
Communist Party chairmanship and best-known of Tito's
long-time aides.
After summarizing Tito's career as party chairman from
1937. leader of the Partisan forces that fought the German
and Italian occupying troops during World War II and
creator of the modern Yugoslav federation. Bakarach con
cluded that the country could "see the only possible option"
was to pursue the dead leader's policies.
"We shall resolutely defend this choice we have made
with all the means of a sovereign state and of an indepen
dent revolution," he said.
Nearby, at the Federal Parliament building, the closed
coffin containing Tito's bod\ was viewed by thousands of
Yugoslavs in the first 24 hours of official homage.
Fed's money policy may be too tight
NEW — With the nation's economy slipping
rapidly into what may be a severe recession, there is mount
ing pressure on the government to reverse some policies
imposed to fight inflation.
Words like "overkill" are being heard from economists as
they survey the results of the tight-money and credit
control policies ordered as inflation soared early in the year.
Unemployment appears to be rising rapidly, car sales are
dropping and some economists believe the recession could
be deeper than the 1974-75 slump that was the sharpest
downturn since the Great Depression.
"The free fall in economic activity may be without prece
dent in the postwar period." said Allen Sinai of Data Re
sources Inc.. an economic forecasting firm.
A casualty of the recession could be the controls on
consumer credit, which were imposed in March in an effort
to make it more expensive to extend credit to consumers.
Some economists think the controls will be lifted by the end
of the summer. /
And yesterday the Federal Reserve eased one part of the
March tight-money package, removing a surcharge of three
percentage points it imposed on some loans to major banks.
It said that action reflected thedechne in other interest rates
banks pay to acquire funds.
Consumers were already showing signs of cutting spend
ing before the controls were imposed, and the reductions
are continuing.
The AFL-CIO yesterday called for more government
spending, including expanded public works and jobs prog
rams. "Fiscal actions of the government must be directed to
countering the recession and to softening the economic
crunch felt by the unemployed and the poor," the labor
group's executive council said.
The Federal Reserve has already shown its willingness to
allow interest rates to decline, and the fall in money-market
interest rates has been the sharpest ever. The interest rate
on six-month I reasury bills, which was 15.7 percent in late
March, tell to 9.495 percent this wdek.
Mortgage rates headed slowly down
WASHINGTON — The developing recession will push
mortgage rates down to between 12 percent and 14 percent
by the end of the year, but the slump-ridden housing indus
try faces a slow and agonizing recovery, economists predict.
Many potential homebuyers will be unable to take advan
tage of the lower rates because of rising joblessness and
reduced work weeks, the economists said yesterday.

Moreover, many people have gone through their savings
and borrowed too heavily to huv a home now, they said.
The panel of economists addressed a conference spon
sored by the National Association of Homebuilders.
The recent sharp decline in short-term interest rates has
led to a slight erosion in mortgage rates from 17 percent to
15 percent and 16 percent, housing experts report.
"Even if mortgage rates decline substantially, we face a
very slow, agonizing recovery in housing," said Leonard
Santow, a consultant tor the J. Henrv Schroder Banking
Corp.
J. Jeffrey Green, of Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates, noted that people's disposable incomes — al
ready undercut by rising income taxes, energy costs and
inflation — will sutler another blow from a scheduled $15
billion increase in Social Security taxes in fiscal 1981.
"That large increase comes precisely at the (predicted)
trough of the recession," he said.
Papal journey lands in Kenya
NAIROBI, Kenya — Pope John Paul 11, on a mission to
encourage Christianity in Africa, arrived in Kenya yester
day at the midpoint of a 10-day, six-nation tour.
Kenya is the only country on the pope's itinerary with a
majority of Christians, about 57 percent of the population.
Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics but there are
about 2.8 million Catholics, or 18 percent of Kenya's popu
lation.
The airliner carrying the pope flew from Kisangani, in
eastern Zaire, where John Paul had spent the night. The
pope crosses the continent again tomorrow when he flies to
Ghana, Upper Volta and Ivory Coast.
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, an honor guard,
some 5000 young people and thousands from Roman
C atholic dioceses around the country were on hand to greet
the pontiff. The young people were given a special place at
the airport after the pope was unable to fit a planned youth
rally into his schedule.
The pope's profound words had come, however, in
Kisangani during an early-morning Mass on the shore of the
Congo River. There he dealt with special eloquence with
Africa s fundamental problem, the rural poor and the need
for better agriculture.
He was to meet diplomats based in Nairobi later in the
evening. The high point of his visit will be an outdoor Mass
today in a central Nairobi park, where some 500,000 faith
ful are expected to gather.
Cooperation among Christian churches is expected to be
one of his major themes in this center for Christian
ecumenism in Africa.
16-year-old hijacks Portugal jetliner
MADRID, Spain — A pistol-waving teenager hijacked a
Portuguese jetliner yesterday and forced it to land in Mad
rid, where he demanded a $10 million ransom but then
freed all of the other 82 passengers, police reported.
They said the sky pirate, identified as 16-year-old Rui
Manuel da Costa Rodrigues. was holding only the seven
crew members and had ordered the plane be refueled for a
flight to Switzerland.
The Boeing 727 of Portugal's national airline TAP was
parked at a remote point on the airfield, surrounded by
police, and hours after it landed there were no signs it was
being refueled.
A Swedish diplomat was the last passenger to be released.
A number of Scandinavian tourists who had beenboundfor
resorts in southern Portugal were among the passengers
allowed to leave the craft earlier.
The passengers said Rodrigues was sitting in the first
class section when he told cabin attendants he was ill and
wanted to go to the washroom. He then forced his way into
the pilots' compartment, brandishing a pistol, and was
"very nervous," they said.
He forced the pilot to fly to Madrid, 310 miles east of
Lisbon, and the plane touched down at Barajas Airport at
1 1:25 p.m. Spain and Portugal share the Iberian peninsula.
Draft registration funding left uncut
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's draft re
gistration plan passed a major test yesterday when the
Senate Appropriations Committee refused to make any
cuts in the $13.3 million needed to carry out the program.
By a 1 7-9 vote, the panel refused to reduce an appropria
tion for the Selective Service System to $4.7 million — an
amount sufficient only to upgrade the agency's computers,
but not to start actual registration of youngsters for the
draft.

Carter's plan still faces other challenges in the committee
before it goes to the Senate floor, which probably will be its
last stop in Congress.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said he would'propose
amendments in the committee to require women, as well as
men, to register, as Carter originally proposed.
Congress defeats GOP tax cut bills
WASHINGTON — Both houses of Congress yesterday
defeated Republican proposals for a tax cut of $30 billion or
more next year as they moved jointly toward approval of a
balanced-budget spending target for 1981.
In both cases, the Republicans would have maintained or
expanded proposed outlays for defense while slashing
domestic programs to provide money for the tax cut.
By a vote of 35 to 59, with many Republicans joining
most Democrats in a display of bipartisan support for their
Budget Committee, the Senate rejected a proposal for Sens.
William Armstrong (R-Colo.) and William Roth (R-Del.)
to cut taxes by $30 billion.
Only minutes earlier, the House, voting 1 75 to 242 along
sharply partisan lines, turned down an official Republican
Party proposal offered by Rep. Delbert Latta (R-Ohio) to
sanction a tax cut of $32 billion.
Then, the House, on a much closer vote of 191 to 218,
rejected another $30-billion-range tax cut proposal by Rep.
John Rousselot (R-Calif.) which also assumed repeal of-
President Jimmy Carter's controversial oil import fee that
will raise the pump price of gasoline by 10 cents a gallon.
The Armstrong-Roth proposal would have cut heavily
into existing food stamp and job programs, along with
trimming other domestic outlays, in exchange for lower
taxes on savings and investments, tax adjustments to pro
tect individuals from the "inflation creep" in tax rates and
tax incentives for business and expansion.
In both houses. Democratic leaders described the Repub
lican tax cut proposals as politically alluring siren's songs
that would do the economy more harm than good.

ground.

non-aligned nations' movement, top-ranking officials of
more than 100 countries are expected to arrive before the
services and burial are conducted tomorrow.
Hua, who visited Yugoslavia three years ago and received
Tito in Peking in 1978. encouraged the Belgrade policy of
national Communism against the influence of the Com
munist Party of the Soviet Union with which Tito broke in
1948.
Soon after Peking announced that Hua would attend the
Belgrade services. Moscow disclosed that President Leonid
Brezhnev would lead the Soviet delegation here.
■ Among the Western leaders expected to arrive today are
Prince Philip and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of
Britain. President Karl Carstens and Chancellor Helmut
Schmidt of West Germany and Premier Raymond Barre of
France.

1937. leader of the Partisan forces that fought the German
and Italian occupying troops during World War II and
creator of the modern Yugoslav federation. Bakarach con

Fed's money policy may be too tight
NEW — With the nation's economy slipping
rapidly into what may be a severe recession, there is mount
ing pressure on the government to reverse some policies
imposed to fight inflation.
Words like "overkill" are being heard from economists as
they survey the results of the tight-money and credit
control policies ordered as inflation soared early in the year.
Unemployment appears to be rising rapidly, car sales are
dropping and some economists believe the recession could
be deeper than the 1974-75 slump that was the sharpest
downturn since the Great Depression.
"The free fall in economic activity may be without prece
dent in the postwar period." said Allen Sinai of Data Re
sources Inc.. an economic forecasting firm.
A casualty of the recession could be the controls on
consumer credit, which were imposed in March in an effort
to make it more expensive to extend credit to consumers.
Some economists think the controls will be lifted by the end
of the summer. /
And yesterday the Federal Reserve eased one part of the
March tight-money package, removing a surcharge of three
percentage points it imposed on some loans to major banks.
It said that action reflected thedechne in other interest rates
banks pay to acquire funds.
Consumers were already showing signs of cutting spend
ing before the controls were imposed, and the reductions
are continuing.
The AFL-CIO yesterday called for more government
spending, including expanded public works and jobs prog
rams. "Fiscal actions of the government must be directed to
countering the recession and to softening the economic
crunch felt by the unemployed and the poor," the labor
group's executive council said.
The Federal Reserve has already shown its willingness to
allow interest rates to decline, and the fall in money-market
interest rates has been the sharpest ever. The interest rate
on six-month I reasury bills, which was 15.7 percent in late
March, tell to 9.495 percent this wdek.
Mortgage rates headed slowly down
WASHINGTON — The developing recession will push
mortgage rates down to between 12 percent and 14 percent
by the end of the year, but the slump-ridden housing indus
try faces a slow and agonizing recovery, economists predict.
Many potential homebuyers will be unable to take advan
tage of the lower rates because of rising joblessness and
reduced work weeks, the economists said yesterday.

Moreover, many people have gone through their savings
and borrowed too heavily to huv a home now, they said.
The panel of economists addressed a conference spon
sored by the National Association of Homebuilders.
The recent sharp decline in short-term interest rates has
led to a slight erosion in mortgage rates from 17 percent to
15 percent and 16 percent, housing experts report.
"Even if mortgage rates decline substantially, we face a
very slow, agonizing recovery in housing," said Leonard
Santow, a consultant tor the J. Henrv Schroder Banking
Corp.
J. Jeffrey Green, of Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates, noted that people's disposable incomes — al
ready undercut by rising income taxes, energy costs and
inflation — will sutler another blow from a scheduled $15
billion increase in Social Security taxes in fiscal 1981.
"That large increase comes precisely at the (predicted)
trough of the recession," he said.
Papal journey lands in Kenya
NAIROBI, Kenya — Pope John Paul 11, on a mission to
encourage Christianity in Africa, arrived in Kenya yester
day at the midpoint of a 10-day, six-nation tour.
Kenya is the only country on the pope's itinerary with a
majority of Christians, about 57 percent of the population.
Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics but there are
about 2.8 million Catholics, or 18 percent of Kenya's popu
lation.
The airliner carrying the pope flew from Kisangani, in
eastern Zaire, where John Paul had spent the night. The
pope crosses the continent again tomorrow when he flies to
Ghana, Upper Volta and Ivory Coast.
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, an honor guard,
some 5000 young people and thousands from Roman
C atholic dioceses around the country were on hand to greet
the pontiff. The young people were given a special place at
the airport after the pope was unable to fit a planned youth
rally into his schedule.
The pope's profound words had come, however, in
Kisangani during an early-morning Mass on the shore of the
Congo River. There he dealt with special eloquence with
Africa s fundamental problem, the rural poor and the need
for better agriculture.
He was to meet diplomats based in Nairobi later in the
evening. The high point of his visit will be an outdoor Mass
today in a central Nairobi park, where some 500,000 faith
ful are expected to gather.
Cooperation among Christian churches is expected to be
one of his major themes in this center for Christian
ecumenism in Africa.
16-year-old hijacks Portugal jetliner
MADRID, Spain — A pistol-waving teenager hijacked a
Portuguese jetliner yesterday and forced it to land in Mad
rid, where he demanded a $10 million ransom but then
freed all of the other 82 passengers, police reported.
They said the sky pirate, identified as 16-year-old Rui
Manuel da Costa Rodrigues. was holding only the seven
crew members and had ordered the plane be refueled for a
flight to Switzerland.
The Boeing 727 of Portugal's national airline TAP was
parked at a remote point on the airfield, surrounded by
police, and hours after it landed there were no signs it was
being refueled.
A Swedish diplomat was the last passenger to be released.
A number of Scandinavian tourists who had beenboundfor
resorts in southern Portugal were among the passengers
allowed to leave the craft earlier.
The passengers said Rodrigues was sitting in the first
class section when he told cabin attendants he was ill and
wanted to go to the washroom. He then forced his way into
the pilots' compartment, brandishing a pistol, and was
"very nervous," they said.
He forced the pilot to fly to Madrid, 310 miles east of
Lisbon, and the plane touched down at Barajas Airport at
1 1:25 p.m. Spain and Portugal share the Iberian peninsula.
Draft registration funding left uncut
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's draft re
gistration plan passed a major test yesterday when the
Senate Appropriations Committee refused to make any
cuts in the $13.3 million needed to carry out the program.
By a 1 7-9 vote, the panel refused to reduce an appropria
tion for the Selective Service System to $4.7 million — an
amount sufficient only to upgrade the agency's computers,
but not to start actual registration of youngsters for the
draft.

Carter's plan still faces other challenges in the committee
before it goes to the Senate floor, which probably will be its
last stop in Congress.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said he would'propose
amendments in the committee to require women, as well as
men, to register, as Carter originally proposed.
Congress defeats GOP tax cut bills
WASHINGTON — Both houses of Congress yesterday
defeated Republican proposals for a tax cut of $30 billion or
more next year as they moved jointly toward approval of a
balanced-budget spending target for 1981.
In both cases, the Republicans would have maintained or
expanded proposed outlays for defense while slashing
domestic programs to provide money for the tax cut.
By a vote of 35 to 59, with many Republicans joining
most Democrats in a display of bipartisan support for their
Budget Committee, the Senate rejected a proposal for Sens.
William Armstrong (R-Colo.) and William Roth (R-Del.)
to cut taxes by $30 billion.
Only minutes earlier, the House, voting 1 75 to 242 along
sharply partisan lines, turned down an official Republican
Party proposal offered by Rep. Delbert Latta (R-Ohio) to
sanction a tax cut of $32 billion.
Then, the House, on a much closer vote of 191 to 218,
rejected another $30-billion-range tax cut proposal by Rep.
John Rousselot (R-Calif.) which also assumed repeal of-
President Jimmy Carter's controversial oil import fee that
will raise the pump price of gasoline by 10 cents a gallon.
The Armstrong-Roth proposal would have cut heavily
into existing food stamp and job programs, along with
trimming other domestic outlays, in exchange for lower
taxes on savings and investments, tax adjustments to pro
tect individuals from the "inflation creep" in tax rates and
tax incentives for business and expansion.
In both houses. Democratic leaders described the Repub
lican tax cut proposals as politically alluring siren's songs
that would do the economy more harm than good.

U.K. commando raid frees hostages
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
yesterday the daring commando assault that ended the Ira
nian Embassy siege "made us all . . . proud to be British,"
and expressed hope it will encourage Iran to free the 53
Americans held hostage there.
She went before an exultant I louse of Commons the day
after the spectacular rescue of 1hostages — three Britons,
the rest believed to be Iranians. Mrs. Thatcher referred to
the "brilliant operation" carried out with "courage and
confidence."
"I believe the way the operation was carried out in this
country will have an effect on the future position with
regard to the American hostages in Iran." she said.
The raid on the embassy by eight members of the elite
Special Air Service regiment was undertaken after the Ira
nian Arab separatist gunmen holding the building mur
dered one of their hostages Monday, and possibly two.
Commandos backed by police stormed the embassy to
end the six-day siege in one of the most dramatic scenes
witnessed in London since World War II.
Amid a crackle of gunfire and the blast of two explosions
set oft by the commandos, the 19 remaining hostages were
rescued. Scotland Yard said at least four terrorists died in
the raid and their bodies were still in the fire-gutted build
ing.
Another body in a London hospital may be either a
terrorist or a hostage, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
One terrorist was captured alive.
Former Prime Minister James Callaghan. leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr should be told it is his government's duty to
resume control in Iran and free the American hostages.
Bani-Sadr sent a message of gratitude to the British go\ -
ernment for the safe release of the hostages. Thatcher told
the Commons that in her reply she spelled out to him "what
I believe to be the legal responsibility of each and every
government to look after the safety of diplomats on their
territory."

Fed's money policy may be too tight
NEW — With the nation's economy slipping
rapidly into what may be a severe recession, there is mount
ing pressure on the government to reverse some policies
imposed to fight inflation.
Words like "overkill" are being heard from economists as
they survey the results of the tight-money and credit
control policies ordered as inflation soared early in the year.
Unemployment appears to be rising rapidly, car sales are
dropping and some economists believe the recession could
be deeper than the 1974-75 slump that was the sharpest
downturn since the Great Depression.
"The free fall in economic activity may be without prece
dent in the postwar period." said Allen Sinai of Data Re
sources Inc.. an economic forecasting firm.
A casualty of the recession could be the controls on
consumer credit, which were imposed in March in an effort
to make it more expensive to extend credit to consumers.
Some economists think the controls will be lifted by the end
of the summer. /
And yesterday the Federal Reserve eased one part of the
March tight-money package, removing a surcharge of three
percentage points it imposed on some loans to major banks.
It said that action reflected thedechne in other interest rates
banks pay to acquire funds.
Consumers were already showing signs of cutting spend
ing before the controls were imposed, and the reductions
are continuing.
The AFL-CIO yesterday called for more government
spending, including expanded public works and jobs prog
rams. "Fiscal actions of the government must be directed to
countering the recession and to softening the economic
crunch felt by the unemployed and the poor," the labor
group's executive council said.
The Federal Reserve has already shown its willingness to
allow interest rates to decline, and the fall in money-market
interest rates has been the sharpest ever. The interest rate
on six-month I reasury bills, which was 15.7 percent in late
March, tell to 9.495 percent this wdek.
Mortgage rates headed slowly down
WASHINGTON — The developing recession will push
mortgage rates down to between 12 percent and 14 percent
by the end of the year, but the slump-ridden housing indus
try faces a slow and agonizing recovery, economists predict.
Many potential homebuyers will be unable to take advan
tage of the lower rates because of rising joblessness and
reduced work weeks, the economists said yesterday.

Moreover, many people have gone through their savings
and borrowed too heavily to huv a home now, they said.
The panel of economists addressed a conference spon
sored by the National Association of Homebuilders.
The recent sharp decline in short-term interest rates has
led to a slight erosion in mortgage rates from 17 percent to
15 percent and 16 percent, housing experts report.
"Even if mortgage rates decline substantially, we face a
very slow, agonizing recovery in housing," said Leonard
Santow, a consultant tor the J. Henrv Schroder Banking
Corp.
J. Jeffrey Green, of Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates, noted that people's disposable incomes — al
ready undercut by rising income taxes, energy costs and
inflation — will sutler another blow from a scheduled $15
billion increase in Social Security taxes in fiscal 1981.
"That large increase comes precisely at the (predicted)
trough of the recession," he said.
Papal journey lands in Kenya
NAIROBI, Kenya — Pope John Paul 11, on a mission to
encourage Christianity in Africa, arrived in Kenya yester
day at the midpoint of a 10-day, six-nation tour.
Kenya is the only country on the pope's itinerary with a
majority of Christians, about 57 percent of the population.
Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics but there are
about 2.8 million Catholics, or 18 percent of Kenya's popu
lation.
The airliner carrying the pope flew from Kisangani, in
eastern Zaire, where John Paul had spent the night. The
pope crosses the continent again tomorrow when he flies to
Ghana, Upper Volta and Ivory Coast.
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, an honor guard,
some 5000 young people and thousands from Roman
C atholic dioceses around the country were on hand to greet
the pontiff. The young people were given a special place at
the airport after the pope was unable to fit a planned youth
rally into his schedule.
The pope's profound words had come, however, in
Kisangani during an early-morning Mass on the shore of the
Congo River. There he dealt with special eloquence with
Africa s fundamental problem, the rural poor and the need
for better agriculture.
He was to meet diplomats based in Nairobi later in the
evening. The high point of his visit will be an outdoor Mass
today in a central Nairobi park, where some 500,000 faith
ful are expected to gather.
Cooperation among Christian churches is expected to be
one of his major themes in this center for Christian
ecumenism in Africa.
16-year-old hijacks Portugal jetliner
MADRID, Spain — A pistol-waving teenager hijacked a
Portuguese jetliner yesterday and forced it to land in Mad
rid, where he demanded a $10 million ransom but then
freed all of the other 82 passengers, police reported.
They said the sky pirate, identified as 16-year-old Rui
Manuel da Costa Rodrigues. was holding only the seven
crew members and had ordered the plane be refueled for a
flight to Switzerland.
The Boeing 727 of Portugal's national airline TAP was
parked at a remote point on the airfield, surrounded by
police, and hours after it landed there were no signs it was
being refueled.
A Swedish diplomat was the last passenger to be released.
A number of Scandinavian tourists who had beenboundfor
resorts in southern Portugal were among the passengers
allowed to leave the craft earlier.
The passengers said Rodrigues was sitting in the first
class section when he told cabin attendants he was ill and
wanted to go to the washroom. He then forced his way into
the pilots' compartment, brandishing a pistol, and was
"very nervous," they said.
He forced the pilot to fly to Madrid, 310 miles east of
Lisbon, and the plane touched down at Barajas Airport at
1 1:25 p.m. Spain and Portugal share the Iberian peninsula.
Draft registration funding left uncut
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's draft re
gistration plan passed a major test yesterday when the
Senate Appropriations Committee refused to make any
cuts in the $13.3 million needed to carry out the program.
By a 1 7-9 vote, the panel refused to reduce an appropria
tion for the Selective Service System to $4.7 million — an
amount sufficient only to upgrade the agency's computers,
but not to start actual registration of youngsters for the
draft.

Carter's plan still faces other challenges in the committee
before it goes to the Senate floor, which probably will be its
last stop in Congress.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said he would'propose
amendments in the committee to require women, as well as
men, to register, as Carter originally proposed.
Congress defeats GOP tax cut bills
WASHINGTON — Both houses of Congress yesterday
defeated Republican proposals for a tax cut of $30 billion or
more next year as they moved jointly toward approval of a
balanced-budget spending target for 1981.
In both cases, the Republicans would have maintained or
expanded proposed outlays for defense while slashing
domestic programs to provide money for the tax cut.
By a vote of 35 to 59, with many Republicans joining
most Democrats in a display of bipartisan support for their
Budget Committee, the Senate rejected a proposal for Sens.
William Armstrong (R-Colo.) and William Roth (R-Del.)
to cut taxes by $30 billion.
Only minutes earlier, the House, voting 1 75 to 242 along
sharply partisan lines, turned down an official Republican
Party proposal offered by Rep. Delbert Latta (R-Ohio) to
sanction a tax cut of $32 billion.
Then, the House, on a much closer vote of 191 to 218,
rejected another $30-billion-range tax cut proposal by Rep.
John Rousselot (R-Calif.) which also assumed repeal of-
President Jimmy Carter's controversial oil import fee that
will raise the pump price of gasoline by 10 cents a gallon.
The Armstrong-Roth proposal would have cut heavily
into existing food stamp and job programs, along with
trimming other domestic outlays, in exchange for lower
taxes on savings and investments, tax adjustments to pro
tect individuals from the "inflation creep" in tax rates and
tax incentives for business and expansion.
In both houses. Democratic leaders described the Repub
lican tax cut proposals as politically alluring siren's songs
that would do the economy more harm than good.

U.K. commando raid frees hostages
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
yesterday the daring commando assault that ended the Ira
nian Embassy siege "made us all . . . proud to be British,"
and expressed hope it will encourage Iran to free the 53
Americans held hostage there.
She went before an exultant I louse of Commons the day
after the spectacular rescue of 1hostages — three Britons,
the rest believed to be Iranians. Mrs. Thatcher referred to
the "brilliant operation" carried out with "courage and
confidence."
"I believe the way the operation was carried out in this
country will have an effect on the future position with
regard to the American hostages in Iran." she said.
The raid on the embassy by eight members of the elite
Special Air Service regiment was undertaken after the Ira
nian Arab separatist gunmen holding the building mur
dered one of their hostages Monday, and possibly two.
Commandos backed by police stormed the embassy to
end the six-day siege in one of the most dramatic scenes
witnessed in London since World War II.
Amid a crackle of gunfire and the blast of two explosions
set oft by the commandos, the 19 remaining hostages were
rescued. Scotland Yard said at least four terrorists died in
the raid and their bodies were still in the fire-gutted build
ing.
Another body in a London hospital may be either a
terrorist or a hostage, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
One terrorist was captured alive.
Former Prime Minister James Callaghan. leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr should be told it is his government's duty to
resume control in Iran and free the American hostages.
Bani-Sadr sent a message of gratitude to the British go\ -
ernment for the safe release of the hostages. Thatcher told
the Commons that in her reply she spelled out to him "what
I believe to be the legal responsibility of each and every
government to look after the safety of diplomats on their
territory."
Carter stiffens Cuban refugee policy
WASHINGTON — As the number of refugees pouring
into Florida reached 18,000. the Carter administration an
nounced actions yesterday to shore up the nation's ragged
refugee policy. The president:
— Declared a state of emergency in Florida, making
federal tunds available to local governments struggling to
provide tood and shelter for both Cuban and Haitian re
fugees.
— Said that the United States would escalate its efforts to
enlist the participation of other Western Hemisphere na
tions in resettling refugees. Included in those efforts is a
conference beginning tomorrow in Costa Rica in response
to the refugee crisis.
Beleaguered Florida officials had met with administra
tion officials several times to seek reimbursement for local
governments that have been strained in pro\ iding reception
facilities for the refugees, as many as 3600 Cubans in a
single day.
The president's emergency declaration provides open
ended funds administered through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. This commitment follows Carter's
authorization last Friday to use up to $10 million from his
emergency fund to set up resettlement centers such as the
V'tent city' at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhan
dle
In another action, the Department of Agriculture an
nounced yesterday that food stamps would be made availa
ble to Haitian and Cuban refugees who are not being fed
through agencies in Florida.
Jody Powell. White House press secretary, said that Car
ter welcomed the international conference called by Presi
dent Rodrigo Carazo Odio of Costa Rica in response to th$
refugee crisis. The United States. Powell said, will "aggres
sively pursue efforts to obtain regional cooperation in find
ing a solution to the problem."
Several Florida officials who met with Carter yesterday
applauded the idea of a hemispheric approach to the re
fugee problem. Those officials have estimated that the first
week of the influx of refugees had cost Florida and Dade
County (Miami) about $600,000 in added expenses.

Mortgage rates headed slowly down
WASHINGTON — The developing recession will push
mortgage rates down to between 12 percent and 14 percent
by the end of the year, but the slump-ridden housing indus
try faces a slow and agonizing recovery, economists predict.
Many potential homebuyers will be unable to take advan
tage of the lower rates because of rising joblessness and
reduced work weeks, the economists said yesterday.

Moreover, many people have gone through their savings
and borrowed too heavily to huv a home now, they said.
The panel of economists addressed a conference spon
sored by the National Association of Homebuilders.
The recent sharp decline in short-term interest rates has
led to a slight erosion in mortgage rates from 17 percent to
15 percent and 16 percent, housing experts report.
"Even if mortgage rates decline substantially, we face a
very slow, agonizing recovery in housing," said Leonard
Santow, a consultant tor the J. Henrv Schroder Banking
Corp.
J. Jeffrey Green, of Wharton Econometric Forecasting
Associates, noted that people's disposable incomes — al
ready undercut by rising income taxes, energy costs and
inflation — will sutler another blow from a scheduled $15
billion increase in Social Security taxes in fiscal 1981.
"That large increase comes precisely at the (predicted)
trough of the recession," he said.
Papal journey lands in Kenya
NAIROBI, Kenya — Pope John Paul 11, on a mission to
encourage Christianity in Africa, arrived in Kenya yester
day at the midpoint of a 10-day, six-nation tour.
Kenya is the only country on the pope's itinerary with a
majority of Christians, about 57 percent of the population.
Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics but there are
about 2.8 million Catholics, or 18 percent of Kenya's popu
lation.
The airliner carrying the pope flew from Kisangani, in
eastern Zaire, where John Paul had spent the night. The
pope crosses the continent again tomorrow when he flies to
Ghana, Upper Volta and Ivory Coast.
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, an honor guard,
some 5000 young people and thousands from Roman
C atholic dioceses around the country were on hand to greet
the pontiff. The young people were given a special place at
the airport after the pope was unable to fit a planned youth
rally into his schedule.
The pope's profound words had come, however, in
Kisangani during an early-morning Mass on the shore of the
Congo River. There he dealt with special eloquence with
Africa s fundamental problem, the rural poor and the need
for better agriculture.
He was to meet diplomats based in Nairobi later in the
evening. The high point of his visit will be an outdoor Mass
today in a central Nairobi park, where some 500,000 faith
ful are expected to gather.
Cooperation among Christian churches is expected to be
one of his major themes in this center for Christian
ecumenism in Africa.
16-year-old hijacks Portugal jetliner
MADRID, Spain — A pistol-waving teenager hijacked a
Portuguese jetliner yesterday and forced it to land in Mad
rid, where he demanded a $10 million ransom but then
freed all of the other 82 passengers, police reported.
They said the sky pirate, identified as 16-year-old Rui
Manuel da Costa Rodrigues. was holding only the seven
crew members and had ordered the plane be refueled for a
flight to Switzerland.
The Boeing 727 of Portugal's national airline TAP was
parked at a remote point on the airfield, surrounded by
police, and hours after it landed there were no signs it was
being refueled.
A Swedish diplomat was the last passenger to be released.
A number of Scandinavian tourists who had beenboundfor
resorts in southern Portugal were among the passengers
allowed to leave the craft earlier.
The passengers said Rodrigues was sitting in the first
class section when he told cabin attendants he was ill and
wanted to go to the washroom. He then forced his way into
the pilots' compartment, brandishing a pistol, and was
"very nervous," they said.
He forced the pilot to fly to Madrid, 310 miles east of
Lisbon, and the plane touched down at Barajas Airport at
1 1:25 p.m. Spain and Portugal share the Iberian peninsula.
Draft registration funding left uncut
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's draft re
gistration plan passed a major test yesterday when the
Senate Appropriations Committee refused to make any
cuts in the $13.3 million needed to carry out the program.
By a 1 7-9 vote, the panel refused to reduce an appropria
tion for the Selective Service System to $4.7 million — an
amount sufficient only to upgrade the agency's computers,
but not to start actual registration of youngsters for the
draft.

Carter's plan still faces other challenges in the committee
before it goes to the Senate floor, which probably will be its
last stop in Congress.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said he would'propose
amendments in the committee to require women, as well as
men, to register, as Carter originally proposed.
Congress defeats GOP tax cut bills
WASHINGTON — Both houses of Congress yesterday
defeated Republican proposals for a tax cut of $30 billion or
more next year as they moved jointly toward approval of a
balanced-budget spending target for 1981.
In both cases, the Republicans would have maintained or
expanded proposed outlays for defense while slashing
domestic programs to provide money for the tax cut.
By a vote of 35 to 59, with many Republicans joining
most Democrats in a display of bipartisan support for their
Budget Committee, the Senate rejected a proposal for Sens.
William Armstrong (R-Colo.) and William Roth (R-Del.)
to cut taxes by $30 billion.
Only minutes earlier, the House, voting 1 75 to 242 along
sharply partisan lines, turned down an official Republican
Party proposal offered by Rep. Delbert Latta (R-Ohio) to
sanction a tax cut of $32 billion.
Then, the House, on a much closer vote of 191 to 218,
rejected another $30-billion-range tax cut proposal by Rep.
John Rousselot (R-Calif.) which also assumed repeal of-
President Jimmy Carter's controversial oil import fee that
will raise the pump price of gasoline by 10 cents a gallon.
The Armstrong-Roth proposal would have cut heavily
into existing food stamp and job programs, along with
trimming other domestic outlays, in exchange for lower
taxes on savings and investments, tax adjustments to pro
tect individuals from the "inflation creep" in tax rates and
tax incentives for business and expansion.
In both houses. Democratic leaders described the Repub
lican tax cut proposals as politically alluring siren's songs
that would do the economy more harm than good.

U.K. commando raid frees hostages
LONDON — Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
yesterday the daring commando assault that ended the Ira
nian Embassy siege "made us all . . . proud to be British,"
and expressed hope it will encourage Iran to free the 53
Americans held hostage there.
She went before an exultant I louse of Commons the day
after the spectacular rescue of 1hostages — three Britons,
the rest believed to be Iranians. Mrs. Thatcher referred to
the "brilliant operation" carried out with "courage and
confidence."
"I believe the way the operation was carried out in this
country will have an effect on the future position with
regard to the American hostages in Iran." she said.
The raid on the embassy by eight members of the elite
Special Air Service regiment was undertaken after the Ira
nian Arab separatist gunmen holding the building mur
dered one of their hostages Monday, and possibly two.
Commandos backed by police stormed the embassy to
end the six-day siege in one of the most dramatic scenes
witnessed in London since World War II.
Amid a crackle of gunfire and the blast of two explosions
set oft by the commandos, the 19 remaining hostages were
rescued. Scotland Yard said at least four terrorists died in
the raid and their bodies were still in the fire-gutted build
ing.
Another body in a London hospital may be either a
terrorist or a hostage, a Scotland Yard spokeswoman said.
One terrorist was captured alive.
Former Prime Minister James Callaghan. leader of the
opposition Labor Party, said Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr should be told it is his government's duty to
resume control in Iran and free the American hostages.
Bani-Sadr sent a message of gratitude to the British go\ -
ernment for the safe release of the hostages. Thatcher told
the Commons that in her reply she spelled out to him "what
I believe to be the legal responsibility of each and every
government to look after the safety of diplomats on their
territory."
Carter stiffens Cuban refugee policy
WASHINGTON — As the number of refugees pouring
into Florida reached 18,000. the Carter administration an
nounced actions yesterday to shore up the nation's ragged
refugee policy. The president:
— Declared a state of emergency in Florida, making
federal tunds available to local governments struggling to
provide tood and shelter for both Cuban and Haitian re
fugees.
— Said that the United States would escalate its efforts to
enlist the participation of other Western Hemisphere na
tions in resettling refugees. Included in those efforts is a
conference beginning tomorrow in Costa Rica in response
to the refugee crisis.
Beleaguered Florida officials had met with administra
tion officials several times to seek reimbursement for local
governments that have been strained in pro\ iding reception
facilities for the refugees, as many as 3600 Cubans in a
single day.
The president's emergency declaration provides open
ended funds administered through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. This commitment follows Carter's
authorization last Friday to use up to $10 million from his
emergency fund to set up resettlement centers such as the
V'tent city' at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida panhan
dle
In another action, the Department of Agriculture an
nounced yesterday that food stamps would be made availa
ble to Haitian and Cuban refugees who are not being fed
through agencies in Florida.
Jody Powell. White House press secretary, said that Car
ter welcomed the international conference called by Presi
dent Rodrigo Carazo Odio of Costa Rica in response to th$
refugee crisis. The United States. Powell said, will "aggres
sively pursue efforts to obtain regional cooperation in find
ing a solution to the problem."
Several Florida officials who met with Carter yesterday
applauded the idea of a hemispheric approach to the re
fugee problem. Those officials have estimated that the first
week of the influx of refugees had cost Florida and Dade
County (Miami) about $600,000 in added expenses.

Fed's money policy may be too tight
NEW — With the nation's economy slipping
rapidly into what may be a severe recession, there is mount
ing pressure on the government to reverse some policies
imposed to fight inflation.
Words like "overkill" are being heard from economists as
they survey the results of the tight-money and credit
control policies ordered as inflation soared early in the year.
Unemployment appears to be rising rapidly, car sales are
dropping and some economists believe the recession could
be deeper than the 1974-75 slump that was the sharpest
downturn since the Great Depression.

consumer credit, which were imposed in March in an effort
to make it more expensive to extend credit to consumers.

day at the midpoint of a 10-day, six-nation tour.
Kenya is the only country on the pope's itinerary with a
majority of Christians, about 57 percent of the population.
Protestants outnumber Roman Catholics but there are
about 2.8 million Catholics, or 18 percent of Kenya's popu
lation.
The airliner carrying the pope flew from Kisangani, in
eastern Zaire, where John Paul had spent the night. The
pope crosses the continent again tomorrow when he flies to
Ghana, Upper Volta and Ivory Coast.
Kenyan President Daniel Arap Moi, an honor guard,
some 5000 young people and thousands from Roman
C atholic dioceses around the country were on hand to greet
the pontiff. The young people were given a special place at
the airport after the pope was unable to fit a planned youth
rally into his schedule.
The pope's profound words had come, however, in
Kisangani during an early-morning Mass on the shore of the
Congo River. There he dealt with special eloquence with
Africa s fundamental problem, the rural poor and the need
for better agriculture.
He was to meet diplomats based in Nairobi later in the
evening. The high point of his visit will be an outdoor Mass
today in a central Nairobi park, where some 500,000 faith
ful are expected to gather.
Cooperation among Christian churches is expected to be
one of his major themes in this center for Christian
ecumenism in Africa.
16-year-old hijacks Portugal jetliner
MADRID, Spain — A pistol-waving teenager hijacked a
Portuguese jetliner yesterday and forced it to land in Mad
rid, where he demanded a $10 million ransom but then
freed all of the other 82 passengers, police reported.
They said the sky pirate, identified as 16-year-old Rui
Manuel da Costa Rodrigues. was holding only the seven
crew members and had ordered the plane be refueled for a
flight to Switzerland.
The Boeing 727 of Portugal's national airline TAP was
parked at a remote point on the airfield, surrounded by
police, and hours after it landed there were no signs it was
being refueled.
A Swedish diplomat was the last passenger to be released.
A number of Scandinavian tourists who had beenboundfor
resorts in southern Portugal were among the passengers
allowed to leave the craft earlier.
The passengers said Rodrigues was sitting in the first
class section when he told cabin attendants he was ill and
wanted to go to the washroom. He then forced his way into
the pilots' compartment, brandishing a pistol, and was
"very nervous," they said.
He forced the pilot to fly to Madrid, 310 miles east of
Lisbon, and the plane touched down at Barajas Airport at
1 1:25 p.m. Spain and Portugal share the Iberian peninsula.
Draft registration funding left uncut
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter's draft re
gistration plan passed a major test yesterday when the
Senate Appropriations Committee refused to make any
cuts in the $13.3 million needed to carry out the program.
By a 1 7-9 vote, the panel refused to reduce an appropria
tion for the Selective Service System to $4.7 million — an
amount sufficient only to upgrade the agency's computers,
but not to start actual registration of youngsters for the
draft.

Carter's plan still faces other challenges in the committee
before it goes to the Senate floor, which probably will be its
last stop in Congress.
Sen. Mark Hatfield (R-Ore.) said he would'propose
amendments in the committee to require women, as well as
men, to register, as Carter originally proposed.
Congress defeats GOP tax cut bills
WASHINGTON — Both houses of Congress yesterday
defeated Republican proposals for a tax cut of $30 billion or
more next year as they moved jointly toward approval of a
balanced-budget spending target for 1981.
In both cases, the Republicans would have maintained or
expanded proposed outlays for defense while slashing
domestic programs to provide money for the tax cut.
By a vote of 35 to 59, with many Republicans joining
most Democrats in a display of bipartisan support for their
Budget Committee, the Senate rejected a proposal for Sens.
William Armstrong (R-Colo.) and William Roth (R-Del.)
to cut taxes by $30 billion.
Only minutes earlier, the House, voting 1 75 to 242 along
sharply partisan lines, turned down an official Republican
Party proposal offered by Rep. Delbert Latta (R-Ohio) to
sanction a tax cut of $32 billion.
Then, the House, on a much closer vote of 191 to 218,
rejected another $30-billion-range tax cut proposal by Rep.
John Rousselot (R-Calif.) which also assumed repeal of-
President Jimmy Carter's controversial oil import fee that
will raise the pump price of gasoline by 10 cents a gallon.
The Armstrong-Roth proposal would have cut heavily
into existing food stamp and job programs, along with
trimming other domestic outlays, in exchange for lower
taxes on savings and investments, tax adjustments to pro
tect individuals from the "inflation creep" in tax rates and
tax incentives for business and expansion.
In both houses. Democratic leaders described the Repub
lican tax cut proposals as politically alluring siren's songs
that would do the economy more harm than good.
