# Landslide victories in 3 primaries
## Carter and Reagan win again 
### 
From the Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan, the delegate-rich candidates
tor the White House, got richer last
night with landslide victories in the In
diana, North Carolina and Tennessee
presidential primary elections.
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and GOP challenger George Bush
countered bv winning in the District of
Columbia. Kennedy beat Carter while
Bush won uncontested by Reagan.
I'he delegate arithmetic pushed Car
ter past three-quarters of the delegate
strength he needs to win Democratic
renomination. Reagan was leading for
delegates that put him near that same
mark the way to the Republican
nomination.
Among them, the four primaries
awarded 223 Democratic nominating
votes, and in partial returns. Carter led
for 164 of them, to 59 for Kennedy.
That would put Carter's nationwide
total at 1309; he needs 1666 to clinch
the nomination. Kennedy's projected
total is 718.
lim Kraft. Carter's deputy campaign
chief, claimed the president's own pro
jected total puts him about 200 dele
gate votes short of a majority. Kraft
said that should give Kennedy "second
thoughts" about continuing his cam
paign.
White House Press Secretary Jody
Powell said there's no chance Kennedy
will be the Democratic nominee. Pow
ell said it would be Carter versus
Reagan in the fall.
Reagan led for I OS of the 140 GOP
delegates at stake yesterday, a perfor
mance that would swell his total to 744
of the 998 delegates needed. Bush led
for 32 delegates to bring his count to
170.
Despite the setbacks. Bush's cam
paign manager said the challenger
would come back. "We've been buried
three times in this campaign," said
James Baker. "We fully expect to be
back."
Bush said before the polls closed that
he would neither abandon his quest for

the White House, nor accept the vice
presidential nomination if Reagan of
fered it.
He spent the day campaigning for
New Jersey's June 3 primary.
The light voter turnout in the four
states holding primaries reflected
perhaps the growing public view that
the fighting for the presidential nomi
nations is just about over and Reagan
and Carter probably are unbeatable
unless they stumble somewhere.
The exception was in the District of
Columbia, where voters had a bona
fide magnet for a big turnout — a ballot
measure to legalize some forms of
gambling.
The initiative measure, subject to
congressional veto, was designed to
legalize parimutuel betting on dog rac
ing and jai alai and establish a city-run
lottery and daily numbers game.
Non-profit bingo games and raffles
would be permitted, but the present
ban on casinos and betting on football
and other sports events would remain
in effect.

I hat initiative probably drew more
public interest than the presidential
race, because Reagan's name was not
on the ballot and he did not campaign
in Washington, and because Kennedy
had the field pretty much to himself on
the Democratic side when it came to
campaign activity.
In Nashville. Tennessee, Sen. How
ard Baker said he would run with
Reagan if asked.
It was the heaviest primary schedule
of the season, keynoting a month that
features multiple contests every Tues
day.
It was the North Carolina primary in
1976 that gave Reagan's presidential
campaign a desperately needed shot.
After suffering one defeat after
another in the early primaries, he man
aged to beat then-President Gerald
Ford in the North Carolina test and
went on to make a neck-and-neck race
out of the presidential primaries, only
to lose by 60 votes at the nominating
convention.

He spent the day campaigning for
New Jersey's June 3 primary.
The light voter turnout in the four
states holding primaries reflected
perhaps the growing public view that
the fighting for the presidential nomi
nations is just about over and Reagan
and Carter probably are unbeatable
unless they stumble somewhere.
The exception was in the District of
Columbia, where voters had a bona
fide magnet for a big turnout — a ballot
measure to legalize some forms of
gambling.
The initiative measure, subject to
congressional veto, was designed to
legalize parimutuel betting on dog rac
ing and jai alai and establish a city-run
lottery and daily numbers game.
Non-profit bingo games and raffles
would be permitted, but the present
ban on casinos and betting on football
and other sports events would remain
in effect.

I hat initiative probably drew more
public interest than the presidential
race, because Reagan's name was not
on the ballot and he did not campaign
in Washington, and because Kennedy
had the field pretty much to himself on
the Democratic side when it came to
campaign activity.
In Nashville. Tennessee, Sen. How
ard Baker said he would run with
Reagan if asked.
It was the heaviest primary schedule
of the season, keynoting a month that
features multiple contests every Tues
day.
It was the North Carolina primary in
1976 that gave Reagan's presidential
campaign a desperately needed shot.
After suffering one defeat after
another in the early primaries, he man
aged to beat then-President Gerald
Ford in the North Carolina test and
went on to make a neck-and-neck race
out of the presidential primaries, only
to lose by 60 votes at the nominating
convention.
