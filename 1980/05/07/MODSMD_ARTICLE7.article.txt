# Iran returns bodies
## 
### 
From the Daily wire sen ices
The bodies of the U.S. commandos
killed in an Iranian desert 1 2 days ago
in the aborted attempt to free U.S. hos
tages returned to home soil yesterday
aboard a U.S. Air Force C-141.
Preparations to receive and identify
the charred remains had been made at
Dover Air Force Base, which IK
months ago identified and enbalmed
more than 900 bodies of another
tragedy — the Peoples Temple mass
murder-suicide in the Guyanese
jungle.
The servicemen's bodies arrived at
3:37 p.m. PDT. A 20-man color guard
was on hand to salute the arrival of the
bodies, and chaplains were present for
a brief ceremony, said Lt. Basil Gray,
base spokesman.
Reporters were not allowed on the
base at the time of arrival, but Gray
said plans called for two six-man teams
of pallbearers, one Marine and one Air
Force, to load the bodies onto four
hearses for transport to the mortuary.
"Mortuary officers will make identifi
cations' and final funeral arrange
ments," said Maj. Robert Groom.
The bodies began their journey yes
terday in Tehran, where nine coffins
were loaded aboard a regular Swissair
flight to Zurich, Switzerland, accom
panied by Roman Catholic Archbishop
Hilarion Capudji of the Melkite East
ern Rite of the Church.
U.S. officials have said eight men
died in the Iran mission. But the Ira
nians have variously said nine or 10
bodies were recovered after a helicop
ter and transport plane collided in a
ball of flame.
Capudji said some coffins contained
only hone fragments or charred body
parts. He said that to his knowledge
only three bodies could be identified —
the rest were beyond identification.
After the bodies arrived in Zurich,
they were formally transferred to U.S.
custody in a document-signing cere
mony in an airport hangar. Custody
went from Capudji to officials of the
International Red Cross and the Swiss
government to U.S. Ambassador
Richard Vine.
In Tehran, Iranian authorities went
to great lengths yesterday to stress its i
view that the freeing of their diplomats
in London and the condition of the
American hostages held there are in no
way comparable.
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
and Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh claimed the heroism of
Britain's elite Special Air Service was a
"victory" for Iran and Islam.
Bani-Sadr, in a second message to

the British government, thanked Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, "for the
steadfast acts of the police of your
country ... in this affair of the unjust
hostage taking at the Iranian Embassy
in London ..."
A midday commentary on official
Tehran radio insisted the two cases in
volving diplomatic hostages were "as
different as the earth is from the sky,"
and last night Ghotbzadeh explained
why on television.
"If a foreigner came to Iran and took
over the American Embassy and asked
for the separation of California from
the United States that would not be
acceptable," he said. That was his way
of explaining why Iran ruled out the
London terrorists' demands concern
ing the oil-producing province of
Khuzestan which has a large Arab
minority.
Stressing the "irrelevant compari
son" between the two cases, the radio
commentary reiterated the now famil
iar theme that the seizure of the
American Embassy here represented
"the will of the oppressed nation
against U.S. domination" and "de
monstrated the ugly reality which hides
behind the curtain of diplomatic im
munity."
It insisted that unlike the case of the
American hostages accused of spying
in Tehran, the London diplomats had
"no other duties but to represent their
country" and "were taken hostage by a
group of hired and deceived terrorists"
in the pay of Iraq.
In other developments, Iranian au
thorities arrested an American woman
as an alleged CIA agent and three
other foreigners and six Iranians in
connection with a recent wave of
bombings in Tehran, newspapers in the
Iranian capital reported yesterday.
The young Moslem militants holding
the U.S. Embassy said, meanwhile,
they had completed the scattering of
their American hostages to a dozen
provincial cities in Iran.
The American woman in the re
ported espionage case was not iden
tified, nor were the nine other persons
said to have been arrested.
The Tehran newspaper Kayhan re
ported the woman was arrested Mon
day night, and it said Iran's militia-like
revolutionary guard, who apparently
carried out the arrest, contended they
had documents to prove she worked for
the Central Intelligence Agency.
In Washington, a State Department
spokesman said he was unaware of the
report and could not comment im
mediately.

against U.S. domination" and "de
monstrated the ugly reality which hides
behind the curtain of diplomatic im
munity."
It insisted that unlike the case of the
American hostages accused of spying
in Tehran, the London diplomats had
"no other duties but to represent their
country" and "were taken hostage by a
group of hired and deceived terrorists"
in the pay of Iraq.
In other developments, Iranian au
thorities arrested an American woman
as an alleged CIA agent and three
other foreigners and six Iranians in
connection with a recent wave of
bombings in Tehran, newspapers in the
Iranian capital reported yesterday.
The young Moslem militants holding
the U.S. Embassy said, meanwhile,
they had completed the scattering of
their American hostages to a dozen
provincial cities in Iran.
The American woman in the re
ported espionage case was not iden
tified, nor were the nine other persons
said to have been arrested.
The Tehran newspaper Kayhan re
ported the woman was arrested Mon
day night, and it said Iran's militia-like
revolutionary guard, who apparently
carried out the arrest, contended they
had documents to prove she worked for
the Central Intelligence Agency.
In Washington, a State Department
spokesman said he was unaware of the
report and could not comment im
mediately.
From the Daily wire sen ices
The bodies of the U.S. commandos
killed in an Iranian desert 1 2 days ago
in the aborted attempt to free U.S. hos
tages returned to home soil yesterday
aboard a U.S. Air Force C-141.
Preparations to receive and identify
the charred remains had been made at
Dover Air Force Base, which IK
months ago identified and enbalmed
more than 900 bodies of another
tragedy — the Peoples Temple mass
murder-suicide in the Guyanese
jungle.
The servicemen's bodies arrived at
3:37 p.m. PDT. A 20-man color guard
was on hand to salute the arrival of the
bodies, and chaplains were present for
a brief ceremony, said Lt. Basil Gray,
base spokesman.
Reporters were not allowed on the
base at the time of arrival, but Gray
said plans called for two six-man teams
of pallbearers, one Marine and one Air
Force, to load the bodies onto four
hearses for transport to the mortuary.
"Mortuary officers will make identifi
cations' and final funeral arrange
ments," said Maj. Robert Groom.
The bodies began their journey yes
terday in Tehran, where nine coffins
were loaded aboard a regular Swissair
flight to Zurich, Switzerland, accom
panied by Roman Catholic Archbishop
Hilarion Capudji of the Melkite East
ern Rite of the Church.
U.S. officials have said eight men
died in the Iran mission. But the Ira
nians have variously said nine or 10
bodies were recovered after a helicop
ter and transport plane collided in a
ball of flame.
Capudji said some coffins contained
only hone fragments or charred body
parts. He said that to his knowledge
only three bodies could be identified —
the rest were beyond identification.
After the bodies arrived in Zurich,
they were formally transferred to U.S.
custody in a document-signing cere
mony in an airport hangar. Custody
went from Capudji to officials of the
International Red Cross and the Swiss
government to U.S. Ambassador
Richard Vine.
In Tehran, Iranian authorities went
to great lengths yesterday to stress its i
view that the freeing of their diplomats
in London and the condition of the
American hostages held there are in no
way comparable.
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr
and Foreign Minister Sadegh
Ghotbzadeh claimed the heroism of
Britain's elite Special Air Service was a
"victory" for Iran and Islam.
Bani-Sadr, in a second message to

the British government, thanked Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, "for the
steadfast acts of the police of your
country ... in this affair of the unjust
hostage taking at the Iranian Embassy
in London ..."
A midday commentary on official
Tehran radio insisted the two cases in
volving diplomatic hostages were "as
different as the earth is from the sky,"
and last night Ghotbzadeh explained
why on television.
"If a foreigner came to Iran and took
over the American Embassy and asked
for the separation of California from
the United States that would not be
acceptable," he said. That was his way
of explaining why Iran ruled out the
London terrorists' demands concern
ing the oil-producing province of
Khuzestan which has a large Arab
minority.
Stressing the "irrelevant compari
son" between the two cases, the radio
commentary reiterated the now famil
iar theme that the seizure of the
American Embassy here represented
"the will of the oppressed nation
against U.S. domination" and "de
monstrated the ugly reality which hides
behind the curtain of diplomatic im
munity."
