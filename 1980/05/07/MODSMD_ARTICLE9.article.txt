## Britain's elite military unit SAS demonstrates ability 
### William Tuohy 
The Los Angeles Times
LONDON — Their emblem is
a winged dagger with the motto:
"Who dares wins." Their spe
cialty is violence and their
watchword is secrecy.
They are the men of the 22nd
Special Air Service Regiment,
the SAS. Britain's most elite
military unit, and perhaps the
best special-missions force in the
world.
In storming the Iranian Em
bassy in London Monday, killing
four terrorists and rescuing 19
hostages, the SAS detachment
demonstrated its discipline, re
sourcefulness, skill and. as the
motto suggests, daring.
Organized in World War II as
a behind-the-linessabotage unit,
the SAS more recently has
shifted to intelligence work in
Northern Ireland, and anti
terrorist specialties to counter
skyjackers or the sort of siege
that developed at the Iranian
Embassy.
The SAS operates at home
and abroad as a kind of cross be
tween the U.S. Special Forces
and a CIA clandestine hit team.
Since the SAS is deeply in
volved in intelligence and covert
activities, their very existence is
shrouded in secrecy. They do not
appear at press conferences to
publicize their successes.
But the SAS record of success
far overshadows their few fai
lures. The\ acted as advisers in
Holland when South Moluccan
terrorists seized a train and in
Somalia when the West Ger
mans retook a hijacked Lufth
ansa airliner. Before that, an
SAS team parachuted to re
ndezvous with the liner Oueen
Elizabeth II in mid-Atlantic
after a warning that it would he
blown up unless a ransom was
paid.
In the past 10 years, the SAS
.has been in action in various
parts of the world, often incog
nito. and its officers and men
have been killed in action, and
quietly awarded decorations tor

valor in combat.
Most recently, the SAS has
been employed in Northern Ire
land. particularly in the area of
South Armagh. Here four-man
patrols stake out border cros
sings for da\s on end, waiting to
ambush gunmen of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army crossing
from the Republic of Ireland.
The SAS is a volunteer force.
Many of its members come from
crack guards and paratroop re
giments. Volunteers are given a
rigorous medical examination
and must pass a four-week selec
tion course.
The officers' course lasts five
weeks rather than four. The
basic idea is that an SAS man
must operate under his own
self-discipline in just about any
kind of adverse physical and
psychological circumstances.
Onlv one volunteer in five is
selected for further training,
which consists of a 14-week
period at the Hereford base.
There are seven weeks of general
training, three weeks of combat
snr\ i\ aland four of parachuting.
Neither officers nor men wear
anv rank. They wear
sand-colored berets with the
SAS emblem, a sweater and
blue uniform belt. On many as
signments they wear civilian clo
thing.
Though the army does not list
the strength of the SAS. it is be
lief ed to number between 700
and 1000 soldiers. The regiment
is divided into squadrons, each
with six officers and 72 men.
Each squadron is divided into
five troops — amphibious, air,
surveillance, mountain and
communications — with an of
ficer and 15 men.
Depending on the mission, the
SAS often operates in four-man
units, each with his specialty —
demolitions, medical, communi
cations. languages — though
many troopers have several
skills.
In the assault on the Iranian
Embassy, viewers on television
could see the tour-man team

operating as a unit, bursting in
the front balcony windows after
tossing in concussion grenades.
The SAS is equipped with the
latest weaponry, much of which
is still classified. They are all
trained extensively in the use of
all hand weapons.
Sometimes the SAS are de
ployed and not needed. This is
said to have been the case in
1975. when IRA gunmen hold
ing hostages in London, in
formed that the SAS had arriv ed
and were about ready to move in,
surrendered.
To train for counter-terrorist
activities, the SAS reportedly
has a firing range at Hereford
which can be used as a mock-up
of a floor plan or airliner involv
ing hostages.
The SAS men practice storin
ing in and shooting the terrorists
without hitting the hostages,
while instructors observe friirtf a
bulletproof plate glass ceiling.
The latest SAS technique is to
stun or blind terrorists with con
cussion and flash grenades, then
to quickly enter a room, separate
the terrorists from the hostages,
and kill the terrorists if neces
sary. The troopers are equipped
with anti-burn hoods which have
gas masks and radios.
This is basically the technique
used to release the hostages at
the Iranian Embassy in London
on Mondav.

have been killed in action, and
quietly awarded decorations tor

valor in combat.
Most recently, the SAS has
been employed in Northern Ire
land. particularly in the area of
South Armagh. Here four-man
patrols stake out border cros
sings for da\s on end, waiting to
ambush gunmen of the outlawed
Irish Republican Army crossing
from the Republic of Ireland.
The SAS is a volunteer force.
Many of its members come from
crack guards and paratroop re
giments. Volunteers are given a
rigorous medical examination
and must pass a four-week selec
tion course.
The officers' course lasts five
weeks rather than four. The
basic idea is that an SAS man
must operate under his own
self-discipline in just about any
kind of adverse physical and
psychological circumstances.
Onlv one volunteer in five is
selected for further training,
which consists of a 14-week
period at the Hereford base.
There are seven weeks of general
training, three weeks of combat
snr\ i\ aland four of parachuting.
Neither officers nor men wear
anv rank. They wear
sand-colored berets with the
SAS emblem, a sweater and
blue uniform belt. On many as
signments they wear civilian clo
thing.
Though the army does not list
the strength of the SAS. it is be
lief ed to number between 700
and 1000 soldiers. The regiment
is divided into squadrons, each
with six officers and 72 men.
Each squadron is divided into
five troops — amphibious, air,
surveillance, mountain and
communications — with an of
ficer and 15 men.
Depending on the mission, the
SAS often operates in four-man
units, each with his specialty —
demolitions, medical, communi
cations. languages — though
many troopers have several
skills.
In the assault on the Iranian
Embassy, viewers on television
could see the tour-man team

operating as a unit, bursting in
the front balcony windows after
tossing in concussion grenades.
The SAS is equipped with the
latest weaponry, much of which
is still classified. They are all
trained extensively in the use of
all hand weapons.
Sometimes the SAS are de
ployed and not needed. This is
said to have been the case in
1975. when IRA gunmen hold
ing hostages in London, in
formed that the SAS had arriv ed
and were about ready to move in,
surrendered.
To train for counter-terrorist
activities, the SAS reportedly
has a firing range at Hereford
which can be used as a mock-up
of a floor plan or airliner involv
ing hostages.
The SAS men practice storin
ing in and shooting the terrorists
without hitting the hostages,
while instructors observe friirtf a
bulletproof plate glass ceiling.
The latest SAS technique is to
stun or blind terrorists with con
cussion and flash grenades, then
to quickly enter a room, separate
the terrorists from the hostages,
and kill the terrorists if neces
sary. The troopers are equipped
with anti-burn hoods which have
gas masks and radios.
This is basically the technique
used to release the hostages at
the Iranian Embassy in London
on Mondav.

LONDON — Their emblem is
a winged dagger with the motto:
"Who dares wins." Their spe
cialty is violence and their
watchword is secrecy.
They are the men of the 22nd
Special Air Service Regiment,
the SAS. Britain's most elite
military unit, and perhaps the
best special-missions force in the
world.
In storming the Iranian Em
bassy in London Monday, killing
four terrorists and rescuing 19
hostages, the SAS detachment
demonstrated its discipline, re
sourcefulness, skill and. as the
motto suggests, daring.
Organized in World War II as
a behind-the-linessabotage unit,
the SAS more recently has
shifted to intelligence work in
Northern Ireland, and anti
terrorist specialties to counter
skyjackers or the sort of siege
that developed at the Iranian
Embassy.
The SAS operates at home
and abroad as a kind of cross be
tween the U.S. Special Forces
and a CIA clandestine hit team.
Since the SAS is deeply in
volved in intelligence and covert
activities, their very existence is
shrouded in secrecy. They do not
appear at press conferences to
publicize their successes.
But the SAS record of success
far overshadows their few fai
lures. The\ acted as advisers in
Holland when South Moluccan
terrorists seized a train and in
Somalia when the West Ger
mans retook a hijacked Lufth
ansa airliner. Before that, an
SAS team parachuted to re
ndezvous with the liner Oueen
Elizabeth II in mid-Atlantic
after a warning that it would he
blown up unless a ransom was
paid.
