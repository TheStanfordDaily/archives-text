# Kennedy's nephew blasts Carter
## 
### John Mason Staff Writer 
Robert Kennedy. Jr., campaigning in
California for his uncle. Sen. Edward
Kennedy, spoke yesterday about the
failures of the Carter administration,
especially with respect to the worsen
ing economic situation in America.
"This is the first time in the history of
this nation," said Kennedy, "that the
American people have been con
fronted with a problem and have
thrown their hands up in the air and
said there's nothing we can do about it.
"But I think there is something we
can do about it," said the son of the late
Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, in a speech to
about 300 people at De Anza Com
munity College yesterday. "But we
need a man with conviction, commit
ment and a vision for this country — a
vision of greatness."
And Kennedy went on to make clear
that Jimmy Carter was not the man he
had in mind. In particular, Kennedy
lashed out at Carter's current economic
programs which he described as, "the
old Republican programs— the prog
rams that say that the only way you can
balance the budget is to do it on the
backs of the poor, the sick and the el
derly. that the only way to control infla
tion is to throw American working men

and women out of their jobs."
Kennedy, a current second-year law
student at the University of Virginia,
has been on the campaign trail for his
uncle since the night the latter made his
decision to run for the presidency. And
it was with some bitterness in his voice
that he spoke of the criticism which
Senator Kennedy has received during
the course of the campaign.
"One of the reasons 1 voted for Pres
ident (Jimmy) Carter in 1976," he said,
"was because he said he would have an
open foreign policy. . . . But as soon as
Senator Kennedy goes out and tries to
debate and discuss that foreign policy,
President Carter sends Fritz Mondale
out of the White House to the state of
lowa to call Senator Kennedy a traitor
and to question his patriotism. And I
don't think that Senator Kennedy, who
has lost three brothers in the service of
this nation, and who has given half his
lifetime to his country . . . needs a les
son on patriotism from Fritz Mon
dale."
Kennedy went on to accuse Carter of
going back on promises not to deregu
late oil, not to allow the country to slide
into recession and not to delay the pas
sage of the Kennedy-Corman national
health plan. He also reminded the au
dience of Carter's 1976 membership in

an all-white Georgia church.
In addition, Kennedy took the op
portunity to discuss a recent ac
complishment of another member of
his family and to criticize the major oil
companies." My older brother Joe," he
said,"didn't believe the stories that the
oil companies put out about how they
couldn't make a profit, so now he's sel
ling home heating oil on the streets of
Boston for 47 cents a gallon and he's
making a profit. And the oil companies
say they can't make it for 99 cents. I say
it's time they get out of the business."
