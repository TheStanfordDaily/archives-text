# Swedes strike en masse
## 
### Harry Trimborn The Los Angeles Times 
NYNASHAMN. Sweden —
Rolf Jonasson passes the time
working in the garden behind his
neat four-room brick house on
the outskirts of this coastal
community 35 miles south of
Stockholm.
Or chatting with the other men
in the neighborhood. Like him.
they ha\e time to putter in the
garden, do fix-up chores around
the house or tinker with the small
pleasure boats many of them
keep down at the port where the
big ships provide ferry ser\ ice to
Roland and Finland.
Jonasson and many of his
neighbors are among the 300
workers at the Nvnan Petroleum
Co. refinery here who are out on
strike.
They are part of a vast army of
nearly a million men and women
— about one out of every four of
Sweden's workers — who have
been idled since last Thursday by
a massive strike-lockout that has
affected virtually every segment
of the national economy. It is the
worst labor dispute in the mod
ern history of Sweden, which has
been considered a model of
labor-management harmony.
Both sides met with govern
ment mediators Monday, which
would have been the first normal
workday after a long"weekend
that began with the May Day
holiday. r
Walk-out
At midnight Thursday, more
than 100,000 private-sector
workers walked off their jobs
after management refused to
agree to an 11.2 percent wage
increase. The Swedish
Employers' Association, which
represents 95 percent of the
country's privately-operated
businesses and manufacturing
enterprises, retaliated by locking
out about 750,000 additional
workers for a week, then extend
ing it three days.
This week the employers an
nounced another extension of
the lockout, this time for one
week.
More unions, including those
with employees at child day-care

centers, announced they would
join in the strike lockout.
Gasoline truck drivers have
announced that they will join if
there is no settlement by today.
Gas run
The announcement triggered
a rush to buy gasoline over the
weekend, with motorists topping
off their tanks and filling spare
containers.
There were reports of spot
consumer shortages in various
parts of the country , especially of
perishable items. Many house
holds reportedly were stocking
up on supplies in preparation for
a long siege. There were re
ported shortages of coffee,
sugar, salt, and bakery and dairy
goods.
The private-sector strike
_lockout compounded the disrup
tions caused by an earlier strike
of about 14.000 public
employees, with an additional
12,000 idled by a lockout by pub
lic service agencies.
Serious dispute
"People are not really yet
aware of how serious a big labor
dispute like this will be on the
country if it lasts a long time." a
retail clerk in Stockholm who
was still on the job said. "It's no
wonder. We haven't had any
thing like this in memory."
Jonasson, 41, who has worked
at the refinery for 16 years, had
never before been out on strike,
and he seemed ill-at-ease with
his enforced idleness, much as
the other striking workers in this
community.
He also appeared bewildered
by the uncertainties that it por
tends for his family, which has
grown accustomed to the protec
tion of Sweden's extensive social
security sysffcm.
Pay raise
Jonasson wants to get as big a
pay raise as possible, but he
doesn't think it will matter much
if his union wins the 11.2 percent
pay hike or finally accepts the 2.3
percent increase recommended
by a three-man arbitration
commission.
"It will just be a vicious cir
cle," Jonasson said. "If we get

more money prices will go up.
and the gains we make will be
eaten up bv higher prices and
taxes."
Jonasson said he would much
rather be at work, and hopes the
strike will be over quickly.
•"But I'm a pessimist," he said.
"1 think it will be a long strike,
and it looks like the country is in
for a long series of labor trou
bles."
If the strike lockout should last
more than three months, Jonas
son and the tens of thousands of
other workers on strike or locked
out. are in deep trouble.
The workers receive about
$25 a day in strike benefits for a
maximum of three months.
"What happens after that I don't
know," Jonasson said with a
frown.
