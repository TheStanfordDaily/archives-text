# Refugees caught in legal limbo
## Cubans overshadow Haitian exodus 
### Lee May The Los Angeles Times 
MIAMI — Jammed inside the
little white building, they clutch
newly issued documents, wait
quietly for help with food and
shelter, and exchange stories
about the 800-mile odyssey ac
ross treacherous seas that
brought them here.
"We were 11 days at sea. A lot
of people got sick. We ran out of
food and water. One man died,"
says Francisco Jean, a soft
voiced man. "I had to get out.
There was no life there, no
hope."
Francisco Jean is not a Cuban.
He is a Haitian, one of'the other
boat people" whose arrival here

'Its a simple issue as to whether they are
being persecuted in Haiti as to race or
politics. Clearly they are not. They are just
poor people coming here to work - just like
the Mexicans

by t he tens of thousands has been
largely overshadowed by the
more dramatic spectacle of the
exodus now under way from
Cuba, only 90 miles away.
Yet the Haitians, about
20.000 of whom have arrived in
the past decade, present the Un
ited States with political,
economic and social problems
that in some ways are even more
difficult than those posed by the
Cuban refugees.
The Cubans, while arriving in
numbers that threaten to over
whelm existing facilities, are fle
eing from a Comnfunist regime
that has long been a thorn in the
side of the United States. The
Haitian influx is far more con
troversial. Knotty questions
have been raised as to how the
Haitians should be classified and
dealt with under U.S. immigra
tion laws.
Political refugees?
To the Haitians themselves
and to their increasingly vocal
champions in the civil rights and
civil liberties movements within
the United States, they too are
political refugees, fleeing op
pression and near-starvation
under the rule of President-for
life Jean-Claude Duvalier.

Many of the Haitians arriving
on the Florida coast in small
boats tell of beatings and killings
at the hands of Duvalier's police
force, the Tonton Macoutes.
"The Tonton Macoutes go to
those holes in the ground, the
holes where the sewage goes,
and they stir the sewage with
sticks," one newcomer said re
cently. "Then they beat us with
the sticks. The pain, the stink,
you cannot imagine."
Others, including some fed
eral immigration officials, are
skeptical of such reports and
contend that the Haitians have
no real claim to political asylum.
They are simply individuals seek-

ing the brighter opportunities of
life in the United States, in this
view, and should not be allowed
to stay because they add to the
burdens of the already troubled
U.S. economy.
Persecution
"It's a simple issue as to
whether they are being perse
cuted in Haiti as to race or poli
tics," says one Immigration and
Naturalization Service official.
"Clearly they are not. They are
just poor people coming here to
work — just like the Mexicans."
Such arguments over refugees
and immigrants are older than
the American government itself,
of course. Group after group has
had to fight its way in, immigra
tion history suggests, only to tprn
and fight against the next group
trying to get in. Some of those
fights, such as the one over Irish
immigrants during the 19th cen
tury potato famine, have become
familiar chapters in U.S. history
books.
Now come the Haitians, enter
ing the United States legally or
illegally, fading into the black
and Spanish communities of
South Florida, searching for jobs
in cities and in joining migrant
labor camps up and down the

East Coast.
In recent weeks — partly be
cause of the dramatic Cuban
exodus — the conflict over what
to do about the Haitians has
heated up considerably and
spread from Florida to
Washington.
The official welcome given
Cuban refugees by President
Carter when their exodus first
began encouraged civil rights
groups to charge that Haitians
are discriminated against. De
monstrators in several cities have
marched to demand asylum for
the Haitians.
Meanwhile, the federal gov
ernment is struggling to sift
through the conflicts and create a
workable policy.
Landing in the middle of this
chaos are Francisco Jean and the
thousands like him who, during a
peak period in April, came at a
rate of more than 1000 a week.
To handle them, the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service
has worked out a makeshift re
fugee policy. Faced with a
court-ordered ban on deporta
tions while a legal test of the Hai
tians' status is pending, the ser

vice screens them and brings
them to the little white building
in a section of Miami fast becom
ing known as "Little Haiti."
The building houses the Dade
County Community Action
Agency. Inside, Jean and about
50 other new arrivals wait for
someone to call their names and
help them fill out forms for So
cial Security cards.
The Community Action
Agency is a coalition of public
and private organizations whose
staff members work almost
around the clock.
The government's use of the
agency as a kind of central pro
cessing point for Haitian re
fugees — a place providing them
donated food, clothing and shel
ter — is a marked change from
the days when Haitian boat
people were greeted by immigra
tion officials who quickly proces
sed them and found them inelig
ible for refugee status. Many of
these illegal aliens were jailed to
await deportation. Still, the Hai
tians and their sympathizers are
nagged by the uncertainties of
their status. They're not "legal"
refugees, but for now they aren't
being deported, either.

Naturalization Service official.
"Clearly they are not. They are
just poor people coming here to
work — just like the Mexicans."
Such arguments over refugees
and immigrants are older than
the American government itself,
of course. Group after group has
had to fight its way in, immigra
tion history suggests, only to tprn
and fight against the next group
trying to get in. Some of those
fights, such as the one over Irish
immigrants during the 19th cen
tury potato famine, have become
familiar chapters in U.S. history
books.
Now come the Haitians, enter
ing the United States legally or
illegally, fading into the black
and Spanish communities of
South Florida, searching for jobs
in cities and in joining migrant
labor camps up and down the

East Coast.
In recent weeks — partly be
cause of the dramatic Cuban
exodus — the conflict over what
to do about the Haitians has
heated up considerably and
spread from Florida to
Washington.
The official welcome given
Cuban refugees by President
Carter when their exodus first
began encouraged civil rights
groups to charge that Haitians
are discriminated against. De
monstrators in several cities have
marched to demand asylum for
the Haitians.
Meanwhile, the federal gov
ernment is struggling to sift
through the conflicts and create a
workable policy.
Landing in the middle of this
chaos are Francisco Jean and the
thousands like him who, during a
peak period in April, came at a
rate of more than 1000 a week.
To handle them, the Immigra
tion and Naturalization Service
has worked out a makeshift re
fugee policy. Faced with a
court-ordered ban on deporta
tions while a legal test of the Hai
tians' status is pending, the ser

vice screens them and brings
them to the little white building
in a section of Miami fast becom
ing known as "Little Haiti."
The building houses the Dade
County Community Action
Agency. Inside, Jean and about
50 other new arrivals wait for
someone to call their names and
help them fill out forms for So
cial Security cards.
The Community Action
Agency is a coalition of public
and private organizations whose
staff members work almost
around the clock.
The government's use of the
agency as a kind of central pro
cessing point for Haitian re
fugees — a place providing them
donated food, clothing and shel
ter — is a marked change from
the days when Haitian boat
people were greeted by immigra
tion officials who quickly proces
sed them and found them inelig
ible for refugee status. Many of
these illegal aliens were jailed to
await deportation. Still, the Hai
tians and their sympathizers are
nagged by the uncertainties of
their status. They're not "legal"
refugees, but for now they aren't
being deported, either.
MIAMI — Jammed inside the
little white building, they clutch
newly issued documents, wait
quietly for help with food and
shelter, and exchange stories
about the 800-mile odyssey ac
ross treacherous seas that
brought them here.
"We were 11 days at sea. A lot
of people got sick. We ran out of
food and water. One man died,"
says Francisco Jean, a soft
voiced man. "I had to get out.
There was no life there, no
hope."
Francisco Jean is not a Cuban.
He is a Haitian, one of'the other
boat people" whose arrival here

'Its a simple issue as to whether they are
being persecuted in Haiti as to race or
politics. Clearly they are not. They are just
poor people coming here to work - just like
the Mexicans

by t he tens of thousands has been
largely overshadowed by the
more dramatic spectacle of the
exodus now under way from
Cuba, only 90 miles away.
Yet the Haitians, about
20.000 of whom have arrived in
the past decade, present the Un
ited States with political,
economic and social problems
that in some ways are even more
difficult than those posed by the
Cuban refugees.
The Cubans, while arriving in
numbers that threaten to over
whelm existing facilities, are fle
eing from a Comnfunist regime
that has long been a thorn in the
side of the United States. The
Haitian influx is far more con
troversial. Knotty questions
have been raised as to how the
Haitians should be classified and
dealt with under U.S. immigra
tion laws.
Political refugees?
To the Haitians themselves
and to their increasingly vocal
champions in the civil rights and
civil liberties movements within
the United States, they too are
political refugees, fleeing op
pression and near-starvation
under the rule of President-for
life Jean-Claude Duvalier.

Many of the Haitians arriving
on the Florida coast in small
boats tell of beatings and killings
at the hands of Duvalier's police
force, the Tonton Macoutes.
"The Tonton Macoutes go to
those holes in the ground, the
holes where the sewage goes,
and they stir the sewage with
sticks," one newcomer said re
cently. "Then they beat us with
the sticks. The pain, the stink,
you cannot imagine."
Others, including some fed
eral immigration officials, are
skeptical of such reports and
contend that the Haitians have
no real claim to political asylum.
They are simply individuals seek-

ing the brighter opportunities of
life in the United States, in this
view, and should not be allowed
to stay because they add to the
burdens of the already troubled
U.S. economy.
Persecution
