# Greece drafts plan for Olympic 'state'
## 
### Kenneth Reich The Los Angeles Times 
ATHENS â€” The Greek gov
ernment has released a draft ag
reement foreseeing creation of
an Olympic "state" near the
Peloponnesus, site of the ancient
games, for the permanent stag
ing of the Olympics.
Officials said the state, near
Olympia, would be politically
neutral, militarily inviolable and
under the jurisdiction and man
agement of the International
Olympic Committee. Greece
would retain sovereign rights.
The lOC would be expected to
finance the building and mainte
nance of facilities, which would
revert to Greece at no cost
should the Olympics later be
withdrawn from the site.
Louis Guirandou-N'Diaye of
the Ivory Coast, a member of the
lOC executive board sent to
Greece by Lord Killanin, the In

ternational Olympic Committee
president, was quoted as saying
he found the Greek plans "per
fectly feasible."
Guirandou-N'Diaye heads a
committee that will report on the
prospects for permanently locat
ing the summer games in Greece
at next year's World Olympic
Congress in Baden-Baden, West
Germany. Killanin has said it is
unlikely that a permanent site in
Greece could become opera
tional until 1992.
Greek officials said the
committee was assured that it
could undertake the construc
tion of permanent facilities free
of tax burdens, with all Greek
public utilities at its disposal. As
long as the Olympics were staged
at the site, the lOC would be the
sole owner of all the facilities and
administer then as it saw fit.
Greece would provide security
around the site.
