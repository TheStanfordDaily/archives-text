# Israel losing friends over settlement issue
## 
### Dial Torgerson The Los Angeles Times 
JERUSALEM — Settlers waiting near
Tiberias began to load their belongings
onto trucks as soon as they were told, on a
July day in 1937, that Palestine's British
guardians had ruled that Jews could settle
on the east side of the Sea of Galilee.
Passing Arab villagers' herds of camels,
the caravan of trucks moved along the
sea's eastern shore to a rocky area with a
single tree, and there the settlers erected
thv wall and the watchtower that marked
Zionism's most distant outpost kibbutz,
Ein Gev.
Today Ein Gev is a part of Israel, a
thriving oasis of date palms, dairy land
and campgrounds. And beyond the old
frontier are newer kibbutzim that are now
Israel's most distant outposts. The world
knows them as simply "the settlements."
There are — depending on who keeps
count — 97 or 107 settlements — in Arab
territory taken by Israel in the Six-Day
War of 1967. Every time a new settlement
is established, its name is mentioned in
the chanceries of Europe, at the State
Department in Washington, in the press
virtually everywhere.
Meanwhile, the number of Israel's
friends abroad diminishes almost daily,
almost invariably because of the settle
ments and Prime Minister Menachem

Begin's heavy-handed zeal in carrying out
the settlements policy.
Most Israelis agree that their govern
ment has a right to build beyond the
"Green Line" that marked the pre-1967
frontier on United Nations maps. But Be
gin's policy is nonetheless the subject of
bitter debate among Israelis.
It is an emotional subject that touches
almost everyone.
The pioneering days live on in the tradi
tion that equates settlement with Zionism
— the movement for the return of the
Jews to Israel. Begin said recently, in an
Independence Day speech, that "settle
ment is the soul of Zionism."
Before Begin, Labor governments es
tablished 31 settlements on the West
Bank, most of them in a line along the
barren, lightly populated frontier with
Jordan. It was explained that this was
done for security reasons, and this was
generally accepted. The settlements had a
military look, they faced known enemies
and they were built on "state lands" with
little challenge from the landowners.
Since 1977, the Begin government has
built 35 settlements on the West Bank,
many in the midst of Arab-populated
areas, often on land claimed by Arab far
mers. Begin claimed the land "by historic
right."

Had Begin stuck to the Labor Party's
theory, he could have avoided the world's
criticism. But how valid is the security
theory? For every argument in its favor
there is one against it. For example:-
— The frontier settlers see everything
that goes on along the border, and the
settlements provide an early-warning ser
vice. But the Israeli army, which was
caught napping in 1973, now has one of
the world's most advanced surveillance
systems, with radar, listening posts and
photo reconnaissance planes.
— The settlers are armed, they know
every detail of the terrain in their area and
they can fight. But against tanks and ar
mored infantry they can't win. The army
evacuated the Golan Heights settlements
in 1973, some just ahead of the Syrian
attack. Can you imagine, the critics ask,
the burden on the army if it had to send
troops to evacuate 30 or 40 sites?
— Settlements make valuable ad
vanced bases, with water, lights, fences,
etc. But in 1973 several of the Golan
Heights settlements fell to the Syrians,
who used them as advance bases. An
army outpost could better protect itself.
— Settlements fight terrorism by halt
ing infiltrators close to the frontier. But
they also draw attacks. And the military
measures to protect them — roadblocks,
arrests, even the guns of the trigger-happy

settlers—fuel the contention that turns
young Arabs into stone throwers, then
activists, then terrorists.
When Begin returned from
Washington last month after conferring
with President Carter, he said:
"Our good friends there tell us that
they prefer to stress the security aspects of
settlements, because the large majority of
the American people will accept and un
derstand it. It is their right, of course, to
choose their most effective hasbara —
public relations, or propaganda — in
strument, while we for our part continue
to emphasize the synthesis of security and
historic rights."
In essence, he was saying: Let the
Americans call it what they may; we are
there because it is ours. He could have
said: It is ours because we are there. The
map of Israel was drawn in the turbulent
1940s around the dots representing
Jewish settlements; had Ein Gev not been
there, Syria might claim the spot today.
At a settlement, the Israeli flag has
roots. At an army base, it does not. Tacti
cally, a base may be easier to defend, but,
strategically, the settlement makes a
claim on the land forever. If Israel can
make the claim stick, it wins the right to
dig into the land itself — and to gain the
"strategic depth" that keeps enemies dis
tant from its heartland.

Israel's most distant outposts. The world
knows them as simply "the settlements."
There are — depending on who keeps
count — 97 or 107 settlements — in Arab
territory taken by Israel in the Six-Day
War of 1967. Every time a new settlement
is established, its name is mentioned in
the chanceries of Europe, at the State
Department in Washington, in the press
virtually everywhere.
Meanwhile, the number of Israel's
friends abroad diminishes almost daily,
almost invariably because of the settle
ments and Prime Minister Menachem

Begin's heavy-handed zeal in carrying out
the settlements policy.
Most Israelis agree that their govern
ment has a right to build beyond the
"Green Line" that marked the pre-1967
frontier on United Nations maps. But Be
gin's policy is nonetheless the subject of
bitter debate among Israelis.
It is an emotional subject that touches
almost everyone.
The pioneering days live on in the tradi
tion that equates settlement with Zionism
— the movement for the return of the
Jews to Israel. Begin said recently, in an
Independence Day speech, that "settle
ment is the soul of Zionism."
Before Begin, Labor governments es
tablished 31 settlements on the West
Bank, most of them in a line along the
barren, lightly populated frontier with
Jordan. It was explained that this was
done for security reasons, and this was
generally accepted. The settlements had a
military look, they faced known enemies
and they were built on "state lands" with
little challenge from the landowners.
Since 1977, the Begin government has
built 35 settlements on the West Bank,
many in the midst of Arab-populated
areas, often on land claimed by Arab far
mers. Begin claimed the land "by historic
right."

Had Begin stuck to the Labor Party's
theory, he could have avoided the world's
criticism. But how valid is the security
theory? For every argument in its favor
there is one against it. For example:-
— The frontier settlers see everything
that goes on along the border, and the
settlements provide an early-warning ser
vice. But the Israeli army, which was
caught napping in 1973, now has one of
the world's most advanced surveillance
systems, with radar, listening posts and
photo reconnaissance planes.
— The settlers are armed, they know
every detail of the terrain in their area and
they can fight. But against tanks and ar
mored infantry they can't win. The army
evacuated the Golan Heights settlements
in 1973, some just ahead of the Syrian
attack. Can you imagine, the critics ask,
the burden on the army if it had to send
troops to evacuate 30 or 40 sites?
— Settlements make valuable ad
vanced bases, with water, lights, fences,
etc. But in 1973 several of the Golan
Heights settlements fell to the Syrians,
who used them as advance bases. An
army outpost could better protect itself.
— Settlements fight terrorism by halt
ing infiltrators close to the frontier. But
they also draw attacks. And the military
measures to protect them — roadblocks,
arrests, even the guns of the trigger-happy

settlers—fuel the contention that turns
young Arabs into stone throwers, then
activists, then terrorists.
When Begin returned from
Washington last month after conferring
with President Carter, he said:
"Our good friends there tell us that
they prefer to stress the security aspects of
settlements, because the large majority of
the American people will accept and un
derstand it. It is their right, of course, to
choose their most effective hasbara —
public relations, or propaganda — in
strument, while we for our part continue
to emphasize the synthesis of security and
historic rights."
In essence, he was saying: Let the
Americans call it what they may; we are
there because it is ours. He could have
said: It is ours because we are there. The
map of Israel was drawn in the turbulent
1940s around the dots representing
Jewish settlements; had Ein Gev not been
there, Syria might claim the spot today.
At a settlement, the Israeli flag has
roots. At an army base, it does not. Tacti
cally, a base may be easier to defend, but,
strategically, the settlement makes a
claim on the land forever. If Israel can
make the claim stick, it wins the right to
dig into the land itself — and to gain the
"strategic depth" that keeps enemies dis
tant from its heartland.
JERUSALEM — Settlers waiting near
Tiberias began to load their belongings
onto trucks as soon as they were told, on a
July day in 1937, that Palestine's British
guardians had ruled that Jews could settle
on the east side of the Sea of Galilee.
Passing Arab villagers' herds of camels,
the caravan of trucks moved along the
sea's eastern shore to a rocky area with a
single tree, and there the settlers erected
thv wall and the watchtower that marked
Zionism's most distant outpost kibbutz,
Ein Gev.
Today Ein Gev is a part of Israel, a
thriving oasis of date palms, dairy land
and campgrounds. And beyond the old
frontier are newer kibbutzim that are now
Israel's most distant outposts. The world
knows them as simply "the settlements."
