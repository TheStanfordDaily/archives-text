# Los Gatos firm tries new product
## State markets cigarette substitute 
### Nancy Yoshihara The Los Angeles Times 
It's been nine years since Americans last
saw cigarette commercials on television, but
one will begin appearing this month — at
least in California.
Free, a new product designed to look,
smoke and smell like a cigarette, goes on the
air, breaking the federal ban on radio and
television advertising of cigarettes. It can do
so without penalty because it is simply not a
cigarette as defined by the Food and Drug
Administration.
Lee Danna, chairman of privately held In
ternational Brands of l.os Gatos, says Free
does not contain any tobacco — a necessary
ingredient of a "cigarette." Instead, Free is
made from basically natural derivatives of
wheat, cocoa and citrus plants.
188 brands of smokes
With IXN brands of cigarettes currently on
the market, per capita consumption flat and

tobacco makers waging a fierce war for the
low-tar smokers, it is no easy task to crack
the $ 1 2 billion market.
Free is not the first attempt to introduce a
non-tobacco cigarette to Americans. About
12 years ago, according to Danna, two
brands of lettuce-based cigarettes called
Bravo and Triumph appeared for a short
time.
"But they were developed by non
cigarette people," says Danna, who has held
senior executive and sales positions with
three tobacco firms, Whitehall Products Inc.,
the House of Edgeworth and R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco.
75 cents a pack
Free has a suggested retail price of 75 cents
a pack — a dime or so more than regular or
low-tar cigarettes. Development work on the
project began in New Jersey six years ago.
The cigarette was test-marketed but was
withdrawn to improve aroma and reduce tar

content. To date, International Brands has
invested "a lot more than $4 million" in re
search and development and hopes to recoup
those costs in six to nine months.
Free was formally introduced lust January
in Northern California, where it is now sold
'vn 800 supermarkets and independent stores.
"By tobacco industry standards, 0.5 percent
is a successful market introduction. Already
in Northern California, we've done better
than 0.7 percent with only 1 6 percent of the
market."
Free is taking an educational — almost clin
ical — approach. At a recent press confer
ence, Dr. Donald Harrison, chief of cardiol
ogy at Stanford's School of Medicine, was on
hand to warn of the dangers of cigarette
nicotine. International Brands President
Samuel McFarlane says a study indicated
that non-tobacco smokers are as much as 40
percent less likely to develop smoking
related types of cancer.
