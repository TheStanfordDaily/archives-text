# McPherson recovers from auto accident; prepares for deanship
## 
### Pamela Johnson Staff Writer 
Business may deviate from the
usual when Rene McPherson be
comes dean of the Graduate
School of Business in July.
McPherson, who was seriously
injured in a car accident last De
cember, spent three months re
covering from multiple fractures
and major internal injuries.
Now, he's out of the hospital and
preparing for the move here.
Chairman and chief executive
officer at the Dana Corporation
in Toledo, Ohio, McPherson
spent 27 years in that company
where his leadership has been
described as energetic and in
novative. â€¢
During his time at Dana, he
established a "promote from
within" policy. Dispensing with
time clocks, encouraging
employees to become sharehol
ders and putting many wage
workers on salary, McPherson
worked toward decentralization
of control, said Stephen Ram
ming, director of press relations
at Dana.
McPherson is now sailing to
Florida and could not be reached
for comment.
"His goal was to protect and
increase the shareholders in
vestments. Dana's goal was to
satisfy the shareholders; at Stan
ford it'll be the students," said
Ramming.
"He's big on movement . . .
but, he won't fix something that
isn't broken," said Ramming re
ferring to McPherson's ideas for
change.
Associate Dean of Academic
Affairs at the Business School
James Van Home agreed with
Ramming.
"He'll spend a good deal of
time with faculty and students
and decide a course of action
from that," Van Home said.
"It's like a ship; you can change
over time but it doesn't make a
ISO-degree turn. McPherson a
very good listener, decisive.
He'll get a good understanding

before making any changes."
One change that will take
place is that of perspective.
"With new blood, new things
will be stimulated," said Robert
Jaedicke, interim dean of the
Business School. "McPherson
hasa unique approach. He'svery
people-oriented and interacts
easily in an organizational set
ting. He's a team-type player.
Charles Horngren, a professor
at the Business School, said he
was impressed by McPherson's
"great enthusiasm" and "per
sonal warmth."
McPherson has the "ability to
get an organization working to
ward the same objectives
through innovation . . . and, the

degree to which you are able to
achieve this determines how suc
cessful you will be. Rene has cer
tainly demonstrated that at
Dana," Horngren said.
Jaedicke served this year in
the interim between Arjay Mil
ler's exit and McPherson's entr
ance. Miller resigned because he
said the job was becoming too
comfortable. Three of the Busi
ness School's deans were either
retiring or going back to teaching
and he said he wanted the school
to rebuild itself from the top
down.
Next year, Jaedicke will share
the position of associate dean of
academic affairs with James Van
Home, a position he held prior
to the present one.
