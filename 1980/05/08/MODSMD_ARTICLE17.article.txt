The Los Angeles Times
SACRAMENTO — Hie lives
of 22 children who died in the
People's Temple mass murder
suicide in Guyana might have
been saved if the state of
California had acted on child
abuse reports it had months be
fore the tragedy, a state attorney
general's report concluded this
week.
But the office of state Attor
ney General George Deukme
jian said its year-long probe into
the matter had established no
evidence of criminal responsibil
ity on the part of California De
partment of Social Services offi
cials for the deaths of the chil
dren at Jonestown, Guyana, in

November 1 978.
Deukmejian's report said the
Department of Social Services
failed to follow up on its own
initial investigation of allega
tions of child abuse within the
cult of followers of the Rev . Jim
Jones. Most of those who went to
Jonestown had lived previously
in California.
The children might have been
saved, the report said, if the state
had warned the judges who
awarded their guardianship to
Peoples Temple members.
Deukmejian's report said the
failure was due. at least in part,
to bureaucratic confusion and
buck-passing resulting from a
departmental reorganization

and in part to the fact that some
key officials reportedly told col
leagues that Jones had political
influence in Sacramento.
The report ignited a round of
finger-pointing, and denials.
Social Services Director Mar
ion Woods vehemently denied
the suggestion of political inflii
ence, telling reporters in a hastilv
called news conference that "thfc
basis tor the attorney
investigation coming to his con
clusion is total hearsay."
Woods' department is respon
sible for regulating group home!,
nurseries, pre-schools. foster
homes and other facilities hxr
children who do not live with
their parents.
