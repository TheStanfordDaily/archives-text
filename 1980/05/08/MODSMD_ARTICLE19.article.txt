## 'Death joke' most objectionable 
### 
This Wednesday morning, the controversy
over the Hammer and Coffin Society hoax
shows no sign of abating. As a person who is
involved personally with the Daily, yet not to
the extent that some Daily staff members
are. and as a person who has convinced him
self in the last couple of days to remember
that Hammer and Coffin initiates are.
perhaps contrary to popular opinion, people
with the capacity for remorse and apology. 1
feel led to offer an attempt at objecti\ ity and
honesty.
I think most members of the Stanford
community probably feel that the most ob
jectionable aspect of Friday's hoax was the
subject matter. It would not have mattered if
the caption had been abundantly absurd to
make sure that an imbecile would discount it.
In these troubled times, when death by
mishap or whim occurs all too often, we sim
ply cannot tolerate jokes about air tragedies
involv ing deaths of close friends. After all. it
was only a year ago that the United Airlines
cru*>h near Chicago was shocking and painful
news.
What if the hoax had somehow been ac
complished with the original caption. "They
pulled it off! Bowling team wins National
title"? 1 think it is safe to say that many of the
people who expressed furv over the hoax
would have cared very little.
What would the official reaction of the
Daily have been? Of course no one can know
for sure.
But Editor Bill Burger does say that "The
Daily intends to make it clear to the com

munity that it is not fair game for its humor
ous. or political purposes." Thus it seems
that even had the hoax been completely
humorous and even entertaining to a large
number of students in general, it would still
have been thoroughly unacceptable from the
Daily's point of view.
An obvious comparison must be drawn
beween the recent hoax and the front page of
the Daily issue of April 1. On that day, the
paper was fair game for humorous purposes.
The lead story reported that the shah of Iran
was to become a Hoover fellow, and other
stories dealt with alleged spying activities on
students by the FBI and CIA. and the plans
for renovating Storey House.
What would have been the difference if the
Hammer and Coffin hoax had been
genuinely humorous and not offensively
morbid? For one. the Daily itself perpetrated
the April Fool's Day issue; the Hammer and
Coffin hoax came from outside the Daily. Is
this significant? Is it not true that in both
cases the Daily's normally professional style
was violated temporarily, and that the main
difference is that the paper's staff controlled
one violation, and had their control under
mined in the other?
I think it was great that the Daily would
take itself lightly enough to publish a fictiti
ous April Fool's Day front page. And I think
that the Daily must acknowledge that having
carried off such a "hoax" on its own. it should
not be too surprised when other organiza
tions use the Daily for similar purposes, and
should not be too offended merely because
the Daily did not sanction the hoax.

The problem is that all of us, I expect, who
are involved at the Daily, take pride in the
paper. For us. the Hammer and Coffin hoax
was a personal slap in the face.
But we do not represent the general senti
ment of the community. 1 have talked to
several people today who felt that if the sub
ject matter of the bowling team's hoax had
been funny, they would have laughed. They
would not have felt outrage at the mere fact
that the Daily was used fraudulently. In fact,
I expect that students here might be even
more inclined to satirize the Daily if they
sense that the Daily tends to take itself too
seriously.
I believe that the Hammer and Coffin in
itiates are genuinely sorry about the inhu
manity and indecency of their attempt to
catch University attention. I furthermore ex
pect that the facts of their offensive hoax will
reflect badly only on the Hammer and Coffin
Society, and not on the Daily. The only or
ganization the initiates of the society
humiliated was their own.
For the offensive nature of their hoax, the
1 Jammer and Coffin Society has apologized.
For the fact that they used the Daily as an
avenue for their hoax. 1 don't think they will
apologize. But I don't think that the com
munity is bothered by this.
Thus the Daily will serve its community
best by reflecting the prevailing emotions of
that community, and simply letting the un
pleasant memory of this unfortunate incident
bear the task of making sure that such an
incident does not happen again.

honesty.
I think most members of the Stanford
community probably feel that the most ob
jectionable aspect of Friday's hoax was the
subject matter. It would not have mattered if
the caption had been abundantly absurd to
make sure that an imbecile would discount it.
In these troubled times, when death by
mishap or whim occurs all too often, we sim
ply cannot tolerate jokes about air tragedies
involv ing deaths of close friends. After all. it
was only a year ago that the United Airlines
cru*>h near Chicago was shocking and painful
news.
What if the hoax had somehow been ac
complished with the original caption. "They
pulled it off! Bowling team wins National
title"? 1 think it is safe to say that many of the
people who expressed furv over the hoax
would have cared very little.
What would the official reaction of the
Daily have been? Of course no one can know
for sure.
But Editor Bill Burger does say that "The
Daily intends to make it clear to the com

munity that it is not fair game for its humor
ous. or political purposes." Thus it seems
that even had the hoax been completely
humorous and even entertaining to a large
number of students in general, it would still
have been thoroughly unacceptable from the
Daily's point of view.
An obvious comparison must be drawn
beween the recent hoax and the front page of
the Daily issue of April 1. On that day, the
paper was fair game for humorous purposes.
The lead story reported that the shah of Iran
was to become a Hoover fellow, and other
stories dealt with alleged spying activities on
students by the FBI and CIA. and the plans
for renovating Storey House.
What would have been the difference if the
Hammer and Coffin hoax had been
genuinely humorous and not offensively
morbid? For one. the Daily itself perpetrated
the April Fool's Day issue; the Hammer and
Coffin hoax came from outside the Daily. Is
this significant? Is it not true that in both
cases the Daily's normally professional style
was violated temporarily, and that the main
difference is that the paper's staff controlled
one violation, and had their control under
mined in the other?
I think it was great that the Daily would
take itself lightly enough to publish a fictiti
ous April Fool's Day front page. And I think
that the Daily must acknowledge that having
carried off such a "hoax" on its own. it should
not be too surprised when other organiza
tions use the Daily for similar purposes, and
should not be too offended merely because
the Daily did not sanction the hoax.

The problem is that all of us, I expect, who
are involved at the Daily, take pride in the
paper. For us. the Hammer and Coffin hoax
was a personal slap in the face.
But we do not represent the general senti
ment of the community. 1 have talked to
several people today who felt that if the sub
ject matter of the bowling team's hoax had
been funny, they would have laughed. They
would not have felt outrage at the mere fact
that the Daily was used fraudulently. In fact,
I expect that students here might be even
more inclined to satirize the Daily if they
sense that the Daily tends to take itself too
seriously.
I believe that the Hammer and Coffin in
itiates are genuinely sorry about the inhu
manity and indecency of their attempt to
catch University attention. I furthermore ex
pect that the facts of their offensive hoax will
reflect badly only on the Hammer and Coffin
Society, and not on the Daily. The only or
ganization the initiates of the society
humiliated was their own.
For the offensive nature of their hoax, the
1 Jammer and Coffin Society has apologized.
For the fact that they used the Daily as an
avenue for their hoax. 1 don't think they will
apologize. But I don't think that the com
munity is bothered by this.
Thus the Daily will serve its community
best by reflecting the prevailing emotions of
that community, and simply letting the un
pleasant memory of this unfortunate incident
bear the task of making sure that such an
incident does not happen again.

This Wednesday morning, the controversy
over the Hammer and Coffin Society hoax
shows no sign of abating. As a person who is
involved personally with the Daily, yet not to
the extent that some Daily staff members
are. and as a person who has convinced him
self in the last couple of days to remember
that Hammer and Coffin initiates are.
perhaps contrary to popular opinion, people
with the capacity for remorse and apology. 1
