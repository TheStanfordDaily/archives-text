# Last senate meeting approves budget
## Geiger defends recruiting policy 
### Brad Crystal Staff Writer 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger last
night defended the University's recruit
ing policies, questioned the fairness of
block seating at football games and de
clared the need for a consensus of stu
dent, athlete and alumni opinion in re
solving the mascot issue.
Speaking at the last regular meeting
of the current ASSU Senate last night,
Geiger told the 1 1 senators present
that athletic ability is just one criterion
in the admissions process for recruits.
"I have seen no evidence that
athletes don't participate in the
academic life jof the University,"
Geiger said. ,
Although he said the admissions of
fice regards the high energy level
athletes contribute to the school as an
asset, he also said "it would be the be

ginning of the end if we were to exploit
bodies to win ball games."
In reference to the practice of stu
dents arriving early at football games to
reserve large blocks of seats for their
housemates, Geiger said, "It is very
unfair for some of the threatening
things that happen (in cordoning off
seats) to occur.
"You would be amazed at how many
statements (of complaint) we receive,"
he said.
Despite such complaints, Geigersaid
he did not think it was his duty to im
pose a rule restricting block seating.
"I'm not in the business of spoiling
fun," he said.
In terms of the quest for a University
team mascot, Geiger said the Tree and
the Robber Baron were unacceptable
to a large portion of alumni.
He said the Tree as a mascot would

be an easy target for slurs from oppos
ing teams. "We all know what Huskies
do to trees," he joked.
He also said the Griffon has not re
ceived a groundswell of support and
might be "too esoteric."
Geiger said he supportvthe construc
tion of new campus tennis courts rather
than lighting the existing ones. He cited
high energy costs in rejecting the latter
option.
In other business, the senate passed
two resolutions that will affect the fu
ture of the recently-opened ASSU
operated Coffee House.
Although the Coffee will be
operated independently by a manager,
who has yet to be selected, in conjunc
tion with the board of directors, the
senate decided to retain ultimate au
thority over the composition of those
gtmips by issuing and buying 10 shares
of v <i!ee House, Inc. stock at Sl')
"I*l
. I .is, according to Council ol Presi
dents member Dick Buttei field: "II
something goes drastically wrong with
the management of the Coffee House,
the ASSU can vote out the board of
directors and institute a satisfactory
one."
Under this arrangement, Butterfield
said the Coffee House could ensure ac
quisition of a liquor license by appoint
ing a non-student majority to the board
of directors, yet still maintain student
control.
The senate also approved a $50,000
loan to the Coffee House at 22 percent
interest, to help the organization ab
sorb any unforeseen financial burdens
in the initial months of operation.
Also, a S3 increase in orientation
fees was passed, adding to the $2 each
entering freshman pays that is set aside
for activities during the student's senior
year.
Project managers for ASSU Sunday

Flicks. Ferrill Roll and ASSU Recycl
ing. Lisa Joycc, each will receive $200
bonuses as a result of a senate resolu
tr recognize what ASSU Financial
Manager Bruce Bendix termed "their
exceptional performance on the job."
Among the budget recommenda
tions of the Finance Committee okayed
by the senate was $400 to go to Stan
lord Against Conscription to help fund
a "forum on draft registration that pre
sents both sides of the issue."
Next year's budget was passed
unanimously with total costs estimated
at more than $120,000. Salaries, capi
tal improvements and miscellaneous
costs rose by a "standard percentage"
while supply costs went up sharply to
$7354, according to Bendix.
Beginning next year, because of
another senate decision, the ASSU will
bestow the Peter Bing Award yearly to
two faculty and/or staff members in
recognition of leadership, guidance
and moral support to students engaged
in extra-curricular activities.
Bing is chairman of the Stanford
Board of Trustees.
