# Last senate meeting approves budget
## Geiger defends recruiting policy 
### Brad Crystal Staff Writer 
Athletic Director Andy Geiger last
night defended the University's recruit
ing policies, questioned the fairness of
block seating at football games and de
clared the need for a consensus of stu
dent, athlete and alumni opinion in re
solving the mascot issue.
Speaking at the last regular meeting
of the current ASSU Senate last night,
Geiger told the 1 1 senators present
that athletic ability is just one criterion
in the admissions process for recruits.
"I have seen no evidence that
athletes don't participate in the
academic life jof the University,"
Geiger said. ,
Although he said the admissions of
fice regards the high energy level
athletes contribute to the school as an
asset, he also said "it would be the be

ginning of the end if we were to exploit
bodies to win ball games."
In reference to the practice of stu
dents arriving early at football games to
reserve large blocks of seats for their
housemates, Geiger said, "It is very
unfair for some of the threatening
things that happen (in cordoning off
seats) to occur.
"You would be amazed at how many
statements (of complaint) we receive,"
he said.
Despite such complaints, Geigersaid
he did not think it was his duty to im
pose a rule restricting block seating.
"I'm not in the business of spoiling
fun," he said.
In terms of the quest for a University
team mascot, Geiger said the Tree and
the Robber Baron were unacceptable
to a large portion of alumni.
He said the Tree as a mascot would

be an easy target for slurs from oppos
ing teams. "We all know what Huskies
do to trees," he joked.
He also said the Griffon has not re
ceived a groundswell of support and
might be "too esoteric."
Geiger said he supportvthe construc
tion of new campus tennis courts rather
than lighting the existing ones. He cited
high energy costs in rejecting the latter
option.
In other business, the senate passed
two resolutions that will affect the fu
ture of the recently-opened ASSU
operated Coffee House.
Although the Coffee will be
operated independently by a manager,
who has yet to be selected, in conjunc
tion with the board of directors, the
senate decided to retain ultimate au
thority over the composition of those
