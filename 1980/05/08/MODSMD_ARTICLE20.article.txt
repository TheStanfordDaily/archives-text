Editor insensitive
Editor Bill Burger writes that
we have a right to expect more
from this community's news
paper. and clearly he takes the
Daily as very serious business.
Unfortunately, the Daily too
often requires that its audience
await the following day's correc
tions for an accurate reading of
the previous day's issue. Even in
reporting the hoax story, one of
the initiates" names was mispel
led (sic) and his year cited incor
rectly. Errors in grammar and on
current events are common
enough.
Judging from the amused reac
tion of many who read about the
earlier proposed addendum ot
"none spared" to the caption. I
do not believe that the Stanford
community's general upset was
caused by the initiates' tamper
ing with the Daily; rather, it was
the thoughlessness of their joke,
which was admitted in the
apologies. The reaction of the
readers and the consequent re
primands will be the most effec
tive punishment for the
pranksters.
Finally, it is the implication of
Burger that these students
should be expelled, which to this
reader seems insensitive.
Perhaps it is only the second dose
of bad humor in one week. Or
perhaps he takes the Daily a bit
too seriously.

Incident an outrage
When I was at Stanford, the
Chaparral staff also engaged in
pranks. As I recall, they were
usually clever, only mildly offen
sive and an acceptable part of
undergraduate life.
But the howling team incident
is more than a prank. It is cruelty.
I can find no distinction between
the group that perpetrated this
outrage and the dingbats in the
Midwest who recently tortured
and burned a fraternity cat.
Jay Martcl's comments in the

press ("the magazine has never
been known for good taste" and
"it remains consistent with its
design") do not reflect any par
ticular intelligence. Further, they
suggest that he has only a min
imal understanding of the func
tion of humor and of the "de
sign" of the Chaparral.
As for those on the Chaparral
staff who are responsible for the
execution of this macabre hoax, I
am certain that the student gov
ernment will recognize what lit
tle credit they reflect on the Uni
versity and will take appropriate
action.

Daily not wronged
Like much of the Stanford
community. I didn't find Friday's
hoax particularly amusing. What
I do find comic, however, is the
self-righteous, vindictive stance
taken by Editor Bill Burger
against the perpetrators. Claim
ing to be motivated by the wrong
done to me, the naive and ever
trusting reader (How will I be
able to believe Tito is really
dead?), and to the Daily's repu
tation. I think he shows his own
naivete.
I. for one, didn't believe the
hoax for more than a few awful
seconds because 1 am aware that
this is a university, and that the
Daily is a university paper. I re
member quite well the amusing
April Fool's Day paper; I
Know the kinds of things the
Hammer and Coffin Society, and
other campus groups, pull off as
gi<g S '
But I of course sympathize
very greatly with those who were
upset by the story, and I think it
is they who were most grievously
wronged, not The Stanford Daily
or its credibility. For in fact, 1
have never seen so many people
scuffling for a Daily as on Mon
day morning, when everyone
was interested in the stories fol
lowing up the hoax.
And while I admire the seri

ousness with which Burger takes
the Daily, I can only think that he
has been motivated more by em
barrassment than by compassion
tor anyone. I can only recom
mend to him that he remember
where he is, and try to de
monstrate a few of the skills I
hope we pick up here â€” an abil
ity to put things in perspective,
an understanding of the intent
behind any crime as a mitigating
factor, a sense of fair punish
ment.

'Joke' sparks anger
I very rarely express my opin
ion but this incident sparked
such anger that I felt it necessary
to put it into writing. I was so
completely outraged at this mor
bid and sick "joke" by these, as
Howard Lynch called them, '"all
fun guys" it is beyond belief.
I would think that action of
this type deserves more than a
slap on the hand. Death is not a
thing dealt with in our society as
a "joke," especially en masse.
What is becoming of this univer
sity if humanity doesn't start at
home!

Forgive and forget
Although I do not condone the
attempt at humor perpetrated by
Hammer and Coffin's seven in
itiates. I must say that I am appal
led by Editor Bill Burger's un
compromising self
righteousness, demonstrated in
his remarks following the Ham
mer and Coffin's two apologies
printed in Tuesday's Daily.
Knowing three of the people
who participated in the hoax, I
am convinced that they had, as
they said, no intention of causing
grief to anyone. The apology did
not imply that the Stanford
community was not sophisti
cated enough to catch the
humor, but rather that the in
itiates themselves did not make

their humor obvious enough.
To my knowledge. Bill
Burger's reaction to the hoax has
been inordinately extreme and
immature. His expressed inten
tion to press for the maximum
penalty (expulsion) is com
pletely uncalled for. Perhaps the
Hammer and Coffin society
should have apologized to the
Daily, but it is clear now that
such an apology would only be
tossed aside and labeled as "in
credibly insensitive" or "insuffi
cient."
1 sincerely doubt that the Dai
ly's reputation will suffer as a re
sult of the Hammer and Coffin
Society's unfortunate prank.
Rather. Bill Burger's child-like
behavior and editorial overreac
tion have lowered my already in
different opinion of the Univer
sity newspaper.
The old saying, "forgive and
forget," applies to this situation,
despite the severity of the cir
cumstances. Bill Burger needs to
cool his temper in order to see
things more clearly. My opinion of
the Daily might improve if
Burger is responsible enough to
print this letter promptly.

No rehabilitation
In the 32 years that I've been
associated with Stanford, I've
never before believed that an act
by students merited expulsion
without possibility of returning.
Inflicting damage to property,
or even to people, can sometimes
reflect temporary emotional in
stability or immaturity, condi
tions that can be remedied.
Cheating and "flunking out" are
also often based on remedial
problems.
On the other hand, the "bowl
ing team hoax" (Daily, May 2)
stems from such a twisted and
truncated consciousness that one
cannot imagine a path to re
habilitation.
Perhaps some of those in
volved are merely weak and

childish; this will be determined
by the University's inquiry. As
for those who are truly responsi
ble, I think that a Stanford edu
cation is simply wasted on a per
son who lacks basic human feel
ings.
It also will be interesting to
find out whether the Daily and
other injured parties will be able
to recover compensation for the
grave harm done to them.
