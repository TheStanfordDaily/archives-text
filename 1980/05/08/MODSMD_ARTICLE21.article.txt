# Voting apathy tragic, stupid

"The ASSU Senate never does anything. COP?
They just hang out in Tresidder. Fee assessments?
What's a fee assessment?"
Sound familiar? Probably. If you yourself ha
ven't made similar remarks, I'll bet you've heard
such comments around election time. If vow ha
ven't heard 'em. / have. And I'm disgusted with the
prevalent attitude 1 perceive on this campus that
motivates such banter.
I'm writing this column on Wednesday morning
after seeing the discouraging electorate percen
tages reported after one day of voting: 8 to 9 per
cent turnout so far in the senate senior class elec
tions. 8 percent??? At an institution that is sup
posed to attract an intelligent population commit
ted to participating in society, who can rationalize
the fact that 92 percent of the student body found
something better to do than to choose the govern
ing body of the University?
Not only is this a tragic neglect of a privilege this
country was founded upon (the right to select
decision-making bodies), it's stupid!
The senate organizes and oversees all ASSU
sponsored events: that's everything from Sunday
Flicks to the Linen Service; the COP is, in essence,
the presidential or executive arm of Stanford stu
dents. They do just a few things â€” like co-sponsor
the recent contract awarded for a student-run Cof
fee House. Translated into economics: a cup of
coffee costs you 5 cents less; a sandwich 25 cents
less, since the students took over the management.
What about fee assessments? Twenty percent of
the students must vote to pass the funding requests
of the organizations granted fee assessments. In the
last election, the elections commissioner had to
scrounge to meet that minimum. One booth was set
up outside Maples Pavilion to lure avid tennis
players.
1 find two unreconcilable problems with this:
1) More than 15 campus organizations depend
on your financial token each quarter. Twenty per
cent must approve the funding; I'll bet that close to
100 percent of the students benefit from aHeast
one service. (If you're reading this paper, you've
already qualified for one.) Why must the elections
commission search you out? Why must those
groups that you take advantage of have to beg for
support?

2) When the 20 percent is finally mustered, how
can the remaining HO percent of the students accept
the financial consequence? An estimated $40 is
automatically added to your registration costs each
year to subsidize fee assessment groups. Sure, you
can get a refund. But it takes longer to collect the
refund than to vote no in the first place!
People act as though you're bothering them by
reminding them to vote. From my point of view
(admittedly biased by my own recent candidacy),
I'm doing them a favor. With an undergraduate
representation of 10 in the senate, it really does
matter. The whole flavor and momentum of the
senate can be changed with the personalities of
fered on each ballot.
Traditionally, apathy and voting have been prob
lems in the country. But at Stanford, where

everyone can read and write, where polling places
are practically delivered to you in the shower and
where the potential for student action is so encour
aged, how can you afford not to vote?
We say we are committed to improvement, to
responsible government and soon, but when it
comes time for action, for an opinion to be trans
lated into a representation, we'd rather sit by a
swimming pool and hypocritically complain.
My purpose was not to condemn this commun
ity, but rather to bring up some of the consequ
ences of adopting the dangerous path of least resis
tance and interpreting doing nothing as affecting
nothing.
Maybe, just maybe, we'll break past 20 percent
turnout by today's results. Tell me, what will
the other 80 percent say next year when "the se
nate isn't doing anything"?
