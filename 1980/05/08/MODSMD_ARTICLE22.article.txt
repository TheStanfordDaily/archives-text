## Sense of humor deficient 
### 
Editor Bill Burger's statement
on Friday's bowling hoax is a
humorless, self-righteous bunch
of claptrap.
The hoax was a joke. In re
trospect — considering how
many people took it seriously —
it was probably a bad joke.
Nevertheless, no one was ir
reparably hurt. Burger's claims
to the contrary, and the persons
responsible have issued a formal,
and to my mind, fully satisfactory
apology.
Apparently this does not
satisfy Burger. No, he wants his
pound of flesh too. He argues
that The Stanford Daily's credi
bility has been permanently un
dermined, demands blood
money of at least $2000, and
stops just short of calling for ex
pulsion.
Burger, youare blowing things
all out of proportion. First of all,
the reputation of the Daily was
neither so high as you claim it
was,nor has it fallen so low as you
claim it has.

Second, don't pretend the
Daily never prints articles as
pranks. Have you forgotten the
April Fool's Day issue on the
shah of Iran being made a
Hoover fellow, the FBI bugging
dorms, and so forth?
Third, you and the Daily
hardly qualify as the Emily Post
of journalistic etiquette. Just a
few weeks ago, when an elderly
woman perished as the result of a
hospital fire, the Daily treated us
to a picture of the charred death
bed.
Fourth, other than securing
personal revenge, what possible
purpose can be served by fining
the seven guilty students and
suspending or expelling them? If
irresponsibility and silliness is a
crime, rush participants should
be imprisoned. If callousness al
ways merits fines, the Daily's
"nonpartisan" reporting of our
government's latest pretenses
for war and Prof. Emeritus Wil
liam Shockley's pronounce
ments on genetics should long
ago have driven it into bank
ruptcy.
Our country's colleges, and
the Stanford country club-cum
university in particular, breed
mindlessness, irresponsibility
and contempt for the masses of
people. You can't change that by
tarring and feathering seven im
poster bowlers.
The only substantive issue
Burger raises in his statement is
whether there was any humor in
the prank. The guilty seven claim
the joke was too subtle. No, re
torts Burger, that is a slander on
the Stanford community in gen
eral and on Dean of Student Af
fairs Jim Lyons in particular.

("He (Lyons), as the seven per
sons would have us all believe,
was not alert enough to catch the
subtlety of the 'humor' in the
hoax . . .".) Sorry, Burger, but I
don't see it that way. Perhaps I
am insufficiently reverent, or
sufficiently irreverent as the case
may be, but it seems to me at
least possible that a dean — yes,
even a dean — might miss a joke.
Now I'm not an expert on
humor, but 1 do have a sense of
humor, which is apparently more
than Burger can claim. So let me
say a few words about the prank.
I've never met any of the seven,
and knew nothing of the prank
ahead of time, but when I read
Friday's Daily I knew the picture
was a joke. I knew the Daily
would not be so gross as to 1)
print a picture of smiling bowlers
under a tragic headline (with a
pun) while 2) postponing all de
tails until Monday. That seemed
obvious to me.
Why, at the beginning of this
quarter when I read about the
shah of Iran's appointment as a
Hoover fellow and the FBI bug
ging of student dorms, I really
believed it at first. It seemed
cruel and morbid — crueler and
more morbid than a bowling
team accident, if you want my
honest opinion — but unfortu
nately all too believable. When I
discovered upon closer reading
that it was a joke, I was very em
barrassed, but had to laugh at
myself.
So I understand people being
taken in by a prank. What
bothers me is how they react, or
don't react. Why is it that so
many people were offended by
the picture of the bowlers, and so
few by other, much more tragic
examples of black humor, both
intentional and unintentional, in
past Daily's?
It seems to me that the prob
lem at Stanford — and not just at
Stanford — is that too many
people are deficient in both a
sense of humor and a sense of
tragedy. Thus we get — instead
of real ferment, real searching —
an atmosphere of sublime passiv
ity, broken by occasional teapot
tempests. Such a teapot tempest
is Friday's prank and the over
reaction to it. All I can say.
Burger, is this, too, must pass.

The only substantive issue
Burger raises in his statement is
whether there was any humor in
the prank. The guilty seven claim
the joke was too subtle. No, re
torts Burger, that is a slander on
the Stanford community in gen
eral and on Dean of Student Af
fairs Jim Lyons in particular.

("He (Lyons), as the seven per
sons would have us all believe,
was not alert enough to catch the
subtlety of the 'humor' in the
hoax . . .".) Sorry, Burger, but I
don't see it that way. Perhaps I
am insufficiently reverent, or
sufficiently irreverent as the case
may be, but it seems to me at
least possible that a dean — yes,
even a dean — might miss a joke.
Now I'm not an expert on
humor, but 1 do have a sense of
humor, which is apparently more
than Burger can claim. So let me
say a few words about the prank.
I've never met any of the seven,
and knew nothing of the prank
ahead of time, but when I read
Friday's Daily I knew the picture
was a joke. I knew the Daily
would not be so gross as to 1)
print a picture of smiling bowlers
under a tragic headline (with a
pun) while 2) postponing all de
tails until Monday. That seemed
obvious to me.
Why, at the beginning of this
quarter when I read about the
shah of Iran's appointment as a
Hoover fellow and the FBI bug
ging of student dorms, I really
believed it at first. It seemed
cruel and morbid — crueler and
more morbid than a bowling
team accident, if you want my
honest opinion — but unfortu
nately all too believable. When I
discovered upon closer reading
that it was a joke, I was very em
barrassed, but had to laugh at
myself.
So I understand people being
taken in by a prank. What
bothers me is how they react, or
don't react. Why is it that so
many people were offended by
the picture of the bowlers, and so
few by other, much more tragic
examples of black humor, both
intentional and unintentional, in
past Daily's?
It seems to me that the prob
lem at Stanford — and not just at
Stanford — is that too many
people are deficient in both a
sense of humor and a sense of
tragedy. Thus we get — instead
of real ferment, real searching —
an atmosphere of sublime passiv
ity, broken by occasional teapot
tempests. Such a teapot tempest
is Friday's prank and the over
reaction to it. All I can say.
Burger, is this, too, must pass.
(Kent Osband is a non
matriculated graduate student in
economics.)
Editor Bill Burger's statement
on Friday's bowling hoax is a
humorless, self-righteous bunch
of claptrap.
The hoax was a joke. In re
trospect — considering how
many people took it seriously —
it was probably a bad joke.
Nevertheless, no one was ir
reparably hurt. Burger's claims
to the contrary, and the persons
responsible have issued a formal,
and to my mind, fully satisfactory
apology.
Apparently this does not
satisfy Burger. No, he wants his
pound of flesh too. He argues
that The Stanford Daily's credi
bility has been permanently un
dermined, demands blood
money of at least $2000, and
stops just short of calling for ex
pulsion.
Burger, youare blowing things
all out of proportion. First of all,
the reputation of the Daily was
neither so high as you claim it
was,nor has it fallen so low as you
claim it has.

Second, don't pretend the
Daily never prints articles as
pranks. Have you forgotten the
April Fool's Day issue on the
shah of Iran being made a
Hoover fellow, the FBI bugging
dorms, and so forth?
Third, you and the Daily
hardly qualify as the Emily Post
of journalistic etiquette. Just a
few weeks ago, when an elderly
woman perished as the result of a
hospital fire, the Daily treated us
to a picture of the charred death
bed.
Fourth, other than securing
personal revenge, what possible
purpose can be served by fining
the seven guilty students and
suspending or expelling them? If
irresponsibility and silliness is a
crime, rush participants should
be imprisoned. If callousness al
ways merits fines, the Daily's
"nonpartisan" reporting of our
government's latest pretenses
for war and Prof. Emeritus Wil
liam Shockley's pronounce
ments on genetics should long
ago have driven it into bank
ruptcy.
Our country's colleges, and
the Stanford country club-cum
university in particular, breed
mindlessness, irresponsibility
and contempt for the masses of
people. You can't change that by
tarring and feathering seven im
poster bowlers.
