# Jerry Rubin speaks in Kresge
## War protester returns 
### Laura Kaufman Staff Writer 
Jerry Rubin, an early or
ganizer of the student anti-war
movement, co-founder of the
Youth International Party (yip
pie) and a member of the
Chicago Seven, accused of start
ing riots during the 1968 Demo
cratic Convention, will speak to
night at 7:30 in Kresge Au
ditorium.
Roughly a decade ago, Rubin
excited an overflow crowd in
Memorial Auditorium, speaking
out against the Vietnam War, the
Establishment, parents and trad
ition.
Bob Beyers, director of Stan
ford University's News Service,
attended that speech 10 years
ago. He said he was amazed at
the audience's reaction to Ru
bin's radical philosophy.

"To see that big an audience
on its feet with enthusiasm, re
sponding to ideas such as burn
ing books, was one of the most
fundamentally anti-intellectual
experiences I have ever witnes
sed in 19 years at Stanford," he
said.
Rubin, who is once again on
the college lecture circuit, said he
now speaks on change during the
past 20 years, from '60s activism
to '70s apathy and '80s aware
ness. He includes issues such as
womens rights, the draft, nuclear
power, solar energy, health and
consciousness-raising between
men and women.
He will also cover the " '60s
experience," reflecting on stu
dent political power, the drug
culture and how the political
consciousness of the '60s turned
into the apathy of the "me gen

eration" in the '70s.
"I'm less angry now than I was
in the '605," Rubin said. This re
flects this decade's emphasis on
personal growth, honesty and
vulnerability, he said.
"The most notable ac
complishment I've made lately in
terms of activism is getting ar
rested last year in an anti-nuclear
rally," he said. "And I've grown
back my beard," he added.
Rubin now describes himself
as "a consciousness leader and
organizer," and said he sees the
'80s as a time to unite political
and personal awareness.
There is no admission charge
for the event, which will be fol
lowed by a press conference and
reception. The speech is spon
sored by the ASSU Speakers
Bureau.
