## A
						super 'Superstar' 
### 
Mega" is the Stanford col
loquialism which best describes
the Company's plans for its
spring production of Jesus Christ
Superstar. And yet, in terms of
dollars spent, talent involved,
and time and effort expended,
director Todd Harris and pro
ducer Mike McNabb expect
Superstar to be even more than a
mega-production.
"It will be more than a play. It
will be an extravaganza," Harris
said of the show, which will be
presented May 28-31 in Frost
Amphitheatre.
Superstar is operting on a
$30,000 budget which, accord
ing to McNabb, is the largest any
Stanford show has touched.
"Ram's Head prduced its last
show (Pippin) on our sound
budget alone," McNabb said.
Night out
The Company attributed the
unprecedented cost of Superstar
to the fact that it will be a night
production in Frost.
"When we decided we wanted
to do Superstar we decided that
we wanted to do it big and do it
right," Harris explained. So, the
group went to ASSU Special
Events and sought permission to
use the amphitheater.
"Everything is always being
shown in Mem Aud and we felt
people needed a change,"
McNabb said.
"People said we wouldn't be
able to raise the money it would
take to have it in Frost but we've

done a lot of things with this
show that people said couldn't he
done."
McNabb and Harris sought
funds from companies, organiza
tions and individuals outside
Stanford to finance the show.
Coca-Cola contributed money to
the production, as have other
companies to which McNabb
sent letters.
Superstar has received money
from two direct investors who
will be entitled to percentages of
the show's profit. Theta Delta
Chi, a fraternity here, has contri
buted funds and the ASSU lent
$2000 to the Superstar produc
tion.
The Company's small finan
cial contribution serves mainly to
legitimize Superstar as a Start
ford student production, accord
ing to McNabb. The Company
will receive the remaining profit
after investors and bills are paid.
Renaissance
"Last year's production of
Hair helped the renaissance of
the Company and Jesus Christ
Superstar will establish it."
Frost holds 9500 people and
Harris hopes for an audience of
1500 to 2500 each night.
"We expect at least one third
of the student,body to see it,"
McNabb said. He cited a full
moon' in May, the fact that the
show will be staged in Frost, and
the popularity of the play as
three factors which would attract
a large crowd.

Advertising, on which they are
spending $9000, also should
send people to the show,
McNabb said.
"No one has ever mady a more
concerted effort to sell a show
than the Company has this
year."
Harris, McNabb and set de
signer Peter Maradudin decided
on Superstar last year and have
been working on it since then.
"A show is not worth doing
unless I am completely obsessed
with it," Harris said. Harris a
junior, stopped out this quarter
to devote his full energies to the
show. McNabb, also a junior,,
stopped out last quarter to work
on the production. They worked
together on Hair last year, Harris
as its producer and McNabb as
its house manager.
About 120 students au
ditioned in January for
Superstar's cast of 45. The pro
duction staff of 40 will be aug
mented by another 40 workers
needed for each night's perfor
in e nee.
Superstars
Dick Butterfield, who played
the lead in Hair last year, will
portray Judas and Jeff Bell, who
played Jesus in Branner's 1978
production ofGodspell, will play
Jesus Christ.
"Dick and Jeff are two of the
most amazing people on cam
pus" Harris and McNabb ag
reed. "If their performances
come off like they should, it will
be an amazing show." Harris
said.
" If I can get people to cry and
get them completely sucked into
what's going on onstage, I'll be
happy." he continued. He said
that his measure of the show's
success also will be determined
: by the critics' reaction to his di
rection.
Success will be measured for
McNabb by the number of
people who see the show and by
the amount of money the show
will bring to the Company.
The musical already has met
with considerable success, ac
cording to McNabb. because of
tfce friendships generated among
those involved with Superstar.
McNabb would not comment
upon the possibility of touring
the show, stating. "You can't tell
if it's going to be good enough to
tour it until you see it.
"Noone has known how to tap
the resources here," McNabb
said, stating that Stanford has
lacked a sufficient amount of
student drama.
"It's really exciting for me to be
able to say I've had a hand in
what I think will be a really
dynamic show."
Harris said he has yet to see a
production of Superstar which he
has liked. He hopes the "mega
production" which will become a
reality later this month will ena
ble him to speak differently.
