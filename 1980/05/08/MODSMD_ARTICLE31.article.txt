# Cinematheque
## Punk on celluloid 
### 
The Stanford Cinematheque will present three film festivals in
May.
Working from last to first, the Cinematheque is sponsoring its first
Student Film Festival on May 30, open to all students.
Donations will he taken at the door and pooled into a "winner
take-all" first prize, with the winning film selected by an audience
vote on the night of the show.
Interested filmmakers should submit entry forms, available at the
Tresidder Information Desk or the Communication Department
Office by Friday. No entry fee is required.
Punk it
On May 28, it's a Punk Film Festival, with films by and about punks
or just done with a punk attitude or style. Featured are Bruce Con
ner's Mongoloid, set to the music of Devo; Babeth's Berlin Grafitti,
which contains early Sex Pistol's footage; Third Reich 'n' Roll, a short
ditty from the Residents; plus Jimmy Guitar with his cutting broom.
Standish Lawder's Necrology, and at least three more.
Innovate
Finally, May 21 will offer films by two of the most innovative
independent filmmakers today — Robert Breer and Stan Brakhage.
Breer graduated from Stanford in 1949 as a painter and took up
filmmaking in the 19505. Since, he has become one of the leading
innovators in the field of graphic cinema, his work critically
acclaimed worldwide. The evening's set will consist of films from
Breer's different stages of development, offering a collage of sorts of
his work. Brakhage, meanwhile, takes a very "different" approach to
film — his work tries to portray inner as well as outer vision, thoughts
and dreams as well as material images, and so draws the audience in
as part of the art-event. It is hard to span Brakhage's4o-film career,
so some of his more accessible works will be screened.
All shows are at 8 p.m. upstairs in TresidJer, Rooms 270-71. The
Punk Festival also will have a late screening at 10 p.m. Requested
donations are $ 1.50, $1.25 students (except for the student festival).
Student Arts at Stanford (STARTS) is the sponsor.
