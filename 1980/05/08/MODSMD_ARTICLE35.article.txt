# Shinoda: In film a search for the future
## 
### 
"Whatever is in the process of
being destroyed is beautiful."
This remark by Japanese film di
rector Masahiro Shinoda best
expresses his creative
philosophy.
Shinoda. who presented his
1964 film Assasination here last
week, is nostalgic about a past
which, he said. Japan is quickly
losing. His film is set in the Meiji
restoration in the mid- 19th cen
tury. a tumultuous period in Ja
pan's history when, in Shinoda's
words. "Japan had to face the
outside world. The Meiji restora
tion discovered the emperor in
order to unify the country and
face the massive industrial power
of the West which was visible in
terms of the black gunships of
Commodore Perry."
The film follows the life of
Hachiro Kiokawa. the head of a
prominent fencing school, and a
staunch supporter of the em

peror. Kiokawa is jailed for the
murder of a policeman who
attacked one of his disciples but is
released on the condition that he
serve the shogunate, the military
government, against the em
peror.
Diaries
Shinoda based the film on the
diaries of Kiokawa. "His politi
cal posturing seems to be con
tradictory to him as a man. 1 felt a
sadness that his idealism
changed in a political struggle."
In the film Kiokawa is first
seen as a samurai who despises
death and killing but who. as the
film progresses, becomes more
callous and begins to enjoy
cruelty. In the end. he cannot live
without it.
Kiokawa deserts the shogu
nate's cause for the emperors
but finally is assasinated because
he is considered untrustworthy
by his pro-imperial friends.

Shinoda paints a very cold and
removed picture of the cruelty
and bloodshed of the period. But
we do feel a kind of sympathy for
Kiokawa. a man whose humanity
has been numbed by a lust for
power.
Metaphor
Shinoda uses the Meiji resto
ration as a metaphor for the pre
sent. "As Japan was moving to
ward a more rational and scien
tific society it was also moving
toward a more religious and mys
tical one. There has been no sol
ution to this tension." he said.
Critics accuse Shinoda of
fatalism. They say that he sees
masochism and violence as a part
of the Japanese character.
Shinoda denies this. He blames,
in large part, the American oc
cupation after World War II and
the tragedy of Hiroshima and
Nagasaki for the dark side of the
Japanese character. "That kind

of experience of violence has
given the Japanese people a very
strict and uncompromising view
toward violence, and the culture
shock born out of the occupation
of Japan combined the shame
and the more pleasant aspects of
the new society."
Shinoda sees the post-war
Japanese mentality as being re
flected in the relationships bet
ween the sexes, in the same way
that the Vietnam war was "an at
tempt to assert America's male
ness and. when that failed, it
helped to bring about the wo
men's liberation movement."
In the past "Japanese people
have been unified by belief in a
spiritual and godlike nature,
Shintoism. The representative of
that kind of nation was the em
peror and protecting him was the
same as loving the country. As
Japan changed into a society that
is built on contracts rather than
interpersonal relationships, this
has brought about a dissolution
of this kind of nationhood. I ran
only think now that there is a
coopertive society for economic

reasons."
We have come to a very dif
ficult point in time," Shinoda
continued, "when we are search
ing for the society of the future."
Shinoda was a member of the
"Of una Nouvelle Vague"
movement within the Japanese
cinema in the '60s. They labeled
the glossy. American-influenced
films of 't'he Ofuna Studios as
"enemy," and favored a more
spontaneous and socially relev-

ant cinema.
Shinoda has been able to make
non-commercially oriented films
like Assasination because
"Japanese capitalism is not as
well developed as in the United
States. There is a space for inde
pendent filmmakers that does
not exist in America."
But fewer independent films
are made in Japan each year, ac
cording to Shinoda.
The problem is not financing
production of a film, but cover
ing costs of distribution and ad
vertising which is particularly
expensive in Japan.
But, according to Shinoda,
Japan remajns a good place to
make non-commerical films be
cause it is "the people who are at
the fringes of capitalist and
socialist society that are the ones
with a delicate sensitivity toward
art.
And yet, "as Susan Sontag has
said in her book On Photo
graphy, the era of films like mine
is almost over."
