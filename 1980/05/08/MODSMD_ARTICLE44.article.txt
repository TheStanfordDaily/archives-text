Balanced budget plan approved
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday ap
proved a $6' 1.8 billion 1981 spending plan that pro
jects the first balanced federal budget in 12 years.
The measure provides for a $ 10.3-billion tax cut,
using earmarked revenues from President Jimmy
Carter's 10-cent-a-gallon import fee on gasoline, and
projects a surplus of $2 billion for fiscal year 1981,
which will start Oct. 1.
The budget, approved on a 225-193 vote, drew
most of its support from Democrats. It comes at a
time of increasing concern that a severe recession
could make balancing the 1981 budget impossible.
Rep. Delbert Latta of Ohio, ranking Republican
on the Budget Committee, urged his GOP colleagues
to "swallow their pride and vote for the principle of a
balanced budget" even though domestic spending
was higher than they would like.
However, Rep. Robert Bauman (R-Md.J, a lead
ing House conservative, said a deepening economic
recession had made the proposed balanced budget a
"sham" and asked Republicans to oppose it.
Rep. Richard Ottinger (D-N.Y.) claimed that last
month's sharp increase in unemployment — from 6.2
percent in March to 7 percent in April — was proof
that in projecting a balanced budget, "we're just kid
ding ourselves."
Some economists believe that the approaching re
cession could push unemployment up to 9 percent —
the high-water mark of the 1974-75 recession — and
turn the S2 billion surplus in the House budget into a
$40 billion deficit.
Mondale arrives for Tito funeral
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale arrived yesterday in Belgrade, Yugos
lavia for the funeral of President Josip Broz Tito,
pledging stronger ties between the United States and
Communist Yugoslavia.
Administration sources said yesterday that many
officials both at the White House and at the State
Department had hoped President Jimmy Carter
would go to Belgrade, and feared that Carter's ab
sence could weaken U.S. interests in Europe and the
Third World, at least in the short term.
Reports from Belgrade and criticism in the Euro
pean press indicated that Carter's absence was con
spicuous. especially in light of the attendance of ailing
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in Belgrade — a
move widely seen as a Soviet start on improving ties
with the independent communist state.
A senior White House official stressed, however,
that the president has made very clear the U.S. sup
port for Yugoslavia's independence and integrity in
the post-Tito era. "We believe the Yugoslav govern
ment fully understands this. The Yugoslavs know
who their friends are. who poses a threat to them and
who does not," he added.
Senate confirms Muskie, 94-2
WASHINGTON — Edmund Muskie was con
firmed by the Senate as secretary of state yesterdav
alter stating his intention to play the central ad\ isorv
and advocacy roles in a "positive diplomacy" for the
United States. The vote was 94-2.

Earlier in the day, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee sent Muskie's nomination on to the full
Senate with a 12-1 vote after Muskie promised that
he, and not White House National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski, will be President Jimmy Car
ter's principal spokesman on foreign policy.
"President Carter has made it clear that he expects
me to play this role, and 1 intend to do so," Muskie
said.
All who spoke concerning Muskie's confirmation
praised Muskie for his Senate role in passing land
mark environmental legislation, for his leadership as
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and for
the experience he takes with him to the State De
partment.
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee called it "a wise choice."
"1 believe he will be in the tradition of the great
secretaries of state," Baker said.
Muskie. expressing his general foreign policy
philosophy, generally endorsed the course the ad
ministration has taken.
He did emphasize, however, his belief that the
United States should again explore essentially dip
lomatic means of obtaining the release of the Ameri
can hostages in Iran and hinted broadly at a distaste
for further U.S. military action against Iran.
Marines oversee Cuban refugees
KEY WEST. Fla. — U.S. Marines were called in
yesterday as thousands more Cubans jammed shel
ters short on space and food in a quickening flow of
refugees to the United States.
Under a state of emergency declared by President
Jimmy Carter. 500 Marines were sent by the Penta
gon to assist 700 Florida National Guardsmen trying
to keep order in the refugee camps.
Gen. k.C. Bullard. guard commander, said the
state troops would remain on duty temporarily to
"insure an orderly transition."
The Carter administration announced that a sec
ond processing center for Cuban refugees will be
opened at Fort Chaffee Army Reserve base near Fort
Smith, Ark.
Pentagon officials said the first refugees could
begin arriving at Fort Chaffee by this weekend, re
lieving the overburdened processing center at Eglin
Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle.
The tide of refugees reaching Key West. Fla.. hit a
single-day high of 4000 on Tuesday, lifting the
number of Cubans reaching the United States by boat
in the last two weeks to more than 20.000.
Pentagon officials said that Eglin eventually should
be able to handle about 10.000 refugees, but that the
Cubans are coming too rapidly now, so that the Eglin
facilities are heavily strained.
Fort Chaffee, which was used in 1975 and 1 976 as a
processing center for some of the more than 50.000
refugees from Southeast Asia who fled to the United
States, eventually will be able to handle about 15.000
refugees, officials said.
W. Germans describe Iran scare
BRUSSELS. Belgium — Four West German jour
nalists have disclosed details of a 42-hour ordeal in

Iran, where they were accused of being intelligence
agents for the United States and were threatened
with execution.
The four correspondents of the magazine Stern

the early hours of April 29 by a group of armed
Iranians with automatic weapons who were searching
the hotel for U.S. "agents."
Hans-Werner Huerner, 33, of Hamburg, and his
three colleagues described a terrifying period of im
prisonment, interrogation and psychological pressure
at the hands of what appeared to be the Central
Revolutionary Committee of Tehran.
According to Huebner and his colleagues, the Ira
nians produced photographs of the wreckage in the
Iranian desert that marked the end of the unsuccess
ful American raid to rescue the hostages in Tehran.
Among them was one widely published in the Iranian
press, showing stacks of U.S. $100 bills. The German
correspondents said that their captors accused fhem
of providing the bills to the American raiding party.
Late the next afternoon, however, the Iranians
came into the single bare room in which the Germans
had been held and told them that they were free to
leave as a result of outside pressure and"the fact that
we decided you are innocent."

W. Germans describe Iran scare
BRUSSELS. Belgium — Four West German jour
nalists have disclosed details of a 42-hour ordeal in

Iran, where they were accused of being intelligence
agents for the United States and were threatened
with execution.
The four correspondents of the magazine Stern
were seized at the Tehran Inter-Continental Hotel in
the early hours of April 29 by a group of armed
Iranians with automatic weapons who were searching
the hotel for U.S. "agents."
Hans-Werner Huerner, 33, of Hamburg, and his
three colleagues described a terrifying period of im
prisonment, interrogation and psychological pressure
at the hands of what appeared to be the Central
Revolutionary Committee of Tehran.
According to Huebner and his colleagues, the Ira
nians produced photographs of the wreckage in the
Iranian desert that marked the end of the unsuccess
ful American raid to rescue the hostages in Tehran.
Among them was one widely published in the Iranian
press, showing stacks of U.S. $100 bills. The German
correspondents said that their captors accused fhem
of providing the bills to the American raiding party.
Late the next afternoon, however, the Iranians
came into the single bare room in which the Germans
had been held and told them that they were free to
leave as a result of outside pressure and"the fact that
we decided you are innocent."

Balanced budget plan approved
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday ap
proved a $6' 1.8 billion 1981 spending plan that pro
jects the first balanced federal budget in 12 years.
The measure provides for a $ 10.3-billion tax cut,
using earmarked revenues from President Jimmy
Carter's 10-cent-a-gallon import fee on gasoline, and
projects a surplus of $2 billion for fiscal year 1981,
which will start Oct. 1.
The budget, approved on a 225-193 vote, drew
most of its support from Democrats. It comes at a
time of increasing concern that a severe recession
could make balancing the 1981 budget impossible.
Rep. Delbert Latta of Ohio, ranking Republican
on the Budget Committee, urged his GOP colleagues
to "swallow their pride and vote for the principle of a
balanced budget" even though domestic spending
was higher than they would like.
However, Rep. Robert Bauman (R-Md.J, a lead
ing House conservative, said a deepening economic
recession had made the proposed balanced budget a
"sham" and asked Republicans to oppose it.
Rep. Richard Ottinger (D-N.Y.) claimed that last
month's sharp increase in unemployment — from 6.2
percent in March to 7 percent in April — was proof
that in projecting a balanced budget, "we're just kid
ding ourselves."
Some economists believe that the approaching re
cession could push unemployment up to 9 percent —
the high-water mark of the 1974-75 recession — and
turn the S2 billion surplus in the House budget into a
$40 billion deficit.
Mondale arrives for Tito funeral
BELGRADE, Yugoslavia — Vice President Wal
ter Mondale arrived yesterday in Belgrade, Yugos
lavia for the funeral of President Josip Broz Tito,
pledging stronger ties between the United States and
Communist Yugoslavia.
Administration sources said yesterday that many
officials both at the White House and at the State
Department had hoped President Jimmy Carter
would go to Belgrade, and feared that Carter's ab
sence could weaken U.S. interests in Europe and the
Third World, at least in the short term.
Reports from Belgrade and criticism in the Euro
pean press indicated that Carter's absence was con
spicuous. especially in light of the attendance of ailing
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in Belgrade — a
move widely seen as a Soviet start on improving ties
with the independent communist state.
A senior White House official stressed, however,
that the president has made very clear the U.S. sup
port for Yugoslavia's independence and integrity in
the post-Tito era. "We believe the Yugoslav govern
ment fully understands this. The Yugoslavs know
who their friends are. who poses a threat to them and
who does not," he added.
Senate confirms Muskie, 94-2
WASHINGTON — Edmund Muskie was con
firmed by the Senate as secretary of state yesterdav
alter stating his intention to play the central ad\ isorv
and advocacy roles in a "positive diplomacy" for the
United States. The vote was 94-2.

Earlier in the day, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee sent Muskie's nomination on to the full
Senate with a 12-1 vote after Muskie promised that
he, and not White House National Security Advisor
Zbigniew Brzezinski, will be President Jimmy Car
ter's principal spokesman on foreign policy.
"President Carter has made it clear that he expects
me to play this role, and 1 intend to do so," Muskie
said.
All who spoke concerning Muskie's confirmation
praised Muskie for his Senate role in passing land
mark environmental legislation, for his leadership as
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and for
the experience he takes with him to the State De
partment.
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee called it "a wise choice."
"1 believe he will be in the tradition of the great
secretaries of state," Baker said.
Muskie. expressing his general foreign policy
philosophy, generally endorsed the course the ad
ministration has taken.
He did emphasize, however, his belief that the
United States should again explore essentially dip
lomatic means of obtaining the release of the Ameri
can hostages in Iran and hinted broadly at a distaste
for further U.S. military action against Iran.
Marines oversee Cuban refugees
KEY WEST. Fla. — U.S. Marines were called in
yesterday as thousands more Cubans jammed shel

refugees to the United States.
Under a state of emergency declared by President
Jimmy Carter. 500 Marines were sent by the Penta
gon to assist 700 Florida National Guardsmen trying
to keep order in the refugee camps.
Gen. k.C. Bullard. guard commander, said the
state troops would remain on duty temporarily to
"insure an orderly transition."

opened at Fort Chaffee Army Reserve base near Fort
Smith, Ark.
Pentagon officials said the first refugees could
begin arriving at Fort Chaffee by this weekend, re

Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle.
The tide of refugees reaching Key West. Fla.. hit a
single-day high of 4000 on Tuesday, lifting the
number of Cubans reaching the United States by boat

pledging stronger ties between the United States and
Communist Yugoslavia.
Administration sources said yesterday that many
officials both at the White House and at the State
Department had hoped President Jimmy Carter
would go to Belgrade, and feared that Carter's ab
sence could weaken U.S. interests in Europe and the
Third World, at least in the short term.
Reports from Belgrade and criticism in the Euro
pean press indicated that Carter's absence was con
spicuous. especially in light of the attendance of ailing
Soviet President Leonid Brezhnev in Belgrade — a
move widely seen as a Soviet start on improving ties
with the independent communist state.
A senior White House official stressed, however,
that the president has made very clear the U.S. sup
port for Yugoslavia's independence and integrity in
the post-Tito era. "We believe the Yugoslav govern
ment fully understands this. The Yugoslavs know
who their friends are. who poses a threat to them and
who does not," he added.

and advocacy roles in a "positive diplomacy" for the
United States. The vote was 94-2.

"President Carter has made it clear that he expects
me to play this role, and 1 intend to do so," Muskie
said.
All who spoke concerning Muskie's confirmation

mark environmental legislation, for his leadership as
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee and for
the experience he takes with him to the State De
partment.
Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker of Ten
nessee called it "a wise choice."
"1 believe he will be in the tradition of the great
secretaries of state," Baker said.
Muskie. expressing his general foreign policy
philosophy, generally endorsed the course the ad

He did emphasize, however, his belief that the
United States should again explore essentially dip
lomatic means of obtaining the release of the Ameri
can hostages in Iran and hinted broadly at a distaste
for further U.S. military action against Iran.
Marines oversee Cuban refugees
KEY WEST. Fla. — U.S. Marines were called in
yesterday as thousands more Cubans jammed shel
ters short on space and food in a quickening flow of
refugees to the United States.
Under a state of emergency declared by President
Jimmy Carter. 500 Marines were sent by the Penta
gon to assist 700 Florida National Guardsmen trying
to keep order in the refugee camps.
Gen. k.C. Bullard. guard commander, said the
state troops would remain on duty temporarily to
"insure an orderly transition."
The Carter administration announced that a sec
ond processing center for Cuban refugees will be
opened at Fort Chaffee Army Reserve base near Fort
Smith, Ark.
Pentagon officials said the first refugees could
begin arriving at Fort Chaffee by this weekend, re
lieving the overburdened processing center at Eglin
Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle.
The tide of refugees reaching Key West. Fla.. hit a
single-day high of 4000 on Tuesday, lifting the
number of Cubans reaching the United States by boat
in the last two weeks to more than 20.000.
Pentagon officials said that Eglin eventually should
be able to handle about 10.000 refugees, but that the
Cubans are coming too rapidly now, so that the Eglin
facilities are heavily strained.
Fort Chaffee, which was used in 1975 and 1 976 as a
processing center for some of the more than 50.000
refugees from Southeast Asia who fled to the United
States, eventually will be able to handle about 15.000
refugees, officials said.
W. Germans describe Iran scare
BRUSSELS. Belgium — Four West German jour
nalists have disclosed details of a 42-hour ordeal in

Iran, where they were accused of being intelligence
agents for the United States and were threatened
with execution.
The four correspondents of the magazine Stern
were seized at the Tehran Inter-Continental Hotel in
the early hours of April 29 by a group of armed
Iranians with automatic weapons who were searching
the hotel for U.S. "agents."
Hans-Werner Huerner, 33, of Hamburg, and his
three colleagues described a terrifying period of im
prisonment, interrogation and psychological pressure
at the hands of what appeared to be the Central
Revolutionary Committee of Tehran.
According to Huebner and his colleagues, the Ira
nians produced photographs of the wreckage in the
Iranian desert that marked the end of the unsuccess
ful American raid to rescue the hostages in Tehran.
Among them was one widely published in the Iranian
press, showing stacks of U.S. $100 bills. The German
correspondents said that their captors accused fhem
of providing the bills to the American raiding party.
Late the next afternoon, however, the Iranians
came into the single bare room in which the Germans
had been held and told them that they were free to
leave as a result of outside pressure and"the fact that
we decided you are innocent."

Balanced budget plan approved
WASHINGTON — The House yesterday ap
proved a $6' 1.8 billion 1981 spending plan that pro
jects the first balanced federal budget in 12 years.
The measure provides for a $ 10.3-billion tax cut,
using earmarked revenues from President Jimmy
Carter's 10-cent-a-gallon import fee on gasoline, and
projects a surplus of $2 billion for fiscal year 1981,
which will start Oct. 1.
The budget, approved on a 225-193 vote, drew
most of its support from Democrats. It comes at a
time of increasing concern that a severe recession
could make balancing the 1981 budget impossible.
Rep. Delbert Latta of Ohio, ranking Republican
on the Budget Committee, urged his GOP colleagues
to "swallow their pride and vote for the principle of a
balanced budget" even though domestic spending
was higher than they would like.
However, Rep. Robert Bauman (R-Md.J, a lead
ing House conservative, said a deepening economic
recession had made the proposed balanced budget a
"sham" and asked Republicans to oppose it.
Rep. Richard Ottinger (D-N.Y.) claimed that last
month's sharp increase in unemployment — from 6.2
percent in March to 7 percent in April — was proof
that in projecting a balanced budget, "we're just kid
ding ourselves."
Some economists believe that the approaching re
cession could push unemployment up to 9 percent —
the high-water mark of the 1974-75 recession — and
turn the S2 billion surplus in the House budget into a
$40 billion deficit.
