### Cynthia Santana Staff Writer 
A lecture series promoting preven
tive medicine within the University
community will begin tonight with a
talk on the effects of exercise.
The series, "Health Yourself. Tak
ing the Initiative." will give students
information about how to lead more
healthy lives, according to Dorvn
Davis, director of the health promotion
at Cowell Student Health Center.
Cowell and Student Arts at Stanford
(STARTS) are the series coordinators.
"Preventive medicine is part of an
entire new movement in the health
field in which the objective is to recog
nize and alter lifestyle factors which
may contribute to subsequent health
diseases," Davis said. For the last seven
months Davis has initiated self-help

projects here through the newly
created preventive health program at
Cowell.
"Most people come to Cowell in a
curative capacity, identifying an injury
themselves and coming in for treat
ment. Self-help medicine is people just
taking responsibility for their lifestyles
and health." Davis said.
"With an awareness they can modify
their lifestyles. If a person can say "1
know I suffer stress in this type of situa
tion.' but learns to manage the stress, it
reduces any detrimental effect," she
added.
The idea of a lecture series was con
ceived by senior Dan Blumberg, a
psychology major. He came to
STARTS with a desire to share preven
tive health care information. After suf
fering from migraine headaches and

seeing doctors without getting signific
ant results, Blumberg became in
terested in how meditation, exercise
and diet might improve his health.
"1 found that my health is a function
of what I can do by minimizing what a
doctor needs to do. I found it necessary
to take total power over mv health,"
Blumberg said.
Senior Sarah Rockwell, an Ameri
can Studies major and chairperson of
STARTS Lecture and Classes Com
mittee, shared Blumberg's interest in
health care and took responsibility for
programming the Tresidder series.
Then Rockwell, Davis, and Blumberg
discussed topics which would be relev
ant to students
"We wanted to organize simple and
understandable presentations, en
couraging audience participation, in

areas most talked about by students.
These turned out tube things like nutri
tion, exercise and sexuality. We then
contacted experts in these fields to
create some sort of cohesive presenta
tion of preventive medicine,"
Rockwell said.
Two Thursday night lectures have
been scheduled. William Haskwell,
exercise physiologist here and member
of the Stanford Heart Disease Preven
tion Program will speak tonight on the
effects of exercise. Next Thursday,
Carol Rinkleib Ellison, well-known
psychologist, sex therapist and co
author of the book Understanding
Human Sexuality, will give a lecture
entitled "Sexuality, What's Right for
You?". Both free lectures will begin at
7 p.m. at Tresidder Union, second
floor.
