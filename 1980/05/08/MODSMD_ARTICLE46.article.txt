Yesterday's Daily article on the
Prop. 9 debate between Hoover Fellow
Alvin Rabushka and Education Prof.
Michael Kirst incorrectly identified
Rabushka as the president of the state
Board of Education. In actuality, Kirst
holds that post, not Rabushka.
The article also referred to cuts of
some state programs, when it means
cuts in some state programs. The Daily
regrets the errors.
