# Farm slate wins senior class race
## Kinney tops ASSU Senate vote 
### Dianne Cahoon News Editor 
Junior John Kinney garnered the
most votes, as a diverse group of un
dergraduates won ASSU Senate seats
in Tuesday and yesterday's elections.
Law student Steve Miller led in
graduate voting, and the only contested
fee assessment, an extra one-quarter
request by the Speakers Bureau, failed
to receive the required turnout for pas
sage.
In the Senior Class Presidents' run
off, the Frolic on the Farm slate, com
prised of Bill Kemmeries, Mary Ellen
Reilly, Ina Coleman and Jamie Halper,
beat out the BARB slate of Mark
Breier, Aleen Zimberoff, Renee
Richards and Jeff Bell, 329 to 258.
Sophomore John Newell, freshman
Mark Peterson and sophomore Casey
Gwinn were elected to the three Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
spots.
A total of 2396 students cast ballots
over the two days.
"Overall, the election went pretty
well," said Elections Commissioner
Doug Mitchell, considering that the
process was mandated only three
weeks ago by the first spring election
approval of the senate reform bill.
"We had a massive volume of things
to do in three weeks, so, naturally,
there were a few problems," he
explained. One name was misspelled
on the ballot, and two candidates'
statements were omitted from the
Election Pamphlet. The commissioners
officially apologized for those mis
takes.
The computer rented from a
Millbrae firm experienced minor dif
ficulties after Tuesday's initial ballot
ing and "went on the fritz again" last
night, according to Mitchell. Those
snags forced the re-processing of sev
eral ballots, but the counting was
nonetheless complete by 10:15. in time
to report the results to the senate meet
ing. The polls closed at 6 p.m.
All overseas votes have already been
tallied, with the exception of those
from Vienna. "Only six to eight votes
cUme in from Vienna last time," Mitch
ell said, "so that'very insignificant."
In lact, "we checked to see if any one
campus would make a difference in anv

of the races,"and found that none
would, he added.
Kinney, the current Inter-Fraternity
Council president, ran on a platform
emphasizing his University experience
and citing the addition of in
tradepartmental courses and
heightened awareness of campus al
cohol abuse as his key goals. Under
graduate runner-up Sue Goldfark a
junior English and communication
major, had campaigned for the re
vamping of the Draw and the estab
lishment of a CPPC task force.
Compared to the 49 undergraduate
candidates, only 11 graduate students
petitioned to obtain ballot spots. They
all, therefore, were awarded either se

nate or alternate positions. Six medical
students became alternate graduate
senators via write-in votes.
Although approximately 12 percent
ot the students turned out to vote yes
terday, the Speakers Bureau fee as
sessment request accumulated tallies
from only 16.1 percent of the student
population. To pass, a fee assessment
must be voted upon by at least 20 per
cent of the entire student body.
The Speakers Bureau had already
received a two-quarter assessment for
next year in the last election. It was
asking for a fall quarter assessment as
well, to allow for a more organized
schedule at the beginning of the
academic year.
