# Militants continue to disperse hostages
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Militants were reported yesterday to
have moved a 1 2th group of American
hostages from the occupied U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran to another city. Two
Iranian leaders rejected a suggestion
by British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher that the freedom of the U.S.
prisoners could come faster because of
the commando raid freeing Iranian
hostages in London.
In Milan, Italy, Iranian Foreign
Minister Sadcgh Ghotbzadeh was
quoted as saying the lengthy standoff

could be settled "in an honorable and
acceptable way" once the Iranian par
liament convenes. The second round of
parliamentary voting is Friday.
There were these other develop
ments:
— Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti,
secretary of the Revolutionary Coun
cil. told reporters he expected the hos
tage debate to begin "perhaps in six
weeks." Both rejected the Thatcher
suggestion.
— A gunman ambushed the 24-
year-old son of Iran's Anglican bishop
and shot him dead, reports reaching
London said. The victim, Bahram De
ghani Tafti, an Oxford graduate, had
worked as an interpreter for foreign re
porters in Tehran. His father. Bishop
Deghani Tafti, left Iran for Cyprus
after escaping an assassination attempt
last October.
— Informed sources said an uniden
tified American woman, arrested ear
lier this week on spy charges, was trans
ferred to the custody of the Iranian
Foreign Ministry. Iranian revolutio
nary guardsmen claimed they have
documents proving the woman is a spy.
A U.S. State Department official in

Washington said the department did
not have details about the case.
— Beheshti said the Iranian gov
ernment arrested a number of Iranians
accused of being U.S. agents following
the failed U.S. rescue mission.
Tehran Radio said the latest group of
hostages moved from the embassy
were taken to the city of Gorgan. 185
miles east northeast of Tehran and only
about 20 miles from the Caspian Sea.
The embassy militants have said they
are dispersing their captives in order to
foil any new U.S. rescue attempt.
On Tuesday, militants said they sent
a group of hostages to Kerman, 550
miles southeast of Tehran. Before that,
the hostages had been reported moved
to Tabriz. Shiraz, Mahalat, Mashhad,
Jahrom, Isfahan. Najafabad, Arak,
Qom and Yazd. Some are still believed
being held in the embassy seized last
Nov. 4.
In other Iran news, in an attempt to
restore his flagging authority. Presi
dent Abolhassan Bani-Sadr yesterday
asked for — and apparently received —
from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
the power to name a new prime minis
ter now.

Bani-Sadr's unstated objective was
to name a prime minister before the
expected clerical sweep to a majority in
the parliamentary elections. The
long-delayed runoff is for the assembly
election scheduled for tomorrow.
Permission to appoint a prime minis
ter was part of a three-point package ot
requests contained in Bani-Sadr's let
ter to Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's most
powerful figure and made public by I lie
official news agency Pars. The presi
dent also spoke about the need to con
front decisively plots and incidents af
fecting the country.
On the basis of lengthy talks with the
ayatollah's son Ahmad. Bani-Sadr re
quested the following:
— Permission to appoint a prime
minister subject to the ayatollah's ap
proval.
— Guarantees that security forces
would act according to orders.
— Guarantees that the "prop
aganda"' organizations would not act
against the national interest of policy of
Iran.
With Khomeini's blessing, Bani-
Sadr apparently was counting that the
new government named by his prime
minister would win the required confi
dence vote when the new parliament
gets down to business sometime next
month despite the virtually certain cler
ical majority.
The clerical party has insisted he wait
until the parliament functions to exer
cise his authority and claimed that con
stitutionally the prime minister's job —
which it hopes to control — is more
important than the presidency.
Front-runner for the prime minis
ter's job was Adm. Admad Madani, a
tough, law-and-order advocate who
would be expected to restore efficiency
to the ranks of the demoralized armed
forces and Revolutionary Guards. Ma
dani, a former defense minister and
Navy minister who received 15 percent
of the presidential vote in January, was
received yesterday by Khomeini.
But Bani-Sadr's move was followed
by a series of confusing events, retrac
tions and clarifications that suggested
continued power struggle between the
president and his right-wing clerical ri
vals ot the Islamic Republican Pain

Symptomatic of the contusion was
Khomeini's own last-minute televised
appeal — that someone else read tor
him, prompting speculation that the
80-year-old leader is once again in
poor health — calling last night for
massive backing for religious candi
dates in Friday's'vote.
By simultaneously backing Bani-
Sadr and his clerical rivals, the ayatol
lah appeared to be inconsistent, some
thing that a confusing sequence of
events yesterday afternoon tended to
underscore.
After the publication of Bani-Sadr's
letter, Khomeini's own aides quickly
confirmed its content and the ayatol
lah's approval. Yet within a half hour.
Pars sent out a message instructing
editors to hold the original dispatch. It
gave no explanation.
Khomeini aides then promised, but
failed to produce, a statement on the
matter. Nor did they approve the lifting
of Pars' embargo on the dispatch con
cerning the prime minister, Bani-
Sadr's office, however, later approved
the release.

dent Abolhassan Bani-Sadr yesterday
asked for — and apparently received —
from Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
the power to name a new prime minis
ter now.

Bani-Sadr's unstated objective was
to name a prime minister before the
expected clerical sweep to a majority in
the parliamentary elections. The
long-delayed runoff is for the assembly
election scheduled for tomorrow.
Permission to appoint a prime minis
ter was part of a three-point package ot
requests contained in Bani-Sadr's let
ter to Ayatollah Khomeini, Iran's most
powerful figure and made public by I lie
official news agency Pars. The presi
dent also spoke about the need to con
front decisively plots and incidents af
fecting the country.
On the basis of lengthy talks with the
ayatollah's son Ahmad. Bani-Sadr re
quested the following:
— Permission to appoint a prime
minister subject to the ayatollah's ap
proval.
— Guarantees that security forces
would act according to orders.
— Guarantees that the "prop
aganda"' organizations would not act
against the national interest of policy of
Iran.
With Khomeini's blessing, Bani-
Sadr apparently was counting that the
new government named by his prime
minister would win the required confi
dence vote when the new parliament
gets down to business sometime next
month despite the virtually certain cler
ical majority.
The clerical party has insisted he wait
until the parliament functions to exer
cise his authority and claimed that con
stitutionally the prime minister's job —
which it hopes to control — is more
important than the presidency.
Front-runner for the prime minis
ter's job was Adm. Admad Madani, a
tough, law-and-order advocate who
would be expected to restore efficiency
to the ranks of the demoralized armed
forces and Revolutionary Guards. Ma
dani, a former defense minister and
Navy minister who received 15 percent
of the presidential vote in January, was
received yesterday by Khomeini.
But Bani-Sadr's move was followed
by a series of confusing events, retrac
tions and clarifications that suggested
continued power struggle between the
president and his right-wing clerical ri
vals ot the Islamic Republican Pain

Symptomatic of the contusion was
Khomeini's own last-minute televised
appeal — that someone else read tor
him, prompting speculation that the
80-year-old leader is once again in
poor health — calling last night for
massive backing for religious candi
dates in Friday's'vote.
By simultaneously backing Bani-
Sadr and his clerical rivals, the ayatol
lah appeared to be inconsistent, some
thing that a confusing sequence of
events yesterday afternoon tended to
underscore.
After the publication of Bani-Sadr's
letter, Khomeini's own aides quickly
confirmed its content and the ayatol
lah's approval. Yet within a half hour.
Pars sent out a message instructing
editors to hold the original dispatch. It
gave no explanation.
Khomeini aides then promised, but
failed to produce, a statement on the
matter. Nor did they approve the lifting
of Pars' embargo on the dispatch con
cerning the prime minister, Bani-
Sadr's office, however, later approved
the release.
From the Daily wire services
Militants were reported yesterday to
have moved a 1 2th group of American
hostages from the occupied U.S. Em
bassy in Tehran to another city. Two
Iranian leaders rejected a suggestion
by British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher that the freedom of the U.S.
prisoners could come faster because of
the commando raid freeing Iranian
hostages in London.
In Milan, Italy, Iranian Foreign
Minister Sadcgh Ghotbzadeh was
quoted as saying the lengthy standoff

could be settled "in an honorable and
acceptable way" once the Iranian par
liament convenes. The second round of
parliamentary voting is Friday.
There were these other develop
ments:
— Ayatollah Mohammad Beheshti,
secretary of the Revolutionary Coun
cil. told reporters he expected the hos
tage debate to begin "perhaps in six
weeks." Both rejected the Thatcher
suggestion.
— A gunman ambushed the 24-
year-old son of Iran's Anglican bishop
and shot him dead, reports reaching
London said. The victim, Bahram De
ghani Tafti, an Oxford graduate, had
worked as an interpreter for foreign re
porters in Tehran. His father. Bishop
Deghani Tafti, left Iran for Cyprus
after escaping an assassination attempt
last October.
— Informed sources said an uniden
tified American woman, arrested ear
lier this week on spy charges, was trans
ferred to the custody of the Iranian
Foreign Ministry. Iranian revolutio
nary guardsmen claimed they have
documents proving the woman is a spy.
A U.S. State Department official in

Washington said the department did
not have details about the case.
— Beheshti said the Iranian gov
ernment arrested a number of Iranians
accused of being U.S. agents following
the failed U.S. rescue mission.
Tehran Radio said the latest group of
hostages moved from the embassy
were taken to the city of Gorgan. 185
miles east northeast of Tehran and only
about 20 miles from the Caspian Sea.
The embassy militants have said they
are dispersing their captives in order to
foil any new U.S. rescue attempt.
On Tuesday, militants said they sent
a group of hostages to Kerman, 550
miles southeast of Tehran. Before that,
the hostages had been reported moved
to Tabriz. Shiraz, Mahalat, Mashhad,
Jahrom, Isfahan. Najafabad, Arak,
Qom and Yazd. Some are still believed
being held in the embassy seized last
Nov. 4.
