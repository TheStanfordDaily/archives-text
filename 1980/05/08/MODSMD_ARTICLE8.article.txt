# Faculty reviews Franklin penalty
## 
### Jill Liscom Staff Writer 
The University and the American
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed
opening briefs yesterday for reconsid
eration of the penalty given to former
Assoc. English Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin.
Franklin was dismissed by the Board
of Trustees in January 1972 after the
Faculty Advisory Board found him
guilty of "urging and inciting students
and others to disrupt University func
tions."
The dismissal penalty was based on
three charges of involving speeches
Franklin made at a White Plaza noon
rally, a demonstration outside the
Computation Center, and an evening
rally at the Old Union.
In January 1978 Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge John Fhalerty
ruled that Franklin was guilty on two of
the charges, but not on the Old Union
charge.
The ACLU then appealed, contest
ing Franklin's guilt on two charges and
maintaining that the University's own
rules were unconstitutionally vague.
The University cross-filed, saying
Franklin was guilty on all three

charges.
A year later, the ACLU asked for
dismissal of rjs own appeal, saying it
was premature. On Friday, Feb. 15, the
First District Court of Appeal agreed,
and now the Faculty Advisory Board
must decide if Franklin's dismissal is
still the appropriate penalty. '«
According to University Counsel
John Schwartz, legal argument will be
limited to two briefs foreach party. The
University and the ACLU have until
May 16 to file response briefs.
The ACLU had initially requested
that the board allow new testimony in
the reconsideration process, and later
requested that oral argument be heard.
The Advisory Board turned down both
requests.
The University opposed the request
for additional testimony on several
grounds, according to Schwartz. He
explained that because the board is
only considering what the penalty
should be, "the only question is what
the sanction ought to be in light of the
original evidence," and should be
"based on the record of all the hearings
at that time."
Schwartz added that the University
had "absolutely no objection" to allow

ing oral argument, but the Advisory
Board would not permit it.
Prof. William Clebsch. chairman of
the Faculty Advisory Board, would not
disclose the board's reasons for not
permitting oral argument or new tes
timony.
In a phone conversation yesterday.
Franklin charged that not allowing oral
argument is against the University's
own rules governing cases of faculty
discipline.
Franklin said his involvement in the
whole case "has never been primarily
personal," and his main reason for
wanting a more open hearing is that
"the entire community has an interest
in knowing the truth in cases like this."
Franklin also charged that the Uni
versity is "attempting to keep people
from knowing about this case and the
issues involved."
Franklin is now a tenured English
professor at Rutgers University in
Newark. New Jersey. Although his
legal suit calls for reinstatement at
Stanford and payment for damages,
Iranklin said he is more concerned
with the principle of unrestricted
speech.
"In restricting speech, the real victim
is not the person giving the speech, but
rather the people deprived of the pos
sibility of giving the speech," he said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said the University
also feels there is a very important
principle involved — that the Univer
sity may punish "a member of the fa
culty who behaves in a way that is de
structive to the rights of other members
of the institution."

Rosenzweig added that the decision
was made with "scrupulous regard" for
Franklin's rights. "We believe the right
thing was done for the right reason, and
we're prepared to do whatever is
necessary to prove that," he said.
Both Rosenzweig and Franklin said
they think it is likely the case will end
up in the state supreme court. And ac
cording to Franklin, his attorneys say it
could be another six years before a final
verdict is reached.

In January 1978 Santa Clara County
Superior Court Judge John Fhalerty
ruled that Franklin was guilty on two of
the charges, but not on the Old Union
charge.
The ACLU then appealed, contest
ing Franklin's guilt on two charges and
maintaining that the University's own
rules were unconstitutionally vague.
The University cross-filed, saying
Franklin was guilty on all three

charges.
A year later, the ACLU asked for
dismissal of rjs own appeal, saying it
was premature. On Friday, Feb. 15, the
First District Court of Appeal agreed,
and now the Faculty Advisory Board
must decide if Franklin's dismissal is
still the appropriate penalty. '«
According to University Counsel
John Schwartz, legal argument will be
limited to two briefs foreach party. The
University and the ACLU have until
May 16 to file response briefs.
The ACLU had initially requested
that the board allow new testimony in
the reconsideration process, and later
requested that oral argument be heard.
The Advisory Board turned down both
requests.
The University opposed the request
for additional testimony on several
grounds, according to Schwartz. He
explained that because the board is
only considering what the penalty
should be, "the only question is what
the sanction ought to be in light of the
original evidence," and should be
"based on the record of all the hearings
at that time."
Schwartz added that the University
had "absolutely no objection" to allow

ing oral argument, but the Advisory
Board would not permit it.
Prof. William Clebsch. chairman of
the Faculty Advisory Board, would not
disclose the board's reasons for not
permitting oral argument or new tes
timony.
In a phone conversation yesterday.
Franklin charged that not allowing oral
argument is against the University's
own rules governing cases of faculty
discipline.
Franklin said his involvement in the
whole case "has never been primarily
personal," and his main reason for
wanting a more open hearing is that
"the entire community has an interest
in knowing the truth in cases like this."
Franklin also charged that the Uni
versity is "attempting to keep people
from knowing about this case and the
issues involved."
Franklin is now a tenured English
professor at Rutgers University in
Newark. New Jersey. Although his
legal suit calls for reinstatement at
Stanford and payment for damages,
Iranklin said he is more concerned
with the principle of unrestricted
speech.
"In restricting speech, the real victim
is not the person giving the speech, but
rather the people deprived of the pos
sibility of giving the speech," he said.
Robert Rosenzweig, vice president
for public affairs, said the University
also feels there is a very important
principle involved — that the Univer
sity may punish "a member of the fa
culty who behaves in a way that is de
structive to the rights of other members
of the institution."

Rosenzweig added that the decision
was made with "scrupulous regard" for
Franklin's rights. "We believe the right
thing was done for the right reason, and
we're prepared to do whatever is
necessary to prove that," he said.
Both Rosenzweig and Franklin said
they think it is likely the case will end
up in the state supreme court. And ac
cording to Franklin, his attorneys say it
could be another six years before a final
verdict is reached.
