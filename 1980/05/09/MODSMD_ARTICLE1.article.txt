# Rubin recalls tumult of ' 60s protest
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
Jerry Rubin brought alive some of
the colorful moments of the '60s in
Kresge Auditorium last night.
Speaking under the heading of "20
Years of Change," Rubin discussed the
past two decades and made some pre
dictions about the '80s.
"I'm psychic when it comes to pre
dicting decades," Rubin told the audi
ence of 200. "I predicted the outcome
of the '60s in 1963,1 started jogging in
1970 and now I think I have a psychic
understanding of the '80s."
Rubin not only predicted the '60s, he
had a major part in making the'6os the
radical, activist era that it was.
A party leader of the American
Youth International Party (the Yip
pies), Rubin is remembered for his par
ticipation in the controversial de
monstrations at the 1968 Democratic
Convention in Chicago, which resulted
in armed conflict between police and
the crowd.
Chicago
After the demonstrations, Rubin
and six other activists were charged
with crossing state lines with intent to
incite a riot and became involved in the
famous Chicago 7 trial.
Looking back to the night of that
riot, Rubin called it a turning point for
the American people.
"That night, people saw reality and
innocence died," Rubin said. "The
television cameras in the convention
hall left (Vice President Hubert) Hum
phrey and came out onto Michigan Av
enue and showed the public all the tear
gas and the clubbing. Suddenly, con
frontation became the name of the
day."
Teaching parents
From that point on, Rubin said,
young people were teaching values to
their parents.
During the lengthy trial that fol
lowed Rubin's arrest, the activist said
he and his colleagues decided that they
actually wanted to be found guilty, be
cause history only remembers the
guilty.
"We also decided that we wanted to
give our judge a heart attack," Rubin
said with a smile.
One of their attempts to bring on
cardiac arrest saw Rubin and his co
defendent, Abbie Hoffman, entering
the courtroom in judge's robes.
Power from clothes
"We decided that the way you dress
determines where you get power in this
