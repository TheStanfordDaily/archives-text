# U.S. ignores laws of diplomatic courtesy
## 
### Norman Kempster The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON — Looking a bit pained by it all,
a State Department official reflected on the erosion
of the once in\ iolate laws of diplomatic courtesy. "It
is unheard of for representatives of a foreign govern
ment who are told they are not welcome . . .to remain
in their diplomatic establishment." he said.
Unheard of or not, eight blocks away from the
State Department, four low-level members of the
diplomatic mission of Libya were holed up Wednes
day in that radical Arab nation's once elegant em
bassy. refusing to obey a U.S. government order to go
home.
The four were declared "unacceptable" last Friday
because, the State Department charged, they were
conducting a campaign of harassment and intimida
tion against Libyans living in the United States who
were considered insufficiently revolutionary in their
support of the country's strongman. Moammar Ka
dafy.
Physical liquidation threat
The State Department said many of the 3000 to
4000 Libyan students in the United States have re
ceived a message threatening "physical liquidation"
of those who opposed Kadafv's plans for the North
African country's future. An American official said
the FBI had convincing evidence linking the four
expelled diplomats to the distribution of the threat.
Two other diplomats were expelled last month on
the same charge of intimidating Libyans living in the
United States. The first two left as ordered, but the
other four refused, vowing to remain in the embassy

for an "indefinite period."
Ali Houderi. chief of the Libyan diplomatic mis
sion. denied the U.S. charges of harassment. He also
said the four were not really diplomats at all and, as
far as he was concerned, police could arrest them if
they had committed a crime.
No violations intended
But to do that, the police would have to enter the
embassy, which international law forbids them to do.
"We have made it clear we have no intention of
violating a diplomatic establishment," said a State
Department official who talked to a group of repor
ters with the understanding that hg would not be
identified.
As armed FBI agents surrounded the embassy,
waiting to pounce on any of the four who might
venture outside, the story began to resemble the plot
of a Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. According to the
Libyans, Kadafy's country has a
jamahiriyah — an Arabic word that means masses —
instead of a government. Therefore, it has no em
bassy (Libyans call it a People's Bureau) and, there
fore, no diplomats.
Diplomatic expulsion
If the Libyan representatives in the United States
are not diplomats, they are not subject to diplomatic
expulsion. And, if the four individuals that
Washington wants to send home are not subject to
expulsion, they could be deported only after a com
plex procedure that could take months or even years.
From the U.S. viewpoint, this is all most awkward.
The State Department contends that everyone work
ing in an embassy. People's Bureau or whatever a

country might want to call it, is functioning as a dip
lomat. If they do diplomatic work, one official said,
they are entitled to diplomatic immunities and
privileges, and they must meet diplomatic obliga
tions.
At any other time, the U.S. government might be
tempted to take the Libyans at their word and send a
police squad into the embassy to arrest the four. But
especially with Washington trying to round up sup
port for economic and political sanctions against Iran
for seizing the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, the State
Department is not about to authorize an assault on
the Libyan Embassy.
Comic opera
All of which leaves the four Libyans — Moham
med Tarek Gammudi, Ali Mohammed Ramram,
Abdalla Abedi and Nuri Ahmed Swedan — inside
the embassy and U.S. officials outside.
The comic-opera aspects of the standoff obscure
what U.S. officials consider a real threat of violence
against Libyan dissidents in the United States. Four
Libyans already have been killed in Europe under
circumstances that point to Libyan assassins.
There has been no similar violence in the United
States, but Tripoli radio quoted Kadafy last week as
saying that dissidents must return immediately to
Libya.
According to the broadcast, Kadafy said: "They
can either have safety in the jamahiriyah or face
liquidation wherever they may be. Anyone who re
turns will be safe, but he who does not return will
have only himself to blame."
