# German Jews find unlikely refuge in Dominican Republic village
## 
### Charles Hillinger The Los Angeles Times 
SOSUA, Dominican Republic— Forty
years ago this village was founded by
Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.
It was one ot the strangest migrations of
World War 11, yet to this day the thriving
Jewish settlement of Sosua (So-SOO-a) is
little known outside the Dominican Re
public.
"Only one nation in the world officially
opened its doors to the Jews during Hi
tler's genocide — the Dominican Repub
lic." Martin Katz, one of the founders of
the community, recalled.
Strangely. Katz said, "It was the
Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas
Trujillo who established a haven here for
the European victims of racial hatred."
Said 74-year-old Erich Benjamin:
"Sosua was an escape valve, a life
saving colony. People here still speak
warmly of Trujillo."
The Dominican dictator's humanita
rian act was ironic. In 1937, three years
before he welcomed the Jews, Trujillo's
troops are reported to have massacred
thousands of black Haitians.
Haiti, a densely populated black nation
and the poorest in the Western hemis
phere. occupies one-third of Hispaniola,
an island 460 miles long and 200 miles
wide. The Dominican Republic occupies
the other two-thirds.
"When I was in high school studying

Dominican history, our history book told
how Trujillo killed 30,000 Haitians in a
matter of weeks in 1937," said Jeanette
Benjamin Estrella, 37, daughter of Ger
man Jewish immigrants and lifelong resi
dent of Sosua. She is married to a
Dominican.
Her history textbook told of a flood of
starving Haitians crossing illegally into
the Dominican Republic seeking food
and jobs during the 19305.
"We were taught that in 1937 Trujillo
started a number of Spanish colonies. He
wanted to fill his country with as many
white Europeans as possible. Then he in
vited the Jewish refugees to come here."
Members of the Jewish colony said that
while that was a factor, Trujillo also
wanted to improve his image on the world
scene and believed that being the only
nation to officially welcome Jewish re
fugees from Nazi Germany would help.
Trujillo said at the time that he hoped
100,000 German Jews would settle in his
island nation and guaranteed them free
dom of religion as well as equal opportun
ity "to stimulate the progress of our na
tion."
However, only 2000 German Jews
migrated to the Dominican Republic.
"It was not easy for the Jews to get
here; that's why more did not come,"
Otto Kibel, 70, said. "Those that did
come, came here for a new lease on life.
"Most of the Jews who came were city
dwellers, even though this was a farming

community in a primitive area in the
tropics. So many used this as a stopping
over point en route to somewhere else."
"The majority were hoping to get into
the United States," Erich Benjamin said.
"But the U.S. had a quota system, and it
meant waiting for years to get in.
"The U.S. wasn't opening its doors for
anybody during World War 11. America
did a lot of talking about how it wanted to
help the Jews. But it was humanitarianism
by mouth, not by deed.
"Some of the Jews, after staying here a
few months, managed to make it to
Mexico, Central and South America.
Some moved to Santiago and Santo
Domingo and other cities in the Domini
can Republic." Only 800 stayed on in
Sosua.
Those who did settled on 30,000 acres
sold by Trujillo to an American Jewish
committee in New York City. The organi
zation paid $ 100,000 for the land 16 miles
from the north coast of Puerto Plata. The
land was formerly a United Fruit Co.
banana plantation but had been aban
doned in 1916.
"We were not farmers. We were
storekeepers, doctors, lawyers, teachers,
tradesmen," Benjamin said. "I myself
was a carpenter, as was my father, my
grandfather and several generations be
fore that.
"But those of us who stayed became
good farmers. It was tough at first. But we
made a go of it."

vited the Jewish refugees to come here."
Members of the Jewish colony said that
while that was a factor, Trujillo also
wanted to improve his image on the world
scene and believed that being the only
nation to officially welcome Jewish re
fugees from Nazi Germany would help.
Trujillo said at the time that he hoped
100,000 German Jews would settle in his
island nation and guaranteed them free
dom of religion as well as equal opportun
ity "to stimulate the progress of our na
tion."
However, only 2000 German Jews
migrated to the Dominican Republic.
"It was not easy for the Jews to get
here; that's why more did not come,"
Otto Kibel, 70, said. "Those that did
come, came here for a new lease on life.
"Most of the Jews who came were city
dwellers, even though this was a farming

community in a primitive area in the
tropics. So many used this as a stopping
over point en route to somewhere else."
"The majority were hoping to get into
the United States," Erich Benjamin said.
"But the U.S. had a quota system, and it
meant waiting for years to get in.
"The U.S. wasn't opening its doors for
anybody during World War 11. America
did a lot of talking about how it wanted to
help the Jews. But it was humanitarianism
by mouth, not by deed.
"Some of the Jews, after staying here a
few months, managed to make it to
Mexico, Central and South America.
Some moved to Santiago and Santo
Domingo and other cities in the Domini
can Republic." Only 800 stayed on in
Sosua.
Those who did settled on 30,000 acres
sold by Trujillo to an American Jewish
committee in New York City. The organi
zation paid $ 100,000 for the land 16 miles
from the north coast of Puerto Plata. The
land was formerly a United Fruit Co.
banana plantation but had been aban
doned in 1916.
"We were not farmers. We were
storekeepers, doctors, lawyers, teachers,
tradesmen," Benjamin said. "I myself
was a carpenter, as was my father, my
grandfather and several generations be
fore that.
"But those of us who stayed became
good farmers. It was tough at first. But we
made a go of it."
SOSUA, Dominican Republic— Forty
years ago this village was founded by
Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.
It was one ot the strangest migrations of
World War 11, yet to this day the thriving
Jewish settlement of Sosua (So-SOO-a) is
little known outside the Dominican Re
public.
"Only one nation in the world officially
opened its doors to the Jews during Hi
tler's genocide — the Dominican Repub
lic." Martin Katz, one of the founders of
the community, recalled.
Strangely. Katz said, "It was the
Dominican dictator Rafael Leonidas
Trujillo who established a haven here for
the European victims of racial hatred."
Said 74-year-old Erich Benjamin:
"Sosua was an escape valve, a life
saving colony. People here still speak
warmly of Trujillo."
The Dominican dictator's humanita
rian act was ironic. In 1937, three years
before he welcomed the Jews, Trujillo's
troops are reported to have massacred
thousands of black Haitians.
Haiti, a densely populated black nation
and the poorest in the Western hemis
phere. occupies one-third of Hispaniola,
an island 460 miles long and 200 miles
wide. The Dominican Republic occupies
the other two-thirds.
"When I was in high school studying

Dominican history, our history book told
how Trujillo killed 30,000 Haitians in a
matter of weeks in 1937," said Jeanette
Benjamin Estrella, 37, daughter of Ger
man Jewish immigrants and lifelong resi
dent of Sosua. She is married to a
Dominican.
Her history textbook told of a flood of
starving Haitians crossing illegally into
the Dominican Republic seeking food
and jobs during the 19305.
"We were taught that in 1937 Trujillo
started a number of Spanish colonies. He
wanted to fill his country with as many
white Europeans as possible. Then he in
vited the Jewish refugees to come here."
Members of the Jewish colony said that
while that was a factor, Trujillo also
wanted to improve his image on the world
scene and believed that being the only
nation to officially welcome Jewish re
fugees from Nazi Germany would help.
