# Cuban exodus to U.S.
## Refugees pose global problem 
### Robert C. Toth The Los Angeles Times 
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica —
"Castro has turned his embar
rassment into our problem." an
American diplomat said Wed
nesday on the eve of a multina
tional meeting here on the
Cuban exodus of refugees to the
United States.
"We must internationalize the
problem now. get recognition
that the refugees are an interna
tional problem, as Indochinese
refugees are, and also get com
mitments if we can from Latin
American countries to resettle
many of the 20,000 Cubans now
in south Florida," he added.

The U.S. delegation, headed
by William Bowdler, an assistant
secretary of state, will seek to
switch the focus of publicity from
Miami to Havana, possibly by
proposing that the meeting call
upon Cuban President Fidel Cas
tro to accept a delegation to dis
cuss more humanitarian treat
ment for those still in Cuba who
are seeking to emigrate.
Seeking financial aid
The United States will also
seek financial commitments
from some nations, partly to de
fray costs that may top $ 100 mill
ion. but also as a measure of sup
port for the resettlement effort
from European countries who

may not themselves take any
Cubans.
The cost of resettlement will
run between $1000 and $3000
per refugee, according to Frank
Loy, deputy coordinator of re
fugee programs, who is part of
the U.S. delegation here.
"1 cannot see the cost of the
Cuban refugee resettlement
running less than $100 million a
year," Loy said.
More than 20,000 Cubans ar
rived in Florida in a two-week
period, which, if continued,
would add up to an annual rate of
500,000. Loy's $ 1 (X) million cost
estimate was based on an antici
pated emigration rate of 100,000
Cubans this year. Estimates of
up to 250,000 have been men
tioned by Cuban emigrees
Optimistic expectations
American expectations of how
this meeting of approximately 15
Latin American and European
nations will deal with the refugee
problem may be optimistic. And
the expectations are not likely to
be realized quickly. The confer
ence will be more in the nature of
an emergency organizing session
than one at which substantive,
long-term programs are decided
and put into motion.
A measure of the ad hoc na
ture of the meeting was con
tained in the fact that neither a
full list of the participating na
tions nor the length of the meet
ing could be determined Wed
nesday.
Just a month ago, when
10,800 Cubans stormed into the
Peruvian Embassy in Havana
seeking asylum, Castro appeared
to have suffered a severe blow to
his prestige in Latin America and
elsewhere in the Third World
bloc, which he aspires to lead.
U.S. offers to resettle 3500
The United States offered to
resettle 3500 of those Cubans,
while other Latin nations offered
to take another 3000.
In his initial polemics, Castro
called Peru, Venezuela and
other Latin nations henchmen of

the United States for supporting
the emigration aims of those in
the Peruvian compound. But he
agreed they could leave by airlift
to Costa Rica as a staging point
for wherever they went later.
Then he reversed himself. He
ordered that the refugees could
only go directly to the nation in
which they would permanently
resettle.
When Costa Rican President
Rodrigo Carazo promised
could all settle here, Castro said
Carazo must promise they could
not leave later. Carazo replied
that his country, considered the
most democratic of the Latin
American states, could not pre
vent anyone from emigrating.
Port opened to U.S.
At the same time, Castro
opened the Cuban port of Mariel
opposite Key West, Fla., to
American small craft so they
could take refugees by danger
ous sea voyage to the United
States. That started the largest
flood of refugees the Western
Hemisphere has seen since the
last time Castro allowed disaf
fected Cubans to emigrate. More
than 260,000 left between 1965
and 1973, most of them going to
the United States.
The sudden rush now has
clearly overtaxed Florida
facilities and created a backlash
that risks racial violence there, as
well as political damage to Presi
dent Carter in this election year.
The Florida congressional de
legation that met with Carter on
Tuesday left no doubt that, as
Rep. Dante Fascell (D-Fla.)
later said, "There is no way south
Florida can take all those people.
Less sophisticated
Less sophisticated in their op
position were Floridians who
marched and attended meetings
in Miami at which speakers
warned of increased crime and
violence, loss of jobs to refugees,
increased burdens on welfare
rolls and schools. "Enough is
enough," proclaimed one ban
ner Tuesday night.

500,000. Loy's $ 1 (X) million cost
estimate was based on an antici
pated emigration rate of 100,000
Cubans this year. Estimates of
up to 250,000 have been men
tioned by Cuban emigrees
Optimistic expectations
American expectations of how
this meeting of approximately 15
Latin American and European
nations will deal with the refugee
problem may be optimistic. And
the expectations are not likely to
be realized quickly. The confer
ence will be more in the nature of
an emergency organizing session
than one at which substantive,
long-term programs are decided
and put into motion.
A measure of the ad hoc na
ture of the meeting was con
tained in the fact that neither a
full list of the participating na
tions nor the length of the meet
ing could be determined Wed
nesday.
Just a month ago, when
10,800 Cubans stormed into the
Peruvian Embassy in Havana
seeking asylum, Castro appeared
to have suffered a severe blow to
his prestige in Latin America and
elsewhere in the Third World
bloc, which he aspires to lead.
U.S. offers to resettle 3500
The United States offered to
resettle 3500 of those Cubans,
while other Latin nations offered
to take another 3000.
In his initial polemics, Castro
called Peru, Venezuela and
other Latin nations henchmen of

the United States for supporting
the emigration aims of those in
the Peruvian compound. But he
agreed they could leave by airlift
to Costa Rica as a staging point
for wherever they went later.
Then he reversed himself. He
ordered that the refugees could
only go directly to the nation in
which they would permanently
resettle.
When Costa Rican President
Rodrigo Carazo promised
could all settle here, Castro said
Carazo must promise they could
not leave later. Carazo replied
that his country, considered the
most democratic of the Latin
American states, could not pre
vent anyone from emigrating.
Port opened to U.S.
At the same time, Castro
opened the Cuban port of Mariel
opposite Key West, Fla., to
American small craft so they
could take refugees by danger
ous sea voyage to the United
States. That started the largest
flood of refugees the Western
Hemisphere has seen since the
last time Castro allowed disaf
fected Cubans to emigrate. More
than 260,000 left between 1965
and 1973, most of them going to
the United States.
The sudden rush now has
clearly overtaxed Florida
facilities and created a backlash
that risks racial violence there, as
well as political damage to Presi
dent Carter in this election year.
The Florida congressional de
legation that met with Carter on
Tuesday left no doubt that, as
Rep. Dante Fascell (D-Fla.)
later said, "There is no way south
Florida can take all those people.
Less sophisticated
Less sophisticated in their op
position were Floridians who
marched and attended meetings
in Miami at which speakers
warned of increased crime and
violence, loss of jobs to refugees,
increased burdens on welfare
rolls and schools. "Enough is
enough," proclaimed one ban
ner Tuesday night.
SAN JOSE, Costa Rica —
"Castro has turned his embar
rassment into our problem." an
American diplomat said Wed
nesday on the eve of a multina
tional meeting here on the
Cuban exodus of refugees to the
United States.
"We must internationalize the
problem now. get recognition
that the refugees are an interna
tional problem, as Indochinese
refugees are, and also get com
mitments if we can from Latin
American countries to resettle
many of the 20,000 Cubans now
in south Florida," he added.

The U.S. delegation, headed
by William Bowdler, an assistant
secretary of state, will seek to
switch the focus of publicity from
Miami to Havana, possibly by
proposing that the meeting call
upon Cuban President Fidel Cas
tro to accept a delegation to dis
cuss more humanitarian treat
ment for those still in Cuba who
are seeking to emigrate.
Seeking financial aid
The United States will also
seek financial commitments
from some nations, partly to de
fray costs that may top $ 100 mill
ion. but also as a measure of sup
port for the resettlement effort
from European countries who

may not themselves take any
Cubans.
The cost of resettlement will
run between $1000 and $3000
per refugee, according to Frank
Loy, deputy coordinator of re
fugee programs, who is part of
the U.S. delegation here.
"1 cannot see the cost of the
Cuban refugee resettlement
running less than $100 million a
year," Loy said.
More than 20,000 Cubans ar
rived in Florida in a two-week
period, which, if continued,
would add up to an annual rate of
500,000. Loy's $ 1 (X) million cost
estimate was based on an antici
pated emigration rate of 100,000
