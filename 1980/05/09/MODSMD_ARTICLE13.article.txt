Dear Bug Me:
Recently I Jiled an application for a federally
insured student loan. The loan was granted, but /
was amazed how many steps were involved in the
review process. People at Stanford, at the bank,
in the state government and in Washington,
D.C., got involved. Can you get an estimate of
exactly how many individuals saw my applica
tion?

Let me first' Outline -the normal channels a
loan application goes through. An applicant will
pick up the necessary forms from Stanford, fill
them out,and turn them in. Then, according to
Debbie Leong-Child, financial aids assistant
here, the University checks to be certain the
student is eligible, making sure other loans and
fellowships haven't already covered the stu
dent's needs.
The forms are then sent on to the the bank of
the student's choice, where they are reviewed
before going to a guaranteeing agency. If it is an
application for a federally-insured loan, accord
ing to a Bank of America spokesperson, it goes
to the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. If state-insured, it goes to a central
clearing agency in Indianapolis, Ind.
Once guaranteed, the application returns to
the bank and a check is issued. The check is then
usually sent to the University, Leong-Childs
said, and then passed on to the student.
Wheh! As for the number of individuals, it
varies with each application. Let's just say at
least two people will see the application here,
one at the bank, and at the government level. . .
who' knows?
I his process can take anywhere from five to
I 1 weeks, Leong-Childs said, depending on the
volume of loans being processed at the time.
Dear Bug,
How many trees does it take to produce one
box of computer paper? A nd how many pages of
computer paper can be printed per tree?
-J.H.
I can't really give you a direct answer on that
because of the nature of computer paper.

The paper used here, as is the case with just
about all paper, is made from wood pulp and
chemicals. The wood pulp is made from chips of
wood which are by-products of lumber mills. So
a direct paper-to-tree comparison is very dif
ficult, especially since trees vary in size.
As far as gross quantity of paper is concerned,
I can tell you how much is used in various de
partments around campus. The Computer Sci
ence Department, according to Computer
Facilities Director Ralph Gorin, uses about two
boxes of the perforated line-printer paper a day,
or about 730 boxes a year. Each box has 40
pounds of paper. That comes out to be 15 tons
of tree per year.
The LOTS computer facilities, according to
Administrative Assistant Quennette Baur, uses
an average of three and a half boxes per day.
That's 3,640,000 sheets of paper per year.
When divided by the 4000 accounts LOTS has
at any time, this is 910 sheets of paper per
person per year.
Bug Me,
What happened to the mailbox that used to be
in front of Lagunita ?
- C.B.
That mailbox, and several others around
campus, have been removed because of rising
energy prices! Ron Sodlink, manager of the
Stanford Post Office, said that the Postal Ser
vice has been removing mail collection boxes
from low-use areas around the country in an
effort to conserve gas and time.
Sodlink said that boxes were originally placed
all over campus for convenience, but that during
the last year the Post Office has removed many
of them, including the box which used to be near
Lagunita.
There remain about a half-dozen mailboxes
on campus-proper now, according to Sodlink,
and another six in the residential areas of the
University.

That will have to do it for today. See you next
Friday for more wonderful trivia. I'm still at the
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, CA, 94305, and probably always will
be.

As far as gross quantity of paper is concerned,
I can tell you how much is used in various de
partments around campus. The Computer Sci
ence Department, according to Computer
Facilities Director Ralph Gorin, uses about two
boxes of the perforated line-printer paper a day,
or about 730 boxes a year. Each box has 40
pounds of paper. That comes out to be 15 tons
of tree per year.
The LOTS computer facilities, according to
Administrative Assistant Quennette Baur, uses
an average of three and a half boxes per day.
That's 3,640,000 sheets of paper per year.
When divided by the 4000 accounts LOTS has
at any time, this is 910 sheets of paper per
person per year.
Bug Me,
What happened to the mailbox that used to be
in front of Lagunita ?
- C.B.
That mailbox, and several others around
campus, have been removed because of rising
energy prices! Ron Sodlink, manager of the
Stanford Post Office, said that the Postal Ser
vice has been removing mail collection boxes
from low-use areas around the country in an
effort to conserve gas and time.
Sodlink said that boxes were originally placed
all over campus for convenience, but that during
the last year the Post Office has removed many
of them, including the box which used to be near
Lagunita.
There remain about a half-dozen mailboxes
on campus-proper now, according to Sodlink,
and another six in the residential areas of the
University.

That will have to do it for today. See you next
Friday for more wonderful trivia. I'm still at the
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, CA, 94305, and probably always will
be.

Well, it's not such a bad time of year after all,
is it? Good weather, good friends, good news
and lots of questions to answer.
Dear Bug Me:
Recently I Jiled an application for a federally
insured student loan. The loan was granted, but /
was amazed how many steps were involved in the
review process. People at Stanford, at the bank,
in the state government and in Washington,
D.C., got involved. Can you get an estimate of
exactly how many individuals saw my applica
tion?
- Anonymous
Let me first' Outline -the normal channels a
loan application goes through. An applicant will
pick up the necessary forms from Stanford, fill
them out,and turn them in. Then, according to
Debbie Leong-Child, financial aids assistant
here, the University checks to be certain the
student is eligible, making sure other loans and
fellowships haven't already covered the stu
dent's needs.
The forms are then sent on to the the bank of
the student's choice, where they are reviewed
before going to a guaranteeing agency. If it is an
application for a federally-insured loan, accord
ing to a Bank of America spokesperson, it goes
to the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. If state-insured, it goes to a central
clearing agency in Indianapolis, Ind.
Once guaranteed, the application returns to
the bank and a check is issued. The check is then
usually sent to the University, Leong-Childs
said, and then passed on to the student.
Wheh! As for the number of individuals, it
varies with each application. Let's just say at
least two people will see the application here,
one at the bank, and at the government level. . .
who' knows?
I his process can take anywhere from five to
I 1 weeks, Leong-Childs said, depending on the
volume of loans being processed at the time.
Dear Bug,
How many trees does it take to produce one
box of computer paper? A nd how many pages of
computer paper can be printed per tree?
-J.H.
I can't really give you a direct answer on that
because of the nature of computer paper.

The paper used here, as is the case with just
about all paper, is made from wood pulp and
chemicals. The wood pulp is made from chips of
wood which are by-products of lumber mills. So
a direct paper-to-tree comparison is very dif
ficult, especially since trees vary in size.
As far as gross quantity of paper is concerned,
I can tell you how much is used in various de
partments around campus. The Computer Sci
ence Department, according to Computer
Facilities Director Ralph Gorin, uses about two
boxes of the perforated line-printer paper a day,
or about 730 boxes a year. Each box has 40
pounds of paper. That comes out to be 15 tons
