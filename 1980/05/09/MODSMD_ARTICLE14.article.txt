# 12 Congressmen issue warning
## Prop. 9 could cut off state's fed funds 
### Robert Rosenblatt The Los Angeles Times 
WASHINGTON â€” Califor
nia could lose $2.3 billion in fed
eral funds if Proposition 9, Jarvis
11, is approved and forces a re
duction in state and local spend
ing for major welfare and educa
tion programs, 12 of the state's
Democratic congressmen
warned Wednesday.
A report issued by the con
gressmen said federal participa
tion in the following programs
would be jeopardized: Medicaid,
which pays medical bills for poor
people; school lunch and break
fast programs; and the distribu
tion of extra money to schools in
poor neighborhoods.
Prop. 9 is a ballot initiative
providing for a 50 percent reduc
tion in state income tax rates. If
approved by California voters
June 3, it would cut state tax re
venues by $4.9 billion this year.
With the resulting revenue
losses, local governments pre
sumably would be forced to
make drastic budget cuts.
Eleven different programs, in
cluding Medicaid, have
"maintenance of effort" rules.
That is, Washington automati
cally cuts oft funds if state or
local governments reduce their
spending for these programs.
The rules were written into the
federal law to prevent states
from substituting federal funds
for state money.
For example, California
spends about $1 billion a year on
schooling for handicapped chil
dren. Washington contributes
$72.4 million to this effort. If
California reduced its outlays by
a single dollar, all of the $72.4
million from Washington would
be withheld.
The state is receiving $2,356
billion in the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30 under laws that forbid
any reduction in state or local
contributions.
If Prop. 9 passes, the loss of

federal funds will depend on
where state and local officials
decide to make budget cuts.
California receives $7.92 hill
ion a year from the federal gov
ernment under programs requir
ing some state or local participa
tion, according to a General Ac
counting Office study conducted
for the congressmen and re
leased Wednesday. The ones

most seriously threatened are
those that forbid any cutback in
local contributions.
Other activities, such as in
terstate highway funding, will
suffer a proportionate cut in the
flow of federal cash, rather than
a total loss, if Prop. 9 passes.
A large state surplus of funds
was available when Proposition
13, approved in June 197 X, cut

property taxes by $X 7 billion.
This enabled state and local au
thorities to keep up their spend
ing levels, ensuring the con
tinued flow of money from
Washington for joint programs.
The surplus is much smaller
now and would be outweighed
by the loss of revenues, under
Prop. 9.
