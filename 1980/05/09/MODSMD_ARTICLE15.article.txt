# ON CALL

### 
My few friends who are sentient during the
daylight hours inform me that Stanford has
been graced with the sun's presence the past few
weeks. I've also heard strange rumblings about
a stampede known as the Bay to Breakers (Is
that referring to broken limbs?), as well as a
picnic called the Health Run. So, putting a few
equations together and, naturally, being unable
to solve the system, I decided to let my readers
bring you some physical fitness-related ques
tions.
As a novice runner, I'd like to know how
important it is to warm up before striding out.
Also, will I injure myself by running on con
crete? IJ / do sustain any injuries due to running,
how long should I refrain from running?

Ken Morgan, the physical therapist at Cow
ell, said that running is a very individual activity
and should he handled in an individualized
manner. He still had a few general comments to
offer.
First off, it is very important to warm up and
stretch out before running. Track enthusiasts
further advocate a thorough warm-down, con
sisting of the same types of stretching exercises,
too.
Running on concrete is not recommended,
particularly if you already have any kind of leg

or back problems. Morgan compared it to play
ing basketball on a concrete, rather rather than
wood, floor.
If you insist on running on concrete to train
for road races or for whatever reason, asphalt is
softer and less damaging than sidewalk.
Your last question is impossible to answer,
Morgan said. It depends upon the injury sus
tained and upon you.
I've read that lifting weights can help women to
lose weight and trim their bodies. How should /
start weight training and avoid putting on a lot of
bulky muscle?

Morgan said that the best way to embark
upon a weight program, unless you're on a var
sity team, is to go slowly. Stretch before and
after lifting and work on fluid, full-motion exer
cises. Alternate between endurance and
strength exercises, originally concentrating
mainly onendurance.and light lifting. Flexibility
is important.
I would highly recommend that you have an
experienced lifter show you around the weight
room and teach you how to use the equipment
and how to properly care for your body and for
the weights.
Happy sweating!
