# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Editorial Shockley a publicity hound 
### 
William Shockley, emeritus professor of
electrical engineering, Nobel Prize
laureate for his pioneering work on the
transistor, and self-appointed geneticist,
has recently reappeared in national head
lines. His return to the media limelight is
not attributable to any stunning break
through in modern scientific research nor
to a brilliant, new hypothesis. Rather, it is
solely indicative of his ability to manipulate
the press and the public into spreading his
anachronistic and bigoted ideas.
Shockley has long appreciated the value
of controversiality in our society. Quiet
logic and conventional reasoning do not
attract widespread attention. Heated
rhetoric and outlandish assertions do.
Shockev is one person whose pro
vocative attack on dysgenics. the perpetua
tion of'inferior* genetic traits, in the pur
ported interest of bettering society, has
raised academic eyebrows and outraged
members of liberal circles. But. in earning
him vast notoriety, it has pushed his name
to the forefront of major publications and
disseminated his viewpoints on a broad
basis.
We are skeptical of the validity of
Shockley's contention that blacks are
genetically inferior to whites. We question

his methods of determining "intelligence,"
and we refuse to agree with his tacit as
sumption that this "intelligence" is the
most desireable attribute for all human be
ings.
In our view, any person who unflinch
ingly designates whites as thinkers and
blacks as basketball players could be fairly
termed a racist. Such a statement by
Shockley makes us wonder about the true
motives of his genetic research.
Shockley's recent press ploy — his dona
tion to and support of Robert Graham's
elite Repository for Germinal Control —
is, we believe, just another promotion of
his racist ideology. He has clearly
capitalized on this latest pretense to un
equivocably thrust his genetic theories into
the public realm.
For example, Shockley was provided
with the perfect opportunity to air his opin
ions on last week's Campus Conference.
He lept at the chance, to the point of com
pletely controlling the interview and the
reporters by modifying the usual program
format.
Shockley should know that the time for
this kind of racist jargon is long past. Soon,
people will all tire of his dated, uncons
cionable views.
