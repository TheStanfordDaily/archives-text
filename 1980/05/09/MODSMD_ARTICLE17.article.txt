## Try ASSU election draw 
### 
' Not only am I an enthusiastic
supporter of the Draw system. I
"believe its principles should be
applied to reform campus elec
tions. Random selection from a
field of qualified candidates
would give a truly fair and mean
ingful character to our now
floundering plebescite and
would realize a genuine rep
resentative cross-section of the
student body.
Before we bag the college
electoral process, we must weigh
its benefits and shortcomings.
Sure it provides a sketchy
semblance of democracy, but its
deficiencies include a patheti
cally low turnout, costly cam
paigning and tallying rituals, and
susceptibility to rank abuse by
pranksters.
As an alternative, selection of
our student officers by draw
would be a more efficient and
more effective means of select
ing a diverse and representative
bunch of officers.
A wide open field in which
anyone could "run" for office
could feasibly involve more stu
dents as candidates than the elec
tions could muster as voters.
The system would be open to
many eminently qualified candi
dates who have great things to
offer but were formerly discour
aged from running by campaign
rituals. The exclusive and distant
aura of ASSU would change,
since the actual seats of power
would be within anyone's grasp.
Campus politics and issues
would be more interesting and
accessible to all.
In order to weed out those un
committed or lethargic candi
dates only casually interested in
the job, we could establish a sys
tem of priorities based on de
monstrated involvement with

campus activities and commun
ity service.
Instead of relying principally
on nominal achievements such as
"Manager of Larkin 1M coed
pickleball team," priorities could
be awarded for performing
specific tasks. For example, ac
tivities such as writing incendiary
letters to the Daily or attending
every dorm dramatic production
on campus for a month could
earn anyone some degree of
priority.
This may even inspire a tem
porary onslaught of campus ac
tivities as students scramble for
priority prior to elections.
A controversy surrounding re
turning presidents priority is
bound to arise wherein we must
weigh the relative benefits of job
experience and greater access to
offices, but this dilemma can be
fairly resolved, perhaps by Hip
ping a coin.
Finally, by blatantly emerging
as a process of pure chance, the
selection process would lose its
image as a trivial farce, and actu
ally increase its integrity.
For those who take these elec
tions seriously, the possibility of
having some platform of radical
goof-offs squeak out a majority
of the electorate would be
greatly reduced.
On the other hand, those who
are put oft by pompous politicos
parading their lofty qualifica
tions and aspirations in hopes of
accumulating more bombast for
their resumes could rest assured
that such bumblers have no grea
ter chance of coming to power
than do they.
Furthermore, the campus
would be spared the pesky
plethora of pleading propaganda
promising progressive politics
presently plastered all over the
halls, walls and stalls of our living

area.
Instead, for informational
purposes, some committee could
publish a set of election pam
phlets (or. more adequately,
notecards) designating the vari
ous positions and responsibilities
available and the priorities
necessary for drawing each of
fice.
Just as in the campus housing
dilemma, we are faced with
many more worthy and qualified
applicants than there are spaces
available. The system we have,
under the pretext of democracy,
is truly wasteful and ineffective;
far better to replace it with the
draw system until such time as
we can provide governmental of
fices for all those who seek them.
Instead of being screwed by
the Draw, we can turn around
and make the system work for us.
This is the real key to a greater
campus community.

would be a more efficient and
more effective means of select
ing a diverse and representative
bunch of officers.
A wide open field in which
anyone could "run" for office
could feasibly involve more stu
dents as candidates than the elec
tions could muster as voters.
The system would be open to
many eminently qualified candi
dates who have great things to
offer but were formerly discour
aged from running by campaign
rituals. The exclusive and distant
aura of ASSU would change,
since the actual seats of power
would be within anyone's grasp.
Campus politics and issues
would be more interesting and
accessible to all.
In order to weed out those un
committed or lethargic candi
dates only casually interested in
the job, we could establish a sys
tem of priorities based on de
monstrated involvement with

campus activities and commun
ity service.
Instead of relying principally
on nominal achievements such as
"Manager of Larkin 1M coed
pickleball team," priorities could
be awarded for performing
specific tasks. For example, ac
tivities such as writing incendiary
letters to the Daily or attending
every dorm dramatic production
on campus for a month could
earn anyone some degree of
priority.
This may even inspire a tem
porary onslaught of campus ac
tivities as students scramble for
priority prior to elections.
A controversy surrounding re
turning presidents priority is
bound to arise wherein we must
weigh the relative benefits of job
experience and greater access to
offices, but this dilemma can be
fairly resolved, perhaps by Hip
ping a coin.
Finally, by blatantly emerging
as a process of pure chance, the
selection process would lose its
image as a trivial farce, and actu
ally increase its integrity.
For those who take these elec
tions seriously, the possibility of
having some platform of radical
goof-offs squeak out a majority
of the electorate would be
greatly reduced.
On the other hand, those who
are put oft by pompous politicos
parading their lofty qualifica
tions and aspirations in hopes of
accumulating more bombast for
their resumes could rest assured
that such bumblers have no grea
ter chance of coming to power
than do they.
Furthermore, the campus
would be spared the pesky
plethora of pleading propaganda
promising progressive politics
presently plastered all over the
halls, walls and stalls of our living

area.
Instead, for informational
purposes, some committee could
publish a set of election pam
phlets (or. more adequately,
notecards) designating the vari
ous positions and responsibilities
available and the priorities
necessary for drawing each of
fice.
Just as in the campus housing
dilemma, we are faced with
many more worthy and qualified
applicants than there are spaces
available. The system we have,
under the pretext of democracy,
is truly wasteful and ineffective;
far better to replace it with the
draw system until such time as
we can provide governmental of
fices for all those who seek them.
Instead of being screwed by
the Draw, we can turn around
and make the system work for us.
This is the real key to a greater
campus community.
