## Ehrlich's facts, emphasis wrong 
### 
On virtually every important point,
Dorothy Ehrlich's columns (Daily, May 6-7)
on the Bruce Franklin case are wrong in fact,
emphasis or interpretation. Rarely does one
encounter in public such indifference to the
record, such contempt for history, such an
affront to the intelligence, and even the
memory, of the audience. Let me be specific.
Ehrlich misstates the charges against
Franklin. He was neither accused of nor dis
missed for "delivery of four speeches in 1971
denouncing Stanford's complicity in the Vie
tnam war . . Four charges were originally
brought against Franklin. One, subsequently
dismissed by the Advisory Board, alleged
that he participated in the disruption of a
speech by Henry Cabot Lodge.
The other three involved three speeches
which the University alleged to constitute
incitement to violence. The Advisory Board
majority found Franklin guilty on all three
charges and recommended dismissal; the
minority found him guilty on two of the three
and recommended a lengthy suspension
without pay. The majority recommendation
was accepted.
Ehrlich is wrong about the ruling of the
Santa Clara Superior Court. It did not rule
"that two of the four speeches for which Pro
fessor Franklin was discharged were con
stitutionally protected." In fact, it ruled that
two of the three were not constitutionally
protected speech. The Court also ruled that
one of the speeches failed to meet the Bran
denberg test of incitement, and therefore the
Court dismissed that charge.
The Court did not order "university hear
ings to be reopened to consider the penalty of
dismissal." Rather, the Court opened the
case to be returned to the University for con

sideration of what penalty should have been
imposed in view of guilt on two rather than
three charges.
The administration does not have "its Ad
visory Board." The faculty has its Advisory
Board, elected by it and answerable to it, and
the board is represented by its own counsel.
The procedures ordered by the Advisory
Board do not violate Stanford's own rules.
The rules for the conduct of hearings clearly
are meant to apply to''hearings" in the ordi
nary common-sense meaning of that term.
The Advisory Board has apparently con
cluded, quite properly in my view, that the
hearing phase of this matter ended long ago
and that it is charged to do one thing and one
thing only, namely make a-recommendation
on penalty based on the existing record.
What the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) means by a "hearing" may be
judged by its requests to the Advisory Board.
They add up to what the ACLU lawyers have
themselves characterized as a "gala event."
The Superior Court at no time ruled
"that the administration had violated Profes
sor Franklin'sconstitutional rights by punish
ing him in part for protected speech." If
Ehrlich is a lawyer, that representation of the
court's ruling is unconscionable. The more
charitable interpretation is that it is simply
self-serving.
Ehrlich's description of the appeal process
that followed the Superior Court decision is
bizarre. One would never know from her
description of events that it was the ACLU,
not the University, that appealed the deci
sion. On second thought the ACLU asked
the Appeal Court to dismiss its own appeal!
The University resisted, but the court ag
reed to dismiss the appeal as premature.

In this partial catalog of Ehrlich's errors, it
should be understood that from the start it
was the ACLU that wanted the court to take
the case away from the University commun
ity. It asked the court to override the Advis
ory Board on the facts or on the law, and it
argued that the case should not be returned
to the University for reconsideration by its
own processes. In short, it asked to have
faculty discipline taken away from the fa
culty. Ehrlich's professed concern for the
Stanford community and its procedures is of
recent, and one suspects tactical, origin.
I could go on. For example, Franklin's
lawyers did not ask the Advisory Board to
provide for oral argument by counsel until it
was clear that their request for a "gala event"
was not to be granted. The University's
counsel have no objection to oral argument,
and said so. But enough. When facts are dealt
with so cavalierly, it is hardly necessary to
argue over matters of interpretation.
The ACLU has a distinguished history,
and we are better off as a nation for its work.
It is, however, an organization of human be
ings. They are moved by the thicket of mo
tives that governs all human behavior and
that produces the capacity for error. In my
view the Northern California ACLU grab
bed hold of the wr< ng side of this case, but at
this late date that hardly matters. What does
matter is the shoddiness of that ease that has
been made to us. It is an offensive compenti
dium of misstatements of fact, clumsy rhetor
ical sleight of hand and not very thoughtful or
profound preachings on academic freedom.
It is surprising — shockingly — unworthy of
the organization from which it issues.

hearing phase of this matter ended long ago
and that it is charged to do one thing and one
thing only, namely make a-recommendation
on penalty based on the existing record.
What the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) means by a "hearing" may be
judged by its requests to the Advisory Board.
They add up to what the ACLU lawyers have
themselves characterized as a "gala event."
The Superior Court at no time ruled
"that the administration had violated Profes
sor Franklin'sconstitutional rights by punish
ing him in part for protected speech." If
Ehrlich is a lawyer, that representation of the
court's ruling is unconscionable. The more
charitable interpretation is that it is simply
self-serving.
Ehrlich's description of the appeal process
that followed the Superior Court decision is
bizarre. One would never know from her
description of events that it was the ACLU,
not the University, that appealed the deci
sion. On second thought the ACLU asked
the Appeal Court to dismiss its own appeal!
The University resisted, but the court ag
reed to dismiss the appeal as premature.

In this partial catalog of Ehrlich's errors, it
should be understood that from the start it
was the ACLU that wanted the court to take
the case away from the University commun
ity. It asked the court to override the Advis
ory Board on the facts or on the law, and it
argued that the case should not be returned
to the University for reconsideration by its
own processes. In short, it asked to have
faculty discipline taken away from the fa
culty. Ehrlich's professed concern for the
Stanford community and its procedures is of
recent, and one suspects tactical, origin.
I could go on. For example, Franklin's
lawyers did not ask the Advisory Board to
provide for oral argument by counsel until it
was clear that their request for a "gala event"
was not to be granted. The University's
counsel have no objection to oral argument,
and said so. But enough. When facts are dealt
with so cavalierly, it is hardly necessary to
argue over matters of interpretation.
The ACLU has a distinguished history,
and we are better off as a nation for its work.
It is, however, an organization of human be
ings. They are moved by the thicket of mo
tives that governs all human behavior and
that produces the capacity for error. In my
view the Northern California ACLU grab
bed hold of the wr< ng side of this case, but at
this late date that hardly matters. What does
matter is the shoddiness of that ease that has
been made to us. It is an offensive compenti
dium of misstatements of fact, clumsy rhetor
ical sleight of hand and not very thoughtful or
profound preachings on academic freedom.
It is surprising — shockingly — unworthy of
the organization from which it issues.

public affairs for the University.)

On virtually every important point,
Dorothy Ehrlich's columns (Daily, May 6-7)
on the Bruce Franklin case are wrong in fact,
emphasis or interpretation. Rarely does one
encounter in public such indifference to the
record, such contempt for history, such an
affront to the intelligence, and even the
memory, of the audience. Let me be specific.
Ehrlich misstates the charges against
Franklin. He was neither accused of nor dis
missed for "delivery of four speeches in 1971
denouncing Stanford's complicity in the Vie
tnam war . . Four charges were originally
brought against Franklin. One, subsequently
dismissed by the Advisory Board, alleged
that he participated in the disruption of a
speech by Henry Cabot Lodge.
The other three involved three speeches
which the University alleged to constitute
incitement to violence. The Advisory Board
majority found Franklin guilty on all three
charges and recommended dismissal; the
minority found him guilty on two of the three
and recommended a lengthy suspension
without pay. The majority recommendation
was accepted.
Ehrlich is wrong about the ruling of the
Santa Clara Superior Court. It did not rule
"that two of the four speeches for which Pro
fessor Franklin was discharged were con
stitutionally protected." In fact, it ruled that
two of the three were not constitutionally
protected speech. The Court also ruled that
one of the speeches failed to meet the Bran
denberg test of incitement, and therefore the
Court dismissed that charge.
The Court did not order "university hear
ings to be reopened to consider the penalty of
dismissal." Rather, the Court opened the
case to be returned to the University for con

sideration of what penalty should have been
imposed in view of guilt on two rather than
three charges.
The administration does not have "its Ad
visory Board." The faculty has its Advisory
Board, elected by it and answerable to it, and
the board is represented by its own counsel.
The procedures ordered by the Advisory
Board do not violate Stanford's own rules.
The rules for the conduct of hearings clearly
are meant to apply to''hearings" in the ordi
nary common-sense meaning of that term.
