# CIT employees win suit over walk-out
## 
### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
Workers who walked off the job at the Center for
Information Technology (CIT) here this past June 26
because of alleged building and safety problems and
poor working conditions, won their suit against the
University and will be paid for the time that they
refused to work, according to a state Labor Commis
sion decision handed down late last month.
The incident occured early last summer, when four
permanent Stanford CIT (formerly the Stanford
Center for Information Processing) employees and
one federally funded employee walked off the job at
the newly constructed Forsyth Building to draw at
tention to what they called poor working conditions.
The workers filed suit against the University in hopes
of obtaining the back pay denied them for the period
that they refused to work.
According to the Collective Bargaining Agree
ment that the University has with United Stanford
Employees (USE), workers have the right to walk off
the job to protest unsafe working conditions.
The University held the position that the building
was safe before the workers walked off, and therefore
the employees were not entitled to wages for the day
spent off the job.
Countless problems
According to Bob Britton, union steward for the
workers involved, there were countless safety viola
tions in the unfinished facility that they were required

to work in. "Air conditioners on the roof were not
working.and the water coolers on the floor were
leaking water under the floors where several electri
cal cables were stored. Tiles were missing from the
floor, there were no toilets in the building, no fire
alarms, and no sprinkler system."
The painting and the sanding that was going on in
the building also added a lot of dust to the air and
caused several employees to file accident reports for
sinus problems. Britton said.
Mary Ann Lawrence, co-chairman of USE and a
member of the University safety committee, was
asked to walk through the building on the day of the
walkout to check for safety violations. "There had
been several inspections and many recommendations
made to the management before the walkout. This
was the only way to get things done," Lawrence said.
Discrimination
Britton and his co-workers also complained of dis
crimination by the University. The University paid its
own witnesses for the time that they spent testifying
at the hearing, but docked the complainants vacation
time for the hours that they spent away from work
during the hearing, the Labor Commission found.

ager at CIT, who at the time of the walkout said that
the building was "absolutely 100 percent safe,"
would not comment on the outcome of the hearing.
The CIT facilities at Forsyth Building were put into

operation before the building was completed because
a contract to sell the old computer in Encina Hall's
basement had to be met, Britton said.
No permit
After the walkout, the union found out that the
management had no permit to occupy the building as
early as they did. In addition. Britton continued . the
University only could get.a permit for the second
floor if it hooked up the sprinkler system, but it had
not been completed at the time of the walkout. "We
were in the building illegally, but they (the manage
ment) assured us that it was legal," Britton said.
Both Britton and Lawrence noted that the safety
conditions have been taken care of and that the build
ing's construction is complete. "The University is very
concerned about safety. Now they listen to us." Brit
ton said. "Our action made things become safe. The
management would still be dragging its feet" if the
walkout had not occurred, he added.
The workers were ordered to receive pav for the
time that they spent off the job during the walkout
and for the time that they spent testifying at the
hearing. It is not certain whether there will he an
appeal bv the University, but the workers are ex
tremely happy about the decision, according to Brit
ton.
"I was beginning to wonder how things would turn
out because things took so long and the University
has such political power, but 1 know that this will be a
precedent-setting decision," Britton said.

spent off the job.
Countless problems
According to Bob Britton, union steward for the
workers involved, there were countless safety viola
tions in the unfinished facility that they were required

to work in. "Air conditioners on the roof were not
working.and the water coolers on the floor were
leaking water under the floors where several electri
cal cables were stored. Tiles were missing from the
floor, there were no toilets in the building, no fire
alarms, and no sprinkler system."
The painting and the sanding that was going on in
the building also added a lot of dust to the air and
caused several employees to file accident reports for
sinus problems. Britton said.
Mary Ann Lawrence, co-chairman of USE and a
member of the University safety committee, was
asked to walk through the building on the day of the
walkout to check for safety violations. "There had
been several inspections and many recommendations
made to the management before the walkout. This
was the only way to get things done," Lawrence said.
Discrimination
Britton and his co-workers also complained of dis
crimination by the University. The University paid its
own witnesses for the time that they spent testifying
at the hearing, but docked the complainants vacation
time for the hours that they spent away from work
during the hearing, the Labor Commission found.
Robert Nosanchuck. Computer Operations Man
ager at CIT, who at the time of the walkout said that
the building was "absolutely 100 percent safe,"
would not comment on the outcome of the hearing.
The CIT facilities at Forsyth Building were put into

operation before the building was completed because
a contract to sell the old computer in Encina Hall's
basement had to be met, Britton said.
No permit
After the walkout, the union found out that the
management had no permit to occupy the building as
early as they did. In addition. Britton continued . the
University only could get.a permit for the second
floor if it hooked up the sprinkler system, but it had
not been completed at the time of the walkout. "We
were in the building illegally, but they (the manage
ment) assured us that it was legal," Britton said.
Both Britton and Lawrence noted that the safety
conditions have been taken care of and that the build
ing's construction is complete. "The University is very
concerned about safety. Now they listen to us." Brit
ton said. "Our action made things become safe. The
management would still be dragging its feet" if the
walkout had not occurred, he added.
The workers were ordered to receive pav for the
time that they spent off the job during the walkout
and for the time that they spent testifying at the
hearing. It is not certain whether there will he an
appeal bv the University, but the workers are ex
tremely happy about the decision, according to Brit
ton.
"I was beginning to wonder how things would turn
out because things took so long and the University
has such political power, but 1 know that this will be a
precedent-setting decision," Britton said.
