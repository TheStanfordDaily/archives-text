## Greek system premise morally inadmissable 
### 
Two interesting headlines ap
peared in last Wednesday's and
Thursday's Daily (April 30 and
May 1). One read. "Thirteen
fraternities get dean's warning"
and the other, "More alumnae
investigations of sorority rushees
reported."
We are not particularly sur
prised by these delinquencies,
since they are a built-in aspect of
the system of special privilege
(and accompanying irresponsi
bility) that fraternities and
sororities represent. But these
news items do provoke in us a
sense of dismay that Stanford al
lows, or has ever allowed, such
institutions to exist on this cam
pus. We have felt that dismay,
as regards fraternities, for many
years; we have felt it, as regards
sororities, since the board of
trustees' lamentable decision in
1977 to permit sororities as well
as fraternities on campus, after a
33-year ban.
This decision did not solve a
problem, it compounded it. The
right decision, in our opinion,
would have been to abolish both
fraternities and sororities, for
they both rest on organizational
premises that should be morally
inadmissible in a university — as
Yale and Harvard recognized
some decades ago.
We make no argument about
the advantages of small living
groups or about the close human
ties possible within them. These
are obvious goods — and many
others could be named. But
these goods are all subsumed
under one great wrong: the
power given to a self-selected
group of students to discriminate
socially against other students.
The evil of fraternities and
sororities lies in the rush system
— in the power of a house to
"ding" (is that term still in use?)
those they deem unsuitable for
their company.
It will be argued: Well, that's
life, isn't it? Isn't that just a sam
ple of what goes on in the outside
world? No doubt, but who said a
university should model itself on
what goes on in the outside

world? The university ought to
stand as a model of what a world
might be and not just a prepara
tion for the world that is. And
one feature of the world that
ought to be is a world in which we
rub shoulders, and enjoy rubbing
shoulders, with all sorts and con
ditions of men and women.
But, some of you will answer,
fraternities and sororities no
longer tolerate racial or religious
prejudice. To a degree that is
true. We have watched frater
nities (and sororities at a greater
distance) liberalize themselves
over the years: first they let down
the gates to poor kids, then to
Catholics, then to Jews, then to
Orientals, then to blacks (not
necessarily in that order). And
they congratulated themselves
with every liberalizing step. But
such self-congratulation was and
is almost entirely out of order.
Why? Because these measures
do nothing to remove the root
evil — discrimination itself.
Jews, Catholics, blacks and other
minorities may now get in the
door, but what about the short
guy with acne, the fat girl, the
wimp, the nerd and all the other
categories of undesirables that
are now available for exclusion
by the masters and mistresses of
the "dinging" process?
Fraternities and sororities
have got rid of certain selected
kinds of discrimination, but they
have not got rid of the principle
of discrimination. That is still a
sacred right with them and it is,
in our opinion, flatly immoral. If
a person is good enough to get
into Stanford, that person is
good enough to have a fair
chance at whatever housing
facilities or group living ar
rangements are available on this
campus.
For a person to be excluded
from certain houses or groups
because -members of those
houses or groups, in their wis
dom, do not think that person is
fit is simply intolerable. Such
exclusion is in our opinion un
fair, undemocratic and unwise —
and no self-respecting university

should permit it.
Once again, we hear the coun
terargument: But doesn't the
University practice discrimina
tion in the admission process?
Yes, but this is discrimination
based on intellectual determin
ants of fitness for a particular
end; it is not social discrimina
tion appraising the whole person
as fit or unfit, acceptable or un
acceptable. To say that one can
not get into Stanford because
one is not good enough in math is
quite different from saying that
one cannot get into the Kappas
because one doesn't wear the
right clothes or (as seems to be
the thrust in the recent sorority
investigations) doesn't come
from the right family. Of course,
subtle prejudices may creep into
the admission process as well,
but at least the University tries to
keep such prejudices out.
A university ought to be a "lit
tle universe," a place where one
cannot escapt contact with
people of other races, classes,
creeds and — consequently —

where one cannot hide in some
safe quarantine with people just
like oneself from one's own race,
class and income group. Such iso
lation is insidious; it is elitism
based on false and shallow stan
dards. The people practicing —
and the university allowing —

such elitism are the poorer for it,
and defeat their own best pur
poses.

exclusion is in our opinion un
fair, undemocratic and unwise —
and no self-respecting university

should permit it.
Once again, we hear the coun
terargument: But doesn't the
University practice discrimina
tion in the admission process?
Yes, but this is discrimination
based on intellectual determin
ants of fitness for a particular
end; it is not social discrimina
tion appraising the whole person
as fit or unfit, acceptable or un
acceptable. To say that one can
not get into Stanford because
one is not good enough in math is
quite different from saying that
one cannot get into the Kappas
because one doesn't wear the
right clothes or (as seems to be
the thrust in the recent sorority
investigations) doesn't come
from the right family. Of course,
subtle prejudices may creep into
the admission process as well,
but at least the University tries to
keep such prejudices out.
A university ought to be a "lit
tle universe," a place where one
cannot escapt contact with
people of other races, classes,
creeds and — consequently —

where one cannot hide in some
safe quarantine with people just
like oneself from one's own race,
class and income group. Such iso
lation is insidious; it is elitism
based on false and shallow stan
dards. The people practicing —
and the university allowing —

such elitism are the poorer for it,
and defeat their own best pur
poses.

Two interesting headlines ap
peared in last Wednesday's and
Thursday's Daily (April 30 and
May 1). One read. "Thirteen
fraternities get dean's warning"
and the other, "More alumnae
investigations of sorority rushees
reported."
We are not particularly sur
prised by these delinquencies,
since they are a built-in aspect of
the system of special privilege
(and accompanying irresponsi
bility) that fraternities and
sororities represent. But these
news items do provoke in us a
sense of dismay that Stanford al
lows, or has ever allowed, such
institutions to exist on this cam
pus. We have felt that dismay,
as regards fraternities, for many
years; we have felt it, as regards
sororities, since the board of
trustees' lamentable decision in
1977 to permit sororities as well
as fraternities on campus, after a
33-year ban.
This decision did not solve a
problem, it compounded it. The
right decision, in our opinion,
would have been to abolish both
fraternities and sororities, for
they both rest on organizational
premises that should be morally
inadmissible in a university — as
Yale and Harvard recognized
some decades ago.
We make no argument about
the advantages of small living
groups or about the close human
ties possible within them. These
are obvious goods — and many
others could be named. But
these goods are all subsumed
under one great wrong: the
power given to a self-selected
group of students to discriminate
socially against other students.
The evil of fraternities and
sororities lies in the rush system
— in the power of a house to
"ding" (is that term still in use?)
those they deem unsuitable for
their company.
It will be argued: Well, that's
life, isn't it? Isn't that just a sam
ple of what goes on in the outside
world? No doubt, but who said a
university should model itself on
what goes on in the outside

world? The university ought to
stand as a model of what a world
might be and not just a prepara
tion for the world that is. And
one feature of the world that
ought to be is a world in which we
rub shoulders, and enjoy rubbing
shoulders, with all sorts and con
ditions of men and women.
But, some of you will answer,
fraternities and sororities no
longer tolerate racial or religious
prejudice. To a degree that is
true. We have watched frater
nities (and sororities at a greater
distance) liberalize themselves
over the years: first they let down
the gates to poor kids, then to
Catholics, then to Jews, then to
Orientals, then to blacks (not
necessarily in that order). And
they congratulated themselves
with every liberalizing step. But
such self-congratulation was and
is almost entirely out of order.
Why? Because these measures
do nothing to remove the root
evil — discrimination itself.
Jews, Catholics, blacks and other
minorities may now get in the
door, but what about the short
guy with acne, the fat girl, the
wimp, the nerd and all the other
categories of undesirables that
are now available for exclusion
by the masters and mistresses of
the "dinging" process?
Fraternities and sororities
have got rid of certain selected
kinds of discrimination, but they
have not got rid of the principle
of discrimination. That is still a
sacred right with them and it is,
in our opinion, flatly immoral. If
a person is good enough to get
into Stanford, that person is
good enough to have a fair
chance at whatever housing
facilities or group living ar
rangements are available on this
campus.
For a person to be excluded
from certain houses or groups
because -members of those
houses or groups, in their wis
dom, do not think that person is
fit is simply intolerable. Such
exclusion is in our opinion un
fair, undemocratic and unwise —
and no self-respecting university

should permit it.
