## View of gays discouraging 
### 
Imagine my surprise and delight to find that a
pro-gay article had made the Daily written by
someone outside the gay community. Signs of ac
ceptance, I thought to myself, signs of understand
ing. That is, until I reached the paragraph labeling
me as unnatural.
David Forsythe's view (Daily, May 6) that Prop
osition A only guarantees people basic rights was
encouraging, but his view of gay people was some
what disappointing. I agree with his point that the
opposition to the ordinance is clouding the issue
with religious dogma and the question of accep
tance of homosexuality. Fie rightly pointed out that
Proposition A has nothing to do with either.
What 1 found disturbing about the article was
Forsythe's bringing in irrelevant points. What does
it matter that he is heterosexual, that he finds
homosexuality unnatural, that teachers should be
fired for trying to "convert" students? These are
very old battlegrounds between gays and straights
that I don't feel like droning on about. I find even
the questions themselves somewhat absurd.

My reaction to the article was very similar to the
feeling of blacks in the '60s when whites thought
that equality meant "some of my best friends are
colored." I found the separatism implied by For
syte's comment that gays are "much like us" to be
very discouraging. We want to be part of the Stan
ford community, accepted and understood as our
selves. The most intelligent thing Harry Britt said
last week, which seemed to be missed by almost
everyone, was that the gay movement means a
whole lot more than gay rights ordinances.
I was actually quite impressed that Forsythe had
the courage to write such an article. Nowadays a
person cannot be pro-gay without being accused of
being gay. I was impressed that he was aware of
some of the subtleties of the issue. I wish that he
were more sensitive to gays as individuals, but I'm
sure that he will be once he finds out that his
heterosexual us has a whole lot of homosexual
them.
