## 'Keystone Cops' episode unsettling 
### 
It reads like a Peter Sellers'
spy spoof, or a Keystone Cops
episode. Our daring heroes in
blue dream up complicated,
secret plans to sneak into the
bank robbers' hideout, hoping
to recover stolen loot.
Then, three squad cars break
down. Two more collide in the
confusion and spectacularly
explode.
In the end, because the com
ical bad guys are even bigger
bunglers, the good guys win
anyway? Not, unfortunately,
the case.
This time, our heroes (in
army camouflage green) re
treat in disarray, leaving for
lorn on a blazing Iranian desert
millions of dollars in wrecked
equipment, a nation's hopes of
rescuing 53 hostages . . . and
eight dead men.
We can anticipate consider
able political fallout from this
tragic farce.
The domestic repercussions,
for example, have already be
gun. Suddenly the opposition
to draft registration is strangely
unheeded. Conservatives, long
grumbling that an all-volunteer
military is an inept military, will
have a field day.
Citizens will rally 'round our
honest, bumbling president,
who strives so diligently to sus
tain us through such troubled
times. Patriotic public opinion
will rise right on cue, to support
even this executive blooper. (In
times of national crisis, the
presidency is an extraordinarily
secure office.)
The international repercus
sions will be more severe. Cur
rent poor prospects forearly re
lease of the hostages will wor
sen dramatically. The affair will
fan the fanatic Islamic fires of

an Iran already scorchingly an
gry-
Worse, perhaps, is the de
pressing effect the rescue at
tempt will have on an already
lading world opinion of U.S.
strength and resolve. The Is
raelis and British succeeded at
Entebbe and in London; what
has happened to us?
Whether or not the raid was
justified is a painful question
that I've been unable to ans
wer, that may never be fully
answered. It is true that Iran
has broken ancient, inviolate
international laws by condon

ing the embassy takeover and
by encouraging the prolonged
imprisonment and suffering of
the American hostages.
But Iran itself suffered years
of untold repression under a
shah substantially supported by
an oil-hungry United States.
Do two wrongsa right maketh?
At the very least, we must
learn from this tragedy. It illus
trates a subtle paradox in inter
national affairs that is too often
overlooked.
The crux of the matter is this:
I he embassy takeover may
well have been deterred, had

past U.S. responses assured the
world (as Israeli actions have
done) that such acts would not
be tolerated. The way to seek
peace and prevent violence, it
seems, is to amply demonstrate
one's capability for violence.
This is the absurd razor's
edge balance of violence and
peace that characterizes our
modern world. It is my hope
that you find the idea as unsettl
ing as I do. Perhaps, in time, we
might find a better way.
