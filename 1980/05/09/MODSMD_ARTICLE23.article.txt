## THE
						RESCUE ATTEMPT Grady Floyd Don't judge Carter decision 
### 
David Sartoris' beliefs ex
pressed in " Rescue try objec
tionable" (Daily, April 29) are
extremely presumptuous.
To begin with, Sartoris
stated that President Jimmy
Carter had to "consult Con
gress, the American people or

even the hostage families," be
fore the reseue was attempted.
Furthermore, to fully know
whether the attempt was feasi
ble or not the people would
have to know all the details of
the rescue. I think it would
have been difficult for the pres
ident to have an element of
surprise had he released the de
tailed plans of the rescue in a
news conference and asked
Americans what they thought.
Furthermore, a real care for
the welfare of the hostages
would have required an at
tempt at rescue. It is obvious
the situation has changed little
since November. The hostages
are still imprisoned and seem no
closer, to freedom. The crucial
element of surprise was there,
for the Iranians, the Ameri
cans. and the rest of the world
were shocked.
Mechanical failure was only
one of a string of problems that
could have forced the mission
to be aborted. Had air traffic
been directed properly, no lives
would have been lost. It was a
tragic accident, but placing the
deaths of those gallant volun
teers on Carter is a cheap way
to find a scapegoat.
Only the president and his
advisers had the power, which
was given to them by the
people, to decide if the risk was
worth taking. We do not know
the details of the operation;
thus, we are incapable of judg
ing Carter's decision.
Sartoris states, "If the cap
tive Americans are injured or

killed by the Iranian terrorists!
our nation will do wise to'bite
the bullet' and refrain fronrj
military action of any kind.'*
Are we supposed to lie dowri
after we have tried every
peaceful method to free citi
zens who were seized on U.Sj
territory, while the militants re-;
fuse even a plea from a Unitedi
Nations council to see the hos-!
tages.
In retrospect one sees that
our national pride has not been
put aside; it has been thrown;
away into an abyss of passive-'
ness. By dealing with the ter-'
rorists we have opened the<
door to future terrorist actions '
and more embassy seizures,
such as in Bogota. We are cal- \
led the " great satan" by people
who believe flogging is approp
riate punishment for major
theft or speaking against Kho-'
meini.
We try to peacefully free in
nocent hostages, who are only
pawns to militants who spit in
our taces by taking charred
bodies and putting them out for
frenzied crowds to cheer,
Yet some say Carter is to be
harshly criticized for the recent
unsuccessful attempt at a milit
ary rescue. Saying this without
knowledge of the details of the
operation is ignorant. To say
any use of force must be av
oided at all cost is even more
ignorant. We. as a country, can
be abused for only so long.
Then our patience will run out.
