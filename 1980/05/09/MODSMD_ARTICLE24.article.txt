No violation
While the National Panhel
lenic Society's treatment of
Carol Chesarek (Daily, April
28) can certainly be called
shoddy, distasteful, etc., I be
lieve that Chesarek goes too far
in asserting that her rights have
been violated.
' Chesarek's mother freely gave
the requested information on the
assumption that her daughter
wished her to. Clearly, she as
sumed incorrectly, but this can
hardly be used to justify a claim
that the asker has violated
Chesarek's rights.
To follow Chesarek's asser
tions to their logical conclusion
would be to maintain that a
"right to privacy'' prohibits any
one from answering questions
about someone else without that
person's express knowledged
and consent. Let us suppose for a
moment that two of Chesarek's
friends were having a conversa
tion and one asked the other,
"What does Carol's father do for
a living?" The other, having
been told by Chesarek in the
course of another informal con
versation, during which no
explicit request for confidential
ity was made, passes on the in
formation.
Has this person violated
Chesarek's rights? I maintain
that he or she has not, because
the information was made freely
available by Chesarek in the first
place.
Even if we consider facts
about an individual to initially be
that individual's personal prop
erty, and this is by no means a
universally accepted principle,
must still consider whether,
under the principles of common
law, these facts can be consi
dered to have been transferred
to the public domain.
As a libertarian, I am con
cerned about the ever increasing
tendency to describe any disre
putable act as a rights violation,
for when everything is a right,
nothing is a right.
Individuals really only have
one right — to be left free from
coercion by other individuals so
long as they are not themselves
coercing others. All other true
rights — freedom of religion, of
speech, etc. — are really only
corollaries, elaborations r on, this
basic right. To assert that some
thing is a right merely because it
is highly desireable, or even
necessary, to human existence —
food, shelter, clothing, education
— is to weaken our conceptuali
zation of the natural law basis of
human rights.
I posit that the "right to pri
vacy" should be strictly inter
preted as the right of individuals
not to disclose information about
themselves or about an indi
vidual with whom they share a
relationship of confidentiality. I
further maintain that this implies
a corollary right to be free from
the coercive or fraudulent ex

traction of that information.
In any event, only if Chesarek
is prepared to claim that the
Panhellenic representative gave
assurances to her mother that
Chesarek wished the informa
tion to be released, or if she was
herself given assurance that no
investigation would be con
ducted, is there any possibility
that a true rights violation may
have occurred.

'Sardonic' response
Brad Brockbank's complaint
about Daily coverage of frater
nity social gatherings (Daily,
April 16) is typical of the inaccu
rate, paranoid hysteria which
characterizes the Greek estab
lishment whenever its demeanor
is called into question.
First off, Brockbank claims he
viewed the Daily reports with
"sardonic remorse," a phrase
which makes about as much
sense as the rest of his letter.
But more important is that
Brockbank's letter is based on
some utterly false assumptions
intermingled with highly
strained analogies.
Brockbank implies the Daily
ignored its policy of withholding
victims' names by printing names
of persons involved in some re
cent frat activities. But the Daily
policy he cites covers only vic
tims of sexual assault. Using in
formation only with the consent
of those involved in an incident is
comparable to the system of re
porting practiced in the Soviet
Union, which Brockbank, as a
former Daily editor, should well
know.
The Daily does cover stories of
athletes' injuries which occur off
the field. (See stories last year on
automobile accidents involving
Steve Budinger and Tom Hall.)
And though it is true that some
participants at functions in Stan
ford Stadium and on the Row end
up in Cowell regularly, we feel
creating an analogy between
these athletic competitions and
rush parties overlooks the pur
poses and meanings of the re
spective activities.
A simple nostalgic look at the
1970s shows that fraternity
members and their alumni seem
to have been involved in a rather
high proportion of student inci
dents around the University in
volving assault, robbery, theft,
damage to property, contribut
ing to the'delinquency of minors
and other violations of the state
penal and alcoholic beverage
codes. Of course coincidence
dictates that these incidents al
ways occur before, during, or
after a fraternity function where
liquor just happens to be pre
sent.
Perhaps Brockbank would
like to check the public police

records or ask the Office of Re
sidential Education to find out
whether any other residence
groups are as accident-prone as
fraternity members.
It is simply untrue to claim the
Daily is "out to get" fraternities
or any other group for that mat
ter. Such claims seem to us
merely feeble attempts to divert
attention away from the miscon
duct involved and to shift the
blame to other parties.

Event for Brodie
This Sunday will be a special
day here. Brodie Lockard will
come back to campus for the first
time since last December. You
may remember reading or hear
ing about how Brodie, a member
of the Stanford gymnastics team,
fell during practice and suffered
an injury that left him paralyzed
from the neck down.
Since then, Brodie has shown
remarkable courage and deter
mination. Recently he under
went an operation to implant a
device in his chest to stimulate
his lungs; it is hoped that eventu
ally this will allow him to breathe
without the aid of an artificial
respirator. He hopes eventually
to return to Stanford on a regular
basis to complete his education.
To support and encourage
Brodie in this endeavor, and to
provide an educational and en
joyable program for the com
munity, we have planned the
Stanford Health Symposium and
Fitness Run program. This prog
ram will include a morning sym
posium with three outstanding
speakers and an afternoon prog
ram of fun exercise activities.
Events will include several dif
ferent runs, a centipede race,
clinics on warm-up and stretch
ing, a large number of prizes, cer
tificates for all participants, the
Stanford Band and Dollies, and
all the Olympia beer and Calis
toga mineral water you can
drink. In addition, shirts donated
by Nautilus, Wells Fargo and
Nike will be available for sale.
The proceeds for this event
will be given to Brodie to pay for
special equipment he will need to
attend classes and to meet tuition
and other educational expenses.
A lot will be happening this
Sunday. The Blue Grass Festival
in Frost Amphitheater should be
super. The Bridge's Spring Faire
deserves your support also. And
let's not forget midterms and fi
nals just a few weeks away. But
take some time to say hello to
Brodie, have some fun, have a j
beer, and let some sun shine into i
your life. I

Free actions best
One question of Peter Strom
berg's column. "Libertarians'
ideas 'nonsensical' " (Daily,
Apr. 30) deserves swift reply. I le
asks "Why do libertarians stick
so dogmatically to the absurd
principle that the power wielded
by money is legitimate while the
power wielded by political
groups is not?"
Hie answer lies in the funda
mental nature of each of these
kinds of power. Political power
always involves the use of physi
cal force: There is ultimately a
jail cell waiting behind every
command of a bureaucrat or
elected politician. Economic
power only involves offers that
can be refused.
For example, contrast how a
rich entrepreneur and the gov
ernment would acquire a section
of town to put to new use. The
entrepreneur must buy out every
owner at a mutually acceptable
price. The government merely
condemns the property, pays the
"fair market value" (whether or
not the owners were willing to
sell for that price) and kicks
people out by force.
And why does Stromberg find
it "dogmatic" to interpret
human events in terms of simple
principles of justice? Just what is
his alternative to the libertarian
non-aggression principle: No
person or group may interfere
with the activities of any other
person or group, so long as those
activities are peaceful, voluntary
and non-fraudulent?
Stromberg says there seem to

be sonic good ideas in liber
tarianism. All he needs to do
now is to apply those good ideas
consistently to human affairs and
not he quite so "dogmatic"
about his interpretation of his
tory. He might see that the free
actions and cooperation of indi
viduals, not the coercion of gov
ernment, are the way out of pov
erty and injustice.

Name that drummer
On Apr. 17 you published an
article by Shelly Stevenson. "Af
ter the concert: A talk with the
Ramones." 11 was very good, ex
cept that the drummer was iden
tified as Tommy Ramone.
Tommy Ramone hasn't been
the drummer since about two
years ago. Markv Ramone has
recorded "Road to Ruin" and
"End ot the Century" with the
Ramones.
In the future, interviewers
should know more about the
group that they are interviewing
and who they are talking about.

Gay raids unjust
As a member of the Stanford
community I was saddened to
hear of the arrests of 1 5 men on
sex charges related to activity in
the men's restrooms on campus.
The surprise raids, coming after
a long period of relaxed en

forcement, represent an unjust
overreaction out of proportion
to the offense. .
As a gay man I was outraged to
read Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer's comments in a re
cent Chronicle article: "We
don't want this campus to be
come a hangout for homosexu
als '' Am I to conclude that my
presence as a graduate student
and stall member at the Univer
sity is contributing to an undesir
able atmosphere?
Niemeyer's comments were
bigoted and homophobic and
should be labeled as such. If his
remarks represent the perspec
tive of the adminsitration toward
gay people, then I strongly pro
test that position.

Catch 22 of credit
All I had to do was file an ap
plication form for a Sears
Roebuck credit card and $5
worth of free goods would be
mine. At that time I wasn't par
ticularly desperate for credit, but
such overwhelming corporate
generosity is a rare phenomenon
these days, so I conscientiously
filled out the form.
By the time it had been com
pleted I was left with the distinct
impression that all they were in
terested in was how much and
how often I'd been in debt, and
how rapidly I'd paid back what I

owed. Coming from an honest
God-fearing family I had always
been raised to believe that what
you couldn't afford you
shouldn't buy, and as a result had
only owed money once in my life/
It was hard to imagine that a
50 cent debt during high school
days would he of interest to any
one, but I wrote it down anywayo
How soon had I repaid it? Now
that I think of it. I never did. My
credit record wasn't looking too
healthy, but 1 was sure it would
pay to be honest.
Time passed, and 1 happily oc
cupied my hours working out
how much 50 cents must be
worth these days. If I'm right. I
now owe Adrian Jones about,
$10,000! I hope he doesn't turn
up one day and demand it back.
Imagine my disappointment
when I received a standard
printed letter of refusal from
Sears. It was gratifying to know
that I hadn't been discriminated
against on the basis of color, re
ligion. national origin, sex, mari
tal status or age. (One imagines
that they don't refuse many cre
dit requests.) I read on: "Insuffi
cient credit experience . . . insu
ficient credit reference." Now
wait a minute, are you trying to
tell me that you need credit be
fore you can get credit? Catch
22! I hear you cry.
What lesson should we learn
troni this? Raise your children to
owe money. What can you buy
for $5 these days anyway?
