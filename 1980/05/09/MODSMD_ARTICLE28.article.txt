# UCLA edges netters in last match
## 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
After nine grueling hours of tennis, Stan
ford and UCLA, the No. 1 and 2 ranked
teams in the nation, were just where
everyone thought they inevitably would be
— at 4-4 with the Card's Peter Rennert and
Lloyd Bourne facing the Bruin's Dick Metz
and Blaine Willenborg for the deciding fifth
point.
And tor awhile, the Cards seemed to have
things in control. With a boisterous partisan
crowd of 2500 rooting the Cardinal pair on,
twice Rennert and Bourne appeared to have
the Bruin duo on the rack; first, serving at
4-3 in the first set and then again at 4-3 in the
second set.
But twice Metz and Willenborg came
charging back to break serve to even the set
and twice they came back to win no ad points
to break serve at 5-4 as they held on to a 6-4,
6-4 victory, giving UCLA the 5-4 team win.
For UCLA, the win was sweet revenge, as
they reversed the tables from Stanford's ear
lier 5-4 win in Los Angeles. .
The Cards went into Maples Pavilion
knowing that they couldn't lose a match as
they ended the day's matches down 2-4. And
the story for the Cards for the day's matches
was sophomore Scott Bondurant as he ac
counted for both of the Cardinal points. In
the singles, Bondurant put Stanford up on
the scoreboard 1-0 as he quickly\iisposed of
Metz 6-2, 6-4. Charging the net with every

possible opportunity, Bondurant discour
aged Met/, by consistently stretching for ap
parent passing shots and angling away the
volleys.
In the doubles, Bondurant teamed with
Dave Siegler to score Stanford's second
point of the day as they downed Robbie Ven
ter .and Dan Saltz 6-3, 6-3.
But even after losses by Bourne, Arons
and Siegler in the singles, and a loss by
Mayotte and Arons in the doubles which left
the Cards down 2-4, there was still hope for
Stanford. The team knew they had Mayotte
and Rennert, Stanford's top two stars who
have lead the team so far, combining for a
27-2 record, yet to be called upon.
And first it was Mayotte who answered the
call as he thoroughly destroyed UCLA's
Mike Harrington 6-1, 6-3. Mayotte, playing
perhaps his finest match of the year, used his
power game which complimented the fast
indoor surface of Maples to force Harrington
away from the net on the Bruin's serve, and
used his own strong serve-volley to easily
hold its own serve.
Down 3-4, the Cards then called on their
ace Rennert to face UCLA's South African
Robbie Venter. Rennert, playing in his first
match since beating Tony Giamalva of Trin
ity two weeks ago, made more than his usual
•number of errors, but still managed to got out
the big points as he held on to a 6-3, 5-7, 6-2
win.
In the first set Rennert took advantage of

one service break and held onto four service
games on no ad points, hut in the second set
Venter managed to hold his own serve on
three no ad points and hroke Rennert at 5-6
to send the match into the deciding third set.
For a moment, it looked as though the final
doubles match would be meaningless, as
Venter quickly held serve, but Rennert
fought back with two straight service breaks
to take the set and knot the team score at 4-4.
And in the deciding doubles match it was a
case of missed opportunity for Stanford. In
the set. with Bourne serving at 4-3, the
Cards had two game points to go ahead 5-3,
but the Bruins came back with two strong
returns. Then, after Willenborg held serve to
put UCLA up 5-4. the Cards had two more
points to tie the set at 5-5, but first Rennert
netted an easy volley, and then Willenborg
rifled a return which a diving Rennert floated
long to give the Bruins the first set.
In the second set the Cards were once
again rolling, serving at 4-3, only to lose
serve on another no ad point on Rennert's
serve. After Metz held serve for a 5-4 lead.
Bourne, feeling the pressure of Willenborg,
double faulted on the crucial no ad point,
sending Willenborg and Metz into hysterics
and Rennert and Bourne to the locker room
as a stunned croyvd looked on.
The loss for the Cards does nothing to their,
chances for the Pacific-10 Conference title as
that will still be decided Saturday when they
host USC.

Tim Mayotte kept his 15 game winning streak alive last night as he pummelled UCLA's Mike
Harrington 6-1,6-3 in the No. 2 singles spot. ITie team effort was not as bright. The Cards dropped
the match and snapped their nine game winning streak, losing to the Bruins 5-4.

possible opportunity, Bondurant discour
aged Met/, by consistently stretching for ap
parent passing shots and angling away the
volleys.
In the doubles, Bondurant teamed with
Dave Siegler to score Stanford's second
point of the day as they downed Robbie Ven
ter .and Dan Saltz 6-3, 6-3.
But even after losses by Bourne, Arons
and Siegler in the singles, and a loss by
Mayotte and Arons in the doubles which left
the Cards down 2-4, there was still hope for
Stanford. The team knew they had Mayotte
and Rennert, Stanford's top two stars who
have lead the team so far, combining for a
27-2 record, yet to be called upon.
And first it was Mayotte who answered the
call as he thoroughly destroyed UCLA's
Mike Harrington 6-1, 6-3. Mayotte, playing
perhaps his finest match of the year, used his
power game which complimented the fast
indoor surface of Maples to force Harrington
away from the net on the Bruin's serve, and
used his own strong serve-volley to easily
hold its own serve.
Down 3-4, the Cards then called on their
ace Rennert to face UCLA's South African
Robbie Venter. Rennert, playing in his first
match since beating Tony Giamalva of Trin
ity two weeks ago, made more than his usual
•number of errors, but still managed to got out
the big points as he held on to a 6-3, 5-7, 6-2
win.
In the first set Rennert took advantage of

one service break and held onto four service
games on no ad points, hut in the second set
Venter managed to hold his own serve on
three no ad points and hroke Rennert at 5-6
to send the match into the deciding third set.
For a moment, it looked as though the final
doubles match would be meaningless, as
Venter quickly held serve, but Rennert
fought back with two straight service breaks
to take the set and knot the team score at 4-4.
And in the deciding doubles match it was a
case of missed opportunity for Stanford. In
the set. with Bourne serving at 4-3, the
Cards had two game points to go ahead 5-3,
but the Bruins came back with two strong
returns. Then, after Willenborg held serve to
put UCLA up 5-4. the Cards had two more
points to tie the set at 5-5, but first Rennert
netted an easy volley, and then Willenborg
rifled a return which a diving Rennert floated
long to give the Bruins the first set.
In the second set the Cards were once
again rolling, serving at 4-3, only to lose
serve on another no ad point on Rennert's
serve. After Metz held serve for a 5-4 lead.
Bourne, feeling the pressure of Willenborg,
double faulted on the crucial no ad point,
sending Willenborg and Metz into hysterics
and Rennert and Bourne to the locker room
as a stunned croyvd looked on.
The loss for the Cards does nothing to their,
chances for the Pacific-10 Conference title as
that will still be decided Saturday when they
host USC.

Tim Mayotte kept his 15 game winning streak alive last night as he pummelled UCLA's Mike
Harrington 6-1,6-3 in the No. 2 singles spot. ITie team effort was not as bright. The Cards dropped
the match and snapped their nine game winning streak, losing to the Bruins 5-4.
After nine grueling hours of tennis, Stan
ford and UCLA, the No. 1 and 2 ranked
teams in the nation, were just where
everyone thought they inevitably would be
— at 4-4 with the Card's Peter Rennert and
Lloyd Bourne facing the Bruin's Dick Metz
and Blaine Willenborg for the deciding fifth
point.
And tor awhile, the Cards seemed to have
things in control. With a boisterous partisan
crowd of 2500 rooting the Cardinal pair on,
twice Rennert and Bourne appeared to have
the Bruin duo on the rack; first, serving at
4-3 in the first set and then again at 4-3 in the
second set.
But twice Metz and Willenborg came
charging back to break serve to even the set
and twice they came back to win no ad points
to break serve at 5-4 as they held on to a 6-4,
6-4 victory, giving UCLA the 5-4 team win.
For UCLA, the win was sweet revenge, as
they reversed the tables from Stanford's ear
lier 5-4 win in Los Angeles. .
The Cards went into Maples Pavilion
knowing that they couldn't lose a match as
they ended the day's matches down 2-4. And
the story for the Cards for the day's matches
was sophomore Scott Bondurant as he ac
counted for both of the Cardinal points. In
the singles, Bondurant put Stanford up on
the scoreboard 1-0 as he quickly\iisposed of
Metz 6-2, 6-4. Charging the net with every

possible opportunity, Bondurant discour
