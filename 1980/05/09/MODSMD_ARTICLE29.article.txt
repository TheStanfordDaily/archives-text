# Cards crush Cal in series opener
## 
### Jeff Powell Staff Writer 
With cries of "wait till next
year" or "it's all over but the sh
outing" or even "the party's
over" dancing in their heads, the
Cards toppled the Cal Bears,
9-4, in Sunken Diamond in the
first game of their three-game
set.
The part about the cries is pure
supposition of course. But hear
ing that the Cards beat yet
another conference rival at home
is quickly becoming old hat.
This season on the road they
play like perfect guests, losing 14
out of 14 conference road games,
yet at home, they're downright
rude.
And yesterday was no excep
tion.
The Cards, playing the spoiler
role to perfection, knockcd off
the second place Bears, but it
took some clutch fielding and
hitting by Mike Dotterer and
some timely Cal errors to do it.
Dotterer came up with several
outstanding plays in the late in
nings to stave off a Bear com
eback. With the score 7-3 in the
bottom of the eighth. Dotterer
slammed a two-run homer to
widen the gap.
That roundtripper appeared
to be a gift from the Gods in the
ninth when Cal loaded the bases
with nobody out. Catcher Tom
Colburn ripped a Bob Boatman
pitch to deep left field, a sure
grand slam, or so it seemed. Dot
terer, at the very last moment,
reached up and snagged the ball,
with his mitt actually over the
fence.
"You're not going to see any
better catches than that one,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"Dot really saved Boatman with
the catch. And the home run re
ally helped too. Mike's going to
be an even better power hitter
the older he gets.
Much to Cal's dismay, Dot
terer was old enough yesterday.
But if Dotterer was old

enough, then Cal's fielding at
times resembled Little League
play.
With the Cards up 3-1 in the
fourth, the Bears fell apart. Mike
Toothman reached first on an in
field error to open the belated
rally. Then with two out and
runners on first and third, a pas
sed ball and a walk followed be
fore Darryl Stephens reached
first on another Bear error, this
time a run scored.
DH Steve Buechele grounded
to short but on the throw, first
baseman Kelly Wood dropped
the ball, scoring Bob DeCosta
with Stephens moving to third.
Buechele got caught in a run
down, however, and Stephens
then scored us a result of another

bungled Cal effort in the field.
In that inning, the Cards
scored four runs on but one hit.
The four errors, said Marquess,
were because of "a combination
of Card pressure and just bad
breaks."
Meanwhile the Cards were the
victims of good fortune. Bob
Boatman, originally scheduled
for the middle three innings after
Larry Kuhn, pitched five and a
third innings.
Said Marquess, "We hadn't
planned to go that far with Bob.
But we had a good lead and he
was pitching well so we decided
to let him keep pitching. He gave
up too many walks in the last
couple innings but Dotterer re
ally saved him. Anyway, because

Bob pitched so long, we can start
Brian Mignano in the next game
(this afternoon in Berkeley) and
let him go as tar as he can and
then come back with Kuhn on
Saturday."
Mignano will start today's
game in Berkeley and he, too,
will be hoping for some breaks as
Cal is tough at home and the
Cards' away record this season
has been a little less than spec
tacular.
"It will be tough. Cal is always
tough at home so it will really
depend on how Brian pitches
and on how well we hit. We re
ally broke out of a dry spell (yes
terday)," said Marquess.
Today's game at Berkeley be
gins at 2:30 p.m.

times resembled Little League
play.
With the Cards up 3-1 in the
fourth, the Bears fell apart. Mike
Toothman reached first on an in
field error to open the belated
rally. Then with two out and
runners on first and third, a pas
sed ball and a walk followed be
fore Darryl Stephens reached
first on another Bear error, this
time a run scored.
DH Steve Buechele grounded
to short but on the throw, first
baseman Kelly Wood dropped
the ball, scoring Bob DeCosta
with Stephens moving to third.
Buechele got caught in a run
down, however, and Stephens
then scored us a result of another

bungled Cal effort in the field.
In that inning, the Cards
scored four runs on but one hit.
The four errors, said Marquess,
were because of "a combination
of Card pressure and just bad
breaks."
Meanwhile the Cards were the
victims of good fortune. Bob
Boatman, originally scheduled
for the middle three innings after
Larry Kuhn, pitched five and a
third innings.
Said Marquess, "We hadn't
planned to go that far with Bob.
But we had a good lead and he
was pitching well so we decided
to let him keep pitching. He gave
up too many walks in the last
couple innings but Dotterer re
ally saved him. Anyway, because

Bob pitched so long, we can start
Brian Mignano in the next game
(this afternoon in Berkeley) and
let him go as tar as he can and
then come back with Kuhn on
Saturday."
Mignano will start today's
game in Berkeley and he, too,
will be hoping for some breaks as
Cal is tough at home and the
Cards' away record this season
has been a little less than spec
tacular.
"It will be tough. Cal is always
tough at home so it will really
depend on how Brian pitches
and on how well we hit. We re
ally broke out of a dry spell (yes
terday)," said Marquess.
Today's game at Berkeley be
gins at 2:30 p.m.

Stanford's Dave Meier laces heavy pressure as he attempts to complete the second portion of a
double play in the Cards' 9-4 victory over the Cal Bears yesterday at Sunk-en Diamond.
Second baseman Paul Zuvella looks on.
With cries of "wait till next
year" or "it's all over but the sh
outing" or even "the party's
over" dancing in their heads, the
Cards toppled the Cal Bears,
9-4, in Sunken Diamond in the
first game of their three-game
set.
The part about the cries is pure
supposition of course. But hear
ing that the Cards beat yet
another conference rival at home
is quickly becoming old hat.
This season on the road they
play like perfect guests, losing 14
out of 14 conference road games,
yet at home, they're downright
rude.
And yesterday was no excep
tion.
The Cards, playing the spoiler
role to perfection, knockcd off
the second place Bears, but it
took some clutch fielding and
hitting by Mike Dotterer and
some timely Cal errors to do it.
Dotterer came up with several
outstanding plays in the late in
nings to stave off a Bear com
eback. With the score 7-3 in the
bottom of the eighth. Dotterer
slammed a two-run homer to
widen the gap.
That roundtripper appeared
to be a gift from the Gods in the
ninth when Cal loaded the bases
with nobody out. Catcher Tom
Colburn ripped a Bob Boatman
pitch to deep left field, a sure
grand slam, or so it seemed. Dot
terer, at the very last moment,
reached up and snagged the ball,
with his mitt actually over the
fence.
"You're not going to see any
better catches than that one,"
said head coach Mark Marquess.
"Dot really saved Boatman with
the catch. And the home run re
ally helped too. Mike's going to
be an even better power hitter
the older he gets.
Much to Cal's dismay, Dot
terer was old enough yesterday.
But if Dotterer was old

enough, then Cal's fielding at
times resembled Little League
play.
With the Cards up 3-1 in the
fourth, the Bears fell apart. Mike
Toothman reached first on an in
field error to open the belated
rally. Then with two out and
runners on first and third, a pas
sed ball and a walk followed be

time a run scored.
