# Militants to rotate Yanks around Iran
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
The Iranian militants holding the
American hostages intend to rotate them
among a number of cities, sending those
with the most suspicious backgrounds to
the least pleasant locations, a Tehran
newspaper said yesterday.
The conservative newspaper Donya
Iran said the militants, who earlier this
week reported keeping the 53 hostages in
Tehran and 12 other cities, planned to
rotate them so that "American intelli
gence will be confused." The militants
began dispersing the hostages after an
aborted U.S. rescue mission April 25 that
killed eight American servicemen in the
desert 200 miles east of Tehran.
One of the American hostages has tried
to commit suicide three times and may be
dead, Italian journalist Oribna Fallaci has
reported, quoting an unidentified source.
She did not name the hostage.
Writing in the May 10 issue of the New
Republic magazine, Fallaci quoted the
source as saying the hostage who attemp
ted suicide was one of a group who had
been held in the basement of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran. She said those in the
basement were "considered unmistakably
spies, and some of them are or have been

recently tied up because they attacked the
students."
Appointment soon
President Abolhassan√üani-Sadr, who
has sought to take responsibility of the
hostages away from the militants and turn
them over to the ruling Revolutionary
Council, said he plans to name a prime
minister soon. This was seen by observers
as a move that could strengthen his mod
erate position toward the American hos
tages, in captivity IS7 days yesterday.
The Revolutionary Council has acted.as
an interim assembly and executive until
the new Parliament is set up. perhaps in
June. Iranian officials have said that deal
ing with the hostage crisis will be one of
the first items of business for parliament,
112 inal parliamentary voting will take place
today.
Bani-Sadr was asked by an Iranian re
porter what Iran planned to do before
May 17 to meet European demands for
"decisive progress" toward release of the
hostages or face economic sanctions.
Bani-Sadr reportedly told the news
man: "A lot of things can happen" before
then. He did not elaborate.
New executions
' Tehran Radio reported the execution
by a firing squad yesterday ot three per
sons. including a woman cabinet minister
who served under the ousted shah.
One was Esfand Farrokhru-Parsa.
former minister of education and training.
Tehran Radio said she had been found
guilty of "plundering public funds, causing
corruption, spreading prostitution in the
ministry of education and training, coop
eration with SAY AK (the shah's secret
police), and making education and train
ing dependent on the colonial culture of
imperialism."
Informed sources said that charges she
belonged to the Bahai faith, judged heret
ical by the radical Shiite Moslem clerics,
also weighed against her in the current
resurgence of trials and violence directed
against Iranian religious minorities.
Power struggle
Even Bani-Sadr s chief press aide felt
obliged to brush aside a plea for tolerance
from the Archbishop of Canterbury fol
lowing the assassination of the 24-vear
old son of the Anglican bishop of Iran.
Bani-Sadr is plainly try ing to impose a
new government with Khomeini's bles
sing in the hopes the clerical parliamen
tary majority would not dare challenge the
choice later. Die Islamic Republican Party
reacted sharply to the president's plan.
A leading party figure, Ayatollah Ali
Akhbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, met yester
day with Khomeini and Ayatollah Mous
savi Ardebili, a Revolutionary Council
member and prosecutor general, said of
the plan, "I do not think anything interest
ing will come out of it because the working
period of (such a) government is scry
short.
That is not expected before mid- J line,
the earliest date the parliament could take
up the fate of the 53 U.S. hostages in
keeping with Khomeini's orders.
Meanwhile, the newspaper Kayhan
published reports that 30 Revolutionary
Guards had discovered a "secret airport"
in the desert about KM) miles southeast of
Tehran.
"Signs and evidence show that a
number of helicopters and planes had
landed at this airport recently," the news
paper said. It did not actually suggest that
the site may have been the still uniden
tified "Desert Two" staging area of the
ill-fated U.S rescue operation two weeks
ago.
