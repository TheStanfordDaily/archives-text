## The 						Friday Interview A 						check with Gordy Banks 
### 
(Editor's note: Gordon Banks came to Stanford
four years ago and played on the now-defunct JV
football team. As a sophomore Banks was prom
oted to the varsity, where he was slotted as a running
back. Unfortunately for Banks, a young man named
Darrin Nelson came along and virtually spoiled his
chances at starting in the back field. The next year,
Banks was moved to flanker, and this year, as a
senior, he saw action primarily as a member of the
Cardinal special teams unit. A man of incredible
quickness, sitting on the bench has been very dif
ficult for Banks. But on the football field, as a key
member of the Stanford track team, and as a student,
Banks has made the most of his career here. Today
he speaks with Sally Jenkins in the Friday Interview.
Jenkins: There has been talk of your going out for
pro football as a free agent. Is that definite, or just a
possibility?
Banks: It's definite. Right now I am in the process
of narrowing down the clubs I'm looking at and
that have made substantial contract offers to me.
The four clubs I have narrowed it down to are Los
Angeles, Saint Louis, New Orleans, and San Fran
cisco. I hope to make a decision within the next
week or so.
Jenkins: What exactly does it mean to be a free
agent?
Banks: Basically, from my perspective it's better to
be a free agent, when you get drafted say eighth or
ninth round right on down. If I didn't get drafted
the first day, I was hoping I would go as a free
agent. Then I could pick the club that is best suited
for my talents, and I'd make about the same
amount of money as somebody who went in the
eighth, ninth or 10th round. So it's basically the
same as being drafted.
Jenkins: Isn't that a pretty big gamble? For one
thing, it seems like your size might be a disadvan
tage.
Banks: In professional football you have to have
one outstanding quality. Either you have to be big
and strong, or you have to be fast. I wasn't blessed
with being big and strong, but I was blessed with
being tremendously fast. When I look at it (quick
ness) in professional football, I think it's one of the

things that's going to make it more advantageous
for me than college football was.
Jenkins: A re you apprehensive about your ability to
compete at that level? Or are you pretty confident?
Banks: I'm confident and apprehensive. I'm very
confident that I can excel in the proper atmos
phere. But you've got to be apprehensive, espe
cially after last season, my senior season. With the
trouble that we had on that ball club, it makes you
kind of apprehensive about football in general. I'm
really looking forward to playing pro ball, it'*
something I have wanted to do for a long time, so
I'm ready to go.
Jenkins: Then / take it that it's <Ven a goal since you
were very young.
Banks: Yes. When 1 was growing up there were two
things I wanted to do. I wanted to play pro ball, and
1 wanted to be a lawyer. So I majored in political
science, and at some point in time I will go to law
school. So I have been very blessed and fortunate
that I have been able to achieve some of the goals I
set and ideals I had when I was young.
Jenkins: Do you think that not starting and just
playing on special teams affected your chances of
getting drafted?
Banks: Oh definitely. In fact, sometimes when I
think about it. it's really disheartening to me. If 1
had started, and had just a pretty good year, no
thing spectacular, just a good season. 1 would've
been drafted the first day.
Jenkins: What kind of difficulties led to your not
starting?
Banks: I don't really want to go into it. It's some
thing that has bothered me, but you can't dwell on
negative things because they tend to drag you
down. Something that has happened to you in the
past that is not positive, well, you can never get it
back. So what you have to do is take your life at
point "A," and just go ahead and make it work for
you. So I don't like to talk about it and I don't like
to dwell on it. In fact I just put it out of my mind;
take from where I am now, and make it successful.
Jenkins: Is there anybody in pro football that you
model yourself after ?
Banks: Not really. I like to pretty much do my own
thing. 1 was at Berkeley this past week. James
Lofton is a really good friend of mine. I had just run
the 200. and I ran a 20.7. I came back and a friend
of mine from Cal said. "Hey Ciordy. was that a
James Lofton imitation?" I said "No, that was a
Gordon Banks rendition." That's exactly how I
teel about it. I don't like to model myself after
anybody or try to do what they did. because that's
not fulfilling to me.
Jenkins: What role did you originally intend to fill
on the team here?
Banks: When I first came here I was very en
thusiastic about playing running back. I went
through a lot of coaching changes. When I look back
on it as a whole, it was positive, it was good. I
wanted to play running back. In fact my first year
everybody kept telling me they were going to put
me at the receiver position. I kept saying "no w v ay,
not a chance." Then when 1 finally made the move
my junior year, it was probably one of the most
positive things that ever happened to me. My
abilities are much more suited to playing wide re
ceiver than they are to play running back.
Jenkins: Do yon think that your experience on the
special teams here will help you in the pros?
(tanks: Oh yeah. All first-year rookies have to
spend time on the specialty teams, unless the club is
really poor and you are drafted first or second
round to till a special need. So my experience and
enthusiasm, I really enjoy doing it. is going to be a
great aid, much more so than almost anything else I
have done.
Jenkins: How did you manage those blocked field
goals last season? Was it something you spent a lot
of time on?
Banks: Definitely. I wanted to make a contribution

to the team. Initially I was very dejected, and I
wanted to just withdraw from the whole situation.
But 1 felt a very strong commitment to the players
and the guys I had played with for so long. I wanted
to succeed as a team as well as on a personal level.
I blocked the first one against Boston, we were
trying to preserve a shutout. Against UCLA it
wasn't a luxury, we had to block it to save the game.
And 1 had enough confidence by then because 1
had done it in practice and done it in games, so 1
really thought I could do it against UCLA. So 1 said
my prayer on the sidelines, and fortunately I
blocked it.
The only thing Rod would let me play consis
tently was specialty teams, so I really started get
ting a lot of joy out of making the first tackle on the
kickoff, or blocking kicks, which is something that
just doesn't come naturally. I've always had a lot of
confidence in my ability, so 1 said,"hey, I can do all
that," and I put all my energies into it, and I got it
done.
Jenkins: So on the whole are you satisfied with what
you did in your career here?
Banks: On the whole yes. 1 have to be very pleased
with track and field, it's really coming a long well.
Football has been good for me. I'm also very
pleased with the things I'vebeen able todoin street
clothes, without the athletic uniform. All the things
in the classroom, things I've done in the adminis
trative part of athletics, such as being on selection
committees to hire new coaches, and being on the
Stanford athletic board. Those things I incorporate
into my "career." not just how many touchdowns I
scored against Washington, or how many kickoff
returns saved the game. Those things are important
of course, but not as important as some of the
things I've done without having a football helmet
on or track spikes on.
