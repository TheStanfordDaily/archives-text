## The
						Friday Interview A
						check with Gordy Banks 
### 
(Editor's note: Gordon Banks came to Stanford
four years ago and played on the now-defunct JV
football team. As a sophomore Banks was prom
oted to the varsity, where he was slotted as a running
back. Unfortunately for Banks, a young man named
Darrin Nelson came along and virtually spoiled his
chances at starting in the back field. The next year,
Banks was moved to flanker, and this year, as a
senior, he saw action primarily as a member of the
Cardinal special teams unit. A man of incredible
quickness, sitting on the bench has been very dif
ficult for Banks. But on the football field, as a key
member of the Stanford track team, and as a student,
Banks has made the most of his career here. Today
he speaks with Sally Jenkins in the Friday Interview.
Jenkins: There has been talk of your going out for
pro football as a free agent. Is that definite, or just a
possibility?
Banks: It's definite. Right now I am in the process
of narrowing down the clubs I'm looking at and
that have made substantial contract offers to me.
The four clubs I have narrowed it down to are Los
Angeles, Saint Louis, New Orleans, and San Fran
cisco. I hope to make a decision within the next
week or so.
Jenkins: What exactly does it mean to be a free
agent?
Banks: Basically, from my perspective it's better to
be a free agent, when you get drafted say eighth or
ninth round right on down. If I didn't get drafted
the first day, I was hoping I would go as a free
agent. Then I could pick the club that is best suited
for my talents, and I'd make about the same
amount of money as somebody who went in the
eighth, ninth or 10th round. So it's basically the
same as being drafted.
Jenkins: Isn't that a pretty big gamble? For one
thing, it seems like your size might be a disadvan
tage.
Banks: In professional football you have to have
one outstanding quality. Either you have to be big
and strong, or you have to be fast. I wasn't blessed
with being big and strong, but I was blessed with
being tremendously fast. When I look at it (quick
ness) in professional football, I think it's one of the

things that's going to make it more advantageous
for me than college football was.
Jenkins: A re you apprehensive about your ability to
compete at that level? Or are you pretty confident?
Banks: I'm confident and apprehensive. I'm very
confident that I can excel in the proper atmos
phere. But you've got to be apprehensive, espe
cially after last season, my senior season. With the
trouble that we had on that ball club, it makes you
kind of apprehensive about football in general. I'm
really looking forward to playing pro ball, it'*
something I have wanted to do for a long time, so
I'm ready to go.
Jenkins: Then / take it that it's <Ven a goal since you
were very young.
Banks: Yes. When 1 was growing up there were two
things I wanted to do. I wanted to play pro ball, and
1 wanted to be a lawyer. So I majored in political
science, and at some point in time I will go to law
school. So I have been very blessed and fortunate
that I have been able to achieve some of the goals I
set and ideals I had when I was young.
Jenkins: Do you think that not starting and just
playing on special teams affected your chances of
getting drafted?
Banks: Oh definitely. In fact, sometimes when I
think about it. it's really disheartening to me. If 1
had started, and had just a pretty good year, no
thing spectacular, just a good season. 1 would've
been drafted the first day.
Jenkins: What kind of difficulties led to your not
starting?
Banks: I don't really want to go into it. It's some
thing that has bothered me, but you can't dwell on
negative things because they tend to drag you
down. Something that has happened to you in the
past that is not positive, well, you can never get it
back. So what you have to do is take your life at
point "A," and just go ahead and make it work for
you. So I don't like to talk about it and I don't like
to dwell on it. In fact I just put it out of my mind;
take from where I am now, and make it successful.
Jenkins: Is there anybody in pro football that you
model yourself after ?
Banks: Not really. I like to pretty much do my own
