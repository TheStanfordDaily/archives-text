### Val Vaden Staff Writer 
I he two nationally-ranked teams had been on a collision course all
year long.
And when the sand was finally settled, the greens were finally
cleared and the scores were finally tallied, the San Jose State women
golfers were the victors over second-place Stanford in the Northern
California Women's Golf Championships at the Stanford Golf
Course yesterday.
The tournament, a two-day, 36-hole event, began here
Tuesday. In addition to the Cards and San Jose, the Sacramento State
women played, but they finished a distant third.
Indi\ iduallv, the Stanford women did fairly well. The No. 1 player
for the women, junior Linda Bowman, finished a close third, just 3
strokes back from the winning total. The first two places were cap
tured by San Jose State women, one an All-America.
Another Stanford golfer, freshman Joanne Pacillo, currently the
No. 1 ranked junior player in the country, finished fifth.
| The women's coach, Tim Baldwin, seemed fairly pleased with his
1 team'sperformnce. He did allow that. "The team is disappointed, but
|players always get more down than the coach."
He admitted that. "We had been pointing, in the last two weeks, to
'beating San Jose State tor the first time ever." But. he continued, "a
jcouple of our key players didn't play up to their ability. And San Jose
State's top four played exceptionally well."
Sa/i Jose and Stanford had met several times before this year, once
Jin a tournament identical to the NorCal Championships. In that one
May they tied.
i A little over a week ago. at the Southern Intercollegiate Women's
-Golf Tournament in Georgia, the Stanford women had. as Baldwin
>put it. "lavat San Jose quite soundly on the last day.
t "We had been looking forward to and anticipating beating San
tfose State." he went on.
t But alas, it was not to be.
Even so, the Stanford women are not looking backward, doting on
the past. In tact, Baldwin noted, "we are now pointing toward the
AIAW National Tournament in Alberquerque next month."
t That tournament plays host to only the elite of women's golf, the
top twenty-five teams in the country. Stanford, in Baldwin's estima
tion. "is easily in the top fifteen nationwide."
