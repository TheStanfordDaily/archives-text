LOS ANGELES (AP) — The
Los Angeles Lakers no longer
have the homecourt advantage
in their National Basketball As
sociation championship series
with the Philadelphia 76ers —
the best-of-seven series now tied
at one game each.
The Lakers now face two
games in Philadelphia after the
split in Los Angeles — and will
be shorthanded due to the sus
pension of Spencer Haywood —
but the players certainly don't
appear troubled.
"We know we are better." said
Los Angeles forward Jim
Chones. "And we know we can
win on the road in the playoffs.
We did it against Phoenix and we
did it against Seattle."
The 76ers "did it" most re
cently. however, beating the
Lakers 107-104 at the Forum in
Wednesday night's second game
of the series.
"They deserved to win,"
Chones said. "But you watch,
we'll play better in Philly."
The 76ers' Julius Erving. who
scored 23 points Wednesday

night, has a different outlook,
saying: "We've got the
homecourt advantage and we're
going to hold on to it."
The fourth and fifth games will
be played Saturday and Sunday
in the Spectrum, with both con
tests in the afternoon.
Darryl Dawkins, who had a
team-high 25 points for
Philadelphia in the second game
alter he scored just 12 points in
the opening 109-102 loss, said:
"We're going home a much bet
ter team. 1 said Sunday that this
would be a seven-game series,
but we'd like to get it over before
that."
The Lakers' Ervin "Magic"
Johnson said he doesn't expect a
replay of Game I wo. The 76ers
led at one time bv 23 points and
were up 89-71 heading into the
final quarter before the Lakers
rallied to cut the difference to
99-98 with 2:26 to play. With the
7 6ers ahead 105-104 and seven
seconds remaining, Bobby Jones
sank a 12-foot jumper to provide
the final margin.
"Their guards shot well when
we were double-teaming Dr. J,

they just knocked us down,"
Johnson said of Philadelphia's
early hot shooting.
Guard Maurice Cheeks of the
76ers, often free when the Laker
defense concentrated on Erving,
hit 11 of 13 floor shots and
scored 23 points.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 38
points for Los Angeles, hut the
Lakers were hurt by off-nights
from their guards Norm Nixon
(einht points) and Johnson (13).
The Lakers make the trip
without Haywood, who has been
unhappy about being a lightly
used reserve with Los Angeles
after stardom through much of
his 10 NBA seasons. He was sus
pended by Lakers Coach Paul
Westhead after Wednesday
night's game for "activities dis
ruptive to the team."
Finger to Hall of Fame
Charles "Bud" Finger, the
club professional at the Stanford
Golf Course and former coach of
the Cardinals, has been selected
for induction into the Golf
Coaches Association of America
Hall of Fame.
