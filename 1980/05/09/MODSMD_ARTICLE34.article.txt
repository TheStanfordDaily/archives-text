Sixteen of Stanford's top

Heading the list of Card

Gary Bruner in the javelin. Buss
leads the team in the hammer
with a toss of 219-3, while
Thomson checks in second at

100- and 200-meter dashes

and a 21.1 200. Bruner's hest ef
fort in the javelin this vear was
243-6.
The Cards will also field relay
teams in the 400, 1600 and
two-mile distances.
"This is an outstanding event
each year," said Stanford head
coach Brooks Johnson, "and I'm

sure the competition will he as
strong as ever."
The Cards, who ended the
1980 dual meet season last
Saturday with a 1 13-41 drubbing
by California at Berkeley, pro
duced some strong efforts de
spite having their record drop
ped to 4-4.
Banks, a senior appearing in
his last dual meet for Stanford,
was clocked at y personal best in
winning the'2oo meters, and
posted a seasonal best by taking
third in the 100 (10.5). He also
anchored the 1600-meter relay
team that registered a winning
time of 3:12.4.
Johnson was pleased by the
winning efforts of Buss in the
hammer (217-5), John Schaer in
the 1500 (3.50.2), Bill Halde
man in the 3000-meter steep
lechase (9:00.2), and Bruner in
the javelin (209-10).
"1 don't think the score (of last

weekend's meet) was a surprise
or disappointment for us,"
Johnson said. "Our goal was to
compete well, and that essen
tially happened. This season I
think we've covered a lot of
ground that we wanted to."
