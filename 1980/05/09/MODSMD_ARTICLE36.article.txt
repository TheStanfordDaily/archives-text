The Stanford Women's Classic track meet takes place this after
noon at Stanford Stadium beginning at 1 p.m. On hand will he about
nine Card competitors, collegiate teams from UC-Berkeley and Cal
Poly-San Luis Obispo and numerous unattached entrants.
"We wanted to use this year as the groundwork for bigger meets in
the future," said Card coach Laurel Treon. Unfortunately, defending
national champion Cal State-Northridge cancelled out of the meet at
the last moment to attend an invitational in Southern California.
For the Cards, today's contest marks their season finale, with the
exception ot the AI AW Championships in Oregon in two weeks. For
the most part, they will be striving to improve upon personal stan
dards. "The competition will be good for us," Treon stressed.
Pam Donald, Kim Schnurpfeil and Mary Osborne are the three
Cardinals who have already qualified for the AIA Ws. Donald will be
looking to better the school records and personal bests in the long
jump and the 100 and 200 meter dashes, which she established at last
week's Nor Cal Championships.
Schnurpfeil will likewise attempt to quicken her 3000 meter time.
"The 3000 will be a good race," Treon contended. Osborne, how
ever. will be relatively unchallenged in the javelin and will toss the
discus, as well.
Johnna Hanson, coming off "amazing drops" in time, according to
Treon, will compete in the 400 meter hurdles. She will be sorely
tested by the presence of former national and internatonal hurdler,
Deanne Johnson, representing the Stanford Track Club.
Robin Campbell, another member of the Stanford Track Club and
among the top 400 and 800 meter dashers in the country, will also be
in attendance.
Several individuals will be participating from Canada, Iceland,
DeAnza. Millbrae and Davis.
