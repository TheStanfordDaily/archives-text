•ss<. originally written for diffe
rent audiences, lacks uniform
Jkticulty and at times may risk

insulting readers. Attempting to
make a point clear, Sagan writes,
"Our planet turns. When it is
midday at one spot on the earth it
is the dead of night on the other
side." A child may need this exp
lanation. hut those attempting
this 347-page book probably
would not.
Sections of other essays may
be too technical for anyone lack
ing Sagan's love of science to ap
preciate. Do we care that the la
tent heat of fusion of rock is
about 4 .10" erg/gram? A few
essays might he better elimi
nated altogether. These include
a complicated rebuttal to a
theory of world collisions that
even Science magazine termed
"somewhat technical." and an
overly detailed criticism of a
numerologist who claims to be
God. Skipping these is advised.
For the most part. Broca's
Bruin should fascinate readers
interested in science, and the
writing is usually simple and
straightforward. At times, how
ever. the essays suffer from too
much description and could be
pruned to bare the major points:
One becomes lost in trivialities
about Spock's ears and the
etymology of "manna."
What makes most of the essays
enjoyable is Sagan's pervasive
enthusiasm for discovery 'We
are an intelligent species and the
use of our intelligence quite
properK gives us pleasure. In
this respect the brain is like a
muscle. When we think well, we
feel good." Here is a man ever in
awe at the wonders of science
who calls the world's realities
more "subtle, intricate and awe
some" than any science fiction.
In "Sense and nonsense at the
edge of science." Sagan ap
proaches the pseudosciences
with an open mind in search of
evidence. He examines a horse
that performs addition, astral
projection and UFOs and un
covers much sorcery but little
proof to back any claims. A per
sonal account of precognitive
dreaming makes hjs conclusions
clear: "Many years ago I awoke
in the dead of night in a cold
sweat, with the certain know
ledge that a close relative had
suddenlv died. 1 was so gripped
with the haunting intensity of the
experience that I was afraid to

place a long-distance phone call,
for fear that the relative would
trip over the telephone cord . . .
In fact, the relative is alive and
well."
Sagan plays no favorites, and
in "A Sunday sermon," with tact
and caution he proceeds to tear
apart proofs that pruport to show
the existence of God. Later he
acknowledges that "whether we
believe in God depends very
much on what we mean by God.'"
Some of Sagan's own conjec
tures lack substantiation, and
when he steps out of his field of
knowledge the hypotheses are
likely to be mere wondering
aloud.
For example. Sagan suggests
that the Big Bang theory, which
describes the sudden appearance
of the univ erse in a flash of light
and heat, is related to the human
birth experience. His thought is
that birth, like the Big Bang, in

volves an abrupt beginning and
an emergence from irkness
into light.
Thus he infers that the ideas of
Big Bang advocates may be in
fluenced by the experiences they
had at birth. He writes, "The
possible connection between
psychiatry and cosmology seems
very real." In this reviewer's
opinion it seems very silly.
Sagan's overall optimism also
colors speculation about the fu
ture of mankind, although Sagan
acknowledges the menace of
nuclear weapons, fluorocarbons
and population growth. With
luck and careful choices we can
avoid annihilation, and instead
experience the excitement of the
transitional period when man
reaches out to the planets and
beyond, in his words, "an age of
exploration and discovery un
paralleled since the Renais
sance."

For the most part. Broca's
Bruin should fascinate readers

writing is usually simple and
straightforward. At times, how
ever. the essays suffer from too
much description and could be

One becomes lost in trivialities
about Spock's ears and the
etymology of "manna."
What makes most of the essays
enjoyable is Sagan's pervasive
enthusiasm for discovery 'We
are an intelligent species and the
use of our intelligence quite
properK gives us pleasure. In
this respect the brain is like a
muscle. When we think well, we
feel good." Here is a man ever in
awe at the wonders of science
who calls the world's realities
more "subtle, intricate and awe
some" than any science fiction.
In "Sense and nonsense at the
edge of science." Sagan ap
proaches the pseudosciences
with an open mind in search of
evidence. He examines a horse
that performs addition, astral
projection and UFOs and un
covers much sorcery but little
proof to back any claims. A per
sonal account of precognitive
dreaming makes hjs conclusions
clear: "Many years ago I awoke
in the dead of night in a cold
sweat, with the certain know
ledge that a close relative had
suddenlv died. 1 was so gripped
with the haunting intensity of the
experience that I was afraid to

place a long-distance phone call,
for fear that the relative would
trip over the telephone cord . . .
In fact, the relative is alive and
well."
Sagan plays no favorites, and
in "A Sunday sermon," with tact
and caution he proceeds to tear
apart proofs that pruport to show
the existence of God. Later he
acknowledges that "whether we
believe in God depends very
much on what we mean by God.'"
Some of Sagan's own conjec
tures lack substantiation, and
when he steps out of his field of
knowledge the hypotheses are
likely to be mere wondering
aloud.
For example. Sagan suggests
that the Big Bang theory, which
describes the sudden appearance
of the univ erse in a flash of light
and heat, is related to the human
birth experience. His thought is
that birth, like the Big Bang, in

volves an abrupt beginning and
an emergence from irkness
into light.
Thus he infers that the ideas of
Big Bang advocates may be in
fluenced by the experiences they
had at birth. He writes, "The
possible connection between
psychiatry and cosmology seems
very real." In this reviewer's
opinion it seems very silly.
Sagan's overall optimism also
colors speculation about the fu
ture of mankind, although Sagan
acknowledges the menace of
nuclear weapons, fluorocarbons
and population growth. With
luck and careful choices we can
avoid annihilation, and instead
experience the excitement of the
transitional period when man
reaches out to the planets and
beyond, in his words, "an age of
exploration and discovery un
paralleled since the Renais
sance."
