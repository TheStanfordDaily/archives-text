I Watership Down *
New Varsity, Palo Alto, tomorrow
and Sunday
Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a movie most not
able for its lack of distinction — I'd
take Bugs Bunny over these
lackluster rabbits any day. Director
Martin Rosen has bragged in inter
views that he knew nothing about
I animation before undertaking
Watership Down, and it shows in
every institutionally colored frame.
This is one of those attempts at
whimsy why:h, instead of waking
! you up, makes you leave the thea
ter feeling as if you've slept all night
with your mouth open.
—Jim Mattson
Rocky II ★ * *
Sunday, Mem Aud 7 & 9:30 p.m.
This may sound weird, but
Rocky II manages to recapture
I most of what made the original ap
pealing. The plot's not so much a
rematch as a remake, with the orig
inal's situations brought out for
another round, but this movie has
enough genuine warmth — and, by
the end, excitement — to glide over
the weak spots. Sylvester Stallone
again stars as Rocky Balboa, and
the rest of the original's cast is back
again, too.

Being There ★ ★ ★
Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be
ing, in this comedy directed by Hal
Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife who is desperately seeking for
affection) but the film drags on as
we see more and more people be
taken in by Chance's one quality:
his ability to make people see in
him whatever they want — as
Chance rises by accident and in
spite of himself comes to the brink
of becoming the president of the
U.S.
The film is a cut against corrup
tion in politics, the generation
mesmerised by television and
empty metaphors about the sea
sons. .

Clockwork Orange * * * *
Old Mill, midnight weekend spe
cial
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual film.
Clockwork Orange is a morality
play set in the nearfuture; the issue
at stake is whether individuality is
more important than the society
that must deal with the individual.

Malcolm McDowell stars as a man
whose joy comes mainly from
cortimitting acts of violence; he is
arrested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this sin
gularly disturbing film.

The Lord of the Rings *
New Varsity, Palo Alto, tomorrow
and Sunday
One of last year's most promising
movies turns out to be one of its
most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the Cat
and Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with rudely
re-dyed live action, is less Tolkien
than tacky. The lowest blow is the
movie's ending: after more than
two hours we are informed that this
is One — come back in
a year or so fot more details.

Manhattan
New Varsity, Palo Alto, Thursday
S'Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his '70s
trilogy with a movie that will rank
as one of the few masterpieces of
the last decade. Manhattan is a bit
terly funny examination of a city
and a lifestyle. It bites close enough
to the bone to be both hilarious and
oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen, Diane Keaton,
Michael Murphy, Mariel Heming
way and Meryl Streep. Written by
Woody Allen and Marshall
Brickman. Photography by Gor
don Willis. Music by George Ger
shwin.
—J.M.
Annie Hall * * * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto, Thursday
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian with
No-Doz mannerisms 'and a
masochistic wit. Roughly directed,
with a whiney, indulgent tone and a
vaguely disturbing aftertaste. In
short, the best movie Woody Allen
has ever made. For all of their
strengths, Allen films until Annie
had been exercises in comic over
kill. They never let up. and eventu
ally, albeit guiltily, we wish he
would shut up for a minute; Annie
is different in that it lets the ribs rest
from time to time. To use a wildly
revealing phrase, this is a movie
with depth.
—John Nielsen
Yanks * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto tonight
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a brief high, but it
quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasurable
sweetness but little heat. Plots

about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often provided
fertile movie ground, but director
John Schlesinger. armed with a
skilled crew and healthy budget,
manages only to exhibit the genre's
limitations. Lisa Eichhorn and
Richard Gere, the young lovers,
have the best of it here; they both at
least deliver emotions that strike
you. Despite the likeability of the
performers, the Vanessa
Redgrave-William Devane sequ
ences probably should have been
scrapped; the only point of contrast
made is that they are older and less
naive than Eichhorn and Gere.
Limp lyricism; no magic.
— Ron Lillejord

Julia * * * *
New Varsity, tonight
Director Fred Zinnemann's
superb craftsmanship and com
plete and purposeful intelligence
dominate this movie about friend
ship and its responsibilities. Jane
Fonda and Vanessa Redgrave star
in this true story based on a chapter
from Lillian Hellman's autobiog
raphical book Pentimento. Both
are brilliant; Fonda effectively cap
tures Hellman's spirited personal
ity, and Redgrave delivers a fine,
understated performance as the
idealistic Julia.

The Thin Man ★ ★ ★ ★
Friday, Kresge 8 p.m.
This stylish '30s detective story
was based on the book by Dashiell

Hammett. William Powell and
Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora
Charles, a couple who try not to let
Nick's duties as a detective get in
the way of their entertaining. The
plot has enough twists and false
leads to keep everyone guessing;
and the denouement, with all sus
pects gathered together, is a classic.
W.S. Van Dyke directed, and
James Wong Howe is responsible
for the slick photography. After the
Thin Man makes up the second half
of Friday's double feature.

The War at Home Itiritir
Surf Theater, San Francisco
The Vietnam anti-war move-

ment's answer to John Wayne and
Joe. You can see this documentary
on unrest at the University of Wis
consin and wallow in nostalgia and
then come home and put on the
Youngbloods or Jefferson
Airplane and wallow some more,
and think about why things have
changed and how they can change
back. Perfect for the '60s freak.
— Seth Zuckerman
Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the
movie that combines big-time stars
(Malcolm McDowell, Peter
O'Toole) with hard-core sex (you
name it). Unfortunately, these two
groups are mutually exclusive and
the audience never learns if
O'Toole is truly deserving of his

surname. This overly violent movie
purports to tell a story of ancient
Rome, but is really about the calcu
lations of buck-hungry magazine
publishers attempting one of his
tory's greatest tie-ins: a moving,
grunting Penthouse. If you want
ancient Rome, watch Ben Hur on
TV. If you want porn, take Caligu
la's $6.00 admission tag and see 24
quarter peep shows. As entertain
ment, Caligula doesn't deliver, and
as art, it is vile.
— Bruce Handy
Chapter Two ★★
Park, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-

aged widower boy (James Caan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate, there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody self. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.
— Shari Folz
Electric Horseman ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this

Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $1 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.
— R.L.
All Thai Jazz Ifklf
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man w ho's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All That Jazz It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized
— R.L.
Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★ */2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than TV ★
Guano

But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat tor its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Hair ****
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe- i
rial
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy vision of America, but even in
those terms, Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

Sorma Rae ★★★★
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who I
fights to have a union put in a tex
tile mill where she works. Sally
Field gives an assured and very
likeable performance as Norma
Rae; her days as"the Flying Nun"
seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on charac
terization than on action. Ron
Liebman co-stars as a New York
union agitator
—J M |
The Spy Who Loved Me ★★★
Tivoli, San Carlos
Even Roger Moore — the low
rent version of James Bond —can't
do much damage to this dazzling
007 thriller. The special effects and
stunts are superb (indeed, after the
first stunt, everything that follows
is almost anticlimactic.) The
Moore-Barbara Bach pairing work
quite well; Bach is easily Moore's
equal, and she adds some tension
and humor to the formulaic brew. I
With Richard Kiel as "Jaws," a
character 1 hope will go away.

The Lord of the Rings *
New Varsity, Palo Alto, tomorrow
and Sunday
One of last year's most promising
movies turns out to be one of its
most disappointing. Director
Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the Cat
and Wizards) adds one or two nice
scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with rudely
re-dyed live action, is less Tolkien
than tacky. The lowest blow is the
movie's ending: after more than
two hours we are informed that this
is One — come back in
a year or so fot more details.

Woody Allen completes his '70s

New Varsity, Palo Alto, Thursday
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian with
No-Doz mannerisms 'and a
masochistic wit. Roughly directed,
with a whiney, indulgent tone and a
vaguely disturbing aftertaste. In
short, the best movie Woody Allen
has ever made. For all of their
strengths, Allen films until Annie
had been exercises in comic over
kill. They never let up. and eventu
ally, albeit guiltily, we wish he
would shut up for a minute; Annie
is different in that it lets the ribs rest
from time to time. To use a wildly
revealing phrase, this is a movie
with depth.

Yanks * *
New Varsity, Palo Alto tonight
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a brief high, but it
quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasurable
sweetness but little heat. Plots

about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often provided
fertile movie ground, but director
John Schlesinger. armed with a
skilled crew and healthy budget,
manages only to exhibit the genre's
limitations. Lisa Eichhorn and
Richard Gere, the young lovers,
have the best of it here; they both at
least deliver emotions that strike
you. Despite the likeability of the
performers, the Vanessa
Redgrave-William Devane sequ
ences probably should have been
scrapped; the only point of contrast
made is that they are older and less
naive than Eichhorn and Gere.
Limp lyricism; no magic.

The Thin Man ★ ★ ★ ★
Friday, Kresge 8 p.m.
This stylish '30s detective story
was based on the book by Dashiell

Hammett. William Powell and
Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora
Charles, a couple who try not to let
Nick's duties as a detective get in
the way of their entertaining. The
plot has enough twists and false
leads to keep everyone guessing;
and the denouement, with all sus

W.S. Van Dyke directed, and
James Wong Howe is responsible
for the slick photography. After the

Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the
movie that combines big-time stars
(Malcolm McDowell, Peter
O'Toole) with hard-core sex (you
name it). Unfortunately, these two
groups are mutually exclusive and
the audience never learns if
O'Toole is truly deserving of his

surname. This overly violent movie
purports to tell a story of ancient
Rome, but is really about the calcu
lations of buck-hungry magazine
publishers attempting one of his
tory's greatest tie-ins: a moving,
grunting Penthouse. If you want
ancient Rome, watch Ben Hur on
TV. If you want porn, take Caligu
la's $6.00 admission tag and see 24
quarter peep shows. As entertain
ment, Caligula doesn't deliver, and
as art, it is vile.

Park, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-

aged widower boy (James Caan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate, there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody self. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.

Electric Horseman ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this

Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $1 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

All Thai Jazz Ifklf
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man w ho's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All That Jazz It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than TV ★
Guano

But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat tor its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co

the work of cinematographer Nes

A great musical fantasy that's

seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a

Peter Sellers stars as the empty

There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as

New Varsity, Palo Alto tonight
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a brief high, but it
quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasurable
sweetness but little heat. Plots

about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often provided
fertile movie ground, but director
John Schlesinger. armed with a
skilled crew and healthy budget,
manages only to exhibit the genre's
limitations. Lisa Eichhorn and
Richard Gere, the young lovers,
have the best of it here; they both at
least deliver emotions that strike
you. Despite the likeability of the
performers, the Vanessa
Redgrave-William Devane sequ
ences probably should have been
scrapped; the only point of contrast
made is that they are older and less
naive than Eichhorn and Gere.
Limp lyricism; no magic.

The Thin Man ★ ★ ★ ★
Friday, Kresge 8 p.m.
This stylish '30s detective story
was based on the book by Dashiell

Hammett. William Powell and
Myrna Loy play Nick and Nora
Charles, a couple who try not to let
Nick's duties as a detective get in
the way of their entertaining. The
plot has enough twists and false
leads to keep everyone guessing;
and the denouement, with all sus

W.S. Van Dyke directed, and
James Wong Howe is responsible

The War at Home Itiritir

on unrest at the University of Wis

Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the
movie that combines big-time stars
(Malcolm McDowell, Peter
O'Toole) with hard-core sex (you
name it). Unfortunately, these two
groups are mutually exclusive and
the audience never learns if
O'Toole is truly deserving of his

surname. This overly violent movie
purports to tell a story of ancient
Rome, but is really about the calcu
lations of buck-hungry magazine
publishers attempting one of his
tory's greatest tie-ins: a moving,
grunting Penthouse. If you want
ancient Rome, watch Ben Hur on
TV. If you want porn, take Caligu
la's $6.00 admission tag and see 24
quarter peep shows. As entertain
ment, Caligula doesn't deliver, and
as art, it is vile.

Chapter Two ★★
Park, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-

aged widower boy (James Caan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate, there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody self. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.

Electric Horseman ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this

Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $1 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

All Thai Jazz Ifklf
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man w ho's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All That Jazz It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★ */2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than TV ★
Guano

But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat tor its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co

the work of cinematographer Nes

A great musical fantasy that's

Milos Forman (One Flew Over the

fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s

Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust

likeable performance as Norma

seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a

Even Roger Moore — the low

New Varsity, Palo Alto, tomorrow

Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a movie most not

take Bugs Bunny over these

Martin Rosen has bragged in inter

Watership Down, and it shows in

Peter Sellers stars as the empty

lacks the emotion and interest to

novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife who is desperately seeking for
affection) but the film drags on as
we see more and more people be

his ability to make people see in
him whatever they want — as
Chance rises by accident and in
spite of himself comes to the brink
of becoming the president of the

Clockwork Orange is a morality
play set in the nearfuture; the issue
at stake is whether individuality is
more important than the society
that must deal with the individual.

Malcolm McDowell stars as a man
whose joy comes mainly from
cortimitting acts of violence; he is
arrested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this sin
gularly disturbing film.

One of last year's most promising

than tacky. The lowest blow is the
movie's ending: after more than
two hours we are informed that this
is One — come back in
a year or so fot more details.

Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the
movie that combines big-time stars
(Malcolm McDowell, Peter
O'Toole) with hard-core sex (you
name it). Unfortunately, these two
groups are mutually exclusive and
the audience never learns if
O'Toole is truly deserving of his

surname. This overly violent movie
purports to tell a story of ancient
Rome, but is really about the calcu
lations of buck-hungry magazine
publishers attempting one of his
tory's greatest tie-ins: a moving,
grunting Penthouse. If you want
ancient Rome, watch Ben Hur on
TV. If you want porn, take Caligu
la's $6.00 admission tag and see 24
quarter peep shows. As entertain
ment, Caligula doesn't deliver, and
as art, it is vile.

Chapter Two ★★
Park, Menlo Park
Neil Simon at his most Simones
que — middle-aged divorcee girl
(Marsha Mason) meets middle-

aged widower boy (James Caan);
they fall in love, they marry, they
have problems, they resolve them,
they live happily ever after.
(Yawn.) But, like the previews in
dicate, there are plenty of fairly
good one-liners and even a mo
ment here or there that could be
called touching. Mason is her old
goody-goody self. Caan should
probably stick to his macho roles,
but the movie's worth a free night
(if any of us ever had one). A good
one for Mom and Dad.

Electric Horseman ★★★
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this

Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $1 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

All Thai Jazz Ifklf
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man w ho's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All That Jazz It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★ */2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than TV ★
Guano

But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat tor its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes

Old Mill, weekend midnight spe- i

A great musical fantasy that's

Milos Forman (One Flew Over the

in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s

Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust

likeable performance as Norma

seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small

The Spy Who Loved Me ★★★
Tivoli, San Carlos
Even Roger Moore — the low

New Varsity, Palo Alto, tomorrow

Richard Adams' bunny epic has
been turned into a movie most not

take Bugs Bunny over these

Martin Rosen has bragged in inter

Old Mill
Peter Sellers stars as the empty
headed Chance, a gardener who
lacks the emotion and interest to
make him a believable human be

Ashby based on Jerzy Kosinski's
novel with the same title.
There are some good perfor
mances by Melvyn Douglas (as
Rand, a dying and lonely magnate)
and Shirley MacLaine (as Rand's
wife who is desperately seeking for
affection) but the film drags on as
we see more and more people be

his ability to make people see in
him whatever they want — as
Chance rises by accident and in
spite of himself comes to the brink
of becoming the president of the

Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual film.
Clockwork Orange is a morality
play set in the nearfuture; the issue
at stake is whether individuality is
more important than the society
that must deal with the individual.

Malcolm McDowell stars as a man
whose joy comes mainly from
cortimitting acts of violence; he is
arrested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this sin
gularly disturbing film.

New Varsity, Palo Alto, tomorrow

One of last year's most promising
movies turns out to be one of its

Ralph Bakshi (who did Fritz the Cat

scenes, but the look of this film,
which mixes animation with rudely
re-dyed live action, is less Tolkien
than tacky. The lowest blow is the
movie's ending: after more than
two hours we are informed that this
is One — come back in
a year or so fot more details.

New Varsity, Palo Alto tonight
Like a short hit of nitrous oxide
— gives you a brief high, but it
quickly wears off. A nostalgia trip
that withers in its sentimentality,
providing a sometimes pleasurable
sweetness but little heat. Plots

about lovers "caught in the
maelstrom" of war (in this case
World War II) have often provided
fertile movie ground, but director
John Schlesinger. armed with a
skilled crew and healthy budget,
manages only to exhibit the genre's
limitations. Lisa Eichhorn and
Richard Gere, the young lovers,
have the best of it here; they both at
least deliver emotions that strike
you. Despite the likeability of the
performers, the Vanessa
Redgrave-William Devane sequ
ences probably should have been

made is that they are older and less
naive than Eichhorn and Gere.

nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this

Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle. Faded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $1 2 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course, Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and, despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that.

All Thai Jazz Ifklf
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly, the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious, but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon, the Fosse character played
by Roy Scheider. You often feel as
though you're intruding on this
sometimes strongly personal film.
Scheider successfully captures a
man w ho's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent, but he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequences typify All That Jazz It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequ
ence with borders on self-parody.
But Fosse's instincts have a genius
of their own; he must have realized

Kramer vs. Kramer ★★★ */2
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngster of almost
frightening correct instincts named
Justin Henry as the movie's heart,
Benton constructs a moving, com
passionate. almost Truffaut-like
character study of a divorced man's
struggle to love and care for his son
(and vice versa).

Excellent ★★★★
Good ★★★
Fair ★★
Better than TV ★
Guano

But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat tor its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander co
stars and the superb composition is
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

Hair ****
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe- i
rial
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky visual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timeless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit of the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy vision of America, but even in
those terms, Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

Sorma Rae ★★★★
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who I
fights to have a union put in a tex
tile mill where she works. Sally
Field gives an assured and very
likeable performance as Norma
Rae; her days as"the Flying Nun"
seem far behind as she breathes life
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaited character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on charac
terization than on action. Ron
Liebman co-stars as a New York
union agitator

The Spy Who Loved Me ★★★
Tivoli, San Carlos
Even Roger Moore — the low
rent version of James Bond —can't
do much damage to this dazzling
007 thriller. The special effects and
stunts are superb (indeed, after the
first stunt, everything that follows
is almost anticlimactic.) The
Moore-Barbara Bach pairing work
quite well; Bach is easily Moore's
equal, and she adds some tension
and humor to the formulaic brew. I
With Richard Kiel as "Jaws," a
character 1 hope will go away.
