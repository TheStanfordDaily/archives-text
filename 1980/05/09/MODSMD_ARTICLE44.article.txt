Major backers irked at PBS film
WASHINGTON — The Public Broadcasting Ser
vice. unvielding in its decision to air a film vehemently
protested by the Saudi Arabian government, yesterday
found itself at odds with two of its major benefactors:
Congress and the Mobil Oil Corp.
Mobil, a partner in oil with Saudi Arabia, fx night ads
in major newspapers urging PBS to "review" its deci
sion in light of" what is in the best interest ol the I nited
Suites." Mobil gives more than $3 million annually to
public broadcasting.
At the same time, the powerful members of Con
gress — which also funds PBS — registered objections
to the film and urged that it not be shown Monday as
scheduled. Rep. Clement Zablocki (D-W'is.), and
Rep. William Broomfield (R-Mich.). accused PBS of
using p<x>r judgement in deciding to air the tflm.
Zablocki is chairman and Broomfield the ranking
Republican on the 1 louse Foreign Affairs Committee.

llie actions came as the State Department yester
day forwarded to I'HS a formal letter of protest about
the film — Death of a Princess — from the Saudi
\rabian gin eminent.
Lite Saudi ambassador to the United Suites, in a
public statement late yesterday, sounded a further
ominous note in the controversy: " ITie timing ot the
showing nl the film in the present period," the state
ment said. "makes clear it is part of the continuing and
recentlv stepped-up effort to undermine the interna
tionally significitnt relationship between the United
States'* and Saudi Arabia.
In the face of this barrage, a spokesman s«ud PBS
had no plans to change its mind. "We stand by the
integrity of the broadcast and plan to air it as
scheduled." the spokesman said.
Neither Mobil nor the two congressmen directly
threatened PUS' funds. But the implications of the
criticisms raised again questions about public broad
casting's financial structure and its potential vulnerabil
ity to pressure.
Bilingual program bill hits snag
SACRAMENTO — A bill, opposed by Hispanic
legislators and the Brown administration, that would
cut back the state's bilingual education program stilled
yesterday in the Assembly's money committee.
Assembly man Dennis Mangers' A 82450 was
\otcd down 7-N. with 11 votes needed for passage in
the Assembly Ways and Means Committee.
Mangers (D-Huntington Beach), indicated he
would make another try for passage at a later date.
Although Mangers called it a "nunlest" modifica
tion of the 1976 bilingual law. the measure came under
intense questioning by committee members concerned
that it went ux> tar.
Mangers' bill would have eliminated a requirement
ot bilingual teachers for students who spoke some
English, but weren't fluent in it.
It would also require that students from families
where a language other than English was spoken be
tested in both languages before being placed in a
bilingual program. Currently, such students are
routinely placed in bilingual classrooms.
Under Mangers' bill, fewer bilingual classes and
teachers would be required. The Waysand Means stall
an;dyss estimated Mangers' guidelines would elimi
nate 59,500 of the 390.0(H) children currently in the
program.
