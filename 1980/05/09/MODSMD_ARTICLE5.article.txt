# First round draw results expected today
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
The results of the 1980 Spring Housing Draw will be
posted today in residence offices and the housing
office.
Round-two housing cards, also to be distributed
today, must be returned by Tuesday May 13, at 5 p.m.
Cutoff numbers ranged from a male 186 for 558
Mayfield and a female 232 for Lamda Nu, while a
male 4180 or female 4962 is all that is needed for
Manzanita Park.
The round one cut-off number for entering the
assignable pool was 4542 for guaranteed men and 64
for unguaranteed women.
Round one assignments are not final. All students
must enter round two.
June
According to Housing Office Supervisor Jean
Kitaji, round-two results will come out in early June.
The specific date depends upon card inaccuracies and
computer programming problems.
Although 3997 students entered the draw this
year, only 2646 spaces are available in the system.

Due to special priorities needed and lack of interest in
the specific houses, 18 of these unfilled spaces in
cluded five spaces in Columbae, three spaces in
Synergy, seven spaces in Haus Mitteleuropa, and
three spaces in the French House. The four Mit
teleuropa spaces arc for women; the 14 other unfilled
spaces are for men.
Laura Memhard, house associate (RA) for Col
umbae House, said, "Columbae is looking for five
good men."
Quotas
According to Alice Supton, assistant dean of Re
sidential Education, consistent failure of a house to
fill its quota jeopardizes its future. "A house has to
show that there is sufficient interest among students
in living there."
To be assigned to a given residence, a student must
be placed in the assignable group and either have a
better priority than the last student assigned there or
have the same priority and a lower draw number.
Assignments showed a large discrepancy between
the draw numbers needed by men and women. For
example, female Italian House candidates needed
1387 while males needed only 4285.

According to Associate Dean of Residential Edu
cation Norm Robinson, about 200 males will drop
out of the University housing system to join frater
nities, however. "That's why we haven't gotten
through all the guarantees," he said.
Less spaces
Overall, there are 47 fewer spaces this year than
last year because of the absence of Storey House.
Twenty-three students were within the assignable
group but could not be assigned because of the selec
tiveness of their residence choices. These students did
not take the option of being assigned any University
housing.
The Cowell cluster and Row Houses were particu
larly popular residences this year. American Studies
also required a low number — 1346 for men and 388
for women.
Roble, requiring 1026 for men and 2114 for wo
men, and Toyon, requiring 1373 for men and I 743
for women, were the top dorms.
Robinson emphasized that all students with hous
ing guarantees will have them honored by Sep
tember.
