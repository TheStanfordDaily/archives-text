## Bee Gees, Chiclets, Big Macs Cubans enticed, rush to U.S. 
### Nicholas Lemann The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — It's no
surprise to Kirby Jones that
thousands of Cubans are leaving
their country in a desperate,
eager rush. "1 think it has to be
put in perspective," he says.
"The Bee Gees, Chiclets. Big
Macs — that's very enticing and
seductive," says Jones, who puts
American businessmen, politi
cians and journalists in touch
with Fidel Castro's government.
"Then, add to that the influx into
Cuba of 125,000 visitors from
Florida with their tales of Gloria
Vanderbilt jeans, digital watches
and toaster ovens. And I bet
along with that do not go stories

of gas lines and overdrawn
charge accounts."
Kirby Jones is part of an in
formal group in Washington and
elsewhere who, in the late 19705,
helped create a more positive
picture of Castro's Cuba in
America.
Some of those who have
traveled to Cuba say they knew
Castro's regime was repressive.
Others, like Jones, profess to
be unruffled. They say the re
fugees are leaving primarily in
response to inflated expectations
of economic betterment here,
rather than in search of political
freedom. That distinction may
seem academic, but it is the basis

of the American government's
refugee policy toward those fle
eing dictatorships that are, un
like Cuba, right wing and
friendly toward the United
States. Political refugees are al
lowed in more readily than
people coming for economic
reasons.
Most of the members of Con
gress who have been to Cuba say
the exodus is consistent with
what they say there. "1 don't
think the exodus of refugees
from Cuba is any big surprise,"
says Sen. Frank Church (D-
Idaho), who went to Cuba in
1977.
But among those who don't
hold elective office, there
emerges the view that thousands
of people fleeing Cuba in boats is
not particularly an adverse re
flection on Castro. In this view,
the appeal of America to Cu
bans. as to most people from
Caribbean countries, is monet
ary.
"It indicates that we live in a
richer society," says Philip
Brenner, a fellow at the Institute
for Policy Studies who has made
five trips to Cuba. "Whether the
refugees want freedom depends
on w hat freedom means. . . They
want the apparent freedom to
choose jobs. Those are the
stories they hear about. They
don't hear about Alabama
blacks who can't get jobs."
Brenner says the refugees
have gotten an inaccurate pic
ture of America from their rela
tives who came here in the 1 960s
and received extraordinary be
nefits from the government — an
exercise in "buying people off'
as part of a deliberate program to
destabilize Castro's government.
Most people who have been to
Cuba stress Castro's decision to
allow people who left the coun
try in the 1960s to return to visit
their families as a factor in the
current wave of migration. The
visits created an "invidious com
parison" between economically
depressed Cuba and prosperous
America, says William Leog
rand, an assistant professor in
the school of government and
public administration at Ameri
can University. "What would
happen if we opened our doors
to Mexicans?" he says." Millions
would come. Cubans don't like
liv ing in a poor country any more
than anvbody else does."
