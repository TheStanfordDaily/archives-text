## 
### Jean-Louis Lemarchand Agence France-Presse 
TAIF. Saudi Arabia — The
Organization of Petroleum Ex
porting Countries yesterday ac
cepted the principle of quarterly
oil-price hikes, hut three coun
tries — Iran. Algeria and Libya
opposed the mechanism ap
proved by the 10 other countries.
The majority at the two-day
special conference here ap
proved a system proposed by the
OPEC long-term strategy com
mittee and aimed at bringing
some stability to the price of
crude.
More OPEC meetings will be
necessary in coming months to
try to smooth over difficulties
raised through the opposition of
Algeria. Iran and Libya so that
agreement can be reached be
fore the OPEC summit in
Baghdad. Iraq, in November.
Saudi Oil Minister Sheikh
Ahmed Zaki Yamani said the de
legations agreed on most of the
proposals put forward by the
strategy committee.
However, the Angerian. Ira
nian and Libyan ministers said
the proposed price-fixing system
did not provide adequate
guarantees for advancing the
buying power of a barrel.of oil.
The system envisages price in
creases every three months, tak

ing account of three factors:
— The effect of inflation on
international trade, based on re
tail price indices and the price of
exports by Western members of
the Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development.
— Changes in the values of a
"basket" of nine currencies, to
gether with the U.S. dollar. The
nine are the currencies of Bel
gium. France. West Germany.
Italy. Japan, the Netherlands,
Sweden. Britain and Switzer
land.
— Growth rates in member
countries of the OECD.
Conference sources said that
Algeria. Iran and Libya argued
that the price-indexing formula
should rather take account of the
cost of products imported by
OPEC rather than of items ex
ported by the West.
They said the growth rates of
OPEC countries and of the de
\ eloping world should also be
taken into account in the calcula
tions.
The quarterly price-fixing
mechanism was the main prop
osal put forward by the strategy
committee.
Other proposals unanimously
accepted by the 13 countries
concerned relations with indus
trialized countries and support
for the Third World.
