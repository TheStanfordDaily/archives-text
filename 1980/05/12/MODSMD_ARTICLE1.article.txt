# In the interest of 'world peace'
## Reagan suggests economic 'signals'for Soviets 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Republican presidential candidate
Ronald Reagan said Friday that if the
Soviet Union tries to invade Iran, Un
ited States military intervention would
be impractical and a "threat to world
peace."
Instead, he suggested the United
States should concentrate on not allow
ing oil-rich Saudi Arabia to fall, and
impose sanctions and economic
boycotts on Afghanistan as "strong sig
nals" against Soviet aggression.
"World peace cannot be obtained if
we continue in endless retreat. It also
cannot be obtained if we precipitously
put ourselves in a position of escalating
our conflict with the Soviet Union," the
69-year-old former California governor
told the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco.
Yet, Reagan also called for increased
defense spending because he said the
only effective deterrent for the Soviets
would be "an arms race where they
couldn't catch up," adding that Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's current interna
tional policies "may lead to a president
being faced with the surrender of this
country."
The 1300 on hand in the Cirand Bal

lroom of the Fairmont Hotel, greeted
Reagan with a standing ovation, and
interrupted him with applause a dozen
times during his 40-minute speech, as
he stressed the need to lower taxes and
end the "hostile, adversary relation
ship" between government and big bus
iness in America.
Flanked on the dais by civic and party
leaders, including Shirley Temple
Black, former U.S. chief of protocol,
Casper Weinberger, former HEW sec
retary, and Richard Burress, associate
director of the Hoover Institution here,
Reagan chided the Carter administra
tion for attempting to balance the fed
eral budget "with taxes at one end and
unemployment on the other," and for
its inability to deal with inflation.
"The first time he talked to us about
inflation, he had on a sweater. . . now it
looks as though he pulled the wool over
his own eyes," Reagan said, pointing to
the current 18 percent inflation rate.
Reagan said sacrifice should begin
with national government and that the
"thousands of useless regulations (on
American corporations) which slow
productivity and raise production
costs," should beeliminated to helpcut
inflation.
He also called for an end to the inheri

tance tax, which he says has placed the
farmer and the small business owner on
"the endangered species list."
Turning to the energy crisis, Reagan
suggested the key to solving the prob
lem rests in government deregulation
and letting the energy industry "loose
on the marketplace where it belongs.
"We are not energy poor; we have not
wasted resources. Experts tell us there
is more oil and gas to be found in the
U.S. than we have used. We could have
nuclear power. We're sitting on the
biggest coal pile in the world," he ad
ded.
Some of the former actor's strongest
applause during the speech came when
he criticized Carter for his "hypocrisy.
We penalize friends under the guise of
human rights and then we try to cozy up
to the Soviet Union where there are no
human rights at all," he said.
Despite his critiques of Carter's
foreign policy, Reagan said he sup
ported the recent, unsuccessful try to
rescue the hostages in the Iranian em
bassy. "But I would have supported it
six months ago," he said.
Earlier at a press conference, Reagan
also said he supported Carter's decision
to accept the Cuban refugees because it
represents a "moral committment to

democracy."
Reagan took a pro-Israel stance on the
question of West Bank autonomy for the
Palestinians. "When they divided up
that area, 80 percent of the Palestinians
were from Jordan and 20 percent were
from Israel. It seems to me that the prob
lem is then 80 percent Jordan's, and 20
percent Israel's."
But Reagan also said the United
States should not try to impose a set
tlement in the area.
Although Reagan said he is opposed
philosophically to bailing out indus
tries in financial trouble, he said he
supports the government's move to as
sist the Chrysler Corporation. The gov
ernment must take some responsibility
for these kinds of problems, said
Reagan, because of harsh regulations
and "environmental concerns" im
posed on the companies.
About a possible running mate,
Reagan, who is currently 200 delegates
short of a first ballot victory at the Re
publican national convention in July,
said he would recommend someone
who agrees with him "philsosophi
cally, not someone on a polarextreme."
Before the speech, Reagan admitted
he would not ask former President
Richard Nixon.
