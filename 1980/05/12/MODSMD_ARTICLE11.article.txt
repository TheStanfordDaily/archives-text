# These moms work overtime
## 
### Cici Oremland Staff Writer 
Being a Stanford student is hard. Everyone
agrees on that. Being a mother is hard. Everyone
agrees on that, too. Both occupations are more
than full-time jobs, yet more than 150 student
mothers here are busy trying to prove that it's
possible to do both.
"There are times when it's very challenging
and energizing. Then there are the other times
when it's very frustrating and energy demand
ing. It all depends," says Eileen Swerdlick, a
graduate student in the school of education and
mother of two.
Most student mothers are in graduate prog
rams, but some are undergraduates who have
returned to school to finish their educations.
"There's no going back. I couldn't go back to
just being a homemaker," says Sheila Canty, a
graduating senior with four children.
Despite the unfinished dissertation or the
exam tomorrow, a mother can't ignore her
child's needs. Often, a student mother's
schedule must be flexible enough to pick up
children from school and prepare dinner for the
family.
"It's a problem to maintain credibility at the
University, to show them that I am serious about
my education, but I'm also serious about being a
mother who is going to be there for my chil
dren," says Swerdlick.
"It's a high stress situation that breeds frustra
tion. It's really a juggling act," says Charlotte
Siegal of the campus Counseling and Psycholog
ical Services Center.
"It's hard on the kids. Mom is more tense. The
children must learn that sometimes Mom must
read her books in quiet. They must understand
that Mom cares for them very much and that next
week after her test they'll go have a good time
together," says Siegal.

Some mothers find their children slow to ac
cept their new lifestyle. "At first the kids were
not positive at all. They wanted to know what
happened to Mom. I guess 1 really threw a curve
to the family. I wanted to learn more," says
Canty.
Other mothers, especially of older children,
found their children entirely supportive. "Chil
dren can often identify with Mom and her books.
Everyone has homework to do," says Siegal.
All the mothers did agree that it has been a
good experience for their children. "We've all
learned to make compromises and pitch in to
gether," says Canty. She says that her re
frigerator is not "wiped 20 times a day" any
more.
Student mothers have to budget their time
carefully. "After 3 p.m. I'm home. When they're
home, I'm home," says Diana Ghirado, a
graduate student in history and humanities and
mother of two.
An added problem for many of the mothers is
the single parent situation where child care time
must be even more stringently budgeted without
aid of a father.
"Stanford is not set up for single parents,"
says Ghirado. "I'd just love to have a wife" like
so many male graduate students do."
"It's hardest to be single; then it is a total
responsibility," says Siegal although the Uni
versity does off era "high quality, warm, suppor
tive" child care system. Such programs are
especially important for mothers of small chil
dren. '
Structured support groups are often impossi
ble to arrange around individual's schedules.
The YWCA tried to sponsor a group for single
mothers but received little response.
Escondido Village is great, she says."It gives a
sense of structure. There are many activities for
the children and there is a community sense •
