## We grope for Ideal Grave 
### 
I would like to offer you a
grape.
The reason for my generosity
is that you have read the first
line of this column and you
have not turned your eyes to
read the latest diatribe against
the Chaparral, or the most re
cent episode of the Great Liber
tarian Debate in these pages.
Learn now the reason for this
essay and groan. It concerns
changes, seekers of meaning.
Pippin and grapes.
You see, what is most sur
prising about the changes is
what hasn't changed. Our situ
ation as students in this school
is both piecarious and absurd.
It is like demolishing an an
cient stone tower by removing
brick after brick — from the
ground up.
There are three kinds of Stan
ford students. (To be sure, there
are only two kinds of people —
those who classify people into
two groups and those who
don't. But let it pass.)
There are those who come for
the A's and B's. Undergraduate
Stanford is but a way station in
their journey to bigger and bet
ter schools, well-moneyed
careers and mid-life crises.
These are the Stoics.
There are those who live for
the moment and for the lush
experiences of undergraduate
life. With beatific smiles, we
are informed that not the desti
nation but the journey is what
counts. Study takes a back seat
to friendship, outings, love —
all the odd and sundry ac
tivities that normal people save
for their backyards on
weekends. These are the
Epicureans.
Finally, there are those with
visionary fire in their eyes.
You'll find them noisily forc
ing libertarianism on you,
preaching God's word for him,
or feeling guilty about the poor
starving masses over wine and
cheese during the dorm sherry
hour. They are the Cynics.
From personal experience I
can say that every member of
each of these groups is a flam
ing, flagrant seeker-of-truth
and-meaning. Yes, I say, a real,
live honest-to-goodness
Vladimir/Estragon-ish, lost,
confused, existential soul.
Childlike in their Angst, bereft
of their superego, they (no,
we!) are searching for the ideal
Grape.

Brace for epiphany. The
search for the search for mean
ing has no meaning. There is
nothing to search for. "To
search" is simply to he ex
posed. You name it, and some
one of us has been exposed to it
here — drugs, sex, violence.
Structured Liberal Education.
It's all here for the taking.
Why, then, does everyone
search for an Ideal Grape? Why
must everyone search for some
thing, and then if and when the
search is complete, have that
something? Who has ever
found the absolute philosophy,
the fulfilling career, the ideal
lover or the perfect tan?
If you've set your sights on
the Ideal Grape, you've proba
bly changed your major at least
twice and have felt like chang
ing it several times more. You
have or will travel through
Europe. You are thinking about

working for the Peace Corps
someday. You voted for Jimmy
Carter in '76 (or would have)
and will vote for Ronald
Reagan or John Anderson in
'80. I've got you pegged.
Searching, and trying out
life's offerings as Pippin did is
healthy, if it's not taken seri
ously. A smorgasbord is good
for your stomach, and in mine
at least, resides my spirit.
Consistent with the uni
verse's inconsistency, how
ever, you find what you're
looking for only when you stop
looking for it. To be fulfilled, to
be content with life is to be not
searching. To search for con
tentment is to plug a whole
with empty space.
So set the Ideal Grape in the
sun and make a raisin out of it.
Then eat it.
