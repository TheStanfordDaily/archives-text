End block seating
I was disappointed to dis
cover that Andy Geiger plans to
do nothing to put an end to
block-seating at football games
(Daily, May 8). Those of us who
thought we had tickets to an
unreserved section this year
soon discovered that menacing
fraternity pledges would force
us into inferior seats.
Fans started to come earlier
to get good seats, and the crush
at the gates was so severe that it
was amazing no one was hurt.
If the block-seating results in
violence, or if someone is
trampled at the gates, I hope
Geiger will be held responsi
ble. Perhaps then the Athletic
Department will care about
something other than the
money it gets from ticket sales.

Creative efforts
Mega-thanks for the gener
ous preliminary article on
Jesus Christ Superstar (Daily,
May 8). The story gave an accu
rate picture of the enormous
budgetary hurdles which are
being overcome in producing
the show. In all fairness to
Superstar's participants and

prospective audience mem
bers, we feel that attention
must also be given to the
show's tremendous artistic
challenges.
Firstly, the use of Frost Am
phitheatre is not merely for a
"change," but also provides a
unique appropriate physical
structure for the show. It is
beyond the scope of this letter
to individually address all of
the artists involved in the pro
duction. However, it is impor
tant to realize that the areas of
directing, acting, singing,
dancing, music and costume,
set, and lighting design have
all been the focus of intensive
creative efforts over the last few
(or many) months.
We want the Stanford com
munity to be aware that Jesus
Christ Superstar, an economic
"extravaganza," is not meant to
impress by its budget but
rather by its power as an excit
ing piece of musical theatre.
See you at the end of May.
