## Evaluate two ways 
### 
I'd like to respond to Henry
Organ's column {Daily, May 1)
on the solution of employment
problems by staff performance
evaluations. I agree with Organ
that any and all secret solicita
tion of information about staff
at the University should be
formally prohibited by Person
nel in its University Guide.
More importantly, work
related problems of all kinds
could be solved by an on-going
restructuring of our staff evalu
ation procedure.
Toward this end, I have an
idea that 1 believe would vastly
improve working conditions at
Stanford. It is one of those
ideas that is so simple it
slips by our minds.
Stanford's performance
evaluation procedure is en
tirely one-way. That is, it is a
"top down" procedure in
which supervisors regularly
and formally evaluate the per
formance of their employees as
supervisees, but employees
don't get a chance to evaluate
the performance of their super
visors as supervisors.
Of course this is absurd,
especially as it is far from an
easy thing to be a good super
visor, and supervisors presum
ably get paid significantly
more than their charges pre
cisely because supervising is
supposed to be a difficult thing
to do.,f\nd surely, if Personnel
recognizes, as it does, that no
one knows better how an
employee is doing than his or
her supervisor, it must admit
that no one knows better how a
supervisor is doing as a super
visor than his or her employee.
All the Personnel office has
to do is finally decide that staff
at all levels are valuable human
beings and are as likely as their
supervisors to intelligently and
honestly assess working fcondi
tions and personality interac
tions on their jobs. To avoid in
itial fear or embarrassment on
the part of staff members un
used to the idea of evaluating
their supervisors, all Personnel
would have to do would be to
draw up a formal evaluation
form, similar to those used by
supervisors right now in every

department of the University,
and send these to all staff with a
cover memo ensuring that the
new two-way evaluation pro
cedure is mandatory and that
the employee is absolutely pro
tected from anything s/he says
in any way adversely affecting
his or her position or working
relationship at Stanford.
The same memo should go to
supervisors so that they aren't
taken by surprise. And of
course the content of all evalu
ations, just as they are now,
would be openly shared bet
ween supervisors and super
visees; and staff evaluations
sent on by department officers
to "supervisors' supervisors."
For staff who already have
good working relations with
their supervisors, this innova
tion would present no diffi
culty whatsoever; and for those
who do not, it is an absolute
necessity. Supervisors, too,
oftefi get by with anything they
want to at the University, with
employees paying the price
their transgressions. (I know.
I've been through the longest
grievance in the history of the
University, and I won.)
The certain knowledge that
they will be evaluated at the
end of the year on their
thoughtfulness, kindness, or
ganization of work for their
staff, and sundry other marks of
a good supervisor— for which
they are in part being paid —
would go a long way toward
raising the value of staff in the
eyes of supervisors and the
University alike.
This simple, easy-to
implement innovation in our
personnel evaluation system is
long overdue. The only thing
that stands in its way is an
elitist belief in a self-landlord
system in which employees are
viewed as replaceable parts in
an academic assembly line, not
as inherently valuable people
in two-way relationships.
For Personnel to take this
proposal seriously, they have
to hear many voices.

at the University should be
formally prohibited by Person
nel in its University Guide.
More importantly, work
related problems of all kinds
could be solved by an on-going
restructuring of our staff evalu
ation procedure.
Toward this end, I have an
idea that 1 believe would vastly
improve working conditions at
Stanford. It is one of those
ideas that is so simple it
slips by our minds.
Stanford's performance
evaluation procedure is en
tirely one-way. That is, it is a
"top down" procedure in
which supervisors regularly
and formally evaluate the per
formance of their employees as
supervisees, but employees
don't get a chance to evaluate
the performance of their super
visors as supervisors.
Of course this is absurd,
especially as it is far from an
easy thing to be a good super
visor, and supervisors presum
ably get paid significantly
more than their charges pre
cisely because supervising is
supposed to be a difficult thing
to do.,f\nd surely, if Personnel
recognizes, as it does, that no
one knows better how an
employee is doing than his or
her supervisor, it must admit
that no one knows better how a
supervisor is doing as a super
visor than his or her employee.
All the Personnel office has
to do is finally decide that staff
at all levels are valuable human
beings and are as likely as their
supervisors to intelligently and
honestly assess working fcondi
tions and personality interac
tions on their jobs. To avoid in
itial fear or embarrassment on
the part of staff members un
used to the idea of evaluating
their supervisors, all Personnel
would have to do would be to
draw up a formal evaluation
form, similar to those used by
supervisors right now in every

department of the University,
and send these to all staff with a
cover memo ensuring that the
new two-way evaluation pro
cedure is mandatory and that
the employee is absolutely pro
tected from anything s/he says
in any way adversely affecting
his or her position or working
relationship at Stanford.
The same memo should go to
supervisors so that they aren't
taken by surprise. And of
course the content of all evalu
ations, just as they are now,
would be openly shared bet
ween supervisors and super
visees; and staff evaluations
sent on by department officers
to "supervisors' supervisors."
For staff who already have
good working relations with
their supervisors, this innova
tion would present no diffi
culty whatsoever; and for those
who do not, it is an absolute
necessity. Supervisors, too,
oftefi get by with anything they
want to at the University, with
employees paying the price
their transgressions. (I know.
I've been through the longest
grievance in the history of the
University, and I won.)
The certain knowledge that
they will be evaluated at the
end of the year on their
thoughtfulness, kindness, or
ganization of work for their
staff, and sundry other marks of
a good supervisor— for which
they are in part being paid —
would go a long way toward
raising the value of staff in the
eyes of supervisors and the
University alike.
This simple, easy-to
implement innovation in our
personnel evaluation system is
long overdue. The only thing
that stands in its way is an
elitist belief in a self-landlord
system in which employees are
viewed as replaceable parts in
an academic assembly line, not
as inherently valuable people
in two-way relationships.
For Personnel to take this
proposal seriously, they have
to hear many voices.
