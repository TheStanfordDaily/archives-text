# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Pam Howes Reorder draft priorities 
### 
Congress, in considering the
draft registration bill, would be
wise not to turn to the past for
an answer. The present-day
consensus among draft-age
Americans appears to be that a
return to compulsory service
will bring another Vietnam. In
effect, this view blames the
military for the Vietnam in
volvement, and for the ultimate
failure of the war itself.
This conclusion is not only
inaccurate but dangerous. The
bad taste of a draft badly used
still lingers, but it is wise to
remember that opposition to
Vietnam developed from two
rather incompatible notions.
1) Young people were being
conscripted to risk their lives
in an enterprise that proved at
best senseless and at worst
immoral.
2) Conscription was en
gineered in a way that enlisted
the poor, the underprivileged,
and the patriots, and spared
those who could, through
legalized subterfuge, avoid the
risk.
Those who held the first no
tion often tended to overlook
the second. It was easier for the
privileged classes to avoid ser
vice in the "immoral war," and
their success only insured that
the poor would serve in greater
numbers.
Critics of the draft suggest
that many would refuse to
serve if drafted. This grossly
underestimates the strength of
the American people. The les
son of the Vietnam draft is not
that people will not go if called;
only 13,580 men refused the
draft during the entire era,
while more than 9 million re
gistered. The real lesson is that
a draft, once invoked, should
be fair in its application.
The inequities of Vietnam
were not solved by dismissing
the draft and instituting "vol
unteer" service. It is broadly
agreed that after seven years of
relying on volunteers, the
armed forces are inadequate,
both in terms of quality and of
racial and class mix. The bur
den is once again shouldered
by those least able to find
livelihoods in the civilian
world.
It is fundamentally wrong,
perhaps even cowardly, to
claim in a democratic society
that those who fight should

risk their lives merely because
they are "following the mar
ketplace" and the military is
their "best deal." The military
is not a job, any more than pay
ing taxes is a job. It is un
reasonable to require that our
national defense be maintained
by a small minority of citizens,
regardless of whether the pres
sure that forced them to serve
was legislative or economic.
Conscription can be honora
bly opposed on principle, as a
violation of individual rights
under the Constitution. It can
just as honorably be supported
as the only way to maintain
adequate, flexible armed
forces. The 1971 Congressional
amendments to the Selective
Service Act have alleviated
many of the inequalities and
closed many of the loopholes
exploited during the Vietnam
draft. Further refinements can
and should be made to distri
bute the burden equally among
all citizens.
Condemning the draft is
perhaps more difficult now
than it was during the Vietnam
era. Whether we like it or not,
theUnited States in 1980 is still
a world power, caught in
global entanglements and
commitments that require it on
occasion to put its muscle
where its mouth is. Diplomacy
on this scale makes arguments
like"Weshould notshedblood
for oil" naive; it is no longer as
simple as "the Nazi menace" or
the threat of communism.
Perhaps most necessary is a
reorientation of priorities. Dur :
ing Vietnam, only one eligible
male in three was drafted. In
Israel today, 95 percent of
males serve in one capacity 'ol
another, along with over 50
percent of females (although,
contrary to popular belief,
women rarely serve in combat
units). There are plenty of
desks to sit behind in the Army,
in order to free those more
physically able for combat. The
current system must be refined
in order to determine more eas
ily exactly who should type
and who should fight.
Critics of the new draft prop
osals should note an April,
1979 Gallup poll in which 76
percent of Americans favored
draft registration. Further
more, of those in the draftable
age group, fully 73 percent ap

proved of the move to register.
These figures should not be
overlooked by Congress, which
is trying desperately to avoid
discussion of the draft during
an election year. The major
contenders for the presidency
have no use for this discussion.
Neither does President Jimmy
Carter, now that he has disco
vered that his call for registra
tion didn't scare the enemy but
scared up a hurricane at home.
Yet the topic is an important
one, and explanation to the
public is vital.
In the long run, a nation can
not sustain a policy whose con
sequences the public is not wil
ling to bear. If it decides not to
pay the price to defend itself, it
will be defenseless. That is the
risk of democracy.
