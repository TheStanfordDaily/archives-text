## Group has rights 
### 
The First Amendment to our
constitution essentially gives
Americans the right to express
our opinions. On a college
campus such as this, that right
is normally extended to in
clude advertisement of one's
cause on flyers and posters.
That such an extension is al
most universally granted can
be ascertained by a walk
through almost any university
dormitory.
This letter "is prompted by an
incident of selective denial of
this right. As a member of a
budding organization here on
campus, "Stanford Students
for Reagan," I personally dis
tributed many flyers the other
day publicizing our first meet
ing.
The extreme rapidity and
viciousness with which a large
majority of these flyers were
decimated is astounding. No
sooner than many of them went
up were they shredded,
marked on, removed or
postered-over.
The inherent discrimina
tion is obvious. On a campus
where so many students
scream for minority rights and
an end to such discrimination,
why should this occur? It is
very likelv that Stanford stu

dents who support Ronald
Reagan for president are a
minority. Nonetheless, we
have as much right to publicize
our meetings and events as
does anyone else.
1 believe the Reagan organi
zation's posters were destroyed
because it is social suicide to
hold right-wing political views
as a student on this campus.
People rally around the left
wing in order to conform. 1
argue for the free-speech rights
of all campus groups.
If someone wants to paint
their ping-pong table with a
large, red hammer-and-sickle
(as was done in Cedro for a
year, with negligible opposi
tion), they should be allowed.
If someone wants to put swas
tikas on their door (as was done
in Cedro and met with incredi
ble animosity), they should be
allowed.
If someone wants to pub
licize and hold an anti-draft or
anti-nuclear rally (as is fre
quent here), they have every
right. And if I want to attract
support for the presidential
candidacy of Reagan (as is un
usual here), I also have every
right to do so.
