Stay after bell
One would think that some
people around here had ses
sions with Dr. Pavlov by the
way they react to bells.
I was actually squirming in
embarrassment for a professor
last week who, after hearing
the almighty bell, was hur
riedly trying to wrap up his lec
ture knowing that it would
only be a matter of seconds be
fore a mass exodus would oc
cur.
Well, the poor man just
couldn't pull it off in time. One
desk was heard slamming
down in the back of the au
ditorium, a backpack went
zzzzip!!! and that set off an
enormous chain reaction.
The professor was, of course,
completely drowned out and
was left rather clumsily search
ing the room for a face that at
least held the illusion of atten
tiveness, so that he could con
clude without looking like a
senility case talking to himself.
Why should the lecturers
have to deal with this unpleas
ant situation? Everyone ap
preciates how disagreeable it is
to be talking to someone whose
attention is suddenly diverted.
We can spare the lecturers
this experience if we remain

seated and reasonably quiet for
a grace period after the bell
rings, during which the hour
can be concluded — gracefully.

Ehrlich inaccurate
I have read Dorothy Ehrlich's
"Open Letter to the Stanford
Community" (Daily, May 5-6).
First I read it in the Daily; then,
because funny things some
times happen to the Daily on
the way to the printer, I read it
again, carefully, in letter form.
Because I was Chairman of
the Advisory Board that heard
the Bruce Franklin case in 1971
and recommended his termina
tion — as well as belonging to
the minority that voted for a
lesser penalty — I think I have a
good grasp of the history of this
case. And because I recently
served as head of a controver
sial federal agency, I have also
had extensive experience with
what we may call the literature
of efforts to influence out
comes.
1 shall leave to others here the
detailed accounting of errors in
your letter. But 1 do want you to
know that, based on the experi
ence I have just cited, I find that

your letter establishes an abso
lutely unique record for inac
curacy in the category of public
documents prepared by profes
sional organizations.

Photo senseless
In view of its recent concern
with credibility and serious
ness in serving the Stanford
community, it seems the Daily
might reconsider its policy of
regularly printing the sense
less column that is accom
panied by a photograph of a
man picking his nose.
