# Try lifestyles on for size
## Frosh learn, test limits

"Freshman year is like standing at the foot of a
driveway and peering down a long road. During
sophomore year one steps away from the drive
way, focuses upon the far end of the road and
begins walking. By junior and senior year it
seems that the long road has simply become the
driveway, however, one always remembers that
first walk down the block with an incredible
clarity.

The first year away at college is bound to be a
formidable challenge for anyone. But what
makes it so? What constitutes the "freshman
experience?" Lyons describes this time as a de
claration of independence — though many of
the trials are not very profound.
According to Lyons, "This is a period of self
testing. How long can we go without sleep? How
long can we go without laundry soap? How long
can we go without anything in our bank ac
counts?"
Lyons says he views the first year experience
as a time to try on new personalities and lifes
tyles for size. They ask themselves, "What kinds
of people do we like?" "What kinds of people
like us?" "What are we good at?" He says that
the freshman year is one of legitimate and
needed "self-centeredness," and because of this
personal concern, a time involving less "other
centeredness."
College is, "One of the last remaining rituals
leading into adulthood," says Lyons, this ritual
is a crucial transition period — an opportunity
for testing limits and learning about oneself. It is
important to learn that one can't "get wasted
every day and maintain a state of equilibrium"
or "do well on exams after going without sleep
for a night," Lyons said. Freshman year is an
eye-opening time for "validating oneself by try
ing on the negative."
A key factor is the planned diversity of Stan
ford's residential program. Each dorm is a geog
raphic and ethnic sampling of the freshman
class. In this sense, "Our residential campus is a
rarity, as the diversity is right there within the

dorms. One is forced to come to terms with these
differences — they're living right down the
hall," says Lyons.
Norm Robinson, dean of residential educa
tion, draws a parallel between a freshman dorm
and a theme house, with the theme being the
first year at the University. He says that the fact
that this is one common experience shared by
everybody engenders an instant sense of com
munity. The tightly-knit environment nurtures a
high level of energy, an energy which manifests
itself in various forms. A dorm can play the role
of channeling these energies in positive and
creative directions. At times, this togetherness
can lead them toward the opposite extreme;
problems and moods become magnified, erupt
ing in unruly behavior, says Robinson.
Scott Pearson, food research associate profes
sor and a resident fellow in Madera, has been
instrumental in guiding these energies into a
cohesive dorm personality. "Each fall the
freshmen arrive enthusiastic, unsure, and curi
ous to find their way around," Pearson says.
Some students feel at ease from the beginning,
yet for the most part, the incoming student is
compelled to establish his personality. Reflect
ing this individual identity quest, the new stu
dent turns to the dorm, anxious to create a name
for his home. Combine this with tradition, sim
ple geography, and a little bit of one-upmanship,
and it inevitably leads towards dorm rivalry. "At
times, this rivalry can lead to undue rowdiness,
and in other instances, it's a little bit of a macho
thing — it's cleverness, a little gross, but not too
(gross)," he says. Usually, however, the dorm
manages to direct its energies into more positive
activities such as sherry hours, intramurals,
seminars and parties.
In any case, dorm involvement in general
tends to fade out as the year progresses. Both
Pearson and Robinson attribute this change to
the fact that as students establish their bearings,
they begin integrating themselves into the Stan
ford community. The challenge of freshman
year lies in testing limits — determining the
boundaries between the individual and the
group. It is the challenge of taking that first step
off the driveway.

the fact that as students establish their bearings,
they begin integrating themselves into the Stan
ford community. The challenge of freshman
year lies in testing limits — determining the
boundaries between the individual and the
group. It is the challenge of taking that first step
off the driveway.
"Freshman year is like standing at the foot of a
driveway and peering down a long road. During
sophomore year one steps away from the drive
way, focuses upon the far end of the road and
begins walking. By junior and senior year it
seems that the long road has simply become the
driveway, however, one always remembers that
first walk down the block with an incredible
clarity.
( James Lyons

The first year away at college is bound to be a
formidable challenge for anyone. But what
makes it so? What constitutes the "freshman
experience?" Lyons describes this time as a de
claration of independence — though many of
the trials are not very profound.
According to Lyons, "This is a period of self
testing. How long can we go without sleep? How
long can we go without laundry soap? How long
can we go without anything in our bank ac
counts?"
Lyons says he views the first year experience
as a time to try on new personalities and lifes
tyles for size. They ask themselves, "What kinds
of people do we like?" "What kinds of people
like us?" "What are we good at?" He says that
the freshman year is one of legitimate and
needed "self-centeredness," and because of this
personal concern, a time involving less "other
centeredness."
College is, "One of the last remaining rituals
leading into adulthood," says Lyons, this ritual
is a crucial transition period — an opportunity
for testing limits and learning about oneself. It is
important to learn that one can't "get wasted
every day and maintain a state of equilibrium"
or "do well on exams after going without sleep
for a night," Lyons said. Freshman year is an
eye-opening time for "validating oneself by try
ing on the negative."
A key factor is the planned diversity of Stan
ford's residential program. Each dorm is a geog
raphic and ethnic sampling of the freshman
class. In this sense, "Our residential campus is a
rarity, as the diversity is right there within the

dorms. One is forced to come to terms with these
differences — they're living right down the
hall," says Lyons.
Norm Robinson, dean of residential educa
tion, draws a parallel between a freshman dorm
and a theme house, with the theme being the
first year at the University. He says that the fact
that this is one common experience shared by
everybody engenders an instant sense of com
munity. The tightly-knit environment nurtures a
high level of energy, an energy which manifests
itself in various forms. A dorm can play the role
of channeling these energies in positive and
creative directions. At times, this togetherness
can lead them toward the opposite extreme;
problems and moods become magnified, erupt
ing in unruly behavior, says Robinson.
Scott Pearson, food research associate profes
sor and a resident fellow in Madera, has been
instrumental in guiding these energies into a
cohesive dorm personality. "Each fall the
freshmen arrive enthusiastic, unsure, and curi
ous to find their way around," Pearson says.
Some students feel at ease from the beginning,
yet for the most part, the incoming student is
compelled to establish his personality. Reflect
ing this individual identity quest, the new stu
dent turns to the dorm, anxious to create a name
for his home. Combine this with tradition, sim
ple geography, and a little bit of one-upmanship,
and it inevitably leads towards dorm rivalry. "At
times, this rivalry can lead to undue rowdiness,
and in other instances, it's a little bit of a macho
thing — it's cleverness, a little gross, but not too
(gross)," he says. Usually, however, the dorm
manages to direct its energies into more positive
activities such as sherry hours, intramurals,
seminars and parties.
In any case, dorm involvement in general
tends to fade out as the year progresses. Both
Pearson and Robinson attribute this change to
the fact that as students establish their bearings,
they begin integrating themselves into the Stan
ford community. The challenge of freshman
year lies in testing limits — determining the
boundaries between the individual and the
group. It is the challenge of taking that first step
off the driveway.
