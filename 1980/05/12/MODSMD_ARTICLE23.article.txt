Freshman dorms are notoriously the scenes
of many extra-curricular activities and various
pranks each year. These pranks vary from the
usual carpet thefts, dorm stormings and trash
ings, and food fights to more contrived acts of
retaliation.
Cups clutter hall
Branner's second floor saw a bizarre prank
this winter. Male occupants spent weeks pilfer
ing paper cupsand hiding them in their rooms.
On the chosen morning at 4 a.m., Branner's men
snuck to the women's floor and covered the
entire carpeted hallway with these cups. The
hitch? The cups were full of water, so that the
only way Branner women could leave their
rooms was by picking their way through the
containers, pouring the water from one cup to
the next as they went.

'Radio-Free Wilbur' silenced
Early this year several Wilbur freshmen dis
covered a defunct interdorm communication
system. The ingenious frosh further managed to
wire the system through several dorms so that it
could be used for their own broadcasts.
"Radio-Free Wilbur," as the project came to
be called, ran monologues throughout the fall
and winter during early AM hours. Due to com
plaints, the radio system has become dormant
this quarter.
Primal Screamers
This activity apparently began in the hygenic
facilities of one of Stern's more notorious
dorms. One very early morning, an individual,
for no apparent reason, let out a scream. Later,
he did the same thing. This time, however, he
got a response. These AM cries became a
routine, termed the Primal Screams. The con
spiracy later spread to several floors, creating a
Primal Chorus. These daily shouting rounds
seem to have petered out lately.
