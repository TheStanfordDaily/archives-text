# Some frosh will not return
## 
### Jane West Staff Writer 
Although many students seek admission to
Stanford, not everyone finds happiness here
once they arrive. In a survey of the survival of the
freshman class after the first year, during the
decade of the '70s, 94 percent, on the average,
return. What happens to the other 6 percent? A
good portion decide to stop out. But some
freshmen discover that one year at Stanford is
sufficient and do not wish to come back.
The percentage is still unknown, but at least
six freshmen this year have already decided not
to return. What in the freshman experience has
provoked this decision?
One freshman from the Northeast said, "I'm
annoyed with the people here. They set their
goals four years in advance or more. There is no
sense of defining our freedom here and now.
People are too busy trying to find their slot in the
future."
She said she came with no expectations but
soon became disappointed with the faculty, the
suburban campus, the emphasis on technology,
and the lack of diversity in the student body. She
intends to transfer to Berkeley.
Another freshman from the East also voiced
these gripes.
"I feel swamped by the importance of
technology. In my dorm, only a few people talk
about things besides rotating conic sections. I've
enjoyed myself here and have gotten a good lib
eral arts education. But I want to go somewhere
else where liberal arts hold a more prominent
position."
"Friends of mine who are (liberal) arts stu
dents were also disappointed and thinking of
transferring," she added. "I was the only one to
take concrete steps."
This freshman cited sexism at Stanford as
another reason why she was leaving. "I'm not
claiming it's different elsewhere, but here the
sexism is very pronounced. In the single-sex
corridor dorms, there is a lot of role playing. A
gulf between the men and women exists.
"I'm glad I came here because I learned a lot
about affluence and the things about it I want to
avoid. The many Californians all come from the
same rich suburban environment. Stanford re
peats this and then brings it to higher degree."
A freshman from the Los Angeles area was
bothered by the competitive atmosphere at Stan
ford. She said, "To be the best is impos
sible. If you are hesitant, discouraged or not con
fident, this is not the place to be. Get out quick.
The pressure perpetuates this sense of inadequ
acy. You are made to feel like you should always
be happy. And if you're not, maybe it's time to
stop out for awhile. That convenience is always
provided. It's as if they are saying 'You have no
right to be unhappy and if you are get out.' "
Arriving at Stanford with the impression that
everything would be big and good, "Approach
ing Stanford," solidified her expectations. But,
she now intends to take a year off and then at
tend a university with a program that better
suits her interests.

"I will probably be attending UCLA because I
want to go into film. There is no program at
Stanford," said a freshman from Arizona who is
also dissatisfied with the (liberal) arts here.
"Late in the summer I realized I had doubts so
I knew this was going to be a trial year. I found
out by the beginning of winter quarter that I
didn't like this school that much."
One freshman said she would love to return
next year but cannot for financial reasons. After
attending her state's university and concentrat
ing on what she thinks will be her intended
major, she hopes to return to Stanford if she can
afford it.
Alice Supton, associate dean of residential
education, is aware of the problems that
freshmen encounter.
"The school is full of stars. Students often go
through a 'moment' of pause and wondering.
You have to operate on so many fronts that there
is tension," she said.
"I don't agree with the observation that Stan
ford encourages students to leave if they are not
'good' or 'happy.' There are definitely ways to
develop a sense of your own ability without
leaving Stanford. One way is by counseling â€”
try to identify why you are being so self-critical.
Another way is to try to acknowledge your suc
cesses," said Supton.
Supton also commented on why freshmen see
a greater emphasis being placed on technology.
"It takes awhile to identify the faculty you're
interested in and to develop a faculty-student
relationship. One part of being a housing as
sociate (RA) is to enable the students to involve
the faculty. Freshmen should also take the initia
tive by going to office hours and doing other
things like inviting the professors to dinner,"
she said.
Thomas Massey, director of student activities
and organizational affairs, suggested that stu
dents who get involved with organizations early
on tend not to leave after the first year because
they have developed another base for support.
"Part of the problem is the campus is so iso
lated and self-contained. It wooes people not to
leave it during the weekends and summers. The
atmosphere is also different here than at home.
"Because of the change in atmosphere,
freshmen at the beginning of the year are hit
with a deluge of orientation groups and meet
ings. After the first quarter, the support groups
are less visible. We should change this, perhaps,
to make orientation more ongoing," Massey
said.
The freshmen that have decided not to return
next year all talked to their friends here and at
home about their decision. They held the com
mon belief that their advisors were of no help.
Because of the problems encountered specifi
cally as a freshman at Stanford, many other stu
dents are not sure whether they will return to
Stanford, stop out or transfer.
One student said, "I would like to leave, but
I've finally adjusted to Stanford. I wouldn't want
to transfer and have to adjust again."
