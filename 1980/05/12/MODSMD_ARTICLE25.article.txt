# Women trackers end season
## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
A cold steady rain provided a
soggy setting for the Stanford
Women's Track and Field Clas
sic Friday at Stanford Stadium,
but Cardinal coach Laurel
Treon expressed satisfaction
with her team's season finale.
"I'm really glad we had a
chance for this competition no
matter what the weather,"
Treon commented, "one thing
we're learning to deal with is
how to compete under all con
ditions and at all levels."
Participating in the non
scoring meet were the Univer
sity of California and Cal Poly
at San Luis Obispo, as well as
representatives of track clubs
and unattached individuals.
Despite the adverse condi
tions one stadium record was
set as Pam Cox of the Stars and
Stripes Track Club established
a new 10,000-meter time of
36:41.4, slicing 1.2 seconds off
the previous mark.
Other outstanding efforts in
cluded Stanford Track Club's
Robin Campbell's 53.6 clock
ing in the 400 meters and Cal's
Gale Zaphiropoulos discus toss
of 152 feet 8 inches,

One of the day's most excit
ing matchups featured Kim
Schnurpfeil of Stanford against
Cal's Lynn Hjelte in a 3000-
meter race that saw the two
runners exchange the lead five
times. With two laps left to run
Schnurpfeil lost the lead to
Hjelte around the first turn as
both runners separated from
the pack.
On the bell lap, Hjelte stayed
ahead until the last curve
where Schnurpfeil caught her
and kicked down the straigh
taway to win in 9:46.3.
"Kim's effort in the 3000 was
outstanding. It was the first
time she responded this well to
other runners when she could
have quit. It would have been
very easy to quit after she was
passed," commented Treon
about the race.
Schnurpfeil agreed. "I just
thought about staying with her.
I kept concentrating on not giv
ing up, that would have been
very easy."
Other performances that
especially pleased Treon in
cluded Mary Osborne's victory
in the javelin, Shelley Poerio's
effort in the 400 meters, Andrea
Dewey's setting of a personal

record in the 800, and Johanna
Hansen's effort in the 400-
meter hurdles.
Schnurpfeil, Osborne and
freshman teammate Pam
Donald will have the distinc
tion of being the first women to
represent Stanford at the AIAW
Nationals to be held next week
at Oregon. Schnurpfeil qual
ified to run the 5000 meters in
the meet, while Donald and
Osborne will compete in the
long jump and javelin respec
tively. All three possess the
school record for these events.
Looking back over her first
season of collegiate competi
tion Osborne said, "It was a
pretty big transition. I've been
doing a lot of things
technique-wise that I hadn't
done before. Mentally there's a
big change of atmosphere, your
family and friends aren't there
to cheer you on."
Donald also commented
about the change. "You get to
meet new people, you have
new coaches, and you adjust. I
learned a lot more about my
events." As for the Nationals
she noted, "I'd like to jump 21
feet."

especially pleased Treon in
cluded Mary Osborne's victory
in the javelin, Shelley Poerio's
effort in the 400 meters, Andrea
Dewey's setting of a personal

record in the 800, and Johanna
Hansen's effort in the 400-
meter hurdles.
Schnurpfeil, Osborne and
freshman teammate Pam
Donald will have the distinc
tion of being the first women to
represent Stanford at the AIAW
Nationals to be held next week
at Oregon. Schnurpfeil qual
ified to run the 5000 meters in
the meet, while Donald and
Osborne will compete in the
long jump and javelin respec
tively. All three possess the
school record for these events.
Looking back over her first
season of collegiate competi
tion Osborne said, "It was a
pretty big transition. I've been
doing a lot of things
technique-wise that I hadn't
done before. Mentally there's a
big change of atmosphere, your
family and friends aren't there
to cheer you on."
Donald also commented
about the change. "You get to
meet new people, you have
new coaches, and you adjust. I
learned a lot more about my
events." As for the Nationals
she noted, "I'd like to jump 21
feet."
