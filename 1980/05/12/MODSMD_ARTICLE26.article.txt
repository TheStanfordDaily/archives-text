## 
### Steve Odell Greg Jonsen Staff Writers 
The Stanford men's tennis
team closed out their regular
season schedule with a 5-4 vic
tory over the USC Trojans
Saturday. The match followed
the familiar indoor-outdoor
format with the Cards holding
a 4-2 lead heading into Maples.
Tim Mayotte then clinched the
match for the Cards with a win
in the number 2 singles with a
sparkling 6-2, 6-0 win.
The match was important for
the Cards, who, after losing 5-4
to UCLA Thursday, held a 7-2
record, while the Trojans were
atop the division with an H-l
mark. With the victory, Stan
ford and SC ended with identi
cal B-2 records, and since the
Cardinals also won 5-4 down in
Los Angeles, they won the
Pac-10's Southern Division.
"I'm really pleased with our
performance," said a happy
and somewhat relieved head
coach, Dick Gould. "We
needed a win tonight, and this
will give us momentum head
ing into the NCAA's."
But at the outset of the
match, it looked like the Cards
were on their way to anything
but victory. The match began
with the four-through-six sing
les, and USC promptly won all
three first sets.
The Cards battled back,
however, as the partisan crowd
at the Varsity Courts came
alive. The Stanford netters re
sponded to the fans. Scott Bon
durant, after losing the first set
4-6, came back to take Roger
Knapp in the second and third
sets, 6-3, 7-5.
Dave Siegler lost his first set
with Jack Kruger, but battled
back as he fought off seven
match points, on his way to a
gutty three-set 4-6, 7-6, 6-3
win.
Jeff Arons and Doug Adler
split their first two sets in the
number six singles, 6-3 and
2-6, but Adler won the decid
ing set, 6-4.
In the other outdoor singles
match, Lloyd Bourne, spurred
on by a vocal crowd, sparkled
at number 3 as he knocked off
Sean Brawley in straight sets,
6-4, 6-3.

In the doubles matches that
were played at the Varsity
Courts, SC won at number 2
with a come-from-behind 3-6,
6-4, 6-3 win from Billy Nealon
and Roger Knapp over Tim
Mayotte and Arons, in which
the Trojan duo, trailing 3-2 in
the third set, took the last four
games.
"1 have to think that we
should have won that one,"
commented Gould. "I thought
Jeff (Arons) played real well.
For Tim (Mayotte), 1 think he
might have been thinking
about his indoor match and
might have lost a little of his
concentration.
In number 3 doubles action,
the Cards got a great win from
Bondurant and Siegler, as they
fought off a furious SC rally in
the second set to win over
Kruger and Brawley. 6-2, 7-5.
The Trojans, down 5-1 in the
second set, broke twice and
won four straight games to tie it
up at 5-5. But then Stanford
broke to go up by a game and
Bondurant held his service for
the set and match to give Stan
ford its 4-2 lead heading into
the indoor matches.
And one indoor match was
all it took for the Cards to
clinch the win. Mayotte easily
and quickly polished off
Nealon in straight sets, two and
love. "I really get psyched to
play inside with the crowd and
everything," said Mayotte,
when explaining his successes.
"It's a combination of playing
indoors, the people, and plus, I
think I'm gaining some confi
dence.
It turned out that the Cards
needed his win at number two,
as Peter Rennert was beaten by
a red-hot Robert Van't Hof in
the No. 1 singles, 6-4, 7-5.
In the final match of the
night, Rennert and Bourne fell
to a very tough No. 1
Southern Cal doubles team of
Van't Hof and Adler, 7-6, 7-6,
but it was too little too late for
the Trojans.
The Cards now await the
NCAA tournament, May 19-26,
in Athens, Georgia. "It's really
wide-open going into the tour
nament," commented Gould.
"Any one of the top seven or
eight teams could do it."
