# Dawkins halts Jabbar to even series
## Dr. J uses magic in 105-102 win 
### Scott Ostler The Los Angeles Times 
PHILADELPHIA — Julius
Erving's No-Way-Even-For-J
reverse layup midway through
the fourth quarter was the artis
tic highlight of the game Sun
day, and his Swoop-to-the-
Hoop-on-Coop layup was the
coup de gras as the 76ers beat
the Lakers, 105-102, in the
Spectrum.
Erving doesn't name his
shots, he just executes 'em, and
execute is what he did to the
Lakers with 1:11 left in the
game. Isolated one-on-one
against defense ace Mike
Cooper, Erving drove across
the lane and scooped in a layup
to give the Sixers a 105-100
lead.
The Lakers made it close on
Magic Johnson's two free
throws with 31 seconds left,
but Sixer forward Bobby Jones
intercepted a Norm Nixon pass
to prevent the Lakers from tak
ing a final desperation three
point shot attempt.
The National Basketball As
sociation championship series
now returns to L.A., tied at two
games apiece. Game 5 is Wed
nesday night at the Forum in

Inglewood.
Yesterday the Sixers, desp
erate for a win, got lots of
Chocolate Thunder and held
Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
a performance of a mere mortal
for the first time in the series.
Darryl (Chocolate Thunder)
Dawkins won one for mom on
Mother's Day, scoring 26
points. Magic Johnson led all
scorers with 28, but missed a
layup with 31 seconds left. He
was fouled by Bobby Jones and
made both free throws, but the
Lakers desperately needed a
three-point play then.
A major theme in the series
so far has been the Lakers abil
ity to keep Erving from "going
off," killing them with flurries
of points. They held him down
again yesterday . . . most of the
time.
With 7:35 left in the game
Erving made the shot of the
series, a reverse spin layup in
traffic, to give the Sixers a
91-84 lead.
With just over a minute left
and Erving playing guard,
Sixer coach Billy Cunningham
called for an isolation play,
where the other four Sixers
clear out and give the Doctor

some operating room.
Cooper forced him to the
middle, but didn't get any of
fensive help as Erving scooped
in the clincher.
"They told me to push him to
the middle," Cooper said. "I
thought someone was going to
be there to take the offensive
foul, because usually when he
goes to his right, he goes all the
way. He takes the ball up from
way down low, so I thought
someone might be able to flick
it away. . . . Those shots sure
look pretty."
The isolation play, used
often throughout the game by
the Sixers, is designed to ex
pose the Lakers' supposed zone
defense. Cunningham in
structed Erving to talk to the
officials before the game — tell
them the play was coming and
to look for the illegal zone. Erv
ing forgot to tell the officials
before the game and forgot
again at halftime.The play
worked anyway. Erving made
five of six shots in the second
half.
On the Big Shot, Erving said
he was surprised nobody
picked him up in the lane after
he went around Cooper.

"They were coming, but I
think they got stuck between
coming and going," he said,
"because I had been passing off
on that play. I was surprised
Kareem didn't come over. I sort
of floated to the hoop."
The Lakers killed the Sixers
on the backboards again, this
time by a 49-34 margin, and
that's what kept them in the
game.
The Lakers took the lead in
the second quarter on a 11-0
scoring burst and led by six
midway through the third
period before the Sixers turned
on an 18-5 scoring blitz.
The key to that surge was
Dawkins. After the first game of
the series, a poor one for Daw
kins, he read newspaper ac
counts of the game referring to
him as Chocolate Thunder and
Chocolate Pudding, and
steamed for two days. Since
then he has put him game back
on track. In that 18-5 burst,
Dawkins scored eight points on
three inside shots and a
jumper.
"The turning point in the
game was when Darryl became
effective inside," Erving said.
"We struggled until Darryl be

came the dominant force on the
floor. He was also an inspira
tional leader on the floor and
the rest of us responded."
In the previous game, the
Sixers had all but ignored their
big man in the middle, but be
fore Sunday's game they resol
ved to take the ball inside more
against the Lakers.
Dawkins responded with
some bruising moves to the
hoop.
"When Darryl gets layups,"
Erving said, "it straightens out
his jump shot and his free
throws. Sometimes it's our
fault, we don't get him the ball
inside, and he gets three
second calls while he's wait
ing. In the third quarter we got
him the ball, and he showed us
why we should. I've seen Dar
ryl explode like that a few
times this year, and it's just un
believable."
Erving was looking to drive
more in this game. Hawkins
was looking to shoot. The Six
ers wanted to force the action
inside, to make the Laker de
fenders work.

picked him up in the lane after
he went around Cooper.

"They were coming, but I
think they got stuck between
coming and going," he said,
"because I had been passing off
on that play. I was surprised
Kareem didn't come over. I sort
of floated to the hoop."
The Lakers killed the Sixers
on the backboards again, this
time by a 49-34 margin, and
that's what kept them in the
game.
The Lakers took the lead in
the second quarter on a 11-0
scoring burst and led by six
midway through the third
period before the Sixers turned
on an 18-5 scoring blitz.
The key to that surge was
Dawkins. After the first game of
the series, a poor one for Daw
kins, he read newspaper ac
counts of the game referring to
him as Chocolate Thunder and
Chocolate Pudding, and
steamed for two days. Since
then he has put him game back
on track. In that 18-5 burst,
Dawkins scored eight points on
three inside shots and a
jumper.
"The turning point in the
game was when Darryl became
effective inside," Erving said.
"We struggled until Darryl be

came the dominant force on the
floor. He was also an inspira
tional leader on the floor and
the rest of us responded."
In the previous game, the
Sixers had all but ignored their
big man in the middle, but be
fore Sunday's game they resol
ved to take the ball inside more
against the Lakers.
Dawkins responded with
some bruising moves to the
hoop.
"When Darryl gets layups,"
Erving said, "it straightens out
his jump shot and his free
throws. Sometimes it's our
fault, we don't get him the ball
inside, and he gets three
second calls while he's wait
ing. In the third quarter we got
him the ball, and he showed us
why we should. I've seen Dar
ryl explode like that a few
times this year, and it's just un
believable."
Erving was looking to drive
more in this game. Hawkins
was looking to shoot. The Six
ers wanted to force the action
inside, to make the Laker de
fenders work.
PHILADELPHIA — Julius
Erving's No-Way-Even-For-J
reverse layup midway through
the fourth quarter was the artis
tic highlight of the game Sun
day, and his Swoop-to-the-
Hoop-on-Coop layup was the
coup de gras as the 76ers beat
the Lakers, 105-102, in the
Spectrum.
Erving doesn't name his
shots, he just executes 'em, and
execute is what he did to the
Lakers with 1:11 left in the
game. Isolated one-on-one
against defense ace Mike
Cooper, Erving drove across
the lane and scooped in a layup
to give the Sixers a 105-100
lead.
The Lakers made it close on
Magic Johnson's two free
throws with 31 seconds left,
but Sixer forward Bobby Jones
intercepted a Norm Nixon pass
to prevent the Lakers from tak
ing a final desperation three
point shot attempt.
The National Basketball As
sociation championship series
now returns to L.A., tied at two
games apiece. Game 5 is Wed
nesday night at the Forum in

Inglewood.
Yesterday the Sixers, desp
erate for a win, got lots of
Chocolate Thunder and held
Laker Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to
a performance of a mere mortal
for the first time in the series.
Darryl (Chocolate Thunder)
Dawkins won one for mom on
Mother's Day, scoring 26
points. Magic Johnson led all
scorers with 28, but missed a
layup with 31 seconds left. He
was fouled by Bobby Jones and
made both free throws, but the
Lakers desperately needed a
three-point play then.
A major theme in the series
so far has been the Lakers abil
ity to keep Erving from "going
off," killing them with flurries
of points. They held him down
again yesterday . . . most of the
time.
With 7:35 left in the game
Erving made the shot of the
series, a reverse spin layup in
traffic, to give the Sixers a
91-84 lead.
With just over a minute left
and Erving playing guard,
Sixer coach Billy Cunningham
called for an isolation play,
where the other four Sixers
clear out and give the Doctor

some operating room.
Cooper forced him to the
middle, but didn't get any of
fensive help as Erving scooped
in the clincher.
"They told me to push him to
the middle," Cooper said. "I
thought someone was going to
be there to take the offensive
foul, because usually when he
goes to his right, he goes all the
way. He takes the ball up from
way down low, so I thought
someone might be able to flick
it away. . . . Those shots sure
look pretty."
The isolation play, used
often throughout the game by
the Sixers, is designed to ex
pose the Lakers' supposed zone
defense. Cunningham in
structed Erving to talk to the
officials before the game — tell
them the play was coming and
to look for the illegal zone. Erv
ing forgot to tell the officials
before the game and forgot
again at halftime.The play
worked anyway. Erving made
five of six shots in the second
half.
