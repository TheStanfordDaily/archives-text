# Attorneys discuss legal ethics
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
New York attorney Roy Cohn, a one-time aide
to former Sen. Joseph McCarthy (D-Wisc.), will
join San Francisco lawyer Douglas Schmidt and
associate law professor Deborah Rhode in a
panel discussion entitled "Ethics in Law to
night at 7:30 at Kresge Auditorium.
The law symposium is the final segment of a
five-part American Studies House series on
"Ethics in Professional Decision-Making."
Cohn served as a special assistant to the U.S.
attorney general for internal security in 1952,
and was the chief counsel to the U.S. Senate
Investigating Committee from 1952 to 1954.
Schmidt specializes in homicide cases and
represented the defendants of the infamous Gol
den Dragon massacre and the I arantino mur
ders. He also defended former San Francisco
Supervisor Dan White for the murders of Mayor
George Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk in
1978.
Rhode, a former editor of the Yaie Law /our

nal, specializes in the field of ethical responsi
bility in law and has served as a legal clerk to
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.
According to committee member Tim Duane,
the focus of the series is "What does an indi
vidual have to deal with as a professional?" This
includes the problems in decision-making, he
said.
Questions posed at tonight's discussion will
include how an attorney justifies defending
someone he knows is guilty, Duane said.
He added that the series has "tried to have an
equal balance of speakers in and out of the uni
versity." The diverse panelists attract a lot of
community residents," Duane said.
The series included discussions on ethics in
medicine, journalism, education and business.
Because many speakers agreed to speak for
free, the program was able to run on a $500
Residential Education Grant, Duane said. Roy
Cohn, for example, doesn't charge for speaking
because he has a $100,000 expense account, he
said.
