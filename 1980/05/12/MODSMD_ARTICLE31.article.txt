Reminscent of last year's per
formance, the Stanford Wo
men's Soccer team lost to Con
cord United 3-0 in the finals of
this weekend's Fifth Annual
Stanford Invitational Soccer
Tournament.
This Sunday afternoon's loss
did not transpire, however,
until the two days of single
elimination matches amongst
13 invited teams had left Con
cord United, a high school
team, and Stanford in the fi
nals. UCLA and UC-Davis vied
for third place.
Other teams included UC-
Berkeley, UC-Davis, UCLA,
State Select, Golden Gate
Select, Concord United, Occi
dental , S.F. State, University of
Oregon, the Palo Alto Panthers,
and second teams from Davis
and Stanford.
First round matches pitted
Stanford's second team against
Occidental, UCLA against S.F.
State, Davis' second team
against Berkeley, State Select
with the Panthers, and Golden
Gate with University of Ore
gon. (Stanford, Davis and Con
cord received byes in the first
rounders.)
Despite miserable playing
weather and marginal fan sup
port, the tournament began on
schedule at 9 a.m. Saturday
morning as Stanford's second
team met Occidental. Stanford
took this match 1-0 on a last
minute (literally) goal drilled
in by Ann Walecka. Play was
dominated by the Cards, in one
of their strongest games this
season.
Other first round games put
UCLA past S.F. State 3-0, Ber
keley on top of Davis second
team 2-0, University of Oregon
over Golden Gate 1-0, and State
Select ahead of Palo Alto in
a 3-2 shoot-out after a 1-1 tie
game.
These first round matches
were shortened to 35 minute
halves so that all were finished

by 2:30 p.m., clearing the two
Roble fields for Round Two
combinations.
These pitted Stanford sec
ond team with Concord Un
ited, UCLA with UC-Berkeley,
Davis with State Select and
Stanford with University of
Oregon.
Both Stanford's Round Two
matches kicked off at 3 p.m.
The second team, up against
last year's tourney champs,
found themselves over
whelmed by Concord's fast
past-hard and run combina
tion. Concord led the Cards by
eight goals by the time officials
called time 90 minutes later.
(Second round games returned
to the official 45-minute
halves.)
Stanford's first team held its
victory ground successfully,
though, overcoming the Ore
gon Ducks in a tense shoot-out
after a 1-1 tie game.
In the shoot-out, each team
was given five seconds to let a
shot off, starting from the 35, as
specified by NAWSL rules.
Shooting for Stanford was
Cindy Shorney, Pauline
McNamara, Sue Handel and
Christine McGarrey, with Joan
Sanders defending the goal.
In the tourney's tensest five
minutes, Stanford ultimately
prevailed 3-1, with shots
booted in by Cindy Shorney,
Sue Handle and Kris McGar
rey. Goalie Sanders made two
brilliant saves against Oregon,
clinching the victory.
Though many consider
shoot-outs an unfair way to
terminate ties, this end seemed
appropriate as Stanford had
dominated most of the official
time play. Outshooting the
Ducks 21-7, only strong winds
and a few confused plays re
sulting from a lack of player
communication, held these
shots from the goal.
The other two afternoon bat
tles put UCLA and Davis in the
victory slots past Berkeley and
State Select. The scores on

these matches were 2-1 (de
cided in overtime play) and
5-3, respectively.
Thus, yesterday's Semifinal
bracket aligned Concord and
UCLA, Stanford and Davis for
two 9 a.m. games.
As predicted, Concord
soundly defeated UCLA, 7-1.
Stanford beat Davis by a
large margin also — 5-1. This
conquest was not predicted, as
Stanford lost to Davis earlier
this season. The Cards, how
ever, put on a spectacular per
formance, playing their best
game of the year. Stanford pas
sed, hustled, and dribbled
through formidable Davis op
ponents, consistently holding
the Davis defense at nerves
end.
In this rout Stanford goals
were scored by Cindy Shorney
(2), Sarah Little, Kris McGarrey
and Kathy Carey.
The results of these clashes
put Stanford and Concord in
the finals, with UCLA and
Davis left to battle it out for
third and fourth place. Both
matches commenced yesterday
afternoon at 3 p.m.
Though Stanford had played
their season's best game just a
few hours earlier against Davis,
the fact that Concord had
beaten them last year, com
bined with miserable weather
and fatigued players, ulti
mately changed the Card tide
of victories into a bath of de
feat: Concord took Stanford
3-0.
Concord did not particularly
dominate the field. But as play
moved back and forth, Concord
managed to break almost all of
Stanford's attempted fast
breaks and short pass combina
tions. And though shooting
was about even at 11-13
(Concord/Stanford), Concord
accuracy and fast, tight tackles
proved superior to Stanford's
slower play.
On the other field, Davis
found UCLA too tough for
them also, losing 4-2.

Thus, Stanford handed Con
cord United the first place, ac
cepting second for themselves
ahead of third and fourth plac
ers UCLA and Davis.
An all league team was also
selected, on which Stanford
placed four players: Cindy
Shorney, midfielder Sue

Handel, defender Pauline
McNamara and goalie Joan
Sanders.
This tournament ended
Stanford women's soccer team
play for the season. Stanford
will, however, host the
California Regional Champ
ionships next weekend.
