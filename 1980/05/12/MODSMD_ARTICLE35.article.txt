# Slow track at Fresno slows runners, not Buss
## 
### Steve Odell Staff Writer 
The Stanford men's track
and field team competed at the
annual West Coast Relays
Saturday at Fresno State, a
meet which included a lot of
"big names."
The biggest name this year
was Norway's Richard Olsen,
who threw the hammer 243-
feet-0, establishing a new West
Coast Relays record and ex
tending his own Norwegian
national record.
But the Cardinals were not
without their star either, at the
53rd running of the Relays,
which was held at Fresno's
Ratcliffe Stadium. Stanford's
Rick Buss threw 180-feet-6 fora
new personal record in the dis
cus. Buss also threw the ham
mer, his main event, 210-feet-6.
"What can you say?" said
coach Brooks Johnson. "Rick
Buss has been and continues to
be our most consistent per
former day in and day out. He
had an off day, for him, in the
hammer, but then he goes out
and gets a lifetime best in the
disc."
Other individual performers
for the Cardinals were Bill
Haldeman, who got fourth in

the 3000 meter steeple chase
with a time of 9:04; and Darrin
Nelson, who ran 10:55 in the
100 meters to earn himself fifth
place.
Stanford also had two entries
in the relays — the4 x 100 with
Vincent White, Kevin Jones,
Nelson and Gordon Banks run
ning to a third place finish at
41.1; and the 4 x4OO, where
the Cardinal team of Garry
Shumway, Robert Maiocco,
Nelson and Banks took fourth.
"This was really just kind of
a filler meet for us," com
mented Johnson. "The weather
was bad and the track was
slow. It didn't point out any
thing we didn't already know.
In meets like these, you can't
really tell where you stand after
they're all over."
The Cardinals will compete
at the California Relays next
Saturday at Modesto, before
traveling to Washington the
following weekend for the
Pac-10 championships.
"Modesto will be great,"
Johnson added. "They have a
fast track, and hopefully the
weather will be better. We'll be
able to tell where we are a lot
better after Modesto next
weekend."
