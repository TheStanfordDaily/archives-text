# Cal crew crushes Cardinals
## 
### Robert Stone Staff Writer 
A strong Cal squad outclas
sed the Stanford rowers in the
Big Meet of the season for crew
Saturday morning at Redwood
Shores.
In the men's competition the
Bears stroked to easy victories
in both eight-man freshman
classes, in the lightweight
eight class, and in the four-man
and eight-man varsity divi
sions.
The Cardinal women pro
vided a bright spot for Stanford
as the novice eight entry rowed
to tie the Cal boat at the finish
line. The Bears, considered to
be second in the nation, held a
slight lead three-fourths of the
way down the 1000-meter
course, but weren't able to
widen the sap.
The Cal boat crossed the line
about two feet ahead of Stan
ford, but both were clocked at
3:38.21. The women's varsity
and four-woman novice entries
both fell to their Berkeley coun
terparts.
Although Stanford's varsity
four and lightweight eight both
lost by considerable margins,

varsity coach Phil Waters was
satisfied with their efforts. "I
thought the varsity rowed a
fairly good race; the fact that
they're improving is what I'm
looking for," he observed, not
ing that the meet will serve as a
good tune-up for the Pac-10
championships this weekend.
The varsity four fell behind
early as both Cal entries
opened a three-length lead at
the midpoint. The Bears
finished the 2000 meters in
6:50 and 6:55, with Stanford
third in 7:22. In the varsity
eight race Cal finished in 6:23,
24 seconds ahead of Stanford
while in the lightweight race
Cal won by three to four
lengths in 7:09. Stanford's time
was 7:32.
The women's varsity also fell
behind early but stayed with
the Cal boat to lose by three
fourths of a length. Stanford's
time in the race was 3:43, nine
seconds behind Cal.
The women's novice four
was clocked at 4:22, again nine
seconds behind the Bear boat.
John Davis, coach of the
Card's women's team, re
marked about his team's per
formance, "I'm reallv impre

ssed, very impressed. We knew
we were over our heads a little
bit, but we picked up time on
Cal, we gave it a good shot. I'm
satisfied with the amount of
progress we've made this
year."
About the novice race Davis
pointed out, "I thought they
raced pretty close but it took
too long (for Stanford) to get it
together. We knew we could
beat them but it was going to be
tight."
The story was the same for
the freshmen squads. In the
first race of the morning, Stan
ford's first freshman team
stayed relatively close to the
Cal boat but fell behind by the
halfway point. Stanford's time
in the race was 6:41 to Cal's
6:30.
The second freshman team
didn't fare as well. Cal took an
early lead and continued to ex
tend it during the race. Cal won
with a clocking of 6:58, with
Stanford finishing at 7:25.
Freshman coach Jeep Morri
son noted, "I was impressed
with their effort, they surprised
some of the Cal people. They
rowed some of their best races
of the season today."
