Athlete of the month
Junior golfer Linda Bowman
has been named Stanford
Athlete of the Month for April
by the Stickney Athletic Foun
dation. Bowman won the USUI
Intercollegiate crown early last
month at San Diego's Torrey
Pines Country Club. She fired a
36-hole total 154 on a par-76
course â€” one of the most dif
ficult golf challenges in the
Western United States.
Bowman'? performance
sparked the Cardinals to their
first intercollegiate team vic
tory in the 10-year history of
the varsity team. First-year
coach Tim Baldwin guided the
Cardinals to a five-stroke vic
tory over national power UCLA
in that tournament.
Bowman also placed third
overall in the recent Arizona

Invitational. Stanford placed
second in the team standings to
No. 4-ranked Arizona State.
Women's tennis
The NorCal Championships
at Santa Clara scheduled for
this weekend were canceled
due to rain. Tournament offi
cials had hoped to complete
the semi-final round so that the
finals could be played at a later
date. Stanford suffered no los
ses, and the highlight of the
weekend was Julia Leighton's
win over fourth seeded Barrie
Bulmore (6-2, 7-5). Leighton,
not seeded in the tournament
came back Saturday after Fri
day's play ended 4-0. Stanford
took the NorCal team champ
ionship, but there was no way
the individual championships
could be determined because

the teams involved have other
matches scheduled. Next
Wednesday the team travels to
Santa Barbara to play in the Re
gionals. Two of Stanford's
players, Alycia Moulton and
Donna Rubin, are seeded No. 2
and No. 3 in the tournament.
Recruiting
Stanford's varsity soccer and
women's swimming teams

cer coach Nelson Lodge an
nounced that Clint Wright,
all-state midfielder from San
Rafael, and former Canadian
prep star Jorge Titinger have
signed letters of intent to enroll
at Stanford next fall.
Sherri Hanna has joined the
Stanford women's swim team
