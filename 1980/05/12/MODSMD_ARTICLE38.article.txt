Khomeini supporters elected
Hard-line Islamic fundamentalists including advo
cates of spy trials for the American hostages have won
a majority in the new Islamic Parliament which
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini says will decide the
fate of the captives. Radio Tehran reported.
The official Iranian radio said that with returns in
from all but 25 of the 247 seats being filled now in the
Majlis, or Parliament, the Islamic Republican Party
has won a total of 110 and Moslem fundamentalists
running as independents had won enough more to
give the IPR a majority.
Khomeini and other leaders of his revolutionary
regime have said that the Majlis will decide what is to
be done with the 53 members of the staff of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran who today are spending their
191st day as hostages. But no decision appears likely
before late June or July.
The U.S. government had hoped that supporters of
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr would win a sizable
bloc of seats since he is considered a pragmatic mod
el ate who wants to end the hostage crisis so he can get
on with trying to restore the shattered Iranian
economy. But many of the Islamic fundamentalists
want the hostages tried as spies unless the United
States forces Egypt to return Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi to Iran and also turns over the royal family's
holdings in the United States.
The Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents
the United States there, said it was pressing the Ira
nian government of information on a 54th American
prisoner, freelance writer Cynthia Dwver of Buffalo,
N.Y., but has not been able to find out where she is
being held.
Bridge victim search continues
ST. PETERSBURG. Fla. —The shattered wreckage
of a Greyhound bus and a mangled automobile were
pulled out of Tampa Bay yesterday, revealing yet
another submerged vehicle as workers searched
grimly for more victims of the Sunshine Skyway
bridge disaster.
As wreckage was pulled to the surface, divers reco
vered six bodies — two that floated out of the bus, two
from a submerged car that had to be cut open after
being raised to a barge, and two others from a car
divers discovered buried beneath the bus. Authorities
said the latest victims were three men and three wo
men.
They raised to 24 the number of bodies recovered
by yesterday afternoon.
Eighteen bodies, all believed from the bus — which
carried 23 persons — were recovered within hours of
the accident Friday morning, but 55 hours passed
before more could be pulled to the surface. Swift
currents and a 40-foot section of bridge dangling
overhead hampered efforts to pry loose bodies the
divers could see trapped in the twisted ruins.
Carter, Reagan advance
Ronald Reagan advanced his claim to the Republi
can presidential nomination over the weekend by
picking up new delegates in Wyoming and Virginia,
while President Jimmy Carter beat Sen. Edward Ken
nedy by more than 2-to-l in Democratic county con
ventions in Texas.
The president exceeded that margin in Wyoming,
where he thrashed Kennedy at the state Democratic
convention by a 71-29 percent margin.
The candidates, including Reagan rival George
Bush, now turn to tomorrow's primaries in Maryland
and Nebraska, where 83 Democratic and 55 Republi

can delegates are at stake.
Reagan is favored to win in Nebraska, but there is
no clearcut sentiment among Democrats between Car
ter and Kennedy. In Maryland, all four candidates
have at least a long shot at winning the primary,
although party officials say Reagan and Carter seem to
have the edge.
Cubans down Bahamian gunboat
NASSAU, Bahamas — A 103-foot Bahamian gun
boat was sunk by Cuban MiG jets and at least four
sailors were missing and presumed dead, a Bahamian
government spokesman said yesterday. The incident
apparently stemmed from the seizure by the Baha
mians of two Cuban fishing boats.
The government spokesman, Joe Edwards, had said
earlier that the four sailors were killed in the incident
Saturday, but he later listed them as missing.
Meanwhile, a resident of remote Ragged Island in
the Bahamas said Cuban aircraft terrorized islanders
yesterday by nose-diving the city of Duncan Town for
several hours. No injuries were reported yesterday.
In Washington, the State Department issued a
statement saying the initial reports indicated Cuba
was guilty of a "gross violation of international law."
Soldiers control Ugandian radio
KAMPALA, Uganda — Soldiers took control of the
official radio and post office in this capital city yes
terday as military authorities increased pressure on
the civilian government of President Godfrey Binaisa.
The soldiers prevented Binaisa from broadcasting
messages on the radio, but they made no apparent
move to place Kampala under martial law or take over
the country. Binaisa remained at his official Lake
Victoria residence in Entebbe, 21 miles away, under
the protection of Tanzanian soldiers, government of
ficials said.
More than 20 soldiers of the Uganda National Lib
eration Army took up positions at Kampala's main
post office while the military guard at Uganda Radio
was increased to about 20. The post office was closed
to the public as usual yesterday.
No unusual numbers of soldiers appeared on the
streets of the capital.
Film upsets Arabs, oil firms
BOSTON — A British filmmaker set out to unravel
the mystery of the execution of a beautiful Saudi
princess. The story he tells of boredom, hypocrisy and
sexual promiscuity in Arabian palaces upset dip
lomats and oil companies and divided U.S. public
television.
The Death of a Princess, a film condemned by the
Saudis and questioned by some American govern
ment officials, airs tonight on most of the stations of
the Public Broadcasting System. The program's
originators said yesterday that seven stations decided
to black out the show, in which actors portray all the
characters.
It was only early this weekend that the much be
leaguered president of PBS returned from Las Vegas,
after appearing on one of his commercial competitors'
programs to explain why PBS was airing the film in
the first place.
Congressmen influential in the funding of PBS
have thundered against the program. Mobil Oil,
which shells out $3 million to public broadcasting,
has been paying big bucks for newspaper advertising
against it. There wave been letters of protest from
Saudi Arabia and a cover letter from the State De

partment disclaiming any attempt at censorship.
Bank robbery deaths investigated
SAN BERNARDINO — Authorities are trying to
unscramble the events and determine who was be
hind a bank robbery that left two bandits and a
sheriff's deputy dead in a running gun battle.
The scenario included semiautomatic weapons.
Army jackets, homemade bombs, an attempt to blow
up an office building as a diversion and even a 10-
foot-deep hole behind a house where the robbers ap
parently were prepared to make a last-ditch stand.
Three of the gunmen were in custody for investiga
tion of murder after failing to elude a 200-man posse
in a 60-mile chase from the Security Pacific National
Bank branch in Norco into the snowy and rugged San
Gabriel Mountains Friday. Two of the men were hos
pitalized with bullet wounds.
The three are scheduled to be formally charged
with murder today in Superior Court here, San Ber
nardino County Sheriff's spokesman Greg Benge said
last night.
Authorities had thought the gunmen might be
members of the "Stopwatch Gang" or "Two-Minute
Gang," a band of bank robbers operating in the San
Diego area whose leader allows only two minutes for
stickups and times his men with a stopwatch.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy through tomorrow with afternoon
sunshine. Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in
the upper 50s to upper 60s.

This issue is the result of the dedicated efforts of
first year staffers at the Daily. Plagued by our older
compatriots, who pestered us with phone calls, hid
the tools of our trade and did everything they could
devise to hinder the production of today's paper, we
managed to finish the product in record time.
In spite of their hinderances, we would like to
thank all those time worn veterans to whom we owe
much of what we have learned while on the Daily
staff.

Khomeini supporters elected
Hard-line Islamic fundamentalists including advo
cates of spy trials for the American hostages have won
a majority in the new Islamic Parliament which
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini says will decide the
fate of the captives. Radio Tehran reported.
The official Iranian radio said that with returns in
from all but 25 of the 247 seats being filled now in the
Majlis, or Parliament, the Islamic Republican Party
has won a total of 110 and Moslem fundamentalists
running as independents had won enough more to
give the IPR a majority.
Khomeini and other leaders of his revolutionary
regime have said that the Majlis will decide what is to
be done with the 53 members of the staff of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran who today are spending their
191st day as hostages. But no decision appears likely
before late June or July.
The U.S. government had hoped that supporters of
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr would win a sizable
bloc of seats since he is considered a pragmatic mod
el ate who wants to end the hostage crisis so he can get
on with trying to restore the shattered Iranian
economy. But many of the Islamic fundamentalists
want the hostages tried as spies unless the United
States forces Egypt to return Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi to Iran and also turns over the royal family's
holdings in the United States.
The Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents
the United States there, said it was pressing the Ira
nian government of information on a 54th American
prisoner, freelance writer Cynthia Dwver of Buffalo,
N.Y., but has not been able to find out where she is
being held.
Bridge victim search continues
ST. PETERSBURG. Fla. —The shattered wreckage
of a Greyhound bus and a mangled automobile were
pulled out of Tampa Bay yesterday, revealing yet
another submerged vehicle as workers searched
grimly for more victims of the Sunshine Skyway
bridge disaster.
As wreckage was pulled to the surface, divers reco
vered six bodies — two that floated out of the bus, two
from a submerged car that had to be cut open after
being raised to a barge, and two others from a car
divers discovered buried beneath the bus. Authorities
said the latest victims were three men and three wo
men.
They raised to 24 the number of bodies recovered
by yesterday afternoon.
Eighteen bodies, all believed from the bus — which
carried 23 persons — were recovered within hours of
the accident Friday morning, but 55 hours passed
before more could be pulled to the surface. Swift
currents and a 40-foot section of bridge dangling
overhead hampered efforts to pry loose bodies the
divers could see trapped in the twisted ruins.
Carter, Reagan advance
Ronald Reagan advanced his claim to the Republi
can presidential nomination over the weekend by
picking up new delegates in Wyoming and Virginia,
while President Jimmy Carter beat Sen. Edward Ken
nedy by more than 2-to-l in Democratic county con
ventions in Texas.
The president exceeded that margin in Wyoming,
where he thrashed Kennedy at the state Democratic
convention by a 71-29 percent margin.
The candidates, including Reagan rival George
Bush, now turn to tomorrow's primaries in Maryland
and Nebraska, where 83 Democratic and 55 Republi

can delegates are at stake.
Reagan is favored to win in Nebraska, but there is
no clearcut sentiment among Democrats between Car
ter and Kennedy. In Maryland, all four candidates
have at least a long shot at winning the primary,
although party officials say Reagan and Carter seem to
have the edge.
Cubans down Bahamian gunboat
NASSAU, Bahamas — A 103-foot Bahamian gun
boat was sunk by Cuban MiG jets and at least four
sailors were missing and presumed dead, a Bahamian
government spokesman said yesterday. The incident
apparently stemmed from the seizure by the Baha
mians of two Cuban fishing boats.
The government spokesman, Joe Edwards, had said
earlier that the four sailors were killed in the incident
Saturday, but he later listed them as missing.
Meanwhile, a resident of remote Ragged Island in
the Bahamas said Cuban aircraft terrorized islanders
yesterday by nose-diving the city of Duncan Town for
several hours. No injuries were reported yesterday.
In Washington, the State Department issued a
statement saying the initial reports indicated Cuba
was guilty of a "gross violation of international law."
Soldiers control Ugandian radio
KAMPALA, Uganda — Soldiers took control of the
official radio and post office in this capital city yes
terday as military authorities increased pressure on
the civilian government of President Godfrey Binaisa.
The soldiers prevented Binaisa from broadcasting
messages on the radio, but they made no apparent
move to place Kampala under martial law or take over
the country. Binaisa remained at his official Lake
Victoria residence in Entebbe, 21 miles away, under
the protection of Tanzanian soldiers, government of
ficials said.
More than 20 soldiers of the Uganda National Lib
eration Army took up positions at Kampala's main
post office while the military guard at Uganda Radio
was increased to about 20. The post office was closed
to the public as usual yesterday.
No unusual numbers of soldiers appeared on the
streets of the capital.
Film upsets Arabs, oil firms
BOSTON — A British filmmaker set out to unravel
the mystery of the execution of a beautiful Saudi
princess. The story he tells of boredom, hypocrisy and
sexual promiscuity in Arabian palaces upset dip
lomats and oil companies and divided U.S. public
television.
The Death of a Princess, a film condemned by the
Saudis and questioned by some American govern
ment officials, airs tonight on most of the stations of
the Public Broadcasting System. The program's
originators said yesterday that seven stations decided
to black out the show, in which actors portray all the
characters.
It was only early this weekend that the much be
leaguered president of PBS returned from Las Vegas,
after appearing on one of his commercial competitors'
programs to explain why PBS was airing the film in
the first place.
Congressmen influential in the funding of PBS
have thundered against the program. Mobil Oil,
which shells out $3 million to public broadcasting,
has been paying big bucks for newspaper advertising
against it. There wave been letters of protest from
Saudi Arabia and a cover letter from the State De

partment disclaiming any attempt at censorship.
Bank robbery deaths investigated
SAN BERNARDINO — Authorities are trying to
unscramble the events and determine who was be
hind a bank robbery that left two bandits and a
sheriff's deputy dead in a running gun battle.
The scenario included semiautomatic weapons.
Army jackets, homemade bombs, an attempt to blow
up an office building as a diversion and even a 10-
foot-deep hole behind a house where the robbers ap
parently were prepared to make a last-ditch stand.
Three of the gunmen were in custody for investiga
tion of murder after failing to elude a 200-man posse
in a 60-mile chase from the Security Pacific National
Bank branch in Norco into the snowy and rugged San
Gabriel Mountains Friday. Two of the men were hos
pitalized with bullet wounds.
The three are scheduled to be formally charged
with murder today in Superior Court here, San Ber

Bank robbery deaths investigated
SAN BERNARDINO — Authorities are trying to
unscramble the events and determine who was be
hind a bank robbery that left two bandits and a
sheriff's deputy dead in a running gun battle.
The scenario included semiautomatic weapons.
Army jackets, homemade bombs, an attempt to blow
up an office building as a diversion and even a 10-
foot-deep hole behind a house where the robbers ap
parently were prepared to make a last-ditch stand.
Three of the gunmen were in custody for investiga
tion of murder after failing to elude a 200-man posse
in a 60-mile chase from the Security Pacific National
Bank branch in Norco into the snowy and rugged San
Gabriel Mountains Friday. Two of the men were hos
pitalized with bullet wounds.
The three are scheduled to be formally charged
with murder today in Superior Court here, San Ber
nardino County Sheriff's spokesman Greg Benge said
last night.
Authorities had thought the gunmen might be
members of the "Stopwatch Gang" or "Two-Minute
Gang," a band of bank robbers operating in the San
Diego area whose leader allows only two minutes for
stickups and times his men with a stopwatch.
Today's weather
Mostly cloudy through tomorrow with afternoon
sunshine. Lows in the upper 40s to mid 50s. Highs in
the upper 50s to upper 60s.

This issue is the result of the dedicated efforts of
first year staffers at the Daily. Plagued by our older
compatriots, who pestered us with phone calls, hid
the tools of our trade and did everything they could
devise to hinder the production of today's paper, we
managed to finish the product in record time.
In spite of their hinderances, we would like to
thank all those time worn veterans to whom we owe
much of what we have learned while on the Daily
staff.

Khomeini supporters elected
Hard-line Islamic fundamentalists including advo
cates of spy trials for the American hostages have won
a majority in the new Islamic Parliament which
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini says will decide the
fate of the captives. Radio Tehran reported.
The official Iranian radio said that with returns in
from all but 25 of the 247 seats being filled now in the
Majlis, or Parliament, the Islamic Republican Party
has won a total of 110 and Moslem fundamentalists
running as independents had won enough more to
give the IPR a majority.
Khomeini and other leaders of his revolutionary
regime have said that the Majlis will decide what is to
be done with the 53 members of the staff of the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran who today are spending their
191st day as hostages. But no decision appears likely
before late June or July.
The U.S. government had hoped that supporters of
President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr would win a sizable
bloc of seats since he is considered a pragmatic mod
el ate who wants to end the hostage crisis so he can get
on with trying to restore the shattered Iranian
economy. But many of the Islamic fundamentalists
want the hostages tried as spies unless the United
States forces Egypt to return Shah Mohammad Reza
Pahlavi to Iran and also turns over the royal family's
holdings in the United States.
The Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents
the United States there, said it was pressing the Ira
nian government of information on a 54th American
prisoner, freelance writer Cynthia Dwver of Buffalo,
N.Y., but has not been able to find out where she is
being held.
Bridge victim search continues
ST. PETERSBURG. Fla. —The shattered wreckage
of a Greyhound bus and a mangled automobile were
pulled out of Tampa Bay yesterday, revealing yet
another submerged vehicle as workers searched
grimly for more victims of the Sunshine Skyway
bridge disaster.
As wreckage was pulled to the surface, divers reco
vered six bodies — two that floated out of the bus, two
from a submerged car that had to be cut open after
being raised to a barge, and two others from a car
divers discovered buried beneath the bus. Authorities
said the latest victims were three men and three wo
men.
They raised to 24 the number of bodies recovered
by yesterday afternoon.
Eighteen bodies, all believed from the bus — which
carried 23 persons — were recovered within hours of
the accident Friday morning, but 55 hours passed
before more could be pulled to the surface. Swift
currents and a 40-foot section of bridge dangling
overhead hampered efforts to pry loose bodies the
divers could see trapped in the twisted ruins.
Carter, Reagan advance
Ronald Reagan advanced his claim to the Republi
can presidential nomination over the weekend by
picking up new delegates in Wyoming and Virginia,
while President Jimmy Carter beat Sen. Edward Ken
nedy by more than 2-to-l in Democratic county con
ventions in Texas.
The president exceeded that margin in Wyoming,
where he thrashed Kennedy at the state Democratic
convention by a 71-29 percent margin.
The candidates, including Reagan rival George
Bush, now turn to tomorrow's primaries in Maryland
and Nebraska, where 83 Democratic and 55 Republi

can delegates are at stake.
Reagan is favored to win in Nebraska, but there is
no clearcut sentiment among Democrats between Car
ter and Kennedy. In Maryland, all four candidates
have at least a long shot at winning the primary,
although party officials say Reagan and Carter seem to
have the edge.
Cubans down Bahamian gunboat
NASSAU, Bahamas — A 103-foot Bahamian gun
boat was sunk by Cuban MiG jets and at least four
sailors were missing and presumed dead, a Bahamian
government spokesman said yesterday. The incident
apparently stemmed from the seizure by the Baha
mians of two Cuban fishing boats.
The government spokesman, Joe Edwards, had said
earlier that the four sailors were killed in the incident
Saturday, but he later listed them as missing.
Meanwhile, a resident of remote Ragged Island in
the Bahamas said Cuban aircraft terrorized islanders
yesterday by nose-diving the city of Duncan Town for
several hours. No injuries were reported yesterday.
In Washington, the State Department issued a
statement saying the initial reports indicated Cuba
was guilty of a "gross violation of international law."
Soldiers control Ugandian radio
KAMPALA, Uganda — Soldiers took control of the
official radio and post office in this capital city yes
terday as military authorities increased pressure on
the civilian government of President Godfrey Binaisa.
The soldiers prevented Binaisa from broadcasting
messages on the radio, but they made no apparent
move to place Kampala under martial law or take over
the country. Binaisa remained at his official Lake
Victoria residence in Entebbe, 21 miles away, under
the protection of Tanzanian soldiers, government of
ficials said.
More than 20 soldiers of the Uganda National Lib
eration Army took up positions at Kampala's main
post office while the military guard at Uganda Radio
was increased to about 20. The post office was closed
to the public as usual yesterday.
No unusual numbers of soldiers appeared on the
streets of the capital.
Film upsets Arabs, oil firms
BOSTON — A British filmmaker set out to unravel
the mystery of the execution of a beautiful Saudi
princess. The story he tells of boredom, hypocrisy and
sexual promiscuity in Arabian palaces upset dip
lomats and oil companies and divided U.S. public
television.
The Death of a Princess, a film condemned by the
Saudis and questioned by some American govern
ment officials, airs tonight on most of the stations of
the Public Broadcasting System. The program's
originators said yesterday that seven stations decided
to black out the show, in which actors portray all the
characters.
It was only early this weekend that the much be
leaguered president of PBS returned from Las Vegas,
after appearing on one of his commercial competitors'
programs to explain why PBS was airing the film in
the first place.
Congressmen influential in the funding of PBS
have thundered against the program. Mobil Oil,
which shells out $3 million to public broadcasting,
has been paying big bucks for newspaper advertising
against it. There wave been letters of protest from
Saudi Arabia and a cover letter from the State De

partment disclaiming any attempt at censorship.
