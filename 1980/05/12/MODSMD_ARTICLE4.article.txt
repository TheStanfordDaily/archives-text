# Row houses to be renovated soon

The University will spend
between $600,000 and
$700,000 this summer to up
grade 20 older Row houses, ac
cording to Kd Scoles, director
of housing management.
The improvements, based on
a recently completed, com
prehensive engineering study
of the facilities, will include
electrical work on several
houses, the re-plumbing of
three houses, structural
strengthening of six houses
and termite-fungus elimina
tion on others, Scoles said.
Phi Fsi, Delta Tau Delta and
Synergy houses will be re
plumbed and have fire sprink
ler systems installed at a cost of
$60,000 per house, he said. The
houses are all-wood, and Phi
Psi house in particular is very
difficult for the Fire Depart
ment to reach if it should catch
fire, Bill Offutt, assistant direc
tor of the Row, said.
The idea of installing sprink
ler systems has been consi
dered a number of times in the
past, Scoles said. The Storey
House fire "increased our
awareness" of fire danger in
the older houses, he added. As
a result of the fire, the Univer
sity will install fire sprinkler
systems in all the older Row
houses over the next four years,
Scoles said.
Although the sprinkler sys
tems will improve student
safety from fire, their contribu
tion to property protection is
the primary reason the Univer
sity will go ahead with expen
sive installment, he said.
Scoles said that the University
has already done much to in
sure the lives of Row house oc
cupants by improving fire es

capes from the houses and in
stalling smoke detectors.
Structural repairs will be
made on several houses, Offutt
said. An exterior wall will be
reinforced at the French House,
and a major beam will be re
placed at Hammarskjold, he
said. The houses will be made
more resilient in the event of
earthquakes because of the
work, Scoles said.
Improvements will be made
in the electrical systems of 20
older houses, he said. Wall out
lets will be added, the amount
of power running to each house
will be increased and exposed
wiring will be replaced, Scoles
said.
Because students are using
more electrical appliances
such as hair dryers and stereos,
the additions to the electrical
systems of the houses, some
more than 50 years old, are
needed, he said.
Termites and fungus will be
attacked in six of the houses,
according to Offutt. Columbae,
Delta Kappa Upsilon, Delta
Tau Delta, Durand, Synergy
and Hurlburt will be fumigated
at a total cost of $100,000,
Scoles said.
The report, which was com
pleted before the Storey House
fire, found the former student
residence to be "in pretty good
shape before it burned," Offutt
said. Aside from minor electri
cal problems, such as an occa
sional exposed wire, no serious
problems were noted, said
Scoles.
The $40,000 study of the
Row houses, conducted by four
private contractors, was com
missioned because the Univer
sity had not carried out a com
prehensive survey of the Row
in over 20 years, he said.
