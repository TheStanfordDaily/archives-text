# Registration forum gets small, vocal audience
## 
### Carl Johnson Staff Writer 
A two-day symposium on military
registration sponsored by Stanford
Against Conscription drew a small but
apparently anti-registration oriented
audience of 50 to Bishop Auditorium,
Saturday and Sunday.
Speakers included Congressman Les
Aspin (D-Wisconsin), and spokesper
sons from the State Department,
NAACP, War Resister's League, and
Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign
committee.
Congressman Aspin, a member of
the House Arms Services Committee,
got a cool reception for his endorsement
of peacetime registration for 19 and
20-year-olds. Countering claims that
registration could be accomplished in
less than 13 days in an emergency
without peace-time registration, Aspin
said "it is my experience that nothing
can be done in 13 days in Washington."
He advocated peace-time registration
as a means of assuring adequate man
power reserves in time of crisis, but
added that he opposed any form of real

conscription in peacetime.
Claiming that the volunteer army has
"been a victim of a dribble of bad
press," Aspin discounted charges that
the army is currently "too dumb, too
black, too small, and too expensive."
"There is no reason to abandon the
volunteer army in peacetime," Aspin
said. "It works, it has worked, it will
work."
William Barnett, director of the Of
fice of Systems Analysis at the State
Department, drew jeers and hisses from
the audience when he defended Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's hard-line policy in
the Persian Gulf, and the call for re
vitilization of military registration.
Several members of the audience
chastised Barnett for what they viewed
as his "arrogance and condescension,"
and for supporting policies that are
"quite insane." Barnett replied, "One of
the reasons (the State Department)
come out here (to speak at forums) is to
get some feedback. 1 believe I've ac
complished that part of my mission.
Michael Meyers, assistant national
director of the NAACP, said although

30 percent of the foot soldiers in the
Army are black, they represent only 6
percent of the officers.
"How can we explain the folly of tel
ling black people to fight for freedom
and justice overseas, when they don't
have freedom and justice at home?"
Meyers asked, followed by strong audi
ence applause.
Opposition to registration also came
from Martin Anderson, advisor to
Ronald Reagan's presidential campaign
and a senior fellow at the Hoover In
stitution.
"The experience of the last seven
years has demonstrated clearly that
with the proper support we can defend
this country and the principles on
which it was founded without resorting
to a method of raising military man
power that violates the very principle
we raise the force to defend," Anderson
said.
Max Holland, an expert on the Mid
dle East, denounced President Carter's
Persian Gulf Doctrine and the call for
military registration as an over-reaction
to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,

The Soviets, he contended, were re
sponding to internal instability in Af
ghanistan in much the same way as the
U.S. would if the same conditions pre
vailed in a country close to U.S. borders
such as Mexico. He added the U.S. has
intervened in a similar way in the past
in Vietnam, Guatamala, Iran and Chile,
although none of those countries adjoin
U.S. borders.
Robert Flacks, veteran anti-draft ac
tivist and founding member of Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS),
criticized registration as a first step to
compulsory military duty, or some form
of national service which would deny
youth the free time to mature without
government interference.
He further denounced the govern
ment's support of repressive regimes in
the Third World, and suggested that the
U.S. should instead support those who
would overturn these regimes.
Helen Michaelowski, of the War Re
sisters League, gave a pacifist perspec
tive on the draft issue, tracing the his
tory of draft resistance in this country
from the 17th century,
