## Towns boom Saudis expand 
### William Tuohy The Los Angeles Times 
DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia —
Not long ago, Dammam was a
small, sleepy fishing village on
an inlet of the Persian Gulf. A
few shrimp boats accounted for
most of the shipping activity.
But today Dammam is a
booming port, with huge
cranes and a long jetty stretch
ing out to accommodate
deep-water ships, plus grain
silos and facilities for handling
container cargo.
Nearby are parking lots
crowded with shiny new cars
and trucks from plants halfway
around the world.
Dammam is the main port for
eastern Saudi Arabia, includ
ing Dhahran, headquarters of
Aramco, the Arabian American
Oil Co., and al Khobar, a grow
ing new city.
About 400.000 people live in
the Dammam metropolitan
area, and planners see it be
coming a megalopolis stretch
ing nearly 100 miles from al
Khobar to the new industrial
city of Jubail by the end of the
century.
Jabail was once the home of a
handful of pearl divers but is
now a burgeoning complex
with a population expected to
reach 300.000 by the end of the
century.
Those are the boom towns of
Saudi Arabia, pacing the de
velopment of the kindgom, all
fueled by astronomical re
venues from the nearby oil
fields.
But their growth is rivaled
elsewhere in the country — at
the capital, Riyadh, at the
country's number one port,
Jidda, on the Red Sea, and at
the new industrial city of
Yanbu, which will serve as the
new Red Sea port for Medina.
Where ever one looks in
Saudi Arabia today, the growth
is staggering and so are the
numbers. The new five-year
development plan, the third,
which is to be announced in
detail next month, is expected
to call for spending nearly one
trillion riyals — about $300
billion.
Among other things, the oil
revenues will finance port and
industrial facilities in Dam
mam and elsewhere, as well as
relocated airports here and in
Riyadh and Jidda.

Major new natural gas sys
tems are being built at Jubail,
along with a petrochemical
complex and a new port to go
with it.
"We do not underestimate
the strains involved in this new
plan," Planning Minister
Hisam Nazer said in an inter
view. Nazer, 47, a graduate of
the University of California,
Los Angeles, said that the new
five-year plan will involve a
change in emphasis, "from
building up our infrastructure
— roads, schools, hospitals,
ports, airports, and desaliniza
tion plants — to constructing
the petrochemical plants and
other oil-related projects, as
well as developing agricul
ture."
"For we are quite aware," he
went on. "that we are a one
commodity country — namely
oil. And oil fields are not self
renewable like wheat fields. So
we must do all that we can to
ensure that we utilize the oil to
the maximum benefit."
Nazer said that he and other
officials in the government
want to avoid the mistake made
in Iran, and some other oil
wealthy countries, which tried
to industrialize in a hurry.
"We wish to avoid building
those industrial white
elephants in the desert,"he
said. "That's why we want to
concentrate on oil-related in
dustries, petrochemicals, plas
tics and light industry."
As one Western observer put
it: "There is an awfully big pie
to cut up here, and everyone's
standard of living is rising.
Further, with these enormous
oil revenues, you have a big
budgetary cushion, so there is
the capacity to make mistakes
without running into a disas
ter.
"Iran under the shah made
the mistake of trying to indus
trialize too quickjfy and of pour
ing billions of dollars into the
armed forces, which was ulti
mately mainly wasted, while at
the same time you had millions
of underprivileged in Iran.
"But here in Saudi Arabia
'there is 10 times as much
money per capita as in Iran, and
the Saudi royal family has
learned some lessons from the
downfall of the Pahlavis in
Iran."

numbers. The new five-year
development plan, the third,
which is to be announced in
detail next month, is expected
to call for spending nearly one
trillion riyals — about $300
billion.
Among other things, the oil
revenues will finance port and
industrial facilities in Dam
mam and elsewhere, as well as
relocated airports here and in
Riyadh and Jidda.

Major new natural gas sys
tems are being built at Jubail,
along with a petrochemical
complex and a new port to go
with it.
"We do not underestimate
the strains involved in this new
plan," Planning Minister
Hisam Nazer said in an inter
view. Nazer, 47, a graduate of
the University of California,
Los Angeles, said that the new
five-year plan will involve a
change in emphasis, "from
building up our infrastructure
— roads, schools, hospitals,
ports, airports, and desaliniza
tion plants — to constructing
the petrochemical plants and
other oil-related projects, as
well as developing agricul
ture."
"For we are quite aware," he
went on. "that we are a one
commodity country — namely
oil. And oil fields are not self
renewable like wheat fields. So
we must do all that we can to
ensure that we utilize the oil to
the maximum benefit."
Nazer said that he and other
officials in the government
want to avoid the mistake made
in Iran, and some other oil
wealthy countries, which tried
to industrialize in a hurry.
"We wish to avoid building
those industrial white
elephants in the desert,"he
said. "That's why we want to
concentrate on oil-related in
dustries, petrochemicals, plas
tics and light industry."
As one Western observer put
it: "There is an awfully big pie
to cut up here, and everyone's
standard of living is rising.
Further, with these enormous
oil revenues, you have a big
budgetary cushion, so there is
the capacity to make mistakes
without running into a disas
ter.
"Iran under the shah made
the mistake of trying to indus
trialize too quickjfy and of pour

armed forces, which was ulti
mately mainly wasted, while at
the same time you had millions

DAMMAM, Saudi Arabia —
Not long ago, Dammam was a
small, sleepy fishing village on
an inlet of the Persian Gulf. A
few shrimp boats accounted for
most of the shipping activity.
But today Dammam is a
booming port, with huge
cranes and a long jetty stretch
ing out to accommodate
deep-water ships, plus grain
silos and facilities for handling
container cargo.
Nearby are parking lots
crowded with shiny new cars
and trucks from plants halfway
around the world.
Dammam is the main port for
eastern Saudi Arabia, includ
ing Dhahran, headquarters of
Aramco, the Arabian American
Oil Co., and al Khobar, a grow
ing new city.
About 400.000 people live in
the Dammam metropolitan
area, and planners see it be
coming a megalopolis stretch
ing nearly 100 miles from al
Khobar to the new industrial
city of Jubail by the end of the
century.
Jabail was once the home of a
handful of pearl divers but is
now a burgeoning complex
with a population expected to
reach 300.000 by the end of the
century.
Those are the boom towns of
Saudi Arabia, pacing the de
velopment of the kindgom, all
fueled by astronomical re
venues from the nearby oil
fields.
But their growth is rivaled
elsewhere in the country — at
the capital, Riyadh, at the
country's number one port,
Jidda, on the Red Sea, and at
the new industrial city of
Yanbu, which will serve as the
new Red Sea port for Medina.
Where ever one looks in
Saudi Arabia today, the growth
is staggering and so are the
numbers. The new five-year
development plan, the third,
which is to be announced in
detail next month, is expected
to call for spending nearly one
trillion riyals — about $300
billion.
Among other things, the oil
revenues will finance port and
industrial facilities in Dam

Riyadh and Jidda.
