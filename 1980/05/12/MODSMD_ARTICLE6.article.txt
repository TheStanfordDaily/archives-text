STOCKHOLM — Is it the
end of an era, or merely a
temporary adjustment to the
new economic realities?
This question is being
asked throughout Sweden
and much of the rest of the
world in the wake of the
seeming breakdown of the
"Swedish model" of labor
management harmony that
had been the envy of other in
dustrialized countries for
much of this century.
There is no easy answer
and no handy yardstick to
measure the future impact of
Sweden's worst-ever labor
dispute, which has affected
virtually every aspect of the
nation's economy. Unlike the
French, the British and the
Italians, Swedes are not ac
customed to dealing with
massive strikes and lockouts.
Thus they are confused and
embittered, not so much at
the people on the other side of
tlie bargaining table as at
themselves and their country
for allowing labor relations to

reach such a state.
One economist is con
vinced that Swedish "good
sense" will finally restore
labor-management harmony.
He believes that Swedish
workers and management
will in the long run put their
country's interests above
their personal demands.
Some of these optimists see
a benefit in the current crisis.
They will come to accept,
one economist said, that they
may never again have it so
good as in the good old days
of the 1960s and early 19705,
when a rapidly rising stan
dard of living made the coun
try's 8.2 million inhabitants
among the most affluent in
the world. The living stan
dards will continue to rise,
according to one prediction,
but at a much reduced rate.
The government's reluc
tance to enter the fray is
rooted in the so-called
Saltsjobaden Agreement of
1939, which is regarded as
the charter for industrial
peace in Sweden.

Formulated under a Social
Democratic government and
named for a seaside resort
near Stockholm, the agree
ment sought to emphasize the
positive in labor
management relations.
It called upon both sides
"to have their disputes settled
as far as possible without re
sort to open conflict." And in
what seems to be an irony, in
view of the socialist govern
ment of the time, the docu
ment opposes government in
terference "in the present
freedom of collective bargain
ing "
Sweden, which was a net
creditor as recently as 1977,
now has a balance-of-trade
deficit of about $4 billion.
Then there are the chang
ing roles of the major parties
in the confrontation. As one
source put it:
"The government is not re
ally accustomed to governing
after so many years of Social
Democratic rule, and the So
cial Democrats are not used to
being in the opposition."
