# Campus eateries serve up alternatives
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
It's a myth that students here can't get good food
without driving off campus. Before you ask for your
neighbor's car to go to Mountain Mike's or the Yogurt
Village, consider the alternatives on campus. In addi
tion to the Coffee House and the Transition and Mar
cel's in Tresidder, there are several other on-campus
eateries such as Encina Station, the People's
Teahouse, Trancos' Yogurt Shop and the Italian
House Pizzeria.
Trancos' Yogurt
If Mrs. Field's cookies are a bit too calorific to
satisfy your sweet tooth, maybe you should stop by
the Trancos-run yogurt shop located at the People's
Teahouse in Wilbur.
The yogurt shop, which opened April 27, operates
Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. to midnight, and
weekdays from 1:30 to 4:30 and 7 to 9 p.m.
Yogurt is sold during the People's Teahouse off
hours to prevent conflicts of interest, said Trancos
resident Linda Moore. Trancos residents volunteer
for hour-long shifts at the yogurt stand. Proceeds go to
aid injured gymnast Brodie Lockard.
The yogurt idea was brought up by their resident
fellow mid-winter quarter and received unanimous
dorm approval, says Moore. Ninety-five percent of the
dorm has been involved in some capacity with 65
percent of the residents actually working shifts.
The project was designed to give students business
experience and to provide a service to the commun
ity.
Flavors alternate daily and include strawberry,

raspberry, peach, pineapple, blueberry and vanilla.
Toppings of honey nut granola or carob chips raise
the price from 75 cents to $1.
Moore said the shop will be taking a survey for
further suggestions.
The People's Teahouse
Although you may never have considered Asian-
American food for a late night snack, the People's
Teahouse in Wilbur has been profitably selling it for
the past seven years.
The Teahouse is open from 9 p.m. to midnight,
Monday through Saturday.
Asian specialties includebao (hot steamed buns) at
30 cents; siumai (steamed pork meatballs) at 25 cents;
ramen (hot noodles) for 40 cents; almond cookies at
10 cents; rice crackers at 10 cents and eight types of
tea.
According to Jeff Wong, one of four Teahouse man
agers, "All the shifts are manned by volunteer student
efforts." Most of the workers are from Okada, the
Asian-American theme house, although Wong said
it's not run officially by a specific house.
"It's run to promote Asian-American activities and
to provide funding for them," says Wong.
He says the production "A Song for a Nisei Fisher
man," which played at the Nitery in late April, re
ceived Teahouse funding.
Casa I tali ana Pizzeria
Instead of ordering Pizza Express this Saturday
night, try Casa Italiana.
Single-serving pizzas are priced from $1.80. Prices
average $2.80 to $3.

The pizzeria is open every Saturday from 5 p.m. to
midnight.
The student-run eatery started two and a half years
ago during the second year of the theme house, says
Operations Manager Tom Saxe.
Paid workers are chosen from the community
though preference is given to house people, says
Saxe. Twenty-three people work each night.
"Any profit goes toward (house) cultural ac
tivities," says Saxe.
In addition to pizza, the Pizzeria a
pizza folded in half. Another feature is the weekly
special. Specials include spaghetti and tortolini.
A 10 percent service charge plus 40 cents per per
son eliminates tipping.
Encina Station
Next time your friends reject a dorm lunch in favor
of Jack-in-the-Box, tell them an alternate hamburger
source â€” Encina Station.
Located behind Crothers and Crothers Memorial,
Encina Station offers such staples as hamburgers, hot
dogs and cold sandwiches from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The
menu features five or six combo plates for $1.85 and
donuts and snacks.
According to temporary manager Debbie Walker,
the Station plans to add pizza and a salad bar to the
menu.
"Eventually we want to turn it into a pub type of
thing," she says. Future ideas include expanding the
facilities, installing electronic games and longer
evening hours.
Encina Station is run by the new Tresidder dining
service, Servomation.
