Throughout its ten year existence, swopsi (Stanford
Workshops on Political and Social issues) has had no logo for use on its
letterhead, on posters, in publications, etc. we at swopsi feel that a
permanent symbol of the program would be a real asset. Therefore we
are pleased to announce the swopsi loco contest, a $50 cash prize will
be awarded to the winning entry. Entries should be submitted to the
swopsi office, 590-A Old union, by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, May 27. All entries
must have the entrant s name, address, and telephone number clearly
marked on the back, we urge you to come in to the office to look at
earlier attempts at a logo, gather general information on the program,
talk with the staff, etc. For further information call swopsi at 497-4305.
