A priest from a local convent was making his
daily stroll through a nearby town when a
hooker badly in need of work approached him
and said, "Five dollars for a quickie
The priest was confused and didn t under
stand the woman and he walked away
A litle while later, another prostitute ap
proached him and she too made an offer to
him. Five dollars for a quickie
Still confused, the priest again walked away
in bewilderment. Finally the priest made it back
to the convent, and being curious about what
happened in town he went to see Mother
Superior. Mother Superior, he asked,
What s a quickie?
She replied. Five dollars, same as in town
