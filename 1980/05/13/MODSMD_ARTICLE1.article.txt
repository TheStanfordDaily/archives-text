# In-balance budget gets Senate nod
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
WASHINGTON — The Senate
adopted a balanced 1981 budget last
night but only after it resoundingly op
posed the plans of President Jimmy
Carter and the House to halt Saturday
mail delivery and to collect a 10-
cent-a-gallon oil import fee.
The vote to give the nation its first
halanced budget in 12 years was 68 to
28.
The action set the stage for a more
difficult conference with the House
than had been expected. The Senate
bill would balance the budget for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 at spending
and revenue figures of $M 3.1 billion.
The House bill, adopted last week
proposed $611.8 billion in spending
and $613.8 billion in revenues — simi
lar to Carter's proposal.
Defense spending will be at the
center of controversy in a Senate-
House conference, as the Senate calls
for spending $7.8 billion more on de
fense than the House.
Test vote
The amendment given the best
chance of success was described by
backers as a test vote on Carter's 10-
cents-a-gallon gasoline conservation
tee that takes effect Thursday.
Carter's fee. imposed on imported
crude oil in March, will start affecting
prices at the gasoline pump on Thurs
day. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's
(D-Ohio) amendment, co-sponsored
by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.)„wiped out
a procedural obstacle in the Senate
budget resolution that would have pre
vented Congress from trying to repeal
the fee before late August. There is
strong sentiment in both the Senate
and the House to repeal the fee now.
Under the 1974 Congressional
Budget Act. Congress faced a deadline
on Thursday to approve a 198 1 budget
resolution.
Ceilings
Action on the budget package was
also needed to lift the ceiling on
current-year spending to permit con
tinued funding for such federal prog
rams as food stamps, black lung be
nefits and refugee aid.
Although differing on spending
priorities, the House and Senate pac
kages agree on a number of important
points.
They both project balanced budgets.
They earmark $10 billion from Car
ter's oil import fee for business tax cuts
and rollbacks in scheduled Social Sec
urity tax increases. And they would
impose unprecedented discipline on
congressional committees to approve
spending cuts.
In major differences:
— The Senate would eliminate, bv
the end of fiscal 198 1, all 200,000 pub
lic service jobs under the Comprehen
sive Employment and Training Act.
The House and Carter recommended
reducing the program by 50,000 jobs.
— The Senate would cut the $9.7
billion food stamp program by a $1.4
billion, compared to a House plan to
reduce it by $520 million. Unlike the
House, the Senate would cut $600 mill
ion in stamps that now go to families
whose children receive free school
lunches.
— The Senate would keep general
revenue sharing for states alive by di
verting $700 million from so-called
"categorical" grant programs in which
the funds must be spent in federally
mandated ways. The House would
eliminate the entire $1.7 billion state
portion of general revenue sharing.
More disagreement
The Saturday mail amendment by
Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and David
Pryor (D-Ark.) also puts the Senate in
disagreement with the House, which
favors elimination of Saturday mail.
By a voice vote, the Senate agreed to
restore $300 million for Saturday mail
deliveries, paying for that increase by
cutting federal administrative costs an
additional 1 percent across-the-board,
except for defense.
The 1 percent cut is on top of a 5
percent reduction in the bureaucracy
already approved by the Budget Com
mittee and some observers believe the
new cut is unrealistic.

cent-a-gallon oil import fee.
The vote to give the nation its first
halanced budget in 12 years was 68 to
28.
The action set the stage for a more
difficult conference with the House
than had been expected. The Senate
bill would balance the budget for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 at spending
and revenue figures of $M 3.1 billion.
The House bill, adopted last week
proposed $611.8 billion in spending
and $613.8 billion in revenues — simi
lar to Carter's proposal.
Defense spending will be at the
center of controversy in a Senate-
House conference, as the Senate calls
for spending $7.8 billion more on de
fense than the House.
Test vote
The amendment given the best
chance of success was described by
backers as a test vote on Carter's 10-
cents-a-gallon gasoline conservation
tee that takes effect Thursday.
Carter's fee. imposed on imported
crude oil in March, will start affecting
prices at the gasoline pump on Thurs
day. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum's
(D-Ohio) amendment, co-sponsored
by Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.)„wiped out
a procedural obstacle in the Senate
budget resolution that would have pre
vented Congress from trying to repeal
the fee before late August. There is
strong sentiment in both the Senate
and the House to repeal the fee now.
Under the 1974 Congressional
Budget Act. Congress faced a deadline
on Thursday to approve a 198 1 budget
resolution.
Ceilings
Action on the budget package was
also needed to lift the ceiling on
current-year spending to permit con
tinued funding for such federal prog
rams as food stamps, black lung be
nefits and refugee aid.
Although differing on spending
priorities, the House and Senate pac
kages agree on a number of important
points.
They both project balanced budgets.
They earmark $10 billion from Car
ter's oil import fee for business tax cuts
and rollbacks in scheduled Social Sec
urity tax increases. And they would
impose unprecedented discipline on
congressional committees to approve
spending cuts.
In major differences:
— The Senate would eliminate, bv
the end of fiscal 198 1, all 200,000 pub
lic service jobs under the Comprehen
sive Employment and Training Act.
The House and Carter recommended
reducing the program by 50,000 jobs.
— The Senate would cut the $9.7
billion food stamp program by a $1.4
billion, compared to a House plan to
reduce it by $520 million. Unlike the
House, the Senate would cut $600 mill
ion in stamps that now go to families
whose children receive free school
lunches.
— The Senate would keep general
revenue sharing for states alive by di
verting $700 million from so-called
"categorical" grant programs in which
the funds must be spent in federally
mandated ways. The House would
eliminate the entire $1.7 billion state
portion of general revenue sharing.
More disagreement
The Saturday mail amendment by
Sens. John Glenn (D-Ohio) and David
Pryor (D-Ark.) also puts the Senate in
disagreement with the House, which
favors elimination of Saturday mail.
By a voice vote, the Senate agreed to
restore $300 million for Saturday mail
deliveries, paying for that increase by
cutting federal administrative costs an
additional 1 percent across-the-board,
except for defense.
The 1 percent cut is on top of a 5
percent reduction in the bureaucracy
already approved by the Budget Com
mittee and some observers believe the
new cut is unrealistic.
