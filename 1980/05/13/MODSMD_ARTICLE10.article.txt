## First high-level U.S.-Soviet contact Gromyko to host Muskie in Moscow 
### Dan Fisher The Los Angeles Times 
MOSCOW — Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko is
ready to meet the new U.S. sec
retary of state, Edmund Muskie,
in Vienna on Friday, but the
Soviets are not expecting much
— and will not be offering much
For Soviet-American rela
tions have sunk to a dangerous
low during the Carter administ
ration, and the Kremlin sees no
real prospect for improvement as
long as President Carter, to
whom many Soviets refer as a
"born-again hawk," remains in
office.
In deference to Friday's
scheduled meeting, the official
Soviet press adopted a slightly
less vitriolic anti-American line
over the weekend than has been
characteristic in recent days. A
Pravda report on Sunday called
for the first time for "a frank and
honest dialogue" as necessary to
begin any normalization of rela
tions.
The report was seen here as
indicating that the Kremlin
wants to maintain high-level
contact with the Carter administ
ration, if only to keep a line of
communication open. Beyond
that, however, there are so far no
indications that Moscow is ready
to offer any serious and realistic
initiatives to resolve the out
standing issues.
"The Soviet side could offer
new diplomatic initiatives, but
they'd only be rejected in
Washington," one official Soviet
source commented.
Democrat
For another thing, the man in
the White House is a Democrat
and, as another official said, "We
seem to have better relations
with Republican administrations
than with Democratic ones. The
Republicans seem less idealis
tic."
One influential and well
informed Communist Party
member recalled the other day
the concern with which Moscow
first reacted to Richard Nixon's
victory in the 1968 presidential
election.
Many here feared that the pre
sence of Nixon, a Republican
and outspoken anti-Communist
in the White House promised
hard times ahead in Soviet-
American relations, the party
member said. But then he shrug

ged and recounted how, four
years later, Nixon and Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev met
here, signed the first strategic
arms limitation treaty and
ushered in the era of detente.
First contact
The Muskie-Gromyko meet
ing will be the first high-level
contact between the Kremlin
leadership and the Carter ad
ministration since the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan last De r
cember.
If anything, Moscow appears
to have reacted to the worsening
of the relationship by digging in
its heels. Its line on Afghanistan
and Iran has become progres
sively tougher over the last sev
eral months.
No one would expect the
Soviet leadership to publicly tip
its hand even if it were ready to
budge from its rigid positions re
garding the most critical East-
West issues.
Political terms
What is more ominous is that
Soviet officials show the same
recalcitrance in private and that
they justify their positions in
hard-headed political, rather
than ideological, terms. They see
no need to back down.
One semi-official Soviet
source pointed to the ill-fated
U.S. attempt to rescue the
American hostages held in Iran
as only the latest example of the
Carter administration's ten-;
dency to shoot itself in the foot.
Carter's absence from last
week's funeral of Yugoslavia's
President Tito is another. "Why
should we make any moves,
when all we have to do is wait
while Washington blunders?"
the source asked.
Another noted that although
Western Europe has supported
the United States on such
policies as modernization of the
Atlantic alliance's nuclear deter
rent. economic sanctions against
Iran and. to some extent, the
Olympic boycott, it has done so
reluctantly. "We'll never split
the alliance militarily," this
source said, "but there is already
a serious split over approach."
Backing down
As this source made clear,
Moscow still believes that it can
play upon those divisions within
the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization to gain its political
ends without backing down on

such issues as Afghanistan or its
own buildup of nuclear weapons
in Europe.
And underlying all is en
hanced self-confidence in Soviet
military might and in the Krem
lin's ability to project that confi
dence.
The hardening of the official
Soviet stance does not mean that
it is willing to write off the rela
tionship with the United States.
There appears genuine concern
here, for example, that the Ira
nian situation could get out of
hand and lead to a direct clash
that neither side wants. The
Soviets are also worried that if
the SALT process collapses it
will lead quickly to new genera
tions of nuclear armaments over
which it may be nearly impossi
ble to regain control.

About the most that anyone
here seems to believe possible is
that Muskie and Gromyko might
agree on an agenda for a second
meeting some weeks later.
Both sides" are committed to
the SALT process, and the two
foreign ministers may find com
mon ground there. American
sources have said in recent weeks
that, unless something is done
soon, the SALT II Treaty signed
less than a year ago but not
ratified by the U.S. Senate, could
quickly unravel.
Both sides have thus far been
complying with the terms of
SALT II even though the pact
has not been ratified and is not
likely to be until after the
November election at the ear
liest.

which it may be nearly impossi
ble to regain control.

About the most that anyone
here seems to believe possible is
that Muskie and Gromyko might
agree on an agenda for a second
meeting some weeks later.
Both sides" are committed to
the SALT process, and the two
foreign ministers may find com
mon ground there. American
sources have said in recent weeks
that, unless something is done
soon, the SALT II Treaty signed
less than a year ago but not
ratified by the U.S. Senate, could
quickly unravel.
Both sides have thus far been
complying with the terms of
SALT II even though the pact
has not been ratified and is not
likely to be until after the
November election at the ear
liest.
MOSCOW — Soviet Foreign
Minister Andrei Gromyko is
ready to meet the new U.S. sec
retary of state, Edmund Muskie,
in Vienna on Friday, but the
Soviets are not expecting much
— and will not be offering much
For Soviet-American rela
tions have sunk to a dangerous
low during the Carter administ
ration, and the Kremlin sees no
real prospect for improvement as
long as President Carter, to
whom many Soviets refer as a
"born-again hawk," remains in
office.
In deference to Friday's
scheduled meeting, the official
Soviet press adopted a slightly
less vitriolic anti-American line
over the weekend than has been
characteristic in recent days. A
Pravda report on Sunday called
for the first time for "a frank and
honest dialogue" as necessary to
begin any normalization of rela
tions.
The report was seen here as
indicating that the Kremlin
wants to maintain high-level
contact with the Carter administ
ration, if only to keep a line of
communication open. Beyond
that, however, there are so far no
indications that Moscow is ready
to offer any serious and realistic
initiatives to resolve the out
standing issues.
"The Soviet side could offer
new diplomatic initiatives, but
they'd only be rejected in
Washington," one official Soviet
source commented.
Democrat
For another thing, the man in
the White House is a Democrat
and, as another official said, "We
seem to have better relations
with Republican administrations
than with Democratic ones. The
Republicans seem less idealis
tic."
One influential and well
informed Communist Party
member recalled the other day
the concern with which Moscow
first reacted to Richard Nixon's
victory in the 1968 presidential
election.
Many here feared that the pre
sence of Nixon, a Republican
and outspoken anti-Communist
in the White House promised
hard times ahead in Soviet-
American relations, the party
member said. But then he shrug

ged and recounted how, four
years later, Nixon and Soviet
leader Leonid Brezhnev met
here, signed the first strategic
arms limitation treaty and
ushered in the era of detente.
First contact
The Muskie-Gromyko meet
ing will be the first high-level
contact between the Kremlin
leadership and the Carter ad
ministration since the Soviet in
vasion of Afghanistan last De r
cember.
If anything, Moscow appears
to have reacted to the worsening
of the relationship by digging in
its heels. Its line on Afghanistan
and Iran has become progres
sively tougher over the last sev
eral months.
No one would expect the
Soviet leadership to publicly tip
its hand even if it were ready to
budge from its rigid positions re
garding the most critical East-
West issues.
Political terms
What is more ominous is that
Soviet officials show the same
recalcitrance in private and that
they justify their positions in
hard-headed political, rather
than ideological, terms. They see
no need to back down.
One semi-official Soviet
source pointed to the ill-fated
U.S. attempt to rescue the
American hostages held in Iran
as only the latest example of the
Carter administration's ten-;
dency to shoot itself in the foot.
Carter's absence from last
week's funeral of Yugoslavia's
President Tito is another. "Why
should we make any moves,
when all we have to do is wait
while Washington blunders?"
the source asked.
Another noted that although
Western Europe has supported
the United States on such
policies as modernization of the
Atlantic alliance's nuclear deter
rent. economic sanctions against
Iran and. to some extent, the
Olympic boycott, it has done so
reluctantly. "We'll never split
the alliance militarily," this
source said, "but there is already
a serious split over approach."
Backing down
As this source made clear,
Moscow still believes that it can
play upon those divisions within
the North Atlantic Treaty Or
ganization to gain its political
ends without backing down on

such issues as Afghanistan or its
own buildup of nuclear weapons
in Europe.
And underlying all is en
hanced self-confidence in Soviet
military might and in the Krem
lin's ability to project that confi
dence.
The hardening of the official
Soviet stance does not mean that
it is willing to write off the rela
tionship with the United States.
There appears genuine concern
here, for example, that the Ira
nian situation could get out of
hand and lead to a direct clash
that neither side wants. The
Soviets are also worried that if
the SALT process collapses it
will lead quickly to new genera
tions of nuclear armaments over
which it may be nearly impossi
ble to regain control.
