# Chinese woo ASEAN
## 
### Keyes Beech The Los Angeles Times 
BANGKOK, Thailand —
Two of Asia's most resourceful
diplomats — the Chinese and
Vietnamese foreign ministers —
are matching skills over the fu
ture of a devastated Cambodia.
Huang Hua of China met with
Thai government officials
Thursday as part of a continuing
campaign to stiffen opposition to
Vietnam's military takeover of
Cambodia and head off Soviet
expansion in Southeast Asia.
When Huang arrived in
Bangkok, his Vietnamese adver
sary. Nguyen Co Thach. was al
ready here en route to Kuala
Lumpur for talks with Malaysian
officials. Thach is scheduled to
have his own meeting with Thai
leaders May 17-20.
The rival foreign ministers,
both regarded as tough and skill
ful negotiators, are crisscrossing
this region, attempting to woo
members of ASEAN, the non
communist Association of
Southeast Asian Nations —
Thailand. Malaysia, Singapore.
Indonesia and the Philippines.
Fourteen months after
Moscow-backed Vietnamese
troops invaded Cambodia and
overthrew the Chinese-backed
regime of Premier Pol Pot, no
solution to the Cambodian prob
lem is in sight.
No recognition
The ASEAN countries, along
with China and the United
States, have steadfastly refused
to recognize the Hanoi-backed
regime in Phnom Penh and de
manded the withdrawal of an es
timated 200,000 Vietnamese
troops.
Hanoi has refused to budge,
insisting that the situation is "ir
reversible."
There have been signs of ero
sion in the anti-Vietnam front,
and the Chinese arc plainly wor

ried that some ASEAN mem
bers will break ranks in order to
reach an accommodation with
Hanoi.
Chinese threat
Both Malaysia and Indonesia,
where anti-Chinese sentiment is
strong, have let it be known that
they consider China a bigger
threat to Southeast Asia than
Vietnam or the Soviet Union.
China has had some doubts
about U.S. resolve since last
month, when Washington called
for a political solution to the
Cambodian problem, apparently
holding out the promise of dip
lomatic recognition and
economic aid to Hanoi in the
hope of undermining Soviet in
fluence.
The Chinese insist that no
political solution to the Cambo
dian problem is possible if Hanoi
refuses to withdraw its troops.
Standard line
In his talks with Thai Prime
Minister Prem Tinsulanond and
Foreign Minister Siddhi Savet
sila. Huang Hua reportedly fol
lowed the familiar Chinese line,
which goes like this:
The only way to deal with
Hanoi is to be obstinate. Don't
yield an inch. Pol Pot's guerrilla
forces, which were on the ropes
last fall, are now strong and
well-armed and pose a renewed
threat to the Vietnamese. In
short, the idea is to bleed Viet
nam.
The only thing wrong with this
line of thought, as some Western
diplomats see it. is that it is the
Cambodians rather than the Vie
tnamese who will suffer most.
Cambodia faces the prospect, if
not yet the reality, of another
famine before the year ends.
Continued fighting is bound to
make matters worse.
The continuing demand for a
Vietnamese withdrawal also
strikes some diplomats as un

realistic because it fails to reckon
with the consequences.
"If the Vietnamese with
drew," one diplomat said, "they
would create a power vacuum
that only Pol Pot and his Khmer
Rouge could fill. Do we want
that after Pol Pot has already kil
led oft' - million or so of his own
people?"
Conversations with Cambo
dians in and outside the country
reflect the same feelings: much
as the Cambodians may hate the
Vietnamese, they hate and fear
Pol Pot even more.

nam.
The only thing wrong with this
line of thought, as some Western
diplomats see it. is that it is the
Cambodians rather than the Vie
tnamese who will suffer most.
Cambodia faces the prospect, if
not yet the reality, of another
famine before the year ends.
Continued fighting is bound to
make matters worse.
The continuing demand for a
Vietnamese withdrawal also
strikes some diplomats as un

realistic because it fails to reckon
with the consequences.
"If the Vietnamese with
drew," one diplomat said, "they
would create a power vacuum
that only Pol Pot and his Khmer
Rouge could fill. Do we want
that after Pol Pot has already kil
led oft' - million or so of his own
people?"
Conversations with Cambo
dians in and outside the country
reflect the same feelings: much
as the Cambodians may hate the
Vietnamese, they hate and fear
Pol Pot even more.
