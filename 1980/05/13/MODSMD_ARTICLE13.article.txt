ANKARA, Turkey â€” A
group of 150 Libyans, most of
them university students, took
over the Libyan Embassy here
today and formed a "people's
committee" to handle its ad
ministration, police reported.
The group, chanting slogans
hailing Libyan leader Col.
Moammar Khadafy, declared
that the embassy will now be cal
led a "people's bureau."
The Libyan ambassador to
Turkey, Saaddedin Abushnireb,
said he had turned over his duties
to a five-man committee chosen
by the Libyan nationals in Ank
ara. The envoy said he,would re
turn to Tripoli.
A similar incident was re
ported in Vienna today. A caller
who identified himself as an Au
strian employed at the embassy
told The Associated Press that
members of a people's commit
tee from Libya had taken over
the embassy and transformed it
into a People's Bureau.
"Everything happened sud
denly. We ourselves do not know
what happened. The old em
bassy staff was ordered to leave
and the members of the people's
committee took over," she said.
The takeovers appeared to be

in line with the orders Khadafy
issued last fall for takeovers of
Libyan diplomatic missions
elsewhere in the world. At that
time several Libyan embassies in
European capitals, including
those in London and Rome,
were turned over to the so-called
"people's committees."
Police did not interfere. The
Turkish government simply or
dered stepped-up security
around the embassy.
The seizures were the latest in
a series of Libyan political de
velopments that have spilled
over into Europe and the United
States.
Five Libyan dissidents, oppo
nents of Khadafy, have been kil
led in Europe in the last two
months: three in Rome ancKjwo
in London. In Beirut,a Lebanese
editor who opposed Khadafy
also was killed.
Italian and British police are
investigating the possibility that
supporters of Khadafy are sys
tematically killing his opponent*""
abroad.
In the United States, the FBI
reportedly discovered a "hit list"
of two dozen Libyan students
whom the Tripoli government
was trying to force to return
home.
