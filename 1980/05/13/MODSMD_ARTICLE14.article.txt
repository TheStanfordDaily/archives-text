# Europe takes larger role in NATO defense
## 
### Bradley Graham The Washington Post 
BRUSSELS — Three decades after its
founding, the Western alliance is at a
political crossroad, marked by America's
preoccupation with conflicts outside
Europe and by Europe's own heightened
sense of itself.
While the outlines of this juncture have
been evolv ing for some time, the crisis in
Afghanistan and Iran clearly accelerated
the process.
An important turn comes this week at a
meeting of foreign ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. In a de
monstration of post-Afghanistan anti-
Soviet resolve, the 15 alliance members
are expected to approve a speed-up of
NATO defense modernization plans. But
the session will be of deeper significance
for the accent it puts on Europe's in
creased contribution.
"It's the beginning of the beginning" of
a reformulation of the Western defense
partnership, said an experienced NATO
official, although just what this means
eventually for re-dividing alliance milit
ary responsibilities and for insuring politi
cal consensus is still largely unexamined.
On the military side, it is likely to trans
late into a considerably larger role for
Europe in its own defense. On the dip
lomatic front, it will require NATO to

give greater heed to the common market
political apparatus, used very visibly by
the Europeans in recent months to define
policies on Afghanistan and Iran, which
differed in part from those of the United
States.
Avoiding debate
Part of the difficulty in assessing the
changing order is that the allies them
selves have avoided any deep discussion
of it. Much of the inter-alliance squabbl
ing over the past few months has instead
been about matters of style, such surface
considerations as whether consultations
were adequate, whether America over
reacted, whether Europe shirked,
whether President Jimmy Carter meant
what he said or did what he meant, and so
on.
The differences between allies have
been excused as basically disagreements
about tactics, not vital isues. But the
stream of verbal assurances about endur
ing U.S.-European friendship and com
mon Atlantic purpose have not washed
away the keen sense that Western alliance
relations need to be placed on new foot
ings. How to do this remains the central
problem.
Of course, there have been transatlan
tic highs and lows before. One tendency
evident among Western diplomats and

European politicans now is to place the
latest tensions on a par with the others —
and say these, too, shall pass. Comparing
NATO quarrels with marriage squabbles
which come and go has become a favorite
analogy here.
Alliance strained
At the same time, commentators assert
that the recent tussles are putting the al
liance under strains which arguably are
worse than at any point in NATO's 31-
year history.
Moreover, what has set differences on
Afghanistan apart from previous alliance
strains — over, for instance, Vietnam,
Palestine, oil, nuclear non-proliferation,
trade and the dollar — is that the current
crisis addresses NATO's cornerstone
concern: how to respond to the Soviet
threat.
NATO sources say that a marked rap
proachment, at least, has been achieved
between what were originally differing
national viewpoints on why the Soviets
did what they did. There is also reportedly
common agreement within NATO that
the Afghanistan invasion, while outside
the NATO treaty area, constitutes a seri
ous threat to East-West relations and re
quires a joint alliance response.
Defend Gulf?
But the question of how to respond has
been further complicated by the U.S.

pledge to defend the Persian Gulf.
As one West German official
explained, the real guarantee to peace in
the Middle East is seen here not as a milit
ary problem but rather dependent on a
diplomatic resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
In the making of foreign policy, it is
evident the European nations increas
ingly prefer to do their thinking outside
NATO as well, in the context of the
Common Market. Again this develop
ment is not new. The active pursuit of
European political cooperation has
existed in tandem with economic cooper
ation for more than a decade.
But European leaders quite aggres
sively used the twin crises of Afghanistan
and Iran to forge further their own politi
cal directorate distinct from NATO's.
Europe's position on a trade embargo
against Iran, economic sanctions against
the Soviet Union and a boycott of the
Moscow Olympics were all crafted
chiefly in the councils of the European
community.
U.S. officials have generally encour
aged European unity, with the thought
that a united Europe could be a better
partner. But U.S. officials also make note
of the threat a European bloc might pose
to fundamental cohesion in the West.

sense of itself.
While the outlines of this juncture have
been evolv ing for some time, the crisis in
Afghanistan and Iran clearly accelerated
the process.
An important turn comes this week at a
meeting of foreign ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization. In a de
monstration of post-Afghanistan anti-
Soviet resolve, the 15 alliance members
are expected to approve a speed-up of
NATO defense modernization plans. But
the session will be of deeper significance
for the accent it puts on Europe's in
creased contribution.
"It's the beginning of the beginning" of
a reformulation of the Western defense
partnership, said an experienced NATO
official, although just what this means
eventually for re-dividing alliance milit
ary responsibilities and for insuring politi
cal consensus is still largely unexamined.
On the military side, it is likely to trans
late into a considerably larger role for
Europe in its own defense. On the dip
lomatic front, it will require NATO to

give greater heed to the common market
political apparatus, used very visibly by
the Europeans in recent months to define
policies on Afghanistan and Iran, which
differed in part from those of the United
States.
Avoiding debate
Part of the difficulty in assessing the
changing order is that the allies them
selves have avoided any deep discussion
of it. Much of the inter-alliance squabbl
ing over the past few months has instead
been about matters of style, such surface
considerations as whether consultations
were adequate, whether America over
reacted, whether Europe shirked,
whether President Jimmy Carter meant
what he said or did what he meant, and so
on.
The differences between allies have
been excused as basically disagreements
about tactics, not vital isues. But the
stream of verbal assurances about endur
ing U.S.-European friendship and com
mon Atlantic purpose have not washed
away the keen sense that Western alliance
relations need to be placed on new foot
ings. How to do this remains the central
problem.
Of course, there have been transatlan
tic highs and lows before. One tendency
evident among Western diplomats and

European politicans now is to place the
latest tensions on a par with the others —
and say these, too, shall pass. Comparing
NATO quarrels with marriage squabbles
which come and go has become a favorite
analogy here.
Alliance strained
At the same time, commentators assert
that the recent tussles are putting the al
liance under strains which arguably are
worse than at any point in NATO's 31-
year history.
Moreover, what has set differences on
Afghanistan apart from previous alliance
strains — over, for instance, Vietnam,
Palestine, oil, nuclear non-proliferation,
trade and the dollar — is that the current
crisis addresses NATO's cornerstone
concern: how to respond to the Soviet
threat.
NATO sources say that a marked rap
proachment, at least, has been achieved
between what were originally differing
national viewpoints on why the Soviets
did what they did. There is also reportedly
common agreement within NATO that
the Afghanistan invasion, while outside
the NATO treaty area, constitutes a seri
ous threat to East-West relations and re
quires a joint alliance response.
Defend Gulf?
But the question of how to respond has
been further complicated by the U.S.

pledge to defend the Persian Gulf.
As one West German official
explained, the real guarantee to peace in
the Middle East is seen here not as a milit
ary problem but rather dependent on a
diplomatic resolution of the Arab-Israeli
conflict.
In the making of foreign policy, it is
evident the European nations increas
ingly prefer to do their thinking outside
NATO as well, in the context of the
Common Market. Again this develop
ment is not new. The active pursuit of
European political cooperation has
existed in tandem with economic cooper
ation for more than a decade.
But European leaders quite aggres
sively used the twin crises of Afghanistan
and Iran to forge further their own politi
cal directorate distinct from NATO's.
Europe's position on a trade embargo
against Iran, economic sanctions against
the Soviet Union and a boycott of the
Moscow Olympics were all crafted
chiefly in the councils of the European
community.
U.S. officials have generally encour
aged European unity, with the thought
that a united Europe could be a better
partner. But U.S. officials also make note
of the threat a European bloc might pose
to fundamental cohesion in the West.
BRUSSELS — Three decades after its
founding, the Western alliance is at a
political crossroad, marked by America's
preoccupation with conflicts outside
Europe and by Europe's own heightened
