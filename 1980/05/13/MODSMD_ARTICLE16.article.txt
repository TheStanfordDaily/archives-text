# Combating rising energy costs
## University seeks utility rate change 
### Robert Brody Staff Writer 
To combat skyrocketing
energy costs, the University has
devised a plan which seeks to
modify the rate structure used to
bill energy charges and which
calls for increased conservation
in residences and classrooms.
Despite reductions in energy
use since last year, the total
energy bill for the University
continues to increase, according
to Harry Warren of the energy
program office here.
Gas, which is measured in
units called therms, cost 26.8
cents per therm last September
and is expected to cost 49 cents
per therm by August, an 82 per
cent increase. Electricity costs
similarly are expected to jump
from 3.3 cents per kilowatt hour
to 48.8 cents, a 45 percent in
crease.
To try to counter an antici
pated $8 11,000 deficit for
1979-80 on energy bills due to
these increases, the University
has created a two-part plan

which officials here say could
substantially reduce the Univer
sity's energy bills.
One part of the plan calls for
the California Public Utilities
Commission (PUC) to reclassify
the University's energy user
status. Presently, the University
is classified as an industrial user.
This classification requires the
University to pay more for
energy related services than
users in other classifications, ac
cording to Lynda Weisberg,
energy program manager here.
ITiough there is no existing
classification other than indust
rial that the University could be
put under, officials here hope
that the PUC can establish a new
category of energy users.
To promote its idea, the Uni
versity last week met with rep
resentatives from several state
universities and colleges in an at
tempt to form a coalition of edu
cational institutions that seek the
same switch in user designation.
Meeting participants, which
included representatives from

the University of California,
USC, Cat lech, the California
community college system and
the Council of Northern and
Southern California Hospitals,
decided to work with the Na
tional Organization of College
and University Business Officers
to suggest these policy changes
to the PUC, according to Weis
berg.
The group also decided to con
tact Sacramento legislators to
explain the unique problem
faced by educational and hospi
tal organizations in paying
energy bills.
The plan's second plank is a
continuation of the already suc
cessful energy conservation
program in residences and clas
srooms.
Changes to be made at the
Graduate School of Business this
summer include:
— extensive renovation of the
heating and cooling system;
— alterations in the usage pat
tern of classrooms and offices;
and

— installation (it monitoring
devices that automatically will
turn lights off in unused building
areas.
These modifications are ex
pected to reduce energy con
sumption at the CiSH by 50 per
cent, Warren said.
The Biz School program is a
pilot study which, if successful,
will be extended to the Law
School and other buildings.
Another innovation will be the
designation of individuals in
each of the schools, such as the
School of Humanities and Sci
ences, to implement conserva
tion plans. These building mana
gers will guide energy projects in
the schools from which they are
appointed, Weisberg said.
Student residences will con
tinue to be supervised by the
Energy Conservation Center.
Established in 1977, the center
has succeeded in reducing
energy usage by 25 percent in
dormitories and by 15 percent in
the Cowell cluster and Row
houses since 1975.
