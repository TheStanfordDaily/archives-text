# Military splits with CIA on U.S. defense estimates
## 
### Michael Getler The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — An ex
traordinary split has developed
between military and civilian in
telligence agencies over conclu
sions reached by the director of
the ( 1A about the balance of
strategic military power between
the Lnited States and the Soviet
Union.
The military agencies are argu
ing that the CI A summary — of a
top-secret, government-wide as
sessment of the power balance
that goes to President Carter is
"not representative" of the
analytical work that went into
preparing that assessment.
Perhaps more importantly, the
military contends that the job of
comparing U.S. and Soviet
forces and how they might fare in
an atomic struggle constitutes
what is called a "net assess
ment." Preparing such assess
ments, they contend, is the pre
rogative of the Joint Chiefs of
Statf and the Defense Depart
ment rather than the CIA.
The CIA, this argument goes,
should confine itself to figuring
out what the Soviets are doing.
The dispute centers around
the latest version of the National
Intelligence Estimate, which
goes from the nation's top intel
ligence officer, CIA chief
Stansfield Turner, a retired ad
miral, to the president.
That Turner is at the center of
this dispute is not surprising. The
ex-Navy man has been the target
of some criticism from military

and civilian defense officials in
recent years as he, under Car
ter's orders, has solidified his
sometimes controversial control
over the nation's intelligence ap
paratus.
Because the National Intelli
gence Estimates are widely' ircu
lated among the top rungs of
government, and are so au
thoritative, these estimates have
great importance within the
bureaucracy in shaping future
U.S. national security policy on
many issues.
Officials say the Nl I: summary
contains what is called a "foot
note," but which is in fact a sharp
dissent by the Pentagon's
military-run Defense Intelli
gence Agency (OIA ) together
with the intelligence chiefs of the
three armed services.
Administration sources call
the breadth of the split with the
civilian-run CIA "unpre
cedented.' \ well-informed
Pentagon source says:"It is fair
to say this probably as strong
an assertion ot dissent on the
part of the DIA to the director of
central intelligence" as has been
registered.
The State Department's
Bureau of Intelligence and Re
search and the super-secret Na
tional Security Agency did not
join in the dissent, sources say.
The actual conclusions of the
report arc highly classified, but
sources suggest they contain a
mixed bag of assessments that
trouble the military.
On the one hand, the defense
agencies are said to believe that
the report underestimates the re
lative momentum of the Soviet
strategic military buildup in
comparison to that of the United
States, arguing in effect that the
picture is even grimmer than
presented. Yet the military also
contends, other sources say, that
the new report overestimates the
Soviet threat that could be
mounted against the Pentagon's
planned MX super-missile.
The military is counting on the
MX as its future land-based,
long-range missile force. Critics
contend the Soviets, with their
bigger missiles, will always be
able to lob enough atomic
warheads at the MX shelters to
make survival of a few of them
not worth the huge cost, esti
mated by some at more than $60
billion. Supporters of MX argue
that the Soviets wouldn't use
their missiles in that fashion.
CIA officials say that full-scale

net assessments, involving such
things as paper war games to fi
gure out who wins, are indeed
the Pentagon's job. The CIA
claims it is not doing that but
rather has been using "a more
sophisticated form of analysis in
recent years" and "adding some
judgments" to its findings, rather
than just counting Soviet mis
siles.
I he CI A officials contend that
many people within the govern
ment find this technique helpful
in assessing the power balance, a
claim confirmed in interviews
with civilian officials elsewhere
in government. Some CIA offi
cials suspect the military objec
tions at this time may have an
element of politics to them, seek
ing perhaps to take advantage of
an 'election year to support those
arguing tor higher defense
spending in face of the Soviet
threat. •
Pentagon sources suggest it
undoubtedly will be left to the
president to resolve the dispute
over who does what kind of as
sessment. Hie report summary
also has gone to Capitol 112 I ill. and
sources say the House subcom
mittee of intelligence oversight
probably will begin closed-door
hearings next week on disputed
"footnote."
The National Intelligence Es
timates. produced by the entire
U.S. intelligence community,
normally include at least two
main volumes, the summary and
the back-up factual and analyti
cal data.
Hie summary section of the
disputed NIE, number 1 138, was
completed in mid-March. The
second volume of back-up data is
scheduled to be circulated very
soon, sources indicate.
In the past, there have been
other dissenting footnotes to
these reports. But officials
suggest they usually have been
over technical matters, such as
the debate over the range of thfe
new Soviet Backfire bomber and
whether it is aimed at U.S.
targets or other targets closer to
the Soviet Union in China.
In the current dispute, the
DIA and military chiefs are un
derstood to have "disassociated"
themselves from the summary
presented by Turner, contending
that it concentrates too much on
quantitative information unci
gives too little weight to Soviet
military doctrine, policy, overall
capability, momentum and fu
ture programs.
