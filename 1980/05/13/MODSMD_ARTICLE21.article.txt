## Shockley pseudo-theory insulting 
### 
The latest anti-black offensive
by Professor William Shockley.
as reported by The Stanford
Daily on May 1. raises a ques
tion. To what extent do
Shockley'v utterenees constitute
scholarship and to what extent
racial harassment? Would a
black scholar. howe\ er emeritus,
be giv en the kind of •"objective"
frame — "Shoekle\ discusses
views on racial differences" —
by the Daily, were he to propa
gate anti-white doctrines in a
pseudo-scientific guise?
Is a dogmatist less a dogmatist
because he is an intellectual, or
because his legitimation of white
racial supremacy is clothed 111
scientific jargon? Why is
Shockley accorded the frame of
"views" while redneck Ku Klux
klan members are relegated to
the lunatic fringe for coming to
the same conclusions?
Views or doctrine?
Views on racial differences are
one thing. Traditional American
doctrines on the racial inferiority
of blacks are quite another. The
uncontested propagation of
Shockley's doctrine makes the
learning environment here even
more hostile than it already is to
the cognitive creativity of black
students.
This is what makes it my busi
ness to reply to those black stu
dents who came to me some

weeks ago. \ isibly shaken by the
overt fascism of Shockley's
sperm bank doctrine; by his
anti-black thrust: by his con
tempt for basketball players in
particular, for athletic intelli
gence in general; by his gratuit
ous insults to black students and
faculty engaged in intellectual
activities. "What should we as
blacks at Stanford do about
Shockley?" the students asked.
It is not our task as black stu
dents and faculty to prove
Shockley wrong. Doctrines can
never really be proved since they
are believed rather than intellec
tually comprehended.
Shockley's pseudo-theories,
as Allan Chase establishes in his
book on Western scientific ra
cism. are part of a long tradition
of eugenic scholarship. The polit
ical function of this scholarship is
to "scientifically" legitimize the
processes of cultural selection
caused by the social mechanisms
of American society, by repre
senting the results of these pro
cesses as the results of natural
selection.
Like all mythic systems, the
Shockley hustle mediates a con
tradiction. How else can one"re
solve" the contradiction bet
ween the creed of political equal
ity for all citizens, and the con
crete existence of economic,
educational and cultural hierar
chies, except by arguing that the
latter are "natural" hierarchies,
predestined by nature herself?
Jefferson began the hustle
first, deploying mathematics to
explain why. with all men
created equal, only mixed-blood
blacks who had managed to in
terbreed enough to "clear the
issue of negro blood" could be
legally defined as "equal," as
citizens.
For Jefferson the solution lay
in using nature to cheat nature.
Breed in the white blood, breed
out the black! In two centuries,
"eugenic" science has progres

sed. Shockley calls on science in
stead. Sterilize out the black
poor, and sperm-bank in the
white middle class and black
middle class.
Immigration to sterilization
Shockley's call is not new.
even in modern times. At the
turn of the century this social
doctrine provided intellectual
legitimation for the demand of
Nordic nativists that immigra
tion barriers be put up against
"lesser Europeans" who might
endanger the superior Nordic
genetic endowment.
All that has changed, there
fore. are the categories. From
Nordic non-Nordic to white/
black. The nativist American
fetish of measurement of intelli
gence had its origin there. Why
then are the same discredited
doctrines being dusted off and
trotted out again now?
These doctrines satisfy a so
cially coded need among white
Americans, now that overtly ra
cial theories have been discre
dited by the black challenge of
the '60s. to reground the princi
ple of racial hierarchy — the
principle that affords them
superior and absolute identity —
on the natural metaphor ol the
"gene" now that the metaphors
of race and blood have been dis
credited.
Relative difference
Had Shockley been interested
in intellectual inquiry rather than
proof of the existence of genetic
hierarchy, he would have asked
himself, as John Ogbu did. why
the same relative difference in
professed genetic ability , as bet
ween whites and blacks in the
United States, are produced in
other modern societies?
Consider differences between
Brahmin and untouchables in
India. Israelis of European ori
gin and Israelis of Yemenite ori
gin in Israel. A comparative
study of Caribbean societies. 95
percent black, would have re
vealed the same relative differ
ence between middle-class and
lower-class blacks as between
whites and blacks in the United
States.

The relative differences
among groups in other societies
might have lead Shockley to sus
pect, as Ogbu suspected, the
central role that the school sys
tem itself plays in producing
what Pierre Bourdieu calls the
"varying levels of ignorance"
that make up the educational
hierarchies necessary to the
political and economic systems
in their present form.
As a Nobel Prize winner,
Shockley might well have been
interested in the fact that the re
cent black Nobel Prize winner in
economics, Sir Arthur Lewis,
and his four super-achiever
brothers were all the sons of
teacher parents. As such, they
were selected by the high
pressure learning environment
that surrounded them from
birth, an environment that accul
turated those of us who "suc
ceeded" to the intense but nar
rowly focused world of middle
class rationality . Ihe sina qua non
for "success" in the present edu
cational system.
This fact might well have been
the starting point for scholarly
inquiry into the interplay bet
ween "natural" and socio
cultural \ ariables. an inquiry that
could have been illuminating,
unbiased and creative. But to be
able to inquire, one must be able
to stand in the truth.
It is this standing in the truth
that all sectarian scholarship —
whose operational sleight of
hand is to isolate and make abso
lute those selected variables that
prove the"truth" of their doc
trine (such as genetic factors in
the case of Shockley) — must re
fuse.
To deal with the pseudo
theories of Shockley, then, as
blacks we must establish a "prior
adherence" to contemporary
scholarship such as that of Frantz
I'anon and Michel Foucault,
which has set out to deconstruct
all sectarian scholarship — all
doctrine that passes itself off as
scientific fact.

the same relative difference in
professed genetic ability , as bet
ween whites and blacks in the
United States, are produced in
other modern societies?
Consider differences between
Brahmin and untouchables in
India. Israelis of European ori
gin and Israelis of Yemenite ori
gin in Israel. A comparative
study of Caribbean societies. 95
percent black, would have re
vealed the same relative differ
ence between middle-class and
lower-class blacks as between
whites and blacks in the United
States.

The relative differences
among groups in other societies
might have lead Shockley to sus
pect, as Ogbu suspected, the
central role that the school sys
tem itself plays in producing
what Pierre Bourdieu calls the
"varying levels of ignorance"
that make up the educational
hierarchies necessary to the
political and economic systems
in their present form.
As a Nobel Prize winner,
Shockley might well have been
interested in the fact that the re
cent black Nobel Prize winner in
economics, Sir Arthur Lewis,
and his four super-achiever
brothers were all the sons of
teacher parents. As such, they
were selected by the high
pressure learning environment
that surrounded them from
birth, an environment that accul
turated those of us who "suc
ceeded" to the intense but nar
rowly focused world of middle
class rationality . Ihe sina qua non
for "success" in the present edu
cational system.
This fact might well have been
the starting point for scholarly
inquiry into the interplay bet
ween "natural" and socio
cultural \ ariables. an inquiry that
could have been illuminating,
unbiased and creative. But to be
able to inquire, one must be able
to stand in the truth.
It is this standing in the truth
that all sectarian scholarship —
whose operational sleight of
hand is to isolate and make abso
lute those selected variables that
prove the"truth" of their doc
trine (such as genetic factors in
the case of Shockley) — must re
fuse.
To deal with the pseudo
theories of Shockley, then, as
blacks we must establish a "prior
adherence" to contemporary
scholarship such as that of Frantz
I'anon and Michel Foucault,
which has set out to deconstruct
all sectarian scholarship — all
doctrine that passes itself off as
scientific fact.

The latest anti-black offensive
by Professor William Shockley.
as reported by The Stanford
Daily on May 1. raises a ques
tion. To what extent do
Shockley'v utterenees constitute
scholarship and to what extent
racial harassment? Would a
black scholar. howe\ er emeritus,
be giv en the kind of •"objective"
frame — "Shoekle\ discusses
views on racial differences" —
by the Daily, were he to propa
gate anti-white doctrines in a
pseudo-scientific guise?
Is a dogmatist less a dogmatist
because he is an intellectual, or
because his legitimation of white
racial supremacy is clothed 111
scientific jargon? Why is
Shockley accorded the frame of
"views" while redneck Ku Klux
klan members are relegated to
the lunatic fringe for coming to
the same conclusions?
Views or doctrine?
Views on racial differences are
one thing. Traditional American
doctrines on the racial inferiority
of blacks are quite another. The
uncontested propagation of
Shockley's doctrine makes the
learning environment here even
more hostile than it already is to
the cognitive creativity of black
students.
This is what makes it my busi
ness to reply to those black stu
dents who came to me some

weeks ago. \ isibly shaken by the
overt fascism of Shockley's
sperm bank doctrine; by his
anti-black thrust: by his con
tempt for basketball players in
particular, for athletic intelli
gence in general; by his gratuit
ous insults to black students and
faculty engaged in intellectual
activities. "What should we as
blacks at Stanford do about
Shockley?" the students asked.
It is not our task as black stu
dents and faculty to prove
Shockley wrong. Doctrines can
never really be proved since they
are believed rather than intellec
tually comprehended.
Shockley's pseudo-theories,
as Allan Chase establishes in his
book on Western scientific ra
cism. are part of a long tradition
of eugenic scholarship. The polit
ical function of this scholarship is
to "scientifically" legitimize the
processes of cultural selection
caused by the social mechanisms
of American society, by repre
senting the results of these pro
cesses as the results of natural
selection.
Like all mythic systems, the
Shockley hustle mediates a con
tradiction. How else can one"re
solve" the contradiction bet
ween the creed of political equal
ity for all citizens, and the con
crete existence of economic,
educational and cultural hierar
chies, except by arguing that the
latter are "natural" hierarchies,
predestined by nature herself?
Jefferson began the hustle
first, deploying mathematics to
explain why. with all men
created equal, only mixed-blood
blacks who had managed to in
terbreed enough to "clear the
issue of negro blood" could be
legally defined as "equal," as
citizens.
For Jefferson the solution lay
in using nature to cheat nature.
Breed in the white blood, breed
out the black! In two centuries,
"eugenic" science has progres

sed. Shockley calls on science in
stead. Sterilize out the black
poor, and sperm-bank in the
white middle class and black
middle class.
Immigration to sterilization
Shockley's call is not new.
even in modern times. At the
turn of the century this social
doctrine provided intellectual
legitimation for the demand of
Nordic nativists that immigra
tion barriers be put up against
"lesser Europeans" who might
endanger the superior Nordic
genetic endowment.
All that has changed, there
fore. are the categories. From
Nordic non-Nordic to white/
black. The nativist American
fetish of measurement of intelli
gence had its origin there. Why
then are the same discredited
doctrines being dusted off and
trotted out again now?
These doctrines satisfy a so
cially coded need among white
Americans, now that overtly ra
cial theories have been discre
dited by the black challenge of
the '60s. to reground the princi
ple of racial hierarchy — the
principle that affords them
superior and absolute identity —
on the natural metaphor ol the
"gene" now that the metaphors
of race and blood have been dis
credited.
