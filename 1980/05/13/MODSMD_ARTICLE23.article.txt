# End OPEC strangle hold
## 
### 
Last week in Saudi Arabia, the 13 OPEC oil
ministers met to discuss two familiar topics: crude
oil pricing and production.
However, these were only the surface issues.
C hances are that the other items were very much
on the delegates' minds, namely, the continuing
dependence of the major consuming countries on
petroleum and the growing political instability ot
the Persian Gulf region.
As citizens of the most profligate energy con
suming country in the world, we are gravely in
volved in the latter issues. Indeed, both our
economy and our security are increasingly at stake.
I list, let's address the issue of dependence.
Se\ en years after the 1 973 oil crisis, the developed
nations (United States. Western Europe and Ja
pan) continue to grant OPEC a strangle hold on
their economics. Despite our handwringing and
publicly stated objectives, the United States cur
rently buys nearly 50 percent of its oil overseas,
with half of these imports originating in the Persian
Gulf. Both figures are much higher than in 1973.
Western Europe and Japan are even more de
pendent. relying on the Persian Gulf region for a
massive 50 percent and SO percent of their oil.
respectively- Furthermore, all indications are that
given present policies and prices, this dependency
will not change much during the 1980s.
These high levels of dependence place the de
veloped countries in a precarious economic posi
tion. The Japanese, for example, consume only 38
percent of the energy per capita that Americans do,
and use 40 percent less energy per unit of GNP, but
their dependence remains overwhelming because
of a near absence of domestic resources.
Possessing only 2/10,000 of the world's natural
gas reserves, 9/100,000 of its oil. and 2/1000 of its
coal, Japan relies on foreign sources for over 99
percent of its petroleum needs. Within the last few
weeks. Japan had to scramble to replace 10 percent
of its imports when it refused to pay the new price
of $35 a barrel demanded by Iran.
Stanford's International Energy Program re
cently estimated that a nine million barrel per day
cutback in Persian Gulf exports (equivalent to the
loss of Saudi Arabian production) for one year
would decrease U.S. GNP by 6.6 percent. Western
Europe's by 8.8 percent and Japan's by 9.5 percent
at a minimum, given current consumption patterns.
For the United States alone, that amounts to over
$160 billion in 1980 dollars.
And such a cutoff is much more than a remote
possibility. Since two-thirds of the world's oil ex
ports flow through the narrow Straits of Hormuz, a
major cutoff could easily be engineered by all or
part of OPEC, masterminded by the Soviets or
induced by terrorists. The politics of the region are
such that a failure in the Palestinian autonomy
negotiations might also result in a tightening of the

oil tap.
Dependence leads to instability, the second
sub-surface issue. In order to pay tor over $90
billion in oil imports in I 979, the United States had
to export billions of dollars worth ot products, a
hefty chunk consisting of military hardware. Many
of these weapons went to the volatile Middle East,
further heighteningarmament levels in this already
volatile region.
In the past, U.S. foreign policy may even have
encouraged the use of arms sales, to pay for oil. On
May 4, the television show 60 Minutes strongly
intimated that former Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger privately agreed with the shah of Iran
that the United States would accept higher pet
roleum prices if Iran agreed to use the revenues
largely to purchase American weapons.
Do we continue to trade peace for petroleum?
â–¡lis terrible question would not even be relevant

were it not tor our staggering dependence on oil.
It's past the time when we should get serious
about reducing our dependence to a manageable
level, for the sake of our economy and our security.
We should not have to cower at OPECs every
utterance.
What can we do? Plenty. First, the United States
should eliminate all domestic controls on energy
prices, and should quickly fill the strategic pet
roleum reserve.
Second, the members of the International
Energy Agency should rapidly agree on an alloca
tion and pricing scheme to follow in the event of a
cutoff. With proper planning, about three million
barrels per day would be available in the United
States in the first year of a crisis, from a program of
depleting private stocks, using natural gas now in
storage, enlarging coal and nuclear electricity out
put, and increasing oil and gas production.
And let's not forget our individual responsibility
to curtail automobile use, install conservation
equipment, turn thermostats down in the winter
and up in the summer, and so forth. These actions
cost a lot less than $150 billion, and what is even
more critical, they'll help to preserve peace.
