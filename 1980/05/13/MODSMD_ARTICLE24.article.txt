## Frat criticism isn't 'gospel' 
### 
This is a response to the column "Greek system
premise morally inadmissible" by Gelpi,
Pohlemus, Rebholz, Ruotolo and Stone (Daily,
May 9). I question their reasoning and research.
The authors state that the Greek system rests on
"organizational premises that should be morally
inadmissible in a university." They say that Yale
and Harvard recognized this some decades ago,
implying that Yale and Harvard do not allow such
societies to exist. This is a blatant falsehood.
Yale, at least, has an active DKE chapter and the
highly selective and secretive Skull and Bones Soc
iety. I suspect that other fraternal societies exist at
Yale. The existence of one such society is sufficient
to cast doubt on the research behind the article. I
give Gelpi et al. the homework assignment of de
termining the precise identities of the other frater
nal organizations of the campus.
The authors state that "The evil of fraternities
and sororities lies in the rush system — in the
power of a house to ding."
Let's consider what faces a fraternity under pre
sent housing system rules if they do not "ding."
When a freshman or sophomore joins a fraternity,
he is required to sign a release form relinquishing
his claim to further University housing. The frater
nity. not the University, is now responsible for the
one or two remaining years of guaranteed housing.
Due to the limited number of rooms in each
fraternity house, if the fraternity does not ding or.
more properly, restrict membership, then they will
not be able to meet their obligation to guarantee
new members the equivalent housing oppor
tunities that they would have had under the Uni
versity housing program.
The authors state that "The University ought to
stand as a model of what a world might be . . . and
one feature of the world that ought to be is a world
in which we rub shoulders, and enjoy rubbing
shoulders, with all sorts and conditions of men and
women." Setting aside the questionable nature of

this normative judgment, Gc\p\ etal. have failed to
notice that Stanford has just such a mandatory
elbow rubbing program that they seem to find so
appealing. Every freshman, whether he hails from
Palo Alto (and could feasibly live at home) or from
New York, must live in a University dormitory.
The University takes great care in makingsure that
the population of each dorm represents a varied
social, economic and racial background.
I. for one. had my till of forced elbow rubbing
duringfreshman year. It is hot that I object to living
wi th people from any particular racial, economic or
social group; rather. I object to being scientifically
assigned to live with a bunch of obnoxious, incon
siderate or dull people on the grounds that it is for
my own good and "ought to be." Let me pick my
own group of obnoxious, inconsiderate and dull
people to live with.
And, if perchance I find the people in my frater
nity easier to get along with and better company, so
much the better for me. It's not surprising that such
a situation might exist, since I found the members
of the fraternities I rushed congenial and likeable
and those fraternities that gave me bids found the
same qualities in me.
I don't know what base fraternal selection pro
cedure these professors are familiar with. I hope
they had some first-hand experience with frater
nity selection before they made a blanket condem
nation of it. If they had been familiar with the
selection procedure at the Stanford chapter of
DKE (and other Stanford fraternities), I doubt
their judgment would have been so harsh.
I fear, however, that their criticism of the frater
nity system stems not from knowledge of selection
procedures but rather, from the belief that they are
particularly well-equipped to decide who I should
and should not be able to live with. Those who
would entertain such beliefs are suffering from ex
tremely advanced fantasies.

The authors state that "The University ought to
stand as a model of what a world might be . . . and
one feature of the world that ought to be is a world
in which we rub shoulders, and enjoy rubbing
shoulders, with all sorts and conditions of men and
women." Setting aside the questionable nature of

this normative judgment, Gc\p\ etal. have failed to
notice that Stanford has just such a mandatory
elbow rubbing program that they seem to find so
appealing. Every freshman, whether he hails from
Palo Alto (and could feasibly live at home) or from
New York, must live in a University dormitory.
The University takes great care in makingsure that
the population of each dorm represents a varied
social, economic and racial background.
I. for one. had my till of forced elbow rubbing
duringfreshman year. It is hot that I object to living
wi th people from any particular racial, economic or
social group; rather. I object to being scientifically
assigned to live with a bunch of obnoxious, incon
siderate or dull people on the grounds that it is for
my own good and "ought to be." Let me pick my
own group of obnoxious, inconsiderate and dull
people to live with.
And, if perchance I find the people in my frater
nity easier to get along with and better company, so
much the better for me. It's not surprising that such
a situation might exist, since I found the members
of the fraternities I rushed congenial and likeable
and those fraternities that gave me bids found the
same qualities in me.
I don't know what base fraternal selection pro
cedure these professors are familiar with. I hope
they had some first-hand experience with frater
nity selection before they made a blanket condem
nation of it. If they had been familiar with the
selection procedure at the Stanford chapter of
DKE (and other Stanford fraternities), I doubt
their judgment would have been so harsh.
I fear, however, that their criticism of the frater
nity system stems not from knowledge of selection
procedures but rather, from the belief that they are
particularly well-equipped to decide who I should
and should not be able to live with. Those who
would entertain such beliefs are suffering from ex
tremely advanced fantasies.
