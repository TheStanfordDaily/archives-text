Economics of oil
In reading the summary of
Robert Kennedy, Jr.'s speech
(Daily, May 8), I found the de
scription of his brother Joe's ac
complishment very intriguing, it
seems that Joe sells home heat
ing oil on the streets of Boston
for 47 cents a gallon and makes a
profit. Robert suggested that
since the oil companies claim
they cannot make it for 99 cents
a gallon, they should get out of
the business.
An investigation of the
economics of the situation reve
als some interesting facts. A bar
rel of Saudi Arabian crude costs
$26. which is one of the less ex
pensive when compared with
Iran's $35 a barrel oil (Wall
Street Journal. May 7, 1980).
A barrel holds 42 U.S. gallons
of oil. which reduces to 62 cents a
gallon for Saudi Arabian light
crude. In addition to this ex
pense, the oil companies must
transport, refine, store and dis
tribute the petroleum. To con
tinue to be successful they must
invest in research and develop
ment and oil exploration. Fi

nally, they must pay their inves
tors a fair return on the dollar or
else these funds will be put
elsewhere.
It is clear that the oil com
panies are charging a fair price at
99 cents a gallon for oil. As for
brother Joe. I would advise him
to keep his source of heating oil a
sccret, because he is gettingquite
a deal. Unfortunately, the rest of
the oil suppliers do not have ac
cess to this supply and must deal
with the real world situation.

The column about morality ot
the Greek system {Daily, May 9)
brought out a point that deserves
further consideration. The ac
cusation was made that the
Greek system perpetrates ideas
of elitism and isolationism.
My personal experiences have
led me to think otherwise. By liv
ing in a fraternity, I have been
forced to communicate and par
ticipate with people of different

races, classes and income groups.
Close cooperation has been es
sential to accomplish many pro
jects.
Compared to dormitory life,
the fraternity is more effective in
encouraging members to share
ideas and work together. Dor
mitories offer the easy alterna
tive of retreating into a secluded,
intellectual existence that is close
to the "quarantine" described in
the column.
In retrospect on four years at
Stanford, one of the most impor
tant influences not to become
narrow-minded and isolated has
come from living in a fraternity.

I regretfully disagree with my
friends in the English Depart
ment about fraternities. It is not
accurate to say that socializing
with all sorts characterizes the
outside world. Out there, people
arc just as cruelly discriminatory
as in here, when they get the

chance. That is indeed a part of
life, and one we can live with.
As something between a nerd
and a wimp myself, I learned that
truism as an undergraduate at
the University of Virginia, where
there was a sharp division bet
ween the "white shoe" fraternity
snobs and the humble scholarly
sorts. We got a lot out of that, in
our way.
Some young people (and old)
need reassuring in-groups just as
some children need security

blankets or Santa Claus.
Despite the shallow wave of
tine-sided intellectual emphasis
on pluralism, the abiding fact is
that the plural and the unitary,
existence and essence, are
among the great polar opposites
of reality, and there is constant
dialectical play between them.
We ought to be seeking a de
cent, livable balance in these
terms, not the doctrinaire excess
that brings on wild reaction.

the business.
An investigation of the
economics of the situation reve
als some interesting facts. A bar
rel of Saudi Arabian crude costs
$26. which is one of the less ex
pensive when compared with
Iran's $35 a barrel oil (Wall
Street Journal. May 7, 1980).
A barrel holds 42 U.S. gallons
of oil. which reduces to 62 cents a
gallon for Saudi Arabian light
crude. In addition to this ex
pense, the oil companies must
transport, refine, store and dis
tribute the petroleum. To con
tinue to be successful they must
invest in research and develop
ment and oil exploration. Fi

nally, they must pay their inves
tors a fair return on the dollar or
else these funds will be put
elsewhere.
It is clear that the oil com
panies are charging a fair price at
99 cents a gallon for oil. As for
brother Joe. I would advise him
to keep his source of heating oil a
sccret, because he is gettingquite
a deal. Unfortunately, the rest of
the oil suppliers do not have ac
cess to this supply and must deal
with the real world situation.

Fraternities not elite
The column about morality ot
the Greek system {Daily, May 9)
brought out a point that deserves
further consideration. The ac
cusation was made that the
Greek system perpetrates ideas
of elitism and isolationism.
My personal experiences have
led me to think otherwise. By liv
ing in a fraternity, I have been
forced to communicate and par
ticipate with people of different

races, classes and income groups.
Close cooperation has been es
sential to accomplish many pro
jects.
Compared to dormitory life,
the fraternity is more effective in
encouraging members to share
ideas and work together. Dor
mitories offer the easy alterna
tive of retreating into a secluded,
intellectual existence that is close
to the "quarantine" described in
the column.
In retrospect on four years at
Stanford, one of the most impor
tant influences not to become
narrow-minded and isolated has
come from living in a fraternity.

In-groups needed
I regretfully disagree with my
friends in the English Depart
ment about fraternities. It is not
accurate to say that socializing
with all sorts characterizes the
outside world. Out there, people
arc just as cruelly discriminatory
as in here, when they get the

chance. That is indeed a part of
life, and one we can live with.
As something between a nerd
and a wimp myself, I learned that
truism as an undergraduate at
the University of Virginia, where
there was a sharp division bet
ween the "white shoe" fraternity
snobs and the humble scholarly
sorts. We got a lot out of that, in
our way.
Some young people (and old)
need reassuring in-groups just as
some children need security

blankets or Santa Claus.
Despite the shallow wave of
tine-sided intellectual emphasis
on pluralism, the abiding fact is
that the plural and the unitary,
existence and essence, are
among the great polar opposites
of reality, and there is constant
dialectical play between them.
We ought to be seeking a de
cent, livable balance in these
terms, not the doctrinaire excess
that brings on wild reaction.
