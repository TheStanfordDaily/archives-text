## Director John L'Heureux The
						way things work 
### 
The question is how and the answers are
many and none too simple. How do you build a
creative-writing program which is selective in
students and focus, but which escapes elitism
and the ivory-tower syndrome? How do you
emphasize artistic growth, while — life being
what it is — you develop the skills necessary to
publish and to sell?
It's a juggling game which requires infinite
patience, unconventional approaches to writing
instruction, and a "tight, carefully focused" or
ganization, according to John L'Heureux, direc
tor of the Stanford Writing Center.
"Wallace Stegner and Dick Scowcroft (the
first two directors) built this program; I am try
ing to continue and, if possible, extend their
work," L'Heureux said in a recent interview.
"We have no large-scale publishing ambitions
here. We take the best students we can get and
we help them become the best writers they can
be."
At Stanford, he said, selectivity does not
necessarily mean sorting manuscripts for the
highest-scoring talents. "We try to find people
whom we can help and who can help the prog
ram. We have turned down very good writers
because we couldn't do anything for them. And
we have accepted people who, for instance,
have never published, but who show great po
tential."
The students who are helped most by the
program are those "who have worked for some
time on the craft of writing, who have the begin
nings of a voice and vision, and who needed only
a little prodding to discover where their richest
material lies and then the guidance and the en
couragement to help them present that material
in the form that suits it best.
"We don't believe, for a second, that we can
teach writing as an art, anymore than we could
teach music or painting," L'Heureux explained.
"But, we certainly can teach it as a craft, a
technique.
"Nobody can give you talent or vision, but if
you have talent or vision, we think we can help
you develop that talent, focus that vision."
The companionship of other writers also is
important. "The business is terribly lonely and
any kind of sustenance, especially personal
sustenance, is enriching," L'Heureux said.
Stanford provides "a vigilant audience" of
teachers and students, who offer both support
and criticism. "No matter how adept a writer is,
almost invariably, 10 peers sitting around a
table can help him or her find a way to be more
economical, more precise, more forceful."
L'Heureux explained the difference between
the undergraduate and graduate admission pro
cesses. "Strictly speaking, there is no under
graduate creative-writing major; there is a
' major in English, with a concentration in crea
tive writing. Anyone who maintains a B average
may concentrate in creative writing. We have
100 or so undergraduates in the program now."
The graduate program, however, is "small
and very, very selective," L'Heureux said.
Each year, Stanford accepts six Wallace Stegner
Fellows, three Edith Mirrielees Scholars, and
about 15 M.A. candidates.
"We receive more than 500 applications each
year. We accept 20 to 25. Not surprisingly, we
have a graduate-student population which
ranges from very good to simply astonishing."
The M.A. candidates may complete their de
grees in one or two years, taking the longer
option if they want more time to devote to writ
ing. - V.
Mirrielpes Scholars are given all-required tui
tion for two years, plus a $2500 stipend in the
first year and $3000 in the second; during the

latter they teach courses in expository prose.
"Not only do they get free tuition and a stipend,
hut they get experience in teaching, which
makes an enormous difference in today's job
market," L'Heureux said.
The Stegner Fellows receive $5000 for one
year and must register for the writing center's
advanced workshop (English 390 for fiction.
392 for poetry.)
Graduate candidates' manuscripts are read
and given a full written commentary by a pro
fessional reader, who rates the works "impossi
ble," "possible" and "good.""I read almost ev
erything, too," L'Heureux said. The "goods"
and "possibles" receive five complete readings
from the writing-center staff.
"Then we get together and fight it out for the
top contenders. It all sounds tedious, but it's
very, very thorough, and we've found no sim
pler way to select our candidates. The program
is this successful because so much care goes into
it."
The same thoroughness and concern are seen
in the classroom, L'Heureux added. "We are
doing something very important, and also very
different here. You must understand that
neither at the undergraduate or graduate level
are we attempting to turn people into writers.
Rather we are attempting to help people to
write better: to look at what they've written and
to discover what can be done to make it more
forceful, more convincing, more integral. " .
This emphasis on the development of self
expression and artistic strengths could create a
myopic attitude toward the writing craft. But,
L'Heureux said, the program keeps itself open,
both to the other ends of literature and to the
realities of the publishing world. "For one thing,
the creative writing 'major' actually is an Eng
lish major, which means that the students do
not write in a vacuum, divorced from the
mainstream of English and American litera
ture."
The writing-center faculty includes English
professors L'Heureux, Albert Guerard and
Nancy Packer in fiction; and Ken Fields, Diane
Middlebrook and N. Scott Momaday in poetry.
The program also hires five E.H. Jones Lec
turers, who teach four courses in writing each
year, for up to three years.
The program was endowed by E.H. Jones,
whose contributions helped to launch the Stan
ford Writing Center in 1946. Jones' help was
enlisted by Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Wal
lace Stegner, the first writing director.
The small size and narrow focus of Stanford's
program distinguish it from other major writing
centers, L'Heureux said. Iowa, Johns Hopkins
and San Francisco State "are large, indeed
enormous, with programs intent on purposes
somewhat different from ours."
"We're very selective, as I've said, and we're
blessed in getting the finest candidates going.
We take only people who, we think, have some
thing to learn here; but, invariably, they are
people of genuine talent who can make the most
of the opportunity to learn. They do."
