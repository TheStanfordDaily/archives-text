(Some notes on who's in the Stanford writ
ing program, why they're here, what they
think, and where they're going.)
Senior Kevin Hearle transferred to
Stanford specifically for the creative
writing program. Although he has worked
in both fiction and poetry, his current in
terest is primarily in the latter. He is a
candidate for next year's Stegner Fellow
ship in poetry.
The Stanford writing program has
taught Hearle "the tools of writing," he
says. "The program has a reputation of
being formalist, of emphasizing the tradi
tional forms.'" But he said that the in
structors realize that "although you
should know those forms, you don't al
ways have to practice them."
Hearle praises the quality of the current
faculty, but a need for additional
permanent writing positions. "Several
poets have left the faculty over the last
few years. They do need some more
people. Not only for the sake of reputa
tion, but to keep the students going. You
can't be getting by on guest instructors."
While Hearle says he "can't ever im
agine giving up writing," he anticipates an
uphill climb. "Someone told me that there
are three ways to survive as a poet: inherit
p fortune, marry rich or become an
academic."
Andrea Lerner has learned a
great deal about surviving as a poet, in
both the practical and the artistic senses.
She graduated with a B.A. from Reed
College then took two years away from
academics, because she thought "getting
into the outside world" would help her
writing. She worked as a cocktail waitress
and in book publishing, then went to

Japan to teach English.
"I thought I would take the traditional
literary exile and see more of the world.
At the time, I believed that going to
school was not the way to learn to write."
In Japan, however, Lerner encoun
tered problems with leading a double
language life.
Lerner decided to return to academics.
"I've met a lot of nice people in the
workshop and I'm writing more than 1
did."
Lerner said she will finish her M.A.
next year. "I'd like to find a 'sugar daddy'
and get mairied. Then. I can sit and
write."
Stegner fiction fellow Steven Winn
stresses the importance of knowing one's
own writing before plunging into the
workshop situation. Winn came to Stan
ford after graduating from the University
of Pennsylvania and working in a Seattle
writing program. He also worked for sev
eral years as a journalist and he wrote a
book about mass murderer Ted Bundy.
"The way to benefit the most from this
program is to listen to the others with one
ear and to develop your own ear," Winn
said.
Stephanie Vaughn, Jones Lecturer in
fiction, came to Stanford last year through
a Stegner fellowship. '.'lt's the only fellow
ship in the United States that gives writers
some financial support and allows them
contact with professional faculty and the
freedom to write," she said.
Vaughn praised the quality of both the
faculty and the students in the writing
program. "The criticism in classes is very
sophisticated," she said. "Students here
have wide reading and critical experi

ences."
Vaughn's one misgiving about the writ
ing program involves monetary con
straints. "It would be desirable if we could
limit class size to 15 or 12," she says. "But
economics require that a class not be
closed until we reach 20."
Like Hearle, junior Katherine Klees
pies sees herself as a poet who also enjoys
working in fiction. "I've been writing
poems and stories ever since I knew how
to write."
Kleespies emphasizes the intimacy of
the workshop format as a key to the writ
ing program's success. "I like the fact that
you get to know the instructors well.
"I'm aiming at versatility in my writ
ing," Kleespies said. In addition to poetry
and fiction, she has tried her hand at film
screenplays and song lyrics.
Sophomore Tom Engelman has de
signed an independent major in play writ
ing which includes extensive work in both
the English and drama departments.
"I'd like to see the creative writing de
partment initiate classes in playwriting,"
Engleman says. "I'll be working with
some of the best professors on campus,
but 1 won't have the support of fellow
writers and the feedback of a peer group."
Engelman credits his Stanford
fiction-writing classes with the opportun
ity to have his work analyzed by an "ex
perienced writer." But he adds that writ
ing classes are primarily limited to teach
ing craft. "At a certain point, it's what you
bring to that basic craft that is going to
distinguish you."
