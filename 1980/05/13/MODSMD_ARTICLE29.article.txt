# 'Rock justice' for all: unsung heroes onstage
## 
### 
"This punk, he plays junk."
And the punk in question is in
trouble. The plot begins to un
told. Picture it: one hapless rock
'n' roller falls asleep after an
especially hassle-ridden studio
recording session. He then
dreams that (Sound familiar?
Yes, Dorothy. Toto is a rock
band) he is on trial in a cour
troom. His crime is not having
released a hit. and he is about to
be prosecuted by the entire
music industry.
Now. we have the setting for
Rock Justice, a high-energy
rock-opera production which
features some of the Bay area's
finest unsigned, unsung talent.
But stay tuned. This rock plot
thickens. Our defendant and
hero, played by former Eddie
Money keyboard player. Jesse
Bradman. will face a stream of
crooning accusers singing the
shortcomings of his recording
career. (Yes, Dorothy, even
Elton John ran into a few harpies
strolling down the Yellow Brick
Road).
No sap
First, his band turns on him.
It doesn't want to sing sappy
songs anymore. The band says it
will do real rock 'n' roll from now
on. His drummer becomes the
judge. The bassist is the bailiff.
One guitarist will defend him —
barely. The other will prosecute.
The real indictment taking
place onstage is of the music in
dustry. The defendent finds him
self at the mercy of all sorts of
nameless, predatory stereotypi
cal music-world figures. These
include a prancing, dancing disco
DJ. who sings banalities with a
beat. Ric Devon, formerly lead
singer with Kid Courage, por
travs the slick, slimv record

executive who sings "Mogul
Rock." A greedy manager belts
out "Love That Boy" and says,
"1 only took 90 percent. That
isn't so much." There also is the
obligatory, silly blonde
girlfriend. Best of all is the drun
ken rock critic, played b\ Billy
Spooner of the Tubes, who is
wheeled onstage in a shopping
cart and issues verdicts like
"That Punk Makes Me Puke."
As an ambitious and colorful
stage show. Rock Justice has its
flaws. For the privileged few who
were able to catch one of the rare
live performances of the show
when it recently played at the
Keystone Palo Alto, it was glar
ingly apparent that good singers
do not always good good actors
make. Rock critic Spooner and
Ms. Justice, played by Dyan
Buckelew. do manage less than
wooden performances.
New form
Rock Justice well may help to
usher in an evolving art form
which is beginning to take hold in
the world of rock 'n' roll enter
tainment. Due to be released as
an LP on EMI this June, the
show score's catchy powerful
RcVB. New Wave-influenced
numbers are bound to make it an
instant success. Rock Justice will
simultaneously make its debut as
the first video-cassette rock op
era. The show will \ ie with Blon
die for credit as the first rock n"
roll video release.
Waiting out the break bet
ween shows at the Keystone. R.J.
Co-producer Bob Heyman and
Mike Yarney. the show's pro
secuting guitar and major musi
cal contributor, gladly answer
questions about the remarkable
evolution of the production. A

lavish project. Rock Justice was
more than three years in the
making. It all began, approp
riate enough, in the court
room.
Marty Balin met Bob
Heyman, who was law clerk for
the attorney representing the
Starship in its 15-year ongoing
lawsuit against the group's first
manager. Balin and Heyman,
educated at Harvard in educa
tional cinema techniques, found
that they shared a common in
terest in both film and rock 'n'
roll. Between them they eventu
ally came up with the plot for the
show and many of its songs. The
addition of Mike Yarney, for
merly of the Nuns, to the team,
introduced the musical energy
and polish needed to solidify the
show.
Rock Justice opened at the Old
Waldorf in San Francisco last
November where it was vid
eotaped over four nights.
Heyman expressed surprise that
the result was immediately
picked up by a major label, in
spite of its relatively unknown
cast. Nonetheless, the show will
launch a thriving local video
rock industry, Heyman said.
Asked about the competition
for first-place release with Blon
die, Mike Varney recalled a time
when the Nuns opened for Blon
die at the Keystone.
"There were six people in the
audience and they didn't even
like them (Blondie) that much."
Blondie may have come a long
way since then, but one thing is
certain. Rock Justice is coming
and e\en Deborah Harry is not
half as interesting as this produc
tion.

executive who sings "Mogul
Rock." A greedy manager belts
out "Love That Boy" and says,
"1 only took 90 percent. That
isn't so much." There also is the
obligatory, silly blonde
girlfriend. Best of all is the drun
ken rock critic, played b\ Billy
Spooner of the Tubes, who is
wheeled onstage in a shopping
cart and issues verdicts like
"That Punk Makes Me Puke."
As an ambitious and colorful
stage show. Rock Justice has its
flaws. For the privileged few who
were able to catch one of the rare
live performances of the show
when it recently played at the
Keystone Palo Alto, it was glar
ingly apparent that good singers
do not always good good actors
make. Rock critic Spooner and
Ms. Justice, played by Dyan
Buckelew. do manage less than
wooden performances.
New form
Rock Justice well may help to
usher in an evolving art form
which is beginning to take hold in
the world of rock 'n' roll enter
tainment. Due to be released as
an LP on EMI this June, the
show score's catchy powerful
RcVB. New Wave-influenced
numbers are bound to make it an
instant success. Rock Justice will
simultaneously make its debut as
the first video-cassette rock op
era. The show will \ ie with Blon
die for credit as the first rock n"
roll video release.
Waiting out the break bet
ween shows at the Keystone. R.J.
Co-producer Bob Heyman and
Mike Yarney. the show's pro
secuting guitar and major musi
cal contributor, gladly answer
questions about the remarkable
evolution of the production. A

lavish project. Rock Justice was
more than three years in the
making. It all began, approp
riate enough, in the court
room.
Marty Balin met Bob
Heyman, who was law clerk for
the attorney representing the
Starship in its 15-year ongoing
lawsuit against the group's first
manager. Balin and Heyman,
educated at Harvard in educa
tional cinema techniques, found
that they shared a common in
terest in both film and rock 'n'
roll. Between them they eventu
ally came up with the plot for the
show and many of its songs. The
addition of Mike Yarney, for
merly of the Nuns, to the team,
introduced the musical energy
and polish needed to solidify the
show.
Rock Justice opened at the Old
Waldorf in San Francisco last
November where it was vid
eotaped over four nights.
Heyman expressed surprise that
the result was immediately
picked up by a major label, in
spite of its relatively unknown
cast. Nonetheless, the show will
launch a thriving local video
rock industry, Heyman said.
Asked about the competition
for first-place release with Blon
die, Mike Varney recalled a time
when the Nuns opened for Blon
die at the Keystone.
"There were six people in the
audience and they didn't even
like them (Blondie) that much."
Blondie may have come a long
way since then, but one thing is
certain. Rock Justice is coming
and e\en Deborah Harry is not
half as interesting as this produc
tion.

A courtroom saga of rock V roll
"This punk, he plays junk."
And the punk in question is in
trouble. The plot begins to un
told. Picture it: one hapless rock
'n' roller falls asleep after an
especially hassle-ridden studio
recording session. He then
dreams that (Sound familiar?
Yes, Dorothy. Toto is a rock
band) he is on trial in a cour
troom. His crime is not having
released a hit. and he is about to
be prosecuted by the entire
music industry.
Now. we have the setting for
Rock Justice, a high-energy
rock-opera production which
features some of the Bay area's
finest unsigned, unsung talent.
But stay tuned. This rock plot
thickens. Our defendant and
hero, played by former Eddie
Money keyboard player. Jesse
Bradman. will face a stream of
crooning accusers singing the
shortcomings of his recording
career. (Yes, Dorothy, even
Elton John ran into a few harpies
strolling down the Yellow Brick
Road).
No sap
First, his band turns on him.
It doesn't want to sing sappy
songs anymore. The band says it
will do real rock 'n' roll from now
on. His drummer becomes the
judge. The bassist is the bailiff.
One guitarist will defend him —
barely. The other will prosecute.
The real indictment taking
place onstage is of the music in
dustry. The defendent finds him
self at the mercy of all sorts of
nameless, predatory stereotypi
cal music-world figures. These
include a prancing, dancing disco
DJ. who sings banalities with a
beat. Ric Devon, formerly lead
singer with Kid Courage, por
travs the slick, slimv record

executive who sings "Mogul
Rock." A greedy manager belts
out "Love That Boy" and says,
"1 only took 90 percent. That
isn't so much." There also is the
obligatory, silly blonde
girlfriend. Best of all is the drun
