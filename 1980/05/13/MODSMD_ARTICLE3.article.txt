# GOP rivals debate draft, national defense
## 
### Richard Hefter Staff Writer 
National defense was the key topic in
an on-campus debate Saturday bet
ween Congressman Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) and his Republican
primary opponent. Dr. Royce Cole.
"We want an army today that is
combat ready and competent to deter
military action." McCloskey said at the
informal gathering in the Chuck Taylor
Grove. The debate was sponsored by
the Stanford Young Republicans.
McCloskey, who recently voted
against draft registration in the House
of Representatives, restated his belief
in the inadequacy of the present volun
teer army.
Opposes program
Cole, a physician and member of the
Palo Alto School Board from 1969-78,
affirmed his support for the volunteer
military and said he is against McClos
key's youth service program.
Under .McCloskey's plan, 18-year
olds must choose between military and
civilian national service with college
benefits given for both.
Cole replied to McCloskey's plan,
stating that "if the volunteer army is
not working, it is because Congress has

failed to make it work. It can work and
it should work," he said.
"Reasonableyoung 18-year olds will
not volunteer," McC'loskey replied, cit
ing the predominance of poor, unedu
cated minorities in the armed services.
No need
McCloskey said studies have shown
that more than 50 percent of the youths
will choose the military under his na
tional service program, thus eliminat
ing any need for a draft.
Cole argued that the current prob
lem with the military is the economy.
The United States is "close to
economic dissolution. The dollar is in
great danger of sliding into oblivion,"
he said. If that happens, no military
system will be able to save our country,
he added.
Balanced budget
. Cole proposed balancing the budget
to strengthen the U.S. dollar,
strengthen America's position in the
world and increase the motivation of
American youth to volunteer in the
army.
"How can we expect IN-year olds to
volunteer for the army under this
economic dissolution?" he asked.
McCloskey argued that the U.S.

must have a balanced budget but also
keep up militarily with the Soviet Un
ion. something that cannot occur under
the present volunteer system.
He explained that the United States
and the Soviets each spend $ 147 billion
in national defense. However, the U.S.
spends 55 percent on the manpower for
its volunteer army (which includes the
costs of recruitment, pay, etc.) while
the Soviets only spend 23 percent, he
said.
Contentions! force
Tin_ United States needs a strong
conventional force to deter the Soviets
from military aggression throughout

the world, and the national youth ser
\ ice program can supply the necessary
manpower. McCloskey said.
He said that with the likelihood of a
future oil shortage in the Soviet Union,
"the temptation could be overwhelm
ing to the Soviets in the next decade" to
take over Persian Gulf oil militarily.
The president must be given the op
tion to meet the Soviets conventionally
and not have to resort to using nuclear
weapons, he added.
Cole said he agreed wit/i McCloskey,
but said that any conventional confron
tation with the Soviets would lead to
nuclear war.
