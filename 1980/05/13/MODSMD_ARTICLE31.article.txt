(The faculty took to the stage last week in a SPAR PS-sponsored show,
emceed by senior Peter Bensinger. A good time was had by all.)
He unraveled Ravel with elegant ease,
the Menuet rippled, the Rigaudon seethed.
The pianist divine, the audience pleased,
so playeth Ted Good, religious studies.
(What rhymes with Abernethy?)
The poli sci prof invited us all
to Eeyore's surprise birthday bash.
Piglet and Pooh, Kanga and Roo
on "hip-hooray" honey did get smashed.
Fats Waller in Eden
had the crowd ravin'.
Diane Freccero of dance
ain't misbehavin'.
J. Martin Evans' Welsh poem

Schramm might look troubled, but

gargled and bubbled.
Cole and Noel snickered and sneered,
vaudevillians shuffled, the audience cheered.
Drama's Lyons and Ryan showed such polish and malice,

Michelle Moran of
French/Italian
pulled all the stops:
Her organ was tops.

Fabrizio with beard?
