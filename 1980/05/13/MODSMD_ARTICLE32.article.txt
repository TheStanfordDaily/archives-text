# Will Ackerman outplays Consort
## 
### 
With a patriotic-looking,
Marin-groovy panel of a bald
eagle and blue whale gazing
down at the proceedings, the
Paul Winters Consort played at
Memorial Auditorium last week.
The set was full of good inten
tions. perhaps, and a lot of com
passion for the other species
which populate the earth, but
clearly something was missing in
the performance — something
found in the music of guitarist
Will Ackerman. who played be
fore them.
A few of the consort's fugue
like pieces, such as the one with
which the group opened, de
monstrated powerfully the way
the members of the consort can
work together; but the majority
of the songs (including the ones
patterned on animal sounds)
were spotty and lacked the cohe
siveness of the fugues.
Some songs seemed to be
crumbs thrown to members of
the consort, to let them showcase
themselves to the audience. At
other times, the consort ap
peared to space out into its own
little world on stage. This can
i work for groups if they can get
the audience to space out with
them, but that wasn't happening,
especially not with the audience
made up partially of middle
aged, middle-class liberal en
vironmentalists who came to
hear the harmonies the consort
wrote to a whale song — an excit
ing concept but one that was lost
somewhere between musicians
and audience.
The music would have been
good to study by or to play low in
the background while talking
with friends, but to sit there and
try to rivet my attention on it was
i a little too much. You need more
than a few good musical phrases
to justify a 15-minute guitar
and-drum solo; you need a
coherence that was lacking.
Perhaps the consort's talents
would be used best if the band
members were court musicians

for Jerry Brown.
This is not to say that they
were all bad — they looked very
tribal when they were playing to
gether and some of their percus
sion sets had the flavor of a few
friends sitting around a kitchen
with tape deck blaring, banging
away on the pots. But that was
not enough to carry an entire
90-minute set.
Guitarist Will Ackerman was
in another league altogether. It is
difficult to establish a rapport
with the audience, and difficult
to try to express complex emo
tions and feelings without words,
but he made those ties.
He, too. was once a Stanford
student. He was five units short
of graduation when he "ran out
of words" and decided he had
had it. So, he walked into his
father's office (Robert Acker
man, English professor) and told
his father he was dropping out.
His dad picked up the phone and
called President Richard Lyman
and tendered his own resigna
tion, turned to his son and said,
"Y'know, I'm sick of this place,
too."
Regardless of his illuminating
comments on the relative be
nefits and disadvantages of stay
ing at Stanford, his music carried
the weight of the meaning he
tried to give it. Especially if you
were already feeling bummed,
like 1 was that night, a depressing
song like "The Impending Death
of the Virgin Spirit" really
twisted the knife in your mood.
His other pieces, like the
acknowledged John Fahey imita
tion that was as bouncy as Fahey
himself has turned out, or "The
Processional to Romeo and
Juliet," that he said was either a
sad song or a happy song about
adolescent death, captured what
he was speaking of and conveyed
it to us with a far greater control
and precision and feeling than
the granola-hip abstractions of
the Paul Winters Consort.
