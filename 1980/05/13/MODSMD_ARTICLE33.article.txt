Death toll hits 31 in Fla. bridge collapse
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Salvage crews yesterday raised four
more crushed cars, including three with people trapped inside, and
Jound three other bodies near the sunken wreckage of the Sunshine
Skyway,bridge.
Two bodies floated up on a public beach and one was found
bobbing 011 the surface of Tampa Bay, bringing the total known
dead to 31.
So far. eight sunken vehicles ha\ e been found since a phosphate
freighter rammed the bridge Friday morning, knocking down a
towering 1400-foot span.
Hillsborough County Sheriffs officials said they still had 110 idea
how many victims remained trapped in the twisted metal and
chunks of concrete on the bottom of the bay.
Altogether, authorities now have raised or sighted a Greyhound
bus which carried 23 people, six cars and a pickup truck.
Meanwhile, a three-member Coast Guard Marine Board of In
quiry scheduled hearings for today with the National Transporta
tion Safety Board to investigate the accident.
A section of the bridge as high as a 15-story building dropped
into the bay when the Summit Venture, a 608-foot freighter, hit a
piling during a squall.
The Liberian-registered freighter, her bow still draped with bent
steel girders from the bridge, sat anchored offshore near Mullet
Key.
Cuban refugee arrested for *69 hijacking
KEY WEST. Fla. — A Cuban refugee among the thousands
streaming into Florida on the "Freedom Flotilla' was arrested
yesterday and charged with hijacking a L'.S. jetliner and diverting it
to Cuba with 82 people aboard 1 1 vears ago.
The FBI found Alfred Alejandro Hernandez. 37, among the
refugees and charged him with air piracy and conspiracy in connec
tion with the Sept. 24. 1969. hijacking of National Airlines Flight
4 11, a Boeing 727 diverted to Cuba while en route from Jackson
ville, Fla.. to Miami.
The FBI also arrested another refugee. Santiago Rodolfo Moises
Alfonso, and charged him with interstate transportation of stolen
property. The FBI alleges Moises rented a small airplane in Opa
Locka. Fla.. in 1970 and fled with it to Cuba.
Meanwhile, the flow of refugees reaching Key West slowed to a
trickle after 5353 checked in Sunday, about 1000 more than had
arrived on any previous day.
Officials said weather conditions in the 90-mile stretch of the
Straits of Florida between the Cuban port of Mariel and Key West
were relatively calm and they didn't know what caused the slow
down.
"Anything I could tell you would be speculation and I don't want
to get into that." said William Traugh of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
Refugee processing also continued at Eglin Air Force Base in
North Florida a/id Fort Chaffee. Ark., and the White House an
nounced plans to open new centers in Maryland and Pennsvlv ania.
Carter, Reagan favored in primaries
Maryland and Nebraska vote today in presidential primaries
virtually ignored by 4he front-runners and.v ery likely , much of the
electorate. Even so. President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan
were assured of edging closer to cinching their party nominations.
The president and the former California governor were prohibi
tive favorites in the Nebraska contest, where 24 Democratic and 25
.Republican delegates were at stake. An Omaha World-Herald poll
published Sunday showed Reagan with a 7-to-1 edge over George
Bush, indicating Reagan could sweep the GOP slate.
Carter, meanwhile, was rated 46 percent to Sen. Edward Ken
nedy's 19. though the Massachusetts senator did put in a
weekend appearance. The president's only campaigner was Vice
President Walter Mondale's wife. Joan.
Kennedy and Bush tried harder in Marvland. where Carter and

Reagan were soundly defeated in the 1970 campaign. But though
neither front-runner has appeared in the state this year, each was
favored in fights for 59 Democratic and 30 GOP delegates.
Going into today voting. Carter had 1319 of the 1666 delegates
needed to win nomination, with Kennedy trailing at 734. Reagan
had 7 7S of the 998 Republican delegates needed, while Bush had
171.
Muskie to urge allies to keep sanctions
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Edmund Muskie's first
overseas assignment, beginning today, is to urge the West Euro
pean allies to stand firm on sanctions against Iran.
Some of the Europeans are considering exemptions to the deci
sion taken by the Common Market last month to cut off all exports
to Iran except food and medicine by next Saturday.
Mnskie. meeting with foreign and defense ministers in Brussels,
hopes to persuade them to hold to the pledge even though Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's strategy of diplomaticand economic strictures
has not gained release of the American hostages held in Tehrarf
since Nov. 4.
It the Europeans water down their sanctions, Italy could com
plete S3 billion worth of construction contracts on which nearly
2000 Italians are working in Iran, and Britain could continue
exporting Chrysler U.K. automobile kits for assembly in Iran.
Muskie spent the weekend discussing his strategy with top aides
and also preparing for talks in Vienna qn Friday with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. It is the first Ivigh-level U.S.-
Soviet meeting since the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in late
December, sending U.S.-Soviet relations skidding.
England to require visas for Iranians
LONDON — The British government announced yesterday that
all Iranians must in the future obtain visas to enter the United
Kingdom — as part of the sanctions put into effect to get the
American hostages in Tehran released.
Since 1973. Iranians and Britons have not needed entry visas to
travel to each other's countries.
While the action w as taken as part of a Common Market nations'
response to President Jimmy Carter's appeal for stiffer sanctions
against Iran, it will also enable British immigration officers to keep
a tighter check on incoming Iranians.
At the same time yesterday, the British Foreign Office an
nounced that four Libyan nationals were to be expelled in a move
designed to warn President Moammar Kadafi against encouraging
Libyan agents to kill expatriate dissidents.
Two Libyans were killed in London in recent weeks, as well as
three others in Rome and one in Bonn.
The Libyans in London are believed to have been slain on
instructions from the Libyan government in Tripoli.
Kadafi had announced that all Libyan expatriates must return to
their country by the middle of May or face "liquidation."
The gunmen who seized the Iranian Embassy here said they were
Arab Iranians, although it is now thought that they were actually
traveling on Iraqi passports.
Currently, there are about 30.000 Iranians in the London area.
12.000 of whom describe themselves on entry as students.
Sadat reorganizes Egypt's government
CAIRO. Egypt — President Anwar Sadat accepted the resigna
tions of all 31 Cabinet ministers yesterday in a reorganization move
expected to place greater emphasis on Egypt's domestic problems
of inflation, housing shortages and mounting religious strife. It was
not believed there would be a significant shift in foreign affairs.
Sadat asked Premier Mostafa Khalil to head a caretaker gov
ernment. but did not ask him to form a new government, and
observers saw this as an indication Sadat might take over the
premiership.
Khalil has been Egypt's chief negotiator in the stalled Palestinian
autonomy talks with Israel, which were suspended Thursday at

Sadat's request, and he was asked what effect the government
shakeup would have.
He said the question *'is premature. Everything will become
clear in Sadat's speech tomorrow."
Sadat is to address Parliament tomorrow. Hie Cairo press has
said his speech will be a major declaration on domestic policies.
Recently, Sadat has stressed that the government must act to
reduce soaring inflation, provide thousands of desperately needed
housing units, and remove tensions between Moslems, who form
about percent of the population, and Coptic Christians.
The Christians have complained of harassment and persecution,
blamed mainly on Moslem fundamentalists influenced to some
extent by Iran's revolutionary Islamic government.
Pope criticizes African political unrest
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — Pope John Paul 11, in his parting
message to Africa, said yesterday he was encouraged by the
spiritualism he has encountered on the African continent but he
deplored its post-independence record of political turbulence.
The pope also condemned the materialistic elite classes, and
rejected Marxism as a possible option for African development.
His last statement before returning to Rome repeated several
themes that the pontiff has made in the past 1 1 days in his six
nation African tour.
During the trip's course of at least 75 speeches and sermons, the
pope did not spell out to his consistently large audiences in central,
east and west Africa which earthly avenue was the best to follow for
present-day political and economic problems. The divergent politi
cal leadership in the countries he visited — Zaire, Congo, Kenya.
Ghana, Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast — would have probably
reacted very negatively to what could have been interpreted as
interference in their domestic politics.
He did manage to step into several sensitive areas here, at one
point admonishing the church's bishops in Africa to speak out on
human rights violations, which could lead to strained relations
between the church and African leaders. On another matter, the
role of African traditions and culture in the church's latin cere
monies. the pope's statements appeared contradictory.
Kitty Hawk completes trans-America trip
MANTANE, Quebec — The Kitty Hawk floated to earth yes
terday at the end of the first non-stop balloon flight across North
America, and a champagne-soaked Maxie Anderson declared the
four-day voyage was tougher than his celebrated trans-Atlantic
journey two years ago.
Anderson and his 23-year-old son. Kris, landed their 20-story
tall helium-filled balloon in a small clearing on Quebec's Gaspe
Peninsula at 7:25 a.m. at the end of a 3000-mile voyage over snowy
mountain peaks and broad plains that began in San Francisco last
Thursday.
Anderson acknowledged some rough moments during the flight,
describing how wayward winds pushed him 1 1 00 miles north of his
intended course to Kitt\ Hawk, N.C.. while the high altitude travel,
often at 26,000 feet, forced the balloonist to wear oxygen masks
throughout most of the flight.
Anderson said the trans-continental flight was far more difficult
than the ocean crossing, mainly because of high mountain peaks
and varying weather patterns.
Dow Jones down .60
NEW YORK — The stock market drifted lower yesterday in
quiet trading as major banks continued to slowly reduce their
prime lending rates and the government provided more evidence
that the economy is slowing.
The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks slipped .60 to
805.20, with declines outnumbering advances by a narrow margin
among New York Stock Exchange issues.
Volume on the NYSE was 28.22 million shares, compared to
30.28 million in the previous session.

Death toll hits 31 in Fla. bridge collapse
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Salvage crews yesterday raised four
more crushed cars, including three with people trapped inside, and
Jound three other bodies near the sunken wreckage of the Sunshine
Skyway,bridge.
Two bodies floated up on a public beach and one was found
bobbing 011 the surface of Tampa Bay, bringing the total known
dead to 31.
So far. eight sunken vehicles ha\ e been found since a phosphate
freighter rammed the bridge Friday morning, knocking down a
towering 1400-foot span.
Hillsborough County Sheriffs officials said they still had 110 idea
how many victims remained trapped in the twisted metal and
chunks of concrete on the bottom of the bay.
Altogether, authorities now have raised or sighted a Greyhound
bus which carried 23 people, six cars and a pickup truck.
Meanwhile, a three-member Coast Guard Marine Board of In
quiry scheduled hearings for today with the National Transporta
tion Safety Board to investigate the accident.
A section of the bridge as high as a 15-story building dropped
into the bay when the Summit Venture, a 608-foot freighter, hit a
piling during a squall.
The Liberian-registered freighter, her bow still draped with bent
steel girders from the bridge, sat anchored offshore near Mullet
Key.
Cuban refugee arrested for *69 hijacking
KEY WEST. Fla. — A Cuban refugee among the thousands
streaming into Florida on the "Freedom Flotilla' was arrested
yesterday and charged with hijacking a L'.S. jetliner and diverting it
to Cuba with 82 people aboard 1 1 vears ago.
The FBI found Alfred Alejandro Hernandez. 37, among the
refugees and charged him with air piracy and conspiracy in connec
tion with the Sept. 24. 1969. hijacking of National Airlines Flight
4 11, a Boeing 727 diverted to Cuba while en route from Jackson
ville, Fla.. to Miami.
The FBI also arrested another refugee. Santiago Rodolfo Moises
Alfonso, and charged him with interstate transportation of stolen
property. The FBI alleges Moises rented a small airplane in Opa
Locka. Fla.. in 1970 and fled with it to Cuba.
Meanwhile, the flow of refugees reaching Key West slowed to a
trickle after 5353 checked in Sunday, about 1000 more than had
arrived on any previous day.
Officials said weather conditions in the 90-mile stretch of the
Straits of Florida between the Cuban port of Mariel and Key West
were relatively calm and they didn't know what caused the slow
down.
"Anything I could tell you would be speculation and I don't want
to get into that." said William Traugh of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
Refugee processing also continued at Eglin Air Force Base in
North Florida a/id Fort Chaffee. Ark., and the White House an

Carter, Reagan favored in primaries
Maryland and Nebraska vote today in presidential primaries
virtually ignored by 4he front-runners and.v ery likely , much of the
electorate. Even so. President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan
were assured of edging closer to cinching their party nominations.
The president and the former California governor were prohibi
tive favorites in the Nebraska contest, where 24 Democratic and 25
.Republican delegates were at stake. An Omaha World-Herald poll
published Sunday showed Reagan with a 7-to-1 edge over George
Bush, indicating Reagan could sweep the GOP slate.
Carter, meanwhile, was rated 46 percent to Sen. Edward Ken
nedy's 19. though the Massachusetts senator did put in a
weekend appearance. The president's only campaigner was Vice
President Walter Mondale's wife. Joan.
Kennedy and Bush tried harder in Marvland. where Carter and

Reagan were soundly defeated in the 1970 campaign. But though
neither front-runner has appeared in the state this year, each was
favored in fights for 59 Democratic and 30 GOP delegates.
Going into today voting. Carter had 1319 of the 1666 delegates
needed to win nomination, with Kennedy trailing at 734. Reagan
had 7 7S of the 998 Republican delegates needed, while Bush had
171.
Muskie to urge allies to keep sanctions
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Edmund Muskie's first
overseas assignment, beginning today, is to urge the West Euro
pean allies to stand firm on sanctions against Iran.
Some of the Europeans are considering exemptions to the deci
sion taken by the Common Market last month to cut off all exports
to Iran except food and medicine by next Saturday.
Mnskie. meeting with foreign and defense ministers in Brussels,
hopes to persuade them to hold to the pledge even though Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's strategy of diplomaticand economic strictures
has not gained release of the American hostages held in Tehrarf
since Nov. 4.
It the Europeans water down their sanctions, Italy could com
plete S3 billion worth of construction contracts on which nearly
2000 Italians are working in Iran, and Britain could continue
exporting Chrysler U.K. automobile kits for assembly in Iran.
Muskie spent the weekend discussing his strategy with top aides
and also preparing for talks in Vienna qn Friday with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. It is the first Ivigh-level U.S.-
Soviet meeting since the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in late
December, sending U.S.-Soviet relations skidding.
England to require visas for Iranians
LONDON — The British government announced yesterday that
all Iranians must in the future obtain visas to enter the United
Kingdom — as part of the sanctions put into effect to get the
American hostages in Tehran released.
Since 1973. Iranians and Britons have not needed entry visas to
travel to each other's countries.
While the action w as taken as part of a Common Market nations'
response to President Jimmy Carter's appeal for stiffer sanctions
against Iran, it will also enable British immigration officers to keep
a tighter check on incoming Iranians.
At the same time yesterday, the British Foreign Office an
nounced that four Libyan nationals were to be expelled in a move
designed to warn President Moammar Kadafi against encouraging
Libyan agents to kill expatriate dissidents.
Two Libyans were killed in London in recent weeks, as well as
three others in Rome and one in Bonn.
The Libyans in London are believed to have been slain on
instructions from the Libyan government in Tripoli.
Kadafi had announced that all Libyan expatriates must return to
their country by the middle of May or face "liquidation."
The gunmen who seized the Iranian Embassy here said they were
Arab Iranians, although it is now thought that they were actually
traveling on Iraqi passports.
Currently, there are about 30.000 Iranians in the London area.
12.000 of whom describe themselves on entry as students.
Sadat reorganizes Egypt's government
CAIRO. Egypt — President Anwar Sadat accepted the resigna
tions of all 31 Cabinet ministers yesterday in a reorganization move
expected to place greater emphasis on Egypt's domestic problems
of inflation, housing shortages and mounting religious strife. It was
not believed there would be a significant shift in foreign affairs.
Sadat asked Premier Mostafa Khalil to head a caretaker gov
ernment. but did not ask him to form a new government, and
observers saw this as an indication Sadat might take over the
premiership.
Khalil has been Egypt's chief negotiator in the stalled Palestinian
autonomy talks with Israel, which were suspended Thursday at

Sadat's request, and he was asked what effect the government
shakeup would have.
He said the question *'is premature. Everything will become
clear in Sadat's speech tomorrow."
Sadat is to address Parliament tomorrow. Hie Cairo press has
said his speech will be a major declaration on domestic policies.
Recently, Sadat has stressed that the government must act to
reduce soaring inflation, provide thousands of desperately needed
housing units, and remove tensions between Moslems, who form
about percent of the population, and Coptic Christians.
The Christians have complained of harassment and persecution,
blamed mainly on Moslem fundamentalists influenced to some
extent by Iran's revolutionary Islamic government.
Pope criticizes African political unrest
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — Pope John Paul 11, in his parting
message to Africa, said yesterday he was encouraged by the
spiritualism he has encountered on the African continent but he
deplored its post-independence record of political turbulence.
The pope also condemned the materialistic elite classes, and
rejected Marxism as a possible option for African development.
His last statement before returning to Rome repeated several
themes that the pontiff has made in the past 1 1 days in his six
nation African tour.
During the trip's course of at least 75 speeches and sermons, the
pope did not spell out to his consistently large audiences in central,
east and west Africa which earthly avenue was the best to follow for
present-day political and economic problems. The divergent politi
cal leadership in the countries he visited — Zaire, Congo, Kenya.
Ghana, Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast — would have probably
reacted very negatively to what could have been interpreted as
interference in their domestic politics.
He did manage to step into several sensitive areas here, at one
point admonishing the church's bishops in Africa to speak out on
human rights violations, which could lead to strained relations
between the church and African leaders. On another matter, the
role of African traditions and culture in the church's latin cere
monies. the pope's statements appeared contradictory.
Kitty Hawk completes trans-America trip
MANTANE, Quebec — The Kitty Hawk floated to earth yes
terday at the end of the first non-stop balloon flight across North
America, and a champagne-soaked Maxie Anderson declared the
four-day voyage was tougher than his celebrated trans-Atlantic
journey two years ago.
Anderson and his 23-year-old son. Kris, landed their 20-story
tall helium-filled balloon in a small clearing on Quebec's Gaspe
Peninsula at 7:25 a.m. at the end of a 3000-mile voyage over snowy
mountain peaks and broad plains that began in San Francisco last
Thursday.
Anderson acknowledged some rough moments during the flight,
describing how wayward winds pushed him 1 1 00 miles north of his
intended course to Kitt\ Hawk, N.C.. while the high altitude travel,
often at 26,000 feet, forced the balloonist to wear oxygen masks
throughout most of the flight.
Anderson said the trans-continental flight was far more difficult
than the ocean crossing, mainly because of high mountain peaks
and varying weather patterns.

Anderson acknowledged some rough moments during the flight,
describing how wayward winds pushed him 1 1 00 miles north of his
intended course to Kitt\ Hawk, N.C.. while the high altitude travel,
often at 26,000 feet, forced the balloonist to wear oxygen masks
throughout most of the flight.
Anderson said the trans-continental flight was far more difficult
than the ocean crossing, mainly because of high mountain peaks
and varying weather patterns.

Death toll hits 31 in Fla. bridge collapse
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. — Salvage crews yesterday raised four
more crushed cars, including three with people trapped inside, and
Jound three other bodies near the sunken wreckage of the Sunshine
Skyway,bridge.
Two bodies floated up on a public beach and one was found
bobbing 011 the surface of Tampa Bay, bringing the total known
dead to 31.
So far. eight sunken vehicles ha\ e been found since a phosphate
freighter rammed the bridge Friday morning, knocking down a
towering 1400-foot span.
Hillsborough County Sheriffs officials said they still had 110 idea
how many victims remained trapped in the twisted metal and
chunks of concrete on the bottom of the bay.
Altogether, authorities now have raised or sighted a Greyhound
bus which carried 23 people, six cars and a pickup truck.
Meanwhile, a three-member Coast Guard Marine Board of In
quiry scheduled hearings for today with the National Transporta
tion Safety Board to investigate the accident.
A section of the bridge as high as a 15-story building dropped
into the bay when the Summit Venture, a 608-foot freighter, hit a
piling during a squall.
The Liberian-registered freighter, her bow still draped with bent
steel girders from the bridge, sat anchored offshore near Mullet
Key.
Cuban refugee arrested for *69 hijacking
KEY WEST. Fla. — A Cuban refugee among the thousands
streaming into Florida on the "Freedom Flotilla' was arrested
yesterday and charged with hijacking a L'.S. jetliner and diverting it
to Cuba with 82 people aboard 1 1 vears ago.
The FBI found Alfred Alejandro Hernandez. 37, among the
refugees and charged him with air piracy and conspiracy in connec
tion with the Sept. 24. 1969. hijacking of National Airlines Flight
4 11, a Boeing 727 diverted to Cuba while en route from Jackson
ville, Fla.. to Miami.
The FBI also arrested another refugee. Santiago Rodolfo Moises
Alfonso, and charged him with interstate transportation of stolen
property. The FBI alleges Moises rented a small airplane in Opa
Locka. Fla.. in 1970 and fled with it to Cuba.
Meanwhile, the flow of refugees reaching Key West slowed to a
trickle after 5353 checked in Sunday, about 1000 more than had
arrived on any previous day.
Officials said weather conditions in the 90-mile stretch of the
Straits of Florida between the Cuban port of Mariel and Key West
were relatively calm and they didn't know what caused the slow
down.
"Anything I could tell you would be speculation and I don't want
to get into that." said William Traugh of the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
Refugee processing also continued at Eglin Air Force Base in
North Florida a/id Fort Chaffee. Ark., and the White House an

Carter, Reagan favored in primaries
Maryland and Nebraska vote today in presidential primaries
virtually ignored by 4he front-runners and.v ery likely , much of the
electorate. Even so. President Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan
were assured of edging closer to cinching their party nominations.
The president and the former California governor were prohibi
tive favorites in the Nebraska contest, where 24 Democratic and 25
.Republican delegates were at stake. An Omaha World-Herald poll
published Sunday showed Reagan with a 7-to-1 edge over George
Bush, indicating Reagan could sweep the GOP slate.
Carter, meanwhile, was rated 46 percent to Sen. Edward Ken
nedy's 19. though the Massachusetts senator did put in a
weekend appearance. The president's only campaigner was Vice
President Walter Mondale's wife. Joan.
Kennedy and Bush tried harder in Marvland. where Carter and

Reagan were soundly defeated in the 1970 campaign. But though
neither front-runner has appeared in the state this year, each was
favored in fights for 59 Democratic and 30 GOP delegates.
Going into today voting. Carter had 1319 of the 1666 delegates
needed to win nomination, with Kennedy trailing at 734. Reagan
had 7 7S of the 998 Republican delegates needed, while Bush had
171.
Muskie to urge allies to keep sanctions
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Edmund Muskie's first
overseas assignment, beginning today, is to urge the West Euro
pean allies to stand firm on sanctions against Iran.
Some of the Europeans are considering exemptions to the deci
sion taken by the Common Market last month to cut off all exports
to Iran except food and medicine by next Saturday.
Mnskie. meeting with foreign and defense ministers in Brussels,
hopes to persuade them to hold to the pledge even though Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's strategy of diplomaticand economic strictures
has not gained release of the American hostages held in Tehrarf
since Nov. 4.
It the Europeans water down their sanctions, Italy could com
plete S3 billion worth of construction contracts on which nearly
2000 Italians are working in Iran, and Britain could continue
exporting Chrysler U.K. automobile kits for assembly in Iran.
Muskie spent the weekend discussing his strategy with top aides
and also preparing for talks in Vienna qn Friday with Soviet
Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko. It is the first Ivigh-level U.S.-
Soviet meeting since the Red Army occupied Afghanistan in late
December, sending U.S.-Soviet relations skidding.
England to require visas for Iranians
LONDON — The British government announced yesterday that
all Iranians must in the future obtain visas to enter the United
Kingdom — as part of the sanctions put into effect to get the
American hostages in Tehran released.
Since 1973. Iranians and Britons have not needed entry visas to
travel to each other's countries.
While the action w as taken as part of a Common Market nations'
response to President Jimmy Carter's appeal for stiffer sanctions
against Iran, it will also enable British immigration officers to keep
a tighter check on incoming Iranians.
At the same time yesterday, the British Foreign Office an
nounced that four Libyan nationals were to be expelled in a move
designed to warn President Moammar Kadafi against encouraging
Libyan agents to kill expatriate dissidents.
Two Libyans were killed in London in recent weeks, as well as
three others in Rome and one in Bonn.
The Libyans in London are believed to have been slain on
instructions from the Libyan government in Tripoli.
Kadafi had announced that all Libyan expatriates must return to
their country by the middle of May or face "liquidation."
The gunmen who seized the Iranian Embassy here said they were
Arab Iranians, although it is now thought that they were actually
traveling on Iraqi passports.
Currently, there are about 30.000 Iranians in the London area.
12.000 of whom describe themselves on entry as students.
Sadat reorganizes Egypt's government
CAIRO. Egypt — President Anwar Sadat accepted the resigna
tions of all 31 Cabinet ministers yesterday in a reorganization move
expected to place greater emphasis on Egypt's domestic problems
of inflation, housing shortages and mounting religious strife. It was
not believed there would be a significant shift in foreign affairs.
Sadat asked Premier Mostafa Khalil to head a caretaker gov
ernment. but did not ask him to form a new government, and
observers saw this as an indication Sadat might take over the
premiership.
Khalil has been Egypt's chief negotiator in the stalled Palestinian
autonomy talks with Israel, which were suspended Thursday at

Sadat's request, and he was asked what effect the government
shakeup would have.
He said the question *'is premature. Everything will become
clear in Sadat's speech tomorrow."
Sadat is to address Parliament tomorrow. Hie Cairo press has
said his speech will be a major declaration on domestic policies.
Recently, Sadat has stressed that the government must act to
reduce soaring inflation, provide thousands of desperately needed
housing units, and remove tensions between Moslems, who form
about percent of the population, and Coptic Christians.
The Christians have complained of harassment and persecution,
blamed mainly on Moslem fundamentalists influenced to some
extent by Iran's revolutionary Islamic government.
Pope criticizes African political unrest
ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast — Pope John Paul 11, in his parting
message to Africa, said yesterday he was encouraged by the
spiritualism he has encountered on the African continent but he
deplored its post-independence record of political turbulence.
The pope also condemned the materialistic elite classes, and
rejected Marxism as a possible option for African development.
His last statement before returning to Rome repeated several
themes that the pontiff has made in the past 1 1 days in his six
nation African tour.
During the trip's course of at least 75 speeches and sermons, the
pope did not spell out to his consistently large audiences in central,
east and west Africa which earthly avenue was the best to follow for
present-day political and economic problems. The divergent politi
cal leadership in the countries he visited — Zaire, Congo, Kenya.
Ghana, Upper Volta and the Ivory Coast — would have probably
reacted very negatively to what could have been interpreted as
interference in their domestic politics.
He did manage to step into several sensitive areas here, at one
point admonishing the church's bishops in Africa to speak out on
human rights violations, which could lead to strained relations
between the church and African leaders. On another matter, the
role of African traditions and culture in the church's latin cere
monies. the pope's statements appeared contradictory.
Kitty Hawk completes trans-America trip
MANTANE, Quebec — The Kitty Hawk floated to earth yes
terday at the end of the first non-stop balloon flight across North
America, and a champagne-soaked Maxie Anderson declared the
four-day voyage was tougher than his celebrated trans-Atlantic
journey two years ago.
Anderson and his 23-year-old son. Kris, landed their 20-story
tall helium-filled balloon in a small clearing on Quebec's Gaspe
Peninsula at 7:25 a.m. at the end of a 3000-mile voyage over snowy
mountain peaks and broad plains that began in San Francisco last
Thursday.
Anderson acknowledged some rough moments during the flight,

America, and a champagne-soaked Maxie Anderson declared the
four-day voyage was tougher than his celebrated trans-Atlantic
journey two years ago.
Anderson and his 23-year-old son. Kris, landed their 20-story
tall helium-filled balloon in a small clearing on Quebec's Gaspe
Peninsula at 7:25 a.m. at the end of a 3000-mile voyage over snowy
mountain peaks and broad plains that began in San Francisco last
Thursday.
Anderson acknowledged some rough moments during the flight,
describing how wayward winds pushed him 1 1 00 miles north of his
intended course to Kitt\ Hawk, N.C.. while the high altitude travel,
often at 26,000 feet, forced the balloonist to wear oxygen masks
throughout most of the flight.
Anderson said the trans-continental flight was far more difficult
than the ocean crossing, mainly because of high mountain peaks
and varying weather patterns.
