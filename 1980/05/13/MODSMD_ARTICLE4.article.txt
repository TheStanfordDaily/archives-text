# Students to spend $120,000 next year
## Senate approves ASSU budget 
### Dianne Cahoon News Editor 
Next year's $120,000 ASSU operat
ing budget, set by student financial
manager Bruce Bendix and the ASSU
Senate financial committee, was offi
cially approved by the senate at last
Wednesday's meeting.
The finance committee's involve
ment in the budget process was one
step taken this year toward reasserting
the senate's role in ASSU finances, ac
cording to finance committee chair
Chris Greene.
"To mv knowledge, this is the first
time the finance committee really got
together with the student financial
manager and laid out the budget,"he
said. "It's clear according to the ASSU
By-Laws that we had that right." Yet,

in the past, the financial manager had
routinely bypassed the committee and
presented the prepared budget to the
entire senate for approval, according to
Greene.
The ASSU budget includes the ad
ministrative costs of running the office,
such as salaries and supplies. The
ASSU partially funds itself and is addi
tionally funded by the University.
Next year's total budget encompas
ses about $120,000. up from
$1 15,351.76 last year. The ASSU
funded segment of that amount is esti
mated at $44,000, an increase of al
most $<NOOO over last year's
$36,334.62. The University portion
has not yet been finally determined.
The reason for the marked rise in the
ASSU share of the budget is that, for

the first time, the ASSU will assume
payment for its own audit, supplies,
telephone usage, and equipment ser
vice and rent next year. All salaries will
increase about 10 percent, but no other
notable changes in the budget were
made.
ASSU income accrues from project
overhead, long-term investment pay
out and short-term interest.
The four senate committees (fi
nance, rules, student affairs, committee
on committees) assumed larger func
tions this year in an effort to make the
senate and its meetings more effective.
Measures were first discussed in their
appropriate committees before presen
tation before the whole senate. In that
way, most debate occurred among
