# Students to spend $120,000 next year
## Senate approves ASSU budget 
### Dianne Cahoon News Editor 
Next year's $120,000 ASSU operat
ing budget, set by student financial
manager Bruce Bendix and the ASSU
Senate financial committee, was offi
cially approved by the senate at last
Wednesday's meeting.
The finance committee's involve
ment in the budget process was one
step taken this year toward reasserting
the senate's role in ASSU finances, ac
cording to finance committee chair
Chris Greene.
"To mv knowledge, this is the first
time the finance committee really got
together with the student financial
manager and laid out the budget,"he
said. "It's clear according to the ASSU
By-Laws that we had that right." Yet,

in the past, the financial manager had
routinely bypassed the committee and
presented the prepared budget to the
entire senate for approval, according to
Greene.
The ASSU budget includes the ad
ministrative costs of running the office,
such as salaries and supplies. The
ASSU partially funds itself and is addi
tionally funded by the University.
Next year's total budget encompas
ses about $120,000. up from
$1 15,351.76 last year. The ASSU
funded segment of that amount is esti
mated at $44,000, an increase of al
most $<NOOO over last year's
$36,334.62. The University portion
has not yet been finally determined.
The reason for the marked rise in the
ASSU share of the budget is that, for

the first time, the ASSU will assume
payment for its own audit, supplies,
telephone usage, and equipment ser
vice and rent next year. All salaries will
increase about 10 percent, but no other
notable changes in the budget were
made.
ASSU income accrues from project
overhead, long-term investment pay
out and short-term interest.
The four senate committees (fi
nance, rules, student affairs, committee
on committees) assumed larger func
tions this year in an effort to make the
senate and its meetings more effective.
Measures were first discussed in their
appropriate committees before presen
tation before the whole senate. In that
way, most debate occurred among
senators more familiar with the particu
lar issues, so that protracted senate
meetings could be avoided. The com
mittees also met in the same places at
the same time to allow for interaction
between the groups.
The finance committee, the only
committee with Constitutional obliga
tions, according to Greene, reassumed
responsibilities this year that had been
gradually abandoned over the years.
"The part of ASSU finances that had
been set out as the senate's in the By-
Laws had been neglected," Greene
said. "The student financial manager
then rightly assumed those duties," he
added.
Besides working on the budget, the
other major job of the committee was
to determine next year's ASSU prog
ram fee allocations. Fifty campus or
ganizations applied for funding, and 38
were granted either all or part of their
requests. The senate as a whole ap
proved all the committee program fee
recommendations.
Tighter guidelines
In allotting the program fee assess
ment, the committee interviewed each
group requesting funding and followed
a strict set of guidelines to fix the end
awards. The guidelines basically de
pend upon the structure and activities
of the organization, as well as other
available sources of funding and the
details of the group's budget. The prog
ram fee is meant to cover general
operating expense, not capital invest
ment.
The finance committee also put a
new rule into action this year. 11 refused
to consider the funding of an activity
pending with another committee until
the other committee reached its deci
sion. In the past, financial decisions had
sometimes pre-empted the considera
tions of other committees, according to
Greene.

$1 15,351.76 last year. The ASSU
funded segment of that amount is esti
mated at $44,000, an increase of al
most $<NOOO over last year's
$36,334.62. The University portion
has not yet been finally determined.
The reason for the marked rise in the
ASSU share of the budget is that, for

the first time, the ASSU will assume
payment for its own audit, supplies,
telephone usage, and equipment ser
vice and rent next year. All salaries will
increase about 10 percent, but no other
notable changes in the budget were
made.
ASSU income accrues from project
overhead, long-term investment pay
out and short-term interest.
The four senate committees (fi
nance, rules, student affairs, committee
on committees) assumed larger func
tions this year in an effort to make the
senate and its meetings more effective.
Measures were first discussed in their
appropriate committees before presen
tation before the whole senate. In that
way, most debate occurred among
senators more familiar with the particu
lar issues, so that protracted senate
meetings could be avoided. The com
mittees also met in the same places at
the same time to allow for interaction
between the groups.
The finance committee, the only
committee with Constitutional obliga
tions, according to Greene, reassumed
responsibilities this year that had been
gradually abandoned over the years.
"The part of ASSU finances that had
been set out as the senate's in the By-
Laws had been neglected," Greene
said. "The student financial manager
then rightly assumed those duties," he
added.
Besides working on the budget, the
other major job of the committee was
to determine next year's ASSU prog
ram fee allocations. Fifty campus or
ganizations applied for funding, and 38
were granted either all or part of their
requests. The senate as a whole ap
proved all the committee program fee
recommendations.
Tighter guidelines
In allotting the program fee assess
ment, the committee interviewed each
group requesting funding and followed
a strict set of guidelines to fix the end
awards. The guidelines basically de
pend upon the structure and activities
of the organization, as well as other
available sources of funding and the
details of the group's budget. The prog
ram fee is meant to cover general
operating expense, not capital invest
ment.
The finance committee also put a
new rule into action this year. 11 refused
to consider the funding of an activity
pending with another committee until
the other committee reached its deci
sion. In the past, financial decisions had
sometimes pre-empted the considera
tions of other committees, according to
Greene.
