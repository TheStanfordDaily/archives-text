Muskie-Gromyko meeting
As a first step toward normalizing U.S.-Soviet
relations, new Secretary of State Edmund
Muskie will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister
Andrei Gromyko in Vienna on Friday. But
neither party is expecting the increasingly cold
relations between the two countries to suddenly
warm up. See page 2.
Combating rising energy bills
Faced with increasing energy costs, the
University is looking for new ways to cut its
energy bill. In addition to decreasing energy
use, the University is also working with other
schools toward creating a new classification for
energy users that would lower utility rates. See
page 3.

The round table
Creative writing director John L'Heureux tells
the who, what and how; his students, writing
fellow and teachers offer the why â€” when it
comes to fiction and poetry at Stanford. See
page 5.
