# Hardliners leading in Iranian balloting
## 
### 
from the Daily wire services
Islamic fundamentalists increased
their lead yesterday in Iranian par
liamentary voting and apparently
handed Iranian President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr another defeat by blocking
his efforts to name a prime minister.
The hardliners' growing influence
could further complicate the U.S. hos
tage crisis.
Tehran Radio said 229 of 247 seats
in the Iranian parliament have been
filled and that the Islamic Republican
Party has won 113 of them, including
three decided yesterday. Victories by
Moslem fundamentalists running as in
dependents will give the IPR a working
majority in Parliament.
Iran's revolutionary leader. Ayatol
lah Ruhollah Khomeini, has said the
new Parliament, expected to convene
in the next few weeks, will decide the
fate of the 50 hostages held since last
Nov. 4. Many IPR members have ad
vocated spy trials for the Americans
unless deposed Shah Mohammed Reza
Pahlavi is returned to Iran to face trial.
Bani-Sadr is said to favor a quick end
to the hostage standoff so Iran can de
vote more attention to its internal prob
lems. But candidates he supported
finished far behind the IPR in the par
liamentary balloting, and the Iranian

president, elected overwhelmingly last
January, appears to be facing a harder
time than ever taking full control of his
country.
Observers saw the clergy-dominated
Revolutionary Council's failure to
name a prime minister during the
weekend as yet another setback for
Bani-Sadr. The council was reported to
have debated the appointment of a
prime minister for several hours Sun
day before turning the matter back to
Khomeini.
On Saturday, the Tehran newspaper
Bamdad said Bani-Sadr would appoint
a prime minister and Cabinet within a
week and that the new government's
first duty would be to try to resolve the
U.S.-Iran crisis.
But another newspaper, Ettelaat,
quoted Sadegh Tabatabai,a top official
in the prime minister's office, as saying
that because of "recent developments.
I don't think Mr. Bani-Sadr will ap
point a prime minister before the
commencement of Parliament."
The prime minister's office has been
vacant since Mehdi Bazargan resigned
after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy
and American hostages 191 days ago
yesterday.
Bani-Sadr's unstated purpose in
seeking to name a new government —
with the blessing of Iran's most power
ful figure. Khomeini — was to out
maneuver the clerical party, which is
virtually certain to be dominate in the
new Parliament and to exercise its pre
rogative of nominating a prime minis
ter of its own choosing.
Khomeini has entrusted settlement
of the more than six-month-old hos
tage crisis with the United States to the
270-seat Parliament, which is expected
to convene in early June and not begin
to tackle substantive problems until
several weeks later.
Increasingly over the past two days
signs have emerged of Bani-Sadr's ina
bility to announce the new prime minis
ter.
If these signs are confirmed, Bani-
Sadr's setback will count as another in a
seemingly unending series since he won
a landslide 76 percent vote in the Jan.
25 presidential selection.
One by one the major candidates for
prime minister have either declined to
accept the post for only two months —
a key condition laid down by the cleri
cal party — or demanded their own
conditions that were unacceptable to
Khomeini, Bani-Sadr or the clerical
party itself.
Even if a prime minister is now
named, analysts suggested that the cler
ical party has succeeded in paralyzing
any government that might be formed.

vacant since Mehdi Bazargan resigned
after the seizure of the U.S. Embassy
and American hostages 191 days ago
yesterday.
Bani-Sadr's unstated purpose in
seeking to name a new government —
with the blessing of Iran's most power
ful figure. Khomeini — was to out
maneuver the clerical party, which is
virtually certain to be dominate in the
new Parliament and to exercise its pre
rogative of nominating a prime minis
ter of its own choosing.
Khomeini has entrusted settlement
of the more than six-month-old hos
tage crisis with the United States to the
270-seat Parliament, which is expected
to convene in early June and not begin
to tackle substantive problems until
several weeks later.
Increasingly over the past two days
signs have emerged of Bani-Sadr's ina
bility to announce the new prime minis
ter.
If these signs are confirmed, Bani-
Sadr's setback will count as another in a
seemingly unending series since he won
a landslide 76 percent vote in the Jan.
25 presidential selection.
One by one the major candidates for
prime minister have either declined to
accept the post for only two months —
a key condition laid down by the cleri
cal party — or demanded their own
conditions that were unacceptable to
Khomeini, Bani-Sadr or the clerical
party itself.
Even if a prime minister is now
named, analysts suggested that the cler
ical party has succeeded in paralyzing
any government that might be formed.
