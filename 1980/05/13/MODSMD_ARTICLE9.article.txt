sec how they have dealt with the problems. The task force
will then report its findings to Provost Donald Kennedy.
Electrical Engineering Prof. Ronald Bracewell, who will
head the committee, expects that the group will have its first
meeting on May 23.
Topics to he considered by the committee include:
— The impact of raising mandatory retirement age for
faculty from 65 to 70;
— The possibility of replacing the present system of
lifetime tenure with a fixed-term tenure, in which faculty
would receive a 20- or 25-year contract followed either by a
renewal of the contract, or a guarantee of part-time
employment;
— The effects of raising the retirement age on the availa
bility of professorships for younger faculty;
— The adequacy of present retirement plans and pen
sions in the face of rampant inflation, and the current Uni
versity policy of contributing to a faculty member's retire
ment plan only until they reach 65. the normal retirement
age.
— The institution of periodic performance evaluations
for faculty members, and the means to administer such

evaluations.
— A re-examination of the current early-retirement
program.
'ITiese measures are being examined in consideration of
new regulations in both the federal and California state
governments which have raised the mandatory age for re
tirement from 65 to 70.
"People are simply living longer." commented
Bracewell. "For some people, 65 is just too early to retire.
It's unfair to dismiss people at 65 if they can still do the job.
"Being forced out of work can kill you." he said.
"Everyone my age can think of someone who retired and
then just faded away. The moral is: keep working.
"We are trying to work out the fairest possible solution to
the problems (of retirement for everyone involved),"
Bracewell added.
" Much of it comes down to a question of discrimination,"
said Jean Fetter, assistant to the president and ex-officio
member of the task force. "Are you discriminating on the
basis of age (by forcing faculty to retire at 65)? Are you
saying a faculty member at age 70 is less capable than one at
25?"
Although the task force is the newest, it is not the first
attempt by the University to examine the problems of re
tirement.
Another committee, headed by Prof. Gerald Lieber
mann, vice provost and dean of research, has been studying
these issues over the past two years. The report made by
that committee will provide much of the groundwork for the
new task force.
