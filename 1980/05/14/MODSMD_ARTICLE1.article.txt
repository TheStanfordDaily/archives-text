## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
President Jimmy Carter won the
Maryland and Nebraska presidential
primary elections last night, hut Sen.
Edward Kennedy vowed in defeat to
continue his campaign despite the to
wering odds against him.
Ronald Reagan captured the two
Republican primaries and said he was
confident, "most optimistic," that he
soon will clinch the GOP nomination.
In this latest installment ot the long
primary parade. Carter and Reagan
widened their runaway leads in
nominating votes.
George Bush would need a virtual
sweep ot all the remaining GOP dele
gates to reach nominating strength.
Carter led for 46 delegates, which
would bring his national total to 1365.
He needs 1666 tor renomination. Ken
nedy was ahead for 36 of yesterday's
delegates, which would put his overall
count at 770.
Kennedy, in Albuquerque, N.M.,
said he had "expected to do better,"
but added, "there really isn't that much
of a difference" in their delegate counts
in yesterday's primaries.
But there is a big difference between
their situations, since Carter can clinch
the nomination so long as he gets about
26 percent of the remaining Democra
tic delegates.
Kennedy said he would continue the
campaign, looking for a comeback in
the big final primaries, because "I be
lieve a political party must stand for
something."
Reagan's lopsided Nebraska victory
over Bush was in a preferential vote
that did not bind delegates. They were
elected separately, and Republicans
pledged to Reagan led for 24 national
convention seats and one Bush suppor
ter was ahead.
Reagan led for another 15 delegates
in Maryland. That would give him a
total of 817 of the 998 lie needs to gain
nomination. Bush was ahead for 15 de
legates, for a prospective total of 187.
That meant he'd have to win 96 percent
ot all the Republican delegates yet to
be chosen in order to fashion a major
ity.
These were the results of yesterday's
two primaries:
Maryland
Democrats, with 99 percent of the
precincts counted:
Carter 221,481 0r47 percent. He led
for 32 delegates.
Kennedy I 78.472 or 38 percent and
26 delegates.
Ten percent ol the vote was uncom
mitted. for one delegate.
