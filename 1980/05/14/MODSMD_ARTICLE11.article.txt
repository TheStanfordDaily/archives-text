# Vienna becomes international city
## 
### Don Cook The Los Angeles Times 
VIENNA, Austria — Out of
the ashes of history — the demise
of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918,
annexation to Hitler's Germany
in 1938. the destruction of
World War II — Vienna is re
turning to its old glory as an in
ternational city at the crossroads
between East and West.
At the Hofburg Palace, the
table in the state dining room is
still laid for 30 people, as if Em
peror Franz Josef and his guests
were Raiting in the next room.
The Opera House, the Musikve
rein concert hall. the
Burgtheatre. St. Stephan's
Cathedral, the Art History
Museum and practically all of the
other great buildings and
churches of the past are intact.
But across the Danube from
downtown Vienna, a complex of
high-rise office buildings marks
the postwar transition of Vienna
from the empty capital of a lost
empire to a subsidiary headquar
ters for the United Nations.
Anniversary
Tomorrow will mark the 25th
anniversary of the signing of the
Austrian State Treaty, which in
1955 ended 10 years of U.S..
British. French and Soviet milit
ary occupation and restored Au
stria to full and unfettered
sovereignty.
Foreign ministers of the four
powers will be back in Vienna for
the anniversary of the treaty
signing ceremony at the Belve
dere Palace. The four who signed
were John Foster Dulles. Vya
cheslav M. Molotov, Harold
MacMillan and Antoine Pinay.
On hand this week will be Ed
mund S. Muskie. Andrei A.
Gromyko. Lord Carrington and
Jean Francois-Poncet.
The treaty was the first big
break in the Cold War following
the death of Josef Stalin. Ironi
cally. the anniversary will give
the Big Four their first opportun
ity to talk about the Soviet inva
sion ol Afghanistan last De
cember.
This is in keeping with the

principal foreign policy function
ot Austria and its Socialist chan
cellor. Bruno Kreisky — bring
East and West together.
Austria does not pretend to
have influence, power and even
much of a voice in world affairs;
its foreign policy is one of total
neutrality. But it is a handy place
to meet and talk — whether
those inv olv ed be spies in a lowly
coffee house, bureaucrats in the
conference halls of the new U.N.
City or diplomats in one of the
baroque salons of the Hofburg
Palace, where the Congress of
Vienna took place in IN 15.
Twenty-five years ago. this
city showed the scars of war at
every hand. New roofs had just
been completed on the opera
house and the cathedral. It was a
city with a great past and seem
ingly 110 future, except perhaps
as a museum.
Treaty
For nine years, the occupying
powers had been talking about
an Austrian State Treaty, but the
talks appeared to be hopelessly
deadlocked. Then, in 1955. for
reasons still unknown in the
West, Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev indicated that his
government was ready to sign a
treaty.
By that time the Russians
knew that they could never take
over Austria while the Western
powers were involv ed in the oc
cupation. Possibly. Khrushchev
reasoned that if he could get the
Americans and British and
French out of Austria by signing
a treaty, he would have a better
chance for a takeover.
Whatever Khrushchev
thought, negotiations on Austria
suddenly went into high gear,
and the text was concluded in a
rush in April of 1955. The treaty
was signed on May 15. and all
troops were withdrawn from Au
stria 90 days later.
Permanent neutrality
Then, in accordance with a
pledge given to the four occupy

ing powers, the Austrian Parlia
ment enacted a law — and made
it part of the constitution — dec
laring permanent neutrality and
ruling out any military alliances
or the establishment of any
military bases by foreign states
on Austrian soil.
Austria was again a free and
sovereign state and its leaders
again saw Vienna as fulfilling its
historic function as an East-West
crossroads.
But in the political atmos
phere of the 19505, particularly
after the Hungarian uprising was
crushed in I 956, East-West rela
tions were not very productive
tor Austria or anybody else. The
first real break for Vienna came
when President John F. Kennedy
decided to meet Khrushchev
there in May. 1961.
SALT site
Later, after Leonid Brezhnev
ousted Khrushchev and began
his pursuit of detente with the
West. Vienna became the scene

of U.S.-Soviet negotiations for
the first Strategic Arms Limita
tion Treaty, negotiations that
lasted from 1969 to 1972.
After that, it was selected as
the permanent setting for
negotiations on mutual balanced
force reduction between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza
tion and the Warsaw Pact pow
ers. These have now been in
progress more than seven years.
Meanwhile, Freisky launched
his strongest bid for interna
tional status for Vienna — the
curved towers on the banks of
the Danube, occupied last Au
gust after eight years of construc
tion, known as U.N. City. The
towers, paid for by the Austrian
taxpayers, are rented to the Un
ited Nations for a symbolic one
shilling (about six U.S. cents) a
year.
But when all is said and done,
it is the museums and the music
that still make Vienna.

ruling out any military alliances
or the establishment of any

on Austrian soil.
Austria was again a free and
sovereign state and its leaders
again saw Vienna as fulfilling its
historic function as an East-West
crossroads.
But in the political atmos
phere of the 19505, particularly
after the Hungarian uprising was
crushed in I 956, East-West rela

tor Austria or anybody else. The
first real break for Vienna came
when President John F. Kennedy
decided to meet Khrushchev
there in May. 1961.

Later, after Leonid Brezhnev
ousted Khrushchev and began
his pursuit of detente with the
West. Vienna became the scene

of U.S.-Soviet negotiations for
the first Strategic Arms Limita
tion Treaty, negotiations that
lasted from 1969 to 1972.
After that, it was selected as
the permanent setting for
negotiations on mutual balanced
force reduction between the
North Atlantic Treaty Organiza

Meanwhile, Freisky launched
his strongest bid for interna

curved towers on the banks of
the Danube, occupied last Au

towers, paid for by the Austrian
taxpayers, are rented to the Un

VIENNA, Austria — Out of
the ashes of history — the demise
of the Hapsburg Empire in 1918,
annexation to Hitler's Germany
in 1938. the destruction of
World War II — Vienna is re
turning to its old glory as an in
ternational city at the crossroads
between East and West.
At the Hofburg Palace, the
table in the state dining room is
still laid for 30 people, as if Em
peror Franz Josef and his guests
were Raiting in the next room.
The Opera House, the Musikve
rein concert hall. the
Burgtheatre. St. Stephan's
Cathedral, the Art History
Museum and practically all of the
other great buildings and
churches of the past are intact.
But across the Danube from
downtown Vienna, a complex of
high-rise office buildings marks
the postwar transition of Vienna
from the empty capital of a lost
empire to a subsidiary headquar
ters for the United Nations.
Anniversary
Tomorrow will mark the 25th
anniversary of the signing of the
Austrian State Treaty, which in
1955 ended 10 years of U.S..
British. French and Soviet milit
ary occupation and restored Au
stria to full and unfettered
sovereignty.
Foreign ministers of the four
powers will be back in Vienna for
the anniversary of the treaty
signing ceremony at the Belve
dere Palace. The four who signed
were John Foster Dulles. Vya
cheslav M. Molotov, Harold
MacMillan and Antoine Pinay.
On hand this week will be Ed
mund S. Muskie. Andrei A.
Gromyko. Lord Carrington and
Jean Francois-Poncet.
The treaty was the first big
break in the Cold War following
the death of Josef Stalin. Ironi
cally. the anniversary will give
the Big Four their first opportun
ity to talk about the Soviet inva
sion ol Afghanistan last De
cember.
This is in keeping with the

principal foreign policy function
ot Austria and its Socialist chan
cellor. Bruno Kreisky — bring
East and West together.
Austria does not pretend to
have influence, power and even
much of a voice in world affairs;
its foreign policy is one of total
neutrality. But it is a handy place
to meet and talk — whether
those inv olv ed be spies in a lowly
coffee house, bureaucrats in the
conference halls of the new U.N.
City or diplomats in one of the
baroque salons of the Hofburg
Palace, where the Congress of
Vienna took place in IN 15.
Twenty-five years ago. this
city showed the scars of war at
every hand. New roofs had just
been completed on the opera
house and the cathedral. It was a
city with a great past and seem
ingly 110 future, except perhaps
as a museum.
Treaty
For nine years, the occupying
powers had been talking about
an Austrian State Treaty, but the
talks appeared to be hopelessly
deadlocked. Then, in 1955. for
reasons still unknown in the
West, Soviet leader Nikita S.
Khrushchev indicated that his
government was ready to sign a
treaty.
By that time the Russians
knew that they could never take
over Austria while the Western
powers were involv ed in the oc
cupation. Possibly. Khrushchev
reasoned that if he could get the
Americans and British and
French out of Austria by signing
a treaty, he would have a better
chance for a takeover.
Whatever Khrushchev
thought, negotiations on Austria
suddenly went into high gear,
and the text was concluded in a
rush in April of 1955. The treaty
was signed on May 15. and all
troops were withdrawn from Au
stria 90 days later.
Permanent neutrality
Then, in accordance with a
pledge given to the four occupy

ing powers, the Austrian Parlia
ment enacted a law — and made
it part of the constitution — dec
laring permanent neutrality and
ruling out any military alliances
or the establishment of any
military bases by foreign states
on Austrian soil.
Austria was again a free and
sovereign state and its leaders
