LIMA, Peru â€” After a dozen
years under the military, the
people of Peru will vote for a
civilian government next month.
The choices they face are bewil
dering.
In all, 15 candidates are in the
running for president, represent
ing every ideological shading
from Trotskyism on the far left to
the traditional oligarchy on the
far right.
Only the Christian Democrats
are out of it. They haggled too
long over choosing a candidate
and missed the deadline for fil
ing.
Baffling array
The voters will face an even
more baffling array of candidates
for Congress. Eighteen parties
have registered lists of candi
dates for the 60 Senate seats and
180 in the Chamber of Deputies.
The experts and the polls give
only three of the candidates any
chance in the presidential race,
but under Pery's system of prop
ortional representation, all but
the smallest parties have a
mathematical chance of winning
a seat or two in Congress.
Congress' makeup is impor
tant. If none of the presidential
slates, which include a first and
second vice president, gets at
least 36 percent of the vote on
elect'in day, May 28, then the

new Congress, which will he
convened in mid-July, will have
to name the president. Inaugura
tion will he on July 28 in any
case.
First vote lor many
Right now. most experts pre
dict that in) one will gel the re
quired 36 percent on May IS.
A records.4 million Peruvians
are registered to vote, including
833,000 illiterates who will be
casting ballots tor the first time.
For nearly two-thirds of all the
voters, it will be their first chance
to express a preference for presi
dent.
Peru's last general elections
were in 1963. The victor was
Fernando Belaunde Terry, a
populist and dreamer but not a
practical politician. In 1968, an
armed forces uprising ended Be
launde's troubled administra
tion, and the military has ruled
ever since.
Big three
Belaunde. now 67, is running
again, and his personalist move
ment, the Popular Action Party,
is one of the so-called big three.
The other two are APRA. the
Popular American Revolutio
nary Alliance, with Armando
Villaneuva, 64. as its presidential
candidate, and the Popular
Christian Party, led by its foun
der, Luis Bedoya Reyes, 61, as
its presidential candidate.
The Apristas started life as a
fiery radical movement, founded
by the late Victor Raul Haya de
la Torre, Latin America's best
known revolutionary of his day.
Now, it is a Social Democratic
party. Villaneuva was one of
Maya's top lieutenants.
Bedoya. a popular mayor of
Lima in the 19605, founded the
Popular Christian Party in 1966.
leading the moderate wingout of
the then-important Peruvian
Christian Democratic Party. Be
doya describes his party as Social
Christian.
Remnants on right
All three of the leading parties
are at the center of Peru's politi
cal spectrum, with APRA and
Popular Action inclined to the
left and the Popular Christians
leaning toward the right.
The far right is represented by
the remnants of the supporters of
the late Manuel Prado, Peru's
last oligarchical president
(1956-62) and by the followers
of the late Gen. Manuel Odria, a
strongman ruler from 1948 until
1956.
The left is atomized, with 10
candidates for president and I 3
slates for Congress. Eight of the
leftist parties are avowedly Mar
xist, and four others have some

Marxist coloration.. Before the
filing deadline, the Marxists tried
frantically to improve thvir posi
tion by getting together in two
coalitions, each behind a single
slate for president and Congress.
The effort collapsed amid
squabbles over priority positions
on the congressional slates.
Leftist candidates
Among leftist presidential
candidates, the best known are
ex-guerrilla leader Hugo Blanco
and Genaro Ledesma, a labor
lawyer with a large following in
Peru's central mining region of
Cerro de Pasco.
Blanco is supported by three
Trotskyite parties, each running
a separate slate for Congress.
Ledesma. 48, a traditional
Marxist-Leninist, is the candi
date of his own creation, the Na
tional Workers', Peasants' and
Students' Front.
Peru's Moscow-recognized or
thodox Communist Party is
campaigning within a small coali
tion called Unity of the Left. Its
presidential candidate is
LeonidaS Rodriguez Figueroa.
59, a retired army general.
Velasco's constituency
Another retired general,
Javier Tantalean Vanini, 59, is
the presidential candidate for the
self-styled Political Organization
of the Peruvian Revolution.
Rodriguez and Tantalean
were prominent during the first
seven years of today's military
government, when Gen. Juan
Velasco Alvarado was experi
menting with socialism on the
Yugoslavian model. Both claim a
constituency among the late
Velasco's admirers.
All the parties, whether rich or
poor, are having their say under
a system that grants /hem free
time and space in all state
operated broadcasting stations
and newspapers, including all of
the daily newspapers in Lima.
Desire for change
Save for some of the more
exuberant militants of
Trotskyist and Maoist Marxism,
no one is being especially critical
of the armed forces. The serious
politicians do not want to leave
themselves open to charges of
being irresponsible, lest the
military men change their minds
about returning the government
to civilians.
All parties agree on an expres
sed desire for change, including
the scrapping of much of the ad
ministrative system and many of
the policies established in 12
years of military rule. None has
made'public a specific, clear and
complete program of govern
ment.
