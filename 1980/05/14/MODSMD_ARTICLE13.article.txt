### Henry Gottlieb The Associated Press 
BRUSSELS. Belgium — Officials attend
ing a meeting of North Atlantic Alliance de
fense ministers expressed doubts yesterday
that, despite U.S. proddings, all 15 NATO
nations will meet a pledge to increase de
fense spending by three percent over the next
five years.
A high-ranking U.S. Defense Department
official who asked that he not be identified
said some of the countries have failed to
commit the money needed to increase their
forces. NATO leaders agreed in Washington
in 1978 to the three percent increase in
spending to give the Soviet Union a signal
that the West was willing to back up its
rhetoric.
Canada's defense minister, J. Gilles
Lamontagne. yesterday gave full support to
U.S.-sponsored military measures to counter
the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and
pledged to meet the NATO goal to increase
defense spending three percent or more.
But some countries, notably Turkey and
Portugal, will not meet the goal because of

financial difficulties. Two countries with in
ternal political problems, Belgium and Italy,
are lagging. Denmark, which has one of the
highest per-capita incomes in the West, has
not increased its spending to meet the ag
reement.
France, which does not participate in
NATO planning, has nevertheless im
plemented the defense increase and has au
gmented its forces in the Indian Ocean and
Persian Gulf. Greece is also outside the
planning structure.
The other NATO countries are Iceland,
Holland, West Germany, Norway, Britain
and Luxembourg.
The defense ministers, including Defense
Secretary Harold Brown, heard of an
"ominous" growth in Soviet military
strength and agreed to a series of measures to
upgrade their forces.
Among the measures agreed to will he a
beefing up of European reserve strength, ad
ditions to ammunition stocks, a shifting of
supplies from the United States to Europe so
they could he deployed more quickly in case
of war and a commitment to make contracts

with European civilian airlines to move
troops from the United States to Europe in
case of war.
The measures arc to he announced for
mally today, when the defense ministers are
joined by foreign ministers, including Sec
retary of State Edmund Muskie in his first
diplomatic mission since he was sworn in last
week. Muskie has the difficult task of per
suading U.S. allies to go along with sanctions
against Iran requested by President Carter in
a move to gain the release of 53 Americans
held hostage since Nov. 4.
Bidding farewell to Muskie in
Washington, Carter said the allies "have in
formed us directly that they will carry out the
sanction commitment against Iran pending
some major breakthrough in the release of
the hostages."
Muskie said his meeting later this week in
Vienna with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei
Gromyko has "somehow emerged as a cen
terpiece of this trip" although he said he did
not expect any substantive agreements to
emerge.
