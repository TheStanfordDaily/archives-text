# Students start overseas work program
## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
University students may soon
have the opportunity to gain
some "worldly"' job experience it
all goes well with the newly -
formed Stanford International
Internship Program.
Student interns may be placed
with corporations, governments,
agencies, and international or
ganizations around the world as
early as the summer of !9N I. ac
cording to sophomore Dave
Kilby, co-coordinator of the
program, although "there is still
an enormous amount ot work to
be done between now and then."
Several past attempts at estab
lishing this kind ol program here
have failed, hut senior Susan

Brookstone, Kilhv, and sopho
more Paul /.über renewed and
pooled their efforts earlier this
year and presented a proposal to
SCI RE for credit and funding.
Apparently there is strong in
terest from several academic de
partments here, which feel the
program would be a valuable
academic complement to the
Stanford experience, according
to the group's proposal.
On April 2 1. the proposal was
approved by SCIRE, with the
possibility for future financial as
sistance left open.
The Stanford program will ini
tially be operated in conjunction
with the I 'C-Berkeley chapter of
the Association Internationale
des Estudiantes en Sciences

Economiques et Commercials
(AISEC). The AISEC program
at Berkeley lias heen in existence
tor 12 years and operates by a
trade-off arrangement, in which
American students raise intern
ships here tor foreign students,
and receive matching positions
in other countries, according to
/.über.
"Persons interested in the
Stanford program will he ex
pected to attend management
training classes at Berkeley next
fall, to learn how to go out and
sell the program to corporations
here. Also, if people want intern
ships in countries where a
foreign language is spoken, they
will have to demonstrate some

minimal proficiency in the lan
guage," /.liber said.
Most of the internships will
last between three months to a
year and a half, and will continue
all year long. Some internships
will be paid, others will only offer
credit through SCIRE, but
/über said credit through an
honors' thesis may also be avail
able.
Currently the coordinators
and a core group of about six
other students are actively work
ing to make the program func
tional bv writing letters to local
corporations, establishing an in
terim information clearin
ghouse, and trying to interest
other students in the program.
