C'haikin. president of the Inter
national Ladies' Garment
Workers Union, will deliver the
opening address at 8 p.m. mSkil
ling Auditorium.
In the next two days, 12 papers
by U.S. and British scholars will
explore unrest among I-astern
European workers. All sessions
will be held in the Large Lounge
of Tresidder Union and are open
to the public free of charge.
Conference unique
What distinguishes this con
ference from numerous others
held on the campus is the actne
role played by Stanford students.
It is an experiment into what

Political Science Prof. Jan Triska
calls "participatory education at
Stanford."
Students who ha\ e taken Tris
ka'sseminar."Politics in Eastern
Europe" and written term pap
ers on the topics of the confer
ence will act as moderators and
chair panel discussions. Follow
ing each session's presentations,
the students will offer their
critiques of each speaker's
paper. Discussion will then he
opened to the audience.
The conference is sponsored
by the Dickinson Symposium
112 und, the Otis Castle Fund,
the ILGWU, the AFL-CIO and
the Stanford Center of Russian
and East European Studies. All
students arc encouraged to at
tend and may enter and leave
freely.
A beer and wine party is also
scheduled for tomorrow at
Bechtel International Center
from 5-7 p.m. It is open to all
students, who will be able to
meet and speak with the par
ticipants of the conference.
The first part of the confer
ence co\ ers the economic, politi
cal and social attitudes and con
ditions of workers in Eastern
Europe. Unrest since the 1950s
has been a problem for the com
munist bloc governments, which
claim to be representative of the
industrial proletariat.
The second part of the confer
ence will deal with the policy
choices and options open to East
European regimes in dealing
with worker assertiveness. Pos
sible Soviet, U.S. and West
European responses will also be
considered.
Worker unrest first surfaced in
1953 in Czechoslovakia. Al
though suppressed, workers in
East Germany, Hungary, Poland
and Rumania also began to show

assertiv eness and even resort to
riots.
In Poland in 1956. worker
strikes exerted so much pressure
on the government that a pro
worker figure was elevated to a
national leadership position.
Triska said.
According to Triska. the
strikes are triggered by lack ol
food, wages and housing. The
workers then invariably ask lor
representation which is non
party controlled. "So tor
economic reasons it moves into
the political arena." Triska said.
The workers feel they are
bearing the burden of shortages
and high prices. They have re
sorted to strikes, often bloody. to
attract attention to their plight.
Riots
"The riots have the one qual
ity that you need for national
strikes — that others know about
them," Triska said. Yet they are
very costly to the workers, since
the policy of the governments is
to interfere, punish those consi
dered guilty and attempt to ap
pease the workers by improv ing
conditions.
Military intervention by the
Soviet Union to help its allies
would be damaging, Triska said.
"They don't want to take any
risks if they can help it." Yet
there is a fear that the workers
will create rivals to the com
munist parties of these countries.
All aspects of these conflicts
will be examined during the
paper presentations May 15-16.
Following an introduction by
Seymour Martin Lipset of the
departments of sociology and
political science and the Hoover
Institution at 9 a.m. tomorrow,
three papers will be presented on
the "Industrial Proletariat in
Comparative Perspective."

in Eastern Europe" begins today
on the Stanford campus. Sol
C'haikin. president of the Inter
national Ladies' Garment
Workers Union, will deliver the
opening address at 8 p.m. mSkil
ling Auditorium.
In the next two days, 12 papers
by U.S. and British scholars will
explore unrest among I-astern
European workers. All sessions
will be held in the Large Lounge
of Tresidder Union and are open
to the public free of charge.
Conference unique
What distinguishes this con
ference from numerous others
held on the campus is the actne
role played by Stanford students.
It is an experiment into what

Political Science Prof. Jan Triska
calls "participatory education at
Stanford."
Students who ha\ e taken Tris
ka'sseminar."Politics in Eastern
Europe" and written term pap
ers on the topics of the confer
ence will act as moderators and
chair panel discussions. Follow
ing each session's presentations,
the students will offer their
critiques of each speaker's
paper. Discussion will then he
opened to the audience.
The conference is sponsored
by the Dickinson Symposium
112 und, the Otis Castle Fund,
the ILGWU, the AFL-CIO and
the Stanford Center of Russian
and East European Studies. All
students arc encouraged to at
tend and may enter and leave
freely.
A beer and wine party is also
scheduled for tomorrow at
Bechtel International Center
from 5-7 p.m. It is open to all
students, who will be able to
meet and speak with the par
ticipants of the conference.
The first part of the confer
ence co\ ers the economic, politi
cal and social attitudes and con
ditions of workers in Eastern
Europe. Unrest since the 1950s
has been a problem for the com
munist bloc governments, which
claim to be representative of the
industrial proletariat.
The second part of the confer
ence will deal with the policy
choices and options open to East
European regimes in dealing
with worker assertiveness. Pos
sible Soviet, U.S. and West
European responses will also be
considered.
Worker unrest first surfaced in
1953 in Czechoslovakia. Al
though suppressed, workers in
East Germany, Hungary, Poland
and Rumania also began to show

assertiv eness and even resort to
riots.
In Poland in 1956. worker
strikes exerted so much pressure
on the government that a pro
worker figure was elevated to a
national leadership position.
Triska said.
According to Triska. the
strikes are triggered by lack ol
food, wages and housing. The
workers then invariably ask lor
representation which is non
party controlled. "So tor
economic reasons it moves into
the political arena." Triska said.
The workers feel they are
bearing the burden of shortages
and high prices. They have re
sorted to strikes, often bloody. to
attract attention to their plight.
Riots
"The riots have the one qual
ity that you need for national
strikes — that others know about
them," Triska said. Yet they are
very costly to the workers, since
the policy of the governments is
to interfere, punish those consi
dered guilty and attempt to ap
pease the workers by improv ing
conditions.
Military intervention by the
Soviet Union to help its allies
would be damaging, Triska said.
