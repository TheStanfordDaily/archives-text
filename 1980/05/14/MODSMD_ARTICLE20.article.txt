## Senate not worth the time to vote 
### 
In her column ot May S, Aleen /imberofl
implied that roughlyNO percent ol the Stan
lord student body did not 11 \ c up to its repu
ted intelligence when it tailed to vote in the
recent ASSI elections, /imberofl termed
the failure "stupid" and a "tragic neglect" of
American privilege. Indeed, /imberoft
would have us heliev e that the ASSL Senate
is or should he important to all Stanford stu
dents. and that lee assessment questions de
serve our votes, whether we vote "yes" or
"no."
It /imherotl wants me to teel guilts tor not
voting. I don't; it /imherotl believes I
shirked my civ ic responsibility. I didn't. Like
NO percent ol mv peers. I paradovicallv voted
hv not voting.
Mv not casting ballots. SO percent ot the
students here clearly indicated that thev can
not take the ASSI Senate seriously. In tact,
the senate is so unimportant to the over
whelming majority that it is not worth the
live minutes it takes to vote. I ew students
other than the senators themselves know or
even care what the senate does.
Indeed, neither the performance ot past
senates nor the campaigns ol future senators
prov ide any com ineing cv idence that the se
nate should he taken seriouslv. The übiquit
ous campaign posters ol past weeks proved
that candidates are still willing to promise
anvthing to get elected.

But how mans had read the ASSL con
stitution or its bylaws? I suspect not main.
Yet most troubling to the prospective voter
was the fact that the candidates and their
respective platforms became virtually indis
tinguishable. Nearly all ol them sei/ed upon
the issues ot upgrading campus safety. chang
ing the Coffee House, and improving
senate student communication. However,
few. it any. offered concrete or feasible solu
tions to these concerns.
Therefore, it is hardly surprising that SO
percent showed their disenchantment with
the whole organization by not voting, rather
than hypocritically lending legitimacy to a
charade.
In the matter of fee assessments, the over
whelming majority again voted by not vot
ing. By not casting ballots, they effectively
voted "no" on all fee assessments in ques
tion. Since 20 percent ot registered students
must cast ballots to validate a given fee as
sessment. failing to vote is a more effective
means of opposition than a "no" vote.
This is to say that by voting "no," the voter
helps the fee assessment attain the required
number ol votes. It. for example, in the April
fee assessment election all voters who voted
"no" on fee assessments had instead not
voted, only three issues—not all 15—would
have passed. Clearly, in this instance, those
who opposed certain fee assessments would

have been wise, not "stupid" as /imberoff
suggests, to eschew the polls.
Perhaps the time has come to re-examine
the whole of the ASSI and its elections:
perhaps it is a time for truth. Is the senate
realK worth the time and money spent on its
election'.' Couldn't the COP assume the bulk
ot the senate's duties?
Perhaps the mechanism for fee assess
ments could be changed as well. Why not
place all lee assessment questions that would
normally appear on spring ballots on each
student's P I Rand let the students vote with
their checkbooks on registration day ? In this
instance, students could check a box and add
a dollar to their fees for each organization
they wished to support. This method would
accurately gauge the support ot the organiza
tions b\ all Stanford students, force students
to evaluate whether each organization is re
alb worth their dollars, and eliminate the
inconvenience ot fee refunds.
In essence, it is a mistake to believe that
one abandons his civic responsibility when he
does not cast a ballot in an ASSI election.
The issues considered are ot little consequ
ence to most students and both moral and
practical justifications exist for not voting. It
is the system, not the actions of the over
whelming majority, that needs changing.

In her column ot May S, Aleen /imberofl
implied that roughlyNO percent ol the Stan
lord student body did not 11 \ c up to its repu
ted intelligence when it tailed to vote in the
recent ASSI elections, /imberofl termed
the failure "stupid" and a "tragic neglect" of
American privilege. Indeed, /imberoft
would have us heliev e that the ASSL Senate
is or should he important to all Stanford stu
dents. and that lee assessment questions de
serve our votes, whether we vote "yes" or
"no."
It /imherotl wants me to teel guilts tor not
voting. I don't; it /imherotl believes I
shirked my civ ic responsibility. I didn't. Like
NO percent ol mv peers. I paradovicallv voted
hv not voting.
Mv not casting ballots. SO percent ot the
students here clearly indicated that thev can
not take the ASSI Senate seriously. In tact,
the senate is so unimportant to the over
whelming majority that it is not worth the
live minutes it takes to vote. I ew students
other than the senators themselves know or
even care what the senate does.
Indeed, neither the performance ot past
senates nor the campaigns ol future senators
prov ide any com ineing cv idence that the se
nate should he taken seriouslv. The übiquit
ous campaign posters ol past weeks proved
that candidates are still willing to promise
anvthing to get elected.

But how mans had read the ASSL con
stitution or its bylaws? I suspect not main.
Yet most troubling to the prospective voter
was the fact that the candidates and their
respective platforms became virtually indis
tinguishable. Nearly all ol them sei/ed upon
the issues ot upgrading campus safety. chang
ing the Coffee House, and improving
senate student communication. However,
few. it any. offered concrete or feasible solu
tions to these concerns.
Therefore, it is hardly surprising that SO
percent showed their disenchantment with
the whole organization by not voting, rather
than hypocritically lending legitimacy to a
charade.
In the matter of fee assessments, the over
whelming majority again voted by not vot
ing. By not casting ballots, they effectively
voted "no" on all fee assessments in ques
tion. Since 20 percent ot registered students
must cast ballots to validate a given fee as
sessment. failing to vote is a more effective
means of opposition than a "no" vote.
This is to say that by voting "no," the voter
helps the fee assessment attain the required
number ol votes. It. for example, in the April
fee assessment election all voters who voted
"no" on fee assessments had instead not
voted, only three issues—not all 15—would
have passed. Clearly, in this instance, those
who opposed certain fee assessments would

have been wise, not "stupid" as /imberoff
suggests, to eschew the polls.
Perhaps the time has come to re-examine
the whole of the ASSI and its elections:
perhaps it is a time for truth. Is the senate
realK worth the time and money spent on its
election'.' Couldn't the COP assume the bulk
ot the senate's duties?
Perhaps the mechanism for fee assess
ments could be changed as well. Why not
place all lee assessment questions that would
normally appear on spring ballots on each
student's P I Rand let the students vote with
their checkbooks on registration day ? In this
instance, students could check a box and add
a dollar to their fees for each organization
they wished to support. This method would
accurately gauge the support ot the organiza
tions b\ all Stanford students, force students
to evaluate whether each organization is re
alb worth their dollars, and eliminate the
inconvenience ot fee refunds.
