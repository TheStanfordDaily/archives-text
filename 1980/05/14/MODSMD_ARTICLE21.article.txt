## Franklin accusations insubstantial' 
### 
Vice President of Public Af
fairs Robert Rosen/weig. in dec
laring Dorothy Ehrlich's discus
sions of the Bruce Franklin case
"wrong in fact, emphasis or in
terpretation." (Daily, May 9) is
in fact disguising the real issues
in the case. If the ACLU handl
ing of the case is as he describes,
"an offensive compendium of
misstatements of fact, clumsy
rhetoric . . . and not very
thoughtful or profound preach
ings on academic freedom" then
its case should clearly pose no
threat to him or the University.
It is abundantly clear, how
ever. that the University ad
ministration is threatened by the
appeal, and there are many of us
on campus who do not agree with
Rosen/weig that the "ACLU
grabbed hold ol the wrong side
of the case."
When Rosen/weig speaks ot
actions by ACLU that are "un
worthy of the organization from
which it issues." perhaps he
should be speaking about the ac
tions the University took at the
time that former Assoc. Prof.
Bruce Franklin was dismissed lor
an alleged "incitement to vio
lence." Our campus has some
history in the actual use ol vio
lence by tenured faculty, none of
whom has. as a result ot the inci
dent. received more than re
primand. warning, fine or tem
porary suspension.
Barbara Monegger. a victim ol
one such assault in I 975 by Prof.
Karl Pribram stated in a Daily
column in I 97b that "To dismiss
English Prof. Bruce Franklin for
allegedly inciting others to vio
lence (during the riots here in
1971) and to fine Pribram for
active violence against another
human being makes a mockery
ol the entire disciplinary proce
dure."
With hindsight, it is now easier
than in the emotional turmoil of
the earlier era to recognize that
the original accusations against
I rankltn were insubstantial and
that dismissal based on the two
remaining (ol the four original)
charges is not only a threat to the
protection ol tenure, but more
importantly, it is a threat to
academic freedom.
The Advisory Board majority,
(which voted for dismissal), has
already been proven wrong in its
prediction that Franklin would
be a disruptive force on campus
tor lite. He has been a member ol
the lacultv at Rutgers Unix ersitv

since 1975 and has not been a
disruptive force on that campus.
Moreover, he has been praised
by his peers at Rutgers.
For example. Norman
Samuels, dean ot the Newark Col
lege of Arts and Sciences at Rut
gers. says of him: "The high re
gard with which we view Profes
sor Franklin is most clearly
documented by our recent elex a
tion of him to the Professor II
rank. This position is reserved
for our most distinguished and
outstanding faculty members. I
personally recommended Pro
fessor Franklin highly for the
Professor 11 appointment, for I
view him as one of the outstand
ing scholars in Ins field. That
opinion is shared not only by
(Ins) colleagues here at Rutgers,
hut also, I understand, by his col
leagues throughout the nation
"Professor Franklin is a valu
able addition to our academic
community ... In no way can he
be characterized as a violent,
menacing or disruptive person."
On the other hand, the Advis
ory Board minority composed of
former Professors Donald Ken
nedy and Robert Brown pre
dicted correctly that a dismissal
would tend to stifle controversial
speech on campus. Such damage
to academic freedom and intel
lectual diversity at Stanford has
been noted by many of us over
the period of time since
Franklin's dismissal. Several fa
culty members hax c made decla
rations concerning existing fears
that do. in fact, inhibit dissent.
The creation of such a feeling
ol censorship within the Univer
sity community is clearly an
tithetical to the fundamental
idea of a university. It is this issue
that ought to constitute much ol
the real emphasis in reex aluating

the Franklin case. Since Franklin
was dismissed for doing what
many other University faculty
members were also doing at that
time (speaking out on the same
political issues), why did he pose
such a threat to the University
administration, and why was he
singled out for extraordinary
punitive measures?
The answer to that question
probably involves a number of
factors. The idea of using
Franklin as an example is proba
bly one of the more frightening
possibilities in relation to the
idea of censorship. But part of
the answer must lie in the direc
tion ot Franklin'seffectiv enessin
perceiving the real issues and his
effectiveness in mobilizing sup
port for his views. I lis charisma
tie nature and principled position
attracted a large following above
and beyond the organized back
ing by Venceremos, a group of

Franklin's supporters.
One cannot ignore the idea
that a number of potential
donors to the University might
have been distressed hy
Franklin's influence on the cam
pus. Any of a number of reasons
is more plausible than the one
maintained by the University of
"incitement to violence."
It Rosen/weig's attitude is any
indication, then to ask the Uni
\ersity administration to admit
that an inappropriate decision
was made in the heat of an emo
tional atmosphere on campus,
now seems as unlikely as it was
getting Richard Nixon to admit
that he had any involvement with
Watergate, or getting President
Jimmy Carter to admit that the
United States was guilty of
wrongdoing in Iran.

sity community is clearly an
tithetical to the fundamental
idea of a university. It is this issue
that ought to constitute much ol
the real emphasis in reex aluating

the Franklin case. Since Franklin
was dismissed for doing what
many other University faculty
members were also doing at that
time (speaking out on the same
political issues), why did he pose
such a threat to the University
administration, and why was he
singled out for extraordinary
punitive measures?
The answer to that question
probably involves a number of
factors. The idea of using
Franklin as an example is proba
bly one of the more frightening
possibilities in relation to the
idea of censorship. But part of
the answer must lie in the direc
tion ot Franklin'seffectiv enessin
perceiving the real issues and his
effectiveness in mobilizing sup
port for his views. I lis charisma
tie nature and principled position
attracted a large following above
and beyond the organized back
ing by Venceremos, a group of

Franklin's supporters.
One cannot ignore the idea
that a number of potential
donors to the University might
have been distressed hy
Franklin's influence on the cam
pus. Any of a number of reasons
is more plausible than the one
maintained by the University of
"incitement to violence."
It Rosen/weig's attitude is any
indication, then to ask the Uni
\ersity administration to admit
that an inappropriate decision
was made in the heat of an emo
tional atmosphere on campus,
now seems as unlikely as it was
getting Richard Nixon to admit
that he had any involvement with
Watergate, or getting President
Jimmy Carter to admit that the
United States was guilty of
wrongdoing in Iran.

Vice President of Public Af
fairs Robert Rosen/weig. in dec
laring Dorothy Ehrlich's discus
sions of the Bruce Franklin case
"wrong in fact, emphasis or in
terpretation." (Daily, May 9) is
in fact disguising the real issues
in the case. If the ACLU handl
ing of the case is as he describes,
"an offensive compendium of
misstatements of fact, clumsy
rhetoric . . . and not very
thoughtful or profound preach
ings on academic freedom" then
its case should clearly pose no
threat to him or the University.
It is abundantly clear, how
ever. that the University ad
ministration is threatened by the
appeal, and there are many of us
on campus who do not agree with
Rosen/weig that the "ACLU
grabbed hold ol the wrong side
of the case."
When Rosen/weig speaks ot
actions by ACLU that are "un
worthy of the organization from
which it issues." perhaps he
should be speaking about the ac
tions the University took at the
time that former Assoc. Prof.
Bruce Franklin was dismissed lor
an alleged "incitement to vio
lence." Our campus has some
history in the actual use ol vio
lence by tenured faculty, none of
whom has. as a result ot the inci
dent. received more than re
primand. warning, fine or tem
porary suspension.
Barbara Monegger. a victim ol
one such assault in I 975 by Prof.
Karl Pribram stated in a Daily
column in I 97b that "To dismiss
English Prof. Bruce Franklin for
allegedly inciting others to vio
lence (during the riots here in
1971) and to fine Pribram for
active violence against another
human being makes a mockery
ol the entire disciplinary proce
dure."
With hindsight, it is now easier
than in the emotional turmoil of
the earlier era to recognize that
the original accusations against
I rankltn were insubstantial and
that dismissal based on the two
remaining (ol the four original)
charges is not only a threat to the
protection ol tenure, but more
importantly, it is a threat to
academic freedom.
The Advisory Board majority,
(which voted for dismissal), has
already been proven wrong in its
prediction that Franklin would
be a disruptive force on campus
tor lite. He has been a member ol
the lacultv at Rutgers Unix ersitv

since 1975 and has not been a
disruptive force on that campus.
Moreover, he has been praised
by his peers at Rutgers.
For example. Norman
Samuels, dean ot the Newark Col
lege of Arts and Sciences at Rut
gers. says of him: "The high re
gard with which we view Profes
sor Franklin is most clearly
documented by our recent elex a
tion of him to the Professor II
rank. This position is reserved
for our most distinguished and
outstanding faculty members. I
personally recommended Pro
fessor Franklin highly for the
Professor 11 appointment, for I
view him as one of the outstand
ing scholars in Ins field. That
opinion is shared not only by
(Ins) colleagues here at Rutgers,
hut also, I understand, by his col
leagues throughout the nation
"Professor Franklin is a valu
able addition to our academic
community ... In no way can he
be characterized as a violent,
menacing or disruptive person."
On the other hand, the Advis
ory Board minority composed of
former Professors Donald Ken
nedy and Robert Brown pre
dicted correctly that a dismissal
would tend to stifle controversial
speech on campus. Such damage
to academic freedom and intel
lectual diversity at Stanford has
been noted by many of us over
the period of time since
Franklin's dismissal. Several fa
culty members hax c made decla
rations concerning existing fears
that do. in fact, inhibit dissent.
