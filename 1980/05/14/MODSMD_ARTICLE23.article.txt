## American Dream is dead 
### 
"We do not with sufficient
plainness or sufficient pro found
ness address ourselves to life, nor
dare we chaunt (praise in song)
our own times and social cir
cumstances. If we filled the day
with bravery, we should not
shrink from celebrating it."
—Ralph Waldo Emerson
The American Dream is dead.
Withered and broken by the
winds of economic hardship, it
has fallen victim to a world of
limited resources and burgeon
ing populations.
As the Arabian sheiks tighten
the screws on our oil supply and
as inflation ravages our dollars,
we retreat into ourselves. We
kowtow to our personal needs
and bow meekly before our sev
eral fears.
The dreams of the past quickly
fade into oblivion. The land of
opportunity has locked its doors
to the poor immigrant and closed
its ears to those who yearn for
civ il rights or equal opportunities
or. for the aged, simply respect.
While neither wind nor rain
nor cold of night can penetrate
our sand-enveloped heads, so
too is the light of the stars
excluded from our grasp.
I denounce the illness that has
pervaded our dream. I look, in
stead. to the bulwark of strength
that lies in our faith in God. in
ourselves, in our country, and in
our future. I am tired of crawling
around on my belly; 1 yearn to
stand up tall and reach for the
heavens.

I look forward to graduating
and plunging into a world of im
minent change. In change, we
slough oft our old selves and
stride forward into a promise for
improvement.
I point out the American auto
industry as an example of change
for the better. Pushing heavy.

gas-guzzling dinosaurs has
turned many a buyer's eye to
Germany and Japan. I welcome
the inevitable switch to smaller,
lighter, more efficient vehicles. I
see only good in the consequent
fuel saving, resource conserva
tion and air pollution diminu
tion.
Even if we did have to witness
a burning river before awaken
ing from our stupor, we now
admit the need to include nature
in all our plans. I see only advan
tage in listening to the biologist
as well as the engineer, for our
well-being depends on the flow
ers and the trees as much as on
the freeways.
In Revelations, John theapos

tie deliv ered God's message to
the people of Laodicea:
/ know your deeds, that you are
neither cold nor hot;
/ would that you were cold or
hot.
So because you are lukewarm,
and neither hot nor cold,
I will spit you out of My mouth.

The Laodicean America of the
'70s now slm crs before the ice of
energy shortages and shrinks be
fore the tire of inflation.
Spurred on by necessity and
fear, we will confront our prob
lems and subjugate them. We
will find our energy, whether it
be in the form of sunlight or
liquefied coal. We will clean up
our polluted rivers. We will halt
our exploding population — be
cause we must.
The future of America is over
flowing with promise. The time
has come to dream once again.
Our thin shells of satisfaction
have been shattered; we now
face the heat and the cold. We
now live again, to challenge and
to overcome.
