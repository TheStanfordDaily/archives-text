## Academic freedom at stake 
### 
There is presently a rehearing of the penalty
phase of the Franklin case before the Advisory
Board. In last week's Stanford Daily several col
umns appeared regarding this case. These gave us a
glimpse of certain aspects of the legal battle bet
ween former Prof. Bruce Franklin and the ACLU
on one side and the University's administration,
and the 1971-72 Advisory Board on the other.
We are greatly disturbed that the Advisory
Board will process this case in secret, talking only
to its lawyers. We see no reason for this case to be
dealt with behind closed doors — especially since
the appellant has asked for open proceedings, and
the rules allow it.
The Advisory Board has apparently denied
every procedural request made to it by the ACLU.
The list of denied items includes: an open and
public hearing, consideration of new material re
levant to the question of penalty, and adequate
time to prepare for the proceedings.
These requests seem to be for things a great and
tree institution would encourage. Instead, the Ad
visory Board has chosen to squelch them. We very
much regret these decisions and ask the Advisory
Board to reverse itself.
We have in our midst the most important
academic freedom case of the last decade, and this
affords a wonderful opportunity for learning. We
are, after all, an educational institution! Eight
years have passed and many of today's students
and faculty are not aware that Franklin was dis
charged because of the way he protested the Uni
versity's involvement in the Vietnam war. If we
allow these proceedings to continue in secret we in
effect deny the basic purpose of Stanford's exis
tence.
The Advisory Board's refusal to consider new
materials relevant to penalty is most disturbing. At
Stanford no.direct penalties have ever been at
tached to offenses. At the time of the original case,
there were no precedents to follow — most of the
rules and procedures were created during or after
the case. Since then, however, several other faculty

disciplinary cases have been processed and norms
seem to have been established.
Certainly the Advisory Board is aware of all
these facts. The members of the board are also
aware that Franklin has been found guilty of just
two things: making a speech that "contributed to
the likelihood" of a peaceful (but illegal) sit-in, and
making a verbal protest to a police order to dis
perse.
What is the proper penalty for these two utter
ances. especially when compared to the modest
penalties given to several professors that have since
committed offenses that are generally considered
much more grievous? The ACLU believes
Franklin is being punished not for what he is
charged with, but for his "political views, his past
political associations, and the reactions of Stanford
alumni and donors to these views and associa
tions." Hie AC'LU concludes that if the Advisory
Board restricts its deliberations to legitimate fac
tors. "a penalty of dismissal cannot be justified."
We heartily concur with this conclusion.
No matter what our personal opinions are of
Franklin, we know that every right he loses and
each precedent that is set against him diminishes
the academic freedom and procedural safeguards
available to the rest of the faculty.
What is at stake in this case is bigger than
Franklin; the ACLU apparently recognizes that,
and we hope the Advisory Board will, too.
