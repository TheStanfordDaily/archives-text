Lyman: gay arrests
A copy of the letter by Gary
Dexter IDaily, May 9) concern
ing the recent Stanford arrests of
15 (it was actually 10) men on
sex charges arriv ed when I was
attending meetings on the East
Coast, and I must apologize for
this delayed response.
The author's concerns focused
on three main points, and 1
should like to respond to them in
turn. The police department had
received recent complaints
about sexual activity in certain
restrooms on campus; I do not
believe that the University is
amiss in seeking to ensure that
normal people who xxant to use
these restrooms for their normal
intended purpose will not be in
hibited bv behavior that thev

find highly offensive.
I do not know, firsthand, if
Police Captain Raoul
Niemeyer's remark, as reported
in the San Francisco Chronicle,
was accurate. As I am sure Dex
ter would agree, even the most
reliable and well-intentioned of
reporters occasionally lapses
into misquotation or (even more
misleading) quotation out of
context.
I have learned, from the dis
cussions that followed the ar
rests. that Niemeyer's reference
to "this campus (becoming) a
hangout for homosexuals" refer
red to the restrooms on campus.
Finally, in response to your
protest of "the perspective of
your administration." I should
like to make clear what has been
said before at Stanford. We do
not. and will not. discriminate on
the basis of race, national origin,
religious affiliation, sex or sexual
preference. But even the most
liberal University proponents of
such policy will agree that the
recent situation called for inter
vention. Discrimination on the
basis of sexual preference can
have, after all. more than one
bias.
I know that representatives of
the police department have met
with members of the Gay
People's Union here, in an at
tempt to reach an accommoda

tion. These have been genuine
efforts to work cooperatively to
protect the rights of both the
majority and gay minority alike.
