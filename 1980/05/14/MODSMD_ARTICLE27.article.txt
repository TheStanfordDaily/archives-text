## 'Bee golf: The new alternative

"I don t know ij I should lay-lip short or risk going around the
corner," the first one says.
"I in gonna play it safe, the second one answers. "I don t want
to end up in the ravine and lose two strokes."
Ihe first student steps to the tee and unleashes a beautiful shot,
traveling high over the bumpy fairway. It glides slightly from left to
right but comes to rest several feet before the ravine's edge. It's in
nearly perfect position for landing near the hole in two shots.
The second student lets his shot fly. It starts off straight; bat slices
a bit to the right. "It'll play," he concedes.
Both players then amber slowly down the fairway. There's no
hurry; the course is not crowded. The second student sends his next
shot over the ravine and it floats right on line at the hole. It strikes a
tree on its descent though, and rests about six feet from destination.
Ihe first player's next shot also sails over the ravine, but hooks a
little to the left of the hole. He'll have about a 12 foot shot for a
birdie.

I he students in the little story above were playing Frisbee golf,
altectionately known as " 'Bee golf to many of its enthusiasts.
' Bee golt, rapidly becoming one ot Stanford's most popular recre
ational activities, is catching on all over the country. And with
good reason.
I happen to be a frustrated "real" golfer. I used to play the game
daily, riding my bicycle over the overpass to the municipal course
where I was a junior member. But that was ninth grade. I'm
smarter now. Golf has become too frustrating for me. I lose about
a do/en balls per nine holes (14 per nine on the Stanford course),
and I invariably astound my playing partners with my emotional
immaturity.
So, sometime last year, after another miserable showing on the
course. I quit golf— forever. Soon thereafter. I was introduced to
my recreational savior — 'Bee golf. Somewhere out of the depths
of the academic doldrums arose this shining light, this spinning,
floating disc of afternoon activity. I am now happy.
for those who have not yet experienced Bee golf, it is played
exactly like real golf in that there are usually IN holes to a course,
and each hole has a par. The "holes" on a'Bee golf course are not
always holes per se. Rather, they are usually stop signs, trees,
sprinklers or fire hydrants. So. "holing out" simply means hitting
whatever object happens to be the "hole."
Naturally, Frisbee golf is not without its frustrating moments. It
is, after all. competition, and someone is going to win and some
one is going to lose.

The setting is a ' Bee golf tournament, staged two weeks ago. One
player, having a reasonably good round, steps up to the lough 13th
hole. Unbeknown to this player, 13 is about to become his unlucky
number. Starting off a small piece of ground in front of Lambda
Nu, the hole travels across an inlet of the putrid Lag-water and ends
up at the base of a tree near the home of an unidentified faculty
member.
The golfer lets his tee shot fly but it falters over the lake and
plummets into the water. The gotfer takes to the water to retrieve his
Bee and tees off again. And again lie fails. Once more he tries, and
once more - in the water.
The player is now completely out of the running for the tourna
ment championship.

Yes. it was me; the soggy victim of treacherous winds. But
there's something about a Frisbee. perhaps it's "mellow Califor
nia" nature, that keeps the game from being overly frustrating.
I'm not sure.
Among its other advantages. Bee golf is free. No one needs
obnoxious plaid pants or silly looking hats, either. It's strictly
"come as you are."
Finally, there are probably as many 'Bee golf courses here at
Stanford as there are academic courses. And very few courses you
will ever take could possibly be as fun.

player, having a reasonably good round, steps up to the lough 13th
hole. Unbeknown to this player, 13 is about to become his unlucky
number. Starting off a small piece of ground in front of Lambda
Nu, the hole travels across an inlet of the putrid Lag-water and ends
up at the base of a tree near the home of an unidentified faculty
member.
The golfer lets his tee shot fly but it falters over the lake and
plummets into the water. The gotfer takes to the water to retrieve his
Bee and tees off again. And again lie fails. Once more he tries, and
once more - in the water.
The player is now completely out of the running for the tourna
ment championship.

Yes. it was me; the soggy victim of treacherous winds. But
there's something about a Frisbee. perhaps it's "mellow Califor
nia" nature, that keeps the game from being overly frustrating.
I'm not sure.
Among its other advantages. Bee golf is free. No one needs
obnoxious plaid pants or silly looking hats, either. It's strictly
"come as you are."
Finally, there are probably as many 'Bee golf courses here at
Stanford as there are academic courses. And very few courses you
will ever take could possibly be as fun.
/wo students stand ui the to/> of a clearing and look down
towards a sharp dogleg-left.
"I don t know ij I should lay-lip short or risk going around the
corner," the first one says.
"I in gonna play it safe, the second one answers. "I don t want
to end up in the ravine and lose two strokes."
Ihe first student steps to the tee and unleashes a beautiful shot,
traveling high over the bumpy fairway. It glides slightly from left to
right but comes to rest several feet before the ravine's edge. It's in
nearly perfect position for landing near the hole in two shots.
The second student lets his shot fly. It starts off straight; bat slices
a bit to the right. "It'll play," he concedes.
Both players then amber slowly down the fairway. There's no
hurry; the course is not crowded. The second student sends his next
shot over the ravine and it floats right on line at the hole. It strikes a
tree on its descent though, and rests about six feet from destination.
Ihe first player's next shot also sails over the ravine, but hooks a
little to the left of the hole. He'll have about a 12 foot shot for a
birdie.

Sounds like they're ott to ;i nice afternoon of golf, right?
Wrong.
I he students in the little story above were playing Frisbee golf,
altectionately known as " 'Bee golf to many of its enthusiasts.
' Bee golt, rapidly becoming one ot Stanford's most popular recre
ational activities, is catching on all over the country. And with
good reason.
I happen to be a frustrated "real" golfer. I used to play the game
daily, riding my bicycle over the overpass to the municipal course
where I was a junior member. But that was ninth grade. I'm
smarter now. Golf has become too frustrating for me. I lose about
a do/en balls per nine holes (14 per nine on the Stanford course),
and I invariably astound my playing partners with my emotional
immaturity.
So, sometime last year, after another miserable showing on the
course. I quit golf— forever. Soon thereafter. I was introduced to
my recreational savior — 'Bee golf. Somewhere out of the depths
of the academic doldrums arose this shining light, this spinning,
floating disc of afternoon activity. I am now happy.
for those who have not yet experienced Bee golf, it is played
exactly like real golf in that there are usually IN holes to a course,
and each hole has a par. The "holes" on a'Bee golf course are not
always holes per se. Rather, they are usually stop signs, trees,
sprinklers or fire hydrants. So. "holing out" simply means hitting
whatever object happens to be the "hole."
Naturally, Frisbee golf is not without its frustrating moments. It
is, after all. competition, and someone is going to win and some
one is going to lose.
