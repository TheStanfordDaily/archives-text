# Should undergrads, graduates be separated?
## Housing changes under consideration 
### Sara Whittier Staff Writer 
With the new dormitory west of Lagunita Hall
being planned, major housing changes are under con
sideration, including some integration of graduate
and undergraduate housing.
According tf) Craig Richards, president of the Es
condido Village Council, there is an artificial separa
tion of advanced undergraduates and masters stu
dents that should not exist. "In general I'm for integ
rating graduate and undergraduate housing," he said.
Richards added that he strongly believes the new
housing should not segregate graduates (especially
single graduates) and undergraduates.
Associate Dean of Residential Education Norm
Robinson said that the distinction between graduates
and undergraduates is "more than artificial." Robin
son pointed out that there is often a large age differ
ence between the groups. Also, graduates often have
a greater degree of specialization in their area of
study.
Differences
Robinson said that there was "quite a difference"
in his goals for graduate and undergraduate housing.
"For undergraduates we are more concerned with
their total development." he said.
"All graduate students have had the opportunity to
participate in an undergraduate housing system
either here or at another institution," said Robinson.
"Juniors and seniors have had only one to three years
of undergraduate on-campus housing."
Housing Center Director Rodger Whitney, who
chairs the Graduate Housing Policy Committee, said

the idea of desegregating graduates and under
graduates has "been tossed around and has some real
merits."
According to Whitney, the University "needs to try
to meet the diverse need of graduate students."
No displacement
Any integration which might take place would not
take away housing from undergraduates, Whitney
asserted. "It would be a swapping of housing which
would benefit undergraduates who want a quieter
setting or be around graduates," he said.
The Graduate Housing Policy Committee has been
meeting since the beginning of this quarter. The
committee includes representatives trom each group
of graduate students: those who are either single,
married or have children.
The committee meets weekly to discuss housing
issues including eligibility and allocation for housing,
contract problems, security and quality of life for
graduate students.
Forceful
Whitney said he expects a "series of strong recom
mendations" to come from the committee by the end
of this quarter. These will be considered by the Resi
dential Education and Student Affairs offices.
It is not yet known what these recommendations
will be, but Robinson indicated that no shifts would
be in the housing system until after the proposed
additional 800 units of housing are constructed west
of Lagunita Hall.
Once that project is complete, Robinson said the
Res Ed office may consider the Manzanita Park trail
ers as a possible option for graduate housing.

The Governance Advisory Committee of the Es
condido Village Council recommended in its an
nual report that Manzanita Park be changed to a
half-graduate/half-undergraduate area with three
students to a trailer.
Richards, however, feels that this "is not a satisfac
tory solution." He expressed doubts about the condi
tions in Manzanita, saying, "the showers are falling
through the floor."
Whitney said that the Graduate Housing Policy
Committee plans to take a position on the Manzanita
issue by the end of the quarter.
The Governance Advisory Committee's report,
which was distributed to the Res Ed and Business and
Finance offices; suites that "a current proposal to
build new housing will not yield a single additional
permanent housing unit for graduate students, even
though funds from graduate housing will help pay for
them."
Rent increase
Residents of Escondido Village will see a two percent
rent increase next year in addition to the 11-12 per
cent increase that will apply to all University housing.
The Governance report attributes the additional
two percent to the cost of financing the new under
graduate housing.
Robinson, however, said that the increase is re
lated to the relative market. It is necessary to keep
undergraduate rents at a level competitive with other
undergraduate institutions, he said.
Even with the two percent increase, Escondido
Village rents are still substantially lower than off
campus rates, Robinson said.

participate in an undergraduate housing system
either here or at another institution," said Robinson.
"Juniors and seniors have had only one to three years
of undergraduate on-campus housing."
Housing Center Director Rodger Whitney, who
chairs the Graduate Housing Policy Committee, said

the idea of desegregating graduates and under
graduates has "been tossed around and has some real
merits."
According to Whitney, the University "needs to try
to meet the diverse need of graduate students."
No displacement
Any integration which might take place would not
take away housing from undergraduates, Whitney
asserted. "It would be a swapping of housing which
would benefit undergraduates who want a quieter
setting or be around graduates," he said.
The Graduate Housing Policy Committee has been
meeting since the beginning of this quarter. The
committee includes representatives trom each group
of graduate students: those who are either single,
married or have children.
The committee meets weekly to discuss housing
issues including eligibility and allocation for housing,
contract problems, security and quality of life for
graduate students.
Forceful
Whitney said he expects a "series of strong recom
mendations" to come from the committee by the end
of this quarter. These will be considered by the Resi
dential Education and Student Affairs offices.
It is not yet known what these recommendations
will be, but Robinson indicated that no shifts would
be in the housing system until after the proposed
additional 800 units of housing are constructed west
of Lagunita Hall.
Once that project is complete, Robinson said the
Res Ed office may consider the Manzanita Park trail
ers as a possible option for graduate housing.

The Governance Advisory Committee of the Es
condido Village Council recommended in its an
nual report that Manzanita Park be changed to a
half-graduate/half-undergraduate area with three
students to a trailer.
Richards, however, feels that this "is not a satisfac
tory solution." He expressed doubts about the condi
tions in Manzanita, saying, "the showers are falling
through the floor."
Whitney said that the Graduate Housing Policy
Committee plans to take a position on the Manzanita
issue by the end of the quarter.
The Governance Advisory Committee's report,
which was distributed to the Res Ed and Business and
Finance offices; suites that "a current proposal to
build new housing will not yield a single additional
permanent housing unit for graduate students, even
though funds from graduate housing will help pay for
them."
Rent increase
Residents of Escondido Village will see a two percent
rent increase next year in addition to the 11-12 per
cent increase that will apply to all University housing.
The Governance report attributes the additional
two percent to the cost of financing the new under
graduate housing.
Robinson, however, said that the increase is re
lated to the relative market. It is necessary to keep
undergraduate rents at a level competitive with other
undergraduate institutions, he said.
Even with the two percent increase, Escondido
Village rents are still substantially lower than off
campus rates, Robinson said.
