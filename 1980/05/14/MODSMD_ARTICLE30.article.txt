## 
### Sid Spaeth Staff Writer 
Thy Stanford women's tennis
team lost to UCLA on May 3 and
head coach F rank Brennan was
seeking vengeance when the
Cards were scheduled to host
Arizona State the following
Monday. After this match was
canceled, Brennan was "fum
ing" going into the Northern
California Women's Tennis
Tournament last weekend. This
tournament was canceled due to
rain and now the Cards are faced
with the unenviable task of sort
ing out their frustrations at the
AIAW Southern Regional Ten
nis Tournament in Santa Bar
bara this weekend after nearly a
two week layoff.
Undefeated and No. I ranked
USC will be favored to take the
tournament, while Stanford and
UCLA are expected to battle it
out for second.
The' Cards have beaten the
Bruins by 5-4 margins twice this
year, but fell to them by the same
score earlier this month.
The Cards have been beaten
three times by USC — once at
the Brigham Young Invitational
and twice in a home and home
dual series.
The Trojans are led by Trey
Lewis, the tournament's No. 1
seed. Lewis has beaten Stan
ford's No. 1 player. Alycia Moul
ton, twice this season, includinga
6-2, 7-6 win at Maples last
month. Moulton will be seeded
second in the tournament.
Following Lewis on USC's
ladder is Anna Maria Fernandez,
who after two previous losses to
Stanford's Donna Rubin, came
back at Maples to trounce her
6-3. 6-1. Both coaches felt that it
was Fernandez' best match of the

year.
Fernandez is followed by Ann
White, Sheila Mclnerney, Nina
Voydat and twin sister Anna
Lucia Fernandez.
Lewis and White team up for
the first seeded doubles team.
Anna Maria teams with Mclner
ney while Anna Lucia teams with
Susie Brown.
For Stanford, Rubin will play
No. 2 behind Moulton and has
been seeded third. Brennan
commented on this, "Even
though Fernandez beat her the
last time. Donna had already
beaten her twice. She's just
played too consistently well all
year — there is no way they
could keep her from being the
No. 3 seed."
Freshman Carvn Copeland
will be the third Stanford singles
player followed hy Sue Rasmus
sen. Julia Leighton and Lisa
Gordon.
Moulton and Rasmussen will
play doubles and are the No. 2
seed. Rubin will play with Cope
land and Leighton will team with
Gayle Chan.
UCLA's line-up is headed by
Kathy O'Brien followed by Lucy
Gordon, Karin Huebner, Becky
Bell, l.iz Stadler and Cindy
Campbell.
In doubles. O'Brien and Bell
play together; Huebner and
Gordon team up; and Campbell
is teamed with Stalder.
This weekend's tournament is
important because it goes a long
way in determining who will
qualify for Nationals. From the
singles bracket 17 to 2 I players
will be chosen for the national
tournament next month.
