PH1LADEI I'M I A — i 1c just
comes off a bench, not out of a
phone booth. But while Los
Angeles has Ear\in Magic"
Johnson. Philadelphia lias the
magician, Julius Erving.
Sure. Darr\l Dawkins scored
26 points Sunday. Maurice
Cheeks had IN. and Lionel Hol
lins IS (along with 13 assists)
when the 76ers beat the Lakers
105-102 to send the National
Basketball Association champ

ionship series into tonight's fifth
game with the teams tied at two
\ ictorics apiece.
But despite their heroics, the
catalyst for the 76ers still was
Er\ ing. Dr. J psyched the Lakers
at the start and put them away at
the end with 10 final-period
clutch points, including one bas
ket that defies description.
When the game started, the
7hcrs immediately went into a
one-man offense. They sent four
men to one side and left Er\ ing
one-on-two on the other. With

two men playing Erving, and
kareem Abdul-Jabbar roaming
the top of the key. the Lakers
were assessed a technical foul for
using a zone defense.
Erving made the free throw,
but that wasn't as important as
the confusion it caused the Los
Angeles defense. The 76ers used
the isolation maneuver half a
dozen times or more in the first
period in which they built a
seven-point edge. It kept the
Lakers' zone conscious.
Er\ ing shot 9-for-17 from the
field, five-of-six at the foul line,
grabbed three rebounds and con
tributed three assists, perhaps
not one of his greatest perfor
mances, but certainly one of his
most effective.
Jabbar intimidates opponents
with his 7-foot-2. which gives
him shot-blocking ability, and
scoring prowess. Er\ing just in
timidates you by beini> on the

floor.
I here are better shooters than
Erving. There are better defen
ders. There may be better
players without the ball. There
are better rebounders. There
may he a better plavmaker.
It. however, you can tind one
plaver who does these things to
tally better than Er\ ing, give him
the telephone booth, the Bat
mobile. or the Uoudini Memo
rial Trophy.
Perhaps Erving's biggest asset
is his humility . Win or lose.a per
sonal good game or poor game,
his demeanor rarely changes.
He's low key. answers questions
thoughtfully and intelligently.
He's polite, aware of his respon
sibility oil the court as well as on.
He's charitable, gets involved in
community affairs.
Erving appreciates effort. He
didn't talk about his 10 last
period points that frustrated the

Lakers. He talked of Daw kins,
the 6-1 1 V; center who came to
the NBA tour years ago from
high school. The big guv is lov ed
by most fans, but has been under
the critical hammer of so-called
experts for his sometimes lac
kadasical play.
Dawkins hasn't been lackadas
ical in this series. He's averaging
1 «S points per game.
"Darryl played like the big
game player he is." said Erv ing.
"We were really struggling until
'Double D' got going and started
dominating. He displayed real
leadership . . . he was carrying lis
on his shoulders and everybody
responded to that.
"Darryl might say this is my
team, but none ot us are going
too far without him."
Dawkins, however, tossed the
ball right back: "Doc's our
leader. I don't want that pres
sure."

ket that defies description.
When the game started, the
7hcrs immediately went into a
one-man offense. They sent four
men to one side and left Er\ ing
one-on-two on the other. With

two men playing Erving, and
kareem Abdul-Jabbar roaming
the top of the key. the Lakers
were assessed a technical foul for
using a zone defense.
Erving made the free throw,
but that wasn't as important as
the confusion it caused the Los
Angeles defense. The 76ers used
the isolation maneuver half a
dozen times or more in the first
period in which they built a
seven-point edge. It kept the
Lakers' zone conscious.
Er\ ing shot 9-for-17 from the
field, five-of-six at the foul line,
grabbed three rebounds and con
tributed three assists, perhaps
not one of his greatest perfor
mances, but certainly one of his
most effective.
Jabbar intimidates opponents
with his 7-foot-2. which gives
him shot-blocking ability, and
scoring prowess. Er\ing just in
timidates you by beini> on the

floor.
I here are better shooters than
Erving. There are better defen
ders. There may be better
players without the ball. There
are better rebounders. There
may he a better plavmaker.
It. however, you can tind one
plaver who does these things to
tally better than Er\ ing, give him
the telephone booth, the Bat
mobile. or the Uoudini Memo
rial Trophy.
Perhaps Erving's biggest asset
is his humility . Win or lose.a per
sonal good game or poor game,
his demeanor rarely changes.
He's low key. answers questions
thoughtfully and intelligently.
He's polite, aware of his respon
sibility oil the court as well as on.
He's charitable, gets involved in
community affairs.
Erving appreciates effort. He
didn't talk about his 10 last
period points that frustrated the

Lakers. He talked of Daw kins,
the 6-1 1 V; center who came to
the NBA tour years ago from
high school. The big guv is lov ed
by most fans, but has been under
the critical hammer of so-called
experts for his sometimes lac
kadasical play.
Dawkins hasn't been lackadas
ical in this series. He's averaging
1 «S points per game.
"Darryl played like the big
game player he is." said Erv ing.
"We were really struggling until
'Double D' got going and started
dominating. He displayed real
leadership . . . he was carrying lis
on his shoulders and everybody
responded to that.
"Darryl might say this is my
team, but none ot us are going
too far without him."
Dawkins, however, tossed the
ball right back: "Doc's our
leader. I don't want that pres
sure."
