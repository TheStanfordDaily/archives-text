Doctors claim Cuban refugees ill
KEY WEST. Ha. — Navy doctors treating Cuban
refugees charged yesterday that Fidel Castro is ship
ping mental patients and the dying among thousands
seeking asylum in the United States — people suffer
ing from cancer, tuberculosis and even leprosv.
But the doctors said there is no ev idenee that the
Cuban president is deporting carriers ot highly con
tagious diseases.
The number ot arrivals from Cuba on the "Free
dom Flotilla" has slowed considerably. By mid-day
yesterday, only one refugee boat had arrived in 24
hours. A total ot 37.000 Cubans have made the cros
sing since the boatlift began April 21.
Key West has virtually cleared ot refugees, most
sent either to Miami or Fort Chaltee. Ark
Navy doctors said recent refugees included some
sick people, and Dr. Tom \ aides said he believes
Castro is sending the sick "on purpose to hurt
people."
The doctors also treated a man suffering from lep
rosy. He was sent to a U.S. Public Health Service
Hospital in Carville. La.
"He does not have what you would call serious
leprosy." said Dr. J R. Pere/-Po\eda. "But they
knew he had leprosy. He said they came to his home
and put him on the boat."
Meanwhile immigration officials in Fort Chaffee
said they have begun sending the Cubans' names to
f-BI computers in the lirst step ot what they termed an
in-depth investigation ot the exiles.
Ronald Brooks, an Immigration and Naturaliza
tion Serv ice officer who is second in command of the
service's operation here, said his agency expects to
"weed out" possibly do/ens of would-be immigrants
who may have serious criminal records — especially
narcotics violations — from among the nearly 6000
Cubans at this army post.
Brooks said the agency would recommend that
those with serious violations undergo hearings that
could result in an attempt to send them hack to Cuba.
Captain testifies on Fla. accident
TAMPA. Fla. — In the minutes before the "Sum
mit Venture" tore out a section of the Sunshine Sky
way Bridge, the pilot of the 608-foot freighter re
versed engines, ordered the anchor dropped and took
a hard left turn.the ship's captain testified yesterday.
"When the pilot asked me to stand by the anchor. 1
figured something might be wrong." Capt. H.C. Liu
told a marine board of inquiry investigating the
tragedy.
Eight vehicles, including a bus with 23 persons
aboard, fell into Tampa Bay w hen 1400 feet of bridge
collapsed after the Friday morning collision.
As the board opened its hearings yesterday, the
bodies of a man and two women were found in the
bay. raising the toll ot known dead to 34. Paul
Marino, a spokesman tor the Hillsborough County
Sheriffs office, said searchers believed the wreckage
under the bridge held another victim — the missing
husband ot a woman whose bodv was found earlier.
"Liu said that after harbor pilot John Lerro. 37.
ordered the anchor dropped, the ship hit the bridge in
a "very, very short" time.
The skipper said he was not able to see the bridge
before the crash during a thunderstorm. He sa'd the
weather was so bad that he could not see the bouys
marking a turn in the channel 1500 yards west of the
bridge. He was asked if he could see it afterward:
"Sure.' he replied. "1 saw it falling down."
In another development yesterday, the owners of
the Liberian-registered ship tiled a federal court suit
in Tampa seeking to be absolv ed of blame and claim
ing that the accident was caused by "sudden violent
thunderstorms."

dav with a challenge to the Soviet Union to begin

normalizing relations with the I nitcd States by with
drawing its troops from Afghanistan.

France to send team to Olympics
Fhe French Olympic Committee voted yesterday
to send a team to this summer's Moscow Olympic
Games, dealing a blow to Carter administration
hopes tor a broad-based boycott.
Although a number ot small countries have joined
the boycott, which now totals at least 37 nations and
territories, the administration had been speculating
for months that the French would follow a West
German lead and stay away from Moscow.
Instead, with the reported backing of the govern
ment of President Valery Giscard d'Estaing. the
French Olympic Committee took its vote two days
before the West Germans in a bid to lead wavering
Western European countries toward attending the
Games.
With the West German committee due to decide
tomorrow in Dusseldorf. such key European coun
tries as I ranee. Britain. Ireland. Switzerland. Swe
den. Denmark and Greece already are committed to
going to Moscow. Only Norway and the principalities
ot Monaco and Liechtenstein hav joined the boycott
in Europe so far.
Claude Collard. head of the French Olympic
Committee, said the vote in the committee's execu
tive board was 22 to 0. with one abstention.
Collard insisted that the committee's decision was
based on sports considerations and not politics. "We
refuscMhat our athletes be used for political ends," he
said.
Sadat to resume Palestinian talks
WASHINGTON — Egyptian President Anwar
Sadat yesterday assured President Jimmy Carter in a
telephone conversation that he will resume the stal
led Palestinian autonomy talks quickly, probably
making that announcement today. Carter said.
Last riiursday Sadat suspended the talks, which
concern efforts to grant autonomy to 1.2 million
Palestinians who live on the Israeli-occupied West
Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip. The
Camp Dav id accords set a May 26 deadline for reach
ing agreement.
Sadat's move comes two days after he accepted the
resignation of all his Cabinet ministers, including
Prime Minister Mustafa Khalil. who had been
Egypt's chief negotiator in the talks with Israel.
Carter was asked what Sadat's Cabinet moves
might mean in terms of internal Egyptian affairs. The
president replied that he thought Sadat intended to
"play a greater role in the administration of domestic
programs in Egypt in the months immediately ahead
— more than he has in the past."
Olympic athletes may lose suit
WASHINGTON — U.S. District Judge John Pratt
indicated vesterdav that he would rule against a

group of 20 Olympic athletes who brought a suit
seeking to require the U.S. Olympic Committee to
send a team to the Moscow Games this summer.
Pratt, in what seemed an unusual tipping of his
judicial hand, said from the bench that he did not like
"to do acts that are futile" or to "engage in confronta
tion with the executive branch."
The heart of their argument was that the U.S.
Olympic Committee overstepped its authority,
granted by the Amateur Sports Act ol 1978, in its
April 12 decision not to send a team this year because
of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
Military takes over in Uganda
KAMPALA, Uganda — A six-man military com
mission formed a new Ugandan government yester
day and accused ousted President Godfrey Binaisaof
corruption, tribalism and incompetence.
The commission, which has exercised little power
until Binaisa's run-in with the military last weekend,
is he'aded b\ Labor Minister Paulo Muwanga, but it is
not clear if he will be the strong man or merely a
figurehead for the military.
A spokesman at the presidential residence added
to the cofifusion, saying that Binaisa was still in
power.
Radio Kampala announced, however, that a 3- or
4-man presidential commission, presumably includ
ing the military, would be named soon to carry out
Binaisa's duties pending elections, which the radio
said are still scheduled for December. The 37-man
Cabinet was also dismissed.
Ugandan troops, mainly armed with Chinese ak-47
rifles, patrolled key installations in downtown Kam
pala. Tanzanian soldiers, who overthrew dictator Idi
Amin last year, still were in control of Entebbe, site of
the country's i' rnational airport and the presiden
tial residence ..here Binaisa has reportedly re
mained.
Police state controls West Bank
JERUSALEM — Israeli police and soldiers
clamped down on the press, striking businessmen and
centers of anti-Israeli sentiment on the West Bank
yesterday as the nation began its most beleaguered
observance of Jerusalem's reunification since 1967.
Rockets flared over the walled Old City of
Jerusalem in obser\ ance of the anniversary of the day
13 years ago when Israeli troops drove Jordanian
forces from the Old City and East Jerusalem. Sear
chlights from a row of tanks sent a blaze of light into
the sky.
Soldiers were everywhere — to prevent possible
attempts by the Palestinian underground to interrupt
the festivities — underscoring the military presence
with which Israel imposed a tense peace on its con
quests of 1 967. Jerusalem Day 1980 was marked by
the military's heavy-handed use of power:
— The military governor broke up a news confer
ence at Nablus as Bassam Shaka, mayor of the West
Bank city, was protesting to foreign correspondents
about Israeli orders barring Nablus from sending
food and medicine to Anabta, an Arab city under
military curfew since May 1. "As of now, Nablus is
closed to the press," an officer said.
— The round-the-clock curfew continued in Heb
ron. second biggest West Bank city (next to Nablus),
which was the scene of the slaying on May 2 of six
Israelis in an attack on religious students by Arab
guerrillas. There was no indication when the curfew
would be lifted.
