# Gas tax of 10 cents is blocked by court
## 
### Laura Kiernan Art Pine The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON â€” A federal judge
here ruled yesterday that President
Jimmy Carter overstepped his author
ity in imposing an oil import fee that
would have increased the price of
gasoline 10 cents a gallon starting to
morrow.
Carter imposed the fee in part to dis
courage energy consumption by driv
ing up its cost, in part to raise extra
money to help balance next year's
budget.
To spread out and minimize its im
pact, he set up a system to pass along all
its added cost in gasoline prices
nationwide, rather than let it fall on
heating oil or disproportionately on
such import-dependent regions as New
England.
U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey
Robinson noted yesterday that, while
Carter does have power to impose fees
on imported oil. Congress expressly
has denied him his power to restrain
gasoline consumption by imposition of

any tax or fee.
Carter's fee plan. Robinson wrote,
"is an attempt to circumvent that
stumbling block in the guise of an im
port control measure."
The government was expected to
take Robinson's decision immediately
to the waiting U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals tor the District, which three
times in recent months has overruled
district judges here and upheld the
president's authority to take controv
ersial actions in other fields.
It the import fee survives in the ap
peals court, however, it may be shot
down in Congress. There ha\e been
moves in both House and Senate this
week to scuttle the fee. even though
both houses are also looking toward
the $10.3 billion in revenue it would
provide as insurance in balancing the
fiscal 1981 budget they are now work
ing on.
The panel agreed to postponement
after Treasury Secretary William Mil
ler asked permission to appear before
the subcommittee this morning. Miller
had passed up an earlier opportunity to
testify.
Subcommittee Chairman Charles
Vanik (D-Ohio) said he was sure a
majority would vote to roll back the
import fee despite the secretary's tes
timony.
"The oil import fee is dead," Vanik
told reporters.
Committee sources said an informal
count showed 17 of the subcommittee's
20 members in favor of repealing the
fee. Under the new crude-oil tax bill.
Congress may override by resolution
any fee Carter imposes.
He then can veto the resolution of
disapproval. Congress can override a
veto with two-thirds votes in both
houses. Carter thus needs only one
third plus one in either house to prevail
on the issue.
House Speaker Thomas O'Neill
(D-Mass.) said he thinks a resolution
opposing the fee would pass on the
House floor "in a walk."
A team of administration \obby\sts,
led by Miller, spent most of yesterday
visiting members of Vanik's subcom
mittee in an effort to persuade them to
support the president's program.
The unpopularity of the import fee in
the Senate was demonstrated yester
day when that chamber voted against it
on a procedural test vote, 75 to 19.
Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan), ranking
minority member on the Senate Fi
nance Committee and chief sponsor of
the Senate's proposal to rollback the
import fee, said yesterday he expected
Robinson's decision would give Con
