# Iranians accuse American helicopters of military provocation
## 
### 
From the Daily wire services
Several American helicopters flew over Iranian ships
working in Persian Gulf oil fields but switched course after
Iran's armed forces were alerted, Tehran Radio reported
yesterday. The Pentagon denied the report.
But Iranian Oil Minister Ali Akbar Moinfar was quoted
as saying security at Iran's oil fields would be stepped up
following the reported incident Monday night, and the offi
cial Soviet news agency Tass denounced the "new provoca
tion by the American military." as "fresh proof of the fact
that Washington continues to make plans for new military
ventures against Iran."
Tass quoted the Tehran newspaper, Rambad, as saying
live U.S. Naval helicopters dropped a foamy chemical sub
stance over the Persian Gulf, causing a large fire on the
water near Iran's coast.
The United States has about two dozen ships off Iran,
including aircraft carriers from which helicopters can fly.

However, the Pentagon said no helicopters were in the area.
Tehran Radio also quoted the commander of the Bandar
Abbas Air Base in southeastern Iran as saying there had
been a military intrusion, of an unspecified nature, near
there Monday night. The report said workers at two oil
refineries had observed it and the Iranian navy had con
firmed it.
There were no reports of fighting, however, and the
report said none of the unidentified intruders was found.
Bandar Abbas is located near the Straight of Hormuz,
through which much of the world's oil passes for shipment
overseas.
Moinfar was quoted by Tehran Radio as saying Iran is
now producing 2 million barrels of oil a day, one of the
lowest levels admitted to by Tehran officials since the fall of
the shah. The shah's regime had pumped as much as 6
million barrels a day.
In an interview published in a Rome newspaper, Iranian

Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh was quoted as saying
about the 50 American hostages who spent their 192 nd day
in captivity yesterday:
"We are making all possible efforts to solve this problem
in a just way. But every time that we are near to a solution,
the Americans do something that is catastrophic and
dramatic and which spoils such efforts . . . The United
States has built this problem into a disproportionate crisis
— one of the worst the world has ever faced. You Euro
peans must not accept the dimension of the problem wanted
by Washington. Give us confidence (to solve the problem).
We' are trying."
However, in Copenhagen, the Danish Parliment voted
128-to-14 to back economic sanctions against Iran, and
other Western European parliaments were expected to fol
low suit soon.
Last month, the nine European Common Market coun
tries, including Denmark, said they would impose economic

sanctions against Iran and limit diplomatic contacts with the
Iranian government unless "decisive progress" was made
toward freeing the hostages by May 17.
In other developments, Iran captured top-secret pictures
taken by the American KH-11 spy satellite in sifting
through the helicopters abandoned in the Iranian desert.
U.S. officials said yesterday.
ABC Television obtained maps U.S. planners drew with
the help of those satellite pictures. The maps identified
possible evacuation points in Tehran. The helicopter land
ing zones were called "bus stops."
Sources said the plan called for landing the helicopters in
the embassy compound and snatching away the 50 hostages
if the Blue Light commandos radioed that all was clear.
If the compound had become a "hot" landing zone be
cause ot Iranian resistance, these sources said, "bus stops"
in clear spots near the embassy could have been used for
evacuating the hostages.
