# Attorneys debate on professional ethics in law

### Fran Miller Staff Writer 
"People aren't looking for a guy
(lawyer) who's gonna read the Code
of Professional Ethics. They want a
guy who's gonna get out there and
fight like hell and who'sgonna win. I
believe the code does nothing more
than take us out of the land of real
ity."
Speaking before a lull Kresge Au
ditorium Monday night. New York
attorney Roy Cohn made these
comments during a panel discussion
"Ethics in Law," sponsored by the
American Studies house and the
ASSU Speakers Bureau.
Along with Cohn, who served as
Chief Counsel to Joe McCarthy dur
ing the Army-McCarthy hearings,
members of the panel included
Douglas Schmidt, San Francisco at
torney and defense counsel for Dan
White, and Stanford Law School
Prof. Deborah Rhode,
specialist in "Legal Ethics." San
Francisco attorney Melvin Belli was
scheduled to speak but was unable
to attend.

Discussion centered around a
hypothetical homicide case which
was presented to the audience at the
start of the program. The speakers
were asked to develop a hypotheti
cal defense, keeping in mind the
ethical issues involved.
Hypothetical case
According to the case, Simon
Smith murders Janet Jones after a
heated argument with her. The only
witness is a near-sighted mental pa
tient, Mrs. Wilson.
Smith is arrested after depositing
his murder weapon in a train station
locker. While awaiting trial. Smith
admits to the crime and gives his
lawyer the key to the locker. He also
tells him that his friend Bob Brown
is willing to testify that the two of
them were 500 miles away at the
time of the crime.
Rhode began the discussion,
commenting that the American Bar
Association would, "in theory,"
constrain a defense attorney's
strategy for this case, which she con
sidered to be a "contrived factual
situation." She said that a lawyer

need not be discreet when cross
examining Wilson because any facts
which affect the case are legitimate
and an attorney is "not entitled to
usurp the function of a judge and
jury."
Rhode said, however, that the
ABA "draws the line at fabrica
tion," and that the false alibi which
constitutes known perjury should
not be elicited from Smith or
Brown. In addition, she advocated
revealing the gun, saying that "an
attorney shouldn't suppress evi
dence he is legally obligated to pro
duce."
Schmidt said that in order to
properly defend someone, the client
must be encouraged to tell his attor
ney the entire truth so that the facts
can be fully developed. He said that
Smith's alibi is unrealistic, and
probably would not "hold to
gether." Schmidt said that, if faced
with this situation, he would suggest
the possibility of other alternatives.
Ethics
It is a lawyer's responsibility to
defend his client as best he can and

that not only is it "ethical" to
thoroughly cross-examine Wilson,
it is his "affirmative duty" to do so,
Schmidt said.
Schmidt also said that since the
law says that an attorney and his
client have an in\ iolate relationship,
but it is illegal to conceal evidence,
he would not seek to gain possession
of the gun and would not accept the
key to the locker. "You have no
duty to make a case against your
client," he said. He added, however,
that if he were to receive the gun, he
would have to turn it over to the
police, but would not breach the
confidence with his client by reveal
ing where he got it
Cohn agreed with Schmidt, and
said that "you can't turn your client
in." The "quicker you end your de
fense case the better off you are,"
Cohn said. He added that it is usu
ally advantageous not to put the de
fendant on the stand if you can help
it.
Cohn stressed the point that
those who revise the Code of Pro
