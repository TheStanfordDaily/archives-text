## North Koreans infiltrate South 
### William Chapman The Washington Post 
SEOUL. South Korea
South Korean troops were
stationed at public buildings in
Seoul early yesterday as uncon
firmed rumors spread of a North
Korean attempt to step up infilt
ration in the South.
The troops, along with ar
mored personnel carriers, were
placed at major government
buildings and newspaper offices
at midnight but were removed
two hours later.
There was no public explana
tion for the protective forces, but
government officials were
quoted in Seoul as saying that
they had received intelligence
reports suggesting communist
forces intended to take advan
tage of widespread student un
rest to increase infiltration in the
South.
Unaware of evidence
United States military officials
said, however, that they were
unaware of any evidence of a
new infiltration campaign.
The appearance of troops
added to the atmosphere of mys
tery in South Korea, already
tense over repeated campus pro
tests in the past two weeks. The
students have demanded an end
to martial law and criticized the
civ ilian government lor failing to
spell out specifically its plans for
a new constitution and a presi
dential election.
After remaining silent tor two
days, students at Yonsei Univer
sity staged the biggest off
campus demonstration so far late
yesterday. About 2000 Yonsei
students split off from a larger
crowd and charged through a
university gate into the streets,
clashing with riot police, who re
sponded by throwing tear gas
canisters. No army troops were
on the scene.
Confirmed episode
U.S. officials confirmed one
military episode in the de
militarized zone separating the
two countries. They said a Un
ited Nations Command police
patrol Monday evening had a
brief exchange of fire with un
known forces in the butter zone.
No one was injured. A check
early yesterday morning unco
vered only footprints. North Ko
rean authorities protested the
shooting.
American military officials
classified the incident as
"minor" and said they had no
evidence it was related to any
North Korean guerrilla infiltra
tions.
Three and a halt hours after
the shooting, the South Korean
authorities moved small contin
gents ot soldiers and personnel
carriers to major buildings. One
officer told the local press it was
a "training exercise" to perfect
mobilization efforts in the event
of a communist attack.
Intelligence reports
Reporters were told that the
evidence ol North Korean infilt
ration plans stemmed from intel
ligence reports on the known
positions ot certain communist
units. They were told that at least
two brigades believed to be
trained in commando tactics had
disappeared and couldn't be lo
cated by intelligence authorities.
The report allegedly came ini
tially from Japanese sources, the
reporters were told.
U.S. sources in Seoul said they
knew nothing ot the report. In
Tokyo, the Japanese Defense
Agency also disclaimed know
ledge.
There was speculation in
Seoul that the stationing ol
troops at midnight may have

been related to attempts to si
lence demonstrating students.
On Monday, reports circulated
that troops would be sent onto
college campuses. .111 action that
the civ ilian government has tried
to prevent.
Campus demonstrations
During two weeks ol campus
demonstrations, students have
clashed several times with riot
police assigned at campus gates
to prevent the demonstrators
from mov ing out into the streets.
Scores have been injured. The
civilian government's education
minister. Kim Ok-gill. has in
sisted that disciplining of stu
dents he left to college au
thorities.
Last weekend, the troubles
seemed to be settled. The gov
ernment canceled a series of pub
lic hearings on the proposed new
constitution, a gesture to the stu
dents who believe the constitu
tion should be prepared and dis
cussed by the National Assem
bly. not the civ ilian government,
which contains many associates
ol the late President Park Chung
Hee.
The students. 111 return, called
till a major public demonstration
on Seoul's streets and said they
would use only "non-violent,
peaceful" means of expressing
their views.

SEOUL. South Korea
South Korean troops were
stationed at public buildings in
Seoul early yesterday as uncon
firmed rumors spread of a North
Korean attempt to step up infilt
ration in the South.
The troops, along with ar
mored personnel carriers, were
placed at major government
buildings and newspaper offices
at midnight but were removed
two hours later.
There was no public explana
tion for the protective forces, but
government officials were
quoted in Seoul as saying that
they had received intelligence
reports suggesting communist
forces intended to take advan
tage of widespread student un
rest to increase infiltration in the
South.
Unaware of evidence
United States military officials
said, however, that they were
unaware of any evidence of a
new infiltration campaign.
The appearance of troops
added to the atmosphere of mys
tery in South Korea, already
tense over repeated campus pro
tests in the past two weeks. The
students have demanded an end
to martial law and criticized the
civ ilian government lor failing to
spell out specifically its plans for
a new constitution and a presi
dential election.
After remaining silent tor two
days, students at Yonsei Univer
sity staged the biggest off
campus demonstration so far late
yesterday. About 2000 Yonsei
students split off from a larger
crowd and charged through a
university gate into the streets,
clashing with riot police, who re
sponded by throwing tear gas
canisters. No army troops were
on the scene.
Confirmed episode
U.S. officials confirmed one
military episode in the de
militarized zone separating the
two countries. They said a Un
ited Nations Command police
patrol Monday evening had a
brief exchange of fire with un
known forces in the butter zone.
No one was injured. A check
early yesterday morning unco
vered only footprints. North Ko
rean authorities protested the
shooting.
American military officials
classified the incident as
"minor" and said they had no
evidence it was related to any
North Korean guerrilla infiltra
tions.
Three and a halt hours after
the shooting, the South Korean
authorities moved small contin
gents ot soldiers and personnel
carriers to major buildings. One
officer told the local press it was
a "training exercise" to perfect
mobilization efforts in the event
of a communist attack.
Intelligence reports
Reporters were told that the
evidence ol North Korean infilt
ration plans stemmed from intel
ligence reports on the known
positions ot certain communist
units. They were told that at least
two brigades believed to be
trained in commando tactics had
disappeared and couldn't be lo
cated by intelligence authorities.
The report allegedly came ini
tially from Japanese sources, the
reporters were told.
U.S. sources in Seoul said they
knew nothing ot the report. In
Tokyo, the Japanese Defense
Agency also disclaimed know
ledge.

Seoul that the stationing ol
troops at midnight may have

been related to attempts to si
lence demonstrating students.

that troops would be sent onto
college campuses. .111 action that
