# China tots live collectively

BEIJING — Xiaoshi really
didn't want to go to hoarding
school. He sulked and stopped
eating before the term began,
then burst into tears on opening
day. And e\ ery night for the first
month, he cried and begged to go
home.
Tears may have been under
standable. for Xiaoshi — whose
name means "Little Rock" — is
only three \ears old. A robust,
crew-cut little boy with a manly
swagger, he is one of about two
million Chinese toddlers who are
bundled off to boarding nursery
schools so their parents can con
centrate on their jobs.
From now until his seventh
birthday, when he returns home
to go to primary school, Xiaoshi
will see his parents only one day
a week, usually Sundays. Other
wise. the care, feeding and edu
cation of Xiaoshi will be over
seen by Peking Kindergarten
No. 1 .one of the capital's leading
baby boarding schools.
Xiaoshi also will get his first
taste of what the Chinese call
"collective living." and it is in
tended to shape him for life. He
and his classmates will do morn
ing calisthenics together, march
off to outdoor play two by two,
and brush their teeth simultane
ously in a dormitory that resem
bles a miniature military bar
racks, with the sinks scaled to
three-year-old size. Every night
they will go to sleep in 22 identi
cal beds that are lined up head
board to headboard, with a quilt
folded in identical fashion at the
foot of each.
At the Peking No. 1 Kinder
garten, a collection of tile-roofed
buildings that once housed a
Buddhist nunnery, even toilet
training is managed collectively.
After each meal, the youngest
pupils, the two-year-olds, duti
fully sit on a row of enamel pot
ties and perform on cue.
Regimentation
Foreigners here sometimes
wonder whether the regimenta
tion and the separations from
their parents might be
psychologically damaging lor
children so young. But in China.

where the two-career family is
the rule rather than the excep
tion. the only complaint Chinese
parents ever voice about the
boarding nurseries is that there
are not nearly enough of them.
"We have a saying — 'It's
more difficult to get into kinder
garten than to go to university.' "
Sun Yan. directorof the Ministry
of Education's preschool divi
sion. ruefully observed. "We are
building more boarding nurse
ries. but it's impossible to keep
up with the demand."
Only 23 of the SO kindergar
tens the ministry operates in Pek
ing will accept boarding stu
dents. Factories, government
agencies and some communes
also run nurseries for the chil
dren of their workers, but only a
quarter of the nation's 16,000
kindergartens arc open 24 hours
a day.
Connections
Admission to a boarding
school theoretically depends on
the family's need for full-time
childcare. but "backdoor" con
nections or friends in high places
can help. Peking No. 1 Kinder
garten. which is well-equipped
because it also accepts day stu
dents from the city's foreign
community, and the kindergar
ten at Peking University are
especially popular.
Founded in the caves of Yanan
40 years ago, when the be
leaguered Communist Party was
hiding out from Chaing Kai
shek's Nationalist army, the
boarding nurseries were origi
nally intended to free parents for
the revolutionary struggle and
instruct youngsters in com
munism.
But as boarding schools have
proliferated, they have come to
be seen in less ideological terms,
and more as China's solution to
the problems confronting work
ing mothers.
Reduce burden
"We exist primarily to reduce
the overwhelming burden on pa
rents. especially mothers," said
Duyang Man. the grandmotherly
director of Peking No. I Kinder
garten.
The regimentation of board
ing schools, though upsetting to
visitors, does not seem to have

curbed the normal high spirits of
childhood. Games here are loud
and boisterous, though a bit
more organized than in the Un
ited States, and a crying child is a
rare sight.
Childcare here is also a profes
sional calling, so there is little
turnover on the staffs of kinder
gartens. Unlike American pre
schoolers. who may know half a
dozen different babysitters or
caretakers, a Chinese child often
spends three or four years with
the same teacher.
The white-smocked nursery
teacher, always called Aiyi (Au
ntie). looms large in the lives of
small Chinese children. So deep
are the attachments formed that
Sun. the Education Ministry of
ficial. said that her 30-year-old
daughter still attends reunions
with her boarding school Aiyi.
"The teacher is really a second
mother." Sun said. "We see no
thing odd about that."
