# Still a bright spot in the Caribbean
## Bahamian fishing incidents increase 
### Leonard Greenwood The Los Angeles Times 
NASSAU, Bahamas — The
recent sinking of a Bahartiian
patrol boat by Cuban jet fighters
was not the first violence brought
on by a sizzling dispute overfish
ing rights.
Incidents have cropped up
with growing frequency since the
Bahamian government declared
in 1975 that its territorial waters
would extend 200 miles from its
coastline and that commercial
fishing in those waters would be
outlawed.
The law was not strictly en
forced at first. Fishermen from
Florida, the Dominican Repub
lic and Cuba, among other
places, continued to take lobster
and fish from the rich Bahamian
waters.
But 18 months ago, when the
Bahamas took delivery from Bri
tain of two 103-foot patrol boats
— one of them the Flamingo,
sunk Sunday — enforcement
began in earnest. In a single
week last November, the Baha
mian authorities seized 13
foreign fishing boats with crew
men totaling 97 men.
Since then the Bahamas has
had a running problem.
Still, the Bahamas has gener
ally managed to avoid the prob
lems that plague other Caribbean
nations. Tourists flock to the 700
islands in the Bahamas group in
ever-increasing numbers. Bank
ing continues to flourish. The
Bahamas' foreign debt is $200
million, but international ban
kers feel that world confidence in
the little country is such that it
could borrow $200 million five
times over if it wanted to.
Regular elections
There are regular elections for
the British-style Parliament, but
there does not seem to be much
likelihood of change. The gov
ernment of Prime Minister Lyn
don Pindling, after 13 years in
office, appears to be more secure
than ever.
Financially, socially and polit
ically the Bahamas are one of the
Caribbean's few bright spots.
Most of the government's re
venue come", from import duties
and business license fees. The
Bahamas has no income tax, no
profits tax, no capital gains tax
and no estate duties.
The population is estimated at
only 280,000, but the country
has a gross national product cal

culated by the International
Monetary Fund at more than $1
billion — nearly 75 percent of
which is produced by tourism.
Tourists
There are 1.8 million tourists a
year — nearly seven for each in
habitant. and the goal is to in
crease that total to 2 million \ is
itors in 1983.
Unlike most other Caribbean
"islands in the sun," where
tourism is declining, business
here goes up every year. Even
out of season, a visitor some
times must try 10 or 12 hotels
before finding a vacant room.
Construction is booming, with
workmen putting up hotels that
will provide another 1500
rooms. But tourism officials are
not sure that that will be enough,
for the number of tourist flights
and cruise ship visits increases
constantly. Two weeks ago.
Western Airlines began flights to
Nassau, informing customers
that although they are a conti
nent away, the Bahamas are
closer to Los Angeles than Hon
olulu is.
Finance center
Second to tourism as a money
earner for the Bahamas is its
world-famous international fi
nancial center.
Since World War 11. the coun
try's reputation as a tax haven
has attracted scores of banks and
billions of dollars. There are now
300 financial institutions, banks
and trust companies operating
here, involved mainly in offshore
financing, according to a
spokesman for the Bahamas
central bank.
Today, the spokesman said,
the Bahamas rivals London as a
center for transactions involving
Eurodollars — U.S. dollars that
circulate among European banks
and lending institutions. Many
loans involving Eurodollars, he
said, are booked through the
Bahamas to minimize taxation.
Secure and secret
Private hankers who work
with the system say its security
and secrecy are what make it at
tractive. Tough laws prevent
leaks of information and protect
privacy. For example, no bank is.
required to disclose even the
volume of its business.
' Bankers all over the world
know the Bahamas does not di
vulge these figures." a govern
ment spokesman said. "People
employed in these operations are

liable to a fine of up to $15,000
or two years in prison, or, in ex
treme cases, both, for divulging
information about transactions."
A foreign expert in Nassau
calculated that the Bahamas gets
at least $40 million a year from
foreign banks that are allowed to
operate through this country.
Today these financial institu
tions employ 2200 people and
have an annual payroll of more
than $30 million.
No numbers
However, the Bahamas does
not offer the numbered accounts
for which Switzerland is famous.
Bahamian law provides that in
the case of suspected criminal ac
tivity, the Bahamian courts can
order the banks to provide in

formation to the authorities.
The Bahamas, many observers
say, is a country built on private
enterprise, which is a long
standing tradition here.
Centuries ago, the islands
were the base of pirates who
preyed on Spanish treasure gal
leons. Just a few miles outside
Nassau, there is a stone tower
that is believed to have been
built as a lookout post by the En
glish pirate Edward Teach, bet
ter known as Blackbeard.
For more than 250 years the
Bahamas has had its own Parli
ament, first within the British
Empire and later as a member of
the British Commonwealth. It
became a self-governing colony
in 1967 and achieved full inde
pendence in 1973.
