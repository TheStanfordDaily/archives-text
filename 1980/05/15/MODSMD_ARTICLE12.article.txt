# Korean students take to the streets

SEOUL â€” Thousands of
South Korean students took to
the streets in the biggest anti
government demonstrations
here in years yesterday, and
military forces moved in to pro
tect key government buildings.
An estimated 30.000 students
marched through downtown
Seoul, clashing with riot police
and chanting anti-government
slogans in the largest series of
protests since demonstrations
began two weeks ago.
Scores of students were in
jured in the confrontations that
began at noon and continued late
into the evening. Downtown
Seoul was a bedlam much of the
day as riot police repeatedly dis
persed large crowds with salvos
of tear gas. With an increasing
intensity building up the past two
days, the students are demand
ing that the government lift mar
tial law and spell out a specific
timetable to amend the constitu
tion and hold a new presidential
election. They also are demand
ing the immediate ouster of two
prominent officials.
The nearly chaotic scenes in
Seoul yesterday revived specula
tion that South Korean military
forces will intervene, acting
under martial law authority they
have held since President Park
Chung Hee was assassinated last

October. Several hundred troops
from a unit surrounding the capi
tal moved into place last
night around government build
ings. the first time military forces
have been displayed against the
students. They were backed up
by a dozen armored personnel
carriers but had no direct conflict
with the students.
Early Tuesday morning, dur
ing curfew hours, they had sur
rounded several buildings for
two hours in what was described
as a training exercise.
Meanwhile, the civilian gov
ernment again appealed for
order but appeared unprepared
to take any forceful action to
curb the demonstrations. There
were no mass arrests, and the
approximately 300 students
seized by police bv early evening
were quickly released.
Students began demonstrating
two weeks ago but had kept most
of their protests on campus,
marching outside the gates
sporadically to clash with riot
police. But Tuesday night, about
2000 students marched into tlvv
streets, and overnight carefSf
plans were laid for yesterday's
massive demonstrations.
The issues originally were
campus complaints about milit
ary drill, but they have escalated
this week to include broad politi
cal demands.
