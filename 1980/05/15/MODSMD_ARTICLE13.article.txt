# Uganda ends civilian government experiment
## 
### David Lamb The Los Angeles Times 
NAIROBI. Kenya — Uganda's 390-
day experiment in civilian government
has ended, and a six-man military com
mission. the country's fourth government
in 13 months, appears ready to set the
East African nation on a socialistic
course.
The new Ugandan rulers are followers
of Milton Ohote. 56, ousted as president
by Idi Amin in 1971. Obote, who ran a
repressive socialist regime, has lived in
exile in Tanzania for nine years. Tanza
nian President Julius Nyerere. whose
troops drove Amin from power, is intent
on returning Ohote to the Ugandan pres
idency.
Western diplomats here believe the
coup was part of that effort.
Hic military commission issued its first
statement Tuesday, accusing President
Godfrey Binaisa of corruption, tribalism,
greed and indulging in "the politics of
intrigue."
Most diplomatic observers considered
the Binaisa government to be frivolous
and wasteful. While many Ugandans were
having difficulty finding enough to eat.
the ministers stocked their houses with
cases of whiskv, and manv were known to

demand 20 percent off the top of all con
tracts signed with Western businessmen.
The commission, in its broadcast, said
its rule is only temporary, and elections
will he held in which all parties can par
ticipate.
Four men
The four men apparently at the foref
ront of Uganda's new power structure
control all the guns of Uganda's private
armies and Uganda's 5000-man national
army. At least three of the four are politi
cally ambitious, committed Marxists or
socialists, and loyal to Obote and Nye
rere. The three were demoted by Binaisa
during his 1 1 months as president.
They are:
— Brig. Gen. David Oyite Ojok. 40. the
army chief of staff, whom Amin once said
was the "only man besides God" he
feared. Ojok, a distant cousin of Obote,
was relieved of his command last Satur
day and appointed ambassador to
Algeria. His refusal to accept the demo
tion precipitated the present crisis.
— Paulo Muwanga, Obote's former am
bassador to Egypt and France, widely re
puted to be Nyerere's man in the interim
Ugandan government. As Binaisa's
minister of the interior, he did not hesitate
to use his powers to jail dozens of dissi

dents, including Uganda's most promi
nent journalists. When Binaisa demoted
him to the largely ceremonial post of am
bassador to the United Nations in
Geneva. Nyerere intervened to stop the
transfer, and Muwanga was given a minor
ministerial post.
— Yoweri Museveni, a Marxist who first
served Binaisa as defense minister. He
controls a private tribal army of about
7000 men and had played a key role in
previous attempts to oust Binaisa through
legal channels. Binaisa took over the de
fense portfolio last December, and Muse
veni refused to accept his demotion to the
minor post of minister for regional coop
eration. He later relented.
The fourth new leader is Col. Tito
Okello, 61, a member of the Acholi tribe,
which was purged by Amin. The com
mander of the Ugandan army. Okello is
the least ideological of the four and com
mands respect among the rank and file in
the new Ugandan army, which was hastily
trained by Tanzanian officers.
House arrest
Binaisa reportedly is still under house
arrest at State House in Entebbe, 21 miles
from Kampala, guarded by Tanzanian
soldiers. Eleven months ago, the Tanza
nian president personally ordered the re
moval of Binaisa's predecessor, Yusufu

Lulu, 67.
Authorities here give Binaisa little
chance of mounting a coutercoup, he
cause he controls'no guns and has no
power base.
Binaisa, like Lule before him, appa
rently was toppled because he tried to be
his own man. Both presidents rejected
Nyerere's demands that Obote be given a
prominent position in their governments,
and both defied the leftist elements in
their Cabinet by favoring a pro-Western
political stance and a mixed economy.
Lule, who now lives in London but has
said he plans to return to Uganda to run
for president, lasted only 68 days in office.
Diplomatic observers note that Nye
rere has a big stake in Uganda: It was his
soldiers who overthrew Amin in April
1979, in a war that cost impoverished
Tanzania $500 million. To lose Uganda
now would cost Nyerere personal prestige
in his dream for a community of socialist
nations in East Africa.
If Obote does regain power, he would
have to do so in an election in order to
gain international legitimacy. Many ob
servers believe Obote is capable of meet
ing the challenge — it the Ugandan milit
ary leaders do not find their own new
found power too appealing.

minister of the interior, he did not hesitate
to use his powers to jail dozens of dissi

him to the largely ceremonial post of am

— Yoweri Museveni, a Marxist who first
served Binaisa as defense minister. He
controls a private tribal army of about
7000 men and had played a key role in
previous attempts to oust Binaisa through
legal channels. Binaisa took over the de
fense portfolio last December, and Muse
veni refused to accept his demotion to the
minor post of minister for regional coop
eration. He later relented.
The fourth new leader is Col. Tito
Okello, 61, a member of the Acholi tribe,
which was purged by Amin. The com
mander of the Ugandan army. Okello is
the least ideological of the four and com
mands respect among the rank and file in
the new Ugandan army, which was hastily
trained by Tanzanian officers.
House arrest
Binaisa reportedly is still under house
arrest at State House in Entebbe, 21 miles
from Kampala, guarded by Tanzanian
soldiers. Eleven months ago, the Tanza
nian president personally ordered the re
moval of Binaisa's predecessor, Yusufu

Lulu, 67.
Authorities here give Binaisa little
chance of mounting a coutercoup, he
cause he controls'no guns and has no
power base.
Binaisa, like Lule before him, appa
rently was toppled because he tried to be
his own man. Both presidents rejected
Nyerere's demands that Obote be given a
prominent position in their governments,
and both defied the leftist elements in
their Cabinet by favoring a pro-Western
political stance and a mixed economy.
Lule, who now lives in London but has
said he plans to return to Uganda to run
for president, lasted only 68 days in office.
Diplomatic observers note that Nye
rere has a big stake in Uganda: It was his
soldiers who overthrew Amin in April
1979, in a war that cost impoverished
Tanzania $500 million. To lose Uganda
now would cost Nyerere personal prestige
in his dream for a community of socialist
nations in East Africa.
If Obote does regain power, he would
have to do so in an election in order to
gain international legitimacy. Many ob
servers believe Obote is capable of meet
ing the challenge — it the Ugandan milit
ary leaders do not find their own new
found power too appealing.
NAIROBI. Kenya — Uganda's 390-
day experiment in civilian government
has ended, and a six-man military com
mission. the country's fourth government
in 13 months, appears ready to set the
East African nation on a socialistic
course.
The new Ugandan rulers are followers
of Milton Ohote. 56, ousted as president
by Idi Amin in 1971. Obote, who ran a
repressive socialist regime, has lived in
exile in Tanzania for nine years. Tanza
nian President Julius Nyerere. whose
troops drove Amin from power, is intent
on returning Ohote to the Ugandan pres
idency.
Western diplomats here believe the
coup was part of that effort.
Hic military commission issued its first
statement Tuesday, accusing President
Godfrey Binaisa of corruption, tribalism,
greed and indulging in "the politics of
intrigue."
Most diplomatic observers considered
the Binaisa government to be frivolous
and wasteful. While many Ugandans were
having difficulty finding enough to eat.
the ministers stocked their houses with
cases of whiskv, and manv were known to

demand 20 percent off the top of all con
tracts signed with Western businessmen.
The commission, in its broadcast, said
its rule is only temporary, and elections
will he held in which all parties can par
ticipate.
Four men
The four men apparently at the foref
ront of Uganda's new power structure
control all the guns of Uganda's private
armies and Uganda's 5000-man national
army. At least three of the four are politi
cally ambitious, committed Marxists or
socialists, and loyal to Obote and Nye
rere. The three were demoted by Binaisa
during his 1 1 months as president.
They are:
— Brig. Gen. David Oyite Ojok. 40. the
army chief of staff, whom Amin once said
was the "only man besides God" he
feared. Ojok, a distant cousin of Obote,
was relieved of his command last Satur
day and appointed ambassador to
Algeria. His refusal to accept the demo
tion precipitated the present crisis.
— Paulo Muwanga, Obote's former am
bassador to Egypt and France, widely re
puted to be Nyerere's man in the interim
Ugandan government. As Binaisa's
minister of the interior, he did not hesitate
to use his powers to jail dozens of dissi

dents, including Uganda's most promi
