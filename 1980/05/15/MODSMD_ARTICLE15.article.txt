# Attend Stanford's Quebec film series
## Canadian photographers display works in San Francisco 
### Mary Haber Staff Writer 
When Pierre-Paul Tremblay
was very young he was given an
instamatic camera for his birth
day. He took pictures at all the
family parties.
By the time he was 17 he had
traded in his first camera for a 35
mm.
By the time he was 20 he had
won two first-place prizes and
one second-place in the 1968
College Du Mont St-Louis com
petition.
Eight years later he won first
and third prizes in the First Fes
tival of the Image at Complexe
Des Jardins.

Several years ago Ronald
Maisonneuve, another Canadian
photographer, got in contact
with Tremblay because he was
impressed by one of Tremblay's
shows in a Quebec gallery. Now
the two are in the Bay area,
showing their works at the Signs
and Symbols Gallery in San
Francisco through June I. Both
were present at the opening of
the Quebec film series here last
week.
The men say they view photo
graphy as an art — an idea, ac
cording to Maisonneuve, that is
just starting in Quebec. But their
views differ as to where this
"art" comes from."The essence
comes from the framing,"
Tremblay says, while Maison
neuve believes that for him. "a
good part of the photograph is
done in the mind."

Maisonneuve also remarked.
"I try to be the most intimate I
can. That's why my pictures are
so close."
Ma'sonneuve's most recent
works have been close-ups ol
faces with oil pastels applied di
rectly onto the print.
"Many people come up to me
and say, 'It's a really good por
trait. but why did you put the
color between me and the sub

ject'.'' 1 try not to do a documen
tary ; I'm interested in the subject
itself. That's why I put the color
on manually — to really work on
it as an object to distinguish it
from the concept."

Maisonneuve's interference
on the surface is a contrast to
Tremblav's interference with the
image. I'remblav's most recent
work has been with sequences.

He makes a series of three photo
graphs. one following another.
"It's extremely personal," he
said. "1 create these sequences."
Tremblay's subjects are his
friends. "They're not comedians
or actors. They have potential:
the> understand what I really
want. We get together and go
through a sequence and nice
things happen." he commented.

Muisonneuvo feels differently.
"I can't explain the kind of mo
ment I'm looking tor." he said.
It's much easier with people I
don't know or have just met. It
happens in the tirst five minutes
of the meeting in the street."
I le added. ' I'm looking for an
honesty, a frankness. It looks
like it's easier with people when I
don't know them."


"Sur lc boulevard Langelier," a 1979 portrait by Ronald
Maisonneuvc, is another photo on display in San Francisco. "I
try not to do a documentary; I'm interested in the subject," he
said recently.
