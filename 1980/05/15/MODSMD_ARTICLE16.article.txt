# THE

## Jeff Rhodie 'Cruel hoax unforgivable 
### 
A crucl and outrageous "joke" was played on
the 15,000-circulation Stanford Daily newspaper
on May 2.
After Stanford Daily Hditor Bill Burger had
taken page pasteups to the printer, pranksters
managed to substitute a photo and caption falsely
announcing that the I'niversity's bowling team had
been killed in a plane crash, the San Francisco
Chronicle reported. This "joke" appeared on the
front page of The Stanford Daily, triggering reac
tions of shock and grief.
But shock and grief ne\ er had to occur, because,
in fact, "bowling team members were alive and
well on campus and apparently unaware of the
hoax until copies of the paper were distributed to
campus vending boxes." the Chronicle reported.
The suspects in the prank, according to the
Chronicle, were members of the Chaparral, a cam
pus humor magazine that has a rivalry with The
Stanford Daily. It the Chaparral's humor reflects
the "joke" that appeared in the Daily, the Chapar
ral must be a real riot to read.
The photo that appeared in the Daily showed
seven young men wearing bowling team T-slnrts
and holding bow ling balls and trophies. Burger said
that all seven had been identified as members ot
the Chuparral. The pranksters, to really be hilari
ous. had the caption read, "Tragedy strikes bowl
ing team." This must have had people rolling
around on the floor in laughter.
Telling one person about a tragedy that didn't

happen to be just "tunny ' is a pretty dumb thing to
do. But to sneak it into someone else's newspaper,
where people expect to find facts, is unforgivable.
The editor of the humor magazine. Jay Martel.
denied participation in the hoax, but said he \ iewed
it as in the tradition of the magazine, the Chronicle
reported. Some tradition.
Just think how many people picked up the news
paper and thought schoolmates and maybe even
friends had died. There is enough tragedy in our
world. We don't need someone to invent more.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs, said those
w ho caused the hoax face the possibility of discipli
nary action after school officials complete an inves
tigation, the Chronicle reported.
What makes tins situation most upsetting is that
those who did cause the hoax are members of the
campus humor magazine, meaning they are jour
nalists. who are supposed to be responsible. Just
think about how many "responsible" people took
part in this act and about all the time they spent
executing it.
Disciplinary action should definitely be taken
against these pranksters — some kind of action that
will teach them that the media is no place for a
prank — especially one announcing a tragedy that
didn't happen and sneaking it into someone else's
publication. If these people are "journalists." let's
take away their pens.

Daily, San Jose State University's student news
paper.)
