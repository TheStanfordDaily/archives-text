# Wade French
## Speaker denies gay accusation 
### 
John Mason, in his column of May 7.
stated that a "group" of gay people who had
come to his dorm to give a presentation had
said that "virtually everyone was homosex
ual." As one of the two speakers at that
e\ent. I vociferously deny that anyone said
anything near that.
I volunteered to organize the speaking en
gagement at the French house last year, the
engagement Mason referred to in his article,
because 1 lived next door in Haus Mit
teleuropa. I thought that by having a joint
speaking engagement with the Haus. where I
was open about my being gay. 1 could com
pare the attitudes in the Haus to those in the
French House.
These speaking engagements, which are
sponsored by the Gay Counseling Group at
the Bridge, are preceded by questionnaires
on the residents' views on homosexuality.
Hie questionnaires, which tend to focus the
residents on some of the issues surrounding
gay people on campus, took a large amount
of my time because of my interest in compar
ing the two houses. It is due to this extra
commitment on my part to this particular
talk that 1 remember so clearly what hap
pened at this speaking engagement.
Shelia O'Rourke, a lesbian friend who I

had invited to join me, and I began the talk
by discussing our personal life experiences,
highlighting those things we felt were impor
tant to our being gay. The audience was sur
prised at how differently Shelia and I viewed
our homosexuality.
It was during this interchange that Mason
finally spoke up. He insisted that we explain
what appeared to him to be clearly contradic
tory \ lews on our part. We re-explained that
we were speaking about what we, as indi
\ iduals, saw as contributing to our being gay.
We went on to say that we, as well as many
professionals, feel that sexual preference is
too complex to presume that there is but one
way in which it is formed.
I believe Mason had trouble dealing with
this reply because he appears to want to deal
with gays as a group, with set behaviors and
thoughts, and doesn't wish to deal with us as
individuals. I think that this attitude came
through in his recent column, and 1 definitely
got that feeling from him at the speaking
engagement last year.
Eventually someone quieted Mason down,
and we were able to go on to other questions,
like the Kinsey scale and what it's like to be
closeted on campus. We ended the talk by

going over the responses to the question
naire, and the differences between the two
houses' answers. Again, I repeat that at no
time did either of the speakers make the
ridiculous statement he attributes to us.
In the same column. Mason goes on to say
that we put the house members on the defen
sive and that this is the reason why "nobody
was interested in getting to know them (the
gay speakers) personally." What he didn't
know was that after he had left, I was offered
and accepted an invitation to stay for dinner.
I enjoyed the more informal and personal
talk that followed, and during that dinner
people at mv table apologized for his be
havior at the meeting.
I have not addressed the other points that
Mason raised in his column, since 1 felt that
the public could recognize this selective quot
ing process by which he made those points,
but 1 felt obligated to set the record straight
(if you'll pardon the pun) concerning the
speaking engagement at the French House.
If I didn't, the actual events wouldn't be
known.
