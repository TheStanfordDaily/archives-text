Save Jack's clown
ITie conglomerate that owns
Jack-in-the-Box has decided
that Jack is no longer suited to its
enterprise. It has callously de
clared open season on all clowns.
Witness its recent barrage of
radio and television advertising
depicting the brutal demolition
of a sacrificial Jack. This sense
less elimination of a part of
American culture distinct to the
'o()s and '70s should not bclett to
corporate whim.
I low many times have you said
"We're heading for Jack's"? Can
you imagine going on a
"box' run? And who will greet
you when you drive up to place
your order? Not the cheerful
Jack we all know and love. Im
agine the sense of fear and alie
nation when you're faced with an
empty box.
Where has American society
gone when we can tacitly ap
prove the irrational destruction
of plastic clowns through brutish
passivity? How can a society that
practices the systematic demoli

tion of innocent clowns credibly
pursue a policy of world peace
and human rights? Will we be
able to look the Russians in the
eye at the bargaining table when
we arc carrying out this program
at home? We ponder whether
this militaristic liquidation of
clowns is just another ploy to
sublimate our frustrations over
recent foreign policy failures.
Wc must unite to save Jack.
You can rally to the defense of
this cherished bit of Americana
by coming to our organizational
meeting, to be announced in
OATQ. In addition, show your
displeasure the next time you go
to Jack's.
T ell the 16-year-old girl at the
counter that she and the corpo
rate establishment behind her
have reneged on their duties as
American citizens to preserve
and promote this keystone of
contemporary American cul
ture. Let this adolescent puppet
of Ralston Purina know that you
are holding her personally re
sponsible for social disaffection
caused by eroding this national

tradition and that such behavior
shall not escape social censor
ship. Demonstrate your outrage
by the symbolic act of holding up
your"fring," breakingit intotwo
equal pieces and flinging them at
the base of her drive-up win
dow. Remind her that every
blown up Jack is just another
martyr for our cause.

Gay Week purpose
I have just read John Mason's
impressions of Ciay Awareness
Week in his Daily column of May
7 and I am somewhat disap
pointed that his lasting experi
ence of the week was one of gay

people "pointing the finger" at
the non-gay community for not
only the evils that plague gays
but also the society at large.
While it is true that there are
gay people who play "victim" to
the non-gay community, I don't
feel that this was the purpose of
the week. I don't mean to invali
date his experience of the week,
rather I would suggest that he
consider why he feels he has
been accused or "victimized" by
the gay community.
From his column, I gather that
it was San Francisco Supervisor
Harry Britt's speech that was
particularly "accusing" of the
non-gay community. It is true
that Britt's arguments lead to
imagery that may seem "ludicr
ous" when taken out of context,
but the major focus of his speech
was a challenge to people of all
sexuality to examine the sexist/
genderist society we perpetuate
and consider the possibility that
many of society's ills spring from
it.
Quite naturally this message is

confronting, yet to interpret this
message as "accusing" involved
a personal admission by the lis
tener that not only is he a
member of the perpetuating
group, hut also that he and the
system are "bad and wrong."
1 would suggest that Britt was
merely observing that the system
is unworkable and that alterna
tives are possible if we have the
courage. The truth is that I, a
member of the gay community,
unconsciously perpetuate the
system, and Britt*s speech as
sisted me in seeing this.
As a final comment, I would
like to say that the focus of Gay
Awareness Week was and is the
valuable contributions of gay
people to the world. This was
exemplified by the concert of the
San Francisco Gay Men's
Chorus. Such a display of fun and
aliveness cannot be overlooked.
