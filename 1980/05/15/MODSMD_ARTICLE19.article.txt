# Familiar isn't best; opt for change
## 
### 
The old, wizened codger and
the bright-eyed, naive youth are
fleeing from the police. The old
fellow has been in prison before
— plenty of times to satisfy his
curiosity about such an experi
ence. The young man is facing
the prospect of ending up in
prison for the first time. He pon
ders, out loud:
"Perhaps it would be good for
me."
"What would?" asks the old
man.
"Prison," says he.
"My God." the old veteran
exclaims, "you ought to be a loaf
of bread sitting in the middle of
the street waiting for the steam
roller to expand your soul. Come
on."
When 1 read this from a novel
for one of my classes, 1 knew I
felt a kindred spirit with one of
the characters in the book. The
problem is. I can't figure out
which one.
In general. I tend to think like
the young man. I convince my
self that anything can be a valu
able and interesting experience,
that no place can be bad or bor
ing. as long as 1 give it a try.
Something happened to me
last week that really put this pro
cess of mental persuasion into
high gear. I had been contacted
the week before by a potential
employer and had been told that
they definitely had a job for me
this summer. They had only to
decide in what city I would be
placed.

Well, last week I was placed,
and the job isn't in San Francisco
or Los Angeles. No, not even
New York or Washington, D.C..
No. not even Chicago, Boston or
Dallas. Try Des Moines, lowa.
Well, . . ye* ... I did tell them
that 1 was willing to work where
ver they assigned me. And no, I
don't really have anything
specific against Des Moines. In
fact, 1 really like corn-on-the
cob.
It's just funny when all of a
sudden, all the best theories of
my youthful idealism come up
against the old codger in me, who
says in effect, "You're crazy!" 1
begin to feel like that loaf of
bread, looking for anything that
will "expand my soul." It's easy
to wonder: What are these things
1 do, anyway, in the name of ex
perience and broadening my
horizons?
After all, there is absolutely no
doubt in my mind that 1 have it
very good here in the Bay area,
— great weather, in general;
endless recreation; abundant
culture; and best of all, many
good friendships. I also know for
a fact that I will roast and wilt
like an old tomato in the heat and
humidity of the Midwest. My re
creation will probably consist of
chasing cows and counting mos
quito bites.
As for culture, 1 hear the lowa
State Fair is a real riot. And as
for friends. 1 won't know a single
soul.
So what's the point? Why give
up what I know is the best for
what 1 know may very well be the
worst?

I guess first it might be wise to
look at that last assumption.
How do I know that this area, or
California in general, is the best?
Well. . . it's the best because I've
lived here all my life.
What? Did I hear someone
mutter, under his breath, "dumb
provincial Californian"?
It's probably true. Eighteen
years in Southern California,
three years in Northern. Maybe
my horizons do need to be
broadened if I'm hardly willing
to see the different parts of my

own country.
But 1 think it goes further than
being willing to go to strange new
lands in the search of yet another
"experience." The best thing
about going to Des Moines will
be the practical application of
not being tied down to my par
ticular environment, my own
cozy homeland. I'll be learning a
little bit about what it means to
be a pilgrim. And that has to be
good.
Why? Because 1 need to see
exactly what is the foundation of
my sense of security and well
being. 1 think we all have things

that lend a sense of security: a
safe job, a steady girlfriend or
boyfriend, or a familiar geog
raphic location. But if our sec
urity is based solely on such
things, we are trapped. We don't
have a deeper sense of security
that will enable us to move away
from these things when we see an
opportunity to grow into some
thing better.
My small step toward Des
Moines will help me in the future
to avoid falling into the rut of
always opting for security, at the

expense of growth and change.
This change may not be the
best (I may die of heat stroke!).
But this way I'll know for sure.
Otherwise 1 could only speculate
about what might have hap
pened if 1 had only tried.
It amounts to not being limited
in my choices to only things with
which I am already familiar; be
cause what's familiar isn't neces
sarily good for us, and what's
comfortable is rarely best.
