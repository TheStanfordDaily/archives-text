# Senate to review course list
## 
### Lisa Adler Staff Writer 
A list of about 300 courses that the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
has found acceptable for fulfilling the
revised distribution requirements will
be presented to the Faculty Senate to
day.
The committee's list of courses is
significantly reduced from the 2000
courses which were used to fulfill the
old requirements.
History Prof. Carolyn Lougee, head
of CUS, called the review of the dis
tribution requirements a "very
thorough process." Lougee added she
believes the senate will approve the
CUS recommendations.
CUS student member John Mason
said a two-step process was involv ed in
the distribution requirement changes.
First, seven specific categories were
created to replace the three broad
categories of humanities, social sci
ences and math and science. The Fa
culty Senate approved those changes in
January. More recently, CUS has
evaluated courses to determine which
will satisfy requirements under the new
sy stem.

Under the revised requirements, be
sides taking Western Culture, students
will be required to take at least one
course in seven areas: literature and
the fine arts; philosophy, social and re
ligious thought; human development,
behavior and language; social proces
ses and institutions; mathematical sci
ences. natural sciences and technology
and applied sciences.
On behalf of CUS, Lougee will also
present to the senate a proposal to
allow transfer students to adhere to the
old distribution requirements system
for two more years.
Mason said that students had sig
nificant input into the process of de
termining the acceptable courses to
satisfy the revised requirements;
However, Mason said that, "em
phasis was not placed on evaluating the
quality of teaching — course content
was examined based only on syllabi."
Lougee said a number of committees
have worked on the evaluation process
since mid-February. Some 85 people,
76 of whom were professors, served on
the panels.
Forms were sent to departments ask
ing for information on courses, syllabi

and student evaluations.
Faculty members served in different
positions. Registrar Sally Mahoney
acted as a resource person to trace pat
terns of student enrollment in classes.
"This information on enrollment
was given to the committees to
evaluate interest. We looked at the past
to try to plan for the future." Mahoney
said.
