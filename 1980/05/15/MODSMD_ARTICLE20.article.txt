## Debate state water issues 
### 
There is considerable con
troversy over the fate of Califor
nia's water. Water use is a multi
faceted problem; its cost-benefit
economics must balance the
water requirements of farmers,
urban areas, hydroelectric pro
duction, recreational users, fish
and wildlife. Thus water policy is
enshrouded by statistics and em
broiled in bureaucratic politics.
In this column, I would like
briefly to describe the four most
prominent water issues that face
Californians today. Two of these
issues are debates over how best
to use presently existing
facilities: the Mono Lake Diver
sions and the New Melones
Dam. The other two, the
Peripheral Canal and the dam
ming of the Tuolumne River, are
proposed projects whose pro
jected impacts are contested.
Nested in the eastern Sierras,
Mono Lake is a small, unique
ecology. Only brine shrimp and
other salt-water organisms can
live in the salty environment of
the lake. Yet millions of birds,
many of them migrating over
large distances, visit or nest on an
island in Mono Lake each year.
Due to diversions of source
water to the city of Los Angeles,
15,000 acres of the lake have
been transformed to dry alkali
dust, harmful to both the lake
and surrounding communities.
Mono Lake is now dropping two
vertical feet per year, and the
fragile habitat of the lake may be
destroyed if water diversion con
tinues.
The New Melones Dam on the
Stanislaus River was originally
designed to hold 450,000 acre
feet of water at a cost of $6.2
million. Almost 40 years later,
after several rounds of bureauc
ratic inflation, a dam that could
hold four times the amount of
water was built at a taxpayer cost
of $376 million.
The San Francisco Hearst
newspapers, the California State
Assembly and Pacific Gas &
Electric argue that the money
spent should not be wasted, and

that the reservoir behind this
mammoth dam should be filled
to the brim. However, operation
of the hydroelectric plant would
cost $385 million, and tax sub
sidies of $571 million would be
needed to sell the irrigation wa
ter. The State Water Resources
Control Board and several
California congressmen have
proposed a compromise: a mod
est reservoir that would fulfill all
of the functions for which the
dam was designed, while con
serving the natural, cultural and
recreational diversity of the
Upper Stanislaus Canyon.
This issue will be settled in the
next few months as the web of
state and federal legislation, and
court rulings is untangled.
The Peripheral Canal is a
complex engineering feat de
signed to divert waters from the
Sacramento River to Kern
County and Southern California.
At best, the plan seems ill
considered, since the effects on
both the Sacramento River
Delta and the San Francisco Bay
are undetermined and poten
tially disastrous. At worst, the
plan is a classic example of un
warranted "pork barrel" legisla
tion because the need for the di
verted water has not been de
monstrated.
The Tuolumne River is born
of glaciers that cling to the sides
of Yosemite's peaks. After
meandering through alpine
meadows, it courses through a
steep canyon, creating a stretch
of white water that is unparal
leled in magnificence. This
mighty river is already restrained

by five dams. John Muir likened
them to "water tanks" created
by flooding "the people's
cathedrals and churches."
The San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission and the
Modesto and Turlock irrigation
districts wish to shackle the
Tuolumne with three more
dams. They are opposing the re
commendation of four U.S. gov
ernment agencies to add the re
maining free-flowing portions of
the Tuolumne to the national
"wild and scenic river" system.
By overtaxing the capacity of the
Tuolumne River, the dam buil
ders would not only irrevocably
destroy a rare wild river envi
ronment. but they also may en
danger the water quality of the
entire San Joaquin River valley.
With 1200 dams and a 233-
mile-long aqueduct already in
existence, it is tragic that
Californians would consider de
stroying several of these rare
natural water environments. On
the other hand, we all feel the
need for adequate water and
energy supplies, supplies that
will become even more scarce in
the next decade. Yet an alterna
tive source exists that we tend to
ignore: conservation.
Modest water conservation ef
forts could result in savings equal
to the output of all four of the
above-mentioned projects. We
should convince our representa
tives and the managers of our
water resources that such efforts
can and should be made. A con
scientious commitment by all of
us is required to preserve our en
vironmental heritage.

sidies of $571 million would be
needed to sell the irrigation wa
ter. The State Water Resources
Control Board and several
California congressmen have
proposed a compromise: a mod
est reservoir that would fulfill all
of the functions for which the
dam was designed, while con
serving the natural, cultural and
recreational diversity of the
Upper Stanislaus Canyon.
This issue will be settled in the
next few months as the web of
state and federal legislation, and
court rulings is untangled.
The Peripheral Canal is a
complex engineering feat de
signed to divert waters from the
Sacramento River to Kern
County and Southern California.
At best, the plan seems ill
considered, since the effects on
both the Sacramento River
Delta and the San Francisco Bay
are undetermined and poten
tially disastrous. At worst, the
plan is a classic example of un
warranted "pork barrel" legisla
tion because the need for the di
verted water has not been de
monstrated.
The Tuolumne River is born
of glaciers that cling to the sides
of Yosemite's peaks. After
meandering through alpine
meadows, it courses through a
steep canyon, creating a stretch
of white water that is unparal
leled in magnificence. This
mighty river is already restrained

by five dams. John Muir likened
them to "water tanks" created
by flooding "the people's
cathedrals and churches."
The San Francisco Public
Utilities Commission and the
Modesto and Turlock irrigation
districts wish to shackle the
Tuolumne with three more
dams. They are opposing the re
commendation of four U.S. gov
ernment agencies to add the re
maining free-flowing portions of
the Tuolumne to the national
"wild and scenic river" system.
By overtaxing the capacity of the
Tuolumne River, the dam buil
ders would not only irrevocably
destroy a rare wild river envi
ronment. but they also may en
danger the water quality of the
entire San Joaquin River valley.
With 1200 dams and a 233-
mile-long aqueduct already in
existence, it is tragic that
Californians would consider de
stroying several of these rare
natural water environments. On
the other hand, we all feel the
need for adequate water and
energy supplies, supplies that
will become even more scarce in
the next decade. Yet an alterna
tive source exists that we tend to
ignore: conservation.
Modest water conservation ef
forts could result in savings equal
to the output of all four of the
above-mentioned projects. We
should convince our representa
tives and the managers of our
water resources that such efforts
can and should be made. A con
scientious commitment by all of
us is required to preserve our en
vironmental heritage.

There is considerable con
troversy over the fate of Califor
nia's water. Water use is a multi
faceted problem; its cost-benefit
economics must balance the
water requirements of farmers,
urban areas, hydroelectric pro
duction, recreational users, fish
and wildlife. Thus water policy is
enshrouded by statistics and em
broiled in bureaucratic politics.
In this column, I would like
briefly to describe the four most
prominent water issues that face
Californians today. Two of these
issues are debates over how best
to use presently existing
facilities: the Mono Lake Diver
sions and the New Melones
Dam. The other two, the
Peripheral Canal and the dam
ming of the Tuolumne River, are
proposed projects whose pro
jected impacts are contested.
Nested in the eastern Sierras,
Mono Lake is a small, unique
ecology. Only brine shrimp and
other salt-water organisms can
live in the salty environment of
the lake. Yet millions of birds,
many of them migrating over
large distances, visit or nest on an
island in Mono Lake each year.
Due to diversions of source
water to the city of Los Angeles,
15,000 acres of the lake have
been transformed to dry alkali
dust, harmful to both the lake
and surrounding communities.
Mono Lake is now dropping two
vertical feet per year, and the
fragile habitat of the lake may be
destroyed if water diversion con
tinues.
The New Melones Dam on the
Stanislaus River was originally
designed to hold 450,000 acre
feet of water at a cost of $6.2
million. Almost 40 years later,
after several rounds of bureauc
ratic inflation, a dam that could
hold four times the amount of
water was built at a taxpayer cost
of $376 million.
The San Francisco Hearst
newspapers, the California State
Assembly and Pacific Gas &
Electric argue that the money
spent should not be wasted, and

that the reservoir behind this
mammoth dam should be filled
to the brim. However, operation
of the hydroelectric plant would
cost $385 million, and tax sub
sidies of $571 million would be
needed to sell the irrigation wa
ter. The State Water Resources
Control Board and several
California congressmen have
