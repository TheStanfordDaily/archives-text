## "Poor Murderer:" behind the scenes 
### 
"Poor Murderer," currently
being produced by the Drama
Department, provides a rare
glimpse at contemporary East
European theatre.
Author Pavel Kohout was
born in 192N in Prague and
started as a poet and playwright
in the 50 s, in Stalinist Czechos
lovakia. He followed the Party
line for a time but turned into
one of its toughest critics, espec
cially since the invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 196K by the
Soviet Union.
Theater in Eastern Europe is a
much more politicised medium
than in the United States. In a
country where the press is si
lenced it is one of the few means
■ >l expressing social dissatisfac
tion. Of course, the message has
to be subtle, and the audience is
obliged to read between the
lines. "Poor Murderer" is just
such a play.
The play is set in St.
Petersburg at the turn of the cen
tury. It takes place in a psychiat
ric clinic and portrays the efforts
of ne of its famous patients, an
act. >r. Kerzhentsev, to prove that
he is sane and therefore capable
of standing trial for murder.
Kerzhentsev is convinced that
he actually murdered Polonius
when lie was playing Hamlet and
so he stages a performance of
"Hamlet" in the asylum to help
him unravel the truth. Thus, a
play within a play.
l ayers of reality are stripped
away and the audience is left to
decide for itself the meaning of

the actor's cry, "Have 1 pre
tended insanity to get away with
murder or did 1 commit murder
because 1 am insane?" Kohout
wrote some comments on the
play which appeared in a New
York Times article in October
1976, at the time of the play's
American premiere on Broad
way.
The play is based on a story by
Leonid Andreev, a 19th century
Russian author. What did Koh
out find so fascinating in this
"old, non-political storv," as he
calls it?
"Perhaps it was the fact that
from my window I could see the
flag waving over the presidential
citadel bearing the inscription
'The truth is victorious. 1
"I have noticed that actually
the truth is rarely victorious and
that her rare victories do not last
too long.
"Evil wins out much more of
ten, especially if it is cold
blooded, pitiless and absolutely
rationally committed."
The play works on many diffe
rent levels, according to David
McCandless, the director of the
Drama Department's produc
tion.
"One of the fundamental
questions in the play is whether
Kerzhentsev is telling the truth
or lying, whether he is mad or
not. What is truth tellinganyway,
and how does theater fit into
that? Can you through pretense
tell the truth?" This level opens
itself up to theatricality, accord
ing to McCandless. "There is a

fascinating literary base with
constant parallels between Ker
zhentsev and Hamlet's feigning
madness."
There is a psychological ele
ment to the play. The early
scenes of the play within the play
deal with Kerzhentsev's child
hood and his early sexual experi
ences. "There is the Oedipal
rivalry between him and his
father that date to the time K.er
zhentsev finds his father in a
compromising position with the
maid."
There is also the personal
level, which McCandless thinks is
perhaps the most important.
"Kerzhentsev is someone with a
disassociated sensibility. He is a
fragmented and quintissentially
modern man. He has trouble in
tegrating his thoughts and his
feel inns.
"The play demonstrates," said
McCandless, "that the East

European theatre is underrated.
It illustrates the richness and
turbulence which you don't see
in British or American drama.
The source of the greatest an
guish is also the source of their
strength. It is because they are so
persecuted and live such a dualis
tic life that gives them a rich
literary outlook."
The international cast, which
is made up mostly of graduate
students, includes Fritz Brun as
Kcrzhentsev (a professional
actor in Denmark for 20 years).
Miriam Yahil-Wax (who has
acted in Israel) as Tatyana, Jim
Carmody as Professor Dr/.hem
bitsky. and Brent Shaphen as
Savelyov.
The play, which opened yes
terday, runs through the 17th of
May and then again May 21-24.
Tickets can be purchased at the
Tresidder ticket office.
