# Bluegrass Festival
## Pickin' and sittin' and grinnin' 
### 
Doc Watsofi, dean of all
bluegrass musicians summed
things up for the eight or nine
thousand fans who were on hand
last Sunday for the second after
noon of the Bluegrass Festival in
Frost Amphitheatre.
"If y'all are waiting for a for
mal set," he drawled, "you're
gonna be disappointed. We
come here "cause we just like
pickin' and sittin' and grinnin."
Enjoyment was indeed the
key. Bluegrass is nearly always
happy, lively music, but the
group of musicians assembled
for the two-day concert at Stan
ford had such a good time,
played with so much energy and
such obvious pleasure, that the
crowd responded as much to

their sittin' and grinnin' as to
their pickin'.
On Saturday, the sun came
out, and after a long, slow warm
up by John McC'uen (formerly
of the "Nitty Gritty Dirt Band"),
the David Cirisman Quintet took
the stage and got things rolling.
Cirisman, a quiet, serious mando
lin player, subtly transforms
bluegrass into a sound pitched
midway between the improvisa
tional splendors of jazz and the
studied formalism of classical
chamber music. His records are a
good introduction to bluegrass
for people who think it all sounds
like the same square-dance song
played over and over again.
The Earl Scruggs Review fol
lowed Grisman on stage and
showed one of the problems
bluegrass music is having these
days. For decades, bluegrass pic
kers have tried to get beyond
their regional markets and reach
the vast audience of the youthful
middle class. Unfortunately, as in
the case of Earl Scruggs, this can
mean a sacrifice of genuine
bluegrass flavor to more popular
rock and pop rhythms. Thus, the
courtly, dapper, quintessentially
southern Scruggs was sur
rounded by his longhaired,
electric-guitar wielding sons.
And though they played very
competently, their music veered
back and forth between fine
bluegrass and rather flat rock.
