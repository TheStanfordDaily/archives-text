# Public Image on stage and wax: Johnny Rotten rides again
## 
### 
Moments before Public Image
Ltd. came on stage at the South
of Market Cultural Center
Saturday night, there was
enough pushing and shoving
going on in the first few rows that
it became easier to understand
the recent tragedy in Cincinnati.
San Francisco might not have
been fully prepared lor a rebelli
ous Johnny Rotten when the Sex
Pistols played at Winterland a
few years ago, but that was be
fore "the scene" had really de
veloped. With more experience
behind them, Saturday night's
audience was clearly prepared,
most of them decked out in their
finest leather, ready to get rotten
with Johnny.
Forget the fact that he is now
known as John Lydon. and that
the Sex Pistols are now defunct
— there seemed to exist among
many in the audience an air of
expectation that Johnny would
burst on stage and lead them into

some kind of brutal, orgiastic
rock and roll delirium.
Lydon and the rest of the
band, however, had somewhat of
a surprise in store. In a recent
interview, Lydon said that he felt
rock and roll had died along with
the Sex Pistols: Public Image's
set Saturday night certainly
backed this claim. The band's
sound was not one which could
be called rock and roll, but rather
was one which moved beyond
many of the musical trends of the
seventies by fusing them all to
gether. The continually pound
ing bass of Jah Wobble left ves
tiges of the disco era: the guitar
work of Keith Levene was often
times characteristic of seventies
art-rock bands, and Lvdon's
vocals naturally added a New
Wave touch. The result was a
sound which seemed too new to
be called old but too old to be
catled new.
There was very little variation

in the group's set, and to those in
the audience who might not have
heard either of the group's two
albums, distinguishing one song
from another probably seemed
quite difficult. Though two songs
from the new album. "Career
ing'' and "Poptones," particu
larly stood out by pro\ iding a bit
more energy than the others,
most of the evening's songs basi
cally tit into the same mold: a
dominating bass sound com
plemented by L.\don's unique
vocals, usually lasting five to ten
minutes.
A definite flaw with Public
Image's performance was the
lack of synthesizer work. On the
group's album. Levene utilizes
synthesizers on a good number
of the songs, making the repeti
ti\e bass lines a bit more beara
ble. Saturday night, however,
Levene stuck mostly to provid
ing a very distant background
guitar, leaving it to the bassist.
Wobble, to prov ide many of the
leads. The only thing which
saved the sound mix from being a
disaster was the treatment of Lv
don's vocals, which though they
were often incomprehensible,
were basically functioning as an
instrument in themselves, rather
than as a source of statement; in
this respect. they blended in well.
As for Ly don's performance,
one could not help but notice a
tremendous stage presence, one
paralleled only by the likes of a
Mick Jagger. The stage de
meanor of John Lydon Saturday
night was not. however, quite the
same as his stage demeanor

when he was Johnny Rotten of
the Sex Pistols. Despite the fact
that on more than one occasion
Lydon's face was greeted by a
beer can from the audience, he
actually remained rather sedate
throughout the show, choosing
to stand around rather than to
dance, and to play with the audi
ence rather than to tight with them.
Throughout the evening, both
in terms of their music and their
show. Public Image Ltd. could
best be described as apathetic.
Despite strident demands from
the floor, there was no encore,
and one got the feeling that the
group was not out to please any
one. whether it be the fans or
Warner Brothers executives.
Lydon, it seems, has come to
realize the dangers of trying to
satisfy everyone's demands, and
has given up on trying to do so.
On one particular Public Image
song, "Memories," he sings that
"someone has used you well,"
and that "this person's had
enough of useless memories." If
there was one message that came
across by the time the evening
was over, it was that the Sex Pis
tols and what they came to repre
sent should be talked about in
the past tense, and that it is time
to move on from there rather
than brood about it.
Public Image Lt'd. managed to
provide Saturday night's audi
ence with a genuine, tight sound,
but little more than that (except
perhaps a place to gather and to
be seen).

Second Edition
Public Image l td.
Warner Brothers
John Lydon. a.k.a. Johnny Rotten, has a new
band. It's Public Image. As Johnny Rotten he was
the lead singer for the prototypical punk band,
now defunct, the Sex Pistols. His new band is not
punk. I'm not even sure it's rock and roll.
I don't think Public Image cares whether what
they do is rock and roll or not. So I guess it's not an
issue. But at a recent interview in San Francisco
they claimed that their new album is dance music.
That could be true. It makes me want to hop
around.
The bass is the lead instrument in the songs.
Setting up a pattern for what are basically repeti
tive chants. The bass sound is huge. It booms
through walls and is guaranteed to destroy most
stereos. It's sort of a reggae bass sound. That's
where a lot of Public Image's style seems to come
from: Reggae. I like that about it.
I've come to look at this album as a work of
contrasts. There is a sensuous, sensurround bass,
contrasted with a trebellv, sharp, (dare I s:>\
almost irritating guitar. There is a precisi
lined, very disco drum beat as a winding, \s i
and wailing John Lvdon sings.

It is very dimensional music. Great waves ot bass
out front, forlorn vocals that are far away. The
guitar is off to one side poking pinholes through the
wall of round bass noise. And the drumming,
steady and metallic below it all.
So you can see that it's basically rock and roll
instrumentation: bass, guitar, drums, vocals. But it
doesn't seem like rock and roll. And like I said,
that's not really the issue. What is the issue? You
figure it out.
The lyrics are all printed out 011 the album. They
look really interesting, but 1 can't figure them out.
Maybe if you buy the album you will.
This is the second Public Image album, as the
name suggests. It was first released in England
under the title "Metal Box," in a metal film con
tainer with small records inside. The group wanted
to release it that way in this country but Warner
Bros, wouldn't let them. They hate the American
album cover, which they had nothing to do with.
Alter hearing this second album 1 went back and
listened to their first album. 1 hated their first
album when it came out. But after hearing the
second album the first album starts to make sense,
mend th it \<m e out and
ilso the first
\o*s ijo it today!
