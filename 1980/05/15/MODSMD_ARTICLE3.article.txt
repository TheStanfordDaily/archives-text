Students accused of inserting an unauthorized photo
graph into the May 2 Stanford Daily have been charged with
violating the Fundamental Standard — the University code
of ethics.
The President's Office officially filed the charge with the
Dean of Student Affairs office on Tuesday, according to
Jennifer Westerlind, legal assistant to the University coun
sel. II found guilty, the students could be fined, or face
censure, suspension or expulsion.
The students replaced the Daily's front-page photograph
with one of seven men dressed in bowling attire and holding
bowling balls. The caption stated that the pictured members
of the Stanford bowling team had been killed in a plane
crash enroute to a match in Indiana.
The actual Stanford bowling team was not traveling, and
its members were not involved in the hoax. The photo
subjects were actually initiates of the Hammer and Coffin
Society, the publisher of the campus humor magazine, the

Chaparral.
The seven initiates and Hammer and Coffin issued public
apologies for the hoax on the Monday following the inci
dent.
Westerlind said it is not University policy to release either
the names of the accused students or the number ot students
charged.
The students may request that their case be heard by
Dean of Student Affairs James Lyons if they admit the act
was a violation of the Fundamental Standard. Or they may
request a hearing before the Student Judicial ( ouncil.
Lyons may also decline to hear the case and refer it to the
judicial council — a panel ot three students and three fa
culty members.
If the students are found guilty. President Richard Lyman
will make the final penalty decision based on SJC or the
dean's recommendations.
