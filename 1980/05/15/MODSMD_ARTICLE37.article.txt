# Lillejord elected new Daily editor
## 
### 
Sometimes the Daily gives nice
birthday presents. It happened List
night, when Ron Lillejord was
elected the next editor of the Daily
on his 21st birthday.
The famed Daily mo\ ie rev iewer
said his major plans as editor in
clude doing more movie reviews.
He denies, however, that Cinames
cope will become a weekly front
page feature.
Lillejord. who calls himself a
"private person." has several idols.
His heroine is Greta Garbo (he
wishes he had her privacy as well as
her throaty low voice). He also as
pires to be the next Pauline Kael.
Lillejord's journalistic career
began with the Daily entertainment
department. There he developed a
fondness for Francis Coppola films,
his helicopters and everything Jane
Fonda thinks, dreams and does. In
short, he would follow her to China,
which is exactly what he is doing
with his current non-film-star in
terest. a personality who is no
stranger to others at the Daily.
Almost legally blind. Lillejord's
journalistic talents do not stretch to
the typewriter on which he has been
known to type djdghlsakt and ef
fortlessly. Sources close to the Kirk
land. Wash., native sav he is too un-
V

coordinated to be competitive in
many sports, which may lead to his
becoming the first Daily editor not
allowed to play for the newspaper's
football and softball teams.
Lillejord's partner in prose next
year will be Seth Zuckerman. an
I N-y ear-old who aspires to be some
thing unlike anyone has ever met. A
selt -confessed card-carry ing
member of Columbae House, the
managing editor-elect liv es on a diet
of granola and bean sprouts, a diet
he plans to force on many members
of next year's staff.
Zuckerman's receding hairline is
covered fully by a shaggy mop of
curly brown hair, in which untold
numbers of Columbae residents
may live unnoticed.
Editor-elect Lillejord attended
high school in Snoqualmie (a word
he might be expected to uninten
tionally enter into a typewriter).
Wash. His work on the Daily has
opened his journalistic career hori
zons to the possibility of one day
writing entertainment articles for a
magazine, 112 ailing that, he'll aim for
the big bucks of international trade.
Lillejord will take office on June
1 5. shortly after w Inch he has repor
tedly considered planting alfalfa
sprouts in the editor's office.
