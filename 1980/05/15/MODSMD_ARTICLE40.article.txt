# Campus photographers aim for freedom of art

### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
In its most simple form,
photography is a means of re
cording the images of people and
events. At a more complex level,
however, photography possesses
much greater significance; it is an
art form, a means of expression
and communication.
Most of those who are in
trigued with the fascinating pro
cess of suspending fleeting mo
ments in still black and white
pursue photography as a hobby,
but a few carry this fascination to
the level of a career.
"People dabble in photo
graphy very easily," said Ted Or
land, a guest professor of photo
graphy here. "It's only when
they're ready to jump into the
deep end of the pool with the
realization that they may sink
completely that (they) pursue it
as a career."
The professional oppor
tunities available to aspiring
photographers are more numer
ous than one might think, hut the
field is also extremely competi
tive. An additional drawback
sometimes arises when photo
graphers feel compelled to sub
liminate their art to the desires of
others in order to survive.
Few financial rewards
As pointed out by Harry Kil
las, a senior here who has been

developing his own black and
white prints since he was 12, one
who pursues photography as art
for art's sake cannot expect fi
nancial rewards.
"Most photographers do not
eat hand-to-mouth with their
photography," Killas said.
K. i 11 as, who will enter film
school next year, said he foresees
his photography advancing with
his concentration on the visual
arts.
"For me photography is
bound up in expression and
communication," Killas said. "It
is not only a visual image, but a
verbal message."
Another graduating senior,
who asked not to be identified,
plans to go to New York after her
graduation to pursue a career in
photography. She named
numerous career opportunities
available to black-and-white
photographers, such as news
paper journalism, magazine art,
freelance work and photography
tor publishing companies.
TTie latter usually entails the
production of technical photos
tor books, such as pictures of a
pie tor a cookbook or pictures of
exotic islands for a travel guide.
"Obviously some are more in
teresting than others." she said.
The photographer, who won a
prize in last year's Daily photo
contest, also said that friends

who have pursued careers in lit
erature have told her not to take
a part-time job, if she intends to
pursue a serious career in photo
graphy.
"They said one tends to get
sucked into the job and might
end up settling for less," she
explained."ln my free time I will
always be taking pictures for my
self, however, so when it comes
to making a living I would settle
for a related field."
Documentary photography
The photographer said her
ideal job at this time would be
one with a social or political as
pect, such as those conducted by
the federal government during
the Depression.

"ln the 1920s the government
hired teams of photographers
and sociologists to give the offi
cials a clearer view of the living
conditions of the American
people," she said. "Some of my
favorite photographers came out
of this era."
The ultimate goal of this
photographer is a common one
in the photography profession:
to attain the freedom to pursue
art for art's sake.
"To do this, you must develop
a style that speaks to people,"
she said. "Then it will be possible
to exhibit your photos in a gal
lery."
Galleries are one of the best
mediums for photographers to
make their art known. Despite

the hefty sales percentages that
many galleries collect, the expo
sure is usually worthwhile.
According to Killas, "To an
extent, the gallery people deter
mine -who gets in and who
doesn't."
Orland is one of a small group
of photographers who has
achieved that enviable goal of
being free to pursue art for its
own sake. After he finishes his
quarter here, Orland said, he will
be ready to "become a full-time
artist."
For the past six years, Orland
has been teaching part-time,
which he believes is one of the
most desirable ways of coor
dinating one's photographic pur
