# New 35 mm cameras spur photography boom
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
Focus and click — that's all
that's necessary to take a picture
with the new automatic exposure
35 mm cameras.
A photography boom began
about three years ago with the
mass-marketing of easy-to-use
professional-quality cameras.
According to Marc Fowler,
manager of Crick Photographic
at the Old Mill, "Extensive
Canon AE-1 advertising cam
paigns changed pocket instama
tic users into 35 mm users."
Little extra equipment is being
sold. Fowler said this indicates a
boom particularly in amateurs
buying cameras.
"A lot of beginners are coming
into the field," he said.
Gene Thurber, of the Keeble
and Shuchat camera store in Palo
Alto, said that anyone can use
the new cheaper, more easy to
use cameras. Prices are generally
in the $200 range.
As a result, the 35 mm camera
is responsible for 85 percent of
total equipment sales at Keeble
and Shuchat. Thurber said.
"The major portion of
cameras arc being sold to people
who've maybe never owned a
camera before," he added.
According to student Brett
Love, "A lot of people change to
35 mm cameras because they're
sick of crummy pictures. Now,"
he continued, "amateurs can

take quality pictures and feel
professional."
He said people started to fi
gure, "Why not take good pic
tures if it's so easy?" The au
tomatic 35 mms also make action
pictures easy.
Love added, "People are kind
of embarrassed to carry around
Kodaks now."
Another reason for the boom
is the increased awareness of to
day's mass-media oriented soci

ety in images, rather than words.
"We're starting to think in terms
of pictures," Fowler said.
Student Pam Sanchez, whose
photography is currently on
exhibit at the Coffee House, said
she sees the boom as "much
more than an economic fad."
According to Sanchez, photo
graphy is an eye-opening means
of expression; with a camera,
"you see things you never would
have noticed before," she said.
