Are you one of those people who has always
been interested in photography but finds them
selves baffled by the jargon?
You say you always thought ASA was a new kind
of camera destined to replace the SLR?
You say you thought "last film" meant the shut
ter speed was set to one-thousandth of a second?
You sa> you thought grain was something that
grew in Iowa?

photographer, it might do you well to do a bit ol
reading on the subject. Fortunately, John
Hedgecoe has just the hook for you.

through a series of 30 projects, each with their own
subtopic. Step b\ step, he covers the nuances of

lighting, printing techniques, equipment and film.

photographic glossary virtually guaranteed to
eliminate any confusion between SL.R and ASA.
