# Several recent incidents spur investigation of Delts, Zetes
## 
### Debbie Walker Staff Writer 
The University is considering.taking
action against the /.eta Psi and Delta
Tau Delta fraternities as a result of sev
eral recent incidents. While no decision
has been reached. University officials
have warned that the fraternities could
face loss of their housing.
The Zetes have been charged with
stealing bamboo and palm fronds from
Palo Alto and the Delts are under in
vestigation for two recent confronta
tions with other on-campus living
groups.
According to Norm Robinson, as
sociate dean for Residential Educa
tion, Zete pledges are under investiga
tion by the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment for stealing bamboo from private
yards and palm fronds from commer
cial areas in Palo Alto for the annual
Zete Luau.
Palm fronds
John Kinney, Inter-Fraternity Coun
cil president, said that many groups
have luaus in which palm fronds are
used for decorations, but that most
groups obtain the fronds legitimately.
James Lyons, dean of student affairs,
said the Zete fraternity has been "on
notice" since February that any further
vandalism on or off campus or destruc
tion of the fraternity residence would
result in reassignment of the house.
The recent incident "certainly puts
them in some peril, I think," Lyons
said.
Robinson said the situation still is
not completely clear. The Row Office
has received reports of large plate-glass
windows being broken at the Zete
house and also has reason to believe
that members of the fraternity have
been stealing baseball nets used for
batting practice from the Athletic De
partment, Robinson said.
The Zete president could not be
reached yesterday for comment.
A final decision regarding the status
of the Zete house will be made soon.
Robinson will be meeting today with

members of the fraternity.
"It is within the realm of possibility"
that the Zetes will not be living in their
house next year, Robinson said.
No action yet
Row Director Diana Conklin said no
action has been decided on.
"However, several incidents that
have occurred recently don't make
chances look very good for the house,"
she added.
The Delta Tau Delta fraternity is
also in danger of facing disciplinary ac
tion, according to University officials.
Robinson recently requested that
William Offutt, acting assistant direc
tor of the Row, prepare a report of Delt
activities. Offutt said the report con
sists of two parts; the first dealing with
most recent incidents and the second
concerning the history of the Delts
from 1974 to the present. The recent
events occurred within the last two
weeks.
On the first weekend in May, several
people in the Delt house reportedly
threw oranges at the Theta Xi house.
Theta Xi members reportedly went to
the Delt house equipped with baseball
bats. One Theta Xi resident was struck
by a Delt, according to members of
both fraternities.
Incidents
Theta Xi member Derek Daley said
the confrontation evolved from a series
of Delt actions over the last year that he
said annoyed Theta Xi residents.
Daley said there were enough prob
lems to warrant establishing a conflict
resolving procedure between the two
houses. But he said the system broke
down within a month.
A second incident reportedly occur
red after the Delt bid party, when a
Delt and a friend who Offutt said were
described as being drunk, went to a
Synergy house party about 2 a.m. Be
fore leaving, the Delt friend hit another
individual, apparently unprovoked, ac
cording to Offutt.
"When this is combined with an inci
dent of earlier rush, when a drunk girl

tell out of a window of the Delt house,
and in light of their history, the Delts
are in what I think is a very precarious
condition," Offutt said.
Offutt said he will have no part in the
decision-making process. Robinson
will decide what, if any, action will he
taken.
Robinson said yesterday that he has
not yet looked into the matter.
The historical report of the Delts
prepared by Offutt includes the list of
warnings that have been issued to the
fraternity annually since 1974.
Offutt said the University was con
cerned ""not so much with each particu
lar incident, but the whole pattern of
incidents."
"Given their (the Delts) history,
they couldn't realistically expect to
allow the pattern to continue."
Delt president Al Duenas said he
does not think it is fair that Delt history
is being used in the decision-making
process.
New individuals
"New individuals are in the house
now," Duenas said. "Those associated
with the spotted Delt history are no
longer with us."
He added that current fraternity
members are well aware that if they
repeat actions similar to those commit
ted in the past, they will be subject to
disciplinary action.
"We've made a conscious effort to
maintain, and I think we've made a
tremendous improvement," Duenas
said.
He added that he does not condone
the most recent acts, "but these inci
dents are very minor compared to what
has occurred in the past."
The house management has discip
lined the fraternity members who were
involved, according to Duenas.
Duenas said he was surprised at
being contacted by the Daily because
of a verbal agreement with the Row
Office that the press would not be
notified before Robinson contacted the
Delts.
