# Hoover Fellow discusses foreign affairs objectives
## Gov't, party policy contradictions cited 
### Aleen Zimberoff Staff Writer 
"If you want something, vote for the
other guy," advised Hoover senior fel
low Seymour Martin Lipset speaking
Tuesday on the 1980 presidential elec
tions and U.S. foreign policy.
Citing historical examples, the polit
ical science professor commented on
the current political situation and ot
tered an explanation for apparent con

tradictions in policy compared to party
ideology.
Lipset cited former presidents
categorized as "hawks" or "doves"
who implemented policies that ran
counter to their political party's tradi
tional philosophy.
Lipset called peace and resistance to
communism the two most desirable ob
jectives in foreign policy.
The United States wants"peace with
honor, justice and decency in terms of
our relationships with other coun
tries," he said, "and we regard com
munist expansion as evil."
Pressures
With national priorities, Lipset said
there is a tendency for the president to
yield to pressures by the opposition to
prove a commitment to either peace or
anti-communism.
"The doves don't have to de
monstrate a commitment to peace;
given their history, they must de
monstrate anti-communist actions.
Similarly, the hawks don't have to de
monstrate their anti-communist con
victions; they have to demonstrate a
commitment to maintaining peace.
"When the doves seek to carry out
foreign policy in areas affecting the na
tional interest, that policy will be
fiercely attacked by the opposition and
undermine their strength," said Lipset.
"So, the doves are inhibited from

carrying out a policy that privately they
feel is warranted. A number of presi
dents wanted to deal with communist
China for example, but such a feeling of
hostility existed that they had to de
monstrate that they were hardline, or
harder than their opponents," he ad
ded.
Conservative presidents
Lipset said the reverse is true for
conservative presidents, especially
when "following on the heels of the
doves." Conservative presidents find it
"easier to settle foreign policy by mov
ing in a dovish direction."
Lipset cited several Democratic
presidents whose administrations will
be remembered by implementing
policies of American aggression.
"There's been a variety of action
under Democratic presidents since
1948 that can be described as hawkish
regardless of their ideology," he said.
Republicans
Conversely, Lipset cited Republican
administrations' promotion of peace,
initiation of detente and a general "rol
ling back of the Iron Curtain."
"If one looks at the record of these
two parties and presidents under them
and forgets what one knows about the
people supporting them, one is some
what justified in attributing dovish be
havior to the Republicans and hawkish
behavior to the Democrats," Lipset

said.
Addressing the current political
campaign, Lipset remarked that it is
clearly "a three-candidate race bet
ween Carter, Reagan and Anderson."
"Carter's key issue was the fact that
no American soldier was in combat
under his administration." Acknowledg
ing that the recent hostage rescue at
tempt changed the validity of that
claim, Lipset predicted that "Carter
will continue to draw a distinction bet
ween he and Reagan based on foreign
policy issues.
Carter campaign
"Foreign affairs have already had a
major impact on Carter's campaign.
The polls showed he was close to hope
less before the hostage situation. Then
came Iran and Afghanistan and his pos
ition went way up. He stayed in the
White House instead of on the Delta
Queen," said Lipset.
"The ayatollah and Brezhnev cer
tainly nominated Mr. Carter," he ad
ded.
An incumbent president running for
re-election has a distinct advantage,
Lipset said; he can initiate events.
"The public wants leadership in the
foreign policy realm. Doing something
is an advantage, even if it fails."
Carter sometimes "violates the
bounds of appropriate politics,"
warned Lipset.
