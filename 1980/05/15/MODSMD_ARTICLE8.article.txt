# Speaker defends Soviet invasion
## 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
A former Hoover senior fellow de
fended the Soviet military presence in
Afghanistan in a talk here Tuesday,
saying that the Afghan government in
vited the intervention in response to
foreign threats.
William Mandel, in a South Asia
Week speech, cited the threat of U.S.
military action in Iran, and unrest in
Afghanistan caused by U.S.-backed
rebels working from Pakistan as factors
behind the Soviet intervention.
Mandel, one of the first two Slavic
Studies fellows at Hoover in 1947, has
hosted a Berkeley radio station prog
ram on the Soviet Union for more than
20 years. He is also the author of five
books on the nation.
Another element that influenced the
Soviet decision to intervene, according
to Mandel, was a NATO rejection of a
Soviet disarmament proposal last De
cember. Mandel said Soviet leader

Leonid Brezhnev had pledged to with
draw 300,000 tanks and 20,000 troops
from Eastern Europe and to reduce the
number of Soviet missiles pointed at
Europe if the allies rejected deploy
ment of the American-made Pershing
missiles. But Mandel said U.S. pressure
led NATO to reject the proposal. The
Afghan intervention occurred two
weeks later, he said.
"Within the framework of the
societies concerned, (the Soviet action)
was completely legal," he said. "Soviet
troops will go home when the U.S.
stops supporting the Afghan rebels,"
Mandel added.
Mandel said the original leftist coup
in 197K occured after a purge of lead
ing Afghan communists — a move
Mandel said was inspired by the then
shah of Iran's efforts to include Af
ghanistan in a pro-West alliance.
Subsequently, he said, Afghan Pres
ident Hafizullah Amin's government
antagonized its people by attempting to

swiftly implement broad reforms. The
resulting unrest prompted Amin's re
quest for Soviet intervention, accord
ing to Mandel.
In December, the Soviets moved
militarily into Afghanistan. Amin's
government was toppled, he was killed
and the Soviet-backed regime of Presi
dent Babrak Karmal was installed.
Mandel predicted that in five to 10
years, the current Soviet-backed gov
ernment will win the trust of he major
ity of the Afghanis through gradual so
cial reforms. He based his statement on
a comparison with the slow but
"enormous" rise in living condition in
the Moslem states of Soviet central
Asia. He said loyalty to the govern
ment there is "far greater than any
where else in the U.S.S.R."
Mandel criticized President Jimmy
Carter's foreign policy — adding that
Carter's actions have "returned us al
most to the Cold War."
Mandel said that I S. sponsored de-
Icnse alliance's in South Asia (Sh A I(>
and C'ENIO), which exclude India,
have driven that country closer to the
Soviet Union. Recent efforts to in
crease American military presence in
the area have strengthened that tie. ac
cording to Mandel.
"India and the U.S.S R. have been
trying to mainain the Indian Ocean as a
/one ot peace." he said. This is one ot
the reasons India opposed America's
establishment ot the first major naval
base there in 1 *>74. he said.
Alter the speech, graduate student
Arv ind Khilani.a member of the Pakis
tani Student Association, disagreed
with Mandel's defense of the interven
tion.
It we accept (Mandel's) view, then
everything the I .S S R. does to the
I hird World will get justified."
"The Soviet military presence in Af
ghanistan will help cause more harm
than good," Khilani said.
Nana In/, co-president of the Stan
ford India Association, said South Asia
Week is "an outreach effort to share
different aspects of the politics, history
and culture of a diverse area," includ
ing India. Pakistan. Bangladesh. Af
ghanistan. Sri Lanka, and Burma. She
said this area of the world is largely
ignored by the University.
Co-sponsored by the Bangladesh

Student Association as well as the In
dian and Pakistani groups, the week's
evi uts continue tonight with a variety
show including dance and films at the
Lscondido Village Center. Tomorrow
Dr. Joanne kirkpatrick of U.C.-

cember. Mandel said Soviet leader

Leonid Brezhnev had pledged to with
draw 300,000 tanks and 20,000 troops
from Eastern Europe and to reduce the
number of Soviet missiles pointed at
Europe if the allies rejected deploy
ment of the American-made Pershing
missiles. But Mandel said U.S. pressure
led NATO to reject the proposal. The
Afghan intervention occurred two
weeks later, he said.
"Within the framework of the
societies concerned, (the Soviet action)
was completely legal," he said. "Soviet
troops will go home when the U.S.
stops supporting the Afghan rebels,"
Mandel added.
Mandel said the original leftist coup
in 197K occured after a purge of lead
ing Afghan communists — a move
Mandel said was inspired by the then
shah of Iran's efforts to include Af
ghanistan in a pro-West alliance.
Subsequently, he said, Afghan Pres
ident Hafizullah Amin's government
antagonized its people by attempting to

swiftly implement broad reforms. The
resulting unrest prompted Amin's re
quest for Soviet intervention, accord
ing to Mandel.
In December, the Soviets moved
militarily into Afghanistan. Amin's
government was toppled, he was killed
and the Soviet-backed regime of Presi
dent Babrak Karmal was installed.
Mandel predicted that in five to 10
years, the current Soviet-backed gov
ernment will win the trust of he major
ity of the Afghanis through gradual so
cial reforms. He based his statement on
a comparison with the slow but
"enormous" rise in living condition in
the Moslem states of Soviet central
Asia. He said loyalty to the govern
ment there is "far greater than any
where else in the U.S.S.R."
Mandel criticized President Jimmy
Carter's foreign policy — adding that
Carter's actions have "returned us al
most to the Cold War."
Mandel said that I S. sponsored de-
Icnse alliance's in South Asia (Sh A I(>
and C'ENIO), which exclude India,
have driven that country closer to the
Soviet Union. Recent efforts to in
crease American military presence in
the area have strengthened that tie. ac
cording to Mandel.
"India and the U.S.S R. have been
trying to mainain the Indian Ocean as a
/one ot peace." he said. This is one ot
the reasons India opposed America's
establishment ot the first major naval
base there in 1 *>74. he said.
Alter the speech, graduate student
Arv ind Khilani.a member of the Pakis
tani Student Association, disagreed
with Mandel's defense of the interven
tion.
It we accept (Mandel's) view, then
everything the I .S S R. does to the
I hird World will get justified."
"The Soviet military presence in Af
ghanistan will help cause more harm
than good," Khilani said.

Week is "an outreach effort to share
different aspects of the politics, history
and culture of a diverse area," includ
ing India. Pakistan. Bangladesh. Af

ignored by the University.

A former Hoover senior fellow de
fended the Soviet military presence in
Afghanistan in a talk here Tuesday,
saying that the Afghan government in
vited the intervention in response to
foreign threats.
William Mandel, in a South Asia
Week speech, cited the threat of U.S.
military action in Iran, and unrest in
Afghanistan caused by U.S.-backed
rebels working from Pakistan as factors
behind the Soviet intervention.
Mandel, one of the first two Slavic
Studies fellows at Hoover in 1947, has
hosted a Berkeley radio station prog
ram on the Soviet Union for more than
20 years. He is also the author of five
books on the nation.
Another element that influenced the
Soviet decision to intervene, according
to Mandel, was a NATO rejection of a
Soviet disarmament proposal last De
cember. Mandel said Soviet leader

Leonid Brezhnev had pledged to with
draw 300,000 tanks and 20,000 troops
from Eastern Europe and to reduce the
number of Soviet missiles pointed at
Europe if the allies rejected deploy
ment of the American-made Pershing
missiles. But Mandel said U.S. pressure
led NATO to reject the proposal. The
