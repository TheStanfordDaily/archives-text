# Faculty OKs distribution requirement
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
This fall's incoming freshmen will
select from among 300 courses in fulfil
ling recently approved distribution re
quirements under a plan approved yes
terday by the Faculty Senate.
The revised course list is one
seventh the si/.e of this year's list which
includes more than 2000 courses, ac
cording to History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee, head of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS).
Among the most popular courses
which will no longer fulfill distribution
requirements are Criminal Justice.
Human Sexuality and the Psychology
of Madness.
Freshmen entering the University in
the fall and transfer students entering
in 1 C )N2 must take Western Culture and
at least one course in each of seven
areas: literature and the fine arts;
philosophy; social and religious
thought; human development; be
havior and language; social processes
and institutions; mathematical sci
ences; natural sciences; and technology
and applied sciences. The require
ments must be fulfilled before the stu
dent may graduate.
Under the current system, students
must take at least three courses from
three broader distribution areas, in
cluding humanities; social sciences;
and natural sciences, mathematics and
technology.
Continuity encouraged
To encourage continuity in students'
academic programs, CUS tried to pre
sent sequences of courses for approval
by the senate. Lougee said.
"Courses will be sequenced between
areas to offer students 'meals' rather
than snacks," " she added.
A number of senate members
criticized both the small number of ac
ceptable courses and the notable ab
sence of first-year languages from the
approved list.
Lougee had addressed the foreign
language problem specifically in her
opening remarks, saying the problem
was too complex to be solved at this
time and that CUS would be giving the
issue special consideration as soon as
possible.
Though Lougee said students may
petition for individual exceptions to the
newly approved list, the members ar
gued this may prove cumbersome ad
ministratively.
Questions
Other senate members questioned
the large number of courses approved
in Area Two, literature and fine arts.
Lougee said that a large number of
courses is needed in this area to avoid
the pressures of excessive enrollment.
Some members were still not satis
tied. leading to a split voice vote when
the question was finally called. Senate
chairman Albert Hastorf declared the
proposal carried.
Lougee emphasized that the list ol
certified courses will annually be re
timed and revised.
A number of committees have
worked on the evaluation of acceptable
courses since mid-February. Some 85
people, 7b of whom were professors,
served on the panels.
Speaking to what he called the Uni
versity's need for a new commitment to
affirmative action in graduate admis
sions and in faculty appointments,
Dean of Graduate Studies Bliss Car
nochan said he expects four black or
Chicano appointments will be made
