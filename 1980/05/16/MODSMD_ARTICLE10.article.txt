# U.S. criticized for censoring in Japan
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
The United States prides itself
on freedom of the press. Yet
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur during
the American occupation of
Japan from 1948 to 1952 en
forced censorship.
Professor Jun Eto of the
Tokyo Institute of Technology,
an eminent critic in Japan, spoke
here Wednesday to about 50
persons on "The American Oc
cupation and Post-War Japanese
Literature."
According to Eto, all major
magazines were censored prior
to publication during the occupa
tion.
After the war, the United
States viewed Japan as militaris
tic and sought to change
Japanese values. But Eto em
phasized that "no nation is inhe
rently militaristic."
The victorious Americans
thought they had "the authority
to punish," he said. "But no
earthly power has ever been en
dowed with such authority."
If God is impartial, he said,
"there must be no difference be
tween the victorious and the
vanquished, the occupiers and
the occupied."
Eto focused on the censorship
of writer Mitsuru Yoshida's ac
count of the sinking of the battle
ship Yamako. The censorship

bureau "advised Yoshida to
make heavy editorial cuts," said
Eto.
The bureau also "suffered
from a shortage of allied person
nel with a command of the
Japanese language." One cen
sor, for example, penciled "this
is the most implausible story I
have ever heard" on Yoshida's
manuscript.
The American authorities' at
tempt to "democratize Japan by
enforcing censorship" was
ironic, Eto said.
The battleship account was
Yoshida's first work and served
as the representative in Ameri
can censorship in Japan, said
Eto. "Other authors were ad
vised to watch Â«vhat would hap
pen to this particular work."
Many were "thoroughly oppres
sed," according to Eto.
Textbook censorship was also
effectively practiced in postwar
Japan, although clandestinely,
Eto added. Authorities ordered
students to delete objectionable
sections. One publisher of a high
school text proudly wrote, "this
has passed censorship" in the
beginning of his book.
Eto lectured as part of a series
on Japanese literature sponsored
by the Center for East Asian
Studies. The last talk of the series
will be held Monday.
