# Most Germans give up hope of reunification
## 
### Harry Trimborn The Los Angeles Times 
BONN — Gerd Mildner. a 71 -year-old
Bonn pensioner, says he thinks about a
reunified Germany only when he visits
relatives in the East. "But deep down in
side I know that there is no hope that my
country will be reunited." he said, "at
least not in my lifetime." Mildner fled to
the West in 1945. ahead of advancing
Soviet troops.
Helga Sieg. a 40-year-old secretary,
expressed another view that is widespread
in West Germany.
"We have no relatives in East Ger
many. she said. "We don't concern our
selves with reunification. We have other
things to think about."
So does Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
But when he does think about reunifica
tion. he pictures it as a goal that can be
achieved "in the distant future."
Still, he has said. "One day Germans
will live together again, but under a diffe
rent and as yet unknown system."
Few expect it
The authoritative Allensbach Institute,
West Germany's major poller of public
opinion, reports that only one percent of
the nation's 60 million people still con
sider reunification the No. 1 national
problem. And the great majority place
the issue last on a list of 18 expectations
for the future.
T"he country was divided by the growing
hostility between the wartime allies — Fr
ance. Britain and the United states on one
hand and the Soviet Union on the other.

Under the 1945 Yalta and Potsdam ag
reements and other allied documents,
Germany was to remain united hut di
vided into four occupation zones, each
governed by one of the allied victors. In
the ensuing Cold War, the British. French
and American zones were merged into
what is now the Federal Republic of
Germany — West Germany. The Soviet
zone became the German Democratic
Republic — East Germany.
Old capital
The old capital. Berlin, 1 10 miles inside
East Germany, technically remains ruled
by a four-power occupation agreement.
Like Schmidt, most West Germans see
reunification as possible only by means of
fundamental reorganization as Europe,
through the creation of a United States of
Europe or some other form of federation
that would include the nations of both
Eastern and Western Europe.
For now. West Germany relies on its
so-called "policy of small steps," a key
element in the Ostpolitik — Eastern pol
icy — pioneered by Schmidt's immediate
predecessor, Willy Brandt. This policy
seeks to increase contacts among families,
friends and others who have been sepa
rated by the division of Germany and to
assist in the repatriation of ethnic Ger
mans from communist countries.
Status quo
Many West Germans, according to
Manfred Ackermann. an official in the
Ministry of Intra-German Affairs, worry
that any change in the geographical status
quo could affect their prosperity and sta

bility. Would reunion with East Ger
many. they ask, force them to lower their
living standard in order to upgrade that of
the East Germans? Per capita income in
East Germany is $4220 a year, a little
more than half that in West Germany.
"This is a serious question among West
Germans," Ackermann, chief of the
ministry's political coordination section,
said. "That is why reunification is of much
greater concern among East Germans
than it is for us in the West.
"Aside from personal considerations,
the East Germans have much more to
gain from reunification than West Ger
mans, assuming reunion is achieved, as we
wish, through free and democratic means.
For there is no question that the East
Germans — despite what their govern
ment says — would prefer to live under
the West German system."
Lip service
West Germany's Western neighbors
pay lip service to reunification but are
pretty satisfied with the status quo, ac
cording to diplomatic sources.
France, for example, despite the close
and friendly ties it now has with West
Germany, would be especially nervous
about a reunited Germany.
Such a Germany would have a com
bined population of about 80 million —
27 million more than France and 24 mill
ion more than Britain or Italy. It would
bring together what in their respective
spheres are already industrial giants with
an enormous military potential.

The prospect clearly frightens Poland,
which incorporated a large chunk of pre
war Germany. Poland could be a prime
target if the Germans should ever seek to
recover their lost territories.
For this reason, Wlodzimiriz Konarski,
deputy director of planning in the Polish
Foreign Ministry, said in a recent inter
view. "We categorically and definitely
prefer two Germanys to one."
West Germany has sought to allay the
fears of Poland and other nations of a
vengeful Germany through repeated de
clarations that any change in territorial
status would he accomplished only be
peaceful means.
Emotional issue
While the Eastern territories appear to
be excluded from consideration of
reunification at this time, the issue re
mains a vital and emotional one among
East Germany's 17 million inhabitants,
despite the East German regime's efforts
to create a separate national identity for
them.
As West German pensioner Mildner
put it, "Whenever we visit over there (the
East) there is talk of reunification. People
there don't want to give up hope that one
day life will change for the better for
them."
For most East Germans, any change for
the better means an opportunity to enjoy
the freedoms and prosperity of the West
Germans. These yearnings have promp
ted the Kremlin and the East German
regime to drop active consideration of
reunification.

For this reason, Wlodzimiriz Konarski,
deputy director of planning in the Polish
Foreign Ministry, said in a recent inter
view. "We categorically and definitely
prefer two Germanys to one."
West Germany has sought to allay the
fears of Poland and other nations of a
vengeful Germany through repeated de
clarations that any change in territorial
status would he accomplished only be
peaceful means.
Emotional issue
While the Eastern territories appear to
be excluded from consideration of
reunification at this time, the issue re
mains a vital and emotional one among
East Germany's 17 million inhabitants,
despite the East German regime's efforts
to create a separate national identity for
them.
As West German pensioner Mildner
put it, "Whenever we visit over there (the
East) there is talk of reunification. People
there don't want to give up hope that one
day life will change for the better for
them."
For most East Germans, any change for
the better means an opportunity to enjoy
the freedoms and prosperity of the West
Germans. These yearnings have promp
ted the Kremlin and the East German
regime to drop active consideration of
reunification.
BONN — Gerd Mildner. a 71 -year-old
Bonn pensioner, says he thinks about a
reunified Germany only when he visits
relatives in the East. "But deep down in
side I know that there is no hope that my
country will be reunited." he said, "at
least not in my lifetime." Mildner fled to
the West in 1945. ahead of advancing
Soviet troops.
Helga Sieg. a 40-year-old secretary,
expressed another view that is widespread
in West Germany.
"We have no relatives in East Ger
many. she said. "We don't concern our
selves with reunification. We have other
things to think about."
So does Chancellor Helmut Schmidt.
But when he does think about reunifica
tion. he pictures it as a goal that can be
achieved "in the distant future."
Still, he has said. "One day Germans
will live together again, but under a diffe
rent and as yet unknown system."
Few expect it
The authoritative Allensbach Institute,
West Germany's major poller of public
opinion, reports that only one percent of
the nation's 60 million people still con
sider reunification the No. 1 national
problem. And the great majority place
the issue last on a list of 18 expectations
for the future.
T"he country was divided by the growing
hostility between the wartime allies — Fr
ance. Britain and the United states on one
hand and the Soviet Union on the other.

Under the 1945 Yalta and Potsdam ag
reements and other allied documents,
Germany was to remain united hut di
vided into four occupation zones, each
governed by one of the allied victors. In
the ensuing Cold War, the British. French
and American zones were merged into
what is now the Federal Republic of
Germany — West Germany. The Soviet
zone became the German Democratic
Republic — East Germany.
Old capital
The old capital. Berlin, 1 10 miles inside
East Germany, technically remains ruled
by a four-power occupation agreement.
Like Schmidt, most West Germans see
reunification as possible only by means of
fundamental reorganization as Europe,
through the creation of a United States of
Europe or some other form of federation
that would include the nations of both
Eastern and Western Europe.
For now. West Germany relies on its
so-called "policy of small steps," a key
element in the Ostpolitik — Eastern pol
icy — pioneered by Schmidt's immediate
predecessor, Willy Brandt. This policy
seeks to increase contacts among families,
friends and others who have been sepa
rated by the division of Germany and to
assist in the repatriation of ethnic Ger
mans from communist countries.
Status quo
Many West Germans, according to
Manfred Ackermann. an official in the
Ministry of Intra-German Affairs, worry
that any change in the geographical status
quo could affect their prosperity and sta

bility. Would reunion with East Ger
many. they ask, force them to lower their
living standard in order to upgrade that of
the East Germans? Per capita income in
East Germany is $4220 a year, a little
more than half that in West Germany.
"This is a serious question among West
Germans," Ackermann, chief of the
ministry's political coordination section,
said. "That is why reunification is of much
greater concern among East Germans
than it is for us in the West.
"Aside from personal considerations,
the East Germans have much more to
gain from reunification than West Ger
mans, assuming reunion is achieved, as we
wish, through free and democratic means.
For there is no question that the East
Germans — despite what their govern
ment says — would prefer to live under
the West German system."
Lip service
West Germany's Western neighbors
pay lip service to reunification but are
pretty satisfied with the status quo, ac
cording to diplomatic sources.
France, for example, despite the close
and friendly ties it now has with West
Germany, would be especially nervous
about a reunited Germany.
Such a Germany would have a com
bined population of about 80 million —
27 million more than France and 24 mill
ion more than Britain or Italy. It would
bring together what in their respective
spheres are already industrial giants with
an enormous military potential.

The prospect clearly frightens Poland,
which incorporated a large chunk of pre
war Germany. Poland could be a prime
target if the Germans should ever seek to
recover their lost territories.

deputy director of planning in the Polish
Foreign Ministry, said in a recent inter
