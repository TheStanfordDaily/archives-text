# BUG ME

My stock of questions is coming rapidly to an
end, but then so is this quarter and my career as an
illustrious Daily columnist (and my career as a
not-so-illustrious Stanford undergraduate?). Why,
it seems like just yesterday that I was a curious,
excited Larkin freshperson ....
But I still have a job to do, so Memory Lane will
have to give way to these questions:
Dear Bug Me,
How do the bells in Hoover Tower work? Are
there really bells up there, or are they recorded? Do
they always ring at a certain time? Can / make
requests?
- Genie
Goodness, Genie, go up to the observation plat
form of Hoover Tower and see for yourself!
The bells are definitely real. There are 35 of
them, a gift from the Belgian government in ap
preciation of President Herbert Hoover's help with
the Belgian Relief Fund. They were installed on
the fourteenth floor of Hoover Tower (the obser
vation deck) when the Tower was built in 1941.
The carillon is played by means of a keyboard on
the thirteenth floor of the Tower, and can be
played only when the observation deck is closed.
The observation deck is closed, according to tour
guide Karen Mills, for an h'ourat noon every week
day and again at five each afternoon to allow Pro
fessor of Electrical Engineering James Angell, or
music students of his, to play the bells.
As far as requests are concerned, 1 imagine if you
ask Dr. Angell or one of the students who play the
bells really nicely, and if your request is reasonable,
they might be able to accommodate you.

By the way, Karen Mills, a junior, also tells me
that it you put fresh pineapple or papaya into ap
ricot jello, the jello will not set.
It you thought that was a curious fact to present
here, read on:
Dear Bug Me,
How many hours does the average Stanford stu
dent spend in Memorial Auditorium during his or
her four years here?
- Curious in Manzanita
It just so happens that I have a friend who is as

average as they come, and it also just so happens
that for the last tour years 1 have kept track of the
exact number of hours she has spent in Memorial
Aud.
This student spent about 36 hours a year in that
nostalgic old building watching Sunday night
movies, and another nine hours a year at Ram's
Head shows and miscellaneous other shows or
meetings. Add another two hours of combined re
gistration time and 24 hours of Human Sex (I'm
talking about the class: Human Bio 10, which is
sometimes taught in that auditorium. My friend
was in that class, which met for three hours a week
in Mem Aud, but she cut class a few times.)
Ms. Average, then, spent over 200 hours of her
Stanford life in that auditorium. But picture this: a
student who goes to every Sunday flick and every
political meeting and every dramatic presentation,
and who took Hum Bio 10, and performed in
shows in Mem Aud as well, could spend closer to
400 hours there in four years.
Dear Bug Me,
A few months ago a Daily reporter filed 112 reedom
of Information requests in Washington concerning
Stanford faculty members' research <without con
tacting the faculty members themselves)., Did he ever
find what he was looking for?
- Grouchy Faculty Member
Yes. The reporter in question sought the infor
mation, which was about a number of different
research projects, for a story which has not yet
been completed.
The reporter sent to Washington for the intor
mation, instead of or in addition to contacting the
professors here, as another source for his story.
Nothing unusual about that; in fact, it's just
another Daily example of good journalism.
1 have more questions, but at the moment no
more answers. So until next week, which I promise
will be warmer than this week, don't work too hard,
enjoy the weekend, read the Daily, and have a
happy birthday, Erin M.!
This has been Bug Me, brought to you from the
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Building,
Stanford, CA 94305. And I have been . . .
