I received a couple of rather mind-boggling
questions this past week, so let's turn directly to the
business at hand, rather than allow my verbose
tendencies to deprive you of the excitement you ve
been expecting.
Which is more dangerous, LSD or psychedelic
mushrooms? Also, is it true that half a mushroom
will produce much the same effect as an average
dosage of LSD?
- Spaced
Of course, the answer to the first inquiry de
pends upon how you define dangerous, said Dr.
Vincent D'Andrea of Counseling and Psychologi
cal Services (CAPS). Dispensing with semantics,
however, he said that 200 micrograms or more of
LSD, which anjounts to a psychedelic dosage,
would probably be more dangerous in general
terms. He was referring to immediate problems,
sqch as possible loss of control, panic, disorienta
tion and the possibility of having flashbacks.
» D'Andrea said that one : half of a Psyilocyb
Mexicana. or Mexican mushroom (the offender to
which you refer. 1 presume), would have nowhere
near the effect of LSD.
According to D'Andrea, one must ingest up to
12 of the magic toadstools for a psychedelic experi
ence. The introduction of the mushrooms into the
body is typically followed by nausea, wild hilarity,
mood changes and then a prolonged period up to
four or five hours of vivid images, D'Andrea said.
During those phantasmagoric hours, one would see

colors, unysual patterns, etc., and would frequently
view these images from a perspective of flying or of
a great height. The whole process culminates in a
let-down and fatigue.
In conclusion, one-half of a psychedelic mus
hroom would induce nausea and probably nothing
more. D'Andrea said.
Here's a question I had intended to run long ago.
Are lesbihns less susceptible to cervical cancer
than heterosexual women?
Dr. John Dorman at Co Well said that, indeed,
the incidence of cervical cancer should be less fre
quent in lesbians than in heterosexual or bisexual
women simply because statistics reveal a correla
tion between cervical cancer and early, frequent
intercourse. He did hasten to add, though, that he
didn't think the subject had ever been specifically
studied.
As a counter-example to this use theory in some
forms of cancer, Dorman said that, for some
reason, studies have shown nuns to be more prone
to endometrial cancer, cancer of the uterine lining,
than sexually active women. So, there could be
cancer of both use and disuse, lie said.
Well, it looks as if that's all I can cram into this
abbreviated space for this time. Keep all those
cards and letters pulsating into this office. Until the
next intriguing episode, write to : On Call, The
Stanford Daily, Storke Publications Bldg., Stan
