# Students performs climbing feats
## 
### Conrad Bock Staff Writer 
Most people on campus have
noticed the rock climbers testing
their skills on the University
walls. One of them is Jim Collins,
a senior here in math sciences
and a nationally acclaimed
climber.
During a recent demonstra
tion here, Collins showed that
rock climbing is extremely de
manding in terms of time, con
centration and pain. Listening to
his stories of bloody hands,
chemically treated lingers and
"maximally pumped" muscles,
one must wonder about his moti
vations.
Fame seems to have some
thing to do with it. Collins has
generated a nationwide reputa
tion for his ability by repeatedly
stunning the climbing commun
ity. Some of his most famous
climbs were done, he said, be
cause they were'declared be
forehand to be nearly or abso
lutely physically impossible.
Yet. he added, this motivation
is difficult to admit to other clim
bers because there is an unwrit
ten ethic that a rock climber
should not climb for competitive
reasons.
According to Collins, the guid
ing principle oi most climbing
groups is that "climbing should
not be intense." the goals being
"to find spiritual enlightenment,
see God and definitely do many
drugs while climbing." Collins
said these communities have
greeted him with much an
tagonism. generally directed at
his zeal and achievements.

He called this attitude an es
sential hypocrisy because there is
actually so much competition
within the groups that the objec
tion of Ins not being "one with
the rock" is only a cover.
Collins said he generally does
not climb with such cultish
people. He finds "a less than sub
tle pressure" to perform and to
attempt climbs for no other
reason than that it is expected of
him.
When this happens, however,
the satisfaction and purpose ot
climbing are lost, he said. As an
example he pointed out a person
who "burned out on climbing"
because he was just checking
famous routes off an achieve
ment list.
Challenge
1 ast year. Collins began climb
ing with Tony Yaniro, who Col
lins said proved to be a better
climber than he was.
But "once we got past that
stage of competing with each
other — that took about a week
— and just became friends and
climbed together, respected each
other's abilities and made up for
each other's defects in certain
areas, that's when we both de
parted from the regular climbing
scene in Yosemite," Collins said.
The motivation for some
climbs does not come from other
climbers, Collins said. In Sep
tember I 978, the break-up of a
long-standing relationship had
set the emotional stage for a
climb. Then Collins climbed
without aid or protection (free
soloed) a prominent route in El
Dorado Canyon, Colo., called
The Naked Edge. It is about 800

feet above rock and in parts is
negatively sloped. Asked about
the consequences of slipping,
Collins replied, "you die."
"At the time, school didn't
make any difference to me. I'd
done some of the climbs I
wanted to do. I basically didn't
care it I got chopped or not."
Self-deception
Nonetheless, Collins said, he
had to hide what he was doing
from himself. "It's an insane act
. . .your mind would melt" if you
thought about it while you were
doing it.he said. By "breaking it
down" and "taking it bit by bit. it
becomes more reasonable."
To this day. there is some con
troversy over whether Collins
really free-soloed The Naked
Edge. But he said that it does not
matter if anyone else believes
him: the climb was completely
self-motivated.
Collins was careful to em
phasize that personal reasons

alone will not keep one going at
the highest level of dittieulty.
"There are standards that are set
that are extraneous to your en
joyment of climbing." he said.
"There are times when you re
ally wonder why you're sticking
your fingers in these cracks that
feel like they're going to rip them
off. If it wasn't for the fact that
it's a (highest rated)»elimb, you
wouldn't be doing it."
As an example, Collins
pointed to Yaniro's completion
of a climb in Lover's Leap, Calif.,
called lite Grand Illusion. "It's a
40-foot horizontal roof with a
fingertip (wide) crack shooting
through it. Nobody's been about
to get more than 10 feet on it.
Tony knew that it was the har
dest crack climb in the world. It's
hard to say 40 falls over days and
days of work is called en joyment.
That level of difficulty has to
have another element to push
you."

people. He finds "a less than sub
tle pressure" to perform and to
attempt climbs for no other
reason than that it is expected of
him.
When this happens, however,
the satisfaction and purpose ot
climbing are lost, he said. As an
example he pointed out a person
who "burned out on climbing"
because he was just checking
famous routes off an achieve
ment list.
Challenge
1 ast year. Collins began climb
ing with Tony Yaniro, who Col
lins said proved to be a better
climber than he was.
But "once we got past that
stage of competing with each
other — that took about a week
— and just became friends and
climbed together, respected each
other's abilities and made up for
each other's defects in certain
areas, that's when we both de
parted from the regular climbing
scene in Yosemite," Collins said.
The motivation for some
climbs does not come from other
climbers, Collins said. In Sep
tember I 978, the break-up of a
long-standing relationship had
set the emotional stage for a
climb. Then Collins climbed
without aid or protection (free
soloed) a prominent route in El
Dorado Canyon, Colo., called
The Naked Edge. It is about 800

feet above rock and in parts is
negatively sloped. Asked about
the consequences of slipping,
Collins replied, "you die."
"At the time, school didn't
make any difference to me. I'd
done some of the climbs I
wanted to do. I basically didn't
care it I got chopped or not."
Self-deception
Nonetheless, Collins said, he
had to hide what he was doing
from himself. "It's an insane act
. . .your mind would melt" if you
thought about it while you were
doing it.he said. By "breaking it
down" and "taking it bit by bit. it
becomes more reasonable."
To this day. there is some con
troversy over whether Collins
really free-soloed The Naked
Edge. But he said that it does not
matter if anyone else believes
him: the climb was completely
self-motivated.
Collins was careful to em
phasize that personal reasons

alone will not keep one going at
the highest level of dittieulty.
"There are standards that are set
that are extraneous to your en
joyment of climbing." he said.
"There are times when you re
ally wonder why you're sticking
your fingers in these cracks that
feel like they're going to rip them
off. If it wasn't for the fact that
it's a (highest rated)»elimb, you
wouldn't be doing it."
As an example, Collins
pointed to Yaniro's completion
of a climb in Lover's Leap, Calif.,
called lite Grand Illusion. "It's a
40-foot horizontal roof with a
fingertip (wide) crack shooting
through it. Nobody's been about
to get more than 10 feet on it.
Tony knew that it was the har
dest crack climb in the world. It's
hard to say 40 falls over days and
days of work is called en joyment.
That level of difficulty has to
have another element to push
you."

Most people on campus have
noticed the rock climbers testing
their skills on the University
walls. One of them is Jim Collins,
a senior here in math sciences
and a nationally acclaimed
climber.
During a recent demonstra
tion here, Collins showed that
rock climbing is extremely de
manding in terms of time, con
centration and pain. Listening to
his stories of bloody hands,
chemically treated lingers and
"maximally pumped" muscles,
one must wonder about his moti
vations.
Fame seems to have some
thing to do with it. Collins has
generated a nationwide reputa
tion for his ability by repeatedly
stunning the climbing commun
ity. Some of his most famous
climbs were done, he said, be
cause they were'declared be
forehand to be nearly or abso
lutely physically impossible.
Yet. he added, this motivation
is difficult to admit to other clim
bers because there is an unwrit
ten ethic that a rock climber
should not climb for competitive
reasons.
According to Collins, the guid
ing principle oi most climbing
groups is that "climbing should
not be intense." the goals being
"to find spiritual enlightenment,
see God and definitely do many
drugs while climbing." Collins
said these communities have
greeted him with much an
tagonism. generally directed at
his zeal and achievements.

He called this attitude an es
sential hypocrisy because there is
actually so much competition
within the groups that the objec
tion of Ins not being "one with
the rock" is only a cover.
Collins said he generally does
not climb with such cultish
people. He finds "a less than sub
tle pressure" to perform and to
attempt climbs for no other
reason than that it is expected of
him.
