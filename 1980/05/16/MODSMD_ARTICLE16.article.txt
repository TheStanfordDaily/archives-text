# I'm really supposed to be a fireman
## 
### 
I've spent 11 years trying to
get a so-called higher education,
and now it turns out it was all a
mistake. I got the letter telling
me so from my high school
career counselor last week. He
explained that he had made a
slight error in arithmetic when he
computed mv test scores 13
years ago. He said I'm actually
supposed to be a fireman and not
a physical chemist. I should have
figured something like this was
going to happen.
The first thing I wanted to be
was a road builder. When I was
five years old some men came to
pave the dirt road past our
house. 1 used to watch them all
day long in order to learn the
proper way to build roads. They
used to let me till their water jug
when it was empty.
1 owned a toy front-end loader
and my brother had a dump
truck and a road grader. We
formed a partnership to build
roads in the vacant lot next door.
1 did all the digging and loading,
and he did the hauling and grad
ing. He never liked grading much
though. He only liked driving his
dump truck.
One dav I was being especially
careful when loading his truck.
Each time I dumped a load I
lifted the bucket again and tap
ped it against the side of his truck
in order to shake free the dirt
stuck in the bucket. My brother
got angry and said I was trying to
scratch his truck.
1 said I was just tring to do it
right, and to prove my point I
dragged him over to watch the
grownups work. He stopped
worrying about scratches, but he
mumbled something about m\
being slow as an old lady.
While waiting for one load he
got impatient. He went to the
garage and got his shovel. He

finished loading his truck with it.
i was furious.
"What an idiot." 1 said.
Don't you know anything? You
can't fill a dump truck with a
shovel."
"Why not?" he said. "It beats
waiting for you all day."
"Did \ou ever see the real
road builders fill a truck with a
shovel?" I asked.
"No."
"Of course you haven't," 1
said, because it would take all
day. So how can you use a
shovel?"
"Because it's faster. It onh

takes me two scoops, but It takes
you ten minutes for a rush job."
I was exasperated. "Don't you
even know how to play?"
"Sure." he said. "A lot better
than you. You don't even sound
like a loader. You sound more
like a washing machine."
After the fight we both got
spanked. A week later my
brother traded his road grader
for a front-end loader of his own.
He started his own company and
squeezed me out of the business.
That was the end of my career as
a road builder.
This brings us to the 10th
grade when I had to ha\e an in
terview with the career coun
selor to find out what I was sup
posed to be when I grew up. I had

to take about a dozen tests be
fore the interview. It was very
scientific.
When I entered his office. Mr.
Oliver was examining my folder.
Apparently someone had just
told him a funny story because he
was trying without much success
to stifle a laugh. 1 sat down and
waited for him to regain control
of himself. He dried the tears of
laughter from his eyes and began
the interview.
"So what do you want to be?"
he asked.
"1 think I'd like to be a stand
up comedian." 1 said. "I like

Jonathan Winters a lot."
Mr. Oliver began laughing
again. He must like Winters too,
1 thought. Then Mr. Oliver
shook his head.
"I'm afraid not." he said. "It's
not listed here."
-1 sank in my chair. "How
about a poet?" I asked.
"Nope. 11 says here you've got
to be a physical chemist."
"What'sa physical chemist?" I
asked.
"Beats me." he said. "But I'm
not the one who has to become
one. You are."
"Isn't there anything else on
the list?"
"I'm sorry," said Mr. Oliver.

"That's it. Good luck."
That was 13 years ago. Then
last week I got the letter from
Mr. Oliver saying I'm really sup
posed to be a fireman.
Frankly. I'm not very pleased.
I'm not sure 1 want to run into
burning buildings. In fact I'm
sure I don't. I've always been
somewhat of a coward. I might as
well get used to the idea though.
There's no point in complaining.
And I'm sure there must be be
nefits. Maybe I'll get to drive a
ladder truck and operate the si
ren. I've always wanted to oper
ate a siren.
Mr. Oliver called last night,
collect.
"I'm really sorry about all
this," he said. "1 never was good
at arithmetic. I hope you under
stand."
"It's all right." I said. "If it
weren't this it would be some
thing else I suppose. I don't
blame you."
"You're too kind," said Mr.
Oliver. "Some of the others
didn't take it as well as you."
"The others?" I asked.
"'You remember Floyd An
drews? He was a wild animal
trainer."
"Was?" I asked.
"The letter got there a day late
I'm afraid. He was really sup
posed to be a pianist. It looks like
he will recover, but as they say,
he'll never play the piano again."
"That's terrible," I said.
"Yes," said Mr. Oliver."They
really must do something about
speeding up the mail."
