# THE
						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Alan Siff Rotate fraternity houses 
### 
I applaud Gelpi, et. al, (Daily,
May 9) for their column on the
Greek system. Although 1 have
read numerous opinions on this
subject during the past month,
most of these have combined to
form what appears to be constant
bickering back and forth bet
ween Greek members and
non-members (I, with no doubt,
can now be included here).
It is refreshing to read a more
detached and objective view
point from faculty members; yet,
I found that they almost failed to
mention one major area of dis
crimination concerning frater
nities that all of us are particu
larly conscious of this time of the
year â€” housing.
Every year fraternities occupy
some of the most attractive
houses on campus, and because
of the frats' selection process for
members, the privilege of living
in these houses is unavailable to
many.
The housing discrimination
not only affects men who are not
allowed in fraternities, but also
blatantly affects all women. Take
three hypothetical freshmen:
two men (one receives a frat bid
and the other does not), and a
woman. All three will be un
guaranteed their sophomore
year and they all draw approxi
mately 4988 in the housing
sweepstakes.

The male who receives a bid
pledges and, for the next three
years, lives in a carpeted two
room double overlooking Lake
Lag. Both the unaccepted rushee
and the woman, however, do not
have this same opportunity toes
cape the dire consequences of
drawing such a lousy number.
They will be fortunate if they get
into the assignable pool for Santa
Clara or even Belmont.
Not only does the new pledge
get to live on campus, but he will
occupy a highly desirable resi
dence. By what fiat do the frats
have the privilege to occupy
these beautiful University-owned
houses year after year? (Theta
Xi and Sigma Chi do own their
own houses but the University
has the right to buy them back.)
If the need for a separate,
all-male, fraternity living unit is
valid, why must they necessarily
reside in these prime loctions?
Why not allow everyone a
chance to live in these houses,
rather than limiting this oppor
tunity to those whtl satisfy the
whims of "ding" committees?
1 haJf-seriously propose a plan
that might correct this inequity,
just one of the many perpetrated
by the fraternity system: alterna
tion or rotation of fraternity
housing throughout campus.
Through some random process
or draw, fraternities would be as
signed to different houses annu

ally. In addition to basic justice,
there are other social benefits of
this plan.
Say, for instance, that the
Betas are assigned to two all
male floors in Cedro. Such a
move would bring frat members
in closer daily contact with the
men and women of the surround
ing Wilbur dorms (currently
most fraternities are adjacent to
one another). Conversely, the
residents of Wilbur would ob
serve the fraternity and many
might realize that most frat men
are real individuals after all.
If the Zetes, for instance, were
assigned to Serra, their present
house would be opened to those
who are lucky enough in the
draw. The result would be that
women and non-frat men would
also have an opportunity to live
in this house (the house up-keep
might also improve).
Maybe the KAs could get
Cardenal, or Theta Delts could
be assigned to Naranja. This
might also work to the advantage
of fraternities; the Dekes could
get 558 Mayfield (this would be
closer to Terman).
There would be complications
to such a proposal, but in all seri
ousness, it would be more equit
able than the present system. As
for sororities, they can keep
Manzanita Park.
