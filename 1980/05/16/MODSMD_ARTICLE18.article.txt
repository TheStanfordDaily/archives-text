## Cubans vote with their feet 
### 
Radio Havana denounced
them as "delinquents, homosex
uals, gangsters, vagrants, and
parasites," hut the ten thousand
refugees on the Peruvian em
bassy grounds weren't troubled
by these epithets. They had more
practical problems like where to
sleep and what to eat. The Peru
vians couldn't feed them because
to buy food in Cuba you need
ration tickets. When the Cuban
government delivered food, at
first anti-Castro militants de
fiantly hurled it back over the
compound fence. Eventually the
refugees were eating stray cats
and dogs, begging for fish bones
from each other to make soup,
and consuming the embassy's
papaya tree, root and branch.
Meanwhile in Miami
thousands marched in the streets
in support of the refugees, and
tons of food and clothing and
tens of thousands of dollars were
collected to help them. Then as
the air shuttle for refugees broke
down amid diplomatic bickering,
Miami's Cuban-Americans

raised additional tens of
thousands of funds and risked
lives and boats in stormy seas to
aid those seeking to escape to
freedom.
The immense numbers of Cu
bans seeking to leave were
dramatic testimony to conditions
on the island, ll one may quote
Lenin in this context, the re
fugees were "voting with their
feet." Typical complaints were
that the economy was depressed,
that there were few oppor
tunities for young people, and
that politics pervaded every as
pect of life, leaving no room for
privacy or autonomy.
Cuba's social system is
deemed by some to be progres
sive, but it is a system built
around rank and status. Splendid
privileges are granted, in the
words of Le Monde's Marcel
Niedergang, to "civil servants,
high-ranking officials, members
of the Party apparatus, technical
experts, doctors, to all in short
who belong to the 'new' class
which dares not breathe its
name."
Originally the plan of Castro
and Che Guevara had been to
run the economy on slogans,
medals for Stakhanovite heroes
of labor, and obligatory work
weekends. The result: a com
plete breakdown of the economy
— and the imposition of ration
ing on food, healthcare items,
and virtually all consumer goods,
even tobacco. The New York
Times notes Cuba is poorer now
than before Castro's 1959 re

volution. To reconstruct the
economy after this debacle, the
Cuban government is turning to
"parallel markets" for many
goods and giving permission for
professionals to sell their ser
vices after hours. Such recogni
tion of the prosaic laws of
economics is, of course, neces
sary. But this change has under
mined the revolutionary elan of
the regime and induced it to turn
to military action in Afria as a
way of hanging on to political
legitimacy and maintaining pub
lic enthusiasm.
The American government —
apparently deciding to see if it
could at least partially rival the
Cubans in the practice of tyran
nical ineptitude — has re
sponded to the refugee exodus
by denouncing those helping the
refugees to escape by boat. "Pri
vate American citizens are sub
stituting their own judgment on
who should be allowed into this
country for the judgment of
Congress," announced a State
Department spokesman with
callous self-importance.
Threatening refugee-runners
with $2000 fines, five-year
prison sentences, and confisca
tion of their boats is certainly a
despicable way to respond to this
human tragedy. As the mayor of
Miami put it, we should let them
in or we should tear down the
Statue of Liberty.
