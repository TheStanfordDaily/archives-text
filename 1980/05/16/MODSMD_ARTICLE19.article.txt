Arrests were just
If there were a male who hung
around women's bathrooms at
night and solicited women as
they entered and performed sex
ual acts with them in the stalls. I
believe the Stanford community
would be unanimous in its disap
proval and offer no regrets about
the deviants' subsequent arrest.
Why is it. then, that people can
condone homosexual fellatio in
public places and not its
heterosexual counterpart?
Many will argue that they arc
not condoning the behavior of
the males recently arrested here,
but rather disagreeing with the
inconsistency of the law's en
forcement. This is specious
reasoning. The morality of an act
does not depend on whether one
gets caught or not. but rather de
pends on the agent's rational de
cision to commit that act. These
men were fully aware of the na
ture of their acts, and by commit
ting them put themselves at the
mercy of the law in no less a
manner than you or I must ac
cept the consequences, when we
willfully exceed the speed limit.
Looking at this principle in a
different setting, I would find it
hard to believe that anyone
could argue that the police are
not justified in arresting a drunk
driver on Interstate 5. even if that
same driver has been driving
drunk on that particular road for
months straight without ever
having been pulled over.
What is the difference, I then
ask. between this inconsistent
application of the law and the
one involving the 10 men ar
rested here? The gay community
has a right to be proud of its part
in our community, but I would
feel embarrassed if they (or any
one else in the community)
claimed that these men should
not be arrested and their main
cry was discrimination.

How many of these people
would yell '"foul play" had these
10 been arrested for performing
sexual acts in the women's bath
room?

No Saudi oil
The relationship* between
Saudi Arabia and the United
States is dictated by economic
factors devoid of any moral con
siderations. The exploitation of
foreign countries by the United
States is nothing new. Our de
pendence on Saudi Arabian oil is
new.
The monarchy of Saudi
Arabia is not milking the poor; it
is milking the country's re
sources. Most of the people are
receiving little of the new wealth.
I lealth care and education in the
remote villages have not im
proved since the exportation of
oil. Bedouin tribes are being dri
ven off territories for land ac
quisition by the princes. Maldis
tribution of wealth in this coun
try. if not unrivaled, is extreme.
While this may be obvious to
liberals and a fact of life to con
servatives, our own human rights
are being threatened by such
economic friendship. Saudi
Arabia has "asked " us to forgo
our right to view the television
drama "Death of a Princess."
The fabled Mobil Oil has also
asked us to forgo this right.
Ronald Reagan summarizes
the United States' policy towards
this monarchy. He says we shall
not tolerate any aggression,
either internal or external, to our
friends who are in power now in
Saudi Arabia. Where does this
leave the people outside of the
royal family? I am distressed
when someone so close to being
president (John Anderson,

where are you?) disclaims any
right of a people to control their
own destiny because we like
doing business with the present
regime.
The price of oil is high but the
price of our dependence is even
higher. Personally, I'd rather
ride my bicycle.

Arrests disturbing
We, the undersigned members
of the Stanford faculty, are very
much disturbed by the recent ar
rests of 10 men for alleged "lewd
and lascivious acts" in mens'
rooms here. Our problem is not
with the law or with its enforce
ment as such . but rather the way
in which it was enforced.
Apparently, Stanford Police
Capt. Raoul Niemeyer had
reason to believe that the acts
had been going on for some time,
and yet had never before en
forced the law. That inaction
created, as The Stanford Daily
rightly put it, a "climate of at
least implied tolerance." Then,
suddenly, without warning and
quite arbitrarily on a particular
weekend, officers made the ar
rests that will probably lead to
the serious damage of 10 lives.
The timing as well as the na
ture of the action strikes us as
extremely unfortunate. Early in
June the voters in Santa Clara
and San Jose will decide whether
or not discrimination in housing
and employment because of sex
ual preference should be prohi
bited. Because the sensational
character of these arrests has
made them the subject of exten
sive coverage in the media, those
favoring discrimination against
homosexuals got the kind of
political ammunition they are
looking for in their campaign.

If the objective was to deter
this kind of activity in the future,
surely it could have been
achieved in a much less destruc
tive way by issuing warnings to
those whose acts were observed
and by posting warnings that, as
of a certain date, these places
would be under police surveil
lance and arrests made. It is this
kind of humane approach to the
law that we have come to expect
in the Stanford community and
that the Stanford Police De
partment have so admirably, be
fore this incident, adopted.

Shows depravity
I am incensed by the article
you chose to run in The Stanford
Daily on May 9,1980, under the
headline "Cubans enticed, rush
to U.S." Written by a Nicholas
Lemann, and reprinted from The
Washington Post, this article is a
blatant and disgusting example
of the kind of propaganda-qua
journalism that is the stock-in
trade of communist "news" or
gans.
In particular, Lemann would

have us believe that the Cubans
presently fleeing their home
land, often at great personal
peril, "are leaving primarily in
response to inflated expectations
of economic betterment here,
rather than in search of political
freedom." Accordingly, "there
emerges the view that thousands
of people fleeing Cuba in boats is
not particularly an adverse re
flection on Castro."
Indeed, "most people who
have been in Cuba stress Cas
tro's decision to allow people
who left the country in the 1960s
to return to visit their families as
a factor in the current wave of
migration." For these visitors,
"with their tales of Gloria Van
derbilt jeans, digital watches and
toaster ovens, created an 'in
vidious comparison' between
economically depressed Cuba
and prosperous America."
Never mind why America is
prosperous and why, some 20
years after his social experiment
began, Castro's Cuba is a disas
trous failure: we don't want to
impugn Castro; we want instead
to deptict his victims as greedy
materialists, who would risk
their lives and the lives of their
loved ones for Gloria Vanderbilt
jeans and Big Macs.
This is either profound ignor
ance of human nature, or it is,
more likely, the pure depravity
of the product of ideological
blindness. But in either case, I
am appalled that the Daily,
which has lately been so con
cerned about its "good name,"
should reprint such a piece of
trash. That it appeared first in
The Washington Post, given the
recent history of that journal on
Cuban reporting, is hardly jus
tification. We expect more from
the Daily.
