# World mission seeks out pandas

PEKING â€” More than 10 percent of all
giant pandas have been killed by starvation
or earthquake since 1975, prompting an in
ternational rescue mission to save the world's
most beloved and endangered animals.
A team led by Chinese scientists and ex
perts from the World Wildlife Fund, which
uses the panda as its symbol, left Peking this
week for an unprecedented trip into the
natural mountain habitats of the world's
1000 remaining bear-like, white-and-black
spotted creatures.
The official New China News Agency said
on the eve of the trip that a survey of panda
reserves in southwest China concluded that
13S of the animals died in 1975 and 1976
from an earthquake and the sudden dying
out of arrow bamboo, "the panda's main
food." The bamboo died naturally after a
once-a-eentury blooming, and naturalists
here fear that other bamboo species in the
area might follow suit.
The Chinese news agency, describing the
effects of the disappearing food supply, said
"when a panda is terribly hungry, it will sit
quietly waiting for death with both front
paws round its head."
"The panda is the World Wildlife Fund
symbol and the national treasure of China, so
if the panda disappears, the moral blow to
the environmental movement would be de
vastating," said George Schaller, conserva
tion director of the New York Zoological
Society and tine of the expedition leaders. "If
we can't save a spectacular animal like the
panda, what the hell are we doing?"
Although the arrow bamboo blossoms put

out seeds that sprout new bamboo, "it will
take several years for the bamboo to grow big
enough for the pandas to eat," Schaller, a
zoologist specializing in endangered species,
said. "In winter they only have bamboo to
eat. The snow is on the ground and all the
other plants are dead."
The Chinese news agency reported re
cently that villagers in the mountainous bor
der area of Sichuan and Gansu provinces
tried in I 977 to save some pandas by captur
ing them and feeding them rice, corn,
potatoes and some bamboo shoots. "This
often presented difficulties since pandas are
particularly strong and while their tempera
ment is generally mild, a panda that senses it
is under attack will strike back. The animals
were caught by one man dashing toward a
panda and covering its head with a blanket,
while another tied it up."
Pandas live in 10 special protection zones,
eight of them in Sichuan, including the
Wolong reserve, where the World Wildlife
Fund group is going. The other two reserves
are in Gansu and Shaanxi provinces. Pandas
have attracted world attention for centuries
and were regularly plundered by foreign
hunters and zoo-keepers in the early part of
this century. A movie scheduled for produc
tion this year. The Lady and the Panda, is the
first U.S.-China co-production and will tell
the story of one of those earlier panda hunts.

Since the communists reunited China in
1949, access to the pandas has been severely
restricted. Peking occasionally has used gifts
of pandas, such as the two now at the Na
tional Zoo in Washington, to enhance Chi
na's image abroad. There are now 35 pandas

in captivity around the world.
Besides Schaller the World Wildlife 112 und
party includes fund Chairman Sir Peter
Scott, the British conservationist and wildlife
painter, and Nancy Nash, the fund's liason
officer who made most of the initial contacts
with the Chinese. They will apparently be the
first foreigners to visit the pandas in their
natural habitat since 1M49, though dozens of
researchers and filmmakers have been seek
ing permission to visit the reserves.
Schaller said they plan to spend at least a
week camping in the Wolong reserve, about
150 miles west of the provincial capital of
Chengdu. "One reason the Chinese want to
collaborate on this project is that they're re
ally worried about the future of the panda,"
Schaller said.
Schaller said the trip would allow his group
to collect as much information as possible
from the local Chinese naturalists and from a
survey of the scene "so we can set up an
action plan" to curtail further starvation. He
said it might be possible to organize a system
of bringing food out to the solitary creatures
or follow the strategy of capturing them and
keeping them fed during the winter.
Schaller said the bamboo usually propo
gates by shoots, but once every 40. 70. 80. or
sometimes 100 years puts forth flowers and
seeds and then dies away. There are records
of these same plants going to seed in the
1 X7(K and I N.SOs. In the past, before China's
latest population boom, pandas could range
somewhat farther to find food. In the Pleis
tocene era, about 10,000 years ago. pandas
were found all over eastern China, as far
north as Peking.
