## Flyers even up Cup series 
### 
PHILADELPHIA (AP)
Paul Holmgren and Bob Kelly
scored four goals in a 1:15 span
of the first period to trigger the
Philadelphia Flyers to an N-3
rout of the New York Islanders
last night and even their National
Hockey League championship
series at one game apiece.
The Islanders, however, went
home satisfied.
They got what they came for in
this best-of-seven game series, a
split on Philadelphia's home-ice,
an advantage it took the Flyers
<S() regular-season games to ac
quire.
The third and fourth games in
the battle for the Stanley Cup
will be on the Islanders ice in
Uniondale, N.Y., Saturday and
Monday nights.
The Islanders picked up where
they left off in winning the series
opener Tuesday night. 4-3 in
overtime, when they took a 1-0
lead at 3:23 of the opening
period.
Butch Goring shot from the
slot sending Philadelphia goalie

Pete Peeters to his knees. The
puck, however, came back to
Goring who scored from inside
the left circle before Peeters
could get up.
Philadelphia tied it at 7:22 on
Holmgren's first goal, a five
looter just 1 5 seconds before the
end of a power play.

At K:37. almost before the
sellout crowd of 17,007 had
stopped cheering the equalizer,
Kelly took the deflection of a
Behn Wilson shot in the right cir
cle and slapped it past Islanders'
goalie Billy Smith.
That sent the l ivers ahead 2-1
and they never trailed.
