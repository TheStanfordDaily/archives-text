# The
						Friday Interview
## Bourne and his Stanford career 
### 
(Editor's note: Lloyd Bourne has wanted to
play professional tennis since he was N
years-old. He wants it very badly. Hat at the
same time the Stanford senior has never
played in the No. / spot for the ( ards and this
year was demoted to N0..? after a poor start.
/ hough he lias by no means forfeited any
chance in the pros, this season lias been a
disappointing one for him. In this Friday In
terview with Sid Spaeth, Bourne elaborates
on this and the r<fst of his Stanford career.)
Spaeth: This is your last year at Stanford.
What do you plan on doing next year?
Bourne: I m definitely going to play the pro
tour for a couple of years and sec how it
works out. At the end of two years I'm gonna
make a decision and sort of ask myselt two
things: I) 'Am i making the kind of money I
want to make?,' and 2) 'Am I happy doing
this?' You have to travel 30 or 40 weeks a
year and I might not like that, so I'm just
gonna give it a shot and see how it goes.
Spaeth: How long has it been since you
wanted to play professional tennis?
Bourne: Since I was about 14 I've sort of had
it in the back of my mind that I wanted to play
pro tennis. It's a good feeling because it's
always been such a long-term goal and now
it's right around the corner so I'm pretty
excited about it.
Spaeth: You have played in pro tournaments
before, but next year tliey become much more
important. Are you apprehensive about this at
all?
Bourne: Definitely not apprehensive — ex
cited, yes, because it will be a nice feeling to
be finally able to take a check. And hopefully
it won't be for 25 or 30 dollars. The way I
look at it, I really have nothing to lose and

everything to gain, so there is really no
reason to he apprehensive.
Spaeth: If you couldn't make it in the pro's,
what would you like to do?
Bourne: Business school is a possibility.
Either that or get into some other aspect of
tennis — management or something like
that. That's not in the forefront of my mind
right now. Right now, my first love is defi
nitely, wanting to play and see how that goes.
Spaeth: What do you think you have to do to
get your game ready for the pro's?
Bourne: I think by the time you get to a
certain point, pretty much everybody can hit
a forehand and a backhand. It's a question of
who's mentally tough and who isn't, or how
hungry you arc, or not. There are guys who
are fantastic players in college and then
they 'll hit the pro circuit and not do that well.
But there are also guys who are just so-so in
college and they start doing great in the pro's.
It's definitely your frame of mind.
Spaeth: When you first came here, what kind
of role did you expect to play?
Bourne: I thought it might be doubtful
whether 1 was going to play freshman year. I
was not expected to play freshman year and I
thought that after that 1 could work my way
into the line-up and maybe get to play to
wards the top at the end. Coming to Stanford
was a question of possibly not playing, but
having great guys to practice with and mov
ing your way into a really strong line-up.
Either that or going to a smaller school and
being a big fish in a small pond. You have to
make that decision. I think I made the right
choice; I know I made the right choice.
Spaeth: What have been the highlights of your
Stanford career?

Bourne: Definitely winning the NCAA's for
those two years (1977 and I 978) and the two
singles matches I played in Maples last year
— my first time playing in Maples. I can
remember when I was a senior in high school
coming up here and seeing the matches in
Maples and saying, "God, I'd like to play
here someday." Playing in there for the first
time is really incredible.
Spaeth: A lot of people have been saying that
this has been an off year for yon, how do you
respond to that?
Bourne: It has not been as successful as I
wanted. That's sort of hard to judge, though,
because successful as I wanted probably
would mean I wouldn't want to lose a match
all year. I feel I'm ready for the NCAA's, and
the fact is, we're all in the NCAA's as indi
\ iduals and the team is seeded No. 1. Now is
when the final push comes, so the season
hasn't been fantastic, but could suddenly be
great the last week or so. This is when it
counts.
Spaeth: Were you disappointed or frustrated
when you were moved down to No. 3 earlier
this season?
Bourne: Obviously, being moved from your
position is tough to handle. You know, it's
pride and the whole bit. but realistically,
when I looked at it. Tim (Mayotte) was play
ing fantastic and has been playing great ten
nis all year. Ile deserved a chance to play too.
I was disappointed for myself, but I also
realized Tim was playing well and deserved
the chance.
Spaeth: Besides playing in Maples, have you
reached any goals while you were here'.'
Bourne: It you talk to me after the NCAA's,
I can let you know better. I mean, that's my
main goal — I'd like to win the NCAA's.
