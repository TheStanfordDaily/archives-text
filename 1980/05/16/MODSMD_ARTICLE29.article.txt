The Stanford men's track and
field team sends nine athletes to
the annual California Relays
Saturday at Modesto in their
final effort of the year before the
Pac-1 0 championships.
"Our goal at Modesto is to get
people prepared for the confer
ence championships and to get
some qualifying performances
for the NCAA's" stated Brooks
Johnson, the men's head track
coach.
"Modesto"s got a good, fast
track, and the weather should be
excellent, also. We'll be looking
to do some of the things that we
weren't able to do last
weekend." The Cards competed
in the West Coast Relays at
Fresno last weekend, but were
hampered by'poor weather con
ditions and a slow track.
Cardinals to look for this
weekend will Ite sprinters Darrin

Nelson and Gordon Banks, as
they will anchor the Stanford
team ol competitors. Moth Nel
son and Banks are scheduled to
participate in the 100 and 200
meters, as well as both the 4 x
100 and 4 x 400 meter relays.
Johnson gave special note to
senior Banks, the captain ol the
team. "We'll be expecting a good
race out of Ciordv in the 200
especially because he's still one
tenth of a second off of the time
necessary to qualify for the
NCAA's."
"I'm confident that he'll do
well and make it though, espe
cially now that he has his situa
tion squared away with pro foot
ball. There's been a fantastic dif
ference in Ins performance now
that lie realizes that he'll get a
shot in the pros. He's been able
to loosen up a lot more now that
he doesn't feel that constant
pressure."
Johnson also expects good
performances in the 4 \ 100.
"where we're just off a qualify
ing time," and the hammer,
where Stanford will have both
Dave Thomson and standout
Rick Buss competing.
Last week. Buss, the Cards'
potential top point winner this
weekend, uncorked a toss of
210-5 in the hammer, where he
owns a personal best of 219-3.
But he also came up with a
lifetime record in the discus,
where lie threw IKO-6.
Johnson and the Cards will
also be using the weekend to rest
up some people for the Pac-IO
Championships. Among the
athletes Stanford will leave
home, are middle-distance stars
John Schaer and Tom Lobsinger.
and steeplechase specialist Bill
Haldeman.
Haldeman ran to a fourth
place finish at last week's West
Coast relays with a clocking of
9:04.
"We're leaving our distance

people home because we're
satisfied with where they
are,"Johnson said. "They've
been running hard ever since
August and this weekend gives
us an opportunity to allow them
a break and let them rest up for
the Conference Cham pi on

ships."
The Pac-10 Championships
will be held the weekend of May
23-24 in Seattle on the campus
of the Uni\ ersit\ of Washington.
It will he the final meet of the
year for the Cards, except for the
NCAA Championships.
