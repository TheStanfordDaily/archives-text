# Nixon — the Lakers' unsung hero

"Savoir Faire."
Norman Nixon tried to hang
that nickname on Spencer
Haywood, he of the exotic inter
national wardrobe. But
Havwood and kareem Abdul-
Jabbar decided that the name fit
Nixon better, so now lie's known
to his Laker teammates as plain
old "Sav
The dictionary defines the
term as "Capacity for approp
riate action; especially a polished
sureness in social behavior."
That's Nixon. Single, popular
with the ladies, sharp dresser,
glib vet always cool, that slightly
drooping eyelid giving him the
appearance of someone who
notices everything that's going
on. and knows which fork to use
for the salad.

If ever a player figured to take
this town by storm, to do a
number on Los Angeles like
Walt Frazier did on New York, it
was Norman Nixon.
His savoir faire is e\ erywhere.
on the court and oft. He is more
colorful than Jamaal Wilkes,
more accessible and approacha
ble than Magic Johnson, quicker
than Mike Cooper, able to
change the course of mights
ballgames with his bare hands,
leaps tall buildings with a single
bound . ..
Yet somehow. Norm Nixon,
disguised as a mild mannered
co-point guard for a great met
ropolitan basketball team, has
eluded the spotlight as success
fully as Clark Kent.
Magic Johnson unitentionally
took away part of Nixon's game

at first. There was a painful
period of adjustment. And de
spite the team's success, Norman
Nixon remains just another
player to the outside world.
Not that he's complaining.
Laker owner Jerry Buss has
shown his appreciation by rewrit
ing and extending Nixon's once
embarrassing contract.
However. Nixon wouldn't
mind a little notoriety. Consider
the credentials. Despite his frail
appearance (6-1. 170). he played
more minutes than any one in the
league, per game. He aver
aged 1 7.0 points, giv ing the Lak
ers a starting backeourt that
scored 3b points a game.
Even though he shared the
basketball with Magic. Nixon
averaged 7.S assists, fourth high
est in the league and tops in the
Western Conference. He shot
5 1 .0 percent despite the fact that
the outside fallaway jumper is his
favorite weapon.
He is; according to Laker
coach Paul the quar
terback of the team's fast break:
the I akers' "energizer." <
So why the lack of publicity?
"If you look at my game."
Nixon savs. "it's not geared to
pleasing the crowd, so I'm easily
overlooked. I might go to the
hoop, but it's nothing spectacu
lar. ev identlv."
A reporter points but that Ni
xon's drives can be as spectacular
as those of any guard in the
league.
■Then why don't you write
it'. 1 " Nixon savs with a slight
smile. "I haven't read that in
vour paper I'll have every repor
ter in the country come up to me
and tell me I should have made
the All-Star team. They tell me.
but they don't write it."
Early this year, after establish
ing himself as one of the league's
premier point guards his first two

seasons, Nixon found himself
struggling with a new role.
The Lakers drafted a rookie
who was also a ballhandling
guard, and even before the first
basketball was tapped in training
camp, then-coach Jack McKin
ney announced that Magic would
be running the show from the
point guard position.
"To take a guy and make hnn
change his whole game." Nixon
said, "that was realk hard, really
a struggle. 1 did it, but it wasn't
real comfortable. The last month
and a halt ot the season. Magic
and I started to learn to comple
ment each other, but it wasn't
easy."
Now the Lakers have a unique
situation — co-point guards. It's
like ha\ ing two quarterbacks on
the football field at once.
"We had to learn to keep each
other in the game," Nixon says.
"He's (Magic's) better setting up
some situations because of his
size, and I'm faster and have a
jump shot. We both create diffe
rent types of problems, we can
both pass and score."
