California's men's and women's crews are both favored to retain
their titles as defending champions in the Pacific-10 Rowing Champ
ionships this weekend at Stanford's home course of Redwood Shores.
Stanford, which suffered a sound defeat at the hands of Cal last
weekend, will sport entries in the women's varsity and novice divi
sions. and the men's varsity, lightweight, and freshman classes. The
Cardinals will begin their bid for the championship tomorrow morn
ing against the University of Washington.
Stanford's freshman four are coming off a fourth place finish out of
a field of 16 at the Western Sprints held at Newport Beach last
Monday and Tuesday. At one point in the Sprints' finals the Cards
were ahead in the race by a full length, but lost the lead in the last 500
meters. UCLA was the first boat to finish followed by Orange Coast,
Irv ine, and Stanford.
Also representing Stanford in the Sprints were a lightweight four.
Neither qualified for the finals.
The Pac-10 Championships will be the "culmination of the sea
son." according to varsity head coach Phil Waters.
"We have a chance to do pretty well." the coach noted, adding,
"we will probably finish fifth. Realistically, that's where we can
probably end up."
Waters, in his first year as head coach, remarked about the season.
"The program as a whole is coming along, but there's faster competi
tion this year: the competition is a little bit better.
"I'm satisfied with the team's efforts but not the results. A team is
always shooting for No. 1.
Heats will take place from 7:30 till noon tomorrow continuing with
j the semi-finals from 4:00-8:00. Sunday the finals will begin at 7 ; 3()
a.m.
