"Sushi? That's raw fish, isn't
it?" A visit to Fukisushi will in
deed confirm that first thought,
but perhaps in a surprising way.
Located just a few miles from
campus in a low, unassuming
building, the restaurant serves a
wide variety of authentic
Japanese food, including but by
no means limited to raw fish.
Upon entering Fukisushi, the
first impression is pleasant. The
decor is light, with traditional
bamboo and Japanese prints lin
ing the walls. One also notices a
large percentage of Japanese
patrons, which seemed a good
sign. A basic one-room* seating
area is broken up nicely with a
bamboo partition.
Tables, about twenty of them,
are placed far enough apart to
avoid the sometimes too com
mon feeling of being a part of
your dining neighbors' conversa
tions. While Fukisushi lacks
deep, dark booths, the overall ef
fect is not unromantic.
Our waitress, dressed in an au
thentic kimono, even down to
the slippers, arrived quickly to
light a candle and leave menus,
as well as a tiny dish containing
some odd-looking appetizer,
best describod as a Japanese col
eslaw. Tliis dish was very good,
well-spiced, and not at all oily or
greasy. Only halfway through
eating it did we realize that
chopsticks had been left for that
purpose.
Extensive menu available
The menu, printed in both En
glish and Japanese, is large —
four pages including appetizers,
soups, salads, ippin ryori (a tradi
tional Japanese style one-course
meal), a la carte items, dinners
and sushi. Also, the sushi can be
ordered either by the piece from
a printed picture card on the
table (approximately SI a piece)
or in combination plates (rang
ing up to $7.75 for a deluxe as
sortment.)
At a loss, particularly as
Japanese food was new to both
of us, we asked the waitress' ad
vice. Perhaps out of experience
with culinarily-uncultured Wes
terners, she immediately re
commended their Teriyaki,
Tempura and Sukiyaki. We de
cided to trust her judgment.
First, to be somewhat adven
turous we did order Sashimi

($3.75), which is raw fish with
green mustard, and two pieces of
Fibi sushi, raw shrimp. Other
sushi, perhaps 30 varieties, are
offered, including tuna, red
snapper, as well as such exotic
items as squid and salmon roe.
For the benefit of other confused
Westerners, sashimi and sushi
are both raw fish; sushi is simply
served with seasoned rice be
neath.
We also tried sake, Japanese
rice wine (warning: it packs a
whallop!), which isavailable cold
or warm ($2 a glass). We chose

cold, and were served with a
beautiful little ceramic flask and
two wine glasses. (Nearly all the
serving pieces were especially
beautiful at Fukisushi.) We were
also given ice, which we sup
posed was to be poured into the
sake.
The sashimi, tuna, octopus
and mackerel were presented
with a simple lemon and vegeta
ble garnish, very carefully ar
ranged. The sushi, two huge
shrimp flayed over small mounds
of rice, with a garnish of what
turned out to be paper-thin
ginger, was nearly as pretty.
Both are served with soy sauce
and a HOT green mustard.
Our waitress offered silver
ware, but we elected to
with our chopsticks. Once any
mental reservations are over
come, this fish seems to be an
immediately acquired taste.
Were it not for the dinner to
come, we would have ordered
more.
We were reminded of that
dinner by what seemed the arri
val of salad, and almost im
mediately thereafter, soup. (All
dinners come with both; they
may be had for $2 extra with a la
carte items.) In fact, if we had a
major complaint with Fukisushi,
it was this too-quick service.
Dishes came on top of one
another, and often we felt
rushed, almost prompted to
hurry and begin the next course.
As there was no line for tables,
this seemed unnecessary and
may not have been intentional.
The salad, basically lettuce

and tomato with a light but sav
ory house dressing, was good,
though'it seemed distinctly un-
Japanese. The soup, served in
individual covered containers,
was a clear stock with a miso base
(fermented soybean), with mus
hrooms and other vegetables.
Japanese people generally
pick up the container with both
hands to drink it, our waitress
told us obligingly. Though the
soup sat while we finished our
appetizers and salads, the covers
kept it quite hot. It had an un
usual but wonderful flavor. The

chef obviously knows his spices.
Our dinners, again arriving
midstream, were as we now ex
pected, beautifully presented.
Sukivaki ($7.75), sliced prime
rib, vegetables, yam noodles,
bamboo, wheat and soy cakes,
came in sauce in a handsome iron
pot. The prime rib was very lean,
tender and flavorful, while the
noodles had a flavor reminiscent
of, but far exceeding, ramen. The
dish on the whole was quite tasty.
Its ingredients were served not in
stew form, but compartmen
talized. creating an attractive
mosaic effect.
The Salmon Teriyaki and
Tempura dinner ($8.50), only
steak and chicken are listed but
you may substitute, was served
on separate small plates. The
salmon, good fish in a pleasant
but not outstanding Teriyaki
sauce, was accompanied by a
wedge of ripe pineapple, tomato
and a surprising but tasty bit of
macaroni and fruit salad.
Tempura is top quality
The Tempura was perhaps the
meal's highlight. Two lightly bat
tered fried shrimp (and I do
mean lightly — there was hardly
a resemblance to the greasy,
heavy shrimp often encountered
in restaurants), were arranged
with pieces of vegetables, zuc
chini. carrot, cauliflower and as
paragus, dipped and fried in the
same batter. Again, it was very
attractive and delicious. A small
dish of tempura dipping sauce
accompanied this dish.
Green tea js'provided with
dinners, served in small, intricate

and heavy iron teapots. Our
waitress refilled it without our
even needing to ask. After giving
up on the sake wc had also or
dered a Kirin beer ($1.25) and a
glass of Pagoda brand house
wine ($1.25). fukisushi also
serves an Almaden house wine.
There are a tew additional
Japanese wines, including plum,
but no hard liquor of any kind.
Desserts include sherbet,
fresh fruit (pineapple our night),
and green tea ice cream. We
would have liked to sample this
last, but unfortunately they were
out of it for the evening.
Prices high or low
Overall, Fukisushi is an enjoy
able experience. The most
Americanized palate and the
most adventurous should both
be satisfied. It is not inexpensive:
two would have no' trouble in
running up a $30 tab, especially
with sushi or other appetizers.
On the other hand, you could get
away with less.
Fukisushi would definitely be
a nice change from a Surt and
Turf rut. The food is very good to
excellent, as well as being often
literally beautiful, and it is satis
fying without being heavy. All
but the heaviest eaters are likely
to feel full but not stuffed.
For an introduction to real
Japanese food, beyond the
show-biz variety, it is worth a try
— Fukisushi.

"Sushi? That's raw fish, isn't
it?" A visit to Fukisushi will in
deed confirm that first thought,
but perhaps in a surprising way.
Located just a few miles from
campus in a low, unassuming
building, the restaurant serves a
wide variety of authentic
Japanese food, including but by
no means limited to raw fish.
Upon entering Fukisushi, the
first impression is pleasant. The
decor is light, with traditional
bamboo and Japanese prints lin
ing the walls. One also notices a
large percentage of Japanese
patrons, which seemed a good
sign. A basic one-room* seating
area is broken up nicely with a
bamboo partition.
Tables, about twenty of them,
are placed far enough apart to
avoid the sometimes too com
mon feeling of being a part of
your dining neighbors' conversa
tions. While Fukisushi lacks
deep, dark booths, the overall ef
fect is not unromantic.
Our waitress, dressed in an au
thentic kimono, even down to
the slippers, arrived quickly to
light a candle and leave menus,
as well as a tiny dish containing
some odd-looking appetizer,
best describod as a Japanese col
eslaw. Tliis dish was very good,
well-spiced, and not at all oily or
greasy. Only halfway through
eating it did we realize that
chopsticks had been left for that
purpose.
Extensive menu available
The menu, printed in both En
glish and Japanese, is large —
four pages including appetizers,
soups, salads, ippin ryori (a tradi
tional Japanese style one-course
meal), a la carte items, dinners
and sushi. Also, the sushi can be
ordered either by the piece from
a printed picture card on the
table (approximately SI a piece)
or in combination plates (rang
ing up to $7.75 for a deluxe as
sortment.)
At a loss, particularly as
Japanese food was new to both
of us, we asked the waitress' ad
vice. Perhaps out of experience
with culinarily-uncultured Wes
terners, she immediately re
commended their Teriyaki,
Tempura and Sukiyaki. We de
cided to trust her judgment.
First, to be somewhat adven
turous we did order Sashimi

($3.75), which is raw fish with
green mustard, and two pieces of
Fibi sushi, raw shrimp. Other
sushi, perhaps 30 varieties, are
offered, including tuna, red
snapper, as well as such exotic
items as squid and salmon roe.
For the benefit of other confused
Westerners, sashimi and sushi
are both raw fish; sushi is simply
served with seasoned rice be
neath.
We also tried sake, Japanese
rice wine (warning: it packs a
whallop!), which isavailable cold
or warm ($2 a glass). We chose

cold, and were served with a
beautiful little ceramic flask and
two wine glasses. (Nearly all the
serving pieces were especially
beautiful at Fukisushi.) We were
also given ice, which we sup
posed was to be poured into the
sake.
The sashimi, tuna, octopus
and mackerel were presented
with a simple lemon and vegeta
ble garnish, very carefully ar
ranged. The sushi, two huge
shrimp flayed over small mounds
of rice, with a garnish of what
turned out to be paper-thin
ginger, was nearly as pretty.
Both are served with soy sauce
and a HOT green mustard.
Our waitress offered silver
ware, but we elected to
with our chopsticks. Once any
mental reservations are over
come, this fish seems to be an
immediately acquired taste.
Were it not for the dinner to
come, we would have ordered
more.
We were reminded of that
dinner by what seemed the arri
val of salad, and almost im
mediately thereafter, soup. (All
dinners come with both; they
may be had for $2 extra with a la
carte items.) In fact, if we had a
major complaint with Fukisushi,
it was this too-quick service.
Dishes came on top of one
another, and often we felt
rushed, almost prompted to
hurry and begin the next course.
As there was no line for tables,
this seemed unnecessary and
may not have been intentional.
The salad, basically lettuce

and tomato with a light but sav
ory house dressing, was good,
though'it seemed distinctly un-
Japanese. The soup, served in
individual covered containers,
was a clear stock with a miso base
(fermented soybean), with mus
hrooms and other vegetables.
Japanese people generally
pick up the container with both
hands to drink it, our waitress
told us obligingly. Though the
soup sat while we finished our
appetizers and salads, the covers
kept it quite hot. It had an un
usual but wonderful flavor. The

chef obviously knows his spices.
Our dinners, again arriving
midstream, were as we now ex
pected, beautifully presented.
Sukivaki ($7.75), sliced prime
rib, vegetables, yam noodles,
bamboo, wheat and soy cakes,
came in sauce in a handsome iron
pot. The prime rib was very lean,
tender and flavorful, while the
noodles had a flavor reminiscent
of, but far exceeding, ramen. The
dish on the whole was quite tasty.
Its ingredients were served not in
stew form, but compartmen
talized. creating an attractive
mosaic effect.
The Salmon Teriyaki and
Tempura dinner ($8.50), only
steak and chicken are listed but
you may substitute, was served
on separate small plates. The
salmon, good fish in a pleasant
but not outstanding Teriyaki
sauce, was accompanied by a
wedge of ripe pineapple, tomato
and a surprising but tasty bit of
macaroni and fruit salad.
Tempura is top quality
The Tempura was perhaps the
meal's highlight. Two lightly bat
tered fried shrimp (and I do
mean lightly — there was hardly
a resemblance to the greasy,
heavy shrimp often encountered
in restaurants), were arranged
with pieces of vegetables, zuc
chini. carrot, cauliflower and as
paragus, dipped and fried in the
same batter. Again, it was very
attractive and delicious. A small
dish of tempura dipping sauce
accompanied this dish.
Green tea js'provided with
dinners, served in small, intricate

and heavy iron teapots. Our
waitress refilled it without our
even needing to ask. After giving
up on the sake wc had also or
dered a Kirin beer ($1.25) and a
glass of Pagoda brand house
wine ($1.25). fukisushi also
serves an Almaden house wine.
There are a tew additional
Japanese wines, including plum,
but no hard liquor of any kind.
Desserts include sherbet,
fresh fruit (pineapple our night),
and green tea ice cream. We
would have liked to sample this
last, but unfortunately they were
out of it for the evening.
Prices high or low
Overall, Fukisushi is an enjoy
able experience. The most
Americanized palate and the
most adventurous should both
be satisfied. It is not inexpensive:
two would have no' trouble in
running up a $30 tab, especially
with sushi or other appetizers.
On the other hand, you could get
away with less.
Fukisushi would definitely be
a nice change from a Surt and
Turf rut. The food is very good to
excellent, as well as being often
literally beautiful, and it is satis
fying without being heavy. All
but the heaviest eaters are likely
to feel full but not stuffed.

"Sushi? That's raw fish, isn't
it?" A visit to Fukisushi will in
deed confirm that first thought,
but perhaps in a surprising way.
Located just a few miles from
campus in a low, unassuming
building, the restaurant serves a
wide variety of authentic
Japanese food, including but by
no means limited to raw fish.
Upon entering Fukisushi, the
first impression is pleasant. The
decor is light, with traditional
bamboo and Japanese prints lin
ing the walls. One also notices a
large percentage of Japanese
patrons, which seemed a good
sign. A basic one-room* seating
area is broken up nicely with a
bamboo partition.
Tables, about twenty of them,
are placed far enough apart to
avoid the sometimes too com
mon feeling of being a part of
your dining neighbors' conversa
tions. While Fukisushi lacks
deep, dark booths, the overall ef
fect is not unromantic.
Our waitress, dressed in an au
thentic kimono, even down to
the slippers, arrived quickly to
light a candle and leave menus,
as well as a tiny dish containing
some odd-looking appetizer,
best describod as a Japanese col
eslaw. Tliis dish was very good,
well-spiced, and not at all oily or
greasy. Only halfway through
eating it did we realize that
chopsticks had been left for that
purpose.
Extensive menu available
The menu, printed in both En
glish and Japanese, is large —
four pages including appetizers,
soups, salads, ippin ryori (a tradi
tional Japanese style one-course
meal), a la carte items, dinners
and sushi. Also, the sushi can be
ordered either by the piece from
a printed picture card on the
table (approximately SI a piece)
or in combination plates (rang
ing up to $7.75 for a deluxe as
sortment.)
At a loss, particularly as
Japanese food was new to both
of us, we asked the waitress' ad
vice. Perhaps out of experience
with culinarily-uncultured Wes
terners, she immediately re
commended their Teriyaki,
Tempura and Sukiyaki. We de
cided to trust her judgment.
First, to be somewhat adven
turous we did order Sashimi

($3.75), which is raw fish with
green mustard, and two pieces of
Fibi sushi, raw shrimp. Other
sushi, perhaps 30 varieties, are
offered, including tuna, red
snapper, as well as such exotic
items as squid and salmon roe.
For the benefit of other confused
Westerners, sashimi and sushi
are both raw fish; sushi is simply
served with seasoned rice be
neath.
We also tried sake, Japanese
rice wine (warning: it packs a
whallop!), which isavailable cold
or warm ($2 a glass). We chose

cold, and were served with a
beautiful little ceramic flask and
two wine glasses. (Nearly all the
serving pieces were especially
beautiful at Fukisushi.) We were
also given ice, which we sup
posed was to be poured into the
sake.
The sashimi, tuna, octopus
and mackerel were presented
with a simple lemon and vegeta
ble garnish, very carefully ar
ranged. The sushi, two huge
shrimp flayed over small mounds
of rice, with a garnish of what
turned out to be paper-thin
ginger, was nearly as pretty.
Both are served with soy sauce
and a HOT green mustard.
Our waitress offered silver
ware, but we elected to
with our chopsticks. Once any
mental reservations are over
come, this fish seems to be an
immediately acquired taste.
Were it not for the dinner to
come, we would have ordered
more.
We were reminded of that
dinner by what seemed the arri
val of salad, and almost im
mediately thereafter, soup. (All
dinners come with both; they
may be had for $2 extra with a la
carte items.) In fact, if we had a
major complaint with Fukisushi,
it was this too-quick service.
Dishes came on top of one
another, and often we felt
rushed, almost prompted to
hurry and begin the next course.
As there was no line for tables,
this seemed unnecessary and
may not have been intentional.
The salad, basically lettuce

and tomato with a light but sav
ory house dressing, was good,
though'it seemed distinctly un-
Japanese. The soup, served in
individual covered containers,
was a clear stock with a miso base
(fermented soybean), with mus
hrooms and other vegetables.
Japanese people generally
pick up the container with both
hands to drink it, our waitress
told us obligingly. Though the
soup sat while we finished our
appetizers and salads, the covers
kept it quite hot. It had an un
usual but wonderful flavor. The

chef obviously knows his spices.
Our dinners, again arriving
midstream, were as we now ex
pected, beautifully presented.
Sukivaki ($7.75), sliced prime
rib, vegetables, yam noodles,
bamboo, wheat and soy cakes,
came in sauce in a handsome iron
pot. The prime rib was very lean,
tender and flavorful, while the
noodles had a flavor reminiscent
of, but far exceeding, ramen. The
dish on the whole was quite tasty.
Its ingredients were served not in
stew form, but compartmen
talized. creating an attractive
mosaic effect.
The Salmon Teriyaki and
Tempura dinner ($8.50), only
steak and chicken are listed but
you may substitute, was served
on separate small plates. The
salmon, good fish in a pleasant
but not outstanding Teriyaki
sauce, was accompanied by a
wedge of ripe pineapple, tomato
and a surprising but tasty bit of
macaroni and fruit salad.
Tempura is top quality
The Tempura was perhaps the
meal's highlight. Two lightly bat
tered fried shrimp (and I do
mean lightly — there was hardly
a resemblance to the greasy,
heavy shrimp often encountered
in restaurants), were arranged
with pieces of vegetables, zuc
chini. carrot, cauliflower and as
paragus, dipped and fried in the
same batter. Again, it was very
attractive and delicious. A small
dish of tempura dipping sauce
accompanied this dish.
Green tea js'provided with
dinners, served in small, intricate

and heavy iron teapots. Our
waitress refilled it without our
even needing to ask. After giving
up on the sake wc had also or
dered a Kirin beer ($1.25) and a
glass of Pagoda brand house
wine ($1.25). fukisushi also
serves an Almaden house wine.
There are a tew additional
Japanese wines, including plum,
but no hard liquor of any kind.
Desserts include sherbet,
fresh fruit (pineapple our night),
and green tea ice cream. We
would have liked to sample this
last, but unfortunately they were
out of it for the evening.
Prices high or low
Overall, Fukisushi is an enjoy
able experience. The most
Americanized palate and the
most adventurous should both
be satisfied. It is not inexpensive:
two would have no' trouble in
running up a $30 tab, especially
with sushi or other appetizers.
On the other hand, you could get
away with less.
Fukisushi would definitely be
a nice change from a Surt and
Turf rut. The food is very good to
excellent, as well as being often
literally beautiful, and it is satis
fying without being heavy. All
but the heaviest eaters are likely
to feel full but not stuffed.

Japanese food, beyond the
show-biz variety, it is worth a try
