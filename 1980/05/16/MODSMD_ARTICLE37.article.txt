# Fung Lum: truly Chinese

Fung Lum Restaurant
1815 S. Bascom Ave.

Picture this: you are seated
in an elegantly decorated din
ing room. The walls are hung
with Chinese murals and
brass carvings; the ceiling is
done in ornate tile; and in one
corner, water trickles'into a
small pond filled with gold
and orange carp. Where are
you? Taiwan? Hong Kong?
San Francisco? Wrong-o!
You're in Campbell! Where? ,
Campbell — it's a city 25 mi
nutes south of Stanford
(thereby putting itself on the
map).
"Fung Lum." meaning"
"maple grove" in Chinest. is
the name of a small village
surrounded by maple trees in
South China. The restaur
ant's founding family came
from this village and estab
lished the first of their re
staurants in Hong Kong in
1950.
The architecture and decor
are authentically Chinese. All
of the artifacts and much of
the building materials were
brought over from China:
from the brass-reliefed doors,
to the blue silk ceiling in the
bar, to the woks.
Before our feast com

menced, our host took us on a
tour of the restaurant. He
showed us banquet facilities
and elegant private dining
rooms that can he reserved
for intimate parties. Ol spe
cial interest was the observa
tion room, where we witnes
sed the skillful preparation of
our dinner.
Speaking of dinner, ours
was chosen specially by our
entertaining captain, Mr.
Johnson Lai. We began with
an exotic concoction called
Shredded Duck and Vegeta
bles Soup. Far from your
basic Campbell's Chunky
Vegetable Soup, this tasty
blend included ginger, lemon
peel, sea cucumber, bamboo
shoots and black mushrooms.
While the lone caucasian
of our group tried to finagle
a pair of chopsticks from a
waiter, many more dishes
began appearing on the table.
Firs"t to arrive was prawns in
spicy Szechuan sauce, a
pleasantly spicy version of
sauteed prawns smothered in
a thick, tomato-base sauce.
Tasty, yet not overpowering
to the "steak and potatoes"
palate.
This was a good comple
ment to the lemon chicken, a
Fung Luni specialty, and
rightly so. This deep-fried

chicken in a sweet and tangy
lemon sauce was nirvana
while warm, but its appeal
waned as it grew cooler. The
problem was quickly forgot
ten with the arrival of piping
hot mixed mushrooms and
snow peas. These typically
Chinese vegetables stood out
from the usual version. The
pairing of crisp snow peas,
cooked to perfection, with
sott, tender mushrooms was a
good choice.
Fung Lum Special
Spareribs. another house spe
cialty, are a must for gour
mands and gourmets alike.
Their cured, barbequed
flavor rounded out our main
course selection as well as our
figures.
Our meal was a good rep
resentative sampling but only
made a small dent in Fung
Lum's extensive menu. Prices
were comparable to high
class restaurants rather than
your favorite take-out. but
the service, atmosphere and
tastv dishes warranted it.
Our positive impressions
were confirmed bv the rest of
the patrons, the majority of
whom were Asian.
