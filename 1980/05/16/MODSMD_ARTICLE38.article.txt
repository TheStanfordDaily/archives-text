Chinese Gourmet
220 University Ave.
Palo Alto
The five happinesses of an
cient Chinese living were
prosperity, high position,
long life, wealth and good
luck. Mr. Patrick Wang, the
owner of Six Happiness, has
added a new happiness, "Ex
cellent Chinese Dining." And
indeed, Mr. Wang takes great
pride in insuring this excel
lence.
The atmosphere itself is
fairly typical of most Chinese
restaurants, with the inside
decorated by paintings and
other artifacts from Taiwan.
But what makes Six Happi
ness stand out from other
Chinese restaurants on the
Peninsula is its superior food.
Mr Wang offers over 300 dis
hes, many of which are not
listed on the menu. You can
choose anything from the
basic Six Happiness chow
mein to the more exotic fresh
squid with black bean sauce.
Six Happiness also has a
number of appetizers and
soups to choose from, al
though you may run into
trouble if you order too much
in advance of the main dishes
— good-sized portions are
served. If you do choose to

order a soup, however, there
are a number of these to
choose from.
Every day Mr. Wang (who
is also the master chef) and
his cooks prepare a new soup
of the day, as well as the more
traditional Chinese soups. If
you are feeling adventurous,
try the shark fin soup, al
though you have to order it in
advance and it is not cheap
($l2). We had the hot and
sour soup, which was very
spicy but quite delectable.
Next we had the favorite of
every Chinese gourmet,
mooshu pork (the Chinese
burrito). The pancakes are
prepared and stuffed quite
skilfully by your waiter. The
result is delicious.
We then had what is known
as egg white blended with
mashed chicken breast and
seafood delight. Don't let the
name fool you. This rich dish
made of chicken, shrimp,
abalone and various other
seafoods served in a savory
sauce is very tasty and has an
added extra of being very
high in protein. This is ohe of
a number of dishes you can't
find anywhere else.
We also had the dry
braised fish (seasonal), which
is a whole rock cod served and
boned at the table (all the fish
is fresh and comes in four

times weekly), shredded beef
in garlic sauce served with
shredded carrots and green
onions (this is a very spicy
dish), and shrimp balls.
The shrimp balls were ex
cellent, and I highly recom
mend them. Biting intoone of
these shrimp balls, which are
deep fried in a spicy hot
sauce, is like biting into a
piece of heaven. The experi
ence is really quite sensual.
We ended our meal with
pot stickers. These are a
pancake-like dough stuffed

h s ®
sty twpwess

.with pork and Chinese cab
bage. They are steamed, fried
until crispy and served with a
little oil and vinegar. They
were very succulent.
During our meal we had
the house wine, which was
very good, and tea. There are
also a number of Chinese and
Taiwanese beers to choose
from. Although we didn't try
any (by this point we were so
full that we were wondering

whether we'd ever be able to
get up and leave), there are a
number of desserts to choose
from. Chilled lichee, glazed
bananas and apples, jeweled
rice pudding and almond tofu
are among those on the menu.
Six Happiness also has a
different luncheon menu and
a carry-out service. The
V.l .P. Luncheon is offered on
weekdays, and for $2.95 you
get soup, tea, fortune cookie,
and three dishes of your
choice. Six Happiness' prices
are right about in the middle

for Chinese restaurants, but it
is the quality of the food that
is the real attraction.
Prosperity, high position,
long life, wealth and good
luck are things each of us
would like to have some day.
The sixth happiness, Mr.
Wang's excellent Chinese di
ning, can be yours now and is
located only a mile from cam
pus.
