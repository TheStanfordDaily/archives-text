# New eatery praised for exquisite cuisines

### 
The Black Oak
2515 El Camino
Palo Alto
327-0684
The Black Oak, serving a vari
ety of exquisite Continental
cuisines, blends into the scenery
of the many restaurants crowded
onto El Camino. But for the true
epicurean, this one is special and
ought to be tried. This semi
formal, semi-expensive restaur
ant is part of a chain which
travels through Vacaville and
Robles.
Right next door to the very
first eatery grew a huge, white
oak tree. Thus, since the last
name of one of the founders
happened to be "Black," the
name became "The Black Oak."
This particular restaurant on
Palo Alto's main drag replaced
"The Shirt-tail" about a year and
a half ago.
Upon entering the fairly mod
ern dining room, one first sees
the plush, jungle-like garden in
the back. Although it doesn't
quite measure up to an oak tree,
it does make for a pleasant at
mosphere.
The menu is very well
rounded, including everything
from surf and turf, to pasta and
poultry. My date and I started
with a decanter of house wine

(choice of rose, chablis or bur
gundy). A decanter for two was
too much for us but tasted very
good.
We ordered Sauteed Prawns
Bordelaise as an appetizer. It
was cooked to succulent perfec
tion, sauteed in butter, garlic and
fresh lemon. Some other availa
ble appetizers are Escargot

Bourguigon ($3.95), Sauteed
Chicken Livers ($2.75), and As
paragus Spears, Broccoli or
Cauliflower Hollandaise
($2.25). The menu is divided
into three parts: the Charcoal
Broiler Specialties, the Entrees
and the Daily Specials.
The New York Cut Steak
($11.95) from the Broiler Sec
tion is thick and juicy, andserved
with a choice of soup or salad
(the salad is great), fresh garden
vegetables (cauliflower and car
rots), sliced potatoes, bread and
butter and a beverage. This part
of the menu also includes an
array of other cut steaks: Petite
Top Sirloin ($8.95), Petite Filet
Mignon (slo.so),ThickTopSir
loin ($10.95) and Lobster Tail

and Sirloin ($14.95).
Entrees are served with the
same choice of soup or salad,
mixed vegetables, bread and but
ter and a beverage. There is a
wide choice ranging from Lin
guini Cacciucco prepared with
shrimp,crab and clams, sauteed
with white wine, herbs, shallots
and mushrooms ($7.95) to Veal
Piccata with Capers sauteed with
white wine, lemon and shallots
($10.75), to Scalone Dore
(sauteed abalone and scallops,
$9.25), and Lobster Tail and
Prime Rib (Fri., Sat, and Sun.
$15.95). Every, entree sounds
equally interesting and delicious
as described on the menu.
The waiter will also announce
the specials, which change daily.
The list is so extensive that it is
difficult to remember them on
the first recital. They include an
array of fresh fish, poultry, etc.,
prepared in many different
methods.
I had Roast Duck, which was
tenderly cooked in a glaze sauce.
As a skeptical one for duck, I
really enjoyed it. Prices of the
Specials are not mentioned.
No matter how full you are,
you must order dessert, as it is so
delicious here. I had the best
Chocolate Mousse I've ever
eaten. Other favorites are the
Kitchen Style Chocolate Orange
Cake served warm with vanilla
ice cream (Ymmm . . .), the
Chef's Cheesecake, Caramel
Custard, and Fresh Strawberries
with ice cream ($1.75 each).
The Black Oak is so easy to
find and close to campus that my
guest and I rode our bikes there.
Open for lunch Monday thru
Friday from 1 1 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
dinner Monday through Thurs
day from 5 to 10 p.m.. Friday and
Saturday from 5 to 10:30 p.m.,
Sunday from 4 to 9 p.m., and for
brunch on Sunday from 10:30
a.m. to 3 p.m.; reservations are
appreciated. Live entertainment
is offered on Friday and Satur
day nights.

cuisines, blends into the scenery
of the many restaurants crowded
onto El Camino. But for the true
epicurean, this one is special and
ought to be tried. This semi
formal, semi-expensive restaur
ant is part of a chain which
travels through Vacaville and
Robles.
Right next door to the very
first eatery grew a huge, white
oak tree. Thus, since the last
name of one of the founders
happened to be "Black," the
name became "The Black Oak."
This particular restaurant on
Palo Alto's main drag replaced
"The Shirt-tail" about a year and
a half ago.
Upon entering the fairly mod
ern dining room, one first sees
the plush, jungle-like garden in
the back. Although it doesn't
quite measure up to an oak tree,
it does make for a pleasant at
mosphere.
The menu is very well
rounded, including everything
from surf and turf, to pasta and
poultry. My date and I started
with a decanter of house wine

(choice of rose, chablis or bur
gundy). A decanter for two was
too much for us but tasted very
good.
We ordered Sauteed Prawns
Bordelaise as an appetizer. It
was cooked to succulent perfec
tion, sauteed in butter, garlic and
fresh lemon. Some other availa
ble appetizers are Escargot

Bourguigon ($3.95), Sauteed
Chicken Livers ($2.75), and As
paragus Spears, Broccoli or
Cauliflower Hollandaise
($2.25). The menu is divided
into three parts: the Charcoal
Broiler Specialties, the Entrees
and the Daily Specials.
The New York Cut Steak
($11.95) from the Broiler Sec
tion is thick and juicy, andserved
with a choice of soup or salad
(the salad is great), fresh garden
vegetables (cauliflower and car
rots), sliced potatoes, bread and
butter and a beverage. This part
of the menu also includes an
array of other cut steaks: Petite
Top Sirloin ($8.95), Petite Filet
Mignon (slo.so),ThickTopSir
loin ($10.95) and Lobster Tail

and Sirloin ($14.95).
Entrees are served with the
same choice of soup or salad,
mixed vegetables, bread and but
ter and a beverage. There is a
wide choice ranging from Lin
guini Cacciucco prepared with
shrimp,crab and clams, sauteed
with white wine, herbs, shallots
and mushrooms ($7.95) to Veal
Piccata with Capers sauteed with
white wine, lemon and shallots
($10.75), to Scalone Dore
(sauteed abalone and scallops,
$9.25), and Lobster Tail and
Prime Rib (Fri., Sat, and Sun.
$15.95). Every, entree sounds
equally interesting and delicious
as described on the menu.
The waiter will also announce
the specials, which change daily.
The list is so extensive that it is
difficult to remember them on
the first recital. They include an
array of fresh fish, poultry, etc.,
prepared in many different
methods.
I had Roast Duck, which was
tenderly cooked in a glaze sauce.
As a skeptical one for duck, I
really enjoyed it. Prices of the
Specials are not mentioned.
No matter how full you are,
you must order dessert, as it is so
delicious here. I had the best
Chocolate Mousse I've ever
eaten. Other favorites are the
Kitchen Style Chocolate Orange
Cake served warm with vanilla
ice cream (Ymmm . . .), the
Chef's Cheesecake, Caramel
Custard, and Fresh Strawberries
with ice cream ($1.75 each).
The Black Oak is so easy to
find and close to campus that my
guest and I rode our bikes there.
Open for lunch Monday thru
Friday from 1 1 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
dinner Monday through Thurs
day from 5 to 10 p.m.. Friday and
Saturday from 5 to 10:30 p.m.,
Sunday from 4 to 9 p.m., and for
brunch on Sunday from 10:30
a.m. to 3 p.m.; reservations are
appreciated. Live entertainment
is offered on Friday and Satur
day nights.
