# Speaker points to Palestinian 'holocaust'
## Rally marks Palestinian cause 
### Cameron Smith Staff Writer 
"The Palestinian revolution is here
to stay. Peace in the Middle is a
child's dream without an independent
Palestinian state." said the University's
lone Palestinian student Taril Ab
bouslii. at a White Plaza rally yester
day.
The rally, attended by 80 people,
was held to commemorate the
"holocaust" of the Palestinian people,
which began when Israel declared its
independence on May 15, 194N, ac
cording to Hamad Al-Baadi, president
of the Arab Student Association. The
association sponsored the rally.
Abboushi. a graduate student in
engineering-economic systems, said.
"As long as Palestinian rights continue
to be raped, Palestinians will fight back
with a vengeance." He said it might
take "one or two more decades or one
or two more wars" to reach the kind ol
peace he envisions.
Abboushi said he thinks it is unfor
tunate that the only means the Palesti
nians have to regain their losses has
been with force, but he compared their
attitude with a statement made by Is
raeli Prime Minister Menaehem Begin,
in which he said. "We light; therefore.
We are."
Europe's crimes
Abboushi said he recognized that Is
rael was formed in response to the his
toric persecution of Jews, but rejected
the notion that the Palestinians should
pay for what he termed Europe's
crimes against Jews.
He said that the U.N. partition plan
in 1948 gave Israel 57 percent of Pales
tine. but that Jews had made up only
one-third of the population and had
owned just 6 to 7 percent of the land.
"The Palestinians were asked to give
up over one-half of their land in a coun

try the size of New Jersey. Only a luna
tic Arab could have accepted this," he
said.
Abboushi. who comes from the oc
cupied West Bank, said. "There is only
one criterion which decides whether or
not one can become a full-fledged citi
zen ot Israel; that is whether one is
Jewish. I need say no more about ra
cism."
Also speaking was ifh American
woman. Lee O'Brien, a graduate stu
dent in sociology at UC-Berkeley.
A member of the San Krancisco
based Jewish Alliance Against Zionism
and the Palestine Solidarity Commit
tee, a national organization, she said
the United States created the Camp
David peace treaty of 1978 to "pre
serve its political and military
hegemony over the Middle East by
arming Egypt and Israel and neutraliz
ing the revolutionary role of the Pales
tinian resistance."
She said this hegemony was neces
sary to maintain U.S. access to oil.
'Imposed' autonomy
O'Brien said the treaty's plan for
Palestinian autonomy will â€¢"at the
most" allow less than one-third of the
Palestinians to live under "Israeli
imposed autonomy" in less than one
tilth of Palestine (West Bank and
Gaza).
Furthermore, within five years. Is
rael will be able to claim sovereignty,
she said.
She said that in 1 979. after the treaty
was passed, Israel committed acts of
"military terrorism" against refugee
camps and villages in Southern Leba
non with U.S.-supplied lighter jets and
cluster bombs.
The Palestinian raid on Hebron on
May 6 was"targcted against right-wing
settlers of the Gush Emunim move
ment who had conducted numerous
acts of anti-Palestinian violence in re
cent months," said O'Brien.
In fiscal year 1981, Egypt and Israel
are to receive 75 percent of America's
total foreign aid package of $4.9 bill
ion, she said.

She called for Americans to protest
the massive aid to Israel, allotted at the
same time Californians face Proposi
tion 9 next month.
Al-Baadi. a graduate student in edu
cation from Saudi Arabia, spoke on the
necessitv of cooperation between the
Palestinians and other resistance
movements in the world.
He said flic Palestine 1 iberation Or
ganization (PLO) has backed re
\i nation.tries in Iran, 11eland and /im
babwe. while Israel supported the ex
shah of Iran, the "white supremist" re
gime in South Africa and ex-President
of Nicaragua. Anastasio Somoza.
After the rally. David Millstein, an
organizer of the recent Palestinian
Awareness Week here and a member
of yesterday's rally audience, said he
disagreed with Abboushi's defense of
Palestinian violence. but said, "There's
a common opposition to Israeli occupa
tion of the West Bank and Gaza among
some Jews and Arabs in the Stanford
community."
