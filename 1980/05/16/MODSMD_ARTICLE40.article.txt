Friday, kresge 8 & 10 p.m. r
II you've never seen this Ameri
can institution on the big screen,
you're in for a treat. All the glossi
ness of the M(iM studios went into
the making of this technicolor con
fection, and until you've watched it
as it was meant to be watched —
without the wicked commercials —
you've missed half the fun. Judy
Garland sings, Ray Bolger dances,
Jack Haley squeaks, and the great
Bert Lahr purrs. Directed by Vic
tor Fleming.

Alien ****
Sunday, Mem And 7 & 9:30 p.m.
Ridley Scott directed this night
marish science-fiction movie about
a crew of a space craft menaced by
an alien with a penchant for human
flesh. Alien is essentially a bug
eyed monster movie from the '50s
brought up to date; under Scott's
direction, however, it has a punch
and wit that hits even the most
skeptical viewer right between the
eyes. Alien is the best thriller we've
had since Jaws, and the 45-minute
long special effects finale is a sure
fire crowd pleaser. The seven
member cast includes Tom Sker
ritt, Sigourney Weaver and Ver
onica Cartwright.

Tommy ★ ★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
As a movie. Who guitarist Pete
Townshend's allegorical rock
opera about the corruption of a
punk — the "deaf, dumb and
blind" Tommy — magnifies all of
director Ken Russell's strengths
and wcakensscs. The individual
scenes are all huge, loud; they
splatter all over the place. Some of
the resulting fragments miss every
thing and others are right on the
mark. Although the Who get the
message across better live (you
realize that when you hear Oliver
Reed singing). Russell probably
made the best possible movie ver
sion of Tommy, and that's just what
the world's greatest rock band de
serves.
And if you have some extra time
this weekend, see The Kids Are Al
right, a fascinating compilation of
concert and other footage starring
the Who.

All Thai Jazz ★★★
Old Mill
Bob Fosse's thinly veiled exami
nation of his own life and death is
the kind of self-indulgent mistake
that seemingly is doomed to fail.
But Fosse's too damn talented for
that result; frustratingly. the movie
fluctuates wildly — it's often self
conscious. but it's often dazzling
and brilliant.
Fosse's portrayal of himself is
hardly a self-glorifying one; in fact.
Fosse's so intensely critical that it's
hard to get involved with Joe Gi
deon. the Fosse character played
by Roy Schieder. You often feel
like you're intruding oti this some

times strongly personal film.
Schieder successfully captures a
man who's always on, a man of ta
lent who finds his greatest struggles
and his greatest enjoyment in that
talent. But he's more a type than a
multi-faceted character.
The often extraordinary musical
sequence typify All That Jazz. It's
hard to think of something more
self-conscious than a huge dance
number to your own open heart
surgery, and the show-biz schmalt
ziness that Fosse stuffs the sequece
with borders on self-parody. But
Fosse's instincts have a genius of
their own; he must have realized
that he was in trouble from the start
with this movie — but he took it to
the limit anyway.

The Rocky Horror Picture Show
★★
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
The camp classic of the '70s. To
try to describe this entertaining
mess dealing with transvestism and
various other forms of socially un
acceptable behavior would be as
absurd as trying tft L explain its cult*
appeal. Dress appropriately". •
— R.L.
Kramer vs. Krameriritit Va
Old Mill
Writer-director Robert Benton's
movie is for the most part an as
tonishing one. With the interplay
between a brilliant Dustin
Hoffman and a youngsterof almost
frighteningly correct instincts
named Justin Henry as the movie's
heart, Benton constructs a moving,
compassionate, almost Truffuat
like character study of a divorced
man's struggle to love and care for
his son (ancf vice versa).
But there's a gnawing (for me at
least) flaw in the treatment of the
custody case at the end of the film.
After all the care and honesty Ben
ton's invested throughout, why
does he have to load the dice
against the female character
(Meryl Streep)? Her case seems to
have at least as much merit as
Hoffman's, but instead of taking
things head on, Benton backs off
and retreats into an ending that is a
little too neat for its own good.
Streep's extraordinary perfor
mance only accentuates the de
ficiencies in how her character is
written.
Yet in the main, Benton has
done a superb job in taking slender
movie material and creating a
movie of surprising depth and
complexity. Jane Alexander cq
stars. and thesuperb compos) tionfs
the work of cinematographer Nes
tor Almendros.

North Dallas Forty ★ ★
Park, Menlo Park
I his movie can't figure out
whether it wants to be a good ol"
boys comedy (like Semi-Tough ) or
a hard-hitting expose of the crual
life of a football hero. It ends up
being neither.
Virtually the only reason to see

this movie — and it may be enough
— is for Nick Nolte, who forgets
most of his previous macho training
(or cannibalizes it for characteriza
tion value) in his role as a football
star who finally realizes that his
mind is willing to do more than his
nearly crippled and drug-fortified
body can supply.

Apocalypse Now ★ ★★★
Palo Aito Square
An extraordinary work of mad
genius. Producer-director Francis
Coppola exhibits a firmly balanced
intelligence in his reworking of
Joseph Conrad's 1402 novella
Heart of Darkness-, he employs
Conrad's essential narrative but
not his point of view.Aided by the
superb cinematographer Vittorio
Storaro, Coppola creates stunning
images of Vietnam, combining
frightening energy and intensity

with humor, sensuality and over
whelming evil. It's a journey into
almost literal hell that will engross
— horribly fascinate — some, and
turn away others. Apocalypse Now
is, 1 think, the best American movie
of the just-ended decade. It has al
most untenable ambitions, but the
profound questions it confronts
you with justify the seeming crazi
ness of this "impossible." almost
nihilistic, vision of mankind. Star
ring Marlon Brando. Martin
Sheen, Robert Duvall. and Fre
deric Forrest.

Star Trek *★
Mountain View Theatre
Empty apocalyptic rumblings
trom the world champions of greed
— Paramount Pictures. A median

ical creation of man comes back to
haunt him as the darling creature's
quest for knowledge leads it to fi
nally search for its creator. Despite
the seeming epic grandeur of its
plot, the movie really has no
climax, and its ending — where one
of the Enterprise's crew members
saves civilization by gleefully agre
eing to some cosmic sex — is unin
tentionally hilarious. Shatner,
Nimoy and the rest were much bet
ter on TV; on the 70mm screen
they're almost unbelievably
wooden. The rest of the movie is
like a greatest hits of Douglas
Trumbull and John Dykstra's pre
vious special effects set out in
lengthy detail.

Peter Sellers stars as the empty

Clockwork Orange ifkifir
Old Mill, midnight weekend spe
cial
Stanley Kubrick transferred An
thony Burgess' novel to the screen
by making a gruelingly visual film.
Clockwork Orange is a morality
play set in the nearfuture; the issue
at stake is whether individuality is
more important than the society
that must deal with the individual.
Malcolm McDowell stars as a man
whose joy comes mainly from
committing acts of violence; he is
arrested and forced to undergo
"treatment" to make him safe for
society. Kubrick gives no easy
answers to the questions in this sin
gularly disturbing film.

Hair ¥***
Old Mill, weekend midnight spe
cial
A great musical fantasy that's
also a kicky \isual trip. Director
Milos Forman (One Hew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest, Taking Off) works
in a reckless, giddy fashion; he per
fectly captures the timgless, rock
'n' roll, rebellious spirit ol the '60s
and makes it live again. It's a fan
tasy vision of America, but even in
those terms. Hair might be the
truest picture of the '60s ever
made. With John Savage, Beverly
D'Angelo and Treat Williams.

Norma Rtu ir-kirir
Old Mill
Martin Ritt directed this indust
rial drama about a woman who
fights to have a union put in a tex

tile mill where she works Sally
Field gives an assured and very
likeable performance as Norma
Rae; her days as "the Flying Nun"
seem far behind as she breathes lite
into her southern-accented,
rolling-gaitcd character. This is a
"small" movie in the same way that
An Unmarried Woman was small
— the emphasis is more on charao
terization than on action. Ror»
Liebman co-stars as a New N
union agitator

Caligula
Aquarius, Palo Alto
Brought to you by Penthouse In
ternational, Caligula is the
movie that combines big-time stars
(Malcolm McDowell, Peter
O'Toole) with hard-core sex (you
name it). Unfortunately, these two
groups are mutually exclusive and
the audience never learns if
O'Toole is truly deserving of his
surname. This overly violent movie
purports to tell a story of ancient
Rome, but is really about the calcu
lations of buck-hungry magazine
publishers attempting one of his
tory's greatest tie-ins: a moving,
grunting Penthouse. If you want
ancient Rome, watch Ben Hur on
TV. If you want porn, take Caligu
la's $6.00 admission tag and see 24
quarter peep shows. As entertain
ment. Caligula doesn't deliver, and
as art, it is vile.

Manhattan ★ ★★★
New Varsity, tonight
S'Wonderful.
Woody Allen completes his '70s
trilogy with a movie that will rank
as one of the few masterpieces of
the last decade. Manhattan is a bit
terly funny examination of a city
and a lifestyle. It bites close enough
to the bone to be both hilarious and
oddly disturbing.
Directed by Woody Allen. Star
ring Woody Allen. Diane Keaton.
Michael Murphy. Mariel Heming
way and Meryl Streep. Written by
Woody Allen and Marshall
Brickman. Photography by Gor
don Willis. Music by George Ger
shwin.

Annie Hall if if-kit
New Varsity, tonight
A movie about a skinny, red
haired schlemeil comedian with
No-Doz mannerisms 'and a
masochistic wit. Roughly directed,
with a whiney. indulgent tone and a
vaguely disturbing aftertaste. In
short, the best movie Woody Allen
has ever made. For all of their
strengths. Allen films until Annie
had been exercises in comic over
kill. They never let up. and eventu
ally, albeit guiltily, we wish he
would shut up for a minute; Annie
is different in that it lets the ribs rest
from time to time. To use a wildly
revealing phrase, this is a movie
with depth.
—John Nielsen

The War at Home ★ ★★★
Surf Theater, San Francisco
The Vietnam anti-war move
ment's answer to John Wayne and
Joe. You can see this documentary
on unrest at the University of Wis
consin and wallow in nostalgia and
then come home and put on the
Youngbloods or Jefferson
Airplane and wallow some more,
and think about why things have
changed and how they can change
back. Perfect for the '60s freak.
— Seth /.uckerman
Electric Horseman if if if
Century 23, San Jose
Almost constructed as the visual
equivalent of a Willie Nelson song.
The fact that Nelson's one of the
co-stars only enhances the warm,
nearly uneventful, yet somehow
quietly thoughtful feeling of this
Robert Redford-Jane Fonda star
vehicle, l aded rodeo star Redford
advertises breakfast cereal for a
dehumanizing conglomerate; he
rebels by stealing the corporation's
mistreated symbol — a $12 million
thoroughbred. TV newswoman
Fonda doggedly pursues Redford
across the Southwest as he pre
pares to set the horse free. Of
course. Fonda and Redford fall in
love. The performances, especially
Redford's are fine. Sydney Pol
lack's direction is thankfully
economical, and the movie ulti
mately wins you over by avoiding
overt messages and. despite the
prefab elements, maintaining its
charm and good-naturedness
throughout. A completely amiable
movie, and there's nothing much
wrong with that
- R.L.
The Lion in W inter
New Varsity, Saturday
Katherine Hepburn and Peter
O'Toole shriek at each other for
nearly two excruciating hours; if it
weren't for your fondness for the
individual performers, there'd be
no reason to see this broad parody
which confuses bawdiness for wit.
James Goldman wrote the
screenplay; Anthony Harvey tries
(and fails) to keep things under
control. Anthony Hopkins costars.
—R.L.
The Spy Who Loved Me if if if
Tivoli, San Carlos
Even Roger Moore — the low
rent version of James Bond —can't
do much damage to this dazzling
007 thriller. The special effects and
stunts are superb (indeed, after the
first stunt, everything that follows
is almost anticlimactic.) The
Moore-Barbara Bach pairing work
quite well; Bach is easily Moore's
equal, and she adds some tension
and humor to the formulaic brew.
With Richard Kiel as "Jaws," a
character 1 hope will go away.
