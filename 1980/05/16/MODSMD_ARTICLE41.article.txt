Germans endorse U.S. boycott
DUESSELDORF, West Germany — Hie West
German Olympic Committee voted yesterday not to
send a team to the 1980 Moscow Olympics, the
strongest endorsement yet for President Jimmy Car
ter's call for an international boycott.
Carter termed the 59-40 vote "a courageous deci
sion," but a spokesman for the Soviet organizers said
it would have "no effect.'"
The West German government, in thanking the
committee for its endorsement of the official posi
tion. noted the sacrifices of athletes who have trained
only to see their Olympic hopes shattered by the
world reaction to the So\ iet intervention in Afghanis
tan.

created Monday by the Decision of the French
Olympic Committee to join the British in agreeing to
participate in the Moscow Games.
West Germany becomes only the third country
among L'.S. allies in the 15-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to support the boycott. The
other two are Norway and Canada. Besides Britain
and France, two other NATO members, Denmark
and Greece, have decided to go to Moscow.
The committees of Australia, Japan, the Nether
lands and Portugal are among those that have said
they would follow the German lead. They have until
May 24 to notify the organizing committee if they
plan to send a team.

last attempt to prod President Jimmy Carter into a
face-to-face confrontation, said yesterday that he
would withdraw from the Democratic presidential
race if Carter debated him and then won the total
popular vote cast in the eight-state, primary season
finale on June 3. If Carter lost. Kennedv would con
tinue his campaign in the expectation of winning the
nomination.
The White House quickly rejected the idea. Ken
nedy issued his challenge at the Los Angeles Press
Club in a quietly dramatic speech that depicted Car
ter as a failed president who is v irtuallv certain to lose
in November unless he defends his policies in the
Democratic primaries.
The latest Associated Press count gives Carter
1365 delegate \otes at the Democratic National
Convention, with 1666 required for nomination.
Kennedy's total was 770.

June 3, when 696 delegates are up for grabs in
California. New Jersev. Ohio. Montana. New
Mexico, Rhode Island. South Dakota and West Vir
ginia. That is more than one-fifth the total delegates
who will attend the convention in New York this
August.
Bani-Sadr defends Iran military
TEHRAN. Iran — President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr and his right-wing clerical rivals yesterday
traded accusations about alleged I .S.-inspired plans
for a coup to topple the revolutionary government.
The acrimonious but undocumented debate, the
latest display of increasing public animositv between
Iran's secular and religious authorities, centered on
the reliability of the Iranian armed forces. The milit
ary's dependability has been questioned in public and
private since the ill-fated American hostage rescue
operation three weeks ago penetrated Iranian air
space without detection.
Pursuing a plan to scatter the hostages across Iran
to thwart any future rescue attempt, the radical Mos
lem students occupying the U.S. Embassy here an
nounced that an undisclosed number of their captives
have been sent to the city of Hamedan about 220
miles east of Tehran. According to the militants,
groups of hostages are being held in 13 provincial
cities as well as the capital.
Escalating Iran's internal debate in the rescue at
tempt's aftermath was a communique from the hard
line Crusaders of the Islamic Republic group printed
in the right-wing clerical Islamic Republic news

paper. It charged that the United States "probably
intends to stage an internal coup d'etat by its agents in
the Army," which it said had partly infiltrated the top
levels of command.
Reacting for the first time to a flood of rumors
concerning an alleged Iranian radar failure along the
rescue mission's flight path and the controversial
bombing of the abandoned American aircraft by Ira
nian warplanes, Bani-Sadr said: "We cannot use the
existence of these things to arouse suspicions about
the Army and say the whole Army is working for
foreigners, which is not true."
But Bani-Sadr himself contributed to the mood of
suspicion in the interview, originally broadcast Wed
nesday night on radio. He said the Carter administra
tion had infiltrated % Americans and 14 Iranian
residents of the United States to carry out sabotage
over the next two weeks.
Riotous Koreans await reaction
SEOUL, South Korea — Students seeking more
democracy fought running street battles with riot
police that left one officer dead and at least 13 in
jured. Then their leaders met all night, deciding today'
that they had made their point and would M,\\*it go\ -
ernment reaction.
In the third day of clashes Yesterday, the anti
government protests spread from Secrul to five other
cities. There were no reports on student injuries or
arrests.
Prime Minister Shin Hyonhwack. in his first public
reaction to demonstrations that began two weeks
ago, said the government would try to advance its
political development timetable as much as possible
"to meet the people's expectation."
One of the students' major complaints is that the
government has moved too slowly toward greater
democracy.
The prime minister also said in a nationwide
broadcast that further such protests could result in
"economic bankruptcy."
Some demonstration leaders said Shin's statement
was a disappointment and failed to meet their de
mands.
However, student leaders from about 20 univer
sities met throughout the night and announced this
morning that they had called off further demonstra
tions and would Kait for a government response.
State Senate okays Laetrile use
SACRAMENTO — A bill allowing California
doctors to use Laetrile to treat cancer if it can be
proven safe cleared the Senate yesterday despite
claims that the substance is worthless and toxic.
The vote was 23-1 1. two more than the bare major
ity needed for approval in the 40-seat house, on
SBI4BO hy Sen. William Campbell, R-Hacienda
Heights.
It now goes to the Assembly, where a Senate
approved legalization bill by Campbell died in com
mittee in 1977. Another Campbell bill was killed by a
Senate committee last year.
Laetrile is a substance found in the pits of apricots,
peaches, bitter almonds and other plant material. Its
ad\ocates contend cyanide in Laetrile combines with
an enzyme in cancerous cells to kill the cells.
But most of the medical community contends the
substance is worthless and toxic, and current law bans
its use.
An opponent of the bill. Sen. Diane Watson.
D-Los Angeles, said the Legislature should wait until
tests on the effectiveness and safety of Laetrile are
conducted by the National Cancer Institute before
acting.
Congress wavers on import fee
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter yes
terday accused Congress of flinching in the face of
political pressures and breaking commitments by its
leaders to support his new oil-import fee and balance
the budget.
Both houses have made it clear in recent days they
have substantial majorities ready to roll back the
import tee. The Finance Committee and a House

Ways and Means subcommittee voted overwhelm
ingly Wednesday to repeal it.
However, Carter reminded the lawmakers yester
day he imposed the levy "unilaterally" after congres
sional leaders "asked me to" during negotiations last
March over the administration's new anti-inflation
plan.
Congressional sources who were in on the negotia
tions in March confirmed there was "a clear consen
sus" among House and Senate leaders that Carter
should impose the fee. which would raise gasoline
prices 10 cents a gallon.
In the meantime, a U.S. District Court has ruled
the import fee illegal on grounds that Carter chose to
require refiners to pass the levy on to consumers only
in the form of higher gasoline prices. lea\ ing heating
fuel prices untouched.
The levy, which would have raised prices at the
pump yesterday morning had it not been blocked by
the courts, would bring in an estimated $ 10.3 billion
in new revenues each year.
Muskie scoffs at Soviet proposal
VIENNA, Austria — On the eve of his first high
level talks with the Soviets as secretary of state, Ed
mund Muskie yesterday dismissed the latest Soviet
proposal for a solution to the Afghanistan crisis as a
cosmetic propaganda ploy.

where the proposal was quickly rejected soon after it
was broadcast bv the Soviet-backed government in
Kabul, Muskie. in two brief public statements here
and in a separate statement by a spokesman, charac
terized the proposal as a Soviet-engineered bid for
support from the Islamic conference that convened
yesterday in Pakistan.
But the issue may not go away that easily. Muskie is
in Vienna to help celebrate 25 years of Austrian
neutrality. Even ad\ance of Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei A. • nnyko's scheduled arrival today,
the event has taken on the appearance of another
effort at East-West detente.
In varying degrees, European officials here are
say ing, there is likely to be at least a gentle urging by
all that the latest Soviet proposal at least be regarded
as a basis on which to build a dialogue with the
Russians.

Germans endorse U.S. boycott
DUESSELDORF, West Germany — Hie West
German Olympic Committee voted yesterday not to
send a team to the 1980 Moscow Olympics, the
strongest endorsement yet for President Jimmy Car
ter's call for an international boycott.
Carter termed the 59-40 vote "a courageous deci
sion," but a spokesman for the Soviet organizers said
it would have "no effect.'"
The West German government, in thanking the
committee for its endorsement of the official posi
tion. noted the sacrifices of athletes who have trained
only to see their Olympic hopes shattered by the
world reaction to the So\ iet intervention in Afghanis
tan.
The decision removed some of the pessimism
created Monday by the Decision of the French
Olympic Committee to join the British in agreeing to
participate in the Moscow Games.
West Germany becomes only the third country
among L'.S. allies in the 15-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to support the boycott. The
other two are Norway and Canada. Besides Britain
and France, two other NATO members, Denmark
and Greece, have decided to go to Moscow.
The committees of Australia, Japan, the Nether
lands and Portugal are among those that have said
they would follow the German lead. They have until
May 24 to notify the organizing committee if they
plan to send a team.
Kennedy issues debate challenge
LOS ANGELES — Sen. Edward Kennedy, in a
last attempt to prod President Jimmy Carter into a
face-to-face confrontation, said yesterday that he
would withdraw from the Democratic presidential
race if Carter debated him and then won the total
popular vote cast in the eight-state, primary season
finale on June 3. If Carter lost. Kennedv would con
tinue his campaign in the expectation of winning the
nomination.
The White House quickly rejected the idea. Ken
nedy issued his challenge at the Los Angeles Press
Club in a quietly dramatic speech that depicted Car
ter as a failed president who is v irtuallv certain to lose
in November unless he defends his policies in the
Democratic primaries.
The latest Associated Press count gives Carter
1365 delegate \otes at the Democratic National
Convention, with 1666 required for nomination.
Kennedy's total was 770.
The president could easily clinch renomination
June 3, when 696 delegates are up for grabs in

Mexico, Rhode Island. South Dakota and West Vir
ginia. That is more than one-fifth the total delegates
who will attend the convention in New York this

Bani-Sadr defends Iran military
TEHRAN. Iran — President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr and his right-wing clerical rivals yesterday
traded accusations about alleged I .S.-inspired plans
for a coup to topple the revolutionary government.
The acrimonious but undocumented debate, the
latest display of increasing public animositv between
Iran's secular and religious authorities, centered on
the reliability of the Iranian armed forces. The milit
ary's dependability has been questioned in public and
private since the ill-fated American hostage rescue
operation three weeks ago penetrated Iranian air
space without detection.
Pursuing a plan to scatter the hostages across Iran
to thwart any future rescue attempt, the radical Mos
lem students occupying the U.S. Embassy here an
nounced that an undisclosed number of their captives
have been sent to the city of Hamedan about 220
miles east of Tehran. According to the militants,
groups of hostages are being held in 13 provincial
cities as well as the capital.
Escalating Iran's internal debate in the rescue at
tempt's aftermath was a communique from the hard
line Crusaders of the Islamic Republic group printed
in the right-wing clerical Islamic Republic news

paper. It charged that the United States "probably
intends to stage an internal coup d'etat by its agents in
the Army," which it said had partly infiltrated the top
levels of command.
Reacting for the first time to a flood of rumors
concerning an alleged Iranian radar failure along the
rescue mission's flight path and the controversial
bombing of the abandoned American aircraft by Ira
nian warplanes, Bani-Sadr said: "We cannot use the
existence of these things to arouse suspicions about
the Army and say the whole Army is working for
foreigners, which is not true."
But Bani-Sadr himself contributed to the mood of
suspicion in the interview, originally broadcast Wed
nesday night on radio. He said the Carter administra
tion had infiltrated % Americans and 14 Iranian
residents of the United States to carry out sabotage
over the next two weeks.
Riotous Koreans await reaction
SEOUL, South Korea — Students seeking more
democracy fought running street battles with riot
police that left one officer dead and at least 13 in
jured. Then their leaders met all night, deciding today'
that they had made their point and would M,\\*it go\ -
ernment reaction.
In the third day of clashes Yesterday, the anti
government protests spread from Secrul to five other
cities. There were no reports on student injuries or
arrests.
Prime Minister Shin Hyonhwack. in his first public
reaction to demonstrations that began two weeks
ago, said the government would try to advance its
political development timetable as much as possible
"to meet the people's expectation."
One of the students' major complaints is that the
government has moved too slowly toward greater
democracy.
The prime minister also said in a nationwide
broadcast that further such protests could result in
"economic bankruptcy."
Some demonstration leaders said Shin's statement
was a disappointment and failed to meet their de
mands.
However, student leaders from about 20 univer
sities met throughout the night and announced this
morning that they had called off further demonstra
tions and would Kait for a government response.
State Senate okays Laetrile use
SACRAMENTO — A bill allowing California
doctors to use Laetrile to treat cancer if it can be
proven safe cleared the Senate yesterday despite
claims that the substance is worthless and toxic.
The vote was 23-1 1. two more than the bare major
ity needed for approval in the 40-seat house, on
SBI4BO hy Sen. William Campbell, R-Hacienda
Heights.
It now goes to the Assembly, where a Senate
approved legalization bill by Campbell died in com
mittee in 1977. Another Campbell bill was killed by a
Senate committee last year.
Laetrile is a substance found in the pits of apricots,
peaches, bitter almonds and other plant material. Its
ad\ocates contend cyanide in Laetrile combines with
an enzyme in cancerous cells to kill the cells.
But most of the medical community contends the
substance is worthless and toxic, and current law bans
its use.
An opponent of the bill. Sen. Diane Watson.
D-Los Angeles, said the Legislature should wait until
tests on the effectiveness and safety of Laetrile are
conducted by the National Cancer Institute before
acting.
Congress wavers on import fee
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter yes
terday accused Congress of flinching in the face of
political pressures and breaking commitments by its
leaders to support his new oil-import fee and balance
the budget.
Both houses have made it clear in recent days they
have substantial majorities ready to roll back the
import tee. The Finance Committee and a House

Ways and Means subcommittee voted overwhelm
ingly Wednesday to repeal it.
However, Carter reminded the lawmakers yester
day he imposed the levy "unilaterally" after congres
sional leaders "asked me to" during negotiations last
March over the administration's new anti-inflation
plan.
Congressional sources who were in on the negotia
tions in March confirmed there was "a clear consen
sus" among House and Senate leaders that Carter
should impose the fee. which would raise gasoline
prices 10 cents a gallon.
In the meantime, a U.S. District Court has ruled
the import fee illegal on grounds that Carter chose to
require refiners to pass the levy on to consumers only
in the form of higher gasoline prices. lea\ ing heating
fuel prices untouched.
The levy, which would have raised prices at the
pump yesterday morning had it not been blocked by
the courts, would bring in an estimated $ 10.3 billion
in new revenues each year.
Muskie scoffs at Soviet proposal
VIENNA, Austria — On the eve of his first high
level talks with the Soviets as secretary of state, Ed

proposal for a solution to the Afghanistan crisis as a
cosmetic propaganda ploy.

where the proposal was quickly rejected soon after it
was broadcast bv the Soviet-backed government in
Kabul, Muskie. in two brief public statements here
and in a separate statement by a spokesman, charac
terized the proposal as a Soviet-engineered bid for
support from the Islamic conference that convened
yesterday in Pakistan.
But the issue may not go away that easily. Muskie is
in Vienna to help celebrate 25 years of Austrian
neutrality. Even ad\ance of Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei A. • nnyko's scheduled arrival today,
the event has taken on the appearance of another
effort at East-West detente.
In varying degrees, European officials here are

all that the latest Soviet proposal at least be regarded
as a basis on which to build a dialogue with the
Russians.

Germans endorse U.S. boycott
DUESSELDORF, West Germany — Hie West
German Olympic Committee voted yesterday not to
send a team to the 1980 Moscow Olympics, the
strongest endorsement yet for President Jimmy Car
ter's call for an international boycott.
Carter termed the 59-40 vote "a courageous deci
sion," but a spokesman for the Soviet organizers said
it would have "no effect.'"
The West German government, in thanking the
committee for its endorsement of the official posi
tion. noted the sacrifices of athletes who have trained
only to see their Olympic hopes shattered by the
world reaction to the So\ iet intervention in Afghanis
tan.
The decision removed some of the pessimism
created Monday by the Decision of the French
Olympic Committee to join the British in agreeing to
participate in the Moscow Games.
West Germany becomes only the third country
among L'.S. allies in the 15-nation North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to support the boycott. The
other two are Norway and Canada. Besides Britain
and France, two other NATO members, Denmark
and Greece, have decided to go to Moscow.
The committees of Australia, Japan, the Nether
lands and Portugal are among those that have said
they would follow the German lead. They have until
May 24 to notify the organizing committee if they
plan to send a team.
Kennedy issues debate challenge
LOS ANGELES — Sen. Edward Kennedy, in a
last attempt to prod President Jimmy Carter into a
face-to-face confrontation, said yesterday that he
would withdraw from the Democratic presidential
race if Carter debated him and then won the total
popular vote cast in the eight-state, primary season
finale on June 3. If Carter lost. Kennedv would con
tinue his campaign in the expectation of winning the
nomination.
The White House quickly rejected the idea. Ken
nedy issued his challenge at the Los Angeles Press
Club in a quietly dramatic speech that depicted Car
ter as a failed president who is v irtuallv certain to lose
in November unless he defends his policies in the
Democratic primaries.
The latest Associated Press count gives Carter
1365 delegate \otes at the Democratic National
Convention, with 1666 required for nomination.
Kennedy's total was 770.
The president could easily clinch renomination
June 3, when 696 delegates are up for grabs in
California. New Jersev. Ohio. Montana. New
Mexico, Rhode Island. South Dakota and West Vir
ginia. That is more than one-fifth the total delegates
who will attend the convention in New York this

Bani-Sadr defends Iran military
TEHRAN. Iran — President Abolhassan Bani-
Sadr and his right-wing clerical rivals yesterday
traded accusations about alleged I .S.-inspired plans
for a coup to topple the revolutionary government.
The acrimonious but undocumented debate, the
latest display of increasing public animositv between
Iran's secular and religious authorities, centered on
the reliability of the Iranian armed forces. The milit
ary's dependability has been questioned in public and
private since the ill-fated American hostage rescue
operation three weeks ago penetrated Iranian air
space without detection.
Pursuing a plan to scatter the hostages across Iran
to thwart any future rescue attempt, the radical Mos
lem students occupying the U.S. Embassy here an
nounced that an undisclosed number of their captives
have been sent to the city of Hamedan about 220
miles east of Tehran. According to the militants,
groups of hostages are being held in 13 provincial
cities as well as the capital.
Escalating Iran's internal debate in the rescue at
tempt's aftermath was a communique from the hard
line Crusaders of the Islamic Republic group printed
in the right-wing clerical Islamic Republic news

paper. It charged that the United States "probably
intends to stage an internal coup d'etat by its agents in
the Army," which it said had partly infiltrated the top
levels of command.
Reacting for the first time to a flood of rumors
concerning an alleged Iranian radar failure along the
rescue mission's flight path and the controversial
bombing of the abandoned American aircraft by Ira
nian warplanes, Bani-Sadr said: "We cannot use the
existence of these things to arouse suspicions about
the Army and say the whole Army is working for
foreigners, which is not true."
But Bani-Sadr himself contributed to the mood of
suspicion in the interview, originally broadcast Wed
nesday night on radio. He said the Carter administra
tion had infiltrated % Americans and 14 Iranian
residents of the United States to carry out sabotage
over the next two weeks.
Riotous Koreans await reaction
SEOUL, South Korea — Students seeking more
democracy fought running street battles with riot
police that left one officer dead and at least 13 in

that they had made their point and would M,\\*it go\ -
ernment reaction.
In the third day of clashes Yesterday, the anti
government protests spread from Secrul to five other
cities. There were no reports on student injuries or
arrests.
Prime Minister Shin Hyonhwack. in his first public
reaction to demonstrations that began two weeks
ago, said the government would try to advance its
political development timetable as much as possible
"to meet the people's expectation."
One of the students' major complaints is that the
government has moved too slowly toward greater
democracy.
The prime minister also said in a nationwide
broadcast that further such protests could result in
"economic bankruptcy."
Some demonstration leaders said Shin's statement
was a disappointment and failed to meet their de
mands.
However, student leaders from about 20 univer
sities met throughout the night and announced this
morning that they had called off further demonstra
tions and would Kait for a government response.
State Senate okays Laetrile use
SACRAMENTO — A bill allowing California
doctors to use Laetrile to treat cancer if it can be
proven safe cleared the Senate yesterday despite
claims that the substance is worthless and toxic.
The vote was 23-1 1. two more than the bare major
ity needed for approval in the 40-seat house, on
SBI4BO hy Sen. William Campbell, R-Hacienda
Heights.
It now goes to the Assembly, where a Senate
approved legalization bill by Campbell died in com
mittee in 1977. Another Campbell bill was killed by a
Senate committee last year.
Laetrile is a substance found in the pits of apricots,
peaches, bitter almonds and other plant material. Its
ad\ocates contend cyanide in Laetrile combines with
an enzyme in cancerous cells to kill the cells.
But most of the medical community contends the
substance is worthless and toxic, and current law bans
its use.
An opponent of the bill. Sen. Diane Watson.
D-Los Angeles, said the Legislature should wait until
tests on the effectiveness and safety of Laetrile are
conducted by the National Cancer Institute before
acting.
Congress wavers on import fee
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter yes
terday accused Congress of flinching in the face of
political pressures and breaking commitments by its
leaders to support his new oil-import fee and balance
the budget.
Both houses have made it clear in recent days they
have substantial majorities ready to roll back the
import tee. The Finance Committee and a House

Ways and Means subcommittee voted overwhelm
ingly Wednesday to repeal it.
However, Carter reminded the lawmakers yester
day he imposed the levy "unilaterally" after congres
sional leaders "asked me to" during negotiations last
March over the administration's new anti-inflation
plan.
Congressional sources who were in on the negotia
tions in March confirmed there was "a clear consen
sus" among House and Senate leaders that Carter
should impose the fee. which would raise gasoline
prices 10 cents a gallon.
In the meantime, a U.S. District Court has ruled
the import fee illegal on grounds that Carter chose to
require refiners to pass the levy on to consumers only
in the form of higher gasoline prices. lea\ ing heating
fuel prices untouched.
The levy, which would have raised prices at the
pump yesterday morning had it not been blocked by
the courts, would bring in an estimated $ 10.3 billion
in new revenues each year.
Muskie scoffs at Soviet proposal
VIENNA, Austria — On the eve of his first high

proposal for a solution to the Afghanistan crisis as a
cosmetic propaganda ploy.
Clearly taking his cue from the White House,
where the proposal was quickly rejected soon after it
was broadcast bv the Soviet-backed government in
Kabul, Muskie. in two brief public statements here
and in a separate statement by a spokesman, charac
terized the proposal as a Soviet-engineered bid for
support from the Islamic conference that convened
yesterday in Pakistan.
But the issue may not go away that easily. Muskie is
in Vienna to help celebrate 25 years of Austrian
neutrality. Even ad\ance of Soviet Foreign Minis
ter Andrei A. • nnyko's scheduled arrival today,
the event has taken on the appearance of another
effort at East-West detente.
In varying degrees, European officials here are

all that the latest Soviet proposal at least be regarded
as a basis on which to build a dialogue with the
Russians.
