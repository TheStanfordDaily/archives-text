## 
### Laura Kaufman Staff Writer 
Manzanita Park will sponsor the
fourth annual Splendor on the Grass
festival tomorrow from noon to mid
night on the Manzanita field.
Featuring about 15 student bands
and 65 kegs of beer. Splendor is esti
mated to attract about 3000 people,
according to Laurie Tomieh, one of the
event's six coordinators.
Beer will be free for those with Stan
ford identification. Students are re
quested not to bring bottles or cans to
the festival.
This year's program differs from last
year's in that security will be tigher;
also there's only one professional band,
the Joe Perry Project, whereas there
were four pro bands last year.
"We would rather give students a
chance," said Tomich.
Among the bands featured will be
Roof Top Magic and Claude Monet,
both offshoots of last year's Phi Psi
band, according to another coor
dinator. Chris Hourigan. Murphy's
Lawvers, "a briefcase full of rock and

roll," will also play, he said.
Other acts scheduled are Bay Bop, a
jazz band; Wildebeest; Guy Nohra;
Mariah; Counter Point, and the Stan
ford Marching Band.
Hourigan said that there will be two
bandstands, so that music will be
played continuously.
"It's a good opportunity for the
bands, because this is one time when
Stanford students can get exposure,
and a chance to play in front of a huge
crowd." he said. "We provide the audi
ence, and they provide the music."
The Joe Perry Project, the only
non-student act, is led by Aerosmith's
former lead guitarist. The band will
play at 7:30 p.m. '
Roof Top Magic will wrap up the
show for listening and dancing begin
ning at 9:30 p.m. and may be joined by
members from other bands, according
to Hourigan.
The Splendor committee has been
working on the event since January,
auditioning bands and collecting
pledges for beer kegs from student re
sidences.
