## 
### Joan O'Connell Staff Writer 
Four candidates seeking incumbent
Congressman Pete McCloskey's (R-
Menlo Park) 12th District seat in the
U.S. House of Representatives, ap
peared on K/SU's Campus Confer
ence last night, united on several issues,
primarily opposition to draft registra
tion and compulsory youth service.
Democratic candidates Marc
Strassman and Kirsten Olsen, Liberta
rian Bill Fvers and Peace find Freedom
candidate Adele lumino, were in the
KZSU studios for the hour and a half
program, while McCloskey made a
10-minute statement at the beginning
of the program in a live telephone
hook-up from Washington, D.C.
Another contender for McCloskey's
seat in next November's election. Re
publican Rovce Cole, did not attend.
The draft registration question soon
emerged as one of the program's major
focuses, with each of the four candi
dates opposing both President Jimmy
Carter's call for registration and also
the National Youth Service Bill prop
osed by McCloskey in 1979, which
would require all 18-year-olds to
choose between military and civilian
service.
From Washington. McCloskey. who
has occupied the 12th District position
for 1 2 years, defended his proposal by
saying that the currently all-volunteer
forces are not working and that it (a
National Youth Ser\ice bill) would
represent a move toward "self
discipline," one of the four things
which he said government should focus
on McCloskey's other three goals in
cluded balancing the federal budget,
ending U.S. dependence on foreign oil.
and cutting the"size, cost and complex
ity" of government regulations on
American industries.
Olsen, a Palo Alto stockbroker, cal
led youth service "another word for
youth slavery." and suggeste'd the go\-
yrnment should instead raise incentives
fAr the "middle-level positions" —
pilots, engineers and those being re
cruited by big business — in order to
improve the quality ol the all-volunteer
forces. *
I umino called registration "merely a
diversion from economic problems,
like inflation and unemployment. She
also attacked both the Democratic and
Republican policies of "turning to in
di\ iduals to solve great problems, w hen
great social solutions are needed."
Fvers, former editor of Inquiry
magazine and a Stanford alumnus,
suggested a paradox between McClos
key's currenft.stance on youth service
and his position in government.
"Several times in the past McClos

key was saved from defeat by Stanford
students who worked for him and
changed their registration to help him
in the primaries. Yet he's threatening
those same students now with a draft,"
he said.
Strassman claimed that he was the
only Democrat who could conceivably
beat McCloskey next' fall, citing
Olsen's poor record in the last election
when she challenged McCloskey, but
only received 21 percent of the vote.
Strassman will face Olsen in a June 3
primary.
Olsen responded "the only reason
for the low number of votes was that
Democrats in the district always vote
for McCloskey."
Strassman said Olsen's campaign
slogan, " KO is Ok" is inadequate, and
that voters should instead note his,
"He's not boring." which is "not only
humorous, but also focuses on new.
important, imaginative alternatives."
The four candidates each agreed that
abortion is the legal right of women, as
prescribed by the United States Sup
reme Court, but Evers said he would
not support federally-funded abor
tions. because "it is immoral to force
part of the population which believes
that abortion is murder, to pay for it."
Strassman said his single, most im
portant goal as congressman would be
to work to "eliminate overall depen
dence on centralized energy sources."
Olsen called for an end to all tax laws
and an across-the-board 15 percent tax
rate for all citi/cns in the country, with
no "Icfopholes." She suggested that the
money saved by eliminating the Inter
nal Revenue Service and all the gov
ernment jobs associated with tax laws
would provide the government with the
same amount of money it currently re
ceives.
However, she added that the poor
should not have to pay any taxes and
that the 15 percent tigure would be
considered the maximum in a
graduated system.
On the Iranian situation, Olsen said
the United States should have "gotten
tougher sooner," and she advocated
mining Iranian harbors. "Unfortu
nately. we have to use their tactics."
she said.
Evers suggested that the situation
was a result of "a fall-out from past
American foreign policy." and that the
United States should change its foreign
policy to a "non-interventionist ap
proach."
Fumino said her party supports the
return of the shah and his assets to the
Iranian people, and said the United
States should investigate its own role in
Iran in past years and "acknowledge
our guilt if we find it."

I umino called registration "merely a

Fvers, former editor of Inquiry
magazine and a Stanford alumnus,
suggested a paradox between McClos
key's currenft.stance on youth service
and his position in government.
"Several times in the past McClos

key was saved from defeat by Stanford
students who worked for him and
changed their registration to help him
in the primaries. Yet he's threatening
those same students now with a draft,"
he said.
Strassman claimed that he was the
only Democrat who could conceivably
beat McCloskey next' fall, citing
Olsen's poor record in the last election
when she challenged McCloskey, but
only received 21 percent of the vote.
Strassman will face Olsen in a June 3
primary.
Olsen responded "the only reason
for the low number of votes was that
Democrats in the district always vote
for McCloskey."
Strassman said Olsen's campaign
slogan, " KO is Ok" is inadequate, and
that voters should instead note his,
"He's not boring." which is "not only
humorous, but also focuses on new.
important, imaginative alternatives."
The four candidates each agreed that
abortion is the legal right of women, as
prescribed by the United States Sup
reme Court, but Evers said he would
not support federally-funded abor
tions. because "it is immoral to force
part of the population which believes
that abortion is murder, to pay for it."
Strassman said his single, most im
portant goal as congressman would be
to work to "eliminate overall depen
dence on centralized energy sources."
Olsen called for an end to all tax laws
and an across-the-board 15 percent tax
rate for all citi/cns in the country, with
no "Icfopholes." She suggested that the
money saved by eliminating the Inter
nal Revenue Service and all the gov
ernment jobs associated with tax laws
would provide the government with the
same amount of money it currently re
ceives.
However, she added that the poor
should not have to pay any taxes and
that the 15 percent tigure would be
considered the maximum in a
graduated system.
On the Iranian situation, Olsen said
the United States should have "gotten
tougher sooner," and she advocated
mining Iranian harbors. "Unfortu
nately. we have to use their tactics."
she said.
Evers suggested that the situation
was a result of "a fall-out from past
American foreign policy." and that the
United States should change its foreign
policy to a "non-interventionist ap
proach."
Fumino said her party supports the
return of the shah and his assets to the
Iranian people, and said the United
States should investigate its own role in
Iran in past years and "acknowledge
our guilt if we find it."
Four candidates seeking incumbent
Congressman Pete McCloskey's (R-
Menlo Park) 12th District seat in the
U.S. House of Representatives, ap
peared on K/SU's Campus Confer
ence last night, united on several issues,
primarily opposition to draft registra
tion and compulsory youth service.
Democratic candidates Marc
Strassman and Kirsten Olsen, Liberta
rian Bill Fvers and Peace find Freedom
candidate Adele lumino, were in the
KZSU studios for the hour and a half
program, while McCloskey made a
10-minute statement at the beginning
of the program in a live telephone
hook-up from Washington, D.C.
Another contender for McCloskey's
seat in next November's election. Re
publican Rovce Cole, did not attend.
The draft registration question soon
emerged as one of the program's major
focuses, with each of the four candi
dates opposing both President Jimmy
Carter's call for registration and also
the National Youth Service Bill prop
osed by McCloskey in 1979, which
would require all 18-year-olds to
choose between military and civilian
service.
From Washington. McCloskey. who
has occupied the 12th District position
for 1 2 years, defended his proposal by
saying that the currently all-volunteer
forces are not working and that it (a
National Youth Ser\ice bill) would
represent a move toward "self
discipline," one of the four things
which he said government should focus
on McCloskey's other three goals in
