From tla* Daily wire services
KEY WEST. I la. .Federal agents
yesterday seized do/ens ot boats that
defied President Jimmy Carter's order
to halt the illegal "Freedom Flotilla"
from Cuba as refugees continued
streaming into Florida aboard crowded
vessels.
One boat captain said Cuba had
jammed U.S. radio transmissions re
porting Carter's order.
Customs agents reported that 58
boats carrying about 2300 refugees had
been ordered seized by late in the tiny.
The boats brought the total number ot
refugees arriving here in the last three
weeks to 44..S3 1 ).
As the boats tied up. Customs agents
slapped each one with a bright red sei
zure sticker and served its captain with
a notice he was subject to a line of

s 1000 per refugee for violating immig
ration laws.
The Coast Guard began broadcast
ing regular warnings Wednesday night,
ordering Mariel-bound vessels to turn
back. But few boats were leaving for
Cuba anyway because Cuban-
Americans are discouraged by reports
that Castro is loading up boats with
political prisoners and Peruvian Em
bassy refugees, rather than the rela
tives Cuban-Americans seek to rescue.
In Washington, Treasury Depart
ment officials announced late yester
day afternoon they were adding
another weapon to administration's en
forcement arsenal: the threat of
$50,000 fines and 10 years imprison
ment for those who violate the ban on
bringing in Cubans illegally.
Carter offered to send planes and

ships to ferry refugees back to the Un
ited States if Cuba would agree to let
U.S. authorities screen refugees before
departure. There was no indication
that Cuban President Fidel Castro
would accept the offer.
Richard Davis, assistant secretary
for enforcement at the Treasury De
partment, said the new amendments to
the Cuban Asset Control Regulations
were designed to provide additional
authority to seize boats and in serious
cases to impose the heavy criminal
sanctions.
Officials admitted that the interna
tional negotiating team formed in
Costa Rica last week so far has failed to
make any headway in dealing with Cas
tro. That goal was damaged, officials
acknowledged, when some Latin
American countries with cordial rela
tions with Castro refused to be part of
the negotiating team.
"They were concerned they'd be get
ting in the middle of something bet
ween the United States and Cuba that
might spoil their relationship." one
said.
If there is no change of position by
Castro in a week or so, U.S. strategy is
to have another meeting of the Costa
Rica conference to increase pressure
on Cuba, one official said.
Sen. Richard Stone (D-Fla.) said
yesterday that he thought it would take
a day or two to see it the law enforce
ment effort has credibility.
"The early response from Cuban
exile leaders in Miami is more com
pliance with the president's request
than they expected. That is shown by
the long lines at the family registration
center."
More than 7000 persons were lined
up by mid-morning yesterday to give
federal officials the names of close rela
tives for the proposed U.S. airlift, a
State Department official said.
Raul Masvidal, chairman and presi
dent of Biscayne Bank in Miami, one of
the Cuban leaders briefed Wednesday
by a White House official, said yester
clay the Cuban-American community
felt "confused by Carter's latest flip-
Hop on this issue. We're pretty much
willing to go along with the president
for now. But many feel it's totally un
realistic to think Castro is going to
cooperate. We seem to be playing right
into his hands again."#
He added that anyone trying to
sound out opinion in the Cuban com
munity in Florida would find 25
answers from as many people.
On the docks of the abandoned na\ v
base here now converted to a refugee
center, Nikolas Severdija, 42. lounged
in bathing trunks on his 38-foot boat,
Minegra. Severdija had just scurried in
a cargo of 40 refugees and a bright red
seizure notice glinted on his cabin door.
But Severdija said he was not con
cerned. The notice "is just to scare
people off so they won't go to Cuba
anymore," he said. "I figure it will he
taken off without any problem."
Severdija, like many of the captains
arriving here, was confused by the
mini-bureaucracy set up at dock-side.
"1 went from Customs to Immigration
to Coast Guard," he said. "I have a
bunch ot papers but I didn't read them.
I don't worry very much about them."
Obligingly, Severdija, fetched the
papers from his cabin. The first was a
seizure notice from the U.S. Customs
Bureau, but Severdija said Customs of
ficials told him he could sail his boat
back home to Miami when he wished.
The second paper was a "Notice of
Intention to Fine" from the U.S. Im
migration and Naturalization Service
declaring, "It appears that a breach of
the law has occurred. You transported
Cuban nationals to the U.S. without
visas. You are granted 30 days to file a
written dissent."
The third paper was a subpoena from
the U.S. Coast Guard to appear today
to testify at the Key West Coast Guard
station, presumably for an alleged vio
lation of marine safety laws.

While the papers might seem
threatening on the surface, many per
sons here do not believe that Immigra
tion Service fines will actually be im
posed on the more than 800 boats that
have carried refugees in the three
week exodus. Coast Guard subpoenas
also are believed unlikely to result in
prosecution since boat owners claim
Cuban soldiers forced them to over
load their vessels.
Meanwhile, more than 10.000
Cuban-Americans stampeded the
Opalocka Airport in Miami. Federal
officials were setting up an office at the
airport to receive applications for the
proposed government-sponsored sea
lift or airlift.
"We had a near riot out here," one
employee said. The U.S. marshals held
them at the gate. "They tried to push
down the gates."
