From tla* Daily wire services
KEY WEST. I la. .Federal agents
yesterday seized do/ens ot boats that
defied President Jimmy Carter's order
to halt the illegal "Freedom Flotilla"
from Cuba as refugees continued
streaming into Florida aboard crowded
vessels.
One boat captain said Cuba had
jammed U.S. radio transmissions re
porting Carter's order.
Customs agents reported that 58
boats carrying about 2300 refugees had
been ordered seized by late in the tiny.
The boats brought the total number ot
refugees arriving here in the last three
weeks to 44..S3 1 ).
As the boats tied up. Customs agents
slapped each one with a bright red sei
zure sticker and served its captain with
a notice he was subject to a line of

s 1000 per refugee for violating immig
ration laws.
The Coast Guard began broadcast
ing regular warnings Wednesday night,
ordering Mariel-bound vessels to turn
back. But few boats were leaving for
Cuba anyway because Cuban-
Americans are discouraged by reports
that Castro is loading up boats with
political prisoners and Peruvian Em
bassy refugees, rather than the rela
tives Cuban-Americans seek to rescue.
In Washington, Treasury Depart
ment officials announced late yester
day afternoon they were adding
another weapon to administration's en
forcement arsenal: the threat of
$50,000 fines and 10 years imprison
ment for those who violate the ban on
bringing in Cubans illegally.
Carter offered to send planes and

ships to ferry refugees back to the Un
ited States if Cuba would agree to let
U.S. authorities screen refugees before
departure. There was no indication
that Cuban President Fidel Castro
would accept the offer.
Richard Davis, assistant secretary
for enforcement at the Treasury De
partment, said the new amendments to
the Cuban Asset Control Regulations
were designed to provide additional
authority to seize boats and in serious
cases to impose the heavy criminal
sanctions.
Officials admitted that the interna
tional negotiating team formed in
Costa Rica last week so far has failed to
make any headway in dealing with Cas
tro. That goal was damaged, officials
acknowledged, when some Latin
American countries with cordial rela
tions with Castro refused to be part of
the negotiating team.
"They were concerned they'd be get
ting in the middle of something bet
ween the United States and Cuba that
might spoil their relationship." one
said.
If there is no change of position by
Castro in a week or so, U.S. strategy is
to have another meeting of the Costa
Rica conference to increase pressure
on Cuba, one official said.
Sen. Richard Stone (D-Fla.) said
yesterday that he thought it would take
a day or two to see it the law enforce
ment effort has credibility.
"The early response from Cuban
exile leaders in Miami is more com
pliance with the president's request
than they expected. That is shown by
the long lines at the family registration
center."
More than 7000 persons were lined
up by mid-morning yesterday to give
federal officials the names of close rela
tives for the proposed U.S. airlift, a
State Department official said.
Raul Masvidal, chairman and presi
dent of Biscayne Bank in Miami, one of
the Cuban leaders briefed Wednesday
by a White House official, said yester
