## El Salvador strives for moderation Junta hits rightwingers 
### Christopher Dickey The Washington Post 
MEXICO CITY — The slow
motion war of extremist terror
that for months has kept El Sal
vador hovering on the brink of
revolution took a new and possi
bly decisve turn this week when
the U.S.-backed junta and the
seriously divided armed forces
agreed to prosecute some of El
Salvador's most powerful
right-wing figures.
"We are hoping that this re
solves a long simmering discord
about who is in charge in the Sal
vadoran government," said one
ranking U.S. official. "And now
we can get on with the work of
coping with the challenge from
the ultra-left."
Supported and prodded by the
United States, the Salvadoran
government has implemented a
number of sweeping economic
reforms since the beginning of
the year to earn popular support,
undercut the demand of left
wing organizations and wrest
power from the small, wealthy
elite that has run El Salvador in
its own interest for the last cen
tury:
But combined with the re
forms has been what appeared at
least tacit acceptance of wide
spread oppression by some
members of the Salvadoran
armed forces allied with right
wing extremists.
Assassinations
Liberal government officials
have been systematically assas
sinated or forced out of the coun
try by these elements. Each day,
dozens of peasants are found
murdered and mutilated.
Human rights organizations
count 1500 people dead in polit
ical violence since the beginning
of the year.
In the face of such brutality,
growing numbers of Salvado
rans, including relatively moder
ate Social Democrats and the
more liberal wing of the Christ
ian Democratic Party, have al
lied themselves with the leftist
forces seeking to overthrow the
current regime.
U.S. Ambassador Robert
White has repeatedly and pub
licly prodded the Salvadoran
government to move against
right-wing extremists, but until
about two weeks ago there was
no sign of action.
Land reform
Then the Salvadoran junta de
creed that all tenant farmers and
sharecroppers would hence forth

own the land they worked. This
took land away from about 5000
owners and immediately put it in
the hands of about 150,000 pre
viously landless peasants.
In the wake of this reform, the
well-funded and organized right
began a campaign to force the
most liberal military and civilian
members of El Salvador's five
man junta to resign.
Robert D'Abuisson. a former
Salvador intelligence officer
forced to retire in October when
liberal elements of the Salvadorn
armed forces took over the gov
ernment. distributed a videotape
to Army barracks throughout
the country claiming that two
members of the junta. Col.
Adolfo Majano and Christian
Democrat Jose Antonio Morales
Erlich. are communists.
D'Abuisson, who in recent
weeks has talked with congres
sional and administration figures
in Washington, called for their
resignation and replacement by
members of his Broad National
Front.
Challenge to junta
Several military commanders
at first sided with D'Abuisson,
but after days of tense negotia
tions. the junta was able to with
stand his challenge. Last week,
Majano used his most loyal
military unti to arrest D'Abuis
son and almost 30 fellow con
spirators.
A suitcase full of incriminating
documents reportedly was found
in their possession, and many of
the people arrested are believed
to have direct involvement with
the right-wing death squads re
sponsible for much of El Sal
vador's most brutal violence.
Over the weekend, meetings
again were held with all ranking
officers in Salvador's military es
tablishment to determine
whether they would support the
junta or D'Abuisson. The Christ
ian Democrat, meanwhile,
threatened to resign from the
government if D'Abuisson were
freed.
Officers immune
A crucial concern of several
military commanders was that
active-duty officers arrested
along with D'Abuisson be im
mune from prosecution. Accord
ing to well-informed sources, a
compromise has been reached in
which D'Abuisson and his civi
lian co-conspirators will be tried,
while the active duty officers will
be transferred to new posts with
out prosecution.

Meanwhile, members of Sal
vador's wealthy oligarchy sym
pathetic to D'Abuisson, have
turned with increasing hostility
against the United States and its
ambassador. Angry crowds of
well-dressed Salvadorans de
monstrated in front of White's
residence here over the weekend
threatening to hold him hostage
until D'Abuisson was released.
White finally broke out of his
residence with U.S. Marine
guards in a cloud; of tear gas
Monday morning. But uniden
tified gunmen sprayed heavy
caliber bullets and threw two
bombs into the U.S. Embassy
later in the day. There were no
injuries.
Despite the physical and polit
ical dangers involved, the United
States has committed itself to
support the Salvador regime in
hopes a middle-of-the-road sol
ution can be found somewhere
between what it sees as political
extremes.

MEXICO CITY — The slow
motion war of extremist terror
that for months has kept El Sal
vador hovering on the brink of
revolution took a new and possi
bly decisve turn this week when
the U.S.-backed junta and the
seriously divided armed forces
agreed to prosecute some of El
Salvador's most powerful
right-wing figures.
"We are hoping that this re
solves a long simmering discord
about who is in charge in the Sal
vadoran government," said one
ranking U.S. official. "And now
we can get on with the work of
coping with the challenge from
the ultra-left."
Supported and prodded by the
United States, the Salvadoran
government has implemented a
number of sweeping economic
reforms since the beginning of
the year to earn popular support,
undercut the demand of left
wing organizations and wrest
power from the small, wealthy
elite that has run El Salvador in
its own interest for the last cen
tury:
But combined with the re
forms has been what appeared at
least tacit acceptance of wide
spread oppression by some
members of the Salvadoran
armed forces allied with right
wing extremists.
Assassinations
Liberal government officials
have been systematically assas
sinated or forced out of the coun
try by these elements. Each day,
dozens of peasants are found
murdered and mutilated.
Human rights organizations
count 1500 people dead in polit
ical violence since the beginning
of the year.
In the face of such brutality,
growing numbers of Salvado
rans, including relatively moder
ate Social Democrats and the
more liberal wing of the Christ
ian Democratic Party, have al
lied themselves with the leftist
forces seeking to overthrow the
current regime.
U.S. Ambassador Robert
White has repeatedly and pub
licly prodded the Salvadoran
government to move against
right-wing extremists, but until
about two weeks ago there was
no sign of action.
Land reform
Then the Salvadoran junta de
creed that all tenant farmers and
sharecroppers would hence forth

own the land they worked. This
took land away from about 5000
owners and immediately put it in
the hands of about 150,000 pre
viously landless peasants.
In the wake of this reform, the
well-funded and organized right
began a campaign to force the
most liberal military and civilian
members of El Salvador's five
man junta to resign.
Robert D'Abuisson. a former
Salvador intelligence officer
forced to retire in October when
liberal elements of the Salvadorn
armed forces took over the gov
ernment. distributed a videotape
to Army barracks throughout
the country claiming that two
members of the junta. Col.
Adolfo Majano and Christian
Democrat Jose Antonio Morales
Erlich. are communists.
D'Abuisson, who in recent
weeks has talked with congres
sional and administration figures
in Washington, called for their
resignation and replacement by
members of his Broad National
Front.
Challenge to junta
Several military commanders
at first sided with D'Abuisson,
but after days of tense negotia
tions. the junta was able to with
stand his challenge. Last week,
Majano used his most loyal
military unti to arrest D'Abuis
son and almost 30 fellow con
spirators.
A suitcase full of incriminating
documents reportedly was found
in their possession, and many of
the people arrested are believed
to have direct involvement with
the right-wing death squads re
sponsible for much of El Sal
vador's most brutal violence.
Over the weekend, meetings
again were held with all ranking
officers in Salvador's military es
tablishment to determine
whether they would support the
junta or D'Abuisson. The Christ
ian Democrat, meanwhile,
threatened to resign from the
government if D'Abuisson were
freed.
Officers immune
A crucial concern of several
military commanders was that
active-duty officers arrested
along with D'Abuisson be im
mune from prosecution. Accord
ing to well-informed sources, a
compromise has been reached in
which D'Abuisson and his civi
lian co-conspirators will be tried,
while the active duty officers will
be transferred to new posts with
out prosecution.

Meanwhile, members of Sal
vador's wealthy oligarchy sym
pathetic to D'Abuisson, have
turned with increasing hostility
against the United States and its
ambassador. Angry crowds of
well-dressed Salvadorans de
monstrated in front of White's
residence here over the weekend
threatening to hold him hostage
until D'Abuisson was released.
