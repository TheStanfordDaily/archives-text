# Israel blamed in policy reversal
## Egypt won't resume autonomy talks 
### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
CAIRO â€” Egypitain Presi
dent Anwar Sadat yesterday said
he will not agree to resume
negotiations with Israel on Pales
tinian autonomy, condemning
Israel's adoption of a parliamen
tary law that perpetuates
Jerusalem as the nation's capital.
Sadat and his autonomy
negotiators also accused Israel of
"escalating repressive mea
sures" in the occupied West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
Until Israel "reviews its posi
tion," Egypt declared in a com
munique, a "suitable atmos
phers" will not exist for resuming
negotiations.
Although Deputy Prime
Minister Butros Ghali called the
deadlock "one of the important
crises in the negotiations," he
left the door open for negotia
tions at a future date by declar
ing, "we welcome any positive
gesture which will help us solve
this crisis."
While Egypt and Israel have
faced down other important
crisis during their long Middle
East peace negotiations, the cur
rent dispute brings to the foref
ront of the talks one of the gut
issues that to date has been cir
cumspectly left on a back burner.
Both sides have concentrated on
a step-by-step resolution of the
mechanics of establishing a sys
tem of self-governance for the
1.2 million Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip with
out discussing the sticky issue of
Jerusalem.
No mention
The Camp David accords
made no mention of Jerusalem,
and although it has been clear for
a long time that there is no dis
cernible basis for agreement be
tween Egypt and Israel on the
issue, the U.S. negotiators had
hopes the subject could be held
in abeyance until both sides were
so close to accord all other topics
that scraping the autonomy talks
would be unthinkable.
Sadat's pique centered on a
measure adopted in Israel's
Knesset (parliament) Wednes
day just as he began a four-hour
speech in Egypt's Peoples As

semhly, in which he said he had
agreed to a request by President
Carter to resume the autonomy
negotiations. Last Friday, Sadat
abruptly suspended the talks in
definitely after a fruitless round
of negotiations in Tel Aviv, say
ing he wanted time for "reflec
tions."
Ghali stressed that Sadat had
hot known of the Knesset mea
sure before he made his speech
and that the timing of the Israeli
move was, in the main, responsi
ble for the latest impasse.
Official capital
Ghali, in a press conference,
dismissed as irrelevant that Is
rael in 1967 formally annexed
Hast Jerusalem and made* the
newly united city the official cap
ital of the nation and that since
then the Knesset has adopted
several resolutions reaffirming
that decision.
"There is a basic difference
between previous resolutions
and the law," Ghali said, refer
ring to articles in Wednesday's
measure that prohibits the gov
ernment from concluding any
agreements on Jerusalem as long
as the resolution is in effect. The
Knesset's action would obligate
the Israeli government to rescind
the resolution before the gov
ernment could change its stand
on Jerusalem.
Position dear
"The position of Egypt is quite
clear. We are in favor of negotia
tions, but we cannot have
negotiations in the face ot a lait
accompli." He said it "com
pletely contradicts the spirit and
letter of the Camp David ac
cords."
Ghali denied that Egypt was
setting forth "preconditions" for
Israel, saying "the only precon
dition is the will to . . . achieve a
comprehensive peace," Ghali
said.
The communique, which was
approved by Sadat, declared,
"Israel has also escalated repres
sive measures in the occupied
territories which contradict the
spirit and agreement of creating
a suitable atmosphere as a means
of alleviating the suffering of
Palestinians in the area."
Ghali would not be pressed

into saying what steps will be re
quired of Israel before Egypt ag
rees to resume the autonomy
talks, but he repeatedly said "We
cannot negotiate in this atmos
phere."
He conceded the two sides are
in a "deadlock," but he stressed,
"in spite of the existance of a
deadlock, we want to continue
the negotiations when we can."
U.S. role
He said he hoped the United
States would play "a more im
portant role" in the peace pro

cess, which appeared to he a vei
led appeal to the Carter ad
ministration to exert more pres
sure on Israel.
But Ghali said Kgypt would
not use the issue to slow down
the normalization of relations
between Egypt and Israel, say
ing, "We have shown we want to
accelerate the normaliza
tion . . . but all this has been re
ceived on the Israeli side by a
completely negative attitude
with regard to the West Bank
and Gaza Strip."
