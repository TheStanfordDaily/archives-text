# New access road upsets prof
## 
### Beth Harrison Staff Writer 
There has been a change on a hill near the golf course
recently and not everyone is happy about it.
An access road to the student observatory is being
built on the hillside — a large area of which has been
bulldozed to make room for the road. But a professor of
applied physics says the road should have been only a
"footpath" extending from an already existing parking
lot near the observatory.
University officials, however, say the wider path is
cheaper to build because the equipment necessary to
construct the road is already at the site.
Prof. Arthur Walker said he requested a path be built
to the observatory two years ago. The original route
students used to reach the observatory cut through a
parcel of University property leased to private owners.
After tension developed between observatory users
and the lessees. Walker said he requested the new route.
He said he is unhappy with the project for two reasons.
— He is aggravated that, after filing the request with
University officials two years ago, the project was not

started until recently.
— More importantly, he says, the project is disturbing
the natural environment unnecessarily.
Walker said he had to cancel an astronomy class
winter quarter because students had difficulty reaching
the observatory.
"The work was finally done," he said, but "much more
than was required. We needed a three to four foot wide
footpath," he said, but instead "a 10-foot-wide path was
bulldozed."
According to Valerie Veronin of the Provost's Office, a
wider path is being constructed because one large tractor
is already at the site to repave the observatory's parking
lot. It would have been more expensive to bring a second
piece of equipment up to construct a more narrow path,
she said.
She added that though the project was delayed for
many months, the work on the access road has taken less
than one month and is nearing completion.
Veronin added that the Facilities Planning office plans
to reseed the bulldozed area with wild grass so the site
will return eventually to its normal grassy condition.
