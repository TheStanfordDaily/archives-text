# South Korean authoritarian rule temporary
## 
### Sam Jameson The Los Angeles Times 
SEOUL, South Korea — President
Choi Kyu Hah said yesterday that sweep
ing (authoritarian rule imposed on South
Korea in his name would be temporary.
• Choi, who cut short a foreign trip to
return here a day early Friday, said impos
ition of nationwide martial law Saturday
would not change his pledge to implement
a new constitution and turn over the ad
ministration to a newly elected govern
ment by the end of June, 1981. j-
In a statement read for him by a
spokesman over national radio and televi
sion, Choi said nothing about what role
the 600.000-man armed forces and milit
ary strongman Lt. Gen. Cfion Doo Hwan
\iouldplay in the making of future policy.
Exclusive power
A bqn on all political activity and a
roundup of friends and foes of the assassi
nated President Park Chung Hee left the
military with exclusive power to approve
the contents of a new constitution, as well
as the form any elected government
would take.
Saturday's decision giving the military
Park-style authoritarian powers, ap
proved at a 10-minute Cabinet meeting,
(vas taken Choi said, to deal with the
"very serious crisis" facing the nation. He
cited alleged military moves by Com
munist North Korea and a social unrest
caused by three days of student street de
monstrations during his absence.
An American military spokesman said
the United States had no knowledge of
any military moves by North Korea.
Kim Young Sam, president of the op

position New Democratic Party, said "the
worst possible situation which I had
feared has occurred."
American opposition
Save for a statement by Ambassador
William Gleysteem urging American
military personnel to abide by martial law
regulations, U.S. officials refused any
comment. American opposition to milit
ary rule in South Korea, however, has
been enunciated repeatedly since Park
was assassinated Last Oct. 26.
As recently as May 1. in a meeting with
Japanese Prime Minister Masayoshi Oh
ira. President Jimmy Carter expressed
concern over the political ambitions of
"certain elements" in the South Korea
forces. Carter was known to be
referring to Gen. Chon, whose imprint on
Saturday's moves was deafly visible.
Chon, who heads both the watchdog
Defense Security Command and the Ko
rean Central Intelligence Agency, led a
Dec.' 12 mutiny within the military which
ousted more than 30 senior generals al
legedly tainted by corruption.
Arrests
The same kind of charges of corruption
were made against a number of staunch
supporters of the assassinated president,
who were arrested Saturday night.
Most startling was the arrest of Kim
Chong Pil, who succeeded Park as presi
dent of the majority Democratic Republi
can Party and appeared to be the choice of
the establishment to become South
Korea's next president. Kim's brother, a
businessman, also was arrested.
Charges of misuse of public office to
accumulate personal wealth were also

filed against two of the most prominent
figures of authoritarian rule under Park
— Lee Hu Rak. one-time KCIA director,
and Paak Chong Kyu, one-time chief
presidential bodyguard who exerted vast
political influence.
Political considerations, however, also
appeared to have played a role in the ar
rest of Kim Chong Pil.
Chon disenchanted
Chon reportedly had become disen
chanted with Kim when the former prime
minister started criticizing Park's rule
after the president was murdered. Even as
the ranks of student demonstrators ex
panded to more than 100,000 nationwide
last Thursday. Kim publicly urged the
government to exercise restraint in deal
ing with the demonstrations and repor
tedly was prepared to support a move in
the National Assembly ordering an end to
martial law.
Kim Dae Jung, the last man to run
against Park in an open presidential elec
tion in 1971, also was known to be in
•Chon's disfavor. Charged with instigating
social unrest, he was taken into custody
along with two of his secretaries, his son,
and his driver.
The arrests of the two Kims deprived
political forces which had supported Park
of their most prominent leader, and
jelimmated the man who was regarded as
the shrewdest politician in the ranks of the
opposition.
No forum for protest
Although Kim Young Sam. New
Democratic Party president, was not ar
rested. the ban on all political activity
promised to leave Kim without a forum

for protest.
Choi had widely been expected to offer
concessions to critics of his slow-paced
transition toward what was, at least until
Saturday, expected to be a democratic
government. Pressure for a speedy resto
ration of democracy was coming not only
from students and opposition leaders, but
even from the majority Democratic Re
publican Party.
The president, who under Park served
as a powerless prime minister charged
with carrying out his boss" orders, wound
up endorsing the opposite course.
Only last Thursday, Dr. Kim Ok Gill,
education minister whose brother, a col
lege professor, was arrested Saturday,
stated publicly that Choi would offer con
cessions, not a crackdown.
Concessions
Instead of announcing the repressive
measures in the Capitol building, as is
customarily done, Culture-Information
Minister Lee Kyoo Hyun went to the city
hall to tell newsmen of the move following
the Cabinet session.
Under partial martial law as it had
existed from the day after Park was assas
sinated until Saturday, the military was
charged with carrying out censorship —
which had become increasingly liberal —
and maintaining public order. The new
nationwide martial law gives the military
a direct voice in the overall administra
tion.
Most reminiscent of the authoritarian
days of Park was a ban imposed on defam
ing past or present chiefs of state. Like
Park during his life, and now again in
death, Choi was placed above criticism.
