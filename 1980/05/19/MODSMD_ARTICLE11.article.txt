# Approval seen as unlikely
## Quebecers to vote on secession 
### Stanley Meisler The Los Angeles Times 
MONTREAL — The voters
of Quebec, the old French col
ony once looked on as the heart
land of Canada, will decide at a
referendum tomorrow whether
to approve a proposal that could
lead them on a hesitant hut his
toric first step toward separation
from Canada.
For many Quebecers, it is a
difficult, emotional and confus
ing decision invoking their fears,
doubts, grievances and pride.
Judging by the polls, it is also a
divisive decision, setting young
against old, wives against hus
bands, the poor against the mid
dle class. English-speakers
against French-speakers.
The latest polls indicate that
the vote will be close but that the
proposal will not be approved —
only because of the solid opposi
tion of the province's English
speaking minority and of immig
rants. Most of the French
speakers. according to the polls,
will \ote for the proposal. This
kind of result could fuel a new
and dangerous grievance among
militant Quebec nationalists, a
feeling that they were cheated in
their own province by the vote of
the people who dominate the
rest of Canada.
Sentiments opposed
The sentiments of the voters
have been pulled in opposite di
rections by the appeals of two
enormously popular native sons.
Premier Rene Levesque of
Quebec and Prime Minister
Pierre Elliott Trudeau of
Canada.
Levesque, 57, who shocked
Canada when he led his separtist
Parti Quebecois to power in
1976. insists that the culture and
well-being of Quebec can be en
sured only in a new constitu
tional arrangement that takes
Quebec out of Canada politically
while keeping economic ties. He
is leading the referendum cam
paign in favor of the proposal.
Trudeau. 60, is not leading the
opposition. That job is in the

hands of Claude Ryan, 55, the
austere-looking, relentlessly log
ical leader of the province's Lib
eral Party. Hut it is obvious that
Trudeau, who has long fought
for a strong central government
that guaranteed the cultural
rights of Quebec, has made a sig
nificant impact on Quebecers
with only three speeches. In fact,
his mere presence as the
French-speaking Quebecer who
leads the government of all of
Canada undercuts Levesque's
attempts to persuade voters that
Ottawa is their enemy.
Wording confusing
The wording of the question to
be voted on Tuesday may make
it difficult to read the results
clearly. It is written in such a way
that it could attract the votes of
Quebecers who oppose separa
tion but want to bolster Leves
que in future constitutional
negotiations with Ottawa. On
the other hand, it also could
frighten away Quebecers who
want great change but not as
much change as that envisaged
by Levesque.
In the referendum, the Leves
que government asks Quebecers
for "the mandate to negotiate" a
new constitutional status with
Canada. Under this status,
known as "sovereignty
association." Quebec would be a
sovereign state with the power to
make all its own laws, levy all its
own taxes, and run its own
foreign relations — while con
tinuing in economic association
with the rest of Canada.
However, as a check on the
results of any future negotia
tions, the proposal promises that
no new political status would be
put into effect without a second
referendum.
English speakers opposed
The latest poll by Radio
Canada, the French-language
branch of the federal govern
ment's Canadian Broadcasting
Corp.. reported that 46 percent
of Quebecers would vote against
the proposal. 40 percent would
vote in favor of it. The rest were

either undecided or reluctant to
disclose their decision.
The total of "no" voters has
swelled by English-speakers and
immigrants, who said they would
reject the proposal 73 percent to
4 percent. If the referendum
were held only among French
speakers, according to the poll,
the proposal would be approved
50 percent to 38 percent.
This kind of poll has focused a
good deal of attention on the
non-French speakers of Quebec.
According to a 1976 census, 18
percent of the people of Quebec
did not regard French as their
native language. Most of them
spoke English, but many were
immigrants who still spoke Ita
lian, Portuguese or some other
language.
Those non-French speakers
feel uncomfortable with the idea
of a sovereign Quebec because,
they say, it would isolate them as
minorities. So long as Quebec
remains in Canada, they can feel
part of the cultural mainstream
of the country as a whole. On top
of this, many are simply
frightened by the surge of French
Quebec chauvinism around
them.
Levesque, evidently giving up
on the English and immigrant
vote, seemed to be calling atten
tion to it in hopes of persuading
French speakers to unite the
same way on the other side. He
also may have been laying the
groundwork for claims of a
moral victory, a true French-
Canadian victory, if the proposal
is defeated.
No moral victory
In turn, Ryan appealed for a
massive "no" vote to wipe out
any Levesque claims of moral
victory. "If they win by 51 per
cent." Ryan told a group of sup
porters at a brunch in Trois-
Rivieres, "they will claim a vic
tory of great historical mag
nitude. But if we win by that
margin, thgy will say something
else. Th'tfV think there are votes
of different value. I urge you to
work for a large majority to pre
vent any such interpretation."
Nevertheless, few analysts ex
pect that kind of vote against
Levesque" s proposal, and some
Ouebecers, remembering the
bombings and kidnappings by
extreme separtists a decade ago,
fear trouble after the results are
known.
Levesque tried to reassure
voters that, first, they had the
check of a second referendum,
and, second, that because he
wanted continued economic ties
to Canada, he was not calling for
total independence. Levesque
told the Armenian voters that he
does not advocate "the kind of
separation that people talk about
to make you crazy with fear."
Benefits and dangers
Much of Ryan's argument fo
cused on the benefits of remain
ing in Canada and the dangers of
living apart. Canada gave
Quebec, Ryan said at a meeting
in the mill town of La Tuque,
political stability, civil liberties,
enormous natural resources in
cluding oil, and a spirit of coop
eration and understanding.
There were inequities in the sys
tem. Ryan said, but those could
be removed in negotiations for
"a renewed federalism."
On top of this, he reminded a
rally in Montreal, the provinces
united to become Canada in the
19th century so that they could
resist the power of the United
States. "Now," he went on,
"when the United States is 25
times more powerful, how could
a chewed-up Canada or a sepa
rate Quebec resist that power?"
According to the polls, sup

porters of a 'no' vote were not
being swayed by the personality
or campaigning style of Ryan. By
a wide margin, the voters said
they found Levesque a more im
pressive and persuasive cam
paigner. This would seem to in
dicate that Trudeau was having a
significant influence on the views
of Ouebecers.
Levesque ridiculed
Trudeau has tried both to ap
peal to the pride of Ouebecers as
real Canadians, and to ridicule
Levesque as a leader atraid to
submit his real question to the
people.
In an emotional speech in
Quebec City, Trudeau reminded
a large rally of Ouebecers that
three French-speaking prime
ministers, including himself, had
ruled Canada for 36 of the 113
years since it was united in 1867.
The real question of the referen
dum. Trudeau said, was, "Do
you want to stop being Cana
dian?" It was a sentimental ap
peal, for Ouebecers, for many
years, traditionary thought of
themselves as the true Cana
dians. What was known as
Canada in the late 18th and early
19th centuries was largely
French-speaking.
Trudeau, speaking to the
Montreal Chamber of Com
merce, also taunted Levesque
for refusing to submit a clear
question on independence to the
voters. The prime minister con
temptuously dismissed the con
cept of a Quebec sovereignty
that would be conditional on
Canada agreeing to an economic
association.
Premiers won't negotiate
In any case, Trudeau went on,
the concept would get nowhere,
because he and the premiers of
all the other provinces had said
they would not negotiate
severeignty-association with
Quebec.
Finally, at a mass rally in
Montreal, Trudeau pledged his
"most solemn commitment" to
call an immediate constitutional
conference if the referendum is
rejected. These negotiations
would aim at working out an im
proved federal system, Trudeau
said, "and we will not stop until
they're finished."
The significance of the prime
minister's intervention in the
campaign could be seen in the
closing week as Levesque spent
far more time replying to
Trudeau than to Ryan. He de
scribed the idea of "French
power" in Ottawa as an illusion.
In Trudeau's 12 years as prime
minister, Levesque said, he had
failed to strengthen the role of
French speakers in the central
government.
Odd sidelight
In an odd sidelight to the cam
paign. the supporters of the re
ferendum appeared to be hurt by
a caustic remark by Lise Payette,
the Quebec Minister of Women.
As the campaign began in April,
Payette described any woman
who voted against the referen
dum asan Yvette, the little girl in
the Qucbec school primer who
likes to scrub and wash and cook
and sew while the little boys do
more "manly" things. "Claude
Ryan would have us all be Yvet
tes," Payette said.
The remark was seized by
some women leaders on the no
side. They began calling them
selves "Yvettes" and organized
impressive rallies of women sup
porting Ryan and his campaign
against the referendum. Leves
que finally described the
phenomenon as "a good joke but
it has lasted too long."
