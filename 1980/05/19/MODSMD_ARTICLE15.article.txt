# New, old ASSU senators join in orientation sessions
## 
### Karen Springen Meg Ward Staff Writers 
As a result of holding ASSU Senate elections in
the spring, new senators can now go through an
advance orientation program for the first time in
senate history.
The main purpose, according to ASSU Senate
Chair Mark Breier, is so that new senators "won't
have to spend as much time catching up" when they
officially take over in September.
Senators are holding four meetings this quarter.
Two of these are designed for the senators-elect to
"mingle with the old senators," said Breier, which
he said should help continuity.
The new senate will hold its first formal meeting
May 28. Members will elect a chair, a deputy chair
and a parliamentarian at that time. Candidates'

resumes are due today.
Chair candidates include Senators John Kinney,
Steve Miller and Mike O'Reilly, and junior Abbie
Rogers, junior Mark Swanson and Sophomore
Doug Mitchell.
A structural change enables the deputy chair to
come from outside the ranks of senate this year.
Committee assignments were announced at the
senate's second organization meeting Wednesday.
Senators stated their committee preferences, and
the financial committee was the most popular
choice.
According to Chris Green. "The senate's big
power really is dollars. That's what it rules."
At the orientation meeting, Breier told the new
senate that "the committees won't do anything this
year unless you're incredibly ambitious."
