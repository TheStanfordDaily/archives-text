# Feminist decries global patriarchy
## 
### Kathleen McClung Staff Writer 
Patriarchy is "the prevailing
religion of the planet and women
are the dreaded enemy,"
feminjst theorist and self
proclaimed "revolting hag"
Mary Daly told a capacity crowd
Wednesday in Terman Au
ditorium.
In all cultures and all historic
periods women have been the
victims of "unspeakable at
rocities," Daly said. These in
clude Chinese foot-binding, the
burning of widows in India, geni
tal mutilation of African women,
witchburning in Europe and
gynecological exploitation of
American women.
"We live in a situation of ex
tremity. Necrophilia is the love
of the patriarchy to destroy, to
rot. to kill all living things," she
said.
Daly, associate professor of
theology at Boston College and
author of Beyond God the Father
and (Jyn /Ecology, led her recep
tive audience on what she called
a "journey of exorcism and ecs
tacy, a spinning labyrinthine
journey into our own fore
ground."
Daly took questions only from
the women in the audience, exp
laining that it has been her prac
tice for several years to do so.
Language and myth
The first passage of the jour
ney involves language and myth.
Daly, who said she sometimes
plays with words, sometimes
breaks them, counseled her lis
teners to "let words come alive
inside your head because renam
ing shakes up the imagination
and leads to spinning, spiraling
thought rather than linear think
ing.
"We use language that is con
stantly betraying us," she said.

Words such as "glamor," "spins
ter" and "charm" all have lost
their briginal meanings.
"For instance, 'glamor used
to mean the power of a witch to
make the male member disap
pear. What's happened to that
word? It was stolen and dished
back in the form of a magazine
title, in the form of cosmetic
surgery."
'Atrocities'
In the second passage, what
she called the most somber part
of the journey, Daty discussed
five "atrocities" committed
against women. One common
characteristic of all five —
widow-burning, foot-maiming,
genital mutilation, witchburning
and gynecological surgery — is
the explicit legitimation of the
acts in the research by patriar
chical scholars, what Daly called
"scholar-shit." Hie legitimation
takes the form of silence in his
tory textbooks or "writing that
just slithers by.
"Note for example, the title of
one scholar's book," she said,
"Chinese Footbinding: A Curi
ous, Erotic Custom. Curious for
whom? Erotic for whom? A cus
tom? Like the Nazis' custom?"
The final passage of Daly's
journey, "spinning, spooking
and sparking grows out of find
ing our own energy, our own au
ras," of expressing ecstacy and
"women's beautiful, creative
rage," she said.
Croaking witch
"In every living woman here
there is a sometimes-screaming,
sometimes-howling, whispering,
croaking witch inside."
Daly's lecture was sponsored
jointly by the Women's Center,
ASSU Speakers' Bureau,
SWOPSI, the Center for Re
search on Women and the Politi
cal Science Department.
