# Defense spending increases may hit $1 trillion by 1983
## 
### George Wilson The Washington Post 
WASHINGTON — Without
so much as a drum roll. Congress
is about to launch the American
military's biggest peacetime
buildup.
The congressional approval
will take the form of budget ceil
ings established for national de
fense for the next three years —
fiscal 1981 through 1983. While
the Senate and House are cur
rently at odds over whose budget
numbers to adopt, the Senate
Budget Committee reckons that
its higher objectives for defense
spending would total about $1
trillion over the next five years.
The unspoken fact of this new
defense buildup is that it will not
make the United States the un
disputed No. 1 in global military
might.
In fact, assuming continued
peace, the U.S. armed services
will eat up that trillion dollars
without -growing much bigger
than they are today. Five years
from now, critics still will be able
to deplore the various "gaps" be
tween the U.S. and Soviet milit
ary — the tank gap and the naval
gap and the fighter plane gap and
the nuclear megatonnage gap.
How can the president and
Congress go on a five-year shop
ping spree which is going to buy
so much frustration? The answer
lies in the complexity of modern
weapons and the uncontrollable
costs of maintaining America's
military forces.
Procurement
— Only about one-fourth of
the Pentagon's total budget goes
to buy weapons, the procure
ment account. The rest goes to
pay, house and feed soldiers; to
maintain weapons already on
hand and to conduct research on
promising wonder weapons. The
$250 billion which under normal
apportionment will go for pro
curement over the next five years
— assuming the Senate's projec
tions prove accurate — does not
seem to buy as much because the
new modern weapons cost so
much more than the old ones
they replace.
Inflation accounts from some
of this price escalation, but only a

minor part. A Sherman tank
would cost only about $235,000
in today's inflated dollars, still
vastly cheaper than the XM-1
tanks which the Army will buy.
Pentagon executives attribute
much of the difference to quality.
Critics call it gold-plating. But
post-World War II history does
show that U.S. decisionmakers
have consistently opted for
high-technology, sophisticated
weaponry instead of simpler,
cheaper and sometimes more re
liable versions.
Will citizens begin to ask why
their tax dollars seem to be buy
ing so little strength in relation to
the Soviet Union? Some Penta
gon leaders already argue that
the usual "we" vs. "they" com
parisons in men, tanks and
mega tonnage do not explain the
true relative strengths of the two
superpowers.
Defense Secretary Harold
Brown, in his fiscal 1980 posture
statement, insisted that such
comparisons "can be extraordi
narily misleading when it comes
to making judgments about the
adequacy of our forces or how to
correct their deficiencies.
Allies ignored
"While we would be fighting
alongside allies in most cases, the
comparisons frequently omit
their forces. They also leave out
such crucial variables as objec
tives, geography and contingen
cies. The impression they give is
that the United States and Soviet
Union are going to meet on a
jousting field, where they will
engage in a fight to the finish
with all their bombs, bullets,
tanks, ships and aircraft — pos
sibly with allies, but more likely
without them.
Brown warned: "These com
parisons can also lead to the con
clusion that the way to improve
or restore our posture is to make
its details a mirror-image of
Soviet capabilities. That would
be a mistake."
But such appeals have been
undercut by the president's own
policy statements starting with
President Jimmy Carter's rever

sal of his own 1976 campaign
promise to cut defense spending
$5 billion to $7 billion a year. In
1978, Carter convened a NATO
"summit" conference in
Washington where, under his
prodding, the United States and
its allies promised to increase de
fense spending by 3 percent a
year, after allowing for inflation.
Sen. William Proxmire (D-
Wis.) is among the critics who
insist that instead of setting fixed
percentage growth rates for de
fense spending the Pentagon
budget should be justified in
specific terms — how much is
enough and why. "It's ridicul
ous," said Proxmire. "Imagine
what they'd say if we did that on
domestic programs."

insist that instead of setting fixed
percentage growth rates for de
fense spending the Pentagon
budget should be justified in
specific terms — how much is
enough and why. "It's ridicul
ous," said Proxmire. "Imagine
what they'd say if we did that on
domestic programs."
WASHINGTON — Without
so much as a drum roll. Congress
is about to launch the American
military's biggest peacetime
buildup.
The congressional approval
will take the form of budget ceil
ings established for national de
fense for the next three years —
fiscal 1981 through 1983. While
the Senate and House are cur
rently at odds over whose budget
numbers to adopt, the Senate
Budget Committee reckons that
its higher objectives for defense
spending would total about $1
trillion over the next five years.
The unspoken fact of this new
defense buildup is that it will not
make the United States the un
disputed No. 1 in global military
might.
In fact, assuming continued
peace, the U.S. armed services
will eat up that trillion dollars
without -growing much bigger
than they are today. Five years
from now, critics still will be able
to deplore the various "gaps" be
tween the U.S. and Soviet milit
ary — the tank gap and the naval
gap and the fighter plane gap and
the nuclear megatonnage gap.
How can the president and
Congress go on a five-year shop
ping spree which is going to buy
so much frustration? The answer
lies in the complexity of modern
weapons and the uncontrollable
costs of maintaining America's
military forces.
Procurement
— Only about one-fourth of
the Pentagon's total budget goes
to buy weapons, the procure
ment account. The rest goes to
pay, house and feed soldiers; to
maintain weapons already on
hand and to conduct research on
promising wonder weapons. The
$250 billion which under normal
apportionment will go for pro
curement over the next five years
— assuming the Senate's projec
tions prove accurate — does not
seem to buy as much because the
new modern weapons cost so
much more than the old ones
they replace.
Inflation accounts from some
of this price escalation, but only a

minor part. A Sherman tank
would cost only about $235,000
in today's inflated dollars, still
vastly cheaper than the XM-1
tanks which the Army will buy.
Pentagon executives attribute
much of the difference to quality.
Critics call it gold-plating. But
post-World War II history does
show that U.S. decisionmakers
have consistently opted for
high-technology, sophisticated
weaponry instead of simpler,
cheaper and sometimes more re
liable versions.
Will citizens begin to ask why
their tax dollars seem to be buy
ing so little strength in relation to
the Soviet Union? Some Penta
gon leaders already argue that
the usual "we" vs. "they" com
parisons in men, tanks and
mega tonnage do not explain the
true relative strengths of the two
superpowers.
Defense Secretary Harold
Brown, in his fiscal 1980 posture
statement, insisted that such
comparisons "can be extraordi
narily misleading when it comes
to making judgments about the
adequacy of our forces or how to
correct their deficiencies.
Allies ignored
"While we would be fighting
alongside allies in most cases, the
comparisons frequently omit
their forces. They also leave out
such crucial variables as objec
tives, geography and contingen
cies. The impression they give is
that the United States and Soviet
Union are going to meet on a
jousting field, where they will
engage in a fight to the finish
with all their bombs, bullets,
tanks, ships and aircraft — pos
sibly with allies, but more likely
without them.
Brown warned: "These com
parisons can also lead to the con
clusion that the way to improve
or restore our posture is to make
its details a mirror-image of
Soviet capabilities. That would
be a mistake."
But such appeals have been
undercut by the president's own
policy statements starting with
President Jimmy Carter's rever

sal of his own 1976 campaign
promise to cut defense spending
$5 billion to $7 billion a year. In
1978, Carter convened a NATO
"summit" conference in
Washington where, under his
prodding, the United States and
its allies promised to increase de
fense spending by 3 percent a
year, after allowing for inflation.
Sen. William Proxmire (D-
Wis.) is among the critics who
insist that instead of setting fixed
percentage growth rates for de
fense spending the Pentagon
budget should be justified in
specific terms — how much is
enough and why. "It's ridicul
ous," said Proxmire. "Imagine
