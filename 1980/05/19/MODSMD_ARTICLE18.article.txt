# Discussions may replace forms in course evaluations
## 
### Karen Springen Staff Writer 
A new teaching evaluation
method may soon relieve some
students' frustrations at the
generalities of the current course
evaluation forms.
The Small Group Instruc
tional Diagnosis (SGID) method
of course evaluation, developed
last year at the University of
Washington, offers a more
specific, 30-minute supplemen
tary evaluation. SGID involves
within-class discussion among
small groups of up to six people.
According to Michele Fisher,
director of the Center for Teach
ing and Learning here, the prog
ram will probably be added as an
optional teaching aide next year.
University of Washington rep
resentatives visited five classes
here last month and conducted
experimental evaluation ses
sions. The representatives vis
ited classes taught by German
Studies Prof. Walter Lohnes,
Psychology Lecturer Harrietf
Mischel, Anthropology Prof.
James Gibbs, Asst. Philosophy
Prof. Michael Bratman and Asst.
Mathematics Prof. Dan
Rudolph.
"In every class I witnessed, the
students and professors were
very enthusiastic about it,"
Fisher said.
Each discussion group meets
for 10 minutes to decide the as

pects of the course they like and
dislike. The groups also develop
the means to accomplish the
suggested improvements.
For the next 10 minutes, the
group reports back to the
facilitator. The facilitator helps
students identify specifics about
their likes and dislikes.
The facilitator summarizes
and asks for opinions in the final
10 minutes, said Fisher. She
asked that the evaluation can be
completed in less than the allot
ted 30 minutes.
The new evaluation programs
should not cost anything extra,
said Fisher. The total budget for
all evaluations is now about
$30,000, she said.
Rudolph volunteered to have
project director Joe Clark, Biol
ogy Prof, at the University of
Washington who started the pro
ject three years ago, visit his
class.
"I thought it was really quite
marvelous. We were in the
midst of some very dull and
heavy mathematics, and it gave

me some feedback that 1 just
wasn't getting," Rudolph said.
He said his students have been
more conscientious since the ex
periment.
Rudolph cited several con
cerns with the project, however.
The explicit comments elicited
from students and the presence
of the skilled facilitator can be
frightening for the professor, lie
said,
He added that "most of the
faculty who would be most be
nefitted woiijld never vo'lunteer
to do it."
According to Fisher, some
Washington schools, in addition
to the University of Washington,
are now using the evaluation
regularly. UC-Davis will proba
bly adopt the system next year,
she added.
Other evaluation methods
now being used include clas
sroom visits by faculty col
leagues, free videotaping, per
sonalized emeriti assistance and
college teaching books available
at the Teaching Center.
