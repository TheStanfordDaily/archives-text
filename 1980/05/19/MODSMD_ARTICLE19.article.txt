# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## I'm not smart enough to quit 
### 
It's Monday morning, so I'm
sure you'll agree with me. Some
times it seems like studying is the
least intelligent thing a person
can do.
Just think about it. Of all the
things you could do in a day, why
take the time to bury your nose
in a book? It's a lot of work being
a student, and you do it all for
free. Or worse yet, you pay for
the privilege to do it along with
several thousand other confused
souls here at Stanford. Boy, do
you pay.
Other people get paid for
working. If they're successful.

they'll almost make enough
money during one year to pay for
one student's full-year tuition at
Stanford. (Of course. I describe
my parents.)
It may not be very smart to be
in school these days. When 1 look
at the economy, I begin to think
my timing may be off. The way
things are going. 1 wonder if we'll
even have an economy at all by
the time 1 graduate. 1 don't think
Stanford offers any courses in
Applied Huntingand Gathering.
(Perhaps the new distribution
requirements may include an In
troduction to Urban Foraging?)
Don't worry, you say, you'll
have it easy once you've earned
your degree in electrical en
gineering. Easier said than done.
Who's to say it's not easier to
attend a technical training school
so you can make a modest for
tune repairing Hewlett-Packard
computers. Then you could af
ford the education it takes to
learn how to design one.
No, it doesn't pay to be a stu

dent. Not when you spend your
entire summer earning enough
money to enable you to buy next
year's textbooks. Not when your
old high school dropout buddy
invites you to his new home to
listen to his new stereo.
But wait, you say, money isn't
everything. What about the be
nefits of college that can't be
quantified? Think of the oppor
tunities to share new ideas, to
meet other actively concerned
people, to work toward benefi
cial change in our society.
Well, I've been to most of the
rallies in White Plaza, and I've

written to my congressman, and
it still seems very likely that we
Children of the Sixties will soon
be asked to register for the milit
ary draft. 1 don't much like the
tragic possibilities that lie further
down that bloody path, so it
makes me stop to ponder a few
things.
Such as what am 1 doing in
class, studying for The Future,
when a handful of powerful men
may have the final word on my
own immediate future. Just to
think about that makes me want
to run into the hills behind cam
pus and chase cows all day,
celebrating the spring air. blue
skies, and Youth. Sounds rather
bucolic, but I'd rather chase cows
than jeeps (and I'd rather follow
mules than generals.)
How can anyone study with
everything that's going on in the
world today? I sympathize with
Woody Allen: if 1 know that one
person is starving in Sri Lanka, it
ruins my whole day.
I can't concentrate on a lecture

once I've read the headlines be
fore class. Now both President
Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan want to blockade Cuba,
and my professor wants me to
read 254 pages of Flaubert. Ter
rorists are invading foreign em
bassies around the world, while I
struggle to understand the be
havior of Paramecium that in
vade jars of yeast.
Not that 1 could ever do much
about Carter. Reagan or ter
ronsts, but for some crazy reason
1 feel nervous when 1 sit down at
my carrel to study, fully aware
that at any moment the world
may come crashing through the
roof of Meyer Library and dis
turb my nap.
I guess sometimes 1 just find it
odd that we talk of preparing
ourselves for the future while
isolating ourselves from our fu
ture environments. Others fight
the pressures of everyday life
while we study our hearts away
behind the sandstone walls of Le
land's castle. Sure, there are
plenty of surrogate pressures in
college, with midterms, various
deadlines, and finals. But the
worry spent over grades can't
measure up to the worry spent
over food bills. I feel somewhat
like a second-class citizen be
cause I don't confront the ulti
mate pressure: the daily chal
lenge to contribute your fair
share to the United States GNP.
After all this complaining, why
do 1 continue to bury my nose in
books? The answer is painfully
simple.
I'm not smart enough to quit.

Children of the Sixties will soon
be asked to register for the milit
ary draft. 1 don't much like the
tragic possibilities that lie further
down that bloody path, so it
makes me stop to ponder a few
things.
Such as what am 1 doing in
class, studying for The Future,
when a handful of powerful men
may have the final word on my
own immediate future. Just to
think about that makes me want
to run into the hills behind cam
pus and chase cows all day,
celebrating the spring air. blue
skies, and Youth. Sounds rather
bucolic, but I'd rather chase cows
than jeeps (and I'd rather follow
mules than generals.)
How can anyone study with
everything that's going on in the
world today? I sympathize with
Woody Allen: if 1 know that one
person is starving in Sri Lanka, it
ruins my whole day.
I can't concentrate on a lecture

once I've read the headlines be
fore class. Now both President
Jimmy Carter and Ronald
Reagan want to blockade Cuba,
and my professor wants me to
read 254 pages of Flaubert. Ter
rorists are invading foreign em
bassies around the world, while I
struggle to understand the be
havior of Paramecium that in
vade jars of yeast.
Not that 1 could ever do much
about Carter. Reagan or ter
ronsts, but for some crazy reason
1 feel nervous when 1 sit down at
my carrel to study, fully aware
that at any moment the world
may come crashing through the
roof of Meyer Library and dis
turb my nap.
I guess sometimes 1 just find it
odd that we talk of preparing
ourselves for the future while
isolating ourselves from our fu
ture environments. Others fight
the pressures of everyday life
while we study our hearts away
behind the sandstone walls of Le
land's castle. Sure, there are
plenty of surrogate pressures in
college, with midterms, various
deadlines, and finals. But the
worry spent over grades can't
measure up to the worry spent
over food bills. I feel somewhat
like a second-class citizen be
cause I don't confront the ulti
mate pressure: the daily chal
lenge to contribute your fair
share to the United States GNP.
After all this complaining, why
do 1 continue to bury my nose in
books? The answer is painfully
simple.
I'm not smart enough to quit.

It's Monday morning, so I'm
sure you'll agree with me. Some
times it seems like studying is the
least intelligent thing a person
can do.
Just think about it. Of all the
things you could do in a day, why
take the time to bury your nose
in a book? It's a lot of work being
a student, and you do it all for
free. Or worse yet, you pay for
the privilege to do it along with
several thousand other confused
souls here at Stanford. Boy, do
you pay.
Other people get paid for
working. If they're successful.

they'll almost make enough
money during one year to pay for
one student's full-year tuition at
Stanford. (Of course. I describe
my parents.)
It may not be very smart to be
in school these days. When 1 look
at the economy, I begin to think
my timing may be off. The way
things are going. 1 wonder if we'll
even have an economy at all by
the time 1 graduate. 1 don't think
Stanford offers any courses in
Applied Huntingand Gathering.
(Perhaps the new distribution
requirements may include an In
troduction to Urban Foraging?)
Don't worry, you say, you'll
have it easy once you've earned
your degree in electrical en
gineering. Easier said than done.
Who's to say it's not easier to
attend a technical training school
so you can make a modest for
tune repairing Hewlett-Packard
computers. Then you could af
ford the education it takes to
learn how to design one.
No, it doesn't pay to be a stu

dent. Not when you spend your
entire summer earning enough
money to enable you to buy next
year's textbooks. Not when your
old high school dropout buddy
invites you to his new home to
listen to his new stereo.
But wait, you say, money isn't
everything. What about the be
nefits of college that can't be
quantified? Think of the oppor
tunities to share new ideas, to
meet other actively concerned
people, to work toward benefi
cial change in our society.
Well, I've been to most of the
rallies in White Plaza, and I've

written to my congressman, and
it still seems very likely that we
