# Drell testifies before Senate panel
## Expert calls MX system flawed 
### Susan Hajda Staff Writer 
A Stanford expert called the MX
missile "racetrack" system "seriously
flawed" in testimony before a Senate
subcommittee in Washington, D.C. last
week.
* Deputy Director of SLAC, Sidney
Drell, told members of the Defense
and Military Construction Subcommit
tees of the Appropriations Committee
that he does not favor a system that
relies on deception and secrecy for its
survivability.
"I prefer to put our security into
good technology rather than put the
burden on secrecy or deception. I see
no sensible reason to use a basic system
that requires those characteristics."
Instead, Drell proposed basing mis
siles on small, highly mobile coastal
submarines. He said the subs would
provide quiet, fast, and safe bases for
the missiles at a cost $10 billion below
that of the racetrack system.
Drell, who is also the head of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center's
theoretical physics unit, criticized the
Carter Administration's plans for a
racetrack basing mode, which has now
been abandoned in favor of the prop
osed linear grid.

However, Drell says the only real
difference between the grid and the
racetrack is that the loop of the race
track has now heen straightened out.
Drell said he believes another advan
tage of the shallow underwater mobile
force (SUM) over the grid is that the
survivability of SUM depends only on
concealment of the submarines, while
the grid relies on deception as well as
concealment.
Proponents of the grid system feel it
will maintain the land leg of the na
tion's so-called defense Triad. Cur
rently, U.S. security depends on bom
bers, Trident submarines, , and
Minuteman missiles which are located
in underground silos. But due to in
creasingly accurate and numerous
Soviet missiles, these ICBMs are now
perceived as vulnerable to an all-out
Soviet missile attack. To maintain a
credible land system and the Triad, first
the racetrack and then the grid were
proposed.
200 grids
Each of the 200 grids would contain
one missile which would travel along a
track. The missile could be launched
from any one of 23 shelters adjacent to
its track. The Soviets would have to
bomb all 23 shelters located one mile

from each other to be certain of de
stroying the missile.
The success of the system depends
on the ratification of SALT 11. If the
treaty were ratified by the United
States, the Soviets would not possess
enough re-entry vehicles to be certain
of destroying all the shelters. The sur
vivability of the missiles would act as a
deterrent against Soviet attack, propo
nents say.
But according to Drell, without the
limits imposed by SALT 11, the Soviets
could easily possess up to 17,000 po
tential "shelter-killer" warheads. The
U.S. would have to triple the number of
grid shelters just to maintain the cur
rently planned level of survivable
megatonnage with a deployment of
200 MX missiles.
'Difficult targeting'
Drell favors the SUM force â€” using
40 to 60 small, non-nuclear powered
submarines. The 450 to 1000 ton subs
would operate within a 200-mile-wide
band and each could carry up to four
mounted MX missiles. The subs,
operating in coastal waters patroled by
the U.S. Navy, would pose a "difficult
targeting problem" for the Soviets, un
like the missiles in the linear grid. Drell
said.
A Department of Defense study of
SUM concluded that SUM would not
be any cheaper than the racetrack and
would represent an abandonment of
the Triad in favor of a Dyad of bombers
and submarines.
Strongly disagreeing, Drell said the
report "grossly overestimated ' costs
for the small sub bases and loaded them
with unnecessary electronic gear.
'Triad not abandoned''
Dress added that the Triad would
not be abandoned. He said there are
major differences between SI M and
Trident in operating procedures and in
antisubmarine warfare. The SUM
boats are smaller and more numerous
than the 18,000-ton, nuclear powered

tridents, making the SUM force very
difficult to trail. However, Drell added
that the Trident is also nearly impossi
ble to detect now. He also said that he
cannot imagine any future potential
threats to SUM that could not be neut
ralized bv U.S. technological and oper
ational measures.
Drell said he does not feel the seri
ousness of the Soviet threat mandates
reacting without fully investigating all
possibilities.
"We need to do the right thing rather
than the quickest thing," he said.
