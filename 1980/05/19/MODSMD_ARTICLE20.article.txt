## All men still bleed red...and die 
### 
For the past year I have worked part-time
at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SL AC) and had the good fortune of sharing
an office with a visiting scholar from the
People's Republic of China. During this time
we have grown to be good friends as I have
helped him with his English and he has'
taught me a little Chinese. We often talk of
current events, especially articles in the Daily
and I try to explain the background or cus
toms underlying the article to him.
One day last week I was working at my
desk and he came in with a Daily in his hand.
We exchanged greetings in Chinese and then
he pointed to a news article stating the
Chinese were testing their ICBM missiles in
the Pacific Ocean. He said this was very good
for the Chinese. 1 don't know why, but I
replied in a rather uncharacteristic fashion.
1 said that building weapons to kill people
isn't "good' for anyone, least of all the buil

der. He was rather shocked by this, tor I
gather he expected a rational answer from an
informed individual acknowledging the tact
that this was not only good from his view
point, being Chinese and concerned with the
military strength of his country, but also from
my point of view as an American, that a
stronger China will force the Russians to di
vide their forces even more deeply between
their eastern and western borders.
He pursued the subject further, trying to
prove to me that a reasonable person would
have to admit that at least from any one
country's standpoint, military strength was
an asset — it provided peace through deter
rence. I let him continue by nodding my head
but resisted inside. Inside 1 was torn between
acknowledging his reasonable proposition
and feeling that no matter where we are,
what we think or how reasonable life seems,
all men still bleed red . . . and die.
I have become painfully aware that reason

and rationality are heavy shackles !• choose to
wear. They simply legitimize the present
train of thought in society: they do not reveal
what's true for me. We have rationalized
ourselves into believing that having guns will
bring peace, and in the process forgotten that
being peaceful yields the same results.
In all likelihood tomorrow 1 will go back to
agreeing with President Jimmy Carter,
Ronald Reagan or whoever it is that says we
need to spend money on arms to insure
peace; but today I do not feel that this type of
rationality will bring us any closer to lasting
peace. Reason cannot solve the incongruities
of life.
This column is not meant to provide a solu
tion for the arms race, rather it is simply my
attempt to share my feelings of frustration at
the paradox between being rational and
being what I want to be.
