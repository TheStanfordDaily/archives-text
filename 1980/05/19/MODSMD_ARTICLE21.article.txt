# Friday Forum finished
## 
### 
The Friday Forum, fantastic feature for free-lancers, finally
finishes its fabulous phase. Frequently flourishing with fanciful and
factual phraseology, the Forum fared famously â€” we flipped! The
Forum flaunted first-class feedback from future philosophers. Finally
foreseen is the Forum's forced fate: folding. Farewell fluent friends!
Anticipating a decreased number of contributions to the Forum as
finals and summer approach, the feature has been discontinued.
Current plans are to revive the Friday Forum at the start of the next
volume this fall.
