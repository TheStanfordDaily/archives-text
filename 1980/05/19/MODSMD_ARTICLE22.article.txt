President Richard Lyman's letter to the editor of May 14, "Lyman:
gay arrests." incorrectly stated: "I do not believe that the University
is amiss in seeking to ensure that normal people who want to use
these restrooms for their normal intended purpose will not be inhi
bited by behavior that they find highly offensive."
The letter should have read: "I do not believe that the University is
amiss in seeking to ensure that people who want to use these re
strooms for their normal intended purpose will not be inhibited by
behavior that they find highly offensive." The Daily regrets the
misprint.
