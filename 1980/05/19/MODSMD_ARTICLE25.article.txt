## Asbestos lurks in lungs of 4 million workers 
### 
Since the passage of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act in 1970, tremendous progress has been made
in the United State toward the prevention of
occupationally-induced diseases. However, despite a
significant reduction in the incidence of exposure to
hazardous substances at the American workplace, a si
lent killer presently lurks within the lungs of over four
million individuals.
Tiny fibers of asbestos inhaled years before such pro
tective laws were insituted are expected to kill an esti
mated 1.6 million workers by the end of the century.
Asbestos causes three major diseases, none of which is
currently amenable to effective treatment. One is asbes
tosis, a non-cancerous scarring of the lungs which prog
ressively renders breathing more difficult. The other two
are cancers — lung cancer similar to that linked with
cigarette smoking, and mesothelioma, a tumor affecting
the lining of the chest and abdomen which is invariably
fatal.
According to Dr. Philip Polakoff, a specialist in occu
pational medicine, an average of 67,000 asbestos
induced cancers per year will occur for the next 30 to 35
years, representing about 17 percent of all cancer pre
sently diagnosed in the United States.
The dangers of asbestos exposure have been known
for decades. The first case of asbestosis was reported in
1907; asbestos-induced lung cancer was first noted in
1935; mesothelioma was discovered in 1946. In 1930, a
British researcher discovered asbestosis in 81 percent of
workers with 30 years of asbestos exposure.
Despite these facts, until 1972, the Johns-Manville
Corporation, the nation's largest asbestos company, had

a policy of not informing employees when their chest
X-rays showed early signs of asbestos-related lung dis
ease. This unforgivable cover-up was exposed in a sworn
deposition by Wilbur Ruff, who held management posi
tions at company asbestos facilities in Pittsburgh,
California and Manville, New Jersey between 1963 and
1974.
Further evidence that the American asbestos worker
has been unjustifiably taken advantage of by the indus
try has come to light via congressional committee hear
ings. Documents have indicated knowledge of asbestos
related health risks by high-level officials in the asbestos
industry as early as 1934, according to Rep. George
Miller (D-Calif.). Letters dated 1934 urging researchers
to delete compromising data from their studies of asbes
tos have been uncovered.
It is clear from these facts that millions of former auto
mechanics, construction workers, and shipbuilders who
helped build our industrialized nation were unknow
ingly dying for a living in the process. Among them is a
53-year-old man named Jim Vermeulen, who con
tracted asbestosis from 1957 to 1966 while employed as
a production coordinator for Johns-Manville.
After unsuccessfully filing suit against the company,
along with other affected workers, Vermeulen formed
an organization called "Asbestos Victims of America,"
the goal of which is just compensation for victims like
himself and their dependents.
Such endeavors, while certainly justified in view of the
industry's unfair treatment of the asbestos worker, are
doomed to failure without significant public support. As
concerned American citizens, we can all contribute to a

clearly beneficial cause by supporting pending asbestos
legislation. At the state level. Assemblyman Art Agnos
has introduced AB 946, known as the "Asbestos Work
ers' Fund," which would pay prompt workmen's com
pensation benefits to qualified victims while lengthy liti
gation continues.
Rep. Edward Beard (D-Rhode Island) has proposed
Federal bill H R 5482, which would strengthen and make
uniform workers' compensation programs, and other
purposes, in all states. Also at the Federal level, HR
4973 by Miller would impose criminal penalties on busi
ness and management for non-disclosure, when failing
to warn employees and notify appropriate federal agen
cies that their product or business practice presents a
serious danger of bodily injury or death to their
employees.
Similar legislation such as the Black Lung Act, which
offers compensation to former coal miners with
occupationally-related lung disease, has been criticized
for including undeserving individuals with minimally
impaired respiratory function resulting from other
causes. Flowever, the cause-and-effect relationship bet
ween asbestos exposure and specific forms of lung dis
ease (such as mesothelioma) is firmly established. Ap
propriate diagnostic tests and the clinical judgment of
competent physicians should minimize unwarranted
compensation of former asbestos workers.
As a society, our acumen for environmental hazards
has become increasingly sharp in recent years, but we
cannot neglect those whose health has become irreversi
bly damaged as a result of past mistakes.

causes. Flowever, the cause-and-effect relationship bet
ween asbestos exposure and specific forms of lung dis
ease (such as mesothelioma) is firmly established. Ap
propriate diagnostic tests and the clinical judgment of
competent physicians should minimize unwarranted
compensation of former asbestos workers.
As a society, our acumen for environmental hazards
has become increasingly sharp in recent years, but we
cannot neglect those whose health has become irreversi
bly damaged as a result of past mistakes.

Since the passage of the Occupational Safety and
Health Act in 1970, tremendous progress has been made
in the United State toward the prevention of
occupationally-induced diseases. However, despite a
significant reduction in the incidence of exposure to
hazardous substances at the American workplace, a si
lent killer presently lurks within the lungs of over four
million individuals.
Tiny fibers of asbestos inhaled years before such pro
tective laws were insituted are expected to kill an esti
mated 1.6 million workers by the end of the century.
Asbestos causes three major diseases, none of which is
currently amenable to effective treatment. One is asbes
tosis, a non-cancerous scarring of the lungs which prog
ressively renders breathing more difficult. The other two
are cancers — lung cancer similar to that linked with
cigarette smoking, and mesothelioma, a tumor affecting
the lining of the chest and abdomen which is invariably
fatal.
According to Dr. Philip Polakoff, a specialist in occu
pational medicine, an average of 67,000 asbestos
induced cancers per year will occur for the next 30 to 35
years, representing about 17 percent of all cancer pre
sently diagnosed in the United States.
The dangers of asbestos exposure have been known
for decades. The first case of asbestosis was reported in
1907; asbestos-induced lung cancer was first noted in
1935; mesothelioma was discovered in 1946. In 1930, a
British researcher discovered asbestosis in 81 percent of
workers with 30 years of asbestos exposure.
Despite these facts, until 1972, the Johns-Manville
Corporation, the nation's largest asbestos company, had

a policy of not informing employees when their chest
X-rays showed early signs of asbestos-related lung dis
ease. This unforgivable cover-up was exposed in a sworn
deposition by Wilbur Ruff, who held management posi
tions at company asbestos facilities in Pittsburgh,
California and Manville, New Jersey between 1963 and
1974.
Further evidence that the American asbestos worker
has been unjustifiably taken advantage of by the indus
try has come to light via congressional committee hear
ings. Documents have indicated knowledge of asbestos
related health risks by high-level officials in the asbestos
industry as early as 1934, according to Rep. George
Miller (D-Calif.). Letters dated 1934 urging researchers
to delete compromising data from their studies of asbes
tos have been uncovered.
It is clear from these facts that millions of former auto
mechanics, construction workers, and shipbuilders who
helped build our industrialized nation were unknow
ingly dying for a living in the process. Among them is a
53-year-old man named Jim Vermeulen, who con
tracted asbestosis from 1957 to 1966 while employed as
a production coordinator for Johns-Manville.
After unsuccessfully filing suit against the company,
along with other affected workers, Vermeulen formed
an organization called "Asbestos Victims of America,"
the goal of which is just compensation for victims like
himself and their dependents.
Such endeavors, while certainly justified in view of the
industry's unfair treatment of the asbestos worker, are
doomed to failure without significant public support. As
concerned American citizens, we can all contribute to a

clearly beneficial cause by supporting pending asbestos
legislation. At the state level. Assemblyman Art Agnos
has introduced AB 946, known as the "Asbestos Work
ers' Fund," which would pay prompt workmen's com
pensation benefits to qualified victims while lengthy liti
gation continues.
Rep. Edward Beard (D-Rhode Island) has proposed
Federal bill H R 5482, which would strengthen and make
uniform workers' compensation programs, and other
purposes, in all states. Also at the Federal level, HR
4973 by Miller would impose criminal penalties on busi
ness and management for non-disclosure, when failing
to warn employees and notify appropriate federal agen
cies that their product or business practice presents a
serious danger of bodily injury or death to their
employees.
Similar legislation such as the Black Lung Act, which
offers compensation to former coal miners with
occupationally-related lung disease, has been criticized
for including undeserving individuals with minimally
impaired respiratory function resulting from other
causes. Flowever, the cause-and-effect relationship bet
ween asbestos exposure and specific forms of lung dis
ease (such as mesothelioma) is firmly established. Ap
propriate diagnostic tests and the clinical judgment of
competent physicians should minimize unwarranted
compensation of former asbestos workers.
