Statistics misused
It is unfortunate that Rep
resentative Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) continues to
misuse statistics in attempting to
justify his national service prop
osal. An article (Daily, May 13)
quotes him once again blaming
the volunteer military force for
the fact that the United States
spends 55 percent of its defense
budget on manpower, while the
Soviet Union spends only 23
percent.
In fact, defense manpower in
cludes many types of personnel,
including retired officers, consul
tants and civilian employees. Of
the $59.9 billion spent on de
fense manpower in 1976, only
$5.2 billion went to enlistees in
their first two years of serv ice —
the group that would be most af
fected by a restoration of the
draft.
A General Accounting Office
study concluded that the volun
teer force cost about $3.27 bill
ion (about 3.6 percent of the de
fense budget) in 1976, and that
not all of this could be saved by
reverting to the draft now.
It is especially sad that
McCloskey attempts to use
economics as a justification for
his own national service prop
osal. This program would be
more than a restoration of the
draft, since it would require the
creation of 350,000 to 600,000
additional government jobs for
young people electing the civi
lian service alternative.

My own study of the McClos
key program suggests that the
program would cost taxpayers
two to four billion dollars more
than the volunteer force did in
1976; the cost would be substan
tially higher if implemented to
day. Nor does this cost take into
account the fact that the national
service program itself represents
a hidden tax on young people,
collected in the form of in
adequately compensated labor.

Pleased by arrests
With regard to the group letter
(Daily, May 16) that, in effect,
complained about Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer
having done his duty, I would
like to share some information
and views since none of the au
thors use our building on a regu
lar basis.
For those who, over a long
period of time, repeatedly use
one of our lavatories for illegal
purposes, there was never any
question about the Art Depart
ment being responsible for a
"climate of implied tolerance."
We made it clear over the years in
a variety of ways that certain
conduct was not wanted and that
in other locations it had led to
arrests.
Specifically, the stall doors
were removed a few years ago.
None but the most opaque or the

most aggressive could ignore
that signal. Second, the lavatory
was locked on weekends and
during recess periods and signs
were posted to that effect. Third,
even when the building was
completely locked on weekends,
we repeatedly found a side door
nearest the lavatory in question
propped open. We would close it
and then find it propped open
again within the hour.
Fourth, newspaper articles
which recounted actual arrests
for "lewd and lascivious con
duct" in public lavatories
elsewhere were repeatedly
posted in our own lavatory. They
were torn down almost im
mediately.
People authorized to work in
this building on weekends and at
night were always uneasy about
security. Those who use this
building on a regular basis are
frankly pleased to have it re
stored to us by Niemeyer's ac
tions.

U.S. independents
By election day 1980, inde
pendents may well be the largest
political group in this country.
Over the past 25 years, there has
been a national movement to
ward increasing political inde
pendence and diminishing parti
sanship. While a 1978 Univer
sity of Michigan survey showed

75 percent of the American elec
torate belonging to a party, only
60 percent identified themselves
with a party then — 39 per
cent as Democrat and 21 percent
as Republican.
John Anderson recently drop
ped out of the Republican prim
ary race in order to tap what he
believes to be an enormous voter
discontent with the expected
major party choice between
President Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan.
Indeed, when half the people
in a recent New York Times/
CBS News poll express dissatis
faction with a Carter-Reagan
choice, there is tremendous po
tential for a third man on the bal
lot.
Yet while the unstable voter
mood gives hope to Anderson,
the legal and political obstacles
of the present electoral system
are overwhelming. Anderson
will have difficulty just getting on
the state ballots. He has already
missed the deadline in five states
for filing for independent candi
dacy, a situation he plans to chal
lenge in court on the grounds
that it is arbitrary and capricious.
Federal funding regulations
also work to the disadvantage of
independent or third-party can
didates. While Anderson will not
receive a federal campaign sub
sidy except, perhaps, after the
fact, the major party candidates
will each have $29.4 million in
federal funds to spend.
Nevertheless, independents
must abide by the federal con

tribution limit of $1000 per per
son.
Given these obstacles, it is no
wonder that most Americans as
sume that no third-p'arty or in
dependent presidential candi
date has a real chance to win. A
strong American belief in the
two-party system has led to the
development of an electoral
format that is tightly stacked
against a third-party or indepen
dent candidate.
The serious problem that re
sults from this is the limiting of
choices for a large sector of the
voting population. This situation
risks harming something far
more important than the two
party system — public confi
dence in the whole political pro
cess.

Greeks misnamed

Statistics misused
It is unfortunate that Rep
resentative Pete McCloskey
(R-Menlo Park) continues to
misuse statistics in attempting to
justify his national service prop
osal. An article (Daily, May 13)
quotes him once again blaming
the volunteer military force for
the fact that the United States
spends 55 percent of its defense
budget on manpower, while the
Soviet Union spends only 23
percent.
In fact, defense manpower in
cludes many types of personnel,
including retired officers, consul
tants and civilian employees. Of
the $59.9 billion spent on de
fense manpower in 1976, only
$5.2 billion went to enlistees in
their first two years of serv ice —
the group that would be most af
fected by a restoration of the
draft.
A General Accounting Office
study concluded that the volun
teer force cost about $3.27 bill
ion (about 3.6 percent of the de
fense budget) in 1976, and that
not all of this could be saved by
reverting to the draft now.
It is especially sad that
McCloskey attempts to use
economics as a justification for
his own national service prop
osal. This program would be
more than a restoration of the
draft, since it would require the
creation of 350,000 to 600,000
additional government jobs for
young people electing the civi
lian service alternative.

My own study of the McClos
key program suggests that the
program would cost taxpayers
two to four billion dollars more
than the volunteer force did in
1976; the cost would be substan
tially higher if implemented to
day. Nor does this cost take into
account the fact that the national
service program itself represents
a hidden tax on young people,
collected in the form of in
adequately compensated labor.

Pleased by arrests
With regard to the group letter
(Daily, May 16) that, in effect,
complained about Stanford
Police Captain Raoul Niemeyer
having done his duty, I would
like to share some information
and views since none of the au
thors use our building on a regu
lar basis.
For those who, over a long
period of time, repeatedly use
one of our lavatories for illegal
purposes, there was never any
question about the Art Depart
ment being responsible for a
"climate of implied tolerance."
We made it clear over the years in
a variety of ways that certain
conduct was not wanted and that
in other locations it had led to
arrests.
Specifically, the stall doors
were removed a few years ago.
None but the most opaque or the

most aggressive could ignore
that signal. Second, the lavatory
was locked on weekends and
during recess periods and signs
were posted to that effect. Third,
even when the building was
completely locked on weekends,
we repeatedly found a side door
nearest the lavatory in question
propped open. We would close it
and then find it propped open
again within the hour.
Fourth, newspaper articles
which recounted actual arrests
for "lewd and lascivious con
duct" in public lavatories
elsewhere were repeatedly
posted in our own lavatory. They
were torn down almost im
mediately.
People authorized to work in
this building on weekends and at
night were always uneasy about
security. Those who use this
building on a regular basis are
frankly pleased to have it re
stored to us by Niemeyer's ac
tions.

U.S. independents
By election day 1980, inde
pendents may well be the largest
political group in this country.
Over the past 25 years, there has
been a national movement to
ward increasing political inde
pendence and diminishing parti
sanship. While a 1978 Univer
sity of Michigan survey showed

75 percent of the American elec
torate belonging to a party, only
60 percent identified themselves
with a party then — 39 per
cent as Democrat and 21 percent
as Republican.
John Anderson recently drop
ped out of the Republican prim
ary race in order to tap what he
believes to be an enormous voter
discontent with the expected
major party choice between
President Jimmy Carter and
Ronald Reagan.
Indeed, when half the people
in a recent New York Times/
CBS News poll express dissatis
faction with a Carter-Reagan
choice, there is tremendous po
tential for a third man on the bal
lot.
Yet while the unstable voter
mood gives hope to Anderson,
the legal and political obstacles
of the present electoral system
are overwhelming. Anderson
will have difficulty just getting on
the state ballots. He has already
missed the deadline in five states
for filing for independent candi
dacy, a situation he plans to chal
lenge in court on the grounds
that it is arbitrary and capricious.
Federal funding regulations
also work to the disadvantage of
independent or third-party can
didates. While Anderson will not
receive a federal campaign sub
sidy except, perhaps, after the
fact, the major party candidates
will each have $29.4 million in
federal funds to spend.
Nevertheless, independents
must abide by the federal con

tribution limit of $1000 per per
son.
Given these obstacles, it is no
wonder that most Americans as
sume that no third-p'arty or in
dependent presidential candi
date has a real chance to win. A
strong American belief in the
two-party system has led to the
development of an electoral
format that is tightly stacked
against a third-party or indepen
dent candidate.
The serious problem that re
sults from this is the limiting of
choices for a large sector of the
voting population. This situation
risks harming something far
more important than the two
party system — public confi
dence in the whole political pro
