# Strike deadline still Thursday
## Major league negotiations cut off 
### Hal Bock The Associated Press 
NEW YORK — Negotiations in the
stalemated baseball cohffact talks abruptly
broke off yesterday, four days before the
May 22 strike deadline.
Representatives of the owners and players
attended two bargaining sbssions with fed
eral mediator Kenneth Moffett but met to
gether for only two or three minutes before
the talks ended.
Moffett declared a recess and returned to
Washington, D.C. with his counsel, David
Vaughn. The mediator said he and Vaughn
would remain in touch with both sides and
that he expected to call them back into ses
sion before the deadline of midnight Thurs
day.
"I can't see any light at the end of this
tunnel," Moffett said dejectedly. "The
chances for averting a strike are not good."
He said there would not be any talks today.
The atmosphere in these talks turned de
cidedly frigid Friday when both sides re
jected proposals from the other.

The owners turned down a suggestion that
the rest of the contract be settled while the
difficult free agent compensation question is
placed on hold for two years and a study
committee examines the question.
The players dismissed an owners' bid to
continue all terms of the expired 1976 ag
reement through the start of the 198 1 season
while bargaining continues.
At yesterday's meeting, Moffett asked the
player association representatives a single
question on behalf of, the club owners.
"The question was' What is deficieht in the
owners' proposal as it relates to impasse and
retroactivity?' " the mediator said.
The owners' representatives repeated the
question and, in a joint statement by league
presidents Lee MacPhail and Chub Feeney,
said: "We have indicated that the clubs will
continue to recognize all of the players' rights
during this season and that any improve
ments in a new basic agreement will be re
troactive when an agreement is reached.
With these assurances in place, there is no
thing to be gained by the players if they
strike."
Marvin Miller, executive director of the

union, called it "a nothing proposal, one
which would have the players work through
out the season under terms of a four-year-old
agreement."
On retroactive elements, Miller said, "If 1
give you zero, retroactively, it's still zero."
Miller seemed angrier than he has for
some time during these talks.
"There is clearly an attempt to con the
players into accepting no improvement in
their contract, to accept 1 976 terms while the
owners collect 1980 revenues. They're at
tempting to get a year free with no improve
ments," he said.
Miller also was annoyed at a question
answer document which was distributed to
players over the weekend, attempting to
show that there would be no point to a strike.
"It's a foolish attempt on the owners'
part," Miller said.
"The players basically tear them up. The
ones who don't, resent the owners talking
down to them."
