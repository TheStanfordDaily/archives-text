# Watson chokes away big bucks
## 
### Ken Denlinger The Washington Post 
FORT WORTH. Tex. — Before he hit galleryite
Julie Gann with a tee shot and missed a half-dozen
putts whose total length would not span his living
room, Stanford graduate Tom Watson had a
chance yesterday to win more money in eight days
than Ben Hogan won in all his tournament life;
more money than the entire PGA tour offered its
first two years.
"That's really absurd, isn't it?" he said. "1 don't
care what you say about how much more it costs
today, that's absurd."
Well, it is and it isn't. Men have won more than
what Watson was shooting for yesterday —
$254,000 — with one roll of the dice. Boxers have
earned much more being knocked senseless and
Sinatra gets about that much per note cerain
weekends.
Watson was the compelling figure in sports, be
cause by becoming the first player in a generation
to win four straight tournaments he could win more
money than almost anyone imagined possible even
a few months ago.
Any Tim, Vic or Howard'can win $54,000 or so
each weekend. But no one evdV had a chance at an
additional $200,000, which some Texans ottered
for the man who won both last week's Byron Nel
son Classic and this week's Colonial National Invi
tation.
This may have been the day the gods of golf
decided enough was enough for Watson, because
he lost this tournament in most un-Watsonlike
fashion. He misread the break on two birdie putts
and missed four par putts of four feet or less.

Finally, Watson was mortal around the greens
Finally, he failed to get up and down from Waco.
As his wife, Linda, said after another birdie chance
slipped by, Watson couldn't putt the ball in Steve
Martin's mouth today.
Watson suffered a pinched nerve practicing in
the rain Wednesday. He would have been unable
to play if Thursday's first round had not been
washed out, the first time in 15 years that had
happened. And when Watson blasted a sand shot
into the cup from 15 feet Friday to save par it
appeared he could buy Denton, Tex., with Sun
day's check.
Mortality struck him, though. It hit during the
morning round, with perhaps 250 fans watching; it
hit during the afternoon round, with as many as
40,000 present at times.
"I feel disappointed because I didn't play better,
not because I didn't win," he said later. "If I'd
played well, I'd have been disappointed at not win
ning."
A few moments later Watson was walking to
ward his locker in the clubhouse. He gave Don
January a playful headlock — and January, in
mock anger, said "You blew $200,000, you cho
kin' SOB."
Watson did second-guess himself on a few putts.
Then he considered the pressure of trying to win
four in 4 row and mentioned the astonishing fact
that if he had won he still would have been seven
behind the PGA record.
In 1945, Byron Nelson won 1 I straight events.
"Incredible," Watson called it, correctly, and
added: "That'sa record that'll never be touched."
