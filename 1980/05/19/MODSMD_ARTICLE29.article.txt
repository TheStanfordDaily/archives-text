# Netters seeded No. 1 in Championships
## Cards to begin NCAA's 
### Steve Mitchell Staff Writer 
Stanford's tennis team will start their drive to
wards the NCAA Championship today as they take
on the University of Utah in the opening round in
Athens, Ga. The Cards are top seeded in the tour
nament after finishing the regular season with a
17-3 record and capturing the Pacific- H) Confer
ence title. •
Utah finished the season at 13-6 and captured
the Western Athletic Conference title to qualify for
the tournament. They are seeded 16th in the 16
team draw . Stanford should he heavily favored in
the match as Utah earlier lost to Trinity 8-1 while
Stanford trounced Trinity M-O.
Stanford's toughest competition in the tourna
ment should come from the California schools.
Seeded behind Stanford, in order, are USC, UC-
Berkeley, UCLA, and Peperdine. Following these
five schools are Trinity, Arkansas, Clemson,
Princeton, Michigan, Tennessee, Georgia, Miami,
Houston, Wichita State and Utah.
The Cardinals should he at full strength going
into the championships, led by Peter Rennert and
Tim Mayotte. Rennert, the senior All-America,
finished the season with a 13-2 record in singles,
losing only to San Jose State's Nial Brash and
USC's Robert Vant' Hot. Mayotte enters the
NCAA's with a 17-match win streak after losing
his first match of the season to little known Raima
O'Jala of Southern-Illinois. Since the earlier part
of the season, Mayotte has moved from the No. 3
position up to the No. 2 spot, replacing Stanford's
other senior All-America Lloyd Bourne. Bourne,
who has yet to lose a team match in the NCAA's
moved down a notch to the No. 3 position and
finished season play with a 11-7 record.
Following the top three, Stanford coach Dick
Gould rounds out his lineup with sophomore Scott
Bondurant (14-4), freshman Dave Siegler (14-5),
and sophomore Jeff Arons (10-7). In the doubles,
Rennert and Bourne (7-5) play the top spot fol
lowed by Mayotte-Arons (8-5) and Siegler-
Bondurant (12-3).

The winner of the Stanford-Utah match w ill face
the winner of the Clemson-Princeton match on
Tuesday. If the Cards were to survive these first
two rounds, they would more than likely face either
UCLA or Peperdine in the semi-finals. Last year,
the Cards fell to UCLA in Athens 6-3 in the semi
finals. The two teams have split their home and
home series with each team taking 5-4 victories on
the opponent's home courts.
The bottom half of the draw will most likely pit
USC and California in the semi-final, although
both Trinity and Arkansas have a shot at an upset.
The first round match-ups in draw sheet order
are Stanford vs. Utah, Clemson (31-4) vs. Prince
ton (12-4), Pepperdine (19-5) vs. Georgia (22-4),
UCLA (20-4) vs. Miami (16-5), Cal (17-6) vs.
Houston (22-7), Tennessee (14-5) vs. Trinity
(17-4), Michigan (18-1) vs. Arkansas (3 1 -4), and
Wichita St. (16-6) vs. USC (19-5).
As evidenced by the high number of losses
among all the teams in the draw, the tournament
should be a wide open affair. "For the first time
that 1 can recall," commented Gould, "there are
seven teams with a real solid shot at winning it (the
NCAA's). The five California schools in particular
are very evenly matched."
With the finals of the team championships con
cluding on Thursday, the individual championships
will pick right up on Friday and run through Mon
day. The Cards placed their top five singles players
in the draw, paced by Rennert who should he fa
vored to take the crown. Last year, Rennert lost to
Fritz Beuhning of UCLA in the quarterfinals.
Stanford placed all three doubles teams in the
draw, the only team to do so. Rennert and Bourne
should have a shot at the doubles title despite their
7-5 record (three of those losses were to Cal's
Marty Davis and Chris Dunk) as the pair advanced
to the semi-finals last year.
Asked about the individual championships,
Gould rated his top two Rennert and Mayotte, as
among the top five. According to Gould, Mayotte
could very well be the dark horse in the draw.

Utah finished the season at 13-6 and captured
the Western Athletic Conference title to qualify for
the tournament. They are seeded 16th in the 16
team draw . Stanford should he heavily favored in
the match as Utah earlier lost to Trinity 8-1 while
Stanford trounced Trinity M-O.
Stanford's toughest competition in the tourna
ment should come from the California schools.
Seeded behind Stanford, in order, are USC, UC-
Berkeley, UCLA, and Peperdine. Following these
five schools are Trinity, Arkansas, Clemson,
Princeton, Michigan, Tennessee, Georgia, Miami,
Houston, Wichita State and Utah.
The Cardinals should he at full strength going
into the championships, led by Peter Rennert and
Tim Mayotte. Rennert, the senior All-America,
finished the season with a 13-2 record in singles,
losing only to San Jose State's Nial Brash and
USC's Robert Vant' Hot. Mayotte enters the
NCAA's with a 17-match win streak after losing
his first match of the season to little known Raima
O'Jala of Southern-Illinois. Since the earlier part
of the season, Mayotte has moved from the No. 3
position up to the No. 2 spot, replacing Stanford's
other senior All-America Lloyd Bourne. Bourne,
who has yet to lose a team match in the NCAA's
moved down a notch to the No. 3 position and
finished season play with a 11-7 record.
Following the top three, Stanford coach Dick
Gould rounds out his lineup with sophomore Scott
Bondurant (14-4), freshman Dave Siegler (14-5),
and sophomore Jeff Arons (10-7). In the doubles,
Rennert and Bourne (7-5) play the top spot fol
lowed by Mayotte-Arons (8-5) and Siegler-
Bondurant (12-3).

The winner of the Stanford-Utah match w ill face
the winner of the Clemson-Princeton match on
Tuesday. If the Cards were to survive these first
two rounds, they would more than likely face either
UCLA or Peperdine in the semi-finals. Last year,
the Cards fell to UCLA in Athens 6-3 in the semi
finals. The two teams have split their home and
home series with each team taking 5-4 victories on
the opponent's home courts.
The bottom half of the draw will most likely pit
USC and California in the semi-final, although
both Trinity and Arkansas have a shot at an upset.
The first round match-ups in draw sheet order
are Stanford vs. Utah, Clemson (31-4) vs. Prince
ton (12-4), Pepperdine (19-5) vs. Georgia (22-4),
UCLA (20-4) vs. Miami (16-5), Cal (17-6) vs.
Houston (22-7), Tennessee (14-5) vs. Trinity
(17-4), Michigan (18-1) vs. Arkansas (3 1 -4), and
Wichita St. (16-6) vs. USC (19-5).
As evidenced by the high number of losses
among all the teams in the draw, the tournament
should be a wide open affair. "For the first time
that 1 can recall," commented Gould, "there are
seven teams with a real solid shot at winning it (the
NCAA's). The five California schools in particular
are very evenly matched."
With the finals of the team championships con
cluding on Thursday, the individual championships
will pick right up on Friday and run through Mon
day. The Cards placed their top five singles players
in the draw, paced by Rennert who should he fa
vored to take the crown. Last year, Rennert lost to
Fritz Beuhning of UCLA in the quarterfinals.
Stanford placed all three doubles teams in the
draw, the only team to do so. Rennert and Bourne
should have a shot at the doubles title despite their
7-5 record (three of those losses were to Cal's
Marty Davis and Chris Dunk) as the pair advanced
to the semi-finals last year.
Asked about the individual championships,
Gould rated his top two Rennert and Mayotte, as
among the top five. According to Gould, Mayotte
could very well be the dark horse in the draw.
