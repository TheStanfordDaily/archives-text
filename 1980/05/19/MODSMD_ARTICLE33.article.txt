# Laxmen down Cal to win NorCal's
## 
### Gray Maxwell Staff Writer 
A script could not have pro\ ided more drama as Stanford met Cal
at Berkeley on Saturday to battle for the NorCal Lacrosse Associa
tion collegiate title.
As it turned out. the Cardinals won the match in triple overtime,
12-11.
The game started at 10:45 a.m. A full three hours passed before
Card attackman Rick Valentine scored on a tast break at the end ot
the third overtime period to give Stanford the victory.
Middie John Way scored for Cal at 8:00 in the first period for the
first tally of the day. Stanford's Kirk Phelps scored a minute later to
tie the score. Cal then built a 3-1 lead but middie Kelly Williams
scored for Stanford unassisted with less than a minute remaining in
the quarter.
Williams assisted Valentine in the second period and alert playing
by attack Tom Drellesled to another goal as Stanford tied the score at
4-4. Playing in front of the crease. Drelles picked off an errant shot by
Valentine and dropped a shot past the Cal goalie. Cal led 6-4 before
middie Mason Day found Valentine alone in Iront ot the crease.
Valentine's goal cut Cal's margin to 6-5 at half.
The Cardinals came out firing in the third period. Valentine scored
three unassisted goals in the first six minutes of the quarter as Stan
ford jumped to an 8-6 lead. Penalties to Valentine and Day late in the
period hurt Stanford, though, as the Bears fought back to tie the score
and then take a 9-8 lead into the fourth quarter.
•A determined 'AMC Phelps took the fourth quarter face-off and
scored twelve seconds later to tie the game at nine all. Moments later.
Drelles was caught off-side for the first of six Stanford penalties that
were to keep the Cardinals a man down for nearly ten minutes.
Attack Paul Senior scored for Cal from the corner. Phelps again took
the face-off for the Cards and scored on an incredible behind the back
shot to tie the score at 10-10. Slashing penalties to defensemen Andy
Shea and Rich Ward gave Cal a two-man edge which the Bears took
advantage of as middie Mark McLaughlin scored Cal's final goal at
8:16 in the fourth period.
The Cards went into their man-up offense and patiently passed the
ball around the crease, waiting for an opening in the Cal defense.
Middie Day found a hole at 13:36. and bounced a shot past the Cal
goalie Mike Eisenstadt. The Cardinal defense then stopped two Cal
fast breaks in the last minute to force the game into sudden death
overtime.
A penalty to von Kugelgen. his second, gave Stanford a man
advantage. but neither team could score.
In the second overtime period, a slashing penalty to Phelps gave
the Bears a man-advantage, and the Cardinal man-down defense
came on the field for the thirteenth time in the game. The squad
mastefully prevented the Cal attackmen from getting an open shot on
goal, and the Bears were stifled once again.
The third overtime period was perhaps the most exciting as the two
teams took turns running fast breaks downfield and peppering the
goals. Middie Graham Winton came up with a loose ball near mid
field and saw Valentine streaking across the restraining line unco
vered. Valentine got the bail, drew Eisenstadt out of the goal with a
fake, and then dropped the ball past him as the ecstatic Cardinal
players rushed the field. It was Valentine's sixth goal of the game and
his 40th of the season. Phelps' hat trick raised his scoring total to 32
for the season.
The victory raised Stanford's record to 11-5 overall and 9-1 against
other colleges'. The team will seek to avenge that only loss when it
plays UCSB for the California Collegiate title on May 31.

by attack Tom Drellesled to another goal as Stanford tied the score at
4-4. Playing in front of the crease. Drelles picked off an errant shot by
Valentine and dropped a shot past the Cal goalie. Cal led 6-4 before
middie Mason Day found Valentine alone in Iront ot the crease.
Valentine's goal cut Cal's margin to 6-5 at half.
The Cardinals came out firing in the third period. Valentine scored
three unassisted goals in the first six minutes of the quarter as Stan
ford jumped to an 8-6 lead. Penalties to Valentine and Day late in the
period hurt Stanford, though, as the Bears fought back to tie the score
and then take a 9-8 lead into the fourth quarter.
•A determined 'AMC Phelps took the fourth quarter face-off and
scored twelve seconds later to tie the game at nine all. Moments later.
Drelles was caught off-side for the first of six Stanford penalties that
were to keep the Cardinals a man down for nearly ten minutes.
Attack Paul Senior scored for Cal from the corner. Phelps again took
the face-off for the Cards and scored on an incredible behind the back
shot to tie the score at 10-10. Slashing penalties to defensemen Andy
Shea and Rich Ward gave Cal a two-man edge which the Bears took
advantage of as middie Mark McLaughlin scored Cal's final goal at
8:16 in the fourth period.
The Cards went into their man-up offense and patiently passed the
ball around the crease, waiting for an opening in the Cal defense.
Middie Day found a hole at 13:36. and bounced a shot past the Cal
goalie Mike Eisenstadt. The Cardinal defense then stopped two Cal
fast breaks in the last minute to force the game into sudden death
overtime.
A penalty to von Kugelgen. his second, gave Stanford a man
advantage. but neither team could score.
In the second overtime period, a slashing penalty to Phelps gave
the Bears a man-advantage, and the Cardinal man-down defense
came on the field for the thirteenth time in the game. The squad
mastefully prevented the Cal attackmen from getting an open shot on
goal, and the Bears were stifled once again.
The third overtime period was perhaps the most exciting as the two
teams took turns running fast breaks downfield and peppering the
goals. Middie Graham Winton came up with a loose ball near mid
field and saw Valentine streaking across the restraining line unco
vered. Valentine got the bail, drew Eisenstadt out of the goal with a
fake, and then dropped the ball past him as the ecstatic Cardinal
players rushed the field. It was Valentine's sixth goal of the game and
his 40th of the season. Phelps' hat trick raised his scoring total to 32
for the season.
The victory raised Stanford's record to 11-5 overall and 9-1 against
other colleges'. The team will seek to avenge that only loss when it
plays UCSB for the California Collegiate title on May 31.
