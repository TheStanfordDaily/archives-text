Richmond's fastest
INDIANAPOLIS (AP) —
Youthful Tim Richmond gained
a measure of vindication yester
day, posting by far the fastest
speed among the early qualifiers
on the final day of time trials for
the Indianapolis 500.
The 24-year-old rookie driver
from Ashland. Ohio, drove his
rebuilt Penske-Cosworth racer
through the four-lap. 10-mile
qualifying run at an average of
188.334 mph.
Richmond, who owns the fas
test practice lap of the month at
the Indianapolis Motor Speed
way — 193.507 mph — crashed
during practice on May 10 prior
to the opening of the first
weekend of qualifying. The colli
sion with the wall broke the
driver's compartment of the car.
and Richmond's team had to
hurriedly make arrangements to
buy a new tub and retool the car.
The youngster turned a top

practice lap of 184.843 yester
day morning, but came back dur
ing the qualifying session to re
cord consecutive laps of
188.482, 188.917, 187.813, and
188.127.
Space yacht watching
PLYMOUTH. England (AP)
— Two space satellites will
monitor some 100 solo
yachtsmen due to compete in a
trans-Atlantic race from this
southwest port to Newport, R. 1.,
next month.
The move follows the death of
19 crew members in the 605-
mile Fastnet race last year when
yachts hit by freak waves
and gales. Fastnet was the con
cluding race of the Admiral's
Cup series.
Each yacht in the Royal
Western-Observer race starting
June 7 will carry a device sending
identification signals to two or
biting American Argos satellites,

which will transmit the signals to
a ground station at Toulouse, Fr
ance.
Commander Lloyd Foster,
secretary of the Royal Western
Yacht club, said Sunday the club
will get a computer printout six
times daily giving the yachts' pos
itions to within 800 yards and
weather conditions.
