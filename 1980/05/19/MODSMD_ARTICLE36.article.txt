# Daily nine defeats PJF's
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily softball
team continued itsdominationof
the Stanford Journalism Fellows'
aging squad Saturday, sweeping
a double-header, 16-4, 13-2.
A no-holes infield, combined
with superb pitching and a well
balanced offense made it clear to
the cheering crowd from the start
that the first game would be no
contest.
The Daily's offensive punch
was led by third-baseman James
Higa who hit safely in all but two
of his trips to the plate. Higa
added a towering home run to
left in the second inning of the
second game to shut the door on
any PJF hopes of a double
header split.
Outfielder Ivan Maisel fol

lowed Higa's shot with another
home-run, to add to the
whitewash.
Daily pitcher Bill Burger held
the graying PJF's to just six runs
in the two seven-inning games.
Burger's arm was put to the test
in the second game as an increas
ingly inebriated infield's errors
forced the right-hander to put
the vacationing journalists down
swinging.
As always, the game was not
without its lighter moments.
Daily Business Manager
Charles Monheim dazzled the
crowd with his pick-up-the
ball-put-down-the-beer play as
shortstop and ex-editor Sara
Lessley surprised the entire
world by putting in two innings in

the outfield, and interfering in
the action only once.
For the PJF's, the usually reli
able pitching Harry Press went
awry in the third inning when the
Dailyites scored 10 runs. Press
was given another try in the sec
ond game, but fared only slightly
better.
Press did manage, however, to
give the PJF squad something to
laugh about when he struck out
ex-editor Mike Charlson for the
second straight year. Charlson
admitted after the game that he
favored the institution of a de
signated hitter for first basemen.
