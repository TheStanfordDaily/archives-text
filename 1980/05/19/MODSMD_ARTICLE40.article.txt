St. Helens eruption spreads ash
VANCOUVER, Wash — Mount St. Helens blew
its top yesterday with a blast felt 200 miles away,
belching ash which blotted out the sun for more than
100 miles and killing at least five people. Mudflows
and floods destroyed bridges and forced evacuation
of about 2,000 people.
At least three people were missing.
The eruption at 8:39 a.m. PDTshot smoke and ash
nine miles into the sky and a spectacular lightning
storm in the rising plume started numerous forest
fires. There were no immediate reports of lava.
In Walla Walla, 160 miles to the east, drifting ash
made the sky so dark that automatic street lights went
on and by evening more than a foot of ash had ac
cumulated at Camp Baker, 15 miles west of the vol
cano. Ash was also reported falling in parts of Idaho,
more than 200 miles downwind.
The eruption was visible in Vancouver, Wash.,
more than 50 miles to the southwest, and the explo
sion was felt in Vancouver, 8.C.. more than 200 miles
to the north.
By yesterday evening, the once snow-covered
9,677-foot peak was reduced to about 9100 feet, said
U.S. Geological Survey spokesman Worner Gerhard.
The bodies of two people found at a Weyerhaeuser
logging camp near the mountain were flown to Kelso.
Wash., by an Air Force Reserve helicopter, said Air
Force Lt. D. E. Schroeder. They were killed by heat,
Schroeder said, but no more details were im
mediately available.
Three other persons also were killed, but the cir
cumstances of their deaths were not immediately av
ailable.
Miami violence prompts curfew
MIAMI — Sporadic sniper fire wounded three
Miami police officers here yesterday as continued
violence, burning and looting forced authorities to
order a dusk-to-dawn curfew, and 1100 National
Guard troops here in the wake of all-night racial
rioting that had killed 14 persons and injured at least
200 others.
Police said that they had arrested 300 persons —
including 178 blacks — by yesterday.
A police spokesman said that the officers — a
captain, a lieutenant and a sergeant — were in "fair
condition," and had been shot in the arms and legs
while routinely responding to calls in the city's riot
scarred sections.
The uprising began on Saturday night when
thousands of blacks angrily protested a not-guilty
verdict that cleared four white former Dade County
policemen who had been accused of the beating death
of Arthur McDuffie, 33, a black Miami insurance
executive, here last Dec. 17.
In a move to try to defuse the crisis, U.S. Attorney
Atlee Wampler said yesterday that he will ask a grand
jury here Wednesday to seek federal charges of civil
rights violations against the acquited former officers.
The Department of Justice also sent a team of
facial mediators from its Community Relations Ser
vice in attempt to heal the emotional scars from the
rioting.
Meanwhile, fires raged in the city's northwest sec
tion and downtown yesterday, darkening the skyline
with columns of smoke that resembled tornado-like
funnel clouds.
Florida Gov. Bob Grahame ordered 1100 national
guardsmen, 300 state highway patrolmen, four
helicopters and an armored personnel carrier into the
city to help local law enforcement officers quell dis
turbances.
"'I ask my fellow Dade Countians to do your part
to stop the violence and hatred between black and
white Floridians," Grahame said in a statement in
which he urged compliance with the 8 p.m.-to-6 a.m.
curfew.
Cuban accident survivors arrive
KEY WEST. Florida — The 38 survivors from a
capsized Cuban refugee vessel arrived here yester
day, bandaged from chemical gasoline burns and
weeping for their dead companions.
The capsizing of the 36-foot 010 Yumi, which
claimed the lives of 14 people Saturday, prompted
the commandant of the Coast Guard, Adm. John B.
Hayes, to decry "the continued lack of regard for
human life by Cuba."
Charging that Cuban officials are forcibly over
loading American boats leaving Mariel Harbor,
Hayes said the Cuban government is "courting disas
ter" and predicted that the situation "may soon result
in a marine tragedy involving hundreds of lives."
Coast Guard commander Samuel Dennis said ad
ministration officials are "discussing" the possibility

of transferring refugees from unsafe vessels onto U.S.
Navy carriers or Coast Guard ships just outside
Cuban waters. Such a measure would prevent over
loaded boats from making the dangerous 1 10-mile
crossing.
Reports from American captains in Mariel Satur
day indicated that Cuban authorities were continuing
to overload vessels but were preventing the boats
from leaving until the 20-knot winds sweeping the
straits subsided.
EEC to place sanctions on Iran
NAPLES, Italy — Foreign ministers of the Euro
pean Economic Community agreed yesterday to im
pose a wide range of economic sanctions against Iran
with the"sole objective" of speeding the liberation of
the American hostages.
The sanctions will affect industrial, service and
trade agreements reached with Iran after Nov. 4. the
date the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized by milit
ants. as well as a number of pending agreements.
Agreements worth billions of dollars in effect be
fore Nov. 4 will not be affected by the embargo.
Continued sales and services in the areas of food
and medicine will be the only exceptions, according
to Italian Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo, who
presided at the one-day meeting here.
At the same time, the ministers gave strong support
to the new initiative of U.S. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim regarding the hostages. His initiative in
cludes the return to Iran of Ayib Daoudy, represent
ing the special U.N. commission that was sent to
Tehran in March when its members were not permit
ted to visit the hostages.
Officials here said there is no accurate estimate of
the full economic impact of the sanctions against Iran.
The embargo will go into effect Thursday, retroactive
to Nov. 4 on all exchanges except food and medicine.
China succeeds in ICBM launch
PEKING — China extended its military reach yes
terday. test-firing an unarmed intercontinental ballis
tic missile 6250 miles into the South Pacific, and the
official Kinhua news agency said the test "achieved
complete success."
A missile with this range could carry a nuclear
warhead anywhere in the Soviet Union or to the West
Coast of the United States.
The test comes at a time when China is urging
preparedness to deal with any Soviet threat and urg
ing all "peace-loving" nations to unite against what it
calls Soviet expansionism.
China has not specified the launch site for the test,
but it was believed to have been in the northwest
Sinkiang Province. From there, the rocket would
have traveled about 2,000 miles over Chinese land
and 4,200 miles over the Pacific.
The Chinese had warned all foreign shipping and
aircraft out of a zone within a 70-nautical mile radius
roughly in the center of a ring formed by the Solomon
Islands, Tuvalu. Western Samoa, Fiji and the New
Hebrides, between May 12 and June 10.
Iran appoints Afghan delegates
ISLAMBADAD, Pakistan — In a major anti-
Soviet move, Iran yesterday admitted eight Afghan
rebel leaders to its delegation currently attending the
Islamic foreign ministers' conference.
While Iran has consistently condemned the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan, the seating of six representa
tives from Peshawar-based rebel groups plus two
from the Iranian city of Qom is viewed as a quantum
shift in policy away from the Soviet Union.
"It commits them irrevocable against the Russians
on the Afghan issue," a senior Pakistani delegate
said.
Iran's Foreign Minister Sadegh Ghotbzadeh said
the decision meant that Iran was fully committed to
the cause of the Afghan "mujahadeen" (freedom
fighters).
Timing of the decision to admit the rebels, shortly
after the Russians offered to make up any shortages
resulting from U.S. economic sanctions, is also consi
dered by observers to be significant.
There was speculation that Iran made the move as
part of a conference strategy to win support from the
more moderate of the 38 nations present for a tough
resolution condemning the United States for its
economic sanctions as well as for its abortive hostage
rescue attempt.
Egyptians present new proposal
CAIRO, Egypt — Egypt yesterday presented Is
rael with what were described as new detailed prop
osals aimed at getting stalled Palestinian autonomy

talks going again. Egypt suspended the talks May 8.
The semi-official newspaper, Al Ahram, said the
proposals were contained in a letter from Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat to Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin that included "detailed suggestions
Egypt wants Israel to go by to create the suitable
atmosphere for a resumption of the talks."
"These include suggestions on the status of
Jerusalem, the question of settlements in occupied
territory, and Israeli security," the newspaper said. It
said Egypt sent the same message to President Jimmy
Carter three days ago.
Details of the proposals were not known im
mediately. Al Ahram said the United States was ex
changing views with Egypt and Israel on phrasing of a
statement, to be released in Washington, that would
ask a resumption of negotiations in the light of
Sadat's messages to Begin and Carter.
Foreign Minister Kamal Hassan Aly held separate
meetings yesterday with American Ambassador
Alfred Atherton and Israeli Ambassador Eliahu Ben
Elissar and said afterwards it was "clear from the
positions of the three countries that there is a desire
to continue." He reportedly relayed Sadat's letter to
Begin through Ben Elissar.
Congress still debating budget
WASHINGTON — While some congressional
leaders suggest a balanced budget may already be a
lost cause. House and Senate negotiators will try this
week to finish writing one.
Wide differences still faced the conference com
mittee trying to reconcile the defense-laden Senate
version with a House-passed 1981 budget that makes
shallower cuts in social programs for the fiscal year
that begins Oct. I.
The conference was to meet again today after mis
sing its May 15 deadline for completion of the budget
measure. The panel will try to complete work on a
compromise bill — which must then be returned to
each chamber for final approval — before the five
day Memorial Day recess.
But rising unemployment and the striking of Presi
dent Jimmy Carter's $10.3 billion gasoline fee have
raised grave doubts about whether the budget can
actually be balanced.
At the time some members are bemoaning the
possible loss of revenues from Carter's gasoline fee,
legislation to make sure it isn't revived was gaining
momentum in Congress.
The Senate Finance Committee voted 14 to 4 last
week to kill the levy and a House Ways and Means
subcommittee took a similar vote — prompting Car
ter to suggest Congress lacked the courage to uphold
the politically unpopular plan.
Treasury Secretary G. William Miller was leading
an intensive administration lobbying effort seeking to
keep a showdown on the fee off the House or Senate
floors.
Despite the administration pressure, the full Ways
and Means Committee was expected to pass the
blocking legislation this Thursday and floor votes
seemed likely in both chambers in early June.
OSHA to enforce air regulations
ATLANTA — The federal government says a
quarter of the 600,000 workers in the nation's textile
mills suffer from brown lung disease, an irreversible
illness that dhokes the lungs with fluid, cutting off
oxygen and life.
The exact cause of the disabling disease, properly
known as byssinosis, has not been determined. But
health officials suspect cotton fibers maybe to blame.
A federal enforcement program targets cotton dust
in the air breathed by textile workers — aiming to all
but eliminate it by 1984, and curb brown lung, which
has engulfed the textile industry for more than 100
years.
The cotton dust program went into effect April 22
after an unsuccessful challenge by the textile industry
in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C. To meet
the requirements, air in the mills will have to be
filtered to reduce the amount of dust. Workers are
also to be given masks.
The Occupational Safety and Health Administra
tion, which enforced the air program, estimates
150,000 of the 600,000 textile workers in the United
States suffer from byssinosis. Of that number, about
35,000 people are disabled and will never work
again, OSHA says.
