# University won't pay workers for walkout time
## CIT compensation refused 
### Allison Stone Staff Writer 
University officials have refused to
pay workers at the Center for Informa
tion Technology here for the time they
spent off the job protesting alleged
building and safety problems, accord
ing to Associate University Counsel
Ross Campbell.
11l is decision conflicts with the state
Department of Industrial Relations
decision last month that required the
University to pay the employees.
The incident took place last June 26,
when five workers walked off the job at
the newly constructed Forsy th Building
to draw attention to what they called
poor working conditions.
After a hearing at the San Jose office
of the Division of Labor Standards En
forcement, the University was told to
pay the employees for the time that
they spent off the job during the walk
out and for the time that they spent
testifying at the subsequent trial.
Safety violations
According to Bob Britton, union
steward for the workers involved, there
were countless safety violations in the
unfinished facility.
"Air conditioners on the roof were
not working and the water coolers on
the floor were leaking water under the
floors where several electrical cables
were stored. Tiles were missing from
the floor, there were no toilets in the
building, no fire alarms and no sprink
ler system."
Campbell said that there was no find
ing of safety violations in the Labor
Commission hearing decision accord
ing to Cal-Occupational Safety and
Health Administration (OSHA) stan
dards.
No 'real hazard'
According to Campbell, the judg
ment bv the hearing officer said that
the conditions in the building were
"sufficient to cause employee con
cern," but that no "real and apparent
hazard" was found to justify the walk
out, from the University's point of
view.
"We cannot allow a worker to walk
off the job every time there is 'concern'
over safAy standards," Campbell said.
"Our feelings are that there are a vari
ety of options for employees to voice
their complaints such as Federal and
State law. These vehicles are required
to respond quickly to complaints, and
all fall short of an employee walking off
the job," Campbell said.
Britton said there were about a

dc n specific violations cited during
the course of the hearing, and that re
fusing to pay because a specific code
was not cited in the Labor Commission
hearings is only a ploy being used by
the University to "silence dissent" and
to prevent this kind of action from oc
curring again.
Loses, win
"Even it the University loses, tjiey
win." said Britton. "Now it will take a
couple of years to get the money in
court."
According to Campbell, the next
step is for the state legal council to re
view the decision and decide whether
to bring a case against the Univer
sity in California Superior Court. If the
state does bring a case against the Uni
versity. it could take from six months to

a year tor the decision to be handed
down. Following that, there are two
appealFmechanisms the University can
use so the whole process could take up
to two years, Campbell said.
Another issue which could arise is
the payment of regular wages to Uni
versity witnesses to testify, while the
workers were docked vacation time for
the time they spent at the hearings. The
Labor Commission ruled that the Uni
versity was also responsible for giving
this vy.cati.on time back to the
employees.
Bargaining agreement
The University says that in the Col
lective Bargaining Agreement with the
United Stanford Employees (USE), it
is stated that the University shall be
required to pay employees'tor the tinie
that they spend at court proceedings
only if they are subpoenaed to appear.
According to Campbell, none of the
workers was subpoenaed.
Britton said University witnesses
who were not subpoenaed appeared at
the hearings and were still paid. Britton
called this discrimination by the Uni
versity against the employees.
Both sides agree that the amount of
money involved in the dispute is not
significant. It amounts to about $400,
but Campbell said the case h.;s substan
tial significance in frying to define
when an individual ca,n walk oil the
job.

There is no California court deci
sion on what is a 'real and apparent
hazard." This is part ol the problem
with this case â€” there is no precedent,
Campbell said.
Campbell noted that a state Labor
Commission decision is only an opin
ion, and that there is no appeal process
available other than refusing to go
along with the decision.
"I guess it would sound better it we
said 'appeal' rather than 'refuse,' but
this is the only means we have to kick
the case up a level." Campbell said.
Britton said he feels that the Univer
sity is trying to stall the decision in
order to discourage further incidents
from taking place.
