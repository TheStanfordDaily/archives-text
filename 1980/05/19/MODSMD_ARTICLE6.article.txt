America's role in space exploration
was debated herÂ£ Saturday night by
five candidates running for the 12th
Congressional District seat in the
House of Representatives.
In a debate occasionally sparked by
political jabs at Republican incumbent
Pete McCJoskey, challengers Bill Evers
(Libertarian), Adele Fumino (Peace
and Freedom), Marc Strassman
(Democratic Party) and Royce Cole
(Republican) discussed some of their
platform positions.
In the debate sponsored by the San
Francisco chapter of the American As
tronautics Society, each candidate,
speaking in alphabetical order, addres
sed the audience of about 40 in Terman
Auditorium. Questions followed from
the audience and a panel of experts on
space exploration.
Republican challenger Cole said the
"crux of the whole problem" was pro-:
viding for both U.S. defense and social
needs while still supporting space exp
loration. If the United States does not
stabilize its economy, it may not have
the resources to provide for space exp

Libertarian candidate Evers said ex
tensive government investment in
space exploration is not desireable. Al

though the Libertarian Party is at
tracted Hv the "spirit of the frontier"
that space exploration offers, he said,
government investment brings gov
ernment control, premature develop
ment of technology and bureaucratic
incompetence.
Evers said he favors the develop
ment of space and other high
technologies by the private sector. He
cited the success small computer firms
have had in developing advanced com
puter systems as an example that pri
vate industry is capable of advancing
technology without government in
vestment.
MX attacked
Evers attacked the proposed MX
missile system, a strategic missile
launching plan that has received sup
port from incumbent McCloskey. The
system would have a destabilizing ef
fect on Soviet-American relations and
would not significantly improve the
American strategic defense posture, he
said. Since only a quarter of all U.S.
nuclear warheads are land-based, the
rationale of reducing their vulnerabil
ity from attack to increase overall sec
urity is not appropriate, Evers said.
Peace and Freedom candidate
Fumino said, "The great danger to
"scientists in this country is having
their aims perverted bv militarism and
