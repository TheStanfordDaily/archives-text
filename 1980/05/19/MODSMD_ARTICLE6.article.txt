# House candidates debate space issues
## 
### Mike Vaska Staff Writer 
America's role in space exploration
was debated her£ Saturday night by
five candidates running for the 12th
Congressional District seat in the
House of Representatives.
In a debate occasionally sparked by
political jabs at Republican incumbent
Pete McCJoskey, challengers Bill Evers
(Libertarian), Adele Fumino (Peace
and Freedom), Marc Strassman
(Democratic Party) and Royce Cole
(Republican) discussed some of their
platform positions.
In the debate sponsored by the San
Francisco chapter of the American As
tronautics Society, each candidate,
speaking in alphabetical order, addres
sed the audience of about 40 in Terman
Auditorium. Questions followed from
the audience and a panel of experts on
space exploration.
Republican challenger Cole said the
"crux of the whole problem" was pro-:
viding for both U.S. defense and social
needs while still supporting space exp
loration. If the United States does not
stabilize its economy, it may not have
the resources to provide for space exp
loration. he said.
Too much control
Libertarian candidate Evers said ex
tensive government investment in
space exploration is not desireable. Al

though the Libertarian Party is at
tracted Hv the "spirit of the frontier"
that space exploration offers, he said,
government investment brings gov
ernment control, premature develop
ment of technology and bureaucratic
incompetence.
Evers said he favors the develop
ment of space and other high
technologies by the private sector. He
cited the success small computer firms
have had in developing advanced com
puter systems as an example that pri
vate industry is capable of advancing
technology without government in
vestment.
MX attacked
Evers attacked the proposed MX
missile system, a strategic missile
launching plan that has received sup
port from incumbent McCloskey. The
system would have a destabilizing ef
fect on Soviet-American relations and
would not significantly improve the
American strategic defense posture, he
said. Since only a quarter of all U.S.
nuclear warheads are land-based, the
rationale of reducing their vulnerabil
ity from attack to increase overall sec
urity is not appropriate, Evers said.
Peace and Freedom candidate
Fumino said, "The great danger to
"scientists in this country is having
their aims perverted bv militarism and
being corrupted by elitism which pre
vents them from bringing science to the
people as they should "
Fumino said she favors space explo
ration but fears that it has been • per
verted" by competition with the
Soviets and its links to the military.
She proposed military budget cuts in
favor of increased social spending.
No draft
Fumino also said she opposes a draft
because in this age of high technology
warfare, foot soldiers are needed only
for the limited warfare waged by an
imperialistic power She called
McCloskey's universal service con
scription plan "unconsciously racist"
and said it would prov ide for "the sla\ e
labor" of the nation's youth.
Incumbcnt McCloskey, who has held
the 12th Congressional District seat for
12 years, said t,he space program will
not be a major issue in the 1 'SO cam
paign. He said, "the big issue will be
whether public confidence in govern
ment can be restored throus'.h balanc
ing the budget and proper!) allocating
resources in the trimmed budget."
He added that the government
Should spend mo\iey > to promote basic
research, including space explication,
because private industry will -\ot.
No call
McCloskey said lie is not willing to
call for increased expenditures in the
space program although he said expen
ditures should continue at existing,
proportion to total government spend
ing. He said even research and de
velopment programs should not be
exempt from cuts since waste occurs
there also.
McCloskey also told the audi nee he
voted for the continuation ot the
MX-missile program.
Democratic candidate Strassman
said he favored a reinvigorated space
program because it will provide man
with a useful outlet for the war instincl>
so prevalent in the past. He proposed
the establishment of orbiting space
cities, bases on the moon, colonics on
Mars, the establishment of recreational
ski resorts on Titan — one ot Saturn's

moons — and the eventual construc
tion ol starships for people who want to
leave the galaxy.
Unity
The space program would unite
America and the world in a project that
is more important than nationalism and
would facilitate the evolution of man
kind. Strassman said.
Democratic candidate Kirsten Olsen
did not attend the debate.
In a prepared statement read by
moderator Bill Copeland, Olsen called
for the development of solar energy
platforms in space and a treaty to ban
the use of space for defense purposes.
In answer to a panelist's question on
the law of the sea negotiations,
McCloskey said that a soon-to-be in
troduced bill to Congress could receive
a "volatile reaction" from Third World
nations. The bill would allow firms with
the technology to develop ocean re
sources to do so if no law of the sea
treaty is signed by I^SH.
Ihe law of the sea negotiations along
with the proposed U.N. moon treaty,
are related to the "common heritage"
idea which would place some Un
affiliated or international authority in
charge of natural resources of the
moon and the sea.
McCloskey called the proposal a
"calculated risk" because Third World
countries may be so incensed by the bill
which would not allow them the
same share in the ocean resources as
the treaty would — that they could
walk out of the international confer
ence in August.
McCloskey said four American
companies have heavily invested in un
dersea mining technology and stand to
lose that investment if they cannot
move ahead quickly with full-scale de
velopment.
Candidate Evers opposed both the
"common heritage" treaty proposals
because he said the international con
trol would largely preclude the com
mercial success of ocean and space de
velopment. McCloskey argued that
w itliout a law of the seas accord. Third
World countries could interfere with
any development of the ocean re
sources.

government investment brings gov
ernment control, premature develop
ment of technology and bureaucratic
incompetence.
Evers said he favors the develop
ment of space and other high
technologies by the private sector. He
cited the success small computer firms
have had in developing advanced com
puter systems as an example that pri
vate industry is capable of advancing
technology without government in
vestment.
MX attacked
Evers attacked the proposed MX
missile system, a strategic missile
launching plan that has received sup
port from incumbent McCloskey. The
system would have a destabilizing ef
fect on Soviet-American relations and
would not significantly improve the
American strategic defense posture, he
said. Since only a quarter of all U.S.
nuclear warheads are land-based, the
rationale of reducing their vulnerabil
ity from attack to increase overall sec
urity is not appropriate, Evers said.
Peace and Freedom candidate
Fumino said, "The great danger to
"scientists in this country is having
their aims perverted bv militarism and
being corrupted by elitism which pre
vents them from bringing science to the
people as they should "
Fumino said she favors space explo
ration but fears that it has been • per
verted" by competition with the
Soviets and its links to the military.
She proposed military budget cuts in
favor of increased social spending.
No draft
Fumino also said she opposes a draft
because in this age of high technology
warfare, foot soldiers are needed only
for the limited warfare waged by an
imperialistic power She called
McCloskey's universal service con
scription plan "unconsciously racist"
and said it would prov ide for "the sla\ e
labor" of the nation's youth.
Incumbcnt McCloskey, who has held
the 12th Congressional District seat for
12 years, said t,he space program will
not be a major issue in the 1 'SO cam
paign. He said, "the big issue will be
whether public confidence in govern
ment can be restored throus'.h balanc
ing the budget and proper!) allocating
resources in the trimmed budget."
He added that the government
Should spend mo\iey > to promote basic
research, including space explication,
because private industry will -\ot.
No call
McCloskey said lie is not willing to
call for increased expenditures in the
space program although he said expen
ditures should continue at existing,
proportion to total government spend
ing. He said even research and de
velopment programs should not be
exempt from cuts since waste occurs
there also.
McCloskey also told the audi nee he
voted for the continuation ot the
MX-missile program.
Democratic candidate Strassman
said he favored a reinvigorated space
program because it will provide man
with a useful outlet for the war instincl>
so prevalent in the past. He proposed
the establishment of orbiting space
cities, bases on the moon, colonics on
Mars, the establishment of recreational
ski resorts on Titan — one ot Saturn's

moons — and the eventual construc
tion ol starships for people who want to
leave the galaxy.
Unity
The space program would unite
America and the world in a project that
is more important than nationalism and
would facilitate the evolution of man
kind. Strassman said.
Democratic candidate Kirsten Olsen
did not attend the debate.
In a prepared statement read by
moderator Bill Copeland, Olsen called
for the development of solar energy
platforms in space and a treaty to ban
the use of space for defense purposes.
In answer to a panelist's question on
the law of the sea negotiations,
McCloskey said that a soon-to-be in
troduced bill to Congress could receive
a "volatile reaction" from Third World
nations. The bill would allow firms with
the technology to develop ocean re
sources to do so if no law of the sea
treaty is signed by I^SH.
Ihe law of the sea negotiations along
with the proposed U.N. moon treaty,
are related to the "common heritage"
idea which would place some Un
affiliated or international authority in
charge of natural resources of the
moon and the sea.
McCloskey called the proposal a
"calculated risk" because Third World
countries may be so incensed by the bill
which would not allow them the
same share in the ocean resources as
the treaty would — that they could
walk out of the international confer
ence in August.
McCloskey said four American
companies have heavily invested in un
dersea mining technology and stand to
lose that investment if they cannot
move ahead quickly with full-scale de
velopment.
Candidate Evers opposed both the
"common heritage" treaty proposals
because he said the international con
trol would largely preclude the com
mercial success of ocean and space de
velopment. McCloskey argued that
w itliout a law of the seas accord. Third
World countries could interfere with
any development of the ocean re
sources.
America's role in space exploration
was debated her£ Saturday night by
five candidates running for the 12th
Congressional District seat in the
House of Representatives.
In a debate occasionally sparked by
political jabs at Republican incumbent
Pete McCJoskey, challengers Bill Evers
(Libertarian), Adele Fumino (Peace
and Freedom), Marc Strassman
(Democratic Party) and Royce Cole
(Republican) discussed some of their
platform positions.
In the debate sponsored by the San
Francisco chapter of the American As
tronautics Society, each candidate,
speaking in alphabetical order, addres
sed the audience of about 40 in Terman
Auditorium. Questions followed from
the audience and a panel of experts on
space exploration.
Republican challenger Cole said the
"crux of the whole problem" was pro-:
viding for both U.S. defense and social
needs while still supporting space exp
loration. If the United States does not
stabilize its economy, it may not have
the resources to provide for space exp
loration. he said.
Too much control
Libertarian candidate Evers said ex
tensive government investment in
space exploration is not desireable. Al

though the Libertarian Party is at
tracted Hv the "spirit of the frontier"
