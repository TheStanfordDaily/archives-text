# New financial manager to assume post
## 
### Pamela Johnson Staff Writer 
After a four-month training session, junior Steve
Davis will become ASSU Financial Manager on June
15.
Davis, a 22-year-old industrial engineering major,
will replace senior Bruce Bendix in the post.
"Lately we've had to concentrate our efforts on
primarily three problems . . . the Coffee House, in
stallation of a new computer banking system and
working with Special Events," Bendix said.
Responsibilities
The financial manager's major responsibilities in
clude handling approximately 600 student organiza
tion banking accounts, overseeing the 12 ASSU pro
jects and working with the managers of those pro
jects.
ASSU projects such as the Sunday Flicks and the
refrigerator rentals fund themselves while the bank
ing service demands two-thirds of the ASSU's total
operating budget.

The banking service offers student organizations a
place to bank with checking, savings and $ 1000 club
accounts. The $1000 club was added this year and
allows groups with $ 1000 or more an opportunity to
earn interest at a faster rate than the standard one.
Continuity
Davis said he is generally satisfied with the present
ASSU structure, but he hopes to improve upon the
already-existing continuity.
"One thing we're doing to improve continuity is to
hire project managers in winter so they can work and
learn from the old ones. We're also preparing operat
ing manuals so that procedures aren't forgotten from
year to year."
Beyond continuity, his attention is divided among
existing projects and a desire for new ones.
"I want to look to new projects, like the addition of
new printing facilities and a banker's handbook,"
said Davis.
The handbook's purpose is to make the, system
more comprehensible to the organizations that bank

with ASSU. The book already exists hut, "it needs to
he made clearer and have some of the bugs worked
out," Davis said.
Project managers
A more pressing task for Davis, however, will en
compass working with project managers.
"My role with project managers is to give them
direction and to help provide a better service,
whether that be new ideas, working out problems
with the University or facilitating relations with the
University and off-campus vendors."
Davis said money matters are not only the respon
sibility of the financial manager but extend into the
senate's jurisdiction.
Student groups in immediate need of funding can
seek aid from the senate's discretionary fund. Others
may apply for a fee assessment through the ASSU
Senate, which then can review the application and
decide whether to place it on the ballot for a student
vote.
I make sure funds get spent correctly and don't
get lost in the transaction," Davis said.
