## Two West Bank families moved to refugee camps 
### William Claiborne The Washington Post 
JERUSALEM — Israeli security forces sea
led up the homes of two West Bank families and
forcibly moved them and their possessions to
abandoned refugee camps near Jericho after
youths in the family were implicated in attacks
on army vehicles, the occupation military gov
ernment confirmed yesterday.
It is the first time Israeli authorities have used
the derelict refugee camps — left over from the
1948 flood of Arab refugees to the West Bank
— as a place of collective banishment of families
with members implicated in active resistance to
the occupation.
The families were placed in crumbling mud
brick houses in the derelict camps and ordered
to submit their identity cards to authorities in
order to have their addresses changed. They
were warned not to leave the camps without the
permission of the military government.
Hunger strike
The families began a hunger strike yesterday
to protest that their new homes have no electric
ity or water and are "fit only for scorpions."
An official of the West Bank military gov
ernment said, "Perhaps there is no electricity,
but this also is part of the punishment. This is to
warn West Bank parents that they are responsi
ble for their children. It is to warn these people
we are not going to sit quiet while we are at
tacked."
Military authorities were holding one son
from each family on suspicion of throwing
stones or gasoline-filled bottles at Israeli army
vehicles near Bethlehem and Nablus, in the
West Bank.
One of the youths, Tarik Yaakub Shumali,
17, was hospitalized for injuries his parents said
he sustained while being beaten by army troops
after throwing rocks at a truck. His lawyer,
Felicia Langer. produced a medical report say
ing Shumali had sustained multiple injuries, in
cluding a "traumatic rupture of the urethra."
Curfew declared
Military authorities said Shumali was injured
when he fell from his bicycle into a ravine after
stoning the truck.
After the stone incident on Tuesday. Israeli
border police appeared at the Shumali family
home in Beir Sahur, near Bethlehem. They cut
the telephone lines and declared a curfew in the
immediate neighborhood, according to a
cousin. Bazal Shumali. He said security forces
welded the doors of rhe home and loaded all of

the family's furniture and belongings into a
truck.
A sister of Tarik Shumali was dismissed from
her teaching job and the family was transported
to Ein Sultan, a 1948 refugee camp just north of
Jericho that was abandoned in 1967.
Originally built by the United Nations" Relief
and Works Agency (UNRWA) for 20,000
Arab refugees who fled from that part of Pales
tine that was partitioned for the nascent state of
Israel. Ein Sultam is now inhabited by only
about 600 families of squatters.
UNRWA makes no attempt to maintain the
crudely built mudhuts. many of whose roofs
have collapsed. The derelict houses have no
electricity or water, although UNRWA trucks
in water for communal use by the tew families
living there.
Ghost town
The camp has the appearance of a ghost town,
with some of the houses used as goat pens by
neighboring farmers.
Langer said today, "I can only say that if this
type of thing continues, we shall face a new era
in the West Bank ... 1 feel all people of consci
ence will reject this step by the Israelis."
Georges Gallipeau. UNRWA West Bank di
rector. said he had reported the forced transfer
to his headquarters in Vienna, but he said, "at
this stage. 1 would rather not comment on the
decision to move the families there."
The second family was moved from its home
in the'Balata refugee camp, near Nablus. after a
son. Ahmed Kohammed Kaabi, 27. was ar
rested on a charge of throwing a Molotov
cocktail at a passing army vehicle earlier this
month. The rear seat of the army vehicle caught
fire, and a soldier was hospitalized with hand
and face burns. Kaabi was also accused of
throwing rocks at the car of the Nablus military
governor.
Refugee camp
The Kaabi family and its furniture were
trucked to the Okbat Jabar refugee camp south
of Jericho, which was also abandoned in 1967
but which now has about 2000 people lis ing in
the derelict houses. The camp has a school op
erated by UNRWA. but it is not equipped with
utilities.
While no military authorities would comment
on the record, an army source who described
himself as "authorized to comment for
background" said the banishment of the two
families was intended to serve warning to Pales
tinians about attacking army vehicles on West
Bank roads.
