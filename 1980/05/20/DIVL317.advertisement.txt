A bunch of band members, while on a trip to
some redneck state, were testing the local st
rains of homegrown when a loud knock was
heard at the door Open up, you hippies, it's
the police!' "Oh wow, said the band, stunned
as always. Luckily a clever trombone player
had his wits about him and hid the stash in a
nearby cuckoo clock The cops, being redneck
bastards, broke down the door, ransacked the
room and inspected their instruments. After a
long search, they turned to leave, convinced
that there were no illegal drugs to be found
"We'll get you next time. California hippies
Just at that moment the hour struck, and the
cuckoo staggered out, saying Hey man, any
body got the time?'

A bunch of band members, while on a trip to
some redneck state, were testing the local st
rains of homegrown when a loud knock was
heard at the door Open up, you hippies, it's
the police!' "Oh wow, said the band, stunned
as always. Luckily a clever trombone player
had his wits about him and hid the stash in a
nearby cuckoo clock The cops, being redneck
bastards, broke down the door, ransacked the
room and inspected their instruments. After a
long search, they turned to leave, convinced
that there were no illegal drugs to be found
"We'll get you next time. California hippies
Just at that moment the hour struck, and the
cuckoo staggered out, saying Hey man, any
body got the time?'
