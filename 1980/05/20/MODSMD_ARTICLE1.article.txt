## 
### Matt Bokor The Associated Press 
MIAMI' — President Jimmy Carter sent the
nation's chief law enforcement officer to riot
ravijged Miami yesterday and black leade/s
converged on the city hoping to restore calrrfc
after at least 15 people died in two nights of
racial rage. The governor ordered in more Na
tional Guardsmen, bringing the total to 3500.
Officials extended until further notice a
dusk-to-dawn curfew that they said had re
duced violence overnight in the city, site of the
nation's worst racial rioting in terms of
fatalities since Newark and Detroit exploded in
1967's"long hot summer."
Civiletti
Carter sent U.S. Attorney General Benja
min Civiletti to Miami, telling him to help re
store the peace and "see that justice is done,"
White House press secretary Jody Powell said
in Washington.
More than 370 people have been injured and
nearly 500 ;yrested in the strife triggered by

acquittal in Tampa on Saturday of four white
ex-policemen in the beating death of a black
Miami man.
Several fires were reported after the curlew
lapsed at 6 a.m. yesterday, and looting and
bottle throwing persisted, but police said phys
ical violence declined. Heavily armed
guardsmen and state and local officers roamed
the city's trouble spots.
- Dade Sheriff Bobby Jones said he was
"slightly optimistic that the worst of the vio
lence is over," adding, "We're not out of the
woods yet ... I think any situation or incident
could ignite the thing again."
Peace rally
About 500 blacks gathered peacefully in the
riot-torn L.iberty City district at noon for a
meeting billed as a peace rally, but most drifted
away before former U.N. Ambassador An
drew Young arrived.
Young told reporters a string of events
blacks viewed as racist was to blame for the
riot. "I think the accumulated frustration is the

cause for the rioting," he said.
Other national black leaders hurried to
Miami, invited by Mayor Maurice lerre to try
to calm the rage of lootings, burnings and
shootings. Eight blacks ajid six whites were
killed in the disturbances, and a policeman died
of a heart attack.
Among those due in Miami were the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, a powerful orator who heads
"Operation PUSH" in Chicago, and Benjamin
Hooks, executive director of the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Colored
People.
Gov. Bob Graham dispatched 2500 more
National Guard troops, tripling the force of
1000 guardsmen on hand. About 300 highway
patrolmen and fish and game officers'were also
pressed into service.
Grand jury
The U.S. attorney in Miami said a federal
grand jury would begin hearing evidence to
morrow concerning possible civil rights charges
against the four ex-policemen acquitted on

state charges in the death of insurance execu
tive Arthur McDuffie.
In Tallahassee, lawmakers bowed their
heads for a moment of silence called for by one
of the House's four black representatives.
"The officials are doing everything," said
Rep. Joe Lang Kershaw, a Democrat whose
district includes part of the troubled area. "We
need some help. We need some divine gui
dance."
The Miami violence began last Saturday
after an all-white jury acquitted the four offic
ers in Tampa on charges stemming from the
late December death of McDuffie, 33.
McDuffie was chased through Miami by
police for a traffic violation, and the state al
leged the officers then beat him to death, trying
later to make it appear he was fatally injured in
a motorcycle crash. He died in a comafourdays
after the incident. The defense said officers
used only the force needed to restrain McDuf
fie as the karate expert fought and kicked.
Circuit Judge Lenore Nesbitt ordered the

officers' trial moved to Tampa, terming the
case a "time bomb" in Miami.
Jurors guarded
Three jurors said Sunday police were watch
ing their Tampa homes, and one said his life
had been threatened. One juror said the state
"blew" the McDuffie case.
Bob Gilder, a Tampa black leader and ad
viser to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, cal
led on blacks to refrain from mass meetings
there. "The people arc madder than hell, but 1
think we in Tampa have learned that there are
other ways of utilizing our energies," he said.
"We'll let the Justice Department handle it.
Hopefully justice will prevail somewhere."
Other causes of the riots, many civil rights
leaders and officials in South Florida say, are
hard economic times, an influx of refugees that
has strained the economy of this area and also
caused blacks to feel they have to compete for
existing jobs, a chronic housing shortage, and
long-term strained relationships between the
varying ethnic groups here.

Miami, invited by Mayor Maurice lerre to try
to calm the rage of lootings, burnings and
shootings. Eight blacks ajid six whites were
killed in the disturbances, and a policeman died
of a heart attack.
Among those due in Miami were the Rev.
Jesse Jackson, a powerful orator who heads
"Operation PUSH" in Chicago, and Benjamin
Hooks, executive director of the National As
sociation for the Advancement of Colored
People.
Gov. Bob Graham dispatched 2500 more
National Guard troops, tripling the force of
1000 guardsmen on hand. About 300 highway
patrolmen and fish and game officers'were also
pressed into service.
Grand jury
The U.S. attorney in Miami said a federal
grand jury would begin hearing evidence to
morrow concerning possible civil rights charges
against the four ex-policemen acquitted on

state charges in the death of insurance execu
tive Arthur McDuffie.
In Tallahassee, lawmakers bowed their
heads for a moment of silence called for by one
of the House's four black representatives.
"The officials are doing everything," said
Rep. Joe Lang Kershaw, a Democrat whose
district includes part of the troubled area. "We
need some help. We need some divine gui
dance."
The Miami violence began last Saturday
after an all-white jury acquitted the four offic
ers in Tampa on charges stemming from the
late December death of McDuffie, 33.
McDuffie was chased through Miami by
police for a traffic violation, and the state al
leged the officers then beat him to death, trying
later to make it appear he was fatally injured in
a motorcycle crash. He died in a comafourdays
after the incident. The defense said officers
used only the force needed to restrain McDuf
fie as the karate expert fought and kicked.
Circuit Judge Lenore Nesbitt ordered the

officers' trial moved to Tampa, terming the
case a "time bomb" in Miami.
Jurors guarded
Three jurors said Sunday police were watch
ing their Tampa homes, and one said his life
had been threatened. One juror said the state
"blew" the McDuffie case.
Bob Gilder, a Tampa black leader and ad
viser to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, cal
led on blacks to refrain from mass meetings
there. "The people arc madder than hell, but 1
think we in Tampa have learned that there are
other ways of utilizing our energies," he said.
"We'll let the Justice Department handle it.
Hopefully justice will prevail somewhere."
Other causes of the riots, many civil rights
leaders and officials in South Florida say, are
hard economic times, an influx of refugees that
has strained the economy of this area and also
caused blacks to feel they have to compete for
existing jobs, a chronic housing shortage, and
long-term strained relationships between the
varying ethnic groups here.

cause for the rioting," he said.
