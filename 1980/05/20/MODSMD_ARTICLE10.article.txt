# Production resumes in Cambodia

### John Burgess The Washington Post 
PHNOM PENH — The elec
tric looms come to life mornings
at 7:30 at Russey Keo textile fac
tory. Their operators, mostly
women, keep the 200 old
machines clattering until 11:30,
then in the afternoon start them
up for another four-hour shift. If
things go well. Russey Keo will
turn out about 2000 yards of cot
ton cloth during the day.
But things often go wrong.
Power failures silence the entire
factory. Wheels and levers in
looms installed in the 1950s and
1960s give out. Repairmen,
spend hours trying to improvise
replacement parts that will get
the ancient machines operating
again.
Despite it all, Russey Keo
functions. The newly woven
cloth goes on to be steamed,
dyed and printed with bright
batik patterns. Sold in state
owned stores, it reduces by a
fraction the black market trade
with Thailand, the largest source
of clothing for Cambodia.
Sixteen months after it took
control of Phnom Penh, the
Heng Samrin government claims
to have reopened 63 of the city's
more than 100 factories. Produc
tion is still tiny, but it could play

an important role in reconstruc
tion. Already Cambodia plants
are producing fishnets, watering
cans for farmers, and bicycles,
for instance.
Luxuries
At some factories the focus is
on luxury goods. Government
planners apparently thought
Cambodians deserv ed a taste of
the old life and would be reas
sured that normal times lie
ahead. Thus, soft drink and
cigarette plants were among the
first to reopen.
In the 1960s and early 19705,
private investors built a series of
small but often very modern fac
tories in Phnom Penh.
Production stopped when the
Khmer Rouge captured and
emptied the city in 1975. Sol
diers sealed the factories' doors
and made amateur attempts to
cover machinery to prevent rust
ing. During the next<four years,
about 65 of the city's more, than
100 factories were restarted, one
by one, by the Khmer Rouge.
In January 1979, with Viet
namese forces closing in on the
city, the Khmer Rouge turned on
the machines they had repaired,
destroying as many as possible
before fleeing. Russey Keo was
among the few textile plants to

escape major damage.
Heng Samrin officials in
spected it early in 1979. Its pre
war technical director, Tiv Chhiv
Ky, 46, who had survived the
Khmer Rouge years, now re
turned to claim his old job. So
did many machine operators —
about half of its 550 workers
were employed there before
1975.
Working virtually without
spare parts, tools or technical
manuals, Kv began recondition
ing the old machines.
Western diplomatic attempts
to isolate the regime in Phnom
Penh further complicated the
task. Most of Russey Keo's
equipment was produced in Ja
pan. but because the two gov
ernments do not maintain ties,
the factory cannot contact the
manufacturers for parts and
technical advice.
Production starts
In the marketplaces the Heng
Samrin government has allowed

private enterprise to flourish.
Not so in industry. There, princi
ples of socialism are strictly
applied. Russey Keo. like other
plants, is operated by the Minis
try of Industry and markets its
products through stores run by
the Ministry of Commerce.
Nine of its workers have com
pleted two-month political edu
cation courses run by state labor
unions. Back on the job. they are
charged with raising their cow
orkers' political consciousness.
Every Saturday the entire staff,
both management and workers,
gathers in the factory's parking
lot to discuss ways production
can be improved.
Technical manager Ky attacks
this question every day. Even
when presenting samples of the
factory's cloth to visitors, he is
critical of his own work. "The
quality is not so good," he says,
running his fingers across a batik.
"We can't yet compare with the
Thai cloth."

In January 1979, with Viet
namese forces closing in on the
city, the Khmer Rouge turned on
the machines they had repaired,
destroying as many as possible
before fleeing. Russey Keo was
among the few textile plants to

escape major damage.
Heng Samrin officials in
spected it early in 1979. Its pre
war technical director, Tiv Chhiv
Ky, 46, who had survived the
Khmer Rouge years, now re
turned to claim his old job. So
did many machine operators —
about half of its 550 workers
were employed there before
1975.
Working virtually without
spare parts, tools or technical
manuals, Kv began recondition
ing the old machines.
Western diplomatic attempts
to isolate the regime in Phnom
Penh further complicated the
task. Most of Russey Keo's
equipment was produced in Ja
pan. but because the two gov
ernments do not maintain ties,
the factory cannot contact the
manufacturers for parts and
technical advice.
Production starts
In the marketplaces the Heng
Samrin government has allowed

private enterprise to flourish.
Not so in industry. There, princi
ples of socialism are strictly
applied. Russey Keo. like other
plants, is operated by the Minis
try of Industry and markets its
products through stores run by
the Ministry of Commerce.
Nine of its workers have com
pleted two-month political edu
cation courses run by state labor
unions. Back on the job. they are
charged with raising their cow
orkers' political consciousness.
Every Saturday the entire staff,
both management and workers,
gathers in the factory's parking
lot to discuss ways production
can be improved.
Technical manager Ky attacks
this question every day. Even
when presenting samples of the
factory's cloth to visitors, he is
critical of his own work. "The
quality is not so good," he says,
running his fingers across a batik.
"We can't yet compare with the
Thai cloth."
PHNOM PENH — The elec
tric looms come to life mornings
at 7:30 at Russey Keo textile fac
tory. Their operators, mostly
women, keep the 200 old
machines clattering until 11:30,
then in the afternoon start them
up for another four-hour shift. If
things go well. Russey Keo will
turn out about 2000 yards of cot
ton cloth during the day.
But things often go wrong.
Power failures silence the entire
factory. Wheels and levers in
looms installed in the 1950s and
1960s give out. Repairmen,
spend hours trying to improvise
replacement parts that will get
the ancient machines operating
again.
Despite it all, Russey Keo
functions. The newly woven
cloth goes on to be steamed,
dyed and printed with bright
batik patterns. Sold in state
owned stores, it reduces by a
fraction the black market trade
with Thailand, the largest source
of clothing for Cambodia.
Sixteen months after it took
control of Phnom Penh, the
Heng Samrin government claims
to have reopened 63 of the city's
more than 100 factories. Produc
tion is still tiny, but it could play

an important role in reconstruc
tion. Already Cambodia plants
are producing fishnets, watering
cans for farmers, and bicycles,
for instance.
Luxuries
At some factories the focus is
on luxury goods. Government
planners apparently thought
Cambodians deserv ed a taste of
the old life and would be reas
sured that normal times lie
ahead. Thus, soft drink and
cigarette plants were among the
first to reopen.
In the 1960s and early 19705,
private investors built a series of
small but often very modern fac
tories in Phnom Penh.
Production stopped when the
Khmer Rouge captured and
emptied the city in 1975. Sol
diers sealed the factories' doors
and made amateur attempts to
cover machinery to prevent rust
ing. During the next<four years,
about 65 of the city's more, than
100 factories were restarted, one
by one, by the Khmer Rouge.
