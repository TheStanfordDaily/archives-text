With Lord Killanin's latest at
tempt at shuttle diplomacy at an
end, the beleaguered Moscow
Olympics pickcd up five more
entries yesterday despite new
support for the boycott.
Killanin reviewed his latest ef
fort to salvage the Games — a
meeting late last week with Pres
ident Jimmy Carter — in an in
terview with the Associated
Press. The president of the In
ternational Olympic Committee
said Carter "was very helpful
• and constructive" but made it
clear that there was no chance
that Carter would change his
mind about the boycott of the

Summer Olympics.
But Killanin gained support
yesterday when his native Ire
land decided that it would defy
its government's wishes and send
a team to Moscow.
Other national Olympic com
mittees which have announced
plans to enter the Games are
those of the Netherlands, Bel
gium, Sweden and Austria.
The Italian government yes
terday announced that it sup
ported the boycott. So far, about
45 countries have said, for one
reason or another, that they will
not be participating in the
Games.
