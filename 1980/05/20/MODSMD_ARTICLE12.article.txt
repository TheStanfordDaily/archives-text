# Soviet troops hard-pressed in Afghanistan
## 
### Tyler Marshall The Los Angeles Times 
PENSHAWAR. Pakistan — The Af
ghan government, with Soviet help, today
controls less of the countryside than the
Afghan Army alone did before the mas
sive Soviet invasion last December, ac
cording with political and military
analysts here and accounts of those re
cently arrived from Afghanistan.
The Soviets are hard-pressed to
achieve even their minimum objectives of
maintaining peace in the major cities and
keeping key road links open, these
sources report.
Traffic along the main highway linking
Kabul with Jalalabad and the Khyber
Pass, for example, is reportedly subject to
more frequent and more intense rebel at
tack than at any time since the insurgency
took root 18 months ago.
For vehicles in armed convoys, some
times including helicopter gunship air
cover, the Kabul-to-Jalalabad run -a trip
that was a three-hour ride a year ago — is
now a nightmarish ordeal of up to 12
hours.
One senior Afghan government official
who recently fled the country said officials

of the Marxist regime now rarely venture
outside Kabul because they fear it is un
safe.
Army halved
Military observers in Pakistan estimate
that the Afghan army, once 80,000
strong, now 1 has fewer than 40,000 men
still in uniform.
Large-scale desertion is the major
drain on manpower, these sources say.
More significantly, these sources note,
the quality of those deserting today is
noticeably higher than in the past. "The
Soviet involvement has weakened the re
solve of the military to resist, one analyst
said. "Many of the best remaining people
are going."
Stunned and demoralized by the feroc
ity of the initial Russian offensive up the
Kunar Valley more than two months ago,
rebel insurgents appear to have success
fully adjusted their tactics to blunt the
effectiveness of superior Soviet
firepower.
Hit and run
Shifting almost exclusively to hit-and
run night attacks against Soviet units, the
rebels have become much more effective,
military sources say. They are also learn

ing the vulnerable points of sophisticated
Soviet hardware such as the MI-24
helicopter gunships.
A leader of the Jamiat Islami rebel
group gavfe a detailed description of how
one of his units brought down a Russian
helicopter gunshipin Ghazni province re
cently by faring down on it from a hill as it
hovered over a village below.
Although Soviet ground forces have
consistently been able to penetrate rebel
strongholds, their strategy of massive
superiority means that they have been
unable to mount more than one sustained
operation at a time in eastern Afghanis
tan.
"They take 50 tanks to attack even the
smallest village," one rebel source said.
Soviets withdraw
Before launching a large-scale offen
sive in Ghazni province earlier this
mpnth, the Soviets withdrew the bulk of
their forces from the Kumar Valley, re
taining control of only a few key military
garrisons at the northern end of the val
ley.
With neither the Afghan army nor the
central government functioning outside
the major cities, there is no one to whom

the Russians can turn over control of
pacified areas.
Observers believe that a recent gather
ing ot Afghans in Peshawar may prove to
be a greater unifying force than the rebel
groups, which increasingly squabble
among themselves.
Constitution
The meeting adopted a temporary con
stitution, elected 68* members to a na
tional revolutionary council and extended
an invitation to each of the six major rebel
groups to select their own representative
to the council.
Omar Babrakzai, a former high court
judge who headed the meeting, said:
"Our aim is to bring all the fighting
under one command." He said the rebel
groups had been given 10 days to accept
the invitation to join the council. "After
that, the final makeup of the Revolutio
nary Council will be known and we will
proceed with establishing a government
in-exile," he said.
There are strong doubts that all groups
will be willing to join, and observers be
lieve a strong military commitment will be
essential if the council is to succeed.

PENSHAWAR. Pakistan — The Af
ghan government, with Soviet help, today
controls less of the countryside than the
Afghan Army alone did before the mas
sive Soviet invasion last December, ac
cording with political and military
analysts here and accounts of those re
cently arrived from Afghanistan.
The Soviets are hard-pressed to
achieve even their minimum objectives of
maintaining peace in the major cities and
keeping key road links open, these
sources report.
Traffic along the main highway linking
Kabul with Jalalabad and the Khyber
Pass, for example, is reportedly subject to
more frequent and more intense rebel at
tack than at any time since the insurgency
took root 18 months ago.
For vehicles in armed convoys, some
times including helicopter gunship air
cover, the Kabul-to-Jalalabad run -a trip
that was a three-hour ride a year ago — is
now a nightmarish ordeal of up to 12
hours.
One senior Afghan government official
who recently fled the country said officials

of the Marxist regime now rarely venture
outside Kabul because they fear it is un
safe.
Army halved
Military observers in Pakistan estimate
that the Afghan army, once 80,000
strong, now 1 has fewer than 40,000 men
still in uniform.
Large-scale desertion is the major
drain on manpower, these sources say.
More significantly, these sources note,
the quality of those deserting today is
noticeably higher than in the past. "The
Soviet involvement has weakened the re
solve of the military to resist, one analyst
said. "Many of the best remaining people
are going."
Stunned and demoralized by the feroc
ity of the initial Russian offensive up the
Kunar Valley more than two months ago,
rebel insurgents appear to have success
fully adjusted their tactics to blunt the
effectiveness of superior Soviet
firepower.
Hit and run
Shifting almost exclusively to hit-and
run night attacks against Soviet units, the
rebels have become much more effective,
military sources say. They are also learn

ing the vulnerable points of sophisticated
Soviet hardware such as the MI-24
helicopter gunships.
A leader of the Jamiat Islami rebel
group gavfe a detailed description of how
one of his units brought down a Russian
helicopter gunshipin Ghazni province re
cently by faring down on it from a hill as it
hovered over a village below.
Although Soviet ground forces have
consistently been able to penetrate rebel
strongholds, their strategy of massive
superiority means that they have been
unable to mount more than one sustained
operation at a time in eastern Afghanis
tan.
"They take 50 tanks to attack even the
smallest village," one rebel source said.
Soviets withdraw
Before launching a large-scale offen
sive in Ghazni province earlier this
mpnth, the Soviets withdrew the bulk of
their forces from the Kumar Valley, re
taining control of only a few key military
garrisons at the northern end of the val
ley.
With neither the Afghan army nor the
central government functioning outside
the major cities, there is no one to whom

the Russians can turn over control of
pacified areas.
Observers believe that a recent gather
ing ot Afghans in Peshawar may prove to
be a greater unifying force than the rebel
groups, which increasingly squabble
among themselves.
