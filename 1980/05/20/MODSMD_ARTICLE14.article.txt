# Prof, program design new typefaces at a keystroke
## 
### Jan Mireles Staff Writer 
Necessity, it is often said, is the mother of inven
tion. Stanford Computer Science Prof. Donald
Knuth is proof of this statement. His need led him
to develop a new system of typesetting.
Knuth's typesetting system is actually two sys
tems, which he refers to as TEX and Metafont.
TEX, a page formating system, designs page lay
outs, while Metafont, an alphabet design system, is
responsible for the actual appearance of letters.
Knuth says he is pleased with his progress over
the past three years.
"With printing equipment constantly changing,
mathematics suffers — now 1 won't have to change
the way the book is laid out," said Knuth.
Three years ago, while compiling the second edi
tion of his book. The Art of Computer Program
ming, Knuth realized the existing methods of
typesetting were not what»fre wanted.
"The first edition was printed in a classic hot lead
typeface, used for almost all high-quality
mathematical books. I wanted to get the same qual
ity, but the new photographiccold type didn't seem
to have it. I felt it would look terrible," Knuth said.
Dissatisfied, Knuth examined computer
produced type and found that quality letters could
be created using dots.
"By reducing type design and typesetting to a
computer science problem, all I had to cjo, was to
decide where on the page to put the ink or not to
put the ink. It's similar to flashcards at a football
stadium." explains Knuth.
Knuth's computer program is based on
mathematical principals, and can be used on

typewriter word processing devices or computer
based editors. Knuth simply types the program into
the terminal and within minutes a drawing of the
desired letter appears on the screen. Letters can he
altered by introducing random slope changes to the
program.
"When you make a change just in size, for exam
ple, the thick and thin lines change in subtle ways, 1
decided to design a program for every letter, in
terms of paramters. If a simple change were made
to one parameter, all letters would then change
automatically," Knuth says.
According to Herman Zapf, a leading type de
signer, Knuth's sytem offers a realm of oppor
tunities.
"The author now has the ability to make new
symbols of any shape or style at will," said Zapf.
C. Gordon Bell, vice-president for engineering
of Digital Equipment Corp., echoes Zapfs en
thusiasm, saying Knuth's sytems allow "a drastic
restructuring of the journal and book-publishing
industry, allowing it to be oriented substantially
more toward the author. Now the author can influ
ence his own format, and can produce more accu
rate material that can be rapialy mass produced "
More accurate material is exactly what Knuth is
working for. Knuth and Zapf are designing new
fonts for use in mathematics, and looking to the day
when any author will be able to design his or her
own type.
"The new equipment is not limiting. You can do
a million things with letters now," said Knuth.
"We've even had a few caligraphers try it, and they
had some good results," says Knuth.
