# The
						69th Bay to Breakers
## Sunday run in the City with 20,000 friends 
### John Mason Staff Writer 
It was like something out of a counter
culture movie. The traffic on the freeway
overpass had been at a standstill for 20
minutes when all of a sudden people got
out of their cars and blithely trotted away.
And if you noticed the prison-style num
bers pinned to their shirts and heard the
helicopters whirring overhead, you might
have gotten the impression that you were
witnessing an en masse escape from Big
Brother.
But actually, it all seemed quite normal
to those who realized that for San Fran
cisco, Sunday was no ordinary day. It was
time for the 69th annual "Bay to Break
ers" footrace.
As the traffic snarled on the Main St.
exit of the Bayshore Freeway, nearly
20,000 Bay area runners, anxious not to
miss the 8 a.m. starting gun, gave their
spouses and children one last kiss and
skipped down the freeway to the starting
line a few blocks from the Bay.
Once assembled, most of the throng of
Adidas- and Nike-clad pedestrians be
gan, in the fashion of some ancient East
ern ritual, groping and tugging* at them
selves. "Warm up" had begun.
As race time approached, a brass band

somewhere far off played, and San Fran
cisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein climbed
atop the official starter's platform to fire
the opening gun. A large digital-display
clock had been hoisted above the starting
line, and the crowd counted off the final
seconds at a pace that seemed to have
little relationship to the time on the clock.
When the crowd had counted to zero,
Feinstein obligingly fired the gun, and the
crowd surged forward — with four sec
onds left on the clock.
The race was four minutes old before
my partner and l ever reached the starting
line. And by the time we had gone three
blocks, what had appeared to be just a few
thousand people standing ahead of us
turned into a mass of humanity that
stretched as far as we could see.
We initially took to the sidewalk, where
the crowd was thinnest, but even fhere the
pace was slow and irregular. Since there
was nothing we could do about our prog
ress, we turned our attention to our fellow
runners. The participants ranged in age
from 5 to 75. with the notable exception
of the child of one man who obviously
hadn't been able to get a babysitter. Un
daunted. he pushed Baby, stroller and all,
along with the puffing crowd.
Apparel was pretty much the standard
for this sort of affair — tank tops and

nylon shorts. However, some spirited in
dividualists decked themselves out in
more unique attire. One fellow ran past us
carrying a large aluminum trash can,
while another intrepid athlete came dres
sed as something vaguely resembling a
taste bud.
Best of all was the hairy-legged
businessman-type who ran by in a bride's
gown, muttering something about being
"late for the ceremony."
By the time we had scrutinized all the
original characters in the crowd, we were
at the foot of the dreaded Haves Street
hill. Ugh.
The ascent of the hill was not particu
larly difficult at first, but by the half-way
point, we were thinking about taking up
another sport. Looking behind us, we saw
thousands of runners still coursing
through the streets below. It looked re
markably like one of those scenes from a
Japanese horror movie in which the ter
rified residents of Tokyo go running
through the city in an effort to escape
some large, green sea monster. But we all
know nothing lives in the bay anymore.
We eventually did reach the top of the
hill, mentally primed for the downhill half
of the race. Unfortunately, my ankles,
calves and knees had begun to complain,
and my breathing was sounding a trifle

asthmatic.
It was not until we reached Golden
Gate Park that the crowd thinned out and
we were able to set our own pace. The
cool ocean breeze and the gentle down
ward slope of the road proved to be in
vigorating.
At last, the home turn came into view.
We could see the crowd down below us,
with the beach and the ocean behind
them. Coming out of that last turn, 1
caught sight of the finish line, which 1 had
been eagerly awaiting for the past four
miles.
With a final burst of energy, we
sprinted down the straightaway, darting
from side to side in an effort not to run
over the plodders who had somehow kept
ahead of us for IVi miles. As we stepped
across the finish line, an official called out
our time — one hour even. Then, for
some diabolic reason which 1 have yet to
comprehend, the official called out the
winning time — 35 minutes. Craig Virgin,
the American record-holder for 10,000
meters, had won the race while we were
still on Hayes Hill.
But we weren't all that concerned with
the time. We just grabbed our "official
certificate" and our free bottle of mineral
water, and headed off for a well-deserved
brunch in the Citv-
