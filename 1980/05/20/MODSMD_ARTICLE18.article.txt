# THE 						STANFORD DAILY OPINIONS
## Don Caughey Support county's gay law 
### 
1 hope Gay Awareness Week helped make some
people aware that gay men and lesbian women are
people, and that homosexuality and heterosexual
itv. as two modes of human sexuality, have more in
common than not.
And 1 hope that everyone will understand and
support gay rights in Santa Clara County. The es
sential fairness and obvious need for legislation to
protect the employment and housing conditions of
homosexual people should override every other
possible personal attitude or prejudice.
The fundamentalist homophobes who are fan
ning public prejudice on gay rights are so unattrac
tive that you should support gay rights just to avoid
guilt bv association. But they are counting on your
prejudice to determine your vote.
Not just the conquering stud or the seductive
coquette, but the faithful and responsible man or
woman may identify personal value with being
heterosexual. The media has taught you to do that.
The expectations of your parents have engrained

that lesson in you.
Don't blame them; it's you who produce these
feelings. It's your pride and your insecurity, and the
fact that we find it unpleasant to admit our in
adequacies cannot justify injustice toward those
who reveal the truth. It only explains why other
wise intelligent Stanford students tell fag jokes and
react violently to an otherwise flattering inquiry
from a homosexual person. And believe me. the
growth offered to you in coming to terms with your
hcter-osexuality is a gift for which you will be grate
ful.
But that may take time. The June election will
probably be here before you get over feeling un
comfortable. Don't wait for that. Vote for gay
rights now because it is right. You will never regret
supporting justice: you would never forget the in
justice to which your fear tempts you. It's your
peace of mind at stake, too.
