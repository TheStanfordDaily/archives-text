# Missing persons hunted in wake of volcanic blast

From the Daily wire services
VANCOUVER. Wash. — Rescuers
reported finding nine persons alive yes
terday in the region devastated by
Mount St. Helens' epic eruption, but
more than 20 others still were missing
as the volcano continued to spew out
ash clouds that had drifted 1000 mile's
eastward across the Rocky Mountains.
Hie toll of known dead remained at
five in the scorched and scarred area
near the mountain, according to the
Washington State Department of
Emergency Services. Spotting of the
nine survivors buoyed hopes that
others among the missing would be
found alive.
As dozens of helicopters scoured
broad sections of southwestern
Washington, authorities were stunned
by the awesome scope of the destruc
tion wrought by the mountain's explo
sion on Sunday.
The shattering blast, described bv
geologists as unprecedented in the his
tory of the Cascade peak, reduced the
mountain's summit from an elevation
of 9677 feet to between 8000 and 8300
feet.
The explosion was so powerful that
every tree was flattened in an area es
timated at 15.miles wide and eight
miles long — or J 20 square miles of

forest once thick with towering fir
trees.
This region, said Joe Rosenbaum, a
U.S. Geological Survey geophysicist
who flew over it yesterday, "is totally
devoid of any vegetation ... It is blac
kened ... It is devastated."
Many communities across eastern
Washington and Montana were virtu
ally closed, swathed in ash up to 7 in
ches deep that choked cars and forced
residents to stay indoors with their
windows shut.
Airplane and train service were dis
rupted for wide areas around the vol
cano and many highways remained
closed.
In Montana, Gov. Thomas de
clared an air pollution state of
emergency over the entire state, order
ing all business, industry and govern
ment operations to shut down and all
citizens to stay indoors unless absor.
lutely necessary.
The explosion early Sunday opened
up a U-shaped crater more than a mile
long and about 1700 feet deep,
geologists said. It was followed by
pyroclastic flows of super-heated rock
and gases that swept down the moun
tain's slopes at speeds of up to 80 mph.
These in turn triggered massive mud
flows from melting snow, and sent four

separate surges of churning mud, water
and debris down the Toutle River, de
stroying a saw mill, dozens of houses
and cabins and at least 10 bridges.
Then came a heavy outpouring of
ash which piled up more than six feet
deep on the mountain's slopes, and up
to eight inches deep in wheat fields of
eastern Washington state, more than
100 miles away.
The clouds of ash soared 63,000 feet
into the stratosphere and soon had
drifted across Idaho,' Montana and
Wyoming. By nightfall yesterday, a
light fallout of ash was reported more
than 1000 miles away in Colorado, and
authorities said the ash clouds could
reach as far as New England in three
days.
"Our forecast calls for the ash to
track across the Dakotas. Nebraska,
northern Colorado, Kansas and Mis
souri, then swing back through to the
northeast through the Midwest and on
to New England." said meteorologist
Carl Keith at the weather bureau in
Boise, Idaho.
Because of the intensity of the explo
sive eruption, the discovery of nine
people alive within 10 miles of the
summit was termed by one sheriffs of
ficer as "nothing«»short of a miracle." 1
t Ply] Cogan of the state Emergency
Services Office said a family of four —
two adults and two children — was
found near Fawn Lake, about six miles
northwest of Mount St. Helens. Iden
tified as the Mike Moore family of
nearby Castle Rock. Wash., the quartet
apparently had been camping when the
volcano exploded.
Cogan said the rescue helicopter was
unable to land because of the weather
and heavy layer of ash. So a team of
paramedics was lowered by winch and
helped hoist the family into the hover
ing craft. "The rescue crew is going to
have to hike out," Cogan said.
Others await rescue
Authorities said five other people
were spotted several miles away along
the Toutle River, but that they could
not be rescued immediately because of
adverse weather conditions.
It was not immediately known
whether the people spotted yesterday
had been counted among the missing.
A plume of steam and ash was still
billowing 14,000 feet high from Mount
St. Helens' crater yesterday but there
were no sightings of renewed flows. No
lava has been seen, but scientists were
not ruling out the possibility of a lava
flow.
"It's still perking, but it is not as vio
lent." said Sam Frear, a spokesman for
the Forest Service. "We hope we've
seen the worst."
