## Solar power cheap and available 
### 
Can solar energy generate electricity more
cheaply than conventional energy sources?
Last quarter. Dr. Edward Teller answered
this question in Annenberg Auditorium with
a resounding "no." The Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies, however, has recently
published Alternative Energy Futures (AEF),
a study showing that solar-electric options
cheaper than either coal or nuclear power
plants may now be available. 1 would like to
share some of the AEF data to show quan
titatively the strength of the economic case
for solar electricity.
Consider first the capital investment costs
of nuclear and coal plants that solar sources
must •'beat." A good benchmark of compari
son is the cost of a power plant per unit of its
generating capacity — dollars per kilowatt
($/kw). The typical cost of a nuclear reactor
ordered today is in the range of $1500-
2000/kw, a figure that excludes uranium fuel
costs, operation costs and government sub
sidies. The capital costs of coal plants are
similar.
In comparison, the capital costs of dozens
of solar options are falling to lower levels.
The AEF report examined three solar op
tions — wind power, photovoltaic cells and
solar ponds.
While wind machine capital costs as high
as $5000 are quoted. AEF found a number
of units that sold for $300-1000/kw. South
ern California Edison, for example, paid
$667/kw for a first-of-a-kind machine in
1978. Mass-production and design im
provements could lower these costs even
further.
Photovoltaic cells, capable of transforming
sunlight directly into electricity, are widely
cited at costs of $10,000-25,000 per peak
(noontime) kilowatt ($/kwp). The U.S. gov
ernment. however, made a large purchase in
1978 for $5000 k/wp. Furthermore, the U.S.
Department of Energy expects costs to drop
to $500/kwp by 1985 and $100/kwp by
1990. A British firm and two American firms
claim to have already developed a cadmium
sulfide process that will produce cells at a
cost of $350-750/kwp, though prices may be
higher.
There are complications for both wind
machines and photovoltaic cells. The wind
cannot always blow, and the sun cannot al
ways be at its noontime peak, making the
effective cost of these technologies higher.
For example, since a $500/kw wind machine
in a prime wind region might operate a third
of the time, its effective cost would be three
times as much, or $1 500/kw. However, com
pared to a $ 1500/kw nuclear reactor in oper
ation 60 percent of the time with an effective
cost of $2500, the wind machine is still
cheaper. Likewise,a $500/kwp photovoltaic
array operating about 20 percent of the time
has an effective cost of $2500/kw, a cost
equal to that of the 60 percent reliable nuc
lear reactor. Teller's assertion that photovol
taic electricity will cost five limes that of nuc
lear power is preposterous.
Another complication is assuring that
enough solar electricity is always available to

meet electricity demands. Most analysts treat
electricity demand as uniform throughout
the day and over the year, and therefore
assume that utilities must use expensive stor
age equipment and "backup" coal-fired
plants to supplement fluctuating solar
supplies. Such analyses are naive.
A better analysis is to match carefully fluc
tuating electricity demands with fluctuating
solar energy fluxes. Total electricity demand
does not stay constant around the clock.
Each day, it generally increases from a
"base" level to a three-to-seven-hour
"peak" and then falls again. Some generat
ing units provide the "baseload," others the
"peakload," and still others an "inter
mediate load" between base and peak. Peak
summer electricity demands from air condi
tioning might correlate nicely with peak sun
shine supplies, making photovoltaic arrays
without storage a useful, economic supple
ment for a utility's peak-load.
Wind machines integrated over a large
enough area could supply intermediate loads
without any storage. The notion is that when
the wind is dead in San Diego, it probably is
blowing elsewhere in California. Wind
machines might also use hydroelectric dams
to avoid costly storage. When wind is sparse,
water can run through the dams; when it is
plentiful, excess power can pump water back
into higher reservoirs for later use.
Perhaps the most exciting prospect for
generating solar electricity without storage is
to use simple ponds. The idea is to have one
pond covered with a plastic film collector,
allowing sunlight to heat the water during the
daytime but insulating it during nighttime.
Another pond would be cooled by evapora
tion and supplementary ice ponds. Freon cir
culated between the two ponds would boil in
the hot pond and condense in the cool pond;
this freon-cyle"heat engine" would generate
electricity.
The novelty of solar ponds is that storage is
built into the system, allowing it to generate
electricity perhaps 90 percent of the time, far
more reliably than either coal or nuclear
plants. A further advantage is that solar
ponds could operate in hot or cold climates
since only the temperature difference bet
ween the ponds is important. Finally, given a
few modest technical developments, the
economics look outstanding. The principal
component, a heat engine, now sells for
$800/kwe. Early designs of solar ponds are
successfully operating in Israel, Denmark,
Massachussetts and elsewhere.
When other costs are added to capital
costs, coal and nuclear technologies appear
even less economically attractive, since solar
technologies consume no fuel, require little
maintenance, and have few environmental
impacts. Thus, solar electricity is now cost
competitive with coal or nuclear electricity.
Even though a few components of solar sys
tems are still undergoing development, the
same can be said of nuclear power (for
example, waste disposal.)
The question remains whether enough
solar energy is available to meet total U.S.

demand. Here we must resort to a measure
ment of energy called the British Thermal
Unit (BTU). In 1977. utilities generated 7.5
quadrillion BTUs (called quads). While
many analysts foresee demands for 20,30, or
even more quads in the next 50 years, others
have found much smaller utility growth fi
gures.
The AEF report predicts that the largest
amount of electricity that a utility might have
to produce by 2025 is 10 quads. At least
three good reasons account for the lower
AEF prediction: First, the AEF report rec
ognized that once consumers pay the true
costs of energy, they will find electricity the
most specialized, expensive form of energy
available and will prefer non-electric forms
of energy. This is because roughly three units
of coal, oil or gas energy produce only one
unit of electrical energy.
Consumers will thus use cheaper, non
electric forms of energy whenever possible.
An example where this is already beginning
to happen is home space heating. The U.S.
Office of Technology Assessment has found
that solar heating is now more economical
than electrical resistance heating virtually
everywhere in the country. As more con
sumers convert to solar space heating, elec
tricity demand will drop.
Second, electricity demand will fall as in
dustries increasingly co-generate electricity
from their waste heat.
Third, general conservation measures such
as the use of more efficient household
appliances and industrial motors will reduce
electricity demands: If total demand for elec
tricity never exceeds 10 quads, then the
prospect for utilities using only solar
technologies is spectacular.
Conservative estimates suggest that three
to four quads of wind energy could be tapped
by 2025. Were utilities to use suboptimal
wind regions requiring somewhat more ex
pensive wind machines, this figure would be
much higher.
Deployment of photovoltaic arrays and
solar ponds is limited not by the amount of
sunlight that falls on the continental United
States, but by the amount of cheap land av
ailable. This "limit," however, is probably
much higher than any conceivable electricity
demand. To put photovoltaic land use in
perspective, the Office of Technology As
sessment calculated that covering the ex
pected 1990 electric transmission right-of
way land with 10 percent efficient photovol
taic cells would produce 14 quads annually.
Significantly, photovoltaic plants would use
no more land than would the strip-mining
needed to produce an equivalent amount of
coal electricity.
The lesson is that there are no technical or
economic barriers to the implementation of
solar utilities, only attitude barriers. The
time has come for Teller and his ilk to wake
up to the new solar age.

When other costs are added to capital
costs, coal and nuclear technologies appear
even less economically attractive, since solar
technologies consume no fuel, require little
maintenance, and have few environmental
impacts. Thus, solar electricity is now cost
competitive with coal or nuclear electricity.
Even though a few components of solar sys
tems are still undergoing development, the
same can be said of nuclear power (for
example, waste disposal.)
The question remains whether enough
solar energy is available to meet total U.S.

demand. Here we must resort to a measure
ment of energy called the British Thermal
Unit (BTU). In 1977. utilities generated 7.5
quadrillion BTUs (called quads). While
many analysts foresee demands for 20,30, or
even more quads in the next 50 years, others
have found much smaller utility growth fi
gures.
The AEF report predicts that the largest
amount of electricity that a utility might have
to produce by 2025 is 10 quads. At least
three good reasons account for the lower
AEF prediction: First, the AEF report rec
ognized that once consumers pay the true
costs of energy, they will find electricity the
most specialized, expensive form of energy
available and will prefer non-electric forms
of energy. This is because roughly three units
of coal, oil or gas energy produce only one
unit of electrical energy.
Consumers will thus use cheaper, non
electric forms of energy whenever possible.
An example where this is already beginning
to happen is home space heating. The U.S.
Office of Technology Assessment has found
that solar heating is now more economical
than electrical resistance heating virtually
everywhere in the country. As more con
sumers convert to solar space heating, elec
tricity demand will drop.
Second, electricity demand will fall as in
dustries increasingly co-generate electricity
from their waste heat.
Third, general conservation measures such
as the use of more efficient household
appliances and industrial motors will reduce
electricity demands: If total demand for elec
tricity never exceeds 10 quads, then the
prospect for utilities using only solar
technologies is spectacular.
Conservative estimates suggest that three
to four quads of wind energy could be tapped
by 2025. Were utilities to use suboptimal
wind regions requiring somewhat more ex
pensive wind machines, this figure would be
much higher.
Deployment of photovoltaic arrays and
solar ponds is limited not by the amount of
sunlight that falls on the continental United
States, but by the amount of cheap land av
ailable. This "limit," however, is probably
much higher than any conceivable electricity
demand. To put photovoltaic land use in
perspective, the Office of Technology As
sessment calculated that covering the ex
pected 1990 electric transmission right-of
way land with 10 percent efficient photovol
taic cells would produce 14 quads annually.
Significantly, photovoltaic plants would use
no more land than would the strip-mining
needed to produce an equivalent amount of
coal electricity.
The lesson is that there are no technical or
economic barriers to the implementation of
solar utilities, only attitude barriers. The
time has come for Teller and his ilk to wake
up to the new solar age.

Can solar energy generate electricity more
cheaply than conventional energy sources?
Last quarter. Dr. Edward Teller answered
this question in Annenberg Auditorium with
a resounding "no." The Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies, however, has recently
published Alternative Energy Futures (AEF),
a study showing that solar-electric options
cheaper than either coal or nuclear power
plants may now be available. 1 would like to
share some of the AEF data to show quan
titatively the strength of the economic case
for solar electricity.
Consider first the capital investment costs
of nuclear and coal plants that solar sources
must •'beat." A good benchmark of compari
son is the cost of a power plant per unit of its
generating capacity — dollars per kilowatt
($/kw). The typical cost of a nuclear reactor
ordered today is in the range of $1500-
2000/kw, a figure that excludes uranium fuel
costs, operation costs and government sub
sidies. The capital costs of coal plants are
similar.
In comparison, the capital costs of dozens
of solar options are falling to lower levels.
The AEF report examined three solar op
tions — wind power, photovoltaic cells and
solar ponds.
While wind machine capital costs as high
as $5000 are quoted. AEF found a number
of units that sold for $300-1000/kw. South
ern California Edison, for example, paid
$667/kw for a first-of-a-kind machine in
1978. Mass-production and design im
provements could lower these costs even
further.
Photovoltaic cells, capable of transforming
sunlight directly into electricity, are widely
cited at costs of $10,000-25,000 per peak
(noontime) kilowatt ($/kwp). The U.S. gov
ernment. however, made a large purchase in
1978 for $5000 k/wp. Furthermore, the U.S.
Department of Energy expects costs to drop
to $500/kwp by 1985 and $100/kwp by
1990. A British firm and two American firms
claim to have already developed a cadmium
sulfide process that will produce cells at a
cost of $350-750/kwp, though prices may be
higher.
There are complications for both wind
machines and photovoltaic cells. The wind
cannot always blow, and the sun cannot al
ways be at its noontime peak, making the
effective cost of these technologies higher.
For example, since a $500/kw wind machine
in a prime wind region might operate a third
of the time, its effective cost would be three
times as much, or $1 500/kw. However, com
pared to a $ 1500/kw nuclear reactor in oper
ation 60 percent of the time with an effective
cost of $2500, the wind machine is still
cheaper. Likewise,a $500/kwp photovoltaic
array operating about 20 percent of the time
has an effective cost of $2500/kw, a cost
equal to that of the 60 percent reliable nuc
lear reactor. Teller's assertion that photovol
taic electricity will cost five limes that of nuc
lear power is preposterous.
Another complication is assuring that
enough solar electricity is always available to

meet electricity demands. Most analysts treat
electricity demand as uniform throughout
the day and over the year, and therefore
assume that utilities must use expensive stor
age equipment and "backup" coal-fired
plants to supplement fluctuating solar
supplies. Such analyses are naive.
A better analysis is to match carefully fluc
tuating electricity demands with fluctuating
solar energy fluxes. Total electricity demand
does not stay constant around the clock.
Each day, it generally increases from a
"base" level to a three-to-seven-hour
"peak" and then falls again. Some generat
ing units provide the "baseload," others the
"peakload," and still others an "inter
mediate load" between base and peak. Peak
summer electricity demands from air condi
tioning might correlate nicely with peak sun
shine supplies, making photovoltaic arrays
without storage a useful, economic supple
ment for a utility's peak-load.
Wind machines integrated over a large
enough area could supply intermediate loads
without any storage. The notion is that when
the wind is dead in San Diego, it probably is
blowing elsewhere in California. Wind
machines might also use hydroelectric dams
to avoid costly storage. When wind is sparse,
water can run through the dams; when it is
plentiful, excess power can pump water back
into higher reservoirs for later use.
Perhaps the most exciting prospect for
generating solar electricity without storage is
to use simple ponds. The idea is to have one
pond covered with a plastic film collector,
allowing sunlight to heat the water during the
daytime but insulating it during nighttime.
Another pond would be cooled by evapora
tion and supplementary ice ponds. Freon cir
culated between the two ponds would boil in
the hot pond and condense in the cool pond;
this freon-cyle"heat engine" would generate
electricity.
The novelty of solar ponds is that storage is
built into the system, allowing it to generate
electricity perhaps 90 percent of the time, far
more reliably than either coal or nuclear
plants. A further advantage is that solar
ponds could operate in hot or cold climates
since only the temperature difference bet
ween the ponds is important. Finally, given a
few modest technical developments, the
economics look outstanding. The principal
component, a heat engine, now sells for
$800/kwe. Early designs of solar ponds are
successfully operating in Israel, Denmark,
Massachussetts and elsewhere.
When other costs are added to capital
costs, coal and nuclear technologies appear
even less economically attractive, since solar
technologies consume no fuel, require little
maintenance, and have few environmental
impacts. Thus, solar electricity is now cost
competitive with coal or nuclear electricity.

cannot always blow, and the sun cannot al
ways be at its noontime peak, making the
effective cost of these technologies higher.
For example, since a $500/kw wind machine
in a prime wind region might operate a third
of the time, its effective cost would be three
times as much, or $1 500/kw. However, com
pared to a $ 1500/kw nuclear reactor in oper
ation 60 percent of the time with an effective
cost of $2500, the wind machine is still
cheaper. Likewise,a $500/kwp photovoltaic
array operating about 20 percent of the time
has an effective cost of $2500/kw, a cost
equal to that of the 60 percent reliable nuc
lear reactor. Teller's assertion that photovol
taic electricity will cost five limes that of nuc
lear power is preposterous.
Another complication is assuring that
enough solar electricity is always available to

meet electricity demands. Most analysts treat
electricity demand as uniform throughout
the day and over the year, and therefore
assume that utilities must use expensive stor
age equipment and "backup" coal-fired
plants to supplement fluctuating solar
supplies. Such analyses are naive.
A better analysis is to match carefully fluc
tuating electricity demands with fluctuating
solar energy fluxes. Total electricity demand
does not stay constant around the clock.
Each day, it generally increases from a
"base" level to a three-to-seven-hour
"peak" and then falls again. Some generat
ing units provide the "baseload," others the
"peakload," and still others an "inter
mediate load" between base and peak. Peak
summer electricity demands from air condi
tioning might correlate nicely with peak sun
shine supplies, making photovoltaic arrays
without storage a useful, economic supple
ment for a utility's peak-load.
Wind machines integrated over a large
enough area could supply intermediate loads
without any storage. The notion is that when
the wind is dead in San Diego, it probably is
blowing elsewhere in California. Wind
machines might also use hydroelectric dams
to avoid costly storage. When wind is sparse,
water can run through the dams; when it is
plentiful, excess power can pump water back
into higher reservoirs for later use.
Perhaps the most exciting prospect for
generating solar electricity without storage is
to use simple ponds. The idea is to have one
pond covered with a plastic film collector,
allowing sunlight to heat the water during the
daytime but insulating it during nighttime.
Another pond would be cooled by evapora
tion and supplementary ice ponds. Freon cir
culated between the two ponds would boil in
the hot pond and condense in the cool pond;
this freon-cyle"heat engine" would generate
electricity.
The novelty of solar ponds is that storage is
built into the system, allowing it to generate
electricity perhaps 90 percent of the time, far
more reliably than either coal or nuclear
plants. A further advantage is that solar
ponds could operate in hot or cold climates
since only the temperature difference bet
ween the ponds is important. Finally, given a
few modest technical developments, the
economics look outstanding. The principal
component, a heat engine, now sells for
$800/kwe. Early designs of solar ponds are
successfully operating in Israel, Denmark,
Massachussetts and elsewhere.
When other costs are added to capital
costs, coal and nuclear technologies appear
even less economically attractive, since solar
technologies consume no fuel, require little
maintenance, and have few environmental
impacts. Thus, solar electricity is now cost
competitive with coal or nuclear electricity.
Even though a few components of solar sys
tems are still undergoing development, the
same can be said of nuclear power (for
example, waste disposal.)
The question remains whether enough
solar energy is available to meet total U.S.

demand. Here we must resort to a measure
ment of energy called the British Thermal
Unit (BTU). In 1977. utilities generated 7.5
quadrillion BTUs (called quads). While
many analysts foresee demands for 20,30, or
even more quads in the next 50 years, others
have found much smaller utility growth fi
gures.
The AEF report predicts that the largest
amount of electricity that a utility might have
to produce by 2025 is 10 quads. At least
three good reasons account for the lower
AEF prediction: First, the AEF report rec
ognized that once consumers pay the true
costs of energy, they will find electricity the
most specialized, expensive form of energy
available and will prefer non-electric forms
of energy. This is because roughly three units
of coal, oil or gas energy produce only one
unit of electrical energy.
Consumers will thus use cheaper, non
electric forms of energy whenever possible.
An example where this is already beginning
to happen is home space heating. The U.S.
Office of Technology Assessment has found
that solar heating is now more economical
than electrical resistance heating virtually
everywhere in the country. As more con
sumers convert to solar space heating, elec
tricity demand will drop.
Second, electricity demand will fall as in
dustries increasingly co-generate electricity
from their waste heat.
Third, general conservation measures such
as the use of more efficient household
appliances and industrial motors will reduce
electricity demands: If total demand for elec
tricity never exceeds 10 quads, then the
prospect for utilities using only solar
technologies is spectacular.
Conservative estimates suggest that three
to four quads of wind energy could be tapped
by 2025. Were utilities to use suboptimal
wind regions requiring somewhat more ex
pensive wind machines, this figure would be
much higher.
Deployment of photovoltaic arrays and
solar ponds is limited not by the amount of
sunlight that falls on the continental United
States, but by the amount of cheap land av
ailable. This "limit," however, is probably
much higher than any conceivable electricity
demand. To put photovoltaic land use in
perspective, the Office of Technology As
sessment calculated that covering the ex
pected 1990 electric transmission right-of
way land with 10 percent efficient photovol
taic cells would produce 14 quads annually.
Significantly, photovoltaic plants would use
no more land than would the strip-mining
needed to produce an equivalent amount of
coal electricity.
The lesson is that there are no technical or
economic barriers to the implementation of
solar utilities, only attitude barriers. The
time has come for Teller and his ilk to wake
up to the new solar age.

Can solar energy generate electricity more
cheaply than conventional energy sources?
Last quarter. Dr. Edward Teller answered
this question in Annenberg Auditorium with
a resounding "no." The Stanford Institute
for Energy Studies, however, has recently
published Alternative Energy Futures (AEF),
a study showing that solar-electric options
cheaper than either coal or nuclear power
plants may now be available. 1 would like to
share some of the AEF data to show quan
titatively the strength of the economic case
for solar electricity.
Consider first the capital investment costs
of nuclear and coal plants that solar sources
must •'beat." A good benchmark of compari
son is the cost of a power plant per unit of its
generating capacity — dollars per kilowatt
($/kw). The typical cost of a nuclear reactor
ordered today is in the range of $1500-
2000/kw, a figure that excludes uranium fuel
costs, operation costs and government sub
sidies. The capital costs of coal plants are
similar.
In comparison, the capital costs of dozens
of solar options are falling to lower levels.
The AEF report examined three solar op
tions — wind power, photovoltaic cells and
solar ponds.
While wind machine capital costs as high
as $5000 are quoted. AEF found a number
of units that sold for $300-1000/kw. South
ern California Edison, for example, paid
$667/kw for a first-of-a-kind machine in
1978. Mass-production and design im
provements could lower these costs even
further.
Photovoltaic cells, capable of transforming
sunlight directly into electricity, are widely
cited at costs of $10,000-25,000 per peak
(noontime) kilowatt ($/kwp). The U.S. gov
ernment. however, made a large purchase in
1978 for $5000 k/wp. Furthermore, the U.S.
Department of Energy expects costs to drop
to $500/kwp by 1985 and $100/kwp by
1990. A British firm and two American firms
claim to have already developed a cadmium
sulfide process that will produce cells at a
cost of $350-750/kwp, though prices may be
higher.
There are complications for both wind
machines and photovoltaic cells. The wind
cannot always blow, and the sun cannot al
ways be at its noontime peak, making the
effective cost of these technologies higher.
For example, since a $500/kw wind machine
in a prime wind region might operate a third
of the time, its effective cost would be three
times as much, or $1 500/kw. However, com
pared to a $ 1500/kw nuclear reactor in oper
ation 60 percent of the time with an effective
cost of $2500, the wind machine is still
cheaper. Likewise,a $500/kwp photovoltaic
array operating about 20 percent of the time
has an effective cost of $2500/kw, a cost
equal to that of the 60 percent reliable nuc
lear reactor. Teller's assertion that photovol
taic electricity will cost five limes that of nuc
lear power is preposterous.
Another complication is assuring that
enough solar electricity is always available to

meet electricity demands. Most analysts treat
