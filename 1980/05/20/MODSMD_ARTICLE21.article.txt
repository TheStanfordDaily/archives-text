# Four libertarian myths addressed
## 
### 
In my last column (Daily,
April 24), 1 addressed two myths
about libertarians likely to be
held by liberals. Here are some
mo;-e likely to be held by conser
vatives.
Myth No. 3: Libertarians be
lieve that each individual acts in
isolation, without influencing or
being influenced by others. This
is a puzzling charge. 1 know of no
one, libertarian or not. who
holds this view.
Libertarians, to be sure, are
methodical individualists. They
believe the only way to under
stand the workings of the world
is through the analysis of the in
teractions of individuals. Only
individuals think, feel, value and
choose. "Society" has no inde
pendent existence apart from the
individuals that compose it.and
can have no rights beyond the
rights of its members.
No individualist denies that
people are influencing each
other all of the time in their go
als, values and pursuits. Fried
rich Hayek pointed out in his ar
ticle. "The Non-Sequitar of the
"Dependence Effect,'" that
John Kenneth Galbraith's as

sault on free-market economics
in his best-selling The Affluent
Society rested on this proposi
tion: Economics assumes that
every individual arrives at his set
of values totally on his own,
without being subject to influ
ence by anyone else. On the con
trary, as Hayek replied,
everyone knows that most
people do not originate their
own values, but are influenced to
adopt them by others. What
libertarians oppose, of course, is
the imposition, by force, of one
person's values or choices on
another.
Myth No. 4: Libertarians think
people should only be concerned
with their own welfare and their
own private lives and not with so
cial problems or the public
sphere.
Libertarians recognize social
cooperation and aid are an integ
ral part of civilization. It is pre
cisely because of their concern
for the problems of society that
they oppose the destructive and
oppressive influence of govern
ment.
The major social problems of
our time —unemployment, en
vironmental degradation, poor
quality education, inflation, dis
crimination — are either caused
or exacerbated by government
intervention. Social problems
are an inevitable consequence of
any coercive, centralized process
that cannot and will not take into
account the particular cir
cumstances of each individual as
it imposes "solutions" on him.
Of course people should be
concerned with their private
lives; that is only natural. But
they should also be concerned
about the other actors and the
stage upon which the drama of
life is played. A free society gives
them maximum opportunity to
demonstrate their concern and
to give freely to others. A gov
ernment dominated society only
stifles the human impulses of
charity.
Mvth No. 5: Libertarianism is

atheistic and ignores the religious
and spiritual side of life.
There is no necessary connec
tion between being for or against
libertarianism and one's position
on the spiritual nature of man. I
know of libertarian atheists,
Christians, Moslems, Jews and
Buddhists.
As Ronald Howard points out,
enlightenment comes from
transcending such apparent
paradoxes as individuality and
oneness, freedom and responsi-

bility, and mind and heart. The
libertarian path comes from the
first half of these paradoxes: in
dividuality, freedom and mind.
People more comfortable with
oneness, responsibility and heart
may question the libertarian pos
ition because they feel it is not
responsive to these values. But
we should realize that these con
cepts are inseparable. I believe
that only a libertarian society can
achieve both freedom and re
sponsibility because compassion
can only come from the free
choice of individuals.
Myth No. 6: Libertarians
would cut back the American
military so drastically as to virtu
ally surrender to the Soviets.
Libertarians favor a strong
and adequate defense of the Un
ited States, but hold that inter
vention in the affairs of other na
tions decreases our security by
promoting suspicion, conflict
and nuclear brinksmanship. Not
only is the defense of other na
tions not a proper use of our re
sources, but generally produces

the opposite of the stated inten
tions.
With the 60 percent of the de
fense budget that is not used to
defend American soil, our lead
ers have installed and propped
up dictators, armed both sides in
numerous conflicts, and killed
hundreds of thousands in the
name of defending freedom. The
toll in human misery abroad and
inflation at home has been stag
gering. And just what have we
got to show for it?

Let no nation ever doubt our
ability to defend ourselves. But
we should return to the tradi
tional American stance of non
intervention, realizing that the
world is far too complex for us to
control. By providing a shining
example of a free and prosperous
society, we shall do far more
good than the export of arms or
aid could ever accomplish. Free
trade, open borders and friendly
relations with all countries will
benefit all the people of the
world.
1 hope I have dispelled some of
the more common myths about
libertarianism. It is understand
able that they have arisen: al
most all new ideas are misun
derstood at first. But this new
idea is really a very old idea, one
of the most powerful in the
world. It is the idea of freedom,
and it is not going to go away. Let
us discuss it without the hindr
ance of these misconceptions.
