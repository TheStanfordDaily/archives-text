Arrests deserved
Repeal of laws against
homosexuality has been based
on the premise that consenting
adults have a right to perform in
private whatever sexual acts they
prefer. No one, heterosexual or
homosexual, has the right to en
gage in sexual acts in public.
Why, then, the hue and cry of
outrage agaisnt the 10 arrests in
the Stanford men's restrooms?
Those men, by openly and pub
licly breaking the law. deserved
to be arrested. Surely they must
have been aware of the law and
the risks they were taking.
Furthermore, what about the
rights of those men who were
unwillingly propositioned or ex
posed to sexual acts in the re
strooms. acts that they may have
considered offensive?

Delts take action
A Daily article of May 15 cor
rectly stated that the administra
tion has undertaken an investiga
tion stemming from certain ac
tivities in respect to the Delta
Tau Delta fraternity, that is to
say: 1) an incident wherein three
members of Delta Tau Delta
threw oranges at the neighboring
Theta Xi fraternity, and 2) an
altercation wherein a friend of a
member of Delta Tau Delta
punched a person at a Synergy
house party.
The Delta Tau Delta frater
nity does not condone these in
dividual actions, and recognizing
that any kind of post-hoc
apologies are insufficient re
medies, has voted as a house to
impose one-quarter housing
suspensions upon the individual
members who participated in the
above incidents.
The Delta Tau Delta frater
nity resolutely believes that
these measures not only will pro
vide a sufficient, practical deter
rent to future actions of this sort,
but also will act as a symbolic
gesture on the house's part that it
indeed is committed to effective
self-governance and assumes re
sponsibility for the actions of its
individual members.

Poor conduct
The conduct of former As
sociate Prof. H. Bruce Franklin,
both in class and on campus, was
unbecoming of a member of the
faculty, whose privileges he de- 1
liberately abused. This should
have been corrected by the
chairman of his department, but
it was not.
The charges made against him
are all true, as everybody knows

and agrees. The question is only
what to do about it. On this,
there has been and there is an
agreement; all depends on the
likelihood that he will or will not
behave, and on his willingness to
promise to do so.

Gay signs defaced
Jim Hedges' passionate appeal
for his right to hang up flyers on
campus (Daily, May 12) really
touched an important point of
freedom of choice at Stanford.
As representatives of an or
ganization that also suffers from
having most of its signs defaced
or destroyed within hours of
their posting, we feel for Hedges
and the problems he faces in try
ing to propogate an unpopular
idea on an unwilling student
body.
In fact, we noticed just last
quarter that 90 percent of the
flyers we had posted in Mirrielees
one weekend had gone down
within 24 hours
We sympathize with Hedges
and thank him for taking matters
into his own hands by trying to
single-handedly enlighten Stan
ford students. We only hope that
his efforts been successful.

Sorority response
As members of the Delta
Gamma sorority, we were disap
pointed to read the editorial
condemning all sororities for the
actions of a few groups, "Hold
line on sororities," (Daily, May
7). Our group has not only been
working hard to gain University
recognition, but also to gain the
acceptance of the Stanford
community.
The Daily editorial's blanket
condemnation of all sororities
only serves to hinder our good
faith efforts and to create misun
derstanding and ill feelings in the
community.
The Stanford chapter of Delta
Gamma is completely autonom
ous in selecting its members and
makes no use of recommenda
tion letters or information from
outside sources. Any such out
side letters received are confi
dentially filed for the protection
of potential members and are
unavailable to all those affiliated
with Delta Gamma.
