# 'It is Fritz Brun's play
## A
						mad 'Murderer' 
### 
Some plays are riveting because of the
strength and expanse of a single character, be
cause of a brilliance which eclipses what ordi
narily might be dull. The Drama Department's
production of Pavel Kohout's Poor Murderer,
directed by David McCandless, contains just
such a performance.
The play focuses on the enigmatic distinction
between pretense and madness. As the central
character, Kerzhentsev, puts it, "Have 1 pre
tended insanity to get away with murder, or did
1 commit murder because I am insane?"
It is the question of a disturbed and discon
nected mind — a mind and personality which
Fritz Brun (Kerzhentsev) portrays with great
facility. In each stage of the developing madness
{Poor Murderer is a play within a play: it re
counts Kerzhentsev's life itself as a play and
focuses on the evolution of his madness), Brun
imbues the drama with realistic dynamics of a
fragmented mind. His antics are clever, amus
ing, disturbing and professional.
As a pouting child, bent and quivering before
his drunk and booming father, he is rather more
farcical than plaintive. As a young student of
medicine with a finely polished veneer, his de
ception of the over-faithful is a tribute to clev
erness. As a calculating murderer, he is disturb
ing. As a decided madman. Brun's hollowed
eyes under bright, white lights are startlingly
and believably mad.
In essence, Brun is a master ot the myriad
forms and fancies of Kerzhentsev's fractured
mind. Likewise, other characters are given the
opportunity to transform themselves into vari
ous persons in Kerzhentsev's lile, Savelyov
(Brent Shaphren), Kerzhentsev'sclosest friend,
and Tanya (Miriam Yahil-Wax), Savelyov's
wife and the source of Kerzhentsev's despair,
play themselves. Shaphren and Yahil-Wax are
admirably confused when Kerzhentsev doesn t
recognize them and when his deranged version
of events slights them and forces them into roles
they never played.

The lesser characters each play three diffe
rent people in Kerzhentsev's lite. Unlike Ker
zhentsev. however, they lack the psychological
depth which his play-acting develops. As a re
sult, the lesser actors sometimes seem to be
speaking words rather than creating scenes.
This is not to decry the performance of the
supporting actors. They are, to the contrary,
quite sufficient and, often, delightful (Larry
Kaiser as Kerzhentsev's drunk and debauched
father, Nancy Koehn as Irina Pavlovna Kur
ganova, astonished and unimpressed by Ker
zhentsev's hardly articulate attack of madness
at her party). It is merely that Poor Murderer is
Fritz Brun's play.
Of integral importance to the success of the
play are the set and costume designs by William
Eddelman. The set. a makeshift stage, chairs, a
costume rack, is placed against a backdrop
adorned with an abstract design befitting mad
ness and is of a dramatic height (stretching from
the ceiling of the theater to stage level) which
suggests a timelessness and austerity out of Gre
cian drama and a coldness endemic to asylums.
The costumes, necessary visual aids to the
establishment of both era and ambiance, are
beautiful, especially those of the actresses':
Uirn-of-the-centurv luxuriant velvets, plumed
hats, fur cloaks. Brun is dressed in white and
black, a particularly effective combination for
the starkness of the concluding scene.
The entire production is a very good combi
nation of parts. It is an example of how theater
can work well and what is necessary for it to do
so. In this case, it takes a strong and versatile
lead, supported by a competent and sturdy cast,
embellished with dramatic flavor by well
crafted costumes and sets.
Above all. Poor Murderer is a play with a star.
It is Fritz Brun's play. And it is very good.

Theater. Tickets are available at Tresidder.)
