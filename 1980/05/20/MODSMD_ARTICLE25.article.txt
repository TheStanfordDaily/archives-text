## Vendors of splendor at Manzanita

Joe Perry is one mean
guitarist. But,then again, he al
ways was. Formerly lead
guitarist with Aerosmith, Perry
helped forge the raw, relentless
rock 'n' roll sound that estab
lished the Boston band as one of
the heavy-metal bands of the
'70s. Also 'co-author of Aero
smith hits "Draw the Line" and
"Walk This Way," he now head
lines his own group, the Joe
Perry Project.
The Project highlighted the
bill of fare offered at Splendoron
the Grass, last weekend's annual
festival-style activities in Man
zanita Park. Cosponsored by the
residents of the trailor park and
Budweiser and aided by ASSU,
Splendor offered plenty of beer
and boogie for those wise
enough to abandon their trou
bles and textbooks for a few
hours. More than a dozen Stan
ford bands and local artists pro
vided the music to satisfy a vari
ety of tastes.
Murphy's Lawyers, Claude
Monet and Wildebeest un
leashed rowdy rock and R&B
numbers on the sun-baked,
brew-stewed audience reposing
on the grass. Mariah stomped
out everything from Springs
teen's" Rosalita" to Greg Kihn's
"Madison Avenue Man." For
the jazz buff there was the sound
of Baybop. The mellower folk
lovers enjoyed bands Wysteria,
Lothlorien and Tim Duanp
(Bravo, Tim). And yes, you
favorite and mine, the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band, with next year's
Dollies in attendance, brought
solemn dignity to the proceed
ings. Rooftop Magic pleased the
entire crowd as the final act on
the agenda.
And then there was the Joe
Perry Project. Hued in the blues
of the stage lighting and clad in
black leather slacks, Joe Perry
looked every inch a rock 'n' rol
ler. Perry's new band consists of
mopheaded David Hull on bass
guitar, Ralph Mormon as lead
singer and Ronnie Stewart man
ning the drum kit. The group did
several numbers from its first
LP release, including "Ready on
the Firing Line," "Rockin'
Train" and title cut "Let the
Music Do the Talking." Other
songs included "Walk This
Way" and "Talk Talk," a '60s
tune.
Sultry, loud, electric, the
music of the Joe Perry Project is
the hard rock most of us rock 'n'
rollers cut our teeth on. There is
a certain implicit energy and de
fiance of outlook in the band's
music that recalls the mystique of
an entire era.
Amid the three-chord guitar
extravaganzas of punking

Ramones clones and the con
trived theatrics of New Wave
groups, the mind hearkens back
to the simple, elegant, frenzied
guitar riffs of a Richie
Blackmore, Alvin Lee or Jimmy
Page.
An interview: Saturday
Joe Perry can handle a guitar.
A rocker of scorpionic good
looks, he looks like he means
business. Reclining in the com
fort of the band's colorful bus.
Perry has yet another gig to play
this evening. This man played
with Aerosmith. That conjures up
some vivid images. Nervous gig
gles and Bostonian vowel sounds
have been omitted from the in
terview.
Perry discusses his departure
from Aerosmith: he thought the
band was beginning to stagnate.
"Rocks and Toys in the Attic
were high points. The band was
doing things then. But then we
took some time off after Draw
the Line, which could have
sounded better. It took a long
time, and we did a tour right af
ter. We made/l Night in the Ruts

and it was real hard. A lot of
people don't even think I played
on that album. 1 wrote all the
music,arranged all the musicand
played on all the tracks. Then I
set it up with Steve (Tyler, lead
singer of Aerosmith) to write the
words as usual.
"It took so long for everything
to come together around it, I got

disillusioned. And they mixed a
lot of tracks down. 1 don't know
why, hut they did. And there was
some hot shit stuff on that album.
Like "Break Song." It sounds
like a rocket ship taking off. Too
bad. It sounds all that much bet
ter on my album/'
Daily: What will distinguish your
sound from that, of Aerosmith?
Perry: 1 plan to be more contem

porary. I see Aerosmith as the
archetypical ''70s band. They'll
always be known for that. As
long as they keep putting out al
bums they'll have that certain
distinction. Whereas, I think I'll
be into the music earning my
wings as I go along, instead of
just flying on the old ones.
Perry also is the group'.s man
ager and notes proudly that the
band has been booked into
sold-out houses in Boston and
L.A. They recently played for a
crowd of 10,000 in San Juan,
Puerto Rico. Plans include
another album, Soldier of For
tune. due out by Christmas. The
Joe Perry Project also will play
opening dates for Heart and
Sammv Hagar later this year.
Perry plans to schedule dates in
bigger halls to include the kids
who can't get into clubs. Joe
Perry: one alternative to pink
hair and fishnets.
