# 'On a Clear Day'
## Gleason shines as silly psychic 
### 
You could see forever, but you
need look only as far as Joanna
Gleason to find the heart of the
Civic Light Opera's revival of On
a Clear Day.
Without Gleason's fresh pre
sence and voice, this production
of the Burton. Lane-Alan Jay
Lerner musical would be bland
and moth-worn (The show
opened on Broadway in 1965; it
is not a timeless piece of theater.)
Lerners lyrics and story, a tale
of ESP and reincarnation, crawl
through the usual superficialities
of the commercial circuit. The
songs and dialogue just don't
match the promise of the intrigu
ing premise: a psychiatrist
(Robert Goulet) finds a woman
(Gleason) whose extraordinary
mental powers allow her to recall
a past life as a randy English
woman of the 18th century.
Goulet falls for the alter-ego;
Gleason falls for Goulet. An in
verted triangle follows, compli
cated by a scattering of "other
women" and "other men," all
made of a very low grade of
cardboard.
Lane's score is pleasant, which
means you can't remember any
of it as being particularly bad —
or good. The exceptions are the
title number, the lilting "Hey.
It's Lovely Up Here" and
"Come Back to Me." a magne
tic, bouncy love song.
Goulet sings versions of all
three numbers, and he makes the
most of the opportunities. His
powerful voice rings through the
theater, and his somewhat
demonic dark eyes and beard
wring adoring gasps out of
certain members of the audi
ence. His actingis smooth, but he
addresses some of his songs as if
he were emoting in Don

Giovanni.
In contrast, Gleason is a
fireball. As the Scatterbrained
psychiatrist's patient, she beams
and bumbles with the grace of a
newborn foal — not clumsy, but
happily misplaced. She makes
the frequent and difficult transi
tion to the haughty Englishwo
man with a fluidity which charac
terizes her entire performance.
As Daisy Gamble (of today) she
trips over her own feet, chain
smokes, talks so fast and
thoughtlessly that the words
trample one another on the way
out of her mouth. As Melinda (of
way back when) she cuts a fine
quadrille and rounds her vowels.
It's a beautiful Eliza Doolittle
done sideways, sort of, by
Gleason and director Alfred
Drake.
The supporting cast has little
to work with. Susan Cotton
stands out as Goulet's salty boss.
The Civic Light Opera has de
veloped its own style in costume
design: rather blatant color
schemes and clothes cut so that
even a blind person could tell this
is musical comedy. Gleason,
Goulet and Cotton escape, but
everyone else tends to look like a
flight attendant.
William and Jean Eckart's sets
play with perspective and pun on
psychology (Goulet's office is
decorated with lithographs of
Rorschach blotches.) The de
signs would have been more ef
fective if not for some question
able lighting and technicians' er
rors.
