# Complex vision of Germany
## Oskar's drum 
### 
Anyone with lingering doubts
about the sanity of the aduFt
world will find a sympathetic
voice in The Tin Drum. And for
those of us who still harbor a sec
ret allegiance to childhood, the
film provides a genuine hero in
Oskar Mazerath, a 3-year
old boy in World War II Ger
many who refuses to grow up.
Winner of the 1980 Academy
Award for best foreign picture,
The Tin Drum is an epic adapta
tion of Gunter Grass' challeng
ing novel. Director Volkar
Schlondorff has turned this
modern German classic into a
film of stunning visual grace and
emotional power.
The film's star is a tiny,
frighteningly sharp 11-year-old
named David Bennent. As
young Oskar, Bennent looks out
at tfoe world behind hauntingly
pale blue eyes which see every
thing and reveal nothing.
The picture's point of view be
longs to Oskar. He narrates as
well as performs (the German
dialogue has subtitles, but the
visual imagery usually speaks
eloquently for itself). The cam
era operates chiefly from the
boy's 4-foot height.
The visual images are rich, dis
turbing and daringly intimate.
Schlondorffs camera is com
pletely at home in the private
confines of bedroom, church,
even wom£>. In the scene of Os
kar's birth, the camera follows
his perilous journey out of his
mother and into the new world.
All the while, Oskar's voice dis
passionately records his displea
sure at being evicted from such
hospitable accommodations into
a hostile, uncertain world.
Oskar's early years coincide
with the rise of the Nazi party in
Germany. At age 3, he an
nounces that he has had enough.
Watching the drunken antics of
his family at his birthday party,
he decides to remain a child
forever and so to avoid the dup
licitous entanglements of the
adult world. ,Tl iat Oskar's
strange power to control his
growth seems perfectly natural is
a tribute to both his performance
and Schlondorff s adaptation of
Grass' surrealistic novel. ' ,
The body of the film follows
Oskar's progress to the age of 20.
His physical appearance never
changes. He keeps the world at
bay with a tin drum — symbol of
his perennial youth — and a
superhuman screaming ability,
which allows him to shatter glass

and wreak hilarious havoc.
The events transpiring around
Oskar are much less light
hearted. The Nazis come to
power and threaten the boy's
home town of Danzig, located
between Germany and Poland.
The allegiance of his mother
(Angela Winkler) is torn bet
ween her patriotic German hus
band and Jan, her Polish cousin
and lover. In the film's most ex
traordinary scene, she meets a
fisherman hauling a cow's de
composed head onto a beach, the
carcass-bait filled with slithering
eels. After this horrifying por
tent of societal chaos, the rising
Nazi tide drives the passionate
woman to self-destruction.
For the most part, Oscar
watches his country's political
confusion and his mother's sex
ual betrayals with an unnerving,
placid expression. On several oc
casions, however, the film builds
to apocalyptic seizures as the
small boy lashes out at the en
croaching world with his drum
ming and screeching. Oskar's
targets often are social institu
tions; he attacks the windows of
a church, his schoolteacher's
glasses, and a doctor's specimen
jars.
After the death of Oskar's
mother, the film loses some of its
emotional balance. The second
half of the 140-minute story ca
reens a bit, without her sym
pathetic character to hold things
together. Her place in Oskar's
life is filled by a succession of
loners, madmen and midgets.
Especially noteworthy is Charles
Aznavour as a sensitive, but
doomed Jewish shopkeeper.
These castoffs from society are
the only characters who preserve
their heart and integrity through
the Nazi era.
The huge scale of The Tin
Drum covers four generations,
from Oskar's peasant grand
mother (who begins and ends the
film, surviving it all) to his own
illegitimate son. The result is a
complex vision of 20th-century
Germany, as seen through the
eyes of a mysterious child, alter
nately touching and frightening.
Oskar emerges intact though not
untainted. When the Nazis are
vanquished at the end of the war,
he decides to resume growing up.
The viewer is left with the bit
tersweet sight of Oskar tossing
aside his tin drum, abandoning
forever the deeply moving vigil
of his childhood.

small boy lashes out at the en
croaching world with his drum
ming and screeching. Oskar's
targets often are social institu
tions; he attacks the windows of
a church, his schoolteacher's
glasses, and a doctor's specimen
jars.
After the death of Oskar's
mother, the film loses some of its
emotional balance. The second
half of the 140-minute story ca
reens a bit, without her sym
pathetic character to hold things
together. Her place in Oskar's
life is filled by a succession of
loners, madmen and midgets.
Especially noteworthy is Charles
Aznavour as a sensitive, but
doomed Jewish shopkeeper.
These castoffs from society are
the only characters who preserve
their heart and integrity through
the Nazi era.
The huge scale of The Tin
Drum covers four generations,
from Oskar's peasant grand
mother (who begins and ends the
film, surviving it all) to his own
illegitimate son. The result is a
complex vision of 20th-century
Germany, as seen through the
eyes of a mysterious child, alter
nately touching and frightening.
Oskar emerges intact though not
untainted. When the Nazis are
vanquished at the end of the war,
he decides to resume growing up.
The viewer is left with the bit
tersweet sight of Oskar tossing
aside his tin drum, abandoning
forever the deeply moving vigil
of his childhood.

Anyone with lingering doubts
about the sanity of the aduFt
world will find a sympathetic
voice in The Tin Drum. And for
those of us who still harbor a sec
ret allegiance to childhood, the
film provides a genuine hero in
Oskar Mazerath, a 3-year
old boy in World War II Ger
many who refuses to grow up.
Winner of the 1980 Academy
Award for best foreign picture,
The Tin Drum is an epic adapta
tion of Gunter Grass' challeng
ing novel. Director Volkar
Schlondorff has turned this
modern German classic into a
film of stunning visual grace and
emotional power.
The film's star is a tiny,
frighteningly sharp 11-year-old
named David Bennent. As
young Oskar, Bennent looks out
at tfoe world behind hauntingly
pale blue eyes which see every
thing and reveal nothing.
The picture's point of view be
longs to Oskar. He narrates as
well as performs (the German
dialogue has subtitles, but the
visual imagery usually speaks
eloquently for itself). The cam
era operates chiefly from the
boy's 4-foot height.
The visual images are rich, dis
turbing and daringly intimate.
Schlondorffs camera is com
pletely at home in the private
confines of bedroom, church,
even wom£>. In the scene of Os
kar's birth, the camera follows
his perilous journey out of his
mother and into the new world.
All the while, Oskar's voice dis
passionately records his displea
sure at being evicted from such
hospitable accommodations into
a hostile, uncertain world.
Oskar's early years coincide
with the rise of the Nazi party in
Germany. At age 3, he an
nounces that he has had enough.
Watching the drunken antics of
his family at his birthday party,
he decides to remain a child
forever and so to avoid the dup
licitous entanglements of the
adult world. ,Tl iat Oskar's
strange power to control his
growth seems perfectly natural is
a tribute to both his performance
and Schlondorff s adaptation of
Grass' surrealistic novel. ' ,
The body of the film follows
Oskar's progress to the age of 20.
His physical appearance never
changes. He keeps the world at
bay with a tin drum — symbol of
his perennial youth — and a
superhuman screaming ability,
which allows him to shatter glass

and wreak hilarious havoc.
The events transpiring around
Oskar are much less light
hearted. The Nazis come to
power and threaten the boy's
home town of Danzig, located
between Germany and Poland.
The allegiance of his mother
(Angela Winkler) is torn bet
ween her patriotic German hus
band and Jan, her Polish cousin
and lover. In the film's most ex
traordinary scene, she meets a
fisherman hauling a cow's de
composed head onto a beach, the
carcass-bait filled with slithering
eels. After this horrifying por
tent of societal chaos, the rising
Nazi tide drives the passionate
woman to self-destruction.
For the most part, Oscar
watches his country's political
confusion and his mother's sex
ual betrayals with an unnerving,
placid expression. On several oc
casions, however, the film builds
to apocalyptic seizures as the
small boy lashes out at the en
croaching world with his drum
ming and screeching. Oskar's

tions; he attacks the windows of
