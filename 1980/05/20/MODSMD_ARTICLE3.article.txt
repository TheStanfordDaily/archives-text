# Facility now student run
## Coffee House changes begin 
### Simon Labov Staff Writer 
The new student-run Coffee House
had its grand opening Friday night,
featuring informal discussions on the
future of the facility, and music by
Rooftop Magic. A brief history of the
Coffee House was distributed and a
contest to create a new logo was an
nounced.
The logo is just one of many changes
that are being worked on by Coffee
House Inc., the company formed by
students to run theTresidder facility. A
new manager, Steve Weise, has been
hired and will begin to coordinate some
changes in the beginning of June and

on into the summei*. according to Jon
McGee, the head .of the manager
search.
Weise has had extensive food service
experience including opening several
eateries at the University of Wisconsin.
"He's? a real personable guy, excellent
at his job. and will be responsive to
student and community ideas and in
put," McGee said.
Dick Butterfield, president of Coffee
House Inc., said that Weise will have
the whole summer to bring about the
changes he feels are necessary. Two
changes currently being planned in
clude getting a smoke remover and
large "Casablanca" style fans. Long

term plans include the possibility of ex
panding the kitchen area into the gal
lery space which will enable the pro
duction of specialty items like crepes
and fondue.
Since the change of management
May 1, some prices have been lowered,
programming changes have been
made, and student patronage has in
creased.
One student remarked that she liked
the student artwork that has appeared
and the new seating arrangement.
Peter Radcliff, a sophomore who fre
quents the Coffee House, appreciated
the lower prices but felt cramped in the
small smoking section.
The changes made so far are not too
obvious. "A coffee house is a coffee
house, you can't do much to it,"
Radcliff said. "If they tried to do any
thing too radical it wouldn't be a coffee
house anymore."
Butterfield said the goal is to make
the Coffee House a gathering place for
the community. One way the manage
ment is working to facilitate this is to
get as much community input and ideas
as possible. Student workers, student
coordinators, a sensitive manager, a

suggestion .box and Friday's discussion
are all aimed at getting such-input.
Personally. Butterfield feels Tresid
der Union is in dire need of such a
gathering spot and more. "Students
have to go off campus to pubs," he said,
"and we're lucky to not have people
getting hurt coming back." He also
noted that it will be getting more ex
pensive to go off-campus soon.
The Coffee House, in Butterfield's
view, is not a pub, and should not be
one. However, he indicated that as a
member of the Council of Presidents he
will be looking into the possibilities of
setting up a pub on campus.
