Quebec vote outcome unpredictable
MONTREAL — Quebec voters decide today whether to
take a major first step toward independence from Canada, a
break that would turn the "world's friendliest border" into
a question mark for the United States.
Quehecers are being asked in a referendum to endorse
their provincial government's proposal to negotiate
"sovereignty-association" for largely French-speaking
province.
Under this plan. Quebec would have political indepen
dence but would continue its close economic ties with the
rest of English-speaking Canada.
The last two pre-rcferendum opinion polls gave conflict
ing readings. One taken May 4-9 showed the "no" side with
a 12-percentage-point lead, but a survey made a week later
and published Sunday gave the "yes" 40 percent to 37
percent for the "no." with 23 percent either undecided or
refusing to answer.
Political analysts believe most of this undeclared vote will
end up in the "no" column.
The separatist Parti Quebecois of provincial Premier
Rene Levesque has stressed that no changes will occur
overnight if it receives the mandate it seeks. Years of
lengthy negotiation would lie ahead, and Levesque's party
pledges a second Quebec referendum on any resulting ag
reement.
Sovereignty for this province of 6.2 million people — 5
million of them French-speaking — could affect the United
States in important economic, military and political ways.
The 12-year-old Parti Quebecois. a broad coalition of
"independentists" from across the political spectrum, now
has a mildly leftist social democrat program. Some U.S.
officials say they believe it may move farther to the left if
Quebec gains independence.
Iran military practices maneuvers
The Iranian navy yesterday conducted maneuvers in the
Strait of Hormuz, the narrow passageway at Iran's southern
border through which much of the world'£oil passes. There
is a large U.S. naval force in the area.
Yesterday was the 198 th day of captivity for the 53
American hostages whose fate may be decided by the Ira
nian Parliament. The East German news agency said the
Parliament will meet officially the first time May 28. Islamic
fundamentalists, many of whom want the hostages put on
trial as spies, are expected to have a working majority in
Parliament. ' k
Tehran Radio said the military exercises also involved the
Iranian air force and marines and were the biggest since the
overthrow of the shah early last year. Iranian President
Abolhassan Bani-Sadr was reported to have flown to the
Persian Gulf island of Abu Musa to supervise the operation.
The quality of the Iranian air force and army is believed
by Washington analysts to have declined significantly since
the fall of the shah. Much of the Iranians' equipment is
inoperable because of a lack of spare parts.
The Iranian navy is thought to be in better shape than
either the army or air force but is considered incapable of
competing successfully with U.S. naval-air forces in the
waters off Iran. The United States has about two dozen
ships including aircraft carriers there.
Americans' personal income down
WASHINGTON — The income of Americans grew
sluggishly in April and factory usage fell as recessionary
conditions continued to spread through the economy, ac
cording to government data released yesterday.
The Commerce Department reported that personal in
come — which includes wages, rental income, stock di
vidends and interest minus Social Security payments —
grew a scant 0.02 percent last month to an annual $2.07
trillion.
The $500 million increase from March was the poorest
monthly performance since the last recession, when income
fell $1.5 billion in July 1975, Comrwfcrce data showed.
Even more telling was the decline in spending and in
crease in savings in April, said Commerce Department
analyst Adren Cooper.
"1 would not say that they tell us anything about the
duration of the downturn." Cooper said." But they do show
us the downward momentum is there."
The latest figures come on top of a number of other
national statistics that indicate a recession again is under
way.
The bright spot yesterday was another announcement
that the prime commercial lending rate continued to drop.
French-Soviet summit inconclusive
PARIS — The Soviet Union made no concessions over
Afghanistan at a heavily publicized summit meeting in Po
land between French President,<Valery Giscard d'Estaing
and Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.
The French and Soviet positions are "far apart and re
main far apart," a French spokesman said at the end of
more than five hours of talks at the 17th century, French
style Wilanow Palace near Warsaw.

Giscard nevertheless proposed a summit meeting of the
world's leading countries, probably the five permanent
members of the United Nations Security Council, to take
place some time next year to discuss the sources of interna
tional tensions.
This week's summit was the first between Brezhnev and
any Western chief of state since the Kremlin sent troops into
Afghanistan last December to help oust one Marxist presi
dent and install another more to its liking. More than
80,000 Soviet troops remain, according to intelligence
sources.
Although the Giscard spokesman said the French presi
dent had warned the Soviet leader not to take advantage of
the paralysis of Washington's foreign policy created by the
U.S. presidential election campaign, it was immediately
noted that the French proposal would in effect give the
Soviets a year to start withdrawing their troops from Af
ghanistan.
Fhe meeting received a chillv reception in Washington
and was criticized by some West European newspapers.
The influential Paris newspaper l.e Monde, in a
editorial, said the summit served Soviet interests alone.
Dialogue is a legitimate concern, Le Monde said, "but a
dialogue of the deaf remains a dialogue of the deaf."
L.A. court orders re-integration plan
LOS ANGELES — Superior Court Judge Paul Egly
today gave the school board 60 days to come up with a
rev ised plan to integrate as many schools as possible under a
new definition of what constitutes an integrated school.
"The resolution of the issue of definition is the linchpin of
the remedial portion of this case." Egly said in his long
awaited written ruling.
The judge, who was not available to explain the ruling,
said there are nearly 300 schools with 70 percent or more
black or Hispanic enrollments which he defines as segre
gated.
"The court intends to adopt a definition of a multi-ethnic
desegregation school that would require a plurality of white
children plus or minus 5 percent over the largest of any of
the minority groups present." Egly said.
He said the school district has 60 days to prepare a plan to
integrate — by that definition — as many of the 300 segre
gated schools as possible.
The decision did not appear to please anyone. Three
members of the school board said they would seek an im
mediate appeal of Egly's order, and attorneys representing
some of the minority plaintiffs said they too would appeal.
Carter, Reagan favored in primaries
President Jimniv Carter and Ronald Reagan looked yes
terday for double state ballot victories to push them ever
closer to nomination as the Democratic and Republican
presidential gladiators this fall.
Carter, who only recently ended his self-imposed isola
tion in the White House, ventured out again yesterday to
speak to a brief, midafternoon pep rally of volunteers and
staff workers at Carter-Mondale campaign headquarters in
Washington.
The president was favored in the polls by a 2-1 margin
over Sen. Edward Kennedy among Utah Democrats hold
ing mass meetings across the state yesterday to determine
the commitments of Utah's 20 delegates to the Democratic
National Convention this August.
Utah Republicans also were holding mass meetings, but
the balloting was non-binding on delegates selected for the
GOP state convention June 27-28. when the makeup of the
21-member delegation to the party's national convention
will be decided.
While Carter is the favorite in Oregon today in the battle
for 39 Democratic convention delegates, neither he nor
Kennedy is on ballot in Michigan. The state party already
has chosen its Democratic delegates by caucuses, giving
Kennedy a 71-70 delegate edge over the president.
Korean regime arrests dissidents
SEOUL — More than 100 dissidents have been seized
and many more have fled to avoid arrest since the South
Korean military crackdown began two days ago. according
to reliable sources.
The number of arrests is reported to be about four times
greater than the military has acknowledged and is steadily
increasing as nighttime raids continue.
Since the sweeping new martial law orders were an
nounced late Sunday night, authorities have acknowledged
the arrest of only 26 persons, including Kim Dae Jung, the
veteran opposition leader, and Kim Jong Pil, president of
the majority party in the National Assembly.
But sources in the dissident community said yesterday
they had verified the arrest of 105 persons, not including a
half-dozen political figures and former government officials
taken in for investigation of alleged corruption.
Many of those seized are professors and religious leaders
who are veteran dissenters, and others are student leaders
suspected of hav ing been involved in last week's massive
demonstrations here.
Meanwhile, troops operating under martial law authority

continued yesterday to suppress the latest attempts to de
monstrate against the government. In the provincial capital
of Kwang-Ju, thousands of students and citizens filled the
streets most ol the day and were finally dispersed by para
troopers and other forces.
Several members of the national assembly attempted to
enter the halls ot that legislature yesterday, but were turned
away by troops. Fhe martial law command has banned the
assembly from meeting. It was scheduled to convene this
morning.
Congress opposes Carter's gas fee
WASHINGTON — President Jimmy Carter said yester
day that Americans would face "much greater price in
creases" for oil if Congress kills his 10-cent-a-gallon
gasoline conservation fee.
Fhe fee, designed to reduce oil imports, was originally
scheduled to take effect last Thursday but has been delayed
during a court battle over its legality. In addition. Congress
is considering bills that would kill the fee by removing the
president's authority to impose it.
"I hope that the president will draw back from this con
frontation and spare himselt the embarrassment of losing in
the Senate and in the House and then losing again in

the courts," said Rep. Thomas Downey (D-N.Y.), wlio
supports Carter lor re-election but fiercelyopposes the oil
import fee. "I don't know what he gains from getting his
head bashed in time after time."
According to Carter, the fee would send a "clear signal
to U.S. allies to restrain oil consumption, and to the OPEC
countries that the country is serious about conservation.
Downey and others do not believe administration claims
that the fee would be passed through only to gasoline under
a complicated regulatory mechanism, or that it would actu
ally curb the nation's thirst for oil. "Aside from the cost,
aside from the fact it won't lessen our dependence on oil and
aside from the fact it's unenforceable, it's a great idea," said
Downey.
