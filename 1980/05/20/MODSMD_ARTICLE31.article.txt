# Sophomore seminars to begin
## 
### Mary Haber Staff Writer 
Sophomore seminars will be added
next year "to enhance the sophomore
program." said Ombudsman John Go
heen. who will be director of the prog
ram.
The program was passed by the Fa
culty Senate recently along with the
Western Culture, and distribution re
quirement programs. Goheen re
marked that these new requirements
"threatened the freshman seminars."
As a result the majority of this year's
freshman seminars will be offered to
next year's sophomore class.
Forty seminars which fulfill the writ
ing requirement will remain as
freshman classes. Forty-nine others
will be offered to sophomores.
Next year's sophomores received
lists of the seminars in the mail Friday
and catalogs describing the course
should be available early this week, ac-

cording to Kathy Thoelecke, director
of the freshman seminar program and
staff advisor for Approaching Stanford.
In comparison to the courses offered
this year, 21 of the courses will have the
same or very similar content as the cur
rent freshman seminars, while the re
maining 28 will be new. Goheen re
marked, "Most seminars are equally
good for freshman and sophomores.
Their content is such that they are as
much of a challenge to sophomores as
to freshmen."
Thoelecke added that Dean of Un
dergraduate Studies Herant Katch-

adourian will "maintain the standards
of academic rigor."
Both Goheen and Thoelecke re
marked that the professors and lectur
ers are as eager to teach treshmen as
they are to teach sophomores.
The seminars, according to Goheen.
will help to ease the void, commonly
known as. the "sophomore slump," be
tween the "emphasis the University
places on the freshman year" and the
time a student declares a major, when a
department starts to "look out for
you."
