### Ken Kurosu Staff Writer 
A proposition to amend California's
constitution to protect the confidential
ity of news sources — Proposition 5 —
is the latest development in the grow
ing controversy over the definition of
the freedom of the press.
"We have not taken a position on
Proposition 5, and probably will not,"
said lyfra'rcia Gallo, spokesperson for
the American Civil Liberties Union in
San Francisco, reflecting the wide
spread caution over commenting on
the proposition.

News analysis

Proposition 5, the Freedom of Press
Legislative Constitutional Amend
ment, would grant state constitutional
protection for the rights of reporters
and media sourccs to maintain the con
fidentiality of news sources. Reporters
would no longer be subject to contempt
citations for failing to disclose sources
of information obtained for publica
tion, as well as for refusing to reveal
any unpublished information Obtained
in the preparation of a news story.
The proposition passed both houses
of the California Legislature in August
1978 and has been placed on the June 3
ballot.
"We have supported freedom of the
press and have no problems with this

amendment," a spokesman for 21st
district assemblyman Victor Calvo
said.
Perhaps unnecessary
Yet some experts question the need
for writing such provisions into the
constitution.
"I do have reservations about tam
pering with the constitution," said
Communication Adjunct Professor
Marion Lewenstein. She likened the re
lationship of reporters and sources to
the confidential relationship between
doctors and patients which exists with
out constitutional protection.
"That same sort of attitude or feeling
can and should be developed," she
said.
Recent legislative and judicial ac
tions do signal some threats to freedom
of the press, Lewenstein said.
Nevertheless, she added, "I'm not fully
convinced that the way to deal with this
erosion of freedom is a constitutional
amendment."
"It does worry me a little that we're
passing a constitutional amendment,"
said Communication Assistant Pro
fessor Diana Tillinghast. "Something
that can be passed this easily can be
taken away if the mood of the public
swings against the press," she said.
, 1972 Supreme Court ruling
In 1972, the United States Supreme
Court ruled in Briinzburgv. Hayes that
First Amendment guarantees do not

grant newspersons the right to refuse to
testify before grand juries even if tes
timony were to reveal information on
confidential sources.
"I'm against Proposition 5, and I
agree with the majority opinion of the
U.S. Supreme Court," said Political
Science Emeritus Professor Robert
Horn.
Given the guidelines issued along
with the Supreme Court ruling, sub
poenaing reporters for information on
sources is acceptable, he said.
In Branzburg, the Supreme Court
did allow for legislative action by Con
gress or state legislatures to enact laws
protecting reporters.

"There is merit in leaving state legis
latures free, within First Amendment
limits, to fashion their own standards,"
said Assoc. Justice Byron White,
speaking for the majority.
Current laws
California's Legislature has enacted
laws protecting the confidentiality of
reporters' sources. Recently, however,
courts have asserted that these laws in
terfere with their constitutional duties.
The amendment would resolve this
conflict by placing the protective
clauses into the language of the con
stitution.
"This amendment merely places into
