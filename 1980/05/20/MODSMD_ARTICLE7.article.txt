Top-seeded Stanford breezed to

University of Utah last night in the
rain-delayed opening of the NCAA

Coach Dick Gould's Cardinals
had to wait until 1:05 a.m. EDT to
finish off Utah because of an all-day
rain which forced all eight contests
to be played on six indoor courts.
Only two of the team contests
were extended to nine matches, one
of them involving today's Stanford

opponent, Sth-seeded Clemson.
which edged 9th-seeded Princeton
5-4.
All of the top-eight seeded teams
won yesterday. Quarterfinal play
begins this morning and the Cards
will taken on Clemson at 1:30 p.m.
EDT. Rain is expected again today.
