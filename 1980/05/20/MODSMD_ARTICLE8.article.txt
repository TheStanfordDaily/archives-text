## Only the skyline remains Angolan prosperity fades 
### David Lamb The Los Angeles Times 
LUANDA, Angola — It is hard to believe now,
but only a few years ago Luanda was known as the
Rio de Janeiro of Africa. And Angola was full of
prosperity and abundance. Ask a Portugese what
lite was like here then, and he will smile, close his
eyes and blow a kiss.
When Angola was a Portugese colony, he will
say, it was a far better place to live than Lisbon,
with weekends spent on the beach eating fresh
lobsters and prawns, shops stuffed with gourmet
foods and the latest European fashions, luxury
high-rise apartments overlooking the bay, summer
homes at Lobito and Luanda.
Luanda has 170 nightclubs and restaurants. It
was built on hills that rose gently from the bay, and
the sidewalks were paved with mosaic tiland the
streets were wide and lined with trees. There were
parks everywhere, neatly clipped and ablaze with
flowers. The skyline, from the 25-story President
Hotel to the 17th-century Dutch fort a few miles
away, was like nothing anywhere else in Africa.
As Recently as 1972, Angola grew 90 percent of
its own food and was the world's fourth-largest
coffee producer. It had oil, diamonds and iron —
and its annual industrial production topped $40
million. It had 17 radio stations, 16 newspapers
and 15 magazines.
But all that was before the Portugese empire —
and Angola — collapsed, leaving in its wake here a
Marxist revolutionary state.
Disaster
More than any European power in Africa, Por
tugal, the poorest nation in Western Europe, had
pursued a policy that guaranteed eventual disaster,
not only for the empire but for the future of its
colonies as well. Places like Angola were the exclu
sive domain of white men who would stay on
forever.
When independence came in 1975, after 15
years of rebellion. 98 percent of the Angolans were
illiterate. There were few with any technical skills
and virtually none with university degrees.
Most of the 750.000 Portugese fled Angola —
the whitest colony in black Africa at the time of
independence. They took with them everything
they could carry or ship — vehicles, telephones,
typewriters, coins to be melted down for the silver
in them, even the faucets from bathrooms.
Skyline
Today you can still stand on the patio of the
Panorama Hotel and gaze out across the bay at
Africa's most beautiful skyline. But not much else
is the same.
The mosaic sidewalks have cracked and buckled,
and garbage tills the streets. The luxury Hats are
occupied by squatters, and laundry flaps on the
balconies. The odor of urine fills the corridors; rats
scurry through the abandoned restaurants; torn
and filthy awnings hang limply in the stifling after
noon heat. The parks are overgrown, the rusting
frames of wrecked cars litter the streets.
A visitor is struck by the eerie notion that he has
entered a ghost town. Block after block of stores is
closed, windows broken and boarded up.
Elevators don't work. Cargo stands rotting at the
port. Neon signs flash above IBM. Sony and Singer
showrooms that have been empty for five years.
Indeed, after five centuries of Portugese domi

nation and five years of Marxist revolution guided
by the Soviet Union, Angola is a fragile and
wounded country in a state of utter deterioration.
A 2010-mile trip through four Angolan pro
vinces produced little evidence of anything save
decay and stagnation, incompetence and ineffi
ciency. Most of the people appear to bored and
obedient.
The Angolans, victims of both the past and the
present, are a kind and proud people. And their
country, twice the size of Texas, has the potential
for considerable economic growth. Income from
Gulf Oil Corp. production in the Angolan enclave
of Cabinda is in the neighborhood of $5 million a
day.
But, according to Western economic sources,
60 cents of every dollar earned goes either to the
military or toward repaying Angola's debt to the
Soviet Union. The' coffee crop, now negligible,
goes to Cuba, the fish to Russia. There are more
than 40,000 East Bloc soldiers and civilians here,
and none of them came for free. For every Cuban
teacher, for example, the Angolan government re
portedly pays Havana $600 a month.
No budget
Angola has not published a budget since 1977.
The same applies to its year-to-year development
plan. The once-flourishing press has dwindled to
two government newspapers and a single radio
station, and Angolans learn only what the ruling
party thinks they should know. An estimated 2000
people who have dared to speak or act indepen
dently are in prison.
The Marxist party that runs Angola was once a
guerrilla movement, the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola, which fought the Por
tugese and came to power with the help of Cuban
troops. It has a 45-member Central Committee
presided over by the country's president, Eduardo
dos Santos, 38, who succeeded-Agostinho Neto
when Neto died last September.
Egalitarian
Unlike many African governments, Angola's
has never wasted money on flashy prestige pro
jects. and corruption is virtually non-existent. The
government has encouraged the emergence of an
egalitarian society where black and white, rich and
poor, enjoy no special privileges. Cabinet ministers
live modestly on salaries of $800 a month — al
though they do have access to whiskey, cars and
food not available to most Angolans.
But the handful of revolutionary zealots in the
government is righting what appears to be an im
possible battle.
Angolans can buy food at government shops, but
only if they have a card that shows they are
employed. They need permission to change ad
dresses or to travel. They are allowed to leave
Angola once every three years, but getting an exit
visa takes six or seven months, and no individual
make take more than the equivalent of $75 out of
the country.
"We're producing 600 tires a day, but God
knows how we're doing it," said an executive at
General Tire and Rubber Co. of Akron, Ohio, the
only U.S. manufacturer operating here. "The
workers come in the morning and push the buttons,
and if everything works, fine. If it doesn't, they just
go home."

the sidewalks were paved with mosaic tiland the
streets were wide and lined with trees. There were
parks everywhere, neatly clipped and ablaze with
flowers. The skyline, from the 25-story President
Hotel to the 17th-century Dutch fort a few miles
away, was like nothing anywhere else in Africa.
As Recently as 1972, Angola grew 90 percent of
its own food and was the world's fourth-largest
coffee producer. It had oil, diamonds and iron —
and its annual industrial production topped $40
million. It had 17 radio stations, 16 newspapers
and 15 magazines.
But all that was before the Portugese empire —
and Angola — collapsed, leaving in its wake here a
Marxist revolutionary state.
Disaster
More than any European power in Africa, Por
tugal, the poorest nation in Western Europe, had
pursued a policy that guaranteed eventual disaster,
not only for the empire but for the future of its
colonies as well. Places like Angola were the exclu
sive domain of white men who would stay on
forever.
When independence came in 1975, after 15
years of rebellion. 98 percent of the Angolans were
illiterate. There were few with any technical skills
and virtually none with university degrees.
Most of the 750.000 Portugese fled Angola —
the whitest colony in black Africa at the time of
independence. They took with them everything
they could carry or ship — vehicles, telephones,
typewriters, coins to be melted down for the silver
in them, even the faucets from bathrooms.
Skyline
Today you can still stand on the patio of the
Panorama Hotel and gaze out across the bay at
Africa's most beautiful skyline. But not much else
is the same.
The mosaic sidewalks have cracked and buckled,
and garbage tills the streets. The luxury Hats are
occupied by squatters, and laundry flaps on the
balconies. The odor of urine fills the corridors; rats
scurry through the abandoned restaurants; torn
and filthy awnings hang limply in the stifling after
noon heat. The parks are overgrown, the rusting
frames of wrecked cars litter the streets.
A visitor is struck by the eerie notion that he has
entered a ghost town. Block after block of stores is
closed, windows broken and boarded up.
Elevators don't work. Cargo stands rotting at the
port. Neon signs flash above IBM. Sony and Singer
showrooms that have been empty for five years.
Indeed, after five centuries of Portugese domi

nation and five years of Marxist revolution guided
by the Soviet Union, Angola is a fragile and
wounded country in a state of utter deterioration.
A 2010-mile trip through four Angolan pro
vinces produced little evidence of anything save
decay and stagnation, incompetence and ineffi
ciency. Most of the people appear to bored and
obedient.
The Angolans, victims of both the past and the
present, are a kind and proud people. And their
country, twice the size of Texas, has the potential
for considerable economic growth. Income from
Gulf Oil Corp. production in the Angolan enclave
of Cabinda is in the neighborhood of $5 million a
day.
But, according to Western economic sources,
60 cents of every dollar earned goes either to the
military or toward repaying Angola's debt to the
Soviet Union. The' coffee crop, now negligible,
goes to Cuba, the fish to Russia. There are more
than 40,000 East Bloc soldiers and civilians here,
and none of them came for free. For every Cuban
teacher, for example, the Angolan government re
portedly pays Havana $600 a month.
No budget
Angola has not published a budget since 1977.
The same applies to its year-to-year development
plan. The once-flourishing press has dwindled to
two government newspapers and a single radio
station, and Angolans learn only what the ruling
party thinks they should know. An estimated 2000
people who have dared to speak or act indepen
dently are in prison.
The Marxist party that runs Angola was once a
guerrilla movement, the Popular Movement for
the Liberation of Angola, which fought the Por
tugese and came to power with the help of Cuban
troops. It has a 45-member Central Committee
presided over by the country's president, Eduardo
dos Santos, 38, who succeeded-Agostinho Neto
when Neto died last September.
Egalitarian
Unlike many African governments, Angola's
has never wasted money on flashy prestige pro
jects. and corruption is virtually non-existent. The
government has encouraged the emergence of an
egalitarian society where black and white, rich and
poor, enjoy no special privileges. Cabinet ministers
live modestly on salaries of $800 a month — al
though they do have access to whiskey, cars and
food not available to most Angolans.
But the handful of revolutionary zealots in the
government is righting what appears to be an im
possible battle.
Angolans can buy food at government shops, but
only if they have a card that shows they are
employed. They need permission to change ad
dresses or to travel. They are allowed to leave
Angola once every three years, but getting an exit
visa takes six or seven months, and no individual
make take more than the equivalent of $75 out of
the country.
"We're producing 600 tires a day, but God
knows how we're doing it," said an executive at
General Tire and Rubber Co. of Akron, Ohio, the
only U.S. manufacturer operating here. "The
workers come in the morning and push the buttons,
and if everything works, fine. If it doesn't, they just
go home."
LUANDA, Angola — It is hard to believe now,
but only a few years ago Luanda was known as the
Rio de Janeiro of Africa. And Angola was full of
prosperity and abundance. Ask a Portugese what
lite was like here then, and he will smile, close his
eyes and blow a kiss.
When Angola was a Portugese colony, he will
say, it was a far better place to live than Lisbon,
with weekends spent on the beach eating fresh
lobsters and prawns, shops stuffed with gourmet
foods and the latest European fashions, luxury
high-rise apartments overlooking the bay, summer
homes at Lobito and Luanda.
