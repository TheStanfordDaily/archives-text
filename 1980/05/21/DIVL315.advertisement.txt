"IT IS BY NO MEANS ENOUGH THAT AN OFFICER OF THE
NAVY SHOULD BE A CAPABLE MARINER. HE MUST BE THAT,
OF COURSE, BUT ALSO A GREAT DEAL MORE. HE SHOULD
BE AS WELL, A GENTLEMAN OF LIBERAL EDUCATION, RE
FINED MANNER, PUNCTILIOUS COURTESY, AND THE IN
CEST SENSE OF PERSONAL HONOR, ABLE TO EXPRESS
HIMSELF CLEARLY AND WITH FORCE IN HIS OWN LAN
GUAGE BOTH WITH TONGUE AND PEN."

Naval Officer is as valid today as it was when written over
200 years ago.
