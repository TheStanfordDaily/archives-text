# Bush triumphs in Michigan; Carter takes Oregon
## 
### Walter Mears The Associated Press 
George Bush won the Michigan presidential
primary election in a startling runaway last
night, but Ronald Reagan swept to victory in
Oregon to resume his march toward the Re
publican presidential nomination.
President Jimmy Carter easily defeated Sen.
Edward Kennedy in Oregon to win the day's
only real Democratic contest. That moved Car
ter closer to the renomination he already is
claiming.
In Michigan, Bush was gaining 57 percent of
the vote to Reagan's 32 percent. The former
United Nations ambassador said victory was "a
very big shot in the arm," and means "I
shouldn't be written off."
In Oregon, Reagan was gaining 57 percent
of the vote, Bush 33 percent.
Reagan 110 short
Reagan said he figured his delegate strength
had passed 900 nominating votes he needs.

". . . Today's results make us more certain than
ever that we will achieve the nomination, he
said.
Including delegates for which he led in
Michigan and Oregon, Reagan was just 110
votes short of the 998 commitments he needs
to gain a nominating majority, according to
The Associated Press delegate survey.
He had won or led for 888 delegates to 256
for Bush.
The AP count includes delegates who are
legally bound to Reagan or who have declared
him their choice.
ABC and CBS News said their projections
showed that in Oregon and Michigan Reagan
gained enough delegate votes to achieve the
majority that would install him atop the GOP
ticket.
The Oregon count, with 40 percent of the
precincts reporting:
Carter 40,801 or 59 percent, for 26 dele
gates.

Kennedy 22,527 or 32 percent, for 13 dele
gates.
California Gov. Jerry Brown, a campaign
dropout, had 9 percent of the vote.
Republicans
Reagan 38,112 or 57 percent for 18 dele
gates.
Bush 21,894 or 33 percent for 11 delegates.
Rep. John Anderson, out of the Republican
race but still on the primary ballots, was gaining
9 percent of the vote.
Carter and Kennedy stayed off the ballot in
Michigan, where Democrats held a primary
that didn't count.
Kennedy said the Democratic race is "abso
lutely not" over, and accused Carter of trying
to put up a smokescreen by suggesting on
Monday that his renomination is assured.
Bush said in advance that a win in Michigan
would upset Reagan's "bandwagon psychol
ogy." He campaigned with Gov. William Milli
ken and said his victory would have been im

possible without the governor's support.
The turnout was light, and Bush was
aided by crossover Democrats who had no
thing meaningful to vote about in their own
primary.
John Gnau, Reagan's state campaign man
ager, said simply, "1 don't know what went
wrong, but it all adds up to a victory for George
Bush, and I congratulate him."
This was the Republican count in Michigan
with 73 percent of the precincts counted:
Bush 272,208 or 57 percent, to lead for 53
delegates.
Reagan 151,662 or 32 percent, for 29 dele
gates.
Anderson had 8 percent and the rest of the
vote was scattered.
"I'm elated. It was a major win," Bush said
in Cleveland.
Nonetheless, Reagan's national lead in dele
gate commitments was too massive to be un

done in the primaries.
James Baker. Bush's national campaign
manager, said Michigan voters had declared
"they don't think the game is over. . . and what
George Bush got in Michigan today was a
mandate to keep holding them for a while, and
that's what he intends to do."
"Obviously, it is a major psychological
boost," Baker said, adding that it should ena
ble Bush to raise additional campaign funds for
the balance of the primaries.
Oregon held the only Carter-Kennedy con
test yesterday; Michigan Democrats already
have assigned their delegates by caucus, with
Kennedy winning 71 and Carter 70.
In the national Democratic competition.
Carter has 1364 delegates, Kennedy 771. It
will take 1666 to win that party's nomination.
Kennedy, like Bush, is conceding nothing to
his party's frontrunner; he says he will take his
campaign all the way to the Democratic Na
tional Convention.

had passed 900 nominating votes he needs.

". . . Today's results make us more certain than
ever that we will achieve the nomination, he
said.
Including delegates for which he led in
Michigan and Oregon, Reagan was just 110
votes short of the 998 commitments he needs
to gain a nominating majority, according to
The Associated Press delegate survey.
He had won or led for 888 delegates to 256
for Bush.
The AP count includes delegates who are
legally bound to Reagan or who have declared
him their choice.
ABC and CBS News said their projections
showed that in Oregon and Michigan Reagan
gained enough delegate votes to achieve the
majority that would install him atop the GOP
ticket.
The Oregon count, with 40 percent of the
precincts reporting:
Carter 40,801 or 59 percent, for 26 dele
gates.

Kennedy 22,527 or 32 percent, for 13 dele
gates.
California Gov. Jerry Brown, a campaign
dropout, had 9 percent of the vote.
Republicans
Reagan 38,112 or 57 percent for 18 dele
gates.
Bush 21,894 or 33 percent for 11 delegates.
Rep. John Anderson, out of the Republican
race but still on the primary ballots, was gaining
9 percent of the vote.
Carter and Kennedy stayed off the ballot in
Michigan, where Democrats held a primary
that didn't count.
Kennedy said the Democratic race is "abso
lutely not" over, and accused Carter of trying
to put up a smokescreen by suggesting on
Monday that his renomination is assured.
Bush said in advance that a win in Michigan
would upset Reagan's "bandwagon psychol
ogy." He campaigned with Gov. William Milli
ken and said his victory would have been im

possible without the governor's support.
The turnout was light, and Bush was
aided by crossover Democrats who had no
thing meaningful to vote about in their own
primary.
John Gnau, Reagan's state campaign man
ager, said simply, "1 don't know what went
wrong, but it all adds up to a victory for George
Bush, and I congratulate him."
This was the Republican count in Michigan
with 73 percent of the precincts counted:
Bush 272,208 or 57 percent, to lead for 53
delegates.
Reagan 151,662 or 32 percent, for 29 dele
gates.
Anderson had 8 percent and the rest of the
vote was scattered.
"I'm elated. It was a major win," Bush said
in Cleveland.
Nonetheless, Reagan's national lead in dele
gate commitments was too massive to be un

done in the primaries.
James Baker. Bush's national campaign
manager, said Michigan voters had declared
"they don't think the game is over. . . and what
George Bush got in Michigan today was a
mandate to keep holding them for a while, and
that's what he intends to do."
"Obviously, it is a major psychological
boost," Baker said, adding that it should ena
ble Bush to raise additional campaign funds for
the balance of the primaries.
Oregon held the only Carter-Kennedy con
test yesterday; Michigan Democrats already
have assigned their delegates by caucus, with
Kennedy winning 71 and Carter 70.
In the national Democratic competition.
Carter has 1364 delegates, Kennedy 771. It
will take 1666 to win that party's nomination.
Kennedy, like Bush, is conceding nothing to
his party's frontrunner; he says he will take his
campaign all the way to the Democratic Na
tional Convention.
George Bush won the Michigan presidential
primary election in a startling runaway last
night, but Ronald Reagan swept to victory in
Oregon to resume his march toward the Re
publican presidential nomination.
President Jimmy Carter easily defeated Sen.
Edward Kennedy in Oregon to win the day's
only real Democratic contest. That moved Car
ter closer to the renomination he already is
claiming.
In Michigan, Bush was gaining 57 percent of
the vote to Reagan's 32 percent. The former
United Nations ambassador said victory was "a
very big shot in the arm," and means "I
shouldn't be written off."
In Oregon, Reagan was gaining 57 percent
of the vote, Bush 33 percent.
Reagan 110 short
Reagan said he figured his delegate strength
had passed 900 nominating votes he needs.
