The Associated Press
Iran's U.N. ambassador yesterday was
quoted as saying it is not in his country's best
interests to continue holding the 53 Ameri
can hostages, who spent their 1 99th day in
captivity.
Mansour Farhang, the ambassador, was
quoted bya Tehran newspaper as saying Iran
has gotten as much "political and prop
aganda" capital out of the hostage issue as it
can. and that Iran now faces "international
isolation" because of the standoff.
"I think that continuing to hold hostages
isn't at all in line with our benefits," Farhang
was reported to have told the newspaper En
ghelab lslami. The newspaper was founded
by Iranian President Abolhassan Bani-Sadr.
who has said he wants the hostage stalemate
ended so Iran can concentrate on domestic
problems.
Farhang was quoted in the newspaper in
terview as saying the rescue mission "in
creased the hostage crisis" and made a set
tlement more difficult.
He also was reported to have said the hold
ing of the hostages plays into the hands of
right-wing elements in the United States and
weakens the "progressive minority" there.
The ambassador commented one week be
fore the new Iranian Parliament is scheduled
to begin work. Ayatollah Ruhollah Kho

meini. Iran's revolutionary leader, had
handed parliament the job of deciding what
to do with the American captives.
The Parliament will be dominated by Is
lamic hardliners, many of whom demand the
return of the shah and his wealth to Iran in
return for the hostages' freedom.
Japan toda\ announced limited sanctions
against Iran, but continued negotiations with
Khomeini's regime on oil imports and pre
pared to resume building the S3 billion Ban
dar Khomeini petrochemical plant.
The sanctions will follow the basic line set
forth Sunday by the Common Market, which
said all contracts signed after the 53 Ameri
cans were seized in Iran Nov. 4 will be sus
pended to speed the release of the hostages.
Japan exported $200 million to $300 mill
ion a month worth of steel, machinery, tex
tiles and chemical goods to Iran before the
overthrow o'f the shah 16 months ago.
Trade perked up again this year, with ex
ports totaling $238 million in March, but
dropped to $186 million in April. Japanese
officials said practically no new contracts
have been signed with Iran in the past month.
Iran, which at the beginning of the year
contracted to sell Japan 530,000 barrels of
oil a day, 1 1 percent of Japan's needs, stop
ped all shipments April 21 when Japanese
importers refused to pay a $2.50-a-barrel

increase.
But Japanese officials said Tokyo oil trad
ers are still trying to negotiate the dispute
with the Iranians, insisting that the matter is
purely economic.
They also said an agreement was reachcd
Sunday in Tehran to resume construction on
the $3 billion petrochemical project a
Japanese group was building in Bandar
Khomeini, in southern Iran.
Work on the project was halted in late
1978 because of political turmoil in Iran, and
stalled thereafter because of a dispute over
back pay for Japanese workers and the new
regime's demands for more management
control.
Meanwhile, President Abolhassan
Bani-Sadr returned to Tehran today after
observing Iranian naval maneuvers in the
Strait of Hormuz. through which much of the
world's oil passes. The U.S. Navy has a 24-
ship task force in the area.
Tehran Radio said the Iranian exercises
were the biggest since the overthrow of Shah
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.
Iran's new parliament, charged with de
termining the hostages' fate, begins work
May 28. It is dominated by Islamic hardlin
ers, many of whom demand the return of the
